They fired their wands into the air, blue sparks coming from Draco’s as gold ones came from Harry’s.
Draco caught the smile and popped an eyebrow up, "what?"
“You doing okay, darling?” Draco asked, “have to get you opened up good so you can take my cock, yeah?”
Harry chuckled as he looked down at Draco, seeing that his eyes were already closed, “Likewise.”
Harry stepped back a mere inch as Draco stood and pulled his trousers back up, adjusting them to his liking. Harry stepped back close to him once he was settled, taking Draco’s chin into his hand and having him look at him.
"Jump."
“Are you going to tell him?” Draco asked, walking around behind Harry where he was now standing, “no? Well, then it’ll be my honor.”
Draco lost his words as a smack landed to his backside. It wasn’t a playful smack, either. It was a smack that quite frankly told Draco to shut up. He caught his breath before he dared to turn his head over his shoulder, taking in the stern look on Harry’s face and turning back forward.
Harry merely chuckled as he pulled back out to the tip, taking Draco’s hips into his hands before slamming back inside of him.
“There’s only one problem with that,” Harry dismissed, “Pomfrey took our wands.”
"Want you to fuck me, Malfoy, please!"
They both said nothing, but Ron did reach for his robe. He lifted up the side of it, showing his house emblem. Harry raised an eyebrow at him before catching on and looking down at his own robe.
“If you want to get at him, try to do it in front of his friends.”
He reveled in the sharp intake of breath he heard from the other boy as he began to pump his finger. He felt Harry give away, enough for him to add another finger and scissor them. He continued this for a few minutes before feeling satisfied that Harry could take him.
Harry’s back was arching, moans leaving his lips much the same way air was leaving his lungs with every harsh thrust.
“P-please,” Harry huffed out, “need to cum”
Good thing he wasn’t into one-night stands.
Draco shook his head as moved towards the door, opening it and turning halfway to Harry.
A waiter came by to grab their plates and Harry stopped her. The waiter snatched her hand away and placed the bill on the table, taking the plates and cutlery. Fuck. A byproduct of demanding they meet somewhere muggle, he guessed. No witch would have ever treated the saviour that way. Refreshing at it was, it threw a wrench in their plans.
Harry looked to Verity for confirmation, and she nodded.
"No, it's the principle of the thing," Ron agreed.
"Close your mouth or I'll tell your mum on you." He stirred his half-empty drink with his straw. "What do you mean by so...?"
"Allah be praised. That man got drunk off his arse last night."
Harry laughed. "Yeah, I suppose I do."
"I wasn't in love with her, Potter. There's a difference. I loved her, most pureblood marriages don't even have that. I needed to marry, and I was prepared to."
"What's wrong is that you responded to Harry."
"Yeah okay, Potter. Just tell me when the Portkey is." Malfoy flipped open his paper and grimaced at whatever he saw before tossing it back on the kitchen table.
"You don't know?"
"What'd you hit him with?" Harry asked.
"I have an idea," Teddy said and both he and Malfoy shut up immediately.
When they had finished up all their purchases and bought foot-long hot dogs from a vendor which Malfoy grimaced at and declined, it was 6:30 and they had half an hour drop Teddy off at the hotel and get to the Shaw's flat.
He nodded and stood up just as Harry was about to get a sample into the machine. Malfoy crumpled up a napkin in his hand and threw it into the empty takeaway container.
Harry blinked. Well, that was something. He walked towards the very back of the stacks where he knew Peter wouldn't be able to see or hear him and removed his invisibility cloak so he could see better. The file wasn't nearly as full as he thought it'd be, but he attributed that to the fact that these were only the cold cases and gave himself a mental  pat on the back.
"You're very honest, Malfoy. You always have been. I like that about you."
"You're dating some guy named Jerome."
Harry could feel himself wanting to say yes, wanting to know what would happen if he went inside with Malfoy, if he let himself taste his lips, if he let himself sink his hands into that ridiculous blond hair and kiss him till he was gasping.
b) Mediation
"You could wait to feed him till morning. It's almost 3, I'm sure he's asleep by now."
Harry pretended to think it over. "Good angry face, nice restaurant, waiting audience, oh and of course anyone who likes the Wimbourne Wasps."
Verity grinned, pumping his hand up and down, looking faintly ridiculous at her short, plump stature in comparison to Malfoy, considering how forceful she could be.
"I guess I know how we're spending our free time, now."
All around the room people noticing and pointing them out to their friends. Ron seemed to be enjoying it, though Hermione was glaring at everyone who so much as sniggered and Malfoy had that damn gleam in his eye. He shoved Jerome when he started mocking Harry, though.
There was one more thing they had to do before they left New York, and that was visit the Gibson's. Patricia Gibson was a powerful pureblood woman who had married into a half-blooded family against her parent's wishes. For this reason, she was very against blood supremacy and thus had the potential to be the murderer of Lucius Malfoy.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but Ginny looked positively delighted. "Another Bats fan? She's more than welcome to join."
"Evening out the numbers."
He got up off the couch and moved the cushion with his wand. Underneath was a blue and white bone that was shaking back and forth, not enough that Harry had noticed.
The lab was empty when they got in and Harry let out a sigh of relief. Explaining why he was there to anyone would have been very difficult.
In fact, he had no idea what it was that Ron wanted to do. Maybe laze about all day for the rest of his life. Perhaps once Harry got the joke shop back up and running, he'd join in on that.
"Oh well, it's good to be out, Mrs. Potalski."
"Has the Ministry selected a candidate?" she asked.
Draco raised his brows and scoffed. "Well come right on in then. You two can have a tea party since you're such old friends."
"What's this?"
Malfoy studied him and then nodded.
Malfoy fell back onto the couch and Harry straddled his legs so he could grind against him. Then, he finally did what he'd been wanting to since the day at the hotel when that drop of water slid down Malfoy's neck and he mouthed at it, letting the small gasps guide him as to what was best. "Then I'm figuring shit out," he said between kisses, "and you're helping me."
They picked up a pizza at the next place they saw.
"Yes well, I'm hiding out. Certain people I don't want to see happen to have my floo address."
"You might have already. I've seen him moping around. I was down at the ministry yesterday to deliver some papers and he was eating chocolate cake at his desk. At 10 a.m."
"Tea?"
"But I like women." He didn't say it with any intonation. It was obvious to him, so why was everyone else struggling with it?
"Between who did it? It's the person who killed my father, hard to have a preference there. On the one hand, I'd hate this for Astoria. On the other, I interacted with Mrs. Fawley, she was nice if not senile and I can't imagine her killing anyone."
He snapped his fingers twice and Harry handed it to him with a snort. Malfoy transfigured it back into a quill and used it to mark off names. He got rid of almost half before he was satisfied.
Ginny's face looked markedly less confident at that.
g) Never
Both Harry and Teddy agreed that tagging along was the best way to spend their time and it turned out that Malfoy wasn't very hard to convince in the face of his favourite cousin.
"You must be the hack," she said, sticking out a hand for him to shake.
No, no, no, this magic can't dieeeee
"You need to get her to eat something too," Ron mumbled. "She was holed up in her room all day yesterday. Don't think she left once."
"Why did you say you wanted to meet with me, again?" she asked.
"It was Fred and George's shop..." Harry tried, having the strangest feeling that if he made one wrong move everything around him would explode.
Malfoy blanched. "A nice friend, sir."
Harry looked at him, watching the way his shoulders clenched up by his ears.
"But," Harry gestured weakly, "but I don't know how to do all that."
He set to work in Fred and George's office, trying to outline a plan for the grand re-opening as he worked.
Malfoy laughed sharply. "What makes them special?"
Harry quickly broke the charm he'd cast and raced after him.
"When we sneak into the Kitchens."
They sat in silence again and Malfoy stubbed out his cigarette and downed the rest of his wine.
d) almost never
Finally, my biggest ambition is to
"Uh." Harry's eyes followed a drop of water as it trailed down Malfoy's neck. Holy Merlin.
"I can't believe how easy this was. It's so quick. I've been wondering for years if it was him, wanting to know somehow why he did it, how he did it. Still, looking back at how he was around me as a kid, I can't believe he killed my father."
After a few confused seconds, Ron cottoned on and burst out laughing. Harry flipped him the two fingers.
"I'm not... opposed."
And then it hit him, Ron was a healer. Ron had been the first one on-site when the murder was called in.
"No, of course. It's still an honour to dance with you."
"A human being. Human beings tend to like pizza."
Malfoy did and Harry put it in the processing machine, waiting for it to do the reading.
"You..." Draco trailed off, not leaving room for Harry to respond.
"It's just that I was with someone already."
And this is where it got messy. Robards had always liked Harry, but overlooking a thing like using Ministry property for his own personal reasons was beyond what most would consider redeemable. How much did he know? He didn't usually work on weekends, someone had tipped him off.
"What's important to you?"
When Malfoy heard about the present promise, he dragged Harry and Teddy into a shop of his choice despite their protests. Harry tried to reason with him that Hermione wouldn't want a purse, or earrings, or a scarf and that she'd instead want a book or a nice set of pens. Malfoy had laughed and told him the whole point of gift-giving was to buy them something they wouldn't get for themselves.
"Just er... just orange, really."
"Nicola." She considered him for a moment before sticking out her hand for him to shake. It was covered in rings, one of them was a ruby-encrusted lion.
"Yeah."
Ron and Hermione appeared in the doorway and he gestured for them to stay there.
"If I quit," Malfoy continued, and this part he said slowly, clearly, those cold eyes locked on Harry, "your shop is closing—no ifs, ands or buts."
"Did you need something?"
"Mr. Potter." all the magic stopped and the Patronuses dissipated. When Harry turned around to face McGonagall guiltily, he couldn't help feeling like a child again.
"Alright. Well, just tell me the spells and I'll get started. I bet we can tackle this within the week, and then we can get started on—why are you looking at me like that?"
"You're a bloody Auror, calm down. What are they gonna do to us in muggle prison? Lock the doors? We'd be out in no time."
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Malfoy's lips twisted to the side, thoughtful. "I suppose that might be nice."
"Why is that?"
Malfoy sighed, but there was an amused light dancing in his eyes. "Astoria, I assume you recognise Harry Potter. That one there's Lee Jordan, and those two are Weasley's. Ginevra," he pointed, "and Ronald."
He looked better than the last time Harry'd seen him, but that had been just a month after George's funeral. His jacket was wrapped tightly around him, face covered in blue and gold paint.
He was sure that more was said, but Harry was so wrapped up in his internal thoughts that the next time he looked up, Malfoy was standing directly in front of him and Zabini, and the room was nearly empty, court session over.
"Mate..." Ron put his hand on Harry's shoulder and he knocked it off.
Harry shrugged and winked at Rosie who was sneaking chocolate from a bowl in the living room. Hugo would be fine, he was barely on solid foods anyway.
It still gave him chills, being here. The Hall of Prophecy was just a few turns away, but he forced himself not to think about it.
Harry panted against his neck and thrust again. It was so good, so hot, and he wondered how he ever could have thought he didn't want this, didn't want a single part of it. He wanted Malfoy's hands gripping his hips to hold him in place and he wanted the small whimpers falling through his lips. He wanted the gasps every time Harry sucked a kiss into his neck and he wanted the feeling of a cock against his own. He wanted skin, and sweat, and Draco.
"Budge up, I've barely any space."
"I'm going through something here."
"Retest. Turns out an earlier sample was contaminated."
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
"I'm fine. Yes. Yes. Yes. All right. Okay. Fine. Goodbye. All right. Yes, goodbye." Harry snorted and Malfoy flipped him the two fingers. "Fine. Yes. I love you too."
Harry shook his head. "None of them are who I'm looking for. They're all missing something. I don't think you'll find anyone in here."
He hadn't meant to ask that, but it had come out anyway.
The woman in front of him was a Gemini from Wales who loved shopping, reading, and dancing — in that order. Harry had already decided these things meant she probably wasn't his soul mate, but that wasn't going to stop him from talking to her.
Harry wondered why he'd said it. There hadn't been a lot of thought involved, except that he knew he didn't want this night with Malfoy to be over just yet. He wasn't ready to go through the stages of Malfoy warming up to him again, not now. He wanted this Malfoy—open and honest and talking to him like they could trust each other—for a little while longer.
"Can't. Barkley is on my other side."
"Harry," Malfoy said, and that got his attention, "it doesn't matter, I just want to know."
c) On special occasions
"I'm not obsessing over Malfoy."
Malfoy had paused mid-sweep of his hand, back still turned away from Harry.
Harry let out a sigh of relief.
Harry could have said yes, but that would have made it dangerous if the sample tested positive.
Malfoy didn't look like he believed him, but he didn't press the issue. He picked up Harry's hand and held it, tracing the veins and not looking into his eyes.
Malfoy stood still, not saying anything, and Harry realised that he was waiting for him to cast.
"Oh, you bastard!" came out muffled through it, followed by a lot more cursing.
"Fuck, Malfoy. I didn't know."
Now, believe
"I tell you, we'd be happy to see you over here. We don't need your OWL scores either, you'd have to take the English American Grading Levels Exam in order to qualify, but I'm sure you'd pass with flying colours."
"Well technically-"
Malfoy made a face at him.
I'm full of knowledge about
Malfoy let out a groan when Harry bit down on his neck and he thrust up. Harry could feel his cock through the layers of clothing and it wasn't enough. Harry worked down Malfoy's buttons and then threw off his own shirt. He couldn't stop to think, he'd done enough of that already.
I enjoy exercising by
They met outside the Ministry with 15 minutes to spare until the start of the function.
"Harry, mate," said Ron, "What's been going on?"
What was wrong? She was beautiful and she wanted him. Maybe he had to know a person better first to like kissing them.
"Pretty sure I do."
"According to what metric? The Bats have been in the lead for a good while now, Potter. Get with the program."
"How good are you at keeping appointments? Don't care about that. Do you like Quidditch? No way, it's bloody obvious I do. We should ask their favourite team instead." He crossed it out and scribbled Favourite Quidditch Team? Correct Answer (b) Appleby Arrows.
Alicia started a conversation with them quickly and Harry really wished he had some wine right about now. Was that what this nervous feeling was all about? Why didn't he like Alicia more when she was, quite literally, the perfect woman for him?
"I thought, 'why not get Malfoy the tea he drank practically every morning at Hogwarts,' actually. But next time I'll save the three quid and bring you one of the stale Canary Creams we've got in the back."
my love will laugh with me before the morning comes
Jerome laughed loudly and Malfoy shoved him out of his chair. "Bastard."
"Ah, none of that." Harry took the pillow Ron was using to shield himself from the light and tossed it on the ground.
In the middle of figuring out if there was a less morally dubious way to go about this, he got a text from Malfoy.
"I just can't believe you'd doom yourself to a lifetime of unhappiness."
Perfect, still before ten. The shop didn't open until noon on weekdays, but Harry had asked her to come in a little early so she'd be there to show them around. In all honesty, he hadn't visited in months, so he wasn't sure where most things were or how to answer any questions Malfoy might come up with.
Draco let out a defeated sigh and Harry pulled him on top of him and pressed a kiss to the back of his neck.
Harry turned to Draco. "I've figured out the identity of your father's killer."
"Huh?"
"Hello. At work," Malfoy said to whoever was on the other side. Harry could partially make out the person's voice and they were definitely talking louder than necessary.
"Your bloody logic versus my intuition. Wanna make it a bet?"
"Attraction! Merlin, Mione said you'd be oblivious but I thought-"
Harry looked around the pub, seeing Ginny and Lee still sitting at the bar, but long since finished with their meal. Ron and Astoria were on a sofa with some of her friends, laughing loudly about something or other.
His dress robes, which were dark green with gold buttons up the front and adorning his sleeves, would have made it difficult to travel by Floo, so he opted to Apparate instead. He arrived at the designated Apparition place at the same time as a woman he didn't recognise. She had long blonde hair and was wearing a dress that looked like starlight. It sparkled with every step she took and made her blue eyes shine. Harry had never seen anyone so beautiful. She looked to be about his age, definitely fit, and there was no other reason to think it, but he wondered if he was looking at his future wife.
"Er... so would you like that firewhiskey or... I could also make tea if you'd rather."
"Blood Malediction."
Though the original difficulty had been in getting Patricia to agree to see them, it turned out that collecting DNA from her would be all the harder after she agreed to meet them in her office for fifteen minutes.
"The questionnaire."
Harry patted him on the shoulder. "Good man."
Malfoy moved on to examine Harry's CD collection.
Harry just stood there, glaring, not sure why all of the sudden it felt like he was being reprimanded by a professor or something.
The table seated twelve and they sat down in two of the four empty seats left. It was hard to be heard over the music, but Alicia's hand on his arm was a comforting presence. Ron sat across the table from him and gave him a brief smile as he poured Hermione some wine. Neville sat next to them along with Luna who was chatting to the most attractive person Harry had ever seen. Unlike Alicia's more complex dress, this person was wearing plain robes in a deep purple. It took Harry a minute to realise the person in the robes was Malfoy.
"Oh, that's one of Barkley's."
Harry took the swab out of his pocket and ran it around the rim of the glass. Hopefully, that would be sufficient.
"What do we need?" Malfoy finally asked. "To build a strong case?"
After it was over, more women came up to him and begged him for a dance. He hid in the corner where he wouldn't be pounced upon as soon as he could.
Malfoy's face twisted and he looked away from Harry's face.  "I..." he hesitated. "I'm not so sure, anymore."
"We could still keep it running."
"Because you're the boy hero who sees the best in everybody and argued me a reduced sentence for house arrest. Anyone would believe it."
• • •
"Must be where I picked it up from."
He had taken on the look he always got when the subject of art came up. "And the advertisements, Fred and George always had the coolest advertisements."
"She still kind of does."
"Not my fault you're skinny enough to get tackled by a year-old crup."
"Testing the genetics of purebloods who have reformed their values," Harry said at the same time Draco said, "questions about people who've opinions on blood purity have changed since the war."
Ginny laughed and Malfoy leaned past Jerome to talk to her. "Alright there, Ginevra?"
They looked around and Teddy examined a row of snow globes and then an array of condoms that said stuff like, "no glove, no love," and "remember the election with your next erection," which Harry lead him away from.
"But the TV you have no problem with?"
So he did, and then he got dressed and took the floo to Wheezes.
The man beneath him immediately stiffened and Harry grimaced. He'd knocked the guy to the ground, surely he wouldn't still get preferential treatment. A crowd had gathered and were taking pictures. This would be in tomorrow morning's Prophet no doubt.
"Uh no, your ring tipped me off. It's cool."
"Er... not tonight, thanks."
"So it's not just their eccentric interior decorating skills?"
"When I was ten, my father took down to the ministry to show me his work and I threw a fit. I didn't want to be there, I wanted to be home and less bored and surrounded by sweets. He reprimanded me, of course, but when we got home my mother gave him the silent treatment for a week. She claimed that telling me off in public was unnecessarily cruel. If you ask me, it was the path of least resistance. Did you ever deal with someone telling you off in public?"
The buzzer rang again and Harry stood. He wasn't sure if he should wait for her number after what happened last time or if he should just move on.
So, there’s all you need to know about this morning’s incident. Now, where was I? Oh, yes.
“Aren’t you going to ask why I’m out after hours?” Ron asked.
“Alright, Potter, what…”
“Slick what was pulled this morning, yeah?” Blaise asked, “Potter coming in with a Slytherin robe.”
Draco shook his head, placing one of his arms above Harry's head, resting his hand on the wall behind him. The other made it's way to the red sweater Harry had chosen to wear, running his nimble ringers up the smaller man's chest and taking in the way his breath caught in his throat.
Draco mumbled his disapproval under his breath but let Harry move him how he wanted nonetheless. He seemed to realize that he was spanked again because he rushed out a small, “six.”
Draco went to argue, but he knew it was true. "It meant nothing."
Malfoy stood up after a moment, giving Harry a sharp look as he tugged his own pants down, low enough to have his cock spring free. He grabbed Harry's waist then, gripping it tightly and spinning him around.
Draco placed his fingers under Harry’s chin, bringing him away from his chest then sliding one hand down. He pinched one of Harry’s nipples between his fingers, watching with delight as Harry’s mouth hung open in an ‘o’ shape.
“You’re the one who wanted to try this in the first place,” Harry reminded as he slipped into bed beside the blonde, “so I think that qualifies you as one too.”
Draco nodded, not needing to be told anything else as he leaned forward and took Harry’s now fully hard cock into his mouth. He let out a moan around him as Ron pushed his first finger into him, wasting no time in pumping it in and out of him.
Draco took a minute then, seemingly turning a shade darker, “just helping a friend, s’all.”
And yes, maybe they aren’t, but that doesn’t mean his reasoning skills have improved all that much. Ron pulls away from his thoughts when Hermione gives a loud sigh, wandering eyes landing on her red-head best friend and giving him a sympathetic look. They communicate the same message that they have for the past three dinners, “there he goes again…”
He kissed behind Draco’s ear, whispering in it, “I’m going to ruin you,”
Draco grabbed Harry by his shirt sleeve, pushing him to sit on the bed as he straddled his thighs. Draco gave Harry a comforting smile as he leaned in and kissed him.
“Oh, alright,” Harry gave in, reaching underneath Draco and untying him, “but only because you’ve been so good.”
Harry nodded, opening his eyes slowly as he vaguely registered the way Draco's fingers were starting to circle his sensitive buds. He moaned lightly as one was flicked, hips jerking forward involuntarily. Draco tsked.
Ron looked at him, nodding slowly before he was up and pushing Harry back onto the bed, Draco nearly being squished.
He could see the faint blush on Draco’s cheeks and he savored it, as it was not often that Draco Malfoy blushed. In fact, he wasn’t sure that Draco Malfoy had ever blushed in his entire life. If he had, Harry had never seen it.
Ron took in the sight, not giving his mind enough time to make him too nervous to lower his head and take Harry fully into his mouth.
“What are you doing in here?” Harry asked, looking at Draco before his eyes landed on the red-headed boy, “Ron?”
Today was Friday. Harry had managed to avoid Draco for a good part of the day. That only changed when Fred and George insisted he come to the common room to join all the boys in a few good games. After a few games of truth or dare with just the Gryffindors, a few Slytherins decided to join, and of course, Draco had his sights set on Harry. That would be how Harry embarrassed himself in front of everyone by giving Ron a lap dance.
Once he was relaxed enough underneath him, Draco was pushing Harry back onto his bed and sliding down his body. He slid his hands under Harry’s shirt, taking it off of him before moving to his jeans and unbuttoning them.
“I would, but you dragged me into an empty room, so I assume you’re going to tell me.”
Harry looked dazed already, and in an odd sort of way, Draco found it cute. He leaned down to kiss Harry as Ron spit onto his fingers, coating them thoroughly before placing one at Harry’s entrance.
"Your turn."
Draco nodded.
“Harry came just from me saying we would gangbang him.”
Ron sighed but thought about it. Harry was his best friend, and if it helped to keep him from being distant and he wanted it, who was he to deny him.
It went like this for a while; Harry speeding up and slowing down as Draco let his emotions out into the pillow. Finally, Harry pulled out, only the flip Draco onto his back, making sure his binds flipped along with him to keep him in place.
“Fuck!” Draco practically shouted, “fuck, want your cock, please!”
“No rules. Just the first to finish wins, the prize is the same as yesterdays.”
“Fuck, Ron, where did you learn to do that?” Draco asked from the side, his own cock heavy as he palmed it slowly.
To be fair (Ron would argue), this was the only chance he had at getting the other man alone. He knew he was up, supposed to be monitoring the halls and making sure no one was out after hours. He was doing just that when Ron grabbed him and pulled him into an empty classroom, closing the door gently before revealing himself from beneath the cloak.
“You leave for a year and then you show up on my doorstep at two in the morning expecting a warm welcome? Well, you can go fuck yourself.”
He ran his hand back down, stopping once he got to where the sweater met his pants and slipping his hand under it. Harry tensed under the dominant man's touch, feeling the way the pads of his fingers ran over the thin outline of his stomach muscles.
“What? Why?” Harry asked, stuttering as Draco’s clothed bum came in continuous contact with his clothed crotch.
Draco shuddered, not only his cock being worked but now his balls as well, as Harry had snaked a hand underneath to roll them in his palm. He was getting close, could feel the familiar coil of heat in the pit of his stomach.
"D-Draco, close, please,"
Draco hesitated as he watched the large, brown double doors reveal themselves from the secret slot in the stone walls. He reached out a pale hand and pushed on one of them, wincing as it groaned in opening and letting out a breath of relief when no one came into sight. He found himself walking through the doors despite never having fully decided that he would.
Okay, maybe not reading all of his mind, but some of it.
Yes, he definitely could kill Draco.
“What was that?” Harry asked though he heard it loud and clear this time, “was that a whimper I just heard?”
Harry couldn't possibly understand what Draco was getting at, but whatever got him out of there fast was what he would go with.
“Please,” Draco tried, but Harry cut him off as he sped up once again.
It had been a horrid week for Harry Potter. He had spent it studying for his potions class and never quite getting the reactions he wanted and needed, trying to convince Ron to tell Hermione all the things he had been blabbering about, and last but certainly not least, he had been trying to avoid a certain grey-eyed Slytherin.
Draco only smiled, whispering that he’d be right back with a washcloth.
“No.”
“Potter,” Draco groaned in annoyance, “let me speak, would you?”
“I said I’d get you in there next time, have the two of us take our turn with him, you know, have our way.”
He popped open the cap, coating Harry’s entrance as well as his fingers before he rubbed one against his hole. Harry inhaled a deep breath, not speaking as Draco pushed his finger into the knuckle. Draco let him adjust before adding another slowly and then scissoring them.
A pout came across the man's lips, “are you not happy to see me?”
“Alright, on the count of three,” Draco announced, “One, Two…”
“No,” Ron dismissed him, “if you’re going to find out for sure, it needs to be in front of someone. That way, he can’t deny it.”
“Remember your safe word?” Harry asked as he placed a hand on the back of Draco’s head and stroked his hair.
The smugness in his voice made Malfoy stand up straighter, “name it, Potter.”
Draco pouted but did as told, switching his robe out with Harry. Harry thanked him quickly as students started to shuffle around in the dining hall. He figured it was almost time for first class. He turned to Draco once again, giving him a kiss on the cheek and the promise to see him later in class before he had to scurry off.
Draco slumped against the wall once Harry was out of sight, taking a breath.
You know how I mentioned that it took two and a half hours for Draco to make Harry mad? Well, actually, try half an hour. It started when Harry woke up later than Draco, which he learned quickly to never ever do. But he had, and now that it was already 8:10 in the morning, he was pushed to get dressed and get to the great hall for his already-cold breakfast. So, frantically, he threw on his clothes and house robe. He didn’t bother looking in the mirror before rushing out the door, messing with his hair the whole way down the long corridors.
Harry wasn’t wearing anything underneath, and both the other boys couldn’t help but stare as his now-hard cock slapped against his stomach.
“Gonna give you my cock now, love,” Draco said, maybe a warning more than anything.
Harry may have woken up on the wrong side of the robe, but he had forgiven and forgotten by the time he got to potions. All he wanted now was to get this class over with and be done for the day. That want only grew stronger as he heard a familiar giggle come from in front of him.
Harry nodded, words stuck in his throat. He was sure that if he opened his eyes he would see himself staring down at his own body, wondering when he’d be able to come back down.
Harry wiped his mouth as he pulled back, being satisfied that Draco was wet enough to prep. He whispered out once again, two of his fingers being coated in lube as he now rubbed them over Draco’s tight ring of muscle. He reveled in the whine Draco let out as he began to push one finger into him.
“Yes, I love sleeping in until I wake up ten minutes late, just to rush to get dressed and later find out that someone switched out my robe.”
Harry nodded, putting a finger under Draco’s chin and lifting his head so he could kiss him. “You were amazing. Didn’t quite see you as the daddy kink type, but I don’t mind. I’m sure I’ll get used to it quite quickly.”
He let his head fall back onto Potter’s shoulder, no longer being able to hold back his noises. He was, however, able to keep his hips still. He fought to not cant them up into the warm fist that enveloped him and made good work on getting him off.
Harry’s plan went out the window as he started to feel himself grow in his pants. His thoughts were now only focused on one thing as he slowly and quietly undressed: Draco. Once he was fully nude he stepped over to Draco, quickly eyeing the way he was laying: on his stomach with one leg hitched up higher than the other.
Harry nodded, leaning into Draco’s touch and scooting down to push into Draco’s cock, “want you, please, Draco”
With that, Draco was gone. Now that he was into the empty halls he could breath normally. Why had he told Potter he’d come back if there was no game to lure him in?
“How could we not?” Ron asked, stroking a hand down Draco’s side and sharing a look with Harry.
“You were never really mine.”
Draco could see why Harry wanted to prep him. As he looked down at Harry’s cock, his eyes nearly rolled back into his head. Harry was big, and he was sure Harry would make good on wrecking him.
Harry was gentle as he let Draco lay on his chest. He stroked his hair, looking down at him as Draco looked up.
“I’m coming!” Harry shouted, “I swear if that’s you, Ron, I’m going to shove my foot so far up your--,” Harry was swinging the door open before he even finished his threat, his eyes stopping on the figure in front of him and air leaving his lungs as the figure lifted its head to meet his eyes.
“For example, if we both fire off a spell and a snake comes from mine and a rat comes from yours, I would win.”
“Do you want me to hurt you? I will.”
“Well, what helps you relax when you’re stressed?”
He had done a pretty good job at the latter, eating rather quickly in the dining hall, not sparing time for eye-contact and invitations to bicker. He was quite proud of himself for managing to go a full three days with no mouth from the mouthiest wizard that he knew of. It was almost a full four days that he was going to pride himself on... Almost.
It was after practice that he found himself in the locker room once again. Draco was twisting a towel in the air, aiming at Oliver who looked terrified as he scurried away. Draco let the towel unravel as he snickered to himself.
“Hot?!” Draco said, incredulously, “mate, it made him cum.”
To both of their surprise, Draco moaned. It was quite loud and shameless, and he couldn’t bring himself to care as he wrapped his arms around Potter’s neck in an attempt to bring him closer. He did, their body’s pressed fully against one another now as they explored each other’s mouths.
- - -
The pout deepened into a frown, but it was nothing he didn’t deserve. Harry crossed his arms.
“You’ll only be down the hall,” Draco reasoned boredly, watching her knit her eyebrows together as she seemed to think it over, “you’ll smell the smoke if we attempt to burn the school down.”
Well, as full as he could. What he couldn’t fit he covered with his hand.
“Losing you?” Harry repeated, “it was always something I waited on.”
A year seems like a long time. It is when you spend over half of it grieving someone you never even got to say goodbye to. Perhaps he should have been thankful that he didn’t get to say goodbye. Goodbyes are never easy either. He’d never know which would be easier, he had no choice in the matter.
“Go on then,” Ron prompted, “cum for me, and then I’m going to fill you up so deep you’ll feel me inside you for days. Is that what you want, love?”
He blushed pink as he scurried away from them, Ron returning his stare back to the blonde haired boy. This time it was a stare of utter disbelief.
Harry smiled softly, pulling him in for one more kiss. “I think I might fancy you.”
“Well, I hope you decide to keep me.”
Draco dropped his eyes and shook his head, his cheeks heating up as he felt the bed dip down behind him. He didn’t need to look back to know that Ron had rid himself of his clothes before getting behind him. It was almost funny, the way he knew the two as he did.
With that, Draco was kissing him again. Harry was letting him, surprisingly. Perhaps it’s because he thought he was dreaming, or it could be that he messed up a potion earlier and inhaled something that made him insane. Either way, he was letting Draco’s arms snake around his neck and his tongue push into his mouth.
“Only good boys get to cum, you know.” Harry said as if it was something Draco had been taught when growing up, “and good boys always ask permission. You’re mine, pet. If you want to cum, you’re going to have to ask nicely.”
“Up for another game?” Harry asked, “Or did yesterday do you in?”
Draco bit his lip, tweaking both the -now- perky and hard buds underneath his fingers and nodding.
"Want me to what? I'm not sure what you're asking for." Draco said, innocently.
Harry blushed at that, turning to hide his face in Draco’s chest as Ron added his second one.
Draco could hear Potter’s tone change, and a shiver ran through him as he obeyed. He walked over to Harry, who instructed him to turn his back to him and then straddle him. He followed his orders and tensed when Harry placed a hand on each of his spread thighs.
Draco let his wand fall into his hand and gave Harry a pointed look, to which Harry just chuckled and cast a spell. Draco watched as one of the needles went up into a puff of pink smoke, a vial of amortentia left in its place.
“Because you’re stressed and you’ve been distant lately. You need something to help you relax.”
“Yes?” He huffed, his fork clunking noisily on his plate as he set it down once again.
“I won’t be calling you Harry,”
Harry slowed down only a tad as he leaned forward, taking one of Draco’s nipples between his pointer and forefinger and rolling the bud gently, “what’s that, love?”
Draco nodded slowly, “you wanted to lose me?”
He stopped only when a large hand was placed in between his shoulder blades, catching him off guard enough to get his hands from Harry’s thighs to behind his back. He struggled only a bit as he was tied with Harry’s tie, Ron had found it just in time. Harry had a strict no-touching policy when he was pissed off.
He was met with silence, he took a deep breath and looked into the man’s eyes.
“We’re going to fuck you. The both of us this time.”
He built up a pace, changing his angle slightly so that he was hitting his prostate every time he lowered himself.
“Ah, quiet,” Harry reminded, stroking a hand over Draco’s cheek and smiling as he leaned into the touch, “you know what happens when you’re bad. Have you ever not been tied when you were bad?”
“Same time tomorrow, Room of Requirement,” Harry said, but left room for Draco to disagree.
“Right on time,” Harry commented, “punctual indeed, Malfoy.”
“I can feel how deep I am inside you, does it feel good? You’re being so good for me.”
Ron nodded in agreement as he gave Draco another finger, scissoring them easily as Draco gave no restriction. He didn’t bother with a third, knowing Draco liked the stretch. He did take extra time with the fingers he did have in him, getting harder with every movement he gave the boy.
“I hate you too, Malfoy.”
“I’m going to fucking wreck you, and you’re going to take it,” Harry said as he pulled out to the tip, “you’re going to be my little fuck toy for as long as I want tonight.”
“Let’s play a game,” Draco rushed out, continuing when Harry didn’t shut him down right away, “it’s a simple game, really, it’s called wand roulette.”
“You think so? You should see me without it,” Draco winked, giggling when Blaise laughed as well.
“Alright, very funny Potter, let me go.”
“Excuse me,” Draco said as he watched Harry get dressed, “mind letting me go?”
Harry seemed to understand him as he replied instantly, “get up and strip, then lay back down on your stomach. No words and no noises, do you understand?”
His gaze then fell on Draco who was already looking at him in what he would proudly call astonishment. He bit back a smirk as he slid his wand safely up into his sleeve.
He was nervous. Of course he was. Draco could certainly kill him if he wanted to, he had no doubt about that. With that in mind, he stepped towards the blonde anyway.
Harry was already moaning, having wanted this for so long but not realizing it until just now. He squirmed to get out of his jeans, Ron releasing his lips and moving down his body to help.
Ron and Draco gave him a confused look, to which he responded in a serious tone (it was really a joke to them, but if Draco pulls another stunt that might change).
Once he had done that he came back to Harry and sat on his lap. Harry looked up at him, his hands finding their place on his waist before one made its way to the back of Draco’s head. He pulled Draco down into a kiss, deepening it before he flipped them.
“Oh, so you weren’t going to try and sabotage me again tomorrow morning?”
“A bit late to be reading” Draco quipped, startling Harry and making him almost turn his chair over with how fast he got up.
Harry groaned but settled back down, “you tell me.”
“Wait,” Harry interrupted suddenly, obviously annoying Draco but asking anyway, “what does the winner get?”
“You can’t even say it, can you?”
"Potter."
Draco couldn’t bring himself to stop Harry. He also would never admit that maybe he didn’t mind the affection. Once he was sure he could hold steady he got up and got dressed, feeling eyes on him the entire time but not meeting them even once.
He took a minute to catch his breath before he pulled out of Draco and let go of his jaw. He got off of him and turned to throw his underwear back on when he heard a throat being cleared.
It was more for Draco than himself, as Draco loved to touch him any chance he got. Of course now that his hands were tied is when he had to break Harry’s earlier rule of no noises. The whine that left his lips would have been heart-breaking if Harry wasn’t doing it to punish him.
"And you will," He answered, removing his other hand from the wall and now placing them both on the Gryffindor's hips, "I just want to play a little game first."
Harry had a plan.
Draco's dirty talk alone could have him cumming right then, but he obeyed and lifted his head. He locked eyes with Draco's silver ones. He wanted nothing more than to wipe the smirk off Malfoy's face, but he was more concerned with getting his release at the moment.
"Why?" he squeaks.
"How is he?" I ask Hermione when I return back to the dorm.
Harry moved to stand in front of Draco, to shield him from any spell Ginny could send. Hermione only watched the whole scene unfolding in front of her, knowing it wasn’t her place to meddle in this.
Draco didn’t push any particular one forward, leaving Harry free reign of this part of his mind, so Harry set up to prodding around and discovering on his own.
"Absolutely. Just the purification ritual needs to be performed by three people besides Draco."
"Does this feel like I don’t want you?"
"But Harry…" Draco whined and Harry resolutely shook his head. But Draco pushed his hand into Harry’s pants and wrapped his long fingers around his shaft. "You’re so warm and hard. Let me at least touch you. I also want to make you feel good."
"Let me tell you he is not hiding garlic there to be protected from vampires. I think it’s hiding smell of decomposition." I explain and they stare at me. "Some of my housemates have interesting talents, like being able to feel Dark Magic, close to Quirrell they get nauseous to the point of fainting. It’s quite telling."
"Oh, young Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Potter, I was of course expecting both of you," the old man says, his eyes shining in his pale face.
This time, only one black silken scarf appeared, covering his eyes and securing itself at the back of Draco’s head. The blond’s breathing got a little agitated but Harry’s hand cupping his face was grounding him.
"But Harry, honestly, why are all the windows broken? I wouldn’t have barged in with Ginny like that if I didn’t think you were under attack." Hermione frowned.
"Fuck destiny, indeed." Harry agreed.
"Please, try for me, Draco. Can you do it for me?" Harry asked and let his emerald green eyes bore into Draco’s silver ones.
"You can clearly see that Dumbledore let Draco disarm him on purpose, relaxing the hold of his wand, wanting to seem as unthreatening as possible because of the distress his student was in. Also, it’s obvious that Draco didn’t approach Dumbledore because of his own will but because him and his family were threatened by Lord Voldemort. And the most important part is, Draco did disarm Dumbledore but he lowered his wand after." Hermione explained and many of the Wizengamot members nodded.
"In the first life I remember living, we were friends, the best friends. I would have done anything for you." Harry said smiling. "We were knights, using our magic to protect the country, you were from good family, rumour had it that even the princess took a fancy to you."
"What do you mean?" Harry asked, concerned.
Before me and Harry can introduce ourselves, Ron Weasley comes in and points at the seat next to Harry.
Draco woke up for a few minutes at time, enough to go to bathroom and drink and eat a little bit but always falling asleep quickly after. Harry often sat next to him, stroking his soft hair and watching him sleep for a while or reading a book.
"See you in the past." I say and kiss her cheek. Then I click the button on the side of the golden pocket watch and the world starts spinning.
"Yes, the potion instructions are complete!" she said and sat down. "Snape finished quite some time ago, it’s written in such a detail that I don’t worry at all that I can brew it without any mistake."
"You are doing so well, it’s already almost dark. Now let me cover your eyes. " Harry said and casted another incarcerous.
"It might not be possible... but thank you, Harry." Said Draco quietly and almost smiled.
"Other then our little meeting in the Room of Hidden things, I was just trying to blend into the background during the battle, so no, I didn’t get hurt, And if I did how is it even any of your business? " Draco snapped.
On the first of September, my mother dresses in a knee long elegant light grey dress that passes as something muggle and my father puts glamour on his hair, to look like muggle would.  Now his hair is only ten centimetres long and flying around and he looks very young and quite dashing. Mother seems to enjoy his look rather lot and keeps touching his hair. He is also wearing a muggle suite, looking like a business man instead of wizard. He even got us an enchanted muggle car so that we wouldn’t freak out the muggles too much when we come pick Harry up. It’s sleek black audi with comfortable leather seats and as far as muggle cars go, I think it’s rather nice choice. My father has hands on the steering wheel but the car drives itself. It can also become invisible, fly and he is secretly very fond of it. It certainly is much more comfortable way of transportation then broom, floo or portkey.
"Okay. Then here is what we will do. I will tie you up and cover your eyes. When the time is up, I will undo the restraints." Harry said and expected refusal or hesitation on Draco’s side but the blond just held Harry tighter and nodded.
"But you do, Draco."
Mrs. Weasley was very angry at Ron as she levitated him to bed to sleep off the hex. She assured Harry that no matter what her son says, both him and Hermione are always welcomed in the Burrow and asked Harry to rely her apology on behalf of Ron to both Draco and Hermione.
"Let me see your thoughts, your memories. Let me in." Harry was watching Draco with concern in his eyes. He needed to know, needed to be sure this is alright.
"Okay, but why should I know? It’s your past lives, isn’t it?"
"Thank you, Draco." Harry says and blushes adorably.
"Thanks, Harry. Oh Merlin, I was planning to stay with them until the school starts again. But now I can’t. And all my things are at their house."
Hermione rolled up Michael’s sleeve and fixed his arm to the table with sticking charm and Draco did the same with his, in a way that their fingertips were touching.
"I’m so sorry Draco, I’m sorry about everything that happened to you. I wish I knew before, we could have hid you."
Draco dropped to his knees in front of Harry. He untied Harry’s shoes and removed them, then he took off Harry’s socks. He pulled one of Harry’s feet into his lap and started massaging it gently.
"Oh, he didn’t hit me. He didn’t do that since he saw Hagrid hex Dudley, he is afraid I might do something similar to him."
"Anyone sitting there?"
Draco moved closer to Harry, just a few centimetres closer and their foreheads would be touching, he was running his thumb over the neck of Harry’s hand holding his, waiting for him to continue. He didn’t feel sad about hearing about this, he didn’t really feel connected to this past life that Harry was talking about but he didn’t like seeing Harry upset, especially when it was because of him.
Harry rolled his eyes, taking Draco’s chin into his hand, “what am I going to do with you?”
Draco barely met Harry’s eyes as he quickly threw on his t-shirt. He tried to avoid him as he walked past, but Harry grabbed his arm.
He pulled away just enough to see Harry’s face as he sped up.
Harry pouted before turning into Ron’s side and wrapping an arm around his pale waist. Ron gave Draco a sympathetic look as he wrapped himself up in the spent boy.
Harry and Ron shared a look as he thought about it. How and where could he get the chance to touch Draco? Draco would surely pummel him if he even tried. As if reading his mind, Ron piped up.
“You’ve been inside me twice now and you still need permission to kiss me?” Draco teased “pathetic, Weasley, really.”
This was going to be a long night.
"Alright, Potter, good luck," Draco said, both hands now sliding up and under the sweater, making Harry's skin prickle at the soft touch.
Ron placed his lips on Harry’s once again as he came inside him. He pulled out gently as he began to get soft, but his lips never left Harry’s until they were both out of breath.
The woman looked up and inhaled sharply. "Draco."
Malfoy looked like he was holding back an entire barrage of insults, which was actually quite entertaining, as much as Harry was starting to feel the same way. His ears had gone all red at the top and he was working his jaw back and forth as he breathed out heavily through his nose.
c) Flooing
"Let's go for a drive," he said, and Harry was so taken aback that he agreed without thinking.
"Pygmy puff, you like? I've named him Elton John. Say hi, Elton," she cooed, wiggling her finger at it.
Harry couldn't let this get taken from them too. It felt like there was too much happening all at once.
"Ministry inspector. Was that what you wanted?"
The cab driver wasn't listening.
Afraid of bein' hurrrrrt
Ron picked a bit of the pile up and flipped through some before turning one picture to face Harry.
"How do you mean?"
He deflated, glaring at the back of the woman's head.
How Hot Can You Get Harry? asked the one that changed colour when you put tea inside and had a large picture of his winking face on the front. Tea Time With the Trio, said the one beside it with caricatures of him, Ron, and Hermione sipping from fancy porcelain while a caricature of Voldemort died dramatically in the background. Don't talk to me until I've had my daily dose of Weasley, said another that had a moving drawing Ginny, Bill, and Charlie posing shirtless.
He hummed lightly. "You've got decent taste."
"Och! That's what I get for complimenting you, is it? You're worse than me mam."
Ron snorted through a mouth full of bacon. "Please, just you being there was enough to rake in everything you'll need to keep it up and running for the next decade, I promise you."
Back at the lab, Harry opened two beers and passed one to Malfoy.
"A questionnaire! I can't believe we didn't think of it before. A scientific way to filter out the Potter fangirls, the crazies, the crup haters-"
In the end, after a lot more talking, they agreed on Harry following the classic Potter method. He'd pretend it never happened.
When everything was set up to his liking, Malfoy asked if they had to eat right away. This was weird considering he was the one who'd been bloody starving earlier. Harry told him they didn't have to worry about it getting cold since it already was and asked why he wanted to wait.
"Will you get fired if you drop my case?"
Finally, when Malfoy took a step back and muttered, "No, that can't be right," Harry snapped.
"To me, yeah."
"Malfoy," he replied gruffly. "Didn't know you were coming in today."
"She barely talks to anyone now. Even me."
"That's beside the point."
"It's a nice view."
• • •
Harry picked at a hole in his jeans. "So you really would hate it if I was gay? If I liked Malfoy?"
He pulled out his mobile and swore when he remembered that she wouldn't have a muggle appliance in her wizarding company. He clicked on Draco's contact and texted, 'Leave now.'
"Well, this takes me back."
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
"Put that out, Darling." He blew his smoke behind him and frowned at Narcissa. Harry waved goodbye as he left. Draco did not wave back. That was okay, there was still more left to his plan.
Harry looked over the results of the handkerchief first. It wasn't a genetic match to the killer. There were enough ties to prove the pureblood theory, but not enough for them to be father and daughter. Harry couldn't find it in himself to think Mrs. Fawley had done it either. The result came back, she hadn't. No match.
"I wonder how we'll decide which places to help," Hermione said.
"Yeah, I might just."
Harry didn't know what to say, so he was quiet for a long while until Malfoy said, "What's this?" gesturing to the parchment spread out everywhere with a list of things to do for the shop.
"What's wrong with that?"
Harry wasn't sure what that meant exactly. "So why don't you?"
"I've been working with Draco these past few months on a project. I feel like your input might be more important than he believes."
Malfoy took a tentative sip and frowned, presumably because he realised it wasn't poisoned. "When'd you get those?"
They got back home and Teddy flooed to Hogwarts where McGonagall was waiting for him. Harry looked around his empty flat. It felt strangely cold without Teddy and Draco.
"I have some information."
a) London
c) Fall in love
"Nope, not paying it."
He met Ron outside the Burrow on Sunday and pulled him somewhere quiet. They ended up only a few meters from the house, but where no one would stumble upon them accidentally.
"I'm not going to keep my sleeves rolled down for you."
"I still can't believe you root for Puddle U."
They'd developed a routine of sorts, the three of them, over the past few months. Harry would wake up from nightmares sometime around 4 am, start the training exercises that Robards had assigned to him so he could register as an Auror in the Spring, talk to Hermione in Australia while it was still early enough for her to be awake, and then make breakfast for Ron and Ginny. It was simple, easy. Which is why, when Ron read Harry the letter he'd gotten from the Ministry, his heart plummeted to the cellar, stopping to keep Kreacher company for a while as he did whatever the fuck he did down there.
Hermione broke out into giggles. "That's the best part."
"Abstergeo," he pronounced cautiously, enunciating the ster very carefully, the way Hermione had shown him, and swirling his wand in a tight circle.
And sure, it had been on the decline even if you considered the effects of the war, but that was to be expected. George's heart hadn't really been in it anymore. No one's had.
Harry's brain basically short-circuited at that and he got the caramel. Kiss anyone, share their ice cream. It wasn't referring to someone specific, but was it somehow referencing the person he was sharing ice cream with right now, walking through New York City?
"Your mother?"
Harry stared at him a moment, just barely managing to take all that in. "You listen to The Weird Sisters?"
"Yeah"
"How am I supposed to do that if you're distracting me?"
"But it won't help you!"
"Not kidding."
Harry didn't know. He thought about him and his parents, who he loved but had never truly met. He thought about Sirius and his mum and dad, who Sirius had claimed to hate but maybe hadn't. He thought about Hermione, who had erased her parents' memories for their own safety and the Weasley's, who had taken him in as their son.
Harry stared at him for a moment, baffled.
Instead of answering, Harry held out the bouquet of flowers for Narcissa and she took them. He'd put a cut of Pieris japonica in there too and when she saw it she breathed in sharply and brushed her finger against it. She smiled at him for the first time.
"Look. I'm working, okay. I'll think about it." He grabbed Harry's arm and pulled a pen out of his pocket, writing a series of numbers on his skin. "Call me."
"The charity will suffer because of this!"
Mostly he just wanted Malfoy back, still sitting on the couch next to him, resuming that moment where Harry had almost felt like they might be about to kiss. It would be a long night.
"Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to wake you."
Malfoy blinked at him, startled. "What?"
"Thanks, I guess." He hadn't meant to hurt Alicia so badly, but it had all just felt wrong. She had been perfect, and it had felt wrong. What did that say about him? Maybe he was just looking for any excuse not to let himself be happy. He'd read about people doing that.
"Whatever, it isn't bloody important. I'm not gay."
"I thought maybe it'd give you some perspective."
"Thanks, not hungry."
"Er..." Harry looked at Malfoy, who was busying himself with cleaning the mess off the table and stacking their glasses, not meeting his eyes. "Why don't you go on ahead?"
"I thought you deserved a warning. Thought he did too."
I see a red door and I want it painted black
"Sorry, I'm not very good at this."
Lorelai laughed with him and took a sip of her drink. "Would it be all right if I wanted to know everything about you? Seeing as I'm not a crowd."
"It's the principle of it."
"I told you, I'm not gay."
"Right." He looked over Draco's shoulder to see if Narcissa was anywhere in sight.
"It's not your fault, Verity. But fuck," he said again.
Harry looked around the room frantically for the parchment he'd most recently worked on.
"That's all I can ask."
I own
Fuck. Hermione had made him try speed dating a few times before and it had always ended badly. Once with a cup of punch in his face, and multiple times with rioting by witches he just couldn't connect with.
They ended up getting bagels, danishes, and all kinds of other pastries at a corner shop a street away. He and Malfoy both ordered coffee which tasted strange and Teddy let Harry take a picture of him with Times Square in the background when they were done. When Harry told Malfoy he had something in his teeth before he got a shot of the two of them, he only rolled his eyes and got rid of it instead of breaking down in tears. It was, all in all, a very fun morning.
"It's a muggle term, you haven't heard it?" Zabini did not look impressed. "I thought you grew up with muggles."
He looked between the two of them, stunned that he hadn't considered their talents in this area before. Neville and Seamus were brilliant at causing [].
At first, it seemed like nothing had happened, but then he peered at the ground more closely and noticed a blank spot about the size of a galleon.
"Great!" He hadn't meant to sound so enthused. "Well, we usually head to The Leaky Cauldron if—"
When he caught Harry staring, his voice abruptly cut out in the middle of the word, eyes flashing.
"What?"
"Potter, I think I owe you a thank you. This is really a huge thing to do for me, it's been eating me and my mother up for years now. Do you think you could meet me for coffee tomorrow at that place about a block from the ministry? Cuppa Joe? Maybe around 2."
"Have fun?" he asked.
"I'll stop you there," Malfoy said and Teddy snorted a bit. "There's no way I'm going to watch a bunch of ruddy Americans run around making fools of themselves."
Harry looked back and forth between the two of them. Their glares were almost identical until Daphne stiffly nodded. She lead them out of the parlour and down a long hallway, filled with moving portraits. At the very end was a door, but they didn't go in that one, they moved to stand in front of the one next to it.
Harry went in to grab the bottle and saw the time on his grandfather clock. 3:28 am. Holy fuck. When had they gotten back, no later than 9? Had they really been talking for over six hours?
"If Harry's going to make me sit through this," Ginny said, "there will be retribution. Come here, come join!"
The pop of apparition when they landed at Grimmauld Place echoed in the silence. Had Ginny and Ron already gone off to bed?
He blinked, his gaze falling behind Harry to meet Astoria's. She gave them a wink, the finger she was trailing down Ron's collar curling possessively.
e) other (please specify)
At least Malfoy had Parkinson and Zabini, even if they seemed like two of the least pleasant people in the world.
"So the two people the DNA belongs to..?" Malfoy asked.
"And jealous over us talking," Harry said, "like we're seventeen again."
"How's my Rosie?"
"He was going to hurt Andrew," Blazer guy explained.
"A table in the back just opened up if you're gonna want to eat."
"What erm... what should we do next?"
"It's like, just because I could do anything I want to, people think I should give up what I really want to do something impressive."
"What? Why?"
a) Cold places like mountains
They walked around Central Park for a bit before stopping for ice cream.
"Harry!" Luna cried, throwing her arms around him and then pulling back to give a quick peck on the nose. "We thought we'd come by and say hullo. Did you know it's a mess in here?"
"Wow. I didn't know that. I figured, with your job at the ministry..."
It was nice. Her lips were soft and tasted like the sharp burn of alcohol and coconuts. He pulled away before it got too far.
And don't be afraid
"I'll see if I can get him to wax poetic about his love for muggle tv; that might set her off."
Until this point, Robards had kept his voice level. Now he was raising it with every word.
"I thought I was about to see you die to avoid a stranger knowing we tried and failed to get a DNA sample."
"You know when my mother and father were courting, she told him that if he ever embarrassed her, she'd call it all off. Once I was born she told him that there was nothing in this world she wouldn't do for me and that if he ever embarrassed me, harmed me, or did anything of the sort, there'd be hell to pay. My father adored me, of course, so there was nothing to worry about, but you know that."
a) Laidback
"I have to get back to Barkley. He needs to be fed and such."
"At Clos Maggiore?"
"Shhh, shhh, you're here. That's all I could have asked for. And you brought the boy hero with you, too."
Kreacher rolled his old, rotting eyes so far back Harry was convinced they'd fall right out. "Kreacher remembers misters Weasley and Weasley. Unnatural, loud, horrible little creatures, them."
"I should quit my job."
Chains coughed and Malfoy grabbed another glass and filled it with beer, sliding it across the bar to him.
"Fuck, you're going to get us arrested."
Harry hummed. "Not quite. Your first cousin, three times removed married Charlus Potter, my great great grandfather."
"Breakfast."
"Gormless," Malfoy continued, and Harry decided he quite missed when he'd had to guess what he was saying, "twit."
Harry leaned his head back against the metal door frame, letting the last glints of sun flash over his face. "Don't I deserve to be happy?"
~The End~
"It's all about practice. Once you get it the first time, it comes easier."
Malfoy whacked him on the arm. "That's because I'm not. It's the muggle's fault for creating such an inane contraption, not mine for being uncomfortable using it."
He gave her a grateful smile and sat down in front of the next woman.
When she was gone, Harry could see the waiter standing by the cart full of cups and plates. Mrs. Fawley's plate was right on top.
"Let's give them some space."
When Harry stepped forward to peer into the darkness, she grabbed his arm to hold him back and cast a hesitant Lumos.
"Right after the war. No primarily wizarding place would hire me, said it was bad for business. That one is run by wizards but has a lot of muggle clientele."
Malfoy smirked at him and walked down the hall to his own door.
He tapped his wand against the window in frustration and looked around. There was a plunger sitting just to the right of the sink.
"Drink. Heavily."
"Why are you telling me?"
"Why?"
"You're the inspector?" Harry asked. It seemed like a very fitting job. If there was one thing people would remember about Zabini, it was how much he loved judging people.
"So, Mr. Potter, why have you come to see me?"
"This world has too many laws, too many rules. What happened to the basics? Don't kill anyone and don't steal."
"No. I don't want to bet over who killed your father, let's just test the samples and then we'll know."
She stopped short at the sight of their friends, frowning.
When neither of them offered up the first word, Malfoy sighed.
She nodded and grabbed a handkerchief from her robes. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't be so emotional. We've known for years now that she's dying. It was giving birth to Thalia that put her on bed rest. She can't even manage magic anymore. That's why they broke the engagement off, one of the reasons at least. Draco always needed an heir and he didn't want to put her through that."
Malfoy was wearing a cocktail waiter uniform and put up five Glamours as he watched: two to turn his hair and eyes brown, one to round out the shape of his nose, one to make him tanner, and one to make him taller and more muscular.
"You sure? The pub's closing soon."
"Mione?" He and Ron asked.
"I'm fine, I need to speak with Ron."
"And I am done talking to you."
"Thought it was a misunderstanding."
"How many responses?"
The waiter came over to their table to refill their drinks and ask if they wanted anything else. Neither of them did so he walked away to go get the bill. Speak of the devil, he sort of looked like Malfoy.
It did. He hated his smoking, and his eating habits, and his laugh, and his smile, and the way he got on so well with Harry's bloody godson.
The light attracted at least ten other children who'd been dragged along by their parents and they all crowded around Harry. Malfoy winked at him from where he was mixing. God, what Harry wouldn't give to laugh at him entertaining kids instead.
open response:
At then end of the meal when Malfoy offered Harry the last bite of Tart, he sat back and looked at him for a moment.
Casting the spells Luna'd taught him to check for animal welfare, Harry felt relieved at the bold blue wisps of light that rose out of his head.
"Whatever. You are."
Harry looked around and made sure no one was paying them much attention. The corner he had chosen was tucked away enough that no one could see them except for the people in the kitchens. He'd hoped that Malfoy would be able to spot him if he needed any help. Malfoy did spot him, and though he didn't seem in need of help, he did nod at Harry. "Do you want to see?"
"Potter," he drawled. "I can't say I'm surprised to see you, but this certainly is an unusual circumstance we've worked ourselves into." He nodded at Zabini. "Blaise. Effective as always."
A mobile sounded and Harry looked around for his before Malfoy dug one out of his pocket.
"It just hurt so much, to see them caring about me when people I loved and that other people loved had died."
"I could go for a pint. And it'll be nice to not have to put on a glamour for once. How 'bout you, Gin?"
"Who the hell knows, he might be. Did you have fun?"
Hmm, hmm, hmm
"I'm here because no one else was deemed objective enough to be your inspector. And believe me you, I asked. But you're a hero, Potter, like it or not. So there's not a single person in that office not looking to get on your good side."
"It's not about the cannons," Ginny insisted.
Ron whistled, "So just small talk, then? Merlin, mate, you've really gone and dug yourself in deep. Have you had a slumber party yet, or braided each other's hair?"
Harry grinned.
"Passing all my exams."
"What do you mean?"
Did that sound guilty? Did it make it seem like something would be happening that he didn't want them to see?
The pizza was better than Harry'd had in a long time. He'd have to remember the name of the restaurant later. Baba— something or other.
Harry was sitting in his office trying to think of literally anything besides Malfoy when Ron walked in, presumably to save him from a slow and horny death and transfigured one of Harry's paperweights into a chair.
"Honestly, if he even thinks for a second you could-"
He got the feeling that that particular idea sounded just as useless to her as it did him.
On the cobblestone street, there was a single dusty shoe-print, right next to the outline of a foot.
"So your... shop is struggling for business?"
That was another thing that'd changed.
He knew how hard it was for her to be away from them when all of this was going on, and she'd come back briefly for the funeral, but she had to be there with her parents.
The door opened then, and Malfoy swept in, stopping in his tracks when he caught sight of Harry.
On that Thursday after work, they traveled to a muggle restaurant a short apparition away from Mrs. Fawley's apothecary. Malfoy spoke passionately about what he wanted to study and the branches of potions he wanted to specialise in. He used words like "cordial" and "decant" in ways that made no sense to Harry but caused Mrs. Fawley to nod and smile.
They were back to their usual.
"Merlin, you're so frustrating. You know that's not what I mean!"
Malfoy looked at him warily. "So you thought... Why not buy me the tea you hate because—"
Harry nearly placed a hand on his arm before deciding that was inappropriate.
"We only have a minute. Go on, tell me about yourself." She leaned her head on her hand and waited. She seemed nice enough and she was quite pretty with long blonde hair and brown eyes, so he did as she asked.
"We could get a pizza."
"But now?"
Harry raised his eyebrows.
Verity grinned when she saw him, a box of Nosebleed Nougat tucked under her arm.
Malfoy raised his brows, leaning back in his chair and not looking remotely impressed. "What are you trying to prove, again?"
b) The Appleby Arrows
Alicia seemed confused but she smiled and squeezed his arm fondly. "We're both interested in dancing."
"Sure you were. There's not a person alive today who didn't hate him for one reason or another. Well, it's no matter anyway. You should be going."
Malfoy's chest was heaving, but he composed himself quickly, taking his wand out of his sleeve to clean up the tea he'd spilt on the rug, setting everything to rights and then folding his hands in his lap, looking away from Harry at the wall of photos like he was interested in what he saw.
Harry rolled his eyes and took a sip of wine.
"What the hell is that?" Harry asked.
Harry scoffed. It'd be fine, would it? God, he could just imagine the reactions now. "Fine for who, the Prophet? My leagues of adoring fans? You and Hermione might be fine with it but no one else would be."
It wasn't a question, but it felt like one.
Well, that was... that was pretty unfortunate, really.
"Hey, mate," Neville shouted. "Can we floo through?"
And don't believe that magic can die
These kinds of things? How often did people indirectly accuse him of murder?
When his heart had slowed, he slid off the couch to where he wasn't quite so on Malfoy and turned to look at him. He seemed, quite honestly, more shocked than anything.
"It's not that messy."
"Eh yeah well, she's a no brainer, then. What about her?" He held up a picture of a woman with bright purple hair and freckles.
b) Succeed in my Career
Ron shook his head, going back to the eggs. "I put the kettle on for you."
c) Treacle Tart
"Oh. No I get it. I'd be upset too."
"Obviously."
Malfoy fixed him with a look and Harry rolled his eyes. "Yeah okay. The Dursley's would a lot as long as we weren't around important people. Oh and Snape, of course."
"How are you Harry? I was a bit worried when I didn’t get any more letters during this week…" I ask.
"Oh Merlin, fuck. Fire, huh. I shouldn’t even be surprised anymore. That’s just Draco’s luck."
"But if he already finished, why didn’t he tell me?" asked Draco and frowned.
"Thank you Kreacher, that’s exactly what we needed to hear. I’m glad my privacy is taken so seriously in this household," Draco said with a smirk and the old elf bowed and disappeared. "And I’m not lying about this, I didn’t get hurt in the battle."
"Here," she levitates a box of matches into my hand. "Try again, I want to see you doing that spell."
Harry noticed that and lay him against the pillows. He slowly undid the buttons of his pyjama shirt and revealed Draco’s chest. His delicate bones were clearly visible, milky white skin contrasting with small dark nipples, just begging to be touched. Harry brushed his fingers against them and Draco closed his eyes in pleasure.
"If you say so…"  Draco said. He finished the massage but didn’t get up.
Harry sat on the bed and Draco flinched.
He raises his eyebrows at me but puts ten boxes on the counter in front of me. Third from the right is mine, I know it, but just for a show I let my hand hover above them for about one minute until I feel the pull and reach for my wand. I pick it up and it vibrates slightly at the touch. I give it a small wave and fill the shop with silver sparks.
"Ron was such an asshole, I will deal up with him later, make sure he apologizes." Harry said and continued caressing Draco’s back.
"Yes, Harry." he said and Harry looked at him lovingly. He liked Draco all docile like this.
"Draco, " Harry sighed. "The way he acted to you wasn’t how one treats their lover."
"Shh, it’s not going to hurt much longer, it will feel a bit strange but it will be over soon." Harry explained and Draco felt warmth seeping from Harry’s palm.
"Sorry, Draco… wanted to see you." Harry said, looking guilty.
"Harry, can I…" Draco started a sentence but hesitated to finish it.
"You were perfect my little prince, so beautiful." Harry complimented him, admiration and affection in his voice, as he performed a simple cleaning spell. "Do you feel alright?" he asked.
"No, but he has to realize the ritual has started and is going on and we have already taken his ability to feel the warmth out of the picture with the fire protection spells. So I wouldn’t risk both sight and hearing but to restrict only one of them would be alright."
"You didn’t leave any note and you didn’t tell anybody anything but there wasn’t any sign of anybody else being there, no traces of magic and the wounds were self-inflicted. I was the one to find you."  Harry said, barely audible.
"Alright, alright," agreed Harry.
"I would prefer if the light stayed on." he said softly and avoided Harry’s eyes bashfully.
"But this is wrong, I’m here about to munch on my breakfast while she is working on sorting out the Snape’s research and…"
"When I died, it seemed like a few seconds to everybody around but to me, it was different. I was in this other place before I decided to come back and finish what I needed to. I saw things from my past and my pasts before, talked with people, learned a lot."
"Draco, look at me." Harry said softly, trailing his fingers over Draco’s jaw, then touching his lips. "I want to take care of you but you need to keep your eyes opened. Keep watching me and think just about me doing this to you. Can you do it for me little prince?"
– it can be used while fighting to cut your opponent but it is also used by healers during surgeries. On the other hand,
"Draco, sweetie, are you alright?" my mother asks.
"Maybe Harry just doesn’t want you to embarrass yourself any further in front of me and Hermione, Weaslette." Draco said and lifted one of his eyebrows.
Harry was glad to be back at home, he was exhausted and couldn’t wait to fall in bed and sleep but first he wanted to check on Draco.
They were still kneeling on the floor, Draco shaking and clutching at Harry's shirt, looking around worried.
Draco bent his head down and nuzzled his face against Harry’s shaft, breathing in his scent. Then he licked his lips and took the head of Harry’s cock into his mouth, making him moan. He moved his lips up and down the shaft ceaselessly, but he couldn’t take Harry’s whole cock in without choking and when he tried, Harry interlaced his fingers into his blond hair and started to control the depth, only allowing third of his cock into Draco’s mouth.
"You can do that? I mean, how? They are my legal guardians." Harry asks, frowning.
"Hello, Hogwarts too?" I ask him with a smile.
"Yep, you did." She agreed and they both started laughing again.
"No, not from quidditch." Draco admitted, still avoiding Harry’s eyes.
"But I want to belong to you." Draco mumbled and immediately placed hand over his mouth in shock. He blabbered without thinking.
"Extraordinary Mr. Malfoy! Twenty points to Slytherin. Tell me if you need more reading materials."
"Because you can manage on your own. " I say and he looks at me, doubting. "I’m going to let go of your broom and you will very slightly point it downwards and start descending. You have to be clear that that’s what you want and hold the handle firmly. You want to slowly get back to the ground. Alright?"
"That’s enough! Ginny, you will not talk to Draco like that. I get that it’s a shock for you and I’m sorry but you will not point your wand at him." Harry chastised Ginny who only started to cry more.
But in a second both Hermione and Harry are holding needles instead of matches.
"Yes." Draco agreed and the grasp of his hands on Harry’s shirt relaxed.
"Maybe you are right. I was really upset when you didn’t take my hand when we were eleven." Draco chuckled. "I think that is why I was so mean to Weasel and Granger. You must not tell her but actually, I was always very impressed by how clever Granger is." Draco said seriously.
"No, no, you can stay. I mean, I’d like you to stay, please," said Draco with pleading eyes.
Other Slytherins nod in agreement.
"But how did you do it?" Hermione asks. "I can’t do any progress besides making it silver and a bit pointy."
"Draco?" Harry tried again louder. He got closer to the bathtub to touch Draco’s shoulder in order to wake him up. Harry almost flinched from how cold Draco’s skin was.
Hello my dear readers,
"And I’ve heard all about you, you’ve the reputation of the best pranksters of this school. I might be interested in your services."
"How do you like it Harry?"
"I don’t think you need to be so worried." Blaise suggests. "Most of our housemates don’t hold him very dear. Partially because of his beliefs, partially because of his blatant favourism of Gryffindor."
"Yeah, I let you tattoo my arm, some design with skull, snake and flowers and I get 1000 pounds cash." Michael answered and Harry nodded.
“I’m not sure--”
“Both of you?” Harry asked, indirectly to Ron.
“We’ll see,” Draco smirked at the red-head, “we shall see.”
Harry nearly scoffed, “Break my heart? Losing my owl would break my heart.”
Harry approached him slowly, not exactly wanting Draco to notice he was who he was going towards. He spoke aloud, not directing his attention to the taller boy, but both of them knew he was talking to him.
“It’s just,” Hermione started, not wanting to be the one to say it, sensing his bad mood already, “your robe.”
It was to no avail, as even though Harry was slightly shorter he was much stronger. He let Draco panic for a moment before he took pity on him, leaning down and whispering for him to be still. He did once he recognized the voice, panic quickly switching to confusion.
Draco nodded, nearly beaming as Harry praised him with a “good boy.” He slipped off the bed languidly before removing every article of his clothing and taking his place once again, this time on his stomach.
Harry’s eyes widened, “what would I go and do that for?”
Harry was sick of Draco. So, what was he to do other than come up with a plan to embarrass the cunning Slytherin? Nothing, that’s what.
“Was there ever really an us when you left so easily?” Harry questioned, “I really couldn’t be upset, could I?”
“Calm down, love, you’re okay,” He soothed, noting that the realization that this was happening had just hit Harry, and like a ton of bricks Draco guessed. He’d put 10 galleons on Harry panicking more because he was allowing himself to have this. He was letting Draco take him.
Harry smiled at the blissful look Draco had on his face. He couldn’t seem to stop himself from leaning in and peppering the other boys face with feather-light kisses, pecking his lips tenderly and pulling back.
He couldn’t tear his senses away from Draco, not if his life depended on it. He mustered up a drop of strength to reach his hand out blindly and latch onto Ron’s as tears trailed their way down his rosy cheeks.
"Quiet, love," Malfoy chastised, "wouldn't want someone hearing us, now would we?"
“I was bullshitting, of course. I just wanted to get him riled up, you know? He obviously responded to dirty talk, so I took it up a notch. But, oh gosh… Ron you should’ve seen how he reacted to that!”
Instead of seeing his proud Gryffindor emblem, he instead found a silver and emerald green one. The robe he wore was a Slytherin house robe, and it was none other than Draco Malfoy’s. He turned to the Slytherin table, finding that Draco’s eyes were already on him, beaming with something he could only describe as mischief, his lips turned up in an amused smile.
Harry simply whined and Draco figured that was what he could muster at the moment. He pushed in slowly, stopping after he was halfway in to let the boy beneath him adjust. Once Harry moved his hips he pushed in further until he was completely sheathed inside Harry.
“You’re going to fuck yourself of my cock, and if I’m satisfied then maybe I’ll let you cum.”
Harry pretended to think about it for a moment before he leaned down beside Draco’s ear. He held himself at Draco’s entrance with one hand, the other snaking into the blonde’s hair and getting a firm grip on it, pulling his head back so that it was on his shoulder.
Harry was half-hard already as Draco gave him a firm squeeze. As much as he wanted to give in to the strong hands that were already on him, he couldn’t help but turn to the other boy in the room.
Draco rolled his eyes, releasing one of his hands from Harry's hip and bringing it up to cover his mouth. Harry moaned into Malfoy's hand, feeling the coil in his stomach growing tighter and tighter.
Draco brought one hand around to cup the brown-haired boy through his jeans, the other hand petting through his hair.
He hardly noticed it at first, and, to be fair, it started out little.
Harry shook his head, but he definitely didn't trust himself to keep quiet with how good Draco was making him feel. His instinct was right because as soon as the silver-haired boy picked up his pace he was failing to hold back a whimper.
“How am I supposed to know?” Ron defended himself, “you’ve been with Harry for two months and you still don’t like him sometimes.”
Harry pretended to think about it for a minute, “I’m not sure you deserve it,”
He spread the spit over Harry's cock, wrapping his hand around it and stroking in time with his thrusts. Harry whined and dropped his face into Draco's neck, the familiar feeling coming back and making him feel tingly as he groaned.
“Potter,” Draco managed through what could have been a sob or a cough, “i-it hurts, please, I c-can’t,”
Draco went to deny it but whimpered again as Harry pressed his head against his shoulder, smirking into his skin as he moved his leg between Draco’s thighs.
With a wave of his wand he had the lights off and an alarm set, not wishing to be caught dead in Harry Potter's bed by any others.
Draco couldn’t think. He couldn’t do anything other than feel. He knew he wouldn’t last long as Harry and Ron picked up their pace, slamming in and down on him mercilessly. He couldn’t bother to be embarrassed as he choked out a weak “p-please…”
Harry turned them over so Draco was on top and straddling his thighs. He lifted Draco and placed him above his cock.
“Amazes me every time,” Harry agreed, groaning when Draco moaned around him again, “takes it like a pro, too.”
He was faintly aware that Ron was somewhere beside him, watching as he took Draco’s cock much the same way he took his. Watching as he took cock the way Draco had told Ron he had. Watching as he took cock like he was meant for it.
His pink lips were parted as slow pants left them, his lungs feeling like they were full of lead as his prostate was hit dead on.
It sounded more like an accusation than a statement, and maybe it was. He wasn’t really wrong either way.
Draco shrugged, leaning closer and making Harry fight to not get up and physically drag his seat away from the other male.
