me, told me the minute you even suspected. You dealt with all this on your own?” Harry’s voice sounded rough – annoyed – and his jaw was set and tense. “You’ve always been such a proud bloody prick, too arrogant to ask for help! I can’t believe this! I can’t believe
Malfoy pulls him to the right, to a little counter where a small spindly woman sits behind a large magnifying glass. She's conducting her wand with a lot of flourishing and a threaded needle is following along.
“Thank you for looking after me,” Draco said. “I know I need to buy pregnancy clothes, but I’ve been putting it off. Can’t abide all the fuss and nonsense. The paparazzi will have a field day, watching the pair of us buy matching
“Hold your bloody Hippogriffs, Harry,” Draco answered, his voice betraying his annoyance. If Harry was this panicky now, how bad would it be when the baby actually came to be born? “We don’t need to Floo to St Mungo’s. I’m- I’m absolutely fine. I simply need my wand. A small wardrobe malfunction, easily rectified. Perhaps if I could have it? I’ll only be a moment.”
Harry had been the impeccable co-parent that he’s promised to be. He’d taken to coming over every day, bringing over books and Quidditch magazines for Draco to leaf through. Best of all, Harry brought ice-cream, kept under Stasis, for the pair of them to share, and cast Cooling Charms that flitted through Half-Moon Place, making Draco’s skin tickle with the familiarity of it.
as he walked through the maze of rooms, shouting for help, but unable to make even the smallest of sounds. The signs were in some unreadable language, and with every step, the terrifying fear coursing through him increased.
When he's not catering to Malfoy's complex food whims, he's snuggled in bed with him, gaining an appreciation for the crossword puzzle book Hermione gave him for Christmas two years ago.
Draco acknowledged her words, nodding his head low to show his respect and thanks, and the elf vanished with a click of her fingertips. He walked down the parquet floor, the clicking of his heels on the ancient wood still familiar from his childhood in this gilded, luxurious cage.
The door swung open, and Draco was faced with the cheerful, freckled face of Ron Weasley standing in the entrance hall, smirking widely. He was wearing a very orange Cannons shirt that clashed merrily with his red hair.
But then Harry thinks about this morning, Malfoy bringing him breakfast in bed, the vase with the flower, and the chai tea Malfoy got him, and the lovely breakfast he made from scratch for Harry. He thinks about his slow kisses and how he's helping Hermione and made vegan cupcakes for Luna and rock cakes for Hagrid.
Harry pushes the rest of his polenta around his bowl, feeling embarrassed by his outburst and what he revealed during it.
“I’m not here to tell you what your future is going to be like. I’m not here to tell you what you’re doing wrong. Life hasn’t been what you’d call ordinary for m— for you.
The desire that had been building inside of Draco threatened to burst into Fiendfyre. Draco couldn’t keep his eyes from Harry’s flat belly and the luscious trail of hair that led to his jeans. Well defined pecs, a constellation of freckles and tiny scars completed the vision, and he felt himself flush pink when Harry caught him staring.
Harry's so happy in the sunshine, a little drunk on wine with a full belly that he says, "That was a great pasty."
"I'm really, really sorry Malfoy, I should have realized sooner you were sick," Harry says, the words spilling out of him unfiltered.
“… you’d think you’re a bloody Auror with the amount of dangerous things that happen to you at work,” he hears Draco say.
“I don’t doubt it,” Draco said, touching Harry’s wrist for the tiniest of moments. “Now off with you, Potter. I’m dead on my feet.”
Malfoy insists Harry Apparate four separate times or else, "You'll splinch the Swiss meringue buttercream." So Harry walks each batch of cupcakes to the edge of the Manor's wards, Apparates with the cupcakes, deposits them in his kitchen, Floos back to the Manor, collects more cupcakes and does it all over again. Four times. The fourth time he's greeted at his flat with Malfoy's anxious face checking over the cupcakes, presumably to make sure Harry hasn't mauled them in transit.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, as soon as Judith paused for breath. “I’m sure that St Mortimer’s Place has a million charms, but it simply isn’t for me. I’d feel discourteous if we were to continue our tour.”
For the very first time, Draco felt gratified Harry had Transfigured himself into a walking, talking pregnancy guidebook. He managed a weak smile, glad both that he wasn’t losing his marbles, and secondly that Harry had taken such good care of him.
Harry follows Ron's advice. He gets another cup of tea, wishing it was the chai he's now addicted to instead of Earl Gray. And then he tells Ron everything he can about his trip to Diagon two days ago—where they went, in what order, how much time they spent at each shop, anyone they saw or spoke to, what the clerks looked like—and Ron takes quick and efficient notes. When they're done Ron says, "Do you want me to walk with you to Kingsley's office?"
Hagrid asks what Harry wants to do now and when he answers he's not sure Hagrid spends a while trying to convince him of various creature related fields, including contacting Charlie to work with dragons in Romania. Malfoy listens along, slumped against his pillows and blinking slowly. When Malfoy starts to nod off, Hagrid says his goodbyes, bending in half again to get out the door.
Restorative justice does sound complex, almost as complex and difficult to understand as Harry snogging Malfoy.
her quill, notebook, and sewing kit, and kneel down in front of Draco. She peered up at him over the top of her owl-like glasses.
Draco hadn’t actually thought about needing help while he was pregnant. All of his worries had been focused on after the baby was born. “I’ve got friends,” he answered, fiddling with a loose button on the cuff of his shirt. Pansy, Theo and Mils would help him. “And my mother. Though I haven’t told her yet,” he clarified.
“How long have I been entirely sure? Only since you walked into my drawing room, Draco. It was blatant at first sight, my darling.” Mother leant over the table, and she brushed a gentle finger across the side of his face. “Your hair is glossy, and there’s a softness about your jaw. It’s very handsome. I meant it when I said you looked wonderful, Draco. You do. Pregnancy obviously suits you.”
Indeed, the inevitable had happened only that morning. Harry had Apparated early to Grimmauld Place, planning to share a pot of tea before leaving for St Mungo’s. Their sixteen-week appointment was that morning, and Draco had felt eager to see their baby once again. They were the size of an avocado now, and their flutters had gotten a tiny bit more pronounced.
He sips his coffee, thinking. The Ministry is clearly trying to send him a message, or else hoping to catch him out in some wrongdoing, but they'll be sorely disappointed. He's not going to let Potter intimidate him or goad him into doing something stupid, he thinks, getting the buckwheat flour out of the cabinet. And though Potter will be spending the foreseeable future at the Manor, Draco refuses to cater to him.
Harry Potter. He’d been the bane of Draco’s life when they were children, and now he’d managed to throw the carefully constructed parts of his existence into the air once more.
Bloody Louis was going to swan in, take the spot that Draco had worked his arse off for, and Draco knew he ought to be devastated.
Harry gives a weak laugh and goes to sit down at a table in the back corner, where he can see everything. Harry tries taking deep breaths while Ron is getting their tea. He's surprised at his reaction to the Auror office. He feels silly for being afraid of a bunch of dinging alarms and hurrying people. Just the sound brought Harry straight back to always being on edge, waiting for the next catastrophe.
the box of croissants out of the bag and onto the table. Draco flipped the lid open and couldn’t help but almost moan aloud at the divine scent of them. He hated to admit it, but perhaps Harry had been onto something with the pastries. He placed two onto a plate, and carried the brunches out of the kitchen, careful not to spill a crumb. He’d been too nervous to have breakfast, and, all of a sudden, he was ravenous.
Draco did. He moved to the hob, and kept his attention solely focused on the food, moving the chicken in the pan and making sure that nothing got burnt. Draco even thought that he’d been doing a reasonable job until Harry stepped in behind him, and pressed his chest into Draco’s back. Circe, but it felt wonderful. Harry hooked his head over Draco’s shoulder and wrapped his arms around the swell of his middle. Draco leant back into him, enjoying the moment. He hadn’t realised how touch-starved he was, and he revelled in Harry’s warmth and sturdy presence.
you'd go back," Ron says through a mouth full of wheaties. "I don't know why we even took you home."
Harry reaches for Malfoy's hand. Harry thought his first trip back to Diagon would be filled with looking over his shoulder and keeping his head down, but Malfoy is so ridiculous he takes all of Harry's attention. Malfoy pays at the Apothecary and they leave Diagon, still holding hands.
Hermione comes in with her bag and Harry takes a pinch of Floo powder with shaking fingers and Floos back to St. Mungo's. The waiting room has emptied out and it's just the three of them. Harry resumes sitting restlessly on the hard waiting room chair he's been sitting in all evening. Ron says he'll go get Harry a tea from the cafeteria and Hermione sits down next to him holding his hand.
Harry didn’t seem to think so. The stag disappeared with a flare of green sparkles, and Draco watched as Harry Apparated into the space it had just vacated with a noisy pop.
Hermione goes soft at these words and leans up to kiss Ron on the cheek and Harry feels like he's living in a parallel universe where Malfoy didn't call Hermione a Mudblood every chance he got.
Harry rolls out of bed, only marginally less confused than he was before his talk with Ron. He doesn't know what he wants from Malfoy. He doesn't know what to do about Neville. All he really knows is that Ron is right, he's been a lot happier since he's been eating porridge at the Manor with Malfoy, and getting dragged all over the wizarding UK in search of beautiful things, quilts, and sourdough bread, and flowers.
With that, Harry pulled away and Draco opened his eyes. The kiss didn’t mean anything. It was momentary and fleeting, naught but a natural reaction to the strong feelings they both shared. Harry and he were friends; friends who were having a baby, and that was all. Draco quickly dragged his eyes away from Harry’s and down, once more, to their baby.
Draco wasn’t doing that. There wasn’t a Hippogriff in hell’s chance that he’d be willing to take any kind of test that day. He wasn’t anywhere close to ready to know the answer. If he traced his nausea all the way back to Harry Potter, back to half a bottle of Firewhisky and a broken condom, then life as Draco knew it would have to end, and surely, surely Draco’s luck couldn’t be that cruel. Hadn’t he already had enough bad luck for a lifetime?
"Let the Trainee Healers know if you have any questions," the Healer says, already halfway out the door.
Take out decided and ordered, Harry wanders around the flat looking at the several bouquets on shelves and tables around the flat. Malfoy told him the preservation spells will last at least a month as long as Harry keeps the vases watered. Harry feels pretty indifferent to the ceramic casserole dish and measuring spoons Malfoy made him buy but the flowers feel both soothing and celebratory. A special treat he gets to wake up to every day. And Harry will never tell Malfoy but the rug does look better pulled out from under the bed more. Harry's whole flat feels peaceful and homey and
“I’m not giving up flying,” Draco said, picking up the theme of their earlier talk. “Mummy has said that she’ll look after our little one on match days. I doubt that Flint will mind me missing the team hotel, long as I’m able to Floo in for morning training. It’s funny. I thought Mother would encourage me to give up Seeking when I told her I was pregnant, and to stay at home instead. You know, do the whole Lord-of-the-Manor act, but she’s really encouraged me to stay in the sky.” Draco grinned and scooped up ice-cream with his spoon. “Told me that I’ll be glad of the distraction! Truthfully, she’s looking forward to being a grandma. I think she’s planning to spoil her rotten.”
"Oh here we go," Malfoy says, setting his spoon down with a loud clatter. He sounds angry which Harry doesn't understand.
that baby book, but some parts of it are worth reading. And it said that, for some wizards, the move to wearing pregnancy clothes can be really daunting. It’s that feeling that you’ve lost control of your body, and that there isn’t much you can do about it.” Harry leant over and pressed a small, chaste kiss into Draco’s hair. “Not to mention the increased levels of hormones in your body, and the extra strain on your magic. This is a really tough time, but you’re doing really well, Draco. Every day that passes I feel prouder of you.”
"Your legs are so long," Harry says, one hand on Malfoy's bony ankle, the feel of which somehow has Harry short of breath. He traces his fingers over the knob of bone and Malfoy shifts his leg up just a little higher. Harry's never snuggled like this before. The few moments Harry had with Ginny were snuck away in Hogwarts corridors, not in the private comfort of his own soft bed, the whole night his to be hugged and held close. It feels so wonderful Harry finds himself humming and nuzzling under Malfoy's chin, pressing little kisses to Malfoy's neck.
"Then he told me my family was Punjabi and that's why he was making dal makhani. Because it's Punjabi."
Harry took another sip of his coffee before he spoke again. “I wasn’t going to ask either of those two questions, Draco,” he said, his voice low and soft. It was everything that Draco hadn’t expected. His heart thumped in his chest, and he swallowed a mouthful of tea, fingers trembling around the thin china. Draco could see cogs clicking inside of Harry’s head. “I’m not a total arse. I was there too, remember?” He paused, and sat back in his chair. “Bloody hell Draco! After the Harpies game? That was eight… No,
"We were able to stabilize him. I have some more tests to run in the morning and then hopefully we'll know what's causing his symptoms."
Malfoy rests his hands on top of Harry's at his belt loops and starts tracing his fingertips over Harry's knuckles, slipping his fingers through Harry's, and the soft touch gives Harry a shiver up his back.
the notes he’d made on the strategies Montrose were likely to use during their upcoming game. He spread them out on the table before looking up at Draco.
“You want to be bonded?” Draco asked, the scepticism of his question curdling Harry’s confession. “You want courting gifts and matching bloody robes, and Lucius – you rememeber, the convicted Death Eater, the man who tried to have you killed – for a Father-in-Law? You want the handfasting spell and our magic woven together for the rest of our lives?”
At the gates to the Manor Harry Apparates to an alleyway outside of St. Mungo's and puts on the invisibility cloak. He stands outside the door in the cold morning air waiting for someone else to open it and gets his chance after about ten minutes.
They stand side by side at the counter, Harry peeling the eggs and passing them to Malfoy, who's removing the soft boiled yolks and dicing the whites.
Malfoy hits a stirring spoon against the side of the pan much harder than he needs to to knock the food off and then turns to face Harry.
Like he’d promised, Harry was there. Unobtrusive, unassuming and understated, but there nevertheless.
be ready – but then it happened, and it’s with you, and, well, I just can’t imagine it differently now. Of all the lives I could have experienced, I’m… Well, I’m glad this life is mine.”
“Can you get up onto the examining table?” Hayes asked him as she picked up her wand. “Same drill as before. Just undo your trousers, hitch them down a little and pull up your shirt, and we’ll get started. First, I’ll take your measurements and then we’ll have a look at your baby…” She frowned. “If you’ll just excuse me? I seem to have run out of documenting parchment.”
The seamstress was an older witch with pretty green robes, and Draco gave her a nervous smile. This marked the first time that he’d spoken to anyone that wasn’t a loved one or a Healer about his baby.
. This was going to take a lot of getting used to. His and Harry’s baby. Draco absentmindedly rubbed his tummy, just like he’d begun to do, occasionally, in the evenings or when he was wrapped up in bed.
"I'll have you know I've been to the Tesco before and I said none of those things," Malfoy says, sticking his nose in the air.
Whenever he thought about Harry, there was always a good reason to put him off for another hour or so.
"I'm making a curry. Actually, I learned that 'curry' to describe a spiced sauce is a British thing, and really it's called something else. Well it's called many different things depending on what it is and what region it's from. Why are you looking at me like I just broke your nose again?"
After, Harry watches Draco get ready. He leaves Other Harry in bed and walks to the bathroom across the landing, emerging five minutes later, coiffed and perfumed — but not wearing the Healer nor the Unspeakable robes. Harry decides this is the mystery he must solve today.
Ron puts an arm around Harry's shoulders and Harry breaks down for a moment with a sharp inhale and tears in his eyes. He wipes at his face trying to take deep breaths but his chest won't cooperate. He settles for shallow breaths as Ron squeezes his shoulders and says, "It'll be alright, mate."
"I'm fairly certain after three votes in absentia, the Governor in absentia's heir assumes their role."
Opening the pantry, Draco passed a bottle of fizzy Pumpkin Juice out to Goyle and took one for himself. The two of them sat down in front of the tidy plates of sandwiches.
“I haven’t told her who the other father is.” Greg said quietly, “And I won’t. That’s your secret to tell.” Another wave of his wand had the takeaway boxes piling up, and flying back into the paper bag they’d arrived on. “But when that child of yours arrives, they’ll only be part-baby Malfoy.” Greg leant back in his arm chair, half-heartedly fiddling with his own printed fortune.
Harry added a toy snowy owl that looked very much like Elianna to his basket. “You want to find out?” Harry asked, moving to stand beside Draco. He reached out, touching a little tee-shirt that had a picture of a cauldron on it, and the words ‘
"You know the answer. The only reason you asked is so you can feel superior. Your food is better, alright?"
Malfoy tells Harry to levitate the tray and Harry does, grumbling just for the fun of it, and follows Malfoy through the endless cold corridors of the Manor. Despite Harry's many visits to Malfoy's home, Harry has never actually seen Malfoy's bedroom.
Harry does so because he's not sulking. Malfoy doesn't even seem angry anymore. He's back to moving around the kitchen with that satisfied look on his face, adding cream and a little mustard to the pan until even the kale starts to look delicious.
It’s comforting that his house is still his, even if it’s a Harry he can’t recognise as himself. The biggest surprise is that this Other Harry seems to be extremely close to Draco Malfoy. Extremely close in the romantic sense of things, which Harry really, really can’t understand. Harry watches his Other Self tilt his face up towards (a jeans-wearing!) Draco Malfoy, who looks at him and smiles before leaning in and kissing him on a loop. It makes him feel dizzy. And he really doesn’t have the time to unpack whatever
It took much less than five minutes to drop off completely. Unfortunately, Draco’s dream – some sensual nonsense that involved Harry and he eating ice-cream in the bathtub – was disturbed before it successfully managed to get interesting. Harrumphing, Draco got up, and made slow progress over the window. He’d been woken by the tapping beak of an owl delivery – likely the potion refill that he’d ordered from Frobisher’s earlier that morning – and Draco pulled the curtains aside, anticipating the sight of their usual Apothecary bird.
Draco lay back, counting to ten as Braithwaite waved his wand around and spoke an incantation that he was unacquainted with. The sensation of the Mediwix’s spell wasn’t enjoyable, and Draco felt it all over his skin like a thousand tiny pinpricks. Shining tendrils of purple magic began to gather above his abdomen, and Draco felt a sudden warmth infuse him. He watched, eyes peeled, as the wisps gathered into a tiny, pulsating mass that floated just below his navel. Braithwaite seemed satisfied.
"Oh, er." Harry doesn't know how to tell Neville that actually he feels like shite. "Fine," he says.
Harry seemed pleased with Draco’s answer. “Her?” Harry asked, chasing a crumb of carrot cake around his plate. “Something you know that you’re not telling me? I didn’t think you believed in Molly and your mum’s wise-woman act?”
“You’d curse our poor child to a Hufflepuff fate before they were even born?” Draco quipped in reply, looking down at the collection that Harry had already amassed. “I’d have thought that you’d be burgundy and gold all the way.”
"The thing is, I don't know. Part of me feels like I can never forgive the things he did. I mean, Ron, he
“The Quidditch accident,” Draco supplied, memories of that significant day flashing through his mind, just as they always did whenever they were mentioned. “I was there. But Mr Weasley-”
. Purity will always conquer.” He paused, watching a witch and her three small, and very rambunctious children. “That’s carved into stone at Malfoy Manor. I was always intended to be a father, Harry. Just not like this.”
"It's fine," Harry says. "I just… I don't really know what my dad's family ate. I don't even know what part of India they're from. No one ever told me."
Harry focuses on the room around him, to stave off the panic building inside his chest: the white tiles of the backsplash, the fruit bowl on the counter, the plant on top of the fridge. All the cast iron pots and pans on the shelf above, the wood of the table.
Stepping over, Harry gave Draco an entirely unrepentant and somewhat sentimental smile. “Your husband?” Harry queried, taking Draco’s wrist and stroking it, forcing him to look up and meet the other wizard’s eyes. “Seems I’m not the only wizard guilty of letting a few misapprehensions go, Draco.”
A couple of cloves of garlic follow the onions and then Other Harry is looking around the kitchen, eyes stopping on Harry. Harry knows he can’t see him, but it still makes him feel antsy. Odd. Watched. Just like earlier.
Then Malfoy takes Harry to wizarding antique shops, looking for a mirror to "brighten up" his bedroom but all the mirrors insult Harry's hair which Malfoy finds endlessly amusing and they end up going to about twenty different shops, Malfoy repeating the latest insult the whole way. Harry never finds a mirror but he does buy a twinkling mobile of crystal moths for Luna's birthday and a glowing snowy owl lamp made from layers of carved abalone shell to put on his bedside table.
"Well, as utterly delightful as it is to stand here basking in your bruteish company, perhaps we could be on our way?"
"D'you think you're supposed to eat the sprig?" Harry asks Ron, holding up a lavender and earl grey cupcake.
"Harry," Neville starts, and then stops. He stands up to his full height, much taller than Harry remembers from before the war and says in a strong voice that Harry also doesn't remember from before the war, "He shouldn't be here."
Next on the agenda was upstairs. Draco had insisted that he absolutely must have a dressing room all of his own. He discovered to his intense pleasure that all of his clothes had been put away neatly in the walk-in wardrobe of a large, pale yellow bedroom.
There wasn’t a Thestral in hell’s chance of Harry making it anywhere close to his bedroom –crikey, where had
The croissant was a taste sensation, sumptuous and buttery, and it vanished into Draco’s mouth as efficiently as any
would have a field day. Idly, Draco stroked the velvety feathers of the small bird – Elianna, according to her tag – and gave her a couple of treats as a reward.
"Thanks," Malfoy says drily. "If it helps, I don't think Longbottom should be angry with you. He should be angry with me."
Draco Malfoy is objectively beautiful. Harry can’t say he has ever considered it before, but he can’t deny it now. Not after what he’s seen.
It was gorgeous, and Draco saw stars at the first warm touch. A single digit mapped the long furrow of his arse, slowly tracing the contours of his arsehole. With each subsequent stroke, Harry delved deeper, taking his time, investigating cautiously. Draco made an inarticulate groan of pleasure as Harry skimmed the most sensitive part of him.
Harry lets himself be held by his two best friends, profoundly relieved and grateful that they'd go anywhere with him and that now they want him to go anywhere with them.
"Fine," Harry says, defeated. "Fine, you should come. Just don't get mad at me when it's a disaster."
The butter melts on the bread and he breathes in slowly, letting himself enjoy it. He waits for the kettle to boil. He finds a jar of honey in the pantry and brings it out, slathering it on his second piece of toast.
They're saved further awkwardness by their timely arrival at the restaurant and Harry breathes a sigh of relief that they don't have to talk about Lucius Malfoy.
Bracing himself for quiet words of rejection, Draco dropped his mother’s hand. The two of them contemplated each other, and only then did Narcissa speak.
Harry had a lot of time between realizing he liked boys and actually being with one to fantasize about all the ways he'd like to touch and be touched, but he never thought being fed strawberries could feel so good, could make him feel so cared for. It's the same feeling Harry gets about the perfectly sweetened porridge, that this is what it must be like to be a beloved, precious thing, a feeling Harry's had so little of in his life. Harry still can't believe it's Malfoy making him feel this way.
"Yes, so let's skip the horrifying trip down Voldemort Lane for today and get back to kissing because there are plenty of ways for you to see I'm different now, one of which is that I previously would have only bruised you with my fists, whereas now"—Malfoy puts his lips back against Harry's neck—"I use other methods."
Harry tries to wind up the Extendable Ear but it's yanked out of his grasp and he looks up to see Malfoy in the window smugly holding it up.
“Your feelings don’t matter?” Greg asked, gesturing defeat with his hands, “Because they fucking ought to, Draco. They fucking ought to! I saw how despondent you were after he slept with you, and when he said that you were a mistake. After he told you that he didn’t want anything serious. Then, with a wave of Potter’s magic wand,
“That smells absolutely splendid,” Draco said, wanting to show how much he appreciated Harry’s gesture.
is an understatement,” Draco interrupted, still feeling upset. He broke their embrace, and tentatively spread his hands over the bump that filled his lap, proudly spilling between the vanquished fastenings of his trousers. He splayed out his fingers, bewildered by just how big he suddenly felt. “Perhaps gigantic might be a more appropriate word.”
Harry had brought other things too: a new pillow that he vowed would help Draco to sleep better, a luxurious bath elixir that smelt sharp and citrusy, and even a baby blanket, embroidered with tiny Snitches that flew and danced around the material. It was a beautiful piece of craft, and must have cost a dozen Galleons. Draco told Harry off for the extravagance – he wasn’t even out of the first trimester yet! – but Harry had only shrugged.
There were other faces that Draco recognised. Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan stood somewhere green, laughing into the camera, chinking their glasses together. Neville Longbottom, looking far more beardy that Draco remembered him, stood outside one of the Hogwarts Greenhouses. Merlin, but there were even pictures of Hagrid, his hair greyer nowadays, but otherwise every bit as scruffy as he’d ever been.
Draco allowed himself to be convinced. Harry led him through meandering corridors until they came to a small, comfy room. The double bed took up nearly all of the floor and it was covered in a patchwork quilt, made of a dozen different – and generally Gryffindor-hued – fabrics.
Draco couldn’t control his shakes, and he felt himself quiver all over. He’d come like this; come with Harry’s mouth on his penis. He knew he would. He was already close.
They walk side by side silently, shoulders brushing sometimes. Harry wonders aloud if it's going to rain and Malfoy merely grunts. Harry wonders how far to the village and Malfoy gives him a clipped "fifteen minutes." Harry wonders what they're having for lunch and Malfoy outright ignores him.
“Please don’t,” Draco answered, meeting Harry’s lips halfway, and gasping into them. Fuck, but Harry was a good kisser. Draco supposed that he ought to have known the other Seeker would be great at this. The wizard kissed exactly as he flew; wild, impetuous, and uninhibited, and Draco felt the edges of his reality start to slip away.
“Are you staying the night?” Draco asked, when Harry returned a couple of minutes later. Suddenly he was terribly sleepy, his orgasm divesting him of the last of his day’s adrenaline. “It’s past midnight,” he added, as if that fact alone might seal the deal for a wizard who could Apparate home in an instant.
the remote, the flick of his wand and the tickle of his magic awoke him. “I’m sorry,” Harry whispered, moving to sit up a little straighter. “I wasn’t going to wake you, Draco. I was going to get you a blanket. You looked far too gorgeous asleep. Like a blond, expectant Sleeping Beauty.”
Harry shuffles around not knowing what to do. He's never been someone's security guard before. He's pretty sure he doesn't need to hover at Malfoy's elbow but he doesn't know where to hover instead. His body feels awkward, like he's taking up too much space, especially in comparison to Malfoy, who seems like he knows exactly what to do.
Redoubling his focus, Draco made an effort to be present in the moment. The time had come for the scan, and he didn’t want to let his foolish, niggling thoughts sully their special moment.
“It’s referring to the baby,” Draco concluded. “Pretty gigantic bloody surprise, that. I’ve been thinking, and yes. I’m going ahead with the pregnancy. It’s entirely fucking terrifying, but there we are. At least I’ve got a few months to get used to the idea.” There was a moment of shocked silence, and Draco watched his two mates school their faces in a very Slytherin manner. Draco supposed that he had surprised them both, coming out with it like that without any warning. “Not even first in the gang,” Draco joked nervously. “Pans and Theo beat me to it. Parkinson will be vexed that I’ve taken the shine off her.”
What was it that Goyle had said, back on Tuesday? There was a 24-hour Apothecary on Artemista Alley? He could Floo there from the fireplace in the hotel reception and be back in ten minutes. Nobody would be any the wiser. Draco’s inner-Slytherin was satisfied, and he slid out of bed. It was a flawless plan.
Marcus returned before Draco could answer, a bottle of pumpkin juice in his hand. He placed it in Draco’s hand, and plonked himself down on the settee beside Greg.
Draco knew about flying. He knew about drinking, and take-aways, and forgetting to call Mother as often as he should. He didn’t keep regular hours. He wasn’t
As his hand touches the familiar almost-liquid-silky-soft fabric that he recognises as his Invisibility Cloak, he hears voices outside chatting animatedly, the old click-snick of the front door unlocking, and people stepping inside the house. Saying a prayer to thank whoever is in charge of his neverending luck, he pulls the cold fabric out of the cupboard, wraps it around himself and shuts the cupboard door, just in time for Draco Malfoy to walk into the living room.
"There," Malfoy repeats, getting the measuring cups out. "Now before you open your mouth and make a mess of this conversation I
Before long, Harry and he were panting, and Harry pulled back for a moment to catch his breath. Then, gently, he nudged Draco’s shoulder until he was lying on his back. Draco watched as the dark-haired wizard moved to sit between his legs. Harry’s eyes were dark and lust-blown, and his hand was hovering above the swell of Draco’s bump.
“I did, early on,” Draco said, taking a sip. “I think it’s all vanished now, thank Merlin… I’m feeling good at the moment. I’m nowhere near as tired as I was, and the baby is fluttering all the time. It’s all starting to get very real now, especially with Harry here buying up half of Wizkid’s Emporium earlier this week.”
Harry calms his breathing and can finally make out some of the words being said, the fog in his head clearing, slowly.
"I'm not being 'churlish'. I had the bare minimum of necessary nutrition fed to me, usually in the form of scraps. The first time I got to eat until I was full was at Hogwarts. So if it didn't come in a discounted, dented tin of soup, it wasn't on my plate, alright?"
Harry opens the cupboard and finds a box of Wix Wheaties and goes in search of milk in Malfoy's cold cupboard which is large enough for Harry to stand in. Of course there aren't any cartons. Everything is neatly nestled in ceramic bowls and glass jars, preservation charms shimmering faintly around them.
The moment didn’t last. Harry must have come to his senses because he shook his head, theatrically breaking their moment. “Merlin,” he said, taking Draco’s hand lightly. “We’re going to be late. Come on, Malfoy. We’ve only got a few minutes and we need to get a wiggle on. We’ll miss our appointment at this rate.”
Still, Draco knew her words came from a place of love, and that she’d been quietly excited for grandchildren ever since he came of age to marry. Unfortunately, the fact of his baby wasn’t the only news he had to impart. The far more shocking fact was still to come.
"I'm not malleable," Harry says, but without much feeling because he's focusing on casting the lightest possible warming charm on the butter.
"No Potter. That's exactly what this is. Or you regret kissing me and you want some evidence for why it's ok. And I swear to Merlin and Circe both I won't—"
Harry’s exploring is interrupted by loud meowing coming from the upper floors. Soon enough, a gorgeous black cat leisurely makes its way onto the landing and down the stairs, complaining loudly about Harry’s presence. Harry’s well experienced with Crookshanks’ crankiness so he stays still and waits to see what this cat’s temperament is like. The meowing doesn’t stop, but at least it doesn’t turn to hissing. The cat stops right in front of him at the bottom of the stairs and watches him inquisitively, big green eyes looking at Harry’s own. Then, the cat must decide this Harry doesn’t smell or look too different from the Harry it knows, and it stretches on his back paws, front paws reaching up to Harry’s jeans.
As Harry catches his breath he notices there are cupcakes covering every counter in Malfoy's kitchen. "What the fuck?" he says again, this time much quieter. Malfoy still hears it though and crosses his arms.
Trudging off the pitch, the thin March sunshine beginning to set, Draco hadn’t been surprised at the result. Had he been a gambling man, he might have placed a couple of Galleons against Puddlemere too.
Harry wakes up to the buzz of his wand in his pocket and after several months of being an Auror, that's enough to jolt him awake, roll out of the hospital bed and throw on the cloak as the door to Malfoy's room opens. He stands out of the way in the corner while a Trainee Healer in bright purple robes runs a series of diagnostic tests on Malfoy, presumably understanding the series of faint lights emitted above Malfoy's body as she takes notes. She leaves without waking Malfoy and Harry follows her out the door.
Today wasn’t a date. It was a simple case of acclimatisation. He needed to get used to Harry through small, incremental steps. Today was simply the first footstep on a very long journey.
"You're going to say asinine things about taking responsibility," Malfoy says wearily. "The thing is, I didn't make a single choice for myself growing up. My food was always served to me. I never chose what or how much. Never ordered my own food at a restaurant. I wasn't allowed snacks. I didn't know what my favorite food was. Literally everything was decided for me. My clothes, my hair, my friends, my future wife, my career, the different greetings I had to rehearse for each and every guest at our parties. I didn't even choose my own
"Yes but I'll know. I'll lie awake at night thinking about how the Savior is so modest and self-sacrificing that he bought himself the ugliest plainest white plates to match his boring pure white soul."
They Floo from Harry's to the Manor, coming out the grate in Malfoy's cold, dark and cavernous drawing room. Their steps no longer echo, given the richly carpeted corridors but the Manor still feels cold and lonely to Harry. He doesn't know how Malfoy can stand it.
Harry’s face was a little tight, and the set of his shoulders was a little tense, but he nodded his agreement and Draco was too bushed to question him. He felt the shift in the mattress as Harry joined him.
“There were a lot of pages in the book about magical signatures, and our magic combining together,” Harry said with a shrug, “and if I’m being truly, entirely honest, I didn’t understand most of it.” He smiled then, a genuinely fond grin, and Draco felt his heart skip a beat. It ought to be illegal to look that attractive, and he
With the sauce simmering on a low heat and the fettuccine cooking away, Other Harry sits at the table, pulling a chair next to Malfoy and they go through the catalogue together.
Malfoy picks up a half dozen eggs and sets them and his packets of yeast on the counter, smiling at the man like he might bite off Malfoy's fingers.
paparazzi hanging back, pretending to look at the window display of Madam Primpernelle’s Beautifying Potions. He stepped beside Harry, feeling suddenly vulnerable.
Draco's kitchen smells like heaven, specifically bacon and cinnamon. Harry can smell it from down the hall. He lurks just outside the doorway for a long moment lamenting that he has no idea what to say to Draco about the night before; mostly because he has no idea what he
"What about this one?" Malfoy asks, holding up a blanket with rainbow iridescent yarn. "These are very trendy right now."
“It’s still a surprise,” Draco answered. “And I’m starving. I hope you’ve got chocolate syrup too, Harry. A pancake isn’t a pancake without syrup. It’s barely even breakfast. Can I do anything? Shall I set the table?”
"You're sure? You haven't even complained about Malfoy today." At Ron's words Hermione breaks off her conversation with Fleur, turning fully in her seat to listen. In fact, it seems the whole table is tuning in, Ginny is halfway on the table to look round George.
"Are you going to get angry again? Let me know before I bloom the spices because it's a delicate step."
He’s sitting down to write when Ron comes back, passing him a quill and sitting across from him, a confused look on his face.
"Sure, he switched sides, I don't care. Don't you remember how awful he was to us? The constant teasing and bullying?"
a wizard – and so he cast a Cushioning Charm inside my tee-shirt! I virtually died of mortification on the spot, but Harry didn’t mind a Sickle. He’s got this bloody baby book –
Harry's leaning against the counter trying to decide if this latest bottle of wine is as drinkable as the bottle Andrea gave them in Siena. He decides it's not as drinkable but that he still intends to drink a lot of it because Malfoy and Hermione's heated history discussion is driving him spare.
“These modern potions are very accurate,” Braithwaite answered. Draco had to take his hat off to the wizard. He was good at his job. He didn’t sound even the slightest bit surprised at Draco’s tale. “So, in that respect, it’d be unprofessional of me not to manage your expectations. It is highly likely that you’re pregnant. There is, however, a spell that will tell us for sure.” He gave Draco a reassuring nod. “Unfortunately, I’m not an expert in wizard pregnancy, so if we do get a positive confirmation, then I’ll have to write you a referral to St Mungo’s where you’ll be managed by their Paternity Department. Does everything about that sound reasonable?”
Draco thought that he would, very much, like a glass of his favourite Merlot, but he’d been told by Mediwitch Hayes that alcohol of any sort was strictly verboten. “Just a glass of water, please,” he answered. “Is Mother in good spirits?”
“You’re pregnant,” Harry said, kneeling down, and undoing the laces of Draco’s shoes. “You’re allowed.”
On parchment, Whitsand Bay, Cornwall, had been the home that Draco had felt most excited about. It was a gorgeous dwelling, with a view of the shiny blue sea from the vast windows in the living room.
“There were lot of gnarled, twisted old Wards on the place when I first moved in,” Harry said, showing Draco the basement. “And they took forever to cut down. I even had to get a Cursebreaker to come in from the Ministry.” Harry shook his head, bemused. “This place used to be Orion Black’s wine cellar. There was nothing left when I moved in except a few dusty corks littering the floor, and spiders as big as your hand.” Harry shivered as he spoke. “They’d definitely been magicked with some sort of Dark spell. It took an eternity for me to get rid of them.”
Pansy was talking her normal romanticised twaddle, and Draco rolled his eyes. He’d always kept his crush on Harry well-guarded and hidden at school, and Pans was talking a fat lot of nonsense about the pair of them being as hopeless as each other.
The loud sound of the Floo chiming stopped Molly before her tongue ran away with her, and the whole party, Draco included, swung around to look at who had arrived. Hemione Granger stepped out of the fireplace. The witch brought with her the scent of smoke as she stepped into the room amid a loud chorus of greetings.
Draco was pleased that Harry was being so candid. Like every other wizard in England he’d heard of James Potter, of how he and his wife had sacrificed themselves for Harry.
"I would've thought you'd make more fancy French food. Coq au vin and boeuf bourguignon and stuff like that."
The bullpen is buzzing with activity like always, memos flying overhead and the dings and buzzes of various alarms and wards set all over the British aisles, Aurors ducking in and out of offices and striding here and there to different desks. Harry steps out of the elevator feeling like he can't catch his breath. Looking out across the busy floor Harry starts to feel light headed. He swallows hard, wishing he could sit down. Then he sees a head of flaming red hair and Harry feels like he can breathe again. He'll tell Ron and Ron will know what to do. Ron never loses his head in a crisis.
Harry holds his hands up. "Alright, alright, Merlin. You make the rock cakes and I'll bring everything to the gazebo, yeah?"
Harry smiles. Hermione has recently come out as bi and Ron is on track to become 1999's Best Bisexual Ally.
“I told you I wasn’t. There was so much going on back then,” Other Harry says. “But I think so. Either today or tomorrow.”
tears about? The boy you used to go halfway around the castle just to hiss insults at, Draco?” She made a humming noise. “Fourteen weeks? That was just about the time your horrendous losing streak ended, love. Don’t tell me it was some drunken consolation thing. Oh Gods, it
. In the end, even if he feels a little guilty, he decides he needs to know more about the world he is in before he goes marching into the Ministry to ask them to help him go back to whatever universe he disappeared from.
Harry looks at Ron trying to decide if he's drunk. He typically gets very red underneath his freckles when he drinks and Harry can see pale skin, so that theory is out. He's trying to think of another theory, anything really, to explain Ron's behavior, when Malfoy says, "I'll be there," in the same voice he used when he was eleven and challenging Harry to a midnight duel. Harry only just resists the urge to put his face in his hands.
The kitchen is bright in the exact way Harry wishes his was. Harry takes his time here — his eyes lingering on the way the sun shines through the clean windows, his hands feeling the warm wood of the big dining table on their palms. He smells the fresh bouquet of flowers on the white vase by the sink, and marvels at the rows of jars, tins and boxes full of food in the pantry. Harry loves this beautiful Grimmauld Place the other Harry has created. Harry hadn’t considered it was even possible to walk down these same corridors and not feel a shiver creeping up his spine, or with the fear that with every step the perpetually rotten floor will collapse under him and activate some ridiculous Black Family curse.
"No you can't skip the Goblin Wars of 1642, that's when the modern monetary system became unified and streamlined."
.” She looked briefly at Harry. “This’ll be your first time,” Hayes added, addressing him. “Has Draco described the spell to you in much detail?”
“Oh no,” Greg cut in, clueless and cheerful as always, “you’ve got the wrong end of the wand! Draco and me, we’re not… I’m not into blokes. I’ve got a girlfriend. Millie Bulstrode? Been together years. Going to have a big bonding ceremony next year.”
The two of them had gone around the cauldron trying to think of names but nothing had seemed to fit or suit. Constellations or flower names weren’t really appropriate: nothing about their child's existence had been conventional so far, so why should their name be? Besides, this was their family, and Draco wanted to make new traditions.
“I’m- We’re only eleven weeks in,” Draco replied, making an effort to be inclusive. “They’re too little to feel yet, Harry. I might feel a few flutters soon enough but proper movements won’t be for a while.” Harry made a noise of agreement, and the two of them ate companionably for a few minutes.
"Did you know Hermione trapped Rita Skeeter in a jar when we were fourteen? I doubt I'll have much trouble."
“Okay,” Malfoy says, and, crossword and pen tidily put away in his bedside table drawer, he gets up, picks up a small pile of clothing from the big armchair in the corner, and says to his bed companion, “I’m just gonna put all of these in the wash. Just in case.”
gossip pages. Louis swapped girlfriends more often than Draco changed his socks, and yet he still managed to catch the Snitch with alarming regularity. Even worse, Louis was a glossy Gryffindor; a fan favourite. He didn’t have Draco’s uncomfortable past, Dark Mark, or his ruined family name.
Harry marks the next few days by Malfoy's take out requests. Malfoy asks for caesar salad with grilled shrimp and garlic bread, he's craving pan roasted fish with romesco sauce and steamed broccoli, he wants fruit salad but without any melon or grapes, he's dying for crepes with comte and jammy red onions. Harry goes all over the city, sometimes to two or three restaurants to patch together Malfoy's requests. It passes the time.
Their baby existed in the here and now, and they had already grown to the size of a blueberry. Unbeknownst to Draco's predicament, the elves had left a box of the tiny fruit under
Draco promised himself that he’d Firecall Harry as soon as he got home but upon arrival at Half-Moon Place, he decided to read his leaflets with a cup of tea.
Draco shook his head despairingly. “Greg and Millie are at the Bulstrode place in Cornwall,” Draco replied, wondering for the millionth time in his life why everything with Pansy had to turn to drama. “I’m not joshing, Parks. I really am enceinte. Fourteen weeks in. I can show you the
Draco smiled, and pressed another kiss onto Harry’s lips. “We’re both wonderful,” he said, taking Harry’s hand and guiding it to the swell of his middle. “Though her flutters are quite strong at the moment. Possibly she’s responding to your magic.” He laughed, feeling a little self-conscious once again. “She won’t have had such a big dose of it since the moment she was conceived.”
A drawer in the entrance hall cabinet is filled with a peculiar assortment of things: a flyer for an exhibition at the Tate Magique, an embroidered handkerchief with the initials D. L. M. (of course, even in an alternative universe, Malfoy is the kind of poncy twat to have his initials stitched on a handkerchief), a deck of cards made of Hearts and Spades only, and a crumpled up recipe for a breakfast potato hash written in oddly familiar handwriting standing out to him.
As always, the Mediwix – Healer Braithwaite, fresh from St Mungo’s – was kind and welcoming. Draco wasn’t one for malingering, especially on the day of an important game, so it was obvious to the team Mediwix that it was a serious matter.
Malfoy tsks. "Of course not. It's a Depression-era recipe. Things like eggs and butter were hard to get so people tried other things."
“Ah, I see that Harry has joined us too.” Hayes said, giving the other wizard a nod. “I’m really pleased to see the pair of you. The twelve-week scan really is a delightful experience.”
It was a snowy owl, much like the one that Draco remembered Harry having back at school and, when he opened his window, the bird swooped in sedately and landed on his table. There was a message tied to his leg. The roll of parchment was small, and Draco removed it, wondering what the wonder wizard had forgotten to say to him in the café.
Still, the band had something about them that Draco found appealing – something soft, something melodic – and when Harry had begun singing “here comes the sun,” in that dreadful, tuneless voice, of his, the breath had caught in Draco’s throat.
thing you can do is touch a pregnant wix’s bump without their permission, and that’s exactly what I did.” Harry was anguished and his expression reluctant when his gaze flickered towards the door. “I’ll go if you want. Merlin’s balls! I’m such a stupid, hot-headed git! Do you want me to leave? I’ll go, if that’s what you want.”
The next few days were equally full. Greg was busy with the rest of the Puddlemere players, getting prepped for their game against Appleby the following weekend, so Draco filled his time organising his flat. He read books that had sat on his shelves for an age and vegged out in front of the Muggle television that was suddenly, and surprisingly, addictive.
“Good to know the nameless wizard was useful for something,” Harry interjected, smiling. “What about the baby? Have you felt anything yet, or…? I mean, I don’t…”
Best Dressed Wizard Awards last year. Louis St Clare had won, but Draco was determined not to dwell on that little fact either.
that Louis St Clare might win International Seeker of the Year, a prize that Draco had been coveting forever. Draco had imagined getting on a broom, wondered briefly whether he’d even get it off the ground, and had sobbed until his head had ached. Harry had told him off for upsetting himself so badly and then brought him a cup of sweet tea, told him that he’d be back in the air in no time, and then kissed Draco on the forehead.
Draco patted his mouth with his serviette, his dinner finished. “I’m as ready as I’ll ever be,” Draco answered, amused. He let his hands drift down to his bump. “I’ll wear my new pregnancy trousers; they’ve got growing charms knitted into the material. They sound like a prerequisite.”
He didn’t want to be the one to make a first move though, not here, not in their child’s bedroom, in Grimmauld Place. For a moment Harry looked like he was about to lean in and close the space between them, but all he did was take the toy from Draco’s hand. Harry placed it back on the shelf, and Draco let out a breath, too loud, and far too disappointed.
Adrianne had already magicked Narcissa’s sherry and Draco’s water to the green drawing room, and the pair of them sipped their drinks and swapped pleasantries while they waited.
The place was scruffy, and mismatched, but that didn’t matter. Draco could see the potential of the place immediately, and could see how he’d slot in within its walls.
Harry hears their steps coming up the stairs, and tucks himself into a corner of the bedroom, under a big framed photograph of Teddy, between the wall and the bathroom door.
“Salazar’s fucking eyeball!” she cried out; feigning being scandalised but blatantly enjoying herself. “You’re not fibbing are you, Malfoy? You dark bloody horse! Oh my
Draco’s emotions felt muddled at Hayes’s words. He knew that he ought to feel overjoyed at the revelation that his and Harry’s magic was so compatible – he supposed that it must be, they had only been intimate a single time, and that had resulted in a baby – and that their child’s magic would be strong as a result.
Adrianne would be naught but Mother’s spy, but she’d always been his favourite elf, and would have followed him to Half-Moon Place before now, had Draco only have asked.
Draco turned into the Left Wing of the Manor. Growing up, this part of the building had been his mother’s domain and even now it was the place that Draco felt the most comfortable.
This time, Draco was better prepared for the spell casting. Hayes had a much surer touch than Braithwaite. Rather than a thousand pinpricks, all Draco felt was a rich, comforting heat that curled though every cell of his body.
He fills the caffettiera with water and dutifully grinds the beans in his small hand crank grinder—he'll be happy to do this part with magic once he's allowed. Grounds in the caffettiera, he sets it on the stove and sits at the table, waiting for the telltale gurgle of coffee. Today he pours a measure of cream into the cow creamer first because he feels like being fancy, and uses a slender tea spoon to stir the cream in. Coffee in hand he starts unpacking the basket.
Harry wants to keep watching; he needs to witness this never ending choreography of sleeping positions. The way they hook their ankles together, the way Other Harry’s hand grabs for Malfoy in the night.
Harry does think there's something there about responsibility. Harry never got to choose what he ate growing up but he still decided not to be a Death Eater. But perhaps because Malfoy expects him to zero in on culpability, Harry defiantly doesn't want to. Instead he says, "I never got to choose what to eat either. It was always scraps and leftovers, if anything. But they made me cook for them which is probably why I don't like cooking."
picture from the first St. Mungo’s appointment that Harry had attended. The second was of a couple, dancing in the late autumn sunshine. Leaves fell around them, and their love was palpable. Draco picked up it.
“He will stand by you, always. I know you don’t believe me now, but he will. Make an effort with his friends, too. Right now, where you are, he’s hiding himself just as much as you are. And Parkinson is really not bad once you get to know her.
“Arthur, have you seen…” Harry began, only realising halfway through his sentence that Draco was sat at the table. Their eyes met, and the look of consternation that had coloured his face slowly faded away like it had never been. “Thank Merlin,” he said, sliding into the seat beside Draco. “When you weren’t in the spare room I got flustered. Thought that blasted article had upset you more than I’d realised, or maybe that you’d gone home. I already felt guilty… Bloody game went on far longer than I’d imagined. Bloody George must’ve used a trick Snitch, or something… Anyway, I’m sorry. You managed to get back to the kitchen without a problem?”
“Hermione,” Harry cut in, holding out his hand, his face stern. “Draco and I, we knew there’d be headlines. We’ve talked about this. It’s part and parcel of being a public persona. It's nothing that we both haven't faced a hundred times before.”
“Oh, Merlin,” Draco murmured, skimming through the front-page article. He put his hand on his bump, feeling a small fluttering as the baby reacted to his nervous energy. “Your other daddy has been talking to Barnabus Cuffe,” Draco told them, flipping the cover over to read the rest of the article. “He’s an entirely endearing prat. Don’t you dare be this impulsive.”
Draco nodded, and followed her down the corridor. Her office was warm and welcoming, and there were pictures of several rather pink and very new babies pinned to her wall. A month ago, the sight would have horrified Draco, but today he found their screwed-up, new-born faces heartening.
"Oh," Harry says, disappointed Malfoy isn't saying more and isn't that a brand new and disturbing feeling?
Pansy smirked. “Narcissa Black-Malfoy is a wise witch and I’ve never known her be wrong about anything to do with you.”
He is lost in the way Other Harry’s back arches, and his hands grasp for the bedsheet under him, the way Draco whispers praise to him, and his hands run over Other Harry’s side reverently. Draco pulls Harry up by the hips until he’s on his hands and knees and Harry feels the urge to grab Other Harry’s hands. To close the distance between them and just hold his hands down while Draco fucks into him, hips stuttering, eyelids fluttering in pleasure. He very nearly does, when Other Harry looks up like he’d done earlier and his eyes stop exactly where Harry is, even though Harry knows the Cloak can’t fail.
"This is a crisis! I can't put them through the Floo! Have you ever Flooed with a frosted cupcake? It's a disaster."
Harry squeezes himself into a corner, hoping he is well out of the way and watches them. Malfoy takes the food out of the fridge, the cupboard, the pantry, and Harry is quite afraid his stomach will rumble at the sight of fresh fruit and veggies, and at the gorgeous smell of frying onions and garlic as Other Harry starts dinner.
He hummed to Beatles songs as he showered, and then enjoyed the delicious breakfast of scrambled eggs and orange juice that Adrianne had made for him. “Master Draco is looking very cheerful,” the elf said, as she Levitated the plate over to where he sat at the kitchen table, and he smiled. Not only did he look cheerful, but he felt it too. He dispatched Adrianne back to the Manor for the day, telling her to go and visit her parents, and making her promise not to gossip
His heart was thumping in his chest. He’d forgotten something, something of great consequence, but for the life of him he couldn’t remember… It was only when he caught sight of himself in a mirror that a stark, horrible awareness dawned upon him. He’d forgotten his baby. Put her down, and left her, and…
He’d had sex with Harry, and used an old condom and a dodgy spell, and as a result he’d gotten pregnant. They’d only been together once, but that had been enough, and Draco had been left with a memento that he’d have for a lifetime.
"Malfoy. Malfoy does. And now me, because you know what? I like a real plate. He's gotten to me, Ron. I've been compromised."
It was still very early days in his pregnancy, and he knew he had every right to ask for the Pennyroyal Potion when he went for his appointment. It was a powerful, effective abortifacient and would end his pregnancy with the minimum of fuss. That might be the best option for him and Harry both.
Harry looks around his kitchen forlornly for twenty minutes before he decides take out is the only palatable decision for tonight and owls Ron for his preference.
"Merlin help me, I'm not ready for a world where Malfoy is more culturally sensitive than Hermione," Ron says.
Malfoy seems to know exactly what to do though, picking various blooms and pink leafed branches and holding them up at different angles and trimming their stems and adding feathery fronds until he has a gorgeous bouquet he hands to Harry with a kiss. Then he does it again, kiss included.
Draco didn’t know what to say to that. He chewed his green bean slowly, trying to kill time before he answered. The idea of Molly Weasley clucking over him, and the brothers Weasley staring at his tummy like he was a Muggle circus freak wasn’t appealing in the slightest. Draco was sure that there’d be a dozen loaded comments before they even got sat at the table. The Weasleys were, however, the nearest thing that Harry had to a family, and they were going to be an integral part of his little one’s life. A part of him felt chuffed that Harry cared enough to want them all to have a constructive relationship.
Malfoy is awake, sitting up in bed with a tray of food in front of him that he's picking at. He looks up as Harry walks in, a smile taking over his face, the kind that crinkles his eyes, a smile even brighter than a perfect frangipane scones smile and the sight stops Harry in his tracks for a moment. He looks so young and sweet and perfect, swimming in the overlarge hospital gown, his hair a mess.
