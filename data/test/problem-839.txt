“Yeah, Harry,” he drawled the name out in a rather sexy voice, if Harry may say so himself. “Are you sure you can handle it?”
Harry grunted in acknowledgement before slowing down a bit to adjust himself while making sure to continue hitting that spot. He nestled his head in the crook of Draco’s neck, licking a small stripe up the exposed skin before nipping at it, marking him.
“Harry,” Draco’s soft voice echoed through the slightly furnished room. Harry stopped in his tracks to turn and face the other man, his heart stuttering for some odd reason as it was the first time Draco used his given name.
The hand that was brushing over his hip dipped lower, bypassing Draco’s hardened cock and cupping his bollocks, massaging them with his fingers. One finger, however, strayed past and slid lower until it was rested flat over his entrance.
“Well, with all the time I spend with you, we might as well be that married couple that got together out of a pact,” Harry laughed.
He gestured to one of the free sofas and they both sat down, closer than Harry was expecting but somehow not close enough for his liking. “Got tired of hearing Pansy talk about Witch Weekly?”
“I’m not bloody taking notes for you,” Ron grumbled. “Couldn’t stay awake to do it last time so don’t expect anything now.”
“Fuck!” he yelped, pulling his burnt hand away from the hot metal. He forced his eyes to refocus on the task at hand and checked the damage before ditching the food and making his way to the sink so he could run the burn under cold water.
“You have no idea,” Draco groaned, throwing his head back and exposing the pale expanse of his neck, leaving Harry to stare hopelessly. “Are you sure you’re having fun, though? It’s quite hard to believe when it looked like you were just standing all confused in the middle of the room.”
his story, do we?” Harry pointed out, causing Ron to give him a sharp. “Look, I just don’t want to make the same mistake I did with Snape.”
Suddenly, he felt the potion drip through the hairs on his scalp, caught at the base by Draco’s hand so the excess didn’t go to waste. Harry let out a violent shudder despite the previous warning and resisted the urge to squirm and distract the man that had volunteered to help him.
“I don’t know,” he waved his hand vaguely. “Something. I got us some lamb too, I guess.” He got up and left their dinner on the kitchen island carelessly before walking down the stairs that lead to his lab. Clearly he didn't care for dinner as much as Harry did.
At that moment, Harry wasn’t sure if he wanted to hit Neville because how could he touch the other man so casually and tell him to stop smiling at Draco like that, or thank him because Draco let out the most adorable giggle, causing his cheeks to pinken.
Really, he should know by now that Harry was just as stubborn and insistent as he was in getting half an hour more of sleep. He ought to write a book.
Harry’s eyes widened. So Draco’s been studying at Wizarding schools since he was 7? That did explain why he was so… academic.
That last statement left a sour taste in Harry’s mouth, but he watched the other man’s retreating figure make its way through the doorway.
“Right, sure,” Harry sighed in relief, not quite believing his best friend but choosing to do so anyway if only to save himself from feeling embarrassed.
When he peeked through the hair that had fallen over his eyes, he saw that Harry’s head was thrown back in pleasure. He didn’t notice when Draco’s head began to lower until a small puff of breath washed over his sensitive skin.
Draco, who probably noticed the still-quite-confused expression on his face, must have took pity on him and grabbed a knife. To end his life right there and thereby end his suffering? Perhaps. But no, instead he turned towards the plant and started scraping the surface of its leaves delicately.
“The order of which you said that is mildly concerning regarding what you think my priorities are?” Harry pointed out, not wanting to think too much on the fact that Draco is with Neville right now, possibly being asked out on a date.
“You’re Harry Potter, are you not?” the new figure’s voice was silky and smooth with the barest hint of a French lilt. His face was even more beautiful up close, but his expression was  unreadable.
“Before the food is brought out,” McGonagall casted a sonorous once everyone was seated. “I would like to thank you all for your efforts in rebuilding this school. I’m glad to see that you share the same love for what might have been your second home while growing up as I did, and that we have been able to move forward from darker times. It heartens me to see people get over their past prejudices…”
“Nice one, mate,” Ron said proudly, patting him on the back and leaving the floor so they can start dancing.
“Gear up Arthur! I’ve just figured out how to work the thing,” Draco called out, making his way into the house.
Harry shook his head and glared at the sleeping figure before deciding that manners can fuck it all to hell, ripping the blanket off his sleeping body, not even bothering to think of the possibility that he might be naked under those sheets.
“Huh,” Harry mumbled, his mind wandering idly. He hadn't really put much thought into that. “Well, in any case, Hermione seems to like them well enough. I’m sure it’ll be fine. It’s not like they’re some blood purist or something.”
Despite the fact that he bought a cup of Draco’s favorite coffee as a peace offering, he still felt like he’d get hexed on site. With a deep breath, he stepped in the Ministry Floo and called out the address, already regretting that he agreed as the green flames engulfed him, transporting him to a familiar sitting room.
is,” Pansy drawled teasingly after giving him a small snort of laughter. “Didn’t you think about how big Potter’s rock hard co-”
He just rather enjoyed the way Draco stumbled about every morning when he couldn’t be bothered to open his eyes completely or would slur his words when he just woke up, and that-
“Thanks for agreeing to help out, Harry,” Draco said sincerely, flushing a bit and casting his glance down to the ground.
“Because it’s made of plastic,” he explained. The rest were actual chocolate or sugar candies molded into eggs, wrapped in tin and light charms to keep them clean.
He had, much to all of their friends’ amusement, been nurturing a strong crush on the man that had come to be one of his closest friends for a while now, but every time there was an opportunity to ask him out, Harry always flobbed it. Either that or Draco didn’t get the hint.
Quietly, as to not draw attention to himself if there really was nothing bad happening, he peeked his head past the corner of the building to see the large build of a short man towering over someone who appears to have fallen and was now lying on the hard pavement.
“We’re just going to apparate,” he explained when Draco glared at his outstretched hand as if it offended him. “It would make this all easier.”
“But it’s fine,” Draco rushed out, taking hold of Harry’s hands. “It should be okay after you keep going, I think.”
“Do you think you’ll be signing up to partner with one of them?” Ron leaned over the table and asked Harry.
Except he didn’t take a seat and instead flopped face down into Draco’s bedding, inhaling the soft scent that can only be described as Draco.
“Just let me make sure that you’re safe,” Harry insisted. “At least by staying with me, I would know if something happened if you don’t come back.”
And with that, she got up with all the grace that the Beauxbatons students seemed to possess with Neville following suit.
It took a second for Harry to remember what they were talking about but when he did, he felt his heart drop a little and his good mood sour.
Thanks for reading! I'll try to update as often as I can. If you're interested, I also post short fics on my
“Of course I do,” Harry said, giving him a heated look as his eyes roamed Draco’s barely-covered body. Draco’s face was burning now, but he forced himself to focus on their conversation. “But I don’t want to force you if you aren’t ready.”
Resigning himself to a night of studying and not being with Draco, Harry quietly took his books out while his friends flirted with one another and began staring blankly at the pages, unable to actually focus on the text and instead brooded on his own thoughts.
"You really brought me here to help deal with the kids, didn't you?" Harry teased while searching one of the bushes. Found one.
"Of course I do," Malfoy snorted. "Who else would I go to? Other than the few friends I've made who work in the same area as me. And they check on me often enough, at least, to make sure I'll be paying my part of the rent."
Reluctantly, because it didn’t really sound like such a bad idea, he agreed. He’s never gotten to do something like this when he was younger, anyway.
“Lie down,” Harry whispered, making room for Draco to move easily. He obeyed instantly, giving his full trust to Harry’s judgement. Even as he laid his head down on the pillow, he could see Harry watching his movements carefully, eyes roaming over his body, making him flush with pleasure.
“No, it’s not,” he confirmed, scooting closer. His softened cock came into view and Draco practically forced himself to look away, trying not to stare too hard and embarrass himself further.
No, even worse. After bringing him lunch, he asked if he wanted to come with him to the greenhouse after and do some testing on one of the plants they’ve been growing so Draco could experiment on its leaves over the weekend.
“Don’t be silly,” Hermione chuckled, taking a seat next to him. He wasn’t joking, but he wouldn’t correct her. “Draco doesn’t seem to be the type to do that.”
Ron, Seamus and Neville looked at each other briefly, with Ron and Seamus faking a gag. At least all Neville did was smile politely before getting back to his work. They had all more or less gotten used to Draco and Harry ‘dating’ after the 3rd year mark, meaning this year.
“You’re right, we should blame people like you and your family who are so far up their own arses and use money to get their way in life, even if it’s at the cost of others,” Ron exploded, finally sick of the conversation. “Running away from the war and hiding behind your own mother. People like you are the problem. I wouldn’t even be surprised if by the end of this program, you’re spouting the same bullishit Slytherin’s do. Like your father does.”
“First time,” Harry repeated, his face going blank. Worry immediately flooded in, and for a brief second, Draco thought that Harry would leave him. Either that, or make fun of him; he wasn’t sure which one he’d prefer.
“Here,” Harry offered, helping him with the tie. Draco tried to make it unobvious that he was frustrated, instead choosing to let his eyes wander off to somewhere beside their bed. “There we go,” Harry said after a few seconds. “It’s all done.”
“Sure,” Ron laughed, standing up. “Let’s go eat dinner before we run out of Roast. Hermione, I was thinking for our first games night we could-“
Realizing that what he said was not much better than his original train of thought, his face flushed and he looked down, suddenly very interested in the heart-shaped marshmallows in his drink.
“Ouch,” he mumbled, moving his head off the offending object to take a look at it. The object, as it turns out, was a hard-bound book on plants, or something. “What’s this?” he asked, holding the book up for the man on the floor to see.
“I’m only tolerating this because you just got married, but any more of this Hufflepuff shite and I will bite you,” Pansy said good-naturedly.
“Goodnight, Draco,” Harry smiled before exiting, just catching the barest hint of a smile on Draco’s face as he left.
“I think that’s in part to the fact that he was never really around his parents much,” Hermione explained, understanding his unfinished question.”Actually, he hasn’t really been around them much since he was 7, since they sent him away to study in that school in Japan.”
Harry wasn’t expecting him to, anyway. Once he was left alone, he looked across the hall and saw Draco staring back at him, a curious expression covering his face before he turned back distractedly to face Hermione and respond to whatever she was saying.
Harry rolled his eyes and carefully held Draco’s head upright, trying not to flush at how close he was kneeling to the other man. “Draco,” he called. “Wake up.”
“Good evening,” the Headmistress’s voice boomed through the hall, effectively silencing everyone. “Before we begin the sorting, I would like to welcome you all properly to Hogwarts. I hope that your year here will be much better than the last.” This earned a few uneasy chuckles and some snorts from the students, but they otherwise remained quiet. “...but should there be anything you need, do not be afraid to approach any of the Prefects or staff. Thank you for entrusting us and coming back to the school, and thank you especially to those that helped rebuild the castle over the summer. There will be more announcements after the Sorting but for now, let us welcome our First Years.”
to Draco, but at the same time he was glad that the other man felt comfortable enough around him to not be too embarrassed by possibly the best sound that could come out of him.
“Zabini, Blaise!” A man Harry recognized as the guy that joined Draco at the Slytherin table went up front and took his seat. “Slytherin!”
“Don’t be silly, Ron,” Hermione chided, brisking in with various ribbons and cloths floating behind her. “Ferrets are carnivores. Their faeces could harm the plants. They have to be herbivores for it to work.”
Sure, they were all getting along better now that they shared a common room, and Harry had even created a reluctant and slightly imposed friendship with Malfoy, who was too awkward to protest but everyone still kept to their respective houses most of the time, and no fights broke out that often anymore. Even the Slytherins were reluctantly accepted once people realized they weren’t evil after the war.
“Rather hot in here, ‘innit?” He smirked, knowing fully well that Harry was slightly red and hot still from embarrassment and...something. No need to brood on that something though, because he has a Hufflepuff to kill.
And everything went well. Malfoy was still competitive, refusing to back down from any dare or refuse a truth question. Harry, on the other hand, had backed down from breaking out to give flowers to Filch with a proposal.
She was made Head Girl while Draco was made Head Boy, something he wasn’t expecting. Apparently, Headmistress McGonagall had grown quite fond of Draco while they were working on the rebuilding and trusted him enough with this responsibility. Harry thought he deserved it, after everything. After all, throughout the summer he’s managed to prove himself to be changed and reliable, and not just for Slytherins.
“You’ll see,” Harry’s eyes glanced to the side where the 8th Year Slytherins were seating. “Muggles call it acupressure, or something like that.”
Draco nodded fervently, unabashed now that his head was swimming in pleasure and images of Harry’s whispered promises.
“What? We’re not-,” Ron sputtered, but at that point, Neville had already begun to walk away. He turned to Harry. “Why is everyone defending him?”
Neville, for a start, was one of the first few people that let go of his grudge pretty easily when Draco started trying to help him. He was the one who willingly spent time with him outside of asking for favors without Draco going up to him for company, and he was the first to declare that he genuinely likes Draco as a person.
Her head instantly snapped up to look at him, eyebrows furrowing. “Oh Harry,” she sighed, setting down her book. “We knew it was a possibility.”
Harry noticed Draco’s eyes soften a bit at what the kid said. He shook his hand and ruffled his hair affectionately before saying “You should join your friends in the hunt. Wouldn’t want to fall behind, would you?”
He wasn’t sure why, but he half-expected them to at least sit at the Gryffindor table, or even the Ravenclaw table since that’s where Draco was sorted, but instead they headed straight to the other end of the Hall where Zabini sat with Davis, pointedly ignoring them.
He was finally going to get Draco Malfoy to work on time for the first time in the past month. Draco had finally keyed him into the wards after realizing that Harry would do almost anything to break in and wake him up after that one incident where he used a broom to get in through a window.
Harry just shrugged. “They all seem to know him better than we do. Maybe we should apologize soon, though.”
“Prat,” Harry snorted, willing the blush he could feel fighting its way onto his cheeks to go away. The reason he was single wasn’t a mystery to his best friends, and that reason happens to be standing right next to him.
“I mean, sure he turned out well enough in the end, but you can’t exactly justify all the hell he’s given us before that,” Ron snorted, but he looked somewhat more sympathetic.
He was immediately pulled off the couch and lifted to his feet. Draco pulled him closer and began humming the tune of whatever song was playing, Harry was too surprised to pay attention to which song it was.
“Really?” Hermione asked, sharing his enthusiasm before their conversation took a hard turn for academics. Harry noticed Draco shift into a more comfortable position, moving his hands wildly as he spoke and just gradually becoming more animated throughout the conversation.
“Oh nothing,” he said lightly, but before Harry could prod, he quickly added “I’m just glad you came.”
Harry soon realized that it was the blond he pointed out just minutes ago, taking confident strides across the hall as he made his way over to the Gryffindor table. His eyes scanned the long table, seeming to be in search of someone until his eyes met Harry’s, and he continued making his way towards them.
“What is it?” Harry asked, putting his needles down. He sent his overly-animated boyfriend out to buy some thread and meat for dinner and he comes home with something else. Maybe it was time to consider just wine for dinner, or something. Spice it up with some trail mix.
“Thank you, but I had a lot of help too, you know,” Harry smiled, crouching down to be at eye level with the kid.
“Potter!” He squawked with an offended noise, but Harry only laughed in reply, lifting his hand to ruffle the soft, blond strands further, which earned him a slap on the hand. Harry didn’t care. He thought Draco looked rather adorable with his hair all mussed up.
Draco gave him a funny look before shaking it off into a grin. “Not at all,” he said reassuringly. “I’d like to get to know you too.”
“Draco will be there, won’t he?” Harry inquired, trying his best not to look too excited. “I could walk you to the back, if you want. In case there are still a few students who haven’t gotten over the novelty of you being a war hero and all. Safety reasons.”
“Does it matter?” Harry shrugged, but still decided to pinch his side. “Our whole relationship is based on fun anyway. We should Salsa instead or something.”
They didn’t shower together, thankfully, but Harry went first and told the other man that he was heading to breakfast ahead of him because apparently he planned on taking at least 1 hour in the bathroom.
“Babe, we’re already late,” Harry laughed, enjoying the way Draco’s cheeks turned pink at the nickname. He knew that Draco actually liked it when Harry used pet-names, though he would never admit it out loud.
“Idiot,” Harry rolled his eyes fondly, pulling Draco in for another kiss. This time, he reciprocated, parting his lips slightly to allow Harry better access to his mouth. They carried on like that for a few more minutes, just enjoying each other’s presence, until they eventually had to pull away for air.
“So you can fix it!” his ecstatically clueless boyfriend exclaimed, following him while Arthur, who had the decency to be embarrassed, trailed along. “You’re the best. I love you.” and just to emphasize it, he draped himself around Harry, engulfing him in a hug from behind and kissing hiss cheek.
“You’ve literally been sleeping in all week, and it’s Friday now,” Harry pointed out, raising an eyebrow.
Not more than a few hours later, he heard the laughter of Arthur and Draco making their way back into the Burrow. At least they sounded like they were having fun, but Harry wasn’t expecting them to come back until someone called for dinner.
“Hello to you too, Potter,” Draco raised an eyebrow. They both seemed to have forgotten that their children could hear them too.
There was a brief moment of silence, and now Draco was sure Harry would laugh at him, or probably say something that would make him feel like an idiot. Still, he hoped that Harry wouldn't just leave him.
“I did prepare myself,” Draco protested meekly, slowly becoming more and more aware of their nakedness. He shifted from where he laid on top of Harry’s body.
“Right,” Draco said, clearing his throat. His cheeks were an appealing shade of pink, though for what reason, Harry didn’t know. “Take a seat so I can massage it in, and remember to pay attention so you can do it on your own.”
“Or maybe you want to hear about how I plan on having you on every surface of this house once we’re done,” Harry said, nibbling on the lobe of his ear. Because of how wide the three fingers pressed inside him, more pressure was applied to his prostate with every movement, making him shake tremble harder.
“Stay out of this,” Harry grumbled before responding to Draco. “I’m sorry I messed up our project, I know it was my turn to check on the potion, but seriously? I asked you for help because I didn’t understand and you waved me off.”
“Shh,” Harry hushed, pulling away. When he spoke, his breath fanned against Draco’s moist lips. “I’ll take care of you.”
“Fuck, you’re so tight,” Harry gasped, resting his forehead against Draco’s. Silently, he was glad he wasn’t the only one that needed a second to get used to the sensation of having the entire length of Harry’s cock up his arse. “Just give me a minute.”
“Hey, Draco,” Harry said. “Isn’t it weird that we’re dating but never actually gone on a real date?” He heard the blond next to him choke on the bread he was eating. “I was thinking we head out to Hogsmead later and go on a real date, you know?”
“Fuck!” he yelped, rubbing the back of his head. He looked down and realized that the perpetrator was a small sodding Jenga block.
“Don’t worry, I don’t think Potter would be able to hold out,” Malfoy smirked, side-eyeing Harry who, in response, raised his eyebrow in challenge and grabbed Malfoy’s hand.
When he leaves, it’s gonna hurt. You’ll be surrounded by things that remind you of him His brain just had to ruin it.
“Quick, steal some roast before we book it to our rooms,” Harry whispered to Draco, who grinned and obliged, casting a notice-me-not charm and levitated the food, along with some alcohol with them.
“Love you,” Harry whispered into his neck, placing a soft kiss on the exposed skin. Draco couldn’t repress the shudder that ran through his body. He felt Harry smirk against his skin before he placed another firm kiss onto his neck, lips trailing upward towards the back of his ear before tracing his tongue on the outer shell.
“Wait, you don’t want to do this anymore?” Panic began flooding in again, even though Draco knew he was probably being irrational.
“It’s a yes, you pansy,” Harry laughed, letting him slide the ring onto his finger. Draco had a matching one as well, as it turns out.
“I got us some waffles,” Harry said without looking up as he pulled the containers from a paper bag. Draco immediately went to join him in setting up their food.
, he was beaten by Neville. Which meant that over the weekend, Draco was busy with his brewing and during the final week, they weren’t assigned to work with one another again. Any point after that was spent with Neville in the greenhouses, and all Harry was able to do was give a passing hello when they met.
Ron gave him a look, so he continued. “I mean, first of all, she’s your girlfriend.” The redhead scoffed. “And I think we should at least give him a chance. I mean, everyone seems to be pretty defensive of him. He might be alright.”
“Check this out,” Dean said, standing by the area where they were playing Drunk Jenga. He held his wand and pointed it at what might have been the block he was aiming to get. It was a singular block in the middle and on the very bottom of the whole tower, keeping it up.Then, pulling back high, he swiped his wand quickly. Harry was half-expecting Dean to cast a spell to remove it.
Plus, Harry found his reformed personality highly endearing. Of course, he was still a git but it was rather difficult to hate him when he saw him tutoring students in the lower years or silently sorting books in the library. Call it a minor fancy at the most, but that’s really all it was. Really.
“I dare you to,” he paused briefly, looking around before his eyes landed on Harry. “I dare you to play gay chicken with Harry.”
He sputtered a bit before quickly recollecting himself, entwining his fingers with Harry’s and turning back to the game. Everyone else was eyeing them with strange looks but eventually tore away their stares in favor of continuing the game. From the corner of his eye, he saw Hermione give him a worried look but he only smiled in reassurance.
And as he made his way down the hall, he knew that the heavy feeling he had was more than just missing the warm bed he recently left behind.
“Everything?” Ron piped up. Harry thought he took another nap, but apparently his best friend has been paying attention the whole time. “So you’re going to be pretty busy the whole year, then?”
“He’s really smart,” she began, settling herself onto one of the pillows comfortably before looking at him accusingly. “He’s yet to call me a nerd, and doesn’t ask what I’m talking about every few seconds.”
Really, it’s not Harry’s fault the other man doesn’t set alarm clocks, so he resigned himself to watching the other man dash through the flat, taking a last minute turn to grab his forgotten drink before stepping into the Floo after Harry.
“Mister Potter,” McGonagall greeted him as the 8th Year students got ready to leave. They had all planned on leaving together, bar Draco and Neville because they wanted to get some things ready before everyone arrived. Harry tried not to think too much on it and focus on his former teacher instead.
"But who's making sure that you get home alright?" Harry said slowly with a small nod. "You don't have to be alone through all this, you know? You may be fine now, but who would check on you in case you weren't?"
“I’m tired,” Draco grumbled and, while of course he was, this time Harry understood. They had stayed up until early hours of the morning to wrap up an investigation. All that was left to do was plan for the raid which would be taken care of by a larger team, which meant they were finished.
Oh yes, much to Draco’s deep embarrassment, Harry had begun dancing around him, slightly grinding his arse on Draco and shaking his hips ridiculously while Draco stood there helplessly as their friends and colleagues laughed, not unkindly of course.
“Stop that,” Draco mumbled. Maybe the lighting in the Slytherin bathrooms was strange, because it wasn’t like Draco to seem flushed so often. “You’re wetting my shirt with the potion and wasting good product.”
Harry followed the blond as they passed an array of doors which he assumed were the different student accomodations for the lower years before they stopped at the one on the very end, looking much like the previous ones did.
That was enough to tear his attention away from the remaining 8th Year exchange students that were waiting to be sorted and instead focus on this new person who will be joining them for most of their classes now. Once her house was announced, a Gryffindor pin appeared on her uniform beside the Beauxbatons school logo.
Eventually, they had all settled into some kind of civil, not-that-close-but-still-kinda friendship, and Harry was okay with that.
Draco had scolded him while they were fixing up the charms classroom. They had already organized the chairs and whatnot and were now working on the items used in class as well as the books, with Harry organizing the bookshelf.
“Sure,” Harry said, placing a quick peck on his boyfriend's cheek. “And what exactly do you plan on doing with all these staplers and paperclips,”
“Still going, eh?” Neville asked sympathetically, taking a seat next to Ron. Harry could only nod in response.
Really, though, he ought to remember that since they were partners, he taught Harry nearly every spell he learned himself so that they could be more efficient on the field. Draco’s knack for research is another reason for their success in the department.
“Stupefy,” he casted, aiming his wand at the short man and watching as he suddenly collapsed on the ground like a wooden plank. As soon as he fired the spell, he dashed over to where the guy that was being held, whose knees buckled as he collapsed against the wall of the building for support while he rubbed at his arm where he was held just seconds ago.
“I still don’t think it’s a good idea to get him inebriated before the wedding,” Hermione sighed, taking a seat. “What if he falls in front of everyone?”
“Harry, please stop. We’re in public,” Draco scolded, keeping his face straight but unable to fight the blush off his face. He was vaguely aware of the whispers around them, but Harry honestly didn’t care.
Eventually, once Draco realized that struggling was futile, he dropped all his weight and gave in to Harry’s manhandling until he was set down gently on the floor.
"Oh ha ha," He heard Draco's voice say dryly from somewhere behind him. "You caught me. The Dark Lord stood no chance to this swarm of children."
“Why do you call me ‘Potter’ but I call you ‘Draco’?” Harry asked instead. He wasn’t sure why it bothered him, but he felt the need to point it out.
He dozed off for most of the trip and only fully awakened once they arrived at the station. First years were herded off while Harry went ahead in search of a free carriage. Hermione ran to find one of the Hufflepuff Prefects, apparently having forgotten to give them one last reminder and Ron, being the good boyfriend he is, stayed back to wait for her.
Still, no response. Finally, he gave into his urges and began bouncing on the bed, listening to the sheets rustle underneath him every time he landed.
“Thank you,” Malfoy said, offering them a tentative smile. “You can call me Draco, if we are to be classmates. I was sent away in my final year, so I do believe I’ll be grouped in with the other 8th Years as well.”
Harry had stared at his pouted lips a bit too long, but thankfully the other man didn’t notice, neither did he notice Harry’s eyes widen and slight panic when he realized he fancied Draco Malfoy.
“I was just thinking, since everyone pointed out that I don’t know you,” Harry began. “I think I’d like to get to know you. Would you feel strange if I started hanging out with you and Hermione?”
“I wonder who I’ll get,” Hermione whispered excitedly, eyes darting across the students lined up in front. “McGonagall said we won’t be meeting them tonight because they want them to mingle with the other students. The Sorting will happen after tomorrow before breakfast where the Sorting Hat will also be the one to assign them with a partner, so the prefects are forcing everyone up a tad earlier to catch it.”
They both didn’t choose to leave Hogwarts either, so both of them were able to spend Christmas hols together. As for their relationship, they’ve still only gone as far as kissing and the occasional snog, along with hugging, holding hands, caressing, or anything in between. Something that both made Harry very happy, but also frustrated because he knew Draco wouldn’t go further, even in the privacy of their dorm rooms because to him it was all still a game. Just a game.
“It’s alright,” Harry grinned, resting his chin on top of Draco’s hip, making it tingle slightly. Suddenly, a devious glint passed through Harry’s expression before he began placing soft kisses over the skin over and over again, making sure that it tickled Draco.
“You can’t tell, but I vomited a little bit in my mouth,” Ron gagged. “Besides, Ferret, can’t you just take a quick shite on them and revive them with your furry powers or something. I remember reading that animal turds are good for plants.”
Seemingly unable to help himself, Harry gave Draco a long, affectionate kiss, his hands gently stroking the base of Draco’s neck.
Harry wasn’t exactly in the mood to talk to him, though, because after a few hours of thinking, he decided that he wanted to apologize to Draco, something he knew Ron would get mad at him for.
Hermione. There was no reason to, not when Neville wasn’t even interested in Draco romantically, as far as they knew.
Of course, Harry noticed how it was much harder on Malfoy, all things considered, but he’s been actively doing his best to prove himself to others and make up for everything he’s done. He even offered to officialize and sponsor Hermione’s causes, something that helped her warm up to him, albeit she was skeptical at first.
“Good luck with that,” Draco laughed. “Well, he wants to leave right after breakfast, so I should probably rest early.”
“Who knows,” Ron shrugged. “Man does a lot of weird things to begin with.” Once those words came out of his mouth, his eyes widened and he earned a pointed face-palm from Hermione. “Don’t stalk him,” he pleaded.
Every sensation was heightened as Harry touched all the right spots to spread pleasure through Draco’s body. With every thrust, Draco could feel Harry’s abdomen rub against his sensitive cock, on the verge of coming. Finally, it felt as though he might explode from all the pleasure that had been building inside him, his bollocks tightening as they threatened to spill.
And the feast was fun. Harry was suddenly very thankful Ron and Hermione wouldn’t let him miss this, because he definitely would have regretted it sooner or later. It lasted a while, but not too late because parents wanted to get back home, and the younger children were being scolded for bedtimes.
“Yeah right, Malfoy.” Harry smirked, although it was rather shaky. The thought of practically acting like Malfoys boyfriend until one of them backed out made him nervous, like they were actually together.
“How silly,” Draco hummed, which made Harry’s heart drop slightly and loosen his grip on Draco’s hand. “Wh-If we got together, they’d know immediately.”
“Truth or Dare!” Justin Finch-Fletchy screamed. There were cheers in response, which could probably be attributed to the tipsy students, but people agreed nonetheless.
Not more than 5 minutes later, the train had finally left the station. Ron and Neville were engrossed in talking about Quidditch, even though Neville wasn’t the biggest fan of the game. Harry suspected he was doing it for the sake of being a good friend. At least that left him to his own thoughts, first about Draco and then how that school year might go, while Hermione created a list of things to discuss during the Prefects meeting before Hogwarts.
Once that was all finished and everyone was presentable, they began piling out of the room. “Are you ready, mate?” Ron asked him.
“Slow down there,” Harry said, with a small, bright grin. This frustrated Draco more because it meant that Harry was catching on, and was probably making fun of Draco in his head because of his inexperience. Determinedly, he curled his fingers around Harry once more so that he could continue.
“What’s the point, I already saw him when we woke up” Harry groaned, feeling a bit antsy and just desperate to see Draco before the entire ceremony. They invited too many people for Harry’s liking, but Draco insisted it was a courtesy to invite all those other people. Maybe if he got to him now, he could convince him to elope instead.
“Well of course you would,” Ron waved the clipboard in his direction, before letting out a belch. “You have a thing for near-death experiences.”
“Great,” Harry murmured, pulling his husband against his chest and wrapping his arms around his waist. “Because I’m knackered and I just want to have you all to myself for the rest of the night. And month. My entire life, really.”
Harry alternated between stretching Draco out and rubbing against the gland, always making sure that Draco was in some state of unadulterated pleasure from his ministrations. He watched as Draco’s thighs trembled and his hands held shakily onto his knees, keeping himself open for Harry.
“Draco, Harry!” Hermione called out into the empty hallway, her head peeking out through the door, looking a bit sheepish. “Class is about to start.”
Searching Draco’s face once more, Harry was met with his flushed face, looking shy and unsure of what to do next. Harry had no doubt he looked the same, so he was rather grateful when he said “I’m pretty sure that doesn’t count as dancing.”
Of course, it didn’t really matter to the 8th Year students since all NEWTs students were in the same class as long as they took it. The only real reason the sorting mattered, aside from tradition, is because they will be taking part in the house-point system, and they’re only given access to the common room of the house they’re assigned, and possibly the house of their guides. Also, it makes it easier to form groups or partners in class depending on what the teacher wants.
“I got the confirmation,” he sighed. Saying it out loud made it much more real, and he didn’t realize how much it actually hurt.
“Of course it is, Potter,” Draco sniffed, moving his head away from Harry’s, though. He took this opportunity to give his new husband a clumsy twirl, earning a yelp.
“...and grow to be better, and to be more than who they were before. I would also like to announce that because of the many hands that helped rebuild the school, the other professors were able to prepare for the next school year. With that said, Hogwarts will be ready to accommodate students in time for September 1, and will function as peacefully and normally as before.”
“Shh,” Hermione hissed, waving a hand at them. “Maybe their interest has to do with the Battle of Hogwarts. Either way, this is so exciting!”
“No, I bought a share of the company,” Draco said, as if Harry were the one who wasn’t getting it. “I tried to get 100% full but the others wouldn’t give up their shares, so I hope 20 is enough for you. Now, what subscription are you talking about?”
“Prove it,” Draco whispered, making eye contact despite his visible embarrassment. Feeling a bit bold, Harry stepped forward so that they were practically being pressed against each other and placed one hand around Draco’s waist.
And with that, he Disapperated with a pop, leaving Harry and Draco to stand alone together in the dark.
Upon seeing Draco’s scrunched up nose, Harry let out a laugh. “You’ll get used to it,” he said fondly, placing a soft kiss on the dip of his hip bone.
“Draco Malfoy,” he used Draco’s whole name, because it sure sounded pretty intimidating when Hermione did it to him and Ron. “If you don’t get up right this second, I’m eating your breakfast.”
“Yeah, well you don’t have nerve damage you-” The blond instantly cut himself off, eyes widening in realization at what he was just about to reveal about himself. “Nevermind. Can we please just go somewhere warmer?”
A simultaneously pleasant and embarrassed warmth spread through him as he recalled the memory; the way Draco seemed to fluster a bit at the distance of their faces. Maybe his mind was beginning to play tricks on him, but he was pretty sure that he’d gotten his partner to blush once or twice when they were just hanging around in the office the other day.
Thankfully, they were among the throng of students that were lounging on the grass. As Harry and Ron made their way over to them, however, they realized that they weren’t alone. Beside them, they were accompanied by Draco’s friend from yesterday and his partner, another Slytherin named Tracey Davis.
“I bought us cable!” He exclaimed, much to Harry’s pleasant surprise. He had been meaning to subscribe to a cable company after buying their telly. He just never got around to doing it. “I know you’ve been wanting to do it for some time now. At least now that contraption of yours will be put to use.”
“You boys are adorable,” she gave him a small smile. “Now, I have to check on Seamus and Dean in the Great Hall.”
Instead, he tipped his head back and let it rest lightly against the flat of Draco’s stomach, looking him in the eye. His gray eyes, unfortunately, did not look back, seeing as they were much more focused on the task at hand, the fingers massaging his head not even pausing at the movement.
Malfoy stared at him. Then blinked. Then continued staring at him until Harry felt that maybe he was crossing a line here.
“It’s simple,” he reassured them, but it really wasn’t. Not when Harry was still nursing the fact that he fancied Malfoy. Who he was about to play gay chicken with. “You and Harry just have to be as gay with each other as possible. First to back out loses.”
“You wouldn’t wake up,” Harry grunted as his arse hit the floor. He supposed he should have felt lucky it wasn’t his back instead. “And this is my revenge for those damn complicated spells.”
“How lovely of you two to join us,” Narcissa smiled at them, subtly calling them out in front of all of the children. They all just smiled and waved ,though, much to Draco’s awkwardness and Harry’s amusement.
“Yes,” Draco sighed with some dread filling his voice, and Harry desperately wanted to know what he could do to make it better.
Draco offered to help him out with it once he got his hands on some because he was ‘a pleb with no experience over things involving aesthetics.’ Not feeling offended in the slightest, Harry agreed with a shrug and looked forward to the idea of having Draco run his hands through his hair.
“Look, you said that you aren’t ashamed of what you do because you chose to do this, right?” Harry clarified, waiting for the other man’s nod of approval.
Harry looked down and saw Draco standing with his bags. A few carriages to the left, he noticed the other Slytherins looking at Draco apologetically and Parkinson giving Harry a timid wave. Harry’s long since forgiven her, but he knew that she still felt a bit awkward around him.
His hair fell over his face, prompting Harry to reach out and curl it around his finger, twisting the lock and enjoying how silky and soft it felt under his touch. Still no movement from Draco. From there, he began running his hand through his hair in a repetitive motion, something he’d come to learn that Draco liked.
That was the first thing Harry noticed once he stepped out of the fireplace. It was late, so he was expecting that Draco would at least be up and running about to get ready for work, but instead there was only silence that filled the flat.
“Oh yeah?” He felt the blankets get thrown off them and saw a hand extend in front of him. When he glanced up, Draco’s hand was outstretched towards him, inviting him to take it, which he did. Gryffindor bravery and all that, he supposed.
“And miss the opportunity for me to test my new magic trick?” Malfoy asked innocently, and Harry was sorely tempted to give in.
He moved his head at a teasingly slow pace, making Draco want to just thrust his hips up himself and speed up the friction against his skin. He felt himself starting to let go and finally just enjoy the way Harry felt and everything he did, until a hand reached down to rub against his perineum.
“Why didn’t you bloody say so?” he asked, panic evident in his voice - even if Harry did, in fact, say so. He bolted from his seat to finish getting himself ready, ranting and scolding Harry without a pause while he struggled to put his shoes on.
Harry had to admit that, even at his expense, that would be quite a show, and perhaps, not even a bad idea. Only if it meant getting Draco there, of course.
“Since we’ll be living together, call me Harry,” the man grinned, holding his hand out for the other to take. Malfoy stared at his hand like it were some foreign object for a few seconds before grasping it firmly. Malfoy immediately added that he could call him by his given name as well.
“Then I take it that you are Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger?” the blond’s eyes shifted over to where his two best friends were seated, watching the strange interaction take place. They both nodded in confirmation, both weary and confused because they didn’t know what he wanted.
“Yes?” Draco drawled, raising an eyebrow at him. Harry took a silent breath as he tried to remind himself why he was there.
Although, as much as he hates to admit it, it did take a while longer to get them undone. It’s not his fault he doesn’t exactly remember every series of spells that need to be done at the top of his head like Draco did.
“For what it’s worth though,” Bill continued. “Everyone seems to be easing towards him slowly. He really is alright, and I think you should tell him you really have feelings for him.”
“Ow! You tosser,” Harry yelped as Draco pulled his hand back smugly. “I didn’t bloody grab your hair and pull at it!”
“At least one more drink?” Harry pleaded somewhat desperately, giving Draco an appealing smile. When it looked like he was about to refuse, Harry quickly broke into dramatics. “Oh, woe is me. Lonely on this cold Winter evening, alone in my wee hut while my friends forget about me and-”
The kids cheered, looking more and more excited. One of the kids, a small boy with ruffled brown hair walked up to where Harry and Draco were standing.
“It pays high and I make enough to graduate on time while buying everything I need,” Malfoy shrugged. “I was just lucky to find people who could guide me around this whole thing.”
The doors to the Hall were opened and the First Year students were led in, eyes staring curiously wide as they took in the magnificent site that was the Great Hall. Harry remembered what it felt like the first time he walked in, and it warmed him inside to realize that these innocent kids get to experience it as well, thanks to everyone.
“I don’t care,” Hermine said pointedly. “Innocent until proven guilty. He hasn’t done anything, so I will continue to treat him like any other classmate until we have an actual reason to dislike him.”
Harry shrugged again. “I told you, Hermione likes him. Besides, she’s his guide for the next few months.”
“I was thinking something that goes with Silver,” Harry said in a desperate attempt to gain control over the situation. They were already playing, might as well go all in. “Matches your eyes. Don’t you think so?” He said, cupping Draco’s face and turning it to face him. He heard what sounded like a suppressed squeal, or maybe a dying squirrel, but ignored it. All of his attention was on Draco’s flushed face, eyes looking anywhere except at Harry.
She gave him a skeptical look but shrugged it off and called for the rest of those who were left behind to follow as they marched their way into Hogsmead and took a Floo to Neville’s place.
Idly, Harry wondered if he could convince the Headmistress into moving their tables next to each other but then soon remembered that not everyone would be like them, and House rivalries could come back in full strength in a few years. What a shame, it was. Now that he’s been given the chance to get to know them, Gryffindors and Slytherins could wreak great havoc in the school together.
“But you won’t find a way to make me quit and insist on finding me a job in the wizarding community?” Malfoy clarified.
Once they made it to one of the drawing rooms where Narcissa stood in front of a bunch of wide-eyed children, they quietly took their seats behind them. Draco was right, a lot of things had been renovated. All the colors and areas he observed on their way in were lighter, giving off a bright feeling to the Manor. It was a bit more modern, but still very elegant, with most of the old wood and marble being replaced with white marble instead. The green and gold theme still stayed, though, which meant the carpets and settee covers.
“Draco,” Harry whispered, his face just inches away from Draco’s, their lips aligned. He gave his sleeping boyfriend a slow, chaste kiss, enjoying how soft he felt beneath him. “We’re going to be late,” he said again.
The blond head of hair made a movement that could almost pass as a nod, but Harry wasn’t too sure that he actually understood a word he said.
Thick ropes of come coated both their bodies messily, Harry’s hand moving over his cock until it had softened, becoming sensitive under his hold.
“Draco,” he murmured deeply, his breath warm against his skin. In response, Draco turned his head just a fraction, only for his lips to be captured in another searing kiss, Harry wasting no time to deepen it. Using the hand that was around his waist, Harry turned Draco over so that they were facing each other, giving each other better access to one another.
If when Draco gets hurt or mistreated while he’s working and comes home crying, nobody had to know. If Harry was always waiting for him to get back with a soft blanket and hot chocolate for when these things happened, and that he would hold Draco until he calmed down so they could talk about it, running his hand through his hair and placing a soft kiss to the top of his head, until the blond fell asleep in his arms, that was their business.
“I told you I did it!” Ron exclaimed, running down the stairs with a  parchment in hand, raised above his head and flapping in the air. “My Transfiguration essay, m’lady.”
“Does this mean you owe me a dance?” Draco asked with a grin, but his cheeks were back to having a tinge of pink on them.”Because if so, then I must reject if my feet wish to walk me into the new year.”
“Yes, how dense are you.” Draco huffed. “If it all really was just a game to me, I would have ended it during our graduation.”
After that, there was a resounding thunk, causing the cutlery to jump a bit. And then another one, and another one, and another one. But that’s not what Draco payed attention to. Instead, he noticed the large, affectionate grin that creeped its way onto his husbands face, who pulled him into a hug and gave him a brief, discreet kiss.
“Sure you do,” Harry snorted, placing a kiss on top of his head. When Draco looked up at him through the hair that had fallen over his forehead, Harry took that opportunity to lean down and press a long, sweet kiss on Draco’s lips.
This made Malfoy pause. He looked as though he was processing Harry's every word carefully before he opened his mouth to respond. "I'm taking care of myself," he said slowly.
Finally, he opened his clenched palm and pinched the webbed skin between his forefinger and thumb for a final 5 seconds. “And voila!” Malfoy exclaimed.
“Really, you’re a breakfast bearing God,” Draco laughed, waving his wand and summoning them plates. “People would fall at your feet to marry you.”
It was a sharp contrast from the formal dress shirts and fitted robes the man often wore to work, and Harry felt his world go off-balance for a second.
This seemed to finally get Harry moving. He pulled out his fingers, leaving Draco to feel empty, his hole clenching around nothing while Harry poured more lube on his hand to slather on his hardened cock. He sat back again so that he could align himself properly against Draco’s hole, entranced by the sight of his flushed cock against Draco’s clenching arse.
“Their fuzz, or fine hairs, are practically harmless but can tickle a bit,” Draco explained. Suddenly, another pinch of the final half was taken from his outstretched hand, this time by Neville, and blown into Draco’s face.
“If that’s what you want to call it, then sure,” the man shrugged nonchalantly, as if it were a perfectly reasonable, day-to-day assignment. “I’ll tell him to prepare a way for you to enter later, when you do manage to bring him in.”
“Hey, Harry. Draco,” Neville greeted. His blond head turned to greet them and gave them a smile and began talking with them as he brought out a quill and a notebook to take notes in class.
The Hall erupted in cheers, mostly coming from the students. Harry knew, at least for himself, that he was glad to get a sense of normalcy for once in his life and experience a regular school year without fearing for his life.
“Right,” Ron scoffed before his shoulders went slack, a sign that he’s given in. “But I’m not going to talk to you either as long as he’s around.”
And with that, he Disapparated into the night as Neville had done a few moments ago, leaving Harry alone by the greenhouse smiling like a madman.
“Harry!” he heard Hermione call after them, but he gave them a quick shrug, said not to worry, and told them he’d meet them in class.
The hand that was massaging his bollocks moved up to palm his flank, running the flat of his palm over the length of his cock. It felt even hotter under his hand, and Draco bucked up his hips to press himself harder against him.
“Fuck,” Harry groaned, capturing his lips into another sweet kiss while adjusting Draco’s legs so that his thighs rested on either sides of Harry’s spreading his legs open. He ran his hands gently over Draco’s sides, caressing the skin there, making him shudder with pleasure. “I would have loved to see that.”
“They will be joining you for your regular classes and will be making use of the school’s facilities, so please be reminded that you are to welcome them and help them should they have any problems.” Harry doubted there would be many problems regarding that, seeing as most of the student body was already excited to meet them. “They are well-versed in their translation charms, as I’ve been informed, but will most likely be speaking English thanks to their extensive classes for those joining this program.”
Then, deciding he should just get it over with, he knocked on the door softly as to not surprise the man if he really was still asleep.
“Harry!” he greeted, beaming a smile towards his boyfriend. Harry smiled back at him before grabbing him by the waist and pulling him towards his chest, leaning in for a kiss.
“He might have been, but I believe that is why self-preservation is a trait that is commonly affiliated with the house,” Draco shrugged, looking unaffected. “I’m not saying denying education to those born in non-magical families was wrong, but his fear is justified. I’m assuming that’s why most Purebloods get sorted there, because of years worth of passed-down fear from before, eventually transforming into a somewhat extremist ideology.”
He leaned down and pressed his mouth against his perineum, lips slightly parted. His breath ghosted against the sensitive skin before he gave it tentative licks.
“You’re terrible,” Draco scoffed while rolling his eyes, but the small smile on his lips gave it away. “Besides, if I don’t go, Blaise is probably going to hunt me down, worried out of his mind that maybe I died because I never miss these things.”
“Maybe it would be better if you went a bit later, wait for the flurring to stop. No need to hurry,” Harry offered. If Draco left, he’d probably follow not long after, but the idea of having him all to himself in the privacy of Harry’s house sounded more appealing. “It’s much warmer here, anyway.”
So for their first games night, they ended up playing charades. How they were supposed to get to know each other like this, he had no idea. Hermione had chosen it, though, along with Ernie Macmillan, the other person in charge of inter-house unity. Apparently, they wanted them to be comfortable around each other first.
“He’s an alright bloke now, I guess,” the redhead continued, shrugging his shoulders. “If you really like though, you should stop it with this game. You’ll never have anything real if you keep it up.”
“Honestly, the both of you,” she sighed exasperatedly, her brown eyes looking up as if she was praying to some god for strength. “Can’t you just use that quill of yours, Harry?”
“Draco!” he said loudly, shaking the worm-like figure under the sheets wildly. “Draco! Get up! Your stupid spells didn’t work.”
Harry felt his heart shatter all over again. A game. That’s what he said when he suggested moving in together, and that’s all this will ever be to him.
“Potter,” Malfoy responded, immediately pulling himself up from the wall and straightening his posture, the darkness of the alleyway hiding the redness that found its way to Malfoy's cheeks. They were both at a loss of what to say.
“And where exactly did it explode?” He asked, trying to keep his calm. He was pretty sure he was on the verge of ripping out his hair.
“Lalalalala-” Draco cut her off, not wanting to think about it again just yet because yes, he did think of his boyfriend while… conducting his research and he got embarrassingly hard from it. There was no need to relive those memories, especially not in front of
She turned around and jumped slightly, noticing him for the first time since she’s walked in. “Oh!” she flinched, before giving an exasperated sigh. “Are you going to argue with me about being friends with Draco too?”
“That you can deep-throat a banana?” Parkinson scrunched up her nose. Harry was not appreciating where this conversation was taking, but the slight tightness in his pants seemed to think otherwise.
Flipping open the cap of the bottle, he squeezed a large amount of lube onto his hand, producing a loud, squelching noise, and for the second time that night, Draco found himself breaking into helpless,awkward giggles. His eyes darted back towards Harry’s face to check if he had accidentally ruined the moment, and possibly annoyed him, but Harry was smiling back at him.
Sofia’s shoulders relaxed a bit, recognizing his friendly voice. “Yeah, I’ll explain later,” she smiled, before turning back to glare at Ron and Harry.
Sometimes a student would wave or, on one occasion, a teacher would invite them into the classroom for a few minutes and give an introduction of the class and the lesson that was being taught.
Absently, Harry noted that it seemed there were more students present. Of course he didn’t know every student’s name or face in the school, but he was almost sure that there were students in the older years that were definitely not there before.
“What’s the lesson?” he heard Draco ask as they were walking away. “I’ve got some notes from a friend in Ilvermorny who was able to graduate on time. Maybe it could help, assuming that-”
“I mean… I kind of feel like we were the ones who pushed her there,” Harry said, feeling a bit guilty. Ron didn’t share the sentiment.
Draco’s eyes widened slowly in a way that was almost comical. In fact, Harry would have laughed if he weren’t already silently planning his funeral. Perhaps Hermione would be willing to obliviate him.
The only ones who were still buzzing and energetic by the time most people left were the 8th Year students, who were all looking forward to the party that they were going to. From what Harry knows, there would be a few 7th Years present as well, but a very select few because most would be underaged and not allowed by their parents. Anyone else who was allowed would most likely be there.
That was also true, Harry conceded. They were just asked to come in to give a brief of their findings - which actually literally anyone can do as long as they’ve read the file - and then stay for the rest of the day since they were already there.
“But I did have some things to check out here and thought about you, so here I am.” That was enough to make Harry’s heart skip a beat.
“No, Potter,” Pansy squealed, whacking him away from the door with a rolled piece of parchment. “It’s bad luck, you know.”
Only the head of Harry’s cock was able to slide in before he felt himself clench tightly around it, wincing while trying to hide his pained expression. Pain shot through him, refusing to allow any further intrusion.
Harry wrapped his lips around the exposed head of his cock, sucking on it lightly. Again, Draco’s thrusted his hips into Harry’s mouth, thankfully somewhat held down on the waist by Harry’s free hand. He took more of Draco into his mouth, running his tongue on the underside of the hardened member, using the tip to trace the protruding veins.
Teasingly, he rubbed the head against the furled skin, not quite pushing in. Draco felt himself open a bit for the head of Harry’s cock to slide through, only to have it pulled out again.
He curled his fingers into the hairs on the base of his neck, leaning in to press a soft kiss onto Draco’s pouted lips, still unaware of everything that was happening around them. Harry allowed himself to indulge, his eyes roaming Draco’s entire face, taking in every small detail.
“Don’t pull your Saviour complex on me now, Potter,” Malfoy sneered, his attitude from when they were schoolboys returning, shifting uncomfortably under Harry's scrutiny and lack of response. "There's nothing that can be done."
Grinning triumphantly to himself, Draco pulled away and began trying to undo the laces. Except, the problem was that his hands were still shaking from the nerves, and he couldn’t properly untie their laces. He began tugging at them frustratedly until he realized that it had knotted, meaning he’d actually have to carefully undo it.
“I have you now, don’t I?” Draco said softly, darting his eyes away in embarrassment. Harry felt his heart swell with affection.
“What are you on about?” the redhead asked. “She would have never considered going there before, not until he came along.” The last bit was said with such venom that Harry hadn’t heard in a while.
“Then it’s a good thing I’m the one managing your hair right now, isn’t it?” Draco retorted, still focused on the task at hand.
“Neville comes here often, then?” Harry asked, trying to go for nonchalant and possibly missing by a mile. He silently glared at the book once Draco buried his head back in the suitcase.
“I’m good at many things,” was the immediate response, making Harry’s thoughts spiral downwards. Thoughts and, apparently, the blood that was meant to be flowing through his brain.
And just as Ron had pointed out, there were indeed multiple girls- and even boys- from Slytherin and Ravenclaw chattering around him. He entertained them gladly with a charming smile while his current companions unbothered by the amount of attention he was getting.
“Harry, I’m not just saying these things because I don’t want you to feel bad and give up,” she sighed into her own food. “But at the end of the day, isn’t the person whose opinion matters the most here Draco’s?”
“It’s not my first time studying abroad, no,” Draco said, eyes trained directly on Hermione, not even bothering to spare Harry and Ron another glance once he greeted them with brief nods and an unsure smile. “I’ve been taking part in them since my 4th year, though-”
“Oh, don’t worry about him, mate,” The redhead waved him off. “He’s fine. Just helping prepare a little something.”
Huh, so they have. Harry was too distracted to notice that other people had found their way to the dance floor and had begun dancing alongside them. Most of which, notably, were couples.
“Have you seen Harry?” Draco asked immediately, before hearing his mother’s voice reminding him of his manners. “Good evening,” he quickly added.
He walked down the familiar hallway, stopping by the kitchen to drop off their cinnamon buns and coffees on the kitchen counter, before heading into the master bedroom of the flat.
Harry chanted mentally. No more Muggle contraptions. He’s done everything in his power to stop Draco from buying a bus, and he thought it worked. He sends him out alone one time and can only pray he did not come home with a bloody-
“Well, if you need anything, you can always ask us to help you with your plan to-” the sounds of their voices were cut off when Harry closed his curtain and cast a silencing charm, not wanting to hear any more of their conversation which would probably confirm that the person Neville was planning to ask out was Draco.
“Did you bring me coffee?” he heard Draco mumble softly, attempting to force himself up as though gravity wasn’t allowing him to.
“Molly’s expecting me!” He replied, halfway done with putting his shoes back on while trying not to stumble as he walked. “You know how she is. She thinks we’re both too skinny, so expect a lot of takeaway.”
The wedding went smoothly, as expected, in part due to Draco’s strict planning and orders. Maybe also because of the very threatening passive-aggressive smiles he gave whenever someone nearly made a ‘serious’ mistake.
Students clad in blue began piling into the Great Hall, all led by Madam Maxime and two other teachers Harry didn’t recognize, possessing all the poise and grace they exemplified when they came for the Triwizard Tournament in Harry’s 4th year.
“I think I’ve embarrassed you enough for a night,” was Harry’s reply, blushing slightly but choosing to laugh it off instead.
“Oh yeah, you were managing just fine minutes ago!” Harry snapped, unsure as to why Malfoy was rejecting his offer. He just wanted to help the stubborn git.
“Yeah, ‘Mione,” Ron nodded, agreeing with Harry. “I doubt he’d be able to focus even more if he and Draco are dating by that point.’
“It would,” Harry grinned openly, giving him another lingering kiss. “But for now, I think we should head to class.”
“I was just joking,” he laughed, smiling sheepishly at his bushy-haired friend. When he heard a snort coming from Draco’s general direction again, he scooted his chair a bit to elbow him in the side.
Harry easily agreed, wanting to see the wreckage and how bad it was. It was a good thing they were both okay. Maybe he should call a lawyer and sue th-
“I should probably go then,” Harry mumbled, forcing himself up and extracting himself from the warm bed. It was nice and comfortable, and he regretted leaving it already.
“Yeah, but it makes sense, doesn’t it?” Harry explained, not feeling all too confident with his chances suddenly. “I mean, they’re close. He probably became interested when he realized that he wasn’t such a git after all.”
Food was silently levitated onto the table in front of their respective owners. “Always had your eye since then, huh?” he teased his slightly pink-tinged husband.
At this, Draco had finally reacted. His eyes hardened and the muscles in his body visibly clenched. Harry noticed Hermione cat him a worried glance, biting her lip as she debated whether or not it would be wise to interfere.
“And well deserved too,” Harry teased. “Because I got one from Hermione too when I told her what ha-ah shite,” he sighed. “I need to update them again. They probably think I’m packing the whole house and moving in with them until further notice.”
Harry hadn’t even realized how dark it had gotten out and agreed. He wanted to work on renovating Grimmauld Place a bit before going to bed. He already hired some people to redesign it while he was helping out at Hogwarts, but he left the finer details to himself.
Thanks for reading! I'll try to update as often as I can. If you're interested, I also post short fics on my
Harry let out a laugh at that and obediently straightened himself, allowing Draco to continue with his work. It took a few minutes; time Harry savoured greatly because of how good Draco was at giving head massages, until they were finally finished. Harry was almost disappointed to think that he’d have to do this on his own the next time.
"Potter, I already told you that I can handle myself just fine," Malfoy said. "I don't understand why you care so much."
“Of course I’m ready,” Draco scoffed, rolling his eyes. “I just- I mean I’ve been preparing for this for a while now. I want you, I really do.”
“Yes,” Draco nodded, getting up. “This would probably be better if we did it in the bathroom. They’d kill me if I got our floor wet because I’m pretty shite at cleaning charms.”
“Oh haha, you enormous prat,” Harry rolled his eyes, trying to hold back a laugh. “I’m not that bad.”
“Okay, calm down, Shakespear,” Draco said, rolling his eyes while biting back a laugh. “First of all, it’s barely past lunch. And secondly, you were invited too, although I suppose I could stay for one more drink. It looks like the sky is clearing up soon, anyhow.” Harry looked out the window, and indeed it was.
Harry could only nod, heart dropping more and more as the conversation continued, but he should listen. It’s been a while since someone lectured him on the risks of playing the game. That person being Hermione, of course.
“Where is your partner this time?” He knew it was coming, of course. The first time Robards had inquired, he sounded quite concerned. Draco was known to be one of the earliest people to come in every day prior to that week. He was very efficient and pretty good at his job, if he’d say so himself.
“You can’t stop people from using me and then leaving without paying,” Malfoy reminded him dryly, and Harry felt his gut drop. “Or those who hurt me while I’m working and let me go after. That’s how it is, even if I do stay with you.”
Lightly, he brushed his nose over it before pressing his lips against the skin, peppering small kisses.
“Stuff it, cockblocker,” Harry grumbled, finally giving in as they stepped onto the train and made their way into an empty cart. “Just had to get yourself thrown into the lake, didn’t you.”
“In case you have any thoughts of moving in for your final year,” Professor Flitwick joked. The poor 6th Year looked extremely awkward up there, but took it in stride. They simply laughed and responded with a
“No, Draco,” he sighed, running his hand over his face. “I mean I can’t keep playing this game. It’s hurting me.”
Draco subconsciously leaned into the touch, making Harry grin widely. Perhaps they could spare a couple of minutes more.
“Fine,” Harry grumbled, trying to see if there was a way to convince Malfoy to change his mind. For now, he’ll settle. “But if you get hurt, I’m allowed to heal you.”
She gave him an assessing look. For what, Harry wasn’t sure. “Right..” she said before shaking her head and giving him a bright smile. “He actually takes every class I’m in, so you’ll see each other often.”
And suddenly, he tried not to think of what it would imply for him to take the ride alone with Draco.
“Yeah,” Harry shrugged before explaining. “You know those ‘If we’re both still single by 40, we should just get married’ jokes?”
His blond head snapped up to face Harry and, if it were possible, seemed to pale even more. All movement seemed to freeze in that moment when Malfoy recognized Harry as well, both of their breathing taking a pause.
“Why?” Harry asked eventually. Would Draco really be this committed to playing a game, one that’s practically run its course since they’ve started three years ago?
“Then shall we take this somewhere private?” Harry said lowly. A strange sense of satisfaction rushed through him when he noticed Malfoy’s cheeks flush and how he leaned just a fraction away, possibly in surprise.
“We were close to kissing,” Harry mumbled shyly, his skin suddenly heating at the memory of that night. Hermione gave him an excited smile, but then he spoke. “But wouldn’t I be a bad friend for asking Draco out when I know Neville likes him?”
The lights dimmed before there was a timer spelled into the air, right in the middle of the stage. It began counting off from 60, with some people counting down out loud with it as everyone waited for the clock to strike 12, welcoming them into the New Year.
“How can I not stress?’ He groaned, leaning a bit more into Harry’s arms. “The wedding is tomorrow and I’ve completely forgotten to teach you how to dance.”
“I’m so glad that I get to go into the new year with you,” Harry sighed, smiling against Draco’s neck.
Of course he's head news of these things, but he never actually imagined what it might feel like until that moment. “Haven’t you ever reported them?”
“Of course not,” Harry rolled his eyes. “But I’d rather not have both McGonagall and Hermione mad at us if he decides to leave because we were being prats for no good reason.”
“Have you been arrested before? Because it must be illegal to look that hot,” Harry continued, not caring for the groans and people cringing around them. Draco shrunk further into his scarf, turning more scarlet as people gave them odd and amused glances.
Harry declined, helping Ron finish the pillar quickly instead. However, rather than going straight back home to Grimmauld Place, he hung back and slowly made his way to the Greenhouse where Draco and Neville were attending to the plants. They did their fair share of work around and replanted everything necessary already but volunteered to check on them daily and take care of them until the school started and Professor Sprout wouldn’t be as busy.
“Hey, look at me,” Harry said, running a hand through Draco’s hair when he let his head drop into his arms, resting over his drawn-up knees.”I wish you told me before, but I think I get it.”
“Oh no, dears. I’ve heard you two are dating and I’ve got a special thing for you to try,” she insisted. “If you like it, tell your friends!”
“Hey, Draco!” He called before he could think to regret his actions. Deciding to just go with it, he began a slow jog over to where the man was standing, waiting for him to catch up. “You’re taking Transfiguration, right?”
“Well you sound comfortable,” Draco snorted, his head now inside the trunk. Harry rolled over so that he could respond properly, except his head rolled onto the corner of something hard and somewhat sharp.
He felt curiosity creep through him but forced himself to shrug it off. No, he was not about to get into that. He was exhausted and frankly, he didn’t like the idea of paying someone to have sex with him. It felt wrong; like he was forcing them or something.
After blinking to himself a few times, he looked around and realized that while most of the shops at ground level were your regular day-to-day stores, the neon lights climbed up from hidden little staircases that went under the buildings all the way up to the apartments that walled the street high up.
“Alright,” she laughed, ruffling his hair. “Go. I’m going to need energy if I’m going to make up for the lectures I missed.”
“Fuck,” he heard Harry say breathily, but Draco’s attention was now focused on the area in front of him. Slowly, he leaned forward until his lips were pressed against the soft material of Harry’s joggers, covering his hardening cock. He opened his mouth hesitantly before mouthing at the fabric, lapping his tongue across it as he got the material damp.
“Morally gray, I know,” Harry shrugged, feeling somewhat helpless. “But still, we don’t actually know him, and Hermione seems to like him, so the least we can do is be quiet when he’s around.”
He reached back and breached his entrance with one finger, wincing a bit at the pain that came with the sudden intrusion. Gritting his teeth, he rested his head against the tiles before slowly sliding his finger deeper, thrusting into himself as he forced himself to relax.
“I don’t know,” he sighed. “I don’t want to lose him. Our entire relationship is really because of the game. He’s just too competitive and committed to quit, and I can’t bring myself to end it.”
“We’re discussing it because you’re panicking too much,” Pansy rolled her eyes. “Really, just tell him that you’ve never been with anyone and you could work it out together.”
“Oh- oh fuck, I’m coming,” Draco moaned loudly, his head falling back on the pillow. He felt himself tighten impossibly around Harry’s length, the other man slowing down his movements, thrusting shallowly, as Draco rode out his orgasm.
“I live alone, but there’s a spare room across mine,” Harry said, leading his new flatmate through the house. “I’ll write down the address for you in a bit if you choose not to apparate in and let you get settled.”
“Merlin, you’re annoying,” Draco laughed, pressing his face into Harry’s chest. “Let’s eat already, before the food gets cold.”
“Yeah, we’re coming,” Harry sighed, trying not to look disappointed. Hermione nodded perkily with a smile before disappearing back into the classroom.
“T-thanks,” Harry stuttered, feeling slightly embarrassed since Draco was still examining his hand. Draco looked up at his flushed face before turning red himself, abruptly dropping Harry’s hand in embarrassment.
It seems that his partner has gotten more creative with his spellwork, and Harry seriously considered just kicking the door down until it gave way, because he’s thought of every spell they learned in training and nothing seemed to work.
“Fleur!” Ginny said gratefully. “‘My beautiful, lovely sister. Lend us your powers of grace, or something, and help me tame this mess.”
Draco let out a slow sigh before slowing down his pace and facing Harry. “I know. I’m just really tired. I’m sorry too.”
Thanks for reading! I'll try to update as often as I can. If you're interested, I also post short fics on my
Harry thought maybe he’s seen the worst of it, definitely not the last, with the ‘exploded’ car, but no. It appears dating the odd phenomena that is Draco Malfoy will never come with dull moments.
Affection visibly washed over Harry’s features before he wrapped his arms around Draco’ pulling him closer.
At this, Harry froze again, but Draco didn’t seem to be sharing the same problem. Almost as if he’d never actually had a problem pulling himself out of bed for the last two weeks, he slipped out of the covers and walked towards the bathroom.
When those bright, gray eyes met his own green ones, he felt himself pause once again. Draco just looked so unkempt and… soft. Some strands of his blond hair were sticking out at odd angles and there were pillow marks on his cheek, eyes half open as he lifted himself onto one of his elbows.
“I know,” Draco muttered, but he still couldn’t help the insecure feeling at the back of his head. “I just- I think I’ll get ready for when he comes over. The food should be ready soon.”
Draco had to blink to himself a few times before looking back down, seeing the laces undone. He couldn’t even bring himself to face Harry like this. Instead, he carefully pulled the joggers off, realizing that Harry hadn’t worn pants underneath them.
He walked slowly as he did, a million thoughts and possibilities running through his mind before coming to a final conclusion.
“Yeah, but look,” Harry nudged towards the white peacocks. “Your demon peacocks are eyeing me down.”
The little bit of space allowed for more movement, so when Harry paused to change his angle, he brushed directly against Draco’s prostate.
“But maybe you could- er, help me understand this a bit better?” Draco suggested weakly, his blush returning. “It’s- I did research,” he admitted, feeling his face heat up. “It just… didn’t go like how I was expecting.”
“I’m gonna beat your arse in this game, Potter,” Malfoy murmured, leaning into Harry and bringing his face close to his ear so that he could practically feel the other man's breath tickle his neck.
Harry belatedly realized that when they began rebuilding, Draco was normally assigned to work with a teacher at first- most of the time that teacher being Professor Flitwick or the Headmistress herself- and helped with a lot of the charm work, such as the one in the Great Hall. He and Hermione worked together often in that aspect because they were both pretty brilliant at theories, and they were successful.
He could tell that Harry was biting back another small chuckle, but he felt some tension leave his body anyway.
Thankfully, the night was tame. What Draco meant was really cuddling in bed, much to the surprise of Harry. He even complied to using Harry’s room instead of his own. All very convenient, even if it did mean Harry had to lend one of his shirts to Draco for him to sleep it.
Shoving his hand in his pocket so that he was just gripping the base of his wand, he quickened his pace towards the sound of the crash, the deep voice of a male getting louder as he approached.
“Cute,” Harry laughed, placing a quick kiss on his soon-too-be husbands cheek. “But seriously, don’t stress too much. Everything looks great,” He insisted, hoping to mollify the anxious man in his arms.
“Muggles call it stationary!” The excitable blond explained, opening his bag and showing off their not-dinner. “Isn’t it brilliant?”
And, as he had done for the past few days, he hesitated. There was something oddly calming about seeing Draco so peaceful, happy and asleep. He found himself entranced with the steady rise and fall of Draco’s chest under the sheets, and the soft sound of his breathing that accompanied it.
“It’s to my knowledge that when they became suspicious of any possible act of magic, whether it were real magic or not, they believed that person to be evil and burned alive whilst declaring them ‘witches’ and ‘evil.’ Now pair that with a whole school of real magic, and the possibility of someone letting it slip to a Muggle, exposing the entire wizarding community.”
Harry grabbed the bottle of lube that Draco had purposely left on the bedside drawer, slicking up his cock before aligning himself with Draco’s entrance after he had stripped himself off his pants. Draco felt the blunt head press against him, trying to push into his body.
Harry was among the first few to arrive in the common room since he left when the first years did and walked pretty fast to keep up with Draco’s hurried pace. He figured he could sleep early and wake up early as well, since Hermione would most likely be up with a lot of time before breakfast.
Taking a deep breath, he squirted some of the lube onto his palm, cringing a bit at the sound the bottle made when he squeezed it.  He watched as the clear substance shifted in his wet palm before rubbing it over his fingers and bracing himself against the wall.
“Okay, let’s get one thing clear, Potter,” Malfoy said, his eyes narrowing into slits. “While I don’t find my situation to be the most ideal, I am not ashamed of myself or what I do.”
“Oh, yeah,” Draco said, looking sheepish. “Some of them are alright, and some are coming around and others….well, who knows. I’d like to apologize for Pansy, however-”
Quietly, he scooted closer until he was seated by his face, the steady beating of his pulse becoming erratic. He was both more comfortable and discomfited with how at ease he felt in Draco’s personal space.
The hand began working the excess potion through his hair, massaging his scalp with just the right amount of pressure and making sure to cover every inch of his head. And hell, if his fingers didn’t feel like magic.
Instead, he forced his head to face forward and keep walking at a steady pace, careful to make sure that he didn’t stare too long at anyone that he passed by as he did so.
“Anything you want, love,” Harry smiled, kissing him briefly on the lips before pulling him closer and just holding him. They had a lot to make up for and deal with later, but for now they each just wanted to enjoy being close with one another and resting peacefully.
He could- or at least, he could try. All he knew was that no matter what happens, it would hurt him far more to not have him in his life afterwards. Yes, he could be there for his friends, even if it meant that he wouldn’t have Draco for himself.
you,” Harry grumbled, storming into the familiar bedroom and, honestly, this was not how he imagined he would be getting familiar with the other man’s bedroom.
After much arguing, though, he eventually settled for one of Harry’s jeans and a rather large knit sweater. Given that they also agreed to use softening charms on each of them, something Harry didn’t realize was an option.
This was the longest the Hat seemed to take during this whole sorting, making Harry wonder whether there was going to be a hatstall for an exchange student.
“Then if you want to keep doing this, fine,” Harry shrugged. “It’s your life and I’m not going to judge you for it. I'd only find you another job if you wanted to quit. I just want to make sure that you get home safely, alright?”
“It’s not my fault!” Ron said defensively. “We were coming up with a plan to help Neville ask this bloke out on a date.”
“No!” Harry said, head shooting up from his moping on the table. “I mean, in part. But seriously, I’m fine. I can handle myself.”
Draco’s eyes him for a few seconds, a strange, guarded emotion in his eyes before shrugging and nodding. “Alright,” he agreed. “If I’m not back when you are, I’m housed of the second building to the left on the right side, third floor.”
Draco laughed, a beautiful sound. “Sorry, I just figured you might dislike the familiarity. Harry, then.” He looked more relaxed than when Harry approached him, which was a good thing.
Too bad the novelty of the moment had to be cut off so soon, though, because something hard knocked him on the back of his head.
“Look, you don’t know Draco. I grew up with him,” he told Harry, making him wonder why he even bothered informing him of this fact. “All I can say is that Weasley was far off the mark, and I think it’d be in your best interest to apologize to Draco, even if it were for Hermione’s sake.”
“Students, you may now start heading out to your first periods,” the Headmistress announced. Both Harry and Ron got up, looking expectantly at Hermione and their new companion for the next 5 months for them to follow.
“What are you going to do about this guy?” Ma- Draco asked, pushing the edge of his shoe into the shoulder of the fallen man Harry had stunned just earlier.
“It’s a beautiful day out. Nothing wrong with a short walk,” Draco responded, his hair flying a bit because of the light breeze. He looked happy like that, just smiling under the sun while holding Harry’s hand.
Gray eyes snapped over to where he was seated, where they momentarily locked eyes before giving each other silent nods.
“Harry,” Draco groaned when he moved his thigh, Harry’s erection now pressing into him. Slowly, he felt his own cock begin to rouse, his pulse quickening when he realized that
Once he was sure his boss was out of earshot, he let out a groan and thumped his head on his desk before mentally pulling himself together.
“Yeah?” Draco asked, looking like he was on the verge of bursting out into laughter. “Alright then, but I do feel the need to point out that you didn’t exactly say anything against me.”
He received a quick glare before it was quickly covered up with one of sheer delight. “Pick me up in my room after breakfast.”
“Ron, would you mind moving next to Harry?” Hermione asked sweetly, sending both of them warning glares which Draco couldn’t see from his position behind her. “I want to sit next to Draco so we can get to know each other better.”
“Do we really have to be naked for this?” Draco asked instead, beginning to feel self conscious. He drew up his knees until they were covering his chest, ankles crossed so that he wasn’t completely exposed.
Draco stopped moving for a second, bending down until his chin was practically resting against his shoulder to look at Harry’s reflection at eye-level, causing him to resist the urge to squirm.
“I’m surprised you managed to herd Harry into sitting in the front today,” Neville teased, giving Draco what looked to be a knowing smile. For what reason, Harry had no idea. He was just glad that Neville wasn’t pissed that he took the seat next to Draco when he’s planning on asking him out eventually.
Somewhere above him, he heard Harry chuckle, making his cheeks redden in embarrassment. He was doing so well, dammit. Now Harry probably thinks he’s an idiot and he’s laughing at him.
“Mate. Malfoy? Lose?” Ron said incredulously. “Good luck, because we’ve all seen Malfoy play. There’s no way he’s giving in first any time soon.”
“Okay..?” Harry wasn’t quite sure of what was so spectacular about them, but from the looks of Draco’s face as he gave a small smile in the direction of the plants, Harry knew he wanted Draco to look at him instead.
“Well, of course,” she huffed. “Who’s to say who Draco wants to go out with. If I remember correctly, you said you guys were close during the party.”
Suddenly, there was a knock on the door and it slid open. Harry’s eyebrows were furrowed, wondering who it was that had the audacity to be so bold and let themselves into their cart until he realized that it was just Neville.
“So who wins, then?” Dean asked before Neville was successful in finally dragging them away, looking back at them with a grin and a quick wave. After that, he looked at Draco, who was eyeing his friends wearily before they made eye contact.
“You’re thinking about asking me for sex publicly?” Draco asked dryly, his cheeks turning red at the thought of doing more of… that with Harry.
“Alright, Ronald,” she sighed dramatically, lips quirked upwards. “Now take a seat so we can start.”
Harry had no doubt that he would, and he supposed that if, hypothetically, he managed to pull himself together only to be cockblocked by Blaise Zabini, he may just have a body to hide, and the poor, unfortunate soul that would be lucky enough to find it would have quite the present to unwrap for the holidays.
“You ran away from the war because you were too much of a coward to face it! And now you think you can just waltz in here and enjoy the trip like nothing happened, like the battle you ran away from didn’t take place here!” Ron concluded, his breaths paced fast and shallowly.
Well, she had a point there, he supposed. “I’m afraid we are not quite fit to be sending off students from our own school this year, however,” this elicited many disappointed groans from the students. Harry wasn’t feeling particularly put out, though, because the only reason he came back was to finally enjoy a year at Hogwarts without attempted murder.
,” Harry snorted. “I mean, they might need to be a swot to keep up with her, especially if they’re going to be taking their NEWTs this year as well.”
“Hey, love,” Harry whispered, bringing his face just inches before Draco’s. His hand began spreading the lube between the crease of his arse, cold against the night air. “Don’t be nervous now. I told you I’d take care of you; make you feel good.”
Malfoy gave him a- surprisingly adorable- pout. “And who’s to say I’d still feel like trying it out then?”
“I mean honestly, Potter, what’s the point of you coming when I’m already late? I thought they meant to send you in before work starts, but no, you sat there casually and watched me drink coffee. You could have
“Are you sure you should even bother going?” Harry asked worriedly. He looked out the window and saw that it was still kind of flurring outside. “It might get really cold later on, especially knowing how long her parties could go on for.”
At Harry’s silence, he continued. “All things considered, I had a higher chance of surviving in the Muggle world with no money than I do forcing myself to live in the wizarding world with little to nothing.”
“Speaking of that,” he tried to sound nonchalant as he brought the topic up. “Neville mentioned that he was thinking of asking someone out.”
“Oh bloody hell,” Ron muttered darkly, watching his girlfriend stand up to greet her assigned partner. The sorting continued even as they continued talking in front. It seemed that Hermione asked him a question, but the blond had merely shrugged and said something in response before they made their way back to Hermione’s previous seat.
“You don’t know Draco.” Yeah, Harry was well aware of that fact, as Zabini had already pointed it out. “So stop talking about him like you do. You’re just as prejudiced against Slytherins as you imply they are about any Muggle-related thing.”
“You could have just paid me back eventually,” Harry continued, pointedly ignoring first half of the statement.
Harry blinked rapidly, taking a bit longer than he’d like to admit before he could process what was being asked.
“I’m afraid I don’t know what you mean,” Malfoy said, sounding equally as breathless but slightly more impatient and annoyed that Harry pulled away.
“Back so soon, are you?” Harry asked, looking away from the vegetables he was cutting to raise an eyebrow at them.
“You’re right; you don’t,” he said, pulling Draco along to the floo whilst simultaneously trying not to focus too hard on the warmth that bloomed where their skin touched. “And don’t think that your spells are going to hold me off for long.”
They sat back down on the bed with Harry positioned at the end while Draco sat on his knees behind him. He summoned a full-length mirror that was placed by his bed-side so that Harry could see what he was doing.
Harry did his best to watch what he was doing, something that prooved to be a trying task once he found his eyes wandering towards the pale fingers that worked their way through his hair and the slightest hint of a pink tongue poking through a pair of plump lips and, much like when they were in the bathroom, the soothing way Draco’s hands felt against his scalp.
But when the other students filed in and Blaise Zabini took the seat behind Draco and the one next to him was filled in by Neville not long after, Harry was suddenly glad he was able to nab the seat next to Draco.
“Mate, are you sure?” Ron asked him. Hermione nodded in agreement, worry taking over her features as she looked at him.
said, nodding briefly once more before stepping out of the circle Harry cast around them for privacy and making his way back to the front. However, instead of heading straight to the rest of the Beauxbatons students, another man- dark and also considerably handsome- from the table stood up and joined him as they made their way over to the other side of the hall.
They both enjoyed their food, talking about their day and catching up with one another; the usual stuff. The only problem was that Draco kept squirming in his seat. It didn’t sting like it did when he had just stepped out of the shower, but it definitely felt strange.
And when he saw Draco smile brightly at him, practically glowing with happiness, he knew that he would be there for him to sleep well for as long as he needed him to be.
“And finished,” Fleur said with a sigh of relief. Huh, maybe he was wrong. He got up and looked at the mirror, pleasantly surprised to see that despite still looking like a birds nest, it was at least styled in a way that made it look deliberate and a bit neater.
“I was only able to get 20%, though,” Draco frowned apologetically. “Muggles are very hard to do business with.”
They weren’t both too skinny, or whatever Molly sees. Well, perhaps maybe Draco, but he was lean and fit. Harry had bulked up considerably after joining the Aurors. But he wasn’t wrong, they were going to end up with a bunch of home-made food if Draco went.
At this, Harry shifted uncomfortably, but Ron didn’t seem to share the same problem. In fact, it seems to have reignited his anger from earlier, if the way he went on was anything to go by.
He tried calling his name again, this time adding a small shake to his shoulder as he did so. Still, no answer came. Harry was beginning to feel frustrated, but he didn’t want to be rude and just outright jump on the bed to disturb him.
“Okay,” Draco practically chirped, beaming at him. “I’ll meet you in the dungeons and bring you in.”
“I mean just live with me, like flatmates,” Harry explained. “And maybe we can work on something to get you out of this situation.”
Harry supposed that he shouldn’t have been surprised when he came down and found all of Draco’s notes stapled or filed in stacks, along with all of Harry’s things as well. Not to mention random sticky notes or reminders stapled to the wall, but that’s for another time.
“No,” Harry said in attempts to look unaffected, even while he could feel himself flush from the neck up. “Do you admit that was you’re goal, though?”
“It was Levitating, you idiots,” Malfoy scowled, promptly crossing his arms while plopping down onto his cushion that was placed on the floor.
“Me too, love,” Harry panted, his hips speeding up. He began thrusting harder, faster, into Draco, his hand moving back down towards his cock, which was trapped between their bodies. He began jerking Draco off in quick movements, his hips maintaining their steady pace as he aimed right for Draco’s prostate.
“Kinda,” Harry replied, shrugging. Ron did say that their plan included Harry keeping Draco away from Neville, and something about keeping the other Slytherins distracted so they don’t reform their unpenetrable group, but that was about it.
“Sounds like a deal,” Draco said. He almost missed it, even thinking that he might have misheard, but no, Draco was looking at him with a shy smile - and if that didn’t do things to Harry’s brain…
When they woke up though, that was something else. Malfoy had taken the liberty of going through Harry’s closet, demanding something “not atrocious” to wear.
Once he cut off the floo connection, he waved his wand towards the stray ashes that had flown everywhere and vanished them before making his way to the bathroom. After closing the door, he immediately began to strip his clothes, checking to see if he brought everything he needed.
“It’s only Malfoy, mate,” Ron laughed, patting him on the back. “Just keep your eyes on him and don’t look at the crowd. You’ll be fine.”
“I have been working for myself for 3 years to attend a Muggle Medical University, which I have been attending for 2 years, live in a shared flat with the other workers for low pay, and have been managing just fine on my own,” Malfoy stated firmly.
Or rather, like Draco did when he was fully awake, he conceded. Truly, these past 2 weeks have been rather eye-opening for Harry. Draco could hardly muster a decent summoning charm when he’d just woken up but, unfortunately for Harry, he was still rather adept with stinging hexes.
Draco froze, staring at him with wide eyes. Then Harry froze before pulling his hand away awkwardly.
Harry was being so patient with him, it made his heart clench. He felt so lucky to have him, making the initial embarrassment of having no experience disappear from his mind.
“Why do you look so glum?” she asked without taking a second to spare a glance at him. Harry briefly wondered how she knew and entertained the idea that he was starting to radiate brooding vibes before answering her instead.
“Hey, if it makes you feel any better I could set you and Draco to work on the Charms classroom and the other rooms in the second floor for the rest of the week,” Hermione suggested. “I would have made it the library instead, which would make it longer since you’d have to get through a bunch of books, but Madam Pince doesn’t want anyone touching them. Too delicate, she says.”
But no, the man wasn’t his, and there was a very real possibility he’d be with one of his friends in the near future. If his only chance to be close to Draco was as friends, then he’d rather not ruin it.
In the corner of his eye, he saw a pink flush wash over Draco’s pale features as well. Of all the ways for people to figure out about their relationship, it was because they both started showing up late.
“I hate you,” Harry huffed, turning onto his side. Yes, it was uncomfortable, but Harry was persistent. He extended his arm towards his partner’s face slowly, trying to see if he would catch him before he striked.
“He’s.. well. He’s a Slytherin, for starters,” he mumbled, avoiding eye contact as he scooped some eggs onto his plate. “And apparently they just got close over the summer.”
He zoned out for most of the sorting and spent his time talking to Dean and Seamus. The Sorting took a while since there were relatively more students coming in, along with transferees that are enrolled in the upper years. Once they were done, though, Headmistress McGonagall gave the rest of her announcements and let the feast begin.
Still unable to rid himself of his blush, Draco nodded meekly, allowing Harry to place a sweet kiss against his lips. Once he got his body to relax, Harry began rubbing circles around his entrance, pressing against the tight ring of his hole before rubbing the pad of his finger over it.
When they walked in, Harry was somewhat disappointed to note that it wasn’t much different from their own room in Gryffindor, bar that it seemed slightly more spacious as it was rectangular in shape rather than circular.
Snape was… questionable. Morally gray, not necessarily good. He shifted uneasily in his seat. Maybe Hermione had a point, but he wanted to make his own judgement, so he decided that maybe it would be best to observe for himself for now.
“Nothing, nothing,” Harry smiled, placing a kiss on his forehead. “Let me handle it next time, yeah?”
He could feel more saliva form in his mouth, causing some to spill out and get everywhere. It was messy, and he didn’t like it; somehow, it felt like he was doing something wrong. In an attempt to keep himself from drooling, he began sucking harder, making a weird sound as he did so.
Despite Harry’s defense against Draco’s accusations, he did feel really bad about messing up their project which Draco had spent weeks on, another product of their relationship, so he complied easily and walked out of the common room with the blond and headed to the dungeons.
“Potter, I’ve seen you dance at the Christmas Gala. Trust me, I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between you and your 4th year self if you waltzed side by side.” Draco teased, moving down a bit more and leaning his head back to tuck it under Harry’s chin.
“I won’t tell you what to do,” Bill said. “But don’t push yourself too hard over this. If you can’t do it or commit anymore, then don’t.”
“Would it be better if we went up to them instead?” Hermione whispered, something a handful of students that surrounded them seemed to be doing. Students from the two schools appeared to be looking at one another, trading glances and seemingly assessing the other.
, he hoped he would say. “The game, y’know? It’s going to be hard to keep it up if we’re too far apart, they could accuse us of cheating/”
“Potter, you’ve been on top of me and in my bed multiple times these past few weeks-” Harry’s ears burned. “-Besides, it’s not like we’re actually going to do anything.”
Harry concluded. He took a step back out of the doorway, preparing to leave as he added, “I better see you with Malfoy before the lunch break.”
Hiding his sudden embarrassment, he rested his head against Harry’s shoulder so he wouldn’t be able to see his expression. A finger slid between the crack of his arse and began running over the furled hole, making Draco gasp. He felt himself clench when the finger rubbed slowly over his entrance.
“Malfoy, Draco!” Some murmurs broke out across the Hall for reasons unknown to Harry. He suspected that some recognized his name, but then he heard a Ravenclaw from the other table squeal and shake the girl sitting next to her.
“I still had to wake up early,” Draco mumbled, kicking at the ground petulantly before lifting it up in one graceful sway and taking another step.
“You want me to tell you how I’m going to fuck you?” Harry asked, his breath ticking the sensitive spot behind his ear with every word. “How I’m going to fuck your tight arse until you come, clenching hard around my cock because you don’t want to let it go?”
“Of course it has,” Malfoy snorted, as if it were the most obvious question in the world. “It’s been worse, of course, so I should be fine.”
“First of all, this shouldn’t even be something we’re discussing,” Draco hissed, his face reddening further. He was thankful that it wouldn’t be evident through the flames, or else he’d really never hear the end of it from her once the whole issue was over.
“No, Draco,” Harry said seriously, cupping his chin gently while looking him in the eyes. There was so much concern and affection filled in them that Draco had to look a way, a strange sense of self-disappointment filling himself for reasons unknown to him. “It’s not supposed to hurt.”
“Yes, Potter,” Another voice drawled from the doorway. “I might be in an amiable mood, given the right compensation.”
When they arrived in the near-empty classroom, Draco immediately made a beeline for a seat near the front and in the corner. Harry followed him and occupied the only seat next to him before regretting it instantly. Kinda. He wasn’t in the mood to sit in front when he knew he would probably take a nap at some point, except he couldn’t exactly do that now since the teacher had an unobstructed view of him.
“I mean, I know bringing it up could be a bit strange, and even awkward,” Harry shrugged, giving him an easy smile. “But at least I would know what to do next time.”
“I hadn’t realized that you could do that,” Harry grumbled, suddenly wishing that he had brought something to personalize his own area in his dorm.
“Ohh, spill the beans later, mate,” Ron said excitedly, coming up behind them. The guests at the table, bar Lucious Malfoy, gave him a greeting. He flashed a quick smile at them before Draco asked why he looks like he ran a marathon to get to them. “Everyone’s been served. It’s time for you to dance.”
“Sure thing,” Harry agreed instantly, not wanting to give the blond a chance to change his mind and retreat. Draco climbed in and Harry immediately wondered if he could just leave Ron and Hermione to find their own carriage and take off with only Draco with him. He would have been doing them a favor. He knew what other students got up to when couples got carriages to themselves, anyway.
Draco was pretty sure he was already enjoying this, but took a deep, steadying breath anyway, letting his eyelids flutter shut as he enjoyed the way Harry played with his nipples.
Without even giving a chance for Ron to respond, he quickly turned around and began storming back to the castle.
“Right,” his best friend huffed. “I was just making sure that you’re thinking with your head and not your cock.”
“Well yeah,” Harry said awkwardly, not really wanting to expose what he and Draco do in their private time in the safety of their own home, a renovated Grimmauld Place. Both of them have developed some kind of routine where Wednesday evenings were just their night and tonight, Draco wanted to watch a Muggle film and eat popcorn.
“Yeah,” Malfoy sighed, relaxing himself once more. “I mean, thanks. I’m alright thanks to you, I suppose.”
“Not much,” Neville said, “You’ve been hanging around Draco all day, though,” Neville pointed out, giving him a rather skeptical look.
“I think I can handle it,” he said, attempting to give her a smile although he was sure it came out more as a grimace. “I’ll just-”
They shared a quick kiss, deciding there was more time for that later when they were alone, and began making their way to their shared room, far away from everyone else in the Manor. It was convenient for the time being, and they were planning on leaving for their honeymoon the next day anyway, spending it travelling wherever they wanted for a month.
“I’d say that was a success, wouldn’t you?” Hermione asked once most of the people had left the common room and retreated back into their dorms.
The angle was awkward and his arms were beginning to hurt a bit, but he kept going. He continued like that for another few minutes before figuring that it was enough and pulling out, the skin of his rim clinging to his fingers as he did so. He grimaced a bit at the slight stinging discomfort he felt but shrugged it off, reminding himself that he had to get ready in case Harry arrived early.
“It was never just a game for me too, you pillock!” Draco raised his voice as well. “Why would I dedicate 3 whole years to a game. I’ve lost Quidditch games faster.”
Harry was overcome with the urge to remind Ron that it was very unlikely, considering the fact that Hermione was sat there happily, albeit a tad awkwardly.
“So I take it that Ron has filled you in on the plan?” Neville asked him, leaning against one of the tables in the empty classroom.
“Sure,” his friends looked at him with some pity, but mostly amusement. “Promise me one thing, then,” Hermoine resolved. “You’ll do something about that crush of yours when the year starts. I don’t think you’ll be able to focus on your NEWTs like this.”
“Son of a Death Eater and he heads straight to Slytherin,” Ron scoffed, gathering more food onto his plate.
Harry shook his head, stepping back. Draco made a quick move to stand up, but Harry held his hand up. “I can’t do this anymore, Draco.”
There wasn’t too much rebuilding left to do at this point. The pillars that Harry and Ron are working on weren’t too damaged and are among just a few that were left standing. Everyone focussed on rebuilding rooms first and restoring the spell work in the structures. Now, they were focusing on the parts with minimal damage that could wait until later and organizing the furniture and whatnot inside every room.
Thankfully, the food arrived just in time. Draco was plating their dinner when he heard a knock on the door before smiling to himself. Even when he’s been given access to the floo, Harry likes to knock on his door and be let in properly so that he doesn’t accidentally catch Draco by surprise.
Harry knew what that felt like and immediately drew out his wand, casting a silencing charm around the four of them.
“Do you think you’ll be going to the Ministry Gala on New Years?” he asked, hoping that he could use this opportunity to finally ask Draco out.
“My mother sent me away, I’m afraid,” Malfoy’s voice hardened just a fraction, and Harry noticed the way his shoulders tensed. “Look, I just came to apologize on his behalf; Merlin knows he’d never do it himself. I also wanted to assure you that I do not share his beliefs and do not hope to cause you any trouble in the months I will be staying here. I understand your distrust of me, but I would like that we could remain civil, at the very least, in the meantime.”
“This is where the magic happens,” Malfoy said, inspecting the bananas and grabbing what seemed to be the largest banana in the bunch and unpeeled it. Then, ceremoniously, he held it by the edge and shoved it down his throat and held it there for a few seconds before pulling it out.
“That’s what happens when you’re a Pureblooded queer,” Malfoy sneered at Harry as if he thought the other man wouldn’t understand. In all fairness to him, Harry didn't. Not really.
“I, er,” Draco blushed, hiding his face in the crook of Harry’s neck. He mumbled something indecipherable, making Harry crane his neck away so he could look at Draco properly.
“So you’ve mentioned,” Ron muttered darkly. “If you could give me a good, solid reason on why I should trust him and think he’s anything like his father, then maybe I’ll consider it. For Hermione, of course.”
Harry rolled his eyes in response. “He’s not up to anything so why would I stalk him?” They both visibly relaxed and smiled.
“Yes, sir?” Harry responded, already dreading whatever lecture the Head Auror was about to give him. It was all there in his tone and Harry knew that it was going to be a long day.
“Of course I am,” Harry half expected him to bring up the fact that this was just a game, which often-times ruined his mood, but mentions of that from him were becoming noticeably less. “Never let it be forgotten that I am the reason this relationship functions.”
“As if I’m going to tell you that,” she glared. “If you’re going to be impossible, then just stop talking to me, alright.”
As he was moving his fingers, more squelching sounds filled the room, and Draco turned red at the realization that they were coming from
“So you guys will be helping him?’ Harry felt his heart sink. If his friends were rooting for Neville to ask Draco out, then he’d really look like an arse of a friend for trying to get in the way.
He began peppering soft kisses all over Draco’s face. His lips to the corner of his mouth, his nose, cheeks, eyelids, forehead. It took a while, but Draco eventually began to stir.
“Shove it, Malfoy,” Neville laughed, wrapping an arm around Draco’s shoulders and pulling him closer, making Harry’s stomach turn. Thankfully, he dropped the arm immediately after. “Sorry  about that, I was just convincing him that there was no need for a disco ball.”
He wanted to be happy for his friend, but he still couldn’t help the sick feeling in his gut. He’ll ask Hermione about it, that’s for sure. He thought back to their near-kiss before sleep finally took over him, though, and promised himself one thing.
“Why would I leave you alone with my mother? I’m not that rude,” He huffed. Harry smiled and ruffled his hair, something he does on occasion even though it annoys the blond to no end.
The only reason he practically forced himself to stop glaring was because he almost tripped over his own feet, his toes dragging across the surface of the floor with every step.
“Oh- oh fuck,” Draco gasped, arching his back while holding his knees tighter to his chest, hands and legs trembling. “What was that?”
“But it’s your house. Imagine what your grandmother would say when she finds out about your negligent hosting-”
Deciding that maybe honesty would do him some good in this situation, he sighed. “It just hurt a bit when you were-,” he cut himself off before feeling his face heat. “I mean, it’s normal, isn’t it? For the first time?”
That’s another thing Harry had to get used to since all this inter-house unity bollocks. Since Malfoy was technically friends with Hermione now, he had given himself the liberty of coming through a Gryffindor-filled room just to talk to her. Not that Harry minded. It just meant he got to see his rather attractive face more often.
Something he realized now that the war was over and since they were actively interacting with the git was that he was annoyingly attractive.
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked worriedly, taking a step closer and cupping his face. At least I can enjoy it for a while.
“Why is it funny?” Ron demanded, but the girl paid his question no mind. She was beginning to remind Harry a bit of Luna except… French.
“Later?” Draco asked, hopeful. Or maybe that was just Harry’s wishful thinking, but he agreed nonetheless.
“Ron,” Harry sighed again. How did Hermione put up with them so often? “Why don’t we at least give him a chance?”
“Draco sends you this note,” She said, handing him a piece of parchment. “But really, I think it’s best that you go and get ready yourse-”
“Okay then, just making sure,” Draco shrugged lightly in a rather un-Malfoyish gesture. “It wouldn’t look good for me to have dragged you to a boring party.”
“Sure, mate,” Harry shrugged. “But you do realize that you’re going to have to work something out with Hermione, right?”
“I thought of that too, but it could be because he only realized his feelings now, maybe?” Harry mumbled, eyes still downcast.
“Of course,” Harry said, trying to give her a comforting smile. He wasn’t sure of how he felt about leaving her alone with him for the rest of the day, but he knew that she could protect herself.
“If you don’t think Hermione isn’t planning to hold group study sessions for our year, you’ll be bloody disoriented real soon,” Ron snorted wryly, but there was still a tone of affection in his voice.
Harry was distracted and lost in his thoughts, but he was still able to pick up on Draco’s stumble. Choosing not to acknowledge it in case he assumed wrong, he just gave another shrug.
“Must you be so crass?” Draco huffed once he saw that she had stopped talking, a wide smirk plastered on her face.
“I don’t think so,” he shrugged. “From what I’m understanding, this means they might also have to take the student with them over the Easter Hols, and Grimmauld Place isn’t exactly the best place to\ be hosting guests right now.”
“First of all, his convict father fought against us in the war. It’s his family’s fault that Ginny ended up cursed back in second year, and he killed so many people,” Ron began. “And he’s just like him. Look at how he’s mingling with the other Slytherins. They’re probably bonding over their blood purist shit, and now he’s dragging my girlfriend with him.”
“Thanks!” Draco’s demeanor immediately went back to its thoughtful state, blushing slightly while flicking his wand towards the oven toaster and having their food levitated to them along with some plates.
“That’s all on you,” Ron shrugged, grinning at his girlfriend's enthusiasm. He leaned in to place a kiss on her cheek, causing Harry to move his gaze away from his two best friends, and notice that Draco was walking out of the Great Hall already.
“Drinks are in the kitchen, you guys help yourselves,” Neville grinned as everyone began to disperse, throwing themselves on one of the settees or making their way to the kitchen, most likely on a mission to get as shit faced as possible by the end of the night. Neville dropped himself beside Draco and said something lowly in his ear, causing Draco to lean in and, not long after, burst out into laughter.
“I can try,” he shrugged. It didn’t work out too well last time because it took down a bunch of gossip some Hufflepuff was sprouting from beside them, messing up the notes. “No promises though.”
“I trust you,” he said with a small shrug. “Can you just, maybe... help me understand this as we go?”
"Don't worry, love. I'll always be here to-Hey, I found another one,” Harry said, causing Draco to run over from his spot to observe it. “It’s kind of strange, though,”
“Because of your improvement in attendance over the past month, there is no need to bring this up to management,” Robards said, his tone implying that he was doing this favor only because they were good at their jobs. “But please see to it that this doesn’t happen again.”
“There was nothing to give,” Malfoy shrugged, only increasing Harry’s confusion further. As if sensing it, the blond continued. “I was disowned before the trials. Around the same time I let you escape from the Manor and my family went through my brain with a Legilimency.”
“Pansy, what the hell am I supposed to do?” Draco groaned, both from distress and the fact that his knees were starting to hurt from kneeling in front of the fireplace.
Whenever Draco said his last name now, it sounded more affectionate compared to every other time he used it in their previous years. It was a welcomed change, something that could probably remind Harry of happier things in the future rather than every time they fought in the past.
“Wouldn’t it make sense to have them sorted now so they can sit at their assigned houses already and get to know them?” Ron asked, but Harry was barely paying attention to their conversation. His attention was dead-set on a blond standing off in the second row on the far opposite end of the hall.
