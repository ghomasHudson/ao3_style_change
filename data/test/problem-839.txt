Draco furrowed his brows. “I did notice that your dreams are easily manipulated with emotions.” Harry took that as confirmation that he could in fact feel Draco’s emotions when they were dreaming.
Draco pulled his hand back in mock-offence. “Hey! In comparison to you, I still walk around. For the last few days, it was like you disappeared off the face of the earth.”
Harry’s heart didn’t want to calm down which he blamed on missing Draco so damned much. Before Draco could say anything, Harry grabbed the blonde by his hand and dragged him behind him. They didn’t have to walk for long before Harry found an empty classroom into which he pulled Draco. Harry let go off Draco’s hand and shut the door. Then he turned to him. Harry opened his mouth, wanted to say something that would explain everything but he couldn’t think of anything. Draco just stood in front of him and looked back unyielding.
“Because he just said you were being a wanker.”
Harry shook his head mechanically. “Damn it, Ron. I just had a stupid dream. I didn’t want a complete analysis of mine and Draco’s existence.”
“I don’t want- I just- You don’t understand!” Harry tried to explain but realized soon enough that he himself had no clue why he was behaving the way he was.
“Good mornin’, Malfoy,” Harry heard Seamus say.
Draco shook his head as if paralyzed looking over the list of ingredients. “That is not on the list, professor!”
So, he laid back and stared at the red drapes above him. It had been some time since he had been alone in a dream. It was weirdly one-sided but what in the name of Merlin had happened? Had he seriously dreamed about snogging Draco? Holy dragon shit, he needed to sort out his priorities. Harry rubbed his eyes in frustration. The holding hands and the fight with Ron must’ve confused him. Simple. It meant nothing. Not all dreams had some deeper meaning. To be fair, he had never dreamed about a wild snogging sesh with a friend before but he was going through a lot at the moment.
“It’s not my fault that you were late!” Harry interrupted him also growing angry.
Harry shrugged. “Well yeah, obviously. We’ve got detention together,” Harry tried staying rational.
“No need to get angry, Potty,” Draco shot back with his little confident smirk.
“Kissed. We kissed.”
Draco took a step back in astonishment. “I do not know,” he admitted. Harry’s intentions were still unclear to him.
Eventually, they changed the topic to their plans for the upcoming weekend to visit Hogsmeade. Hermione hoped for snow but Harry doubted that would happen. November had just begun and was rather showing its autumnal side this year. Harry really wanted to go on a little trip with his friends but the debate on whether to go to Three Broomsticks Inn or Hog’s Head didn’t interest him much. After a bit, Ginny, Seamus and Dean got involved as well and Harry realized this was quickly becoming a full-on discussion, so he decided to stay out of it.
Slughorn eyed Harry first, then Draco. “Did you ingest any of that potion?” he asked sternly. Draco looked at Harry who looked back angrily.
“In case you see Hermione,” Ron began a little awkwardly. “Please tell her that we’re good again. She’s still angry with me.” Harry cocked an eyebrow but grinned. Ron grimaced. “You could at least pretend to be sympathetic.”
Draco was already there and busy with writing. Slughorn gave Harry a quick run-down of the assignment and then luckily left both of them right away. This time each of them had a book to copy so they were sitting at separate tables. Harry mulled over how to approach Draco about his relationship to grades for a good half hour before he bravely grabbed both of the sandwiches, went over to Draco’s table and stood in front of it.
“Lone Slytherins,” Draco shot back shortly. They also reached their destination and stepped into the classroom. Before Harry could question Draco’s remark any further, Slughorn instructed them to their usual copy work and stayed the whole time with them to supervise.
“You and Malfoy always had a little bit too much passion in your relationship. If that was as enemies or not. It was sorta obvious that a change to friendship wouldn’t be dramatic enough for you two,” Ron explained rationally.
Draco grabbed the still hot kettle next to him without thinking twice and threw the brew inside it in Harry’s direction. But due to it being hot he quickly let go of it burning his hands and let out a quiet hiss of pain.
As the explosion ended Draco moved closer to the table putting his wand away with a casual turn of the wrist. The Howler stayed intact as expected, it just completely destroyed it’s surrounding. The open envelope fumed dangerously but Draco grabbed it and put it away in his pocket.
“And well, then I thought I would just become friends with him. It sounded logical. We could understand each other in a way that probably nobody else could. Somehow it made sense in my head. I didn’t care what anyone else thought about it which might’ve not been completely right of me to do. I know I should’ve been more honest with you and Hermione, but it was all getting better between me and Draco. He’s even nice to me. In a very Draco-ish fashion nice but it still felt right in a way. I got the feeling, I could trust him. Everything is alright when I’m with him, you know. You can even have fun with him. Draco Malfoy is funny. If that isn’t a surprise, then I don’t even know. But then…,”
Harry huffed. “Torso. Right side.”
“Stop moving!” Draco snapped, using his hands to press on Harry’s ribs.
“Once a Death-Eater always a Death-Eater,” Harry could swear he saw a strange mark sticking out the guy's arm, “Did you forget that?”
“Yes, I stayed to make sure you didn't die in your sleep.”
My partner. Draco was thankful that the streetlights were dim enough that this blush was hidden. "Luckily, it seems like no one saw anything," Draco changed the subject, "so if you could get up-" Draco cut himself off as he got a better look at Harry's face. "Is that a black eye?".
After she spoke, no one else said something. Harry just wished that the earth could swallow him so he could escape the conversation, but just standing up and leaving the Great Hall when it was at its fullest looked too suspicious, and the thing he wanted to evade the most was people staring at him.
“I'm not your dog, Harry.”
“You're really funny without noticing, Potter” Draco said while viewing outside the castle, “What do you think about working outside?”
Harry was already regretting his words after seeing the opposite reaction, so he quickly shook his head while moving his hands awkwardly, “I'm sorry! I don't know why I said that. Just forget it, okay? maybe I should go and get something from the kitchens-”
Draco shook his head defensively. “That is enough, Potter. We are not friends, what is wrong with you?” Harry wasn’t so sure himself but the concern for Draco opened a door to a whole new set of emotions for Draco. Positive emotions.
“Could you just please wait a second?” Harry asked without really allowing a “no” for an answer. Draco didn’t say anything and just gave him a questioning look. Harry frowned.
Harry shot Draco an evil look. “You’d like that,” he hissed angrier with himself that he even got into this embarrassing situation.
“You did the right thing. Slughorn will undo this within the next couple of days and you won’t need to share any more dreams with Malfoy,” Hermione placated Harry’s pessimism.
Slughorn just commented on his arrival with a “Find yourself a partner and commence with the assignment.” Draco hurriedly looked around for an empty spot and was instantly filled with the desire to turn around and flee. Apparently, there was still one left. Next to Harry bloody Potter. Draco let his eyes search the room desperately hoping for another empty seat. But of course, there wasn’t one. This should not have come as a surprise to him with his luck lately. Letting out a frustrated sigh, he walked straight over to Potter’s table and stopped more confidently than he felt in front of it.
“I do not know,” Draco spoke up a few seconds later.
“I was just walking outside with you and Hermione.”
“Maybe you two should get a room if you want to be undisturbed,” Blaise suggested.
Draco did take a step back now but didn’t let go of the railing. Harry simply followed.
Suddenly, Harry felt something warm against his skin. He opened his eyes surprised and watched how Draco put his hand over Harry’s first and then hold it. Harry looked over at Draco but he just looked straight ahead. So, Harry leaned back again and focused on the slowly fading warmth from Draco’s hand for the next few minutes.
Harry suddenly shot awake and looked around panicked. Hermione had walked up to the side of his bed and was looking down at him with a stern expression on her face. Harry hurriedly hid his erection by sitting up and pulling the blanket over his lap. Hermione seemed like she could care less about Harry’s confusion.
Draco just sighed. Harry looked at the Slytherin. He really looked relaxed. Still a bit tired but the dark bags under his eyes were almost gone. And a little colour had returned to his cheeks.
“Boys, boys, boys. Please settle down,” Slughorn finally said but ended up being ignored by everyone involved.
“Then I’ll go to Slughorn,” Harry promised more or less convincing.
“Do you mean in the dream or…?” Ron asked having overheard the conversation.
Harry laughed nervously. “I don’t think it’s pity. I’m beginning to understand you. Like for real. But at the same time everything in me is fighting to want to understand anything. I don’t know.” Harry looked carefully over to Draco who was looking at him with furrowed brows. Neither of them spoke. Harry observed his fingers touching each pad to another.
“What are you waiting for, Potter?” He asked. He sounded undoubtedly annoyed.
“Luna thinks that you’ve gotten nicer.”
“The question should be why you are even considering this,” Hermione shot back. She was sitting on the floor of the Gryffindor common room with her legs pulled up to her chest and arms wrapped around them. Ron, sitting behind her on an armchair, nodded in agreement.
“I am quite certain that I get a say in that too.” A very familiar voice said right next to Harry’s ear making him freeze up.
then tell me why you’re fighting with Ron because of him?”
Harry frowned. “It doesn’t.”
“Mr. Potter! No running in the halls. And I have to ask you to go to your dorm room immediately!” The headmistress chided him sternly.
Draco interrupted Harry by standing up straight and shouldering his bag. Harry shot a look behind him and saw Blaise leaving the classroom. He looked a bit annoyed but his expression was controlled. Just a few seconds later, Ron also came out. His desperate expression spoke volumes. Harry gave Draco a quick look who nodded at him and quickly walked over to Blaise. Ron joined Harry.
“Isn’t that a bit too much touching for you?” Harry teased. Draco who pulled his hand away in response gave him a mock evil eye. Then both of them went down the staircase into the warmth.
Harry frowned. “No, I was too busy falling off my chair,” Harry replied accusingly.
“It’s about Draco…,” Harry began carefully. Ron paused for a moment but then nodded and stopped putting away the figures to give Harry his attention. “I don’t know how to put this,” Harry considered kneading his hands nervously. Ron frowned. “It’s complicated,” Harry tried to explain.
Harry expectantly observed Draco’s reaction which changed from confused to satisfied. Almost a little condescendingly a smirk made its way to his lips. “I forgive you, Weasel.”
Harry could not believe what he just said and didn’t dare looking up. The scratching of the quill had stopped but Draco didn’t reply right away. Slowly, Harry did look up and was met with Draco’s grey eyes trying to stare into his soul. Harry gulped.
Harry blinked surprised. He didn’t even notice how intensely he’d been staring. “Don’t you think too that-,”
“Where’s the fun it that? So, spill. Looked like it worked!” Draco stated happily.
“And anyway, you have a talent in picking out people to be attracted to that are inappropriate: Cho, whose ex-boyfriend just died, Ginny, who’s your best friend’s sister and now your former sworn enemy. Doesn’t sound very shocking when you put it like that,” Ron stated sneering.
“Hi, sorry, don’t want to bother you but we’re slowly packing up and wanted to ask if you two are coming back as well,” Neville’s voice interrupted the quiet.
Draco sighed frustratedly and put his head in his hands. “I am taking the Dreamless Sleep potion.” He spoke so quietly that Harry nearly didn’t hear him.
It was nice walking through the melting snow, telling each other dumb stories and just having fun. They didn’t meet many other students which helped them relax further. Harry knew that his friends had wanted to go to the Three Broomsticks Inn so he lead Draco quickly to the Hog’s Head straight across the field instead. He could imagine that Draco was grateful for it. They stepped back onto the path that was barely free of snow and came to a halt in front of the worn-down inn. Draco suddenly decided to wait outside, probably to avoid running into any other students which could turn the situation uncomfortable. Harry agreed and stepped into the inn alone.
Seamus didn’t let off though and followed Harry to the shared dorms. “Come on, Harry. There has to be something interesting happening if you three are getting all serious. Did you get in a fight with Malfoy again?” Seamus sat down carelessly on Harry’s bed and watched Harry grab his pyjamas.
“What do you want to begin with?” he asked expectantly.
“Harry, please eat something,” Hermione said which Harry obeyed in slow-motion.
“An’ then wot?” Ron asked mouth open, his fork of bacon waiting in front of it for quite a while now.
As soon as he put foot on the deck, he felt the icy wind pull at his clothes and hair. Draco sat a few meters away leaning against a wall. He didn’t even look over at Harry but instead left his eyes closed. Slowly Harry went over to the blonde and stopped uncertainly in front of him.
“But if it doesn’t get better…” Hermione said carefully.
Again, Harry felt his cheeks blushing. “I dream,” Harry began, “about Malfoy.” Harry didn’t dare look at the Slytherin but saw out of his peripheral Draco facepalming.
Draco threw him a doubtful look. “That just does not work,” Draco said again slowly.
Harry grinned boyishly. “Too bad, came here for nothing then.”
Draco shook his head. “I told you it wouldn’t work.”
And so, the young wizards procrastinated the whole day with all their might and only started with their essays late into the evening. Hermione took pity on them quite quickly and helped. She was probably just too frustrated witnessing the mistakes in the essays of her best friends. Around midnight, Harry finally went to sleep.
“I understand that it’s difficult but maybe that Dreamless draught is a good compromise. You know, to calm them down a bit,” Theo tried again.
Harry tilted his head. “Or you could just tell me if it’s interesting.”
“Yes, but not like usually!”
With that Harry hurried back to his table and finished his assignment. He didn’t find out anything about the relationship of his dreams to Draco’s memories. But asking him straight out obviously wouldn’t work. Firstly, because Harry acted more cowardly than he was and secondly, because it could actually be risky. If Draco wanted to, he could hex off Harry’s balls here and now and the Gryffindor would rather avoid that. There had to be another way. The enlightening idea came to Harry just as he was already on his way to the Gryffindor common room but it was enough to speed up his pace from walking to running.
Draco threw him a quick look. “You could come as well if you want,” he offered looking straight forward again.
“But be on time, Harry dear. No dates after 8PM!” was the last comment Seamus made before finally getting a move on.
The trio were now lounging in their common room. It was already evening but the events from the Potions class were still at the forefront of their minds. Seamus Finnigan had joined them as well. He was absent that morning due to a headache and was very interested in what had happened.
“I’m sorry…” Harry heard then Ron say quietly.
Draco was in the dorms trying to get some rest, which had proven itself impossible several times now. He was going to murder the next couple that would stumble in there trying to shag. Those stupid kids had probably never had firewhiskey in their life before.
Draco sighed. “No, you do not.” The Slytherin glanced at the door seemingly considering his options.
“I can’t exactly empathize but I understand.”
“Perfect. So, what are we making?” tried Draco to keep the conversation light.
Draco grinned. “The Quidditch field isn’t quite done yet but the goalposts are up. Blaise got the equipment. If we get caught, we’ll be in big trouble but it will be still fun.”
“You walked into the dungeons just to tell me that?” Draco asked unbelievably.
Ron nodded slowly.
Back in the Gryffindor common room he overheard Ron and Hermione arguing about him and Seamus betting with Dean and Neville on how long this crisis would last. Harry just pretended to be very focused on studying but he couldn’t help glancing at the time every few minutes waiting to finally be able to go to bed. And when it was finally time, Harry just got disappointed by another dreamless night.
“Hey,” Neville tried with a friendly tone. “Did everything go alright?”
Harry gave Draco an apologetic look. “Seamus doesn’t mean all that.”
Draco rolled his eyes and pulled his own hand away instead. “I am not nice.”
Harry ignored the comment and waited for Draco to start walking again so they could walk together. They didn’t have to walk very far until they reached a bleak stone wall.
Draco shot Harry a confused look. “What is this about exactly?” he asked now looking at the teacher.
Harry cocked an eyebrow. “And you care?”
“Draco, didn’t know you had a personal bodyguard,” Theodore added amused. Harry was doing his best to not look at Blaise.
Harry cocked an eyebrow challengingly. “What’s so awful about Quidditch?”
But Harry interrupted him. “It’s not complicated. In fact, it has never been this uncomplicated. Frankly, I don’t understand your problem.”
He was exhausted, annoyed and slightly drunk, which just intensified the former two. He just wanted to sleep darn it! Was that really too much to ask for?!
“Are you for real?” Harry asked stunned.
"Whatever makes you sleep better at night. I've got better to do than waste my time on you, Potter." Draco picked up his clothes and started to get dressed again.
Ron shrugged. “Thought you might be angry with him.”
“You did what?!” Draco intervened shocked.
“Just ignoring it would be for the best. Even if it is true and Malfoy is gay, it is none of your business. Just act as if nothing happened,” Hermione stated.
“The Flobberworm slime now!” Draco yelled before realizing it was at the other end of the table. Harry dove rather gracelessly across table almost knocking over the cauldron onto Draco.
Seamus shrugged. “Yeah well, it has only been a few weeks since you broke up and she sometimes gives you that sad look during meals. I thought maybe you would want to talk?”
“Godric Gryffindor would surely be proud of you,” Ron taunted.
A smile crept onto Harry’s lips. It wasn’t even a big deal, they hung out all the time anyway, but the actual fun stuff only happened in their dreams so this was a first.
“Longbottom, take a hint and get lost,” Draco growled half-heartedly.
“You should still observe this. If this keeps happening something definitely is not right,” said Hermione decidedly and glared at Ron to shut him up as he opened his mouth to disagree.
“I have no idea what you are trying to imply but I am going to bed now,” said Hermione pointedly getting up and went upstairs without uttering another word. Ron glared at Seamus before hurrying after his girlfriend. Harry watched them amusement dancing in his eyes but then decided too to get a good night of rest.
“Why are you runnin’, Malfoy? Scared? Are you gon’ shit your pants?” asked the bigger one. Draco kept walking as he suddenly heard a “Put your wands away, let him be and get lost.” Draco turned around and stilled. Harry Potter scared both of the Hufflepuffs with effectively evil looks away and walked over to Draco. He stopped in front of Draco and looked uncertainly over Draco’s shoulder into empty air. Draco furrowed his brows.
Harry looked back to Draco. “Okay,” he said a bit too quietly.
Harry paused for a moment to collect his thoughts. “I’m offering again to bury the hatchet since we both messed up. But if you get involved in mine and Draco’s friendship again, we’re done. That is not something a best friend would do.” With that Harry finished his thought-out speech. Ron looked a little overwhelmed unable to say something. So he just nodded slowly.
For the whole day and the next one he managed successfully to only get up for bathroom breaks and otherwise pretend to be dead - lucky for him he had some experience in that. By now he had come to the conclusion that he was an idiot like everyone had always said so he just deserved to be lonely. Hermione nearly beat him out of bed on Thursday evening but then gave up when Harry said he was ready to apologize to Ron the next time he saw him. Before Harry had to face Ron, he decided he’d rather catch a dreamless nap.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “As if you don’t know.”
Draco smirked. “So, the Weasley is worse than the Dark Lord?”
“You are late,” Draco said now looking up at Harry.
“Fuck,” murmured Harry into the room. He got up and went to shower. The others would get up soon too and he needed to compose himself first.
“You just don’t want to talk about it because I’m right!” Ron said self-satisfied smirk firm in place.
“Do you want to tell us at least what you want to talk about with him today?” Hermione asked a bit softer. Harry considered this. He wasn’t quite sure.
“I don’t think so. He surely would have said something.”
“As long as I want to,” Harry replied sputtering a bit.
Harry groaned. “I am. But also, much more, I don’t know what else all I’m feeling for that tosser.”
His heartbeat quickened with every step. Harry needed to really think about what he would say. Since it was Saturday a couple Slytherins walked by him looking surprised. Some also whispered to each other. Harry was sure that some of them were already actively sharing his freak-out with others but right now he had more important things to worry about.
“You will be working alone today. Mr. Malfoy wasn’t feeling very well so we agreed that he would write a paper instead.”
“Let’s go!” shouted Harry. Ron just nodded and both boys left their dorm instantly still dressed in pyjamas.
“Good, don’t you want to sit?” Harry asked quickly and moved over a bit. Luna sat down next to him but not so that her feet were under the table but so that she could stand right back up again.
“You can’t just-,” Draco started but then sighed. “We cannot just be nice to each other.”
“Luna,” he stated as soon as he had his heartbeat back under control. The Ravenclaw was standing diagonally behind him and smiled dreamily.
“If you had even a speck of humanity left in you, you would’ve known that Harry deserves a better friend than you, so, piss off and don’t come back.” Ron thought he saw all colour leave Malfoy’s face and any life disappearing out of his eyes. But before Ron could regret his decision he turned away and hurried to his Charms class.
“You said that not everyone is as careless about their grades like me. I figured you do care.” Harry felt proud of his lie but still felt a little strange.
Harry made sure none of the others were eaves-dropping before turning his attention on Ron. “I’m aware I shouldn’t have lost it like that but what you did is not something I can or will forgive just like that.” Ron opened his mouth but then decided against saying something so Harry continued. “You did not only lie to me, but you also sabotaged a friendship even though you knew I didn’t want you to get involved. I… I can see that you were also disappointed in me for lying to you but that does not justify threatening Draco and then not even having the guts to tell me yourself about it. You knew absolutely well how miserable I was and you still didn’t say anything.”
“I’m walking with you,” Harry said unimpressed. Draco just stopped and Harry nearly kept walking.
“If he stayed up half the night because of it then he’s the weird one about ignoring this. How are you supposed to ignore that he looks like he flew into the Whomping Willow?” Harry looked up to eye Draco again and caught him looking away. Draco looked tired but it wasn’t as bad as Ron made it out to be.
“Why eternity? That can’t have been more than ten minutes?” Harry asked surprised.
Ron ran his hand frustrated through his hair. “Sensitive? Do you even know what this piece of scum did to my family, Hermione or me? And you’re here acting like he’s your new bestie. If someone here is out of their mind, it’s you!”
“It was just a dream… I am… alright,” Draco tried again and sounded sort of pained.
“It’s private. I don’t really feel comfortable just talking about his memories.” His best friends looked surprised.
Slowly he looked up. Neville looked at him patiently, Dean and Seamus couldn’t quite hide their curiosity but they had the decency to not say anything. Harry heard Neville say calming things but the feeling of sadness still took over. He wanted to, no, he had to talk with Draco. He couldn’t believe he had accused Draco of something that his best friend had done. And Ron hadn’t even deemed it necessary to say anything even after they had quit fighting.
They spent the rest of the way back discussing various Quidditch teams. Draco wasn’t all that involved anymore why he let Harry catch him up on the newest results. Their hands only separated just before the Entrance Hall, where their ways would part as well but they only paused their conversation to pick it back up in their dream.
Draco rolled his eyes immediately. “Please don’t, Potty. Since I’ve been taken this potion my concentration leaves much to be desired.”
“You think he stayed up all night?” Ron asked.
Harry could hardly concentrate his thoughts drifting to his dreams but he tried his best to ignore everything and to follow Ron’s advice. It was just a strange dream. Nothing more. Nothing less.
“Water really has something calming about it,” Harry said lost in thought. The water reminded him in an absolutely normal and not romantic way of Draco.
“With Harry you never know. Nobody would’ve thought that he’d become such a Malfoy fan either,” Ron said.
“Shut it, Zabini,” Draco grumbled trying to ignore his friends. He was not quite happy with what memory Harry was able to witness last night but he did not feel judgement at any moment which calmed him a little. Draco rubbed his eyes and supressed a yawn. This whole dreaming situation gave him almost no actual rest.
So, Harry did.
“Mr. Malfoy, did you have a similar experience?” Slughorn asked before Draco could worm his way out of the conversation. Now Harry was curious. Draco looked uncertain on how to answer the question and just opened and closed his mouth like a fish not saying anything. Harry frowned. Was he considering to lie? Why?
“I’m just being nice.”
“Damn it, Harry.” Ron shook his head a bit disappointed but just went back to his book. His essays wouldn’t write themselves after all.
“I am not a stupid errand boy,” suddenly a familiarly whiny voice reached Harry’s ear. Surprised, he and his friends looked up and not a second later Draco appeared with Blaise Zabini behind him and stopped in their aisle noticing them.
“Mate, you can’t keep this up forever,” Ron remarked which earned him a reproachful look from Hermione. Harry shrugged and stared disgustedly at the scrambled eggs in his plate.
Ron laughed. “I thought that potion gave one clarity of one’s consciousness, not making them dream out of the eyes of other people!” Harry looked confusedly from Hermione to Ron and then back to Hermione.
Harry nodded decidedly. “After all this is about us. And I can’t let you walk around like this any longer, you look terrible.”
“If it bothers you, maybe I really should.”
“Nothing. Took it accidentally with me,” Harry said hurriedly and put the parchment in his pocket. Ron just nodded and they made their way to History of Magic.
Harry nodded. “Me too.”
Draco grinned challenging. “Where did our tough Gryffindor go?”
“Wow, Malfoy looks like he’s been THROUGH it,” Ron remarked. He was right. Dark circles under Draco’s eyes made him look even paler and his hair looked messy too. The tie looked like it had been tied in a hurry. Just overall, he looked… tired.
Seamus waved it off. “All good. You go clear things with your blondie.”
Harry nodded thankfully. “You’re not that bad, you know,” it slipped out of Harry unfiltered.
“Unmotivated?”
“Harry, please let Ron apologize,” Dean pleaded with too innocent puppy eyes.
“I am not going to give away the password in front of a Gryffindor,” Draco announced.
“You can’t know that. Harry said that they were drunk and a kiss doesn’t the same to everyone,” Hermione shot back just as indignant.
Draco smiled amused. “It only gets fun when the date was good. And unfortunately, it wasn’t regarding to your highly valued opinion, Potty,” Draco teased.
Hermione shook her head. “Harry you are not just dreaming from his perspective. You are dreaming Malfoy’s dreams! You are in his head.”
Harry's eyes widened even more. "H- How... What?!"
“Wha-,” was the only thing Harry managed to splutter as he stumbled back and he held himself upright by leaning on a table behind him.
Harry sighed. “You wouldn’t understand. Nobody does. That’s also why Ron flipped out. If I had any say in this, none of this would’ve even happened.”
Two things I want to say before you go ahead.
“I assumed you wouldn’t take it well. It was after bedtime after all.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Come on, you don’t have to help me cheat again then.”
“Come on, let him be. You are the unwanted ones here.” Harry’s jaw nearly dropped at Draco’s words.
Surprised, Harry nodded. It made sense but it was still strange.
Draco nodded. “Yeah, he wanted us to wait for him after breakfast.”
Harry smiled uncertainly. “Hey.”
"No!" Draco interrupted him quickly. "No way would I shag you, Potter."
Slughorn stared doubtfully at him for a couple of seconds, then he looked up noticing someone behind Harry. “Mr. Malfoy, please follow me and Mr. Potter right now into my office. The rest of you get the ingredients listed on the board ready.”
Ron yawned loudly while serving himself way too much bacon which earned him a judgemental look from Hermione. Hermione had pulled both of her best friends out of bed quite early for a Saturday so they would have enough time to finish all their assignments. Harry was actually a little behind because detention was taking up quite a bit of his time. The Great Hall got fuller as time passed and Harry couldn’t help but glance at the entrance every couple seconds to see when the Malfoy-Squad would show up.
For a while they walked in silence until Harry broke it. “Why didn’t you tell Slughorn anything earlier?”
As promised, here's the next chapter <3
Although, it was quite hot. Draco’s lips on his own, Draco’s warm body pressed against him. Harry wanted to curse as his slowly softening erection sprung to attention again at those thoughts. How the bloody hell was he going to meet Draco’s eyes without him instantly knowing about Harry’s dreams? And still, Harry forced himself to close his eyes and quickly fell back asleep.
Hermione just shook her head and murmured something that sounded awfully close to “childish”.
"Did we..."
at that and give Draco a few sympathy points. Absolutely logical. And his worry now was also logical.
“Sounds small when we were just talking about Voldemort,” Harry added grinning.
Soon enough he was victorious and observed how Draco was sipping bored at a cup of pumpkin juice while Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini were almost jumping at each other’s throats over Draco’s head, they were obviously fighting. Blaise seemed to find the whole situation uncomfortable but Pansy seemed like she couldn’t care less and kept bombarding him with arguments.
Draco rubbed his forehead still confused but slowly nodded. “Alright, fine, but not now. I- later, in the evening. After dinner, where we were last time.” With that Draco turned around and hurried to his common room to process what just had happened.
“What do you have now?” Draco asked.
“Isn’t it hopelessly romantic?” Draco asked amused.
Harry actually gaped this time. “She did what?” he asked overwhelmed.
“Maybe Malfoy was right,” Ron tried slowly. “Maybe it’s better like this for you.”
“That is actually strange,” Hermione muttered. “It was obvious that you would find out something personal about Malfoy eventually but that you can’t remember your own dream is strange.”
Hermione just managed to pull Ron aside as Harry rushed to him. Blind with disappointment, anger and confusion he stumbled, thanks to Hermione, into empty space and instantly got grabbed by Seamus and Dean who had been standing behind Ron to stop him from trying to attack Ron again.
Harry paid no mind to them as he noticed the arrival of a certain Slytherin followed by his friends. Draco was speaking with Blaise Zabini. He seemed a bit out of it. Blaise kept shaking his head talking seriously.
A silence laid over both of them which only got interrupted by the sounds of the night – probably from the forbidden forest. Harry felt the cold wind slowly creep under each layer of clothing which made him turn his head and eye Draco. Draco wasn’t looking at him but his profile wasn’t even that bad to look at. The blonde hair was moving a little with the wind and sometimes nearly fell in his eyes. Draco’s slim lips fit well with his otherwise rather sharp features. Harry had to admit that the Slytherin was really not ugly. Draco now turned his head as well and looked back at Harry.
Hermione and Ron were arguing if the Quidditch results or the news were more important and they didn’t look like they were going to agree anytime soon. Harry used that opportunity to scan the Slytherin table for Draco Malfoy.
Ron groaned annoyed. “Then don’t expect me to help you with future Malfoy problems either.”
“Are you always going to bring dinner now?” Draco asked eyebrows raised.
Draco tensed but kept walking with Harry. “That is none of your concern.”
Harry was pretty impressed by the guts they had. “Sounds good! I won’t even tell on you.”
Ron turned to her. “What? He looked so miserable I just had to say something. After all, he’s the reason that Harry is feelin’ like shit!”
“Would you stop being like this? You know that that potion would only cause trouble but even if you wanted to take it, that’s no reason to just give up on all of it,” Harry tried to put things into perspective.
“Did Potter keep you up again?” Blaise teased him amusedly.
“You are not ditching this now!” Harry said sternly realizing what the blonde was thinking. “If you piss off, I’ll get in trouble as well and two weeks detention is more than enough for me.” Draco rolled his eyes but did turn to his parchment and picked up his quill again. Harry continued writing contently.
“I don’t care, okay? It doesn’t bother me. For all that I care we could pretend as if nothing had happened,” Harry interrupted him probably sounding not all that convincing. Draco furrowed his brows but his stature relaxed.
“Transfiguration,” Harry replied. He knew that Draco had Arithmancy so he didn’t need to ask. “I would rather skip,” Harry admitted.
“How did you do it?” Harry asked looking down at his hands. “Those feelings you felt… I felt so helpless.”
The studying was quite productive. Harry held back on complaining and Draco tried to see the positive in Harry’s work. They moved along quickly but after three hours, Harry’s concentration started fading.
“Who do we have here?” Pansy sing-songed arms crossed and standing in front of Harry.
Harry quickly shook his head. “No if Ron’s right and it is a false alarm; I’m not only going to look stupid but could get us in even more trouble. Or imagine, Draco finding out I’m dreaming about him at night!” Harry laughed quiet and insecure.
They were lucky. Hermione was like a lot of times up earlier and was finishing up one of her essays in the quiet common room dipped in soft golden morning light streaming in from the windows. She was just about to comment on their early rising and appearance but Harry was quicker.
“Don’t get too excited, Malfoy,” Ron warned but there was no real malice behind the words.
Harry’s heart beat wildly in his chest as he tried his best to not look for the blonde. Slowly he got himself a bowl of pumpkin soup. Ron looked at him prompting him, but Harry just shook his head. He had to first mentally prepare himself. Ginny and Hermione were luckily busy with their conversation which is why nobody noticed Harry just stirring his soup lost in thought. What if he did have feelings for Draco? What would be the next move? And wasn’t there a risk of Draco finding out about all of it through one of their dreams? Harry was quite sure that he wouldn’t be able to hide his feelings from Draco. On the other hand, what was the alternative? Now it was too late anyway and to know for certain could only help. Then he could at least actively decide against it.
Instead of paying attention in class Harry spent the whole day pondering about how to act around Draco during detention. It was strange because they actually got along well when there were just the two of them but Draco’s sleeplessness and the dream complicated everything a bit. Harry would like to act as if it didn’t interest him that Draco didn’t seem to have anything against kissing men but he couldn’t. He literally was Draco. He had also felt the lips, the heavy body on top of him and the erection that rubbed against him. Harry had to get himself together before he started drooling. Merlin, that was awkward. Surely these feelings were Draco’s. They must’ve projected into Harry making it so that he couldn’t even look at Blaise. Harry wondered if Draco would tell Blaise about it. What would he have to say? He didn’t even want to imagine.
“I’m not angry!” Harry growled losing his patience.
Harry eyed the greenish blubbering liquid in front of him. “Did it work?”
Just as the encouraging words left Theo’s mouth, the opening appeared again and gave way to the entrance. Harry’s heart skipped a few more beats this time and then started beating even faster as he recognized the blonde hair behind the black-haired young woman. Pansy arrived first in front of Harry but Harry didn’t even glance at her. Draco didn’t look any better than he had in the entrance hall just now but at the moment it was the best sight Harry could imagine for him.
Draco nodded, pretending not to notice the way Harry was gritting his teeth. He resolved to use a pain relief spell as soon as they were inside.
They both started walking towards the black door that opened itself with a flick of Draco's wand. Harry felt a wave of warmth envelop him as they passed the threshold, like a welcoming hug for his shivering body. From the outside, Draco's house looked like it'd be similar to what time ago was the Malfoy manor, but on the inside, it was the total opposite. Rugs covered the dark wood floor under each piece of furniture, and despite the monochromatic (green, of course) colour scheme, it was still very home-like.
“Okay,” Draco broke the silence and took the sandwich. He eyed it again a bit suspiciously but then took a bite. Harry observed him tensed. Draco put down the sandwich next to him and took his quill back into his hand. Before he started writing again, he glanced up at Harry.
"I just want to show him how fond I am of him", she said drunkenly but Harry knew the truth.
“Draco, there you are. We wanted to pick you up but Slughorn said you already left.” Harry turned around and instantly wanted to sink into the ground.
Harry shook his head amused. “His name’s Ron, by the way.”
(Harry)
Draco shrugged. “I don’t call you Harry either.” Harry’s skin prickled slightly. Draco had never said name this calmly, almost soft.
Ron looked at him like he lost his mind. “Mate, you can’t seriously think that! That has nothing to do with each other. You had a very strange dream. That’s it!” Harry shrugged looking over at Hermione again who was thoughtfully playing with her hair.
Draco shook his head. “Different time perception.”
“I have to warn you that your parents did ask for a response on your decision.”
After stumbling along the halls for a while - he could've sworn that the stairs were changing directions - he found himself on the seventh floor in front of a big wooden door with a glass doorknob. The Room of Requirement? Perfect!
Seamus grinned knowingly. “Why don’t you want to talk about it? Were you hoping to go on a late-night stroll with Ron instead?” Ron gaped and stared baffled at Seamus.
Harry had already updated his best friends on the current events last night so luckily, he didn’t have to go through that now. The walk to the Great Hall for breakfast was exhausting. Harry felt like his brain had been scrambled during the night. So, it was no surprise that he barely touched his food and just massaged his temples eyes closed. He nodded over at Draco once which just earned him a headshake in return. Hermione watched the whole interaction sceptically.
Thoughtlessly, he poked a few peas with his fork, when he noticed Draco observing him. As soon as he noticed Harry’s look his expression brightened and he tapped his left ring finger making a questioning gesture. Harry rolled his eyes and flipped him the bird which nearly got the other one laughing. Then he shot Harry a mock-flirty wink and turned back towards his friends. At least, Draco seemed to find this whole thing rather amusing than insulting. However absurd it was, in the end this whole thing was in a way a compliment for that bastard.
Draco shook his head in confusion. “What?”
“What do you think he’s going to do?” Harry asked carefully.
“Find out what?! I don’t even know what this all means,” Harry said pointedly.
“Did you ever forgive them?” Harry asked after a while not looking up from his fingers. When he didn’t get a response, he did look up. Draco had his eyes closed and seemed to be thinking. Harry noticed how Draco was keeping himself upright with his palms flat to his sides. Again, he considered putting his hand on Draco’s. It was just a friendly gesture, right? To show that everything’s okay. Maybe also to say thank you that Draco was making time to answer all these questions.
“Could I please just speak to Draco?” Harry asked sounding more impatient than intended.
Ron gaped in shock but Harry just gave him a challenging look. “Are you seriously asking that from me?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Did you advise Malfoy at the beginning of this year to focus on his academics so he would have a better chance with his career because of his reputation that is now absolute shit as we all know?”
“Can’t we take a break?” Harry asked yawning and stretched out demonstratively. Draco shut the book they had been going through and also leaned back unmotivated.
Harry rolled his eyes and propped his head up on his hands.
“You wanted to talk,” Draco reminded him making it sound like a demand. Harry nodded abashedly and both wizards turned their gazes ahead again.
“You can’t keep ignoring them forever,” Theo added getting his plate and cup back.
Harry nearly gaped at that. “Excuse me?” he asked shocked.
“I suppose Father thought it was some kind of honour and besides that, they were much too afraid of the consequences. In their own way they did everything to not let it happen.” Draco swallowed. “The Dark Lord does not ask for favours; it is not as if they had a choice.” That sounded plausible. One shouldn’t forget how deep and long Draco’s parents were caught in this whole deal.
Harry heard Draco sit up but he held back from turning towards him again. “Do you sometimes think of them?” Draco suddenly asked. Harry furrowed his brows and looked at Draco questioningly. “Those that you’ve lost in the war.” Draco’s intense look didn’t stray from Harry who was nervously biting his lip.
Harry shook his head.
But Ron was right and Hermione lost it as Harry told her about the month they would have to wait due to the ingredients. Although, she was still convinced that their professors were doing their best. So, she decided to scold Harry instead for the protection spell he used back then. Harry just listened and hoped for the day to be soon over.
“I...I do have more words of wisdom.” Harry broke the silence, screaming internally because he was holding hands with Draco Malfoy.
“For the start of the year, they are really pushing us, huh?” Harry rolled his eyes, “What is it about?”
“...What?”
Harry huffed a laugh, “cold, as in personality or…”
“You were ready to fight back,” whispered Draco, not moving his hand even though he had finished healing the green-eyed boy, “But you didn't, why?”
But Harry was still staring at him to what looked like his attempt of puppy eyes- how old was he again? ten?
───────────────────────────────────────
“People can change.”
“Can I...?”
“You are stupid.”
“I know, but it will hurt a lot more if you keep moving. Just listen to me for once in your bloody life.”
“You're warm,” Harry repeated, sighing, “I like it.”
“You want to make sure you have reasons to feel guilty?”
“It’s… surprising. And I'm sure is going to take Ron by surprise too when he finds out. But people can change, and if he makes you feel happy. I’m all about it.”
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione left her books on the ground to jump a little and hug her friend, scaring him a little bit on the process, “I’m sorry for making assumptions. And I’m really proud you’re chasing what you want!...but Ginny told us she has seen you with Malfoy a lot.”
Was he waiting for something? thought Harry, Maybe this the chance I have been expecting all this time.
“It's not a big deal. But for some reason it stayed in my mind after all these years.”
Well, the good thing was that he did faint once, so it wasn't that probable for him to do it again. And seeing how the wound was already recovering thanks to what seemed like Draco healing abilities, Harry's spirits lifted up, it looked so much better and it also didn't hurt half as much. It was a really well-done work.
“Harry, I think it’s time to speak to Professor Slughorn,” Hermione said sternly. As if there was nothing more pressing.
As they arrived in the entrance hall Harry turned to Draco a little nervously. “I think I better go take a shower.” Draco nodded slowly. “You should too,” Harry added. Draco nodded again. “Could we perhaps postpone the study session? I might go lie down.” Draco’s eyes wandered uncertainly to his feet but he looked back up then and mumbled a “’course.” Harry nodded relieved.
“Trust me, he’ll come.”
“Is too busy,” Ginny replied. Harry nodded slowly in understanding.
“I’ll tell you later,” Harry answered and procrastinated the decision for a later time.
“Harry I’m not blind. And maybe Hermione mentioned that what you feel might not just be friendly interest in Malfoy.”
“Your call,” Blaise said and the Slytherins turned away to keep walking. Harry didn’t even wait for them to be out of sight before grabbing Draco’s wrist and dragging him into the nearest empty classroom that he could find.
The blonde was pouring himself a cup of orange juice but noticed Harry’s gaze immediately. He furrowed his brows as Harry didn’t look away and kept giving him a friendly smile. Slowly an unsure smile made its’ way to his lips in response. Right after Draco put down the juice, he tapped his nose, holding eye-contact, and mouthed a “sorry”. Harry nearly laughed. Was Draco seriously apologizing to him for breaking his nose? Or, for almost doing it again in the dream? Harry’s memories of the pain must have travelled to Draco. Draco shrugged guiltily and turned back to his friends again.
“Hey!” Draco protested amused and brushed the grass off his robes.
Harry rolled his eyes grinning and stared at his sandwich and muffin thoughtfully. His appetite was gone. Draco on the other hand was already getting out the sandwich and biting hungrily into it. As he noticed Harry looking, he gestured questioningly.
Harry decided without further ado to ignore his friends forever which he forgot about at latest during potions class because Slughorn showed no mercy with the study material and he desperately needed the help.
“I think you’re mispronouncing ‘thank you’,” Harry shot back challengingly.
“As long as you’re not surrounded by it, yes,” Draco replied.
“He has gotten nicer,” Luna stated. Harry now followed her gaze and noticed that she was looking over at the Slytherin table. To be precise, at Draco Malfoy, who had yet to notice their looks.
The whole day Harry was dying of nervousness. What if Hermione was right? He had to talk to Draco and find out if the dreams were in fact Draco’s memories. But it seemed like fate had other plans as the day passed even slower than usually. Ron and Hermione tried to keep him distracted as well as possible but Harry couldn’t manage to concentrate the least bit which nearly cost him some house points. Then finally the quills were put down and the bags packed. Harry also shook off Neville quickly and made his way to the Potions classroom stopping by the kitchen to get two sandwiches made by the house-elves. With the sandwiches in his bag he hurried to detention.
Draco sighed again and rubbed his forehead. “I know it is a bit complicated but you know as well as me that-,”
Harry frowned. “I thought, you didn’t care?”
Your comments make my day so leave one if you enjoyed it? Or if you want to yell at someone? But don't worry! I'm planning on uploading the next chapter very soon. Almost halfway there!
“You’re going to regret skipping now shortly before the exams,” Draco added.
Ron stared at Harry for a while in concentration but then just shook his head and mumbled a “’s is too much, mate”.
So, Harry busied himself with the assignment. The hour passed disgustingly slow without Draco’s company but finally, he handed in his scroll and walked off to the Gryffindor tower. For a moment, he considered going by the Slytherins but decided to simply ask Draco later in his dream about his well-being. Harry managed to sneak into the dorms unnoticed, got ready for bed and closed his curtains. He wondered silently how much longer Ron would stay angry. Then he fell asleep.
After a much too short time, they both gave up and preferred to enjoy playing chess instead. Harry quickly realized that this was probably a one-time opportunity to talk to Ron seriously about him and Draco. As soon as they finished the game (Ron obviously won), Harry sat up a little and watched Ron carefully put away the chess figures.
Harry woke up gasping for breath and looked around. Ron was just getting out of bed and looked at Harry in surprise.
“We are starting with the belladonna essence, get ready, Potter.”
Harry took a step back shaking his head. “I know exactly what he did to you, just as I know what he himself did to me. I never asked you to move on or to forgive him but you better accept it if I do!”
“Good luck,” Neville said and squeezed Harry’s shoulder quickly before Harry headed towards the Slytherin common room.
“The bloke can hear you,” he grumbled sleepily. The surprised looks from his friends fell on him. Hermione threw Ron a challenging look and pushed a sandwich into his hand. Ron nearly rolled his eyes but then slowly approached Harry.
Harry blinked his eyes open and looked around confusedly until his eyes fell to where his pillow fell down to, only to realize that his pillow is not much of a pillow at all and more like a very pale, shocked looking Draco Malfoy.
Harry worried his lip with his teeth. If he was being honest, he wasn’t all that bothered. One month was absolutely manageable.
“Still, Weasley sex is not something I want to see.” With those words, Draco crossed his arms amused.
Harry tried not to forget to breathe and forced himself to smile half-heartedly. “Funny,” he commented and cursed his voice for the uncertain tone.
“Dying is an option,” Ron offered and earned a reproving look from Hermione.
Harry grimaced feeling tortured which earned him a laugh from Ron. Ron was most certainly right but Harry wasn’t too hot about that confrontation.
The class was going on for an eternity so it was no surprise that Harry wanted nothing more than dinner and a bed right now. But to avoid getting in trouble, he went shortly bevor dinner down to the Potions room.
Draco did not even try to hide his feelings and groaned in annoyance. “Tell them to take the bloody potion themselves. Now if you will excuse me please.” He sprung up and left obviously angry. Harry and his professors watched him go a bit surprised.
The atmosphere was jolly and filled with light chatter. The walk down to the lake was much appreciated. They’ve had enough of studying for now. Nobody even commented that Draco would join them later on in any negative way. Seamus even made a protest of jealousy because he wished he too had a personal tutor. Ron and Hermione acted like a true couple and walked hand in hand next to Harry while chatting to the rest of the group. They discussed the Quidditch results, gossiped about certain professors, a few bad puns were made and all in all the morning was certainly content.
“Were you planning on mentioning that to me at any point, Potter?” Draco growled while he desperately tried to control his anger. Harry scratched sheepishly the back of his head and shrugged.
“Yes, he stopped Pansy Parkinson from hexing me.”
“If I don’t make it back to the tower tonight, you’ll know,” Harry mumbled and sighed. He had no appetite left for the food in front of his nose.
"Sure. But you know... you're not that bad yourself. If one is into scrawny, stupid heroes." Draco winked.
“That was horrible! The beginning was alright ‘cause Mione was there but no human can write as quickly as her!” Ron complained. “What’s that?” Harry followed Ron’s gaze to the scrunched-up paper in his hand.
Another silence fell over them.
“But it makes sense now! It makes sense that Malfoy freaked out over a stupid potion because he doesn’t want to risk his Outstanding. And he doesn’t want to risk it because it gives him a chance in the wizarding world!” Harry shouted, disappointed in his friends’ reactions.
On top of that, they received their Potions tests back. Harry had just about managed to get an Acceptable and that definitely only thanks to Draco. Damn, he really needed to study more to catch up on what he’d missed. Harry decided to ask Draco for another tutoring session.
Harry shook his head. “Nothing. How’s Charms going?” Harry changed the topic quickly.
Harry couldn’t help but raise his eyebrow in question. “Don’t look at me like that, you don’t need to know everything about my life. If it was interesting you would find out sooner or later anyway.” Draco said tapping against his temple with his fingertip.
Harry quietly cleared his throat. “You should get some sleep again. I missed you last night.”
Right before dinner, he headed towards the dungeons and got, as planned, two sandwiches from the house elves in the kitchen. Nervously, he headed to the Potions classroom. Slughorn was already waiting for him, Draco hasn’t arrived yet, though. He got informed that a cure potion was being worked on but it would take a while still. Harry simply nodded and began his usual copying assignment.
“What are you talking about? Everything worked perfectly,” Harry said weakly.
“Up until now I’ve dreamed a mix of memories and a bunch of dragon shit. I doubt that it makes sense to anyone,” Harry thought out loud.
Harry frowned. “Why don’t you do that?”
“Tired?” Draco asked carefully.
“I’m fine without,” Harry replied. His voice sounded too loud in the quiet that had fallen over them. He glanced at Draco who looked back doubtfully.
“I am not apologizing for anything,” Harry replied unconvincingly.
Harry missed classes for the rest of the day and stayed in his bed where he kept asking himself what he could’ve done differently. Now he didn’t only have a ridiculous fight with his best friend but also lost the reason for that fight. Meanwhile Hermione came by once and brought him some food. She asked what had happened but Harry just send her away. He didn’t want to talk. He didn’t want to eat. He also didn’t want to sleep. He just wanted to lay there and wallow in self-pity and not think about why he was overreacting like this.
“Well, congratulations. For one month we’re fucked.”
“Everything alright?” Hermione asked the next morning. The Gryffindors had just finished breakfast and were making their way to potions class.
Harry took an extra-long time that evening getting ready for bed. He wasn’t really looking forward to facing Draco in his current state. Ron had a few reassuring words for him but Harry just felt burdened by all the emotions. For this night, he really wished he had a dreamless sleep potion. As Seamus started to notice Harry’s weird mood and instantly started questioning him, Harry took that as his cue to finally go to sleep.
Saturday arrived and with it also the snow Hermione had hoped for. Fat snowflakes had turned Hogwarts into a white wonderland overnight. The glee about this was already apparent at breakfast. Not long after, Harry’s friends made their way to Hogsmeade and with them a bunch of other students as well. Just the first and second-years and a few others stayed back. Among them Harry, who was heading towards the library, where Draco was already waiting for him.
Draco recovered quickly and smirked. "See you around, Potter." With that Draco left the still dumbfounded Harry behind.
"What the hell are you doing here?!" Draco and Harry yelled, making Draco groan.
Draco glared at him. "Of course would I be on top! Look at your scrawny little body, Potter. I am a pureblood and a Malfoy. There's no way, I'd let you top, Potter."
“He’s sleepin’. Maybe he really did catch something,” Ron replied defiantly.
“Don’t tell me you’re starting to like him,” Ron managed to say completely taken aback.
“How about you don’t arrive late to class next time so you don’t miss anything.”
“Now that you're not dying, could you tell me what on Merlin's beard happened here?”
“Harry, you’re a lot more than that. You’re amazing at Quidditch! you’re also very good at defensive spells. You’re creative, brave and a good leader.”
Draco tried to push again, but Harry was holding him strongly. If he wanted to, he could have used a spell to get free of his grab- but it was rather comfortable to lay there. For a recently injured person, it was surprising Harry wasn't complaining about how he was closely brushing his wound, “What about the wound?”
“I don't remember. Seven? maybe eight.”
“Malfoy?”
“Potter, stay here.”
“I remember that when I was living with my… The Dursleys, a lot of things happened, to be honest,” Harry started, trying to ignore Draco's stare, “clearly, they weren't the nicest people on earth. I remember this one time where I was cooking and my Aunt Petunia told me she would chop off my fingers if I messed up.”
“Potter, mind telling me what you are doing here?” Draco asked eyeing Harry.
“Then keep on writing.”
Harry nodded slowly while he tried his best to sort through his feelings and thoughts. He couldn’t have romantic feelings for Draco. That was just impossible. Although it would explain the desire to touch. And that fluttering feeling in his stomach when he was around him. And then there was the dream that made his feelings more obvious than anything. Harry groaned in frustration and rubbed his eyes under his glasses. He just wanted Ron to understand his perspective and now this happened instead.
“I don’t follow. Were you Draco or yourself now?” Ron asked again. Harry had just recounted his latest dream to Ron and Hermione. He left out his own dream in the story. It was bad enough that he still dreamt about Ginny but the thing with Ron was quite irrelevant for his best friends to know.
“Ron had just made a stupid joke!” Dean defended his mate.
“Don’t tell me you’re witnessing the entrance of the Slyther-bitches.” Harry looked up recognizing the familiar voice. Ginny Weasley sat down next to him grinning.
Only a few hours after breakfast, Ron, Seamus, Dean and Neville made their way to the entrance hall. They planned on sneaking a few sandwiches out of the kitchen. Hermione held Harry purposely back which is why they made their way out a few minutes later. Harry had already a feeling that the Gryffindor wanted to speak to him which is why he wasn’t surprised when she asked about how he was doing while they slowly walked through the corridors of Hogwarts.
“He looks as tired as you, Harry,” Hermione remarked but then turned her attention back to her breakfast. Ron nodded in agreement but got distracted by Seamus who had just joined them. Harry pushed his scrambled eggs around in his plate, then looked up again to Draco.
“I’m not sure how but maybe you did ingest some of that brew.”
Blaise took his leave a few halls before the Potions room and disappeared towards the Slytherin common room. Draco waited for Harry to catch up to him and they walked together silently until they reached the class room and Harry opened the door for them. The silence wasn’t awkward, just fitting considering they had nothing to discuss at the moment.
Ron leaned a bit in and put his hands together, fingertips touching. “And why are you telling me about this then?”
He was failing this test miserably. He definitely put studying on the backburner because of detention which he was regretting now. One after another they were handing in their tests, Hermione obviously as well, and the classroom started getting emptier. Harry was stuck at the last question and was certain he messed up the other questions anyway.
Before everyone could turn towards Draco, he already made his way to the front. “It’s alright, I’ll follow later.” Harry felt relief wash over him and his heart began to beat a little faster.
“Still getting all the ingredients,” replied Harry curtly. Draco nodded and made himself helpful by getting the rest of the ingredients ready. It was actually a quite easy potion to brew. The only difficulty was in adding and mixing in the ingredients with perfect timing.
“You don’t like the placement of your common room?” Harry asked teasingly.
Leave a comment if you like, it makes my day ^-^ <3
“Then study with me.” Harry observed how Draco’s expression went from surprised to confused to sceptical.
Hermione rolled her eyes and sat down on the edge of Harry’s bed. “Listen, Harry. That a friendship between the two of you would evolve, was to be expected. It just would have been nice if you had let us be part of it a little so that we could understand these… positive feelings you’re having towards him.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Malfoy!” said suddenly another voice. Draco looked over to the table next to them. Instantly, his eyes narrowed.
Harry frowned. “Why are you leaving then?”
Finally Harry got the hang of it and started to respond tangling their tongues. Harry got a bit braver and grabbed onto Malfoy's hair as he deepened the kiss. Harry moaned as Malfoy's tongue explored every inch of Harry's mouth.
“I just want to talk to him!” he said and tried to hide the pleading tone.
Harry rolled his eyes mock-annoyed. “Drama queen,” was the only thing he said.
Harry almost lost every bit of bravery in him as he watched Draco Malfoy walking towards him looking not quite pleased with the situation. Hermione tried encouraging Harry with a nod but Ron’s tense expression took that last bit of bravery instantly from the Gryffindor. Slowly Harry still followed Slughorn into the room next to the Potions room.
Ron looked a bit shocked at Harry. “You’re not being serious.”
(Both)
Draco glanced doubtfully at Harry, grabbed his bag and left the room with a “I am not feeling well.” Harry sighed and leaned back in his chair.
“I feel bad. Like really bad. And if I already feel like shit then you probably do as well,” Harry explained himself.
“What about last night?” he asked immediately. Harry threw Hermione a look of reproach while he scrambled for a plausible excuse.
Harry groaned annoyedly. “What does it matter to you anyway? Maybe I do all of these things. Why shouldn’t I?”
Draco tensed immediately. Harry was going to reprimand him for it. He will ask why he did not stay strong. Why he was not braver. Why he did not just leave before it was too late.
The following days passed within a blink of an eye. Harry and Draco used their newly found freedom in their dreams to play Quidditch against each other or to walk along the paths in Hogwarts talking. The tutoring hours were spent with a bit of studying, chit-chatting and sometimes Harry taught Draco things like how to play Noughts and Crosses. Draco grew quite competitive and beat Harry more often than he had expected.
“You’re here,” Harry stated the obvious.
Back in the Gryffindor tower, Seamus teased him a little about coming back late but the rest of them left him alone. Hermione simply seemed glad that she didn’t have to tutor Harry herself. And not much later they all went to bed.
Harry looked at her, then glanced at the Slytherin table and nearly jumped as he noticed Draco watching him. Before Harry could react, the blonde already looked away.
Harry nearly laughed. “It’s already 8PM. I thought now the fun would just start?”
About half an hour later the door slammed open with a breathless blonde Slytherin standing there and gasping out an apology. Harry made out something like “fell asleep” and “lost track of time”. Slughorn didn’t even bother reprimanding Draco, just gave him the assignment and disappeared off to the Great Hall. Draco had sat down at a table next to Harry’s and got out his quill. Harry couldn’t help but stare at him which Draco ignored skilfully. Nervously, Harry worried his lips. At least a “hello” wasn’t that weird, right? Maybe it was a bit too late. It has been five minutes since Draco joined him after all. Harry stared down at his parchment and wanted to just sigh out loud. Why did this have to be so complicated?
“We do hope that you bring our Golden Boy back home safe and sound,” Seamus answered playfully. Draco shook his head which lead to pieces of grass fluttering out of his hair.
He hurried along the halls. He would be late to Charms but with everything going on he had completely forgotten his assignment. He nearly ran into another student as he turned a corner. He was about to mumble a half-arsed apology as it hit him. In front of him stood no other than Draco bloody Malfoy. And he looked like he had literally you-know-who in front of him. Ron felt his anger return instantly. Malfoy seemed to notice and quickly took a step back. Ron nearly laughed. So, he the bloke wasn’t more than a scared ferret after all. What by Merlin’s beard did Harry see in him?
“Just don’t let Mum hear you talkin' like that,” commented Ron at his sister’s appearance. Ginny just rolled her eyes and turned back to Harry.
“Yes, probably. But exactly that is its’ problem. Too romantic. Too much frill. Too much kitsch,” Harry explained while he actively tried to not think about that café.
