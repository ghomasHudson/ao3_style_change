At this he rose back up and gestured towards Harry. Next, he took out his wand with a little flourish, placed it across the flat of his palm and held it out towards Bill, head slightly lowered.
“And I need you to support us in front of Dumbledore. With the same move, I made you my perfect allies and I took legal guardianship away from my parents. They’d have taken me out of school on the first day and…” his face was pained, “probably just brought me to him. Well. I’m sure Mother would have found a way, but I’m not letting her get into any
“Oh… right! Ron said something in a letter! I’m so sorry, I… with everything that’s been going on, I… Well. Congratulations!” He made as if to hug Bill, but then thought better of it, in light of the lack of clothing, and just offered his hand awkwardly. Bill laughed out loud and threw an arm across Harry’s shoulders.
“Bonds like this are made by magic and based on consent and on…” she blushed an unbecoming shade of red that clashed with her hair.
This woman was beautiful. She was petite but unbelievably curvy. The red dress accentuated her small waist and well-rounded hips. Even though she showed no cleavage, little was left to the imagination by the clinging fabric.
want to touch him, at all. Instead, he turned towards the house and began walking up the stairs onto the portico at the back entrance.
“Uh… thanks,” Harry stammered embarrassedly. “I’ll just go and… get my cup of tea from the kitchen,” he added, in order to escape the mortification for at least a little bit and use the extra minute to think about what to do now. Draco, however, sprung up instantly and waved him back down.
“We don’t really have a choice, do we?” Harry replied. “If you don’t want to spend the night on the portico, that is.”
Ron was quiet for a good minute, opening the broom cupboard and making a show of inspecting every single one. They were all a bit sad looking.
He took a more careful swallow of tea and leaned back in his armchair. What were they even doing? He could never talk to Draco sincerely. Somehow, one of them always ended up offended over something the other person said. Maybe it was their shared history of mutual resentment. Harry just couldn’t take anything Draco said without a grain of salt. But he’d promised himself to try, so try he would.
,” he said flatly as he got up, “but maybe you should wait with that until Granger gets here, because she’ll undoubtedly have you describe every detail you remember and have a thousand question for every detail you don’t.” He shoved past Ron and headed towards the staircase. “I’ll be in my room, if you need me.”
“However, it has to be said that it was a splendid idea of him to get professional help,” the mild voice interjected. “A thing like this hasn’t happened since the Hackenberg case, not that I know of at least.”
“No, stop!” Harry yelled and threw himself at Ron to cover his mouth with his hands. “I don’t want to hear this!”
Granted, Bill had been entertained at first, but the longer he thought about it, the more dangerous he judged the situation. There was no accounting at all for what this massive, over-night change in the game would do to the carefully imbalanced political mine field. As soon as it all became public knowledge, anyway.
“So you chose to…” Ron coughed and closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. “I thought you hated him. I thought we all hated him.” His hand paused in the action of straightening some bristles, buried between the twigs.
His mirth ebbed into quiet chuckles. Fleur clapped him over the head quite sharply. “Eet was really a very ‘onourable zing to do. You should not laugh at Draco so.” Then she turned to Draco and clasped her hands in front of her. “Eet is such a romantic story. I am glad you escaped those mean men and now you can be togezzer for ever!” She sighed happily.
Some barrier had broken down. Harry did not want to hold himself back, so he leaned forward and kissed Draco on the mouth. Draco made a surprised noise, but after a second, kissed him back with the weight of relief behind it. When he pulled back, he looked at Harry and Harry looked at him. The grey of his eyes was like a mirror and Harry saw himself in it.
“This,” she said with a slight sneer, “is the guest wing, Mr. Potter. We reopened this corridor over the summer holiday and installed an additional floo place. With the amount of guests we were entertaining, it was getting quite inconvenient for them to keep travelling through the headmaster’s office.”
“I am not setting foot in another muggle house if my life depends on it,” Draco said. Perking up, he added: “What about Nocturne Alley? I know an inn, there.”
Bill studied them with narrowed eyes, but eventually huffed a sigh and stepped forward. Lifting his wand again, he hesitatingly placed it atop Draco’s, barely touching, and said flatly: “The Weasley family welcomes Draco Ignatius Abraxas Malfoy of the line of Armand Malfoy and his Bonded.”
“Of course, I’m so sorry!” she snivelled and turned towards the door. “I’ll just… I’ll just wait downstairs.”
“Sorry, I am so sorry,” he said in between crying tears of delight, “but it’s just such an incredible circumstance. The only Malfoy heir, beholden to the Weasley family!”
“I- I- I’m so sorry!” she hiccoughed. “Stupid, stupid, stupid! I should have known they were planning something! I should have seen it coming!”
“This is a very special circumstance, Harry. You see, the bond can only form, when…” Mr. Weasley cleared his throat and looked at his wife pleadingly.
“I mean, look at vhat happens vhen children are left on their own. How did Dumbledore allow zis to happen? He has clearly not control over zis whole situation.”
Mr. Reichel pointedly did not look at his companion, instead leaning forward to take a sip of his tea.
“I –“ Draco began, but then the floo lit up with bright green flames and Molly Weasley came stepping out the grate. She landed nearly on top of Harry.
As soon as he laid eyes on her severe grey bun, her green hat and her sharp tartan robes, he was flooded with a sense of security and
She marched towards the bed. She looked like she was about to hex the living daylights out of him. However, she resorted to non-magical means, leaned over the bed and cuffed him over the head sharply.
“Okay, well, even if we were not together,” and he held up a finger, fearing Draco would interrupt again, “if I die, you die too, right?”
so strong it brought tears to his eyes. It was like a part of him had stayed behind at Hogwarts, as it always did, when he had boarded the train at the beginning of summer and was only now returned.
Unhurriedly he got up and padded through the hall, down the flights of stairs and into the kitchen. Yawning and scratching his head, he settled at the table.
“I can’t say for certain. I found references to other, more experimental works, but the London Wizarding Library didn’t have those. They are considered Dark.” She tapped her lips with an impatient finger. “However, an old and Dark family library like the Malfoy’s might have books about experiments in that field. They have to have some! Otherwise, how could they have known about the possibility of an Indissoluble Bond forming, in the first place? Oh! They might even know of a way to break the bond!”
“I… okay,” Harry mumbled. It didn’t look like Draco would move his head on his own, and if Harry had to decide between stopping and doing the work himself, he would get started right away. Tentatively he nudged himself back between Draco’s lips. Draco closed his eyes and somehow telegraphed being deeply unimpressed by Harry’s lack of oomph.
Draco looked into his eyes. Then he got up gradually and came towards him, one step at a time. When Harry didn’t do anything, Draco took his wrists and moved his hands down. Softly, he cupped Harry’s chin and pulled his face up. Checking his reaction, he slowly bent down towards him. Harry couldn’t move at all. There was no energy in him to resist this intense gentleness.
Draco sighed in a way that somehow expressed his ongoing and deep dissatisfaction with life in general and got up with a look at Harry that clearly said “I don’t know why I do this for you and I hope you die an early death of the most painful kind” and stalked over to where Mrs. Weasley was gutting the chicken using increasingly aggressive methods.
Harry turned towards the door, rolling his eyes. The whole house was dark. He hesitated, arm stretched out towards the handle.
Hermione turned around and slowly stumbled over. When she had folded herself onto the bed, Ron sat on the edge of his’ and leaned over, handing her the tissue box. “Alright?” he asked more tenderly than Harry had thought him capable and stroked her hair back from her face, taming the wilderness back into shape.
“That… was very insightful, Ron! You may actually be right,” Hermione said and turned around to blink at him.
Harry looked away, willing his face to remain cool. He just hadn’t seen Draco smile that often. It had always been cruel sneers or condescending cackles.
“I know this is not how you planned to spend your last year at Hogwarts, and for all it is worth, I am sorry.”
Harry blushed thinking about their encounter in the kitchen that night. The hairs on his arms prickled as he remembered Draco’s fingers in his hair, his breath on his neck.
His mother turned around and with unseeing eyes she grabbed at him and drew him into her lap. She pressed him close and hummed, rocking him back and forth. He tried to get away and struggled in her embrace, but she was cold as marble and as hard. Her limbs had turned into a cage, smothering him. He could not breathe. In a last attempt, he threw himself off her and when he hit the ground hard, she was gone. He was alone in the darkness.
Draco gave him one of those looks that said 'I knew you were stupid, Potter, but I had no idea as to your particular kind of idiocy'.
Harry could just make out his blush in the light of the Lumos. He wanted to touch him again, to feel the warmth of his skin underneath his fingertips, but he was sure Draco wouldn’t let him. And really, Draco was an arse, a pure-blood supremacist bigot. Harry just needed to remember that. He didn’t
“See you guys later, I guess. You’ll be here?” Harry interjected, before they got into serious bickering.
“-but this is the best entertainment you provided us with since fighting that dragon for its golden egg!” Fred exclaimed earnestly.
He gave Harry a wink and a little wave. Rounding the first corner on the stairs, he flicked his wand and the candles went out, except for the one closest to Draco. The fire was reduced to low crackling embers. Draco’s head was propped up on his folded hands and he looked at Harry though half lidded eyes.
“I shall speak to Severus. He is the only one in this entire school with a sensible head on his shoulders!”
Ron was now staring at Harry. “But… but Hermione said the unfettering brew will be ready in September! We’ll have the git off our hands in three weeks,” he stated hotly, desperately clinging to reality as he knew it.
“Okay,” Harry said again. “But if it’s too much, you pat my leg, okay?” he asked. When Malfoy didn’t react, he pulled out and yanked Draco’s head back, making him look up. Draco let out a deep groan. “OK?” Harry asked forcefully.
“You really sure it’ll be enough?” Ron asked. He was stretched out on his bed reading the Qidditch Times.
“Molly,” he said softly. Mrs. Weasley stilled. “Please let it go. I know very well how hard it must be for your family to accept my presence in this house. I would feel terribly uncomfortable knowing Ron missed dinner on my behalf.”
“Draco here has just been telling us about your plans,” Mr. Weasley said, as Harry sat down and took his cup with a mumbled thanks.
Before Hermione got over her indignation, Fleur sauntered back around her and motioned for Ron and Harry to sit. Ron’s face was twisted in indecision. He glanced from Hermione to Fleur to the pile of food on the table. Then he swallowed and faced Hermione with an apologetic smile.
Hermione arrives on the scene and brings along her sharp mind, critical thinking and eagerness for action.
“No, listen to me. Draco is a perfectly placed piece on the board. He is untouchable because of his connection with you but in no way can he be held responsible because he just saved your life, right? That could even be construed as making up for the previous years of antagonising you. Yet in no way is he beholden to our side. His morals are shady at best, his motivations are unknown and his loyalties certainly don’t lie with us. That makes him the ultimate spy!”
“Well, that’s good, isn’t it?” Ron said. “Whatever it was, it had something to do with your scar. It must have something to do with the night You-Know-Who…”
Then the thought of having a husband caught up with him and it was so strange, he flinched back mentally.
The walls were purple, a darker shade than the hall. The curtains were a bright yellow and the ceiling was painted sky blue with clouds moving about lazily. Cabinets filled nearly every available wall space, crammed to bursting with books, games, tableware, stuffed animals, crystals, vases in all shapes and sizes, little wooden figurines and other miscellanea.
He’d passed the second door and gotten stuck in front of a particularly enticing painting of an elegant woman in a loose kimono smoking a cigarette with one of those long holders he’d once seen in a movie. Hermione’s voice spilled through the door to his right, which was slightly ajar, so he made his way across. Drawing near, he was about to open it when he heard his name spoken inside by a hard, angry voice.
“Nah, Ron’ll understand,” he said quickly, more to himself than to Draco, and opened the door. He stepped inside before Draco changed his mind and decided to drag him bodily back into the garden. Then he shook his head to dispel images of Draco bodily dragging him, anywhere.
Purple seemed to be a recurring colour. Even the floor was carpeted in a rich mauve with moons and stars moving about it lazily. But… where were they?
“But for now, let’s get lunch on the way,” Mrs. Weasley said cheerily and began cluttering about in the kitchen.
The whole thing had been so much like Ginny, Harry really should have expected a reaction exactly like this. What he could not have foreseen was his own forceful response to Draco being threatened in this – all things considered – rather harmless way. After all, Ginny was only a 15-year-old girl and Harry had experienced multiple attacks by grown up Death Eaters and, not to mention, faced an angry Mrs. Weasley more than once. The latter was a lot higher on the scariness scale, as far as he was concerned. Still, the panic he had felt upon Ginny’s hastily drawn wand and ear-piercingly screeched insults had been sharper than any he had felt before, even at the graveyard. He knew where she got her fierceness from, anyway.
It felt a bit weird to be in a place of taking along messages and letters for Draco, but he supposed he was the best person for it.
Ron turned over his side and rolled off the bed, picking the curled magazine up off the floor in one fluid motion. “I don’t know. Pig knows the way pretty well, so it only takes him about three hours.” He straightened the magazine’s pages out with broad sweeps of his hands and tossed it onto his desk. “If she decides to go right away, she’ll probably take the Under-the-ground-train to the Leaky and floo from there, but it’s pretty late, so maybe she’ll go first thing tomorrow, in which case she’ll be here at about 7ish maybe? It’s hard to tell. You know how she gets when there are things in this world that she doesn’t know about. She might turn up at 1 o’clock tonight.”
It was his father’s lessons he had heeded since he was a small boy, eager to please him, but it was his mother’s he remembered when he sat on that train that carried him into an uncertain future.
The thought emerged from some repressed corner of his brain sluggishly and Harry tried to actively resist it, because it couldn’t be, it
This went deeper. It was as if Draco’s tenderness dragged it out of him forcefully wherever they were touching. The hand on his back tightened and soothing fingers carded through his curls. With a grunt, Harry pulled Draco towards him in one abrupt motion and buried his face in his shoulder. They were both shaking with the force of his sobs.
"Yor hair..." Harry said and sat back down, too, amused. Draco actually blushed, after everything they had just done, and furiosly tried to smooth it back down.
fucking Draco’s mouth, holding him in place whilst plunging in and out with abandon. His grunts were getting louder, too, and Draco had opened his own trousers at some point and had one hand buried deep inside, doing something Harry couldn’t see from this angle, and with the other, he’d taken himself in hand, stroking slowly but powerfully. His whole body was shaking and the noises he was making! Harry had never seen him come so undone. There was no sign of the haughty, collected pure-blood left.
“I… I understand that, but why does that mean we can’t go back into the dormitories? The bond was an accident!” he said angrily. “It’s not like we want to actually be together!”
Bill relaxed and threw his arms over the back rest of his chair, spreading his legs. This was a good start. He hadn’t expected Draco to jump on the wagon this easily. Lucius would have been a lot more stubborn about it. No, he probably wouldn’t have accepted help at all, obstinate, prideful man, least of all from a Weasley.
Harry cleared his throat. Both Ron and Hermione snatched their hands back abruptly. Hermione giggled nervously. “Sorry, it’s just fascinating, isn’t it? Where has it gone?”
Harry imagined Draco’s face had he suggested they travel by bus. He could picture it too clearly. ‘As if a pure-blood like me would set foot in a tiny stinking vehicle like that…’ or something similar. The thought made him smile.
“Well, nobody said anything about messing around with the bond, Harry. At least not without being a hundred percent sure you wont be hurt in the process” She narrowed her eyes at him and hummed. “Are you alright? Is there something else you haven’t told me yet?” She looked at Ron, too.
“He spoke about the accident, the healing, the Death Eaters and your journey here, by train! Honestly, Harry! You could just have called the Knight Bus!”
“Hermione…” Harry said, spluttering past Hemione’s locks. He didn’t know where to put his hands, so he just patted her back awkwardly. How on earth had Draco managed to deal with this so effortlessly yesterday?
Blinded by the sudden light, his eyes squeezed shut of their own accord. Almost instantly, the pressure on his jugular lessened.
He started upright. The same powerful urge to protect Draco had roared to life and caused so much damage yesterday. He had to remain calm.
“Hart, let the man take a seat and have a cup of tea before you start interrogating him, yes?” Mr. Al-Keydari said with a twitch of lips and guided a protesting Mr. Reichel back to the couch.
“Actually,” he said, holding onto the doorknob and studying Harry with a critical eye, assessing his adequacy to be seen in public, “maybe you should go to the bathroom to freshen up a smidgeon.”
“As I was just explaining to Miss Granger and Mr. Weasley, Professor Dumbledore is currently unavailable. I’m sorry.”
Harry stopped short. He hadn’t even though about it. She didn’t even know they were here! Harry slapped his face hard and shook his head, getting up.
However, he was actually sitting in the warm, happy, cluttered kitchen of the burrow. Home to a family Draco had insulted time and again. A family, whose only daughter had nearly been killed by his father. Quietly eating breakfast next to a boy he had insulted, threatened, taunted and even kicked in the face when he was unable to defend himself. How in Merlin’s name could he be so …placid? How could he talk to Bill and Fleur as if he were their friend? How could he sit here with Harry as if they really were… bonded.
Harry eyed Draco from beneath his fringe. This careful civility was so unlike him. His face was carefully neutral and it was only now, seeing it devoid of any emotion but polite attention, that Harry realised how open Draco’s demeanour had become around him over the last few weeks. He missed that other Draco with a sudden and fierce, hot jolt.
Harry nearly fell off Mr. Weasley’s armchair as realisation hit him like the Hogwarts Express. Draco had left his home. He’d
“What I meant was, you forget you are a Bonded man. You are legally considered an adult because the Bond took hold. Or did you not know about that?”
“…Ah, Jafari, wasn’t it? Yes, you are right, as you so often are," the mild one said in a teasing tone. Harry could hear the man’s smile through his words. He sounded fondly exasperated.
“No, you forget ze Palestinian Apotheker who spilled a form of the binding potion on his camel,” the other man corrected.
“So, his mum asked us to repair a broken wall on the edge of the estate. We flew over,” he held up the Numbus 2001, “and put the stones back on the wall. When we were finished and turned to go, one of the boulders tumbled loose and hit me in the chest.” Harry rubbed his breastbone unconsciously. “I’d healed Draco’s back before-“ at this Ron halted on the doorstep, gave him a dark look and opened his mouth, but Harry raised his voice, “-and so we knew it was possible. He came over and put his hands on my chest. The bone was coming out and it was… not looking good. Then he somehow… pulled, or pushed, and the wound closed up slowly. There was something else there, too, that he pulled out, somehow. This horrible green goo, it’s hard to explain. Anyway, my scar is gone,” he added and lifted his fringe.
“I must be very against the idea of you two sharing quarters in Hogwarts, of course. But I understand very well it is not feasible for you to return to your dormitories. Maybe a set of rooms in the guest corridor? Something with separate bedrooms perhaps. Yes, that should do it. I will speak to Albus about it. He will see reason, I’m sure.” Mrs. Weasley went on.
“You know, I’m thankful he saved your life. But from what you said, it was a spur of the moment decision he made under pressure and I’m sure he only thought of the consequences afterwards. He wasn’t willing to let you die when he could prevent it and that shows he’s a human being but it doesn’t mean he has changed.”
Harry stood there thunderstruck. He opened his mouth to… what? Deny being bonded? The Weasleys would find out soon enough. A nervous laugh escaped him. At the sound, Bill, who had been staring at Draco’s wand incredulously, looked over at him.
Draco smirked and Harry wondered how in Merlin’s name he had never realised before how attractive Draco was when he smiled.
Draco’s lips, when they met his, felt different than they had before when they’d kissed. There was no movement, just a lingering. It was like a consolation and a promise. Harry felt tears in the corners of his eyes. What was happening?
“However, it would not be prudent to allow Mr. Malfoy to enter the Slytherin Common Room, for his own protection. For the sake of fairness, this prohibition will be extended to both of you.”
“If only- If only I had warned you more urgently…” She hid her face in Harry’s shoulder and broke down into unintelligible muttering.
Draco moved back a little and then went down on his knees and hugged him. One of his hands came to rest on Harry’s hair. The other arm went around his back. Harry’s eyes spilled over.
“Of course I can apparate. I was taught by my Father when I was twelve. I can’t normally use it, because of the trace, but these are my Mother’s Providing Pearls. Now shut up and concentrate.”
“Wait just a second, would you. I’ll be right back. Don’t go in without me! I think I just saw a particularly lovely bloom over there,” Draco muttered.
“Wicked,” Ron breathed and whistled a low note as he slowly turned full circle, taking it all in once more.
“Well, either your sense of direction needs serious improving, or your good friends, the Weasleys, have warded you out of their property.”
“Yes, please,” Ron said, watching Harry pour. “I feel like we will tell them all our secrets if we stay here for another minute.”
“Harry, I’m so sorry we left, but the gentleman was not to be swayed,” she whispered loudly, throwing a look over her shoulder at the gentleman in question. If Harry hadn’t been standing in Scotland’s only wizarding school, he would have thought the man a muggle. He was wearing a black suit, a slim, dark grey vest and tie and shiny leather shoes. The way he sat on the sofa he looked about as comfortable in this hodgepodge of a room as a swan might in a chicken pen.
“This is our address, Harry,” Bill said, handing him a piece of paper. “We are not taking any chances with this war.” Harry took it gingerly. The writing vanished as soon as he’d read it.
“Oh, I am a jack-of-all-trades. I dabble a bit at potions, but I am more interested in chemistry. The two intertwine more often than not. However, I also have a license for alimentary osteopathy and I read everything about the biochemical cycle and the nervous system I can get my hands on,” he replied.
“Why don’t you start by telling me what the bloody hell you were thinking when you flung your inheritance at my parent’s feet,” Bill said a bit unkindly.
“A long and happy life, I mean. With… me.” If Draco would not genuinely appreciate the immense effort he put into this, he would strangle him.
Draco’s eyes glittered angrily as Harry was still trying to comprehend what Malfoy was asking of him. Wouldn’t that hurt?
Collected. Poised, really. Every motion just so. No thoughts betrayed by his countenance. Polite yet dispassionate mien. Bill had always believed the Malfoys to be a cunning, opportunistic and careful sort of breed and he could almost believe it, watching Draco. If he had not seen the way he acted around Harry, that is. Draco was trying very hard indeed to play at politics like his father did, but he wasn’t in the least experienced enough to pull this off with his heart as involved as much it was and so many unknown factors. Lucius would rather have castrated himself
“Mrs. Weasley, Mr. Weasley, we have never been formally introduced. My name is Draco Ignatius Abraxus Malfoy, thirty-seventh of the line of Armand Malfoy. I have been welcomed into this house under Sanctuary together with my Bonded,” he straightened and gestured towards Harry” by your son William Arthur Weasley.” He took a deep breath, then went down on one knee and took out his wand. Mrs. Weasley gasped.
Mr. Al-Keydari looked around the corridor once before he turned to open the door. Even this simple movement communicated a kind of concentrated power Harry could only envy. When the man took a step, Harry saw the tip of something long and slim sticking out from beneath the hem of his robes. Was that a sword? Why would anybody need a sword at Hogwarts? Why would
“Well… I don’t really know myself. When my chest was smashed open (“Oh Harry!”), Draco put his hands on the wound and pulled the- the pain and the hurt into himself and that’s how the wound closed.” He shuddered. It had been a rather gruesome image. “But when the wound had closed all the way, it felt like he wasn’t done. I know he felt the same. So he kept on pulling and pulling and this green goo-  came out.” He looked down at his hands. He remembered how the stuff had clung to Draco’s. Goosebumps spread along his arms and back in spite of the warm room. “It felt really horrible,” he whispered. “Like I would never be happy again.”
When he woke up, the sun was just beginning to set. Lifting his arms, he sighed and his back popped with a particular satisfying stretch. He hadn’t rested that well in ages!
A cup nudged his hand. He grabbed it, took a passive-aggressive sip, and promptly burned his tongue. Draco snorted.
wizard need a sword when he had a much more dangerous weapon at hand? This man's story had to be most unusual.
Mr. Weasley came in from the shed and Harry helped Mrs. Weasley with the rest of dinner preparations. He listened bemusedly to Draco navigating his way through a conversation about radios and toasters with an enthusiastic Mr. Weasley all throughout dinner. Occasionally, Draco would glance in Harry’s direction with that same put-upon look from before, but to Harry’s ongoing astonishment and Mrs. Weasley’s obvious amusement, managed to hold his own.
“Well. Apparently, Fleur and Draco have fond memories of the same holiday places in France,” Bill said. “From what I could gather they were talking about Lombardy and Brittany, among others. But I think now they’ve gone on to skin care products,” he added laughingly.
Apparently, it was Harry’s job to stop ignoring the dragon in the room. “So… we arrived at the Dursley’s…” he started after a while and told Ron the whole story from the beginning, putting in things he had left out in his letters, like how Draco had cowed the Dursley’s into submission and how they’d been to Diagon together. They laughed ten solid minutes as Harry recounted the pixies incident, but Ron grew very still when Harry talked about how Draco had been punished by his father. Ron’s mood was pensive as Harry described the healing and stayed that way until Fleur called them both inside for a late lunch.
“You are right, I am no potions master. Fortunately, I have an assistant who is more versed in that area than I am,” he said, gesturing towards Mr. Al-Keydari.
“Grab it!” he growled and only when Harry had curled is fingers into Draco’s soft hair did Draco let him go to clutch at his shorts again, opening his lips. This time Harry couldn’t close his eyes. He was mesmerised by Draco’s lips being stretched around him; mouth filled. The way his throat worked as it adjusted to this unfamiliar intrusion. The way he was starting to sweat slightly at the temples. The way his eyelashes fluttered.
“And he has not yet told you about the foolish thing he did half an hour ago, as soon as Arthur and I set foot in the house.”
“Oh, no, ‘ee ‘az eaten a long time ago,” Fleur laughed. “‘ee eez at ze cottage, viziteeng wiz Bill.”
Silence stretched. Draco was buttering his croissant and sipping his tea as if he were sitting at the high table in the grand breakfast room of Malfoy Manor, next to his family, surrounded by decadent splendour. Even his tyniest movement was graceful and precise. Harry nearly expected him to say “Mother, would you please pass the salt,” or something. (But of course, in normal wizarding families, the salt comes to the wizard, not the other way round.)
The man lowered his head over their intertwined hands for a short second, curls tumbling into his face, before releasing him. He gave Harry a little wink as he straightened, which should have been a lot more off-putting. Charm seemed to ooze from his every pore and Harry tried his best to dislike him, but couldn't quite manage. For all his apparent aggreeableness, the man's russet hands were kept close to his gut in what seemed to be an uncontious defensive position. A broad belt secured the azure gown he was wearing underneath his robes, which had an unfamiliar cut. They fit snugly around the chest and were buttoned from chin to waist, but flaring wide open beneath, revealed the belt and gown. With every movement, gold thread shimmered where it lined the deep blue fabric in exotic patterns.
Bewildered, Harry looked back to the table, where Fleur was just reaching out to stroke a strand of Draco’s hair between thumb and forefinger. The monster that had lain dormant inside him for weeks woke up and hissed. ‘Don’t touch him,’ he wanted to spit. Abruptly, Draco lifted his gaze and stared at him. Then he smiled sweetly and said something to Fleur in French. She let go of his hair, pivoted on the spot, and saw them standing by the stairs.
“Don’t worry, I will not take ‘im away from you. ‘e does not ‘ave eyes but for you,” she half-whispered in his ear.
was the obvious answer. To help the Order along in any way he could and weaken the opposite side. But he couldn’t tell Draco that. And he suspected there was more to it, but he hadn’t bothered to consider it yet.
Harry's thoughts cleared. Right! She had consulted on their 'case'. She knew about their fettering. But she obviously didn't know about their Bonding.
“I don’t think breaking the Bond is possible,” he said hotly. “At least not without a lot of collateral damage… We don’t know how deep the bond is. There might be parts connected that I can’t even see or feel. I’d rather not risk it. It’s not like I wouldn’t want the bond gone, of course, but I’ve… kind of… gotten used to having him around… a bit?”
The familiarity of the transfiguration office was comforting. Red dominated the room no matter where you looked.
“This is outrageous!” she snarled. “I have spent my invaluable time trying to educate so-called Masters in this field, preventing the most heinous mistakes and debating with morons, only to have some
Ron stood by the stairs, looking as shocked as Harry felt, face changing slowly from disbelief to outrage.
. A warm presence to his right. This was getting easier every time. He'd barely needed to concentrate.
The staccato of Maria’s heeled foot hitting the floor beat almost the same rhythm as Harry’s heart. How was he going to get out of this without having his head bitten off by this woman?
his only son than become beholden to a blood traitor family, even if he might have been able to work the bonding itself to his advantage a few years ago.
“But really, their reputation has been ruined since Josephine Weasley upended a decanter onto Arribarth Black’s head at a dinner party 1786. He wouldn’t shut up about the depravity of a certain muggle born wizard she was befriended with. That was when it all started to go pear shaped, of course. I don’t think a single respectable investor took their money after that. Her grandfather was livid, and then she went and had thirteen children, you know how it is, so today the Weasley fortune has been reduced to such an extent, they can’t even afford to buy their first years new robes for Hogwarts.”
“Conjure…? A Shirt!” Draco spluttered. “Do you know what it takes to get an Armenian Hornsnail Silk Shirt like this?”
“What point is there in making a nuisance of myself? My alternatives are few. I can’t go back to the Dark Lord. He would kill me as an example for what happens to traitors. And I like my life here. I like the possibilities that being the Malfoy heir offers.”
“I gave it to Draco, too,” he added. At Harry’s astonished look, Bill took him aside and said softly: “At the risk of sounding patronising… I’d advise you, Harry, to be patient with him and try to understand his position. The world Draco grew up in is very different to your own. It might be difficult for you to grasp this, but Draco is committed to you now. I know how purebloods think, Harry. He will always act in your best interest. Granted, his definition might differ from yours in this, as well as his methods, but fundamentally, you can trust him. Don’t be too hard on him. And now, fare well and don’t do anything I wouldn’t do!”
Suddenly Draco grabbed his hips, pulled him away from the window sharply, shuffled around on the floor and leaned his head back against the wall, Harry’s fingers still buried in his hair.
As it happened, no-one had told him that he would be sitting at his kitchen table at 9 o’clock on a Sunday morning calmly drinking tea with Lucious Malfoy’s spawn, so unfortunately no cornering had taken place and he felt woefully unprepared to deal with this situation.
Trying to get his bearing, he breathed deeply a few times, brushed a hand through his hair and chugged down a glass of cold water. When he felt more put together, he went up the stairs.
“Yes, quite.” Mrs. Weasley said. “Draco, you can stay in the twin’s room and Harry will bunk in with Ronald. There will be no sharing a bed in this house until you both become of age!” She lifted an admonishing finger.
With arms crossed and indignant expression firmly fixed on his face, Draco was the most tempting vision Harry had ever seen. He found himself pulled into his orbit and for the first time truly uncaring to resist the pull, he simply stood and joined him at the window. Draco followed his process and looked at him now with a quizzical air and a quirk of lips. His eyes were a shining silver where the sun touched the irises. There were tiny crinkles in the skin next to them and his gaze was… fond? He was hyper aware of every textured detail of Draco’s face. As soon as Harry reached him, however, he couldn’t remember what he’d wanted to do once he was there.
A dagger’s only purpose was to be used, and indeed it was useless without a wielder. A lump of clay had no shape of its own and a willow grew where it was planted. Yet a blade could bite its owner, clay hardened when it went through fire and a willow… A willow, in the wizarding world, might leap and move on its own.
“I did at first,” Ron answered past a mouthful of potato, “but it’s just not a lot of fun, on your own, you know.”
“Not… not go back to the dormitories? Why would that…? …but we are still students!” Harry protested feebly.
He closed his eyes and slowly let his lungs fill with night air. Breathing out, he deliberately relaxed his shoulders. The stress of the day left his body bit by bit. They were safe here, for now.
Before he could decide to do either, Draco put his hands on the counter either side of Harry and inclined his head towards him. Every sense of Harry’s was on high alert. His skin tingled from head to toe, and Draco hadn’t even touched him yet.
Draco opened his mouth and closed it a second later. Whatever he’d been going to say, he had evidently thought better of it. Eventually, he shrugged. “It can’t be worse than your uncle’s miniature hovel, although I am not keen on being trampled by a horde of Weasleys.”
Harry stumbled backwards and lifted his hands placatingly for the second time in under half an hour. The man straightened, pocketing his wand. The menacing aura around him disappeared so suddenly, Harry must have imagined it. The man seemed as unassuming as his colourful clothing suggested. He smiled ruefully at Harry and cleared his throat.
They only played for half an hour. Sweat was dripping from Harry’s every pore and he was constantly having to remind himself not to go full out. Ron didn’t stand a chance, anyway. It seemed he hadn’t played much over the last weeks and Harry had practiced with Draco nearly every day. He didn’t mention this, but by the looks Ron gave him, it seemed he at least suspected something along those lines.
“Is Draco still asleep?” Harry asked, half to change the subject and half because he had just thought about whether they shouldn't take him along, too.
“If I started with the explaining I wouldn’t know where to stop, so I’ll just send it like this,” Harry replied, a little hassled at this point. His hands kept slipping off the tiny string he’d been trying to use in order to fasten the letter to Pig’s excitedly quivering little leg. As soon as he managed to tighten the knot sufficiently, Pig took off in a flurry of feathers and swept off the balcony.
The meal was a quiet affair. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were not yet back and Draco had elected to take his food in his room. Bill and Fleur’s half-whispered sweet talk made Harry and Ron cringe and hurry to empty their plates. Luckily, the two love birds bade them farewell after lunch, having decided to leave for their new home earlier.
Harry gawked. He wanted to look away from the Professors face, but he felt frozen, like a deer watching the headlights of an uncoming truck race towards it. His ears grew hot and his face was burning too. His own heartbeat seemed impossibly loud to him. He couldn’t utter a single word, even if he had known what to say.
“Where are they?” Harry asked, draining the dregs of his tea and carrying the cup towards the sink in the corner. He took Draco’s cup too.
Draco just huffed, as if trying to explain the workings of pure-blood culture to someone who neither cared nor had an inkling of how much of a sacrifice that would be, wasn’t wort the bother at all.
“It’s amusing to see you suffer. Your pain causes amusement,” Harry mimicked with a straight face and threw the magazine at Ron’s head. Ron dodged it neatly.
He winked and stepped over toward Fleur, who was already standing at the grate. Harry blushed. He hadn’t planned on doing anything, anyway.
“Obviously you don’t, that was a rhetorical question!” Draco hissed. “You couldn’t afford a handkerchief made of this material, let alone a whole set of robes.”
Bill takes things in hand (not what you think, get your mind out of the gutter!) and Harry has two interesting conversations.
Draco’s whole face slipped and he drew himself up in his seat. “What are you…! Are you implying- I… I wasn’t thinking about…! You are a married man yourself!” he spluttered.
“Well. There is no arguing with her when she get’s something in that pretty head of hers.” Bill sighed and got up. “Actually, she’s a lot like mum in that way. But don’t tell her I said that!” He took one of the glasses of jam, waved at them and followed Fleur out the door.
. Which was somehow even more embarrassing than having the most sensual experience of his life right by Mr. Weasleys work desk.
Ron chucked a fresh pair of boxers, shorts and a shirt at him and vanished into the bathroom quickly, so the cushion Harry hurled at him in retaliation hit the door with a dull thump, to the sound of Ron’s heartfelt sniggering. He fell back onto the mattress, glad they seemed to be alright.
He got up numbly, following Mr. Weasley and Draco up the stairs. Mrs. Weasley, whose face was a bit pinched, was hot on their heels.
Draco’s voice was barely audible. There was something heavy in it, and vulnerable. It made Harry look up. Draco sat in the ridiculous chair that made him seem very much out of place. Draco belonged in fancy leather armchairs or red velvet seats. He should not be here. This was wrong. He did not belong in this house.
“Do you know what Professor McGonagall wants to talk to you about?” Hermione asked Harry with a tilt of her head.
“Ah, she’ll be fine,” Ron said, waving a hand. “She’s had worse on the pitch. Don’t worry about it, Harry.” He looked about for a chair to sit down in but found them all still in various states of disrepair. “But why did you defend the git in the firs… oh, right. You’d have gotten that Bat Boogey Hex too.” He clapped Harry on the shoulder. “Knew you were scared of her. But
His shoulders straightened and he opened his mouth, but nothing more came out. His eyes restlessly searched the room before resting again on Bill. When Bill just cocked his head at him, Draco held his breath for a moment and then exhaled slowly. His shoulders moved forward an inch. Bill would have missed it, had he not paid such close attention.
“Muggles are such odd creatures,” he announced, sitting down with enough reading material to cover the next five hours.
Draco put down his croissant, picked up his cup and sat back in his chair. His manner was suddenly all business.
He stood there staring at the space she had left for a solid five minutes, trying to wrap his head around what had just happened. It was like a tornado had blown through and he was surprised to find all his limbs still attached.
“Well, you see. Married persons have the right to room together, and since we are… more than married, so to speak, we would be allowed even though we are still students. Now, nothing would hinder you from going back to your dorm, but I am a filthy traitor and it might not be the best idea to sleep with three blood purists in the room. If I am removed to other quarters, I would still be… vulnerable, shall we say, on my own, so us two rooming together is really the most sensible option,” he explained. “And also, it would be frowned upon by most traditional wizards and I don’t plan to antagonise even more of them. I do still want to go into politics after this is all over,” he added haughtily.
“And the whole thing was planned meticulously!” Hermione continued. “I’m sure Draco would like to make you think it was an accident, but the timing of your injury could not have been a coincidence. Mrs. Malfoy must have arranged that somehow. For the Death Eaters to appear right that moment…. Harry! Don’t you see?” Her voice was getting desperate and her eyes were pleading with him to understand.
How… How did he know about the case being closed? Had Hermione and Ron explained everything, then? Harry glared at Hermione, but she was busy staring at Mr. Al-Keydari with starry eyes, so he glared at Ron, instead.
Ron’s face froze as his gaze fell past Harry and he quickly turned back to his potatoes. Frowning, Harry twisted around and saw Draco reclining in the weirdly patterned armchair in the corner, book open in his lap, watching him. A smile was pulling at the corners of his mouth and Harry was surprised at the distinct urge to kiss it. The smile became a full-blown grin and before Harry had even thought about it, he was getting up and striding over towards where Draco sat.
He trailed his hands over the well-beloved wood. Who had brought them back from the Manor? Mrs. Malfoy?
“His father nearly killed my sister!” He was shouting now. “He would have killed you in the ministry! His aunt killed Sirius and you just… you…. How can you just trust him?!”
“And would you happen to have learned about a way to withdraw money from a family vault without a family member having to go there in person?” Draco asked in lowered tones.
He rushed along the corridor and into the Arrival Chamber, grabbed a handful of floo powder before he could change his mind and threw it into the hearth.
Harry looked around. The walls were decorated with purple curtains, huge oriental looking carpets and countless portraits that he’d never seen before. Some depicted green hills and sheep, others were full of flowers overgrowing stone walls and stone furniture. People were sitting at groaning tables burdened with foods of all colours, sizes and tastes, talking and cheering and drinking from mead tankards. One red cheeked man tipped his hat to Harry and lifted his mug in greeting. They generally exhibited scenes of peace and quiet or merriment and cheer.
“So, how come you were invited to help with this case? You are not a potions master, as far as I can tell,” she asked him with a small, triumphant smile.
“They are very nearly grown men, my pearl. There is no need to supervise them and I dare say it would be rather invasive. Now, off we go.” Arthur replied gently as their steps faded.
Mr. Weasley crossed the room to lean in towards Draco. “Molly and I will talk about all this in the evening, but rest assured: you are welcome to stay here as long as you need to.”
To Harry’s shock, her dress was open at the back, nearly all the way to her bum. He did his best not to notice the expanse of smooth skin and the dress hugging each curve like trying to mould onto her body. If he hadn't had certain spectacular moments with Draco over the last week, this would probably count as the number one most erotic experience of his life. As it happened, it still ranked among the top five. How could a person even look like this?
Then he remembered Harry’s eyes reflected in the window as he had thought: ‘beautiful’. Harry’s eyes on him in the garden, the same sharp focus of his green gaze. Slowly, warmth replaced the cold dread clinging to his thoughts. He let himself fall back into the mattress and think of green eyes instead of blue, of a hot temper and gentle hands and a blushing neck.
“Ah, well. I. I only ever went to Ron’s place by floo.” And by flying car, Harry thought, but didn’t say.
Harry felt an answering grin spread across his own face and then they were chuckling together in delight.
Surprise everyone! I have so much to do that I have to publish this now, otherwise I will just keep working on it and I simply don't have the time to do that.
“Yeah. I’ll take one of yours next time,” he said apologetically, plucking blades of grass and fiddling with them. He had expected Ron to have stomped inside and started a fight with Draco by now, or to shout at him some more, or at least to ask loads of angry passive-aggressive questions. However, he was just lying there, eyes closed, breathing deeply. The only outward sign he showed for any uneasiness were the lines on his forehead.
He shifted his focus and saw Bill sitting on a chair back to front, gesticulating wildly, then throwing his head back laughing, neck exposed. He couldn’t hear anything, but he felt the warm cup between Draco’s fingers and the chair underneath him. He was in a kitchen he’d never seen before. The walls and furniture where white-washed and a picture of Bill and Fleur in their wedding attire decorated the opposite wall. Their home, then.
Keeping their bodies in contact, he dragged himself down Harry’s front until he was down on his knees in front of him once more. Only this time, he had a very different goal, it seemed. Harry gripped the sill firmly as Draco looked up at him briefly, through hooded eyes. Whatever he saw in Harry’s face, it seemed to satisfy him, because he cupped Harry through his shorts in one smooth motion, rubbing in slow circles.
“Anything,” Draco said quietly. “Anything you want to know. I will answer you, without hesitation or ambiguity.”
And now that he wasn’t being chased through a forest, he realised he felt… different. Lighter, more comfortable, and more centred at the same time. But that could just be the connection he felt with Draco. It had moved from his gut upwards towards his breastbone. When he closed his eyes, it was there. Warm, pulsing, nestled between his ribs. It felt weird, unfamiliar.
“No, we are uh… staying over at Ron’s place until term starts,” Harry said, gesturing towards Ron, who waved awkwardly.
can’t use them to get at me. On top of that, any emotional connection I have with my parents is useless to exploit, because I have no say over what I do if given a direct order. That means Mother is safe! You must see how well this all works out!”
“Don’t bother with the plate, you can bring it back down tomorrow morning. Sleep well!” She fairly shoved Harry towards the stairs, handing him fork and knife with an afterthought.
“They're all at Aunt Adalberta’s for the weekend. She says she is dying and wants to see them before she goes. She’s been saying that for the last twenty-two years.” He smiled widely. “Fleur and I just got back from our honeymoon yesterday.”
Harry felt a brief pang to have made him go all polite again, but overall, he was just glad to be spared a scene.
When their plates were empty and Mrs. Weasley began clearing the table, Mr. Weasley scraped back his chair and looked at his wife with serious eyes, clearing his throat.
They locked eyes grimly. Harry took everything back. Draco could hold his own in a fight quite without his help.
“Well, you would definitely think he did, from the way he so blatantly favours Gryffindor. At first, I thought he was just doing it to curry your favour, but Father said he’s been like that from the start,” Draco said.
Harry’s brain switched into survival mode and he stayed absolutely quiet, just shaking his head when Professor McGonagall asked him if he needed clarification on something. The sooner they got this conversation over with, the better.
“I talk about him however I like, Potter. It’s not like he ever did anything for me or my family. Or any Slytherin, for that matter,” Draco spat.
“Yes, but it doesn’t really keep you in form! And when Hermione was here, I didn’t want to spend too much time just doing drills and stuff. You know I hate drills. And Ginny just kept complaining that I wasn’t good enough and needed to practice more and I just…”
When they got off the train at last, it was pitch dark beyond the puddles of light underneath the streetlamps.
Draco snorted. “As is comes, Fleur is quite handy with all the wardrobe and cosmetic charms I never bothered to learn.”
“Furthermore, you are a married couple in the eyes of the law and even though the current situation is somewhat… unusual, Hogwarts rules are very clear on providing housing and quarters.”
Harry did as asked and placed his wand against the chest. It flared a quick white and the lock clicked open. When he lifted the lid, he instantly felt like something was wrong. However, when he peered inside, nothing happened. It looked the same it always did – a bit chaotic but everything in its place. It didn’t seem like anything was missing.
“Ah, I didn’t mean… I just meant to say, I’m not wearing a shirt, so…” Harry got up and snatched a shirt from Ron’s altar of clothes on the chair and pulled on a pair of shorts. The whole pile wobbled dangerously, but held.
“Mr. Potter, please sit down. If you want to meet with somebody, you may invite them into your quarters.”
Puzzled, he blew on his tea to cool it. What was Draco doing at the cottage? He could have said something, really. Now that he knew Draco was indisposed, the urge to take him along became nearly unbearable.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “True,” he said slowly, “it must have something to do with our… situation.” He coughed delicately and looked away.
“Fleur’s right, you know. A man needs his food. Half an hour won’t hurt,” he said at last and plonked himself down.
“I’m not sure,” Hermione whispered back. “It might be best to go back to the Burrow and come back this evening.”
Harry’s mouth dropped open. How in Merlin’s name had Draco done that? Harry had only ever seen Mr. Weasley placate Mrs. Weasley like that and never with such ease.
“Au revoir, ‘Arry!” Fleur said, as she kissed his cheeks. Bill clapped Ron on the shoulder and Fleur made him blush as she kissed him in goodbye, too. “Au revoir, Ron!”
Warily Harry came forward. He half expected Malfoy to pull the chair out from under him, but as he sat down, Malfoy merely took his cup and filled it from the pot, then added a splash of milk and set it down before him.
What Harry had not expected to see the next day, when he came down to hunt the delicious smell creeping up the stairs and through the crack of his door, was Draco Malfoy holding a lively conversation with Fleur Delacour – no, Weasley – in the midst of the homely chaos that was the Weasley kitchen. They were truly a picture to behold. He was sitting at the head of the table, cup of tea lifted daintily and top three buttons undone. He was eerily handsome with his friendly look and open mien. Fleur was standing to his left. Her apron was stained with flour and she was enthusiastically waving about a pair of serving tongs. French flowed freely from her lips and she was absolutely radiant. Her hair was carefully braided down the back and her smile so lovely, Harry took a step towards her involuntarily. He bumped into Bill’s shoulder, who was leaning against the staircase, watching the scene with an amused glint in his eyes.
“What is it? Tell me!” she demanded. Honestly, she was like a sniffer dog following the scent of blood ten miles against the wind.
“Well, he seemed like a clever guy, so maybe he just figured the fettering broke, seeing as the ferret is obviously not around,” he said with a shrug, eyeing Hermione’s cup.
It wasn’t his fault for getting used to the git’s barbed comments and thinly veiled innuendos. It wasn’t his fault either that they’d had to leave without him this morning. And it definitely wasn’t his fault that being here on his own felt like wearing a bath robe to a fancy pure-blood reception he hadn’t been invited to in the first place. Too exposed. Too… naked.
If he hadn’t faced Voldemort on his own on a graveyard aged fourteen, he might have said this had been the worst experience of his life.
Draco’s hand in his felt nice. Comfortable. He wondered what it would feel like, sleeping in the same bed, the way they were now.
He shrugged his shoulders and waved a hand. Immediately the kitchen was softly lit with candles, bottoms melted to the dining table and windowsills. A fire popped up in the hearth and added to the warmth of the mild August night. The flickering, velvety light didn’t help the torso-situation.
Harry was briefly taken aback by his straightforwardness. He hadn’t even thought about the next step.
“On singular devotion expressed through physical union,” Draco drawled. “What Molly and Arthur are trying to explain is that a person has to be sexually matured for the bond to take hold, so underage is not a legal constraint for the bond to be recognised officially.”
“No, I’m alright. I just felt different afterwards and I wanted to see if it’s still like that. Better, I mean. I feel better.”
For orientation: From my perspective, everything fits together best, when the potions accident happened before Harry cursed Draco with sectumsempra in the bathroom, because there is never any mention of the accident or any scars. That means, of course, that Harry was not in detention with Snape during the quidditch game, but could not have played either. He would have been sitting in the stands, as far from Draco as possible, and been very unhappy with the whole situation. He would not have been able to party with the rest of Gryffindor after the win and therefore, would not have kissed Ginny. Dumbledore would have given Harry and Draco adjoining rooms somewhere in Hogwarts, beds only seperated by a wall. They would have gone through a few weeks of juggling their classes and their studying, and Draco would not have been able to go to the room of requirement and work on the cabinet. Lucius would have managed to pass off the accident as an opportunity to Voldemort, therefore Draco's family would be safe for the time being. Hogwarts would not have been attacked by the Death Eaters et voilá; Dumbledore is still alive. All the other plot details will be reveiled throughout the story.
“We found a… different solution. I don’t understand any of it, you would have to speak to Professor Dumbledore…”
Then he turned around, leaned against the counter casually and said: “I think it just hurt my heart to see you stumbling about like a new-born baby deer pretending to be a dangerous animal in front of a herd of friendly fierce lions.” He barked a quick laugh. “Ha! Even Harry had to protect you from the little lion cub!”
“Well?” Draco asked, eyebrow raised. “I know basic courtesy is not something you were taught, but a simple ‘thank you’ would have sufficed,” he said blandly, inspecting his fingernails. “I am already regretting my choice.”
When Harry hesitated, Draco clucked his tongue in irritation and snatched both of Harry’s wrists and put them on his head.
It seemed that their problem with the unfettering had been more complicated than he’d realised, if the school had hired an entire group of people to work on a solution. He'd always assumed Snape would just whip up a potion and that would be that.
That had been… something. If Draco knew, Harry would never hear the end of it. He would spend the rest of his earthly existence being torturously reminded of having gotten
The second eyebrow joined the first. “Do you want to stumble around the countryside in the dark, hoping for the best, or would you actually like to arrive before sunrise?” Draco retorted snidely. “I’d like to get a few hours of sleep in and maybe change out of these disgusting clothes if it’s all the same to you.”
This chapter earns the "mature" rating, so if that's not your cup of tea, I will post lines in the notes at the end (I'm not going to spoiler the others by posting them here), so you can have a look at them now and skip that part, if you want. Heed the tags.
Draco sat up abruptly. “My choice to get you tea, you imbecile. What did you think? I would put up with this household if I weren’t sure of you?”
Harry reared back in shock. He should be furious. He wanted to be furious. But Draco was talking more to himself than to Harry, there at the end, and – it was somehow easier to see him condescending than… how he had been before. Harry really didn’t want to fight. It made something inside him shrivel.
“Hermione?” Ron groaned from the bed, lifting his head from the pillows just enough to glance towards them through a cracked eye.
“Good evening. We have not yet been introduced. I am Draco Ignatius Abraxus Malfoy, thirty-seventh of the line of Armand Malfoy. I greet the Weasley family and hereby request Sanctuary for myself and my Bonded.”
He just waited. The best way to make someone talk was to make them feel responsible for filling the silence. He listened to the seconds tick by on the lavender clock on the wall.
“Ron, I’m sorry,” Harry said. “Mrs. Weasley, please, there’s no need. I’m sure Ron just forgot Draco was there and he… well, we do stuff like that all the time, don’t we, Ron? It’s all just in good fun.” He nudged Ron in the side.
“You heard Hartmuth, ey? He can be a little… fierce, but I can vouch for him. He is a very noble-hearted man,” Mr. Al-Keydari said.
Harry thought about this, too. He couldn’t believe it of Draco, not after what happened earlier today. Nobody was that good an actor. He blushed remembering what Draco had looked like after their little tryst. Nobody could have acted
“Well,” he said after a while, “Ginny just wants me to be keeper all the time so she can ‘practice her aiming and trick shots’.” The last was delivered with a whining lilt. “We did play a few games over the summer, but Fred and George are always busy, either with their shop or doing secret stuff for the order.”
He grimaced. “It’s just not something to write in a letter. I wasn’t even sure what I thought about it myself. And if everything had happened the way we’d thought with the unfettering brew, it certainly wouldn’t have mattered.”
Slowly he closed the distance between their bodies and pressed his thigh between Harry’s legs. Harry’s breathing stopped. His whole body was one tense line.
“…never felt it to be necessary. It is said Harry Potter is a great sorcerer. Ve all know ze story, of course. Vhy vas he not apprenticed in a Guild? Or sent to a Internat for gifted?”
Harry stared dumfounded as Draco set his wand down in his left hand, closed it around the shaft and drew it once along it’s length. The blood smeared across the wood and after a second, was sucked into it. When he got up, he stumbled slightly and would have fallen, had Harry not moved instinctively and, catching him around the middle, helped him back towards the chair.
He blushed, vaguely uncomfortable with her direct staring. When he strode past her, he imagined seeing her hide something in the inner pocket of her coat. However, when he slowed to cast a surreptitious glance back, she was just pulling on a glove. Probably getting off at the next stop.
Ron turned around and threw Harry a dirty look. Harry chuckled and leaned back in his chair languidly, sighing contentedly.
Actually, he had been astonished to see the same ordinary young man looking back at him from the mirror. The same ordinary young man as two days ago in the huge gilded looking glass in Malfoy manor.
“That’s rich, you talking about bullying,” Harry wanted to say, but he was distracted by a flattering in his ribcage that felt really very odd. Initially, he thought it was his temper getting the best of him, but the feeling wasn’t quite sharp enough to be anger.
“Are you sure?” Draco asked. He looked around sceptically. “Who cultivates marshes in their back garden? Ugh, it’s revolting. My shoes are ruined!”
He moaned unrestrictedly because he somehow expected the sound to get stuck in his throat but instead, it rang loudly into the room, over the muffled noises Draco was making himself.
“I could have barbequed you on the spot, you know," Bill added with a bit too much cheer. "I felt someone unfamiliar pass the wards. I thought I would recognise everyone’s signature, but I guess not.”
Then he blinked. Had Bill just offered them a shared room? No, worse. A shared bed? Harry wasn’t quite sure he was ready to be that close to Draco, after the… Incident. Also, he really was exhausted.
The first time he had seen a woman naked, he was four years old. He’d had a nightmare and stumbled into his parent’s bedchamber. His father was nowhere to be seen, but his mother sat on the chair at her dressing table, fingers gliding through rows of glittering pearls and stone necklaces. The landscape of her back was flawless; a meandering expanse of smooth, unblemished skin. He ran to her, thinking she would be a warm comforter, as he knew her to be, but when he touched her back, she was cool. In his child’s mind, fraught with the lingering taste of his bad dreams, this felt very wrong. He flinched back.
Draco stiffened slightly and then lounged back into his chair so casually, it was evidently a calculated move. His good breeding probably stopped him from betraying himself in a more obvious way, but Harry could tell he was surprised by the straightforwardness of his question.
“A fact which Ron never made us forget by complaining about it loudly and without pause,” Bill declared as he walked in the door. Fleur entered behind him and set the dishes to wash themselves, before sitting down next to Bill.
“They were thoroughly checked for any kind of maleficent magic or spells, of course, but please open it up for me once, to make sure nothing escaped our attention,” Professor McGonagall said.
“I’m going to apparate us. But you have to be the link. Think about where you want to go. Picture it in your mind, very clearly. Don’t think of anything else!”
If only Mrs. Weasley knew what kind of extra lessons Professor Dumbledore had been taking with him. She would be horrified to know Harry had supported him in finding heavily warded, cursed and volatile pieces of Voldemort’s soul and worked on understanding his twisted worldview, in order to destroy him with that knowledge.
“All done, I’m decent,” he pronounced and made space on his bunk bed, shifting blankets and cushions aside. “Come, take a seat.” He sat down cross legged at the head and patted the mattress in front of him.
“You have no idea what it’s like to live in that school and get sideway glances whenever you set foot out the common room door! The only places we can relax are our own dormitories! It’s bad enough the other pupils treat us like a pest of sewage grindylows, but Snape is the only teacher who’s on our side! If you think for a minute that I will respect a man who turns a blind eye when children are being bullied whose only crime is belonging to the wrong house, you are clearly deranged!”
“Here we are,” Professor McGonagall said a few minutes later, as she was coming up to her office. She brandished her wand and the heavy wood door opened. They stepped inside.
“I give up. It’s just not fair with you on that broom,” Ron panted as he lay in the grass, chest heaving. Harry sat down next to him.
The water went on in the other room and Harry felt at home for the first time in weeks. He could nearly forget Draco was there in the house, writing mysterious letters and being unnaturally unobtrusive. Now that he thought about it, Draco was not at all behaving like Harry had expected. He’d been a bit rude to Ron, but there had been no taunting, no insults. Well, it would be quite the thing to insult someone in their own home, even for Draco.
“You and Mr. Malfoy have been assigned a set of rooms in the guest quarters. Two bedrooms with a desk each, a bathroom and a small sitting room for entertaining guests. The rules are as follows: You will attend breakfast, lunch and dinner the same as all other students, downstairs in the Great Hall. You may use the homework room, the library and the Great Hall to study. You are not allowed to enter any of the house common rooms-”
They didn’t talk much sitting on the train to Devon. Harry was exhausted now that the adrenaline was starting to wear off. Building that wall back up had been draining enough on his magic, but that awful chest injury afterwards had really taken its toll. His chest hurt just thinking about it. His body was heavy and slow and if he weren’t so tired and his head feeling so mushy, he would probably worry more about what had happened during the last few hours. As it was, he just tried not to fall asleep in his seat.
A thundering on the stairs and a booming voice tore Harry up from peaceful slumber. The door blasted open and a frazzled looking girl with hurricane hair and iron feet strode through. Her eyes were fixed on him unblinkingly, her chest contracting and expanding with rapid breathing.
“Are you ready now to admit to yourself that you want me?” Draco asked in a near whisper as he leaned in to touch his lips softly to Harry’s neck where it was exposed by Ron’s shirt’s collar. Draco pressed him against the windowsill and his brain just switched off. Nothing mattered anymore, just this little bubble of shared warmth. His whole body hummed in satisfaction at their closeness. Draco’s hair tickled his cheek. His waist was slim where Harry had lifted his hands to dig his fingers into Draco’s sides. His spine tingled and he could slowly feel his hunger awaken, a rising need to touch and to be touched in return, to let his hands glide along Draco’s skin and feel him tremble in response, preferably naked and underneath a soft blanket. He was nowhere near inclined to admit this out loud, however. It felt like he would somehow lose to Draco if he did.
doing here?” He added, rounding on Draco, who sat in his chair, not a hair out of place, while everything and everyone around him looked like a gang of pixies had given it their all to tear down the place. A drunken, furious gang of pixies who had come back to their nest after a good round of beers in the pub around the corner, only to find their front door knocked down and their grandmothers abducted and had then sworn to take revenge on the next best wizarding lair they came across.
“Let’s see if I taste like you as well,” he teased with a smirk. He held Harry's gaze confidently but after a second, Harry thought he saw a fraction of doubt creep into the lines of his face. “By your leave?” Draco inqired earnestly.
“Not that it’s very likely I’ll stay the heir for much longer, anyway. But there is nowhere else I’d want to be. Some are moving to France.” He shuddered. “It’s nice for a holiday, but who’d like to spend an entire life there?” he asked in apparent revulsion. “They’re so… rude. No etiquette in the purist circles. And did you know it takes nearly twenty minutes to get a glass of water in a Parisienne café?”
“Forgive me. I am… quick to jump into discussions. Tell me, how are you doing? How is Master Malfoy?” he asked. He was still studying Harry more intently than he felt comfortable with, but at least his tone had evened.
“She ‘as brought it upon ‘erself. Eet is never a wise idea to zreaten somebody’s bonded partner, especially when that certain someone is as magically powerful as ‘Arry,” Fleur threw in.
“That’s because it’s amusing to see you suffer. Your pain causes amusement. Your suffering is a constant source of satisfaction. It’s fun to-“
Professor McGonagall eyed him. “You remember the condition you were in a few days ago, I trust?” she asked, but she didn’t wait for him to answer. “Albus contacted quite a few experts on the matter and soon we were having a whole band of ‘professionals’, who ‘only wanted to help’ and the matter got quite out of hand, if you ask me.”
He stopped next to her and put a tentative hand on her arm. His expression had changed from night to day in a second.
If you want to avoid the sexy time, skip from "Are you ready now to admit to yourself that you want me?” to "But then, a smile began to form on Draco’s face..."
“Yes, I’m fine, Harry.” He said earnestly. Then he lowered his head onto Harry’s arm atop the table and closed his eyes. “That was awful,” he added quietly.
Harry vaguely felt offended that Draco was calling Mr. Weasley by his first name, but most of his attention was held by the increasing anxiety that bubbled up from his stomach. Why did his life have to be so complicated? Bugger that, his life had been complicated before. Why did it have to get worse every year? Like being destined to get rid of a mad Dark Wizard wasn’t enough. Like losing the last family he’d had wasn’t enough. Now he would have to give up the only thing he had truly looked forward to in his last year at Hogwarts: spending as much time with his friends as he possibly could, before he was faced with the decision of where go from there; trying to get through endless days on his own, with no assurance that, like now, he could go back home, after the holidays.
Actually, Harry’d rather forego any interrogation, thanks. To be honest, he wanted to turn right around, floo back to the Burrow and curl up on one of the comfortable armchairs, listening to Draco’s quicksilver remarks about ‘muggle monstrosities’, as he had begun to call any muggle invention that could move, make noise or ‘in any way, shape or form imitate magic in that terrifying and unnatural way of theirs’.
“Please, call me Maria, Harry. I am fabuloso, thank you. What brings you here? I understand term does not start until September?”
If Hermione’s eyes weren’t so full of steel, Harry would have laughed at this pronouncement. Draco, a spy?
“Don’t make it sound so simple, it is far more than that,” Mr. Al-Keydari retorted a little hotly. “Of course it comes from the magical core, but where is the connection between the biological and the magical sphere, huh? How does the magic travel through the body when a wizard does a spell with his wand? Without his wand? How does the magic know his intentions just from a thought when it’s not connected to his nervous system? Is it like an extra muscle? Why does blood magic work and would a person’s magic change if they got a full blood transfer? Is magic transplantable? Can a squib or a muggle be given magic?”
“How could you tell? It’s not like you really know him.” Hermione crossed her arms. She was radiating ‘stubborn’.
And then Draco recounted it all again. Harry would have thought him to be reluctant, but he left nothing out and gave great detail when Mrs. Weasley interjected questions to clarify something. Harry’s ears went hot a few times during the history and Mr. Weasley cleared his throat nervously when it came to the sleeping arrangements. Draco made it quite clear what they had been up to. His face flushed unbecomingly, but he never paused his recounting. Fleur listened to it all with an indulgent smile. Bill merely cocked his head when he heard information that seemed to interest him, especially when it came to Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy’s behaviour. Mrs. Weasley exclaimed in shocked outrage at Draco’s description of the caning and patted Harry’s cheek when he spoke of how Harry had helped him up the stairs and healed his wounds. “Well done, Harry,” she said. When Draco finished at last with their arrival at the burrow, the table was steeped in a contemplative hush.
“I’m absolutely done for when she comes back, aren’t I,” he stated dryly. “What am I going to do? She will hex me as soon as my back is turned. She was fawning over Harry since second year. Do I even stand a change in face of this insurmountable strength of teenage infatuation?”
“It’s… not a very widely known spell,” Draco said carefully. “And it’s kind of one of Mother’s specialities, so Molly would not get hold of it under more ordinary circumstances.”
