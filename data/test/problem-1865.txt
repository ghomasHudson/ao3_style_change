“Sometimes you’re as oblivious as a crup. Of course, there was a problem, anyone could see it! Poor Theo was head over heels and you were leading him on.” Hannah returns to her desk to write something down, never looking up from the file.
(See the end of the chapter for
However, before he can consult his partner about his situation, the second he steps into his office, Hannah is scurrying about, throwing her coat on and handing Harry his wand holster.
Harry wakes up with a start that night. Gasping for air he can’t get, not even remembering the dream that seemed so bad it woke him.
As he gets closer he can distinctly make out the song “Sex on Fire” by Kings of Leon. Well, whoever has broken into my house to listen to music has good taste, Harry thinks. Nothing could prepare Harry for the scene laid out in front of him as the sitting room came into view.
The truth is, Harry had seen Malfoy since the trial. It was a couple of weeks after moving into the boring London flat he currently resides in. He had gone to the corner CVS to stock up on an extra toothbrush and toothpaste since Theo had started to stay over more. Malfoy hadn’t seen him. Harry stood standing in the razor aisle just watching the back of Malfoy’s platinum head as he checked out and then left. Harry had no clue as to why he didn’t walk up and say something, anything, rather than staying hidden behind a shelf and staring like an insane stalker.
“I don’t know any wandmakers,” Harry says, trying his best not to think about Olivander’s sunken features when they rescued him from Malfoy manor. Hermionie looks deep in thought for a few seconds until-
There's a knock at the door and before either Harry or Hannah can answer, Ron comes crashing in, joyful as ever, and plops onto Harry's desk on the only spot unoccupied by papers or pictures of friends. “Hiya Hannah!” Hannah gives a small wave without looking up, having redirected her attention back to her work.
Malfoy is leaning his hands on the counter, back towards Harry, head bowed. “Hermione if you’ve come to comfort me I’m afraid-“
Later, Harry decides to abandon his paperwork and heads to the training room downstairs. He packs his things to take with him, planning on leaving straight afterward. He bids a quick goodbye to Hannah and heads for the elevators.
“What’s wrong?” Theo asks groggily from the other side of the bed. He’s far away and his voice is deep with sleep. It's hard to make out what he’s saying.
“No one is asking you to! But for Merlin’s sake harry, you’re dating one of his best friends so it’s only-“
“Y-Yes.”
“Oh, Hello Hermione,” Theo says in a friendly tone with a wide smile as he enters the room taking his coat off. Hermione stands up to kiss him, hello, then Theo shuffled past her between the couch and the coffee table to kiss Harry hello as well.
It was never something he wanted, Harry realized a couple of months back when he had done nothing but paperwork for three weeks in a row. It was always something he had felt he had to want. To impress Lupin maybe, to serve even after the war perhaps. He can't pinpoint a reason that his fifteen-year-old mind would have come up with.
He sees Lupin and his warm eyes and offers of chocolate. He sees Sirius and his tight hugs and barking laugh. He sees Tonks and her silly antics and her bond with Ginny. He sees Fred and his brotherly protection on the quidditch field.
“Hi, Hannah!” Hermionie says in a cheerful its-Friday-and-I’m-excited-to-get-drunk-tonight tone.
“Hey, hot stuff,” Hannah replies with a wink, and Hermionie rolls her eyes. Hannah’s harmless crush on Hermionie is a bit of an inside joke between the two brunettes.
Hermione shoots Harry a look from where she is standing by the mantle after kissing both of Malfoy’s cheeks.
“Ron, wait!” Ron turns back.
“Sounds about right.”
Theo stares at him as he rants, unimpressed. “Look, Harry,” Theo is much calmer than Harry now and looks exhausted. “You haven’t given Draco the time of day to realize that he has changed genuinely, it's not just an act. You actually have a habit of not even giving the people in your life the time of day.” Harry looks up from his feet at that.
The next five minutes pass in a blur, Harry recognizes that they have managed to take out about seven dealers, Harry is responsible for two. Harry hates the chaos of it all. There is yelling coming from all sides, incantations, and screams of pain. Harry does as he was trained to do and blocks them out and focuses on his own duel. Harry hits his current opponent with a nasty hex and they go down, looking dazed, once he is sure that they aren’t getting up anytime soon, Harry looks around. The Aurors have taken the upper hand and everyone is rounding up the last of the criminals. He turns behind himself to see Hannah struggling in a duel with a wizard who looks much more determined than the others. He’s large, pale, and looks rather ghostly. Harry rushes over to give her a hand.
Harry looks back at his wand, struggles to his feet, and attempts the same spell on a now unmoving dummy. The spell does the same amount of placid damage as it did a moment ago. Harry frowns, confused, and casts it one more time. This time it works perfectly well. Harry thinks nothing of the incident, blames it on his tired state and heads to the showers.
“Malfoy?!”
The front door opens and closes. From the hallway, Harry can hear Theo calling his name.
“You’re having fun. I’m waiting for something more that will never come.” theo says with a sad smile. He says nothing more and retreats to the bedroom. He comes back a minute later with a few of his clothes and his toothbrush. Harry stays where he is because apparently, that’s his response to not knowing what to say next.
“Why on earth would you do that?” Harry knows that Hermione and Ron have been spending time with Malfoy recently, but he hadn’t thought much of it; it had never occurred to him that they could actually be becoming… friends.
The six pairs of Aurors all burst into the barn from the different areas they’re stationed at. Almost immediately, Harry realizes they have underestimated the number of people they are dealing with. There were about fifteen smugglers, who all seemed less surprised than Harry would have liked. The area is large and there’s not much in the building to hide behind, just a few full crates sporadically organized in piles.
“Because I was too hot for you” Hannah responds sipping on her tea. “And because you barely acknowledged my existence before fifth year.”
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about Theo I was being a real git.”
“The wand chooses the wizard.” Ollivander had said. So then why did Harry’s feel so foreign in his hands now? He holds the 11” in his hands as he sits on his made-up king bed in a large plain room. The weight of the wand in his hand feels wrong like it had been made for his teenage hands and not his adult hands.
“Look, Harry,” Sentences that started with “look, Harry,” from Hermione never ended well, thought harry.
“Ok. Ok, I’ll talk to Malfoy.”
Directly across the table is- well, it used to be Malfoy and Fleur discussing French literature, but now Fleur has turned to her right and is trying very hard to talk to Percy who seems utterly bored by anything she has to say. Malfoy’s seat is empty and Harry looks towards the kitchen door just in time to see his white hair duck through the door frame. Merlin, what is he? 6’3? Harry thinks to himself.
“I know.”
“I’ll be off then,” Hermione says. Harry stands to hug her goodbye. “I’ll see you tomorrow! Don’t forget!” Hermione steps through the floo and is gone before Harry can say anything.
Without truly knowing the reason why he gets up from his chair and follows Malfoy into the kitchen. It’s a bit like the feeling he got earlier when he remembered the wand. The wand.
“Nothing,” Harry manages to rasp out through breaths that are barely coming. “Go back to sleep” Theo listens and rolls over and is fast asleep in seconds flat.
“Yes, you have.” She finally says. Harry rolls his eyes.
“What's tomorrow?” Theo asks and settles himself on the couch looking too at home and comfortable it makes Harry anxious. Harry is still standing.
“I’m not complaining! I just don’t understand why it ended so abruptly, I didn’t think there was a problem, I mean, come on! At the first sight of a fight and he bails!”
“Because he assumed you would have told me, which makes sense since I’m you’re best mate, or do we just not tell each other things anymore?” Ron shoots back with more venom than before. Harry feels the guilt build up in his gut.
“Look,” Harry starts trying to keep himself calm. “You can’t just go around inviting your friends into other people’s houses! Especially people that they don’t particularly care to have in their house.”
“Yea, about a week ago, I’m surprised he didn’t tell you already.”
Harry, still taken aback by Ron’s sudden appearance, is understandably confused. “What happened to what?!”
“I know but-”
Draco Malfoy enters the room in a way that Harry never thought possible, humbled and head bowed. He’s wearing dark slacks and a long dark cloak that looks like it cost a small fortune. He’s tall, taller than he was at school. His hair is no longer violently slicked back with gel and falls into his pale eyes. Ginny and Ron stop their conversation and get up to hug Malfoy. Malfoy makes the same rounds Harry did, greeting and hugging as if he had done it all along. It made something vile squeeze in his chest.
“Look you need to either find someone who you genuinely want to start a relationship with or find someone who wants the same things as you… preferable both actually.”
Harry is about to defend himself when he stops and, as he rarely does, takes a moment to consider what Hannah said. Had he been leading Theo on? Harry thinks he had made it clear that he never wanted anything more than they had, but maybe he was not communicating that as well as he could have.
heated.
Harry’s breath brushed over my naked neck, wet and hot, as he pulled my head to the side some more and brought the soft of his lips over the flesh that was open to his taking, his mouth covering the white of my skin and puncturing my throat with the prick of his teeth, stabbing his mouth into me as the muscles in his jaw ticked and locked in its defined lines as he bit me.
Oh bloody
Although with both of our words said and out of the way now, I did feel ten times better but I was still worried about the state of my magic.
Just the scent of cigars and chocolate dipped in warmed milk that specifically attached itself to the Golden Boy indicated that Harry was the one currently pressing me into the counter that wrapped around the whole of the kitchen, the jut of my hip bones jarring against the edged surface as my outstretched arm bent like a noodle in a state of shocked weakness at the single touch from Harry.
I felt the strands of my dark hair brush across my temples and the back of my neck in fluttering caresses as I slammed my eyes shut and roared out my release, my cock
The long sleeves went past my hands a little for my fingers to curl into the hem lines as a grounding material, the dark green a lovely color against the pale of my flesh with the collar showing the slight of my sharp collarbones and the right of my shoulder a tad bit.
was the real reason why Chang had so much hate for me all of the sudden.
It was easy for me to be cold and callous, hell, I always been inside since I was a child but over the years that passed, I started to care less about my appearance and shown the wizarding and muggle world how fucked up I was, to an extent that wouldn’t make them put me on death row that is. I conjured up a new mask that shown some of my personality but most of it was still kept away. So I thought being the bastard I was around Draco would elicit the blonde to grow hatred for me and keep himself safe from my being when I was trying so hard to be clear of him because of my fear of killing him if I had him, but the damn Slytherin fought back and made my void fill with overwhelming emotions ten fold when we would interact with one another. Instead of shuttering himself out from me, Draco shown his like for the toxicity I had and that made me want him even more because that meant that he liked both my good and bad sides. He didn’t hide from my wretched person but instead, was excited and captivatingly scared of me.
It felt as if the malevolent air I felt at this exact moment was coming from Harry.
I recoiled from the massive body of the creature’s, my body instinctively going for its “flight” mode as my mind determinedly tried to find a grounding sensation of sorts to keep myself from outright screaming bloody murder.
!” My head fell back, pressing it against the wall behind me as the the magic slipped its way between the spread of my thighs and caressed the curves of my bum, lightly ghosting over the jean clad hole of my arse, burning and mocking.
“He’s the running mayor of Wisixi Podge and he raped his eight year old daughter repeatedly, Weasley. No one wants a leader who hides behind a facade of smiles, fake righteousness, and sick pedophilic tendencies. His daughter needs a just treatment from the father she believed would always protect her, not
Caetia was clad in black leather short shorts, tight fitted around the slim of his frame with a long sleeve navy blue top that shown the sides of his shoulders in an open oval formation before the material fabricated once again to reach the middle of his fingers, sheer and see through as it shown the curves of his person, chest exposed and walking around with a pair of black high heel boots, the smooth of his white skin on display with a decadent and wondrous mask of subtle makeup.
I visibly shuddered at the way Potter turned cruel in front of me, more so than he had been a few minutes ago, my breaths coming out quicker as warmth blanketed the whole of my trembling body.
Let’s see if I’ll get caught.
that he kept secret from everyone, including himself.
I quickly went still, limbs limp and hanging from the force holding me up, breathing raggedly as if I had been been running a marathon, eyes falling heavy as I did as I was told without any struggle, energy simmering low in my abdomen and causing me to part my lips and wet them with the tip of my wandering tongue.
Right now though, I was showing how much of a Malfoy I was and that surely wouldn’t get me on Potter’s good side.
The wet snow kissed strands of Draco’s hair fell around the quaking of his shoulders in wisps of tousled filthy euphoria, the cherry petal “O” shape of his moist lips moving about in frenzied scorch, opening and closing with the slut of his broken kittenish mewls and squeaky unhinged pleasured screams a symphony of bliss in my ears as I took in the way the flushed peach tinge of his perky nipples hardened and stood up invitingly.
Cruel, heartless and

My legs dangled a few feet above the ground from Harry’s hold on me, his arm practically a sitting chair for my arse.

person ebbed away at the severity that I built inside myself and the calm facade that I crafted for others to see and cover up the true form of my vicious being.
A keen left my mouth at the filthy words the Gryffindor spoke out loud, him calling me  a “whore” doing nothing but quickening the rush of blood to my perking cock and infusing gas to the fire growing within my quivering chest.
Assholes.
No word about Astringent.
But the question was
“I’d like you to be the one to drop the potions into the facility from the rooftop of the building right into the large open vent there. I figured since you made the potion, you could be the one to release it and make some more use of yourself,” Hezian intoned smoothly.
I was taught by my father to be cold to others and because of that, no one liked me and thought of me to be a heartless bitch.
I was often chained up for most of the time while Zereth was off doing gods knew what. And once the demon would come back, they’d let me go to the bathroom and clean myself up and then force me to kill whoever they deemed worthy to die by my own hands.
And people were
A mewl, tiny and kittenish, bubbled up out of my working throat, lips popping open wide as my low lidded pale eyes stared up at the inclining staircases coveted in darkness and flicks of lightning spilling through the large window with the milky froth light of the opal moon splashing over the granite of the steps.
I rounded the table again to Neville's side, snatching my hand out to grasp the bag of edibles that were in the air after being tossed up once again in Neville’s hand, only for it to pop out of my line of sight just as I was about to grab it.
The heavy presence in my groin kept building and I was chanting out Harry’s names between the influx of my rapid breaths, the only thing holding my lower half up into the air and in the Gryffindor’s lap was Harry’s one hand as he forcefully rocked my pained prick over his own in delicious sway and drag.
With the spread of my legs around Harry’s lower abdomen, my thighs clenched on instinct in an attempt to cover up the perk of my cock pressing insistently against the side of Harry’s hip. I couldn’t close my legs together though, given the mere fact that Harry’s body was literally situated between the open V of my thighs.
“Such a whore”. Harry mumbled his words, voice dropping into a half animalistic growl and groan as he went back to shoving his lips and tongue over my own while ramming his finger harder into me.
“Why do you do
And Neville just stared right at me with golden eyes piercing into my narrowed gaze, tossing the bag of drugged gummy foods in his hands with that easy calm grin of his that I wanted to slap off of his striking face.
I wailed then.
The Assassin had given me dark blue tight yet comfortable jeans to wear and paired it off with a flimsy white short sleeve top, the clothing light and airy enough to move around in and not get in the way of my work. My simple black converse shoes squeaked softly whenever I walked over the pristine linoleum floor, the sound irritating to my ears but something I could handle nonetheless.
I made such a pristine and pure thing, so messed up from the inside and out.
Not this time.
Potter raised his brows up at me from his perch, the succulent line of his lips giving no sign of emotion away but a careless, bored expression. “Why so jumpy, Malfoy?”
Before Harry could speak again, I spoke up, my voice neutral although I felt the exact opposite way as my heart pounded furiously against my chest and the apprehension in my body festered within as I looked over Hezian’s way again. “I’ll be okay. As long as Harry goes wherever I go, then I’m sure I can do whatever it is you want me to.”
I snapped out of my haze of thoughts when I heard the unmistakable
Neville was strikingly brutal and gorgeous in his raw cruelty.
I had to control that part of myself, my magic, from hurting the one thing that I absolutely adored.
I hope that Hezian and Chang weren’t together.
I had to relive the moment where everything came crashing down on me, where I realized with despair that I’ve had a stupid crush on Potter ever since I’ve met him. It's where I figured out that I had no strength left in me to try and kill Dumbledore. It was the moment when I cried like I was being torn apart in front of my childhood nemesis, vulnerable and tired and so very young and confused.
I found myself being lifted up on weakened limbs by the scorching touch of Harry’s hand grasping my upper arm in a vice grip, the lax of my frame tugged up roughly from the solace of the bed while my eyes wandered about with hysteric horror as I scrambled on the two clumsy, stricken feet of mine, trying to keep up with Harry’s long legged strides.
And I didn’t want to.
He knew what I just said.
“Stop giving me sass. Keep still.” The Gryffindor’s words were coated in a threatening drawl, deep and reaching into the center of my chest to grasp the erratic pounding of my heart as my hips quivered over the length of Potter’s thigh and pressed against the wall even more, my throbbing cock weeping from the pressure Potter put against it.
My insides felt as if they vibrated from the quivering of my contracting inner muscles, having constantly taken Harry’s violent cock whenever and however the man wanted me without any such protest on my behalf.
Pansy scoffed then. “What a load of bullshite, dear. The jeans look killer. I did great in picking these out from that muggle shop we visited this past summer. Now go put on that cute Slytherin sweater you bought from the student store.”
My breathing had grown shallower as I stared down at the man that was practically dismantled across the cold floor, my eyes downcast as I ran my gaze down the broken limbs and twitches of the wizard’s deteriorating body.
I couldn’t believe the fucker was dumb enough not to suspect me trying to fight me way out of this mess once I gained enough power to do so.
And oh, I didn’t like the place the brat decided to vacate in.
is.” The familiar sound of Harry’s deep timbre of a voice, warmed and in a low drawl, came directly from my right, sudden and causing me to jerk on the spot with an indefinite squeak.
I was so confused.
I rolled my eyes at the audacity of my friend's language, although I loved her immensely for it.
My attention was broken away from the scene in front of me when I saw Krum snap his head towards Harry with his brows furrowing in a look of fleeting confusion. “How did you mask his sce-”
But just this once, for a brief moment, I wanted Harry to touch me with his want for me evident and shown.
Resisting the urge to roll my eyes and hurt Caetia’s feelings with any obvious rejection in the tense line of my back, I let out a breathy sigh. “Next time knock, that would do to get on my good side, Caetia. And Sirius, please don’t ever watch me sleep again, it’s creepy as hell, and it’s nice to know that you’re alive.” I mumbled the last of my words out into the still air around me, embarrassed in showing my relief on behalf of my cousin’s living presence.
Surprise! I updated a day earlier than I said I would. Just couldn't wait to get it out there. Okay! Hope you liked this update, it's to move the plot along and get you guys riled up some more for the next chapter. Heated stuff is going to happen mixed in with anger and some questions answered. It's going to get all hot and heavy soon mwaha. The next update will be on June 5th or 6th, on Tuesday or Wednesday so please be understanding and be patient for the next chapter!
My lungs were beginning to clench with the lack of oxygen in the atmosphere around me.
The friction of my cock brushing against the muscular thigh of Harry’s from beneath my jeans as I was helpless in the man’s arms while I slid down his frame, had me give out a pathetic whine high in the back of my throat, my tummy rubbing up against his defined stomach.
your kind. I just had to find your magical traces and that scent you conduits always carry around. You’re here because I get the privilege of eating you,” Zereth intoned lowly.

And we were both fucking tired.
Why do I feel as if I did something wrong?

“Because you owe me a favor since you left me all by my lonesome self with Potter in that kitchen this morning. And what I want from you is quite simple. I want you to let me walk out of this room to let me take a look around at what’s in the club. I also want your word that if Harry comes in before I get back, you won’t tell him where I am and act like you saw me asleep in my bed, make sure that he won’t find out that I’m out and about. Yeah?” My voice seemed to grow higher with each word that uttered out of the quick work of my mouth, as if rushing my sentences would make Sirius dizzy with information overload and cause him to agree without full knowledge and acceptance of what he just assented himself to for me.
“I’m here to bring you to a man who runs an underground wizard assassination facility that no one knows about unless we want them to. What you’re seeing around you are a bunch of people who have trained themselves with their blood and bones to be the most highly wanted killers known to both human and wizard worlds. You’re here because of a sticky situation that requires this facility to take you in and make sure you’re not dead by the end of the day. You won’t know of the location this company resides, nor will you ever know. Our boss will be explaining more about the problem you’re in once he gets here, so why don’t you just stand there and take in what I’ve just told you as we wait.” Granger’s words seemed to be rehearsed, long and drawn out with a dull murmur as if she had recited this sort of explanation over and over again to countless others.
Of course they would.
These creatures, perhaps, could not see or sense those who do not use magic nor talk out loud. They didn’t have any eyes, from what I had observed from that Carbonous that Harry killed back in our guest room, and since most of the people here at the club probably talked a mile a minute in their panic as well as tried using magic to protect themselves, were easily caught by those animalistic human like things because those creatures tracked them down that way.
“It- It’s also known as Mandragora. And if-,” he took a deep breath to steady himself. “If you hear it scream, it can cause- can cause death.”
“But sir-”
Lockhart’s startled look morphed into a glower as he eyed the burnt stone walls and damaged artworks. “Those blasted ginger twins happened, if you must know. Been targeting me all year – jealous of my fame, I suppose, I’m used to that sort of thing, but setting off fireworks in my office really was just too far. You see that portrait, there?” He pointed to one of the more tattered works, merely a few scraps of canvas hanging from a charred frame. “That was worth thousands! Although plenty would have paid more for it, of course, with my smile and signature put on there. Those little Gryffindors should’ve been expelled for their mischief, and that dastardly poltergeist disposed of with them – what’s the miserable little creature’s name, Peeves? Oh, I know they’re in cohorts, plotting together to try and tear me down, but really, how is it my fault that I’m stunningly handsome and beloved by all? Honestly, I could have given them tips on their look if they’d just asked, starting with those
Harry thought,
Thankfully, Madam Pomfrey, no doubt alerted by a charm that Harry had awoken from his slumber (or maybe the word was ‘coma’ – who knew how long he’d been out) bustled into the room as a convenient distraction.
“Yes, Granger.” Blaise rolled his eyes.
“I- thank you,” Longbottom replied eventually, clearing his throat several times in a row. “And- and you can call me Neville – if you want.”
“Tha’ is wha’ we’re here for,” Hagrid replied, kneeling down next to the liquid. He scooped his fingers through it and held his hand up for them to see. “Tha’s unicorn blood, tha’ is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one’s been injured bad by somethin’. It’s our job to find the poor beast. So, Neville, ‘ermione, you’ll come with me.”
Anyway, next time Aunt Marge comes to visit!
,” Pansy fumed, inspecting a tear in her robe. “These were brand new!”
“What do you mean?” asked Hermione.
Harry fought to catch his breath, before reaching over and grabbing Draco’s hand tightly in his own with a burst of confidence. Draco managed a shaky smile in response, but Harry didn’t really feel okay until Draco had squeezed tightly at his hand.
Narcissa made her goodbyes brisk though no less enchantingly polite, and the trio made it out of the courtroom without incident – and with zero comment to the insistent journalists being barely held back by Ministry security – but their luck did not hold.
Harry flushed under the praise. “You think so?”
“So there’s a Cerberus in the school,” Blaise whispered. “I think we should analyse this back in the dungeons.”
Daphne threw her hands up in the air and collapsed on the couch. “Morons. Absolute morons.”
made him jump. Hedwig, his snowy white owl, was glaring at him through the bars of her cage. She pecked pointedly at the large lock on the cage door, the key for which was sitting comfortably on Harry’s Uncle Vernon’s belt.
Harry scowled, and wrote:
“She’s made a new friend,” Daphne told them, scowling.
Which, for Harry and Draco, included their first ever Quidditch match. Which they absolutely weren’t scared about.
Harry pushed the Chasers from his mind, focusing instead on the other Seeker. Terence Higgs had played as Seeker last year, and so normally would have maintained the position by default until Flint graduated and Adrian took over as Captain, but Higgs’ Potions scores had been so awful he’d been replaced mid-year, by order of Professor Snape. The replacement Seeker had been a seventh year, and so now the position was up for grabs once again.
Opposite Harry, Pansy looked like she was going to be sick.
Harry lowered his eyes once again. “In my room, silent.”
He collapsed. How long did it take to die from basilisk venom? Harry was sure he had read that somewhere. His addled mind tried to remember but every memory in his head was slipping through his fingers like catching sand. Was that something red above him? A Weasley, surely, Fred or George. He hoped Ginny was alright. He hoped Draco and Blaise could forgive him, some day.
“And our dad bumped into your dad, Malfoy-”
witnessed the violent murder of his parents at the tender age of one, and that sort of thing does not often give a child an inclination to laughter – but it was unsettling nonetheless.
Harry reminded himself with an internal groan. From the Potions lesson, he could guess at how his detention would go, and he could already feel his already present exhaustion intensifying.
Millicent cackled, gaining a hiss from Madam Pince – that she ignored, of course. “Nice one, mini Weasley!”
“Why, exactly, are we going into the girl’s bathroom?” Ron asked as Harry moved forward, prodding Lockhart ahead of him with the tip of his wand. “I think the teachers would’ve found Ginny already if she was just hiding in a bathroom. There’s nothing but sinks and loos in there.”
“Me too,” whispered Draco. “Goodnight, Hadrian.”
If asked to recall the way to the Headmaster’s office from that dreadful corridor, Harry would have had difficulty answering, despite his much better than average memory. He certainly could not tell you how long the journey took, but soon enough McGonagall was speaking to the stone gargoyle guarding Dumbledore’s office:
I don't like this chapter - but after rewriting it three times, I think this is the most satisfied I'm going to get. I hope you all like it more than I do.
Harry furrowed his brow – surely the twins had already explained? – but complied. “I broke a statue, sir, and used the pieces to kill it.”
This paid off, as towards the back of the row of enclosures he found what he had not known he was looking for. The information panel read
Harry didn’t really
Harry resisted the urge to cringe and wipe his hand on his trousers when he pulled away. Why were Longbottom’s hands so sweaty? It was gross.
“I have to go back to Hogwarts, I can’t stay here,” Harry told him. “I just can’t.”
Hermione made a compassionate sound in the back of her throat, and Neville gave Hagrid an awkward pat on the arm – or rather, the back of his palm, as Neville couldn’t reach any higher.
“Harry?”
Hagrid did, in fact, have an owl, a grouchy looking thing with a fiercely sharp beak and beady eyes, tucked into a ceiling beam. Harry wondered if it was another one of his “pets”. Draco scrawled a note and dropped it at the owl’s feet so as to avoid the talons. The creature shook itself, looking murderous, and grabbed the letter as soon as Draco opened the door for it.
“I said you could go get Snape if you needed to, didn’t Blaise show you my note?” Draco argued back.
“Yes,” Millicent responded in her usual blunt fashion.
it, but I can’t think where…”
“Harry, my boy,” said Dumbledore, warmly. “How are you feeling?”
“Oh come on, let’s just get to class. We’ll see you later, Harry – and sort this out, will you?”
“If anyone wanted to, er, find out some stuff, all they’d need to do is follow the spiders. That’d lead them right. That’s all I’m saying. Er. Yeah.”
The Malfoy heir scoffed, but Harry cut off his retort.
He didn’t rush to go downstairs. The one improvement on his life with the Dursleys was that Narcissa’s visit the previous year had stuck vividly in his aunt’s mind, and with that plus Harry’s own wand still on his person, Vernon and Petunia seemed (begrudgingly) willing to leave him alone. No more making breakfast and receiving only scraps, no more of Vernon’s heavy fists, no more working all day cleaning and gardening only for Petunia to berate him for a missed square inch. He was trapped in this place, but he wasn’t weak. Not anymore. His friends had taught him that.
The stranger didn’t appear to hear him. Harry moved forward, leaning around the corner to see what had so captured the boy’s attention. A crowd of elderly witches and wizards stood in silence, watching a magically levitated stretcher pass them by. The body being carried was covered completely by a white sheet.
“So,” Harry said, jumping lightly off his broom and pushing his glasses further up his nose. “What’s next?”
“Hey, Farley!” Adrian was yelling. “I just got our team a seeker!”
Aunt Petunia froze in the kitchen where she was adding the finishing touches to a large, red cake. She only moved again when she noticed Dudley extending his own thick fingers to the pudding.
Hagrid wasn’t done. “You can’t take Dumbledore! Take him away and the Muggleborns won’t stand a chance! There’ll be killings next!”
Neville was a wreck, his fretful energy getting on Harry’s nerves and making him restless and irritated – but it was far better than what he became once they stepped into the Hospital Wing.
They turned in unison, making their way to their respective positions. Harry flexed his fingers around his wand, tense with excitement. He had witnessed first-hand Draco’s spell casting prowess in Charms and Defence, not to mention his speed on the Quidditch pitch – but Harry wasn’t bad in those categories himself. He got the feeling it would be a close match.
Millicent clenched her jaw. “You don’t know anything about my parents. Don’t bring them up again.”
Shockingly enough, it was a familiar face that stopped them, one that would have at any other time been most welcome, and she wasn’t looking for the Malfoys.
“Yeah, really getting the homey vibe, aren’t you George?”
The curtain pulled back and Fred and George peered around it.
“Which should be any moment,” Vernon reminded them all. “Now, let’s run through our schedule one more time. Petunia, when the Masons get here, you will be-”
Harry stiffened. “It’s moving. Come on!”
“I don’t know,” Blaise replied. “But we need to get out of here.”
light, pupils lost in the colour yet her gaze was unmistakeable. “You would be wise to leave this forest, wizards. We will escort you and your mutt this once, as a kindness to Hagrid since you claim to know him. But beware when you seek to enter these woods again – our kindness extends no further than this night.”
“But what?” Millicent interrupted from where she sat on the floor, playing with her cat, Sabre. “From how much Blaise and Draco talk about it, you’re certainly good enough.”
Harry spun around at the same time the stranger did. They were met with a familiar face to Harry – Albus Dumbledore, though much younger than in Harry’s time. Harry straightened at the sight of the Headmaster but, like the boy, Dumbledore did not appear to see him.
“Ah, Mr. Weasley, Mr. Weasley,” Professor McGonagall called, drawing the attention of two identical red-headed boys.
Harry thought.
“Well you like Quidditch too, Millicent,” Harry diverted. “Why don’t you try out?”
Harry smirked. Weasley’s face was red and his eyes hot with anger as he turned.
“Hagrid-”
with Blaise that made Harry want to grin in amusement.
The missing four arrived not long after – and they brought a gift.
Then they bowed extravagantly, and were gone.
“O’ course! And just ‘agrid’s fine, for you three!” Hagrid beamed at them, and ushered them inside.
“I’m sorry I can’t stay with you, Harry,” Neville shifted guiltily. “But my gran – she really doesn’t like being alone at Christmas, you know, and she thinks it’s disgraceful for me to stay, so-”
“Don’t worry,” Draco told her, slinging his bag over one shoulder with a glare back in Harry’s direction. “I was just leaving.”
He turned, and there was Draco, holding the door open and gesturing wildly. Harry made one last loop before pushing all of his speed towards the open door. Draco slammed it shut behind him, and the sound of hundreds of keys slamming into tough wood echoed in the air.
. I just thought I should read ahead seeing as I’ve already finished this year’s books, and-” she went quiet, biting her lip uncertainly.
filthy down here.”
Theo looked at him. His eyes gave away nothing, but he nodded, and that combined with Hermione’s new (if probably temporary) carefree attitude was enough for Harry. He nodded back, and returned to his lunch.
“Sorry Pansy,” Blaise shrugged. “But I really couldn’t stomach it.”
Blaise frowned after her. “Harry, could you try asking the Chamber for stairs?”
Neville shuffled forward. “We’ll get Dumbledore,” he promised. “We’ll make them listen. They’ll come help, you’ll see.”
with us.”
Hermione hummed again. “What about the groundskeeper? Professor… Hagrid, was it?”
“It’s alright, Hermione, breathe,” Harry thought quickly, before taking a step closer to her so they wouldn’t be heard. “Okay. Meet on the third floor tonight, alright? You bring Neville – you have Herbology next, don’t you? – and I’ll bring Draco and Blaise.”
For a moment, Harry thought Tom Riddle was going to draw him a picture, but then the pages of the diary began to flutter wildly until coming to a stop with the words:
“Honestly, Pucey, do you think about
“Caught in the act,” Filch hissed as he shuffled towards Justin and the ghost. “I’ll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words…”
“Hadrian- um, Potter,” the boy stuttered. “What are you doing here?”
Lockhart chuckled nervously. “Well, you know- I must say, when I took the job, nothing in the description said-”
, Blaise, are not to talk to her unless absolutely necessary.”
Fred took a step forward. “I
“Of course not,” said Draco firmly, before his eyes softened. “I can only guess at how they treat you, Harry, but from what I’ve seen, and from how determined Mother is to get you out of there, I can imagine.”
Harry didn’t like where this was going. “What should blood matter?”
“I’m not going to Snape for anything,” Harry replied firmly.
“That’s exactly what I’ve been trying to tell him, Granger,” came a dry remark, and Harry used one hand to manoeuvre some of Hermione’s hair out of the way to reveal Blaise, exasperated but ever smirking.
Little Harry got no sleep that night, so focussed was he on practising with his new ability. He did not think up a name for this ability, but he very carefully avoided the word ‘
“But why would Potter want to attack Justin?”
“He’s waking up – quick, go get Madam Pomfrey!”
He sprinted away, chasing the voice through empty corridors and up a staircase, taking the steps three at a time before he skidded to a stop when he saw it.
A silent moment, and then: “And you definitely think Potter’s the Heir of Slytherin?” Abbot sounded uncertain.
“So, anyway, I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory. I mean to say, if Potter’s marked him down as his next victim, it’s best he keep a low profile for a week.”
The doorbell rung, cutting off Petunia’s reassurance, and Vernon shoved Harry roughly towards the stairs.
“Mr Potter.”
She stormed over to her sister with the appearance of a mother hen fussing over her chicks.
Neville brushed past him to sit next to Hermione, settling a book entitled
“Did you hear that, Harry?” The other boy practically jumped on him once Adrian had left. “He wants me to try for the team!”
“He has a dog, actually.”
“Aragog’d never kill anyone! Never!”
“The walls,” Harry breathed. The voice was coming from the walls.
Hermione flushed. “It’s not mentioned in
– not at the basilisk bearing down upon him, but at Salazar’s statue. The stone exploded into massive raining pieces and Harry aimed at one such slab, opening his mouth to cast again-
“Freshly caught Cornish pixies!” Lockhart corrected triumphantly. “Devilish little tricksters. Let’s see what you make of them!”
“We have chess tournaments every time Mother throws one of her parties,” Draco explained half an hour later as they exited the room. Harry couldn’t quite clear his mind’s eye of the image of the black side, left decimated behind them. “It’s led to quite the skill, don’t you think?”
“I need you lo’ to no’ say anythin’ abou’ this, alrigh’? Just, keep it our secret.”
“Draco, would you mind bringing us some tea, please?” Narcissa said suddenly, turning to her son.
“He’s a Parseltongue,” Weasley spat.
“Oh that it is so typical,” Pansy grumbled. “Right on my first adventure…”
“So it’s true then?” Draco scoffed. “Everything in your books is a lie.”
“Of course not,” Draco glared at him. “I just think there’s no need to go back there, don’t you?”
“Myrtle?”
“We did, sort of,” Harry glanced at Draco. “Hagrid definitely didn’t open the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago, so Fudge has arrested the wrong man. And it’s not an Acromantula committing these attacks, now or back then – it’s something the Acromantulas are scared of.”
The spiders went quiet.
“So, Potter,” Blaise slid his hands into his pockets. “What do you say?”
’s Bestseller List – he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving with my entire collected works – free of charge!”
The minor interaction with the groundskeeper had, despite Harry’s irritation at the interruption of his vaguely murderous thoughts, lifted Harry’s mood a little. He walked slower, no longer aiming for the dungeons but directionless.
Snape picked on the Gryffindors relentlessly, taking points for the smallest of errors and giving the Slytherins points at every opportunity. He never took points from Harry – because of his House, no doubt – but constantly berated him like he was dressed in red and gold rather than green and silver.
“Well I’m going back to the Common Room,” said Daphne, clearing her things from the table. “I need to check if Astoria is alright. But if only a few of you went…”
Harry smiled. It was a confident but unfriendly thing. “No it isn’t.”
Harry raised an eyebrow. “What’s wrong with Hermione?”
The diversion worked; Draco gave a loud scoff and instantly began to defend himself. “Of course I’m not scared,
The sight awaiting him below Salazar’s statue froze Harry’s heart in his chest. One of the twins was clutching at an arm, hanging useless and bleeding by their side, and the other was on one knee, clutching his stomach. Even at sixteen, Lord Voldemort was viciously powerful, and this one couldn’t be hurt.
“But who’s to say it’s the same creature now as it was back then?” Draco pointed out. “An Acromantula is perfectly capable of killing someone; maybe that’s what it did fifty years ago, and now it’s something different.”
That, of course, is when he decided to release said pixies, and subsequently, when it all went to Hell.
Petunia’s wide, frightened eyes dropped to the floor. Her hands shook. “Yes,” she whispered.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry drifted into consciousness slowly. The more sleep slipped from his mind, the more apparent it became that Harry’s bed was oddly uncomfortable. And he was cold – the Manor was never cold.
Gemma nodded respectfully, but Snape was already continuing.
But Harry was gone, with Neville Longbottom hot on his heels.
Harry was only half paying attention to Daphne’s show. He couldn’t help but need to remind himself, over and over as he looked at Hermione and Theo, that they weren’t actually dead. They just looked so still and pale, and their skin was so cold…
Dumbledore leaned forward to pat his knee gently. “Yes, Hadrian. It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark.”
“And your conclusion?”
“No one asked for your input, Weasley,” drawled Blaise at the same time.
The year is done.
“Oh my God,” Hermione breathed.
the Hat asked. It sounded amused.
“Oh – I didn’t really want to go home to my relatives,” Harry told him, rather awkwardly. “I thought I should experience Christmas at Hogwarts, is all.”
Blaise just snorted. “Yeah, that’s what I thought.”
“No survival instincts,” he heard Draco mutter behind him, but he was rather distracted as the moment he hopped onto the broom every single key in the damn room changed course to aim in exactly the opposite direction to him.
Dudley frowned. “I thought he got the second bedroom because Mum was afraid he’d turn us into dung beetles if you put him back in the cupboard.”
Harry entered the Potions classroom already on edge. He sat at a table with Blaise, behind Pansy and Draco on the left side of the room. The other first year Slytherins followed suit, and the Gryffindors filed into the right. Ron Weasley gave Harry a scowl as he passed. Draco scowled right back, but Harry ignored it. He had bigger problems – namely, Professor Severus Snape.
“No,” said Fred. “Not if-”
“She didn’t look where she was going,” Millicent grumbled.
I'm sorry it's been a while! Be expecting another chapter or two up tonight though - I just got back from a birthday party and I'm in the mood for writing.
“Who said the Heir is a ‘he’?” Daphne arched a brow.
“Some taken on his behalf, Malfoy,” Hermione cut in disapprovingly, while Neville shifted awkwardly at her side.
“He’s all we’ve got,” Harry replied. “Are you ready?”
“No, sir,” Dobby wrung his hands. “Master Draco doesn’t know Dobby has come. None of them do, but Dobby had to warn Mr Potter.”
“Isn’t he beau’iful?” Hagrid leaned over the table, rubbing one large finger over the baby dragon’s head. “Norwegian Ridgeback, ‘e is. Named ‘im Norbert.”
Harry was confused. He could think of one man whose voice that may be, but where was he? He got his answer when Quirrell finished unwrapping his large purple turban, revealing-
Harry laughed at her version of congratulations, and turned back to where Pansy and Millicent were in yet another argument about nicknames. Around the table, Daphne was explaining witches’ fashion to an amused Blaise; Tracey and Theodore were exchanging lists of books for the other to read; Vince and Greg were attempting to shovel as much food into their mouths as possible before they had to leave for the train; and Draco was-
Draco paused. “Come back to me. Us. I- I meant us.” He swore under his breath. “Just- come back, okay, idiot?”
“How is the Hufflepuff bestie by the way?” Millicent asked, picking up a protesting Sabre once again. “Did you find out anything about her?”
had he done that? He’d never done anything like that before, not really, and Harry suddenly felt very small, looking at what his magic had done.
Harry winced at the light, but cracked his eyes further open. A slightly harried looking woman was standing above him, with greying hair and a white matron’s hat.
Harry shook his head. He couldn’t speak. Neville was crying, somewhere, behind him, at the foot of Hermione’s bed. At the feet of her corpse-
“Well, Mr Potter, let me give you a clue. The happiest man on Earth would look into that mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.”
The groundskeeper lifted the crossbow again – a little callously for either boy’s liking. “Oh, nothing. Nothing. I’ve been expecting… Ah, doesn’t matter. Come in, sit down, I’ll make tea…”
Blaise pursed his lips in amusement at the door Ron had so quickly escaped through. “How long do you reckon that’ll last?”
“Unlikely,” Hermione shook her head. “Seven is a significant number. Seven potions, seven rooms. It’s lucky for a reason, Harry.”
Pansy squinted at him from her new spot on the floor. “How do you know this stuff?”
“I can take care of myself.”
“You’ll be coming with us today,” Uncle Vernon growled, in such a way that Harry thought for a moment he was in physical pain. “So no
Ron just sneered at her in response.
Harry stepped up to Draco’s side, Blaise moving next to Harry and the other Slytherins falling in line.
“Just tell me why you’re here,” Harry sighed.
“The monster is a basilisk?” Ron furrowed his brow at them while the twins moved forward to investigate the sinks. “How do you know?”
“Sorry.”
A scuttling sound as a myriad of legs moved forward, and then-
“Is she in there? Is she okay? How is she-”
“We don’t know,” said Hermione. “But it’s something to do with a Nicholas Flamel. And the problem is I
Harry Potter did not consider himself particularly adept at giving comfort, yet everything in him felt, at this moment, desperate to try. Perched carefully atop an expensive chaise within Draco’s bedroom (the luxury of the Manor still uncomfortably foreign to him, despite several weeks within its walls), Harry watched as his best friend rearranged his robes for the hundredth time that morning.
“Oh you’ve got to be joking,” Draco said suddenly.
Those sombre words silenced the table, until Harry sighed. “It doesn’t really matter right now though, does it?”
Harry has been through a lot, in canon and in the additions of this story, so he's really not in a great place right now. But his friends are helping him!
Pansy shook her head. “And what are we supposed to do about that?”
Daphne leaned forward with an eager smile. “Oh no, she isn’t. And even better, rumour has it Snape is going to ‘help him with the demonstration’.”
Draco looked ecstatic at being talked to by Slytherin’s best chaser and the future captain of the Quidditch team, but he tried to keep his cool. “Yeah. My father said if I get on the team, he’ll get us new brooms – Nimbus 2001s, for every player!”
The dazzling scarlet light of the disarming charm exploded from Snape’s wand, crashing into Lockhart and blasting him off his feet and into the far wall.
“Yes,” she said, finally. She cleared her throat. “Yes, we spoke about it. I must have forgotten.”
“Love, Hadrian. It is love.” He stood then, and moved over to the table of sweets. “Ah! Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee…” He tossed the sweet in his mouth and chewed thoughtfully. “Mm. Alas. Earwax.”
“Cornelius Fudge,” Draco breathed. Harry recognised him from the
“That I don’t know.”
Someone – likely Draco – was scrabbling at the smaller rocks between them. “Harry! Where are you?”
Harry knew, with an abrupt certainty, that no matter Draco’s decision, it would all work out. Everything would be alright. That confidence, it seemed, came directly from the warmth of Draco’s palm against his own, and he hoped – with another squeeze of his fingers – that he could offer even a fraction of that same comfort in return.
“Many do, Miss Farley, but no.”
“Deal,” he told the twins.
He echoed, mockingly. “Well I don’t know, Harry, I had to watch my best friend waltz off to face Salazar Slytherin’s massive, deadly pet and then when I finally manage to get to him, he’s gone and gotten himself bitten by said deadly pet, a bite which is
The polite answer caught Professor Snape off guard, but he quickly recovered. “Tonight, in my classroom.”
“Not to worry, Harry, my boy,” the old wizard said, with a twinkle in his eye. “Fawkes has been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on burning day – he’s really very handsome most of the time.”
Harry pushed himself shakily to his feet, Draco supporting him on one side. “What do you mean? What was that
“It’s blinded Harry, run!” one of the twins shouted.
Harry looked at him. “You guys are amazing,” he said genuinely.
Anyway, thank you for sticking with me and I hope you like the chapter. Next one will be less emotional. I think.
There was a large mirror in the room, with a muddled engraving on the high arch – but it wasn’t the engraving Harry was distracted by.
“About the school as well?” A look of fear flashed across Tom Riddle’s face, gone as soon as it came. “They wouldn’t really close Hogwarts, would they, Professor?”
Harry let his head fall back, panting. He could see a crowd rushing toward him, and groaned. Hermione reached him first, and he realised suddenly that it was her spell that stopped the Bludger.
Tracey blinked at him, her step faltering a moment. “You don’t- Oh.” She flushed. “Sorry. The Peverells are – or, were – a great wizarding family, and the three earliest known wizards are believed to be those in
Harry smiled to himself, and looked back to the sky. Perhaps she would be his second friend?
“So we’re all friends again, then?” Daphne asked, raising one eyebrow once the group was settled into the library.
Tracey started laughing at him as soon as the door closed behind them.
Petunia opened and closed her mouth several times, but finally seemed to give up on finding a way out of the situation. She took the letter from Harry’s hand with carefully pinched forefinger and thumb, holding it between her nails like it was about to explode. Harry stayed where he was.
“The pleasure is all ours,” the twins said in unison, and bowed simultaneously.
“You don’t think much of him then?” Blaise asked her with a hint of a smirk.
“And how would you know?” Blaise drawled.
Draco stomped his foot. “For Merlin’s sake, Harry, I am not going to let you get yourself killed like a bloody Gryffindor!” He exhaled, all at once, and then said, “You’re my best friend.”
Harry turned just quickly enough – which was still rather slowly – to get a mouthful of wild brown hair and a
Harry caught the twins exchanging a look above his head, but he pretended not to notice. Even if all three of them survived this, there was no telling in what state Fred and George would find their sister. Loneliness panged at him again, but he shoved it down.
“But it’s still a bit of a stretch, isn’t it?” Neville looked up worriedly. “I mean, we don’t even know if the thing was moved to Hogwarts.”
going. Mother and I would invite you to the Manor in a heartbeat, but my father…” The statement needed no ending.
Millicent wrinkled her nose.
“Wands at the ready!” Lockhart called. “When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent –
“I’m a Gryffindor,” Neville shrugged. “I should act like one.” And with that, he jumped down.
“Yes, thank you, Daphne,” Harry said, and let himself smile.
She lifted a small potted plant onto the bench in front of her, took a deep breath, grabbed the plant’s tufted top, flexed her fingers and
“Are you alright, Hagrid?” Harry questioned, once they were away from the sadistic caretaker.
“And after-”
“Aw, ‘e knows ‘is mummy!”
“Never mind that,” said Blaise. “You’re leaving.” His tone left no room for argument.
“No, Professor,” he said, and left as soon as he was dismissed.
“Evening, Hagrid.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s fine, Neville, really.”
“Oh, brilliant!” Hermione beamed at the note in her hand, found on the table of the sixth room along with seven bottles of varying shapes and sizes. “This isn’t magic – it’s logic – a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever. See here – we’ve been given clues.”
By the time she was finished she seemed quite out of breath, and her freckled face was blazing redder than her hair.
“’Our’,” echoed Draco, alarmed eyes flicking around the shadows of the clearing, but Harry wasn’t listening.
“I honestly wonder why you aren’t in Gryffindor sometimes, Potter,” said Blaise.
A cheer shook Harry from his sudden onset of self-loathing, and he jumped.
Harry’s throat tightened. He nodded again.
bit frightening?”
Harry shook his head, and forced back the rush of nausea the motion caused.
“Really we should be asking you-”
Blaise shook his head. “And what if he doesn’t listen? We’re just a bunch of kids, remember. Besides, the Stone can’t
There was the sound of something knocking over as his elbow hit it, following by the splat of liquid. Harry cursed, scrambling to put his glasses back on, but he already knew what had happened. The ink spilled out of its pot slowly after the first cascade, the diary’s crisp pages now black.
Harry just put a hand against the wall and tried to catch his breath.
“Ain’t it?” Hagrid beamed.
“Actually, I think it’s a very sensible idea,” said Theodore Nott – the first words he had said all evening.
“Is that…” Draco cut himself off with a gasp.
Alternatively: Someone please give Harry a hug.
Longbottom’s eyes widened rather comically as Harry approached his bedside. It appeared he hadn’t been expecting anyone – true to Harry’s observations – let alone the Boy Who Lived.
Hermione began packing up her remaining books with a huff. “I hardly think hair and robes are the biggest problems right now.”
Harry raised his hands in surrender. “Alright, alright!”
Somewhere to Harry’s left he heard someone snicker – Pansy most likely, knowing the competitiveness both Harry and Draco harboured – but he tuned it out.
“He can answer for himself, Blaise.”
Harry shook his head. “Wait, who is Sirius Black? And why would he be coming after me?”
“You’re a fraud.” Harry’s jaw was tight.
Millicent smirked. “Lockhart.”
Weasley hesitated. “And how do you even know where the Chamber of Secrets is, if you aren’t the Heir of Slytherin?”
“What-”
“It’s amazing, Draco, thank you,” Harry was too happy to be snarky. “Did you like mine?”
“Oh, I don’t know, maybe the fact that we were just
“Can this not wait, Miss…?”
“Her name is Ginny,” said Probably-Fred.
“What voice?”
Harry was lost in thought all the way back to the Slytherin Common Room. Gemma seemed to understand, as she didn’t attempt to start a conversation. Rather, she simply walked by Harry’s side in silence, with one hand brushing his arm as he thought, and thought, and thought.
Draco scoffed. “Sure, Weasley, but who in Merlin’s name is enough of an idiot to agree to this?”
Harry blinked. “Okay. Sorry.”
Harry flushed. “I won’t go on my own. Draco will come, won’t you Draco?”
Harry was fully intending on ignoring the clear summons and rushing out of the store as fast as he could, but of course that would have been too good to be true. A reporter with a shiny
Harry waited until it left, and then waited until he couldn’t bear to wait anymore before he inched back towards the faint sound of spellcasting.
Pansy was throwing small pebbles at a sullen looking Lockhart, wand lazily aimed at his chest, when the rest of the group reached the bottom.
Harry looked from the broom, to Hermione, and back again, before shrugging. It
That seemed to do the trick. When Harry met the Headmaster’s eyes again, Dumbledore was smiling warmly at him, and the twinkle was back in full force.
“Daphne!” Harry snapped.
Harry thought of Hermione’s love of explaining and teaching, regardless of the student, and nearly smiled. “I have someone in mind. She’ll come to you. Now, do we have a deal?”
Harry met up with Hermione, Draco, and Blaise later that evening. It had taken a lot of convincing to get Draco to even
“Oh no,” Tracey groaned. “Myrtle’s flooded the bathroom again.”
Harry gave her a small smile in return. She was very pretty, with dark skin and a smattering of lighter freckles across her nose, and she stood at only a few inches taller than Draco. Despite her unthreatening appearance, however, there was a glint in her dark eyes that told Harry to do everything he could to stay on her good side.
“Severus!” Madam Pomfrey looked displeased. “The boy did nothing wrong.”
“Thank you guys,” Harry said. “All of you, really.”
“Don’t get sappy on us, Potter,” Blaise raised one eyebrow.
“And some of us like both,” said Pansy, linking her arm with Millicent’s and grinning cheekily. Millicent shook her head, but allowed the contact. “Besides, Anthony Goldstein’s not bad, right Daph?”
“Uh…”
“A bloody lot of good, if it’s a two hundred foot drop onto jagged rocks,” muttered Ron.
“If you ever dare to speak about my parents again,” he said, calmly, quietly. “I will make sure that it is the last thing you ever say.”
“It was under the table,” Harry shrugged apologetically. “You guys go ahead, I’ll catch up.”
The corridors were empty and shadowed with the students off at dinner. Harry kept his footsteps as quiet as possible against the stone and listened carefully.
considered Snape, but still. He didn’t appreciate being fooled so easily. “So it was you the whole time, then? What about Halloween?”
Draco looked at him like he was stupid, and Harry felt his own blood boil. “Harry, blood is
“I was crying, and I heard somebody come in.”
Longbottom was flushed with embarrassment. “Thank you,” he said awkwardly.
Blaise patted him on the shoulder with one hand and ran the other over his shaven head. “I know.”
Blaise snickered and lounged further back in his chair, but Draco was not deterred.
Finally, Draco said, “Go on, then.”
Harry didn’t get to catch up with either of his other friends until the next day. The second year was kicking off with a double Herbology period, which the Slytherins and Gryffindors shared, so Harry made sure to grab a seat next to Neville. Draco grimaced behind him, but sat down on his other side anyway.
“Well,” Daphne flicked her hair over her shoulder and tugged the still silent Astoria a little closer to her side. “Come on, then.”
“And my dad was really grateful for the photo of you, I’ve been telling him all about you, but could we get one of both of us because he really wants to see me with a celebrity you know, and-”
Harry narrowed his eyes. “Isn’t that a bit dangerous?”
Myrtle sniffed, floating a little higher into the air. “Don’t ask me. Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it’s funny to throw a book at me!”
“I don’t understand why you’re so upset, nothing happened!”
“Well it depends, see,” said George, uncharacteristically sombre.
Harry didn’t really hear him. That was another reason he hated crowds – he didn’t like being touched, not by adults and especially not by strangers. Gilderoy Lockhart’s hand was warm where it clutched at his shoulder and his robes smelled like too much expensive cologne and he
Blaise just shrugged. “Maybe.”
“Having friends,” Harry said, closing his eyes and remembering the warmth of Gemma’s hug, of Blaise’s fond annoyance and Hermione’s anxious parting look. He thought of Pansy and Daphne’s dramatics, and the pressure of Draco’s hand in his. “I haven’t really had friends before.”
“Et tu, Tracey?” Blaise raised an eyebrow, amused.
Harry visits Hagrid again, and makes a deal with the twins.
Myrtle huffed. “Well, I don’t know! I was distraught! But they said something funny – some kind of made-up language, and I realised it was a boy speaking, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away… and I died.”
Harry had indeed read about it, and agreed that it was fascinating, but he wanted to experience the
“What’s wrong,
I dragged the top edges of my teeth over the wobbling flesh of my bottom lip, catching the skin and digging my teeth into the curve of my lip to drag it into my mouth in a nervous habit of mine.
People here often called me “the cold prince” and I didn’t care. It made them stay clear of me. I didn’t need someone to bother me anyway. I liked keeping to myself even when inside I wanted to just give it all up.
of the elevator as the metallic doors slid open to reveal a floor filled with cubicles, computer, desks and workers hunched over their work area. They were all either scribbling down on a variety of paperwork, typed on their keyboards, or talked animatedly over their assigned business phones.
Still.
Bringing my startled pale gaze over to the towering form of my cousin's standing in the entrance of my bathroom, I let the narrow of my eyes turn into harsh slits as I tried to gesticulate how annoyed I was at almost everything, especially the unwanted abrupt scare I just got. Sirius had on the same clothes from this morning, but his mussed hair was even more messy than before. “Next time please knock? I’d appreciate that a lot, thank you. And where were you this morning? I came out to eat breakfast to find that both you and Caetia weren’t even there.”
Harry touching me for years.
I stood my ground, my body feeling the heavy weight of both the Gryffindors’ attention, my skin prickling with heated anxious anticipation as I tried to calm the racing of my heart down and keep my cool while having every male at the table watch mine, Neville’s and Harry’s interaction.
And I wanted to
“My turn,” Harry’s voice rumbled within my chest, making me suck in a sharp breath at the voracious sound he released, his eyelids lifting open to reveal the illuminate sheen of his contrasting colored eyes, “what’s your favorite color?”
And felt like a complete idiot doing so.
I didn’t even know this man and he expected me to take his words to heart? What’s this about warning me of something that was significantly wrong for me? Instead of it being “something”, what if it turned out to be “someone” instead? I barely knew anyone anymore. No one seemed to want to be anywhere near me let alone want anything to do with me, so how could I be in danger if I didn’t associate myself with anyone.
Harry looked like he was in the muggle part of the world.
“Ah, well, that’d have to be green. The crystalline kind. In depth and strikingly calming to the eye.” I answered Harry’s question with a small lilt in my voice, a tiny smile tracing the curl of my mouth as I let my fingers run down the length of Harry’s cheekbone to the underside of his jaw, slipping them through the thick locks of his dark hair at the nape of his neck, playing with the short hairs there.
After I had passed out from the demon taking my magic and energy, I woke up to the sound of screaming.
Fuck. Me.
The clawed tips of the demon's charred fingers snipped against my skin with a harsh mockery as I felt all the blood drain from my face the instant the creature opened up the maw of it's mouth to reveal the transformation of his normal human-like-teeth turning into razor sharp points that was similar to a row of serrated knives.
I gave a raise of my brow towards Hezian. “If I didn’t cooperate, I think I wouldn’t be coming out of this place alive. So no need to thank me. You can do that when I see Animadverto eradicated. And then I’ll give you my gratitude once I know I won’t end up in a ditch somewhere.”
I'd follow Harry Potter anywhere. And he'd do the same for me.
“You were taking too long,
And Harry damn well deserved to be around people that cared and was there for him through thick and thin. It was time for the Assassin to make amends with Hermione and Ron.
Both my hands were pinned down above my head with Harry’s right hand.
The Gryffindor, too out of it to even notice what was happening, easily inhaled the potion’s smoke through his nose, the disturbingly lifeless dulled colors in his dazed eyes staring at me with confusion and weariness right before he fell forward with his eyes shutting closed closely after, bringing me down with him as I gasped out in shock when I felt my back smack against the floor.
“I-I … there’s so much happening. I can’t
It was because of my history that people would think that I murdered Jazine and Trisko so easily.
The Gryffindor let out a hum, contemplative and rumbling like the crashing of rolling waves against the most Onyx of rocks. The hand curved around my bare arse pulled me up the wall with effortless ease, dragging me up the length of the flat surface even more so than I already had been to cause my feet to dangle below me, my broken cry of surprise and azure flecked fire gathering in my groin.
All these people were going to see Draco’s arse moving about in synchronization with the sultry music heavily pounding against his pale skin. People were going to ogle at the way Draco’s long legs would be skimmed with a wet sheen while that shoulder length, soft white hair of his got more mussed from moving around too much.
“You don’t get to come. But you will come with me to my place and have a long talk.” Harry’s voice was devoid of any emotion, monotonous in contrast to the terrifying cruelty lying dormant underneath the eerie calm of his facade.
Finalling rounding a block, I walked up to the front, large steel doors that belonged to the famous nightclub.
Clutching the envelope into my chest, I had to reach out my other hand to feel the cool wall against the pad of my fingertips so I could have something to give me a sense of grounding, the way down too dark for me to see anything except the edges of one step to the next as I trudged my way down for a good five minutes before reaching the end of the stairs and into an enormous room clad in burgundy colored stoned walls. The place was bigger than the level upstairs that I recently vacated.
I felt
. Do as I say.” The assassin’s voice was hard and wicked, a pure demand that pulled my insides every which way. The sound of my name dipped in the low rasp of Harry’s voice caused my head to be brought up, the collar comfortable but a sensible presence around my throat as I trailed my gaze up the length of Harry’s fitted form and let out a keening, stressed noise as I tipped my head back.
of one’s essence as well, all because it gives the dark magic more power. And if Harry
And I hoped to be kept as the “unknown” target throughout this endeavor of mine.
Panic and warmed anticipation burned down the line of my dry throat as I swallowed around a lump of anxiety, embarrassment clouding my senses as I seemed to have now noticed the levity of Harry going back to stage, knowing damn well that people out in the crowd were watching this debacle as I writhed in frustrated affrontation over the Chosen One’s shoulder.
My cock wasn’t going down though.
I felt my whole body start to seize, mouth growing slack as my head lolled backwards but was stopped in its floppy motion from Zereth’s other massive hand holding it up quickly. The entire frame of my figure felt frail, the dead weight of my suspended body causing my wrists to twitch from the trauma of the cuffs and the chains holding me up attached to them.
Drawing the plump of my bottom lip into the moist of my mouth so I could nibble absentmindedly on it, I chewed over the flesh as I fell into step beside Harry while we both trodded after Kevera, following his short stature through the left long golden corridor where everything lay barren except for the polished floors, walls, and steel trimmed safes with the large wheels attached to their fronts in an ominous fixture.
Harry was watching me made my cock threaten to rise beneath the onslaught of my tight boyshorts, chest shuddering out a trembling breath as I couldn’t help but bring my low lidded gaze up to meet the Assassin’s.
I was unsettled with how my body reacted to Harry even when he was a completely different person. It was the simple fact that the unknown man next to me was actually Erus with a new identity and it went to show how powerful his magic was for him to make his glamor so flawless.
I started to huff and puff, hissing through clenched teeth right at the moment the Gryffindor stopped to stand right in front of the chair, my heart hammering wildly while I tried to wriggle my way out of Harry’s tight grip around my lower back.
Huffing out an exasperated breath, I made my trek towards Pansy’s bed with a dramatic flair, having stuck my nose up into the air with my lips quirking further to reveal a haughty prominence upon my face as I tossed my tailored, buttoned up white top off of my torso to pick up the big dark green thin sweater off of the neatly made bed my friend sat on and slipped it on.
“I-I’m not, why would you-what is-that w-was unnecessary!” My voice was ridiculously high in my screech of astonishment and shame, my eyes large as my brows furrowed in agitated heat.
After eating and drinking a large amount of water, I had wandered off back into the room I declared my own to look through the shopping bags for some pajamas. The clothes that Granger chose were rather exposing compared to the ones I had at home and different from my regular taste, but I was grateful nonetheless and knew that shopping tomorrow for my own clothes will do me some good.
I couldn’t believe that I fell for the kicked-puppy look he just gave me. He went out of his way to make me jealous and get all sorts of riled up because I didn’t verbally tell him that I thought he looked so fucking good tonight that I wanted to have him on top of me and inside of me the instant I saw him in his outfit.
got time alone together without having to run for our lives or do a job constantly.
I do get snappy once in a while whenever my coworkers decide to think that they could push me around by ordering me to do their work just because I wasn’t the favorite here in the company.
on him, specifically an engraved one that would give me his whereabouts by trailing a strand of his energy that he left behind wherever he went. Although I was the only one that could follow that trail and no one else since I had the power to see his souls energy, a thin veil of it at least.
But Harry’s voice coaxed me to disregard the warning in the back of my head to stay away from this man, alluring and inescapable.
If Harry and I were the only people moving, then that meant that Harry must have cast a spell that inquisitively stopped the time lapse of each individual person.
“Here’s another question. Why are you so mean t-to me sometimes!” I breathed out rapidly, the fucking fork fumbling about in my prying fingers as I finally grabbed a hold of it. An exhalation of relief poured out of my mouth as I knelt back up with the fork in my hand, clutched tight.
Shutting the gape of my mouth with a click of my teeth slamming together in an annoyed yet exhilarated countenance, I felt the beating of my heart kick up a notch as I replayed Harry’s words in my head.
for a man that has driven me off the wall with frustrated, saddened, psychotic, need.

“Well well well, is Kitten hungry?” Harry raised a brow up at me in dark chastisement, his voice releasing an entertained tone.

Let go, let go letgoletgoletgo!” My voice came out in angered hysteria, the strands of my hair in disarray and whipping across the pale of my cheeks as I shook my head back and forth like some deranged psychopath as I threw a
I don’t want this! Make it stop!
.” The Gryffindor released a rumble of words down at me, his burning gaze peering down at me with heavy lids that made him look so damn sexual, lips tipping up to reveal a daunting vicious grin that made me whine at the sight of him, my cock pulsing faster with each fucked out thrust of Harry’s dick drilling into me.
Princess.” Harry grumbled his low words into my left ear as he took my earlobe with the clench of his teeth clamping over the sensitive flesh there and gave it a biting scrape as he sucked it into the slick warmth of his mouth, his sinful tongue teasing along the skin and making my lower half convulse on the spot from the light-headed heated sensation.
I gaped at the place that I could see through the portal.
Dangerous.
Harry let out a contemplative hum, husked and deep, his burning eyes watching me for a good few silent seconds before I released a squawk of surprise when I felt his hips thrust up minutely in a quick manner, causing my body to bounce up and down across his lap.
Pansy and I both jolted on the spot, my body stilling in a sort of instinctual action whenever there was sudden disruption to my surroundings.
My brain sort of short circuited in the confines of my head, throbbing with an electricity fueled energized high that made a flourish of soft cherry red spill out over my cheeks and the part of my lips opening wider into a surprised “O” as my jaw went slack at its hinges.
him.” Weasley spoke in a deep undertone of unsettled fixation, murmuring out his words all the while as he stared on at the man in a look of subtle horror.
Arrogant, son of a bitch.
that spread out over both my arse cheeks from Harry’s slap.
The man decided to show up and get me about two hours after Potter left my ass in this dark room. I could tell how Weasley and Potter were friends. Both were bastards that gave no regard for other people. Hell, did they not think that maybe I needed to go to the bathroom or drink water for the past two hours where I was left alone with no way out of this godsforsaken room? They’re lucky that I didn’t.
I had to.
I noticed the bags of clothes that Granger got me settled beside the foot of my bed and I planned to use whatever the redhead got me without any complaint. She seemed to know my sense of fashion, although the clothes weren’t as loose as I wanted them to be, but I couldn’t voice my thoughts on them since I didn’t want to attempt another shopping spree moment in fear of having someone be killed in front of me again.
My breaths stuttered out as my back was forced up against the wall, my legs wrapping instinctively around Harry’s narrowed defined hips. My stupid jeans hung off of one leg now, stuck on my boot as the fabric dangled and brushed against the ground, material caught on my foot. But I couldn’t have cared less.
Blinking profusely in a dizzied manner at the image of Harry literally disappearing from my sight like a fucking
I’ll most likely end up finding something, perhaps a leather jacket, to cover myself up more a little. But there was a surety about wearing Caetia's clothes to keep me mixed in with the crowd and not stick out too much.
It was basically my dream to be working with potions and with a high pay wage as well. And the fact that I would be working with Harry if I were to be sent to do on-field missions made it all the better.
And I had a feeling that despite the fact that I know Harry would be looking for me, my heart would shudder and quake beneath my rib cage from the sensation of being
” My voice snapped out in a feverish pitch when I felt he slick of Harry’s cock thrust into my hole with a primal severity, the tip of his hot prick having prodded expertly at my prostate.
I needed Potter out of this bathroom before I tried to do anything stupid like beg the man to spank me just like he threatened to do with me or attempt to slap my palm across his gorgeous face. The next words I spoke were rushed and trembling with rage and arousal, voice begrudging and pitching in high and low octaves consistently. “Yes. I Understand. I’ll behave.”
The assassin flashed me a devilish grin in return, showing me his clean white teeth and giving me a dimpled smile that made me want to roll around the bed in a fit of giddiness to rid myself of all this overwhelming happiness despite really not wanting to dispel how excited I was.
Harry had decided to look like sin himself in dark black trousers that fitted around the muscular toned shape of his powerful thighs and legs with a dark red button up long sleeve that materialized perfectly around his hard torso to show off the lean and strong shape of his triceps and biceps. The wide width of his muscled shoulders made me want to weep out of pure admiration and infatuation, his stance a tall erect posture that exuded lazy confidence that was both enthralling and intimidating.
Harry released my left asscheek to slap his free hand once again across my bum, palm colliding with my cheeks so viciously that it made my hips sway and jerk while my mouth dropped open to emit a breathy whimper. I felt the muscles in my thighs quiver from the strain of using them to attempt to hold myself up as Harry assaulted my asshole with his tongue in continuous strokes, his lips forming around the rim of it in a wet hot caress as he gave it a dirty kiss and a wet suck that almost had my eyes rolling to the back of my head.
And without a second of hesitation, my brain not even having enough time to catch up to what was happening, the man flicked his right hand out and brushed the skin of my forehead in a feather light touch with the pad of his middle fingertip.
tease.
Without magic.
But what I hated most right now was the whole existence of my life.
And I let out a hushed, quiet gasp as I rolled my hips in a figure eight motion over Harry’s prick, brushing my own with his and letting out a wail of restrained pleasure that I felt was just at the tip of my bursting coming.
I give you a chapter! Hope you guys enjoy. Next update will be next weekend or earlier depending on how the chapter goes for me. Ohhh, *rubs hands together* this is going to be good, and I'm going to enjoy making you guys curious as to what happens next, mwaha.
I fiddled with the hem of the plaid fabric of my mini skirt, the tips of my trembling fingers shifting restlessly across the downy material that waded around the upper soft skin of my shaking thighs. The fine silver sheen of the moon spilled across the gleaming jet black color scheme belonging to the Harley Davidson motorcycle perched in its dark glint of obsidian hue steel, the milky froth of the moon’s light catching the sleek, powerful, and dangerous machine.
? I thought these things only wanted to use me to do what they wanted.
, Erus, let me c-c-come!"
” Harry’s voice dropped into a sinister resonance, a violent tone trembling beneath the threatening fluctuation he emitted from the depth of his chest and throat.
I’ve seen it before.
Despite the absolute terror invading my system all at once, I couldn’t help but glare at the demon, clenching my jaw tight as the creature raised a dark brow at me.
My mouth parted in shock and shame.
“You run away from me like that again and I’ll show you physical discipline. This is a warning, don’t put yourself in danger like you did just now with that vampire. Next time you’ll be doing a lot more than watching someone die and screaming my name,
“Well what did you expect? I don’t like Cho and I knew you did that on purpose to get a rise out of me because you simply like getting under my skin just as much as I do with you,” I retorted, tone light except for the slight tremor in my breaths that I tried to keep steady with my nerves feeling frayed and my senses on high alert with the assassin.
something within itself and the atmosphere around me that something was going to happen, and soon.
I got my punishment in the end.
I felt Erus’ body shift into a walking motion, jostling my frame a bit from side to side as I practically melted and stuck myself against Harry’s hard front, arching my back so I could feel the harsh grip of Harry’s fingers embedding themselves into my bum's jean covered flesh, sagging against the assassin as all the energy seemed to be drained out of my skin and bones, leaving me frail and shaking as I repeated the words Harry spoke out to me just now in my head.
I found myself clutching my towel with the line of my back and arse smacking against the grey slate walls, the cool of the surface over my towel and the sudden stop of my retreating movements making me squeak out in a flush of crimson red.
The Assassin’s lips were heated, soft yet firm, moving sensually with mine as I whined into his mouth the moment Harry took a handful of my ass and forcefully made me rock my lower half over his own while he pressed his other hand’s palm against the back of my skull to bring me closer to his mouth.
When Harry inched his lips closer to Kikue’s exposed, slender neck, his gaze started to slide away from mine with a flash of that magnetizing sadistic shade of ruby turning into a drowning splurge of
And he held himself confident and detached. Even though he was fucking someone, he looked cruel with the way his face was set into a look of indifference, giving nothing away but hardness, like a wall has been built up around him and it was unbreakable. He emitted authority and strict power, strong and smothering in his presence, making those around him feel the need to obey his every demand from the way one could sense that there was something hidden beneath his cold countenance, as if waiting to be released and wreck havoc. He was like an impossible feat of an earthquake, quiet and dormant, but when something unhinges him, he becomes violent and ceaselessly dark.
Sorry it's been a while since I've posted a chapter for this story, but I've been busy with work and all and travelling too. This chapter is very informational and amusing at times, so hopefully you guys enjoy it as much I did writing it! Thank you for the patience, support and love for this story, it means the world to me.
Before I knew what I was doing, I had bitten down on the plush of my moist bottom lip, letting a desperate filthy noise to bubble out of my throat along with a subtle airy laugh, peeking out over my left shoulder to look up from beneath the pale of my lashes at the Gryffindor.
The Gryffindor’s cheeks were tinted with a light flush, as if he had been running for quite some time, heat slipping out of every pore of his flesh in rolling waves like the flares of the sun’s flames.
He tasted me with his lips and explored the caverns of my mouth with the wet flick of his hot tongue against my own, leaving me breathless and
Before I could even begin to fathom why Kingsley would be at the front door of my squalid studio apartment, I watched in dawning horror as the front door slammed open inwards, smacked against the wall of my room, and Kingsley came barging on in with a stern frown marking his face and his burly figure taking up a good amount of space as he practically smashed my door shut behind him.
And with a screech of Harry’s name snapping the silence of the mansion surrounding us with the occasional thunderous rumble, I watched the fly of Harry’s jeans zip down, and the waistband of his pants fall across the narrow of his defined hip bones to show the large, monstrous cock that jutted out in angry red and protruding veins that ran along the meaty girth of his horse hung dick.
Those two didn’t see me coming back at them in retaliation. Hah!
My mouth opened and closed, the purse of my moistened lips flapping soundlessly as the beating of my rapid heart caused the inner workings of my rib cage to rattle with its profound clatter against my chest, causing my throat to close up in on itself and leaving my voice quiet, my mouth speechless.
“Y-Yes. I want i-it,
You had a punishment coming to you the moment I watched you sob on the bathroom floor back in Hogwarts, so
Draco was
my head started to become a thunderous pounding.
Harry consumed my mouth whole.
flooded into the caverns of my head, thrumming alive with a wicked Stygian of energy that coated the insides of my skull and made my ears hum in the tingling of pain it was suddenly under, my features pinching together in hurt as the sensation
I barely heard the static sound of clapping and wolf whistles crescendo and descend in various resonations throughout the entirety of the room.
Harry expects me to stay here while he went out and had fun?
I needed to get the hell out here and give myself something to do.
The man had blacked out from the pain and was now left unconscious on the ground on his back.
“Well hello there, Draco Malfoy. It’s a surprise to see you wandering about here after so many years of having not seen a lick of you around,” The goblin, with a nametag on his pristine black suited vest spelling out "Kevera
I could see the man’s lips twitching, as if he was holding back a grin, causing my irritation with the situation to worsen, my anxiety bubbling higher beneath the confines of my skin as I tried to keep my breathing levelled and not start panicking from what I was hearing. “You’re smart. I’ll give you that. You’re a Malfoy with a lot of money. We want access to the Malfoy money that you don’t use to get one of my assassins a spot in Animadverto since they like their customers having a lot of money for their business and you, Mr. Malfoy, haven’t gone anywhere near what your family has left behind financially wise. So let us use your money, and you’ll have your protection.”
I gripped the fabric of the Gryffindor’'s shirt harder, tugging at the material and watching the way my knuckles strained a stark white against the onslaught of my skin with how tight of a grip I had on Harry’s shoulders, clawing my nails into his flesh and down the muscular jut of his shoulder blades as he towered over me and crowded the whole of my space.
Thanking the gods that Harry had decided to be nice and take out the butt plug and put a cleansing charm on me before he apparated me to the married couples place, I wiggled my bum comfortably across the floor of the warm living room happily, not having the strength not to get excited about how
Releasing my bottom lip immediately, I gave the whole room an uncanny curl of my mouth and tipped my head back to stick my nose up in the air, my eyes narrowed into a cold glare.
Most of the Slytherins, those who decided to come back to Hogwarts to finish their last year here including myself, were treated as outcasts, but there were rare occurrences regarding the other houses accepting some of the Slytherins.
I wasn’t alone anymore. And damn, did it feel good.
The shirt covered up my mark so I didn't have to worry about anyone catching sight of the emblem etched into my flesh.
Oh fucking hell.
of his, with my own filth, my own
I felt tears well up in my eyes out of frustration, my prick crying out in pain as it throbbed for release and my asshole quivered for more of Harry’s dick.
“Don’t let strangers into your place when you look like a whore. They may think you’re an open invitation to fuck, and we both know you’re a virgin. Wouldn’t want your precious virtue soiled so easily. Mother dearest would roll in her grave.” The Gryffindor’s statements had made my eyes widen in affronted shame, anger and astonishment.
me the way I want you! For fucksakes H-Harry, I’ve had this stupid crush on you ever since you saw me cry in that bathroom and f-f-flashed me a charming smile during my trial in the wizard court. W-Why do you want to know so much about what I’m thinking-g-g-g when you don’t even care about me!? You
I had started growing it out during my seventh year in Hogwarts for the sole purpose of having my fingers be able to fiddle with something whenever I was too stressed or nervous about whatever was weighing on my mind. My hair fell past my shoulders and reached the small of my back.
After a moment of dreaded silence in the room, Harry, as if finally deciding to come back to me, snapped his brilliant dewy grass green and inflamed eyes back to me, releasing a voice made up of no emotion and a frigid note that caused my own body to become taut with tension. “We’ve been compromised.”
The scent of Harry Potter and blood was evident and clear as I shifted over the Assassin’s shoulder and hissed venomous threats his way all the while I flailed my arms and legs about like some toddler throwing a tantrum, cheeks coated in a pink heated flush.
Fuck. I missed
I’m not a Slytherin for nothing. Sneaking is the epitome of what a Slytherin was, and I did great at it.
It carried an animalistic tremor in its sound, emitting a frequency that quaked in a screeching pitch of hungered delirious
Hezian didn’t seem to notice my weird behavior, his attention on Harry as he gave a nod to the Assassin to show his understanding of what Harry threatened him with and his gratification.
I didn't get the chance to grab a coat to cover myself up, which made me turn red from being watched by a large amount of both muggles and wizards.
Fuck me and punch into me the knowledge that I only belong to you. Want you touch me, to show me all your bad.
vicious possessiveness that I both wanted to run towards to and away from.
What the hell did I do to Draco to make him feel disconcerted?! Sure, I abruptly left him with Hezian and Cho but I trust them to not lay a single hand on what's mine, and they know not to.
We stayed like this for a while.
He had me. Whether he knew it or not, he had me for a while.
I was getting real tired of all this confusing shit though.
I loathed my want for him.
The sheets that were wrapped around me had fallen to the floor, covering Kingsley’s rotting body as I felt my own limbs start to wobble from its jelly like jitter, mind trying to understand what just happened.
I couldn’t.
I couldn’t help but roll my hips into the floor beneath me, my prick pressed hard against the surface as it throbbed in time to the ticking pulse of my fast heart beat that filtered through my ears and hummed lowly there, my body having a mind of its own as I bent further onto my belly and arched my arse up higher, wanton and bloody fucking
I stared, my eyes taking in the way the mahogany strands of the boy’s hair ruffled about like downy feathers as he smothered his lips against Harry’s cheek while slinking that short curvy, small frame of his against the assassin’s front and practically tried to stick himself to Harry like he wanted to become the Gryffindor's second skin.
tell me why my skin has some weird scripture and is fucking
But everyone seemed happy with my response and went about their way back to most likely feasting and chatting with each other as the surprise party commenced.
“No.” Harry’s words were blunt like the damn sharp edge of a knife, the brutal rigidity of his tone slicing through the tense air surrounding us with a deafening order that made my body both melt and tighten in the limbs from how monotonous the Gryddindor’s voice was, as if there was no emotion and only pure demand.
My breath felt
He looked
I laughed brokenly once the demon screeched like a dying animal at the way their hand melted away from their forearm, the skin sickeningly pulling apart from his appendage and bone marrow as it disintegrated morbidly from my flames.
Harry had only
But Zereth had clearly voiced that if I didn’t kill the man, it'd kill me. The goal was for me to take in enough energy into myself and make my dark magic get stronger so the demon could have a well fed meal of it's own.
I hopped off of my bed, making sure to have most of my body shielded from the Auror’s gaze as I gave him my own glower, cheeks hot and having no way to stop the flush of embarrassment from showing.
But I couldn’t do that to him.
I gave out a huff of air as I bit down on my moist bottom lip now and spoke around a petulant murmur, the breeze of the forest night sweeping across my figure, running up my naked thighs and in between them to flutter over my lace covered arse and prick, causing me to shift on my two feet to try and wriggle away the invading touch.  “Of
The friction was
Just watching.
This time, I cut off my cousin’s words with a confused, irritated snip out of my mouth. “You still didn’t answer my question as to how you were alive. And I don’t appreciate someone I don’t know coming into my room without my permission.”
I was going to look like a mess by the by time I got there.
“I am. Your place gives off a warm vibe. And ah … I gained some confidence wearing that provocative outfit at the club so I felt comfortable in it after wearing it for a bit,” I breathed out in a soft murmur.
My arousal was slowly going down, the realization about this being such an important aspect of a mission causing me to deter away from the heat that I felt to let me take into serious countenance of the things happening around me. I couldn’t get hot and bothered by Harry even though if I so much as looked at the Gryffindor, my cock would perk right back up in interest. I had to be a professional, like the assassin in front of me. This was all just so new and being around Harry was making the usual composure of mine and my emotions, go haywire.
up and back down from the Assassin’s harsh hit.
I visibly rolled my eyes, making sure that both Chang and Hezian saw how ridiculous and ludicrous I thought of the subject brought up at hand just now.
to catch up on any news I have for my stories, updates and inspirations.
enough with pushing me away. Give me your
Erus tugged my head back viciously, his other hand slamming down into the small of my back at the same time my arsehole quaked with terrifying need and a sudden slicked juice that massaged the inner walls of my hole, warm and tantalizing.
Sirius simply stared back at me for a good two minutes or so, the dark of his grey eyes watching the minute shift of my chest with every soft breath I took, observant.
Students were loitering around or chatting amongst each other, some in small or large groups as they cheered each other on in doing whatever dumb shite they were doing together while others vacated to themselves with a drink or smoke in their hands. Some were watching animatedly in interest at the others’ actions around them.
I don’t care how clean the floor looks, it’s still a ground that people walk on and leaves traces of filth the human eye can’t see. I could be sitting on germs right now.
Frowning back at myself, I twisted on my heel to make a fast walk out of my bathroom to the bag of clothes waiting for me to rummage through.
I’d never put Harry in any intentional harm and I had enough confidence in myself now to get us out of any sticky situation.
alluring as those red green eyes of his glowed within the shadowed hues of the night surrounding us while he stared me down. “You’ve got wit. You’re strong minded and stubborn, but endearing and beautiful in the silent strength you wear within and around your delicate body. You’re unpredictable, a curious little kitten that uses his claws when his buttons get pushed to the brink of his carefully constructed control. I like the challenge you bring. I like the way you act bitchy but in reality, are a sensitive being that really just wants everyone happy in their own way. So
Zereth’s face scrunched up in rage then, their features screwing together viciously as something harsh and sinister passed over their pinched face before they let out another roar of pain at the same time they whipped their outstretched right hand towards my head.
Harry must have noticed my struggle to say what he wanted me to from the way the Gryffindor let the pad of his thumb catch at the dip in the middle of his bottom lip, showing the gleaming white of his teeth in the obsidian of the hallway with a simple flick of the appendage, and letting out the smallest sound of a wicked snicker.
Harry was punishing me.
An ache formed where the teeth embedded themselves as I writhed under the man, eyes glazing over as Harry did four mind-numbing slaps across my bum, my cheeks flesh burning and most likely bruising and breaking at the skin, sobs spilling from my mouth as tears dragged themselves down my cheeks with every violent slap of Harry’s palm across my bum.
And Harry’s warmth was gone from behind me.
Krum let out a long sigh then, causing me to blink and turn my head away from Harry’s dark gaze to look back at the Bulgarian. “This club is my house as well. You’re currently underground but, since Harry has said I can’t tell you exactly where you are, I can’t tell you anymore of the place you’re in. I will tell you that this sex club has been running for over three years and is only available to the highest royalties in both muggle and wizard world. They come here specifically to have sex with anyone they want in the most kinkiest, dirtiest form they can imagine. The only rules here is that no one is to hurt someone without consent. This place is stacked with guards. I don’t want you wandering around because, well … you reek of virginity and are too pretty to
The Gryffindor let out a dark chuckle as he brought his head down to let the soft set of his lips drag down over the space behind my right ear and to where my neck met my shoulder, a quiver shaking my body as he grumbled into the flesh there, loud enough for my ears to pick up. “You know your safe word?”
I had to admit.
I thought I was out of my mind, so at times I tried to kill myself. I thought that the world didn’t need someone having so much power carry around such a screwed up cadence inside themselves. I was dangerous. And people would get hurt sooner or later from my very doing, I thought.
In sexual terms, I loved giving the reins to someone else and being fucked within an inch of my life, I love taking cock and being manhandled. Took complete pleasure in it because I can be free of the mask I had to put on every day of my life, which is always stressing. But I have never let anyone have that sort of control over me since the men who fucked me because I haven’t had sex from that time and on. They didn’t give me the aftercare that I craved. And I feared letting anyone in to see me in such a vulnerable state again.

me, pressing against my prostate with malevolent accuracy while I started to claw my fingers into the ledge behind me with a fever pitch.
READ THIS: I'll be posting this weekend on Sunday, early or later in that day, so yay!
The repressed feelings that I’d hidden for all these years were finally bursting forth. And I had no way to stop it.
The Gryffindor rolled his eyes at me, letting out a “tsk” in reprimand. “I’ve been experimented on with potions before, kind of had to as a test to become an agent here, to see how much your body can handle and how you yourself can get out of the situation the potion put yourself in. So I really don’t mind you testing your potions on me.”
My breath stuttered in my lungs as I gazed out at the person blending in with the darkness.
Wisixi Podge was one of the most dangerous cities in the wizard world, cluttered with all sorts of supernatural beings that all tried to get along but most of the time failed doing so. The city was huge, a place that took solace a few miles away from Spinner’s End with its modern like buildings that towered and loomed. Werewolves, vampires, veelas, and a whole bunch of other creatures resided here. Wisixi wasn’t a poor place either, containing supernaturals of high riches who were worse than regular rogue creatures.
” Harry’s voice came out in that low timbre of a tone of his, vibrating the inner workings of my chest as I gasped into Harry’s mouth, my lips falling open as I shivered from the demanding drawl of the assassin’s lips working over my own, impending and dark in the way they forced my mouth open for his to take.
“You want me to fuck you? For me to lift you up by the slim of your hips so I could press my cock into your arse and pound you until you bleed for me, cry and become dirtied by my hands? It won’t happen. I have every right to tell you what to do,
And I couldn’t get enough.
And in response to his looming powerful body seeming cruel and calm, my body had moved on its own on instinct as I took a trembling step back only to be halted in my steps when Harry had spoke lowly, tone almost deafening to my ears in the low rumble that gave way from the dark timbre of his voice, rendering me stunted on the spot. “You’re going to give me a lap dance.”
as the wobbling of his bottom lip poked out the slightest bit and that pretty little wine red flush of his gathered up his slender, long neck and over his delicately defined cheeks.
Hermione got up quickly, already padding barefoot across the living room floor to get the stuff for me to sleep with

I gaped.
Before I could open my mouth to protest, Harry had plucked me off of him without looking back at me, his body seeming to be made up of rock as the muscles of his lean frame made no shift to show any sign of discomfort as Harry took the rest of the steps up to reach the level where all those agonized screams echoed and the sound of those Carbonou’s deafening growls and snarls came from, their scent overwhelming and filthy in its stench.
I swiftly

After all these years, I still don’t know how this imprint had came burrowing into my skin.
I was speaking before my mind could catch up to the words escaping my moving mouth. “I-I-I’m sorry. I just wanted to go out and have some
Kikue was staring up at me still, as if having stopped in all his movements with the way his once trembling arm that he had outstretched towards me in a fit of frantic rage, was caught up above his head and was stuck that way without motion.

” Harry ground out, as if he was talking between his teeth. I didn’t have the strength to make a retort.
But I couldn’t help my thighs from spreading out as I bent at the waist and stuck my ass out against Harry’s face to wiggle it in a frenzy of heated delirium, pleasure building up inside of my chest and stomach swooping with flutters of chaotic electricity.
I didn’t know whether Harry and Neville’s given nicknames for me were either an insult or an endearment.
I was spewing words out of my parted lips before my mind could catch up with what I was speaking out loud. “Wait! Where is Krum? Is he okay? This is his club.
Besides, I’m always in potential danger since I was someone who was widely hated. I’m surprised I haven’t been killed yet from all the threats and spiteful looks I endure throughout any normal day of mine.

I didn’t hide my empty heart.
I used my other hand to place it against the wall in an effort to keep myself from falling sideways, my heart beating so fast that I thought it would rip itself out of my chest and onto the concrete floor beneath me.

I panicked.
The stupid bodyguard I met wasn’t standing at the front entrance this time, but another one was, and I thanked whatever deity for that.
It was time to head the fuck on out of here and have some fun.

tighter around my plundering cock when I fuck them. And there’s something about making a boy cry out in honey slicked moans that make me want to pry it out of them some more-”
Zereth had said the wizard had murdered his own family with dark magic. But I couldn’t find it in myself to be the one to kill him. The act of killing in itself is different from seeing someone else do it and doing it yourself.
Before I could lock my gaze with the intimidating Gryffindor’s, I whipped my head away, letting my body balance out once again to the rhythm of the song as I tried to keep my thoughts from straying towards the man in the middle of the room as the rioting beating of my heart doubled in time to the quickened pace of my breath.
With Kevera snapping his gangly fingers, a swarm of goblins dressed in pitch black suites around their short stubby statures that indicated their positions as guards walked swiftly towards Harry’s person and shooed me away from out beneath the Gryffindor’s arm so they could take their wands out and swipe their magical devices up and down the tall length of Harry’s body. They were murmuring out spells and chants to themselves that allowed the wand to detect any dangerous items on the assassin’s muscled and powerful frame, the mystifying tendrils of murky brown magic escaping their wands as it trailed over every sinuous shape of “Devin”, analyzing and scanning about.
Harry turned right, up a spacious road that was quiet compared to the chatter and revving car engines from the main part of the city behind us. Large, flat roof coveted mansions took up at least three acres of the extensive area we drove through. Most of them were covered in tall floor to ceiling glass windows that towered high into the sky, displaying the intricate and lush furniture inside the modern, high class houses.
I was going to come.
“Full offense here, but playing Mario Cart beats going to a dull party anyday.” I let my mouth form fit around my words, tone soft in the neutral hitch of my voice, complacent and uninterested to fornicate my boredom towards the subject of conversation we were having.
sensation for me.
“Draco? Hey, are you okay? Look at me.” The light delicate pitch of Caetia’s voice broke through the haze of my crashing hysteria, my head snapping up in the direction of Sirius’ boyfriend’s voice as I heaved in a large breath that seemed to sting in the depth of my lungs.
If I didn’t take so damn long to find Draco’s whereabouts then the Slytherin wouldn’t have to have gotten to the point where he had to kill so viciously and mindlessly.

I was angry and embarrassed.
That if he kept touching me like this, intimately and sexually, that he would
I wanted to scream
That’s it.
My skin buzzed with energized longing, my bare arse sticking out as Harry pressed me further into the table by lifting me up while pulling at my arm behind my back. The action caused me to cry out at the slight prickling pain in arm’s tendons from Harry’s tug before I was pushed onto the table again at the same time the Assassin snapped his lower half forward to cause my feet to skitter across the floor and make me rise up on the tips of my toes only for them to be left dangling a breadth off of the ground now by his motions.
Hell yes, I wanted to have sex. I just felt wrong having sex with someone who was under the influence of a drug basically, but since Harry was self conscious enough to voice his consent to fucking me and it will lead to him calming down, then we were both in the clear of giving permission to have sex on both our ends.
And then I noticed what Harry had just said.
And then I’d be finding my way back to Harry soon after.
My eyes basically fucking told him.
At the moment, I just wanted to be alone so I could wallow in my own sorrows for the rest of the day and finally get with the idea that Harry will never want me.
Especially Potter.
“I saw Harry walk out towards the backyard. Pretty sure he’s wandering about back there and doing gods knows what,” Hezian intoned nonchalantly, his brows rising up in a look of quiet endearment that clearly spelled out the meaning “I know you want your boyfriend and you were using me to get his attention”.
The vampire blinked at me, stunted for a moment before I saw the corners of his eyes pinch aggressively into a gnarled fixture that had made my blood run cold. I could feel some people around us stare with fascinated curiosity.
There was so much built up emotion inside of me that I couldn’t help but release it all the moment I laid my eyes back on Harry when I woke up - discombobulated, confused, and absolutely exhausted.
“Need some cream for my coffee.” Harry’s voice dropped significantly, harsh and powerful as he made my prick rub up against the cabinet’s surface below, the pressure hot and heavy.
Fuck! I needed to stop comparing everyone with the damn assassin.
Having signed my name on the paper earlier today after my potions class up in the Gryffindors’ main quarters, rather embarrassingly quick from my inevitable fear of running into a certain specific set of two men that I bloody well feared colliding into, I had come straight to Pansy after and got into my designated outfit for the night.
The guy was packing a ton of muscle on him, although lean in his frame. He looked around his mid thirties, towering over my person as he walked with leisured steps towards me. The man was gorgeous so to say, his body clad in a rich, black suite that hugged the taut muscles he displayed with every minute shift he took, hair the color of dirty blonde, ranging from shades of golden like threads to an agate crystalline hue of light brown, cut short above his ears and long at the top. He walked with an air similar to the way Granger carried herself, with immense confidence and a dangerous teasing aura about himself.
He kept tearing me apart with every acidic, gravelly word he drawled out from the distracting curve of his lips, his voice gnawing holes through my chest and leaving me gaping open for him to mock and peer into.
“Great! Then nine pounds is more than enough since the facility isn’t that large.” Hezian’s voice punctured through my imagination of drop kicking my boyfriend, making me rip my gaze away from Harry’s face and back to Hezian.
How utterly
Thank fuck Harry didn’t see that.
Andrew let out a snicker, his mouth curling up in disdain as he peered up at me and away from his workload, the soumd cutting my rant off.
The lid had eased itself forward into the ceiling, unhooking itself from its wall and croaking open to reveal a sliver of pale moonlight that sunk its way through the small cracks of the entrance, a ray of light flooding through the dark fluorescent glow of the tunnel.
This was news to me. Trisko and that bartender, Jazine, were both found dead at the nightclub right after I left and that didn’t settle well in my stomach. What made my worries worse was how it was weird that the people I associated with last night, were the ones that ended up dead.
“I’m sorry to disrupt this make up session between you two, but Hezian wants Draco to work on that potion right now so we can get into Animadverto’s main facility to get a good gist of how many there are. We need to know how many we’re dealing with once we go and arrest them. Hezian wants the potion done in at least two days tops.” Weasley’s clipped yet amused tone made me jump into scrambling the fuck off of Harry in a haste, my face probably the color of scarlet as I went to drag the fabric of my shorts down my thighs where they had once almost crawled up my arse by Harry’s doing.
Rearing my head back, I felt the tendrils of my chaotic hair brush across the wet of the back of my neck and exposed, slick shoulders as the erratic searching of my wide eyes went from chasing one window to the next in hopes of finding one low enough for me to climb up towards and perhaps ease the glass door open belonging to it so I could get inside the fucking mansion.
The Gryffindors' walls had slid open inwards, revealing its signature set of it’s spiraling staircase that lead up to the house's main common room, the illuminate soft burnt orange glow of their lanterns blanketing the set of steps as it neared the top.
“You know I’m yours, you fucking
Both Harry and I couldn’t move.
My gaze flicked away from Potter’s to fixate on anything but the assassin in front of me, angling my body to the side in an effort to cover up the hard outline of my bulge beneath my towel and keeping my head tipped low to let the strands of my messy drying hair shield my burning face from Potter’s view.
Oh, this was going to be
Just when I was about to get my selected favorite character, Toad, through the finish line in a game of Mario Cart, a familiar voice shattered the deep concentration hovering inside the corners of my mind in a series of rapturing cracks.
That made the anxiety shift higher inside of the sickening roil of my stomach, my breaths coming faster in short staccatos as I tried to gather enough mental strength to stay beside Harry as we stepped out of the room and started to climb up the stairs.
Caetia’s dark brows were pushed down in a worried drawl, the purse of his dusky pink glossed lips shimmering beneath the awning of the purple light as he took a step towards me to my right, his right hand raised as if trying to placate a skittish animal.
Why would he do that?
I went stock-still.
But I figured at the same time, these sort of people that I had to exterminate were no better than I nor were they worth much of my time.
Vulnerable and open.
“Fuck!” I yelled out loud, the strain in my voice cracking as the sensation seemed to crescendo, heightening in its scorching touch like the backs of my eyes were going to burn out and turn bitter, the bile in my throat rising as I choked out a series of silent screams, my body seeming to seizure on the spot as my gaze obscured and the sound of my name, worried and painfully concerned, spoke out of Harry’s mouth.
Weasley was inside the kitchen getting some dinner ready so he had left Granger and me to hang out together.
I let out a scoff at myself, swallowing around a dry throat as I heard the crinkle of the envelope bunching up on itself from how harsh of a grip I had on it, body now wracking with a nauseousness that clouded my vision for a brief moment.
I was too shocked and hot to do anything, becoming limp in Harry’s embrace.
It was beautiful.
And with that, I was released from Harry’s grip, left stricken on the spot as I felt my foot drop back to the sand with a soft thud.
Krum gave a sharp nod towards Harry as he gestured to the set of stairs to the left of the large room. “Duly noted. You’re room number is 366, when you’re hungry, just apparate on upstairs to the dining hall and have one of my chefs cook for you. The only way to get to your room is taking the set of stairs to your left, the right set leads to the “Chamber” as I call it.… where BDSM members reside.” The Bulgarian decided to completely sway from my question, his voice in a low murmur now as he watched his customers writhe before him with a fondness settling in the confident curve of his lips.
“That’s quite alright, little one. I wouldn’t mind it if you got even closer, just so I can grab a hold of that creamy slender neck of yours and drain you of that Malfoy bloo-” A hand came up out of nowhere, catching me off guard as I watched fingers grasp the side of the (now known) vampire’s face with a bruising force, blunt nails scraping into the creature’s freezing cheek and making the man hiss out before being shoved carelessly aside like a flea.
It wore nothing else, their large bare feet planted flat across the cemented floor as they loomed dangerously near my suspended body.
” Harry murmured.
Kikue, well, I fucked him a good couple times when I was doing a job in Tokyo for a drug dealing situation near the boy’s home town. He’s not that attractive. And Kikue doesn’t mean shite to me, the sole reason for my association with him  is only to use the boy when I need the help, such as having a place to stay when I wanted one. Kikue was practically a fuck toy to me back then and not a good one either. I haven’t touched anyone since I saw Draco at Blaise’s club anyways.
The usual dark overtones of his room gave me an immediate comfort, the scent that was only ever significantly
It was deadly silent in this mansion.
I finally got some fucking godsdamn ice cream.
I fiddled with the envelope in my hands, an awkward warmth falling over my being at the sight before me. The space of this level of the building was huge, high ceilings that carried neon purple lights strung up on black wirings that faded into the color of the dark building. On either side of the room were spiraling staircases, open and seen to the whole crowd as it led up to a wrap around balcony from the inside that shown VIP groups sitting around on lush, white furniture that glowed beneath the strobe lights, smoke flitting around the balconies to display the allowance of cigars and cigarettes above the dance floor.
Bloody hell.
I may not be treated like a human being at the my new job, but I did get a good work load and got a decent amount of pay for it.
I felt torn, skewed of conscience as I observed the one thing I couldn’t have keep a good distance away from myself while I tried to keep my magic at bay and self taught myself to keep it intact. I felt out of place from my body, made up of fog that clustered in on itself and smothered those around it. I felt like a fucking animal, a mere disgusting creature that fumbled about on pristine floors until it seemed as if I had begun to walk on all four limbs like the
Sucking air into my lungs in one large gulp, I sprung up into a sitting position across the mattress that I found myself having been on.
I snorted.
And that’s when, after a given moment of wandering aimlessly around in this heavy air of darkness with my wide, horrified eyes, my peripheral view started to cease out of the cluster of the harsh and ominous smoke like tar of Harry's magic to slowly disintegrate back to a crystalline clear view, as if I was peering my head out of an endless tunnel and into the clear sheen of shimmering water.
Hell, I never had someone touching me this way. Especially with their own fucking magic. The only pleasure I felt was with my hand on my cock or my fingers desperately shoving in and out of my hungry hole whenever I felt the urge or need to satisfy the burning ache in my gut.
“Take off that scarf.” Harry’s voice brook no argument, but there was a sense of panic from my person in the way the assassin spoken his words, low and frightening.
Despite being bullied because of my eyes, people in Hogwarts didn’t give two fucks voicing their opinions on one’s appearance, and so I’ve both had bad and good criticisms on the appeal of my person. Some made fun of how my arse was too perky for a male and how my legs were too damn long while others thought that the curves accentuating the small, petite of my figure were quiet lovely.
When the door had slammed opened and broke apart, Harry had his weapon out and ready and with his back covering the whole of my vision from what came barging in through the door, I only heard a tiny sound of whatever it was that intercepted into the area.
with the incoherent murmurs of confused, heat laden words around Harry’s penetrating fingers within the access of my parted lips that were suckling, embarrassingly so, around the puncturing appendages as if my body had a mind of its own when it came to doing whatever Harry wanted from it.
The long line of his lean and muscled body had shifted only a bit from the slow, steady rise up his chest with the air he breathed, with such very little movement that I would not have caught it if not for the thousand times I’ve observed Harry throughout the years of our lives spent together at Hogwarts.
“Harry, put me down! I’m not a fucking child, dammit. I do have two legs of my own.” I hissed at the Gryffindor through the tremor of my voice, remembering that just moments ago, the man before me had killed someone with no such remorse or hesitation, purely in cold blood.
I was pretty sure that the Gryffindor knew of this about me with how we had taken Potions Class together in our Eighth Year. I was always quiet and liked to be left alone when we were assigned to do anything with the physicality of potions.
Why were we on the damn stage!?
The Gryffindor opened the malicious curve of his seductive grin, all predator sharp and callous. “You look nice getting all weak for me,
Then with no prevail, both Harry and I just soaked in each others’ presence and took silent comfort in the warm, calming sensation.
I liked praise.
It was quite a shock that Harry wasn’t fighting me tooth and nail with his stubborn streak of not listening to what I’d say to him. But now by Harry actually taking in my words and not arguing with what I’ve said, this went a long way to show that he probably had beaten himself up internally about the possibilities of having gotten to me sooner way too much and just felt the need to hear that I didn’t hate him like he hated himself for not getting to me in a shorter time.
and be
Harry wore black fitted cargo pants with pockets lining a couple inches on the sides of both his thighs, the strong of his thighs pronounce and the muscular set of his legs showing beneath the dark material that matched the black T-Shirt he wore, the fabric light against the toned hard rock of his abs and displayed the bulging muscles of his lean arms. Harry’s shoes were black as well, combat formed and giving off this sort of presence that was similar to that of a panther, all predatory and dark and silently deadly.
“Oh f-f-f-f-ffffuhhhcckkkkk,” I keened.
And I … I was in both fear and excitement from hearing such a sound from Harry.
knows
Pressing my lips together to keep myself from letting out an indefinite sound that would put me into an embarrassment turmoil, the Gryffindor’s hot breath whooshed across my thigh as he gripped the back of my knee and gave an easy tug up to cause my balance to wobble while my leg bent up towards Harry’s knelt fit frame. “Take them off, Princess. I’m giving you an hour to hide from me inside of my house until I come searching
But why would Harry want me to hate him so much? Even when I couldn’t for the life of me, despite the way I repeated how much I hated him over and over again. Harry
I took an initiative step back.
I hadn’t noticed that one of my boots had fallen off along with the one leg of my jeans until I had been yanked back around to face Harry and was lifted up by the Gryffindors arm sliding behind my lower back and hooking around my side, hefting me up so carelessly.
I gave her a sharp smile in return, voice easy and bored as I spoke out to Chang. “What are
I like him and yet he’s gotten so much meaner than before, putting me down constantly and hurting my feelings with no such care in the world for it.
Walking up the front marble steps of the mansion, Harry entered the foyer, my stumbling steps following from beside him as I tried to catch up to the damn Gryffindor, the large of my eyes turning into comical proportions as I took in the red fluorescent lighting playing across the shimmering black granite of the floor, a spiraling staircase etched in the sleek stone as it reached the second open level space of the mansion.
“Such a pure boy. Keep yourself that way.” The guy responded in kind to my words.
Like hell was I going to stay in my room. There was a BDSM level right below me and I was
Harry, too, shrunk the suitcase given to us and let me plop the small object into my inner front jean's right pocket after giving me the tiny object.
But when I went to quickly make a glance around the room while talking with Hezian in search for Harry, he wasn’t anywhere to be found.
I could ask Sirius to distract Harry so I could get out of my room without the assassin's knowledge. Sirius owed me that much for using me to get Harry mad.
I was going out of my mind, speechless and left with a plumping prick that made my skin flush hotter and my heart go into hysteria as my trembling hand went to grasp at the back of Harry’s shirt to tug on it. “P-Put me down. I’m really s-sorry. I won’t do it again.
I was a mess.
and if I was the one that helped you to achieve that goal. I-”
Harry moaned lowly, the sound heated and pained it seemed as he watched my head loll to the side with his ominous gaze, a growl rumbling deep in his throat as he released a litany of the the word “fuck” over and over again in darkened awe at my given state.
with me? Oh dear gods. I needed to get  inside of the Chamber before I had to turn this man down. There was no way that I was going to fall into this man’s hands like putty.
He didn’t answer me.
Harry shook his head in response to my plea, huffing out a shaky - seemingly nervous - low chuckle as he gave a gentle press of his lips against the space between my shoulder and neck before bringing his head back up so he could gaze down at me with a sheepish sad grin.
I was unhappy about being trapped and held against my will just to die at the end of my entrapment.
I keened, moistened and mingling in with a stuttering exhale of a breath from the bliss embedded gape of my mouth at the low of Harry’s command brushing featherlight over my skin, his teeth an alarming euphoric sensation over my flesh.
And I was fucking mortified!
I should make him tea afterwards.
Everything that’s been happening around me was overwhelming in its devastating, yet reveling state.

That was Zereth's own stupidity for not thinking much about the possibility of a wizard killing it after they were feeding them more magic to gain more power off of.
said.
When I heard Andrew Grant permission for my entrance, I stepped into his office, tearing the door open in my haste of nerves and stepped through the office to shut the door soundly behind me.
. I’ve been sending in a lot of assassin’s there to torture the demon until I can come back and torture them myself for as much as I want. Probably for eternity," Harry responded.
And there was more of them waiting for us.
The man’s cock practically felt like it was inside of me by the way he eye-fucked me so brutally and slowly.
It was approaching like a fucking ticking bomb.
Why the hell was Cho Chang even
Why is Harry doing this?!
I sucked in a sharp breath as I stared out at the scene in front of me.
Again, and again, and againagainagain!
I’m not supposed to be thinking about that bastard!
Miraculously, as if the Assassin knew what I was thinking or if he just wanted to get into a more comfortable position in fucking me, he had wound his strong sweat slick arms around my lower back and lifted me up with a slight tremor.
” Harry’s low lull of words came out in a soothing murmur, the parting of his mouth following his voice rumbling against tufts at the top of my blonde hair.
“We good now?” Harry asked in that new found voice of his made up character, dripping with an easy low cadence.
Harry parked a few feet away from the house to the side and into the beginning of the fall trees, my gaze stuck on the huge mansion that hummed with lively music, deep and upbeat in its tone as its sound slipped through the open front Italian wooden doors of the mansion. A ruby red light spilled out of the entrance and the cracked covered windows, revealing the neon fluorescent lighting from within with a few purple streaks combined with green.
“Take a guess,
. You’re probably hungry since you didn’t eat this morning, so we'll get you some food before resting. I’ll have Granger drop off the clothes she got you in our guest room by tomorrow.”
Like I should have been.
, the shopping district of Wisixi Podge.
He was frightening in that way.
It seemed the Carbonou reacted to my sound when it crowded in closer to my figure, shoving its massive frame into my personal space as it dragged my bottom lip down further, leaving my mouth open wide and the line of my bottom teeth scraping hesitantly across the flesh of its forehead.
Sirius’s boyfriend was weird.
That scared me.
Kikue was shrieking up at me as he tried to dig his long, pristine nails into the skin of my hand, his voice shrill with seething befuddlement as I curled my lip up in sadistic delight, reveling in the way Kikue struggled in my grip. “What the fuck is wrong with you! You psychotic bitch, let go-”
Please leave any questions and comments you have. I love getting them. Thank you for all your guys' continuous support!
“You’re such a prick. I hate you!” I shoved weakly at his shoulder, only to cry out sharply when Harry took his other hand to grab my left arm and yank it down towards him, the action too fast for me to comprehend. My face was a millimeter away from Harry’s own, his hot breath fanning the shocking part of my lips as I was forced to stare down at him from my perch on his arm.
is who I am. Someone who isn’t good. I’ve always been a morbid boy. My magic, having a mind of its own, gets out of hand. It's sometimes too powerful for my own body to contain and it tries to entice me to do bad shit. I’ve murdered many, and I’ve liked it, fuck, I’ve
I felt my body become weightless then, the magic having evaporated in the blink of an eye as I yelped out from the abrupt release of Harry’s power around me.
My lips were parted now, the opening of my mouth agape in a notion of apprehension and shock.
I wanted to be safe
In that moment Harry should've known that I didn’t give a rat’s ass about him torturing some demon that kept me captive for well over a month almost.
I awoke with a startle.
I felt multiples pairs of eyes on my figure, following my rushed movements as I did my best to ignore the stares of others in the large of the room.
I'm going to
My head lifted up off of the ground from where I laid limp across the floor to snap it back in unadulterated striking bliss as I let out a small squeak like small moan, my hair falling backwards to cascade over the sweat that covered in a thin sheen over the tops of my curved back, bum bouncing as well as my lax limbs, over the wet countenance of the granite floor while I shivered in the wake of my ecstasy.
to help break into the facility with the other agents I’ve assigned, just in case something goes wrong since you’ve got a ton of experience dealing with missions not going the way we wanted them to and accomplishing them regardless.”
Bloody hell!
what he felt.
Now I was going to kill it.
My eyes, widening further in their state of horror stricken fear and astonishment, caught sight of a nearby lamp that was attached to one of the walls but wasn’t lit up next to Harry’s head, manifest into a zest of shimmering explosive fire sparks and implode, the sound of a crackle and sizzle popping loud from beneath the sounds of thunder and lighting as well as the in between quiet the mansion provided while the energy I emitted from my wand with a hysteric wave scorched the lamp.
was a friend to Harry. Nothing more.
The room Harry apparated us to was one that was in a building that belonged to Arte et Marte. It was filled with a variety of already created potion assortments and many from their original forms to be tinkered with as well.
So I chanced a quick glance behind me to see where his attention was focused on instead and saw him chatting it up with Cho Chang of all people.
But I was growing
Oh my

at Harry’s permission for me to go on the mission with him.
My hand, as if on reflex, snatched its fingers around to curl around the cool wood of my wand and caress it into the curve of my trembling palm.
“Good boy.” Potter’s voice came out in a rough whisper, a thick honeyed rich tremor that wound its way into the concave of my chest to make it quake, rushing through my pulsing veins and straight down to my treacherous hot prick.
“We got the Daily Prophet to keep the murders in Astringent from going public so no one could go snooping around and find out about Animadverto and get themselves killed. But we couldn't convince them from not posting about Andrew's murder in a few days. Before the fucker died, he ratted you out about having contained the files of the factions promising customers to one of Animadverto’s leaders when they followed the little magical traces Potter left at the club when he used it and heard some witnesses talk about you being there with an envelope. And so they wanted to come after you, thinking that you gave Potter the files and knew where he was so they could come after him. That person who looked like Kinglsey was a shapeshifter who was part of Animadverto assigned to come after you and Potter to get a hold of the files.” Hezian looked way older than he really was right now, the crinkle in his brow seeming to deepen.
As long as I got to play a game of blackjack, then it should be worth it to discard my homework for a moment.
“Finally got you to say that I look good,” Harry grinned at me, showing off his white teeth as he gave me a dimpled smile that made me want to drop kick him into the ground with his sudden change in mood.
.” It was as if Harry was punishing me for liking him when he spoke his confession out loud with the timbre of his gruff, tormenting words. As if him caring for me was the damnation of mine and his existence, a hatred laced in his deep rooted affection for me.
of a man it looked like.
I shifted from where I stood, trying to alleviate the warmth I felt between my thighs, mouth slightly parted as I took in Potter’s hair. It was messier than ever, mussed up and pitch black in their tousled and disheveled strands, reminding me of the dark beginnings of midnight and ink, soft and silky looking. The shadowy locks of his hair were similar to that of the darkest depth of the ocean, smoky tinged and deafeningly onyx in its wake.
I felt like trapped prey now.
I went to reach for my switchblade in my jeans pocket but halted when I realized that Potter fucking took it from me not a while back.
And when Harry didn’t move a muscle in the hand that was rubbing my lower half up against his own, I cried out in mortified frustration and blindingly stared ahead of myself as I brought the shaking of my hands up with my forearms to lay them out under me so I could get a strained leverage over the floor  and made a minute rock of my cock over Harry’s, blushing like the virgin that I was and letting out an obscure, wet moan that made Harry’s bulge stiffen further and my skin break out in shamed goosebumps.
Electricity zinged down my thighs at that thought, hot and overwhelming.
It was dark and held all that of which was tenebrous.
I yelped out of shock when the demon snatched my head forward with it's fingers and slammed their lips onto mine, my chained wrists rattling about in my dismay as the demon’s mouth form fitted against mine and moved in a slow exploration that left only a sense of disgusted dread in the pit of my gut.
And I did.
“Deal.” I murmured, staring down the blackened set of stairs before me.
Read on. The next chapter will be posted on Monday, May 28th. Thank you!
I was fucked up.

The Asian looked ragged in her grey dress pants and blazer top with a silver colored blouse beneath, doing well to show off the curves of her voluptuous body. The woman’s black shiny long hair was left in a rats nest basically from positively getting a good fucking.
Right when I felt only the brush of the tip of Harry’s prick against my furled rim, the man had the fucking gaul to chuckle darkly down at me, wet warmed lips growling out into the skin of my neck. “That’s right,
When the magic started to heat up like risings flames sparking in the midst of a quiet forest, it felt as if invisible probing fingers skimmed past the low hitch of my jeans, making my skin quake and my chest constrict with the halting oxygen in my brain and lungs from the the sinful touch.
The magic was suddenly gone as quick as it came, leaving my body with a taunting caress over my flesh as I tried to catch my breath.
I turned into a slack limpet now.
Harry’s fist went straight through the wall to my side, his arm settling right at my eye level beside me as his hand made a cavernous hole in the wall, chunks of rock falling to the floor in rubble while the assassin heaved in a large breath and grumbled down at me in a possessive, condemned tone. “I’ll
Without my pride getting in the way of things, my body had moved on it’s own, a yearning having been buried deep inside of my suffering gut finally leaking forth as I shamefully raised my arms up towards the Gryffindor and let out a choking sob as I wiggled my fingers his way in a display of broken neediness that I’ve never shown to anyone in my life, not even my own father and mother.
I couldn’t find it in myself to speak, the large, stricken cobalt of my eyes staring straight up at the way Harry’s profusely darkened gaze settled unnervingly calm onto my prone figure across the bed where he plopped me down onto right after I had the most mind numbing orgasm throughout the whole of the twenty one years I’ve lived.
Harry gave no emotion away, expression devoid of any feeling as that unearthly unsettling stare of his stayed on my person that dripped in sopping wet clothes.
Harry’s head was turned down, glowing eyes taking in the way my body was being jostled in his grip, angling his body slightly away from my torso so he could watch my cock bouncing against my flat tummy and his dick constantly ramming in and out of my ass with a severe focus in his handsome features, a cruel strain that shown in the threateningly sexy curl of his lips.
I crossed my arms over my chest, tilting my head to the side and feeling the strands of my hair brush against the skin of my cheeks and forehead with the simple movement. “Where were you last night?” My voice came out in a whispered strain instead of the stubborn lilt I was hoping for.
for you. I will end up killing you if you and I grow more physically attached to one another. You will be the end of me, and I to you. I will push my entirety into you, the darkest, most vile parts of me and that will be your demise. We can
Why did it feel like I needed to make a cross over my chest like I was some catholic specimen that needed protection from a deity that may or may not be real? I did it anyways.
I let out a huff of air, the sound interrupting my train of thought. I felt my chest tighten at the mere memory of having to go through the same horrid event for four hours straight until Snape came bursting through the bathroom and broke my mind out of the spell.
I folded my arms over my chest, blood drenched hands coating and sweeping across the front material of my dark shirt, the tension in my body hard nonetheless what with my paranoia of getting ambushed or killed any time of any day.
But just as I was about to set myself into the notion that I would fling myself over Hezian’s stupid office desk to strangle the living shite out of the bitch before me, Harry’s boss decided to interrupt Chang with a sharp, hard edged response as he spoke to the two of us. “That’s enough. Let’s establish that Cho here is a regular fuck hole for the assassins and a well rounded woman that’s highly respected in her business,” Hezian growled out his next words as he stared straight at Chang with a look of complete irritation towards her, “and let’s also establish that Draco is not useless but is far more smart than any of the assassins here, plus you and I, given his exquisite history in academics. So put away that hideous jealousy you got going on there Cho before I kick you out of my office.”
At least Harry’s mind was off of whatever morbid thoughts he conjured up when I asked him about his reason for becoming an assassin. His mind was with me now, and that made me flood with a giddy happiness that I would never say out loud.
My voice seemed to have left me as I tried to breathe steadily and calm both my heart and boner down.
I let out a gasping keen around Harry’s fingers, the sounds spilling out of my suctioned cheeks mortifying and similar to that of a whore.
I didn’t know whether to be scared or turned on.
That’s when Zereth brought his massive right hand up to grab my face between their thumb and the rest of their fingers, the cool touch of it’s flesh sending a shockwave of electricity of terror through me as it squeezed my cheeks and the sides of my face in it’s hand.
My throat went raw as I bounced in Harry’s lap with the abrupt thrust of his hips against my arse, making me grasp onto his knees between the spread of my thighs with my flailing, twitching hands to grab ahold of something to ground me and keep me seated to prevent myself from falling flat on my face.
I needed a distraction.
My breaths were caught in my throat as my heart stopped and started up again during abnormal intervals.
Despite the shite that I’ve done in my past, I didn’t like having to do the things I had to. I was only trying to help my parents in anyway I can and I was a stupid teenager that did eveything in their power to protect said parents from dying at the hands of the Dark Lord.
I couldn’t scream, it hurt so
When Harry let his head agonizingly slowly tilt to the side, the tendrils of his obsidian chipped hair brushed across the bronze flesh of his forehead and sharp cheekbones, obscuring the glow of his eerie and brilliant eyes that kept their fixation on my own.
“I’ll have you know that I’ve lived thousands of years and the conduits I’ve eaten over the years weren’t as old as you were. But
“Guess my potion worked so far.” I whispered my words into Harry’s hair as I let my hand rub softly against the man’s back in a soothing manner.
But I was already a target in both the mens' gazes.
Except … well, what I found myself staring at as once the Stygian of Harry’s profusely powerful and brutal magic trickled away, was surely a scene that could rival a massacre, a genocide, a
“You’re different from the other conduits. You’re
With a plate of waffles on my lap and a jar of jam placed on the counter to my right, I ate with a joyous bounce in my sitting position, thanking all hell that I put on cotton grey shorts that prevented my arse from feeling the cold of the marble beneath me and helped give somewhat of a cushion for my sore fucked out bum. I had on one of Harry’s black rock band T-Shirts on too.
Even when the pain on my arse grew in tremendous ache, I didn’t want Harry to stop spanking me like the brat Harry and I knew that I was.
And I fucking
and your
Draco must’ve gained the upper hand once he had sat atop of the demon if he were fighting it before I arrived. Assuming how powerful the Slytherin had gotten, the moment the pretty blonde got a good handle of his magic and newly found powers along with that sharp witted brain of his to help bring about the odds on his sides, he had gotten the demon to be in a vulnerable spot fast enough to deal a great amount of injuries to them to render it immobile.
you on the hard jut of my cock, how much I’ve watched you throughout the last five years, without you knowing. Watched you bathe, watched you sob in the latest of nights and struggle between the dilemma of making you cry more or soothing your worries. You see, I’m not
I wouldn’t let my pride get in the way of getting someone killed on my behalf though.
Walking towards the door with a jilted step and my breaths roughened as I tried to calm the racing of my heart down back into its regular pace, I quickly opened the heavy wooden door with a rushed turn of my wrist on its shiny, steel handle and sprinted into the room to softly shut the door behind me in a barely noticeable press of its frame back into place.
I’m going to break in.
take slow deep breathes for me. Come on.” Harry spoke closer now, the shadow of his voice a deep rasp leveled out into a smooth fluctuation that had every tense line in my body immediately giving way and relaxing at the rigidity that was there just a few seconds ago.
Jutting out my bottom lip, I actually lifted my right foot and stomped it against the hard surface of the brick covered street, the smack of my booted sole ricocheting off of the walls of the multiple buildings around me.
My body, the traitor that it was, had a mind of its own. From one second to the next, I found my feet shuffling about in an awkward jilted walk towards “Thanos”, my brain short circuiting from hearing Harry's simple demand that the whole of my frame seemed to follow without a given thought. The skin on my arms heated up as I grew closer to Harry and the bike with an anxious chew to my lip and a glower from the pinch of my features to show the irritation and shocked warmth wrecking havoc inside of my body at having not protested as much as I thought I would against Harry’s order.
“What else are you not telling me, hm?” I said, voice dripping with caution as I leaned up a bit to catch Harry’s stare with my own.
But I was too bloody stupid to realize that I should have seperated the two same-colored potions from each other so I knew which one was which. I should have also looked at the tube long enough to know that it had a label on it unlike mine.
” Harry responded in kind to my plea, voice a deep husk that reached into my gut and set it aflame.
But I needed to get the hell inside the mansion and hide before Harry comes to find me!
very much.
My words failed to finish my statement. I was making sure to keep my gaze stuck to my plate of food and not over to Harry’s direction, flustered and mortified at the heady sensation of
But two thoughts came to me that left me in more of a fluster.
My eyes were stricken wide, my limbs having become jello by Harry’s touch and body on mine and from the utter surprise at being suddenly throwed and being in this sort of situation by Harry that I accidentally created.
I resisted the urge to snark at the man about having called me a ‘little bunny’.
I still don’t believe my appearance is appealing but I’d have to work on my insecurities later. Right now, I needed to step out of my comfort zone and just …
I had to keep myself from whining out in dismay at his display of enticing masculinity and his devilish charms.
It was as if sex exploded on the dancefloor, except … well … with clothes on.
The damn assassin conjured up magical fucking
I wanted to sneer at the little shite.
I couldn’t help but stare at Harry though.
But I didn’t want to
“Tell me what you did wrong today,
Breathing in the frigid air surrounding me, I let out a contented sigh.
But I wouldn't dwell on the many times I could have had Draco beneath me, crying out so sweetly with my prick inside him and rearranging his insides, no, because I have him now. And I still wasn’t done with him, not in the nearest.
I remember specifically how Krum decided to “accidentally” push me down the Hufflepuff's set of stairs that led to the first level of Hogwarts. I didn’t attend the ball because father thought that it was useless and pathetic of me to associate myself with wizards below our level and forced me not to go. I had been minding my own business with my nose in one my potions textbook that night before I heard Krum yell out at me about being a pansy little bitch from beside me out of nowhere and found myself being shoved violently down the set of steps before flipping out my wand and casting a spell to hover my frame above the steps before my body would be damaged beyond belief.
The head brushed my prostate immediately and I spasmed on the spot, a weak wail ripping out of my mouth as shots of pleasure and heat went off like fireworks inside of my stomach, flesh heating up like a damn furnace as I tightened my legs around Harry’s hips despite how frail I felt at the moment.
My ass was
The Gryffindor
I’m your fucking master and you belong on my cock. My dirty
I settled against my seat, back pressing against the soft leather of the chair I sat on as I drew the long of jean clad right leg over the other in a slow motion, tilting my head and feeling the slight long silky soft strands of my pale hair frame the angular curves of my face from having its locks fall out of my low ponytail at the action of my head lilting.
I wanted, and wanted, and
But then, something sliced right behind the space of my eyes, red hot and agonizingly biting into the frontal lobe to pierce like a hammering nail to the back of my skull, vision turning into vapid spots of flickering electrified blue and static white.
He fucked me out, dicking me down and form fitting me to his cock like he was shaping me into his own fleshlight, my arse in pain from the abuse it was being put under while my prostate was weeping from the constant jab upon its heated point while my cum rushed forth and soaked the fabric of my skirt some once again.
” Zerith murmured down at me, the shadow of his figure looming large and foreboding behind me as I tried to reign my panic in and keep myself together.
I was both mad at myself for making Draco feel that way and at the Slytherin for doing something against my words and most likely putting himself in the position of getting into trouble.
“I’m going to come. I’mcomingI’mcomingI’mcoming!” My voice was shrill, panicked in the shock of my arousal as Harry simply yanked me forward in time with his upward, brutal thrust that slammed so deep into me that the the whole of my body had started to convulse as my hole sucked down over the girth and length of Harry’s dick while the penetrating meat of the assassin’s shoved even
Hezian grinned from behind his desk, eyes roving over the whole of my face as he examined me openly.
“I don’t know what happened, Harry. I was putting dinner away with Ron when I saw Draco sound asleep, and then there was this black smoke seeping into the kitchen from the living room where Draco was. Ron and I ran to Draco to see what was happening, but w-we couldn’t
Throughout my years as a student in Hogwarts, there has been this shadow casting over my body everywhere I went. I’ve lingered on the doubt of my parents love for me, the doubt of the promise Voldemort bestowed upon mine and my parents safety throughout the war that he initiated. There’s been doubt about who I was as a person, consistently and continuously. As I grew older, each choice I made, bad or good, festered upon my flesh and mind like a damn parasite. There has always been doubt inside, it breaks in me and molds me into who I am as of this present moment.
Right.
I peaked over my shoulder to watch in surprise when I caught sight of Harry falling to his knees into the earthy ground as his hands reached up and spread my asscheeks to expose my hole to the cool air of the forest surrounding us, the crimson gleam of his eyes seeming to turn almost black in the wake of his arousal, pupils dilated and his mouth parted as if he was in awe of my body, specially my ass.
