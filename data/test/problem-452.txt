“Another friend told me of the goddess who rides the white horse.  I think… I am beginning to understand the respect which has been lacking in our dealings with other creatures.”
But as Harry bent down and kissed him, three drops of hot candle wax fell on Draco’s night-shirt, and he woke with a cry.
Andromeda’s face softened. “You aren’t just some magical weapon against evil, Harry. You’re a person who people love.”
“What?” Draco asked.
Harry didn’t like being called a beggar laddie, even if it was part of the plan.
It was two o’clock.
“All right, but I’m watching you.  No grabbing my arse, Potter.  Remember I know where you live.”
Draco’s spell had no effect except to make the monster bark with all three heads, a deafening sound.  Its six eyes rolled madly.  He tried again with a binding spell, which was equally useless.  None of the spells he cast worked against it, so in desperation he cast a protective shield around himself.  The giant dog lunged just outside, still barking its fool heads off.
“Seriously?” Padma said. “What did you like about it?”
“Then how do you know that you love him?”
“Which no one can hear.”
to tear up.”  Harry really didn’t need to see any more of the article speculating on when he would find “someone special.”
A gasp. “Draco!”
“What, I said two o’clock, didn’t I?  And it’s only a few minutes after.”
Granger listened to him carefully.  “That makes perfect sense,” she said.  “We should have been thinking about how environmental crises affect magic.  Have you filed a report?”
Draco’s eyes were dancing.  “What is the name of this poem?”
Malfoy choked on treacle tart.
“Where are Potter’s hands?”
Stroking.
Prompt:
“Well, then,” Harry said, charmed. “I guess we’re sorted.  Let’s go home, Gabriel.”
“I do, in fact,” Malfoy said, turning back to the cottage.  He returned with two brooms, one sturdy and stable for long rides, one light and quick for agility.
Draco swept past him and down the stairs.
But why would Potter invite Draco on a date at all?  Maybe he meant just play at being on a date – a pretend date.  To fool the newspaper, or something.  That made more sense.
“Perhaps it was the humidity.  Bring it round tomorrow and I’ll see what I can do.  You didn’t find a Blibbering Humdinger, then?”
Sandy hair was quickly forgotten when they were naked in the shower together, all hungry mouths and roaming hands.  The sound of cascading water caught Draco’s cries as he spilled himself into Harry’s mouth.  He barely recognised his face in the steamy mirror when they emerged.  Dark-eyed with lust, stunned with pleasure, wanton.
“But it’s just the Squi…” Harry’s words were cut off as another tentacle wrapped around his arms and waist and began dragging him out of the boat. Malfoy dove toward him and grabbed Harry around the legs. The tentacle was sharp and painful where it dug into Harry’s sides and the smell of ammonia burned his lungs. The giant creature snapped its wicked-looking beak, far too close for comfort.
“Vauxhall Wyvern. The plane was a Westland Wyvern.”
But where exactly was Harry?  The Protean Charm linked their coins; Draco hoped the link was strong enough to track with.  Holding up its string he said,
He went back to the kitchen and returned with a plate of nice-looking biscuits.  “Come now, Ignatius, I’m sure Potter didn’t mean it, whatever it was.  Have a biscuit, there’s a fine handsome fellow.”
In the narrow space, the slightest restless stirring made a foot brush a calf, a hand brush a thigh.  At first they stilled at these small contacts, but when neither pulled away, their touches began to linger, turn into strokes.  Their bodies slid closer to the center of the small bed.  Harry heard Draco start to say something, but shushed him, skating a hand across his body until his fingers found and pressed against Draco’s mouth.   Warm lips pressed back, and a hand landed lightly on his hip. So a conversation began without words, halting at first but gaining fluency, a language of hands and limbs and mouths and tongues and breath.
Draco brought him a cup of tea and then sat next to him with a damp cloth and a little pot of salve.  “Your clothes are all wet anyway, might as well take them off,” he said matter-of-factly, starting to lift the hem of Harry’s jumper. Harry squawked.
“Harry, what have you been doing?  Are you all right?  You look…”  Draco had no words for how Harry looked, some mixture of exhilarated and agonized and exhausted.
“Um – ‘cause you’re not?”
“Go away,” Potter said, loud enough to be heard through the thick wooden planks.
“The New Guinean Nubbumping Humdinger, you heard it here first.” Draco smiled at Harry. “Luna was the first person generous enough to accept my offer of Magical Repairs and Reparations.  I try to do what she asks.  It’s never dull.”
Potter spoke up, because the damn room had kept the door to Potter’s side open, and he apparently had nothing better to do than eavesdrop.  “I could help.”
“No offense intended, Herman, my apologies,” said Potter. “What are all those -phores for?
Hermione frowned.  “You know, I hadn’t thought about it, but that was entirely missing from the curriculum at Hogwarts.  If I’d stayed in Muggle schools, I’d have eventually studied Chaucer, I suppose.  But I don’t remember even seeing anything of that sort in the library at Hogwarts, unless you count that dreadful play,
“Well spotted, Potter.”
“Can’t be done unless he agrees,” the bear said.  “Pity, but those are the rules.“
So by the light of the stars and glow-worms, Draco most deliciously did.
“The chief wizards here know secret ways to travel very far quickly,” said the other kitsune.  “One of them is in Osaka now to officiate at the Grand Sumo Tournament.  We could write a message to him for you. You will know him by his splendid robes with the purple trim.  I believe he will help you.”
Potter was demanding the dragon stop burning, pillaging, kidnapping and eating people.
Harry slid his hands back to cup Draco’s arse, then pulled him down, rolled over on top of him, and began to kiss his neck. “Can I suck you off, too?”
“Who was she?” Harry said.
“That beast was inside the school first year?”
Draco shrugged. “I didn’t want to.” He looked up. “Why do I have to answer all the questions, Harry? Why don’t you ever talk about your own feelings?”
Potter narrowed his eyes and Draco realized that he’d just made himself look suspicious.  Potter had a junior Auror expression on his face, like he was about to accuse Draco of destroying evidence.
Draco was feeling more optimistic when he re-entered the forest that afternoon.  And there in a glade he came across a hippogriff, a sleek steely-blue colored female.
Draco smiled and turned his head to drop a kiss onto Harry’s hand.  “Later?  After I’ve had a nap?”
“Speak for yourself,” said Draco, not looking up from his book on magical flora of East Asia.
“Home is where you make it, Harry,” Draco answered, serious now, a questioning look in his eyes for a long moment before he abruptly turned his head away.  Chilled, Harry felt him withdrawing – hell, what just happened?  He made himself take a deep breath.
“It was enormous!” Harry protested.  “It must have been a foot across!”
So do Harry and Draco-bear.
“And Sweetie-pie.  Don’t forget Sweetie-pie.”
“Thank you for your help, Potter,” Draco said.
said his more hopeful side.
Harry still looked skeptical.  He couldn’t be jealous?
“English,” Harry said hurriedly.  “It’s the only language I read.”
“Always agree with you.”
“Yeah?  Where did you run into it?”
“What have you got here?”
Draco stared, puzzled.  The weather was calm….
“I’m not taking all my clothes off,” he said.
“Going to run away now, little boy?” Voldemort sneered.
“We have little trust in wizards, generally.  To shield themselves from the notice of their fellow humans who fear magic, wizards seek to control magical creatures.  They see themselves as our managers. It is not an attitude of respect.”
Æthelflæd’s eyes widened and softened. “The loss of their home.”
Harry and Draco looked at each other.  They were the same age and about the same height, both British and both white, but there the resemblance ended.  “No, this is - Mr Malfoy,” said Harry, thinking it sounded very odd.
Harry looked along the coastline.  “Here’s a place called Glacier Bay.  That sounds promising.”
“HELLO!  WELCOME!  WHO’VE YOU BROUGHT TO VISIT?” boomed the North Wind.
❀ ❤ ☼  ❤ ❀
“I’m the Centaur Liaison,” Draco said, waving toward the Forbidden Forest in explanation.
“Malfoy!  How’s it coming with the centaurs?”
“Spinks was caught embezzling.  He’s gone.  Come back and see me in the morning, I’ll fill you in.”
Malfoy smoothly stepped in. “I think we can consider the injury collateral damage.”
Draco shrugged.  “I’ve never studied batraquomancy.”
Malfoy regarded him in silence for a moment, then said “Alright.  Not here, though, I really do need shade.  Come on, then.”
“Of course I have a name,” the bear said haughtily.  “My name is Draco.”
“My neighbor’s chickens, mostly, and the occasional goat.  And the neighbor’s kids, when the mangoes on my tree are ripe.”
As the feather skimmed across Harry’s nipples, it stiffened, spurted ink, and drooped.
“I’d have loved a broom like that back when I was a Seeker,” the surely-a-Weasley said, echoing Draco’s thoughts.  “I need something sturdier now, though. When you’re dealing with dragons, ‘fire-bolt’ takes on a whole new meaning.”
“Strange things that happen around here are always your fault!” said Uncle Vernon.
Luna stood above it, singing very quietly. The Mooncalf gazed up at her with its bulging eyes.
“I should hope so,” said Draco.  He seemed to relax, all the same.
“With you?”
finds her way back, but you know she’ll turn up again in the morning. Good thing I renewed the fish preservation charms.” He hung his wet clothes on a chair and slipped into the other side of the bed.
is better,” Draco said definitively.
“And have you bang me into the wall every few steps and drop me on the stairs?  I think not.  The house elves will bring something.”
“Sure, I’ll come if you want me to.  Ready now?”  Might as well get it over with.
Draco’s eyes were fixed in front of him.  Ahead of them, a pair of older men were walking along hand in hand.  Harry said nothing, but bumped Draco’s shoulder lightly with his own.  Draco looked over into a face full of attentive concern.  Harry’s hand brushed his.  Draco half-smiled, and then they were holding hands.
The students were making their own mortarboard caps from taped together white paper.  The caps rose high, like a chef’s hat, with long strips of accordion-pleated paper taped on for the tassels. Draco took a scrap of paper and folded an origami crane for Yamikani, the warm, earnest, capable Head Girl, who started a fad by attaching it to the end of her tassel.  He was thereafter kept busy folding more and giving origami lessons to whichever laughing students had the patience to make their own.
“This is one more problem with using house-elves for labour,” Hermione said. “They can’t be expected to know all these differing cultural traditions, but they haven’t been trained to cook for a diverse student body. From a post-colonial perspective…”
“A bed and me?”
Potter had stopped in his tracks.  “Malfoy’s right – if he doesn’t want me to, I won’t do it.”
“Oh, that’s not right.  How nice of you to want to help him.”
Harry agreed and dropped down to the ground to wait.  Malfoy came flying towards him and Harry burst up into the air, but Malfoy sped up at the last second.  Harry chased him and caught up easily.
“But here – you’re not using magic.  Wasn’t it hard for you to learn to do things the Muggle way?”
“What do you want for that?” said the pug-nosed lassie.
“You let him AK you on purpose?  You really do have a Savior complex.  But I don’t see him here dead.  Unless he’s the flayed baby thing.”
“He said you could have a long and healthy life.  My beautiful son.”  She wouldn’t meet his eyes.  “Let’s take you back to Hogwarts now.  I know you don’t want to miss your studies.”
“Oh, Harry, what have you done!”  Draco wailed.
“No need, it’s fine as a couch. Honestly, I might end up sleeping on the floor, it would be more like the bed in my hut.”
Harry shook his head. “The world has gone strange.”
8888888
“A what?” said Draco, a bit dazed.
“Hm,” said Pansy. “In that case….” She raised her voice. “Weasley, what are you doing Tuesday night?”
Draco swallowed, hit with something like grief. Apparently he didn’t hide it well enough, because Potter looked at him with a hint of concern.
Malfoy choked.  His eyes were dancing with laughter which he was unsuccessfully trying to disguise as a cough.
“Heresy!” Draco said, seizing another chocolate, but this time Harry plucked it away from him to stuff into Draco’s mouth.
“I can’t sleep with you screaming.  Sit down on the bed.  SIT.”
“How are you going to make me?”
“No, she’s very practical. She’ll have made sure they packed everything they need for the expedition. And she’s good with animals.”
“Is that all it takes?  What, is this opposites day or something?  So I should say, ‘Harry, I adore your dark tempestuous locks’?”
“I suppose I was,” said Harry serenely.
All those years I never learned to ignore you.  I’m going to try it now.  Let’s pretend if I don’t see you, you can’t be seen.  If I don’t meet your eyes, their green fire won’t burn me. If I don’t look, maybe you’ll get away.  I mean go away.
“Well, we are, aren’t we?”
“I told you he was a Chinese cultural hero,” said Harry. “Those acrobatics in the fight scenes were amazing.”
Just then they heard the Floo come to life in the other room.  “Hello?”  It sounded like Potter’s voice.
your case.”
“Madagascar, I think.  I’ve been wanting to go there for awhile.”
“Zebra.”
They were strolling through a park when clouds returned and it started to rain lightly. Hermione was starting an Umbrella Charm when Padma said, “Oh, but the rain feels nice.”
“Yeah.  But I meant, meant to - ”
Father had a formidable collection of dark artefacts, but it was Draco who had the knack of magical work on objects.  His father dismissed it as tradesman’s tinkering.  What Father really collected was influence – well-calculated flattery, a favor here, a threat there, a discreet bribe, an ostentatious donation, a strategic loophole.
“Luckily, Harry Potter, what I need from you is not so much persuasion” – Draco’s darkening eyes fell towards Harry’s mouth – “as permission.”
“Teddy is a joy. I don’t know what I’d do without him. And he hasn’t had any more trouble since he began taking that potion.”
Harry had never heard anyone mention a Squib in the family so casually. “Thanks, Padma,” he said thoughtfully, tucking his book under his arm.
Rutherford shook her leg at Potter again, and clapped her wings to get his attention.  She’d crossed two continents twice over to deliver this poem, and if Potter knew what was good for him, he’d take it!
They were supposed to ‘talk to heal the wounds of the past’.  Harry faced Draco Malfoy.  Reconciliation?  Not likely.  He crossed his arms.  “Any suggestions on where to begin, Malfoy?”
“I don’t see anyone else around.”
The next melody he played rose into something more hopeful and joyous. “For future possibilities.”
The tap in the back garden produced a shimmering, translucent snake of a pure deep ethereal blue.  As it hissed, Harry paused with his wand raised and hissed back.  “It’s in real distress,” he said.  “Claims to be fainting from the heat.”
“Wuffley, this is Harry Potter and his owl Gabriel.  They will be our guests.  And this is my cat Fern, I don’t believe you’ve met.  Potter, this is Wuffley, the skipper of the
“Oh,” Potter echoed softly, his eyes widening.  Then his eyelids drooped as his eyes darkened, and his face hovered close again.  And then they were kissing again and Draco rather lost track of anything else for quite some time.
“Cock-shoot, cocksure, cock-of-the-walk, cock a snook, cock-a-leekie soup for lunch today –“
“I feel like I’m floating.” Harry smiled. “She’d say I’d been stung by a Billywig.”
She rather lost track of the days before she finally came close to Potter again, in the mountains of Romania.  It was rugged, beautiful country, but there were too many dragons for her taste.  At last she found Potter, flying with another red-haired man – did he collect them?
They traveled a long way and finally as night was falling they came to a steep hill.  The bear knocked on the side of the hill with one great white paw, and a door appeared.  It opened into the hall of a castle, all gleaming with gold and silver and lit with candles.
The woman began casting diagnostic and healing spells. The Hippogriff quieted and seemed to relax.
“Wonderful news.” Pansy smiled at him fondly. Draco would have been annoyed, but sometimes – his mother had been gone five years now – it was nice to get a fond smile.
Who is “we”?
“All right.  Let me see about protecting the plants first, and then we’ll talk about it.  You could, er, have a cup of tea and some biscuits while you wait.”  Draco turned to Potter, who was regarding him with disbelief.
Ask, just ask.
“And always agrees with you…”
8888888
“I wrote to them and offered my services, a couple of years ago.  I know I owe them both, for –  foul language, and that damn bottle of wine. And for saving Greg.  Hermione wrote back and said she’d let me know. I took that to be a polite brush-off, as I’ve never heard from her since.”
^(OvO)^
He was always stealing glances at one, muttering. And wherever Draco went, looking for a peaceful spot amidst the Hogwarts reconstruction, Potter turned up.  Didn’t talk, just lurked.
“How do you bear it, Mother?”  Draco’s voice was shaking.
“We’ll be looking at the sunrise if we don’t get to bed.”
Rain was beginning to fall.  Draco decided to take the Floo from Hogsmeade into London and do a little research at the National Wizarding Library.  He could try again in the forest another day.
A flicker of movement down there caught his eye.  A large toad on the ground had just caught a fly.  The toad looked familiar.  “Is that Trevor?”
Rising, rising, tumbling together, frantic, tender, sap flowing, cocks crowing, a fierce explosive sweetness.
“Lavender?  What’s wrong? Lavender?”
So Harry finished his meal with an utterly delicious combination of sweetened yogurt, cardamom, saffron, pistachios and rosewater, and tried not to keep thinking about Draco Malfoy.
It was a miserably rainy autumn Sunday and Harry was restless, not in the mood for company. He wandered empty corridors of Hogwarts lost in thought, brooding over his latest confusing argument with Ginny, until he found himself on the fourth floor by the stairs to the Owlery.  He hadn’t been back there yet since returning to school as an eighth year student.  On impulse he headed up.
“Kreacher, do you know how snakes came to be in my taps?”
“That was Hedwig’s boy,” another owl answered. There was a moment of silence in honor of Hedwig, who died in a curse-storm ever loyal to her boy.
Draco laughed and reached for his wand.
“Reason not the need, Potter,” Malfoy said with an airy wave of his hand.  “You simply don’t know what you’re missing.”
“What about the riches?” Uncle Vernon demanded.
“Ah, Potter.  Most people make appointments, but then you’ve always been one for the direct approach.”
With difficulty, Draco asked, “How is your sister?  She was friends with Lavender Brown, wasn’t she?  I’m very sorry about … all that.”
He was sweeping around the back of the Manor now, scanning the trees.  “There’s another party of peacocks in the grove on the left,” he said over his shoulder.  “We’d better get out of here.”  A light tingle let him know he’d flown through the old overhead wards.
“Even if they had wizarding help, that must have taken ages to carve,” Draco said.  “Why here, I wonder?”
“You have been a diligent messenger, but perhaps it would be best if you return home now.”
“I don’t know,” Harry answered.  He’d thought he might find some answers to life overseas, but it seemed he was as uncertain as ever.  “Keep bees?”  he said at random.  If the volunteer workshops were to be believed, it was a good Income Generating Activity. But mostly he was remembering the wild sweetness of the fresh honeycomb he’d bought a month ago, from a man selling it out of a metal box strapped to the back of his bicycle.
Malfoy flinched.
The light drained from Draco’s eyes, and his face and hands stilled.  “Well, our family ambitions didn’t serve us very well in the end.”
“Why don’t you boys go for a walk then? And stop distracting me while I’m working out how to beat Weasley?”
“That was even worse.  I did like the costumes, though.  The plumes on that one headdress must have been a yard long.”
“Oh, as if I want to touch you,” Potter grumbled, climbing into the far side of the large bed.  There was no night table on his side.  He took off his glasses and handed them to Draco.  “Put those somewhere safe.”
“We cannot depend on the Ministry, of course, weakened as it is by the Rotfang conspiracy,” Luna said.  “But we must do all we can to protect magical spaces.  When you described the Anggitay I thought of the sacred white horse, so I visited a couple of statues of the goddess before I came here.  That always helps me feel strong and calm.”
Draco was about to agree when he abruptly realized that he would likely be lumped in with the bad.  “Sometimes people change course,” he said.  But her expression had turned distant.  Padma looked quite different from what he remembered of her twin, Parvati, who was always giggling with that other Gryffindor girl, the silly one, who…
There was silence as Malfoy seemed to be biting back a retort.  His voice sounded strained when he finally replied.  “Not new.  Older, and trying to be wiser.  You, on the other hand, are now restored to your classic look.  I don’t think they’ve made that style of frames for the last ten years.”
The food wasn’t bad, but the noise from the bar was as bad as ever.  “Your room is here?  How can you sleep?” Draco exclaimed.
Lily.  Lily of the valley.  Harry had a vision, suddenly, of his mother as a young woman in Godric’s Hollow, smiling in a garden.  “Maybe I should.”  The flowers were graceful and refreshing, somehow, with their light scent.  Grimmauld Place was dark enough, there ought to be plenty of shade there.
“Unless you’re scared…” the bear drawled.
“Different holidays,” Anthony said. “If Passover didn’t fall during the Easter holiday I could get permission to go home for Seder on the first night, and my mum would send me back with a load of matzoh and coconut macaroons, and sometimes at school she would owl me challah or rugelach, or hamentashen at Purim. But you can’t owl hot latkes.”
Draco shrugged.  Going roofless for a few days in the spring was a relatively minor matter, he thought.  In comparison to living under a roof shared with Bellatrix, Fenrir, Nagini, assorted other Death-Eaters, and the Dark Lord himself.
“Cho’s waiting for me.” She turned to Ron again. “And if you feel the need to protect your virtue, you can always bring a chaperone.”
Getting no immediate answer other than a long look, he leaned back, slid his foot out of his flip-flop, stretched out a bare toe and nudged Malfoy’s knee.
“A little to the left,” Draco said.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Harry couldn’t say anything.
“My name is
“I wash them, Malfoy, not that it’s any of your business.”
“Try this one,” Draco said, feeding Harry a chocolate.
“As cool as Bill Weasley?”  Draco looked puzzled for a moment, then shook his head with a slight laugh.  “Only you could be insecure about being Harry Potter,” he said in an undertone.
“Name of a star, Eta Draconis, believe it or not.”
“Yes, and sometimes. Were you hoping for a spin?”
“Did you?” Mrs Weasley shot him a look before returning to her needles. “And how is he?”
“Thank goodness he couldn’t get the aeroplane,” Hermione put in. “They didn’t sound safe at all. There’s only one left, and it’s in a museum.”
“Did he ever get the electric organ?” Padma asked. “I thought the aeroplane sounded a bit over the top.”
“Sorry,” Potter said, drawing back and turning away.
Draco learned that Æthelflæd had vouched for him and his house arrest was over, but he was expected to continue working with the haven for a year, longer if he wished; since he enjoyed the work, that was no problem.
Harry finished assembling his instrument, blew a few notes, and adjusted the mouthpiece while Draco admired the gleaming curves of brass and the sight of Harry backlit by afternoon sunshine.  “Er – this is for you,” Harry said, looking bashful suddenly, then put the horn to his lips and blew.
“Remarkable,” said Blaise.  “Next you’ll be telling me that Potter also has black hair.  But no, that would be too extraordinary a coincidence.”
“I wouldn’t dream of it, sir,” Draco said blandly.  “Your mellow – should you be fortunate enough to achieve one – will remain unharshed by me.”
Potter leaned closer, his eyes falling to Draco’s mouth.  Draco’s breath stilled.  Then….
Harry flushed.
Silence fell.
“You never know until you try, Potter.  Come on, gird your loins for battle and get cracking.”
Padma, meantime, had hailed Anthony Goldstein to ask his opinion.
Harry shook, Draco felt strangely lost, and the phoenix began to sing.
“To be ignored, abused or ordered around.  I’m familiar with the concept.  You have a lot in common with the Dursleys, Malfoy.”
They didn’t fly far, because Malfoy didn’t want Fern left behind.  He was speculating whether Fern would be willing to go up in a basket attached to the broom.  Harry didn’t think that would work, because Malfoy loved pulling stunts like looping, so it was just talk so far.
Maybe they should try what?  Being friends?  How did one try to be friends with Potter?  And what on earth did he mean by a play date?
“You fill your trousers quite nicely yourself,” Malfoy said, gazing at Harry’s arse.  “And I do believe they’re getting fuller all the time,” he added, staring at Harry’s crotch.
The Glamour thinned for a moment as Potter’s eyes gleamed green.  He nodded and left.
“I’m sure there’s honey in the boat pantry, Potter,” Draco said tightly.
The red-haired laddie gave Harry an apple made of gold.  Harry would have liked a real apple better, since he hadn’t eaten breakfast, but he didn’t want to be rude so he put the golden one in his pocket.  Then the laddie took one of the knights from his chess set, waved a wand over it, and there was a horse for Harry to ride.  He thanked the red-haired laddie and off he went.
“Oh yes, it’s quite nearby, and there’s another statue of her there, but they made a mistake and put clothes on that one.  So unnecessary for a fertility ritual.  I would love to go to the crossroads there at Beltane, to see her come riding.  If only I could find a hippalectryon to carry me.”
Things seemed likely to get sentimental here.  Rutherford shot an assessing look at this dog she was apparently going to be sharing a house with.  The dog regarded her placidly and thumped his tail against the ground.
He smiled, glad to see her energetic again.  “Are you a leopard pouncing, my piratical girl?”
“I understand.  It’s the same with my coffee shop.”
he thought. “Why not?” he heard himself say.
“I was in China.”
The centaur frowned at her and turned to Draco. “The Anggitay asks for your help.”
Parvati was bending over her, concern in her dark eyes.
Harry remembered Teddy requesting cherry flavour. And the potion delivery for Lavender, and Draco saying it was a busy time of month… It was all making sense.
Ron looked horrified. “No need to go looking for new recipes, Mum, we love your cooking just the way it is!”
“He’s improved it a lot,” Lavender said, coming in with a tray of tea and cake. “It made a big difference.”
All the people wishing to commission verse were accustoming Draco to a wider circle of human contact.  He decided to go to a Quidditch match, something he hadn’t done in ages.
Pansy laughed and shook her head.  “You’d be bored to tears. We have to go now, dear.  Do try and get out sometimes, and not just stare at that screen all day.  You may even find a heavenly body right here on earth.”
“Now tell me why you’re a monkey,” Draco said.
“And I thought she liked me,” Draco sighed.
There hadn’t been a cloud in the sky all day.
Draco raised his eyebrows.  “Is that frustrating?”
Harry managed a kind of a shrug.
On a stormy late afternoon in February, the little coffee shop Harry owned in Oxford was a warm and aromatic refuge, but most people were trying to hurry home before the snow got deeper.  Then the door was flung open and some idiot in a big furred hat and long grey cloak posed in the doorway, declaiming:
Surely their mother tried to be fair, but perhaps a laughing child is easier to love.  Or perhaps that’s just what a jealous child fears.
Harry could do that.  He could definitely do that.
“I have to visit my parents today; I promised my mother.  I don’t ... I don't suppose you’d want to come.” Draco shot him a quick look and then turned immediately to straighten his perfectly straight robes.
“There’s such a shortage of teachers in the rural schools – and of everything else.  Sometimes there’s barely enough chalk to go around, never mind textbooks.  And the students struggle because the classes are in English, which many of them don’t really understand very well.  Luckily they’re pretty well behaved, and the other teachers are friendly.  But I never really seem to know what I’m doing.”
“We can’t talk about that.”
It cocked its head and looked at Harry.  “Do you really want to stay
“You were SUPPOSED to KNOW.”
Draco pounded on the door.
The centaur was silent.  Draco met her dark eyes and flushed.
He signaled to her across the room and she glided over.
“What are you doing, Potter?”
“Yes,” Draco said, and then he was pulling Harry into his arms and they were kissing.
Now Potter was looking at his shoes.  “In a manner of speaking.”
“Well, congratulations, I guess,” Potter said. “Though I think it would be easier to live around if it were still mute.”

Unbearably aroused, Harry tore off his own clothes and launched himself at Draco, kissing, biting and sucking at jaw, earlobes, neck, murmuring, “Now?  Now?”
He found his glasses and crawled out of the tent. Looking toward the meadow he caught his breath.
Harry laughed and kissed him again. Draco pulled Harry down on top of himself and snogged him. “More,” he demanded. He held Harry close as they began to move against each other.
“…We may be able to wangle more mince pies out of it,” Draco finished, getting his cloak, scarf and mittens.
Harry gazed at his hand, open-mouthed.
“How did you learn so much about all this?” Harry asked.
Hermione shook her head.  “No, thank you, that’s quite all right.”
Later, after they had made it into bed and were lying quietly, Harry let himself ask.  “So – Luna, and Katie, and Bill…”
He flapped an apologetic arm at Draco’s thesis notes.
Prompt: Hogwarts Express.
“That’s it!” Padma said. “Mary Sidney Herbert, Countess of Pembroke. She must have married one of his descendants.”
“I forgot it might be nighttime here,” Harry said in a hushed voice. He pulled on his mittens against the cold.
“I like berries fine.  But you have to eat a lot of them to get full.”
“Yeah.  Well – maybe for that bit, anyway, you weren’t to blame, if you were doing the best you could.”  Harry himself couldn’t quite believe he was saying that.
Arthur’s head popped up. “Harry!” He hurried to meet Harry and then there were more delighted exclamations and questions. Finally Harry gestured to the car.
“You’re an artist?”
“Sure.”
As a child, Lily loved two children:  Sev, the friend who first opened up the wizarding world to her, and Tuney, the sister who could not follow her into that world.
“It’s a new appointment for me.  Of course, meeting with the centaurs themselves is a priority.”  He passed the paperwork through to show her.
“With black hair - silky, glossy, midnight black, and so soft.” Draco smiled, remembering the feel of it under his fingers.  “We look very well together.”
“You have my word.”
“Flavius Belby?”
Draco laughed a little.  “Give me a few minutes and I can help you with that.  But you get my mouth this time.  I haven’t forgotten I have a badge to research.  And snakes,” he darted a quick lick to Harry’s neck, “smell with their tongues.”
There was a little rustling in the bushes on the other side of the clearing and a child’s face appeared, a young brown-skinned girl with straight black hair, looking at him silently.  “Hello,” Draco said.  “What are you doing here?  Are you lost?  Do you need help?”
“So I’ll only have the living to worry about.  Great, now I just need a boat.  A private boat that takes owls.  What do you think, Gabriel?”
The white bear returned the following Thursday morning.  It ignored Harry’s aunt and uncle entirely and just looked at Harry.  He looked back into its clear grey eyes.
He tucked the sock tenderly into Harry’s trunk.  Then he put his arms around his odd, disheveled, grieving, loving, heroic and humble lover.
“After a mere, let's see, eighteen years…” Blaise drawled.
Potter looked startled and Draco remembered that there was only the one broom.  But Potter smiled.  What Seeker wouldn’t prefer the freedom of the spring skies to the claustrophobic squeeze of Apparition, given the choice?
He hadn’t done a thing about repairing the Vanishing Cabinet, or any other scheme for fulfilling Voldemort’s demand, since the
And then Draco was laughing, and Harry was laughing, and a jolt passed through him, warm as Draco’s eyes.
Narcissa must have felt the same.  “We have to say good-bye now, dear.  Mummy will come back and visit you again.”
“Potter!”  His eyes took on a speculative gleam.  “Wapping you might be rather entertaining at that.”
“Draco Malfoy is attending a Muggle university?”
Herman and the Mermen
Draco thought.
“A real aficionado, I see.”
The monkey looked at him and then at all the other people holding out food and shaking sticks.  It sat next to Harry in silence for a moment, and slipped its hand into Harry’s.  Then it jumped down and away.
“I’m saying you don’t have to try to be your dad.”
Malfoy stopped in his tracks, only his eyes moving to Harry’s face.
Potter hung about for a bit and finally left again with Lovegood, thanking them as he went for taking care of the injured Mooncalf.
“No, what do you think about us?  Can we….”  Harry turned a little, looking at Draco.  “Can I…”  He stroked a lock of hair back from Draco’s face, which was so close, so close and so open in the moonlight.
“Just pick a broom, Potter.”
At least, the two dapple-greys on the outside were galloping. The horse in the center seemed to be trotting. Holding the reins for all three of them, Draco had his hands full. But somehow he knew what to do, and the troika sleigh flew merrily over the snow in a landscape he’d never seen.
^(OvO)^
“You can’t tell me Malfoy Manor doesn’t have rosebushes.”
“Real concerts?”
“It is, actually.  McGonagall said I was to check in with the groundskeeper before I entered the forest.  Well, that’s done, so I’ll leave you in peace.  Ta-ta, Potter.”
“You look better with my glasses off, too,” Potter answered rudely, “I can’t see your face.”
“What was all that about?  Was your great-grandmother really a French Auror?”  Harry asked later.
“I’m writing a poem,” Miranda told him one afternoon.
“No, but I think I found something in the same family.”
“She adores you, she’s just misjudged your taste.  Let’s get some eggs.  You got tomatoes?”
He wanted to so much that he froze and excused himself, thanking them but waving his twig repair kit vaguely, as if fixing up his broom was too urgent to put off.
Draco hovered next to Harry in the air as the wind blew at them.  “Think of people making that, thousands of years ago.  And keeping it up, keeping the weeds from overgrowing it… Muggles do that.”
“If you’re referring to evolutionary theory, I’ve been assured that isn’t what it means at all.”
Over dinner, Harry and Ron talked about Quidditch, Auror cases and George's joke shop, while Draco and Hermione began a cautious discussion about politics and the most effective ways of approaching conservative purebloods.
“Adores you unquestionably but is never needy,” Pansy supplied.
Harry kissed him.  “Finally it’s fun to be the chosen one.”
Much of the path consisted of narrow, irregular stone steps. Harry paused to catch his breath after yet another set of them, and shook his head at a pair of carriers offering to take him up in a chair slung between two poles. “Do I look that helpless?” he asked Draco.
“I’ll wipe it off.”  Draco went to wipe his hand on the sheet, and then thought better of it.  He traced a circle around Potter’s navel, then smoothed his hand up Potter’s chest and rubbed and stroked across his nipples.  Potter’s mouth had fallen open and the look in his eyes was acting on Draco like a drug.  Potter turned toward him slightly.  There was the slightest bit of oil still on Draco’s hand.  He reached around and cupped the warm roundness of Potter’s arse, rubbing his hand against it.
“Oh very well, that shouldn’t take long,” said his aunt, taking the shirt and giving it to the princess.
“Pembroke?” Padma said. “Why does that sound familiar?”
“I do not speak her human language, but I can ask her in Houyhnhynm, the common language among creatures of the horse.”
“Harry!”  Teddy jumped out of bed and went running.
“Live it up.” Draco took out his Wyvern fountain pen, along with some parchment, and wrote
said his cynical side.
“I’m not greedy, Malfoy.  One man at a time.”
He thought of the past couple of months, of the connections he’d made and the help he’d received. McGonagall, Padma, Dean, Neville, Luna, Ron, the Anggitay, Hermione, Kastania….  And here he was in Harry’s arms.
curse?”  Draco cracked his eyes to see Snape holding his head in his hands.  He closed his eyes again, but he was restless until the next dose of pain potion was given.
“Yeah,” Harry said.  He’d spent a few months in France as Draco’s mind-healer, while Draco climbed back out of despair and an overwhelming sense of failure.  And though that time had cost Harry his engagement to Ginny, he thought that was for the best.  Ginny had seemed happier afterwards, returning to her Quidditch career, and Harry had emerged feeling lighter too.
“Wiltshire,” Malfoy said.  “About ten miles from where the Manor used to be.”  It had been destroyed in a fire, a couple of years after the war.  No one had lived there at the time.
He thought of a picture he had seen of his mother in her youth, before one sister left home, the other went mad, and she married his father.  In the photo she had smiled coyly, tossed her fair hair and laughed.  A pretty girl who liked pretty things.  She was more than that, of course, but that was part of who she was.
After they were gone, Draco realized he still didn’t know what had happened to his wand.  He asked Madame Pomfrey when she came in, and she said something about it being held for “safe-keeping”.  He was irritated and ignored her request to try wiggling his toes. Still, he managed to eat something, and then he looked out the window and watched the stars come out until he fell asleep.
“You will each have your own bedroom, I believe, with a bathroom attached,” Dumbledore said unperturbed.  “The room will not permit any harm to come to you.  It is capable of dampening harmful spells.  It may decide to impose curfews, however, or limit visitors.  It does what it thinks best, and its judgement is good.  Meanwhile, Draco, you are to first visit St Mungo’s for evaluation.  Your mother will be here to get you.”
“For driving you out of the country?”
“Because you have such powers of resistance?”
Harry snorted. “Meaning?”
“Come on Malfoy, I heard you.”
“I want to see Draco, and spend the night with him.”
“My new and improved eyesight showed me my broom looking all neglected, so I thought I’d go flying.”
“Sirius showed it to me.  My godfather.  But his name was burned out.”
The cat returned to sit next to Gabriel and Harry watched in astonishment as his owl gently stroked the black fur with his beak. “He’s grooming her.  Do you think this was love at first sight, or do you think they have a history together?”
“We’ll start with the shoulders, if you’ll unbutton the top of your robes,” Baines said.  “Lie on your stomach again, if you don’t mind.  Don’t crane your neck to look in the mirror, can’t you feel my hands on your shoulders?”
“No,” said Harry.  “Why should I?”
Harry reached the top of a hill and paused for breath and the view. He’d thought, after that miserable stay in the Forest of Dean, that he’d had enough of wild camping for a lifetime. But after the trials and funerals that filled the first few months after the war, he felt a need to get away, to be alone with nothing more pressing to do than walk and breathe and look at hills and trees and water and sky. So he’d found an old guidebook for wizarding walking tours and headed for Scotland, where freedom to roam the land was a traditionally recognized right. And now here he was, drinking in the clean air, the rose and orange colored clouds…
“You do! You like me!” Malfoy crowed. “Well, in that case you definitely have to stay alive, so that you can say nice things about me at my funeral.”
The light shifted in the room – the wind chasing clouds across the sun outdoors – and for a moment Harry seemed to see a different Draco Malfoy.  One who looked a bit sad, tired and uncertain –  one who could be hurt.  One who Harry didn’t, perhaps, want to hurt.
“Oh come now, we mustn’t be so picky,” Baines said.
The lassie agreed, and took the comb, and that night she let Harry into Draco’s bedroom again.
The bacon rind was tasty. The boys looked happy.
“I thought not,” said Murgatroyd.
“Thanks, Hermione.”
Oh.  That.
“Oh my god, Parvati, did you make shrikhand?” Padma said. “I love you. You have to try this, Harry.”
“And the poor defenseless baby bees!”
The Anggitay smiled at him and waved.  The jewels on her hands sparkled, and the bells on her anklets jingled as she turned to go.
Draco snorted.
A few minutes later, after talking with Lavender in the kitchen, Malfoy left. Harry turned to Ron. “Well, that was unexpected.” When Ron looked puzzled, Harry added, “Malfoy.”
“No, we have to ask him.  Malfoy, we finished your calves.  Healer Baines says we should work on your thighs.  It’s up to you.”
Harassing Potter was less interesting when he didn’t fight back, so Draco decided to shame him instead with a show of his superior knowledge, and they worked on their homework together for a while.
moved forward, the channel cleared and water appeared; behind them, it reverted to a weedy ditch. “How does that work?”
“Who knows how many mittens a Humdinger needs, if no one’s ever seen one?”
“Yes, I could go to Moaning Myrtle’s loo,” Draco snapped. “But the view is better here. And that spot is ruined for me. You might remember why.”
“He was a Seeker,” Malfoy said.
After he had recovered, Harry turned, loose and happy in his body, to smile at Draco.  He stroked Draco’s thigh, reached tentatively toward Draco’s erect cock.  “What do you want?”
“I wouldn’t count on that wand, Voldemort,” Draco said.  “It’s got a story you don’t know, a story of remorse.  You should have listened to Harry about that.”
And how could Harry give up this passion, this unexpected sweetness he’d found with Draco?
Harry hadn’t realised there was someone else there. Now he noticed the man standing in the doorway of the shed, quietly regarding him. It was, who else, Draco Malfoy. In blue jeans and a T-shirt, slightly grease-smudged, with his hair falling into his eyes, looking unfairly un-Malfoyish and attractive.
“At his house, I suppose, if he isn’t at his shop?” Hermione turned as the other woman stood abruptly and moved toward a door. Hermione’s hand shot out to grab her wrist and tug her gently closer. “Harry? Have you read the letters I sent?”
“Maybe Herman is not reaching his full growth yet,” Merfley said, giving Draco a reproachful look. “But he is brave to help his brothers and sisters.” He set the cauldron down gently on a nearby bench.
“No, I saw their pictures carved on some of the Pictish stones,” Thomas said.  “I was trying to get a sense of Scottish magical art history, and those stones go back at least to medieval times.  Beautiful animals on them, too, worth flying out to see.  They’re at Meigle, Aberlemno, Glamis…”
He raised the sheet to see his lover’s beautiful limbs.  “Who are you calling lewd?”
“I don’t know how you can live with a great nasty dirty bear,” his aunt said.
to prejudice.”
^(OvO)^
When they finally came out of the kiss they were both a bit flushed and rumpled.  And sitting on a Muggle park bench in public, Draco remembered, reddening further.  “Come on, let’s go back,” Harry said, taking his hand with a shy smile.
“And Ron?”
“Yeah! Because dragons are COOL!”
“All right, you win.”  He stroked her back.  “Let’s close the computer.  Should we go out to take the evening air?”
“And you haven’t taken it off?  Those birds are a menace.”
“They’re a kind of cattle, with humps and these gorgeous long curving horns,” Draco elaborated.  “People practically worship them.”
“There are similar problems everywhere; around the world, the spaces for nature magic are shrinking.”
There was a gorgeous polished stone called labradorite that shimmered midnight blue, crossed by a few black lines and white sparks, like a winter night sky seen through bare branches.  And a handful of vanilla beans, smelling dark, rich and heady.
The owl squawked indignantly.
Artemis nibbled the bit of bacon rind that Hedwig’s boy had thoughtfully offered, and watched indulgently as the two of them laughed and scuffled over the chocolate box.
“’Nuff talking,” said Harry.  “I can see that if I want any seducing done here I’ll have to do it myself.  I want to see
he thought.
“I want your hands all over me.  All over my skin.”
“I don’t understand you.  You’re their Boy Wonder, war hero, you could be cock of the walk, and here you are –”
“Recycling?  Good idea.  Oh no, I’m late for a meeting.  Stay in touch.”
Harry laughed a little, which seemed to relax him enough to let the tip of Draco’s cock in.  He gasped then, and clutched Draco’s bicep with one hand.
“Murgatroyd’s a fool,” Harry said.  “I may have hated you for years, but I ‘d never underestimate you.  You’ve always been persistent.  And creative.”
“Andromeda told me about the potion you made, and how much it helped him. I appreciate it.”
“He’d like it more if he could come along,” Draco said.
Wuffley was agreeable, so they set out the next morning.  It was a nice flight, as the weather was good.  When they arrived, though, the witch in charge made them lock up their brooms outside.  Potter’s face fell, and Draco knew his own did too.
“My turn,” Harry said, taking the mistletoe and holding it over Draco’s head. He wrapped his other arm around Draco’s waist and kissed him again.
Draco turned to the speaker. Harry Potter was in the sleigh with him, wearing a fur-trimmed cloak, high boots, and – armour?
Oh Merlin, did Potter think he still lived at the Manor?  Draco grabbed his broom and Disapparated.
“Think of it as preliminary research,” Draco said. “A scouting trip.  Even if this is mostly a holiday, you deserve one.”
Draco blinked at him.  His capacity for quick repartee seemed to have vanished along with his owl.
Malfoy’s eyes held his own.  “Look at
“H.E.L.L.?  That must be one of Granger’s projects.  No offense to your friend, Harry, but she has an unhappy genius for acronyms.”
“Do you feel alright?” Harry asked in a low voice.
“What?  No, I don’t think so.  This scar-head keeps saving my life today.  He’s got a hero complex I think.  Damned if I know what I’m doing here though.”
Gabriel blinked at him, and then his eyelids lowered.  He tucked in his chin and settled his feathers.
Draco gave him a keen look, then shook his head. “I didn’t do anything I didn’t want to do.”
“She’s Teddy’s grandmother.”
Harry felt an odd current of excitement. “Here all night making excuses?” His voice had turned husky. “Or kissing?”
“Oh, you never seemed to care what I said about you.” Malfoy half-smiled.  “But are there no words you want to take back, perfect Potter?”
For his family’s survival, he threatened his Headmaster.  Dumbledore offered another way, too late for either of them.
“I don’t know,” Draco says, walks away.
“Where would be the fun in that?” Malfoy said, handing his broom to the young broom-check wizard in exchange for a token.
“That’s not where I come, or how I come,” Draco told him. “But everywhere I feel, I feel you. Don’t you dare doubt that this is real for me.”
He untucked the net enough to reach out for his glasses.  When he could see clearly again, he groaned.  The net had several tears and small holes, and one big gaping one.  It was worse than useless.  Back in England he could have used a
“You went back into the Forbidden Forest day after day.  That’s not luck, that’s doggedness.  Most people avoid that place.”
The garter snake became quite animated when Harry spoke to it and there was a lot of hissing back and forth.  It looked more eager than angry.
“Sit with me at breakfast, in the Great Hall?”
Draco stared at him.  “Some of us don’t have other options.”  He turned to leave.
“He was a
The procession of sumo wrestlers had their hair in topknots, bare chests, and impressive bellies cradled by colorful aprons that fell past their knees.  Each had a unique, ornately embroidered design: a dragon, a flag, a mountain, and on one baby-faced swaggerer, cherry blossoms.
And he taught it to
“Remind me how you got into appliance repair.”
“No!  Oh – oh god – oh….”
“Hello,” Potter said.  “How have you been?”
Her energy was contagious.  Draco considered.  “Perhaps we could encourage more transfiguration and less use of vanishing spells?”
“She says many of the reasons why people cut the forests are to do with money, and the coming and going of money crosses many borders.”
So much potential in these two young men. If they could only work together instead of being at loggerheads!  Salazar and Godric were best friends, once.  If we could emphasize cooperation rather than divisions, as I tried to tell everyone a few years ago?
Turning toward that light.
“When I was eleven?  And what, I scarred you for life?”   Harry scoffed, before remembering that glimpse of a thin line slanting across Malfoy’s chest.  Apparently, in fact, he had.
“How’s your cat?” Harry said.
“Why aren’t you?  Bear-naked!”
“Draco,” Andromeda said, “I’m so sorry to bother you, but something has come up suddenly.  Could you watch Teddy this evening?  Come over and give him his supper and put him to bed?  I have to go out and won’t be back until late.”
Was there anything she could have done?  To make peace between James and Severus, to keep Severus from the dark road he’d taken?  She does not know what.
To find words for his want was more than Harry could do. He was getting cold and shaky again. He drew Malfoy closer; that was better. He closed his eyes, rubbing his cheek against Malfoy’s like a cat, and heard him catch his breath. Then he felt that unsteady breath warm against his skin. Harry pressed a little closer. A slow pulse of desire began to beat in him. He brushed his mouth over Draco’s.
Potter’s expression changed as he realised Draco was serious. He looked searchingly at Draco, and Draco couldn’t muster up his usual cool protective shell. He had been kissing this man,
“Who knows where the bottom of this lake is?” Harry said.  “Remember how the boat from Durmstrang just came up from beneath the water?”
“Let’s hope.”  She smiled again.  “Goodbye.”
8888888
“Any part. So why don’t you tell your father to stuff it? What can he do?”
Draco was trying to hold onto Harry, brace himself in a boatful of slippery fish, and thwack at the Kraken with an oar. “Let
That did not appear to reassure Potter.
The next morning when Harry awoke he was alone in the bed.  He found some clean, nice clothes and put them on, and they actually fit him.  Following the smell of something good, he found his way to the room with the dining table, which was again covered with all kinds of foods that tasted much better than anything he’d ever eaten at his aunt and uncle’s house.
“Of course I read the cards.  How do you think I learned wizarding history?  Certainly wasn’t from Binns.”  Potter sat and tore into his packet.
Naps could wait. Draco rolled close to his lover and pulled him down onto his lap.
Charlie Weasley’s smile paused when he heard the name. His eyes searched Draco’s, but finally he nodded and held out his hand. “Always good to meet another dragon aficionado.”
“Yeah, I have to renew the bird-poo protection charms often, but it’s worth it.  Don’t leave anything shiny laying about, she’s a thief, aren’t you, Cassia?”  Padma smiled with amused affection at her bird.  “Did you ever get another owl, Harry?”
“Yeah, maybe,” Harry said.  “Thanks, Hermione.  Can I talk to Ron?”
Harry cocked his head and regarded Draco for a moment.  A mischievous light came into his eyes.  “Want to?”
“More than that, it makes me think… nowadays we take magic for granted, take animals for granted, we’ve forgot how to feel awe.”
“Have you ever kissed one?” Harry asked.
of your arguments.” He bucked up against Harry for emphasis. “I think you should continue to
Was she testing Draco for anti-Muggle sentiment? “What an inventive substitute for a Stinging Hex.”
“Looking at the stars, what else.”
They walked to a quiet spot and sat on the sand together.  The sun came out and the breeze died down, and Harry took off his shirt.   He closed his eyes and a smile spread across his face.
“I wasn’t trying to, you know, wank in your bed.  It was a dream, I didn’t have any control.”
Startled, Harry laughed.
“Is that what you did, got a big dictionary and memorized all the words that start with cock, so you could use them on me?”
“My mother was quite insistent on good posture.  I don’t have the neck muscles to do this for long, though. Oh look, a chip stand – carry the basket and I’ll feed you chips.”
Back inside the cave, she breathed in her mate’s scent so that she would know it again. They had a melodic conversation and she let the tones of that voice reverberate in her heart.  She bent down to nuzzle a baby….
“Yeah, I’ve been pretty happy lately.  I do miss you two, though.  I have a favour to ask.  I’d like you to come to dinner -”
“I was a gifted child.”
“Hmm.  Flattering mirror.  See, we’re getting laugh lines, not frown lines.”
“The Find Your Partner Charm, or maybe it was Find Your Mate.”
It was warmer at the lower elevation and Harry decided to hike in shorts.  They were almost at the end of the hike.  Draco stopped to look at another rare plant, telling Harry he would catch up.  As he walked, Harry ate the last of his snacks to lighten his pack.
“No, Greg, wait!  Please stop and explain,” Draco said.  “You’re destroying the roof, not to mention the garden, and you know this isn’t even my house.  I’m just renting.  What is Luna going to say?”
Gabriel screeched, but quieted after the cloth covering was on.  Harry placed a call to let Malfoy know he was coming.
“Well, it’s a tall order to take on single-handedly.”  Malfoy seemed to take a deep breath, then moved to go on up the path.  “Been lovely chatting with you, but I have to get out of this sun.”
“So when I went to France to see Pansy, and to Italy to see Blaise, and they seemed to be just trying to transfer the same pure-blood social world there – I didn’t really want to be part of it.  I didn’t know what I did want to do – I didn’t have a career prepared.  My parents had some money in European banks, so I could get by if I was careful.  One day in Italy I thought, I’d like to see the Sphinx.  And then I thought, why not?  So I went to Egypt.  And from there, I thought I’d like to see dragons in China – they’re creatures of water there, not fire, you know.  So I went to China.  And it turns out that I’m actually a pretty good traveler – I like languages, so that helps.  And each place I went, I’d hear about something else, somewhere else that I was curious to see.  It kept me going.”
The dance ended with them standing in each other’s arms, a little short of breath, swaying together.
He explained to Potter that it was a narrowboat, used for canals and rivers.  “It originally belonged to my many-times great aunt Winonia Malfoy, a very independent witch and a bit of a black sheep in the family.  She got it when she and her boat-elf, Wufflina I, retired from the seafaring life.  It was the heyday of British canals then. She probably used it for smuggling.”
As the hometown of such an illustrious Quidditch team, Moose Jaw received a lot of wizard tourists, and Harry had no trouble finding a place to book a Portkey to San Francisco.  On arrival, they took their garter snake friend to his home grounds at the seashore at Point Reyes and said goodbye.  He thanked them for the adventure and told them they would always find a friend among the garter snakes of San Francisco if they mentioned his name, Ssschxthssthss.  Draco was sorry to see him go.  His company had revived Draco’s love of snakes, making the nightmare memories of Nagini recede.  Draco suspected Harry felt the same way.
Mystified, but feeling it was unwise to refuse, Draco wrote back agreeing.
“Why should I have?”
“Seaweed, that’s it! I bet we need to put it in water to be able to read it, just like you need to be underwater to understand spoken Mermish.” Harry filled a bowl with water and dropped the square in. It slowly expanded and the scratches on the surface became words.
“Oh, it’s your
“Oh, I will, I will.”
“So what will you do when you go back?”
Relief washed over him and he shut his eyes.  When he opened them, Dumbledore had slid further down the wall.  “Sir?” Draco said, wheeling closer.  Dumbledore’s wand made him vaguely nervous, and he handed it back.  “Your wand, sir.  Are you all right?”
“There’s nowhere I’d rather be.”
A snorkeler was coming back in to shore, with slow kicks of lean pale legs.   Likely to burn badly in the African sun with that complexion, Harry thought idly.  Haven’t seen anyone that pale since…. The man, young, was standing now, splashing up the last few steps onto the beach.  He pulled the mask off an angular face, shaking lake water from the lightest of blond hair, more glistening drops running slantwise on a chest faintly slashed by a long jagged scar.  Harry’s jaw dropped as his worlds collided.
“You could see me as a beekeeper?”
“How come I got stuck in here when you’re the one who sliced me open and left me to die?”
Feeling rested, she decided to head back toward England and look for Potter at home.  She sensed that was the right direction.  The wind was against her though, and slowed her progress.  Eventually she neared the coast, becoming ever surer of Potter’s location in England, when suddenly he shifted again.  Gone from England, turning up… back on the Continent, but even further east!
“Thank you!” Harry said. “I would be very grateful if you could!”
The bite in Malfoy’s voice did not curb the jolt of desire Harry was feeling.
Harry went in, but when he turned to look, the bear was gone.  Inside the hall was a long table laden with food but set for only one. Harry didn’t see anyone else, so he sat down alone. Everything he tasted was delicious, and the dishes were never empty. He ate until he was full.
True, they’d avoided any discussion about their families, or reminiscences about school, or the war.  But it was a beginning.  And Ron hadn’t flat out refused to do it again.  Harry wondered at his good fortune.
He sighed and faced Draco. “What was it you said? Apologies aren’t adequate? But I’m sorry.”
Malfoy stepped back, eyes still on Harry.  “If you’ll excuse me…”
Harry thought, and stepped forward.  They turned to leave together.

They sulked separately for a while, but that was boring, so they explored the woods around the castle together.  Harry returned to the castle for meals.  He never saw bear Draco inside the castle, and he never saw human Draco at all, because Draco only came to Harry’s bed in the dark.
“Where Fern goes, I go,” said Malfoy.  “She could never scratch her chin properly on those round eyeglass frames of yours, Potter.”
Inside again, Harry hurried to find a candle and match while he could still see.  “Sorry it’s a bit of a mess,” he said, entering the little living room.  The wavering candle flame showed Draco sitting on one of the woven reed chairs with Kili purring on his lap, a small warm smile on his face.  A sudden, unexpected happiness caught Harry by the throat.
.  The rhyme was forced, in her opinion.  The longer poem was more pleasing, plus it had quite a bit about birds in the middle part, and the parchment was better quality.
Draco bowed slightly. “Greetings.  I have brought you something.”  He held out a small flowering centaury plant.  “I brought it from a hillside in Uffington.  My friend – my loved one – and I flew out to see the great White Horse there.”
“Bad dream.”
Draco was silent for a moment.  “Alright, so I was a horrible person.  Are you satisfied?
Draco smiled again and looked down at his feet. His cheeks were pink. “It can wait a little.”
“No,” Draco said, intrigued. “I’d love to see that.  We can’t possibly bring a cat and an owl to a rare small bird sanctuary, though.”
“Right, as though Mr Weasley would ever do anything to help me.”
“No.” Of course not. “But I stay right here,” Potter continued.  “And I was sort of, er, involved in the accident, so I’d like to help.”
❄     ❄     ❄
The mirror stood unharmed.  In it, a younger Harry and Draco made love.  A look of wonder and bliss passed over Draco’s face as he came; then he relaxed and pulled Harry’s head to his chest.
“I’m Harry, and my philosophy has a pretty active imagination. Are you comfortable?”  Harry shifted a little.  “Here, you can lean back against me.”
Hermione sighed and pushed her hair back. “We’ll always care about each other, after all we went through together. But we’re better off with other partners.”
“Single malt whisky, right away,” she said.
“Harry Potter can be showing us all the steps, and we can practice with the Mooncalf!” said Merfley, who had joined them for lunch. His eyes were bright with enthusiasm.
Harry didn’t want stylish frames, he just wanted his trusty old glasses, so things could go back to normal - not that normal was all that great these days. So after he checked in at work and was told to take the rest of the day off, he Apparated back to the scene of the fight to have a look.  He found nothing, and the disgruntled fruit seller claimed not to have seen any spare spectacles lying about.
It flipped a dismissive paw in the direction of Harry’s cousin Dudley, who was trying unsuccessfully to hide behind Aunt Petunia.
“Potter.” Malfoy acknowledged him with a brief nod, smoothing his face.
Just then Molly called out something to Arthur and he stepped over to the house to talk with her. Harry was left with Malfoy and the vintage automobile.
He called Gabriel to him and the bird sailed down to land near his feet.  The cat ran through the grass and bounded straight over Gabriel’s head.
“Do you think wyverns can actually read?” Harry asked.
“No – not too fond of trapping and penning.  I travel.  I just came here to look at them.”
“What was that about?” one of the new owls asked.
Harry shrugged, trying to look nonchalant, to speak coolly.  “Let me know when you’ve decided what you want.”  He turned away.  From the corner of his eye, he thought he saw Malfoy’s smile falter.
Harry waited, but Draco didn’t continue.  “You’ve changed,” Harry said abruptly.  It came out sounding like an accusation.
“I guess we’ll have to bring Fern to keep you company, or you’ll both pine away.”
“That’s just it,” Draco said.  “You can’t always simply accept what others tell you, especially if what they say is… unkind.  See what people do.  And if you go wrong – try to right yourself.”
“Surely you’ve met?  Ignatius,” Malfoy called, then poked his head around a half-open door. “He’s not in the bedroom –”
here, Potter.”
Harry frowned. “Don’t do anything you don’t want to,” he said abruptly.
Salt spray hit his glasses and the small boat rocked under them as Draco Malfoy, wet, wind-whipped and pink-cheeked, poured a netful of live fish over Harry’s feet. The fish flopped around, filling the bottom of the little dory.
“Right.” Perhaps Arthur had got into too much trouble over the Anglia and didn’t want to share its secret. “Do you really know how to drive that thing? And does it actually run?”
“Maybe you’ve been stung by a Billywig, Draco,” said Luna. “I wonder if some have come over from Australia?”
“Sorry to bother you,” he began – damn, he’d forgotten the wand again – “but I was wondering.  How did you come to have my glasses that day?”
“He found you alright,” Potter said.
She looked startled, and Harry cursed himself for being ridiculous.  It must be obvious that he had no idea how to behave in pure-blood circles.  He’d never cared before, but he didn’t want to embarrass Draco.  But  Narcissa gave him a small warm smile that reminded him of her son, and welcomed them both inside.

“She says to thank you for the jewels, they are beautiful.  She has come from islands far away, called in your language the Philippines, a long journey as she travels by rainbow.”
But I won’t give up because you’re my dear.
A few months passed in this way.
How was Draco supposed to know what to wear, if he didn’t know what they’d be doing?

“We will send someone to help you with exercises to improve your upper body strength and training for independent living now that you are chair-bound.”
The world went blurry.  Then his own lenses, with their two tiny worlds of clarity, came slowly closer.  It was disorientating, and instinctively he shut his eyes.  Warm, dry fingers brushed his cheekbones again, and then Malfoy’s palms were against Harry’s cheeks as he carefully settled the glasses onto Harry’s nose.
Harry returned on the appointed date with Gabriel, his broom, some clean clothes, and a few other things.  “I brought some Muggle money, in case we need to do business with them along the way.”
Narcissa’s eyes had a sheen of tears.  Harry wondered where she had hidden this child when Voldemort took over the Manor.
“Why does no one ever talk to me that way?”  Malfoy asked idly, gazing at the ceiling.
They decided to leave the ice snake in the freezer and the garter snake in the attic, and head for New Guinea with the impatient python.  New Guinea being difficult to get around except by air, they brought their brooms along.
Who’ll be the real Hogwarts champion?
Malfoy stared.  “I’d forgotten that.” He shook his head.  “Doomed from the start, then.  To think my father hoped I’d make an ally of you.”
“Let’s nubbump, Boy-toy,” Draco growled in his ear, making Harry laugh outright.  His laugh turned into a gasp as Draco began to thrust against him, grabbing his arse and pulling him close.  Harry yanked at Draco’s trousers and managed to wrestle them down over his hips, then wriggled most of the way out of his own.  And then it was all delicious friction of skin against skin, harder and faster, until Harry was incoherent with passion and they came one after the other in explosive messy glory.
“Actually, I don’t think he did win.  That was sort of the point of me giving myself up.  He should be mortal now.”
“He told me he was going to a tavern to talk with some old sea-dogs.”
“Oi, Potter!  Heads up!” Greg called.
“But the garden…”
He went out to take his leave. It was awkward, with neither of them quite looking at the other.  Only when Harry turned back at the foot of the stairs did he catch a flash of Malfoy’s eyes, unexpectedly dark as they watched Harry go.
“Less talk,” Potter said, “more action.”  He leaned closer, paused, and then pressed a quick kiss to Draco’s lips.
“And you’re not hiding?  It sounds like you do an awful lot of traveling - you’re
Draco shrugged. “Disown me.”
Potter was limping as he got off the broom.  “My leg.  It’s nothing much.”
had an eventful youth.”
“I think I’ll just stick this note to a tree. Trying to send it by owl wouldn’t be safe for the owl, even if we’d thought to bring one. Of course I could fly it like those interdepartmental memos at the Ministry of Magic, but that might be annoying.”
Draco couldn’t help a smile.  “Speak for yourself, splendid monkey king.”
“Hello,” Draco said.  “Actually, this is my first time with them. I thought it would be helpful for me to learn more about magical horse-hybrids.”
The other wizards continued to wave farewell for a moment, which was silly, as Potter was clearly gone. (Rutherford would have heard him if he’d been under an Invisibility Cloak.)  She clacked her bill in irritation.  She hadn’t heard even the faintest pop of disapparition, which meant a Portkey, so he had probably gone far.
Potter shook his head.  “They keep to themselves, usually.  Of course, if you insult them loudly enough they may turn up to retaliate.  Take umbrage, as it were.”
“Yes, but all she could publish in her own name were translations. It wasn’t seemly for a gentlewoman to write original work.” Padma snorted.
Draco tried to back up his chair but Potter put a hand on the armrest.
“I think it’s me she’s laughing at.”
Harry holds the baby up to rest against his shoulder, and the green blanket falls back to show a shock of blond hair.   Unmistakably pale hair for a wizard, and memories swirl around Lily.
But the body next to his seemed closer to Harry’s own size, not a great big bear-shape.
In late afternoon they stopped at a large temple with a guesthouse and sat outside in a courtyard with other travelers, to rest before dinner.  A large monkey approached, moving from one guest to another, begging.  Some fed it snacks, some shook sticks at it, some did both.
“So, er, perhaps if I knew where in the forest the centaurs stayed, I could avoid stirring up the other denizens. Do you have any suggestions for finding them?”
What green eyes Potter had.
“Aye, Hedwig had a great heart.  She was a wise one, too, knew something about raising a boy, like you were then, Harry.  But now you know your way around.  You could help some newer owl, that’s still learning.  Give a younger one a chance.”
“I assume the issues are serious, then,” Draco said.  “If there is anything I can do…”
“I was trying to stay alive.  If I’d really been working for him, I would have told them they had you at the Manor, wouldn’t I?”
The moon had risen, nearly full. Merfley announced the Mooncalf Quadrille for anyone who wished to try it. Luna jumped up immediately. Her father invited Æthelflæd. Kingsley asked Professor McGonagall, and Harry tugged Draco. “Come on, Merfley says eight dancers make a set.” Hagrid said he’d watch.
Harry tried to explain. “The Hippogriff was hissing at him…”
“This really is a raven’s nest, then,” Harry said as the bird fixed him with an intelligent eye.
Here Draco couldn’t help singing aloud:
Draco snorted.  Did Potter think he was going to serenade escaped puffskeins or something?
“No, stupid.”
“Hello, Draco,” she said.  “It’s nice of you to come see the thestrals. I think they get lonely.”
“I’d make the most effective use of a brief opportunity.  Reforming my father’s character would take a bit longer.  Or perhaps you know a spell to eradicate one’s past beliefs?  It’s not so simple.”
Potter was no help, sitting and fidgeting and swirling his drink around in the glass.
“Do I know you?”
∞ 8 ∞
“No, wait,” Harry said. He shut his eyes and opened them again. “That night…”
“As if you ever did anything but break rules, Malfoy. But let’s try it again.”
“But the snakes, Kreacher….”
that dream.”
Gabriel shook out his tawny golden feathers and screeched.
“I’m leaving.  These people are incompetent.  Mother, let’s go.” His mother left the room with him, but when he demanded to go to the Manor, she demurred.
Draco had no answer. He smiled back and then found himself ducking his head. Draco kept his eyes on Herman, who seemed to be perking up. When Draco finally looked back up, Potter was gone.
“I wouldn’t have figured you for a star-gazer, Malfoy.”
“All right.  Bye then.”
“So.…”  Draco tried to follow the trail of house-elf logic.  “You thought if you kept our course from being smooth, we would find true love?”
₢⦿͡ ˒̫̮ ⦿͡ꀣ
“Why? You still don’t think Hermione deserves a place in wizarding Britain?” Potter’s voice was hard.
Now years later, alone in his room at the inn Harry dropped the book of poems, doused the light, and cast a
He couldn’t look at Harry, didn’t want to see the realization dawn.  He heard Harry’s intake of breath.
“Well,” said Draco.  “If it’s meditation that put such a spring in his step, maybe I should learn it.”
“She may be a half-blood, but she’s as smart as any Kneazle.”
Here again was the large entrance hall with the rich carpet and the ancestral portraits.  He would have to go into the drawing room too.
“Did it help?”
Harry’s cock throbbed.  His eyes stung, and he shut them.  “Harry?” Draco’s voice called softly.  Harry turned blindly toward the voice, his arms outstretched, pulled Draco in and kissed him.  Maybe he’d gone mad; maybe he’d fallen through the looking-glass; he didn’t care, the kiss was sweet as air to a drowning man.
Draco broke away and rolled toward the door.
Am I?  Harry wondered, as they reached Malfoy’s cabin and settled into the chairs outside.  But he had to defend the millipedes.  “They’re quite striking, actually.  And harmless.  They get to be about 6 inches long at the beginning of the rainy season, and they’re shiny black with all these feathery orange feet, and they glide along like some sleek modern train, with their legs rippling in and out in waves.”
For some reason Potter was laughing a little, which caught Weasley’s attention, and now he joined in. “Black, with yellow eyes, right? Kind of long-haired, wasn’t it, Hermione?”
– how could Draco have been so stupid?  True, he would rejoin his father at last, but Azkaban wasn’t where Draco had hoped to have their reunion.  And if that meant his mother was alone – Draco had no confidence that his Aunt Bellatrix would defend her against the Dark Lord’s displeasure.
“People would pester me on holiday, too.”
They saw a moose swimming, and some sea otters floating on their backs, and seals.  The garter snake had wrapped itself securely around Harry’s upper arm under his clothes, but occasionally poked its head out of his collar to take a look.
“How… is he?”
Murgatroyd snorted.  “Very clever.  But I won’t have you antagonizing a herd of centaurs at a school.  The students could be endangered.”
“This is where intuition comes in,” Harry said, taking out the wyvern billiard stick. “Can I be the Wyvern Warden?”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Draco snapped.
“I’d have uncursed you if I could,” Harry said quietly.  “I never meant to do that.  And you’re right, I didn’t much care what you said about me, except to Rita Skeeter.  When I was a prisoner in your house – what you didn’t say saved my life.”
“So he asked if I could possibly find someone else.  And there are so few people Teddy is really comfortable with….”
“You were no worse than he was,” Draco said. At least Potter had listened to him.  “Didn’t know you aspired to be a massage therapist, Potter.”
“What? Where?” Draco couldn’t imagine Æthelflæd sobbing. Could Merfley be nursing some secret sorrow? He followed Potter around the side of the Manor. Sure enough, there were heart-rending cries coming from a tangle of brambles that they hadn’t had time to clear. But who would hide in the middle of thorn bushes?
The wind rose a little, pushing at them.
Malfoy had frozen before the wand Harry was pointing at his face. “Adjust your
They walked outside into the mild evening air.  It was fragrant with blossoms.  A few stars had come out.
“I didn’t.”
They never hexed each other anymore, but surely teasing was allowed? Draco held the map behind his back. Potter lunged for it.  They dodged back and forth.  Potter  circled both arms around Draco.  For the sake of mischief, Draco kissed him.
“Why should I?  Are you going to pretend to be some new, innocent Draco Malfoy?”
“He claims he’s ‘off the market’ because he’s in love. With Harry Potter, no less. Well, he’s no son of mine!”
“I heard that Wolfsbane was a very difficult potion to make, and that not many people knew how.”
“I learn well by example,” Harry added.  “Hands-on experience, that sort of thing.”  He wiggled his foot a bit higher up the inside of Malfoy’s thigh.
Oddly enough, that earned him a wry half smile of acknowledgment.  Then something small, shiny and golden was flying at Harry’s head.  Reflexively he snatched it from the air, and found himself holding a wad of foil biscuit wrapper.   They didn’t make Snitches like they used to.
Draco stood aside to let the house-elf in, if only to shut the peacocks up.
Shortly afterwards Malfoy stepped out of the green flames with Gabriel in his cage, covered in a green cloth.
Snapped out of his reverie, Draco had to laugh.
“Never mind him.  You’ll be finished with that internship soon, right?  Meanwhile, you’ll get to escape him for a bit of holiday.  So where in China would you like us to go?”
“Isn’t that a marvelous book?” Padma said, coming from the back of the shop.  “I’ve decided to learn Sanskrit.  So much of my cultural heritage
“I am very very fine,” said Harry, springing up and pulling Draco to his feet. “Come.”
“We could take our shoes off and go wading,” Harry said.  “Get our feet wet in the Pacific.”
“That’s good too,” Draco murmured, playing with the dog’s hair.  Their fingers were touching.
“When did you get to be so encouraging, Draco Malfoy?”
“Did you hear yourself arrive?  That was the last battle,” Harry said.  “That was you swooping in to save the day.”
Draco frowned. “We are not amused, are we Old Timer?” The dog pushed his graying muzzle into Draco’s hand. “Someone there has a very juvenile sense of humor.”
“Exactly.”
“And you made my girlfriend laugh at me.”
Someone was shaking him.
“A bit hot and wet, but very worthwhile.”
“That song doesn’t even have a tune.”
Harry let out a long breath. “It’ll be a relief in some ways, not having to hide. Let’s show them we don’t care, then.”
“Is he threatening your family?  What is he trying to make you do?”
“I have a wand, Potter.  It’s – acceptable.  Did you think I went wandless all these years while I waited for you to decide I was worthy of getting mine back?  How do you think I fixed your glasses, among other things?”
“I’m the Golden Snitch?” Draco sounded amused.
Harry came through.
Potter started and looked up.  “Malfoy.”
Finally Harry pulled back to breathe, still poised above Draco. Was Draco still inside him?
“Oh, good.  And the one from Timbuktu?”
“For some of us.”
“’Potter Doesn’t Stink’?”
“Good luck to the Cannons,” Draco put in.  Weasley gave him a surprised smile before leaving.
Draco shook his head, then grinned.  “Of course, in the morning you might feel more energetic.”
Draco smiled at him, dimmed the lights and began the lilting melody.
“Yes.  I didn’t write it.”
Malfoy had just goaded him into coming out, Harry realised.  And then come out himself.  Abruptly Harry remembered where they were having this conversation about penises, bawdy medieval illustrations and gay orgies.  He glanced around his coffee shop, but the other customers were contentedly sipping or chatting or reading.  No one was looking their way.
Draco joined in, humming the lovely melody with him. Harry took his hand.
Only when it vanished did they turn back to the witch. “All right, maybe we would,” Potter said. “I understand. No brooms.”
“Let’s go and see Wilton House!” Padma said. “It’s probably possible to tour it. Harry, you invite Draco. You can all look for wyverns and I’ll wander the halls of a literary foremother.”
“You’re turned on by undulating millipede feet?  You are perverse, Potter.”
“So do I, and that wasn’t the question. Let me rephrase. I’m looking for someone new to beat at chess, Weasley, and your name has come up.”
“Known it would do that.”  Potter gestured to Draco’s legs.  He ducked his head and mumbled, “Known you.”
Rosemonde turned and brought them down again, where they could hear the Dark Lord jeering.  “Got a little cripple to be your nancy-boy, eh Potter?  Call that virtuous, do you?”
“You of all people dare to ask me how I am?  Not dead yet, Potter.  You’ll have to put off your celebration for awhile.”
He got a startled look in reply.
Potter shook his head.  “Now you sound like Hermione.  Do you really think all that book research is necessary?”
“You went to a Muggle library?”
“I believe Fern’s mother was pure Kneazle,” Malfoy was saying, “Outwardly, Fern looks like a particularly beautiful black cat, there’s nothing about her ears or tail that a Muggle would notice. But she’s as smart as anything. Definite magical instincts.”
“Cheating is a skill too, Potter.”
“An accomplished witch, I’m sure,” Draco offered.
With a silvery laugh, she was gone.
Draco stiffened. “I’m aware it may seem amusing to think a Malfoy could - ”
“Yeah, that’s a bit surprising,” said Potter. “She doesn’t seem like the fanciful type.”
By and by the horse brought him to a lassie with bushy brown hair who was sitting reading a book.
“Bold.  Quick.  That spark of independence.  Those gorgeous green eyes.”
“Oh no,” Harry said. “Ginny was so furious when she made that. I thought she got Molly to take it apart.” Molly had made one of her clocks that showed activities and locations instead of hours, thinking Ginny would want to know where Harry was at all times. Ginny had said it was a violation of privacy.
“I will.”

“Not prudent to appear less than fond of Harry Potter,” he had reprimanded Draco.  As if Potter hadn’t left Draco standing there like a fool with his hand stuck out.
Draco advised, looking up and smiling sweetly.
Another head yawned.
“Hmm, not much about them specifically, we don’t have any at the preserve. They’re smaller than your other dragons of course, just the two legs, no fire… Very protective of their territory, I’ve heard. Good at keeping down pests like Red Caps and Nogtails.”

“Are you going to make a Christmas present to make it feel better, Mum? Who’s going to deliver it, then?” Ron grinned.
“Kinky,” Draco murmured.
“Zebu.  They’re the real reason you went to Madagascar, aren’t they?  You just have a thing for the letter Z.”
Malfoy whooshed straight up and caught the very back bristles of Harry’s broom.  He crowed with triumph.
“Mmm.  Now that we’re not in such a hurry ” –  Draco sighed as Harry traced his collarbone with light fingers – “let’s recreate it.”
As he was leaving, Draco nearly collided with one of the Patil twins. The Ravenclaw, he thought, as he stooped to pick up a book that had slid off the stack in her arms.  It had fallen open to a painting of a winged cow with a woman’s head and what seemed to be a peacock’s tail.  He couldn’t read a thing on the page, though – he didn’t even recognize the script.
“What are you doing here?” Harry continued, still a bit dazed.  Malawi was poor, obscure, placid and friendly – nothing to interest a Malfoy.  Unless….  “How did you find me?” he added suspiciously.
Without thinking, Harry blocked his way. “No, you can’t just go!”
“Apparently Molly Weasley made –”
The infusion was ready. He took a sip and spat it out. It was shockingly bitter. He found himself thinking of Professor Snape.
“How did you know my name?”  Mira asked.
“It’s not
“I don’t want to see you either!” Draco snapped.
Harry decided not to talk about Draco with his aunt anymore.
Draco thought.  “This lotion is too much?”
“Yeah, but you laughed.”
And then Draco was getting hard again, and they began once more, to explore together what unguessed joys of the body they could unleash.
“It seems that in Chinese Astronomy, Centaurus is in the quadrants of the Azure Dragon of the East and the Vermilion Bird of the South, whereas Sagittarius stretches from the Azure Dragon of the East to the Black Tortoise of the North.  But I don’t really understand what that signifies.”
People came by to see Potter, and sometimes they ended up at Draco’s door instead, one of the room’s quirks.  Weasley came once when Potter was out, and hung about at loose ends long enough for Draco to use him to practice arm wrestling.  Weasley was happy to beat him and never guessed he was being used.   Ginevra Weasley came once or twice, supposedly to ask Potter about Quidditch strategy; she and Draco exchanged cool nods.

“And Pansy is the lassie for me!” cried the troll princess, and kissed the pug-nosed lassie.
“That looks like an interesting book,” he remarked. “Who is that a picture of?”
Harry remembered Fenrir Greyback at Malfoy Manor, and how tense and frightened Draco had been in his own home. How much they had all been through.
“News?” she said.
“Potter!”
“Try the headboard,” Draco said.  Holding it might be awkward.  “Can you make it bigger?”
“I leave it in your hands, Potter.”
Someone bumped into him from behind. Harry turned. Draco Malfoy was directly in back of him.
“All right – for which of my many misdeeds must I pay now?”
“Lady Godiva had the right idea,” Harry said, tugging at Draco’s trousers and then his own.  Draco peeled his shirt over his head.
“So we’re both going to close our eyes for a moment, and then…”
“Who, the speccy git?” Harry asked, laying between them and moving against him.
“Did Time-Turners even work?”
“Maybe feeling that you know what you’re doing is over-rated,” Draco commented, to Harry’s surprise.  “My father always seemed utterly confident,” he added somewhat bitterly, then looked thoughtful. “I imagine you’d be a good teacher of the right subject – that club of yours seemed quite effective.  Too bad you can’t teach Defence against the Dark Arts or coach Quidditch or something.”
The pleasure spread wherever Potter’s hands touched his skin.  When Potter worked below his waist, Draco imagined he felt a ghostly sensation there also, a fleeting connection.  He lay in a happy haze until he felt a warm palm on his back.
Rather to his own surprise, Harry found himself describing how after Voldemort’s defeat, feeling at loose ends and weary of his unwanted celebrity, he had wanted to get away from British wizarding society, see something of the world, do something quietly useful.  He had found a Muggle organization looking for overseas volunteers and requested to go to Africa.  It had sounded interesting and he’d heard of the many children orphaned by AIDS.  But his wizarding skills didn’t translate.  He wasn’t much use at Muggle health care or agriculture.  So they’d assigned him to be a teacher at a rural secondary school.
“I never thought of there being female centaurs in the forest,” Harry said.  “Though it stands to reason I guess.”
Draco cast a Muffliato. “After the War Commemoration, when you first asked to meet me, you had something on your mind, didn’t you?  And things kept coming up, and we never discussed it.”
Finally they reached the Kennet & Avon Canal, which connected boats all the way to Bristol.  Here the canal was clear and flowing, and full of Muggles living or holidaying on their boats.  There were towpaths, and nice pubs at the water’s edge.
Draco followed him on a tour of the house’s plumbing.  They didn’t find any more inside.  “I guess that’s all,” Harry said.
“No, her raven.  AWK! AWK!”
“It’s not all right.  He’s always asleep, and he won’t wake up.”
“They did, kind of, it was a bit odd.  Why?”
She has an image of love winding through the generations like bright streams of gold, from Violet through Lily herself into Harry, from Narcissa into Draco, merging and flowing into this little babe.  And she foresees the warm bright current flowing on into the future, into young ones yet unknown.
“I don’t really understand the magic, to be honest,” Malfoy said.  “But then, I’ve never fully understood how the ship from Durmstrang can come up through the Great Lake at Hogwarts, or how the Knight Bus seems to Apparate.  Wuffley can take this boat anywhere there was once a waterway, even if it’s changed course since then, or run dry, or gone underground.  When traveling that way, the boat is invisible to Muggles. It may be a form of time travel.”
“No.  It burns sometimes.”
a Manticore, Potter.”
“I don’t know,” Harry said.  Draco wouldn’t let Harry light a candle while they were together in the bedroom.
“Er – where’s the boat, then?  Which river or canal do we go to?”
“Sometimes it takes a dragon to outwit a dragon.”
It was late afternoon when they got off the bus and began to walk the last mile to Harry’s house, going steadily uphill.  There were few people on this particular road, but as they got closer they ran into a couple of students from Harry’s school, Madalitso and Lonjezo, who insisted on carrying some packages for them, balancing them on their heads as they walked.
“I could take you.  If you like.”
The boat lurched.  Draco leaned back, laughing shakily.  “You’re always rocking the boat, Harry Potter.”
“Are we really going to do it in the library?”
Draco explained what he had learned.
“You have the best words.  Me, I just plant pumpkins.”
“Sunbeams,” said Harry, reaching to let a few bright smooth strands slip through his fingers.
“Now,” he said, turning his attention back to Harry, “I was just beginning to get the
Draco looked out. The first snowfall of the winter—it was tempting. ”I didn’t think to bring gloves, though,” he said.
“So why would you want to cover for us?”
“Do you want me to get Æthelflæd?” Harry asked. Draco nodded.
Long-nose and Pug-nose make a pair,
“Yeah.  Well.  Enjoy your rice terraces,” said Harry dully.  He knew an excuse when he heard one.
“I can’t tell you, Potter.”
“I can teach you to make a Patronus, Draco.  But I agree on not wanting to stay awake and on guard all night.   We have safely delivered the tree python, so we can head home with a clear conscience.”
He flicked the crumpled biscuit wrapper back at Malfoy’s face.  It had all been simpler back on the Quidditch pitch. “God, I miss flying,” he sighed.  “Let’s go find some lunch.”
Draco scrawled out a few barely satisfactory lines but was still restless.  He stood up, calling his owl.
“Why would there even be a Manticore in Britain?” Harry asked. “Who told you this, anyhow?”
“Anyway, I appreciate it,” he repeated.
“Out to the next school over.  One of the teachers showed me around.  I asked about the name of the school.”
There was that gleam again.  “Generous of you to leave some men for the rest of us,” Malfoy murmured.
“Potter! POTTER!” he yelled, but got no response.  It was still difficult for him to transfer into his chair and get up, so he called out again.
“Father…”
Harry shook his head, but Ron had already turned back to Draco, whose mouth was twitching at the last comment.  “I bet you can’t find a rhyme for Hermione, anyway.”
Clearly a snowball fight was imminent. Draco pulled on the mittens.
He gazed out one of the windows as the sun set and the sky darkened. Below he could see Hagrid and Fang coming out of the Forbidden Forest and entering Hagrid’s hut.  A moment later a light glowed through Hagrid’s window.
“If you like,” Draco said with a sidelong smile.
“You have no idea.  Much good it does with you, though.  You’d make a rotten follower, Potter.”
“Sure,” Harry said, happy for the gentle teasing that signaled acceptance.
Trying to sense Potter’s location, she was distracted by odd bird-like vibrations coming from the witches with the long blonde hair, and more faintly from the children.  There were wings in their ancestry, she was sure of it.  The two men had nothing bird-like about them, though the tall one with the scarred face had the same type of red hair as some of Potter’s friends.
“That’s true,” Draco said.  He didn’t speak again until they reached the house, where he left the market bags by the door.  “I’m going for a walk.”
Draco did not have a date with Harry Potter to see theatre, or play Quidditch, or anything else.  Draco was not on a date at all.
Draco shook his head and made room on the bench, wondering.  “I didn’t think you lived around here,” he said finally.
“You’re starting to sound as mad as he does.”
Herman swam slowly about the cauldron, apparently still shaken by his experience.
“Yes, but I’m passing through.  You
“Since when are you interested in literary classics?”
And the great black cabinet, big enough for a person to stand in.  Did Draco hear something inside?  He reached for the handle.
“Oh, you must be exhausted! I forgot the time difference from China. Stay here tonight – I can Transfigure the couch into a bed for you, just a minute.”
Draco nodded.
“You can talk about tea.  I’d rather talk to Cassia.”
“It’s great to see everyone. I think the city’s starting to wear on me a little, though.”
When he touched the bell it rang softly, the dishes disappeared from the table, and Harry noticed a door he hadn’t seen before.  He passed through it and saw many splendid rooms with no one in them. Finally another door swung open and there was a silver tub, just the right size and full of hot water and soapy bubbles.
“For me?” Harry said doubtfully.
“And your bees are going to be all up in my rosebushes.  Zzzzzz,” Draco buzzed against the side of Harry’s neck.
There was a slightly awkward silence, and then Harry said, “That book was certainly a hit.  Where did you find it?”
“I read about them in a booklet I picked up when I flew out to look at the Pictish stones that Dean Thomas told me about.  The carvings were really interesting, you should see the Pictish Beast.  It has a long curving snout – or maybe it’s a duck-bill? –and some sort of back-curving horn or hair or antenna.  And curly feet.”

But the war was over now.
“But you were overcome by my incredible sexiness,” Draco finished for him.
Draco looked at him silently. Artemis shook out her feathers and Draco went over to where she was perched and stroked her. “It was that kind of a year,” he said. “I almost killed a number of people and I’m sorry about all of them.” He looked up. “We’re both still alive, though. Can we talk about something else?”
“And there are children.  The little one said I had funny legs and smelled good.  She ran away too.”
“That could be negotiated,” Draco said.
Harry nodded.  Could anyone with good vision know what a gesture of trust that was?  Everything went fuzzy as his glasses slid off, and then Draco’s face returned, close enough to be clear, against a blurry background.  Like a Muggle movie in romantic soft focus.  Harry grinned.
A mild breeze stirred Potter’s ever-tousled hair.  The May sunshine was warm on Draco’s skin, and the sky was blue.  “It’s a lovely day, really.  We could fly there,” Draco heard himself say.
“Yeah, that must be it.  The ink has run, though, and the parchment’s torn and stained. I really can’t read the rest.”
“That’s brilliant, Draco,” Harry said.  “The centaurs accept you…”
“There’s the rub.  The seeds are invisible too.”
Harry bent, now, to take Draco into his mouth.  Draco knew the feel of that warm wet mouth sucking his fingers, sucking his earlobes, and tried to imagine he could feel it now.  Harry’s warm hands on his sides were still in his range of feeling.  Draco reached his own hands out to touch the wild softness of Harry’s black hair and feel the rhythm of Harry’s head as he moved up and down.  The sight of Harry’s mouth around his cock, the look of tender absorption on Harry’s face, were doing something queer to Draco’s heart.
Some months later, an Owl arrived for them from Luna. Harry read it aloud over breakfast. “Dear Harry and Draco, I hope you are well and not troubled by Nargles. In my reading of interspecies independent journalism, I came across this clipping from the
“They must train post owls in the countryside somewhere,” Harry added.  “Maybe Gabriel grew up nearby, and they’re old friends reunited.”
“That was painfully clear – you looked horrified when you cracked your eyes enough to see me.  At least, you looked like you’d have been horrified if you could’ve summoned the energy.  ”
“Everything
Resigned, Harry handed over the stemware, followed Malfoy into a small living room bright with natural light, and sat on the sofa.  Malfoy began polishing Harry's eyeglasses with the tea towel.
Harry sighed. “So the fountain pen too?”
Then Draco said, “I’m sorry.  You shouldn’t have had to see that.  But now you know.”  He stood with an uncharacteristic slump.
Draco pressed his mouth to Harry’s ear and sang along into it.

The food was good though. “Does Parvati have a restaurant then? This is delicious,” Harry said.
“Good night.”
“Was there a question?”
Draco hurried upstairs.  The stunned snake in the tub was a striking combination of long black and blue stripes with a regular pattern of red splotches along the side.  “I think that’s a California Red-Sided Garter Snake, though the blue stripe is a bit unusual.  Gorgeous.  They’re harmless, unless you’re a frog or something like that.”
“Yes – but really people – Muggles – were often quite kind when I was lost or confused.  I guess they sort of expect it of travelers.  Actually, people were far kinder in places where I was a stranger than back in Britain where I was known.  It was – humbling.  But compared to horrifying, humiliating or heartbreaking, humbling isn’t so bad.”
Is that how it was for Severus, to look at Harry and see Lily’s eyes gazing out from the face of James?  Her dear brave exasperating James, who tormented Severus again and again in his thoughtless youth?
“Mortality,” Æthelflæd said, as gently as Harry had ever heard her.
“Oh?”  Pansy shot a look at Blaise.
A black horse’s head and front legs broke the surface of the lake and pawed the air.  Then the creature dove and its scaly black fishtail slapped the water with a splash.
Harry shucked off his mittens (wet but warm), felt around, wincing, and found his wand inside his jacket. It looked different from the wand he was used to, but it felt right and worked fine. He sat on the one large bed.
^(OvO)^
“No, Potter. What part of ‘arranged marriage’ don’t you understand?”
“Well, there is magic.  Themes like honour, chivalry, temptation, courage.  And then, he’s GREEN.”
“Stop the horses,” Potter said, and Draco slowed them to a halt. The acrid stink of dragon smoke was getting stronger, and the horses rolled their eyes and pranced nervously in place. Draco spoke soothingly to calm them. He risked gathering all the reins in one hand so that he could reach his wand.
“That’s my mother’s handwriting,” Draco said, looking over his shoulder. “It’s not a Howler, and she’s sent me extra chocolate. It’s probably safe.”
❄     ❄     ❄
That reminded Draco of a poem that had struck him recently, he wasn’t sure why.  It was in a borrowed book that he’d need to return soon.  Perhaps he should make a copy.
“She’s a librarian in Alaska,” Draco informed him.
“I wonder if that hairstyle would ever catch on in England.”
“Hmm.”  Hermione looked curious herself, but didn’t press it.  “You could ask a reference librarian.  They’re not all like Madam Pince, you know,” she added, seeing Harry’s less than enthusiastic expression.  “Or ask Padma Patil.  She’s opened a bookshop called The Raven’s Nest, and carries some things you’re not likely to find at Flourish and Blotts.  I have to stop by there this weekend to pick something up, you’re welcome to come with me.”
“Ridiculously sweet.”
“Well, I’m all in favor of touch,” Harry murmured, bending down to rub his nose into Draco’s hair.
“I’m sorry,” Malfoy said quietly. “For… well, clumsy jokes are the least of it.” When Harry looked back at him, Draco added, “I might not completely dislike you either. Mind you, I’m only telling you this because I’m about to die by Manticore anyway.”
“That’s about how hard I had to pull to get it from you,” Harry explained.  And then the wand was in Malfoy’s hand, shooting blue, green and silver sparks, and his face lit up with joy in a way Harry had never seen.
They continued talking about brooms, and then arguing about Quidditch teams, over their pints.  The pub was fairly busy – it was within Apparating distance of Stonehenge, after all  – but they sat outside and watched the light sparkle on the water.   It was all… easier than Draco could have expected a conversation with Potter to be.  But then, the topics were suited to small talk, and Draco was still in the dark about what Potter had originally wanted to discuss.  Let sleeping dogs lie, he told himself.
“I’m tired of living alone.”
This drabble was the seed for my later, longer story
They strode back in silence for a while.
Harry sensed that he was being tested. “How, er, ingenious.”
“That sounds like you fancy Theo Nott.”
“In the Shrieking Shack – let’s go then, quickly.”
It contained two packets of Chocolate Frogs, labeled
“It’s not disgusting, it’s nice,” Harry said.
Harry pulled the little badge from a pocket and tossed it over.  It flashed as it spun through the air.
Draco’s eyes took on that gleam of amusement that Harry was starting to recognise. He began to recite in rapid-fire rhythm:
Draco froze.
“But look at it.”
He sighed. “Well, Herman, I’m afraid you’ll be in the cauldron a little longer. I’ll ask Æthelflæd to check your health. Potter here turns out to be a squid safety sleuth, fortunately. I will start researching the proper salinity spells. Again, I am so sorry, and relieved to see you looking more like yourself.”
“You mean until the curse is better understood and its effects can be reversed?” Draco’s mother asked.
The child shook her head.  The bushes rustled again, and the child moved forward – on four horse’s legs.  Draco caught his breath, looking at a very young centaur.
you doing here in Malawi, Potter?”
“Yeah, but Ron, that means seeing Malfoy.”
“My cousin is Mr Potter’s godson,” Draco added, to Harry’s surprise.  It seemed to satisfy the students.
“Oh,” said Draco softly.  “You didn’t say.”
“Did you expect everything here to stay the same until you were ready to come back to it?”
“Hello,” Harry said. "I'm looking for a wizarding billiard stick, but no one seems to know where it is."
“That’s just your worldly vanity speaking,” Harry said.
Another current of feeling warms the room.  Lily notices the man lying in bed.  His disheveled hair gleams from the pillow, the same silver-blond as her grandchild’s.  He looks exhausted and content, and love beams from his grey eyes as if Harry and the baby are all that matters in the world.
“I – if you like,” Draco said.
“What?  Oh.  I suppose.  Anyway, when I came back I was even more restless.  So I left again. Sort of went on a quest.”
“Yeah, let’s go.”
“And if it’s ghosts, vampires, or zombies after you, I hear they can’t cross running water.”
“We’re monkeys,” Harry announced.
“Who wears night-shirts?” Harry muttered.  He left the night-shirt where it was and climbed into the bed.  It seemed very big after the cupboard he was used to at the Dursleys.  The candles went out by themselves, and he fell asleep.
“He’s the one who burnt the cakes, right?” Harry asked, a vague memory stirring.
“My father has arranged an alliance,” Draco explained.
“Well, we couldn’t exactly see it—they can become invisible at will, apparently. But we heard the humming and dinging. We left a few bites of pie for it.”
Draco’s body was thrown by the force of the spell and he screamed.  He was shaking.  It happened again.  Again.
“Same river, different water,” Draco said.
₢⦿͡ ˒̫̮ ⦿͡ꀣ
“Let me taste your untrousered wantonness,” Harry said.  He took his lover in his mouth and sucked until Draco was incoherent.
In the mirror Harry met Malfoy’s stormy grey eyes.
“Hello, sweetheart,” Narcissa said to the boy in the portrait.
“She says that as the forests are cut down, there are fewer places for magic to live.”
Potter looked blank.
Well, it was none of Draco’s business.
“Really?”
Harry gave a short laugh.  “And you say you’re not ambitious.”
Harry laid a light hand on Draco’s shoulder.  “We haven’t had a massage for a long time,” Harry said quietly.  “Must be past due for one.  Or do you want to take a bath?”
"We are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided."
Harry, hot, unbuttoned the top of his robes. Malfoy dipped the plume to tickle Harry’s collarbone.
Rutherford thought she’d like to see Harry Potter’s face when he received a good poem for a change.  She decided to wait, and do a little mousing in the meantime.  It was a bit awkward to hunt while carrying mail, but she’d had practice.
Just then the shopkeeper reappeared with the merchandise. As the other wizard was paying for his purchases, a familiar voice behind Draco called out, “Hello Charlie!  Ready to go and get some lunch?”
“This time?  I’d beat you every time, Malfoy.”
“How can I get to the castle, then?  I’ll follow and find you.”
“Alright,” Malfoy said.  “For your sake I un-sneer at Hagrid, and that hippogriff of his, and Granger and family.  Who else….  Longbottom, Lupin.  Satisfied?”
“Do I know you?”
A golden wyvern soared over the valley, gleaming in the sunlight.
but in Africa he didn’t use magic.  He’d come to get away from wizarding politics for a while, and he had no desire to run afoul of a witch-hunt here, where fear of magic was strong.  He could get by like a Muggle again for a couple of years, if it was the price of a peaceful life.
For the first time Harry noticed a house-elf standing in the stern of the boat, wearing a captain’s hat and a toga.  He had a grizzled beard and was smoking a pipe.
“What are…?”
“First patient?” Draco enquired.
“Hermione’s going out of town,” Ron said, as if realising a problem with the plan.
“Er…” Draco said.  He enjoyed his little cousin and hated to disappoint his aunt.  It was only a couple of years ago that he had mustered the nerve to meet her and tell her that he was sorry about the rift in the family.  But his meeting with Potter had been delayed so much already….
Harry  looked to Narcissa for help.  She flicked her eyes toward the door
