He then spent some time trying to think back to the last nine months of conversations and remember every time Harry mentioned Ginny.  All he could think recall were mentions of quidditch matches, birthday celebrations, and time spent at the Weasley family home, The Burrow, but nothing else came to mind.  He looked at the photos.  Ginny and Luna looked like the perfect couple.  From what he knew of Ginny, she would be a good match with Luna.
“I was born pretty early so my immune system and my lungs were a bit shit as a kid.” Draco shrugged, “My parents… I had two older siblings who didn’t survive to birth so they were overly protective anyway and the slightest hint of a cold had me confined to bed for a week.” He rolled his eyes.
"Yes daddy." Draco groaned, feeling sweat trickling down his neck and knowing he wasn't going to last long. He pulled out, patting at Potter's thigh until the man rolled over, drawing his legs up instantly and holding them there with his hands so that Draco could shove back inside him, the new angle making Potter yelp, his dick leaking precum on his stomach.
“I’ve already been invited.” Draco told him, sitting back down and looking so proud of himself that Harry almost laughed, he settled for smiling instead and commenting that he had known Draco’s charm would win Sirius over eventually. A shadow crossed Draco’s face at that and he didn’t reply making Harry frown but before he had had a chance to really question it the door opened and Sirius walked back in carrying two take-away coffee cups.
Sirius found himself wondering if the two ever discussed school, and their mutual dislike of each other, surely it wasn't a topic they could avoid but apart from a couple of jokes about McGonagall being a slave driver and Filch being the bane of their life the topic of Hogwarts wasn’t mentioned all evening. Probably deliberate to stop Sirius bringing up any past bullying he supposed and then felt bad.
“Said I would.” Draco said, leaning to give Harry a quick kiss, “I finish about five. Please try and avoid any dramatics until then.” He teased and Harry gave an exaggerated huff of irritation as Sirius chuckled.
Everything Potter had done, had said, last time had been so perfect and had felt so natural, usually any dirty talk Draco did on the app felt so stilted and awkward, with Draco having to prompt the other guy but not with Potter; Potter had been so automatic in his replies, from asking Draco if it was okay to touch himself to that picture of his lips. Even that goodbye snap had been so perfectly cheeky that Draco had laughed on recieving it, knowing that if this was more serious than just a bit of an online wank he would definitely have to punish the man for teasing him. He found himself wondering if Potter was into that, maybe he should suggest it, if the man ever fucking spoke to him again anyway.
Draco groaned, though he had no idea if it was the thought of Potter's mouth or his easy submission and he nodded sharply, trying to not look too desperate though sure he was failing. Potter curled his fingers into Draco's waistband and tugged the trousers down to his knees, visably swallowing at the sight of his dick now jutting out in front of him, "It's so big." Potter murmured, his lips so close to the head and Draco had to resist the urge of pushing forward and claim that beautiful mouth.  Instead he took a deep breathe and rested his hand on Potter's hair as the man finally leant forward and licked the tip.
“It hurt you too?” Sirius asked, feeling Remus behind him now, the man’s hand coming to rest on his back.
He looked up as Ron cleared his throat and the younger man grinned at him, taking a glass from the cupboard and filling it with water. “Alright Sirius? How’s Remus? Harry said the potion trial seemed positive.”
Hermione nodded, “I got your usual. But only just so there’s probably time to change it if…” She trailed off as Harry shook his head to tell her it was fine. “Why were you late?”
“No! No I… I just thought you might not want to stay… I… I want you here. With me.” Harry said, feeling his cheeks redden slightly at the admission.
Harry’s face clouded over and Sirius could feel Remus’ nail digging into his thigh, telling him to stop talking right now. “His name’s Draco. And yes I suppose Snape did teach him some stuff.” Harry muttered, scowling back down at his cup of tea. “But Draco likes potions for more than that, and he’s good at it because he tries hard.”
Potter swallowed, his eyes finally flickering up to meet Draco's properly as the man lowered his hand from his face "I want it so much" he said, his voice slightly hoarse, "Please."
“Sounds like a good idea.” Draco said, his voice soft and Harry looked up at him, seeing only understanding in his face.
He was deflecting and Harry could hear the tension in his voice but he let it go, laughing instead and making a mental note to thank Hermione. “I can squeeze up?”
"You are his world." Tonks murmured, "Sirius he loves you so, so much." Sirius nodded, not knowing what to say to that.
“That’s great!” Harry said, “It’s really… fun. You’ll have to survive a year with Nev first though!” He joked and Dennis laughed. “I’m glad you’re doing well.” Harry added quietly, “I was looking out for you at the memorial -”
“I cannot believe you are risking your safety. After everything we have done to keep you alive!” Remus said angrily and Harry felt himself snap; the anger he had bottled up pouring out now.
“I’m only upset because you are.” Remus said softly and Harry felt something untwist in his gut, “I know I haven’t been a very good guardian to you, or even a friend to be honest. But it was never about defeating Voldemort over keeping you safe. Never.” He continued when Harry tried to interrupt, to say that Remus had been great. “I don’t know what I did to make you think -”
“He was just a kid! He was fucking scared Sirius. Just like…” Harry trailed off then but Regulus’ name hung silently in the air between them sending a wave of pain through Sirius’ chest, “Just like the rest of us. Draco did what he had to do to keep his family alive. He is not a bad person.”
Sirius felt a lump rise in his throat at that and he rose from his chair, moving around the table to give the boy a hug, "Harry there is nothing you can do that would make me hate you. This love is utterly unconditional." He said, "Sometimes your actions or choices might surprise me, and we might disagree on things but I will always have so much love for you."
Draco felt his breathing quicken at how desperate the other man seemed, until he ruined it by adding
“Happy.” Ron interrupted, the hard tone of his voice sounding so different to usual and surprising Sirius momentarily, “and I don’t know about you but I have waited way too long to see that.” The redhead added quietly, dropping his glass into the sink as Harry reappeared in the doorway. “Okay?” Ron asked as he approached the man. “I’ll see you later.”
“I’m fine.” He said shortly, sounding anything but and the healer frowned at him for a moment before giving a small nod and moving back over to where his superior was scrawling in Harry's notes. Draco’s shoulders slumped, his jaw clenching as he stared down at Harry and Sirius wondered if he should say something, offer some words of support maybe, but before he had the chance the door opened and Tonks stepped inside.
“You could…” Draco says, his voice breaking. He breathes, tries again. “You could say them again. Now. I could hear them now.”
“Keep doing that and there’s not going to be any fucking,” Draco says, shocked at how raw his voice sounds.
“Oh, really?” Harry leans back, lets his head tip back to rest and his eyes close. The switch to nights for the next two weeks is kicking his ass. “That’s not what I heard.”
Harry opens his own knapsack, grabs his water, and drinks. He stuffs the bottle back in, pulls out two candy bars, and hands Malfoy one. Malfoy looks at it in surprise.
? "You saved my life the night they brought us here, and Hermione and Ron and Luna and Ollivander's life, too. Draco, I'm not trying to pull the 'Harry Potter' card for my own benefit at all, but... the fact that you saved my life? While that's immensely meaningful to me personally, it is also going to make one hell of a difference in the Wizengamot's decision to return your magic to you. How can I not help you? You've done nothing wrong, and they should have given you a trial three years ago instead of slapping this ridiculous punishment on you. I'm only sorry I wasn't more aware of the situation then. I'm very sorry, Draco."
"Good." Harry finished the task slowly, covering the area in a thick layer and placing a bit of gauze over it. When he was done, he wiped his hand on his pajama bottoms and avoided looking at Draco.
I don't find out immediately, because Potter's moving forward again, and this time he's definitely invaded my personal bubble. "I'm sorry I didn't give this back to you sooner," he says quietly. He presses the wand into my hand, his fingers resting on top of mine and I can't tell if the odd spark I feel is the fault of the wand, or because of Harry's warm skin moving over mine. All I know is that he lets go, and I let the wand fall to the floor. I move my hand forward again to take his hand in mine.
Both of them ran to the door, huddling against it and listening until the sound of footfalls had disappeared.
"You saved my life," Potter declares, shaking his head slowly from side to side as if he cannot possibly comprehend my ignorance in the matter. I feel faint. I feel as if the world has turned upside down since Potter entered my house. I
"Shut up for two seconds, will you? I'm not finished!" Harry angrily picked up a biscuit and bit off a chunk. "I saw you heading into Knockturn Alley, so I followed you under the cloak. I stood outside the store until you came out again, and then I went back to Ron and Hermione. I never told another living soul. I just wanted to make sure you were all right."
Rubbing his eyes, Draco sighed. "It would be best if you were mean to him. Show off or something. Anything to make him not like you."
None of which is easy to reconcile, really. None of it makes sense the way it should. I never noticed Potter until after he saved my life. I clung to him on that fucking broomstick and put my life quite literally in his hands, and he didn't let me down. Not in any respect did he fail me, unlike someone
He didn't see himself at first for all her youth and beauty, but eventually he noticed himself, walking next to but slightly behind his mother as they headed toward the robe shop.
"What?" Harry shifted away slightly. "As if I could honestly hide something from you, Mr. Legilimency."
The one thing Draco had to admit was that they had only asked the other to meet up before under dire circumstances and normally for a very distinct and unavoidable reason. The fact that they had parted on bad terms a month and a half ago convinced Draco that this was not just an underlying desire of Harry's to make up - that would not be an important enough reason all on its own in Harry's mind. Even if Harry had no intentions whatsoever of forgiving him, the reason he wanted to meet up was probably a very good one. In that case, it might be wise for Draco to go to him.
They were probably the reason he hadn't been affected by the blast, apart from the sound - he hadn't been more than twenty feet from the door, but he didn't have a scratch on him. Harry must have been just on the other side, frantic because Draco had disappeared, perhaps just pulling the Glamored Ron to his feet when…
He made it to seventeen before it dawned on him: there was a good chance his plan would save many of the people who would never have died had Harry been around. With a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach, he began to laugh at the notion that he might very well be saving the world, though he had only intended to save Harry. He was glad no one could hear him for how maniacal he sounded.
"I will be," Draco lied, scooting out of the booth and trying to smile for her. He wanted to tell her how much he loved her, and thank her for sticking by him through the worst of it all, but either declaration would have made his mother suspicious. When he stood, he settled for leaning over to kiss her soundly on the cheek. She smiled without looking up, fiddling inside her purse for something, and Draco walked away from the table before he let his face twist against the onslaught of emotion.
Constant. That's a good word to describe Potter, I decide. He's a constant kind of friend, a constant force, constantly good. Constantly surprising me. He seems stunned that I don't understand why, and that's a surprise, too.
"That's a little tight," he said to her when, at a flick of her wand, he felt his robes stretch uncomfortably across his chest.
He watched many of his former classmates walk by with their parents. An unimaginably young Pansy Parkinson appeared at one point, licking an ice cream cone from Florean's and walking with her mother and father, seemingly without a care in the world. Draco had to actually stand back when the Weasley clan stormed past, yelling and laughing and alive. In the world he had just left, there weren't any Weasleys left.
Draco got out of bed, naked as the day he had been born and shivering to the bone, and he began to pace. He made a low, loud guttural sound and pushed everything on top of his desk to the floor in one sudden swipe. Pulling out his leather desk chair he sat down, wrapped his arms around his knees, and wept.
After he watched the goblin place his envelope in a special, time-sealed safe, Draco returned to the little alleyway next to the robe shop. There was nothing in the alley but a couple of bins, so Draco knew he was relatively out of the way. He donned Harry's cloak again and stood by to wait.
Another difference between this kiss and all other ones they had shared was that there was a bed in the room instead of two cushy chairs. Draco was acutely aware of this difference as Harry's hands wandered up and down his back, one settling against the back of his neck and the other making its way much lower. Draco shivered, and he wrapped his arms tightly around Harry's waist and kissed him harder, opening his mouth and letting their tongues swirl against one another.
"Your father will be by to fetch you after he's done in Flourish and Blott's. You'll be lucky if he doesn't decide to send you to bed without supper," Narcissa warned.
Harry had given him the address years ago, just in case, and so he was one of the very few people able to find Harry Potter during the summer months. But he had never actually come here, not until it had come down to this. He regretted that now, walking around to the back of the house and staring up at the window on the left. It had to be Harry's, judging from the empty owl cage in plain view of the half-open window. The magic that Dumbledore had left behind made it impossible for Draco to Apparate inside, but it could not stop several well-aimed pebbles from striking the glass.
As he was getting dressed for the evening in his finest black robes, he tried to tell himself that things weren't actually that bad. That getting the Mark meant next to nothing, that it would merely be an outward token with the potential to afford him valuable information or put him in the right place at the right time. That it might actually be a good thing.
Before exiting the pub, Draco looked one more time at his mother. She was glancing at herself in her hand mirror and didn't appear concerned over his absence just yet, but very soon she would be. Draco was glad he wouldn't have to witness it.
"Draco Malfoy is your name, too?" Little Draco asked skeptically, but he hadn't taken his eyes off Draco's hair.
"Yes," Draco concluded, barely able to control his outrage. "Yes, I can clearly see how it is that you trust me! Really, very obvious. Wonderful demonstrations of trust!"
Harry lowered his own arms to drape around Draco's neck, and Draco felt something pull not in his stomach, but in a region a bit lower than that. Draco pulled his lips away from Harry's face and opened his eyes, startled to see the surprised green ones staring back at him.
are you doing this?" I finally turn back to look at him, and it doesn't seem that he's even faltered in his constant gaze.
Of course, he didn't see Harry at first. All he saw was Hagrid some several blocks away but getting closer with each passing second.
Harry again at all. They had met up only a couple of times during the year so far, both times after days Harry had had his lesson with Dumbledore. All four common rooms buzzed in contemplation of the so-called secret meetings of Harry and Dumbledore on those nights, and Draco had almost come to expect an owl from Harry the next day.
"If you put the candle inside it, everybody else in your vicinity will be in total darkness, you'll be the only one who can see… Harry, please…" Draco cried, reaching out to the area where he thought Harry might be. Harry grabbed it from him roughly, and Draco fell back against the wall.
Draco heard him running quickly down the corridor, towards the center of the castle where Draco was sure mayhem was already starting to occur. He could hear screaming, feel the familiar vibrations of dark magic.
Harry helped Draco remove his robe, and Harry sat up again, pulling Draco with him. Harry still straddled him, and Draco felt Harry's legs wrap around him, felt him rut once, twice against him, and Draco moaned deep in his throat, resting his forehead against Harry's bare shoulder.
But Harry's hand was running slowly up and down his back, anchoring him in place, and for some inexplicable reason, he thought of his mother, alone in a house filled with Death Eaters. Tears stung his eyes, but he clung to Harry, and for the first time that night did nothing to stop them from falling.
The slow slide of his lips as he eases my cock out of his mouth makes me want to scream. His tongue is fluttering all around the head and one of his hands is feeling its way between my cheeks at the same time. Just one finger is making teasingly slow circles around my opening and I spread my legs a little wider, sliding slightly farther down the wall.
He wants to meet me at the Leaky Cauldron, but I put a stop to that plan right away. Is he insane? Does he realize how ridiculously unsafe that would be for him, and more importantly, me? Without my magic, I don't leave the Manor very often. The last time I ventured to Gringotts for a meeting with the goblin in charge of the Malfoy account, I was abducted. Seven wizards barely out of Hogwarts forced me into an alley off the main street and if Potter and Weasley - not his best friend, but the lone twin - hadn't been sitting outside that deathtrap of a shop to witness the whole thing, and if they hadn't decided to intervene, I'd probably be dead.
The kiss was unlike the first experimental ones they had shared, and also unlike the emotion-driven kisses on the day Draco had since termed 'The End of Everything.' This kiss felt like it had been building ever since the moment Harry had run away from him. Though Draco hadn't consciously let himself wish for it or imagine he might have it, this had been all he wanted for a month and a half. The tension they had left in the little room with the biscuits would have continued building inside of Draco until the day it finally broke him. Draco, with his arms full of Harry Potter, was intensely grateful he would never end up knowing what that day felt like.
He didn't have very much time to get acquainted because Harry had started to stroke him. It took him a moment or two, but eventually Draco was able to mimic Harry's rhythm in a way that freed his mind, and he was simply able to feel and do without thinking too much about the mechanics.
representing me in court, which is a situation in which I can almost see no way in which he wouldn't win. The wizarding world still worships the ground he walks on, and it's also true that he doesn't pull the 'Harry Potter' card often. Merlin! He knows it, too, he knows the awesome power he has. And he wants to use that power for me. If he gets any closer to me, I'm afraid I might kiss him. I'm nearly drowning in positive energy, which is something I can honestly say I've never felt before. It's hard to stop myself from moving forward, but I manage it.
Draco looked around to be sure nobody would notice him appearing out of nowhere, but there wasn't anyone in his immediate vicinity. With a flourish, he removed the Invisibility Cloak and folded it carefully, placing it back inside his robe. Before entering the main street, he pulled his hood up, wincing at the memories the action sparked of the last time he had disguised himself this way.
"Don't worry. The house elves know better than to move or handle guest's personal items. It'll be fine," I assure him. "Are you all that hungry?"
"Thanks." Draco stood, wanting nothing more than to get out. He couldn't stand being in his aunt's presence more than was strictly necessary.
"Fine!" Draco heard himself exclaim, glaring up at Narcissa defiantly. He remembered the look of barely contained fury on his mother's face well.
The boy looked unsure for a moment, but then his eyes widened and he looked out the window briefly. "Do you mean Hagrid?"
Draco shut the door behind them and turned just in time to see Harry pulling off his cloak. The Room of Requirement had given them two cushy-looking chairs, a small table filled with plates of biscuits, two tall glasses of pumpkin juice, and a small lit fireplace. Everything was the same as the last two times but for the added delight of the biscuits and juice.
My hands drift between us again, and he stops, breathing heavily and pulling away slightly to see my face. "No one's going to walk in on us, are they?"
He hadn't expected to find Diagon Alley so drastically changed, though he supposed he should have. Most of the familiar shops were boarded up or in the process of closing, and there was a distinct level of fear in each flashing set of eyes Draco passed on the street. There was a collective sadness, as if thoughts of Harry and all that his loss had entailed were ringing through the air unbidden, unspoken, but on everybody's mind on this day.
He watches as Harry clambers up to the upper level of the platform seating and lays out a towel before settling himself in. Draco pulls the door shut, flips the timer, and tosses his towel next to Harry. They both like to start on the upper platform, moving lower when it gets to be too much.
“He’s alright,” Pomfrey says and Draco hears the sounds of tea being poured. “You know Harry. It’s going to take time for the curse to dissipate,” and wait a minute, what now?
Harry feels almost giddy. “So, if you look at me, and I look at you, and we’re both. Well.” He takes a breath. “Interested?”
“Oh, please,” Draco scoffs. “It’s obvious. The fluxweed must have interacted with the metal of the shears, and you reached into the cauldron to try and grab them, didn’t you. But,” here he frowns, “Pomfrey said you’d been cursed.”
There’s a long moment of silence from behind Malfoy’s curtains that has a very satisfied timbre to it, if a silence can be described that way, and then Harry hears rustling and stirrings, and Malfoy’s curtains open.
It’s a familiar-shaped box, and Draco’s heart starts to pound as he snaps it open, staring at the beauty within.
When Draco wakes up, it’s still early, that soft grey that means the sun is on the rise but has not yet appeared. It’s December 21st, Draco thinks, and it’s the Solstice. The shortest day, and the longest night. He rolls over and comes to rest against a warm shape that’s not much more than a lump under the covers. He wraps his arms around the snoring mass, which responds with a grumble and attempt to bury itself even deeper under the pillows.
Draco shuts the door behind him. It’s late, and the night is quiet and so dark. As Draco crests over the rise of the land and walks downhill towards the road, the lights of the Manor disappear behind him. It’s so clear tonight, and the glow of the full moon means he has no need for a Lumos just yet. He casts the incantation with one hand and jams the other in his pocket. With his wand trailing the gold and silver sparks of the spell, he walks.
“I love you,” Harry says quietly, and brings Draco’s hand up to kiss his fingers, one by one. “Always and forever.”
Because the Manor is the heart of their family, Draco focuses there next, letting himself drop down to the next level of connection. It rushes through him, the way it always does. The first few years after the War, this had been agonizing. At first, Draco had been violently sick and passed out, but as they’ve cleansed the house and grounds over the years, it’s gotten better and better. Now, the energy feels refreshingly cool, like a welcome breeze on a hot summer day, and Draco tastes something spicy and sweet. It changes depending on whether it’s Summer or Winter. It's a shock as Draco realizes, that as much as he dreads coming here, it's no longer the trial it once was.
“You should stay down,” he says and can’t help the sigh as Malfoy glares at him, in that familiar way. “What was I thinking? Of course not.”
Draco glares down at Harry even as he shifts forward in his very expensive desk chair with the incredible lumbar support, giving Harry more access. Draco knows exactly how powerful Harry is, and the control he’s developed over the years. The door isn’t closed and locked because Harry Potter did not want it closed and locked.
And now, here he is, so many years later. It astounds him even now, and he’s so thankful for the second chances he’s been given, to live in this future that he never imagined possible for himself. And if these nights are the price he pays, the penance he must continue to offer, well, Draco thinks as he shifts and settles, and looks up at the familiar stars, he’ll do it. Not gladly, but willingly.
The door closes with a soft click, and Harry is right back at it, only now he’s pressing into the heat of Draco’s body, not deep, just gentle, like a promise, even as he sucks hard, and Draco throws his head back and bites his lip as he comes. He comes hard, like he’s seventeen again, and he’s pretty sure he just came all over Harry’s Auror robes and possibly his face. It is, without a doubt, the hottest thing Draco’s ever experienced.
“You’ve missed me,” he says flatly, quite sure this is some joke at his expense. “Har bloody har, Potter.”
“I got this,” Harry says, bracing himself over Draco’s body with one arm. He swipes his free hand through the mess on Draco’s stomach, then grasps his dick, easing the slide with Draco’s own come, who’s watching this unfold with a grin.
Now they find their rhythm. Someone groans, long and low, and Harry realizes it’s him, realizes it when his lips part and Draco’s tongue finds his, generating a spark that flows from Harry’s mouth down his spine. Harry brings his other hand up and pulls off Draco’s beanie, wraps his hand around Draco’s head, pulls him closer, Draco’s hair silky beneath his fingers. The kiss shifts and there it is, the heat Harry’s always known lies between them, and that spark turns to flame.
This seems only to encourage Draco, who slides one leg in between Harry’s and Harry is shocked to realize he’s halfway to hard, pushed up against this shop window in downtown London. He’s pretty sure they need to get off the street
Malfoy sighs. “Neville said there’s a clearing about a two hours’ walk on the path, and he thinks it’s pretty likely there’ll be moonflowers there. They only bloom on the full moon, in full moonlight, so we’re in luck.”
The door closes behind them, and Harry looks around to see what the Room has provided. The space is cosy, with a thick carpet underfoot and candles in sconces on the walls. There’s not much in the way of furnishings, just a large brass bedframe pulled in front of the fireplace where flames flicker, and a bedside table to the far side.
He makes his way downstairs. When he’d remodelled, he’d pulled the kitchens out of the basement and onto the ground floor. The room is large and well-lit, even in the soft light of dawn, and Draco sits down at the large table he’d installed, to his mother’s horror —
Draco had had no idea. He’d had a nice lie-in, and had taken advantage of the warm weather to sit out on the patio with a really good muffin from that place around the corner from their flat and his enormous coffee mug. Harry always makes fun of that mug. The love of Draco’s life had been on the ground dying, and Draco had been eating a muffin.
It’s gotten better. Easier. While the holes the war left him will never really be filled, Harry is learning how to live right here and now, without the shadows of fear and violence over him. And with his future no longer prescribed for him, Harry realizes with a jolt of excitement, he’s free to figure it out. He glances at Malfoy, sitting curled up in the other corner of the couch. He’s casually dressed, well, Malfoy's version of casual, in a soft blue button-down and faded jeans, his blond hair flopping over one eye.
“What time did you get here?” Draco asks, turning his head to keep his nose from getting squished against Harry’s bony clavicle. He reaches up to pat Harry’s cheek and accidentally pokes him in the mouth. “Whoops, sorry.”
who is laughing at the story Harry is telling. He’s laughing so hard, in fact, that Harry has to steer him away from a table full of posh mums and their even posher babies.
“Yes, of course, ground-breaking research by Harry Potter, sexual proclivities tied to hair color, extra extra, read all about it.”
“What do you want?” Draco whispers, one hand falling to Harry’s hip to pull their bodies flush together.
Something bitter flashes across his face but the expression is gone before Harry can really make sense of it.
They’re pressed together now, chest to chest, thigh to thigh and Harry feels sparks skittering under the surface of his skin as Malfoy wraps his arms around him, hands sliding up under Harry’s shirt to drag blunt nails across his lower back, and Harry shudders, a low groan escaping him.
Draco groans, sits up, and kicks off his jeans. Harry reaches up and starts easing Draco’s pants down.
The air is thick with the smoke of missed hexes and curses, and he can smell them as they fly past him. Harry is somewhat hidden behind some huge piece of industrial equipment, its purpose entirely unfathomable to him. At least he’s got eyes on Malfoy, Harry thinks, who’s got his back pressed to the wall, sheltering behind his own unidentifiable pile of metal and rubber.
The walls of the maze are tall enough that it’s cool inside, but not so tall as to feel confining. Draco casts an anxious glance behind him. He really does not want to get lost, but there’s a mystery here and Draco really wants to solve it.
Harry rolls his eyes and starts to walk towards the hallway that leads to the bedrooms. “Not really, Hermione, but that’s never stopped me before. Maybe while Malfoy and I are flower-picking in the Forbidden Forest at fucking midnight, you could check out that bottle, see if it’s been cursed?”
, Potter? There’s no Bottle here, and I’ll take any consequence it gives me before I do something to you that you don’t want.”
“Harry,” Draco whispers, and his new truth, his new reality starts to take hold, and no matter how much he fights, how much he cries, it cannot be changed. He loves, he loves, he loves
“Fine.” He shrugs and pokes listlessly at the beautiful salad Keely has placed in front of him, and she shoots him a glare. “I don’t know, Draco. Can we talk about it later?”
Draco pulls himself out of the trance and blinks at Harry, who’s looking red-faced and sweaty. In the summer, they race out of the sauna to dive into the lake, but winter’s ritual is a bit more invigorating.
Draco leans forward, rests his elbows on the desk, and gives silent thanks for the ostentatious, mahogany monstrosity his predecessor had apparently insisted on. Harry fits just fine underneath, and the privacy panel extends all the way to the authentic Persian carpet. As long as Harry is quiet, Richardson won’t know what’s happening here.
Harry frowns, wonders if Malfoy overheard him getting off in the showers that morning, and then realizes what he’s referring to.
Harry’s not entirely sure he understands the rules of this game or where Luna even got this bottle. The bottle spins, and whoever it lands on, the bottle will ask a question, give a dare, or just simply order the victim to kiss someone. There’s no rhyme or reason Harry can understand, but it’s pretty funny. He sees Neville give Ron a quick kiss, laughs at Pavarati’s rendition of some muggle boyband’s big hit, watches as Hermione attempts a backbend, and ends up in a heap on the floor. Dean kisses Seamus. Pansy kisses Luna. Ginny snogs Nevile and it’s
“Harry’s worrying about saying no to Kingsley,” Ron mumbles from where he’s buried his face in Harry’s shoulder.
Harry looks up, and something sad and complicated crosses his face, but he doesn’t say anything, just walks into the bathroom to grab a towel. He’s silent as he pulls Draco’s sodden clothes off, roughly dries his hair and leads Draco back to bed.
And, like many a Saturday night, as the evening progresses, they turn to the Hogwarts version of Truth or Dare. Harry’s not entirely sure why they even bother anymore. The current seventh and eighth years are a pretty enmeshed group at this point, and he’s not sure how much more they really need to know of one another, but it can get pretty amusing.
Like now, for example. He’s just sort of hovering outside the teacher’s lounge and someone’s left the door open, so when Draco sees Madame Pomfrey walking towards the lounge, he immediately straightens his spine and marches past her, skidding to a halt as soon as she’s entered the room. He casts a quick
With Ginny, there’d been heat and anticipation threaded through with the terror of war, and Harry had always, always felt like she needed something from him that he just didn’t have to give. But now, as Malfoy shifts, turning his head slightly to adjust the angle of the kiss, Harry slides his hands up firm biceps and realizes that perhaps there’s nothing he has to prove here, no one he has to be other than simply… Harry. So he closes his eyes and lets himself sink into the moment and just
He opens his eyes and blinks at Hermione, who is watching him with an affectionate smile on her face.
He takes a deep breath through a throat that’s inexplicably thick, and feels tears prickling in his eyes.
It hasn’t escaped his notice that it’s not the hips and breasts of his female classmates that draw his gaze or fill his mind’s eyes when he jerks off in the shower in the morning. Rather, it’s the memory of a sharp jawline or the thought of that smattering of hair on the flat planes of a more masculine chest that make his breath catch and his toes curl as he hunches over himself, trying not to groan audibly as he comes.
Harry is torn between wanting Draco to come in his mouth and wanting to see, but the desire for the latter wins out, so as Draco gives a frantic moan and an involuntary thrust of hips and cries out, “Fuck, Harry, I’m coming…”, Harry pulls off and gives Draco one last firm tug and watches Draco fall apart.
Harry moves even closer, tucking his nose into Draco’s neck. Harry’s hand slides down because Harry Potter is a handsy fellow, and shamelessly takes any opportunity to put those hands all over Draco’s body.
“But,” Harry tries again and sputters when Dracos shuts him up by sticking his tongue down his throat.
They head back to the common room, followed by a crowd of people, including all of the 7th and 8th-year students, as well as McGonagall and Urkowitz, the new DADA professor. Ron explains as they go that the bottle had been cursed by Lola Flanagan, a sixth-year girl who’d transferred in from somewhere in Ireland that year. Apparently, Harry had turned her down in the fall, and she’d taken it poorly.
— and watches Keely bustling about, checking the eggs, turning the bacon. He smiles as a cup of coffee, light and sweet, just as he likes it, settles in front of him, and he wraps his hands around the sturdy pottery, savouring the warmth.
“Maybe,” Harry says, “You might be willing to…” he looks Draco up and down, eyes landing on the substantial bulge in Draco’s leggings. “Maybe you’d be willing to indulge me? In something
“You’re on, Potter,” Draco says, and he’s still laughing when Harry apparates them straight to his bed.
of dissatisfaction and then freezes, but there’s no sign from behind Malfoy’s curtains that he’s heard anything. It also appears that he’s forgotten to cast a silencing charm because Harry can hear him, quite clearly.
Draco turns back, and mimics Potter, lifting one eyebrow in silent question. Two can play that sardonic game, he thinks.
Now it’s time to walk the Manor. Harry seems to need to stick close this year. Sometimes he accompanies Draco, sometimes he doesn’t. Draco’s never been able to discern what changes from year to year. This year, though, Harry follows Draco up into the attic that spans the width of the building and watches as Draco pulls out his wand. The binding spell sparks gold and silver, and the opening words of the initial incantation come effortlessly now.
“Might be terrible,” Harry says, reaching down to wrap one hand around himself, jerking himself slowly.
Draco nips at Harry’s throat, drawing another frantic sound from Harry, a sound he’s pretty sure he’s never made before, and then Draco is sitting back and yanking Harry’s shirt up.
Draco laughs, steps away, and turns back, holding out a hand. “C’mon, Potter. Let’s go. I’m cold and tired, and I want a shower and bed. With you, preferably?”
want this.” He glances away and then meets Harry’s gaze determinedly. “Don’t you think it’s been long enough? Don’t make me wait any longer.”
“Yeah, like that,” he hears Malfoy breathe. “Then you cast your Lubrico,” and Harry hears him mutter the charm. “Wrap your hand around my cock, just like that.”
Draco rolls himself over so he’s lying flat on top of Harry, his hard cock pressing into Harry’s belly. He thrusts once, then again.
Harry frowns, brings to mind the face of a girl, pretty enough, he supposes, but not someone he’s ever given a second look to. He’s been too busy looking at Draco.
Harry stares at him and then takes the glass. He accidentally takes a significantly larger sip than he means to, and chokes on the strong flavor, the alcohol burning a path to his gut.
“Oh no,” Harry murmurs into Draco’s chest, sounding sleepy now. He manages to wave a hand, and the candles go out. “Whatever shall I do about that?”
“I trust you, Harry. With my life.” Draco swallows, refuses to look away. “You’ve already saved me. You won’t hurt me.”
“You’ve got nobody to blame for that but yourself,” he advises as he slides off of Harry and pulls himself to standing.
In any case, t’s such an odd feeling, to connect to something that’s so much older and larger than he is. Sometimes Draco can sense something that almost feels like affection and trust. The Manor knows that Draco will continue to care for it, and in return, it shelters and cares for him, as the last of the Malfoy line.
The Bottle continues. “The time limit for this dare is two hours and the timer begins in ten minutes.”
The curtains of his bed are open because if he closes them, then people will know he’s in there, and he doesn’t want anyone to know where he is, but he also doesn’t have the energy to go anywhere else. It’s a Hogsmeade day (not that the 8th years are bound by that anyway), and the 8th year dorms and common room are empty. Most people are either in the village or taking advantage of the unseasonably warm autumn day to be outside.
Harry is trying to be quiet, and sincerely hopes that Malfoy can’t hear him over the noises he’s making because fuck, this is good. This is
Harry tosses his coat towards the rack and kicks off his shoes. He slides onto the couch, tucks himself under the blanket and presses himself up against Draco, right where Draco likes him to be. And he hands Draco a bag.
Harry blinks in surprise as he hears Malfoy’s voice. Maybe this is something Malfoy does to get himself off? It would never occur to Harry to narrate what he does to himself, but, he thinks philosophically, it takes all kinds to make the world go round. Or come, in this case, as clearly Malfoy’s having a wank.
Harry reaches around blindly, pulls out a piece of paper from Malfoy’s back pocket, and unfolds it, reading over Malfoy’s shoulder. He squints at the elegant handwriting.
Harry pauses. “Truth,” he says finally, heart rate starting to rise in anticipation. “I’ll take Truth.”
It’s pitch dark, of course, and Draco is so thankful for Hermione, who’s introduced him to Muggle cold-weather gear, so he’s wearing a parka, warm hat, mitts, and a scarf wrapped twice around his face, as well as something Hermione called trail shoes but just look like beefed-up trainers to Draco.
Harry’s not even sure when it happens, he just knows that by the time he’s ushering Draco out of the cafe, it’s
He steps out from behind the flaming pile of metal and stomps forward, curses firing so fast from his wand that they light up the dim interior of the warehouse. He’s pretty sure he’s also simul-casting with both wand and non-wand hand, which isn’t even supposed to be possible, but Malfoy’s down, and Harry can’t hear him at all, and he needs this to be over.
He doesn’t even care that Hermione was holding her best friend while he bled out. He doesn’t care that she’s lost her heart’s center, same as he has. Draco knows, he’s so sure, that he’ll go to Harry, and Harry will be okay. He’ll be smirking that stupid fucking Gryffindor smirk that says he knows he’s played you, he’s gotten to you. Draco has loved Harry for close to twenty years, but he’ll be the first to admit, sometimes Harry can be an asshole.
“Fuck that,” Ron says, rolling off of Harry, over Hermione, and then onto the floor. He jumps to his feet, holds out a hand. “Let’s do it now. Owl him now, Harry. Be done with it.”
Potter freezes and Draco can hear him swallow, before he turns to face Draco and there’s an entirely new look on his face. “No,” he says quietly, “No wanking, not for days now.”
Harry feels Ron’s shrug. “Whatever you want, mate. Go to Oxford with Hermione. Come live with me and work at the shop. Go to America and shag your way across the Great Plains. You don’t even have to know now, we’ve still got six weeks until we graduate.”
Draco leans back against the glass, one eyebrow lifted in consideration, and behind him, Harry can see the posh mums turning around to see what’s going on.
“You really don’t have to come with me,” he says, placing one hand over Harry’s where it’s resting on the table.
The moment feels fragile, like some delicate, new balance has been established between them, and, Harry realizes, he doesn’t want it to happen like this, and he sure as hell doesn’t want to push Malfoy into anything he doesn’t want to do.
“Dunno,” Harry says, risking a peek out and hissing as something flashes by, a bit too close for comfort. “They don’t seem pleased to see us, though.”
Draco shifts, peers over the edge of the tree limb and looks back at Harry with wide eyes. “I think it fucking worked,” he whispers, and Harry leans over next to him.
“You’re touching me,” Malfoy says, “Just the way I like it. Gentle on my face, then you move your hands down my chest, and you’re kissing my neck. You know how much I love that.”
, even his pout sounds cute now, and Harry thinks blindly that he might be in real trouble. “Yes, you’re right. Talking. That’s good.” He leans back and fixes an expectant gaze on Harry.
“Shut up,” Harry mumbles. “I wasn’t going to be running anything. I’m fucking eighteen. Nobody in their right mind would put an eighteen-year-old in charge.”
“C’mon,” Malfoy hisses, pressing harder, “Check. My. Pocket.” He punctuates each word with a spectacular roll of his hips.
For now, though. They’re standing here together in the sunshine. As the medi team descents upon them, Harry looks at Draco, who’s looking back, the smile he saves just for Harry, saves just for these moments, playing on his lips.
“I was thinking,” Harry says, pulling his face into a pensive expression, “that if it were true, perhaps we could have breakfast.”
Draco has no sense of how much time has passed when he feels Harry’s hand on his knee, and Harry says softly, “The timer’s run out, love.”
He leans in, tangles his fingers in Draco’s hair, pulls him close, and kisses him with everything he’s feeling, everything he wants to say but can’t. Harry kisses Draco with gratitude that they’re not dead, with satisfaction at the pleasure they’ve just shared, and with hope that this isn’t the end of this moment, but that maybe, just maybe. It can be a beginning.
Written for the @drarrymicrofic prompt from July 16 (yeah I know, I’ve been caught up on other things) - “Curious”. Since @the-starryknight proposed this, I’ll say thank you to them as well, as this moment just sort of sprang fully-formed into my head. I’ll also thank @kingsofeverything and @tackytigerfic for the writing tags!!
“Well,” Harry says with a yawn, “Pansy told Ginny that Blaise told Luna that after I left pub night last week, you got drunk and told Ron how much you like me.”
He holds his hand out, trying to visualize the way McGonagall always tells him. She can’t figure out why he can’t do this. His power is off the charts, she’s told him, but there’s something that blocks him from accessing it without his wand.
He starts to move, wanting to get up and grab a warm cloth to wipe them both down, but Harry just pulls him close and kisses him. “Don’t go, not yet.”
They make their way to the kitchen and out the back door. From there it’s a short walk to the small cedar structure on the edge of the lake. Keely’s clearly already been here, as there’s a fire burning merrily on the hearth, and tea has been set out at the table. The sauna itself takes up the back half of the structure, and Draco knows Keely’s been in there as well, lighting the fires, setting out the ritual oils.
This is achingly gentle and sweet. Draco is hesitant, almost tentative, his lips soft as they sweep over Harry’s. Harry can feel every spot where they’re touching like an electric shock: legs pressed together, Harry’s hand on Draco’s knee to balance himself, Draco’s hand cupping Harry’s face. Their lips as they kiss again, and then again.
“Yeah,” Harry agrees and they stand silently for a long moment. “Do you have any idea where to start looking?”
“Might be a long time,” Harry says and Draco closes his eyes against the feelings that are flooding him. “Might be forever.”
“Harry will know where to find you in the morning?” Ron asks carefully, and Draco stares at him and then just nods.
“My mother,” Draco says finally. “She’d just come and sit with me when I was doing my lessons? Or, reading in the solarium. Sometimes she’d tell me about.” He pauses, takes a breath. “Flowers. The herbs in the kitchen garden. Like that.”
Harry reaches down, starts jacking himself off, hard and fast, even as he rolls his hips to meet Draco’s thrusts, even as he keeps calling out.
“Trust you,” Draco says affectionately, “To use your power and fucking wandless magic for jerking off and cleaning up.”
The thing chasing them has slowed down, almost as if it knows it’s got them now. Malfoy frantically boosts Harry up. Harry wraps his legs around the branch and reaches down to haul Malfoy up behind him.
“The things I want to do to you,” Harry breathes as he nips at the tender skin just under Draco’s ear. “The things I want you to do to me.”
He watches as Harry’s eyes close and his head tips back as Harry gives himself over to the sensation, his body relaxing and his legs dropping open. Draco decides this is an invitation to get closer, so he shifts himself around and leans down to shove up the pant leg of the loose track pants Harry is wearing, to start pressing kisses into Harry’s knee.
Draco turns and looks over the oils that Keely has set out. As always, she’s given him a range of options, and he takes a moment to check in with himself, to see what feels like the best fit for this particular solstice. He finally settles on frankincense and cedarwood. First, he dumps a ladle of water on the hot rocks of the heater, then lets a few drops from each bottle fall, the scent of the oils mixing with the steam that’s now billowing throughout the room.
Harry shifts, and then they’re pressed together, groin to groin, belly to belly, and Draco can’t help the cry that escapes him at the pressure, and his hips buck up, seeking even more of that delicious friction. Harry pulls back and Draco is stunned, because Harry looks as undone as Draco feels. His eyes are wild, his mouth red, his chest heaving.
“Are you fucking kidding me, Harry? I’ve been having detailed and explicit fantasies about being able to do whatever I want to you, and you just having to…” Draco licks his lips, “just lie there and take it. I’ve been thinking about it for months.
It’s not a fancy bag, just a small, plain brown paper bag with rough string handles. Draco frowns and gives Harry a quizzical look.
“I have an idea,” Draco says, sounding almost drunk. “Fuck, hold on, you gotta hold on, Harry, or I’m gonna come.”
“I’m gonna,” he pants, “Fuck, Draco, I’m gonna… You’re making me…” He moans again, as Draco does something with his tongue that seems to be particularly impactful, and Harry’s voice is high as he cries out, “I’m coming, Draco, I’m…” and then his back arches up and he
Draco doesn’t look up as a warm body slides into the booth next to him. He doesn’t look up as an arm is draped across his shoulders and he doesn’t look up when a hand reaches over to grab the whiskey glass and lift it to the interloper’s lips.
“Pomfrey has bonsais?” Draco asks, momentarily baffled, and then “Wait, you’ve gotten a lot done in just a few days.”
Potter shrugs, lifts one hand as if to run his fingers through his hair, something Draco knows he does when he’s uncomfortable. Potter yelps as he remembers his hands and drops his arm quickly.
He turns and follows the road. No words are needed now for this magic; it simply requires presence and intention. Draco intends to care for this land, this Manor, even if he can’t live here. As he walks, he thinks.
Draco reaches out and lifts Potter’s arm, tracing one finger down the inside of his forearm, marveling at the seamless joint between his living flesh and where his hands have been turned into scissors. Potter shivers under his touch.
Harry wraps his arms around Draco, takes a moment to rub his hands together to try and warm them up before he slips them up under Draco’s hoodie and the soft t-shirt he’s got underneath, until his fingers are splayed across the firm warmth of Draco’s stomach, which contracts under his touch.
He and Harry have been, well, dating really, for months now. There’s no other word for it. It’s been dinner engagements at magnificent restaurants in London and flowers the morning after. It’s been notes on parchment delivered by owl only hours after saying goodnight. It’s been late-night walks in the rain, and early morning runs followed by steaming hot coffee. It’s been laughter, and intense eye contact, and hair gently tucked behind an ear. Heated kisses on the doorstep that have gone no further.
The bottle lands on Malfoy and sends out its customary poof of smoke and sparks. Harry hasn’t quite figured out the pattern, it’s not like blue means truth and red means kissing. Malfoy’s poof is a deep pink-purple and there are definitely sparks happening as well. It’s really pretty, actually, and Harry sort of loses himself in watching the colors until suddenly he realizes everyone is quiet and staring at him.
He waves a lazy hand at his robes, and the stains disappear. Draco has to admit, he’s a bit disappointed, but also relieved. Draco carefully puts his own clothing to right and then looks back at Harry. He sighs, pulls out a handkerchief, and leans in closer, wiping Harry’s face clean.
He looks up to see Malfoy staring at him, but as soon as their eyes meet, Malfoy looks away, flushing.
He stares hard at Ron who is sitting across the circle from him until he catches Ron’s eye, who gives him a quizzical look.
Harry groans and lets his head lean back against the rough bark of the tree. “Well, that’s just fucking great, isn’t it.”
“Wandlessly?” Harry asks urgently and Draco nods again. “That’s so fucking hot,” Harry breathes and leans in to kiss Draco again.
“I want this,” Harry says finally, “With you. Not just because of that monster down there wanting to kill us or because of the threat of boils. Because I do. Want you. Did you know?”
As he walks, Draco reminds himself of all that he loves, all he stands for, and offers it back to this land that has sheltered him and protected him. It’s not the land’s fault that its people betrayed it, Draco thinks, as he does every Solstice. It’s not the land’s fault that it sheltered evil; that’s all on the humans who’ve lived here. Draco vows, as he does every Solstice, that it ends with him.
“Oh well,” Harry says cheerfully, “My mistake.” He gets up to head back out to do rounds. “That’s too bad, because if you did somehow like me, I was thinking…”
. No matter how much he wishes he could, Harry can’t go back in time and make it be different. He’s learned to ask Draco what he needs, though. Learned to listen, both to what Draco says and to his silences, and Harry’s come to understand what helps.
The pressure is exquisite, the knife’s edge between pleasure and pain, and Draco can barely think, wants to move, forces himself to hold still. He keeps his hand wrapped around Harry’s cock and tightens his grip, starts to slide his hand back and forth.
“I just,” Malfoy runs a hand through his messy hair and Harry feels almost smug at how wrecked he already looks. “Do you want this?”
Draco rolls his eyes and then gives Harry a smile that takes Harry’s breath away. “Harry. I want this. I want
After all, he’s blonde. Slender. He’s got a meticulous skincare routine and likes to get manicures. Sure, he’s a bit taller than Harry, but Harry is so powerful, so sturdy and strong. He strides down the street, and people just naturally get out of his way, he’s got that aura. So yeah, Draco made assumptions.
That Draco knows what Harry looks like when he’s wanting, that’s relatively new. That Harry Potter wants Draco Malfoy had been something of a surprise, something of a miracle actually, and Draco keeps waiting for the moment Harry wakes up. The moment where Harry laughs and says,
Draco doesn’t see much of Harry before lunch. He’s locked in the study with the lawyers and businessmen, and it’s the type of meeting that would have Harry punching himself in the face to relieve his boredom, so for everyone’s sake, it’s best that he’s off doing whatever it is that he does during Solstice Day while Draco attends to business.
Draco leans over and just before he pulls Harry’s hand off of his cock and replaces it with his mouth, he whispers, “Might even be good.”
.” Draco’s mouth moves down Harry’s neck to his collarbones and then he moves his leg purposefully in a way that’s just about guaranteed to make Harry lose his goddamn mind. “Draco, fuck. We have to. Oh my
Again, Malfoy mimics him, stretching out his long legs, resting his feet next to Harry’s. Malfoy’s wearing black socks with a firework design that keeps blooming in a shower of colors, over and over again. It’s mesmerizing, and every time he wiggles his toes, the pattern shifts.
He’d walked Harry to his doorstep and kissed him. The kiss had turned hot, then something more, something consuming. Draco had pulled back, mindful of not wanting to push Harry, and Harry had reeled him back in, kissed him again, and said, gasping, “I’m ready, fuck. Fuck, Draco, I’m ready.”
, he thinks, but when he looks over at Malfoy and sees the flush that’s creeping up his neck, Harry knows, whatever this is, he’s not alone in it.
Harry slides down so that he’s lying flat on his back. “I’ve thought about you, over me…” His voice trails off and Draco swears he sees Harry’s soft cock give a twitch, as if valiantly trying to rise to the occasion. “Jerking off over me. Fuck, Draco, would you?”
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Malfoy nod. “I mean, Hagrid said he’s cleared out the dangerous stuff, yeah?”
Harry glances at Malfoy again, who’s swaying slightly and is now staring. Not at Harry’s face though. He’s staring at Harry’s prick.
Draco sleeps in one of the guest rooms now. Everything has been cleansed and redecorated, but after the first couple of years, when Draco had tried to sleep in his childhood bedroom, and he’d woken screaming every single time, he’d given up. This room is determinedly neutral, and Draco can’t even remember who’d stayed in it during the Occupation. He doesn’t sleep well here, but he does sleep.
Draco shrugs. “Tonight? Probably not. Eventually? Absolutely. In any case, that’s really not relevant, because we
“This is shitty,” Harry mutters, banging his head gently against the tree. “So what you’re telling me is, if we climb down there, that thing is going to kill us for never having gotten laid, which is
It turns out, compared to the real thing? Harry’s imagination has failed him profoundly. He’ll have to return it, get a better one. Maybe speak to the manager.
Harry lets himself relax, leans back, and rests his head on Malfoy’s shoulder so he can look at the stars, and has to admit, the extra warmth is really pretty nice.
Harry hears footsteps and then Hermione’s laugh as she steps into the room. “What’s going on here, boys?”
he needs. Nothing’s that interesting is the problem. It’s hard to see a future when he still can’t quite believe he’s going to live. Classes are whatever. He has no idea what he wants to do when he graduates. Even food doesn’t taste that good anymore. Everything is just. Grey.
There’s a moment of silence as the Bottle sparks in what Harry thinks can only be an ominous way. “Harry Potter, when was the last time you achieved orgasm…” Harry opens his mouth to answer. “...with another person?”
Malfoy lifts one eyebrow and then smiles. Harry wonders if maybe he’s having an allergic reaction to the tequila because he’s suddenly breathless.
There are other thoughts he’s had, that he hasn’t shared. Like the fact that thinking of Malfoy as a
Draco stuffs his things and a bottle of water into his sisal market bag that Blaise claims to have gotten for him in Africa, but Draco is pretty sure he’d seen something just like in John Lewis. He reminds himself that he has a perfect right to hang out in the hedge maze, shoves his feet into his sandals, and walks out the door.
“I just don’t think. No one’s ever. Just said that.” Draco admits, his voice quiet. “To me. No one’s said it to me.”
Harry is sat on the couch, head back against the cushions. He’s slowed down on the shots, so he’s got a comfortable buzz on, and finally feels like he can breathe. He glances next to him and gives a happy crow of delight.
“Fuck, I don’t know,” Harry gasps, letting his head fall back against the pillows. He’s overwhelmed at how good this feels, how
Ron and Hermione bundle him out of his room and down the stairs, then up to the Owlery, where Harry pens a quick note, dictated by Hermione.
“I think that chunk landed right next to me and then fell over onto me when, err, I sat down suddenly. Didn’t hit me directly.”
, Harry thinks. Does Malfoy have a lover? Is he going to preserve this memory for his lover to get off to? That’s certainly an idea. Harry’s prick gives a sort of interested twitch and Harry lifts his head to give it a startled look and then settles back onto the pillow.
Harry is pretty sure that Malfoy must be extremely drunk because there’s no other logical explanation as to why Malfoy has not only followed him into the men’s room at the pub, but is currently standing
Draco gasps, his breath ragged. She’s right, of course. The price for that kind of magic is steep, and there’s no way Harry — brave, beautiful, steadfast Harry  — would ever consent to that. Not even to save his own life, Draco knows.
He’s sobered up, drunk some water, and there’s a light burning over the mantel. The drapes are usually left open and tonight, there is nothing to impede his view of the night sky. Draco knows he’ll fall asleep to the sight of the stars.
Hermione stares at him. “Draco, no. You don’t want―” She stops, presses her lips together. “Draco, you don’t want to see him like this. He wouldn’t want you to.”
It feels as if his orgasm is being wrenched out of him from the depths of his very soul as he slams in as deep as he can get, the heat of Harry’s body enveloping him, and he feels the way Harry clenches around him, pulling another wave from him.
,” Draco moans. “You’re fucking killing me, Harry,” and he slides back down Harry’s body to collapse on his chest, painting as he tries to catch his breath.
Draco pours the tea as Harry settles himself opposite Draco at the table, and Draco takes this opportunity to look at him, really look at him, as they drink. Harry looks tired, Draco thinks, but also there’s something different about him, a sense of freedom or lightness. Again, Draco lets himself hope that perhaps Harry is finally ready to make the change. He’s so stubborn, Draco thinks affectionately, loyal to a fucking fault, and he cannot be swayed to do anything before he’s ready, but this change has been a long time coming.
“Oh, that’s good,” Malfoy murmurs. “I feel it all way down my body. I’m starting to get hard, feel that? That’s what you do to me, just touching me like this.”
“Not really,” Draco had answered. “I’ve been wrong about the severity of the issue? Or like, the cause of it? But that there’s an issue, no, I’ve never been wrong about that.”
Potter flushes an even deeper shade of red. “I’ve got, err,” he gestures, “elastic waist pants, so I can just sort of pull them down if I need to, you know.”
Harry sighs and takes the opportunity to shake off and pack himself back up, ignoring the way that his dick is getting interested in these proceedings.
He sets down his bag and pulls out his water to take a long drink. He gives the hedge maze another glance and frowns, because it looks… different. The last time Draco had been here, it had been neglected and sad, completely overgrown and scraggly, but now. The hedges have been trimmed within an inch of their lives, with crisp edges and sharp angles. Instead of looking like it might just swallow you entirely if you dared to venture, a curved archway now entices Draco to come closer, to step through into the wonders that might lie beyond.
. Draco wants to believe that Harry knows him through and through, and loves him — not in spite of, but because.
“Draco, no.” Her voice is so quiet, so final. “You know that’s not what he’d want. It doesn’t even matter that it’s forbidden. He wouldn’t want that.” She pauses and closes her eyes, tears streaming. “You know that, Draco. He wouldn’t want that. He wouldn’t want that
“No, I’m pretty sure that can’t be true, but this thing is locked onto us now. You or me, it doesn’t matter. It won’t attack them the way it would us, but they’re going to need a weapon, because it will fight back. It’s not dumb.”
“Fuck, that’s…” Harry presses hard, scrapes one nail carefully over sensitive skin that tightens up, and Draco arches into the touch. “Yeah, that’s really good,
Harry moves his hand faster, focusing on the way Draco’s abs flex as he moves. “Fuck, Draco, you’re so…” he gasps, feeling that white-hot heat gathering deep inside of him, knowing he’s so close to the edge. “Can you… fuck, just…”
Harry steps towards the sink but Malfoy moves in even closer, getting in Harry’s way. He reaches out and puts his hand on Harry’s shoulder.
He cringes at his tone. He sounds breathy, anticipatory. Eager, in fact. Which, he is, obviously, but still.
“But,” Harry sighs. “So we need to head into the Forbidden Forest, look for some flower, and we might have to stay all night? What does an enchanted bottle even need a flower for, anyway?”
As Draco makes his way back to his room, he feels something that he’s not sure he’s ever felt before. He’s not even sure this feeling has a name. It’s something like contentment and something like hope and something like gratitude, or maybe even some brand new blend of all three, a new feeling no one has ever felt before.
No one’s seen Potter for days, not since the Incident in Potions, and Weasley and Granger are being very cagey. Draco doesn’t like it.
Finally, Draco opens his eyes and blinks at Harry, clearly dazed by the force of his orgasm. “Fucking hell,” he croaks. “That was amazing. You’re gonna have to give me a minute, I can’t feel my legs.”
Harry shrugs and nods hello to the lawyers, following Draco into the formal dining room. He holds Draco’s chair for him, almost without thinking, and then slides in to sit next to him as the others seat themselves.
, Draco. Are you close?” Harry hears how wrecked his own voice sounds, and he can feel it in every cell in his body.
right now, but this is the first thing he’s seen in so long that’s actually caught his attention. Draco’s body is long and lean, and he seems almost to glow in the sunlight streaming in through the large windows. He’s muscular but not bulky, and there’s a smattering of hair across his chest that is oddly enticing.
Harry registers the impatient note in Ginny’s voice and realizes she must have been trying to get his attention.
Harry thinks and sighs, remembering when Theo had gotten that consequence and how really, truly offensive the BO had been. “No, I do not forfeit, I’ll answer the Truth. The last time I got off with another person was, err…” he sighs heavily and can feel his face flushing, “never. I never have.”
“I know,” Draco whispers, “I know it hurts, just. Take a breath, bear down, okay?” He wraps one hand around Harry’s cock which has started to go soft and holds it gently even as he pushes into Harry’s body, centimeter by centimeter.
“I want your cock,” Draco says and Harry can’t help the way his hips jerk. “Get it out, Harry, come on.”
“Right, well. I’m sure the Aurors are going to want to hear all about this in the morning. They said they’ll be here to take your statement at ten. You might want to get some rest. And Draco?”
“Damn it,” Draco says with a sigh, “That’s really romantic, actually, and now I have to say it too, except that I’ve
“Weren’t you listening?” Malfoy stares at him. “Yes, it can do that. It’s binding magic.” He looks thoughtful. “I do wonder where Lovegood picked that thing up.” He shakes his head. “Anyway, yes, Potter. When you agreed to play, you agreed to be bound by the bottle’s judgment.” He makes a face. “I don’t know about you, but I’m not really keen on a week’s worth of boils.”
“Shh,” Malfoy says, “I thought I heard someth—” and then there’s something large crashing towards them.
Harry gives a tentative roll of his hips, and Draco moans, hand moving faster, and as if reacting to the sheer force of his desire, Harry starts to get hard.
Ron stares at them. “Harry, no one can outrun a scortátus. You either kill it immediately or you’re dead. How did you get it to leave you…”
Malfoy nods. “I think I can stand. Tell you what?” He gives Harry an impish grin, and even covered in dirt and blood, he’s the most beautiful thing Harry’s ever seen. “Whoever binds up the most perps pays for curry.”
from — one minute, they were waiting on their backup team, the next, there was the unmistakable feel of the wards slamming down, cutting them off from the rest of the team, and then.
Draco spins Harry around and pushes him towards the bed, and he’s laughing as he says, “Yeah, I can do that.”
Hermione nods and as Harry leaves the common room, he hears her ask Luna, “Where did you get this thing, anyway?”
And then, one day. Harry gets home a bit late. Draco’s on the couch, reading, curled up under his favourite fluffy blanket, forgotten tea going cold. He hasn’t even realized how late Harry is until Harry stumbles into the room, pink-cheeked from the January cold.
"I want to go!" Draco sat up, crossing his arms over his chest. "How could you even say that? Of course I want to go."
Little Draco stared at the Time-Turner for several long moments - the same Time-Turner that had been sitting on his desk in the same place for most of his life. If Little Draco had been harboring any disbelief at all still about Draco's story, it was gone now. There were tell-tale scratches on the Time-Turner's surface that Draco had long since memorized.
"I miss you, you know," Harry said quietly. "No one else makes fun of me with quite the same amount of decorum."
Draco looked at Harry, unable to see very clearly in the darkening room, but knowing Harry's outline by the faintest of shadows and ridges. "My family is in danger, Harry. I can't desert them," Draco sighed. "And you, you're just too fucking good to be true. But… I don't know what I'd do if you weren't," he admitted, feeling out of breath. "Harry. I have to tell you, and I'm sure you know… it's not safe for us to be seen as friends. We've got to… I don't know, fake a falling out or something."
After stumbling out one of the side doors and managing to find the small break in the hedges around the Manor property that he had dug out as a child, he Apparated just south of Little Whinging.
"Harry," I say, unable to move. His name on my tongue, so foreign, sends a jolt through me. I feel frozen, as if any movement I make could completely destroy this. "Aren't you - " a tongue decides to explore the perimeter of my ear as well, and I gasp. "Aren't you engaged?"
At the same time, the thing that scared Draco the most was that Harry might want to meet him strictly for business. Though it made the most sense, Draco didn't want to imagine it. And if Harry didn't want to talk about what had happened, Draco would try his hardest to make him see; he would apologize, beg and plead on his knees if he had to. Harry had been the only thing that made his life bearable before, and now there was nothing.
Pausing for a moment, Draco pulled down his hood, watching his own gray eyes widen in surprise. "I just made sure we won't be interrupted or overheard. And I already told you my name. It's the same as yours."
He heard the door shut quietly, and he turned. Harry was still under the Glamor, but he held his wand up to his face and quietly ended the spell. Draco watched in interest as the pinched nose transformed into Harry's own slender one, and the light hair darkened. The rest of the tiny changes Harry had made to his face rearranged, and in less than three seconds Harry was himself.
Draco was having breakfast when the barn owl landed in front of him with the letter. He recognized it as one of the school owls, and Draco knew even without opening it who had sent it. Before Crabbe or Goyle could ask about it, he stood and made his way toward the doors. He glanced quickly up and down the length of the Gryffindor table, but Harry was nowhere in sight.
"Fresh air certainly seems to agree with you, Draco," Narcissa commented. "You seem so happy today."
"In your future, Draco… you become very good friends with Harry Potter." Draco watched his own eyes light up. "But he is going to betray you." The lie struggled out of his throat, and he hated himself for telling it.
He didn't think he was any closer to completing either of his tasks for the Dark Lord, even though everything he had went into trying.
"Then come with me," Harry whispered, sitting up and taking Draco's hand in his. "I wish I could tell you to bring your parents, too, but I just don't think… with Dumbledore gone now, I don't think that I could promise -"
Darkness was just beginning to fall, and his arm throbbed so badly he thought he might pass out on somebody's well-manicured lawn. Then he recognized the name of Privet Drive on the street sign, and knew he was close. A few blocks later, he was standing in front of Harry's childhood home.
I smirk, unbuttoning my trousers and slowly stepping out of them. My cock makes an obvious tent in my boxers, and Harry looks down. "Mother is shopping, which means she won't be home until dinnertime, at least."
Harry let him borrow a tee-shirt and a pair of pajama pants that would have fallen completely off his waist if he hadn't held them up before lying down. It was weird at first, lying next to one another in the same bed. Draco was hyper-aware of Harry's every breath and movement, and very conscious of his own. But it was nice being able to lay there, nervous but entirely unafraid, with the one person he knew he could trust without a doubt.
He had spent weeks in the Manor's library, scouring for the instructions needed to change the settings on the Time-Turner so that one turn would equal a whole year instead of just an hour. He was sure he had set it correctly; after his year spent tinkering with the cabinet, he had rather a knack for understanding the inner-workings of magical objects.
He follows me, and we take a seat across from each other in the Tea Room. It's far away from the drawing room, which I'm sure Potter wouldn't love revisiting, and it's also got a great view of the gardens, which are turbulently full of Christmas and lights and Faeries in December. It's a better view at nighttime, but during the day it's pretty awe-inspiring, too. Mother and I are both beyond glad that she set the Christmas charms to reoccur each year on their own, as it would have just been depressing to know neither of us could do a thing to recreate them. Potter likes them too, it seems. He's still staring out the tall windows when lunch appears in front of him. I pop a grape into my mouth before clearing my throat, and he turns back to face me.
"What are you talking about? Are you honestly sore that I didn't come to visit you in the hospital wing?"
. It felt like a healing, or a blessing. This Mark would be nothing more than a blemish upon his skin now. He thought he could stand to be in their presence again with the thought of Harry in mind - this picture in mind - of Harry so diligently and carefully attending to him. Draco let himself stare and soak in the sight of him like he'd never allowed himself to before.
Draco stared at the men, his hand hovering over his wand. He was so sure Harry would have been alone, and so his immediate conclusion was that this couldn't possibly be Harry. It seemed far more probable that he had been followed, or that someone in the town had recognized him and notified the local gang of Death Eaters.
"I think that's about when it started for me, actually." Harry began to draw indistinct patterns on Draco's ribcage, making him shiver. "How about you?"
He raises an eyebrow at me, taking a step closer, which probably isn't a good idea. I'm almost shaking with nervous excitement at the prospect of having
"Nothing! I wasn't being serious, I just… listen," Harry sighed. "I'm upset, but not angry. I know this was never something you would choose for yourself." He leaned closer, until they were shoulder to shoulder again. "We've talked about this as a possibility before, and you always seemed determined to use it against Voldemort if it came down to it. Even though you
Draco came up behind Harry tentatively, reaching out to place one hand on Harry's lower back. When Harry did not respond, Draco slowly reached around to wrap his arms around Harry's middle. He felt Harry shiver, and Draco sighed, holding on a little tighter and reveling in the feel of Harry against him. It was the first time in his life he had ever held a person like this.
?" Draco watched his eyes widen behind his glasses. "Would you give up on the people you loved who were counting on you? Could you forgive yourself if you let them die?"
"I won't be hungry, anyway," Little Draco declared, examining his nails, and Draco had to fight to contain his laughter beneath the cloak.
"You're absolutely gorgeous like this," he says, and his fingers do not pause as he speaks. "I've been dreaming about this for years, did you know that?" My eyes grow wider, but I do not say anything. I can't, not with his fingers hitting me
"Stop, stop... need you in me, Harry," I mutter, hoping he is able to stop on his own because there is no way I can bring myself to physically stop him, not when I'm this close and not with that glorious mouth around me. I'm so close I'm trembling, my hands gripping his hair are shaking.
"Good." Harry kneels down without preamble and is face to face with my cock. I fall back against the wall as he eases down my boxers and licks one long stripe from base to tip, and I shudder. My hands push back against the wall, but there is no leverage to gain. My boxers are around my ankles and there's nothing I can do but look down and watch him take the head into his mouth. His hands ease their way up my thighs and around to the back of them, and then they are gripping my arse, pulling me forward until I'm completely sheathed in his mouth. He does something amazing with his tongue and I throw my head back against the wall again with a grunt of pleasure.
His feet took him to the seventh floor corridor automatically. He used only the least popular corridors, and he knew which creaky steps needed avoiding. He also had several stopping places along his route where he could hide and listen for the sound of footsteps. All seemed clear on this night, most likely because the majority of the school was in the Great Hall for dinner.
Harry looked at his feet for a moment before seeming to steel himself. "I've had a long time to think about everything, and I want you to know that I don't blame you for what happened. I'm sorry I didn't try to get in touch with you before this but I've kind of had a lot going on…" He laughed shortly, almost bitterly amused at his own sentiment.
Little Draco nodded, standing up and looking back once more, full of determination. "Don't worry. I'll make him
Harry Potter might be going to Hogwarts with him. Surely a baby with that much magic had to be more powerful than Merlin now at age eleven or twelve.
It was a long time before Draco moved, and even longer before he opened his eyes. But when he did, the first thing he saw was the ancient Time-Turner that old Grandfather Abraxas had left him before he died. It had been encased in glass, which was now currently in shards upon the floor. The Time-Turner itself was lying there, rusty and dented and filling Draco with the first seeds of hope since he had last seen Harry.
At the foot of the stairs, Draco took in the little door that led to the prison Harry had grown up in. He didn't understand how Harry could stand to live here still and be reminded every single day of what had happened to him. He glanced up at Harry ahead, taking the stairs two at a time and not paying the cupboard any mind at all. Not for the first time, Draco understood that his friend was a much stronger person than he was.
"Oh, please, Lord… won't you tell them?" Draco wasn't looking up but he could see Bellatrix bouncing on her heels as she spoke.
Harry laughed, and Draco noticed the wet corners of Harry's eyes before he was being kissed again. It was a little while longer before either of them actually felt like putting their clothes on to go.
Draco had been less than enthusiastic about receiving the Dark Mark for his seventeenth birthday, but for his own safety he had had to act as if it were the best birthday present he had ever received.
Narcissa looked like she had half a mind to accompany him into the stall, but Draco eyed her skeptically. "Oh, all right. Be quick!"
He bucks his hips against my hand in a quick spasm that he seems surprised by, as if his movements are somehow out of his control. "Hell, Draco," he gasps against my mouth, kissing me with bruising force and pulling my shirt from my trousers, unbuttoning it in earnest now.
"Fuck, yes," Harry says, almost a hiss in my ear. He is pushing me backwards towards the bed and I let him. My knees hit the edge and I fall, and Harry is on top of me. The weight of him is amazing, and my legs spread automatically. I shift upward just a bit, enough so that his cock can grace my arse cheeks, so that I can feel him near my entrance. I want him in me so much that the fact that he is not creates a phantom ache. My precome is leaking all over my stomach and I look into green eyes, feel him breathing heavily above me.
He only talked to Mother about Harry Potter after that. She told him that Harry Potter was almost exactly his age. He hadn't ever considered the fact that the
In a matter of seconds, Draco was outside, across the street from the New Sussex Inn and blinking blindly in the sunlight. Draco gasped for air, as Bellatrix had been practically squeezing his lungs shut as she'd Apparated away with him.
I don't believe him. I'm kind of in a state of shock, really. Three years. I've spent three years without magic. I haven't cast a single spell or brewed a single potion. I've had to learn a whole new way of life. The first few months were hell, after spending my entire life given the amazing privilege of a wand. It was an enormous shock realizing how truly lazy most wizards and witches are, and how much they take for granted. I've come to know the satisfaction of a job well done, and I've grown used to the idea that it will be seven more years before I can perform magic again. I've accepted it as best I can. I never left any room for hope that there could be a way to change it.
"What's going on?" Harry asked, staring at Draco as if it were only natural that Draco should know. All the color had fled from Harry's face and he was digging inside his robes for his wand.
Malfoy frowns and waggles his wand at the bottle which says, “The dare is this. Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter must venture into the Forbidden Forest to find the blossom of the Moonflower. They must search until they find the flower. If they do not find it by sunrise, they lose the dare. Penalty of loss will be boils over the entire body for 144 hours. Penalty of forfeit is twice that.”
Harry makes a noise of protest and snuggles even closer. “In a minute,” he whispers, almost asleep now. “Just give me a minute.”
Ron shakes his head, unpeels himself from Hermione and slithers around the outskirts of the circle to wedge himself in between Harry and Dean.
Malfoy, realizing how much Harry is on board with what's happening, somehow gets even more enthusiastic. He mouths his way across Harry’s jaw, his clever tongue doing something exquisite to the sensitive skin just below Harry’s ear that has Harry crying out. Fuck’s sake, Harry didn’t even know that
He sees the way Dean and Seamus sit up quickly; the way Ginny leans in, looking intrigued. Ron, bless his soul, just rolls his eyes and mutters something in Hermione’s ear.
Hermione tugs Draco towards the door and pauses to wind his scarf around his neck and tug a hat down over his ears.
Malfoy pulls back with a gasp. “Fuck,” he whispers, fingers tightening on Harry’s skin before he takes a step back. “Are you… Is this okay, Potter?”
Draco manages to say, “Potter? Oh yeah, he was here, headed off about ten minutes ago, said something about,” and Harry gives another long suck and Draco hates him, he really does, and he’s
He doesn’t even look, just shoves his arm out and casts, hisses as something hits him, and there’s another scream.
He shifts up so that his bum is resting on Harry’s sternum but Harry doesn’t seem to mind the weight, the way his eyes are glued to where Draco’s hand is holding his painfully hard cock.
His soft touch sparks something deep inside of Harry, and when Malfoy’s thumb traces lightly over Harry’s mouth, he shivers, his lips parting on a gasp.
Finally, there’s a ceasefire, because all of the attacking group are down. Incapacitated or dead, Harry really doesn’t care much. Breathing hard, he shoves his wand into his thigh holster and turns, running back towards the debris where he’d last seen Malfoy.
Draco blinks at her for a moment, confused. “Granger,” he whispers conspiratorially, “Don’t tell anyone, but we’re in a pub. And did you know? They sell whiskey in a pub.”
“So yeah,” Malfoy says. “Scortátus are the anti-unicorn. They’re smart, they’re vicious, and they fucking hate virgins.”
“After shift?” Harry asks, not wanting to push too hard, but damnit, he’s been waiting for so long. “Today?”
He climbs up next to Harry and sits, focusing first on relaxing his body. He breathes deeply, unclenches his jaw, and feels the slight lawyer-induced headache start to fade. He lifts his shoulders, lets them drop, once, and again. He rolls his head left, then right, and breathes in the steam and fragrance.
Harry leans back, delighted. “You’re such a fucking swot,” he says affectionately and Draco punches him lightly.
That’s the thing about Harry, Draco thinks, looking at that beloved, familiar face. He just says things. Things like
Harry’s cock is hard and flushed and damp at the tip. It’s long and thick and mouth-wateringly beautiful, if such a thing can be said about a prick, and Draco licks his lips as he stares at it.
“And my dad.” Draco waits, but Harry doesn’t stiffen or pull back, the way he does sometimes when the memories rise. “He’d bring me little gifts. Fancy ink. A silver coin. A new fountain pen. I…” Draco sighs. “I used to collect them. He hated that, called them common. Muggle. But he still brought them home. For me.”
