That night at dinner, Pansy was sitting with Luna at the Ravenclaw table so Draco tried to will himself to become invisible as he sat at the very end of the table. He sat alone and didn't pay attention to anything around him.
Draco started to calm down almost as soon as Harry started singing. "Are you back with me?" Harry asked gently, not stopping the rocking motion he started at some point.
McGonagall was proud of Potter. She knew that he would go to such lengths for anyone, but it showed how much he had grown when he wanted to do this for Malfoy. She agreed and told them that she'd let the other professors know. "Can I know the extent of what's happening?"
Draco lied next to him and they watched the stars. Draco looked for the constellations he knew and made a few of them move, like they were coming to life. He didn't know the extent of Harry's astronomical knowledge, but he made Canis Major run around like a puppy until it bumped into Draco's namesake. Draco let the constellations move back into their places and just let Harry watch the stars.
He was approaching the hidden clearing when he found himself laughing in disbelief and...giddiness would be the best word. After so long, he was finally taking Draco on a date.
Potter had approached him just before the trial that would determine his future and asked him a question that Draco doubted he even remembered, let alone knew how much of an impact it had on him.
"Very well. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I have to shuffle some things around, but I'll send you two an owl with your new schedule before Monday. Enjoy your weekend."
Draco was the one that woke up first. Sitting up breathing heavily and drenched in sweat. He felt Harry stir and felt terrible that he woke him up. Draco was shaking and couldn't get his breathing to even out.
Pansy told him he didn't need to wait for her to finish, she was going to go talk to Luna once she was done, so Draco stood and walked back to his room. His mind was running with everything that was happening. Draco could understand the meaning behind the note he still had in his bag, but he was curious if more than just that one person thought that of him.
Harry first went down to the kitchens. He asked the house elves to make Draco's favorite meal. They were a little busy making food for the castles dinner, but they were happy for the special request from him.
"I had the house elves make your favorite." Harry sat down and patted the spot next to him. "I don't care what other people say, obsessively stalking someone for years does have its perks." Draco's smile grew a little bigger at the terrible joke as he sat next to Harry.
Tuesdays were by far the best day of the week. Granger and Weasley didn't have the same classes as him and Potter. So, rather than let the others in their year hang about him and fawn over his presence, Potter had taken to sticking by Draco's side.
"Gra-Hermione apologized to me. Said she'd try to understand my actions from my point of view. Said she would support you and I, try to get Weasley to apologized too." Draco said when they were almost done with their food.
Oh, so that's what that was about. Draco wordlessly summoned the note from his bag and unfolded it. He placed the paper on the bed next to Harry's hand. Harry shifted only enough to grab the note and read it. When he did, he sat up and looked angry, more than the note should have made him.
As soon as Harry started speaking Draco had a small smile on his face, it only grew the longer Harry talked and the longer he watched those green eyes and tanned skin.
He had Pansy, but they weren't as close as they used to be. Being the only two Slytherins of their year to return they stuck together for survival, but since Pansy had always been in the background of the war no one payed her any attention, didn't hold her to the acts of the war.
"Thank you, Draco. This is really good, I didn't know you could cook?" Harry says with his mouth full, but Draco doesn't have it in him to scold Harry for it.
"Yes alright. Bossy." Harry chooses a movie and wraps his arms around Draco, pulling him as close as possible.
Draco clears his throat and steps out of Harry's hold. Harry seems to be broken out of a trance and chuckles lightly.
"It won't. Men, return this ship home. We have a wedding to get to." The men cheer with joy and Theo pulls Draco close, taking them to the captain's quarters.
Harry takes Draco's hand and leads him out to the cliff, where the stary night is clear of clouds. "I will never forget you Draco, but perhaps when you leave and begin your life with Nott, you may forget me. So I hope you can always remember today, the day you saved me."
Draco stares back at the stormy black waters of the sea and can only pray that Harry will be alright.
"Please! Please don't run after me!" Draco cries his throat soar and dry. "You are the only one he has now, Dobby. Go back to him."
"Mmmh." Harry moans a little when Draco's fingers rub slightly against his nipples. Draco bites down at his lip, feeling a bit guilty for enjoying this.
"I found it in Snape's belongings," Draco explains before Harry can ask. "Apparently your father and Snape weren't the only boys in Hogwarts who were head over heels for your mother. The picture was taken by a muggle-born. Snape had seen the picture being taken and of course, did what any Slytherin with a mildly obsessive crush would do and took it. It doesn't move like wizarding photos but I knew you wouldn't care about that."
Harry wakes in the morning and ventures into the island, picking every flower he sees fit to gift Draco. He remembers what Draco had said about the gift of flowers. It's a token of one's love. Once he's satisfied with the bouquet of various flowers, he hikes back to the cave.
"All of the things we do together are my favorite," Harry confesses and Draco's heart does a backflip. "I'm honored to have met you, Prince Draco."
“Yes.” Draco wipes away the tear and smiles at Harry. “You don’t have to worry about that anymore Harry. I know we haven’t said it yet but in sickness and in health, remember? Besides, I adore pampering the man I love.”
I love these." Draco murmurs under his breath as he squeezes gently with both hands Harry's left thigh. Draco leans down to place a kiss at the top of the thigh and Harry watches with dark eyes.
Draco can faintly hear their cries as he's gently placed onto his bed. The heating jugs in the sheets begin to warm up his body.
"I dreamed of the dragon. I'm terrified of the dragon, Harry." Draco confesses. "Actually, there's something I need to tell you, I've been preparing-"
"Please bring Harry a pepperup potion and prepare some warm water with towels. When you're done, meet me in the kitchen." Draco walks off and Kreacher prepares everything all while Harry watches with a smile.
"Draco." Harry pleads and he turns around in the middle of the massage, giving Draco a full view of his aching dick.
"Master Black, you must not dirty your hands with chores. Let Kreacher do the cooking." The poor old elf argues with Draco and the wizard huffs in annoyance.
Draco glares at Harry’s words, although they lack any real spite, and raises his arms. It’s only then that Harry realizes that Draco is carrying a bag and a red present.
"It's called a telly or tv." Harry corrects him but Draco shrugs it off, getting comfortable on the couch. "I thought you hated it because it's so loud?"
“I think I am, I’m sorry let me go take a pepper up. I’ll come back and clean the sheets.” Harry is across the room when a cool hand stops him.
"Look, I know you might see this as I am some traitor who wants to flee but it's not. It's just for protection. How should I know if Harry
Harry appears from the doorway, looking like a true heir to the throne. Harry's hair was pushed back, showing his handsome forehead and emerald eyes. He's dressed in velvet red robes, gold-trimmed and fitted to his firm and wide body.
"Dancing." Draco finally answers and Harry's face scrunches up. "Why do I need to know how to dance?"
"Hurry and undress, I'll be back with porridge and tea." Draco stands up and calls for Kreacher. "Yes, master Black?"
"I have worn these uncomfortable clothes you picked out for me. How on earth do people wear these? I itch." Draco stares in awe as Harry walks towards him.
"You say you are afraid of dragons, but you play with one and envy them." Harry dusts his clothes and walks towards a pouting Draco. "Why hasn't Nott come for you?"
"I will always come to your rescue, my prince. But we must go to this island and finish that monster. His dirty blood must drip on my sword for the harm he did to you."
"Don't strain yourself." Draco pants, raising himself by his knees and moving his hips sensually. "Let me do all the work."
"So he's not coming for you," Harry concludes and Draco gloomily plays with the kite in his hands and keeps quiet.
Harry on the other hand wishes Draco would hurry up and make a move on him. His skin is tingling and he's becoming more and more sensitive to Draco's touch. He can feel his dick harden and he hopes Draco gets the message.
"Thank you."  Draco tries to hide his smile as he rubs Harry's large and smooth back. He proceeds to Harry's legs and feet and after much argument, his crotch and buttocks.
"I used all fresh ingredients and followed Dobby's recipe to the letter." Harry details the process as Draco begins to eat. Draco embarrassedly lets out a blissful moan and Harry's grin only grows wider.
“The bag contains the finest elf-made wine you’ll ever try.” Draco walks towards Harry until they’re close enough that Harry can smell Draco’s woodsy cologne. Harry inhales quite boldly and sighs in content. If Draco noticed, which Harry is sure he did, he didn’t show it.
Dobby disappears from the boat and Draco can only cry harder as his boat sails away until the island is no longer visible.
"That's not the dragon." Blaise runs to the edge of the ship and from the distance, a small boat can be seen. "It's his highness! Men lower the anchor!"
His face is hot and he cringes at how sweaty and sticky his skin is. A large and painful cough escapes his throat and Harry winces when he feels the person beside him shift awake.
Harry scratches his head in confusion and begins to rant about the stupidity in the whole story. Draco continues to laugh, but deep down he can't help but agree with the characters in the story. Bravery is not a quality that comes easy for men. For him. "Bedtime?"
Harry nervously paces in front of his floo, checking his watch for the tenth time in less than five minutes.
"Here, I'll teach you to see the wind." Harry raises the kite, using Draco's hands. Draco is pressed onto Harry's bare chest and he blushes as Harry rests his head on his shoulder.
“Well, then what’s wrong?” Draco crosses his arms but then his complexion turns worried. “Is it more serious? Do you need to go to St. Mungos? Potter why didn't you say anything before come on let’s go.”
"On our last date,  I noticed how quickly your hands get cold and since you do fieldwork for hours in this dreadful weather despite being the head Auror, I thought those would be useful. Then I realized if you didn't own a decent pair of mittens then you probably didn't own a decent blanket either so.." Draco is blushing more now than when they were kissing as he explains the reason behind his gifts.
“Draco.” Harry can feel his eyes water and his heart swells inside his chest. Usually, Draco is more reserved about his feelings for Harry, but Draco felt compelled to verbally say it. He wishes nothing but hell to those heartless muggles.
"Lady Parkinson was right. You are nothing like your grandfather." Blaise murmurs and Theo cackles out loudly.
“Harry James Potter are you ill?” This time the voice changes from soft to stern and Harry quickly gets out of the bed. Shit, Harry thinks. Last night's raid under the pouring rain maybe wasn't such a good idea.
Draco opens the lid and pours a good amount onto his palms. He rubs it in, warming it up before rubbing his hands on Harry's chest.
“Are you just going to stand there and gape at me like a bloody plimpy fish or are you going to tend to your guest of honor?” Draco holds out the things and Harry takes them, not so discreetly shaking the box.
they scream in agony as their fire consumes them from the inside. Only smoldering ashes are what is left of them and the new dragon. That's how my ancestors were born. That is the root of my existence."
"You call us dragons but we call ourselves born of the ashes. This is how dragons are created from the brides and grooms of men, Draco. They don't just kill them. They are burned alive." Draco lets out a whimper but Harry continues. "They fill them with fire and hold them down while
"No!" Draco yells, pulling back. "I mean, I-I just want to go home! The dragon will die of hunger as he can not fly. I do not wish to go back, please!"
"Well we are just starting to date and we haven't really discussed your parents. I didn't want to overstep." Draco explains and Harry smiles.
A loud growl makes the blonde prince and he watches in horror as  Harry convulses on the ground, his body red and gold.
Draco lets out a moan and Harry pulls him closer by the waist. Draco's hand curls over Harry's nape and brings his face closer to his. When their lips meet, Harry's tongue pushes desperately into Draco's mouth. Harry begins to pull off Draco's silk undergarments and Draco is too immersed to care about their condition once they're thrown onto the floor.
Draco leans closer to Harry and places a book on his lap. "Well, why don't we start with something small. This is a children's book. It contains short stories and famous poetry. I will read some to you and then you can practice reading it out loud afterward. Deal?" Harry agrees and soon they've come to have a nightly ritual, where Draco reads Harry a story and then Harry reads one to him.
"My Draco!" Theo pulls him into an embrace as soon as Draco touches the deck. "I'm rejoiced that you are alive, my love!"
"I love you too, sap" Draco reaches for his wand and casts a quick cleaning charm before getting off the bed. "Come on let's go bathe."
"Thanks, Draco, I love them." But Harry is more fascinated by the last gift. The first is a lovely framed polaroid picture of Lilly Evans and James Potter that Harry had never seen before. They were wearing Hogwarts uniforms and sitting outside by what looks like the great lake.
“No Draco I’m not that sick I’m just...” Harry trails off and sits on the bed. Draco follows him and softly Harry explains what he’s feeling. He had told Draco a few months into their relationship about his childhood. It had taken everything to stop Draco from tracking the Dursleys and hexing them all. But Harry has never really gone into detail. Draco had reacted bad enough with the basics that Harry thought it best to keep it hidden.
Draco didn’t understand how he could feel like his heart was sinking and soaring at the same time. He wanted to interrupt, to argue, to shout that it didn’t matter how open his mind was becoming now, as it hadn’t been open when it mattered. He hadn’t learned fast enough.
Harry hissed and followed Ron’s eye-line to find—sure enough—Draco Malfoy. He was seated in between Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott, however while the two of them were engaged in conversation, Malfoy say hunched over the table, his hands crossed and his eyes looking down.
it would be like this with Potter, even the most innocent kiss so intense he could feel his skin burning with it.
In today’s Potions, they were finishing the Energy Tonic they’d been working on all month. Harry felt guilt swell up inside him as Slughorn talked about how they’d been checking in on their potions each week, knowing full well he hadn’t checked on it once.
“Fine,” admitted Harry. “I thought maybe she’d be irritated and it’d be an inconvenience, but she said it was no problem.”
“Have you met with Hermione yet?” Harry asked, shaking his hand. When Ashworth shook his head, Harry grinned. “Good luck with that, sir.”
“That seems healthy,” said Draco, mildly, sipping his tea. He seemed to realise that this was a bit of a touchy topic for Harry and was thus backing off, and Harry was grateful.
“Is there a reason,” Harry asked, forcing the words to come out, “why someone would be denied a Healer after being cursed?”
He still wasn’t sure it was the best idea, but it had been the only one they could come up with. Despite having been hearing the other man’s thoughts for over a month now, he hadn’t found out much information that would help in identifying him. Harry had begun to write down any clues he discovered on a small roll of parchment he kept in the inside pocket of his most comfortable pair of robes, but it wasn’t very long. So far, all he had was:
Truly, Potter had an uncanny ability to produce words in an order that was absolutely unexpected and baffling.
His grasp was firm, but gentle, feeling the slight prickliness of the five o’clock shadow on Potter’s face, and the soft sheen of sweat trickling down from his forehead.
“The reason many potionmakers stay away from seeds is because of their tendency to mix poorly with certain ingredients, however this potion does not include any elements of an animal, blood or horn or hair, so the seeds have nothing to react dangerously with.”
The door swung open and Draco entered, trying not to be overwhelmed by the many different patterns assaulting his eyes all at once. Slughorn had sofas and carpets and lamps everywhere, all of varying styles and materials, and all aggressively vibrant in colour.
For a desperate moment, he had even tried Occlumency, racking his brain to try and remember what Snape had taught him three years prior, but then he reminded himself that even if he wasn’t rubbish at Occlumency—which he definitely was—it was intended to block Legilimency, not real nightmares.
Harry watched, he watched as they drank their champagne, as Molly questioned Bill and Fleur about how long they’ve known, as George and Ron began to joke about how they would corrupt the child with Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes early on, and he held his glass of champagne in his hand tightly.
“And finally,” McGonagall was saying, “taking my place as both Transfiguration professor and Head of Gryffindor House, Professor Lachlan Ashworth.”
As humiliating as it felt, he’d rather ask Potter to start the fire than risk their potion being messed up because of his dysfunctional wand.
“Oh, sweetheart, you’re in bad shape, aren’t you?” said Malfoy, softly. “Listen to me, the more you flap your wings, the more you’re going to tear at the wound. I know you’re scared, but I’m only trying to help you.”
It had grown from there, with both Violet’s and Daphne’s younger sisters joining in. They were of a similar age, Laurel being only one year younger than Astoria, but it had been slightly awkward when Laurel had come to her first dinner, being the only one at the table who couldn’t perform magic. She hadn’t seemed bothered in the slightest, and had easily broken the tension by jokingly insisting that she refused to be on dish duty since they could all accomplish it in seconds.
for someone who normally looked utterly confident and sure of herself, and this was enough to give Draco pause.
“What’s it to you, Potter?” Draco shot back, with none of the old bite he used to have. Potter shrugged, like he couldn’t possibly care less.
Hermione—bitterly and through several angry tears—spent the morning alternating between scolding them and pouring Hangover Potion into their tea.
“You need to be able to know how to use them in a practical setting,” he said, as if it were the simplest answer in the world.
The man seemed to be in the middle of reading the article, and Harry waited with bated breath, hoping beyond hope that the time wouldn’t run out before he found out whether the man realised it was him.
It was through talking about it with Rhiannon that Harry realized it was just what he was used to—even as a child, the Dursleys had always kept him busy with cleaning and cooking duties and various other chores. His Hogwarts years hadn’t exactly been peaceful; even when he wasn’t worrying about Voldemort, there was never a lack of chaos in the castle. He was always on the go, whether it was trying to figure out the damned golden egg in the Triwizard Tournament, or studying for his O.W.L.s, or trying to learn Occlumency from Snape in the dungeons, he had barely had a moment’s rest. The first year out of Hogwarts, he had kept busy. He hadn’t done it on purpose, he was just functioning like he always had, running around with a lot to do and a sense of urgency following him around as he did. He had kept that up for two and a half years, even after he’d started seeing Rhiannon and she’d urged him to slow down, and finally he had burned out.
2.) This is a sequel to my fic, The Wand That Chose Two Wizards. If you haven't read that one, I'm going to try to write this one in a way that allows it to stand alone, but it'll probably make more sense to you if you've read the first one!
His eyes fell upon the small, circular table that sat in the centre of the room, and the vase upon it. He hadn’t mentioned it to Violet, but this had been another motivator for his research into flowers. He had been curious about the flowers since he first saw them and wondered why those particular ones had been chosen. He’d been hoping maybe the Muggle book would give him some more answers.
“Sophie and Ron are in Hogsmeade today,” Hermione provided, not looking up from her book, the text of which looked miniscule.
Draco considered lying, but knew there was no point. It wouldn’t matter if she didn’t believe him, it wouldn’t matter regardless of her reaction, since she would have no memory of it come morning. So he told her the truth. How April 10
The books were practically impossible to get through, with some parts almost looking as though they were in another language, and Draco had the feeling he was missing a substantial amount of background information needed to understand them. He had asked Violet to take a look at them, but she’d frowned at the book and then shook her head.
They had helped track down the headquarters of a notorious potions smuggling ring that the Aurors had been chasing for months, and as a reward, they were given lead on the takedown—their first as rookies. Draco’s anxiety was high, and Potter’s apparent cockiness only worked to irritate Draco further, as he worried that Potter wasn’t taking it seriously enough and that his arrogance could endanger them in a potential fight. The two had bickered about their approach, about whether to try and go in stealthily or call in the Hit Wizards and go in full force, but in the end, the strategy didn’t matter because the smugglers had been expecting them.
But when he had opened the note, he realized that it was not a response, but rather his own note that he had penned to Ollivander three days ago.
“Merlin, that’s revolting,” Draco shuddered, looking back up at the portrait, at the luxurious velvet chair she sat upon, at the opulent looking dress, the jewels that adorned her neck. He very much doubted Claudia had ever worn such a thing in her short life.
“Everything alright?” Harry asked. He could tell Ron was just barely restraining himself from interrupting, so he shot him a quick look and nod.
She offered him a cheeky grin and then jumped up to find Heidi at the Hufflepuff table. Harry took a long sip from his tea and sat, replaying the conversation he had just had in his head.
“That is all very well for you to say, Auror Potter, up here in these brand new offices with all of your resources paid for! We’re still down in the cubicles at the M.L.E.S. Think about it from my perspective!”
“You want this, right?” he asked. “I’m not overstepping? You’re not just…I don’t know, going along because you don’t want to say no?”
“Cool,” Harry grinned, as Neville sat beside him on the armchair vacated by Hermione several hours earlier. “Who’s Edgar Caverly?”
“Because I’m a Slytherin. They’re angry about the war,” she said this in a monotone, as if reading from a textbook, and it was this tone, more than anything else, that lit the fire in Draco’s belly.
“Ron clearly has a type,” Harry said with a grin, completely anticipating the thwack on the back of his head that followed his remark.
With that, Hagrid departed, McGonagall sweeping after him, leaving a strange and tense silence in their wake.
He had learned a long time ago that the Malfoy name was no longer one to loudly boast and throw around, and he had gone from a boy with his chin up in the air to a man who kept his head down.
“Dobbs and Armstrong are neck and neck!” Dennis Creevey exclaimed from his place at the commentator’s podium. “It’s just a question of who’s faster! Armstrong has the advantage of the better broom, but Dobbs is smaller and lighter and—
to him, taking up more space in his mind. And he supposed that had been alright—when they hated each other. But it was exhausting, knowing that Potter had always meant more to him than he ever had to Potter. It was
Draco felt his heart drop. He almost felt he would be insulting Ollivander by showing him the shoddy excuse for a wand he’d been using. Nevertheless, he withdrew it and handed it to the old wandmaker. Ollivander examined it for a long, agonizing minute or two.
After Harry finished his tea, he gestured for Ella to come over to the table in order to pay, only to be informed that Draco had already covered it.
That year had been one of restoration, of recovery. It had been about healing from the war, talking through all the dark and destructive feelings that seemed impossible to talk about.
Harry, not the way McGonagall did. And though Harry respected McGonagall more than anyone else—probably even more than he had Dumbledore—there was a big part of him that was afraid of disappointing her.
“I don’t know. We can’t help how we’re raised, I suppose. We believe what our parents tell us. You were raised to think all Muggles were inferior to wizards in every way. My parents would have raised me the exact same way if it hadn’t been for Laurel. They were forced to face the truth, and in that, they were lucky and so was I. Just because you weren’t doesn’t mean you’re a bad person. Not if you’re willing to challenge your old views when given new information.”
Nathaniel had always had a wide smile for him, during a time when almost no one else did, when the Daily Prophet was still sending interns out to follow him around, when people still spat at him in the street and threw hexes at his back.
“My probation doesn’t officially end until August the first,” he said. “At Hogwarts, I’m considered to be under the supervision of Professor McGonagall, however as soon as I leave here, I will have to report to the Aurors. I’m unsure what, if any, restrictions will be placed on me.”
There was a lot that was fully capable of grabbing his happiness by the throat and suffocating it. But Draco forcefully shoved those thoughts aside and did his best to occupy his mind with pleasant, meaningless images, so as to allow himself to feel this warmth without any intrusion. He walked automatically towards his usual spot on the windowseat, and as he walked, he saw that they were occupied by Violet and Daphne, which was often the case, as the Slytherins had somewhat claimed that spot as their own.
better off as friends and he was glad they had been able to remain as such. Besides, she seemed to be happy with Heidi—aside from this new Quidditch conflict.
it. He knew it wasn’t unusual to miss a friend, he had missed Ron and Hermione dearly every summer when he had had to go back to the Dursleys, but this felt different somehow.
“I thought that, instead, I would have it announce me as your mentor,” McGonagall continued. “If anyone asks, you can tell them you’re undertaking a Transfiguration apprenticeship. I will, of course, go along with this story.”
Ron and Sophie were spending a lot of time together, but it was often with the four of them as a group, unlike when he had been with Lavender and had somewhat abandoned Harry and Hermione. He seemed so happy, the two of them were constantly making each other laugh until they doubled over, and even with all the additional work that preparing for the N.E.W.T.s brought, Ron was always going on about Auror training and how great it was, and he didn’t even seem to
And just as Daphne had said, that didn’t necessarily mean the Malfoy line would have to die either. She had already offered to
There was a little twinkle in his eye and he looked over at Harry, who tried his best not to make eye contact.
“I don’t know!” moaned Harry in despair. “I didn’t think he’d agree? Or, I didn’t think he’d agree to meet so
Harry sat back in his seat and watched Malfoy slowly stir the potion—two turns counter-clockwise, then four clockwise, and then repeat six times. He felt somewhat useless, but he had
Luna, never one to be especially cognizant of social cues, continued, “I wonder about the Slytherins.”
“Excellent. Let me know when you’ve found someone and keep me updated on your progress. Meanwhile, we’ll continue our sessions together. I’m trying to find a time where Waya can come in as well, since he’s much more of a Defence expert than I am.”
“So,” Hermione’s eyes narrowed, “This whole war started because of pitting people against other—pureblood, half-blood, Slytherin, Gryffindor—that’s what got us fighting in the first place. I think if any of the Slytherins want to come back, they should be welcomed like everyone else.”
Ginny had tried to hide it. She’d tried to be a rock for her family, for her mother especially. She had held herself tall and pressed her lips together when Fred’s name was mentioned, but Harry knew her better than that.
His Mark looked the same, still dark and black, but now littered with small scars even whiter than Draco’s skin. He had done his best to avoid looking at it since then, but it was hard to avoid your own body, your own skin.
“I—I don’t—Malfoy, I—” Potter seemed to struggle to get the words out, and Draco began to rub his hand across his back in soothing circles.
But Draco valued that Potter was letting him see these parts of himself. He liked knowing what made Potter tick—what made him angry, what relaxed him, what made him laugh, what made him upset. He felt like he was being allowed in to some sort of exclusive club—the people that Potter trusted. It felt good, having Potter’s trust. He didn’t want to lose it.
“We wanted different things,” he said. He felt itchy, the bite of the wine scratching at him from the inside, the guilt over Nathaniel making him want to claw at his skin. “But he was very dear to me, he always will be.”
“I’m going to run, I wanted to see if I could have a quick word with Professor Ashworth before class starts. See you then!”
but then approached the wheelbarrow and withdrew a cold, slimy piece of meat. Armstrong remained right at Draco’s elbow, waiting for him to place the food on the ground.
“I know. Don’t worry, I won’t keep you hostage. As soon as you can fly again, I’ll let you right out.”
Before Draco could respond with a scathing remark, before he could take a step backwards, before he could tell Potter to sod off, Potter’s hand reached up and grabbed onto Draco’s arm, and Draco found himself quite frozen.
did. It wasn’t enough that he had won the war, that he had taken Draco’s wand, that he had saved his life again and again, that he had singlehandedly spared him a sentence in Azkaban. No, all of that wasn’t
Potter did not interrupt once, nor did he try to reign in Draco’s outburst. He simply sat there, watching and waiting as Draco ranted. When he was finally done, breathing heavily and looking down at the floor, Potter spoke softly.
“What is it?” Harry curiously asks, giving the box another shake. It's silent, which means that the item is soft or that Draco is great at wrapping gifts, Harry concludes.
"Harry I believe this is the last lesson. You have learned everything there is to be a human. And the dragon has not shown up since." Harry radiates happiness at Draco's words.
"But there is no music." Harry mumbles and Draco shrugs. "Listen closely, you can hear the waves crashing onto the shore. Let's sway to that."
"Draco, how is it that you are alive? Where is the dragon?" Theo asks and Draco glances as everyone stares, awaiting his answer.
Day after day, Draco teaches Harry how to be more human. All while the blonde prince dangerously begins to fall more deeply for Harry.
Harry laughs but nods his head in agreement. Draco admires Harry's surprisingly soft and smooth golden skin as his touch moves from Harry's abs to his strong and thick thighs.
"Listen! I gave my word to your father before his death that I would not fail his family or his honor. Let us go back and resupply. We can continue searching then."
“Actually we’re having the date here in my home.” Harry motions to the dining room and Draco has a look of confusion and surprise.
Draco looks around the room before slowly pulling a large brown bag from behind the many pillows around the fireplace they found in the shipwreck. He opens the sack and gently wraps a blade, tucking it at the bottom of the bag, along with the map he found of Land of Slytherin, a glass water jug, and some dry nuts and berries Dobby helped him pick the other day. He then moves over to a hidden wall by his bed, and with a sharp edge of a knife, he carves a small short line.
"Oh, my child." Narcissa whimpers beside Draco, holding his chilled hand in her own. "Why is this happening?"
"You will get us all killed. I will not let my men die over your shortcomings!" Blaise yells and Theo raises his sword.
"If you must know, dancing is very important as a royal. It is a way to make social connections in court and it's fun! Come see, you'll like it."
"The animated children films you played last time weren't horrible. Just the constant singing is annoying, but I enjoyed the Chinese warrior and her dragon. Let's watch another one like that."
"Ow." Harry whimpers but stares lustfully as Draco licks the remaining chocolate from his fingers. "Good?"
So eventually, little Harry grew to understand that being sick was his fault and that no one else would help him. To avoid being yelled at, Harry stays in his cupboard and only comes out when he knows his family is asleep.
"I'll charm the spoon to feed you, just blow on it while I wipe down your body." Draco begins to submerge the towel into the warm water and rub Harry's arms and chest.
"Master Draco!" Draco stares at Dobby, standing in the middle of the boat, tears running down his cheeks. "Don't leave."
"No. Just you." Harry leans over and presses a kiss to Draco's lips. When they finish, they walk back to the sitting area and Harry takes out the soft wool blanket Draco gifted him and cuddles Draco close.
The gift bag is long and slender, and Harry is fairly sure that it contains a very expensive wine bottle. But the gift box is much larger and harder to guess.
"I understand everything now," Harry jeers and Draco cringes at the look he receives from Harry. Why you decided to teach me. Your lessons, it was all part of your plan to escape. Lesson number one, privacy. You needed an area where you could plan and hides things without me near.
They have much to discuss still, and many deep wounds to treat but with true love, healing comes easy.
Harry Potter wakes to the sound of his blazing alarm and he groans when he swallows down and his throat feels painful.
"Hold this." Harry hands Draco the string with one hand and with the other they both gracefully raise the kite high. "Close your eyes. Look into the distance, further than you could ever see with your eyes open. Feel the wind with your fingertips. Feel it with your skin and hear its whisper. Then and only then will you find something within you that you didn't know was there." They both let go of the kite and like magic, it rises high, glazing side to side. Harry watches the kite and then at Draco and an inscrutable pain begins to grow inside him. He runs his nose up Draco's neck and inhales before pulling back, letting go of the string.
Thankfully, they were facing each other, which meant Ginny didn’t have to look at Malfoy’s naked self full on. She shook her head fondly, it looked as if they were going to have a nice household conversation about where in the flat was sex appropriate very soon. In the meantime, however, she slipped back into her shoes, and apparated to Luna’s, leaving a note on the inside of their door that read, ‘
Pale hands slipped up the back of corded brown thighs to feel the warm come that had begun to leak from Harry’s hole, and then pulled his body closer to Draco’s own face. Harry gasped and helped guide his tip fully into, usually thin, pink lips. Grey eyes fluttered shut in bliss as Harry thrust into his mouth slowly. He tasted of bitter-salty pre-come and pink-salt sex sweat. Draco pushed the man’s legs, asking him to go deeper. When Harry granted this wish, he swallowed greedily around the head of The Chosen One’s cock, taking it into his throat. All this time Harry was growing increasingly louder.
The sarcastic drawl was so familiar (so infuriatingly sexy that sixteen year old Harry had pulled himself off angrily to the memory of far too many times to count), but the petulant pout of Draco’s lips, that was new. Harry couldn’t help but laugh as he lent his head down, “sorry,” he whispered against that cute new pout.
Draco stood up and walked around his desk to stand in front of Harry. Leaned his head down so his mouth brushed the other man’s ear when he asked, “Is your flat free tonight?”
After a few minutes of kissing and moaning and stretching, Harry pulled his hand back around and laid himself out on top of Draco, shoulder to groin, with his legs straddling Draco’s hips. He cupped Draco’s neck and tugged at the hair of his nape as he lifted the blond’s face to a better angle for kissing. Slowly, Harry ground their bare cocks together. Pulling away he grinned, “you ready for me baby?”
It felt like a warm fizzy bubble was filling in his belly, rising, trying to float up his throat. Dimly, Draco realised this is what hope must feel like. “I’ve been full on in love with you since I was fourteen, Potter, I’m not in a position to throw anything anywhere.”
Harry watches her while crickets sing, and the lake laps against the shore, and for once her walls seem to come down. The night holds so many secrets, and Draco looks so wrecked, like she might burst. Harriet wishes she could pull her close, hold her together, maybe never even let go. And in this moment, Harry thinks Draco might let her.
Draco nodded and closed his eyes. "When you told those two off on the second day of the term." It was pouring that day and Draco was using his free hour to go apologize to Hagrid. Rather than waste time to store his school supplies in his room, or risk them getting them stolen by hiding them somewhere, he brought them with him. He was using his wand as an umbrella until someone stole it from his grip. Draco was drenched within seconds and his papers and books didn't last much longer.
Harry said their thanks and the two of them went back to the dorms. Harry followed Draco into his room and watched as he fell onto his stomach on his bed. He closed the door and lied on his back next to Draco. "Do you want to postpone our date to tomorrow?"
When they reached the common room, Luna stood on her tiptoes to kiss Draco on the cheek before pulling Pansy up the stairs to her room. Draco looked after them for a moment before assuming his usual seat in the corner in front of the fire.
Like he said he would be, Harry was waiting outside the office door and Draco's stomach was in knots. He'd had enough confrontation to last the rest of his life and McGonagall still kind of terrified him. As soon as he noticed Draco standing in front of him, Harry instantly saw the singed ends of his hair and once again looked angry.
When their classes let out at the end of the day, they made their way to the Great Hall for dinner. They separated without a word, Potter just tapping his shoulder before turning away. Draco found where Pansy was sitting and from the corner of his eye he could see Potter sit next to his friends and the solemn, tired persona was covered with the mask he wore around everyone but him.
Draco made to get up but his limbs were tangled in one of the many old quilts that were draped around the room. He stared at the warm blanket in confusion for longer than he knew was appropriate. This wasn't the first time this had happened. He had fallen asleep in the common room before, and every time he woke up there was a blanket wrapped around him. Draco could only think of one person who would be this kind to him and he knew that Pansy only woke up when the sun rose once she was asleep.
It hardly felt like he got any work done by the time everyone was getting ready to head down to breakfast. Draco waited until he was sure everyone had left for the Great Hall before he started getting ready. He walked to the bathroom and got in the shower before waiting for the water to warm up. When he stepped out was when the water started becoming more bearable. As hard as he tried not to, Draco saw himself in the mirror and didn't flinch away from the ugly sight before him. His hair was getting longer and he hated it, it reminded him too much of HIM. The bags under his eyes looked black against his pale skin, looking wraith-like in his dark school robes.
"You have a free pass too." Draco said when he was almost asleep. Harry made a confused noise and shifted a little, so he would be looking at Draco if his eyes were open. "To save me. If you think I need your help, unless I tell you no, you're welcome to jump in whenever."
Until Harry started humming. It was a muggle song that he might have heard before, but he couldn't remember where. He felt his shoulders drop and his hands stopped shaking. Draco didn't feel Harry cutting his hair, but he could hear it falling to the floor under the sound of Harry's voice.
They laid there like that for a while, and at some point, Harry grabbed Draco's hand and laced their fingers.
Draco nodded and shifted just a hair closer, like that would extend the bubble that was around him. And in a way that's exactly what he was doing. He could feel the stares of confusion and the accompanying whispers but as soon as he looked around and glared at anyone he caught looking in their direction they looked away.
Draco held Harry's hand tighter when he made to get up. It was nice not being alone, he didn't want to be alone again. "I'll be right back. Promise." Harry smiled, a small but real smile. Like the one he used to see before everything started going to hell. It had been such a long time since Draco had seen that smile and it shocked him at how much he missed it. He trusted that smile. Draco nodded and let him go.
They didn't speak after that, they both just fell asleep, neither waking up from a nightmare. They woke up when they heard everyone moving around getting ready for the day. Draco expected Harry to get up and leave to get ready, but he waited with him until everyone had left.
No malice or mocking. He knew he sounded as desperate to be saved by Potter as Potter was to save him.
Draco paused his own fingers to think about how to answer that. "Because you're the only to ever put any effort into
The two walked next to each other as they made their way to potions and Draco found he was content with it. That realization tripped him, his foot catching on an uneven stone. Potter's grip, gentile but strong, was the only thing that kept him from falling to the ground. Potter only let go when he nodded in thanks, to say he was good.
And Draco couldn't find himself to hate or enjoy this fact. He was so pleased that they weren't fighting anymore, but at the same time it felt like he had to be walking on eggshells in fear of losing whatever it was that was between them.
Draco knew that Potter wasn't doing it to defend him, rather using him as a shield. Nobody wanted to be within five feet of him, if they had the option he doubted they would stay in whatever room he just entered. And when Draco realized that Potter was using him as a people repellent, he thought he'd be furious. He thought he'd demand Potter to leave him be and storm off in the other direction. But he didn't say anything to him.
"I don't think I'm going to do anything for a while after we graduate. I feel like I need to just vanish for a while. Only see some people long enough to assure them that I'm not dead, but nothing more than that."
Along with many more insults and slurs were thrown at him by the two seventh years. They pushed him to the ground and one of them kicked him in the stomach. Draco knew that they would have continued if Harry hadn't stepped in.
"Professor, what's the schools policy on bullying?" Harry asked right out of the gate. He stood tall and looked her in the eye when he spoke.
When she had gone, Draco realized that he was the only one left in the room. It was a clear night and he could see the moon casting its silver light across the floor, the only other thing lighting the room beside the fire. He didn't move from his spot. He could feel sleep pulling at him, days without substantial sleep weighing his limbs down until they were too heavy for him to move.
Tears started running down his temples. Draco lifted their joined hands and attempted to wipe them away. Eventually Harry stopped crying and Draco had no idea how to comfort him so he just moved closer, so their shoulders were touching all the way to their hands. Thankfully, this seemed to make Harry relax a little.
when I'm with you and I'm grateful for that." The entire time he was speaking, Harry didn't take his eyes off the enchanted ceiling. Draco's gaze hadn't left Harry since he started talking.
This was one of his favorite things about the evenings. Just being in the company of these two and not being expected to say a word or do more than just walk.
He didn't know why he always sat there to look into the fire, he knew it would lull him to sleep and that was the last thing he wanted to do. Sleep meant nightmares and that meant less energy than he had before. But his room, despite his efforts to keep it as messy and disorganized as he could, it still always seemed to resemble his room in the manor.
Draco curled into a ball, facing away from Harry. His eyes were stinging and he let out an ugly sob. He knew that Harry's anger was directed to the people who did this to him but it still felt like he was about to be yelled at. He'd been yelled at one too many times by his father, that was quickly followed by one beating or another. His breathing got shorter and more uneven as he remembered how it felt when the bruises formed, the blinding white pain when he had to mend his own wounds. Never once letting anyone see the pain he was in, that would just ensure another scolding that was worse.
There was a split second where Harry felt the heat of flames pressing around them, smoke making it hard to breathe, but at the feeling of arms tightening around him, Harry was pulled back to the present. The war was over and they were both out of danger.
Harry sat up and moved into Draco's line of sight. He didn't say a word as he reached forward and put his cold hands on Draco's cheeks. It gave him a feeling to focus on. Grounded him in one present sensation.
Harry might have been falling asleep, but that offer had Draco siting up wide awake. Every wish he never had the chance or courage to daydream about exploding in his head. Lazy Sundays, slow mornings, nights by a fire with a quilt over their laps, evenings on the porch watching the sun go down, games of footsies at breakfast, laughing in a garden, hip checking each other while making dinner, sitting on a roof stargazing. Everything he couldn't afford to dream about keeping him quiet and still.
me. Without acting like it's a favor to cash in later. And that day you saved me from those two without asking me, without waiting for me to ask, you just did because you
Harry always loved flying. The first time he flew he thought there was nothing that he could do that would make him feel as free. He sometimes found himself being jealous of Hedwig for being able to fly whenever she pleased. The cooling evening air pulling his hair and clothes, his hair blown out of his face. The thrill of being so high off the ground and going as fast as he could made his blood rush in a way nothing else has been able to do.
Draco made his way to his room and made sure all the lights were on and the candles were lit before he shut the door. His room was a mess and he couldn't bring himself to clean it or let the house elves clean it for him.  He sat at his desk and started doing his homework
Draco guided Potter to his bed and let him get situated before he cast silently a charm on his ceiling. A charm that was totally invisible with how bright it was. He had gotten very good at casting this particular charm without speaking, when the manor wasn't home anymore, just a place for monsters to torment others.
"Sounds more fun than fighting for a booth or seat at Three Broomsticks." Harry kissed the top of his head again and Draco smiled. He like this very much.
"I'm not gonna be a Auror." Harry said not long after they had settled. They were lying in pretty much the exact position as before, holding hands but not much contact besides that. "Only McGonagall knows. She's actually the one who brought it up. I've seen too much action and fighting and I wouldn't be able to handle anymore of it."
Draco shut the door and locked it. Harry's tone was so even when he spoke that Draco had no idea he was crying until he tried breathing in. Draco dropped his bag by his desk and sat on the bed near Harry's head. He ran his hand over his shoulder and into his hair. With as unruly as it was, Draco was fully expecting his fingers to get caught in knots.
He had no idea of how much time had passed, but at one point Potter entered the room and made a beeline for where he was sitting. Neither said a word as he sat a little too close and made himself comfortable. He pulled the nearest quilt from where it was resting and draped it over both their laps.
"It has changed because the war is over, for good. There are no more sides anymore. And even though there are probably still splinter groups and factions, you and I are on the same side." Harry watched Draco sit up straighter but didn't let go of his legs. "You can chose if you want to help fight against those small groups, you can chose to watch from the side lines, or you can do something like I'm doing."
Draco went through the day absentmindedly. He only half heard all the lectures. Only half felt all the little hexes that hit him. Only half saw the slurs that burned themselves into his desk or wrote themselves across his notes.
The solutions she offered didn't sound promising to Draco, and he was grateful that Harry asked if there was anything else that could be done.
Harry repositioned how he was sitting and pulled Draco into his lap. He tucked Draco's head under his chin and tried to coax those slender fingers from blond hair. Harry started humming a song he'd heard a lot while he was on the run. A song he felt was a good representation of what happened to him and who he is.
But Harry's smile just grew. He waited until Draco looked at him before moving or saying anything. "That's good, cause I've felt the same for a while too. I don't know what rumors you might have heard, but I don't just go around kissing people. Anything you heard during sixth year does not count."
When he woke up he was lying in bed properly. His head was resting on Harry's chest with one arm over his stomach and his leg over Harry's. Draco breathed out and felt something fluttering in his chest. He liked waking up like this. He wanted to wake up like as much as he could.
They wouldn't be disturbed here. Still, as an extra precaution, Harry put a glamor over the clearing so incase anyone decided to go flying, they wouldn't find this spot. At least not today.
Slowly, the headmistress looked through his notes. Her eyes carefully reading everything that was clearly not Draco's own writing. "And I take it that this is just from today?" Draco nodded when he took back his notes.
"Is Draco in his room?" This made Harry's smile widen. When Hermione apologized, Harry said it would be nice if she tried to forgive Draco for the things he was forced to do.
"I'll stay right here. Go to sleep now, I won't let anything or anyone hurt you. I promise." Harry tightened his hold of Draco and he was asleep almost instantly.
Harry shut the door behind them and was pulled away from the wall by his hand. Draco fell, and simultaneously pulled Harry down onto the bed. They kept giggling, neither being able to calm down.
"Why not doing that together?" Harry yawned and sat up, rubbing at his eyes. He needed to get them back before he fell asleep. "Move in with me when we graduate."
Draco didn't sigh, he didn't mumble when he said the password to enter the dorms, he didn't look at his feet when he walked to where Pansy was sitting. He didn't fall into the cushions when he sat down, he didn't slouch. He was raised better than that. He knew better.
Her look turned calculating. Draco was curled in on himself and looking at the floor. She noticed the small tendril of smoke still rising from his hair and he was holding his bag like there was something secret in there. Nothing like the proud boy he used to be.
"I'm sorry. If you want me to leave I will, but I didn't want to go anywhere else." Harry said. His back was to Draco, who was still standing shocked in the doorway. The wet sniff is what got Draco moving again.
Harry told Draco to get into some comfy clothes and wait for him to get back. He left the room and was walking through the common room when Hermione called to him.
Friday's choices of slurs, curses and hexes were more colorful and creative than they had been. Everyone taking issue with the fact that Harry Potter wanted to be in Draco's presence. By the time he was walking up the stairs to the headmistress's office Draco's hair was smoking and his hands were scraped. There were probably bruises on his knees from the three times he was tripped in the same hallway but he didn't want to think about it.
Harry sighed and smiled. "Thank you. And thank you for talking to him. It means a lot to me." Hermione nodded and Harry continued on his way back to Draco's room. "Draco, it's me can I come in?" He didn't knock and didn't open the door. Harry waited until he heard an affirming noise from inside to push the door open.
There was a reason why it wasn’t allowed for spouses to be field partners. A reason why this was the case not only in the UK MLE, but also in muggle police departments all over the world. But Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter weren’t known for their regard for any rules. Even their own.
Soon after the war ended, Harry threw himself head first into making their world as safe as it could realistically be. He worked tirelessly and his Gryffindor idiot friends Weasley and Longbottom worked with him. He put the men who would come round the manor for dinner when Draco was a child behind bars--giving them a fair trial to boot. Draco admired Potter. Pansy would say he pined after him. He was inclined to agree.
“Look! There’s something happening by the loo--come on!” And Harry was off, and pulling Draco along behind him.
Once, Draco asked why he spent so much time there. At the time, he wished he hadn’t. To Harry, his chest was a map of everything he had to apologise for. Every kiss a plea for a forgiveness that Draco cannot give. How can he forgive Harry for something that he never blamed Harry for? For something he had deserved. Harry hadn’t liked that explanation at all, but he did get a little less sad-eyed now when Draco had his shirt off. These days it’s his mission to put marks of love over as many of the fissions he can.
Buffy set two cups of tea on the kitchen table and shuffled out of the room. Pansy pulled the empty chair around the table so it was only an inch or two from Draco’s, and sat down, body tilted towards him. She placed a hand on his shoulder, “do you want to talk about what happened, love?”
It was like a spring had been released. Instantly, Draco’s arms were off the bed, and he wrapped himself like a limpet around Harry’s strong shoulders. Effectively sitting himself up. The change in angle made Harry’s breath catch, and back quiver. Draco buried his face in the curve of Harry’s neck, as the other man adjusted his legs on either side of Draco’s waist. The blond let out a series of soft
stupid,” the blond whispered into the slim space between their faces, and then he was pulling the bumbling Gryffindor into a tentative little kiss. More of a brush of the lips than anything. He leaned back to look Harry properly in the eye.
Harry rolled his eyes before leaning back down, this time scooting to settle between Draco’s thighs, and attacking the milky skin of his neck with nipping kisses. “C’mon, babe, it’s hotter doing it by hand,” he mumbled against his boyfriend’s pulse. “Let--me--take--my--time,” Harry muttered, following the cut of Draco’s open collar with his mouth leaving pink little marks between each word.
Harry kissed him on the cheek. “Good boy, Dray.” He moved to whisper in Draco’s ear, “now, I’m gonna get you out of these clothes, then you’re going to watch me open myself up by hand, and you’re going to keep your hands flat on the bed baby. That alright with you?”
The cigarette butt in Potter’s hand glowed blue and Draco guided Goyle’s into contact with the tiny disgusting thing before touching it himself with just the tip of his pinky. There was the naval jerk and spin, and in seconds they were in one of the suspect intake rooms of the MLE and Harry was speaking.
“Goyle, this room is magic-blocked and warded, there is an attached loo to your left, and water in the pitcher on the table,” Harry indicated toward the table in the middle of the room that had a chair on either side and a jug and glass on top of it. “We are going to change, and return to conduct your interview in five minutes. Please, make yourself at home.”
“Harry, the only thing that’s off is that I have not the foggiest what you said to make anything weird.”
“So this is what all that brattiness at work was about then? Getting me to take you home and ruin you?”
The one--not advantage per say--but, perhaps a silver lining, of having to walk to Potter’s flat, was that it meant Harry had to let him in. Which has also meant that it’s not rare for Draco to get tugged into his boyfriend’s flat only to get pressed against the inside of the front door to be thoroughly snogged. Which is hot as a dragon’s clutch.
Ginny pulls her legs in, kicking the quaffle between them to use as an armrest for their joined hands, and leans her head on Harry’s shoulder with a sigh. Her bright, quidditch-knotted hair, spilling from her bun into her eyes, she sighs wistfully, “she likes searching for new spots and counting them. With her tongue.”
The Boy Who Lived was currently staring blankly at their red string-covered case wall. Chewing on his bottom lip, brows screwed together in contemplation, he was idly tapping his wand to his desk, unknowingly sending little sparks out with every ‘click’ against the wood. His dark hair was wilder than usual, given the hours he’d been tugging at it in frustration while reading through their case files, and his glasses were discarded on their office bookshelf (meaning he really was just blindly glaring at the wall). In other words, Harry Potter looked positively adorable, and all Draco wanted in that moment was to cuddle him close and snog him senseless. But. They’re at work.
Like a lion pack!) would be put at stake. But that wasn’t so. As far as life at the Ministry was concerned Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were nothing more than friends and auror partners. As far as Robards and Minister Shaklebolt knew, they were nothing more than the dream team.
“OI!” He snapped, causing Harry to startle out of his daze and whip his head around towards Draco’s voice. The blond suppressed a smirk. “Pay attention to me!” He whined.
Draco’s tongue twitched out in a kitten lick. A question. “You can touch how you want, Dray,” Harry rasped.
Ginny smiled through the salt in her eyes and fell into his arms on a watery laugh. Harry turned his face into her hair, which smelled as sweet as always, but he found himself craving something else. Someone else.
at you all the time,” she mumbles. “I just. Sometimes it’s mad, to think about how long we knew each other,” she spits out. Draco is quiet for a moment, and Harriet thinks she’s done. But Draco looks away, “I’m only going to say this
over the two of them. Then he managed to vanish the duvet and then un-vanish it so it was on top of them. Then pulled Draco to lay half over his chest; a pale cheek over a filigree locket scar. Draco pressed a kiss to the waxy raise of scar tissue, another sign that Harry had survived, somehow, and ended up
It had been ridiculously easy to go from lovers to roommates. The only real change was that they no longer kissed, and that they had a new topic of conversation for their all nighters. Namely pining after their respective blonds. They had decided not to tell anyone besides Ron and Hermione just yet, to avoid awkward questions while they were still settling in. A month into the break up Luna started staying over in Ginny’s room and Harry would walk in to grab breakfast and find the two women giggling over scones and jam; clearly sickeningly in love.
Draco blinked realising that he’d missed the fact that Harry’d began his adorable nervous prattling again. “Potter, shush.”
“Speaking of Hermione, maybe we should return you to her for the night before you asphyxiate Longbottom with more of your sordid sexual endeavours with your fiancé,” Draco suggested dryly.
Harry kept his hips swiveling infinitesimally, working Draco through his orgasm. He ran his finger nails softly up and down his spine lovingly. “You sound so pretty for me, baby.” Harry murmured into soft blond hair, soothing, but obviously tense with his own need for completion. He kissed open-mouthed along Draco’s ear and beautifully high cheek bone. “’m gonna pull off now, okay, Dray?”
The Boy Who Lived continued with his path of love bites until he reached the first fastened button. He pulled the little shell piece between his teeth, tugging back playfully. “If you wreck my shirt, you won’t be given access to my arse, dearest.”
Malfoy nodded, understanding, “If you need anything--I just hope someday we can be friends?” It sounded so cliché, but Astor could see that the man truly meant it. He smiled sadly as Draco apparated away.
After pulling his briefs on, Draco stood, walked to where his trousers were heaped on the floor, picked them up, and spelled the creases out, before stepping into them as well. “You don’t like me much do you, Draco?”
The man in question stood as soon as he caught sight of her and said in a panicked rush, “Pansy, I’m so sorry I had no idea you had someone over. I’ll just head home, I know you’ve been waiting to bring Millie home for ages, get back to them, I--”
But Harry hasn’t found someone she can voice this to yet. And despite what their world believes, it’s not Harriet’s place to decide when the grieving should forgive. Despite what many have been lead to believe, Harriet isn’t the one who has lost the most. Her mind healer tells her she isn’t to blame, and she’s decided not to blame Draco either.
“Why do you look at me all the time?” Harriet wonders aloud, opening one eye to see Draco blush and stutter, and let her long silky blond hair down, only to twist it back up into its pony tail.
It was all Draco could do not to swoon at the display of physical strength. And wasn’t that where Astor had been wrong. Seeker’s build. Sure, Harry was a good three inches shorter than himself, but he’d filled out since school. Now he was all broad shoulders and muscled thighs and
Hannah smiled at them and slid their drinks across the bar. “If you see him before I do tell him I’ve got Sunday off, yeah?”
After he finished at Hogwarts he started in the Auror Academy--the waive on joining the MLE without the three year training expired only months after it was put in place. Once he completed the training and joined the Aurors he was assigned a field partner. Originally Robards had paired him with Longbottom, but the other blond was reluctant to work with someone who had bullied him without cause through all of school. Thus Draco Malfoy became Harry Potter’s partner, and Longbottom and Weasley paired up. The four of them ended up on many ops together as well.
There were tears leaking from his eyes now, but he didn’t bother to wipe them away. “When are you leaving?” Harry said around a throat thick with that fear of being left, again, with no family.
She yawned and put her wand to the key hole to unlock the wards; she shuffled inside. The lights were on, so she scanned the room while toeing off her shoes. She froze when he eyes fell to their sofa. Well, Harry wouldn’t be needing her help cheering up, that was for sure. There were clothes scattered around their sitting room set, and Draco and Harry were cuddled up close together on the sofa, naked, squished into each other chest to chest. One of Malfoy’s feet hung off the edge because the man had scooted down enough to tuck his face into the crook of Harry’s neck. Their legs were twined together, and if it weren’t for the difference in their skin tones, it would have been hard to tell what belonged to who.
Harry shrugs Ginny off her with a shudder. “Please stop making me picture you and Luna fucking. You’re both like my sisters.”
He couldn’t see them together, the burn in his eyes too humiliating. Draco turned on his heel and apparated to Pansy’s to lick his wounds with his best friend.
“So,” Dean’s voice shook Harry from his thoughts of sleepy cuddles. “You and Malfoy finally got your act together?”
Draco felt compelled to look up, just from the feeling of Potter’s eyes on him. When their eyes met Harry said, “You don’t owe me anything.” And strangely Draco almost believed it. Harry handed him a cup of tea. Draco sat in his desk chair and took a sip. It was perfect.
Harry giggled at the sight of a flushed and turned on Malfoy bouncing on his bed. “You were saying baby?”
He had to swallow thickly before he could reply, “I--you’re just so--you look so perfect in my flat.” He could feel his cheeks burning, but he didn’t look away from Draco’s face.
“Harry,” Draco’s voice came out wrecked and reedy, having been on edge for so long, now to be, literally, thrust head on into white hot pressure. “Last?”
Green eyes narrowed, Harry stood. Ran a hand through his messy hair. “Christ, Malfoy, you’re doing this on purpose aren’t you”
Draco began to shake slightly. He’d thought he was done with the part of his life where he hurt those close to him. The last thing he wanted was to become for Greengrass what Potter was to him. But that’s what he was doing. He dropped down to his knees on the floor, so he was looking up into Astor’s face. “I’m so sorry, I didn’t know, I would never have strung you along if I would have known, Astor. You’re a great wizard, and any man would be lucky to have you.” Astor sighed, pushed Draco’s bangs back like he wore them in school. He could see the sincerity in the man’s face.
. The blond auror did as he was told and cast the hand binding and apparition preventing charms on Goyle in a daze, while his so called 'partner' prepared their portkey back to the ministry.
“Fuck,” Draco breathed, threading his fingers into Harry’s black hair like he’d been dying to do back at work.
“Oh, Darling,” Pansy crooned at the sight of her best friend standing on her doorstep in the London rain, face tense and drawn. She pulled her dressing gown tighter around her shoulders and tied the belt around waist with a snap. Of course Draco would have a break down and show up at her door the night she finally got Millie to make a move. “Come in, love.”
Harriet stares at her, floored. She thinks back through all the years of antagonizing, all the moments her attraction distilled into annoyance and mistrust. The flashes of jealousy. Because there was no way Draco would ever want her back.  But here she is, taking Harry’s hand off her stomach, lacing their fingers, and bending over her. Kissing her.
Draco ended up testifying in nearly every death eater’s trial, he’d floo in in between classes, or send in vials of his memory, knowing they were locked up helped the night terrors. It also meant that Potter was there while he shook through the memories and relived everything he’d done to destroy Harry and the world they both lived in. The Slytherin had expected Harry to be cold, resentful, guarded, but that was never the case. He would just listen, he didn’t seem to care what side Draco had been on now that he was clearly unravelling just to be on the
Harry had Draco pushed up against the door to his flat. Draco would have liked to apparate directly on to his lover’s bed, but the (rightfully) paranoid idiot had wards up so that only himself and his flatmate could apparate into the house. Everyone else had to use the apparition point in Stockwell tube station. Either that or use the floo or a portkey. Side-along didn’t even work. It was infuriating to have to walk five minutes to simply visit his boyfriend. Muggles deserve an award for all the stupid walking they have to do.
“If Hannah made you pay for it all, you’d definitely be sleeping on your mum’s sofa tonight,” Neville teased.
The knot that had begun to twist in his chest loosened a small fraction, at least Ginny didn’t hate him for being a terrible boyfriend. He watched as the woman took a deep breath. Ginny looked him in the eye. “I think that I’m a lesbian.”
Draco visibly flinched at the mention of Ron’s sister, his light mood vanishing, sure, at work it was him and Harry versus the world, but outside of that? They were workmates, pub friends, and at the end of the night Harry went home to the flat he shared with Ginny. Because Harry Potter was tragically straight. Draco was so caught up in his sudden brooding that he didn’t notice the cause of his suffering trying to catch his eye. By the time he snapped out of his reverie Harry had turned away to greet the woman who was living the life Draco wanted.
“Don’t ask me,” Draco mumbled, “I’ve never been one for the fairer sex.” He’d spoken quietly, not sure he was ready for the boys to hear, unsure of how they would react.
Draco’s breath hitched at the unnecessary display of strength. In the back of his mind, he noted that Harry would have to
Fingers splayed and rigid against the dark grey duvet cover; face flushed; lips bitten and kissed all red; pupils blown wide; ribcage rising and falling in heaves; chest covered in rosy and wine coloured blooms; cock hard and weeping against his taught lower abs; long legs loosely splayed open, the only thing about Draco that wasn’t straining. Harry’s own cock was straining in his jeans.
thank you to Tanvi my smut queen for helping me with this chapter. Lol you are my everything. Let me know if you like this!! Please feedback is everything! Thanks for reading!
Draco was frozen in shock at this new information. Harry James Potter was interested in men. His chest swelled with hope until he remembered that Harry, bi or not, was with Ginny. Living with Ginevra fucking Weasley. Draco was shook from his thoughts by Potter’s elbow connecting with his side. “Wha?”
“I wouldn’t worry, mate, she really likes you, I reckon,” Ron replied as if he hadn’t got the bomb that Draco had been trying to drop. He turned to Draco with a roll of his eyes. “And who talks like that anymore, mate, your princess is showing! ‘Fairer sex?!’ Just cus you don’t fancy ‘em doesn’t mean you need to turn them into china dolls.”
Harry looked down, chastened, “Sorry that was shit of me to say. Do you--” he glanced up at her, face flushed, red hair pulled back into a messy bun, warm brown eyes watching him carefully. His eyes burned. With guilt, with heartbreak. Ginny had just come out to him and he was accusing her of cheating. Ginny would probably be leaving. His voice came out ragged, “I love you, Gin, no matter what, yeah?”
Cringing inwardly at the obvious come-on he’d just shot at a taken man (who he was very much in love with), Draco flushed and turned to his coat stand immediately to fiddle with his bag and cloak. Of course, this also meant he missed Harry’s bashful smile and shrug, and assumed the man’s silence was a move of tactful feigned deafness. That he was letting the comment flit away to spare his friend the humiliation.
“Right, I just coined Gin, she’s gonna come side-along you home, I think she wanted to pick up a book from Hermione. That’s what she said this morning, anyway.”
There was the sound of a chair scraping the floor, and the squeak of Potter’s out-of-dress-code muggle trainers as the man undoubtedly made his way over to Draco from the desk on the opposite wall of the small room. “Morning, Draco.”
Harry run her free hand through the curls on top of her head, down the shaved back. She’d like to say they are friends now, but the word isn’t quite right. Draco has taken to staring more than was their norm as enemies, and frankly, it was starting to drive Harriet mad. Shimmering gray eyes boring into her skull, blonde lashes blinking her gaze away after a beat of eye contact. Harry wanted to drown in the storm-fog of Draco’s eyes. Learn the pain there in the shadows. Their lives have always stretched as parallel lines. Opposite sames. Sometimes Harriet laughs: the pale, delicate, white rose, born on the dark side; the dusty, sandpaper rough, knotgrass, born on the light. It makes her wonder if those words mean anything at all.  Draco, standing in her cold cold house, telling Bellatrix Lestrange that the swollen face before her is not Harriet Potter, makes it feel all the more random.
Good riddance. Draco was thankful for such a quick wrapping case, seriously, he’s not sure he could take another club scouting with Potter dressed to pull. That aside there was always something so satisfying about receiving, planning, and closing a case in the span of only two weeks. They’d even managed to get all the stupid paperwork done (no thanks to Harry who’d spent the last two hours folding paper cranes and tossing them at his partner’s desk instead of finishing his share of the logging).  Draco set down his quill and crumpled the newest crane in his fist without looking up.
In response, Harry licked a little at the flushed head of Draco’s cock and softly fondled his balls through the layer of cloth. After a moment of this he sat back on his knees so he could drag the trousers down pale thighs. When the garment was at Draco’s knees, Harry moved to stand at the edge of the bed and pulled it clean off. He took a moment to just stare down at his naked lover.
it in the morning. And buy him a new one. But in the forefront of his mind, all Draco could think was:
“What have you been up to lately?” he asked, but just as he did, the Floo roared to life again and out stepped Cordelia Rigsby, followed at once by Theo. Draco rose at the sight of his friend, knowing he had lost Astoria’s attention for the rest of the night.
“You’re welcome to come and have Christmas dinner with us,” she said. “Laurel will be back for the holidays as well.”
Before opening up the shop today, he took the extra few steps down the south side of Diagon Alley to Prospero’s Potions Emporium. It was still early enough, and it had been a while since he had stopped by to catch up with Theo. The young shop assistant, Willa, looked up when the door opened and waved when she recognized him.
Harry sighed heavily, feeling a flood of unidentifiable emotions fill his chest. He wondered how to approach the topic, whether to bring up all the conversations he and Draco had had in their sessions in their last year of Hogwarts, about the war and their childhoods; whether to talk about the strange feeling in his stomach that he’d experience when Draco would look at him; whether to jump right to the pivotal moment, that kiss that had sent him into months of confusion and contemplation.
“Oh,” Potter said, starting to walk towards the middle of the room, towards Draco. “Why would you think this was his idea?”
There were numerous unusual things Draco had learned about Harry Potter in the two years they had been working together.
” said Harry again, feeling his stomach start to twist in nervousness at the prospect of facing Draco again.
Still, Draco couldn’t help but feel the keen sting of being such an embarrassing secret that Potter couldn’t even trust it with his closest friends, friends he told everything to. It was a difficult position to be in, knowing that what he had with Potter was already far more than he deserved, and still constantly, desperately wanting more.
He looked up to see who had come in to the common room and saw Weasley and his girlfriend, the Gryffindor girl with dark hair and freckles whose name Draco could never remember. Weasley looked towards the window and met Draco’s eyes before Draco could look away. He said something to his girlfriend, and not a second later, he was marching towards Draco with a determined look on his face.
“You need to leave,” she said. “If he finds you, he will kill you. He’s…he’s clever and he’s tricky. He doesn’t play fair, he sets traps. He’s…pure evil.”
He felt like he was being pushed underwater, his throat constricting and his breath speeding up. His stomach began churning at once and he almost pulled his arm back with regret.
He grinned at her and waved, before turning back to the path up to Hogwarts. He really did have to start on that Defence essay.
Well, it wasn’t exactly comfortable, but he sincerely hoped it didn’t have to be painful. Nevertheless, he made sure to lock his trunk and put up wards once his bed curtains were drawn. One could never be too careful.
“You can consider this a courtesy visit, Jamison,” said Granger. “I’m here to offer you the opportunity to release Draco Malfoy from the
“What are you doing, Lovegood?” The question burst out of Draco like rushing water breaking a dam. “Why are you talking to me? Why are you being nice to me? You were a prisoner in my dungeons, Lovegood, my aunt
“Pansy said,” Draco spoke breathlessly. “That when you broke into the Ministry in our fifth year, you found out that the Department of Mysteries studies time?”
He flushed, feeling like he could’ve phrased that question much better. Thankfully, Neville didn’t point that out.
“It’s just a dream,” he told himself, for the umpteenth time, as he readied himself for bed. “You’re going to wake up, and you’ll see it was just a long and strange dream.”
When a department isn’t properly monitored and regulated and don’t need to answer to the DMLE, they feel entitled to do whatever they want!”
“Earth to Potter,” suddenly Malfoy’s fingers were right in front of his face, snapping quickly. “Merlin, I knew you were slow, but even Goyle was quicker than this.”
Rosmerta blinked a few times, but seemed to regain her composure much quicker. She cleared her throat and spoke in a clear voice, although not with as much ease as her usual demeanour.
“Oh, erm, I’ll have a peppermint tea. And the Manchester tart I had last time was wonderful, I’ll have that again.”
“Do you think we should talk to her anyway? See what she has to say? Maybe we’ll learn something about Clarence.”
Harry leaned over the potion and saw that, indeed, it had begun to bubble and froth where the liquid met the cauldron.
“Right, yes. Well, Potter was standing there, and Pansy sort of just…pointed at him, and insisted that we do it. Mind you, I don’t entirely blame her,” he said, shrugging when the rest of them looked at him curiously. “We thought they were going to come in and murder us all, and what did we care for Potter? One life for all of ours? But, of course, it wasn’t the smartest move, especially considering how loyal most of the student body was to McGonagall and to Potter. Not to mention how she had been treating rulebreakers.”
Draco watches a large dark mass speed from one side to another, and he halts. At the top of the cave wall, hangs the enormous black dragon, his glowing green eyes peering down at him. Draco takes a sharp inhale before he starts running out of the cave. As Draco makes it to the rocky stairs, the dragon appears in front of him, his large wings expanded from side to side.
ended. Thinking about instantly returning to duelling and defensive spellwork made his stomach queasy.
” Hermione interjected. “I’ll try and think of someone for you, but keep an open mind, alright? Don’t just shoot everyone down.”
certain. As he walked towards the door, however, Potter’s hand reached out and grabbed his arm, his fingers wrapping right around where, under his robes, Draco’s Dark Mark was.
Without warning, out of nowhere, Draco’s mind supplied a face, a skinny face, with sharp cheekbones and bright, shining green eyes. Draco forced the thought away, not daring to even think the name that was barrelling itself through his brain nonetheless.
sorry. I was out of line. Especially…you’re not like your father, at all, really. I was just…trying to get you angry, I suppose.”
“You can grind the ginger root,” he said, not looking up at Harry, but sliding over a mortar and pestle.
Hermione, however, had already mentioned him twice while discussing certain research she had begun for her apprenticeship.
Harry didn’t understand Malfoy’s sudden change in demeanour. He was suddenly quieter, more withdrawn. He had pulled his hand back and away from the table.
Unforgivables? Violet, Luna, Ollivander, they all seemed to believe he was hiding some heart of gold under all of his abysmal decisions, but Potter had
So here he was, in what looked like the middle of nowhere, hiking up the hill atop which sat Ollivander’s house. It wasn’t colossal and intimidating like the Manor, but it was elegant, with tall white pillars and golden adornments around the windows. Draco had only been here once before, as most of their meetings were held in the store.
“I don’t know why,” Harry said, which was the truth. He didn’t have feelings for Ginny anymore, he hadn’t had them in a long time. So why was the thought of her and Heidi now constantly floating around in his head?
Truthfully, he didn’t think himself much braver now, but he’d seen so many terrible things—witnessed so many tragedies—that he figured he could deal with being punched a few times by an angry Gryffindor. It was bound to happen at some point.
But it hadn’t been a solitary incident. Lucius seemed to find some sort of power in it, in having someone under his control like that, and since all the other Death Eaters had lost respect for him, the only person that could be was Draco.
“Well,” Draco said, slowly. “I was thinking about the trees used for wand woods and how many of them are significant in Muggle culture as well.”
Harry had smiled, relieved, knowing that he was forgiven. Hermione had easily picked up on the fact that he was feeling better as well, and since he had promised her that he would begin visiting a Mind Healer in the summer, she had stopped looking so worried all the time.
Harry had to admit, he much preferred Ron and Hermione post-break up. The first week was admittedly a little awkward between the two of them, but after that, they slipped easily back into old rhythms, and Harry felt like he really had his friends back.
“The Elder Wand is a fascinating case to consider,” said Ollivander, quietly. “Not much is known about it, as it is a wand of legend. Prior to last year, I was not certain it truly existed. I must admit, I thought it to be merely a folk tale. The allegiance of the Elder Wand is unsentimental and faithless. It is only loyal to strength, switching its allegiance entirely when won in a duel or battle. That is not to say that it is
“Is that because I won it?” Harry said, wincing when he realized how that sounded. Merlin, it was still hard being nice to Draco sometimes.
“Python scales, meteor dust, black cat whiskers, owl feathers, volcanic ash, spider silk, bee wings, and raven feathers.”
“I overheard Turpin and Patil whispering about it last night,” Daphne explained, referring to her and Violet’s Ravenclaw roommates. “It looks like everyone knows about it except for us.”
McGonagall regarded him, and Draco felt like she was moments away from taking points from Slytherin, but then her face cleared.
Draco couldn’t recall the last time he had sounded so ineloquent. His mother would be ashamed of him.
“Oh,” he said, remembering the day before. “It was…weirdly normal. We mainly just watched the game. It was odd though, rooting for the same team as Malfoy.”
Malfoy often didn’t make any sense to Harry. Not that he had been expecting him to be grateful or anything, but no matter how much progress they seemed to make, it appeared as though there was always going to be this underlying animosity between them.
“She wrote to me,” chimed in Blaise. “About a month or two back. Something about new beginnings and catching up over drinks. Typical Pansy drivel. I disregarded it. She’s in France, isn’t she? Been there since after the war.”
“I avoided approaching the boggart because I didn’t want to expose the class to a dead body. But you children have lived through a war. We can’t expect them all to be spiders, can we?”
Feeling ridiculous, Harry had enlisted Neville’s help in deciding what were some good plants to start a small garden with. Neville had been enthused, and Harry several times had to remind him that he was only a beginner, and did not want Venomous Tentacular overtaking his land.
The media had exploded, of course—the Queen of Quidditch and the Chosen One, it was clearly a match made in heaven. They were plastered on every front page and the crazy part was that Harry didn’t even
There was a long quiet moment after the Sorting Hat finished its song, everyone glancing at each other as if hoping someone had an explanation. Draco had never heard such a song from the Sorting Hat before, even after the Dark Lord’s return. He was constantly surprised by the complexity of the magic within Hogwarts, and the Sorting Hat was no exception.
For their first time in the field, it was damn good work, which was a direct quote from Robards, and Draco and Potter both sagged against the wall of the warehouse, catching their breath as their colleagues transported the smugglers out. They had to soon follow, for their mandatory curse evaluation, following the conflict, but as soon as they ducked out of the warehouse, flashing lights were upon them.
“I’m sorry,” Harry groaned, covering his face with his hands again. “I don’t know, I was so confused and stressed out. I probably wouldn’t have even told Hermione, but I needed someone to explain to me what happened.”
It was all Potter’s fault, really. Potter was the one who had gone and thrown in a whole new dimension to this strange friendship they had and had brought up old, buried feelings Draco didn’t know how to handle. He was the one who changed everything with one conversation, leaving Draco at a loss as to how to conduct himself. He had barely known how to conduct himself before this bombshell.
“What’s a good-looking man like you doing stuck at the bar?” a loud voice interrupted his thoughts. He turned his head wildly to find a young man smiling at him. He was rather handsome himself, with big brown eyes and curly brown hair.
want to see Draco again. Despite how staunchly he had avoided speaking about him, he couldn’t help but think about him from time to time. He wondered how he was doing, how his work was, if he was still in touch with his friend Foxblade from school, if he and Luna still spent time together. He had ached to ask Luna about him on more than one occasion, but he had always bitten his tongue. Luna was unusually perceptive, and he was always afraid if he even mentioned Draco’s name, she would somehow
“That’s great to hear,” Draco said, reaching out to squeeze his mother’s hand. “I’m glad you decided to contact her.”
He spoke so decisively it was clear there was no room to argue, so the four of them made their way to the exit of the Ministry, since it was easier to Apparate to Horizont Alley than to Floo. Concentrating on the Apparation Point by the intersection of Horizont and Carkitt Market, Harry felt the familiar unpleasant pulling sensation before it vanished and he blinked twice as his friends all appeared around him.
Potter was looking at their cauldron, with a strange expression on his face, as if he was reading a complex and difficult book and struggling to understand it.
“She looks rather young, doesn’t she?” Hermione said, sounding somewhere between worried and judgmental.
“Okay, let’s take a break,” Harry said, as Malfoy’s carefully placed hair started to fall into his face due to his sweating forehead. Full-body healing spells were exhausting, as Harry knew all too well.
But Narcissa was fiercely determined to complete her mission, and Draco knew better than to get in her way once she had her mind set on something.
“When did that happen?” Sophie asked from beside Ron, since Ron seemed momentarily incapable of speech.
“Well, it would require you to Floo into Hogsmeade and come up to Hogwarts, of course. Professor Ashworth has told me that he has recommended a daily school for you in London. Perhaps during the weekend, we could find time to meet. I must say, I have a selfish sort of curiosity to see what your magic can do.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes so hard there was a split-second where only the whites of his eyes were visible.
“What is it then?” Potter asked, his voice lowering as well, seemingly subconsciously, as he took another tentative step forward, as if Draco were an easily-startled unicorn.
Potter’s pale face coloured prettily, and Draco cursed himself for thinking so in the middle of an argument.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh when he saw they had turned into butterflies. A soft chorus of “Ooh”s came from the classroom, in response to all the beautiful colours of the butterflies’ wings.
At this, Draco’s eyes snapped up. No matter how much more time he spent with Draco this year, Harry never stopped feeling taken aback by the sharpness in his pale eyes.
“My father was wrong about a lot of things,” Draco said, after a deep breath. “And I idolized him and believed everything he said. And I make no excuses for my behaviour, I was old enough to know better, but my actions were based on what my father had taught me. Realizing he wasn’t the man I thought he was pulled the rug out from under me and I was forced to confront the true reality.”
“I—thank you. And Granger. I didn’t even thank her. I need to thank her.” Draco turned back to the telephone booth, unsure what to do with himself. Potter reached out and grabbed at his wrist, as if trying to stop him from going back.
Draco distractedly skimmed over the article, which didn’t amount to much beyond speculation, flipping to the next page as he returned to the other room and began to dress.
I wanted to ask something I hope is alright. a few of you have used the word "q***r" in your comments, and I know that that word has been reclaimed and that you're using it in a positive way and if you are a part of the gay community, that is 100% absolutely your right.
Harry paused for a minute, absorbing this. He wasn’t sure what Ginny meant about the feelings she had, the ones she said she thought everyone had. What kind of feelings were they? He didn’t exactly have much of a frame of reference when it came to romance. The brief, disastrous relationship he had with Cho didn’t include a lot of romance, and when he thought of his relationship with Ginny, the feelings he remembered most were jealousy, and desperation, and fear, and sometimes, a sweet relief, when he held her in his arms and felt warm and content and safe.
