“Why haven’t you brought this to me yet? You know I would help in any way I could.” Unlike most would be Percival wasn’t offended, just curious.
“How did the case go?” Anna asked as she served Harry.
It was long and fluffy, white tipped with metallic golden fur. It shined in the low-light like a new galleon and Harry could figure out how it was real. Petunia had a dress that had golden thread embroidery she only brought out for business dinners, but the fur on his tail made it look like a cheap imitation.
Remus couldn’t help but sigh, wishing Sirius had not said it like that but knowing that if they weren’t absolutely clear that nothing of the like would happen Harry would be worried about this forever. “Harry, while what Sirius said was rather vulgar,” Remus shot a dirty look at his mate over Harry’s head, “What he said is true. Touching your penis, no matter for how long, won’t cause it to fall off.”
Lyle looked over at David’s awe-filled face. “We just dodged a bullet, didn’t we?” All David could do was nod before collecting himself and starting downstairs. Lyle following in his shadow so that if it came to it, he could use David’s larger body as a shield.
Godric allowed the smirk to spread across his face, “Well, first we have some items to… Well, let’s say reappropriate.” In turn, everyone else smirked as well, Helga’s the most vicious of them all.
Their little girl started to go weak in their arms. And they hurry to lift her. Her core was strained for far too long, and now that the binds were off she was trying to recoup all the magic she had lost. Godric conjured up a bed to lay her in, covers and bed hangings in a rich purple, her wild black hair fanning across the pillows. They spent a few minutes memorizing her face, taking in the beautiful blend of all their features: Helga’s slightly upturned nose and full cheeks, Rowena’s stern brow, and long face, Salazar’s eye’s and hair color and Godric’s curls and height.
Harry could only imagine what Padfoot thought of his changes.
If he didn’t know it was, Boudicca, Salazar’s Familiar, he would have momentarily panicked. She did not sport the brilliant red plumage that his friend did, but her scales gleamed the same Bloodstone mix of almost black, green scales with flecks of ruby red and silver.
“Night,” Harry replied, already half asleep.
Severus was stunned. And confused. And full of fury. For these past fifteen years, Severus had believed Lily had passed away hating him. He had wallowed in his misery, allowing it to drown him slowly.
Arthur, on the other hand, when not working would take the time to spend individual time with each of his children. Harry included. During this time he would devote all his attention to the child he was talking to, and even if he was busy doing something when one of the Weasley children came to their Father he would put down whatever he was working on to talk to them.
“Harry?” David questioned, worry filling his tone. He must have zoned out for some time for David to be so worried.
Bartok looked over at the painting of the Terradore marketplace they had hanging on one of the walls. His voice was soft, slightly hesitant. “I was stopped after court by Fudge and Dumbledore, they were rather… insistent, they conduct a home visit to assess how Harry is doing.” Everyone at the table stiffened, Tiptop gripping a steak knife as if she was about to stab someone. Harry moved closer to Anna. “I think it’s time we finally did as you suggested, Anna, and move to the manor in Terradore.”
Albus read it without touching it, disbelief growing with every word.
When the doors were completely open Harry laid his eyes upon his room for the first time. And all he could do was stand stock still, mind halting. Harry couldn’t even comprehend what was in front of him, there was a bed bigger than anything he had seen before. It had rich looking green coverings and the wood was a bleached white wood, gold inlaid runes. Harry couldn’t make out what most of them meant but he recognized the Elder Futhark runes Gifu, Jera, and Algiz. There were many others in many different runic alphabets he didn’t recognize.
(See the end of the chapter for
A soft knock announced Anna’s arrival, the woman standing in the doorway warily, unsure if now was a good time to come in. Augusta waved her in, one hand still clutching at Neville’s. Anna surveyed the other two Longbottom’s condition, strong jaw tightening and full lips thinning as she assessed them.
Sal sighed, eyes fluttering open, deep green orbs gazing back into his. His face turns into a pout, lower lip sticking out cutely. “And here I was expecting a handsome prince, but instead I’m only greeted by your ugly mug.” He gives a massive put-upon sigh.
Harry nodded, wiping at his damp face across his arm.
Sorry it's short but I hope you enjoy it nevertheless.
Helga huffed, “And you will be taking us with you, right?”
Arthur had to hide his giggle at Molly’s outraged look in a cough, as she cursed at the owl who was already long gone. She ripped open the envelope, going white as she read and then rushed out through the floo without a word.
“And who are you?” Lyle broke in, tired of trying to guess who this man might be.
The rest of the family got seated quickly, Augusta gracefully stealing the leather chesterfield armchair that Harry had only seen Bartok use. “We have a lot to talk about, but first we need to discuss the wrongful imprisonment of Lord Black.” Augusta’s face had gone stony for a reason Harry couldn’t determine.
“Me too,” Neville replied voice soothing, reaching over to cover Harry’s tightly balled hand with his own.
So now he was escorting his clients to one of the apparition rooms. They all shared a small smile, and his clients were gone. They invited his family over for a celebratory dinner and swore they would all be falling straight into bed as soon as they got home.
He couldn’t help but relax back into the seat, eyes fluttering closed at just how loved he felt at that moment. It was unlike anything else he had ever felt. After a few minutes of Harry basking in the warmth, Helix cleared his throat to get his attention. Harry sat up, embarrassed as he reached out for the next box. The Peverell ring, while welcoming, wasn’t nearly as strong as the Potter ring. When the Peverell ring touched the Potter, the two combined splitting the ring in half The Le Fay and Ravenclaw rings doing the same until there was only a single ring on his finger.
If the previous three individuals are unavailable I appoint in this order, Guardianship of Hadrian James Potter until he comes of age at eighteen.
“Not to mention we love him,” the other added.
Luckily Remus just spat it out, “We were about to have sex, Harry.”
Minerva didn’t comment on him packing away what would normally be considered school property, just helping him once she finished off the other rooms.
“James, please take care of Harry, but also don’t forget to take care of yourself. And if you find yourself ever falling in love again, know that all I want for you is to be happy, however, that happens. I have left a letter and journals for both you and Harry in the main vault. Just remember to not let Harry get into too much trouble, and don’t give him that damned cloak while he is still in school!” She giggled at the last bit, and Harry could imagine the picture in his album of her spinning around, obviously laughing and wild red hair flowing in the breeze. “For everyone else, to retrieve the gifts from me visit James for the Vault keys, I must admit it is a bit of a trick to make sure he isn’t alone. However, if James has joined me, the Goblins will distribute the keys after reading his Will. Everything else I have to say to you will be in letters in your vaults.
Remus started with the very basics in as clinical of terms as he could manage, knowing that Harry would be able to figure out the rest for himself. Before Remus could get to the subject of anal masturbation, Harry spoke up, face twisted into shock.
They were both quick to nod in agreement and pulled down their paintings.
“Salazar!” Both women squealed, tears flowing freely from Helga while Rowena tried to hold them in but failed. “You look just as handsome as always.”
“Black?” Harry questioned, having never before heard that term.
Sirius glared at Neville when he tried to get close to Harry, a growl rumbling deep in his chest until the other boy raised his hands and backed away. Harry looked up at his Godfather, confused at the man’s reaction, but Sirius just glared until Neville took a seat next to David. He then buried his face in Harry’s hair, taking in deep lung-fulls of Harry’s scent. He ignored the weird behavior to focus on Augusta, who had retaken her seat and was speaking again.
Harry was shocked out of his stupor by the parchment, which had until then had been floating, rolling itself back up with a red ribbon and dropping down to Helix’s desk. Harry finally felt the tears that were silently rolling down his cheeks. A vial of a swirling blue potion was held within his line of sight, and Harry downed it without even wondering who it was who handed it to him, but he couldn’t really think at all. His whole world was consumed by the remembered voice of his Father.
"Sorry Augusta, you were already asleep when it happened, and we didn't think it was worth waking you." Anna blushed a little at Augusta's hard look, her features clearly saying that they should have woke her.
Harry took this all in, went over the new information in his head. He considered what his parents told him about the contract Dumbledore and Molly had constructed for him and Ginny. And Harry could be nothing but furious. He wanted to make them pay for trying to trick him. He needed to make them pay, not just for him but for everyone, Harry was sure Dumbledore had done this to other people before. Mind made up he told everyone around him his decision, worried that they might think him spiteful. But none of them looked anything but approving, Augusta, Neville, and Sirius more so than anyone.
Percival had even parted with one of the Graves family wards from their grimoire. Which was what Lyle was currently working on; the man had jumped for joy and started ranting about how elegant the rune set was.
This story is a rewrite/remix of
Everyone was down in the sunroom, waiting for the two boys to start breakfast. Tiptop was at the head of the table with Augusta at the other end, both women delicately sipping their cups of tea. Harry took the seat between Issy and David, the only seat for Neville to take was between Bartok and Remus.
David swept him up, face a little tight but smiling through it. Harry held his tail all the way to the dining room, head swiveling back and forth as he took everything in. Portraits waving and cooing at them as they passed, Harry smiled back at all of their friendly faces, saying good morning to all of them. David assured him that they would spend a day getting to know all of their ancestors one day soon.
Arthur laughed quietly at his boys who had their chins rested on his head. Arthur loved them so much that it felt like his heart was constantly ready to burst. They clung to him like koalas as Arthur finished cooking, finally letting go of him to carry the food for him over to the table. They sandwiched him between them, eating in comfortable silence.
He was conflicted, on the one hand, Harry was his baby boy, and he wanted to roar at the young man touching his son. But on the other hand, he was happy to see someone who so clearly loved his son and would do anything to protect him. Bartok knew that Harry finding his mates was inevitable, but that didn’t stop him from wanting to hide away his son and to keep him young forever. Anna said it was probably harder for them since they had only had Harry for a month.
“Okay, cub, if you have any questions while we are in the memory just ask us, we can pause it while we talk. Now, all we have to do is place a finger in the liquid. Entering the memory might be a bit disorienting, but you will be completely safe. Just remember it’s only a memory, and I and Sirius will be the only ones who can reply to you.” Remus wished he didn’t have to say the last bit but he suspected that if he didn’t the realization once in the memory would hurt Harry.
Three.
His beyond soft blanket was red. And there in his arms was his teddy bear, with black fur and green glass eyes. A snore snapped Harry from the admiration of his teddy, spread out over the couch was a tall man, skin tan and dark chocolate hair long and splaying all over the couch and floor.
Harry had foolishly wished that his Dad might have said something directly to him but this Will had been written when he was just a baby and his parents probably expected this Will to be read years ago, there was no reason for them to say something directly to him. So instead he took all those small bits of information about them and held them close to his heart, locking them in so he could never forget.
Harry frowned but guessed it was just lingering embarrassment about what had happened earlier, which Harry could understand since he still felt strange about the whole situation. But he was glad it was Neville who had come to him, it would have been far worse if it was anyone else. Neville had seen him in some of his weakest moments and Harry knew Neville would never use this against him.
After that, they ate their wonderful meal, conversation lighthearted, Tiptop scolding Harry into eating seconds. They sat back for a few minutes, letting their food settle before Lyle hopped up to retrieve the present he had got Harry for his birthday.
But unfortunately, Lyle noticed it as well, “Anna is taking excellent care of him, and his health has improved greatly.”
“Now, Harry, first why don’t we call Tiptop to retrieve a calming draught?” The House-Elf popped in the moment Remus said her name, hand outstretched with a small vial in her long fingers. Harry took it without complaint, downing it in a quick gulp. “Thank you Tiptop,” Remus said, the House-Elf ignoring the two adults as she popped away.
He steadied himself against the sink, hand slipping across the countertop, and breath still coming out as desperate pants. Lungs begging for air.
Fred leaped forwards, ready to strangle the boy. Charlie was quick to catch his younger brother even though he felt the same. Charlie had only met Harry once but the way his younger brothers talked about him made him feel like family. And both he and Bill had noticed that if Fred and George had anything to say about it, Harry would be their brother-in-law. So Charlie understood why what Ron had said set Fred off. Charlie felt ready to murder him himself, but his Occlumency helped him keep his temper at bay.
"You might want to try and contact Severus Snape; he recently quit his job at Hogwarts, and if I am correct he is the youngest person to ever receive their Potion's Mastery on Earth." Neville very carefully didn't look over at his Gran, she knew how the man had treated Neville and had often tried to get Dumbledore to do something about it, but the man never had. But now that they knew that Severus had never meant any of what he had done, Neville was unsure what his Grandmother would think about Severus working on his parent's cure. But the Longbottom Heir would suggest it anyway. The man was renowned for his Potion's ability, and Neville would do anything in his power to help his parents. So if that meant suggesting a man who had tormented him, against that man's will, he would do it again and again.
They entered the dining room four other people sitting around the table. Harry was overwhelmed, trying to take in all his parent’s features.
And then Harry tried to imagine kissing a girl. No one came to mind, Hermione and Ginny had betrayed him, he saw Luna as a little sister and those were the only girls he had even been close to. But then there was Katie, Angelina, and Alicia, he had gotten to know them quite well through the rigorous training sessions Oliver put him through. He had heard many boys saying how hot they were, and while Harry could see their beauty, he had never given them a second glance. But then there was Oliver, his exuberance for Quidditch lighting up his face, his hands on Harry’s shoulders after a training session when he realized Harry was in pain. Large warm hands encircling his neck. Water sluicing down his broad shoulders and muscular legs as Harry snuck glances at him as they showered in the locker room.
After they got through that, Remus restarted the memory, Dorea going over the importance of consent, safety, and enjoying what was happening. She repeated many times that anyone involved had the right to decide they wanted to stop at any time and that needed to be respected.
“Mornin’,” Neville said around a yawn, pale pink lips pulling tight over straight teeth.
After Dumbledore left, Remus told Sirius all that had been happening with his inner wolf. Sirius had always been a proponent for Remus to follow his instincts, and his wolf was all instincts. Remus only wished he would have followed that advice sooner.
“One word Sal, just one. Horcruxes.”
Harry relaxed back into the pile of bodies reveling in their warmth. It made sense that he and Neville had formed a bond of friendship like the one his Fathers shared. Before Harry could ask any more questions, a giant black dog came racing into the room, claws clicking against the wood floor as he did.
Bill cast a silencing spell on Molly and waited for Charlie to come back downstairs with Ron and Ginny. They were soon coming down, Charlie looking thunderous and Ron and Ginny complaining about being woken. Bill motioned them to sit and it wasn’t until they did that they seemed to notice that Molly was yelling silently next to them. When the two tried to stand Percy was the one to bind them to the chairs. The two started to scream but when Bill asked, “What do you know of the theft from the Potter vaults?” They both went silent for a second and then started to speak, both sounding disgusted by the topic.
Harry woke the next morning with Neville close to him, but the only part of their bodies that were touching was their hands. Harry took the time to watch how the rising morning sun softened his friends…
Harry chewed lightly on the inside of his cheek, going through the pros and cons. “You will be there, with me, right?”
In response, all his parents looked back at him in confusion. David took up the lead, “Yes Harry, that golden light that surrounded you and Mr. Longbottom was a bond forming.”
The only subject Godric didn't hold the man back in was Potions, the man would have hexed him and fled the house if he had tried. So Godric had gone to more than one bookstore and had basically bought out their Potion's sections.
If at anytime you notice a spelling/grammar mistake please let me know. The same goes for if you think I am missing a tag.
Issy soon joined them on the couch as more people started arriving; Remus and the Longbottoms taking the seats closest to Harry. The two boys stared at each other longingly between people entering. The first to arrive was Professor McGonagall, her silver-streaked brown hair in a tight bun, wearing tartan formal robes. For some reason, when she saw Harry she looked shocked, but not disgusted, all she did, however, was give them all a formal nod before taking the seat next to Augusta as the two began chatting in whispered tones.
After meeting Mr. Weasley, Harry wanted to become a Father like him one day.
She was well known for her many trips into Diagon Alley, which Albus used to spy on the populace. He also had her twist rumors to blow them out of proportion or minimize them depending on what the situation called for. With all his positions Albus couldn’t subtly guide the opinions of the Wizarding community like Molly could, he was too public a figure and people were always on their best behavior when he was around. Even those who hated him didn’t dare go against him strongly in the view of others. While Dumbledore reveled in his rightful position in the spotlight, he did miss the days of anonymity.
Neville was always surprised at just how nonchalant magicals were about injuries and ailments that could and should kill them. Magic was just too powerful in its ability to heal, leaving people overconfident in their ability to bounce back from anything. They ended up careless about their own health.
Sorry for this taking so long.

Just opening the buttons of his pants caused his thighs to quiver, his fingers barely touching the area with two layers of cloth between skin on skin contact. It didn't matter though, even the feather-light touch made him double over, a moan ripping its way through his throat.
She scoffed, arms crossed over her bosom, “He is no son of mine. All he would ever be good for is his money, and maybe his fur as a lining for a robe.” Molly’s face was almost completely unrecognizable with how cruel it looked.
“It is something we will have to bring up with Arthur the next time one of us sees him. However, since this declaration from Lady Magic will be made public within the week, probably the way of an emergency newsletter, Arthur will probably know soon. All contracts formed by Lady Magic are recorded in a special section of the Ministry, it is then delivered to the major newspapers. The Lady is the reason we have magic, any time she contacts us in any way, it is big news.” Remus said, mind far away.
(See the end of the chapter for
Issy kissed them both goodnight, telling them to behave themselves or else. Harry giggled at how much redder Neville had gotten at those words. He doubted they would break a vase during a pillow fight like Dudley and Piers had, or accidentally leave the fridge open all night. “I promise Mum, we’ll be careful,” Harry replied causing Neville to blush deeper, his ears now cherry red.
Harry jumped up, hugging Issy around the waist and holding on for dear life. “I would love to have your help, Mummy.”
David shook his head solemnly, and Lyle jumped up to go gather Harry’s presents. Harry was oblivious to the whole situation, too busy testing the myriad of cheeses on offer, Tiptop having gone to the trouble to put name places on each one. So far it seemed the soft cheese such a Brie and Boursin were his favorites.
Issy led him around the room, showing him the ridiculously large closet that was bigger than his last room and the bathroom which had a small swimming pool sized bathtub. But Harry was too overwhelmed to really think more on it all. Instead, he just let Issy guide him around the room, making a note to explore once he is alone.
And there in the cradle of his hips lay his penis, amidst a thatch of curly black hair.
Severus leaped forward, about to rip the man’s head from his shoulders, only to have another, much taller, Draken step between them, brown wings also raised high. Severus growled, chest rattling with how aggressive it was. “Move aside,” He hissed, he had seen how this man had taken a protective seat at Harry’s side and Severus respected this man for protecting what he couldn’t. But he also couldn’t allow this man to get in his way.
Days spent curled into Salazar’s side, naked and glowing with contentment while Sal lounged only in his black acromantula silk dressing gown, scribbling away in his journal about now potion and spell ideas. Godric would run his fingers through Salazar’s silky black hair and over the smooth column of his long pale neck that was covered with red and purple bruises.
Bartok spoke up, understanding why his son was so confused after they first went to the bank together, he contacted Lord Gaunt, an old acquaintance, through Lucius, of his to ask why he made Harry his heir.
Harry sat back down gingerly, his wet behind feeling strange as he moved. Harry was tense, every muscle clenched as he tried to force himself to follow Neville’s instructions and relax. He sat there for a good five minutes before his butt unclenched and only a few seconds before a spray of water started again.
The Minister’s smile only grew tighter, “I see. Well-” the man cleared his throat roughly, a tactic to give him a few more seconds to think over what he was going to say. “There are many things we will have to discuss then. Like his living arrangements, Wizengamot proxies, and schooling. Before the adoption, Headmaster Dumbledore was acting as Mr. Potter’s Magical Guardian, and we believe it would be for the best if he resumed this duty. He has also been handling the Potter seats admirably for years now, and we see no reason to change this. Lastly, I have been informed by the Headmaster that his Hogwarts’ letter has yet to be returned and if it isn’t returned soon, he could be held back a year because of school tuition.”
Soon Harry was being led out of the meeting room, Neville holding his hand in a vise-like grip and Madam Longbottom leading the way. His mind was whirling, analyzing all his interactions with the Potions Master.
Last night had been torturous, it was soon evident just how naive Harry was, and while it was charming it was also frustrating. Neville knew Harry didn’t mean to tease him but that short glance he had of knobbly knees, skinny thighs and soft pink cock, tight balls almost completely hidden by a thatch of wild black hair had driven him mad. He had been on edge through his whole explanation of how a bidet worked, the only thing keeping him soft was the knowledge that Harry needed him and willpower. But then Harry returned to the bedroom, soft black silk tented slightly at the crotch and Neville had been done. He only had so much control.
He hissed at the statue, stone mouth grinding open and tongue lolling out to allow Godric to walk up its length. The moment he passed through the door leading to the sitting room, there was a loud pop, the enchanted sleep spell being broken. The room was musty with stale air, but the furniture was still pristine and dust free. A roaring fire bursting into the fireplace as he passed by, Godric could picture the days they had all spent down here, gossiping and dreaming of a better future.
weren’t alone.
Godric just slouched into the comfortable embrace, mind drifting. He didn’t notice how Issy was observing him, scrutinizing every expression that passed his face.
Harry saw how focused Neville was on the garden so he asked his friend if he wanted to go out for a walk. Neville was quick to agree and they were soon outside, Neville touching flower petals and leaves gently. Harry walked beside him, one hand holding the other boy’s and just let the flow of words about plants surround him along with the fragrant smell of blooming flowers and fresh cut grass.
He keenly missed the feeling of her arms around his waist, ample bosom pressed against his abs and smiling face looking up at him with sparkling eyes. Helga wiped the tear threatening to roll down her rosy cheek away, rushing out of the painting with a quick, “I’ll be back,” thrown over her shoulder.
Too many people had already forced Harry to be and do things he didn’t want to and Sirius and Remus swore to themselves that they would never allow anything of the sort to happen again.
He still didn’t like the thought of his baby bonding, but he was grateful that so far all of Harry’s mates and potential mates met his standards. He would still have to test them just to make sure. Bartok tucked the journal away with care, “I promise to get this to him today.”
It had only been a few days since they had last seen the bird, but he looked absolutely ragged now, a majority of its feathers missing and those that remained were dull and greasy. Despite this, there was a fire in its eyes that hadn’t been there before. Bartok tried to call out to the Phoenix, but they didn’t seem to hear it, just laying its head against Harry’s forehead.
“Sal, can’t you feel her?” Salazar shook his head, obviously confused. Godric moved closer, placing a hand over one of Sal’s and the other on his back. “Close your eyes, take in a deep breath. And let your magic feel out. Soak through the crystals into the castle’s heart.”
He could feel as his body slowly regained its human form, the feeling of having skin shocking him. Everything sensitive. He wiggled his toes and fingers the strangeness of feeling textures against his finger pads intoxicating. The blanket his mate was clutching was unbelievably soft, and he wanted to weep for missing such things for so long.
He had a newfound respect for the Weasley patriarch for holding himself together as well as he was. Bartok wasn’t sure he would be able to handle it with as much grace.
So they were all surrounding the two subs, a big group hug. It lasted past the point that most considered acceptable but Harry didn’t care, he could spend the rest of his life here and be content. But as if by some unspoken agreement they all pulled back as one, Issy corralling him towards the set between her and Bartok.
Sirius sighed, looking over at Remus who was now even redder than before. “We were… Well, when people love each other very much… Well…” Sirius looked around wildly trying to figure out a way to explain this.
Sirius was distressed and yelled back, “I assure you, that isn’t true! Hell, if it was both Remus and I would have lost our cocks long ago!”
“You will be family one day, please call us by our first names. And even if you think nothing is wrong, I would still like to put you through I full health check. It has been over 2000 years since you last had a human form, and from your behavior, we concluded you were under some kind of binding. Both for your sake and Harry’s I would like to give you a check over.” Anna’s tone was that of a healer who would be willing stun you to get her way.
Harry smiled softly, so far the only one of his parents he knew snored was David, so that’s who Harry assumed was the man sprawled out on the couch. He padded over to the older man, taking this chance to study his features. Face covered in freckles with stubble now covering his lean face.
HEALTH UPDATE!
Godric flamed into the outer chamber, the once glistening onyx walls now dull and covered in algae. Salazar would gasp in horror if he saw it, so Godric preemptively called for the current Head House-Elf. Dumbledore always hated the Hogwarts Elves since they knew what he was and could not be controlled. All he had going for him in that regard was the original contract with the first House-Elves to settle in the castle had a clause about keeping the school’s secrets.
And while he allowed Harry to think he had calmed, his Gran knew him better and looked over at him with a sly nod, letting him know they would talk about it once they were alone. Neville was raised at the knee of a Black, and even when he was younger and less confident, he never forgot his Gran’s lessons. The summer after his first year when Neville told her of what happened to Harry, she had taken him into the library and started their courses on traditional Black skills. Blackmailing, threats, revenge, and untraceable killing methods. Information gathering, knife throwing, and the beginnings of dark magic.
that they are awaiting our arrival.” Anna tried for her usual calm but her sorrow still came through. Neville was just relieved she didn’t try to apologize for something she had nothing to do with.
It took them another four hours to clear out all of Dumbledore’s hideaways that Godric knew of. The incredible amount of wealth they found shocked them all, even Rowena and Salazar were wide-eyed. But they were soon weighed down with more riches than they could ever imagine. Priceless artifacts from all over the worlds. It was absolutely shocking.
Luckily, Godric knew just the women to call for this emergency and Salazar would be more than happy to make the potions, just as soon as Godric got a potions text with all the new and improved recipes.
I leave to Lucius Abraxas Malfoy and Narcissa Asteria Malfoy nee Black of Wiltshire, England, if they shall survive me, Vault 589. If they are unable to accept this bequest it is to be held in trust by Andromeda Druella Tonks nee Black of London, England, for Draco Lucius Malfoy.
Bartok had rushed them back into the bedroom, instructing them all to get dressed in their best clothes. They were quick on the uptake and were soon dressed and on their way to the Ministry, sticking close to Bartok, who promised to protect them while out. Bartok walked as if they were in no hurry, not giving the bigots what they wanted.
While the movie was action-packed and exciting, Harry was already nodding off. He really did want to see the outcome, but he was just too tired. A pop jolted him awake, Tiptop standing in front of the now empty coffee table.
His mate was curled into the soft pillows and blankets of his bed, and he couldn’t be more happy to see it. Harry looked better than he had ever seen him before. Long, dark eyelashes rest against tanned cheeks, plush mouth open and emitting tiny snores.
But now all Remus could hope for is that these people wouldn’t cut them out, that they would listen to what happened to Sirius and allow the man to be part of his Godson’s life. To not bar him from seeing his cub just because he was a werewolf.
He also offered his services, willing to send her and anyone she trusted purging potions, since he was sure the old fucker would have no qualms about dosing anyone to get his way. She agreed, telling him to send it to her with a compulsion spell on the letter to make sure she drank it. This trust was what finally allowed him to turn his back on her and start packing, swiftly but delicately gathering the plethora of potions equipment and supplies he had. Dumbledore, thinking Severus would never be able to escape had kept him supplied with an overabundance of rare and expensive ingredients. Many were illegal, and the only reason Severus bothered taking them was that he rather them be out of Dumbledore’s reach.
Bartok then looked at David and Lyle who were on Harry’s other side. They were spooned up tightly together, David pressed tightly to Lyle’s chest with the Tengu’s hands curled protectively over his heart and stomach.
Anna grabbed his hand from across the table, her skin smooth and warm. “Harry, we didn’t get you presents because we had to, but because we wanted to. You are our son, and we want to spoil you.”
Salazar looked over, mouth wide open in shock, “Godric, you know spirit cleansings only work on sentient beings.” He sounded as if he thought Godric was an absolute idiot, but Godric knew something the other man didn’t.
“That’s ingenious, Harry has told me about your dreams of owning a joke shop. With how inventive you are, I am sure you will go far in anything you choose to do.” Bartok’s smile was genuine and proud. With the way his son had talked about these two, and how honestly and proudly they confessed their love, Bartok was sure the three would be bonded and married in no time. And Bartok was glad for it, they obviously cared for and were protective of Harry at that was what mattered most to Bartok.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked.
“I’m sure if you tell me what potions he is on I would be more than able to handle his care. After all, I have raised seven children and seen my fair share of sickness.” Molly tried again, laughing hollowly at the joke she made.
Neville, however, couldn’t think straight,
But he reminded himself once again, Harry wasn’t ready for this.
Harry stumbled, suddenly in an unknown room, everything around him was slightly off. The edges of the room quivered as if at any moment the walls would crumble and the colors of everything desaturated. As Harry turned to look at more of the room he saw Sirius and Remus silently sitting on a settee at the end of a large bed, much smaller than his own, that had what would be garish red coverings if it weren’t for how washed out all the colors were.
As soon as they were out of Harry’s hearing range, Neville was looking over at his Grandmother for more information about what she had learned about the illegal marriage contract. It was Anna who spoke up, going over just how despicable it all was, obviously pleased that Augusta and Neville were so angry on behalf of her son.
Ron seemed to perk back up at the word Quidditch and was soon going on about how they had box seats and were planning on camping out for the night. Harry just continued to stare the old man in front of him down, ignoring the vacuous redhead as he bounced in place. “As you were just told by
After a few long breaths, Percival spoke once again, “What can I do to help?”
When Arthur first found out about his friend’s incestuous relationship he had been shocked, but they had trusted him enough to tell him, so he listened to what they had to say. Apparently, magical twins could hear each other's thoughts and because of this, they couldn’t hide anything from each other, even the sexual. But that they still wanted to marry someone, it would just be the same someone. It had taken Arthur a while to understand, but with time he was just happy that they were happy. And to be honest, he couldn’t imagine them ever being without the other.
“I am sorry to interrupt, but Mistress Anna and Issy have a visitor. He says it is an emergency.”
“Mr. Potter, it’s great to see you again,” Fudge finally greeted, completely ignoring the Claremores, and this more than anything pissed Harry off.
They all sat in silence, waiting for midnight to come, now opening watching the bed as time ticked down.
When Harry asked about lunch, Neville turned to him, finally seeming to notice that he was surrounded by other people and that there was food in front of him. Harry repeated his question, hopeful smile smeared with bacon grease at the edges. Neville’s face became impossibly soft, agreeing to the plan.
Both times Charlie had met the young Potter he watched the way the young teen behaved and moved, watched the way his twin brothers fell into his orbit. Charlie had felt the same pull, his protective urges flaring up, born from his love of family and want to protect all of his younger brothers.
“What were you going to do to Harry once you married him?” George asked, still stuck on the fact that there was a marriage contract that could destroy his brother and his future to be with the man they loved. Sure he knew his Father was distressed at the moment and wished he could go to him and comfort him. But he also knew they only had so long for the truth serum to last, and they needed to get all their questions answered now.
Another thing I want to say thank you for everyone who donated to help me with my medical bills. It has helped a lot! And this chapter is dedicated to you. Seriously the donations have helped me be less stressed, which beyond not being good for my heart, has just caused me to have a lot of panic attacks.
Bartok nodded, looking over to Helix, who withdrew a truth crystal.
Sirius took Harry’s head between his hands, searching his Godson’s face to try to puzzle out what was wrong. What had thrown him into this state? Sirius had to call Harry’s name multiple times before he finally noticed he was being talked to. “Pup, tell us what’s wrong,” Sirius begged, distressed at his inability solve this.
But the wildest thing they found was people.
Remus fell back on his old tactic of studying a person to see their intentions and motives. However, he saw nothing amiss, they all were genuinely concerned for Harry’s wellbeing and that more than anything was something Remus could get behind.
Four.
Bartok reached over, resting his much larger hand over Augusta’s trembling one. Her head whipped towards him, eyes wide when she saw the sorrow there. “No,” She croaked, she had lost so much, Neville was the last of her family left. Sure she had many distant Nieces and Nephews but until today the only one she was in contact with was Andromeda, everyone else had died during the wars. Her cousins Dorea Potter, Cedrella Weasley, and even Druella and Pollux who she had always hated, where gone. And it didn’t matter if she hated the last two. They were family, they were her’s and now they were all gone, the only ones left Druella’s daughters, one a blood traitor in Azkaban, another too ashamed of what her sister had done to ever visit Augusta and the third an outcast for marrying a Muggle-born. And Cedrella’s son Arthur, too busy with his seven children and horribly overbearing harpy of a wife. But now she had Sirius who she thought for so long to be a blood traitor and - How could she have ever believed that? - the Sirius she knew would have died before putting James at risk, let alone Harry.
Augusta’s was now absolutely furious,
Augusta said nothing, just reached over to grasp Neville's hand within her own.
Dumbledore sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose, so the last two days had been an absolute mess. Sure he knew he could get everything back under control, but that didn’t mean Albus didn’t wish he didn’t have to. “I know Dedalus, we should have had that vote in the bag, but somehow those filthy creatures wormed their way out of justice.”
After his wings retracted, skin still itching to let them through again, they continued.
Percival got unpacked, Bartok perched on the desk chair as they talked about how the case was progressing. They had strategically planned to release the information of the theft before anything else, so the public could have a chance to take the new information in, though they didn't want to wait so long that Dumbledore had a chance to regain his reputation.
Arthur knew the statement wasn’t quite true though. He would always care about all of his children but there were a few things he would not and could not, accept, even from his own children. But what the twins were to each other was one of the things he could abide.
Someone also asked me how I stay inspired, personally, I go and add a bunch of pins to
“Oh, Sal, you silver-tongued devil, you,” Helga said between giggles, flush high on her cheeks.
After the destruction incident, Sirius had pulled away from him. They had barely talked in the three months leading up to that terrible Halloween night. Sirius had avoided them all, and when he was around he was distant, emotions only showing when Harry reached out to him. Sirius had even moved out of the flat they had shared since they left Hogwarts, no warning and no note. Remus had just come home after work one day to see all of Sirius’ belongings missing.
“And what could that possibly be,” Remus growled, still feeling defensive over his helpless mate. He quickly glanced around the room, everyone’s wand at the ready but only Augusta looked like she was ready for a duel if it came down to it.
We also have a course of potions to help reduce any other effects of long term hospitalization. The biggest thing we noticed, other than the muscle degradation, was the change to their hair. At this point, we believe that is due to extended periods of stress. Which is both a good and bad thing. Them having the ability to be stressed means there is are more brain activities than St. Mungos indicated. On the flip side, there are very genuine downsides to long term stress, one of them is the weakening of the heart's muscles. As soon as we realized that we put them on a course of potions to help lower their heart rates to give the heart a chance to heal. Once it is a tad better, we will start using more aggressive potions to completely heal the heart."
I hope you like this chapter, if it's a little weird I am sorry, had writers block to power through.
He looked down at his pocket watch, a present from his grandfather for passing his lawyer certifications, noticing it was twenty minutes before his visit with the Weasleys. He had planned to get a quick shopping trip done between his meeting with Harry and them, but the trip to the vault had taken up the time.
It was true that The Elder Wand’s allegiance was to the Magical to win it in a duel to the death, but what legend didn’t say was that it had one greater allegiance. The Elder Wand was bound to the Peverell line in a way that could only be a product of soul magic and perhaps necromancy. But the wand’s secrets could only be known by the rightful Peverell Lord.
Godric was relieved as well as certain once the two had some time to get to know each other, they would get along easily. Godric just hoped he could find happiness with Harry, even if they were never romantic or sexual. But Godric thought Harry would easily charm the pants off of Salazar. Godric found he was less anxious about introducing Sal and Harry, in fact, he felt quite excited to see them interact with each other. Sal, the man he had known for what felt like forever, and Harry, the young sub he always felt drawn too would hopefully hit it off quickly.
There was a hitch in Harry’s breath and warmth flooded his face.
Someone also asked me how I stay inspired, personally, I go and add a bunch of pins to
Issy gasped in surprise, dainty hand going up to cover her mouth. “Bartok, this is your childhood home, you have always held it so dear.”
“Mr. Potter will remain in your custody for now while I take the time to thoroughly investigate this situation. However, come September, I expect to see him return to Hogwarts for his fourth year. Now, I am afraid I must go, I have another appointment to keep.” Fudged thanked them all for their time, thoughts far away with his ponderings as he and his escorts left through the floo, the file still in hand.
Vision whiting out and toes curling. All the muscles in his body going tense as a bowstring.
Only to find the tiny house on the outskirts of Hogsmeade completely empty.
On cue Harry’s tummy rumbled, causing the boy to blush but excitedly get up and make his way to the bathroom. It was large but still modest, the tub big enough for at least three people. Harry got ready for the day quickly, too excited to waste any time.
Then came the hatched Basilisk, and he didn’t even want to think about that now.
Unbeta'd. Heres the next chapter hope ya like it. Mostly just more relationship set up.
Harry took a deep glug of his water, letting the potion soothe his mind and magic.
This way they could also keep a close eye on Harry’s mates to make sure they treat him like the precious treasure he is. So far they knew Siles planned on courting their son. Normally this wouldn’t automatically mean bonding, but since Siles was gifted with future sight, they had no doubt he would end up being one of Harry’s mates. But at least they all knew him and trusted him to treat their son right. That didn’t mean they wouldn’t still keep a close eye on the young Tengu.
Neville was surprised by this since it was a common topic in their dorm, well not so much common as it was something Ron prattled on about often. Everyone else in the dorm just ignored him, though now that Neville thought about it Harry was never there at those times. Neville also knew that Dean and Seamus tried to be scarce whenever Ron started in, mainly because of his homophobic views. And considering the two were dating they would often find ways to excuse themselves, faces always stormy, but Ron never realized it. Neville was the best at ignoring what Ron said and refused to let himself be driven from his own room. He just wished he had paid more attention to what Harry was doing during those times.
Harry picked up the smaller package, opening the letter that was tied on top. He recognized the writing as soon as he opened it, glad to see that it was the twins, his heart soaring.
Godric knew what he had to do, as he pulled out his faithful yew wand, which had leaped into his outstretched hand when he was still five feet from it, both women looked over. His wand buzzed within his grasp, excited to be used again. “I, Godric Gryffindor, do swear to Lady Magic that I will do my best to protect Hadrian James Potter with all that I am.” The magic glowed golden around him, sparking across his skin like electric kisses. The two women relaxed, smiling at him, as they trusted the Lady to keep him to that. Having another person watching out for their son was undoubtedly reassuring to them.
If I was attacked at Godric’s Hollow our Secret Keeper was Peter Pettigrew. If he isn’t caught if I die this way I want this message to be delivered to Amelia Susan Bones, Head Auror:
It was the twins to speak up before anyone else could. “They aren’t our family,” they hissed out in unison.
Sirius choked out a bark-like laugh, “You’re sorry? No, Lils, I am the one who is sorry, I failed you… Harry he…” Sirius covered his mouth to try and stop his sobs,
“Sal is in the labs brewing-” Godric started only for Issy to interrupt.
Harry stared at his friend in disbelief, “So you mean it was supposed to do that?” Neville just nodded. “Oh…” Harry mumbled, looking over his shoulder at the apparently innocent toilet that in fact was not out to get him.
Molly looked as if she had seen something foul before she spoke up, hissing once again. “Albus has them locked up in one of his family manors, using them to fuel his magic. Good luck getting to them, they’re under blood wards and no one will believe you if you try to tell them.” Molly was laughing again, obviously thinking she was untouchable.
Anna leaned closer to Augusta who was on her left, “I have heard a bit about your son and daughter-in-law’s condition due to Bartok’s work in Britain. I am not sure if anything can be done for them but I think it would be best to move them. I know of a few very good clinics who deal with long term spell damage solely. And one that specifically deals with brain damage, I know the Head Healer personally and she is very dedicated.”
Arthur’s expression tightened, brows drawing closer together. “We have an issue. After you stormed out of the house an owl delivered these.” Arthur said as he lifted the newspaper to relieve three open envelopes. Molly paled at the sight of the Gringotts crest on the top of thick parchment, mouth gaping like a goldfish. “You wouldn’t happen to know anything about the thieving from Harry’s vault would you?”
Harry had always thought it was a strange looking body part, hanging limply between his legs resting on his small testicles. The skin was much pinker than anywhere else on his body, even more so than his lips. What Harry now knew to be the foreskin, around his main genitals, looked like an oversized turtle-neck sweater, hanging a centimeter from the main body of his penis.
“You, Mrs. Weasley, are not a licensed healer and therefore do not have the knowledge to deal with this sort of case. It’s more than just handing him the potions. We have to test him daily and adjust the doses to make sure they are working correctly. He is fragile, both from the abuse and his inheritance, and is still on bedrest.” Anna explained, trying to hammer it into the woman’s thick head. But she seemed just not to get it, opening her mouth to try another angle, luckily the Minister stood, obviously done listening to this bickering.
Other Statements:
Godric was surprised that with the state of the wards that the castle hadn’t fallen down around them. It must be Hogwarts herself diverting what little power she had left to hold the structure together. Salazar knelt down, laying his long-fingered hands against the amethyst patch in front of him. They could both feel the quiet but weak hum of anticipation, thrumming through their bones. Godric let himself sing back, reassurance in every note.
He looked over to Neville who was holding his hand, the other boy looking just as shocked. At least he would have someone to talk over this new information with. Snape had been just as terrible to Neville, and Harry was sure that finding at it was all fake shocked him too. Probably more than Harry since he didn’t know what Harry had learned about the Headmaster.
Now wasn’t the time to let the famous Weasley temper cloud his judgment.
“Oh, my love, I am so sorry… I… I wish I could have been there for you-”
Remus was shocked when he heard a word almost silently growling in the back of his mind, repeating over and over.
“Mr. Black-” Bartok started, but Sirius was quick to cut him off and insist they all call him by his first name. “Sirius, then, I would be willing to take on your case if that is what you want.” Bartok offered his services and Sirius was quick to agree, they spent the remainder of the afternoon planning out how they would gain Sirius’ freedom. They agree that the first step was to seek asylum in Terradore and then petition for citizenship.
The contract had stated that Dumbledore would have control of all of Harry’s vaults and Proxy seats. And that he would only be allowed to have one child and he would have to be absolutely faithful to Ginny, whereas she was free to do as she pleased. Out of everything that was what pissed Harry off the most. He dreamed of having a large family and whenever he imagined a spouse it had always been someone who was his friend first. A true friend would never betray someone in that way. Lastly, it stated that a slavery binding would be placed on Harry so that he would be required to obey Dumbledore’s, Molly’s and Ginny’s orders, in that order of importance.
Godric used the wand, his being locked in the chamber with Salazar, which even knowing it would soon be back in rightful hands still fought him. The most he could do was cast a spell used on children with nightmares to force them to sleep a full twelve hours. It was an ancient spell that went out of use because of its tendency to cause Sleeping Disease if overused.
Eight.
Thank you to the wonderful Will and Amycat8733!
“Goodnight,” Neville croaked out into the darkness.
“Really good, Mum! My ears don’t even hurt anymore, and I don’t need my glasses either!” Harry was excited about this development. Even with his glasses, his vision had always been blurry, so he had never really experienced just how detailed everything could be. Even the patterns in the wooden table were now overwhelming him.
If you wanna talk about the fic
Inside was the Longbottom crest in platinum, an Oak tree, and sword, with a bright amber droplet hanging from the bottom. If Neville wasn’t so terrified he would laugh at the sight of the oak. His Grandmother had drilled its meaning into him since he was a small boy. Oak; Duir the Celtic word for oak and the origins of the word Druid. Oak; durability, constancy, purity. Oak; a tendency to attract lightning.
But before he could curse the intruders he was falling to the floor, body stiff as a board and arms locked at his sides. Remus jerked out of his shock, jumping to stand over his mate, wand at the ready. Salazar jumped in front of Godric, hands raised placatingly, voice gentle as he tried to calm the situation. “I think we all need to take a deep breath and take a step back, we know this is probably very shocking to you, but I assure you Godric has a good reason for stunning Mr. Black.”
Albus Dumbledore was furious, the glass trinket that smashed against the walls of the ancestral Weasley manor not helping in calming his temper. Yesterday he had awoken to the stomach-dropping feeling of falling, but as this was a common phenomenon, it didn’t worry him. Right up to the moment when his body hit the dew-damp ground with a heavy thud. The side he landed on bruising almost immediately. That wasn’t the first time he had cursed the fragility of his aging body, but at that moment, he was more worried about what had happened. Albus could remember falling asleep in his bed within the Headmaster’s tower, but somehow he was now laying in the dirt in front of the Hogwarts wrought iron gates, the guardian gargoyles sneering down at him.
Bartok warned Harry last night that they would be getting up early to go to the bank so that they could retrieve Harry’s Lord and Heir rings. But when Bartok walked into his son’s room he was still fast asleep, Neville curled around him protectively.
His wand was in his hand faster than a man of his years should be able, tip pointed directly between Molly’s eyes, killing curse on the tip of his tongue before he finally realized what he was about to do. He might hate the women but Albus knew if he was to kill her it would bring too much attention onto him. She wasn’t just a homeless muggle who he could take his frustration out on. The woman was also a useful tool he would hate to lose.
“Well, Harry, all Oaths and Magical Contracts are given to Lady Magic to ensure. She is the one who judges you if you break promises of that nature. There are a couple of ways people make oaths, the first, and least damaging is swearing
“I should have thought of that,” Siles commented with a soft laugh.
Percival was quick to agree, and they spent the next few hours before Percival needed to leave for dinner laying out plans on what to do. And how to take down Albus Dumbledore.
Once he sent off the owl and cleaned up he joined all his family, needing the comfort from this excessively stressful day.
“I would like you to check my Grandson when you have the time Mrs. Claremore.” Both women nodded in agreement as they bent down, Remus following them, focus trained on his mate.
I am on everyday.
“You got me there,” Lyle chuckled at the mischief brimming in his son’s eyes before turning to his younger brother. “And what can I do for you?” He asked, sitting beside Harry and motioning for Siles to take the chair across from them.
“I had Issy call Healer Lilian Lorraine while we came here to ask her for permission to portkey two patients into their lobby. She just replied to me via
“The Peverell family was known for their use of necromancy, soul magic, and their inventions. Now before you ask not all necromancy and soul magics are Black, and the fact that the Peverell line did not go insane long ago proves that most if not all members used their powers wisely.”
Neville was standing there, looking worried before he slowly looked down, blush rising on his face when he saw that Harry was naked from the waist down. He snapped his head up, eyes locked onto the ceiling with its crown molding, an apology forcing its way through shocked lips.
Molly’s face was now predatory, seeing the weak spot and attack. “No, you married my horrid Brothers, and your sister birthed your awful spawn, especially those twins of yours, I am just lucky Albus bound their creature sides. But Albus said I had to be with you so no one would question who Ron and Ginny’s Father was so we used an ancient spell that changes people's perception to believe it was me they saw instead of those freaks.”
Other than Helix, the room was empty. The Goblin was sitting at a desk, chairs spread out around the room in front of him. He greeted them without looking up from the paperwork he was busy shuffling through.
Scratching at the base of his tail felt very nice, a loud purr rumbling from his body, and Harry ended up scratching at the spot for so long that Neville worried about him, calling out to make sure nothing bad had happened. Harry blushed, lifting his tail to look at his bottom, round and fatty, before he took one last glance at his penis and dressed.
Salazar just smiled again, and wistfully stated that Godric's heart was too big for his own good. And of course, with hundreds of years together they would both eventually fall in love with the other clan members. But that they would always love each other was enough Salazar.
They were all now fully dressed and soon headed down to the morning room to eat breakfast. The room stuck out from the main house, three of its four walls covered with ornate glass panels along with the roof, letting in the soft morning sun and looking out onto the magnificent gardens. One of the windows was open, letting in the sweet scent of the Juliet roses and morning dew.
It took him a few moments to calm down enough to pull his wings back in, a mantra of:
Harry was still skeptical, it was something Petunia said to him when he was much younger, and he could remember having many nightmares about it. And while he now knew the Dursleys had lied to him about many things, and he shouldn’t trust anything they told him, he couldn’t get rid of that long-held fear.
The pleasure engulfed him.
“Sal as is Salazar Slytherin?” She almost squeaked, but she was still focused on the women in front of her.
It was then Lyle made a query that caught Harry’s attention, waggling his eyebrows as he did. “So have you found who you were looking for yet?”
“I, Godric Gryffindor, command you to remain silent. Your vow to school states your loyalty to Hogwarts and the founders to have your portrait hanging here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Standing in their floo parlor was Godric Gryffindor, still wearing Bartok’s clothes but looking far warier then he did when they last saw him. On cue, Anna started casting diagnostic spells on the man, other than being magically exhausted; nothing came up as unusual.
As Tiptop took away the leftovers, she placed a package on the table in front of Harry. Unlike all the other presents it didn’t have fancy paper, just a dull brown. “Happy birthday young Master Harry,” She squeaked and popped away.
I leave to Andromeda Druella Tonks nee Black and Theodore Edward Tonks of London, England, if they survive me, Vault 588. If they are unable to accept this bequest it is to be held in trust by Sirius Orion Black of London, England, for Nymphadora Evangeline Tonks of London, England. For the many nights when you babysat Harry when Lily and I needed a break. Some days I think you both were the only reason we didn’t go insane at the beginning.
All the Claremores looked around at each other in silence, stiff with tension. Tiptop popped in with another tea service and forced cups into everyone’s hands.
Harry studied it with wide eyes, a flash of confusion soon smothered by what looked like love to Neville. Harry nodded, looking back up to Neville with round green eyes, shiny with tears, lower lashes weighed down by them.
The clawing terror when Hagrid took the key from him. The urge he felt to reach within Hagrid’s pocket to secret it away, swallow it and hold it within his body where he knew it would be safe. The only thing that stopped him was the thought of being found out, of being kicked back out to the Muggle world.
(See the end of the chapter for
The wards were already set so that the moment the man woke Dumbledore would be booted from the grounds. Violently.
Harry couldn’t help jumping in surprise at the feeling, but now that he knew what it was and was expecting it he tried to not think about what was happening to his lower half. He started naming rose species in his head to help him calm when a sudden violent shiver wracked his body. The sensations of the water hitting his bottom mystified him with how good it felt. It was strange and unlike anything he had ever felt before and suddenly it was over, only to be replaced with warm air blowing at him that felt like was tickling him. But instead of laughing a strange noise came from him. It was soft and Harry almost didn’t believe it came from him but there was no one else and he doubted it was the toilet. When the toilet was done doing whatever it did, Harry sheepishly stood and raised his silk bottom, noticing the way the front bulged slightly.
He was directed to a conference room he had rented out for the meeting. Helix was already waiting there. They spent the time waiting for their guests by talking about investments they were thinking about making.
The ride back was fast, and Harry seemed to relax as the wind blew through his hair.
Remus found out his wolf had always been right in its defense of Sirius and its distrust of Peter. His wolf had always been upset when Peter was around, and it only grew as they aged. Now that his wolf had proved it knew things Remus didn’t, he took to listening to its instincts.
Minerva had never seemed the type to participate in such heinous acts, but after so many years of being used and abused, Severus didn’t know who to trust. Luckily, the woman seemed to expect his suspicion, her wand on the floor between them. Severus eyed her warily as he bent, wand pointed between her eyes, and picked up her wand, pocketing it.
Severus went to the only place he knew he might be safe, surprised the wards around the manor gave him entry, dropping him off right in front of the main doors. Before he could knock a tall man opened the door. A man Severus had only seen in passing for the last eighteen years. A man he had once considered his best friend.
And now, with Harry’s soft hand on his face, he felt that same need again. He had only barely been able to force it down when Harry had rolled over, mouth right above his cock and warm breath from his groan almost too much to handle. The noise by itself was pornographic enough to turn him on.
Bartok leaned forward as well, searching his good friends face. “I wasn’t sure how you would react, you know the man who is responsible for my son’s situation. I know you would never stand for it, but he had to come first. Also, I just haven’t had the time and have been gathering the information needed for a court case.”
Tiptop explained the situation to her fellow House-Elves, and they were all furious to know someone was trying to take away one of their younglings. They were quick to start packing everything on the ground floor and basement moved by the end of the first day. Tiptop had to run off the other Elves when she found them trying to feed her little master. Shooing them back to packing, allowing her the time to dote on her little master.
That was until the door to the office opened at least. They all looked over to see who was coming in, everyone holding their breath. But when Harry saw who it was, he was up in a flash.
Next to arrive was the Malfoys, something that shocked Harry, because he couldn’t believe his parents would have left them something in their Will. Bartok had promised that the only people allowed into the reading were mentioned in the Will, but his Papa hadn’t mentioned the Malfoys would be here. Harry was distracted from those thoughts by the small wave Lucius Malfoy gave Bartok. He looked at his Papa in confusion as he waved back. He was wary now, he knew his Papa wouldn’t do anything to hurt him so he would have to tell Bartok about all the things Lucius had done to make sure his Papa didn’t get hurt by him.
Severus' skin had been crawling all day, and he couldn't figure out why. Every brush of fabric against his skin set him on edge, raising his hackles.
While he was nervous, Severus knew he wouldn't be able to ignore his body forever, the feelings of sexual frustration would only come back stronger. And this was his body, it was his, and he knew there was no reason to be anxious.
Confusion. Shock. Fury.
At this Anna relax, telling all her mates of the oath the man made earlier that day. The wand’s odd behavior could also be due to the mystery of its creation. Anna had to administer a calming draught to Issy to get her steady enough to listen. She blushed from her head to her toes in embarrassment once she remembered the oath. With it, there was no way Godric could have handed them the box knowing it was for Harry without being killed right then.
A young Sirius replied, voice much higher than it was now, cracking towards the middle of the sentence. Harry looked over at his Godfather who was blushing. The door to the room opened, a woman with familiar grey eyes and elegant features strolling into the room.
Harry let his hands wander on his once scar-covered skin that was now smooth, goosebumps rising in the wake of his hands. His nipples pebbling when he ran a blunt fingernail around the edge, a strange grunt escaping him at the unfamiliar feeling. Harry quickly removed his hands from his chest, letting them hang loosely at his sides while he studied himself.
Warning, the last section of this chapter has a sex scene. I haven't written one in a long time so I hope it is good. Please let me know what you think!
Inside was a golden ring that had the Potter crest, family gemstone in the middle. Harry had spent hours looking over his charms and now knew all the crests by heart. Harry tentatively reached out, the metal vibrating under his touch and he lifted the cold ring, spinning it between his grasp before lowering it onto his right ring finger. As it descended his finger, the ring tightened until it was snug, hugging his skin and magic like a warm hug enveloping Harry.
Neville’s hands moved faster, head of his cock an angry purple and drool dripping from between his fingers. And with one last erratic thrust of his hips he was cumming, Harry’s name a muffled scream as all the muscles in his body tensed, knees locking up and toes curling against the cold floor.
“It’s not theft since I am to be Lady Potter one day, we have every right to that money.” Ginny sneered, face almost a mirror of her Mother’s.
Across from them were Anna and Lyle.
He would have smirked if it was any other time, but now he needed to talk to them and leave.
The door opened again, Professor Snape strolling in, pitch black robes billowing in his wake, reminding him of Percival entering their home earlier. Harry looked up where the man was still stationed behind him, watching everyone like a hawk.
There had been many clues as to Harry’s home life, and Neville and tried his best to get Harry out of the situation he had been in. When he told his Gran and Aunt Amelia his suspicions, they had both been shocked, however, when Neville asked a few days later if Harry would be removed, Amelia just looked away from him. Not daring to meet his eyes as she left, leaving Augusta to let Neville know that while Amelia had tried her best to check on Neville’s claims, someone had blocked her at every turn.
Dumbledore was as white as a sheet, hands trembling and insides flipping.
Remus' mouth was agape, but he swallowed and focused back on the man in front of him. “And what does that have to do with you attacking my mate?” The growl had faded until it was barely audible.
Harry turned to look over at Sirius were he was still perched on the settee, wicked smile on his face at the memory. “He acted like he hated it but we all knew he was too pleased with his form to be truly upset.”
Harry schooled his face into blankness, not wanting to give them any ammo to use against his parents. “Minister, it’s very kind of you to check up on how I am doing with my new family.” Harry fought not to fidget under the man’s gaze. He might not look intimidating, but there was something about the way he studied Harry that made his skin crawl.
“Rest, Harry, we are all here,” Bartok whispered from his spot a few bodies over. Harry relaxed back into the warmth his parents provided and was soon sound asleep once again.
As Harry turned, a strange poster caught his sight, it was much smaller than the others, but the reason it caught his attention was that it was the only one not moving. When Harry realized what it was be began laughing, full belly laughs that shook his frame. On the wall of his Father’s bedroom wall was a poster for the Disney movie Bambi.
“He is fine, cub-” Remus was cut off by a silvery wolf Patronus bursting through the wall. It rubbed up against Remus before speaking.
And he wouldn’t have it any other way.
But more than anything Harry wished to walk these gardens with his friend. To listen to Neville’s enthusiastic ranting about each new plant they came across. Harry loved watching the innocent joy on his friend’s face when he was working with plants, and more than once Harry had been so distracted by it in Herbology class that Professor Sprout had reprimanded him. Harry flushed at the thought of Neville’s face covered in dirt after he came back from working in the greenhouses after dinner.
“The best way to start is probably with a spirit cleansing,” Godric suggested, kneeling down as well.
Thank you to the wonderful Will and Amycat8733!
When Harry finally spoke again, it was barely above a whisper, “I… I don’t know…” Harry looked up at them, looking like a lost little boy, looking for anyone to find him. Remus scooted closer, wrapping Harry up between them.
Anna nodded, “I would also like to know as a healer.”
“Happy Birthday, Harry” David whispered, voice still sleep rough, but the undertone of happiness was louder than anything and Harry couldn’t help the tears.
When he received the notice of Potter’s Will readings Albus, knowing what was inside, demanded that both Minerva and Severus not attend. But they had disobeyed him. He had almost cast the killing curse at both of them for going against him in this way. And for Severus to break through his binds and go about yelling secrets in front of so many people, well if he wasn’t bound to his chair and his wand taken he would have been torturing the man to death. But then the Goblins had thrown him out on his ass, wand clattering to the ground and slammed the giant wooden doors behind him.
It was an underhanded tactic, especially considering noon was the dead of night for most vampires. Bartok had to rush to get all of his paperwork together, thankfully he was organized, so that took almost no time at all, before he flooed over to his clients, banging on their bedroom door.  They came rushing out, all still in their night clothes and still half asleep wondering why someone was in their house.
“Really?” Harry questioned again, this time voice stronger.
Both men jumped apart as if the bedsheets and duvet weren’t on the floor, and Harry’s hair didn’t look like he had just been in a wind tunnel, all his curls separated.
I leave to Remus John Lupin of London, England, if he shall survive me, Vault 585 and the cabin at Howling Shores. In the case he is unable to accept this bequest, it is to be given to Sirius Orion Black of London, England. Remus, my best friend, please take care of yourself, Harry will need you. I want you to have the contents of this vault and house to make sure if anything happens you will be taken care of. Please use it, it’s one of my biggest fears that you will struggle unduly. Take this and use it, you know I have more than enough to make sure Lily and Harry are well off, so don’t worry about them. Also, please, make sure to balance out Sirius if the two of you have to raise him. And even if not, please make sure Sirius doesn’t go overboard, you know how Lily threatens to castrate him and I can’t imagine you would be okay with that.
His wolf whined, rattling his bones with its longing. Sirius however, would be a different matter. He had confessed to Remus that one of the only things keeping him sane in Azkaban was the thought of one day being set free and raising Harry. Of family game nights and teaching Harry to ride a motorcycle. Just being there for when Harry needed them, whether it be homework or girl/boy problems. Sirius just wanted to be there.
While shocked, Percival was relieved. “I have only seen that man a handful of times and talked to him even less. We have no relationship, and I never cared for him or his beliefs.” Bartok looked relieved as well to hear this. He had obviously been worried about what Percival would do.
Magic couldn’t heal everything. And people shouldn’t be so careless with their life.
This was an argument they had been having for years. Anna didn’t like the risk Bartok took by working in Britain and his regular visits to the Ministry. Her objections were only born out of worry, her nightmares were filled by the Ministry capturing Bartok out of the blue. She had tried for so long to convince her mate to at least think of moving to Terradore where they would have more protection if he continued working on cases in Britain. But so far none of her pleas had worked. Anna knew it wasn’t because he didn’t value her opinion but because he cared too much for others and would never abandon those in need.
This vial had been a family heirloom from his Mother, given to her as part of her dowry when she married Septimus Weasley. All Black women were given two vials at marriage to ensure if anything happened they had a way to find out.
They stood there for a few more moments before Neville spoke up once more, “I, uh, will leave it to you?” His voice rising at the end, but he clearly wasn’t asking for an answer. He began to shuffle out, eyes staying locked onto the ceiling as he bumped into the door frame on his way out before shutting the door softly. Harry turned around after a few seconds to make sure Neville wouldn’t come back in. The toilet hadn’t moved from its place and the warm seat was calling to him.
That too was soon only broken pieces of glass.
I am sorry this took so long, first I needed to wait for the poll and then I just ended up second guessing myself a lot.
The entrance room was just as pretty as the rest of the clinic Neville had seen, a nurse waiting on their arrival to direct them to the head healer's office. It was welcoming with many pictures of family covering the walls. Artwork children had drawn her in a place of pride right behind her, along with her mastery certificates.
Harry startled when the floo flared, and a tall man stepped out, flicking his fingers out in a careless show of wandless magic to clean the ash from his silk shirt and black slacks. Harry couldn’t help the blush that covered his cheeks when the man looked at him, one red and one blue eye piercing into him like a brand.
Albus finally got Molly off of him and sent her on her way. Lucky for both of them, squibs could still floo.
“What are your intentions towards my son?” Godric had never heard the normally bubbly woman seem so cold. He looked at Issy, her blue eyes glacial, as she seemed to stare at his soul.
Sleep came to him easily, and when he woke the next morning, much earlier than expected and Harry still fast asleep he guiltily went to take a shower, more to take care of his morning wood than any need to wash.
Harry looked panicked, his eyes bugging out and his face paling. “But that’s unnatural?”
Dumbledore’s voice was weak, obviously pulling out the last argument he had, the whole reason the Weasleys were even here. “I may have failed-” All the Claremores scoffed, even the Minister joined in, making Dumbledore flush in anger. “However, you are taking Mr. Potter away from a loving family who would gladly welcome him into their home. He barely knows you all, wouldn’t it be best for him to be with people who already care for him?”
Tears started to stream down his face and Harry couldn’t help but join him, sitting up to wrap himself around his Godfather, both sharing in their silent reunion. Harry had been so worried he would never see Sirius again, but here he was, alive and looking worlds healthier than he had before they parted. His once greasy, matted hair was now light and wavy, curling around his sharp features. And his eyes, while still haunted, no longer looked hunted. Their warm gray depths reminding Harry of Draco, whose Mother, Harry remembered, was one of Sirius’ cousins.
“Yes, Sirius, bring down the full force of Black retribution upon the enemies of our house,” James snarled, filled with the rage that had built for years, finally having a way to enact his revenge. They had spent years talking about just what they would do to Dumbledore when he finally passed. What tortures he would be put through at their hands.
“When the wand entered the room, the box it was in began bucking in Anna’s hold, and all of your attention was on it. At your touch hundreds of animals, not quite Patroni but something similar, burst from the wand and began stampeding around the room. Then they all rushed you and absorbed back into the wand. After that in absorbed into your skin and left what appears to be a tattoo, so you can see why we were frightened. No record of the wand has ever even hinted at such a thing, and that is why I believe you now have its full loyalty.” David took a large bite of his bloody filet mignon. “And that is what we know about the Elder Wand, admittedly it isn’t something I have studied in depth as I never thought it would be relevant to me. So I will now be doing more to make sure you have all the facts.”
If this was any other time, Sirius would have laughed at how wrong Harry had misread the situation. But his Godson was so obviously distressed that Sirius could do nothing but pull Harry back into him, the boy’s face hiding back against his neck, his skin and collar soon wet with tears.
The Minister coughed to clear his throat before he spoke again, “Yes, your sudden removal from your family was quite unexpected. All the documents surrounding the circumstances are sealed, so naturally, I am concerned for your wellbeing. I was also shocked to hear that you had come into a creature inheritance.” Fudge fought to hide the slight downward tilt of his mouth at the word creature, but he was unsuccessful. “The only creature blood that the Potter’s carried hasn’t been seen for centuries.” The Minister fidgeted, looking over at Dumbledore for advice.
Everyone relaxed except for Percival who stayed on guard until the flames shifted back to orange and subsided. Issy was the first to voice her dislike for Dumbledore, but everyone was quick to agree with her.
Godric shook his head, driving away the images while pulling open the ebony door.
They were soon in front of a wooden set of double doors with brass handles.
Bartok looked down at his son, taking in the slightly unfocused eyes and mouth that was hanging open. He knew this was probably overwhelming, so he did what he could, leaning down to be at eye level with Harry. “Harry, son, do you need me to go and retrieve the painting?”
“Father! Papa! You came!” The ghostly image of a young girl bounded towards them, hair long and wild and cheeks full and rosy. Unlike a ghost she was colorful, body blurred around the edges, but when she wrapped her small arm around one of each of their arms, they could feel her. Her skin slightly cold, muscles hard but magic welcoming.
Suddenly the huge wolf that was sharing his bed was replaced by his Dad. David looking a cool as a cucumber, no sign of shame. Harry was going to scold his Dad, but he was being tackled by the flying form of his Daddy. Lyle using his wind powers to land softly on his son as he started rolling around, pulling David into it until they were all breathless with laughter.
They spent hours crying, laughing, and mourning their losses. Sirius telling them about how wonderful Harry was, how much Sirius loved him and wished he could have been there to see him grow up. Promises that he would never leave Harry alone again, that he would be there when James and Lily couldn’t.
“Yeah that works,” Harry nodded, popping the last orange slice on his plate in his mouth.
Harry enjoyed his breakfast burrito so much that he ordered seconds, gushing over the chorizo and tomatillo sauce. Bartok was happy to see his son’s growing appetite as he enjoyed a cheese danish. He planned to buy Tiptop some cookbooks on food around the world as a present since Harry loved trying new things. He suggested that after Harry returned home that maybe he and Neville could explore the house, something his son was quick to agree with. With all that had happened, Harry hadn’t had the chance just to explore his new home in full.
“My turn!” Issy jumped up, too excited to let her boy’s moment last longer. She grabbed the large box that contained her presents, dropping it down in front of Harry and shifting from foot to foot anxiously.
Remus cut him off, “I volunteer- I mean if you need someone…” Remus trailed off, blushing but eyes feverish with the need to do something to help.
Dorea began her lesson, beginning with the fact that puberty was inevitable, and that the changes happening to their bodies was natural. She went over the fact that they would have to shower more often and handed out a pamphlet on personal grooming. Dorea made them swear that before they tried any of the spells on themselves they would go to her or Charlus to make sure they had gotten the spells down. Remus whispered to Harry that they would provide him with a similar list of spells and that Neville would have them mastered by now if Harry didn’t want to come to them with it.
“Helga, Row, please answer me, I am here now…” Godric pleaded, hoping their souls would hear and return to their side of the painting.
Like Anna said, it was a hard thing to think about, and his knee-jerk reaction was to disagree, but he took the time to think it over. While he still found the thought distasteful, he also understood why some people would choose to go down such a route.
Harry just enjoyed their company and the obvious fun they were having together. He listened to Remus and David talk about their respective research projects, focusing heavily on the efforts to find a cure for the infected werewolves. David told Harry about his work when Harry had still been blind, the day after he and Issy told him about infected werewolves. At the time Harry still wasn’t sure if he could fully trust the Claremores so he hadn’t mentioned Remus. He had, however, asked many questions in hopes that if he saw Remus again he could tell the man about the research.
Harry’s teeth clicked together harshly as he tried to hold his tongue, but the anger that flooded him was too much to hold back, and he was soon yelling. “You weren’t aware?!” Everyone turned to look at him, eyes wide, but most of all, the fury that started to show on Dumbledore’s face fueled his own. “I begged you not to send me back! I told you that they hurt me, that I wasn’t safe there! But year after year, when I asked for help, you kept saying I was over-exaggerating. That living there was for the best! You sent me back!”
“I wasn’t aware of any abuse,” Dumbledore replied calmly, but the tightness of his fists, fingernails digging into his palms gave away how furious he was. “I placed him with his relatives so that he could know the love of a family. Had I known things were this bad, I would have placed him in the Weasley's’ care. But now that this has come to light I am sure they would be more than willing to welcome Harry into their home. After all, Molly and Arthur already view him as one of their own, and Ronald is his best friend.”
But he had years worth of control and the only sign of his anger was the slight flare of his nostrils. Bartok, from years of being friends, recognized the danger and stilled.
Arthur’s vision was red with rage. He didn’t understand. He couldn’t understand. But he knew the Goblins would never lie about such a thing.
Tears welled in Issy’s eyes, “There was no way we couldn’t fall in love with you.” She pressed her plush lips to his forehead, holding it there as if she didn’t, he would disappear.
“Well, Harry, do you want to see your new room?” Issy asked, hopping up and down in her seat in excitement. Harry was quick to agree, curious as to what else the house held, Issy and Anna lead him back through the house as his fathers got things ready for their trip to the bank. Anna pointed out rooms as Issy tried to rush them through the house to get to his rooms.
Ha ha Aganaw you silly dragon-snake.
“Don’t worry, I am sure Neville won’t push you to do anything you aren’t ready for, and if he does you come to us and we will handle it. And if you never want to be intimate in that way with Neville, you don’t have to.” Remus assured Harry, wanting to make sure his Godson knew that no one had the right to force him to do anything sexual if he didn’t want to.
Sirius had often visited Longbottom Hall with young Harry, and he had been absolutely besotted and devoted. He loved like only a Black could, absolutely, madly, and in a way that was never-ending. Augusta felt so stupid for allowing her grief to cloud her judgment. Sirius had suffered. There was no one there to help her nephew in his time of need. She now knew that Dumbledore had been responsible, but she was sure that if only she had realized Sirius had been framed earlier she could have stopped him from going to jail. Poor Harry wouldn’t have been sent to grow up with those monsters. And Harry would have been hers.
Severus wasn’t as brave as her, he would never be and all he could offer her was the advice to make a pact with Pomona and Filius since they were the two other members of staff Severus was sure would be just as outraged by Dumbledore’s actions and both brave enough to take a stand. Severus had never spent any time with his colleagues, the bindings Dumbledore placed him under not allowing him to get close to anyone, so he didn’t know who else was trustworthy.
The only reason he even recognized the other boy was those warm brown eyes and his ears that still suck out, though he seemed to have grown into them. Harry couldn’t help himself as he ran towards his friend, jumping up into his arms and wrapping around him like a koala.
“Siri, stop!” Harry giggled, trying to push the big, furry mass off of him. Finally, Sirius pulled back, transforming as he did, his large hands cradling Harry’s head tenderly as he stared down at the young boy.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, Harry, there are still many things we cannot heal, and most who are suffering prefer the quick death of the curse instead of living through their illness or the stress of another method of euthanasia. It is not something people like to think about, but in situations where that is an option, it is more compassionate to allow people to go on their own terms.” Anna continued.
Severus looked down at his trousers in surprise, his erection pressed tight up against the inseam. It had been years since Severus had last seen the organ filled with blood, the sight of it was surprising.
It was Harry’s scrunched up nose and jaw popping yawn that let Bartok know it was finally time for the day to start. They had a lot to get done before the Will reading at two and before then they had to give Harry a quick tour of their new home.
David was the one to speak up, automatically shifting to teacher mode. And Harry could imagine him and Remus getting along very well, Harry had seen how lonely Remus was and even though he had Sirius back he still wished the man had more people in his life. He felt the same about Sirius, he couldn’t imagine the isolation the man had been subjected to. Fourteen years in Azkaban and then a year on the run with only his guilt for company. Harry wished he could convince Sirius that what happened to his parents wasn’t the man’s fault. But Harry knew guilt all too well and knew that only time and care could absolve him of those feelings, and even then the guilt would still be a scar on his Godfather’s heart.
After Harry sat in silence for what seemed to be another hour, he finally stood and said he was ready to leave. They linked hands and Sirius guided them through pulling away from the memory.
Percival once again bowed towards Harry and the boy couldn’t help but wonder why he received this treatment when all his parents got handshakes or even a hug in Bartok’s case. But his curiosity was only mild so he didn’t bother thinking on it longer. Instead, he just enjoyed the contentment that rolled off his parents in waves.
But to Godric's surprise, when he finally got to the bit about how mates and bonds had changed, Salazar had just smiled a little sadly. Before saying that he understood and agreed with the change. Since it was now what was best for all of them, even if he was a little sad at having to share Godric with more people.
When he finished he could feel a motherly presence looking over him, through him, to his very core. And then the search was over and with a tightening of foreign magic around him, like a hug, it was gone, a glowing roll of parchment in its place, sealed with wax that slowly shifted between every color imaginable, pulsating as it changed. An infinity symbol that shifted its colors from white to black but was mostly a shade of gray in the middle. One side holding a sun in gold and the other a moon in silver.
“I want to say you don’t have to go if you don’t want to, I can stand in your place.” Before Harry to say that of course, he wanted to go, Bartok continued. “The only reason I mention this is because Dumbledore was mentioned in the Will, so he will be in attendance.”
So far, Albus had just sat silently, assessing the whole situation, scanning them all for any details he could gleam. But as soon as he noticed Harry looking at him, his eyes started twinkling, Grandfatherly demeanor back in place like a well-worn mask. “Yes, my boy, we had no word from you, you really worried us. And when I got no response from your Hogwarts letter, I couldn’t help but assume the worst.”
Harry went stiff, confused at what his Mummy said. He looked up at her, unaware of his mouth hanging open. “Bond?” His voice squeaked out.
The trail of hair down to his pelvic bone was thick, and his cock so hard that it was sticking almost straight up from his body the only deviation was the slight curve to the left, foreskin completely retracted and precum making the skin slick.
“I will go out and buy you some books about puberty, sexuality, and sex in general if you like?” Sirius wanted to be useful, wanted to help his pup with anything he could. But he wasn’t as eloquent was Remus and didn’t want to risk giving Harry false information, so books were all he could offer.
The remaining box was much larger than the last about two foot tall and a foot wide. What worried Harry most was that there were air holes, the only thing that kept him from freaking out entirely was there was no noise coming from it.
David just allowed him to cry, not commenting beside the occasional comforting hum. Hands over his back and arms, cupping the nape of his neck and running his fingers through his hair every once and awhile.
Godric sat down onto the bed, hands running over the familiar fabric. He ran a finger over a supple cheek, skin still as smooth as ever.
"We have done all the preliminary exams to start on a robust course of action. At this point, we are not sure we can ever completely restore their health, but we are confident we can make their standard of living better. We will be looking for a potions master to help us work on finding a cure, but I will not lie to you and promise more than we can give." Healer Lorraine stated. Anna had pulled out a notebook and started taking notes since she knew the two Longbottoms might be too emotional to take everything in.
Sirius had been devastated when they got the invitations to the Will reading, but he knew it wasn’t safe for him to go. But since Remus had run out and spent the last bit of his salary on potions to help Sirius recover, the man didn’t even fight. All he did was make Remus promise to do everything he could to make sure their pup was okay and to watch his back around Dumbledore.
“Ah, that is the problem, if Salazar sees his chambers in such a state, he will throw a tantrum. If you have Elves to spare to give them a quick clean, I will be extremely grateful.”
After Bartok floo called Percival to ask him to play bodyguard once more, they all spent the rest of the night beginning the process of moving.
They continued hand in hand wandering the grounds, passing through the rose garden and into the apple orchard, the herb garden was next, followed by returning to the rose garden where they finally sat down for lunch.
But that was a discussion for another day. For now, they had already wasted enough time. They had much to get done before Godric’s spell wore off. So much to get done. “I wish we could stay like this forever, but… I am sorry, but we have things to get done.” Godric finally looked back up at Sal, his face had gone blank, so Godric rushed to explain. “Salazar, Sal, the evilest man is currently Headmaster. And… Sal… I am so sorry… He... He is the reason Boudicca is dead. He used dark magic on her to bind her to him, and then… then he forced her to do unthinkable things. Sal, I am so sorry.”
The large room with its marble floors and tiled walls caused every slap and squelch to echo, driving him further towards the edge. It was easy to close his eyes and picture those smooth hairless thighs spread out around him, open and inviting. Wondered what Harry’s member would look like when it was filled with blood and need. Which way it would lean and if it would grow darker the longer he was aroused. Wanted to know each and every inch of skin and its taste. Needed to know the noises Harry would make with every touch. Which places would make him groan, which would make him moan, and what would make him feel so good it left him speechless.
This Will was witnessed by Sirius Orion Black
After that, they had all taken turns distracting Harry to slip potions into his drinks. The twins even showed him the classroom they warded and converted into a workshop, where they were working on a cauldron of calming draught for Harry. Neville owled his Grandmother that all he needed was her to send over the ingredients for the nutritional potions since he now had someone who could make the potions. It had taken the twins sending over their OWL results in potions and a vial of the potion for her to test their effectiveness. Once she was sure they wouldn’t accidentally poison anyone she had been willing to provide them with anything they asked.
She came back, dragging the much taller Rowena by her wrist. She too went wide-eyed when she saw who was in front of her but unlike Helga didn’t reach out, gathering Helga within her arms as a substitute instead. “Godric, we have waited so long to see your face once more. Where is Sal?”
Harry watched the man stride into the room, mesmerized by the pure confidence the Auror exuded. It almost seemed as if he glided across the quartz flooring, his black leather robes flapping behind him in a way that reminded Harry of Professor Snape. While he disliked how the man behaved, he couldn’t deny the man had a flair for the dramatic.
We are creating OC mate together there.
But what he found wasn’t what he expected. In the middle of a bedroom, spread out across the carpeted floor was Sirius and Remus. Remus was pinning Sirius’ much smaller frame under him, hands pinning his Godfather’s wrists against the floor. Sirius was shirtless, numerous bruises covering his body but what shocked Harry most was the animalist growl rumbling from Remus’ chest.
His mind yelled. Harry, filthy?! The sweet boy who had captured his heart, who Arthur had promised to protect as his own?
Lord James Fleamont Potter
It wasn't until he undressed for the night that he realized what it was that had been setting him off. His cloak fell from his shoulders, the pale skin underneath rising with goosebumps at the slide of silk over skin.
Siles was soon saying that he needed to go home and unpack his belongings, standing up to hug his brother as he did. It was funny to Harry to see how much taller Siles was then his older brother, and he couldn’t help the giggle that came out as Siles ruffled his brother’s hair, Lyle glaring playfully back at him.
“My family and I would never do anything to put Harry at risk, I can’t promise we will never do anything that might make him unhappy but we would only do it if the reason behind it was for his best interests,” Bartok assure, Charlie concentrating hard on the crystal to make sure there wasn’t the slightest flicker of red.
With Neville off with Anna and his Grandmother, Harry took the time to spend with his Godfathers showing them around his room. Lyle and David joined them since they didn’t have work, and soon the four adults were getting on like a house on fire.
Let me know what you think and if you see anything wrong please let me know so I can fix it.
Percy was trying to calm down the twins who looked ready to kill. Percy felt the same, and if his brothers weren’t able to control themselves Percy would be the first one to help cover up the murder.
Harry looked at his dad dumbly not even understand the question being asked. “What?”
“Is Harry safe?” Both twins asked in unison before anyone else could get anything out.
Albus snapped.
The box was wrapped in a sky blue paper, clouds drifting lazily and a snitch fluttering around. Harry’s hand darted out before he could stop himself, reflexes attuned to catch any snitch near him, from hitting the paper. As soon as he did the paper unfolded to reveal the box within. Harry gasped in delight, loving the novelty of the wrapping paper, and he swore to keep it.
“What she doesn’t know won’t make her mad at us,” Lyle wheedled, David used his patented puppy dog eyes.
Albus’ magic exploded again, ripping open the patches he had made to his core, everything in his office exploded outwards and Dedalus shooting from the room without even looking back. The whirlwind continued until his office was completely empty and his core was drained. He could barely make his way to the floo, stumbling as he called out Weasley Manor, only to see the office empty of everything besides a cheap glass orb Dippet gifted with him with when he became Headmaster.
While his Grandmother at first looked very worried, the more she heard, the more pleased she looked. Neville wasn't quite sure why but he had learned to trust his Gran in such things. She was raised to find advantages that others missed. While Neville knew she could easily destroy anyone, he also knew she would never do anything to hurt him. And because of that, she would use the advantages she saw to help Harry.
“Mr. Snape, I know you are angry-”
By now they were all crying, Harry’s face hidden within the crook of Sirius’ shoulder, Remus wrapping the two within his arms. They sat together for hours, both Sirius and Remus reassuring Harry that there was nothing wrong with him and that what the Dursleys said was only lies. When Harry tried to say being gay was unnatural once again, Sirius asked him seriously, “Do you think there is something wrong with Remus and I loving each other like that?” Harry was quick to say there was nothing wrong with it and that if they were happy, that was all that mattered to Harry.
It took them four hours just to get the whole chamber cleansed. And while the stones weren’t as saturated or brilliant as they once were with time and care they would return to their original state, and with Hogwarts now sentient they might be even more spectacular than they once were. The more they did, the more the magic of the room seemed to relax around them, hopeful and content.
Bartok, however, sat in his chair silently, looking away, wanting to give the two a modicum of privacy. Issy skipped into the room, not noticing the somber air or their now silently sobbing guest. “So we don’t have to worry about having Grandbabies anytime soon, poor Harry is so innocent!” She giggled and jumped towards Bartok, landing happily in his lap.
Neville recognized that same hidden deadliness his Grandmother showed when angered in Mrs. Claremore. That blink and you’ll miss it expression. She was like a Ricinus Communis, beautiful on the surface but hiding something sinister for anyone who messed with her.
Neville was determined to soak up all she taught him. He still was confident in himself but he was confident in his Gran’s teachings. So he relaxed back into his chair, listening while the others started talking again.
Harry wondered however if Neville grew Muggle species of plants within his garden and if he could maybe send one of the rose bushes to his friend. He would have to ask his parents if it was okay because he knew just how expensive they were. However, Harry suspected they would agree because Harry could see at least twenty of the bushes and could imagine them surrounding the rest of the manor.
Augusta went stiff once more, voice whip-like as it lashed against their skin. “Regulus has been dead for years.” Her wand was now out, grip tight and sickly green sparks jumping from the tip.
“If you need, you may cycle through the family crests or keep them invisible. Next, are your Heir rings,” Helix said as he pulled out another three boxes.
I am really sorry it has been so long, my depression has been kicking my ass. I hope to get back to writing but if the wait is long again I am really sorry. But I promise I will never abandon this story!
They finished their breakfast in silence, all thinking over what they had learned this morning and then went about their days.
He jumped to his feet, rounding on the chair that Albus was stuck and silenced to after he had tried to interrupt the proceedings. For the first time in years, he felt his wings burst through his skin and his glamour fall. Red and black leathery wings arched far above his head.
“Mr. Arthur Weasley, you requested a meeting with my client Mr. Harry Potter, but his Father, Mr. Bartok Claremore, as his legal guardian has requested that he speak to you first before you may see his son in light of the crimes committed by members of your family.” Helix looked at the six Weasleys, his eyes slightly tight.
Bartok relaxed, even though he knew his friend would never hurt him, it was best to take precautions. “The Potter’s Wills were sealed by that man, and now that Harry was able to go to Gringotts and speak with his Account Manager, they will be read in four day. Unfortunately, Dumbledore was mentioned in the Wills so will be in attendance, I was hoping you would come in your official role as Head Auror as back up. I doubt he will try anything on Goblin soil, but it’s not worth the risk.”
Let me know what you think and if you see anything wrong please let me know so I can fix it.
“It has come to our attention that you have custody of young Mr. Potter, is this correct?” Fudge asked, atrocious lime green bowler now being nervously turned in the man’s sweaty hands.
Something inside of him had shattered, not part of him but placed there by the old man in front of him. Severus knew what it was, a subtle slavery spell that slowly had taken over his body, making him a prisoner in his own body.  Severus could see the rage he felt echoed in Dumbledore’s eyes but that didn’t matter to him.
“Albus-” Diggle tried again.
They all leaned forward, pointer fingers inching towards the bowl. And suddenly they were falling.
Augusta didn’t back down, her eyes were still steely as her eyes bored into them both. Godric spoke up to break the tension since he knew if left to it, the two would spend hours in their stare down. “I know this is a touchy subject for everyone involved, but I promise on my life and magic we will wait until they have turned seventeen to participate in any sexual relationships with our younger bondmates.” The golden light that flashed around both Godric and Salazar caused Augusta to relax back into her seat, finally taking back up her teacup and sipping contentedly.
Bartok spoke up, composure already regained. “All I ask of you is to continue on this path. To protect our child with everything you have and are. And to treat him as the treasure he is, that is all we could ever want.”
And then the second point hit him,
Helga huffed and placed her hands on her wide-set hips, stern mother face on. That face had always made everyone to see it spill all their misdeeds. “Well, go to him! Make sure to bring him back here to visit us!”
The other one then spoke up, just as upset by the conversation, but voice much more steady than his brother’s had been. “We knew that they wanted Ginny to marry Harry but we had no intention of ever letting that happen. Ginny was obsessed and her behavior made Harry uncomfortable.”
This was done with her permission and blessing. This story for the first few chapters will follow her story closely, I will be adding lore, interactions, and emotions to those chapters. The farther along my version gets the more different it will become. If you have read Nest of Love you will know all the Claremore family OCs and the OCs who are Harry's mates. I hope to do them justice but still add my spin on them along with at least one of my OCs. Lastly, I hope you enjoy my choices for Harry's canon character mates. Please read the relationship tags to see who I will be adding.
Neville was quick to explain the whole situation, Anna filling in the information she had about what happened when Harry touched the wand and what David had found out from his research.
Anna greeted them all tightly, her usually soft demeanor turning sharp like the edge of a new blade.
Neville knew that his Grandmother was lonely, they both were, and they only had each other as family. Neville would do anything to protect her just like she would for him. And part of that was her gifting him with every dirty tactic she knew.
Arthur looked down, tears welling in his eyes, and the son next to him, took his hand and spoke up. “My name is Bill, and I am a curse breaker in Gringotts employ. My Father confronted the three, a truth serum slipped into their tea. Not only did we find out that Molly never married our Father and isn’t even our mother, but that Ron and Ginny aren’t our siblings. But what was most important to this situation is that we found out what their plans for Harry were. While my Father wouldn’t have disowned the two children for not being his, as he has raised them, what led to their disownment was the blatant theft and plans to force Harry into a marriage with Ginny where she would then produce an heir and kill Harry.”
Severus' hands were shaking as he slowly ran his fingertips up the top of his thighs, stomach fluttering when he hit a sensitive spot right above a sharp hip bone. He quickly removed his hands, gripping onto the sides of his long boney feet, letting his thumb circle the thin skin over his metatarsals. Touch so soft it was almost ticklish.
Bartok had decided not to tell Harry about the meeting later with the Weasley family. Helix had owled him just last night to inform him the Weasleys were trying to get in contact with Harry.  So after their meeting and Harry was home safely, he would head back to the bank alone. Bartok wanted to ensure that if the meeting went wrong, it wouldn’t hit his son as hard and that they meant him no harm.
“Do you truly care for Harry Potter?” Bartok wanted to make sure none of them were faking their friendship. Sure they might not have known about their ex-family’s plots but that didn’t mean they couldn’t have nefarious plans of their own.
But as Harry lead Remus by the hand to introduce the adults to each other Remus caught their scents. They were all non-humans and Remus couldn’t help but relax. Especially at the scent of a Werewolf. Remus knew that born Werewolves were very protective of those they considered pack and that this man would never allow Harry to be hurt.
Fred and George, who were now eighteen and able to use their wands outside of school had messaged them all with their
Percival sat forward in his leather chair, glass discarded on the side table, and gave all his attention to the conversation at hand. “What do you find out?”
Neville went rigid, head snapping towards his old Professor, and barked, “Marriage contract?” His eyes like razor blades and his words like hot steel.
Unbeta'd. This whole day was going to be like 15-20k words so I split it up to multiple short chapters.
Bartok’s eyes narrowed ever so slightly, he could see what the two men were trying to pull, and he would never allow it. He also knew that Lily and James Potter paid for Harry’s education in full after his first bout of accidental magic. “I appreciate your concern for the wellbeing of my son, Minister. However, I am a perfectly capable guardian for my son. He is loved very much by my whole family and is very happy.” Bartok checked his watch for show. “Now if you would please excuse me, I am late for dinner with my family.” As Bartok turned to leave, he noticed how Dumbledore clenched his fists at his side.
Once again thank you to the lovely Will, and Amycat8733!
Finally, he pressed a kiss to his mate’s forehead and stood from the bed, unashamed in his nakedness as he stood in front of his mate’s adoptive parents. They were all sitting there silently, eyes wide as they stared at him.
Harry looked at them again, he could remember seeing something like this on one of Dudley’s spy movies when he had been cleaning the living room. Harry placed the set down gently, caressing the buttery leather once more before looking at what else was in the box. There was a notebook also in Fred and George’s hand with instructions on how to use the set along with a set of locks to practice on. It was wonderful. He hated knowing someone knew about the locks on his door or on Hedwig’s cage, but they had done this so he could have the chance to save himself, and that meant the world to him.
Arthur opened his letter, eager to find out what had scared Molly.
“I am assuming your new title of Daddy would have something to do with it?” Siles questioned, once again looking Harry, who was now curled into Lyle’s side, up and down.
He pulled it out gently, noticing the apple icon on the side of the plastic case. Harry didn’t know what to think. “I don’t understand, I mean I know what it is, and I am thankful you got me this, I just… Doesn’t electricity not work around magic?” He really was thankful, he knew how expensive such a thing was, and he had always been curious about them.
Salazar sounded so sincere and dismayed, Godric just couldn’t stand it, so he cut him off. “It’s not your fault, all that matters is that we are together again and we can spend the rest of our years together. They will be long, full of both joy and sorrow, but we will be together.”
“What else did the Dursleys say were all of those things?” Remus asked cautiously, wondering what else they would have to assure Harry was normal.
He read the parchment aloud, all of his family leaning forward in their chairs in anticipation.
Unlike his Father, Alice’s hair was still full, just limp and shockingly white. Augusta would come monthly to cut both of their hair as they had worn it…
Godric had purposely kept Salazar within Gryffindor Manor for the last going on two weeks. So much had changed since the man was last awake that Godric knew if he just threw his mate out into this strange world with no prior preparation that he would have an absolute breakdown.
“Do you and your family want what is best for Harry, his health and happiness?” Charlie asked, arms crossed over his broad chest. He had only had the pleasure of meeting Harry twice but from the moment he first saw those beautiful green eyes, face squinted up into a broad smile he promised to take care of him. This promise was reinforced the moment he saw just how happy Harry made Fred and George.
“What are you two waiting for?” Helga questioned.
Sirius’s voice had lost the rasp it held when Harry had last seen him, and it spoke of him going through the healing process. While this news would have been wonderful, the words his Godfather spoke only made his stomach drop, and by the look on Remus’ face, he felt the same.
When Harry had gone to Remus at the end of the year, he had told Harry about his Father’s animagus form, that of a Scottish Red Deer, he had even pulled out a photo he seemed to keep in his breast pocket. It was obviously torn in half, but what remained was that of a large stag jumping around with a cherry red nose and fairy lights twined between its antlers.
Percival couldn't help the small chuckle that escaped his lips. His own House-Elf Winston was much the same, and he thought the two would get along well.
Before a fight could break out, Helix spoke up, the previously unseen Goblin warriors stepping forward menacingly with their sharp axes in hand, their attention focused on the Headmaster. “Mr. Dumbledore, if you will take your seat we can begin,” Helix’s voice was calm but the daggers he was shooting at the older wizard with just his gaze were deadly, and Dumbledore was soon sitting, taking his time as if it was his idea.
Harry serenely smiled down at the wand within his hand, not noticing all of his parents’ worried questions or Anna and Lyle shooting diagnostic spells at him. All he cared about was the warm weight in his grasp, the wand humming with magic, almost as mesmerizing as the unknown Phoenix’s song. Harry watched as the wand twisted its way around his wrist like a snake and then melted into his skin until all that was left a thin, perfectly straight black line on the inside of his wrist.
David was soon bundling Harry through the floo, the adults still too worried to let Harry floo on his own. A spike in magic could cause the person flooing to end up in unexpected places and with Harry’s core still recovering from his inheritance and the core bindings, his magic still tended to spike. But with one of the adults to take him through, he was in no danger. When they arrived at the bank, one of the Goblin warriors led them to the meeting room the Will reading would be held in.
Harry fidgeted, before a devious smile found its way onto his face. “But, Daddy, I thought I wasn’t supposed to talk to strangers.” He teased back, referring to the talk Bartok had given him over lunch yesterday about the general rules for the Courts. One of which was never to be alone without a parent or bonded mate before he reached maturity at eighteen.
Issy studied Harry for a few seconds before throwing her head back and cackling, skipping out of the room with a jaunty wave. Harry was confused by her action but shrugged it off and headed over to his wardrobe to retrieve his sleeping clothes, the soft black silk, like water in his hands. When Harry turned around to make his way to the bathroom, Neville had already started removing his clothes, shirt tossed on the floor. Harry blinked rapidly at the exposed planes of tanned skin and hard muscle, his forearms like small tree trunks. Neville looked up at him from his bent down position as he untied his boots, his eyes shadowed by thick lashes.
But secretly, within his own mind, he built a grimoire of all his discoveries and creations. Planning…
When he had first seen it at thirteen Neville understood why she had always done this and he wished he could just ask her to continue.
“Bartok, please inform the Goblins that I will take care of the missing Potter artifacts.” Bartok nodded in surprise but didn’t question it. “When I return, I would like to properly introduce myself to Harry, I will also bring one other with me.”
He had to sit and watch as the old goat fucker planned his mate’s death and there was nothing he could do to stop it; the slavery spells too strong for him to overcome in this form. But he had spent all that time carefully listening and learning. Dumbledore was so self-assured in his superiority and spell work that he found no problem in divulging all his past deeds and future plans to the Phoenix. At times he thought the old man forgot that he was a being and could at anytime regain a human form.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry made his way over to the other side of the bed, crawling under the duvet, pulling his teddy and soft blanket to his chest. Eyes half-lidded as he watched Neville awkwardly get into the bed too. They faced each other but were still at least eleven feet apart. Harry reached out a hand towards the middle of the bed, Neville doing the same. Their hands nowhere near touching but just the thought of being closer calmed Harry, the lights in the room turning off with a command.
Harry was lying in his bed, Neville on the other side from him. Harry had been preoccupied throughout dinner with the thought of how Neville would react to Harry’s revelation. He was still anxious but now, in the dark silence of his bedroom, teddy and Phoenix blanket clutched to his chest for comfort, he felt like he could whisper out the words. A small part of him hoping his friend was already asleep and would be unable to hear the confession. “I’m gay…” Harry tensed, waiting for Neville to burst into angry words or movements. But that didn’t happen, the bed shifted, Neville’s warmth coming closer.
For the past few days he had been stuck at the old fuckers side, the old wizard was frustrated when his pet Phoenix disappeared to parts unknown. It took him a few days to notice the absence before Dumbledore banned him from leaving.
The image made him blush, and it seemed like the most natural thing to have done. Harry wondered why he hadn’t just leaned in.
“As you can clearly see, Minister Fudge, Harry’s removal, and our Guardianship was necessary to his well-being. And it is in his best interest to remain with us.” Anna looked over to the Minister who seemed to have come to a decision, but before he could speak, Dumbledore interrupted. But Fudge just used this time to further analyze the situation.
Before he could apparate away, a voice called out to him. He recognized its whiny tone, and when he turned, it was indeed the Minister approaching him with Dumbledore and two Aurors following. Fudge’s smile was tight, obviously disappointed in the case’s outcome, but he spoke with a false sense of comradery. “Mr. Claremore! I am glad I caught you before you left, if you could spare a moment to speak I would appreciate that.”
But for now, Godric went to get the two Claremore ladies while Salazar watched over their guests.
Magic surrounded them, the war of his magic against his body finally stopped, and he finally felt at peace.
Godric knew that couldn’t possibly be true, but he knew to even attempt to lie to her would be the end of his life. So he opened up, in a way he had only reserved for his three best friends. “As he is my mate I want to get to know him, but more than anything I want to him to be safe. If he never wants to be with me, I will understand that, but I will still do my best to protect him and his interests.”
So Godric told him about the Purge, something he hadn't wanted his mate to learn from a book. The tale brought tears to Salazar's eyes, always so empathetic to others' struggles and tragedies.
His school belongings had all been new, and that had eased the ache a little, but it had still always been there. A yearning for more. And Harry always felt horrible when that monster reared its head, guilt filling him for his greed. It was something he never told anyone, he didn’t dare. Didn’t want to see the look on anyone’s face when they saw this dark part of himself.
Lyle burst out into guffaws, hand slapping down on the table in delightment. Harry looked at him in shock at the outburst, he couldn’t see what was so funny.  Lyle seemed to notice his confusion and choked out between laughs, “It’s a professional lock picking set. I love whoever gave that to you.”
After a few tense seconds, he finally removed his wand from between Molly’s shocked eyes. “Sorry, my dear, I was lost in thought and you surprised me.”
During his time as a slave, Severus had spent his time first building a secret chamber within his mind, his Occlumency of such a caliber that he was able to hide away his true mind behind titanium doors, leaving only a shadow of himself for Dumbledore to see.
I leave to Severus Tobias Prince of Cokeworth, England, if he shall survive me, Vault 590. I have left a letter for you as well as some rare potions ingredients. Lily also added her gifts to this vault and approved of everything I have put into it.
Sorry this took so long and that it's so short but I hope you enjoy it.
At the explanation Molly relaxed but was quick to reignite her fury, quickly whipping herself back into a rage. “Albus! I’ve got a letter from Gringotts saying that they are taking our money! Ginny and Ron also got one. They are charging us with theft Albus!
There he was, lying amidst deep green bed covers, hands laying atop each other on the duvet. He was just as beautiful as always, face wrinkle free and thick dark lashes fanning across pale cheeks.
Even with the confident whip of their robes and steady gazes, Harry noticed how different they looked. Snape’s haunting, deep black eyes contrasted sharply with Percival’s strangely warm blue ones. Snape’s black, lank hair hung obscuring his face while Percival’s blond hair was perfectly quaffed. Percival’s straight nose and thin lips a contrast to his Professor’s notorious aquiline nose and full lips. Their contrasts were striking and Harry imagined them standing toe to toe, assessing eyes trailing down their long bodies.
