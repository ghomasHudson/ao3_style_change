Draco did not learn where Ginny would get that particular tattoo because just then both Harry and Luna walked through the door, discussing intently. Harry looked...harrowed while Luna seemed to be in the midst of consoling him.

His wand was pointed at his assailant's neck, but whoever had grabbed him had Draco pinned to the wall. Draco could feel his breathing speeding up, and he prepared to cast when-
"What?" Hagrid spun around from where he'd been putting out his house with
Potter was, surprisingly, there, though he looked under the weather. His head was on the desk, and the Weasel and Granger were even closer to him than usual. Once Draco sat down the two kept shooting him looks. The Weasel glared at him, which was usual, but Granger was much more..cold, appraising. It was concerning, especially with his….position as well as Granger's ability with magic.  Draco shrugged, keeping his attention on Pansy. They wouldn't try anything, not with Snape around. Draco did a double take at the desk. Snape? Why was he here?
Harry sat across from Draco, the vial in front of him. It was a deceptively cheery yellow, too bright for what it was about to do. Harry looked at it, then at Draco, hesitant. "I could always-"
Like Atlas, they carried the weight of their worlds on their shoulders, and they could do nothing but weep and bear it.
Draco nodded. "Indeed, dearest."
Harry didn't want to wake up. He was already in the twilight between being asleep and being awake, but he was scared that if he slept, he'd watch what Draco had said all over again. Or worse, he'd have a good dream and wake up to find that Draco still hated him.
"Sabotage the- Oh sweet Merlin, Draco, you are as thick as a Cauldron Cake sometimes." Pansy huffed and dragged a now confused Draco out.
Draco resisted the urge to gasp, affronted. How dare he

of the meals for one, two, three days. He wasn't around the castle in any of his usual spots, either. Not that Draco was looking for him, he'd just casually asked a few people and he'd been observing his surroundings.
Clearly, Draco hadn't been aware of the entirety of this plan, if the horrified look on his face before he'd disappeared was anything to go by.

In a panic, he clutched at Draco's shirt. "Stay, please."
And with that, Draco was left alone with Harry.

"Merlin, Draco, no, never. I….I wanted to say sorry, actually say sorry." Potter's voice was quieter than Draco had ever heard it, there was no note of bluster or self-righteous arrogance that was so...characteristic of him.
"Oh, Harry, shh, shh." There was a shifting and then Draco was laying in the infirmary bed with him, his arms wrapped around Harry. Harry hadn't realized how cold he was until he felt Draco's warmth, and he snuggled closer. Draco's arms tightened around him and Harry felt his eyes closing.

Ron looked at Hermione for backup.
"HARRY! Harry, speak ter me, Harry. Yeh all righ'?" Hagrid's huge form loomed over him, and dizzily Harry wondered why he looked cracked.
"Well, you'll be happy to know that half the castle saw this relationship coming. I'd ask you to wait just a few more weeks though, I've got ten galleons on you two getting together

"What?!"
Draco shook his head. "The negative health effects of continued love potion use are well documented. I….I can't keep you like this, Harry."
wrong. He's...infuriating, so arrogant and messy and popular and-"
Draco glanced over to the Gryffindor table as he heard the ruckus. He'd rather not, he limited his view of the rowdy, uncivilized bunch to occasional glances here and there, for entertainment. Still, he found that Potter was conspicuously absent and Granger and the Weasel were kneeling on the ground. An odd sight, compounded when the Weasel lifted someone off the ground- oh, there Potter was. Unconscious again, the idiot. Merlin, but he looked so…
Hell, could Draco be called any kind of human after his task this year? He knew what….happened to a wizard's soul after….that. Draco could feel his left forearm burning, as it did whenever one of the Dark Lord's followers doubted themselves. The Dark Lord didn't bother connecting this part of the spell to himself, though most were wary of it. He knew his followers would cow away from the pain, and he was

Hermione scoffed. "There is a difference between a crush and...whatever you were doing with Malfoy, trust me. Besides, most likely he was the one who dosed you, we can't let you out and have him hurt you."

Pansy threw her head back and laughed. "You don't know about the Harry Potter fainting pool? I'd have thought
"So now what, Potter? Will you finish the job you started in the bathroom?" Draco was aware that he was being acerbic, but if he was going to die he wasn't going to go down quietly.

instruction if and when they went out, including instructions to run away and save himself. Dumbledore had been adamant on that, as well as the possibility of these journeys becoming fatal. If that situation occurred, Harry knew he wouldn't leave Dumbledore's side, which meant there was a large possibility that Harry wouldn't return.
Shit. He had to find Draco, he had to talk to him,
"Harry, you're awake!" Hermione smiled. "The potion is almost ready, it just needs to steep overnight."
"Yes, Luna. I- I saw you two. Kissing. I- I'm happy for you, I truly am, and I-" Draco was cut off by Harry laughing.
Drained, Draco closed his eyes, and let the darkness of sleep swallow him.
"I-" Harry paused. "I'm being an idiot, aren't I?"
. Draco!" Draco shook his head, snapping out of his reverie with Granger's sharp voice. Apparently he'd zoned off, stroking Harry's hair and staring at Harry and oh Merlin he was
"Still, if he was the one who..."
Snape cleared his throat. "I have a few announcements to make. First, Professor Slughorn and Professor Dumbledore have gone to a….conference, with professors from other schools. As such, I will be your substitute for Potions. This will not be a reprieve from homework, nor will I be teaching you in the….lenient style Professor Slughorn seems to prefer. Second, I have been given directions by our headmaster that it is….imperative that we ensure classes engage students of different Houses in….stimulating conversation. As such, the teachers have been instructed to set partners and groups of students in different Houses." He waved his wand and the chalk began scribbling on the board. "In a few moments, you shall find your assignment for a partner. This partner will remain with you until the end of term. Any...harm to your partners will not be tolerated, and will be referred directly to the Headmaster. Best of luck, especially to the exemplary students who may be partnered with...less talented peers."
"Malfoy, I know." Harry took off his glasses, pinching the bridge of his nose. "But seriously, guys, I feel fine. I'm not...overcome with some need to go find him, I just want to go on a bloody walk."
Luna squeezed Harry's hand, gently. "That they do, and then the people get all confused." Luna made a quiet sound of contemplation, a breathy sigh. "I should have brought my Spectrespecs, Harry, I'm sure I could still find some in your head."
"No, I'm not."
The way he walked straight to his dorm room reminded Draco painfully of that first night, in the abandoned classroom. This time, however, had an air of….finality. That night, Harry had left while looking at Draco with longing, as if it killed him to not be able to stay but this time...this time he'd looked like he couldn't get away from Draco fast enough.
Snape's face was all harsh lines, anger and revulsion painted clearly across it. Something hardened in his eyes instead of melting at Dumbledore's pleas.

"You guys
Draco curled around Harry, sobbing, and Harry buried his face into Draco's chest, his throat too sore too do anything but produce a silent scream.
Harry's brow furrowed. "Aren't you and Luna dating?"
But Blaise? Blaise had no connection to this, he wasn't particularly fond of Potter and for all their flirting both Draco and Blaise were
Harry huffed but he did as he was told.
Draco picked up the locket that Harry had thrown across the room with an angry shout. It had snapped open, the paper inside falling out.
"I was just saying, Draco, that I'm glad you came here." Merlin, that
Ron peered at Harry. "Bloody hell, mate, that cannot be comfortable." He got up and tried to pry Harry off, only to pull back in bemusement.
"I do
boy who can do
"I'm here, Harry."
Harry let out a laugh, which turned into a choked sob. Draco pulled him close and Harry buried his face in Draco's neck. Draco could feel his collar growing moist as tears spilled from his own eyes, and he just held Harry closer.
He was still a prat though, and he'd wear that mantle with pride. He had a reputation to uphold, after all.
Ginny was dead serious. "Harry, if you really don't want to, I'm not going to force you. Originally I was going to do it, but you're like a brother to me."  She shuddered. "That would be disgusting."
Draco felt light-headed. "Oh." Did that mean...if the potion was lifted, would Harry….
"Keep...keep fighting, Draco. Okay?" Harry leaned into Draco's hand. "If I go….don't give up."
come out of this, we both will, and we're coming out of this together." Draco tightened his hold around Harry, possessively. "You're not getting rid of me that easily."
But...other than that....it was clear that competency was not an issue. His family had never subscribed to the whole "stolen magic" theory, it was all a conspiracy to get the uneducated involved. But there had always been a level of...derision, that Draco had been taught to feel. Almost as if magic was only as "pure" as the blood. But seeing Granger work...that couldn't be further from the truth.
"Harry's...food?" Fuck. "...He's been put under a potion." It was like the ground fell away from under Draco's feet. "A....love potion?"
"Enough, Pansy!" Draco was
...there were dozens of doodles and scribbled messages on Draco's notes in that very same handwriting, words of love and affection and little hearts.
"Malfoy, get off him. Harry, I will deal with you
"I suppose that's why you gave me the Chocolate Frogs?"
Draco looked away.
Draco was walking through the halls, savoring the solitude. It was the quiet of the school after dinner, when everyone went back to their common rooms or to the library. It was close enough to curfew that people didn't go out unless they had to, but far enough that one could take a walk through the whole castle and back leisurely.
Pansy nodded snootily. "That would be acceptable." She took Draco's arm and the two made their way out of the Great Hall, dissolving into giggles.
know what I'm being accused of?"
As Harry finished the potion, he could feel clarity returning. He blinked once, twice, then he felt so heavy he stumbled, Draco holding him up. "Draco he-"
there was more to it than that, but that was the essential point.
"No Draco, it's...Dumbledore is...dead."
Potter closed the distance between them and….oh
? Perhaps the Sorting Hat had known that a Slytherin Ginny would have overthrown the Ministry of Magic by third year and for the safety of the wizarding world placed her in Gryffindor.
and oh hell, he was dead, wasn't he, he was dead and this was either heaven or hell, he had more than enough evidence for both.
at Ron. To be fair, it was more sleepy than threatening, like a little cruppy, but it was a growl nonetheless.
Harry sank into Draco's arms, burying his face into Draco's chest. Hermione was pacing while Ron slunk in his seat, pinching the bridge of his nose.
Maybe...maybe he shouldn't go. This could very well be a well-intentioned but harebrained scheme to….get Harry and Draco back together again. It would just be awkward and Draco would come out more in pain and it would just hurt Harry even more. Still, Draco opened the note. It couldn't hurt to see what was inside.
. "Now that stupid bloody cabinet won't bother you anymore." He smiled, smugly, and snuggled into Draco. Still, he monitored Draco's face. Shit...was that cabinet important?
Harry turned, slightly confused. "And this is supposed to-"
The potion turned out perfectly, with Snape making a snide remark on how perhaps this new system would allow poor students to perhaps learn something. Draco didn't even glance at Potter until the lesson was over and Potter's little posse came to collect him. He looked up, met by glares which he was used to and….Merlin. Potter looked absolutely downcast, his emerald green eyes somehow grayer as if his sadness was physically manifesting in his eyes as he looked away from Draco. He only saw Potter for a moment or two before he was rushed away and Draco was accosted by Pansy.
hate you right now. And I...I don't think I want to, and I don't know if thats the potion saying that or me." Harry ran a hand through his hair. "I...I
he was kissing. The realization blew Harry's eyes wide, and he recoiled slightly from the force of it.
So he pushed down the longing, and he ignored the dreams, not nightmares for once but
"Well there's just one solution for that. Sit up."
"Harry Potter, you rambling idiot, just stay still so I can heal you." Draco kept murmuring
Harry mouthed along Draco's jaw for a few more seconds, confused why Draco had turned. Harry turned to face the door as well and audibly gulped.
"Harry, you took Luna to the Christmas party, right?"
watch."
"No, you idiot, you aren't dreaming, and I'm more than willing to pinch you to prove it. But I've given you enough pain, so instead..." Soft lips pressed against Harry's and oh, Merlin, this was real, this was
"Mm? Oh, sorry Harry." Draco went back to stroking Harry's hair and there, that was perfect and Harry was almost drifting off and-
Ginny giggled. "There we go, Harry."
Harry chuckled softly. "What would I do without you, Luna? You were here to talk sense into me last year too." He turned to smile at Ginny. "Both of you, I- I can't thank you two enough."
Dumbledore, however, was engaging Draco in conversation. He asked about the necklace, the poisoned wine, the Vanishing Cabinet, and now, the Apparition shields being lowered, Draco confessed to all of it, one by one. He sounded...so unlike the Draco that Harry loved. Instead he was cocky, arrogant, everything that Harry had always seen and hated in Malfoy, but somehow darker, colder, haughtier. Each confession hit Harry hard, even though he'd known all of this before. It all felt so much more real now, with Dumbledore staring down the end of Draco's wand. Dumbledore's response to each confession was disconcerting as well, as if he was grading Draco's attempts, even praising him on occasion and giving him
have to go to Grimmauld Place."
One day, though, something changed. He was left alone, for once, and he could hear...an argument in the distance. He could tell the tones were angry, even if he couldn't make out what they were saying. Slowly, though, the people calmed down and someone sat by him. Just the one, with pale hair. Maybe Luna?
"Snape killed Dumbledore." Harry felt terribly cold. He shivered, and Draco wrapped his arms more firmly around him but it didn't stop the freezing, this bone-deep chill.
"We're more than happy to just lay here and stare into the sky with you. I'm sure Luna can tell us about some kind of creature, or we can talk Quidditch, or lay in silence." Ginny chuckled. "Or, you could tell us what's going on inside that head of yours."
Snape's face twisted into something monstrous. "DON'T CALL ME A COWARD-" He whipped his wand and Harry
red with indignation. "Not in front of everyone."
"Yes." Harry looked quizzically at Ginny, but a stern look from her made him look back at Luna. Luna giggled, whatever was happening was definitely planned between them.
Colin went starry-eyed. "I'm….your friend?"
Draco was surprised he could even form words. He was taller than Potter, but even as Draco looked down it was as if Potter towered over him. "I would...I would ask you why."
to, Granger, so please drop this whole cryptic act." Draco was growing exasperated. First, Harry (after what had just transpired Draco didn't think he'd be able to think of him as just Potter ever again) was the one to come onto
From the castle, the sounds of movement stopped. The battle had long since ended, when Snape had Disapparated so had the rest of the Death Eaters. Still, people had been moving, carrying the injured, clearing up. Yet suddenly, it was as if the castle had frozen.
Draco didn't let Granger finish. He stormed past her, bumping into her shoulder on the way out not entirely accidentally, heading straight for the dungeons. He brushed off an inquisitive Pansy, going directly for the bathroom. His face was carefully composed, up until he was locked in the bathroom, a soundproofing charm cast.
Harry stepped back. "I see, I'm sorry-"
Harry smiled back at Hermione, but it was thin, strained. "Do you mind if I borrow Draco?"
"You aren't sorry about it."
Luna, who had been respectfully keeping her eyes away from the note and focusing instead on a flower crown of dandelions, felt Harry shift and looked at him. She scanned his face for a few moments and seemed to come to an understanding. "Where should I tell everyone to meet?"
hurt you."
Draco was let go and he slumped slightly, catching his breath. The attacker whispered a quiet "Lumos" and Draco was met with brilliantly green eyes.
"Take him to the Room of Requirement." Hermione turned back to the books, a new one already open and ready to be pored over.
Harry grit his teeth. "Draco…do you have the Mark?"
person for this, I don't even experience romantic attraction. But I do know that I care about you, and this has been hurting you. Harry...you were under a potion, but Draco wasn't. Everything he was saying, everything he did...that was all Draco."
. Draco had...he'd expected so much more from his godfather. He knew he was a Death Eater, but...he'd wished that maybe, just maybe, he was still working for Dumbledore. But he wasn't, and now the Death Eaters knew about the Order and their plans. They also, unfortunately, knew about Draco and Harry, which meant Draco could most likely never go home. It was...painful, but at least he and Harry no longer had to hide.
"I forgive you."
shag, but other than that he's just one of you all, an arrogant, self-righteous
"So..." Harry began. "..How have you been?"
"Severus..." Harry would have widened his eyes if he could have. Dumbledore was...pleading Snape. "Severus, please."
The blood drained from Draco's face and he shared a panicked look with Hermione. “Tomorrow?”
"Oh, boo hoo you big baby. Sit up." Ginny motioned to Luna, and she sat up too.
Draco blinked away the tears brimming up in his eyes. "I promise, Harry." He grinned. "Since I've been working with Hermione and Dumbledore, I found that your...Gryffindor foolishness that you all call bravery seems to have rubbed off on me. I don't think that will be going away any time soon."
about this evening, Headmaster. At least, not for you." Draco was speaking loudly. Too loudly. Harry only grew more confused as Draco continued. "You failed at protecting your precious school, and now dozens of Death Eaters are here as we speak. What a shame."
Harry stared across the Great Hall, towards the Slytherin Table. Draco looked...oddly pleased today, which was a huge contrast from every single morning thus far. Instead of just a cup of black coffee with so much sugar put in Harry felt his own sweet tooth recoil, Draco was actually eating some fruit and a pastry, with significantly more cream in his coffee. His hair was styled, not with as much gel as he used to, but not as unkempt as it had been. Even the dark circles under his pale gray eyes were lifted in a smile, as he joked with Pansy Parkinson. She was half in Draco's lap at this point, playing with his hair. He shook his head, taking a bite of breakfast as he continued to examine Draco. He'd find out what Draco was up to, it certainly couldn't be anything good.
Ginny nodded, wordlessly wrapping Luna and herself in the cloak and walking away with her.
years. He was lucky enough that his mother had taught him Occlumency, so he could shield his feelings from the Dark Lord and display safer thoughts that would please the….could he even be called a man anymore?
A burning in his left arm reminded him
Draco looked down, fidgeting with his hands. "Harry...can….can you please hold me?"
"What?" Harry sat up, looking at Ginny.
A strand of hair fell into Luna's face and Harry brushed it away, gently. "You sure?" Luna nodded and Harry leaned in.
I'm getting a Pygmy Puff tattooed on my-"
Harry knew things had gone horribly wrong when he saw the Dark Mark over Hogwarts. As they flew back to the castle on Madam Rosmerta's brooms, Harry felt his heart racing. Dumbledore was weaker now, maybe so weak he would not be able to fend off the attack. The Order was here, they should have been able to fight off a handful of Death Eaters
"Hey!" Ginny punched Harry in the arm, lightly. "That was me!" Luna nodded, giggling.
That still didn't explain Blaise. Pansy made sense, she...understood the way Draco felt, and of course he'd told both Pansy and Blaise about the whole situation, potion and all. He felt guilty for using her but they both knew she'd do the same if need be. They were practically betrothed, though for a while Draco's parents had had their eyes on that little Greengrass girl. She'd proven herself too liberal for them, though, so instead the Malfoys and the Parkinsons had come to an agreement. Draco and Pansy had come to an agreement of their own. There were many ways they could produce heirs without having to...have sex, and they'd let each other be with the people they wanted to be with. Daphne's parents were chill enough that she'd never have to marry, and Draco...well until then he hadn't exactly had a boyfriend, other than a
no one was listening. "Draco I...I need to talk to you."
"I leave you for three days, Harry, three days, and you do this to yourself." That...that voice. He must finally be dreaming.
In the midst of laughing, Harry realized that Ginny and Luna had solved a dilemma he'd been pondering over for the last week in under an hour. Truly, they were...amazing.
"Come, Harry." Dumbledore looked...oddly composed, even though his breath was shallow and his blackened hand was close to his chest. Even though his voice was rough from the cracked sobbing that had been caused by the potion on the island, it held steady.
with Potter looking at him like

Then they were both giggling, holding each other tight. The fireplace cast a soft glow over the now-dark common room, warming them up. As Harry yawned and curled into Draco, Draco stroked his hair.

unbefitting of him. "Ah. And are you going to act on these feelings?"
The jealousy he was feeling was probably the biggest indicator that Harry was under a spell. Usually he'd be fine with it but now....now
Draco smiled back, most likely weakly. "I'm glad I came. Now, what is so important that you need to talk to us?"
. He felt Harry push him against the wall again and Draco wrapped his legs around Harry's waist and Harry's hand was sliding up Draco's back and Draco's hand was in Harry's beautifully messy hair and-
Potter looked up from the ground, eyes wide as they met Draco's. "What?"
Harry had barely made it to the door when it burst open, the person behind it yelling "
Granger picked up. "A treacle tart. Which shows us two things, first the attacker knew Harry's favorite food-"
, not even a prat of a Gryffindor like Harry Potter. I get that you are hurt, I get that you think this is easier, but once the potion is gone, you both can move the fuck on. Until then, you need to go back, take him back while he's under the bloody potion, and help those fucking Gryffindors get him out of it. If you don't...I don't think I'm going to be able to look at you the same way." With that, Blaise turned around and walked away, heading straight for his bed.
"I just lay down!"

They'd talked about this before. Dumbledore had made it very clear that Harry was to follow
Draco blinked, shaking his head. "Ah, yes." Somewhat reluctantly, he turned away from Harry, returning to his notes. "So, we've ascertained that the potion isn't a love potion targeted towards you, Madam Pomfrey's results helped us confirm that. And the last thing he'd eaten was-"
Draco scoffed, his chest burning. "Yeah, right." He turned away, unable to look at Harry, mixing in the armadillo bile.
“...Yes.” Harry said, slowly. “Is...is something going to happen tomorrow?”
"Brood like that any more and I'm going to have to admit that the Prophet is right in calling you in calling you the hottest celebrity in the world." Ginny lay down next to him, the grass rustling. Ah, Ginny. He'd been so proud of her after they had won the House Cup that he'd picked her up and spun her around. They'd quickly split when the whole common room had begun chanting for them to 'kiss, kiss, kiss.' Harry did love Ginny, but not...that way. No, Harry decidedly to resolutely ignore any feelings in that direction, they were distractions from his mission. Besides, when they had won Harry had still been under that blasted potion, and the only person he'd wanted to kiss was...He shook his head, almost missing what Ginny was saying. "Though the fact that they are sexualizing an under-age man is
"Shame for me, indeed, but you must be feeling proud, Draco. You've played your part well. Now, where are your friends?" Dumbledore wasn't making much sense either. Harry couldn't help but feel like he was missing something important.
Harry gasped, a hand to his chest. "You didn't."
Harry, frozen, watched the force of the spell strike Dumbledore and blast him out the window. For a moment, he looked suspended in the air, before he fell out of sight.
Happy, Harry finally drifted off.
"The cabinet, that was a Vanishing Cabinet, Draco- What were you going to do with that Vanishing Cabinet?"
The betrayal was a blunt force to Harry's chest, heavy and hard, knocking the wind right out of him. This was not in the plan that he was told. Harry had been told that the Death Eaters would be dealt with, that Draco would be safe with the others, that everyone would be
Draco's eyes widened. "You can't be serious."
he was
Soon, Harry fell asleep, chest rising and falling with each slow breath. He looked so much more...peaceful asleep, and Draco could almost pretend that there was no war, no Voldemort nor Dumbledore, no Death Eaters, and no Order. Just Harry who glowed like fire, even when asleep, and Draco, the boy made of ice who couldn't help but melt when Harry was around. An odd pair they were, they shouldn't fit but they did. They were puzzle pieces that didn't quite connect before but now were morphed so much that they would only ever fit each other.
Harry felt the corners of his vision darken. Parkinson walked away quickly, after giving Draco an indiscernible look, but Zabini's mouth seemed to turn down, his eyes narrowing. He too walked away with Parkinson, but Harry didn't care about either of them, not with Draco...sneering at him like that.
Soon, Harry felt the wound seal, and he leaned into Draco, kissing his shoulder where Harry had buried his face. "Ew, you taste like blood."
Pansy giggled, leaning in to whisper into Draco's ears. "Draco, darling, that's what a Muffliato is for. I cast one much earlier, so we could go...without observation."
Draco stopped. Again. Fuck this. Harry fumbled around the nightstand until he found his wand, and he pointed it at the cabinet. "
"I know. What I did...it can't be apologized for. You could have
let this insult stand. He grabbed Harry's collar, spinning them around so Harry was pushed to the wall, and kissed him soundly. Harry's arms wrapped around Draco's waist and Draco rested his arms on Harry's shoulders.
Harry spluttered. "No, Luna, you're a lovely girl, it's just that-"
"And try not to mess them up like you did the ginger root."
Harry sighed, looking away. "About...feelings. Feelings I didn't know I had, that I have now been able to...understand."
"If by good authority you mean your horde of fans, the Prophet, and a certain Slytherin then...eh, I'll accept it." Ginny shook her head, stretching.
Ginny only laughed harder. "If they could handle you last year, when you were mad at all of us for
Which brought him back to the locket. Harry had been shattered when he realized the locket was a fake, it wasn't a Horcrux but a duplicate, left by some rogue Death Eater. Dumbledore had
felt about Draco. Granger and Weasley came into the room, looking deeply troubled.
For the first time, Draco wondered if perhaps Potter hadn't tried to sabotage the potion, if instead he was...trying something else. The fluttering in his chest at the thought confused Draco even more.
Blaise grit his teeth, his dark eyes burning into Draco's. "I watched my father
“Ron, Hermione, you go next. I’ll go with Draco. If we get caught, he can just say he caught me out of bed, it’s a good cover.”
"It's okay, mate. You're not thinking clearly right now, we aren't going to blame you." Ron shook his head. "We just want to make sure...are you okay?"
"And you think you can prevent that by cutting me off from the person who taught me to love?" Draco raised an eyebrow.
The castle walls rung when Hagrid wailed in mourning.

"I've got no idea what you're talking about, Harry." Ginny smirked.
So instead of sitting and brooding over his potatoes, he spoke up. “So is it just a fun film, or is it one of these stupid ones trying to teach kids a lesson?”
Draco frowns, his eyes narrowing.
Draco leaned next to him. "This is surreal."

Harry couldn't have stopped the loud snort from escaping his nasal passages if he had sealed off his nostrils with a Sticking Charm.
Harry moaned as Draco dragged himself up, and then he took a breath and said roughly, "Pretty sure political corruption is the whole reason we're fucking right now, Draco. Don't knock it till you try it, and all. Oh
He sighed. “No, it’s fine. We’ll just call it even, then, both coming here and having to trust the other. Kind of like how we both almost killed each other and both saved each other’s fucking lives.”
Malfoy turned a fraction towards Harry. "Do I look like I would order something called a
Draco collapsed into one of the chairs. "Harry. We need to talk."
"I should go," Draco murmurs.
"I mean, that's not a lie. Well, I guess these Muggles might just think you were goth. In any case. You look ridiculous."
"You're ridiculous."
"Of course, Jorg," Harry said, grinning like a cheshire cat. "Thank you!" He turned to Draco, ready to run to the lift, but Draco was searching through his suit pockets.
"A research blackout," Draco spat. "As a division operating under the Ministry budget, they're no longer allowed to use Ministry funds to research a whole list of topics, which compose most of the Unspeakables' research agenda. They've also been told they're not allowed to publish their 'opinions'—which seems to be how Rump is referring to research findings, 'opinions'—or to talk to the public about their research."
fine, but it's not like he has a choice, so it'll be fine.
“You’re one to talk,” Harry said, slumping onto a stool.
Fingers, Professor Potter.”
Harry scans the crowd, flinching when a woman walks by with a large, pregnant belly and he thinks of Ginny.
"You look…bloody marvellous. Luminous."
He places his hand on the wall. "I've never done this without a wand. Give me a minute."
"Potter," he greeted airily.
"Yes, you. It takes two people to be in a life together like this."
be off celebrating with people? You just won your trial."
In his darker moments—after waking from nightmares, or when thinking of the people he's lost—Harry thinks he should be bracing himself for the inevitable end of this thing with Draco. He should keep his distance, so it won't hurt so badly. He shouldn't laugh at Draco's antics and let all his guards down when they're in bed. He shouldn't open up about his closely guarded secrets—his worries that he's not good enough, that there's too much darkness in him, that Voldemort ruined him.
Harry points a finger at Draco. “Three days.”
my flat. I'm living near RAMag, and it
Harry nodded. "Thanks. Just, I know it's a lot. I don't want you to feel like the Potter family Christmas celebrations are taking over to the point where you can't do your usual Christmas stuff."
Fuck's sake. How was this his life? Though he supposed stranger things had happened in plenty of families, it felt like his life generally surpassed all others in sheer preposterousness.
Albus's phone dinged. "Matty wants to know if we want to come over. Apparently his dad is getting trollied on Kilkennys."
Scorpius nodded, and the two of them disappeared into the kitchen. It reminded Harry of before Albus and Scorpius were a couple, when Scorpius used to come spend the weekend with the Potters, and he and Albus would walk around attached at the hip, whispering, eating every bit of food in the house.
"I dunno," Harry said. "I'm just trying to figure out why you won't tell me."
“You are
"Don't look at me, mate," Ron said, laughing. "And don't call her my 'wife', unless you want to get smacked. And it's not our fault you're drunk."
"Your father thinks we're too old for that," Draco added unhelpfully.
"I've got two more weeks, then Fleur is taking another two months."
"Fuck," Harry said quietly. "Stop, please."
"What do you think snaking is?" Draco asked, squinting at the skaters.
"Yeah, I know. I guess you just make that clear right at the beginning of the op-ed. Like, these are the stakes." Harry screwed on the nipple and handed the bottle to Draco.
"I don't think I can do it without more magical power." He sighs, burying his head in his hands.
Maybe the problem wasn't the wedding at all. Maybe the problem was that he and Draco had never really discussed their
“What are you doing?” Ron asked, approaching their desk.
"No, I was in the loo. He left a note."
Having adult children was a trip—they were self-sufficient, but they somehow retained their need to complain to him about everything. Like nothing bad could possibly have happened to them unless they related it to one or both of their parents. Harry found it charming. He wished he had someone who would always listen to his whinging.
"Wow, Mi." Harry blinked. "Have you ever considered going into motivational speaking?"
Wilhelm winked, which was disturbing, his little wooden eyelid clinking down, and Harry waved his wand and watched him disappear from Harry's hand.
"You need to be at class in one hour," Hermione says, frowning, hand on her hip. "And you can't rely on me to wake you up!"
"I was," Draco said, taking a sip of whiskey. "Hermione and I were talking all day. Give me one minute to figure out how to say this without freaking you out." He closed his eyes, almost like he was trying to do a micro-meditation.
what I think about you, Weasley." There wasn't as much bite in Draco's words, though, not as much as there used to be. Neither in Weasley's for that matter. As far as the pureblood supremacist part....working this closely on a combined goal with Hermione Granger of all people had….shifted Draco's feelings on that front. He still had sincere grievances.

was warm, like firelight that flickered across his glasses, setting his copper skin aglow. Draco's eyes flicked to Potter's lips, chapped but full, then back to his eyes, the green darkened by his pupils. He saw Potter was fixated on Draco's lips, and he licked them, conscious. Potter shivered, looking up to make eye contact and coming impossibly closer, warm against Draco, their breath mingling. "Can I show you why?"

, that felt so
Harry turned away. "There is no story."
Draco was visibly shaking, and despite the pain Harry was feeling at Draco's betrayal he wanted nothing more now than to comfort him.
The woman spoke up, her voice unpleasant and croaky. "The boy has failed...Snape, you were right."
A reputation that was becoming harder and harder to keep with Harry bloody Potter nuzzling into his side like a little crup. Perhaps Draco was feeding into it by continuing to stroke through Harry's hair but hey, it wasn't Draco's fault that despite being so unruly Harry's hair was so bloody soft.
Draco just snarled. He turned his head towards the two brooms, now discarded on the floor by Dumbledore's feet, then to Dumbledore. Dumbledore simply tilted his head to the side, about where Harry was standing, and Draco seemed to...nod?

"Oh, yes. I forgot. Gryffindor-Slytherin, the whole...yes. It would be...improper of me to..." Harry nuzzled closer to Draco, feeling him tense, and Draco held him just a little tighter. Totally to support him, not for...comfort. Draco knew how the world worked, he'd grown up in this world and he knew its rules and he knew not following them would only result in pain.
After that, no one attacked Harry. No one attacked Draco either if Harry was around, which is why Harry was
"Yep. She was sitting right across from you, she even called your name as you bit in to get your attention, but you were...distracted.” Ginny wiggled her eyebrows, laughing at Harry’s exasperated expression. “Oh relax, Harry. Besides, she's not going to be trying that again anytime soon. You won't even see her for a day or two, not while her hair seems to be mysteriously turning gray and falling out. Quite a mystery, no one knows why." Ginny examined her fingernails with a coy look.
. Clearly, he didn't care that Draco was watching even if he wasn't supposed to use magic. "Don' say that Harry-"
The last spell Dumbledore had cast, would be
"Is it a stretch for me to say that Draco is….one of them now?" Harry whipped his head around to face Ginny, more shocked by her use of Malfoy's first name than her question. Ginny rolled her eyes. "You two were practically hanging off each other, I threatened to hex his balls off if he hurt you, then I threatened to do it if he didn't call me Ginny. That's not the important part. He's a Death Eater now, isn't he?"
Harry just exhaled, grabbing Draco's hand and pulling him out of the bathroom, away, to a quiet corridor. He only spoke when he was
when he was confused. His brows furrowed and- Draco
Harry recoiled. He couldn't get his mouth to work, he couldn't get his body to move any further than a few steps from Draco, he couldn't even form tears. It was like he was hit with some cruel form of
Draco would fight a thousand and one wars for Harry, to be able to hold Harry close like this. For now, though, he was content to just get through this one.
Harry nodded, slowly, and Ginny let out a low whistle. "Merlin's pants, Harry, what a story. The prophesied Chosen One and perhaps the youngest Death Eater known to the Wizarding World."
Harry grinned, getting up and putting his glasses back on. "Of course." He stretched, stepping out of the Common Room and walking leisurely to the Great Lake. Only when he was a few hallways away did he duck behind a pillar, pulling out the Marauder's Map. He'd never meant "I solemnly swear I am up to no good" more than that moment when he whispered it.
Harry shrugged. "Go for it."
"Mm, hey Draco." Harry just snuggled closer.
Things were, if perhaps not going to Dumbledore's plan, then within the limits of safety. At least, Harry hoped that was correct. Dumbledore would never let Hogwarts be compromised, after all. Surely, whatever was going on he knew how to handle it.
Everyone and everything in the hallway was suddenly levitating. It was quite a sight, papers flying out of people's hands, the suits of armor lifting impossibly high. Then, one of the people started
"...Draco, do you-"
Harry doubled over, laughing, and Draco would
He hated this. He hated the way Granger nodded and he hated the way that she was looking at him now, almost out of pity. He hated the way he could feel the blood draining from his face, the way he could feel his stomach turn.
Ron sat up. "What?" Hermione paused her pacing.
kept doing that with his tongue, yes
The Death Eater who'd burst into the room dropped his hood, revealing unkempt, platinum blond hair. Draco pointed his wand at Dumbledore, who looked at him with his usual cool composure. Still, Harry could see Dumbledore sinking slowly against the wall, his legs giving out.
Draco buried his face into Harry's hair. "I...He has my parents, Harry. He's living in my house, and it's like he's keeping my parents hostage. He said he'll kill them if I don't-"
Were the people in the castle safe? Were his friends safe? Had the Felix Felicis lost potency too soon, was it spread too thinly? Dumbledore and Harry dismounted, and Harry rushed to give the headmaster support as he swayed on his feet.
when my mother decided she'd had enough with him. She didn't have the mercy that she had with her other husbands, killing them quickly with poison. She tells me to this day that he was the only man she came close to loving, but that's a bloody lie. If she did, she wouldn't have pushed him away while still giving him the bloody fucking potion. He died slowly, painfully, and she
"Regulus Arcturus Black, R.A.B." Draco let out a shaky exhale, relieved that his memory had finally come through. "My uncle Regulus, Sirius's...brother." He quietened when he felt Harry flinch at Sirius's name, but he continued. "He was a Death Eater, once, but he was killed by Voldemort himself for trying to defect."
Draco sighed. Maybe he'd been slightly harsh. "I've been fine, Harry. And you?"
Both Draco and, surprisingly, Harry had gotten piles of hate mail, even Howlers, for their "mistakes" and their "sin". Harry was accused of being seduced by the enemy and Draco was the Scarlet Letter. (He figured he was using that expression right. Hermione was introducing him to Muggle literature, which he surprisingly enjoyed.) Draco was at the point where he'd just incinerate the lot after sorting through it for mail from people they trusted.
them.
Perhaps this would be a mistake in the long run. Still, seeing Colin so happy in the moment somehow made Harry not as worried about how Colin would act later on. "Yes, Colin. We're friends."
Hagrid thought he was lying now, but Draco didn't. He just held Harry closer, whispering words of comfort as Harry shivered uncontrollably in his arms. He couldn't even cry anymore, he was numb, cold.

"Do you mind if I give you a bit of advice, Harry?"
Draco gently traced the new scar on Harry's face. It connected off the edge of his lightning bolt, streaking across his nose to the opposite cheek. Harry shivered, leaning into the touch, his eyes closed. Draco marveled at how the scars didn't take away from Harry's beauty. If anything, they added to it, his beautiful, strong boyfriend who was fighting so much, for so long. It would only get harder from here.

is cured now, and so our….propinquity is no longer necessary." Draco stood up, brushing down his robes.
Harry's smile began to fade, and Draco immediately regretted the question. “Tomorrow...I’m going out with Dumbledore. It’s….an important mission, to weaken Voldemort but...it will be dangerous. I wanted to let you all know so that...if anything happened, you guys would know where I’d been.”
Hermione spoke, softly. "Look, Harry, we just...don't want you to get hurt." She quickly added "Or him," when Harry gave her an exasperated look.
"I'm not even sure what you are
Hermione shook her head. “I’ll tell you later, Ron. This...this is a good plan.”
Okay, maybe Draco felt guilty for what he said. But to have his heart ripped out like that? He was more than a little justified to be pissed off. Besides, this would ensure a clean break. Potter would avoid him, he'd be cured and he'd go back to hating Draco, and life would continue as normal.
Ah. Luna. Draco smiled at him, because his only other option was to snap and do...something emotional. Scream, cry, something that would be

The mention of Malfoy sobered Harry slightly. "Look, Gin-"
Even after Harry felt the spell break, for a few moments, he felt that same helplessness.
Luna was smiling softly at Harry, and Harry couldn't help but smile back. "Yeah, I did, as friends-"
He jumped out of bed, quickly brushing out as many wrinkles as he could from his robe. He ran to the library, but they weren't there. Shit, where would they be? The potions lab, maybe. No, that was too obvious, too open. Of course! Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, that's where they brewed. He took all the shortcuts, stumbling into the room. Yes, there were Hermione and Draco, leaning over a steaming cauldron.
"Ron, if he was the one who dosed me, I feel like I'd know. Right now I don't feel anything but

"The…?"
Hermione sighed. "Let's just get this potion off of Harry, then we can go back to normal."
"Children taste good any time of the month, Dumbledore. I could hardly pass up such an...inviting trip. The young Malfoy has done at least one good thing tonight, even if he fails at the task he has been given by the Dark Lord."
"Oh. I've fallen." He didn't know if he thought that or said it aloud, but then everything blurred and he closed his eyes.
this R.A.B but he wasn't sure who. As he racked his memory, he sat next to Harry on the worn red couch, wrapping his arms around him.
Draco's breath faltering was all the confirmation Harry needed. He stepped back, eyes watering as he looked up to the ceiling.
Pansy tittered in his ear as she gathered her things, preparing to move to her assigned seat. "Have fun, darling, try not to get too lovestruck." This time she dodged Draco's hand, laughing as she walked away.
. He'd grit his teeth and forged on through the hallway, but when Draco was tripped, most likely by the same caster, Harry lost his temper.
"I don't need your pity. I need you to know that I wouldn't wish that on
Luna giggled softly. "It's okay if you don't want to, Harry."
, that replayed the last moment in his head and took away not only the movement but the warmth from his body, leaving him cold, frozen.
. Harry got the idea that perhaps Dumbledore was biding his time, but for what, Harry had no idea.
Potter caressed Draco's cheek with his thumb, catching a tear and wiping it away. "What if I told you I didn't want to fight you? What if I told you...I wanted you to stay alive?" He stepped closer and Draco's breath caught in his chest.
The mail was nothing compared to the treatment at school. Harry had taken to escorting Draco class to class (though he'd probably do that regardless), because the moment Draco was left alone, someone from any of the four houses would attack him. It was funny that all it took for house unity was a gay inter-house Gryffindor-Slytherin couple.
in that moment, his teeth bared in a snarl as he glared down the Ravenclaw. He'd been about to pull out his wand when Draco, who had somehow floated to Harry, put a hand on Harry's shoulder. Draco had gripped Harry's shoulder, gently but firmly, and Harry had closed his eyes. As Harry deflated, everyone else had slowly been lowered to the ground. Even the Ravenclaw had been lowered a few feet, but they fell to the ground with a painful thud. People had given that student a wide berth as the Ravenclaw walked, limping, to the Hospital Wing. Draco had half led, half carried Harry to the Gryffindor common room, his first visit that had led to so many more.
Granger only seemed to examine him further, staring at Draco as if scanning his very soul. "You...have you sent anyone to put anything into Harry's food?"
Ginny's voice was quiet when she spoke up. "Draco Malfoy is a prat, Harry. He's always been a bigoted prat, but surely you've noticed that this year, when he hasn't focused so much on showing how much of a prat he is, he's been...largely more tolerable. And with all the observation you've been doing of him...I'm not surprised you fell for him. The love potion was just the last straw, you finally saw how he was under all those masks."
He turned back to face Harry. A crown of dandelions lay in his soft, curly hair, the yellow stark against the black. It was crooked and Draco's hands itched to set it right, if only to run his hands through Harry's hair again.
“You swore to obey me, Harry — go!"
They'd make it through this somehow, Draco thought as his own eyes closed and he pulled a blanket over the two of them, sliding a cushion under his head and shifting Harry's head onto his chest.
"Not that I don't- want to..." Draco found himself blurting out. "I just….I can't hurt Luna like this, I can't let you hurt Luna like this."
, leaving the classroom cast in shadow.
So Harry had moved on. At least Draco knew he was Harry's aesthetic type when he watched Harry and Luna kiss. Most people placed Harry with Ginny, but Draco was glad that, if anyone, Harry had chosen his cousin. She'd be able to get through to Harry when he was being a prat, and Harry was kind enough to keep an open mind and listen to Luna's theories. Ginny was...she was too much fire, Harry and her would be passionate but short, burnt out before they really started. Draco shook his head. There was no point theorizing Harry's love life, all he'd be doing is digging himself deeper into his sadness.
"Just missed you." Harry looked up at Draco, smiling lazily.
"Ah, Amycus, Alecto. It is wonderful to see you two again."
Finally, Harry scanned over the note, and a pit formed in his stomach. Tomorrow, he was to meet with Dumbledore. The note said to bring his cloak which meant they were going out which meant….Dumbledore was finally making good on his promise. They were going to find a Horcrux.
"Or us, when we defend Draco?" Ron added. Draco shot him a grateful smile. He'd been most worried about befriending Ron, but after he'd apologized over and over, profusely, about his treatment of him, his family, and Hermione, and after he'd shown that he'd changed Ron had become a fast and loyal friend. "Besides, mum would
Just then, four more Death Eaters burst in through the door. A lumpy man, a stodgy woman, some mangy man that looked oddly familiar to Harry, and someone who had their hood drawn still. Harry could hear the battle still raging behind them for the few moments that the door was open, and he thanked god, magic, anything that was listening that they hadn't lost Hogwarts.
Ginny cackled. "Oh he's going to be high for a

Ginny showed up next, at exactly midnight, waving at Hermione and Ron and sitting next to Draco. She looked at the door and sighed. "As usual, he's late." She turned to Draco, rolling her eyes. "If he is

"Plus the fact that we'd be worried the papers would have a field day, considering our sons are married."

Harry nodded, glad for the distraction, and unsure why he felt so sad. "Let's put in those pickled cucumbers he bought. No way am I going to eat those."
"Well?" Astoria said, propelling herself off the wall in her eagerness.

"You're the best," he said. "Have I mentioned? You didn't have to come. I know you're busy."

Harry said the first thing that came to mind. “Er, situation: I need to decide what to do after school. Automatic negative thought: every job fucking sucks.”
Harry huffed a laugh, running a hand through his hair. "Right. Funny how you and Albus, two Slytherins, can end up with such different approaches."

. Harry needed to start thinking things through.
Hermione came in from the garden, looking around at the mostly empty house. "How can I help?"
"I think I'll know when the Dark Lord is close." My voice sounds small and I look down at my left forearm. I hate looking at it. I can't even wank without covering my arm.
"It's possible," Harry says, choosing his words carefully, "that I was putting a little too much pressure on Ginny. In terms of what I was expecting."
Harry came to a halt, taking in all the people and trying to recalibrate his behaviour from Cursing Angry Harry to something a bit more in line with Saviour Harry.
“Is that even a thing?”
Harry fidgeted in his seat. She was right that he felt he was seeing the truth. That post-war politics in Magical Britain were fucking hopeless. That the left’s self-congratulatory post-war attitude was alienating those who had been neutral, causing a political rift that was preventing alliances needed to actually pass legislation. That the surviving Death Eaters’ imprisonment in Azkaban wouldn’t eradicate their views from society. That the bigots wouldn’t ever be cured of their prejudices. That people were dead and never coming back, and Harry could’ve made better decisions that may have saved them. That Hogwarts and Dumbledore had completely failed to prepare them all—him, especially—for life after the war.
Harry looked around the cafe. "There's a free table next to the veela over there. If you don't mind. You know how no one likes to sit by them."
—but dilation doesn't happen linearly. Impossible to say how much more time it will take."
Harry’s laughter faded into a lazy smile. He loved his friends. They were alive. They were happy enough, weren’t they?
"Yeah."
Draco tipped his head back and laughed.
Harry gets his hand into Draco's trousers and grabs his penis, tugging him closer ("It isn't a
their family now. But something about that realisation hurt as much as it helped, like a finger burning after too long in ice water, cold and hot merging into one sensation. Family was always the thing that Harry wanted most, and he'd never yet gotten it in quite the way he wanted most.
"Oh, piss off." Harry realises that Malfoy's trying to hide a smile. "The Weaselette broke up with you?" He starts to laugh. "That is the funniest fucking thing I've heard in a long time."
"Oh, I don't want to trouble you, Lorraine!" Harry said, wincing—he still had no idea how not to feel awkward about making house-elves do work for him.
Harry's back was to him—muscles flexing under his t-shirt as he washed the breakfast dishes. "You okay?"
"What about this?" Draco started to ask, but then fell silent as a waiter approached the table.
his full-time job. He completely checks out during the bureaucratic nonsense that he's heard over and over, his mind wandering, wondering what the fuck he and Ginny are going to do.
Harry tossed the Floo powder in and called out for Albus's. A moment later, he was met with a view of four legs and a faceful of Salazar the cat.
Harry rubbed at his ears. “What’s going on in here?”
Malfoy looks like he wants to run. Harry can't decide if he wants to help him, or if he wants to watch him crash and burn.
Harry looked down. The material
Draco pretended not to be amused. "You're mocking me, Harry Potter."
Red shoes managed a truly impressive jump.
The door to Harry's office flew open without a knock, and Harry, unthinking, drew his wand as he whirled on his knees towards the door.
"Doesn't matter. And don't pretend to be all stoic," Harry said, voice muffled by the bed. "I know you found that as awful as I did."
Harry panicked, but luckily Draco spoke.
“Well, yes, but also—it would seem like we’re giving tacit approval to the idea that this can be solved privately rather than through the government, which is firmly
Harry's not sure it's
“So what are your plans for after Hogwarts?” Harry asked, just for something to say.
He looks up and finds Ginny looking at him sadly, eyes glistening, hands shoved in the pockets of her cardigan.
He wondered how Harry had done it all; how he'd done any of it.
"We got off track." Draco frowned. "You were asking why I was with you yesterday and then I'm saying this today—it's because I'm a piece of shit. I wanted you too much last night. Just one more time, you know?"
Ron nodded. "True. So he's stalking you?"
It didn't feel real. It actually did feel a bit like an MDMA trip. Draco held on tighter.
Fuck, this was awkward.
?" Scorpius said, spinning to look at Draco.
I hate that he has that effect on me, so I start babbling again. "What do you think Granger and Weasley are doing now? They're not foolhardy enough to try to come back, are they?"
Harry sighs. “Yeah, okay. I have the magical proof here. But I’m telling you, it’s not wrong!”
“Good morning, Harry,” she replied, flipping through the stack of parchments in her arms.
As soon as Jorgen was gone, Harry reached for the Floo powder.
Harry nodded. He took a quick look around the room, double-checking there was no one here he didn't trust. "Honestly, I've known for at least a year that I'm going to get sacked at some point. I don't want to work for Rump at all, of course. But there's some benefit to knowing that
me when we were fifteen."
"I, however," Draco says smugly, "will judge you—what the fuck was that shot, Potter?"
Harry's eyes were on him, pupils wide and dark. "I'm too blissed out to keep teasing you." His head fell to the side. "I don't remember what I was—ah!—saying."
Harry frowned. "I was just joking."
"We can't." Draco sucked in a breath as Harry ground his hips. "Harry, we
“Oh, yes, I did it this afternoon. You can add some pleasantries to it and send it off. I would be happy if we could just pay the salaries, as it’s so much easier than dealing with paperwork.”
Harry closed his eyes, allowing Draco's touch to soothe. "That's what everyone always says. It has to be a lie at least some of the time."
Harry stiffened—Draco never touched him like that. They were really doing this. Harry looked at Hermione—wanting nothing more than to spill his guts about this situation he'd gotten himself into, but he couldn't. The only person he could discuss it with was Draco himself.
"If you ever decide that the hippogriff needs a holiday away from, er, the hand, as it were, I could always help you out." Harry froze. It had sounded rational in his head, until he said it aloud and realised he'd just offered to have sex with Draco Malfoy. Did he
"You're going to love Tetris," Harry says out of the blue, smiling, and Draco kisses him, smiles giving way to insistent lips and roaming, undressing fingers.
Harry was slightly cheered by the fact that Malfoy looked affronted at the accusation of “logical error.”
"He is here. Our time is up." My father extends a hand. He's going to Apparate me away. Or maybe he's going to deliver me to the Dark Lord himself. Maybe he'll kill me himself, in hope of gaining favour. I don't even know anymore.
Harry elbowed Ron. “What the fuck? We said we were going to stay out of this. We can support their schemes without being part of them! I just want one quiet week!”
"Huh?" Harry was still caught up on
Harry didn't say anything, just listened attentively, so Draco kept talking.
"And now I find out it was all
But he couldn't say it to Harry. It was too much. It was too hard; he was eleven years old again, thinking he'd concocted a master plan to get Harry caught in the corridor after dark, but in the end forced to serve detention himself.
Harry was Undesirable No. 1.
Well, it was
That sounds nice. "Me too."
"I don't know. Searching. I can't just sit here—I'll lose it. Dumbledore said magic always leaves a trace. I have no idea what that means, but he put his hands out like this when he was searching for it."
“Fine,” Harry sighs. “Will you put on some music?” Harry stands and walks to the kitchen, and even his walking is odd—gangly, the red Christmas joggers dragging on the floor.
Harry has to turn around to cover his laugh.
life—Harry's life was a lot more than just
Through the pain, we stumble to our feet. Without a word, I sidle behind the screen we made. It's
"No shit," Harry said. "Good for him." He squeezed Draco's hand. They'd both been struggling to be excited for their friends rather than despondent in their own comparative aimlessness.
Draco laughed, but mentally added 'read up on blowjob technique' to his to-do list. He'd have to carefully consider his internet search terms for that one.
Hermione's face was unreadable as she crossed her legs behind her desk, a pile of towering paperwork beside her. "I would've laughed at that."
is reporting." Harry pulled his favourite knife out of the block and sliced lengthwise down the carrot. "How much do Ministers
talk about, under this policy?" Harry handed Draco's phone, the screen of which had long been dark, back to him.
"What?" Harry asks, sitting up and grabbing his wand, war reflexes springing into action. "I'm sorry—did I hurt you?—are you alright?"
The job is done, but the flames are still shooting skyward, dangerously close to the ceiling. Harry wonders idly if enchanted flames set off Muggle smoke detectors.
"Shut up," she says, settling closer to him. "Look around. This flat is ours. This is a place."
"Harry," Malfoy said. "I didn't say that I thought that was bad for you to have a crush on me."
"How about we go to the Rowdy Growler? They show Quidditch in hologram, and we can still whine about the world going to shit. That's what pubs are for."
Harry glared at the mountain of paperwork on his desk, then looked forlornly out the window. It was dark out, and he was grumpy. On top of everything else, he hadn't even seen the sun today. The artificial sunlight that came through the charmed Ministry windows, which were actually underground, didn't count.
For a minute, Harry doesn't say anything. He sips his drink, then looks indistinctly into the distance, his eyes unfocused on the colourful array of bottles behind the bar. This isn't what he thought life would be like, if he ever made it past the war. "I thought it would be better now."
"Thanks, lover," Draco said, and his head disappeared.
," at which a shimmery 37° appeared in the air. Harry turned to Draco, a huge smile on his face, "Did you see that? I am a master at warming charms for bottles."
Potter tilts his head, studying me. "Can I ask you something?"
Scorpius's mouth twisted in a concerned way. "I think we all assume you're going to tell us you're planning to run for Minister in the next election, to prepare us for the press."
Ever since they slept together (the second time), Harry and Draco have been sitting together in their shared classes. It feels like it should feel weirder. Harry feels like it should feel like they're sitting next to each other in the Potions classroom, like the ghost of Snape is going to appear and ask them what they think they're doing.
Harry approached the desk next to Malfoy. "Hey, Malfoy."
. 'Pulled out.'"
“I guess so,” Harry said as Draco buttoned up his pyjama shirt.
," Scorpius said, leaning forward. "We would create it in a totally untraceable way."
"What—what the bloody hell?" Ron asks, looking between the three.
Harry tried to think of something interesting. The most interesting thing he'd been doing lately was reading about Jasper Anderson's space pregnancy, but that didn't seem appropriate for the venue.
Draco shuddered. "He had a way of making everyone around him feel inept, didn't he."
Lorraine, who would have brought tea if she saw Harry in this state, was on her day off. Draco was at work—arguing a case—so he wasn't on his mobile.
Harry stiffened for a moment. This was strange. It felt wrong—James thinking that he was including his dad's lover, but really he was just including his dad's husband-on-paper. He felt like he was lying to James but also like he was lying to himself—because he
Harry leaned back, the oven door handle digging into his lower back. He was still smiling—he simply couldn't stop. "What?!"
Penelope smiled. “Good one. Now let’s brainstorm evidence for and against, and what an alternative thought could be.”
that Rump is an arsehole. He's always
"I'm in love with you." The words were out before Draco could even think about his answer. "Utterly arse over tit. One hundred percent likely to make a fool of myself due to infatuation." Draco slapped a hand over his mouth to stop the verbal emissions, but he was smiling. It was, incongruously, a relief to say it. Then, because they needed to stay on the same footing, "How do
"Well yeah, she helped me get my stuff out of the house. Why, should I have heard from her about something?"
Harry Apparates to his bedroom and puts
"You know what?" Harry said, holding up a hand. "I've decided this is TMI."
Draco's face had turned bright red. An endearing bright red. "You required—thematic adornment."
He looked at the side of the cup, where a quill usually scribbled the contents of the cup, but instead of reading "Caramel Latte," it read,
"I HEARD THE BELLS ON CHRISTMAS DAY!" James sang, Teddy harmonising from down the hall.
“Shut up,” Draco snaps.
"Er, yeah. I guess."
could do some public awareness campaigns, Al," Scorpius offered. "We're pretty famous in our own right, if we choose to use it."
Except Harry never looked like this, back then. Harry at the end of the war was half-starved and scraggle-haired, wearing clothes that didn’t fit and looking like the dangerous, slightly paranoid child-warrior that he was. This Harry doesn’t look like that. He looks healthy, robust, pink-cheeked, happy. And about eighteen. His red Christmas joggers are falling down on his slender hips, the years of treacle tarts and lagers and Shepherds Pie Wednesdays melted away.
The speakers blare "Be My Lover," and Malfoy's head tilts as the crowd around them sings, "La da da dee da da da da."
a million Galleons."
Harry's face breaks into a wide smile. "I disagree. It's very important."
Draco laughed, looking over his shoulder for his son. Scorpius was sitting in front of the fireplace, charming fairy lights into James's and Albus's hair. "Quite right. He always made it festive, even when I didn't have…" He gestured at the mess of flour and sugar covering the kitchen, "structured Christmas activities for us."
Ginny collapses into her desk chair, her head dropping to the desk as she softly bangs her forehead against the wood. "This cannot be happening."
"Holy shit," Harry said, reading it through a second time. "Can we even speak publicly to educate? We have all these programs…" He trailed off.
“The department has been asked to contribute four people to sit on the committee. Granger, Malfoy”—Harry held his breath—“Rogers, Goff.” Harry sighed in relief. Rogers and Goff were two veteran Aurors who wore exclusively traditionalist wizarding clothing. “What that means is, if you’re wearing some bullshit clothes right now, get out of here, and don’t come back until you’re dressed in a minimally reasonable way. Come back dressed as if it was a few weeks ago and we’d never discussed a dress code. I’m not saying anything else, or you’ll twist my words around and make me into some kind of bigot. I’ve seen more of Potter’s arse cheeks than I ever needed to, but that doesn’t make me a bigot. Now get out of here!”
"Maybe I'll Floo Lily and see if she can come over."
Harry froze.
"Shut up," Draco instructed, but he was grinning. "I'll take that back then." He reached for the book.
Draco sighed, looking at Aster. "Because he's an evil fucking devilman?"
Harry forced his imaginings back to the task at hand, and before he knew it, his columns were finally filled in. He smiled. He would be able to show Penelope that he’d actually finished something.
"I can't see us deciding to come clean on our own unless we were engaged and having a press release or something," Harry said, thinking. "But I am pretty impulsive, and I am known to rile you up, so I can also imagine us accidentally spilling the beans."
“No, today we’re here to discuss strategies to interrupt the path of negative, unhelpful thoughts,” Penelope continued before they could object further. “You are both smart people—”
"I like it!" Malfoy huffed. "It's good for digestion, and it makes me energetic."
"Yes, and I bet the drink you ordered has about forty grams of sugar, and I'm judging you accordingly."
but resigned?" Albus asked, looking to Scorpius for his input.
An otherworldly, ethereal tone sounded, and when Harry turned around; Wilhelm had pulled out a little saw and was playing it with a bow.
"What I really want for the dining area," James said, joining them at the large table and popping an Every Flavor Bean in his mouth, "is one of those lighting fixtures that looks kind of menacing, like it could fall from the ceiling and impale someone or trap them in its bars. Do you know the kind I mean? I feel like that would be wicked."
sure we can do it."
was that good? Why did that make Draco suck in shaky breath? Because people had all sorts of strange bits to them, and when you were with someone, you came up against all those strange parts? Because having sex was a bit like wanting to leave one's own skin in favour of a communal skin made of pleasure and connection?
Harry didn't find much time for pleasure reading, honestly. Some
to talk about it!" Harry sounds petulant even to himself.
Harry nodded and headed over to the kitchen, Draco following behind.
Harry shrugged. "It's just my life. It died down ages ago, thank goodness. I guess the appeal of banging the Saviour lessens with age." Draco's face was inscrutable. "I can't let it stop me from living my life, you know? Hermione also put a bezoar into a special pocket in my wallet, just in case. I should probably show you where that is, because it's people around me who are lucid enough to intervene, in the worst case scenarios."
She exhales shakily. "I found a therapist."
"Oh for the love of…"
Maybe we'd always have got along swimmingly, if only we'd both been defeated, resigned.
Draco done? He'd told Harry that he is moving on, that he is wanted—only maybe not in the ways Harry had anticipated. He'd said that he wanted Harry, and that Harry isn't the only person who has issues with their parents.
Oh. The Circadian Charm wasn’t safe to cast at oneself. Something about the danger of falling asleep as you were casting. No one but Ginny had ever cast it on Harry. “Oh. Er, sure. Thanks.”
"Gin, I'm not worried about that. I...I get it, he..he has at least
Harry grinned at him. "Thanks Colin!"
"So this is your game, sabotage the potion and hurt me somehow, well you won't win." Draco huffed, turning back and adding the ginger root. As he stirred, the potion turned lime green, and Draco turned back to the desk, totally to get the armadillo bile and not to look at Potter's face.
Draco nodded, but for the first time since they began, his heart wasn't fully in it.
Harry shrugged. "What do you mean?"
Draco carefully freed his arms, allowing Harry to scooch closer. Luckily, he was right handed, so he could continue work as his left arm wrapped around Harry. He put his quill down, though, in order to turn and place a soft kiss to Harry's head. He wasn't risking any more thoughts of rejection, not after what happened last time. "Hello there, Harry."
clear where he stood on that but...this was certainly a change.
After a few hours, he heard the door unlock and someone come inside. He heard two voices through the fog in his mind, then he felt Pansy's hand in his hair and smelled Blaise's cologne as he lifted Draco up and carried him to bed.
Harry closed his eyes, shaking. Before Draco could stop himself, he was leaning across the table, kissing Harry softly. Harry kissed back, chasing Draco's lips as Draco pulled away. Harry's eyes opened, slowly, and he looked at the vial. He picked it up and knocked it back in one go.
, I've been avoiding all of them-"
"Draco, if...if something happens to me tomorrow-"
They made their way, carefully, into Dumbledore's office and Harry tried not to be too worried by how Dumbledore leaned on him more and more with each step. Harry hadn't even been able to get Dumbledore to his desk, reaching only the window by the ramparts before the stairs started creaking. Someone was coming.
Draco scoffed. "Me? I'm perfect, never felt better."
He didn't even know what he'd say. Maybe he'd plead for Draco to put down his wand, that they would save his parents, that he didn't have to
"I know." Draco cupped Harry's face. "But I can say that you are an amazing wizard and you will be with Dumbledore. And
" Hit with a wave of irritation, he walked out of the common room, heading to the Great Hall for breakfast. Most people were already there so the halls were empty. It made bumping into Draco all the more surprising, but hey, Harry was going to take it.
"I never said that you-"
"Nothing will happen to you, Harry."
"You want to know what's wrong?" Blaise had
"Well I don't see Ron still pining over Romilda Vane. Though honestly, I can't see anyone pining over her even
Draco looked him up and down, his sneer only growing, then he stepped around Harry and walked away.
bloody
an idiot, darling."
Still, he did,
Weasley finally caught his breath. "Don't think this changes anything, Malfoy. I still think you're a pureblood supremacist prat."
"I'm telling you Harry, if it's anything-"
, and they were on different sides.
"I feel like these books," Weasley set down his stack, "are what we're looking for."
Something in that seemed to sting Harry, and he looked away. Granger immediately looked apologetic but before she could stammer out an apology he was gone, with one last look at Draco. Fuck, Draco would face a thousand Grangers for Harry to look at him like that again, with love and longing.
, smiling softly at her. "How about you go save a spot for us, darling?"
, Draco never spoke like that.
Blaise gagged as Draco and Pansy laughed, and the three made their way into the Potions room.
had looked when Draco had rejected him. Hopefully his brain would stop providing him the memory, he really could do without the guilt tripping, thank you very much.
Draco was silent. A few long seconds passed, and then he spoke, with a quiet voice. "About?"
"-foy.
Granger's look changed, from accusing to appraising. "You...really don't know."
to see Parkinson being held by Draco, lava bubbling in his chest, scorching his lungs and heart.
" Right before he saw Dumbledore's wand flying end over end over the castle wall, glinting a sickly green by the light of the Dark Mark, Harry felt his every muscle freeze, as if he'd become a marble statue. He couldn't move or speak, he could only breathe and observe, helpless.
Besides, to sabotage now would be to break Granger's trust. As he turned that first right, he wondered when the trust of Hermione Granger had begun to mean something for him.
Fuck. Just as he'd been about to tell Draco...would it be fair to say anything about his feelings if death was imminent? Assuming Draco took him back, which he highly doubted considering the way he'd been treating Draco since they….split, would it be fair to him to give that false hope and tear it away in just a day?
Draco seemed to be steeling his nerves, but then suddenly Dumbledore flicked two of his fingers and a book came hurtling off the shelves. It hit Draco and in a flash, neither the book nor Draco were present.
"Harry, I understand if you hate me, it's-"
Harry was talking and Draco was, like a lovesick
"Hermione-"
Colin looked surprised. "You aren't....irritated with me?"
Harry nodded. "Still I should go talk to them like, right now, I can't wait-"
“I’d asked the headmaster how they would get in.” Draco was half addressing the group, half talking to himself.  ”He told me to tell them that I had the information that tomorrow night the apparition shields would be lowered and he would be weakened. Logically, they’d only send four, maybe five, at max seven people.”
Hermione and Ron shared a look, and Ron looked rather awkward. Well, more awkward than usual. "Malfoy….Harry's been looking at you a lot lately. He's...convinced you have a Dark Mark and that you're working for..."
, you get back to the common room." Harry reluctantly let go of Draco, pressing a kiss to Draco's forehead. Draco couldn't help but lean into it for comfort, mortified and terrified as he was.
"Hang on, Harry." Luna came closer, brushing the grass out of Harry's hair. "Grass in the hair has some incredible properties but people don't seem to like that here for some reason."
"No, Draco, I physically
But why would Draco care about a Vanishing Cabinet? Its only purpose was to…
"What do you want, Weasley?" Draco looked at Ginny coolly. When he saw her nostrils flare, he tilted his head. To anyone else it would look like simply a shift in posture, but Ginny followed the movement and saw the people that Draco was indicating. She visibly calmed and nodded, and Draco sighed in relief internally.
Granger sighed. "I won't hurt him, Harry, I promise. And you know I
"So I have to go to Grimmauld Place." Harry's voice was all but silent, but it was clear in the quiet of the common room. Most people, especially Gryffindors, had been pulled out of school ever since Dumbledore had died. The common rooms were more often than not abandoned, which was a blessing but also terrifying to see.
Harry huffed. "Just a walk to the Great Lake, I'm not a child, you two!"
On the other side, Luna did the same. "Oh look at that cloud, it looks like a Wrackspurt."
. It was a seventh year Ravenclaw, who hadn't had the chance to put their wand away before they'd been caught in whatever spell Harry had cast. They were so clearly in agony, but unlike everyone else they were immobilised, their wand still out and arm still pointing in the direction of Harry and Draco.
weird but passionate weekend with Blaise. It wasn't the best, but it was the only option that they had.
"Good luck, Harry!" Luna gave him one last smile then turned to gaze at the lake, her usual dreamy expression drifting across her face.
Ron got up, but not before giving Harry a knowing look. Harry...blushed, which Draco found odd. What did they know that Draco didn’t?
Draco was a weak,
thing the Patil twins introduced him to. He has a bit at almost every meal."
Ron looked at them quizzically. “What’s a vaccine?”
"Hey Draco!" Harry grinned. He noticed that Draco had his friends with him, Parkinson and Zabini, but they seemed to be not as...venomous as they usually were. Draco also had his….arm around Parkinson's waist.
"Po-Harry," Draco amended when he saw Potter deflate. Why did he even care? Well, he'd said it and there was no turning back, besides, this gave him new outlets to tease Potter with when he figured out what the hell was going on. "you are quite literally
When Harry looked back at him, Draco felt like he was back in that classroom. There was the same warmth, the same care, the same….love. The world seemed to melt away around them, Draco could only focus on Harry and as Harry stepped closer, Draco felt his breath quicken.
Pansy snorted. "I'll put your name in the pool then."
"Dracooooooo." Harry pouted. Maybe he
While Blaise and Pansy moved, Granger and the Weasel had gone straight to Snape and were arguing with him in hushed tones. Draco moved to the front of the classroom to get the ingredients for today's potions. The fact that he could do it later or send Potter to do it was irrelevant, as was the fact that now he could listen in on what they were saying. Still, he only got snippets of the conversation.
Harry, though, was laughing and reaching for his phone to snap a picture. “Draco. Look at me. Smile!”
Harry nodded in agreement. "Fuck them
"I am not!" Harry held the book in his far hand and stretched it out of Draco's reach. "I have a very good imagination."
A few hours later, Hermione turns from where she's sitting on the sofa and says in a too-casual voice, "So, Malfoy. You're learning about video games for a class? Let me ask you something. A lot of games include women as damsels in distress, or as rewards, or as sexualised non-playable characters. Or they include women whose sexuality is dangerous, like a trap.
"The problem is that this is a feminist issue and I don't want to make it seem like I care only about cis women."
"But why would video games include women as non-playable characters?" Malfoy asks Hermione, and the two of them are off—launching into deep discussion about stereotypes in media.
?! But the other part of Harry clenched with sadness—was that what Draco's marriage had been like? For all Harry and Ginny had fought, it had never been a
Harry's head whipped to the side to see Malfoy sitting there, looking at him. Malfoy wasn't smirking or teasing or revelling in his superiority.
Harry sighed. He'd been looking for almost an hour. Well, no. He kept getting interrupted. He'd had a call from James, asking how to repair a problem with his wards. Then he'd been Flooed by Jorgen about an important memo that had landed on Harry's desk (on a bloody Saturday morning). Then Lily'd had a question about broom insurance. Harry wouldn't say no to his child, despite the fact that there was little he hated more than insurance paperwork.
"Ugh, I know, Gin, I—"
“Oh, don’t give me that. I don’t care to retroactively psychoanalyse my teenage self. Was it you I was attracted to, or was it what you stood for in the war? Was it that you were fit, or that I wanted to be the type of person who could be with you?” Draco smiles sadly. “I don’t know. All of the above?”
Harry bursts out laughing, imagining Draco Malfoy trying to retrofit a Muggle flat to run entirely on magic.
"Er," Harry stammered, "of course, we can discuss
When he gets home from class, he's not sure how to feel. Nervous? But he knows most of the people who are coming. The only people he doesn't know are Hermione's new law classmates, and whoever comes along as a guest.
Hermione reached an arm around Ron’s shoulders and squeezed.
Draco put the cheese on a board and went searching for a knife. He raised an eyebrow in Harry's direction. "Are you sure you won't end up martyring yourself? If Albus and Scorpius are Slytherin about it, they might manipulate your Saviour inclinations."
“Did it work?” Malfoy asked.
"I'm therefore checking that you actually want to do this. Because you did say that. And we still have to see each other in class or whatever. And we're not drunk. This isn't like last time. This is rather, well, premeditated. Yes?"
"Whoa," Hermione says.
Harry nudged Draco’s leg with his foot. “Then why are you always awake before me?”
"Are you hungry?" she asks eventually.
Is it too late to renege?
Harry yanked, trying to pull away, when the children's stifled laughter reached his ears. He turned towards them. "What did you do."
Harry was overcome with a desire to comfort and reached up to awkwardly pat Draco’s arm.
Harry blinked. His child—his
“Scorpius was only ever naked in the bath.”
"He's funny."
"Harry! What does your participation in this protest mean? Has the Minister lost your support?"
Potter rolls his eyes. "Why do you hate me so much, anyway? I mean, we're about to die. Might as well lay it all out."
Harry tugged their clasped hands. "And that isn't a bad thing! Not all bad, anyway. And I'm not so self-sacrificing that I would've agreed to marry you if I hated you. I didn't! I knew it'd be okay. I'm an adult and I made a decision. And I don't regret it."
"You just don't want them to know how prudish you are, refusing to snog in the Ministry loo. We're young. Vital!"
Harry's spiraling, he can feel it, but he doesn't know how to stop it.
Draco, uneasy, put his hand on the small of Harry's back and nudged him towards the sitting room.
“Are there any special dressing guidelines for the zoo?” Draco asked, looking into his wardrobe. He had already pushed through his early morning profanity and had wrapped himself in a dressing gown.
Harry ignored him and took another bite of his burger. "We don't have to move in together yet, do we?"
"I don't know," Malfoy says dismissively, "some kind of bullshit course they make all first-year students take."
Harry leaned back on his desk, taken aback. Since when did Draco ask Harry's opinion on career moves? What was he even supposed to say to that? He decided to fall back on his tried and true parenting technique of just echoing back whatever was said to him. "Er, sounds like you're considering it. What do
"Er, a wall?"
Harry stuck out his tongue. "I appreciate it, honestly. I mean, I'm on Veritaserum, so you know I'm not lying. But the things that have constrained my choices—they made me who I am. There's no 'true Harry' underneath it all that I could somehow excavate. This
Malfoy squirms and adjusts his Tommy Hilfiger jumper. "But didn't you grow up with Muggles? Aren't these your people? I need
“No, I have not. Did Lorraine answer the door? Yes, she did. Did I have to Obliviate the delivery person? Yes, I did.” He narrowed his eyes. “Don’t arrest me, Auror Potter.”
Harry held up his hand, the back of which read
"You're an arsehole." Harry lets his head fall drunk-swimmingly to the side to look at him.
Draco's face creased in confusion, and Harry couldn't help but laugh with delight as he searched for where to stream the movie.
Harry doesn't think; he only does what his instinct tells him to, which is apparently to rise up and back on his knees and lower his mouth to Draco Malfoy's penis, opening his mouth to fit around it, feeling a little awkward-sloppy, but not caring at all because his
The International Confederation of Wizards was not exactly the type of organisation Harry enjoyed thinking about, or Merlin forbid, being asked to testify in front of. It was bureaucratic, ceremonial, and pretty much all talk, no action. It was like a Ravenclaw's wet dream, sitting around debating international unity while never actually fucking doing anything.
He wondered what Draco would be wearing today. Maybe he'd wear some kind of Muggle skirt suit. Harry thought that might be a good choice for Draco, especially combined with his strong shoulders. Harry'd always had a thing for people with strong shoulders. He suspected it was related to Quidditch.
"Well, we can do that tomorrow, after lunch, if you want. I think they'd have a disco ball at that market we went to last weekend, remember?"
"We are, if it's escaped your notice, both men," Draco answered, raising one eyebrow. "Garter belts aren't traditional."
A week later at breakfast, Harry, leaning against the pantry, flashed Draco an arms-crossed, searching look. "Why aren't you happier about it?"
Draco shoved, hard, and Harry dissolved into giggles as he dodged Draco's hands. Draco considered tickling him, or pinning him down—he would, another time, another day—but he was too depleted just now. He'd rather not move.
," Albus corrected. "And yes, we're excellent at it."
, I think. "Do I
Harry hums his agreement. He's felt like shit for months. "Want me to get you a potion or something?"
"I am going to be excellent at this, Potter," Malfoy says as Harry struggles with the Muggle lock they use in addition to their wards. "I am a country gentlewizard; excelling at shooting fowl is in my nature."
have an incentive to make sure no one's becoming the next Dark Lord on their sickle."
Harry shrugged, remembering Draco sitting at the table talking about how it wasn't a lie that they were family. "Isn't it, though? I mean, you build it. If you didn't work together, it wouldn't work. But if it does—you keep building."
Harry looked away when he saw their sad, understanding smiles.
Ginny jumps up. "I am not your mother, Harry Potter. We are not your parents."
Someone from across the park screamed, "You can't even land a 180, you fucking wanker, don't try me!"
Harry shrugged. "I felt like it."
"Congratulations," Draco said, dripping with sarcasm.
“Shut up,” Draco says, failing to hold in a laugh. “Or I
"Do they still have the—" Draco started to ask, but his mouth clacked shut before he could finish his question.
“Mister Potter,” she enthused, “welcome! Tell me why the public should care about the Ministry’s new dress code.”
, they didn't grumble about it too much.
to talk to just Al.
"No. Sorry. I'm just complaining."
Last July they'd all gone to the London Pride parade. Harry had tried to go in his usual clothes—a pair of jeans and a Queen t-shirt. He'd figured that the Queen t-shirt was basically bi pride merch, anyway.
"Oh shut up," Harry said, laughing. "You're just jealous because you don't have time to read books for fun. You can join us, you know. If you make time for us, Jorgen would be thrilled. I think he fancies you."
"Nursery rhyme," Harry said. "Nevermind. How are you?"
Everyone sort of slowly turned to look at her, tilting their heads to accommodate her upside-downness.
George answers in the middle of talking to someone in the sitting room. He briefly pauses, smiles, says, "Hey Haz. Why did you knock, mate?" and disappears, talking about Shrivelfigs. There's an unidentifiable whirring noise. He steps inside with the odd feeling that this is what home used to feel like.
"A magical therapist?" Harry knows that the problem is that Muggle therapists can't be told the details of what happened to Hermione's parents, while the magical world is behind, where psychotherapy is concerned.
As they left the room, Harry asked curiously, “Do you actually think all jobs are crap, or did you just feel like arguing?”
Harry stared at him for a moment. "Is this how Slytherins lie so well? By lying so hard they convince themselves, too?"
Penelope nodded. "True. Imagination isn't concerned with principles and prudence, is it?" She paused, and when Malfoy didn't elaborate, she continued, "Do you think that means we suppress our imaginations because they might open us up to disappointment?"
Malfoy dropped into the chair next to Harry's. "Did you just admit you have a crush on me?"
"In any case," Penelope said, "you don't need a potion for that kind of imagination—the potion only increases the capacity you already have. You can do it, and it'll get easier the more you do it. Alright, moving on, I have some handouts for you."
"Here's how it works," Scorpius said. "I ask a question that starts with 'who…', and to answer, you raise that person's shoe."
"What's really bothering you?"
I turn away, hoping the dim light doesn't reveal the flush on my cheeks.
“Is this a place people only come with children?” Draco asked, looking around. “I feel ancient.”
At some point, things dying down, a hand on Harry's elbow. "Come on, upstairs, Harry!" Teddy's voice.
Harry smiled. “What about you, Mi?”
I hoist myself up, ready to explain the function of some standard household magic or something. But Potter is frowning at a blank stretch of stone wall.
And it's better if we discuss it now, when it's theoretical, rather than later, when it's…imminent."
Harry shook his head, laughing, and took a bite of the quiche. It was delicious, cheesy and spinachy. "Mmm," he said, gesturing. "The quiche is good."
"Certainly is," Draco said. Then he frowned. "But you're not allowed to say that, because you're meant to be newly in love and commensurately smitten, so the world can't be all bad."
I turn away. I don't want to make him feel worse, but I don't know how to interact with him without being hurtful.
"Oh, it was awful," Draco confirmed. Then he had a terrible thought. "At least Scorpius didn't tell my mother."
” Draco gasps. “And I’m not old!”
"Sorry," I say, in a tone that fails to connote contrition, "I'm stuck in a cellar with a corpse, about to die. One must take one's jollies where one can."
, I should say, because what, may I ask, the
The goblin waved his hand, and a moment later another goblin trotted towards the entrance. "Harry Potter," the second goblin said. "Enter, Potter, but take heed—"
"You've made my doppelganger look like the lovechild of Umbridge and a Blast-Ended Screwt."
"You were not! I distinctly saw you reaching for the pepper."
"Are you fucking with me?"
Harry was tired of this. He was tired of waking up feeling guilty for having dreams about someone who was supposed to be his friend. He was tired of fancying a bloke but not doing anything about it, like he was in third year or something. He was beyond tired of thinking that going for something with Draco was something he Should Not Do.
Harry grinned. "You don't say."
Most Eligible Wizard, I am one of the worst catches in England."

Draco nodded and grabbed the paper and pen, writing "ICW/MMM" in his neat handwriting atop the back.
mum has a flower name, too, Harold."
"Er?"
Harry sets his wand on the counter. "I have never felt more like a piece of shit in my entire life."
"Seriously, listen," Albus said, his mouth full of mashed potatoes. "We start a page on social media geared towards Gen Z. We make some graphics telling people how they can resist Rump."
"You know what, Malfoy, go ahead. You have my consent. Go ahead! Do it! Find out whatever it is you wanted to know. What are you, chicken?"
Hermione lights up. "Like choose-your-own-adventure!"
Draco's head dropped to the side, his cheek pressing against Harry's head. "Oh. Okay.
Harry rearranged Aster on his lap. "Can I explain? Because—"

Draco pushed himself backward, off the bed and onto his knees. "I'm going to suck you off now," he interrupted, his frank words at odds with his dramatic hyperbole of moments ago. "Unless you have any objections."
"Spell a sock onto the doorknob?"
As the conversation went on, more and more heads turned in their direction.
"I'll drink to that," Draco said, holding up his butterbeer for a toast.
Harry’s heart swelled with fondness.
, exactly. Not yet. But they're together, and they support each other. They're family
Harry sighed. He hated these sorts of decisions. “Is it possible to just secretly bankroll their salaries? Or is that, you know, illegal?”
Harry pulled away, jolted out of his musings by James's thrilled smile.
"We might be able to have lovers sign a non-disclosure agreement, tell them we have an open marriage but that it can't leak to the public."
My eyes sting. Curse my blasted

Harry understood the dangerous tendencies of law enforcement better than most. He had worked at the DMLE for over thirty years, but his job had never made him numb to the dangers of the profession.
Hermione smiled. “I used to always imagine the worlds of the books I read. That I would do well in school, get an impressive job, make my parents proud. That I had lots of friends who always wanted to play with me—but not dolls, I didn’t like dolls. I imagined falling in love, too, I guess.”
"And then he placed his order and he ordered 'the usual.' Who does that?"
Scorpius, delighted, gasped audibly. "Think of the headlines!" His smile
Harry stared for a moment, assuming she would address the wooly mammoth in the room. She didn’t.
"Babies don't need toys, you know," Albus added. "It's a capitalist scam."
the broom they rode in on."
Harry sighs. "Yes, I know. She didn't do anything wrong. Obviously I'm glad she had the choice. It's just—I thought we had a different kind of relationship, where we'd talk to each other."
Harry's eyes twinkle with a challenge. They both know he'll hang it.
"What?" Draco asked, standing and making his way to the kitchen. He opened the cabinet with the cheese charms—evidently he thought cheese was the appropriate way to celebrate a birth. "Do you fancy a white Stilton?"
"I've been trying!" Malfoy said, his voice raising enough that the wizard in front of them, who was wearing head-to-toe leopard print, turned around to glare at them. "I've been trying," Malfoy repeated more quietly. "I've been trying to ignore you since the fucking war. No, since year six."
Harry sighed. "They can't. They give her these potions that can vanish the endometrial tissue, but they can only do that in the office, and they can't make it stop coming back."
Draco's thighs were starting to ache. "Let's flip?"
Harry squeezed it. "Sexually," he confirmed, trying not to form a mental image of it. It was the first time in his life he'd ever lied about having had sex with someone. All those times during adolescence when the other boys were claiming all sorts of apocryphal conquests, Harry never joined in. He couldn't believe he was breaking his streak now, at age fifty-five.
Harry's mouth tugged into an amused grin. "Is the womb a

I sit back on my ankles. "You know what, Potter? Fuck you. Fuck.
“So what was it like?” Hermione asked, leaning back against a tower of pillows.
Malfoy bristled. "Yes. I think yes, I do exactly that, and it's
.” His face dropped a bit, though, as he added, “But yes. It does, doesn’t it.”
"Oh, definitely," Hermione says. "But the dance! It's mesmerising. Do you think we could learn it?"
Albus slid an arm around Scorpius. Draco's mouth twisted into a displeased expression. Harry sighed. A small part of him had thought something would intervene before Rump
They were much subdued compared to yesterday, Harry noticed, but were definitely breaking the dress code. Hermione wore a low-cut shirt that showed a sea of cleavage and bra straps. She wore no makeup, and her hair was a wild mane. She wore a short skirt and tall boots.
Harry followed.
Harry frowned. “Can you say something that actually addresses what I just said?”
Scorpius attempted a smile. "Nico, I'm sure we can find a way for you to help!"
“Phase One is complete,” Hermione said as she slid into a booth at the pub and took a long sip of lager.
Somehow, Harry is, though. He doesn't envy any of it. "You know the saying: wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy."
"You don't mean 'we,'" Malfoy pointed out, and Harry rolled his eyes even though he privately agreed. "You don't actually include yourself in that statement."
of dating.
But Potter jets out from behind the screen, holding the chain tight in one hand and lunging towards me, extending his other hand.
Harry didn’t know what to think, so he watched Malfoy complete their assignment.
Harry selected sugary sweets for himself and his side of the family, and they began the walk back. "I'm so glad they added Muggle sweets to these cabinets," Harry said, tearing open a pack of Percy Pigs. "I love a Chocolate Frog, but none of the magical gummy sweets are as good as these."
"Dad," Albus interrupted, "if you make a joke about Draco being able to help with your work because he's also
shiny.
“Perhaps it’s the stuffy pure blood,” Draco mused. “A genetic disinclination to fun and joie de vivre.”
Hermione turned, hand over her mouth. "The horror!"
“Because my dickbag job makes me get out of my beautiful bed and I’m a responsible, redeemed person who works hard, for some reason I’ve forgotten right now.”
With a small shout of "Timber!", Wilhelm emerged from his little wooden cottage and swung at the tree. "Harry, mate, the Ministerial Vow starts in ten on the WWN."
Andromeda looks tired, though she smiles at Harry as she tells him to come in. She's got Teddy strapped to her chest with some sort of wrap, which she starts untying so she can hand Teddy to Harry.
“Harry James Potter, to testify on behalf of the accused.”
"You can't come in here, looking like
He was wearing one of his usual shirts and ties on the top, neatly tucked into a purple miniskirt that Harry vaguely remembered seeing on Hermione that time they went dancing at The Mirage. His legs were bare and covered with blond hair, and Harry couldn’t decide what would be more unusual—if Draco had shaved and donned pantyhose, or if he left them in their natural state. Because Harry was really not prepared to look at Draco’s bare legs—his thighs, knees, and calves on display.
Hermione’s eyes widened, and Harry immediately felt bad, but also still annoyed at her for overwhelming him. She knew how easily Harry was overwhelmed these days.
"A chain of magic? What does that mean? Like, causal links of spells?"
One of the witches looked up. "Thanks!" she said, then waved her wand to add the letters to the squares.
"It was fine." It was a cop-out answer, really, but it was the truth. It had been fine.
We sit in silence for a long time. I wonder what things Potter would do differently. From my perspective, he always does everything right. Saves the world every June, it seems. Everyone adores him. I'm the one who fucks up every decision. And yet, he seems just as fucked up as me. There's something simultaneously encouraging and awful about that.
Draco laughed, loud and carefree, as they walked up the steps to their house. Harry went first, and Draco slid his pinky finger into Harry's coat pocket, hooking him closer as they approached the door. Draco stuck out his tongue at the lion door knocker Harry had installed and watched with satisfaction as it made a silent, playful roar in response.
Draco opened his mouth to say
There was something in Draco's face—something anxious—that made Harry pause. "Are you sure? Your room is way better."
, firm, and Harry moaned, long and low, over him, sucking in a breath, hips switching abruptly from a slam to a fluid roll as he breathed his pleasure into Draco's skin, then collapsed heavily atop him.
Aster started squirming the second she heard Scorpius's voice.
"It's true, isn't it? Curse-breakers usually work alone, even though it's really dangerous. Or do you not know what a lone ranger is? It was originally some kinda Muggle show, I think."
for that. We only seemed 'grown-up' because we were veterans, Lil. You know that. That's not what we would ever want for you. But really, what's all this talk? Usually you know exactly what you want from life and let no one else question it."
"Me too."
But Harry frowned, because that wasn't really true anymore, was it? Though he certainly did make fun of Draco's hair care products on a regular basis, so at least there was that.
He's not sure how long he lies there, wallowing. He has a vague sense that he's being pathetic, and that he should feel bad for running out on Draco, and on Hermione, but he doesn't have enough energy to fully admit any of that to himself right now.
"Lils," Harry sighed, "you're not allowed to say
Harry's spent a lot of time in this bed in the past couple months, and he knows the ceiling quite well. He knows it from studying the fading stars while trying to stave off a too-soon orgasm. He knows it from insomnia. He knows it from looking away, unsure why he isn't happier, why he isn't looking at Ginny's beautiful face as she sleeps peacefully next to him.
"It's roughly as you'd expect, I reckon," Wilhelm informed. "Vance is upset because he thinks they'll lose funding."
"Yeah," Harry says, tilting his head assessingly. "Did you think I was going to like, get back with her, or something?"
There was a thud as Jorgen pulled the clock off the wall and made to put it into Harry's bag.
Malfoy's face lit up momentarily, then fell when he realised Harry was only joking.
"I've been homebrewing. In my castle, so, castle-brewed. And I want to sell them, but Uncle Bill said I can't sell food without being registered as a business and I can't do that without a business plan, hence…"
He pulls out his mobile. He opens the contacts, presses the down button until he gets to Draco Malfoy, presses call.
"It's not fair that the adults always keep the truth from me, like I can't handle it."
"No, seriously, I have to say this." He fiddles with his ugly trousers again. "I didn't know the spell would do that. I'm really sorry."
"It's a lifestyle, Harry, not a diet."
"The potion does what you’d imagine," Slughorn explained, "enhances the drinker’s imagination. It does not affect logic, knowledge, wishes, desires, or any of the mechanisms of the mind that lead to mental illness. All it will do is enhance your imagination."
Draco flopped onto the sofa. "What even is a 'relationship'?" he asked, raising his hands to trace air quotes.
Harry grins widely, hands out to the side, and says, “Well? Did it work?”
For a moment, it seems like there will be a burst of magic, but it abruptly goes dark, and Potter sinks to his knees, tilting sideways until his shoulder hits the wall.
"Mmmm?"
There was also a text from Draco: "Lunch to discuss details? I made us a reservation at the Gilded Thistle at noon, but can change it if need be. Dress for business, please, as we need to discuss slow implementation of our business plan."
"Yes," Harry said, affecting a serious tone, "it's part of how to keep the romance alive. I'm an expert at it."
"What’s in there that I don't already know?" Malfoy challenged.
Harry thinks of everything he knows about abortion, which is mostly from Muggle media: movies where characters debate endlessly about what to do, almost get an abortion, and then, at the last second, decide that they can't go through with it, and end up a happy, loving family. That's what's supposed to happen. That's the script.
What can possibly be sensitive about a treatment for hiccoughs?
You could almost
, that was how short they were. "Draco, what the hell!"
Harry arched, looking up at the ceiling—which he and Draco had spelled last month to mimic the night sky, like Harry's bedroom in his old house. He glimpsed the stars, closed his eyes, and smiled.
"I used to get panic attacks last year," Draco says, voice quiet. "If anyone but my mother saw…" He trails off.
involvement with Hogwarts. There's the Board of Governors, of course, and some regulations mandated by the Minimally Competent Students Committee. But for the most part, Ministers are not involved at all." Draco winced. "With notable exception circa 1995, of course."
Harry can feel Draco working to dismantle the shield, but Harry didn't spend a year on the run for nothing—he's essentially warded himself. Draco's magic is making a dent, but it's slow-going. "I bet I can finish the pie before you break through."
Draco looked up, and Harry found himself staring. Draco was pushing his hair off his face and looking at Harry in such an open way—not acting strange because Harry was the Saviour, not expecting Harry to have magical ability to fix things because he killed Voldemort, just seeing Harry for who he was and being willing to do the work together. Harry felt a flush rise from his chest and up his neck. He hadn't known that Draco knew so much about Lily.
"Tell me, Potter," Rump began, "in Magical Britain, are law enforcement or Ministry officials above the law?"
"Don't go outside without asking!" Bill called after them. "Have a seat, Harry. Fleur just made a pot of coffee."
"Er, no. Just write it on the back of this and we can fold it again."
Harry frowned at the carrots, which were now in a neat pile of sticks, ready to be diced. "Cut the carrots? Because they'd be hard to chew in the pie if I left them whole?"
"Let's just like, do the best we can, and then arrange them like they're sleeping. Facing away. Hope no one gets a close look."
"Har har har," Harry said, though he
“I will never forgive you for that,” Draco said, hair a mess, cheeks pink, after they finally got outside. “I barely escaped with my life.” He rubbed his lip, then stuck his tongue out surreptitiously as if testing whether he tasted of tropical fruit.
, Harry." He looked into his tea. "I never have." Harry didn't respond, so Draco, unwilling to endure the silence, kept talking. "In school, like in fourth or fifth year maybe, I used to give myself pep talks about how to avoid getting into it with you. Snape was livid at me for losing house points because of you; my father was furious that I was being public with my animosities. I
"I just got off with them," Harry said, gesturing towards the fire and standing with a groan. He looked at Draco—pink cheeks, sparkle in his grey eyes. "You bought something for her, didn't you?"
Harry, amazed at Draco’s equanimity, watched as Draco took a deep breath, tucked his long hair behind his ears, and opened the letter. At his touch, it flew out of his fingers into the air. It didn’t shout—it merely magnified Lucius’s terrifying hiss by a few dozen decibels.
Draco hitched his shoulder in a shrug. “Well, I’m sorry your literal arse is going to be all over the papers, though I suppose it’s not the first time. And we appreciate your help in advocating for the cause.”
Harry and Malfoy both opened their mouths to object—Harry wondered exactly how Malfoy planned to argue that Voldemort’s death did not count as evidence for the hopefulness of wizarding politics—but Penelope stopped them. “No, this isn’t an argument. We’re not in law school. It’s a simple statement. How about ‘data show young people are less likely to tolerate blood prejudice’?”
"This is exactly the problem, Dad!" Albus snapped. "Everyone in your generation thinks they're incapable of solving the problem. You two are both influential people, you know that. Don't pretend you don't have power."
Oh, that—making Malfoy blush and calling his flirtatious bluff—that was good. Harry grinned, and found he wanted to make that blush happen again. Catching Malfoy off guard was good. "What do you get off on, Malfoy? At work, of course."
Draco’s bedroom looked no different, which had Harry wondering where all his things were. He started opening drawers and wardrobes at random, and found that Lorraine had somehow split the space evenly. Probably through the generous use of magical space.
"What are you—"
claim that Jorgen fancied Harry. He didn't voice that thought aloud. "You
Oh. That's how they found out. Scorpius overheard them talking about—about what? About the dissolution of the vow. "We need your signature on our trust and wills, actually," Draco said, meeting his son's eyes, hoping futilely that Scorpius's hurt would diffuse. "You're the executor. The nullification of the vow meant we needed to change the other documents to reflect the magical status of our relationship."
She laughed, sitting down next to Ron. "I'm just kidding. What did he do?"
Draco kisses back,
"Wait," he says, looking at me much too intently as he touches the chain. "Episkey."
"Want to fuck some shit up?" she asks. "Take some Polyjuice and mess with people? Get drunk? Watch the original Star Wars trilogy with themed snacks?"
“I don’t know. I told them to put a little of everything.” He handed Harry a plastic spoon.
Harry takes a deep breath and smiles. He feels sad, but it's okay. They're off to the races, even if it's not what he'd imagined.
Harry reached across the table for Draco's hand and squeezed. "No, it doesn't make you a snob. It just shows you're so privileged as to be clueless. It's kinda cute."
of the old holidays except for Yule and a lot of wizarding culture had been suppressed in order to make Muggleborns (he found he didn't even think the other word any more, what was happening to him?) more comfortable.
"Ah yes, please continue listing all the ways you
Then he
with rage, throwing the Cloak off his shoulders. His vision went red, and he vaguely recognized lifting his wand.
"No, Harry, don't you dare sleep or I- I won't kiss you. Hagrid, you
Harry was confused. "What?" He realized that, with Colin almost constantly underfoot, he'd definitely snapped at the kid more than a few times. A mild guilt hit Harry, and he smiled at Colin. "No, Colin. I know I-" Words weren't really Harry's forte, but then he felt something pressed into his left cloak pocket. He stuck his hand in and found two boxed Chocolate Frogs. He pulled out the chocolates, handing them to the boy. "Here. For you and your brother. An apology for being a-" Harry was about to say prick but perhaps that wasn't the best word to use in this instant. "-A bad friend."
The mangy man snarled at Draco, who visibly flinched. "What are you waiting for, Draco? Do it. Finish him."
"Truth be told, I've been...thinking about things. Conflicted." Harry stopped, thus Draco did too.
The kiss was….nice. It was very sweet, and soft, but it...it wasn't
His thoughts whirled, feelings he'd fought to repress fighting their way back into his consciousness. No amount of convincing himself that they were simply expressions of rivalry was effective, he wasn't that dumb. But, Merlin, he
He should have known that wouldn't have worked. Draco felt Potter's calloused hand gently cup his face, guiding him to look at Potter again. He braced himself for the mocking but he was met with...care, a warm look that if he dared he could define as love. It heated Draco like the fire that burned in the Slytherin common room, and the shock of it all was most likely why he melted under it, leaning into Potter's hand.
"Stay," Harry mumbled, eyes all but shut. "Please."
"Um- Hermione-"
Still...just in case, he had to say goodbye. To all of them. It was illogical but Harry had a feeling that something big was going to happen while he was gone with Dumbledore, and he wanted to at least talk to his friends one more time.
Draco did the only thing he could in the moment. He laughed, long and hard. "Potter? Never. He's a good kisser and I bet he's a
A shard of ice pierced Harry's heart. He could
The beginning of the walk was...awkwardly silent, to say the least. The stairs weren't cooperating either. Each and every flight seemed to shift in order to ensure Harry and Draco took the longest route to the Gryffindor common room, and Draco just wanted the floor to swallow him up.
Harry stepped closer, again, and this time Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's waist, pulling him even closer. Harry leaned in to whisper against Draco's lips. "A very posh, spoiled little ferret who is, a lot of the time, a prick."
"Draco, heyyy-" Harry slurred, giggling even harder. He could hear Hagrid make a sound of concern but soon he was being held by Draco which was comfy.
The man scoffed. "Wonderful, eh? Can't say I missed you, old man."
Granger's eyes widened. "Ronald, you are a
like years to Draco, but he wasn't just going to tell Harry that. Knowing him, he'd take it as a personal failure and try to make Draco feel better. He didn't want Harry's pity.
Hermione and Ron, no, Granger and Weasley had been standing outside the room, waiting to receive Harry. As planned, they'd told Her-
Draco had already risen, cradling a sleepy Harry in his arms. The boy was...too small, almost fragile. Despite all his muscles from Quidditch, Draco was still scared Harry would break in half if Draco held him too hard. "Mm?"
Draco smiled back, warm and soft. He didn't even know he could
Draco waited as Harry seemed to mull that over. Finally he spoke, quietly. "Thank you, guys..." Harry leaned into Draco, sighing, and Ron and Hermione took that as their cue to leave. As they walked away, Draco stroked through Harry's hair, and the both of them shifted to curl up on the couch, which Draco had enlarged for comfort.
forget the feeling of Harry pressed against him, his hand in Harry's hair, the way Harry said his name, the way Harry's lips moved with his own. He just...had to separate Harry from Potter. Harry was a dream, a fantasy he got to indulge for a day. Potter was reality, what Draco had to accept or he'd go insane and get both of them killed.
had cracked, that would be a sight. The fire, previously scorching, now felt comfortably warm and Harry felt his eyes closing.
"Yes but that still does not explain the trigger." Draco sighed, picking up his quill and scribbling down the new notes they had.
"I missed you too, Harry." Draco sighed, happy.
a story." Ginny's hand found Harry's in the grass, and Harry took it.
He felt warmth around the wound, a touch came back wet and warm. But when he was able to clear his vision from the pain, Snape was gone.
"Potter, why the
wrong with Potter and it seemed to have something to do with his control. Well, it wasn't like Potter had much control in the first place, and Draco could handle a Potter who was more aggressive than usual. The newly healed scars on Draco's chest were probably the worst Potter would get to anyway. If anything truly bad transpired, he'd cast Incarcerous on Potter and throw up a shield.
Ron and Hermione were waiting for Harry the next morning. Seeing them filled Harry with guilt. He'd….he'd been horrible, potion or no potion. "Guys, I'm so sorry."
. Oh this was certainly hell, to have to see that smile and not be able to kiss it. Draco had a pang of empathy for Tantalus.
"Potter, I forgive you. We're...we're on two sides of a war, we're going to fight, there's no point in apologizing for that. War is bloody, and if I'd….died, I'd hardly be the last casualty." Draco bit the inside of his cheek, turning his head away so Potter wouldn't see the tears stinging his eyes.
"And you both had fun, not romantically of course, but you had fun."
Harry felt an odd euphoria bubbling up inside him, bursting out in the form of a pleasantly surprised laugh. Almost immediately, though, he was seized by anxiety. "Shit, Ginny, I've been avoiding him like the
Luna shook her head. "I'm not Draco, Harry. How would that have felt if you were kissing Draco?"
Draco tried to deflect. "Er...come again?" Yes, Draco. Perfect. Malfoy eloquency at its finest.
He could see Ginny and Luna exchange a look from the corner of his eyes, and he wrinkled his nose. But then Harry was
Draco had no issue hating the headmaster. Especially seeing what the grief of losing him was doing to Harry, how all the lies and secrets had spun their web around Harry's psyche. What more had he hidden, that they would never get to know? What more would be eating away at Harry?
"Okay what the FUCK happened?" Pansy hoisted Draco to his feet, ignoring Snape who passed by with a "Language, Parkinson." "I was watching all class, and first Potter was
Draco peered at the board. Blaise was paired with Granger, at least he wasn't going to accidentally call her a Mudblood and spark some kind of messy feud. The two may actually enjoy the period, both so annoyingly studious though Blaise was better at not acting like a know-it-all. Pansy was not so lucky, she was paired with the Weasel, but she could probably set him to chopping ingredients or something, she was good at getting her way. Draco was…..oh sweet Merlin.
He'd tell Draco about his feelings after he came back. It was his best course of action, if he came back he'd have at least enough confidence that he could keep Draco and himself safe. They'd be one Horcrux down, one step closer to ending this war.
Ginny grinned. “Didn't know you were a prophet now, Harry.”
"Harry." Harry's head shot towards Hermione, who'd spoken up with a hint of concern in her voice. "Are you….okay?"
“Tomorrow night...when he’s off with me….” Harry’s eyes widened. “It’s like a vaccine.”
Potter, I'm sure you're going to come around to his messy hair that you'd love to get your fingers in, and his loud mouth that you'd love to-"
Luna plucked the last piece of grass from Harry's hair, narrowing her eyes at Ginny. Ginny pouted slightly, and neither Harry nor Luna could keep a straight face. Ginny couldn't either, and soon they were laughing all over each other, all over again.
Okay,
"Draco..." Harry whispered, hating how raspy his voice was.
That was a lie. Draco knew he would
was giving him that weird look. Draco forged on with the conversation. "Sorry, I was...thinking. For this to be a first sight potion, however, Harry would have to have been looking at me when he consumed the potion."
Draco sighed. "Because….because I was scared. Of how you made me feel, of...what that would mean for the future, for us. I thought I was...sparing you, sparing myself if I...pushed you away. Both my and your friends explained to me how thick I was being and… and I realized I missed you."
Draco snorted into his hand. "Hermione, how about you continue to look into the antidote? I'll return after I bring
The hushed voices outside the room, however, quickly faded, and Draco could hear Harry- no,
"And I've insulted you enough for you to know
Draco stepped up to Harry. "Is...everything okay?"
Harry sighed, running a hand through his hair. “Perfect. Okay...we’ll have to take turns getting out of here, the cloak won’t fit everyone. Ron, Hermione, Draco, you’re prefects so you don’t need the cloak. Ginny, can you take Luna to the Ravenclaw common room on your way to our common room?”
Harry caught Draco's eyes and….smiled? Harry's genuine, happy smile that was just a bit tilted, the right corner of his lips raised slightly above the right, a smile Draco hadn't expected to see again. Well this was a definite change from the last time Draco had been face to face with Harry. If he hadn't seen Luna and Harry kiss, he would have...he would have thought that perhaps Harry had changed his mind, that he didn't hate Draco anymore, that maybe he…
Ginny smirked. "Oh, don't worry, I will be asking
"Are you feeling well?" His hand found its way into Harry's hair and, honestly, this whole potion situation wasn't so bad, not with Harry melting against him like this.Then Draco realized which hand he was using to stroke Harry’s hair. He faltered, covering it up with a stretch.

Harry looked into the sky, and there was a cloud in the form of some misshapen blob. "I've never seen one, but I guess that it would look like that. They infest brains, right?"
such thoughts were dangerous.
Draco stepped into the common room and right into Pansy's arms. He leaned into her embrace, let her lead him to the couch, let her stroke through his hair as his body was racked with silent sobs. It felt like hours passed before Draco was handed off to Blaise, who guided him gently to his bed.
can trust you to...do the right thing." She didn't turn away from the book as she spoke, occasionally noting things down on the parchment next to her.
Once, when he'd been walking with Draco, Harry was tripped by an
. "“Kill me then!" He shouted, voice hoarse. "“Kill me like you killed him, you coward —”
Harry was suddenly hit with a wave of gratitude. Ron and Hermione, when they weren't mooning over each other, kept trying to get Harry to...talk. It was suffocating, especially since he didn't know what to say. Ginny and Luna just….let him be, didn't push him to talk, didn't try to analyze him. Made fun of him, sure, but...they didn't pity him. He sighed. "I just...I can't afford to be selfish right now. I get that Dra-Malfoy is working with Dumbledore and Hermione now but....he's still a Death Eater. Its dangerous for both of us if I get involved. Besides, I didn't even feel this until the potion hit, for all I know its just..aftershocks. A memory of how I felt."
The tears that had been so hard for Harry to let out finally streaked down his cheeks. "I missed you too, Draco, so so much."
Harry snorted, and soon all four of them were laughing. Even Weasley, who was still chuckling as he slid onto the bench, next to Granger. Draco was surprised how...easy it was, to laugh with the people he'd spent so much of his life hating. He wondered, perhaps, if the situations had been different….could they have been friends?
One thing Draco had not accounted for was how clingy Harry was. For example, he'd just been poring over yet another book on love potions with Granger, while Weasley went to grab other titles that Pansy had recommended. He was getting used to not calling him the Weasel, Weasley itself felt...too personal. He'd been calling the Weaslette Ginny, though. She'd threatened to hex off his bits if he didn't and Draco had seen enough of that girl using her wand that he wasn't going to risk it. While Granger and Draco had been comparing notes, Draco had felt the bench creak as someone sat to his left. Then, four limbs wrapped around him, and the familiar notes of broom polish and wood smoke filled Draco's nose as Harry buried his face into Draco's shoulder.
"If he can't-"
Thank Merlin for Luna's intuition. "Room of Requirement, at midnight. Call everyone that came to the Ministry with us last year, and..." He looked up, spotting Draco walking down the path, towards the greenhouses. "And Draco."
"This rules out any potions that would function by thought, it wasn't the fact that Harry was thinking of you in the moment. It doesn't seem to be a random acting or a reversal of feelings potion either." Granger looked into the bookcases, thinking. "If anything, the ingredients of this potion would only work to bolster and amplify any feelings, say, friends to lovers or even acquaintances to lovers."
"So you've been on a date that you both enjoyed, you two have spent some quality alone time with each other, all great ways to be romantically involved if those Witch Weekly magazines are to be believed. Now, kiss her."
"Draco, I-"
And that's how Draco found himself in the Room of Requirement at 6 minutes to midnight. Hermione and Ron were there as well, but Ginny, Luna, and Harry hadn't arrived yet.
The door burst open and Draco froze. Granger was there and she looked
that this is important, not just to me but to Hogwarts, to the whole bloody wizarding world." Harry scoffed, picking up a mini treacle tart and biting into it, refixing his gaze on Draco. "I get that you guys are worried, but I need you two to trust me."

Ron and Hermione...well for one, they'd apparently gotten

Harry wiped a tear out of his eye with his pinkie, still chuckling. "Draco, there is nothing, and I promise,
Hermione shook her head. "You remember what Pomfrey said. Until we find what potion you are under, we can't let you go without supervision. Especially when the target is-"
it, white hot against his face, blinding him.
have. Maybe he wasn't happy, but at least he was strong. Harry couldn't afford to be weak right now, not with the whole Wizarding World on his shoulders.
A Portkey. That was- that was a Portkey which meant this was planned. All of it. Even...even the invasion. Dumbledore had sacrificed Hogwarts...why? Was he so confident that they could fight off any level of invasion? What was he aiming for?
Harry wondered how much more damage he could do to his eyes by staring at the sun. Concussions and malnutrition had already stolen a lot of his eyesight, despite Madam Pomfrey's best efforts to fix it a bit every time he visited the hospital wing. Staring into the sky like this couldn't be good for his eyes but honestly? Harry didn't give a flying fuck. The grass was slightly warm under his skin and the air was thick with that lazy Sunday afternoon feel. He'd managed to get his homework done, it was easier when he was keeping to himself in the library, actively avoiding Ron and Hermione.
Okay, maybe he'd lied to his two best friends in order to meet the boy who was for all intents and purposes his sworn rival in order to apologize for attacking him and maybe possibly a quick snog if he played his cards right...but that was normal, wasn't it? Honestly, his friends were overreacting with this whole potion thing. Harry was
"Mate, you didn't see how you were acting in class. You asked him to call you
fault. Typical.
"Mate...you're getting way too into this. We all know Draco is a slimy bloke and most likely going to get a Dark Mark but...right now you're just obsessing over him." Ron looked Harry up and down, then exchanged a look with Hermione. Merlin, Harry hated when they did that. He was fine, he was being
Granger peered at him. She'd been doing a lot more of that than glaring nowadays, and Draco didn't think he quite liked it. It was...appraising, as if Draco was a puzzle to be solved. But then Harry hummed happily into his shoulder, kissing it softly, and Draco was thoroughly distracted from Granger and puzzles. Hm. He should probably be more worried about how much of a distraction Harry was, but he also couldn't find it within himself to care.
them, Draco, and they go one of two ways. In rare cases, they become obsessive, to the point of killing the object of their affection, or, and this is most likely whats going to happen to Harry because this happens to most people, they give up. They stop eating, they stop drinking, and soon enough they stop breathing."
something happens….I'll always have this kiss. I will
Harry growls, a combination of frustrated and amused that seems to define the majority of his interactions with Draco. He turns over and finds Draco, beet red, trying not to laugh. "I don't know if I should knee you in the balls or snog you."
My throat is clenched so tight, I almost can't speak. "It's my father."
She flops onto the bed, still looking a bit green. It clashes with her hair. "I feel like shit."
Rump's eye roll could've been seen from space. "Whatever. Get in here."
Draco sat across from him, crossing his legs. "And Ron and Hermione."
Harry tries not to stare at Malfoy's hickey. Malfoy takes copious notes.
"What the fuck are you doing?" Malfoy hissed. “Is the Saviour cutting the queue? What about Gryffindor honour?”
Harry frowned at his mint chip.
Aster reached one of her hands to tug Harry close to them, smushing all three of their faces together.
"When you asked me if I would marry you to save the world," Harry started, wincing, "it was assumed that I was not harboring any sexual feelings about you. But I wanted to tell you that, er, in light of recent events. Well. I enjoyed kissing you."
Harry laughs, bewildered. "Is that what it's like to have a family of Slytherins?"
Harry snorts. "No. They're rubber." He grabs Draco's shoulders and steers him out of the kitchen.
"Harry," Ginny says, full of concern, stepping forward, but Draco steps between them. Ginny, voice like the war, barks, "Get out of the way, Malfoy."
"Well then come over here and pick one," Hermione says. "We recorded this, so we can rewind."
Hermione presses her lips together like she's quelling a smile.
"I—" Draco started, wincing when he realised how far back he needed to go to tell the story in a way that would make sense to their ears. To make them understand why asking Harry to pretend, why Harry agreeing to pretend, was based on years and years of working together, on years of co-parenting their attached children. How far back to make them understand?
a commentator began, but Scorpius waved his wand to end the holographic broadcast.
“My father?” Draco grinned. “Who knows. He might threaten disowning, that’s always fun. He might go in another direction and lecture me on discretion. Then again, it’s always possible he’ll try to curse me through the post with some kind of magical object to turn me into a boring straight man, in hopes I’ll settle down with a witch and inseminate an heir.” He shuddered.
tell me you aren't about to tell me a sob story about how hard life is for former Death Eaters or Slytherins or whatever. Because I will—" Harry grasped wildly for his best point of leverage; his eyes landed on his wedding robes. "I will stand you up at the altar."
"Dad!" James was coming closer now. "Should we—for old time's sake?"
"She wouldn't be you," Hermione said simply.
Harry turned toward Draco, holding his dirty trainer out somewhat apologetically.
"Next time." Draco nodded. "With Cushioning Charms."
"Right." Harry sipped his coffee. "Hear me out—I think we should talk to Parvati."
"It's not that I won't tell you. It's that it's not an interesting topic for conversation."
Neither of them answered. Harry wondered why Malfoy was holding back; he always knew about potions.
"Yes, but—"
Draco turned and pointed his wand at Harry's file cabinet as Jorgen had a few minutes ago. He whispered, "Accio papers that Rump could use to cause harm." A small stream of papers flew out of the cabinet and Draco Shrunk them mid-air as they soared into his pocket. "You can deal with those later."
"Good thing you got Scorpius as a son, then," Harry said, smiling. "He's the least jaded person I know. It's impossible to be jaded if you're in the same room as him."
Harry hums.
Priori Incantatem;
"Like shit," Ginny says, sitting next to Harry on the bed and flopping backward to lie there, legs dangling off the side of the bed. "But it's all taken care of. I went to St Mungo's."
Hermione and Draco. Watching MTV. Harry wrinkles his nose in confusion, setting the bags on the kitchen counter. "Pardon?"
and to the group chat he had with his kids and Teddy with the comment,
Draco took a step away, feeling a bit cold now that his hip was no longer smothered with Aster's warm little body. Harry stepped up next to him, which did not replace the loving feeling of a baby barnacle, but it did make him feel somewhat less bereft, regardless.
Harry, unable to help himself, grinned. He'd been away from infant-toddler hell for long enough to have repressed how hard it was. All he could think about was sweet babies sleeping on his chest, how their little lips made sucking motions in their sleep, how they made adorably gurgly coos. He had a vague memory of once, when his kids were 4, 2, and newborn, being so sleep deprived that he walked into a wall—but he'd done a good job of mostly forgetting about that part.
Albus nodded, then excitedly turned to Harry. "And she's so healthy! They can see the magical core!"
"I'm serious. Not that I don't appreciate the banter."
"The ten Galleons
"Are the British magical people working for the Triple M employees of the programme, or will they get pulled out of their jobs when we are no longer members?"
. He was a
Harry could feel anger bubbling inside him. They’d gone through so much shit, only for what? For Malfoy to be constrained by backwards pure-blood traditions? Harry wanted to yell about it, but that seemed like it’d probably hurt Malfoy more, so instead he went for distraction.
He and Ginny had tried to talk again, and it had been hopeless—disastrous. The kind of talk that doesn't so much open up a rift, but shines a light on rifts already there.
“I do commiserate with his difficulty dating,” Draco said, face creased with amusement. “Not that you or I could
Or maybe not, Harry thinks, as Malfoy rolls off Harry and onto his back, tugging Harry on top. Harry might not understand why, but he does know it feels different. Not because there's another cock. Harry doesn't know.
"But yeah, I know."
Draco picked up his teacup, put it back down. "I thought we—I—could keep emotion completely out of it. I thought we could be pragmatic—we could be roommates and pretend to be in love sometimes. We were both used to taking on burdens for work, for the magical world. I thought it wouldn't be that big of a deal. I thought—we were already family, anyway. Like, if moving into Andromeda's house would save the world, obviously I'd do it, right? At least…that's what I told myself."
you happy. You were happy and excited at Scorpius and Al's wedding. You were over the moon when Aster was born."
Harry considered that. He supposed it was true, though it would depend on
"That makes
his hair.) Hermione stepped into the Floo first and was whooshed away practically mid-sentence in planning for the new committee.
Harry bristled, mind jumping to all the worst conclusions. Nico, pressuring Lily to get married or to have a baby. Nico, making Lily abandon her dreams. "What about him?"
"Marx," Harry said, "and yeah. Yeah. You're right."
his shit-eating grin against his chest, "you don't. You
“So you want to punch me?”
Harry groaned and slumped against Draco's shoulder.
Hermione stopped cleaning. "Do you want to be alone? I shouldn't have assumed—"
Life on the street bustles on. People hurry past, glancing at their watches, presumably late for work.
Hermione cleared her throat. “As the male body enters the excitement stage, the spongy tissue becomes erect. A penile erection is caused by the release of nitric oxide from neurons into the arterial blood supply of the penis." She paused, looked like she was about to burst into laughter, but managed to arrange her face back into a serious mask. "This chemical compound causes the blood vessels to relax and allows the tissue to become engorged with blood. Also, during this stage, the tip of the penis becomes lubricated with secretions of the blubo-urethral glands and the testicles tighten.”
“Silver—oh, good grief.” Draco sighs, pinching his nose. “Harry, I just wanted to start our Christmas traditions. We still need to charm the cards, and we need to make four different lasagnas—one no meat, one no ricotta, one vegan, one gluten-free. And I thought we might mull that bottle of grenache, if you fancy.”
Malfoy glances at the moving staircase, and Harry watches horror wash over his pointy features.
He sat, forcing himself to meet Harry's eyes.
"What?" Draco asked, confused, casting a Brushing charm at his hair. "No, why?"
"Oh!" Harry said, somehow swept up in Draco's desire for their decor to reflect their politics. He waved his wand in a silent Accio. A moment later a frame zoomed down the staircase and into Harry's outstretched hand. He walked over to the mantel and set it next to Draco's dove.
He’s just thumbing to his message thread with Harry when the Floo wooshes. Draco tosses his phone on the counter and walks into the living room, then freezes.
"Who would be likely to take your place?" Penny asked. She was the type of Ravenclaw who was always jumping to the next corollary.
"Alright, alright," Harry interrupted, nudging Draco with his elbow. "You've made your point."
"You're impossible," Harry said, after downing an entire glass of water. He wondered, privately, whether Draco was right. He would go over there if the kids needed a break.
"I can tell you I won't be eating him," I say.
"Draco," Harry said in full Dad Voice. "Do you want to talk about it?"
James snorted. “I forgot, you two are weird as fuck. Can’t ever compare other relationships to yours.”
"Potter," I gasp, gesturing at my head.
"And I'll have a quiche with a side salad," Draco added.
“Uh huh! Huh! No! Nope!” James, hand over his eyes, walked backwards out of the room, slamming into the wall with some drama before he closed the door. “Continue having a good night!” he shouted from the corridor, before his footsteps sounded up the stairs.
Malfoy leaned aristocratically, his hand on the desk, making no attempt to help or to pretend to help gather supplies. “Perhaps you ought to try it, Potter, as you seem to be the one snapping at me.”
"We're in here!" Draco's voice was sharper than usual—his solicitor voice. The voice he used when scaring the pants off his underlings, not the voice he used at home.
"That's interesting, and we can unpack that some other time, but turns out there's only one person I'm interested in these days." Harry grins, leaning his head to press a kiss to Draco's neck. "I told her about us."
Harry groaned, shaking his head. "No, never mind, I'm not going to invade your space any more than I already have. Maybe shelves would be good. I was just thinking about how annoying it is to have to keep changing where my stuff is whenever the kids come, too, but forget it."
Potter shakes his head. "That doesn't work very well in this kind of light. They kinda shimmer."
"And I have you, too," Harry agrees, rolling towards Draco and throwing an arm over him.
Harry half-listened to Nico and Scorpius discussing hacking, a concept that he had only the most tenuous understanding of, and served himself a second bread roll. Draco, sitting on his right, caught his eye and gave him A Look. Harry tried to convey
Scorpius was a magical historian. He taught classes sometimes, but more often wrote articles and books. Albus and Harry had been trying to convince him to write some history books meant for popular audiences.
"I'm fine," Harry said—feeling anything but—and attempted a smile.
It's a coffee that reads your deepest java desires and transforms its taste into what you most crave!"
"Scorpius knows French spells. He spent every summer in France."
Harry forces himself to meet Malfoy's eye. "I also, erm, don't think that casual sex with a friend is on the cards for me. Like, a drunken one-night-stand when you think you won't see each other again is different than having sex with a friend. I wouldn't want—" Oh fuck it, he might as well forge ahead. "I wouldn't want to do that with a friend unless we were, you know, properly together."
Teddy grins, all gums, and Harry tickles his cheek. Teddy chomps Harry's finger, which makes Harry laugh. "If you bite like that when you get teeth, you'll be quite the menace."
"Why are
The coffee was cold and bitter; he couldn't figure out why he was still drinking it. Glancing around, he subtly Vanished the cup, sunk into a bench, and buried his head in his hands.
Draco nodded, toothbrush bobbing. “Sometimes I think no one should be allowed to get married until they’re over forty.”
Harry’s eyes widened. This was worse than a badge.
"Vain son of a bellend," Harry murmured.
"Well—" Nico started, frowning slightly.
"MORE WHISKEY!" James shouted, swirling around them and pressing drinks into their hands.
"Never," Draco returned, laughing. "And on that note I suppose we should discuss the fact that you moved into my house today."
Feeling like a complete arse for having flirted with the maggot, Harry placed two Galleons on the table and left in a huff.
Hope everyone is staying healthy. I'm hunkered down at home, still! Starting to think I might not know how to go back to the world when the pandemic eventually ends...
"Oh, it's you," Harry sighed. "Come in, then. I'm not sure what the appropriate greeting is after those election returns. 'Bad evening'? 'Fuck this shit'? 'The earth is screwed'?"
? Are you kidding me?" He turned to Parvati. "But we
Malfoy raises one thin eyebrow. "
Two hours later, they arrive outside Harry's flat carrying an old school Nintendo NES, Duck Hunt, and two zapper light guns.
Harry opened his mouth to object, but she held up a hand to insist on not being interrupted.
Harry's mind unhelpfully supplied an image of Draco the way he'd looked—scared, cornered—on the Astronomy Tower the night of Dumbledore's death. The way he'd looked about to vomit when the Death Eaters, at his invitation, ran into the school. That whole night had haunted Harry's dreams for years. The terror of it had diminished only somewhat with infinite mental replaying.
"No, I am an idiot, because I am only ever this unhinged when it comes to you. And other crushes, I suppose."
," my father says. "Now. The Dark Lord will be here any—"
Abruptly, Draco'd had enough. He tightened his core lest he throw out his back again, then grabbed Harry's wrist and spun them around so Harry was on his back, eyes alight with lust and amusement and something else, Draco astride his hips.
"Can I really go out with someone who would drink Frog Fanta or Burbling Sludge?"
Out of Draco's view, Harry cast a spell to Displace their clothes, leaving them pressed against one another, skin against skin, and Draco buried his face in Harry's neck and hair as he rolled his hips forward, relishing the sensations, the warmth—
Harry spins around—the telly is paused on a picture of Nick as a mummy. He waves his hand to turn off the screen. "No, you don't have to go. Ron's being a git."
“Yes, it would be brilliant. Everyone can get drunk and we can act like stupid teenagers rather than war veterans.”
“What did you do.”
Harry blinked. "The one?"
Draco reached out blindly with the hand next to Harry, grasping until he found Harry's hand, and threaded their fingers together. He squeezed, and once Harry's fingers were clasped firmly between his, he leaned forward and glared at the assembled family. "
And fuck if
"Okay," Harry said, rubbing his hand on Draco's knee. "So how
"I know." Draco sighed, then winced. "There was one other annoying thing today, too."
Most times, Harry had no trouble paying attention to discussion of Lily's charms, but at the moment, all he could think about was the way Lily's faith in his and Draco's relationship made him feel like the toxic sludge at the bottom of one of Lily's contaminated rivers.
? He's a stickler for rules and doesn't love Rump. If we asked him to clarify these points, he'd probably raise it through the ranks."
There's a clatter of the kettle, and Malfoy turns around. "Is Earl Grey—What's the matter with you, Potter?" Harry doesn't answer. "Oh good grief, I wasn't trying to
Huh? Harry turned towards Albus, not understanding the question, and repeated the words in his brain. Now?
For a long minute, they stood in silence. Harry tried to gather his wits for the curious stares they would get in the DMLE offices, the onslaught of press and onlookers they would encounter in the Atrium.
“What did James order?”
Ginny, out of Astoria's line of sight, bounced on her trainers a little, as if to emphasise how comfortable her feet were. Harry had to hide a smile.
Draco, that feels good."
"Ah, yes. We couldn't possibly jeopardise that brilliant ruse." Draco smiles and gestures at the door. "After you."
Harry laughed. "No, it's fine—I'm sorry I asked."
He took a deep breath and walked up the white steps to the bronze doors. He could feel the goblin standing guard staring at him, but Harry ignored him and walked inside. He walked through the second set of doors and (ignoring how every goblin in the marble hall turned to stare) he asked the goblin stationed there where he might find Draco Malfoy's office.
"I'll help!" Nico said, leaning forward. "We could do a wicked social media campaign. So many ways it could go. Scare tactics? Show images of poisoned Muggles? Some kind of image of the earth being overtaken by toxicity? Babies dying from their arrogance?"
