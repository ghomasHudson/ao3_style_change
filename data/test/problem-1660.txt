Draco was waiting for him on the stoop with a cup of tea, the sun having set hours ago. Harry and Flea alighted in the clearing, and Harry jumped down, eager to recount his day. His victories. His triumphs.
“Good morning, Harry.” She called, not yet opening her eyes, still running her fingertips over the last of the blooming foxglove. Her magic lay around the garden like dew in the first breath of the morning.
Draco tried to regain his composure as if this was all a routine morning and march them back to the cottage to indulge in a full English before beginning his research. He couldn’t help but feel grateful that Harry had sought him out, and that he didn’t pressure him to explain why he was the way he was. Who would have thought Harry sodding Potter would be helping him unpack his baggage.
Unnamed, but familiar emotions reared from the depths, threatening to overtake him. He wanted to be near Harry, to feel his solidity, but at the same time couldn’t stand the thought of being touched intimately. It was so very different to the feeling he had grown accustomed to, the desire to have Harry touch him. The openness he had come to love. Now was yet a new feeling. A new desire. For touch and comfort, but for it to go no further. He didn’t know how to articulate any of this.
Draco narrowed his eyes in response “I suppose.” He finally let out, searching Potter’s worn and angry face. “If you say so, Potter.”
. Draco had thought a bit madly, trying hard not to vomit on himself from nerves. Her eyes flicked back and forth between them for a shocked moment before she settled on, “Well, then, we’ll need another chair, won’t we?” and flagged down a waiter.
There was no way of walking around the pool to get to the waterfall, but it was clear that it was Flea’s destination as his hooves lost contact with the bottom of the pond and he began to swim his way towards the rock wall. Draco couldn’t figure out why, as to his own eyes, the water fell down a solid wall of dark granite.
After packing his office and chasing off the third HR personnel that came by to plead for him to stay by yelling “There is literally NO amount of vacation time you could offer me to stay!” down the hall at her scurrying back, he used his outtray for one last letter delivery.
Harry beamed at him. “But, before we get ahead of ourselves, let’s focus on the date we’re currently on. Tell me how unemployment is treating you. Hermione seems particularly frantic lately about your research.”
Ron was asking him to walk the brittle line between the two, life and death. To heal, in his own way, the wounds that death would come sniffing out, hungry and hopeful.
“Any who, enough abou’ meself, how’s Mungo’ treatin’ you these days, haven’ heard from yeh in quiet some time. If yeh ask me, they’re workin’ yeh to the bone, they are.”
“And so Bulloxinion sauntered to him, stroking his own impressive member to erection, his tendency to exhibitionism and the whispered fawning of the crowd goading his cock to thicken with blood. He positioned himself behind Pockenello’s raised and loosened hole and thrusted in without prelude, the silken embrace of his lover eliciting a cry from deep within him. The slickened sounds of their seditious thrusting gave way to punctuation with the eager and ravenous pleading of Pockenello, whose member leaked and twitched with the agonising pleasure of Bulloxinion’s deft assault of his prostate.”
He stared down at the bed. The only unfamiliar thing. No longer a bunk bed, a transfiguration Draco had relied upon in those early days. When Harry was the one trembling, wracked with withdrawals. When they had fought and bickered and sniped and eventually had reached a tenuous truce. When they’d found common ground.
“Yes, well, consider me an ignorant plebeian with far too much excitement for the birth of one of my best friend’s children.” Harry held out his hand with ill-disguised anticipation. Draco laughed and took it. In an instant he was pulled into the crushing void only to reappear in Luna’s frost covered garden.
“Malfoy. I’m sorry to wake you up. I’m sorry for my shit behavior all day today. It’s just. I’m... I’m struggling with something and it feels really awful and I don’t know what to do. It’s scary. I feel like I want to use, but… the rest of me doesn’t want to. I like being sober. I do. I’ve been doing so well, and, now, all of a sudden, I wake up sore after all these nightmares of Bellatrix hitting me with the cruciatus curse and it’s been after me all day. It’s making me worried. Like, maybe I don’t have as good of a handle on things as I thought I did. Maybe I’m a lot weaker than I thought. Or, mentally, I’m not going to be able to say no.”
“So, how are the students?” Ron asked, interestedly. “Do you have a horde of mini Gryffindor’s filling your ranks?”
Not yet an hour later, Harry was nodding off after a particularly venomous hit, rolling onto his side, sighing softly. His mind was blank. He refused to engage in anything outside the world of Sirius’s bedroom, of bliss, of quiet and gentle breathing that slowed and slowed and slowed as he slipped away.
He had fished compulsively in his pocket for a post-it note to soothe his nerves and distract his mind before remembering that he didn’t carry hope with him anymore. Instead, he touched Harry’s words traced on frayed parchment that further tightened the vice grip of nerves in his midsection.
“Will it even be possible?” Harry scoffed, scooping the cubed potatoes into a bowl and standing to pass them to Ron, who was smiling in an odd manner. Draco couldn’t figure out why Ron looked so pleased. “The ministry is dinosaurian and the bureaucratic cogs move far too slowly.” Harry continued grumpily standing against the counter next to Ron with his arms folded. Draco noticed Hermione, too, was smiling into her pile of perfectly dissected broccoli. He narrowed his eyes at Percy.
“If anyone has a pure and undamaged soul, it’s Hagrid. The man is a saint.” Harry said fondly. “The unicorns can probably sense it.”
“Draco!” Neville yelled in greeting when he looked up from his chopping board, sending carrots flying in all directions. “Oh, damn!”
much he can be punished for his crimes. But what I wanted to talk to you three about today is the questioning. You’ll all be administered veritaserum, and they’re not allowed to ask you questions outside of the case. We’ve practiced each of your stories and you all know the kinds of questions you’re expecting. The public defender has been given your testimonies as of Monday and they’ve sent over a list of the possible rebuttal questions. That’s what we’re going to go over today.” He looked them each in the eye to make sure they were all on the same page.
Draco apparated just beyond the iron gates of the Hogwarts grounds and saw Hagrid standing there waiting to let him in.
Harry shot him a look as if he couldn’t be sure of the subtle sarcasm. “You better be fucking joking, Malfoy.” He said with an unsure smirk.
“I wonder if the other hallows are real.” Draco wondered aloud. “Pureblood families tell the story of the three brothers to their kids all the time, but we all assumed it was make believe. But, I mean, if the Elder Wand was real, maybe the other two aren’t so far fetched. An invisibility cloak would be pretty useful.”
In the days before, Harry would have smiled and taken Luna’s words with hefty grains of salt, laughing away the Rotfang conspiracy with the nargles and other such hiccoughing stories of magical oddity and infamy, impossible and incomprehensible all at once. Stories that would have delighted a child, yet left all of the adults bored and irritable, as if Luna’s world of possibility was a burden, not a gift. A distraction, not an insight.
Draco went through the motions of greeting everyone, his anticipation and nerves ramping up once again. This was happening. They were really doing this.
Malfoy nodded slowly, and Harry reached up to lightly rub circles on his upper back, doing his best to be comforting through the thin material of Malfoy’s grey t shirt.
It was several nights later that Harry left the sanctuary of Ron and Hermione’s and returned to Grimmauld Place. He brought his box of things, meagre though they were, and carried them upstairs into Sirius’s bedroom, laying them gingerly on the floor next to the bed. The bed he had built himself, strong beams of Khaya Mahogany, so keen to soak up the new magic of the place. He paused a moment to revel in the feel of Sirius and Remus, lingering love that seemed to scatter itself about the room, as if it were at home amongst the dust.
All of the diagnostics came back negative, except one. One shimmering so vaguely, so minutely, so indistinctly that if he had blinked at the wrong time he would have missed it. Would have chalked it up to a trick of the light. But, no, there was something there. He cast again, focusing more deeply, pulling at the thread of purple light that barely existed at all, tendriling its way through Hermione’s blood.
“Yes, I’m fine.” He answered in a clipped tone. “And no, thank you.” He righted himself and began scratching notes without looking at Harry. He had been in a foul mood ever since he had cast his patronus and he had taken it out on Harry by being withdrawn, cold, and moody.
They spent a few comfortable hours sharing cake and drinking too much tea. Bidding a chaste farewell, Harry planting another soft kiss on Draco’s cheek, they reluctantly parted.
Draco felt dizzy. It was incomprehensible. He could not believe what he was reading. Clutched in his white knuckled hands was approval for his research proposal, paid leave for his sabbatical,
When he came into the flat, arms laden with bags of sweets he had impulse purchased, Harry eyed him closely. He had just barely dropped the parcels in the kitchen before moving for Harry with ill-disguised desperation. Harry had wrapped his arms around Draco in practised movements and began kissing down his neck with that new single-minded purpose.
“Potter.” He said, “Harry, come on—” He rubbed Potter’s sternum again, trying to rouse him to consciousness, but he was far out of reach.
Draco spend long minutes postponing the inevitability of his release, challenging himself to just feel and to enjoy. To allow himself to exist as he was. His normally cold fingers felt hot and soft in a way that was entirely unfamiliar as he brushed across his entrance and traced along the crease in movements that were becoming more self-assured as he lost himself in his gratification.
“Healer Sprigg, thank you so much for looking after Harry – do you have any idea what caused this? I had Robards send over the list of potions with blood magic from the raid earlier this week as soon as I realised something was wrong and got him here – there’s nothing to push you into immediate action like your best mate lying unconscious in a toilet, I’ll tell ya.”
Draco stared at the bottle, shook it slightly, saw that what was supposed to be a thick liquid, was now the texture of sand, or ash.
It had taken longer than usual to calm down, he thought with a dull resignation. He rubbed his eyes and looked at the file below him. Lestrange. What a joy.
“What—” He tried asking, before seeming to think better of it, before he buried his face into the pillow in front of him, breathing hard, his body tensing with anticipation.
, he thought bitterly. What, with the disaster of Astoria, and now Charlie, pureblood and blood traitors alike, he was
Harry stopped his languid stretching to look carefully at Draco. “Are you mad our patronuses match?” His voice was even but he sounded… hurt.
Harry had gotten up with the sun, run a full 10 kilometres around the farms of the area, showered and rushed Hermione and Ron out the door to work. And now, now he was preparing lunch. Picnic lunch.
He lasted 15 minutes. 15 very unsettled minutes. His resolve broke when a familiar owl appeared at his window. Knowing he would be incapable of confronting even written words from his mother while half dressed, he ran off to the bedroom to grab his shirt before letting the owl in and retrieving the note.
“Honestly, Mr. Potter, it always amazed me you never chose teaching. You’ve quite a gift for it. It’s about time you stopped futzing around and followed your true calling. The children need you. I’ve got about seven who I’ll be sending to your first DA meeting. That’s what I assume you’ll be calling it, that is?” She sniffed. “Dumbledore’s Army, still recruiting?”
“Is— Are they— is everything fine?” Harry asked breathlessly into Draco’s shoulder. Draco, who could do nothing else but shake his head and squeezed harder.
The dust that had once covered the entirety of Grimmauld Place was no more, and Harry felt nothing between his hands and the ancient magic of the wizarding home, a slow and gentle thrum, centuries of spells, decadently laid across floorboards and ornate paneling, along the moulding and every brick of the hearth. He let his fingers slide along the bannister wood, dark with the oils of many transient touches. He could hear Hestia’s voice from the meeting room, and he climbed the rest of the stairs, a newly steeped mug of tea steaming in his right hand, his left drifting across the dark, polished lines of oak. It warmed almost imperceptibly beneath his touch, gentle and reassuring. Grateful and at peace.
Now it was Draco’s turn to blush, which was so much more obvious on his pale skin. “Yes, well.” He cleared his throat. “After much distance and self reflection over the years, I can see now that my behavior was probably driven more by teenage hormones than anything.”
The Harry who wasn’t interested in drinking or couldn’t go to pub nights anymore. The Harry who shied away from honey on dark days, and who sometimes had to pause and stretch his shoulders, even now, when something would settle on his deeper wounds. The Harry who wouldn’t take sleeping draughts or who would feel uncomfortable talking to Healers ever again about his medical history. The Harry who had fought his way back from a different battle. One no one had bothered to see. One that was somehow so much crueler and more unfair than the first. One that was even lonelier. A battle that had been fought on the many nooks and exposed pieces of his own body. The Harry who didn’t want to be left alone too long.
A groan from behind him, and Harry felt a smile flit across his face for the first time that evening. Draco was pulling off his shoes and socks and robes and shirt and trousers, soaked at the knees from the snow, as he crossed the tiny room, throwing himself at the bed. He just barely managed to pull the thick layer of blanket back as he plunged into the veritable eyrie. Another muffled groan escaped him, and Harry sighed out a breath he hadn’t realised he’d been holding. They were okay. They were going to be okay.
After 30 minutes of stilted small talk in which Draco spent most of the time defending his life choices in the face of a lecture on pureblood duties, he had excused himself to see his godfather's portrait to update him on the DoM. It had been a fruitful conversation with much gossip and speculation about the Golden Git.
“Yes.” Malfoy said simply. He took a sip of the scalding tea and made a face as if he had forgotten it would be so remarkably hot. “I didn’t want to take the letters for you to read, in case you wanted… solitude. While you figure things out, anyway.”
“It appears that Dumbledore was chosen shortly after his sister died.” She said, pulling the most recent page of the ledger out to examine. “They weren’t sure if another was ever chosen, but they suspected it could have been Grindelwald. Unfortunately, Dumbledore died before he could teach the next in line. And, Grindelwald died in Nurmengard; a Death Herder who had never learned his tradition. There’s speculation that Snape could have been the next, but the war very effectively destroyed the chain. No one knows if Dumbledore managed to teach him anything, and who knows if it was ever meant it to be Harry after he sent him to die in the forest. That’s what’s so scary about this. Humans do things, like start wars, deforest an area, practice dark magic, and it damages the balance between life and death. Damages the delicate thestral and forest magic. From there it spirals. Creates chasms of dark magic, more human conflict, more death, more damage.”
They put Sylvia in the ground, together. In a circle, as they all used to sit. Vulnerable, still. Dennis casts the first bit of earth that covers her, and Harry lends himself to the work of filling the grave, throwing shovelful after shovelful of near black earth, rich and loamy, into the hole. Filling it up. Burying her. As he’s buried so many others.
A large wisteria draped over an archway in front of her door dropping large purple blooms on the porch that released their delicate smell as his shoes crunch pastel petals underfoot on the step. Her garden and house seemed to radiate life and he felt a little intimidated. It was all just so…
Draco paused his movements for a moment, not that surprised by the question, but didn't turn around. “It was real.” He almost whispered. Harry didn't respond, and Draco resumed his fiddling with the teapot when he heard the creaking of the bunk beds as Harry climbed up and collapsed onto the mattress. Draco glanced over at the beds, he hadn’t even bothered to change his clothes or take the scarf and hat off.
“It appears that Dumbledore was chosen shortly after his sister died.” She said, pulling the most recent page of the ledger out to examine. “They weren’t sure if another was ever chosen, but they suspected it could have been Grindelwald.

Creates chasms of dark magic, more human conflict, more death, more damage.”
He had gone to Romania to hold up his end of the Dragon bargain, meeting Charlie at the international portkey office. Charlie had side along apparated with him to the Dragon sanctuary. After an intense day of trapping, stunning, collecting samples, and soothing pissed-off dragons, Draco had been exhausted, but pleased with his work.
Harry slumped back against the table, relieved to have told her, but still fraught with the implications, with the possibilities that were unfolding. Secrets and lies, indeed. He looked down at a gentle tugging on his hand. Rose was reaching up to hold his two fingers in her tiny grasp. She had a sippy cup to her mouth in one hand and was pointing a stick at the pile of presents, levitating one.
“You know the Elder Wand core was a thestral tail hair.” Harry threw out like it was a comment on the weather.
Harry shot Draco a quizzical look. “Werewolves.” Draco mumbled, feeling absolutely filled with terror now. “And not the nice Professor Lupin kind. The Greyback kind.” He reflexively grabbed Harry’s arm to steady himself.
Harry smiled as Draco just said “Ginger, please,” and busied himself with putting the kettle on and arranging their mugs, always keeping the chipped one for himself.
Without opening his eyes, Draco cast a wordless warming charm, and Harry felt the gentle lapping of Draco’s magic against his skin, the distinct buzz and careful softness coating him in liquid warmth. He stepped forward into it, drinking it in.
And with each passing second, Harry felt himself holding stronger, on surer footing, more in touch with his limbs and the sense of his own body, his own self. And it was glorious, to feel so in control. To know that he had met with the moment of weakness that would have broken him, would have stolen him, and had survived it. Today was not his day to relapse. Today was just another day in recovery. A day he had mastered.
“My mother chose it. It’s a tradition in the House of Black, to be named after a constellation. She wanted something powerful for me, her only son, something that would connote fear and respect, and, above all, power. I’m not sure I could have ever lived up to it, but, in the end, I’m not sure she wanted me to.” Draco answered, his hand resting next to Harry’s, the warmth of his magic snaking around his fingers and up his arm, tethering them, and Draco’s own magic letting it.
“Longbottom? Are you in here?” He called cautiously. “Sorry to bother you, but I have a quick question on Lily of the Valley root…”
It was the late afternoon by the time Harry could get away from the farmhouse. Hermione had been late coming from work, mumbling incoherently about needing to read up on some things, cheeks unusually flushed and hair even more wild than usual.
“I think you need to write to Luna.” Draco said evenly, a small smirk on the corners of his lips. “She’s a therapist who works with addictions, Harry. She runs groups that are mixed muggle and wizard, so there’d be no chance of anyone mentioning you or why you’re famous. You’d be just another attendee.”
“Which is ignorant, because they’re amazing.” He said, feeling a bit petulant and defensive about his little Voileami.
Her letter had said that he wasn’t alone in their family tree, and that he should have these “very important family heirlooms”. Well, that was
It was on this particular rainy midmorning that a thoroughly soaked barn owl came fluttering to the window, tapping frantically on the edge to be let in. Draco hardly glanced up from the bubbling sludge in his cauldron, but Harry put down his book and hopped to the floor, letting the poor little owl in from the deluge outside.
Winston didn’t speak. His eyebrows knit together in embarrassed anger, he glared down at the floor, as if the stone tiles had broken his nose. As if the granite of the castle could have wronged him in such an obviously human way.
Draco charmed a pinecone to fly through the air for a very non-regulation compliant seeker’s game. They both cheated gratuitously, each more interested in teasing and out flying the other than in catching the pinecone. They kept challenging one another to more and more ridiculous feats of flying and tricks.
“No, it’s okay—” She started. “It’s just that— what she said. It didn’t really make sense to me at the time, and there was so much happening— I was so out of it for most of it. But— but, when she carved that word into my arm—” She pulled up her sleeve to reveal the thin raised scar;
Draco took a deep breath. Relief flooding through him and he nodded. “Will you lay with me?” He asked meekly, avoiding Harry’s eyes now. He felt stupid and
“Gentlemen.” He greeted in drawling, dignified tones as if they had had a standing appointment— as if Draco was expecting them. His voice was carefully controlled and didn’t reflect the utter terror he felt at being cornered in his own home by intruders. He spoke and sat in his desk chair like the healer he was. He wouldn’t let them see his fear. “And to what do I owe this pleasure?” He asked with a sharp voice.
Feeling uncomfortably aware of how small his office was, how nauseous he was, and just how fucking terrified he was at the prospect of upending his
“I’m working on it, Harry—” He said quietly, feebly, trying to make up for his dithering. “I’m working on my trauma. We can—” he trailed off, not knowing how to end the thought but not wanting Harry to think they could never be a normal couple because of him and his endless baggage.
“Or is it the Greengrass girl? Astoria? I remember you being quite fond of her. Come, Draco, don’t keep an old man in suspense. Who’s the lucky woman destined to carry my grandchildren?” His eyes looked fond and eager, proud. Draco was torn for a split second. One part of him wishing he could make his father proud, just this once. Let Lucius think he was someone he wasn’t. But that was what the young Draco would have done.
“After a rather enlightening conversation with my therapist. It seems that I have… I’ve… Well.” He paused again, swallowing nervously, and unable to look away from those eyes. “Remember when I said that sometimes things inevitably come up when two people live in isolation together like this?”
“You don’t know what this is like!” She threw back, acid in her voice. “You have a son! You have a beautiful, strong son, Cissy! And, he’s making you proud by serving! I can’t— I’ll never— the Dark Lord
But— it was different this time. In this dream, his queen was a dashingly handsome young man with dark hair, familiar eyes, and strong hands.
Stepping inside, he saw Luna and Greg sitting at kitchen island to the left, nibbling on snacks while Neville danced around his kitchen preparing dinner. There were hanging baskets of herbs dangling from the pot rack and potted plants fixed to the available wall space around the window above the sink.
Voileami and Flea began walking back towards the entrance. Harry and Draco nodded to one another before following their lead. Back into the narrow passage with the deafening sounds of rushing water, their patronuses behind them cast their shadows far ahead along the dark damp stone floor.
Okay so now that we’ve talked about Sawyer, I think it’s time we talk about Lou, whom I hear is your favorite character. What’s it about Lou that makes ‘em your favorite character?
You know, if you really want a story on “Quidditch for a Cause” then you should talk to Draco Malfoy, he’s actually playing in it. He’s right over there.
“No, I just need that concealer makeup you have. You know, for my neck.” To demonstrate what he meant, Draco pulled down the collar of his robes, revealing a series of love bites on his neck. Pansy gasped. “I suppose I could use glamour charms or just wear robes, but glamours are hard to keep on for long periods of time, and I don’t feel like wearing robes all the time, they make me look like my father.”
It was just kind of a trip for fun and relaxation. A break from work and stress and all that. I guess it was also a birthday trip for Draco. He’s twenty four- today, actually. We had loads of fun there.
Draco laughed and swatted Pansy’s hands away. “Yeah, I know you think that, but you’ve been my best friend since I was twelve. What do you think Harry wants, though? Do you honestly believe that we could be something? Or am I just being stupid, thinking that a couple of blowjobs meant more than it really did?”
Oh yes, he’s the one who really turned that team around, right? They’re now, what, third best in the league?
“‘S fine,” Draco said, his own voice coming out as more of a squeak. Harry nodded, and with one last apprehensive glance at Pansy, he sat down next to Draco.
Draco laughed again, and Pansy joined in, immensely pleased that she’d gotten her best friend out of his mood and into a happy state. “Shut up,” Draco said. “I can still feed you to the Giant Squid, by the way.”
Pansy ground her teeth together. “You honestly believe Draco, my Draco Malfoy, would have sex with Harry just to get close to him and learn all of his dirty little secrets? Which, by the way, I’m sure he has plenty of, being the boring poster boy for the ‘side of the light’.” Pansy made sure to stress the sarcasm on the word ‘plenty’.
“Pink, flowery diary would disagree with you,” Pansy singsonged, pleased to be getting on Granger’s nerves. She turned back to the bookshelf and again feigned interest at book titles.
Draco smiled and huffed a small laugh in spite of himself. “Stop it,” he said quietly, with no force behind it.
Yeah, I’d say that’s more of a reflection of the uncertainties we were going through as a couple when I wrote the book. There’s been a lot of challenges in our relationship and I didn’t want to tell a love story that’s dishonest or fake in any way. I wanted it to be real. So, yeah, the end of the book isn’t happy and mushy, it’s heartbreaking.
Harry shook his head vehemently. “No, no. Never. I’m not—I don’t know why I asked, Malfoy, sorry. Forget it. I won’t tell anyone. I’m not that kind of person. I’ll keep your secret.”
“No, Malfoy, no. That’s not what I meant. You don’t have to go back to being a bitch to me. I appreciate your advice, really. I just don’t want you to feel like you’re obligated to help me out just so I keep your secret,” Harry explained.
Harry smiled. “Well, when it comes to Potions, neither do I. Can you tell me what the bloody fuck a Bubolump is?”
I want a glass of champagne, actually, so I need you to talk to this lady here about Quidditch while I go get it, okay darling? Okay. Ta ta.
“Oh.” Draco blushed again. “Because I want to keep them.” Pansy raised an eyebrow at that, to which Draco responded defensively with, “It’s not weird. It’s just a reminder.”
Granger narrowed her eyes at Pansy. “Seriously, Parkinson. This is the last time I’m going to ask you this. What is Malfoy doing with Harry?”
Me? I don’t see how you made it as a team captain for one minute, whatwith how you go around interrupting people all over the place.
“Oh, we’re not telling the bloody Order, Harry,” Draco said dismissively, rolling his eyes. He was sat on the bench, crossing his arms as he watched Harry pace the small space of the compartment, making his annoyance obvious. Harry had been trying to convince Draco that they had to go to an adult for help for the past three minutes, and Draco was getting bored of constantly shooting down Harry’s ideas.
“Thank you,” Draco said. He rolled his eyes and tried to blink away the tears. “This is stupid. Me crying is not going to help anything. And don’t give me any of that Gryffindor bullshit that expressing your feelings is good for you or whatever.”
When I told my agent I wanted to do this match, she was like, “As long as it doesn’t mess up your face.” I think that even if I did wreck my pretty face it would be worth it, because this is for a good cause, and that’s what really matters.
You should probably consider yourself lucky for that, Reuben, cause this one doesn’t tend to shut up after he starts talking.
Draco slapped Pansy lightly, looking a bit outraged. “Yeah, but you never said that you thought he was shagging Harry instead.”
“Okay,” Harry agreed. He squeezed Draco tighter in his arms. He knew they would have to leave the train soon, already terribly late for the Start-of-Term Feast. He wanted to treasure all the precious time he had alone with Draco before they had to go back to playing enemies again.
“You like boys?” Harry said suddenly. And no. That was not what Harry meant to say. That was not what Harry should’ve said.
Halle-Louyer asks: “Give us the deets. Is Drarry real or not? I saw you were in Morocco with them and I almost died seeing the video of you and them at the restaurant lol, please tell us the truth.” Now, I think Drarry is the combination of Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter’s names, correct?
Harry very much doubted that, and he didn’t believe that this singular act of amity somehow proved that Malfoy was in fact a good person at heart. But he could recognize the effort.
“Right. Because we all know that all Slytherins do is play mind games,” Pansy said dryly, growing bored of Granger’s rhetoric.
That’s lovely, I mean, a bit creepy I’d say, but also lovely. Malfoy, you’re thinking awfully hard over there.
“What do you look so scared for?” Pansy said, hoping something embarrassing had happened to Draco so that she could use it to make him stop teasing her about how she’d spilled frog guts all over herself in Potions the week prior.
I’m so unbelievably happy to see that this book means so much to you all, because it means a whole lot to me. As many of you know, it was based on some of my real life experiences and relationships.
The next day, Pansy was once again disrupted in her reading by a certain blond Slytherin. This time, however, she was reading
“Well, lucky for you, you don’t have to,” Draco said deviously. He smirked as he reached down and freed Harry from his trousers and pants.
“You go on,” Draco told Pansy, barely sparing a glance toward her outstretched hand. “I just want to check something.”
I think I’ve heard that before. There are some crazy stories about you, Wood, having breakdowns after your team loses.
“I’m—I’m sorry. I didn’t know—I was just—” Harry stumbled over his words. He lowered his wand to his side, but kept it lit.
So, Harry, we already know that this “Quidditch for a Cause” is a Quidditch match between two teams made up of Wizarding World celebrities, and that all the proceeds from merchandise and ticket sales are going to charities, which is quite remarkable, but what else should we know about it?
Draco glared at Pansy again, but he seemed relieved that at least she was being quiet now. “Calm down. It’s not like he fucked me or anything, we just, you know, got each other off.”
Harry smiled widely, crinkles around his eyes and all, pleased that he’d made the other boy laugh. “Sorry, am I wrong?”
Harry immediately looked at Draco, who slid down in his chair as far as he possibly he could while his face slowly pinkened.
“Draco, what happened? What did they do to you?” Harry asked seriously. He held Draco by his shoulders. Draco wouldn’t look him in the eye, and that scared him.
“Is writing poetry for Harry Potter,” Granger finished. It was clear that she was not impressed with Pansy’s explanation one bit.
Yes, I’d say we’re all very passionate about SPEW and organizations like it. SPEW is especially important to the wizarding community because…
“Sorry?” Pansy said, genuinely confused. She subconsciously took a few steps backward. She had heard the story of Granger punching Draco in third year, and she did not want to be close to this girl when she was in a confrontational mood.
Alright, folks, this is it. The moment you’ve been waiting for. The Bolts and the Wings are lined up on the pitch. Harry Potter is acting as team captain for the Bolts and for the Wings, it’s Oliver Wood. You all know Wood, of course, as a professional Quidditch player for the English National team. But both teams have two professional players, so it seems they’re evenly matched.
Draco breathed in and out deeply. How did he feel? He felt amazing. But also confused. And scared. But then, thinking of Harry’s lips against his own, he felt safe, happy, content. Basically, he was feeling a whole lot, and he didn’t know how to express it. “I’m okay, yeah,” Draco told Pansy, giving her a small smile. “I mean, I’m bloody terrified since I don’t know what this means, but. I’m good. He was just…” Draco laughed a little, caught up in his memories of the night. ”…perfect, and I know I’m not even close to being good enough for him, but maybe this could be the start of something. Maybe? I don’t know. Do you think it could?”
For Merlin’s sake, Potter, please stop talking. You’re being very rude, you know. Jasmine still has to answer the question.
“‘Course he is. Has been since second year. He’s not all that good at, admittedly. I mean, ‘eyes as green as a fresh pickled toad’? Not exactly Shakespeare. But hey, at least he tries.”
Other celebs who were spotted at the parade include- wait for it- yes, Harry Potter himself. He was seen with Pansy Parkinson and Scarlet Sinclair, a gorgeous couple we’ve been obsessed with for a while now, and his rumored-to-be boyfriend, Draco Malfoy. Let’s take a look at some fan footage.
Pansy made her voice deep and husky and put her fingers in the shape of circles in front of her eyes, mocking Harry’s glasses. “Ron, Hermione, please, you’ve got to help me,” Pansy said in the deep voice. Draco snorted and shook his head. “I don’t know what to do about my feelings for Draco. He might be out of my league. I mean, he’s so fit and blond and he sucks dick like Victor Krum.”
When I was an auror, I saw terrible things happening to LGBTQ plus people just because of who they were and who they loved, and nothing was being done to stop it. Something should be done to stop it.
“I missed you,” Draco confessed, sounding like he was about to cry. “I missed you, and I love you, and you have no idea how much I wish I could’ve just talked to you every day. It’s been so hard, Harry. I don’t know what I’m going to do.”
Harry turned again to continue up the stairs. He had made it a few steps when Malfoy’s voice stopped him again.
That’s true, isn’t it? Well, trust me, my wife and I will be at that match this summer and we’ll be rooting for you.
What Harry saw shocked him. Draco Malfoy was slumped against the wall of the alcove, velvet dress robes in disarray. But it wasn’t Pansy Parkinson’s hands that were groping at his robes, and it wasn’t Pansy Parkinson’s lips attached to Malfoy’s neck. It was a tall, black boy, who Harry thought he could recall wearing Slytherin robes, but he didn’t know his name. The boy stepped back from Draco with a start as soon as Harry’s wand illuminated the couple. The boy’s eyes widened when he looked at Harry, obviously in shock. His own silver robes were slipping off his shoulders and Harry absentmindedly noted that the boy was handsome, with sharp cheekbones and piercing eyes. The boy said nothing, didn’t even look back at Malfoy, before he ran off, darting down the stairs and out of sight within seconds. Malfoy was still breathing heavily, leaning against the wall.
Very good, very good. It’s so nice to see all of you here today together. A couple of you I’ve interviewed before, but it’s good to, you know, see all of you united to help these charities.
After the incident, Harry didn’t really see any change in Malfoy. He was the same with his ceaseless bullying and standard better-than-you attitude. Harry tried to forget the boy he saw on the staircase Christmas night, the boy who was vulnerable and insecure and oddly alluring. He had almost convinced himself he imagined the whole ordeal when suddenly he found himself being yanked by the arm while on his way to meet Ron and Hermione in the Middle Courtyard. He was dragged into a nearby empty classroom, and he was about to take out his wand to defend himself when he realized he was face to face with Draco Malfoy.
Pansy looked up at Draco from her place on the common room sofa and smiled mischievously. The boy was rubbing the back of his neck and looking at the floor, altogether appearing quite nervous.
Are you friends with Zabini as well? I know you’ve chosen to support his ex-boyfriend’s charity in your upcoming “Quidditch for a Cause.”
“Herbalists, not herbologists. And, I mean, they could have named the salve Snarfatuber, but I don’t think that’s much better.”
And while the Seekers go for the Heavens, Marcus Flint just scored for the Bolts, making the score 160-150!
No, nothing at all. I was just thinking of the time you told me you support the Appleby Arrows solely because you love apples.
I’m really glad that Harry asked me to do this game. So far most of what we’ve done is just gotten into a groove with our teammates, but I can already tell this is going to be a blast. And I’m also pretty confident that it’s going to be a victory for the Wings.
“Completely.” Pansy, having had enough of this argument, stormed off to another bookshelf. Just her luck that Granger would follow.
“Dumbledore wouldn’t be so foolish. And it’s not right, letting him believe Snape is on his side still when we know about this.” Harry’s eyes pleaded with Draco.
“Fuck, I really messed this up. I didn’t mean to make it seem like that—I don’t—I just want you to see me for who I am, Potter. I don’t like how shocking it is to everybody when I do something nice. And when I say everybody, I mostly mean you, of course. Not that everything is about you! My world doesn’t revolve around you, but—but for some reason it’s really important to me that you at least see the real me. I don’t know why. This is stupid. This whole thing is stupid. I’ll quit bothering you now, Potter.”
Oh, I’m not worried about the competition at all. We’re a good, solid team. And, you know, even if somehow we lost we’d still be doing something to help people who need it.
Harry Potter! It’s a surprise to see you here tonight. What’s with the impromptu trip to a fashion show?
“Your egg. Put it underwater, and—” Draco spoke slowly as if he was explaining the instructions of a craft project to a toddler. Harry interrupted him before Draco could get any more patronizing.
“What’s it to you, Potter?” Draco said, sounding defensive as his flushed face turned pink. “Going to go tell all of your Gryffindor friends that I’m a poof? Laugh at me in the Daily Prophet as some sort of sick revenge for all I’ve put you through?”
Actually, oddly enough Scarlet isn’t a big fan of makeup. She does doll up every once in a while for date night or events and stuff like that, but mostly she doesn’t wear makeup. Though since I’ve named this line after her, she promises she’ll use it, so maybe she’ll start being more of a makeup girl now, but probably not.
Granger kept looking at Pansy in that skeptical way of hers, but she didn’t argue with Pansy’s words. “I don’t get it. Why would Malfoy develop feelings for Harry of all people?”
Well, what’s basically gonna happen is that there’ll be two teams, like you said, of celebrity players, and each celebrity will pick a charity to play for. The winning team will get 75% of the proceeds to be split up amongst the charities chosen by that team’s players. The other 25% of the proceeds will be split up and given to the losing team’s charities.
Draco shrugged. After a quiet pause, he asked, “Um, now that you know about the thing with Harry, can you help me?”
Yes! Potter and Malfoy are right next to each other! Hands outstretched, they’re both so close to a win!
“What?!” Pansy practically screamed, causing the other few students left in the Slytherin common room that late at night to turn their heads toward Draco and Pansy. Draco immediately covered Pansy’s mouth with his hand and glared at her.
Draco ran a hand through his hair (he never did that, too afraid of messing up the hour’s worth of work he put into his hairstyle in the morning), a sure sign that he was overwhelmed. “It wasn’t a fight. It was- Well, what happened was- I didn’t think- I mean, I could never have predicted-”
“Yes, treacle?” Harry hoped to cheer up Draco with the use of the old pet name he gave him last year.
“Yes. And who knows? If you ever get over your fear of Slytherins, maybe we can have some fun in broom closets of our own.”
“I know you’re not going to out me if I don’t help you. I know that much about your character, at least. But it turns out I’m not a horrible person either, Potter, as surprising as that may be to you. When people are kind to me, I return the kindness.”
The Quidditch match of the year, “Quidditch for a Cause,” is now only two months away! Not only can you see your favorite celebrities, like Ajay Abbas, Naomi Amsel, Hugo Medina, and- of course- Harry Potter, but you can also be donating to multiple charities all at once!
“Okay,” Draco relented. “You can tell Sirius. I don’t know how safe it is to write to him, but you have that mirror, right? That should work.”
Draco smiled in amusement (or secret fondness) at Harry. “Bubolump is a type of salve. It’s made up of Bubotuber pus and Snarfalump seedlings.”
“Actually, we have to not tell anyone. We can’t tell Dumbledore, especially not about Snape’s involvement. He’d just confront Snape, and who knows what would happen then. Nothing good, that’s for sure. Snape might kill Dumbledore on the spot to get the job done.”
“I thought me helping you was giving advice. You need something else? Merlin, you’re getting greedy now that you’re a superstar’s boyfriend.”
“I’ve quite figured that out already, Malfoy.” Technically Harry hadn’t known about the underwater singing part, but Malfoy didn’t have to know that. “But why are you telling me this?”
Yeah, they know. I think it was a bit weird for them at first, but now he’s- I mean, they’re- the biggest fan and supporter of the book.
Eventually they had to pull back to breathe. Harry stared at Draco’s bottom lip as he panted, fascinated by how red and kiss-swollen it appeared. Then he looked up at Draco’s eyes, and he nearly broke down; the boy looked at him with so much earnest trust and love. He pulled Draco back, just to hug him. Draco melted in his embrace.
it wasn’t your choice. I’m sorry that it happened to you, baby.” Harry brushed away the few tears that escaped Draco’s eyes with his thumbs. “I still love you.”
Well, no matter who inspired you to write the book, I think we can all agree that it’s fantastic. Tell us a little about your upcoming book tour.
“By ‘them’ you mean the love bites that Harry Potter gave you, correct?” Draco kicked Pansy again, and Pansy smirked. “No, you can’t see them at all,” Pansy assured him.
Draco met Harry’s eyes and gave him a watery smile. “You’re such a Gryffindor,” he said fondly, despite the fear in his eyes. “But it’s bad, Harry. It’s really bad.”
Wow, and Ron and Weasley is one of Harry Potter’s closest friends. What does that tell us about Drarry? That it’s real?
Pansy watched as the two boys laughed at each other’s stupid jokes and shook her head. They had both fallen arse over tit for each other. Anyone who couldn’t see it must be blind. (Or at least in need of glasses. Like Harry.)
Harry’s heart almost stopped, and he abruptly remembered why he had been so worried about Draco in the first place, worried enough to sneak into his compartment to check on him. Borgin and Burkes. Draco’s left arm. He dropped their embrace.
“Potter,” Malfoy said simply, as if this was a normal thing for him to be doing, pulling his supposed worst enemy into an empty classroom for a quick chat.
Well, I’ve heard that Ginny Weasley has chosen to play for your foundation, POWER, in Harry Potter’s “Quidditch for a Cause.”
“Why’d they give it such a shitty name? Herbologists are terrible at naming. They should never have kids.” Draco was smiling in that amused way again, making Harry ask, “What?”
“I’ve just remembered that I need a book about Unicorns,” Pansy announced to Draco and Harry. Neither seemed to care that she was leaving- a good sign.
Draco gave her another one of his infamous glares, and Pansy decided to back down. “Pansy doesn’t know what she’s talking about,” Draco told Harry.
“I’m not scared!” Draco squawked indignantly. (Draco would wring Pansy’s neck if she told him that his voice sounded like a squawk, but whatever, it was true.)
“You did what with Potter?” Pansy hissed at Draco. She grabbed his arm, french manicured nails digging into his flesh.
Yeah, um, and I think the person who inspired me to write this book would be thrilled to see you all here today as well.
Definitely this one, “Silk Robe.” I think it works well with all the other colors in the palette, it blends beautifully, and I’ve been wearing all the time. I’m wearing it right now, actually.
Pansy’s jaw dropped. “You mean to tell me that your mouth was on the Savior of the Wizarding World’s dick?”
Draco nodded, satisfied, and looked down at the book Pansy had set down. “Oh, I was just reading this a few weeks ago! It’s actually rather interesting, the way Marinus analyzes botany’s relationship with magical creatures and potions.”
“The mark,” Harry said immediately. Draco sucked in a sharp breath. He realized Draco probably thought that it would change how Harry saw him, which is why he pulled away. Harry rushed to assure him that was not the case. “Draco, I don’t care about that. We both knew this was a possibility last year. And I know—” Harry stepped over to Draco and turned him around with a hand on his shoulder. Draco was looking at him with those big, tear-filled, beautiful gray eyes. “I
“Harry, I have to show you something,” Draco said, staring out the window with a frightening degree of stoicism.
“What exactly is Malfoy doing with Harry then?” Granger asked, the tone of her voice implying that she thought Pansy wouldn’t have a good answer.
Draco fell into Harry’s arms and tucked his head between Harry’s neck and shoulder. He placed a kiss on the underside of Harry’s jaw, and Harry smiled.
Pansy’s hold on Draco’s arm loosened, and he used the opportunity to pull his arm away from her. Pansy wasn’t fazed by the action though, she was too busy being shocked. “Did you give him a blowie?”
Pansy gasped. “What happened? Give me details! Was it a fight?” She pulled Draco next to her on the sofa as she bombarded him with questions.
Harry grabbed Draco by the arm and pulled him up from the seat so they were standing chest to chest in the small compartment. Harry had the fleeting thought that he was glad he still had an inch on Draco before he dived in for a kiss. Draco responded eagerly, wrapping his arms around Harry’s torso as soon as Harry released his grip on Draco’s arm. Harry held Draco’s head and held his waist. They kissed as if they had been apart for years, and honestly, for Harry, it felt like it had been.
Chaser Angelina Johnson for the Bolts has just tried to score- and Wood’s blocked her with a masterful Double Eight Loop! The Quaffle is now in the hands of Dean Thomas!
“Fine. Take a minute then.” Draco crossed his arms and looked around at the rest of the common room while he let Pansy process. He caught sight of the only three other students left in the common room at a table near the windows looking out into the Black Lake. When he realized the students were pointing at him and Pansy and whispering amongst fits of giggles (must be sodding third years, giggling like that), he gave them his most condemnatory death glare. The students quickly stopped their whispering, packed up their things, and rushed up to the dorms.
I already have stated a million times that Astoria Greengrass and I are strictly friends. Yes, we dated publicly, but that was a small, very brief thing. The relationship that my book is based off of is not a small thing. It’s big, it’s real, it didn’t happen because we were just doing what was expected of us. It happened because it’s meant to be.
And there it is! The chase for the Snitch is on, Potter in the lead but not by much! Ooh, looks like Beater Naomi Amsel for the Wings has just sent a Bludger straight toward Potter! That girl has impeccable aim, but Potter is moving at a very high speed, will it hit him! Looks like it will! Oh! In the last second Potter pulled off a difficult Sloth Grip Roll to avoid it!
Aw, how sweet. Oh, Harry, I’ve just realized we’ve yet to ask you which charity you’ll be playing for in “Quidditch for a Cause.”
Lacking the Gryffindor courage to stay another moment, Draco fled the stairway before he could meet Harry’s gaze again. Heaven knows that would probably kill him.
What? Oh, what am I doing here? I’m supporting SPEW, a wonderful organization started by my good friend, Hermione Granger.
We’ve been managing. We’ve been seeing each other as often as possible, but obviously I’ll be very excited to come back home to, uh, them.
Draco kicked Pansy under the table for the slut comment, then turned his neck toward her for inspection. “Can you see them at all?”
Oh. Well, now that we’ve got you here, do you mind telling us what you’re wearing? That’s really an impressive ensemble you’ve got on.
Oh no, nothing like that. We’ve just asked our Hexer followers to send in questions they’d like you to answer, so it’s not really a game, just a Q&A bit.
“Oi, Potter!” Pansy called. Draco’s head instantly snapped up. He looked first to Pansy, and seeing where her gaze was focused, he turned to see that Pansy was indeed talking to Harry Potter. Draco kicked Pansy, three times harder than he had before, but Pansy ignored him and kept waving Harry toward their table. Harry, for his part, seemed greatly confused. He looked back and forth between Pansy and Draco about a million times before hesitantly walking over to join them.
Pansy rolled her eyes as Draco delved into an academic rant that was much too Ravenclaw for her. She boredly looked around at the other students milling about in the library, and when she saw Harry Potter searching for a table to sit at, she grinned wickedly.
“I’ll just—I’ll just go then, I guess,” Harry said awkwardly, not knowing what else to do. He turned to return to his route to Gryffindor, but an anxious voice stopped him.
Yeah, I think this painting is one of my favorites. It’s called “The Embrace.” It’s showing, well it’s supposed to show at least, that even though the world beats us down love can still redeem us in a way.
Pansy left. Harry and Draco were now totally alone in the compartment. Draco closed the blinds on the compartment door to prevent the students scurrying down to the platform from seeing in. Then, he turned and sat on the bench opposite of Harry’s place on the luggage rack. He looked right up at him, though Harry knew he was still hidden from sight under his cloak. That knowledge didn’t prevent his breath from catching. Draco knew. He had to. How could Harry be stupid enough to think that no one would notice him?
Maybe it was embarrassing for Harry to admit, but, hey, it had been a whole summer of sexual frustration and a depressing lack of Draco around to relieve him.
So tell us about this piece here. It’s not a very well known work of yours, but it’s very intriguing.
Draco nodded almost imperceptibly. His eyes cleared as he thought it through more thoroughly. He looked at Harry. He was nervous, for some reason. He slid his hand up Harry’s arm and rested it on his shoulder.
“Everyone knows Ginny wrote that.” Granger leaned against the bookshelf and stared Pansy down in what was probably supposed to be an intimidating way.
I love Lou because that character is kind of the noble one, you know? And that light that’s in Lou balances out Sawyer’s darkness. But Lou also has a little darkness too, so the two of them really understand each other. I think it’s real beautiful the way they fit together, like they’re meant to be. That, and, of course, the fact that Lou is based off of someone I know and love deeply in my personal life is what makes Lou my favorite.
The Quidditch match of the year is almost here! And there’s still tickets left! Don’t give up this chance to see your favorite stars out on the pitch and give to multiple charities pass you by!
Pansy grinned upon noticing Draco, glad to have an excuse to drop her textbook on the table. “Well if it isn’t Draco Lucius Malfoy, the great slut of the Slytherin house. To what do I owe this great honor?”
“Well, it didn’t seem to alarm any of the others,” Harry noted. “I guess you’re the sharpest of the group.”
“Oh, we have loads of time, I’m sure.” Just then, Draco rolled his hips firmly against Harry’s , and Harry gasped. “Not that we’ll need it,” Harry added. “I could probably come from just this.”
Yes. We’ve mutually decided that what’s best for the two of us right now is to keep our relationship private.
the way Cedric told him to mull things over in hot bath water? It was probably just Harry. Whatever. Harry didn’t need to think about that. He needed to think about the egg. The egg, right. Well, it was hard to think about the egg when there were the most awful slurping noises coming from a nearby alcove.
“You said Blaise doesn’t know if he likes boys, but you do know? And you do? Like boys?” Harry’s brain tried to get him to stop talking, really, but Harry’s mouth was not listening.
Honestly, I don’t think I can give you any “deets”, sorry. If you want to know about Draco and Harry just ask them, not me. I’m totally not their spokesperson. Or, you know what, ask Ron Weasley, he loves talking about Drarry.
“I don’t make demands! You’re the one who goes ‘Harry, I’m so sorry for that. I just had to because there were people around. Please, Harry, let me blow you and make up for it—’” Harry said, imitating Draco’s puppy-dog-begging-tone which he had heard many times before.
“Apologize,” Malfoy repeated. “You still think I’m a horrible person, I can tell. So I’ll just tell you now that I’m sorry. For all the teasing and names and overall awfulness. I guess I can admit now that it was really just a flawed way of getting your attention. My own shitty version of pulling pigtails in the schoolyard or something like that.” Malfoy’s face was red by the end of his spontaneous apology, and when Harry didn’t respond right away, he lowered his gaze to the floor in between the two of them.
Oh, no. That’s not what I- I just meant that neither of us are pining for each other or any shit like that by this point.
Harry sighed. He threw the Invisibility Cloak to the compartment floor and jumped down after it. He stood in front of Draco, who was looking infuriatingly smug with a little amused smirk on his face. Harry wanted to kiss it away.
That’s some pretty damning evidence, huh? If we still haven’t convinced you that Drarry is real, wait until you see this other video taken yesterday.
“I missed everything about you, actually,” Harry said. It was true. He hadn't even been able to write to Draco this past summer, as they both knew it was too dangerous. He missed Draco's face and body and physical presence, of course, but he also missed Draco's mind—his words and his sarcasm and his precious confessions of love which he rarely gave out. He knew Draco got flustered when Harry was so honest about his feelings, which was partly why he did it. Draco looked up at Harry, a challenging look in his eyes.
Merlin’s fuckin’ beard! The Snitch is going straight for the ground! The Seekers don’t let up, though!
Malfoy looked at Harry blankly, a dazed look in his eye. Harry oddly felt a surge of arousal, which he ignored resolutely. Malfoy shook his head quickly, seemingly trying to clear his head.
In case you couldn’t tell what that was, it was Draco Malfoy hugging Harry Potter, who looks very comfortable in his arms. Does this mean Malfoy and Potter will be coming out about their relationship soon? We don’t know, but we sure hope so.
My fans aren’t that crazy, I don’t think. There was someone who named their kid after me, but other than that everything’s pretty mild.
Alright, so with me I have Harry Potter, famed savior of the Wizarding World. Harry, what are you doing here today?
Don’t let us ruin the romantic atmosphere, boys. Hey, how’s your romantic vacation going anyway? Lots of fun?
“What?” Pansy said. “You can’t just drop a bombshell on me like, “Hey, just FYI, I sucked Harry Potter’s dick,” and expect me to not need a minute to process it.”
“Well, fine then. If you want me to go back to being a bitch to you, then that’s fine with me. Stupid Potter. Can’t bring himself to take advice from a Slytherin, even if it could save his life. You know what, if you die in this task, you deserve it. You’re such a stuck up prat.” Draco spat the words, glaring bitterly at Harry.
Okay, moving on. According to your fans, if the character Sawyer is based off of real life you, then the character Lou must be based off of a real person too. Someone you’re in love with. Is that true?
Pansy wasn’t sure what Granger was so upset about. “You know, like you do when you like someone. I think they’re working their way up to a date.”
“The egg. Your egg. Your clue or whatever. I found out what you have to do. You have to stick it underwater and listen to it—it’s supposed to sing to you or something.” Malfoy’s pretty eyes were wide and expectant, like he was waiting for Harry to shout ‘Eureka!’ and praise Malfoy for his shared wisdom.
Right, of course. I’ll be playing for Theodore Nott’s new charity, which advocates for LGBTQ plus rights in the Wizarding World.
You know what? I think Pansy probably got lost finding that glass of champagne. I’m going to go see if I can find her. Nice talking to you.
Now come on, I was just about to hear about the most important player on the team, stop interrupting the story.
Well, I’m certainly not single. My husband is playing at the match too, and he’s probably watching this interview right now.
Well myself, first of all. But right now I also have Keeper for the English National Quidditch team, Oliver Wood, and his husband, Marcus Flint, captain of the Falmouth Falcons.
“A reminder,” Pansy repeated, and Draco nodded. “Whatever you say,” Pansy said, still sounding weirded out. “I’ll go get the concealer and bring it back here, okay?”
Granger looked truly infuriated hearing that. Pansy took another step back. “Is this some kind of sick joke?” Granger demanded to know.
No, I’m not giving away anything, even eye color. Though I will say their eyes are… good. They’re really good eyes to have.
“Fine. Not scared, flustered maybe. Did you run into Potter in the loo and get a boner from seeing his dick or something?”
“Done?” Draco then asked, suddenly wishing to go back to his own dorm and fall asleep to the memory of running his hands through Harry Potter’s hair (Draco had discovered that Harry’s hair was unfairly soft, despite how obnoxious and tangled it appeared, and he never wanted to forget the feeling of burying his fingers into those curls.)
I noticed that you’ve not said whether this someone is a boy or girl, which leads me to my next question. Many of your fans adamantly believe that you’re in a secret relationship with Harry Potter. Is there any truth to that?
“Okay. Thanks, Pansy.” Draco sounded genuinely grateful, so Pansy smiled and gave him a kiss on the cheek before getting up to go fetch the makeup.
“Fake? A poser? A liar? Manipulative? An all-around deplorable human being? Yes, to all of the above.”
“Yeah, well,” Draco said, pulling his collar back up and blushing. “Anyways, I know you have that makeup, so can I use it?”
“Okay, whatever, Malfoy. But why are you trying to help me in the first place?” Harry asked the question like it should be the obvious question to ask, because, of course, it was. In his mind the only way Draco Malfoy would ever offer him help was if he was held at wand point and threatened with wicked hexes to his perfectly-styled hair.
“Harry, no. Trust me, I’ve thought about this from every angle, and no matter what, someone ends up dead. Me, or Snape, or Dumbledore, or my parents, or even you, Harry. And I just can’t—I can’t be responsible for it, Harry, please, just—” Draco broke off. His eyes were once again full of unshed tears, these ones coming from a mixture of frustration and grief.
“Alright! Alright! That’s enough of that, Potter,” Draco interrupted, his face now flaming red. He looked down at the floor rather than up at Harry’s face.
“Honestly, Granger, what the fuck are you on? I thought you of all people would know that cocaine is banned at Hogwarts.”
“I’m helping you, obviously, Potter. Forgive me for thinking you’d need it, but let’s be honest, your last task was far from smooth.” Malfoy looked put out by Harry’s admission that he already understood the clue, and he crossed his arms petulantly.
Pansy wandered aimlessly among the shelves of books, absentmindedly wondering what she’d wear to Draco and Harry’s wedding. She’d been doing this for only a few minutes when a walking mess of curls interrupted her daydreaming with a sharp, “Parkinson, what is the meaning of this?”
“Draco, if it were safe for us, I’d want to tell everyone about us. I don’t care what people think about it, even Sirius. I doubt he’d be upset; he knows what it’s like to want to diverge from pure-blood expectations. If he is, I’ll fight him on it. I’ll tell him how wonderful and intelligent and brave you are and how much I love you.”
Ginny’s brilliant, so is Dean. So am I, if I may say so. I definitely think we’re going to win this match, easy breezy.
HufflePinky112 asks: “What does Scarlet think of your new makeup line? Does she use it? By the way, you two are cute together.”
You know, there’s some speculation that Lou is based off Astoria Greengrass. Do you care to comment on that?
Yes, but I’ve got loads of other leads, and I think I’ll be able to find all the people I need by summer.
Draco met Pansy’s questioning gaze, hesitancy and guilt in his eyes. “I never said it wasn’t a Potter thing.”
How do you Like it so far ? I'm trying to follow the books pretty closely but maybe I should make it even more far off from canon ?? idk
Harry looked to Draco for confirmation and Draco shrugged. “I found the subject matter interesting,” Draco explained. “I’m not, like, a Potions nerd or anything.”
Granger didn’t seem at all bothered by Pansy’s comment. She simply cocked her hip and said challengingly, “Are you saying I’m wrong?”
“Come and sit with us,” Pansy said, speaking to Harry in an overly sweet way that he was unfamiliar with. “There’s a free seat right next to Draco.”
“Hm? Oh, yeah, I suppose. Just, this is- Draco, this is big. You’ve been wanting Potter for how long now- four years? I mean, how do you feel? Are you okay?” Pansy’s hand was back on his arm, this time in a comforting way.
Harry fights against the need to punch Smith in the mouth. It won't do anything to help Ron, and Auror brutality is exactly the excuse Smith needs to get out of this.
“Fine. If that’s the way you want it to be. But I’m not going to come down here again. It’ll only make things worse. For both of us.”
“You are such an idiot, George Weasley.” Angelina doesn’t quite manage to keep the affection out of her voice.
The small back room reminds him uncomfortably of Mrs. Figgs' sitting room back at Privet Drive. It's run down and smells of dust and cats.
“Yes, I have time. I had Molly pick her up, but the Pensieve in the Department of Mysteries is being used for some very important research. It won’t be available for at least a few days.”
Harry watches him rubbing at his face with the tissue. Like he can wipe off the memory of being felt up by a suspected Death Eater.
“What’s important?” Ron looks up from where he’s sitting at the kitchen table with a plate of biscuits and Mr Granger’s laptop.
“One of my mates mentioned something about ‘em. Says they’re goin’ to rid us of all those Mudbloods running the place.”
He probably should. The whole day’s been a fucking disaster. Savage didn’t really shout, she just looked at him in a very disappointed way that made him squirm, and then asked some horrifyingly embarrassing questions. The meeting took about half an hour, but it felt more like decades.
The old man reaches for a dusty protocol, and uses a huge magnifying glass to search for her name. Apparently he finds what he’s looking for, and slams the book closed with a thump and a cloud of dust.
Draco shakes his head. “Not anymore.” he steps closer, forcing Harry to take two quick steps back into the shadowy corner behind the shed. Draco follows him.
It feels like his head has only just hit the pillow, when something drags him back to consciousness. At first he thinks it’s just rain on the window, but then there’s a soft hoot, and the tapping picks back up. The cold floor under his feet wakes him up enough that he’s able to open the window without fumbling and let the owl in, together with a freezing gust of wind. It’s not one of the bedraggled Ministry birds that usually delivers the bad news when he has to go into the office during his time off. In fact, this owl reminds him painfully of Hedwig. It’s a little bigger and more angular looking, but just as majestic. It flies into the room, shakes a shower of icy water from it’s feathers, dumps a small envelope on his bed and flies back out, before he can even offer it a treat.
Harry watches as Malfoy steps onto the yellow-brown hearth rug, and a dust cloud emerges. He pokes it again with his shoe, and Harry can't help chuckling at the look of horror struck fascination on his face. He's suddenly glad their drinks were strong enough to disinfect their glasses slightly. He eyes the vial in his hand. It looks clean enough… He wipes the neck of it on his sleeve before drinking.
“I think I’ll leave the detective work to you, Harry,” Hermione says. “I promised Ron I’d come and see him as soon as I brought you here.” She gives him a quick hug and a kiss on the cheek, and leaves. Harry suddenly feels exposed. Sitting in a comfortable chair in front of the fire and having a civil conversation with Malfoy seems like one of the strangest situations he has ever found himself in. He flounders for something to say for what seems like minutes after Hermione has closed the door behind her.
“Look, I know Percy is a class A idiot, but he’s still the Minister. He’s our boss,” Harry whispers.
Getting into Azkaban is almost as difficult as getting out, Harry thinks. In theory, he has access because of his job, but, in reality, he still has to get Savage’s permission, in writing, which means slaving for hours over how to word the scroll. When he finally gets summoned to her office, just before tea time, he still has to spend almost fifteen minutes convincing her that it’s a good idea. And then he has to sign a three foot long scroll of parchment detailing everything about the visit, and wait for everything to be confirmed with the prison guards. Insisting on bringing someone along doesn’t exactly help. Especially when that someone’s name is Draco Malfoy.
“I… Yes. Yes, I trust you with the information. And of course I can keep a secret! As long as it’s not something illegal. I don’t particularly want to be fired,” he adds.
“You have no idea what you're talking about,” Draco says. All emotion is gone from his voice,like he has given up on his father all together. Harry doesn’t really blame him after Lucius’ words, but there’s still something unpleasant twisting in his guts. Like he’s an intruder, witnessing a very private moment. The moment where a father and a son finally realise that they’re not family in anything but name.
Draco’s busies himself with tea and mugs, hiding his expression in a cloud of steam and a curtain of shiny hair. Harry holds his breath.
“She went back to work.” Ron grins. “She was a bit flustered. She was ranting about Percy's plan to put us in the front line for publicity purposes, and mum overheard.”
"What was that?” Bludger’s wand goes up and he turns sharply towards the window. Harry holds his breath.
Harry has squeezed his chair into Ron’s cubicle so they can go over the books together. The dusty tome from the Department of Mysteries might be clear of Dark magic, but it’s still almost humming with an unpleasant energy which feels like bugs crawling all over his skin and makes him want to wipe his fingers clean every time he turns a page. He surreptitiously rubs his hand on his thigh, and instantly regrets it, when the warmth of his palm through the thin fabric of his trousers reminds him of last night. He quickly dismisses the thought of warm hands that aren’t his own, and shakes his hand to get rid of the tingling feeling.
A part of him wants to ask Draco not to go at all, or to take him back to Malfoy Manor and the soft armchair in front of the fire in his study. He shakes his head. “I’ll be fine.”
“The day after tomorrow. Election day. At the party, after the polls close. One candidate’s a halfblood and the other’s a blood traitor, so no matter who wins, this place is going to be crawling with Mudbloods.”
“I’m not,” Draco repeats. “I want to see where this leads. I just don’t think that it’s a good idea to go any further while everything else is still so chaotic.”
“Oh, I’ve missed real breakfast! Why do they always serve things that taste like parchment in hospital?” he muses. He’s still chewing, and Harry watches in fascination as a few flakes of sugar dusted pastry escape his mouth and land on the tablecloth.
“He has a cottage in Wimbourne. Works for the Wasps. Seems that Quidditch and crime go hand in hand in this family. I can find the address for you, if you want.”
The way father and son stare at each other is so intense, he has to fight the urge to squirm or fidget with the tiny buttons on his sleeve. Finally, Lucius gives a minute nod.
“Who are these people? The same meeting place? You’d think they would know we’ll be watching it. Actually, this is stupid enough, it might be a trap. Are you free to assist me?”
The two mediwizards obediently start walking towards the Floo, but Ron stops Cho with a hand on her shoulder.
“So, he apologised for being a bully at school and told me that he was glad the Department of Mysteries sent me, because he knew I could handle the job. I Ward the excavation and keep the Muggles from noticing the huge trial trenches right under their noses.”
Davies is on duty again, but this time he’s wearing a Muggle police uniform, and Harry is glad that Ron had the good foresight to cast glamours on their robes before they exited the Floo in the nearby apothecary. They nod at Davies and his partner, and slip inside before anyone in the street starts paying attention to them.
“The healers don’t know what to think. They’ve moved him from the General Ward to the Curse Unit.” Her voice trembles, and Harry reaches out and pulls her into a tight hug, wishing he could keep it all away from her by hiding her in his arms.
“Aurors. I think your definition of fact checking is a bit liberal.” She levels them with a look so stern it makes Harry feel like a first year standing in front of McGonagall. “But I suppose you did get valuable information.”
With another sigh, he crumples the parchment into a small ball and throws it in the rubbish bin. He makes his way to the bathroom and takes a quick shower. The hot water makes him remember the feeling from last night of strong hands trailing over his back and lower, and his cock starts to fill. He gives it a couple of lazy tugs, feeling the tingling warmth start to rise and spread, but he really doesn’t have time for a proper wank. Instead he turns the water to cold and thinks about work. He reaches for a clean towel, but the rack is empty and the hamper is overflowing. He dries himself off with a couple of quick swipes of the not-too-clean towel next to the sink instead, and shoots a drying charm on his hair, making it stick up even more than usual. He throws on a pair of jeans and the first shirt he lays hands on, which happens to be an old Chudley Cannons t-shirt Ron got him for his birthday a few years ago. He really, really needs to do his laundry as soon as he gets home. He covers the obnoxious orange shirt with his robes and steps into the Floo.
He really doubts that, but having some of the blame shifted off him makes his tense muscles loosen up a fraction. At least Ron doesn’t blame him.
Harry rubs at his face. Fuck! As if a visit to Azkaban, having a drink with Malfoy and visiting Ron in hospital isn’t more than enough for one day. It’s almost tea time, and all he wants is to go home, order pizza and go to sleep. And now he has to go and have biscuits and polite conversation with McGonagall in order to use the Pensieve in her office.
“It’s all right, Blimpy. We understand you were scared, and we’re not angry that you hid from us. But we need to know if you saw anything. When your mistress was killed, did you see who did it? Can you describe them to us?”
Orkney is just as windswept as Dartmoor, but a lot colder and more misty. The wind is whipping around them, threatening to blow the cloak away and reveal their legs. They’re standing in some sort of maze made by stone-slabs. Harry looks around. He can’t see Bludger and Tall Bloke anywhere, but he hears rough laughter in the distance, the sound of glass breaking on the stone. Probably one of their beer bottles.
“Savage tried to talk me into taking a week of leave, but I wouldn’t hear of it. I’ve rested more than enough!”
“Thank you, Potter.” It’s nothing but a mumble, but it’s enough to make Harry’s lips twitch up into a tiny smile. He hurriedly hides it in a cough.
“Bloody hell, Harry!” Ron chuckles. ”Savage is going to bite your head off!” He walks over to the stunned figure on the floor. “Help me turn him over!”
“You have about twenty minutes before the potion wears off,” Hermione says. “You’ll have to see where they’re hiding the pages and find an excuse to go, so they won’t get suspicious and hide them somewhere else.”
Fuck! He hadn’t expected Malfoy of all people to be that candid. Of course he can keep a secret–if he wants to. But does he? So far, he has had no reason not to trust Malfoy. Hermione is usually an excellent judge of character, and she seems to get along with him. On the other hand… this is Malfoy.
He nods and sinks deeper into his chair, hating that he’s so fucking transparent in front of a suspect, and with Savage standing right outside, but grateful for having Ron as his partner. The ice is beginning to make him feel almost numb, and he listens with a sort of detachment, as Ron picks up his line of questioning.
Harry considers it. He’d sent a message to Savage before Apparating them to the Bearded Witch, but he should probably check in to see if Smith has started talking. And they need to view the memory Lucius gave them. On the other hand, he‘d promised Hermione to stop by as soon as he's back, and he wants her to view the memory with them.
Malfoy’s office is at the very end of the corridor. The door is open, and the room beyond is bathed in pale winter sunlight.
Draco flips the book open. Somehow they've moved closer together. So close that Harry's arm brushes against Draco's and sends a tingly shiver down his spine, when he leans in to take a closer look.
Donovan laughs. It’s an ugly sound, ricocheting off the walls in the empty corridor. “I knew you weren’t the poster boy everyone makes you out to be. He’s in 23.”
The lights in the club are dim, and the air is filled with multi-coloured smoke. The only well lit place is the small stage in the back, where a band is setting up. He spots Hermione and Ron at the bar, where Ron is talking animatedly to Seamus. Harry slips onto the stool next to Hermione, slinging an arm around her back in greeting.
“Fucking hilarious! Got a bit of course, that’s all.” He does his best to sound contrite, and somehow it’s beginning to come more naturally. It must be fucking exhausting to be Jamie Cadogan, having to listen to those two comedians all the time! “Let’s just hide the sodding thing and get back to the pub!”
“Yes, he will. He should’ve listened to the Head Auror, though,” Hermione says. She’s tying her hair into a ponytail, and her sentence breaks into a huge yawn.
“Or I could just wait for you three,” Ron says, his voice uncharacteristically quiet. “I’m not sure I’ll be able to see anything anyway.”
Malfoy rests his elbow on the table and props his hand against his chin. Harry’s eyes are drawn to the way his long, slender fingers wrap against the smooth skin on his jaw. He has a sudden urge to lean in and kiss him, to taste the skin and discover if Malfoy is really as clean shaven as he looks, or if there is a hint of invisible, blond stubble against his lips. Fuck no! Thinking about kissing Malfoy is bad. Very bad! He’s only had the two drinks, but it feels like a lot more. His eyes drift back to Malfoy’s face. He’s smiling, Harry realises. And his mouth looks a lot nicer when he’s not sneering. Pretty and soft, with lips that are just full enough to be kissable, but not pouty enough to be girly.
“Hermione couldn’t perform the spell, because she knows me too well. And I wasn’t going to let a random Unspeakable rummage around in my brain.”
Draco shows them the way to his study again. Harry watches Ron’s face, as he takes in the surroundings, noticing all the small differences. The portraits are whispering to each other and pointing.
“It doesn’t look too serious… It’s not even a real break, just a few cracks. I can fetch you some Skele-Gro from home, if you want…”
“Look, Potter. I agree with you. But I have orders too.” She shoots Ron a look. “The Minister wants to make an impression this close to elections. It's important to him that the public knows that we're taking this seriously. Sending in a full team of Aurors will make the front page of the Prophet."
Fucking hell! He really needs that Firewhiskey. Or a swift memory charm. Perhaps Hermione will help him. She's pretty good at Oblivating people. No. She probably wouldn't react too well to that suggestion, even if he was insensitive enough to make it.
Lucius? Fuck! Of course. He goes over Jamie Cadogan’s statement again. ‘According to Bludger, our orders come from Malfoy.’ The ice melts just a little, and he listens avidly as Ron asks the next question.
There’s an elbow to his ribs, and when he looks over at Ron, he can just about make out the outline of his wand arm, and hear a whispered spell aimed at the windowpane. A tiny portion of the glass vanishes. Enough to feed a concealed Extendable Ear through. Ron hands him an end piece, and he quickly stuffs it into his own ear and sees Ron do the same. Then he turns his attention back to the people inside.
At first glance the bedroom looks undisturbed. But then Ron casts a charm to draw the curtains on the modest four poster bed aside, and there she is. Adrienne Wright. She’s wearing a baby pink dressing gown and fuzzy slippers. And it looks like the cause of death is the same as it was for her brother. There’s a gaping wound in her neck and a crusty pool of dried blood on the sheet.
Lucius standing in a room full of patterned chintz and doilies. A fat, white cat is winding itself around his legs and purring. He tries to charm Adrienne Wright with smiles and gentlemanly manners. He tries to reason with her and appeal to her pure-blood upbringing. He tries to buy the information with gold. Finally, he loses his temper. A terrified house-elf is hiding behind an overstuffed, floral armchair as he threatens her with the wrath of the Dark Lord. Adrienne doesn’t even hesitate. She just asks her house-elf to escort their guest to the door, and before Harry knows it, Lucius Malfoy finds himself being unceremoniously dumped at the doorstep, and the door slams shut behind him.
They fly in silence for a long time. They’re almost at the channel, when Draco steers his broom closer and shouts over the wind.
Harry has to admit, he’s not too far off the mark. He stops bouncing his leg, and crosses off another box on the long questionnaire he’s working on. There’s no guarantee that Draco will even want to talk to him, he reminds himself. And even if he does, it’s not going to be an easy conversation to have. But just the thought of being able to finally apologise and try to make things better is making him jittery. And sort of nauseated.
“To get my hands on the Chalice of Infinite Magic and use it to drain the magic from as many Mudbloods and half-bloods as possible. Then help him transfer the magic to him, and get him a wand.”
The young man looks up at Harry for the first time, curiosity written all over his face. Harry can tell exactly when he is recognised.
The thought of Draco being worried makes him sort of dizzy. Apart from Ron and Hermione–and Molly, of cours– he’s not used to people worrying about him. It used to make him feel sort of claustrophobic, back when Philippe used to urge him not to go on assignments because it made him worry. He’s not feeling claustrophobic now. He leans in and brushes his lips over Draco’s cheek, inhaling that winter fresh scent again, and whispering into his ear.
“Yeah, I know.” Ron crosses his arms and kicks at the carpet. “I still wish I could tell Mum,” he mutters under his breath.
“It’s good to be home! Sit down and grab a mug. I’ll put the kettle on.” He’s making a sort of twitchy motion as if to reach for his wand, but then he shakes his head with a rueful smile and gets up to fill the kettle.
“It’s a moot point. Due to your undignified lifestyle choices, the Malfoy line is going to end with you.”
Heal it? He looks down at his arm. A light cloud of steam is rising from the sodden and scorched remains of his sleeve, and underneath, the skin is red and blistering. A dull throbbing, different and somehow even worse than the sharp pain from before penetrates the numbness. He starts unbuttoning his shirt with shaking fingers, but fuck, it hurts now, and his legs are getting sort of wobbly from the adrenaline rush. He slumps against the edge of the desk and blinks up at Draco, trying to figure out how to move his hands.
They move towards the hut at a slow, crouching jog. The adrenalin rush begins to override the cold, and he can hear his own heartbeat in his ears. When they reach the window, Harry flattens himself against the wall, watching in the faint light from the window, as Ron’s translucent body melts into the stones next to him.
He wakes up a while later, half hard and restless from a dream he can’t quite remember. All he can recall is flashes of white blond hair and broad shoulders. He wills the erection away. He’s been thinking far too much about Malfoy since he and Ron went to Stonehenge. Bloody Malfoy and his stupid ability to get under his skin.
The only reply is a round of curses and hexes. The Death Eaters are not used to fighting, and Harry ducks and swerves easlily.
“I had a little run in with a stone wall. And a Reducto curse,” he adds, when he realises that he still can’t really feel the fingers in his left hand.
“Harry, it’s a Veritaserum statement! You can’t just go up against something like that on a gut feeling.You’ll need real evidence.”
Harry peeks around the door. The room is completely changed. The scraps of paper are gone, and the books have arranged themselves into neat stacks on the floor. A few tomes are glowing faintly, indicating that there are pages missing. He skims the titles; Sonnets of a Sorcerer, You & Your Owl, Secrets of the Darkest Arts… And a leather bound diary. He picks up Sonnets. The title page is partly ripped and glowing. He puts it back. Ron is thumbing through You & Your Owl. He holds it up for Harry to see. The glowing is concentrated on what looks like a beak mark on page 56. Which leaves the diary and Secrets of the Darkest Arts. Not exactly surprising. He reaches for Secrets, thinking that the diary is likely the one they want, but wanting to check anyway. Hermione stops him with a hand on his arm.
The memory swirls around them, and Harry is dimly aware that Draco’s hand is shaking against his. He gives it a small, reassuring squeeze. Then the memory clears again, and they’re absorbed in the shadowy scenes once again.
Draco shakes his head. His lips curl up in a tiny smile, and he looks at Harry through half lidded eyes. “I meant that it’s inviting. It’s got a certain warmth to it,” he says.
The interview room feels even smaller than usual with Smith glaring at him from the chair. Harry resists the urge to rub at his eyes. Instead, he stands up and paces the few steps from wall to wall. He really doesn't want to be here. He wants to go and see how Ron is. As far as he's concerned, Smith can rot away in a holding cell until tomorrow. He glances at the clock on the wall behind Smith. It's been almost half an hour. Someone will be here with the Veritaserum soon, and then he'll be able to get out of here and check up on Ron.
“Er, yes. Right. I will. Thank you.” He picks up the bandages, and starts wrapping them around the wound. No. He’ll have to remove more of the fabric first. But a cutting spell isn’t really an option. He looks around.
Ron ends the spell and he blinks a few times, trying to gather some moisture in his dry, itchy eyes.
They are handed an old bottle cap and a used bus ticket, before they’re allowed to enter the building.
Ron has wheeled his chair over to Harry’s desk, and is shooting him worried glances, like he’s afraid he is going to march down to the cells and blow open the door himself.
After about an hour, Harry gives in and casts a Warming Charm. At this point, the risk of being discovered because their teeth are clattering too loudly is probably greater than the risk of being discovered by a Sneakoscope or magic detection charm. And besides, there’s no sign of activity anywhere nearby.
The door to the kitchen is slammed open, and warm yellow light spills out into the grey winter afternoon.
There’s a fire glowing in the ornate, marble fireplace, casting a warm orange glow on the muted gleaming dark wood and the floor to ceiling bookshelves covering three walls. Speaking of gleaming things... Harry glances at Hermione and, sure enough, she has that hungry gleam in her eyes that she always seems to get around books that she hasn’t read yet. She looks at Draco, and when he nods and sends her a small smile, she runs her hand admiringly over the spines of leather bound tomes, and traces the golden letters in one of the titles with a fingertip.
“Yeah. You’re probably right. You are right.” A small laugh bubbles through him. He feels like an idiot. “I’m sorry for being such a whiny git. We should keep our heads clear right now.”
“Yes. Of course we can use my Pensieve. But I’ll have to Floo ahead. The elves will be startled if I bring guests without notice, and Mother might be having visitors.”
“Er… still no magic, but at least I’m not in hospital.” His tone is casual, but the stoic look on his face isn’t quite convincing anyone.
“Mother will probably congratulate me on having three Order of Merlin recipients and aspiring Ministry employees as my guests,” Draco answers. “Weasley, I hope you’ll excuse my uncle. He hasn’t really kept up with the times. Understandably enough, since he's been dead for half a century.”
“Yes, but I want to hear it from you. She doesn’t think like an Auror.” He shoots Harry a quick grin.
“Er,” Harry says. “I nicked Mum’s.” His heart is racing and he’s desperately trying to come up with a reason why Jamie Cadogan would have to steal his mother’s wand.
Voldemort finishes ranting about magical blood and instructs Lucius to find him the artefact that will allow him to drain the magic and use it as a weapon to slay his enemy.
“Right,” Ron is already heading for the door. “We’ll see if Cadogan can’t give us an idea where to find the other two, and send a team to Orkney to secure the crime scene.”
He decides that writing a memo for Hermione will save him a lot of time; no one is let into the Department of Mysteries without having a barrage of spells shot at them and signing a three foot long non-disclosure agreement. Then, he summons a fresh cup of tea and starts on his report to Savage about his trip to Azkaban. He is trying to determine how many details of Draco’s conversation with his father he wants to put in when Hermione pokes her head in. Harry rolls up the parchment, and gets to his feet, grabbing the vial off his desk.
Malfoy’s office is nothing like Harry has imagined. It’s a room in a converted workers shed, with shelves along one wall, and a large table. A Muggle laptop is in the corner, almost covered by rolled up sheets of drafting film.
Harry groans and fumbles for his wand, before he’s even fully awake. His head is throbbing, and the dim, misty morning light seems more piercing than the fiercest sunlight. He finally manages to close his hand around his wand and Summon a hangover potion. The small vial comes zooming out of the bathroom, just in time for him to realise that his once-honed Seeker reflexes are not what they used to be. The vial hits him in the chest with a dull thump and lands safely in the bundled up duvet. He unstoppers it and gulps down the contents before the foul smell can make him change his mind. The vice-like grip on his temples eases up immediately, and the light seems to dim down to a bearable level. He throws the duvet off and pads into the kitchen. There’s some orange juice in the fridge and he gulps it down greedily. One of the perks of being single–Philippe always hated when he drank out of the bottle, even if he threw it away after.
Harry wakes up gasping from the feeling of soaring through sweltering air, with a pair of strong arms clinging to his waist. He stays perfectly still for a few moments, just breathing in the cool air of his bedroom and remembering that he’s safe in his bed, away from fiery monsters and imminent death. Judging by the weak light and muffled street noise seeping through the curtains, it’s early morning. He groans and rolls over, pulling the alarm clock closer and blinking at it, until the numbers come into focus. It’s nearly seven, and they’re meeting Malfoy at nine. He might as well get up.
“I... “ Draco runs a hand through his hair, making it stick up in uneven tufts. Harry sort of wants to reach out and pat it down. A dishevelled Malfoy must be against the natural order of things. Malfoy shakes his head.
“Mr Brigg? I’m Auror Weasley, this is my colleague, Auror Potter. May we please ask you a few questions about your brother John?”
“Yeah, okay. One of ‘em. The leader, he says he has this great plan. He’s going to steal their magic. The Mudbloods’.”
“Sure. Can we apparate to the gate and walk up? I don’t know if Floo powder will work for me, but Hermione’s Side-Alonged me plenty of times in the past,” Ron says.
“It does sound pretentious as fuck,” Ron says.  “But then again, so does ‘the Dark Lord’ and ‘Death Eaters’. Most dark wizards are just cocky little bastards, I reckon.”
“There’s no need to risk denting it, Malfoy. I’ll just admire it from afar.” He lowers his voice again. “And you’d better watch Harry’s back.”
“He didn’t. The ritual would be worthless to the Dark Lord, if he didn’t have access to the cup itself. My father didn’t seem to think it was terribly important.”
“No,  Auror Potter, Sir. No masks. But they were having the bad magic. Like before. In the skull. Blimpy could tell.”
Everyone giving them a wide berth and occasionally shooting nervous looks at Ron means that they’re able to speak in relative peace.
She huffs at him and lets go of his neck. Harry grins at Hermione over the top of her head as she stalks over to a pair of fluffy green socks and grudgingly starts putting them on.
Bludger laughs. “You do that. I’m not finding your bits for you, if you Splinch yourself by tripping in your shoelace.”
Harry is determined not to laugh, but he can feel the chuckles press up through his throat, and has to hide them in a very unconvincing cough.
“I’m not turning you down, Harry,” Draco says softly. A curl of warmth spreads through him at the sound of his name, spoken in that familiar, sophisticated voice. He looks up. Grey eyes stare back at him.
Harry whips around and sees Bludger turning to Disapparate, one hand grabbing the Chalice. Ron has seen it too, and is diving for it. He grabs at the Chalice, but only manages to graze it with his fingertips. There’s a blinding light, the echo of a laugh, a pop of Disapparition and then nothing.
Malfoy is glaring at them with his arms crossed in front of him, and Harry can’t help noticing that doing manual labour has been really good for him. He’s slender, but not as thin as he was at Hogwarts. His chest and arms are looking perfectly sculpted, even concealed under a thick black jumper. He also can’t exactly help agreeing that he has a point. They’re essentially asking him to be their research assistant, without offering him anything in return. Not even a basic level of trust. Ron is shifting in his chair beside him, undoubtedly about to say something less than nice.
Their teamwork is a well choreographed dance, as they work back to back, one of them facing the door at all times. It’s something that has been drilled into them since the first week of training, and by now it comes as naturally as breathing. They finish cataloguing the small living room in a couple of minutes and move towards the open bedroom door. The medical team have packed up and are standing in the doorway waiting for the go ahead to walk through the living room and Floo back to St Mungo’s.
"How's the case going? The sooner you solve it, the sooner you'll have the time for that date." Her smile is so excited, he decides that discussing it isn't really worth the fuss. Instead he signals for the bartender to bring him an Ogden’s.
“I keep some 600 mg tablets around for the patients. This should be enough to take the edge off, but not enough to let you do more damage by trying to put any weight on it,” he explains.
Fuck. He really doesn’t want to talk to Malfoy. He especially doesn’t want to talk to him about how Ron lost his magic because Harry thought Malfoy was still a Death Eater.
The Pensieve  looks ancient. The intricate runes are almost worn down by many generations of witches and wizards leaning over the edge of the stone basin. Harry shies away from thinking about what they’ve been seeing in here. Draco unstoppers the vial with his father’s memory and pours the silvery liquid into the dark Pensieve . They watch it swirl, and then the surface goes blank. They join hands before they dive in. Harry lets himself be grounded by the smooth pressure of Hermione’s small, warm hand, at the same time as Draco’s larger, cool palm resting against his own sends a surge of tingling energy through his body. He lowers his head into the basin and lets the curious sensation of not-wet water wash over him. And then he’s submerged in a shadowy world of memories.
“Yes. We probably should. In case.” He draws his wand and casts a spell that’ll make the boat stay in place unless one of them actually touches it. Malfoy layers his own complicated charm on top of Harry’s before he turns his collar up against the rain and makes his way toward the forbidding building looming in the distance.
“Then I am too, by being your partner. You’ll have to wait until tomorrow, and tell Savage that you’re shagging the bloke. Let someone else get his statement, and if he really is innocent, they’ll let him go.”
“Yeah.” Ron is reading over Hermione’s shoulder. “It says something here about a vessel for storing the magic. The Chalice of Infinite Magic.”
“Yeah. Savage'll want a full taskforce to handle something like this,” Ron says. He doesn’t sound too pleased about it.
“It was the people in the black robes. They talked about the book, and then they killed Blimpy’s poor mistress.”
“We need to find another copy of Secrets of the Darkest Arts. I want to read the page that has been ripped out.”
When he sees Draco, even the smallest doubt he’s had disappears. He’s so pale in the bright light that his skin looks almost translucent, except from the dark circles under his eyes. His hair’s almost as dishevelled as Harry’s, and his white dress shirt is wrinkled and dusty.
Draco lowers his gaze again, and his fingers resume their gentle stroking. Except this time, it’s more like a caress. Those fingers! He shivers and lets his eyes drift closed. The last bit of tension drains from his shoulders. This is the closest he has been to someone for a long time. The most intimate touch he’s felt since… he doesn’t even remember.
Please report to Level Two as soon as you read this. There has been a development in the case you are working on. Auror Weasley has been informed and is instructed to meet you at the Ministry.
A flash of a flooded bathroom. The water on the floor turning red. Harry can’t help the slightly hysterical bark of laughter that escapes him, despite nothing being even remotely funny.
“I haven’t been able to get a Portkey made. The house is Unplottable, so you’ll have to go by broom.”
Draco raises his wand and starts casting. Then he lowers it again, and flattens himself against the wall, casting nervous glances at the windows. “Shit,” he whispers. “The wards are already down. Someone’s here.”
“Really Ron? He’s right here,” he snaps. “And I’ve hit my leg, not my head. I’m capable of deciding for myself if I need to go to St Mungo’s!” To be honest, he probably does. But he bloody hates that place. Besides, they’re busy. Fuck! The New Dawn knows that they’re on to them now. They’ll have to move fast if they’re going to have any chance at all of getting to the Chalice before it’s hidden even better. And they still don’t know who the “boss” is.
The conference room isn’t free, but the small interview room on Level Two is. Ron takes the good chair, and Harry grudgingly sinks down in the uncomfortable one they usually give to suspects.
He offers Malfoy a basic rundown of the case, ignoring Ron’s scowl. He doesn’t mention anything about the New Dawn, or Bludger, though. He just tells him about the double murder, the missing book pages and the symbols found on both victims. Malfoy leans forward with his elbows on the table, and rests his no-longer-pointy chin on top of his folded hands, listening intently.
Draco walks over to the shelves behind the desk. He runs his hand lightly over the books and pulls one out.
“Bloody hell, this is disgusting!” Ron’s voice is slightly muffled by the Bubblehead Charm he has cast on himself. He’s looking at the dead man on the bed with an expression that’s more horrified than professionally neutral. Harry can’t really blame him. He casts a Bubblehead Charm on himself before stepping around the puddle of blood on the floor to take a closer look.
Ron is frowning at him. He makes that slightly constipated face that makes Harry hear sixteen-year-old Hermione’s voice in his head, lamenting the fact that boys have the emotional range of a teaspoon.
“This part is really interesting. It talks about a ritual to gain the magic back, if someone accidentally touches the cup. I don’t think my father discovered the wording, but there are many allusions to snakes and an ancient form of magic. Of course, that’s not exactly precise, because as you know, there are numerous ancient cultures associated with snakes.”
He opens the door to the Department of Mysteries. The room is empty, except for a bored young wizard in apprentice robes, guarding the door to the next room.
“Sounds like something Draco would say,” Harry mutters into his pint. He doesn’t stay for a second round.
“Yes. I did. I want to go to the match tomorrow. See if I can find out where they’ve hidden the Chalice. And maybe get the diary pages before they hide those too.”
“Thank you, Sir,” Harry says, and suppresses the urge to stomp on Percy’s foot. “Speaking of Ron, you’ll have to excuse me, Sir. I need to go and brief him about our latest case.” He nods at the reporters, and the cameras go crazy again. “...and on the fact that his brother is a complete wanker,” he mutters under his breath, as he escapes into the lift.
The dilapidated barn near the stadium is not the best place, but it’s all they were able to find at such short notice. Harry checks again, but no one seems to have noticed the three pops of Apparition. Not that there’s anyone about to notice, apart from a flock of sheep. He can see the sky blue silhouettes of the Tornados fans and the blood red of the Wanderers fans in the distance, making their way towards the small crop of trees that conceal the stadium. He looks back at his two companions. Hermione and Draco look totally out of place in their hastily bought Tornadoes paraphernalia. Of course, it had been Hermione’s idea to buy clothes that would make them blend into the crowd, if the cloak should fail them somehow. But the light blue of the jersey makes Draco’s eyes look almost blue, and Harry has to resist the urge to just stand there and stare at him. At least he doesn’t stare at his face. Instead, he lets his gaze wander down his body, past his lightly muscled chest and his lean thighs to where his feet used to be. They’re not there now. Knowing that they should be, he can just about make out their outline, when Draco moves, but that’s it.
Harry suddenly looked absolutely panicked when he returned his gaze towards Draco. He awkwardly cleared his throat got up to clear their plates, nearly running back to the little sink in the kitchen and asked, his voice a scratchy squeak, “so, how was Hogwarts?” in a valiant effort to change the subject.
Neville was sitting on the grass, looking up at Hestia, who was calling all the flowers in the West bed to bloom, foxgloves and lavender, sweet little tea roses amidst butterfly bushes, and a large hydrangea blushing pink and blues in the shaded corner beneath a blackthorn tree. A little arbor now housed a flush of jasmine flowers, fragrant and florid in the late summer heat. Neville had on a bit of a dopey expression, chin held in his hand, elbow on his knee, face full of wonder and delight, a shy smile on his lips. A dirt smudge ran across his left cheek, which was blushing a soft pink.
Draco rolled his eyes so hard it nearly gave him a headache. Harry was being difficult for the sake of it. He shouldn’t engage. This was clearly a tantrum. An absolute meltdown. But, oh how he wanted to pick at their discord, to let Harry’s rage grow into a fight he could partake in.
When Harry saw them now, he thought of them as harbingers of empathy. Of reminders that there is a world we cannot see, even if it is existing right alongside us, and that world holds mysteries we may never explain.
“Is that mallow root?” Draco asked picking up the herb and inspecting it. There were herbs on the counter, pots of honey, packets of gelatin, pans dusted with confectioner sugar, jars of fragrant vanilla, herbal infusions, bowls of whipped egg whites, it was a chaotic mess, and Harry looked like he was in his domestic element. Draco felt his heart tighten in his chest.
That night laying in a tangle of limbs with Harry, under his thick duvet he thought about what the future would hold for him, for them.
Draco began without preamble. “Hermione, you were right, there is a blood curse— it evaded all but one diagnostic spell, and even that nearly missed it.”
Lucius didn’t speak, didn’t look at Draco again, but when he began to shake and sweat from the constriction of the curse, he allowed Draco to wipe his face with a soft cloth. He allowed Narcissa to hold his hand and for them to care for him in his last hours as his breathing became shallow and pained.
“It does smell amazing.” He finally said, softly, carefully, his eyes closed, not wanting to give away the tightness in his chest, the difficulty he was having just with breathing, just with being so close to someone he wanted to take in his arms like he’d never wanted anything before. It was running down his spine and in his blood and for fuck’s sake he was hard and he didn’t dare breathe because all he could imagine was the growl within him escaping his lips and he had just told himself he wouldn’t do this. He wouldn’t.
He could hear the thestrals before he saw them, rounding the edge of the boulder, ducking beneath the last thicket of trees. There were thirty or so of them, though none of them bothered to acknowledge his approach. They were busy. Busy feeding.
Draco didn’t have time to dick about with ominous door carvings. He said with a loud and thunderous voice, “I am a Black, let me in!”
This is why he didn’t have friends, when someone tried to have friendly banter or tease him he just choked on his tongue, panicked on the inside, tried not to break out into cold sweats, and ended up being mildly rude. He was so fucking awkward, but to others, he was sure he just seemed surly and unpleasant.
“Mm?” Harry grunted sleepily. “Whas’ happening?” he asked, turning lazily in Draco’s arms to face him, to burrow into his cotton-covered chest for warmth, his eyes sleepy and his mouth slack. Draco smiled and breathed in the familiar smell of Harry’s hair deeply and tightened his grip around him. Holding Harry to him.
“I planted the seed a few days ago in an egg carton with some compost, like you showed me for the bean seeds. It sprouted the other day, and I think with some helpful growth magic, we’ll have ourselves a proper tree in a month or two.” Harry got up as he was speaking and grabbed the little bit of egg carton hidden behind the encourage-mint, giving the fragrant creeper a little rub before heading back, filling the little cabin with the joyful smell of corsica.
And yet, a quarter of an hour down the path, another thought approached, not so easily assuaged by the trust Harry had forged with his thestral.
“Draco, what are you doing here? What’s wrong?” Harry felt fear radiating off of him, and it gripped him, freezing him to the spot.
Harry sighed with relief and grabbed his jacket from where he’d dropped it on the floor. He rubbed the back of his hand absentmindedly as he ran down the stairs and out the door to apparate to St. Mungo’s. He didn’t notice the bruise that had formed.
Harry’s tight chest gave way to a dull ache. Draco had to be wrong. This was real. It had to be real. It was too painful to be chance happenstance, too consuming.
He sat at his desk, in his apartment, tapping his quill with increasing intensity, staring down at the little green post-it note.
Harry didn’t respond. He didn’t seem satisfied with that answer, but he didn’t press it. He just sat there fidgeting with the twigs and wet leaves strewn around him.
Harry looked, if possible, even more embarrassed now that Draco had nearly choked to death in front of him because of the question. “You don’t have to answer.” Harry hurried, his voice quiet and small, his shoulders rounding as he hunched over his plate of food, keeping his eyes downcast and obviously keen to avoid the issue and move on.
No, of course not. This was entirely medical and morbid curiosity. He just needs to keep an eye on Potter to ensure he’s healing. Right?
This curse was another one that festered— like Felix’s. Attacking Lucius’s magical core, wasting him. It progressed slowly, insidiously. It could have been counteracted in its infancy, when the mirror was first broken, but usually by the time the victim realizes they’re sick, it was almost always too late. And, in Lucius’s case, having been trapped in the literal 9th layer of hell that was Azkaban, he had been far too weak to fight it. If he hadn’t been imprisoned all this time, he may well have lived another ten years before anyone realized he was ill.
“Oh, no—” Harry laughed. “You’re not getting me to ruin your dinner plans for you.” He made a show of straightening Draco’s collar and smoothing the front of his shirt. “You haven’t spent time with Pansy in ages, and you told me— not two days ago— that you wanted her and I to get to know one another— so, this is
Sylvia’s funeral is the same day as Harry’s first DA meeting. He spent the whole morning at Grimmauld Place. Contained. Safe. Letting the grief take its turn. Take its flesh.
Like the one in the Death Chamber at the Ministry, but not one crafted by human hands and magic. This one had been created in nature, by the cave, maybe even by the
She was pretty enough, short blonde hair framing her pale, slightly sharp face. She had gold hoop earrings and bright red lipstick, her mascara thick under winged eyeliner. “You look like you could use some company,” she murmured, breaking the silence as Harry drank in her features.
“Are you saying you’re not usually a hopeless romantic?” Draco asked, a hint of disappointment escaping in his voice.
“Yes. Dinner. We’re one in the same you and I, more dragon than serpent. I think we could be good friends.” She smelled like cinnamon and dirt, and she reminded him, strangely, of Neville. Safe and inviting, surrounded by blossoms.
Draco had a welling sense of inadequacy rising like bile in his throat as he watched Harry try to string his thoughts together.
“Yeah.” Felix sighed, finally breaking his intense gaze to rub his eyes with his fingers, and he started his story in a rambling burst of information. “I wasn’t born a squib— I was born with magic. Started showing signs young. I remember doing things like making flowers grow or changing the colour of things. Turn on lights. Little things. My dad was a pureblood. He got into a fight with someone— I must have six— it was with an old drinking buddy— I walked in to see what they were yelling about and the bloke shot a curse at me— I woke up in St. Mungo’s. Said it had damaged my magic somehow. Stunted it. I can still do little things— light candles. When I’m feeling a powerful emotion sometimes I have episodes of accidental magic— Exploded a few light bulbs last time I was hospitalized— started a few toilet fires— It’s why I started using. Helps kill the magic I can’t control.”
The look shot right through Draco in the most pleasurable way “Famous is it?” Draco teased, realising how easy this was, how natural it felt.
Draco pushed himself up into a sitting position and picked mindlessly at a new cut on his hand that he sustained from his hike after stumbling through a bramble patch. He hadn’t worried to heal it yet, as it wasn't so bad. He couldn’t really be bothered. He could hear the soft sounds of another thestral approaching from behind him but didn’t turn around.
“For a hike.” Draco clarified, stupidly. Harry just tilted his head in curious contemplation as Draco turned to start gathering his things to leave the cottage.
He supposed he deserved it, though. And, he knew Potter hadn’t known what that curse did, Snape had told him. But still.
Perhaps it was his sunken eyes and sallow cheeks, the years of stress and loneliness wearing him down, trading his boyish physique for a sinewy, strained body of an Auror, the countenance of a man with too many memories for his years. Yes, perhaps it was that.
“Draco, my son—” Lucius croaked with a rasp and an attempt at an ingratiating smile. “Thank you, Draco, for coming to me in my hour of need.” He sounded fond. Proud, maybe. Relieved.
The coppery smell of the lab reminded him of the room where the wallpaper hung in rolls from the walls and he could stare up at the ceiling for hours, soft and quiet and at peace. No thoughts. Just breathing.
What the fuck had he done? Why did he push himself on Harry? Harry, who was just as scared of their intimacy as Draco. Harry, who had never kissed a boy before. Draco dropped his head in his hands, gripping his hair painfully, and cried out into the empty cottage. Little dipper hooting softly at Draco in response.
Her eyebrows were plucked and pencilled to perfection, and the edge of her short bob seemed to have been cut with razor precision. Her heels were dangerously tall, and her black dress far too short for the season. Her green fur travelling cloak draped across her shoulders and black felted cloche sat neatly on her head. Her burgundy lipstick and winged eyeliner put her in mind of someone going out on the town— or a hot date— not to a friend’s dingy flat in Hogsmeade.
As Harry left Seamus’s side to gain better ground, ducking low to hide behind a stone wall, a jet of green light singed his shoulder. The curse had missed him, but it left a tattered streak in the leather of Sirius’s jacket. It was though a vice had been placed around his heart and lungs, his vital organs squeezed incomprehensibly, his ears ringing with his own growling howl.
Draco checked to make sure Nurse Wallace was following his instructions to the letter and hovered his hands over Mr. Deklerk’s shuddering frame. “I’m sorry, Mr. Deklerk, please try and remain still while I perform some counter curses and while we ready a potion for you. I know you may be scared right now, but we are doing our best to help. Please hold on.”
“Healer Malfoy?” she queried hesitantly, waiting for his acknowledgement. He inclined his head in response. “There’s an urgent letter from the ministry for you, sir.” She scuttled forward and handed the heavy parchment envelope to Draco, whose expression gave nothing away.
Draco strode up the hall to the exam room and plucked the file out of the pocket on the door before walking into the room towards his desk. Opening the file, he felt complete and utter confusion wash over him before walking straight back out to Juniper with a furrowed brow.
Noise, laughter, chatter and bodies, lounging in resplendent, inherited glory. The smell of the crackling fire and butterbeer. Merriment and joy. A chocolate frog hopped across the wide oak floorboards at his feet, croaking gleefully.
” He stuttered, his voice more shrill than he would have liked, turning supercilious eyebrows onto Harry. The sock unravelling in his hands.
“I guess Grimmauld Place and our brown, one room attic, don’t really count as home do they?” Draco asked after the silence stretched between them a ways. He was itching to take Harry’s hand in his, to stuff them both into his pocket for warmth, but he wasn’t sure if he was allowed or if they should.
Draco felt an overwhelming wave of crippling apathy wash over him and he placed his forehead on his desk, thumping it down harder than he meant to, but not bothering to do anything more than grunt. His limbs felt too heavy, his head felt too light, and breathing still felt like a fucking chore.
“I won’t stay the whole time. Just a cup of tea, then I’ll leave you to talk.” When Draco still didn’t respond he slumped his shoulders and moved forward, reaching for Draco’s hand. “Come on, Draco, what’s the worst that could happen?”
“I don’t know actually, I usually leave the list in there at night before bed and empty it in the morning. Why don’t you find out?”
“Come, we’re going to be late for Hermione.” He chided Harry, shaking his leg under the thick blanket, earning him another groan, this one of disappointment rather than delight. Harry sat up, pulling the blanket from his face and torso and looked at Draco for a moment with curious eyes.
“C’mon, Malfoy, it’s too hot for you to be cooped up and bent over your cauldron today. It’s too hot to do anything other than be slothful.” He looked like an eager pleading child, so full of joyful anticipation.
“When did you make these? I never saw you working on them. I never even saw you dye these colors.” He said looking at Draco in amazement, like he couldn’t believe his eyes.
Nope. Draco couldn’t do this. Fuck this. Without even grabbing his shoes, he moved swiftly to the door.
“Oh, you’re getting so much better at this.” Draco crooned, reaching out to stroke the ridiculous black tufts of feathers. He nicked a piece of toast from the table and gave it to the damnably cute owl, whispering, “
It seemed they would go completely unnoticed until one of them began sniffing the air in earnest. Draco repressed a violent shiver of fear as the two he recognised began walking towards their hiding place, the third wandering out of site on the other side of the pond. “They can’t see us or come past our protective enchantments, Draco, we’re safe.” Harry intoned, keeping himself between Draco and the intruders.
Harry snorted in acknowledgement. It’s true, Ginny and Harry had parted ways at the end of the war with nothing but a hug and the promise to remain friends, and they had done just that. She’d gone off to play Quidditch internationally and had made quite a name for herself. Off the field, she was finding distraction in every new city she visited, fucking away the memory of the war with reckless abandon, letting the mouths of her lovers wash away the scars of a time and a place best forgotten.
The Manor, with its lush lawns and manicured flower beds, with its timeless beauty and haunted corridors. It was filled with memories and experiences that Draco spent every waking moment trying not to think about. How was he expected to ignore those haunted thoughts when his mother kept asking him to come and have tea in a room where Greyback and his lackeys had taken turns using him in their perverse weekend reveries. He swallowed down the taste of bile as he remembered sharp nails on his hips, teeth against the nape of his neck, and the smell of blood and sweat—
“We’ve been granted permission to see Lucius at 7:30am tomorrow. The Wizengamot didn’t want to yield, but there are provisions granting even war criminals access to due process and so called ‘
Every year, in early October, Ron, Hermione and he would come together and talk about the war. They’d sit with students and talk about what hate had done. Hermione always talked about house unity. About blurring the divide. She’d tell them all she nearly went to Ravenclaw. Some years, Harry would admit he was nearly a Slytherin. Ron never said anything at this part. Not until Rose was a Slytherin, and the Weasley dynasty officially broken. In her first year, he’d come to support her Slytherin Quidditch team in all green for the first game of the spring season. Hiss hiss painted on each cheek, Rose sitting on his shoulders, clapping and cheering, a massive serpent flag following wherever they went.
Next was a letter he wrote to St. Mungo’s, confirming his return date to work with an accompanying summary on his progress with thestrals and unicorns. He also included his intentions to consult with the DoM, clarifying that his work schedule would now have to accommodate their needs as well as his.
To his immense surprise, he felt Harry tugging his hand out of his pocket, and warm, calloused fingers entwining with his own. Draco turned a shocked expression to Harry, who was smiling slyly at him, his own cheeks tinged in an embarrassed sort of flush.
Harry’s voice carried across the little thicket they were trying to clear, which had obscured ancient stone rectangles that dotted the little area around the house. It was all thick with thistles and other weeds, grasses and wiry stemmed forest growers that were adamant they belonged. Harry hadn’t realised it was a garden until they had pulled apart the mass of blackberry bramble that had taken over the paths between the two closest raised beds.
“Honestly? No. I didn’t. I had a short list of names and suspicions, yes, and you, Harry, were on that list, but, as I said, I had hoped it wouldn’t be you.”
Harry chuckled softly. “I’m not either Draco. This is okay. The first time isn’t going to be full of all the kinks in the books, I’m not sure if you remember but I’m not exactly well learned in the art of gay sex. Or sex at all, really. Pretty shit at it, if you ask anyone I’ve slept with.”
“I know. But, tonight, I’ve come to join the thestrals. They can have me.” Harry replied, his voice sure and his hand steady. The adder merely huffed before the ancient door swung open. “I’m not sure that’s how it works, half master.” The adder hissed softly at his back as he crossed the threshold.
Draco moved on to the bed, climbed over him in the process. It forced Harry onto his back, scrabbling for purchase, trying to drag himself up to the pillows to get out from under Draco, but having nowhere to go. Looking ever more worried and confused.
“What was that?!” Greg yelped, still looking shocked and slightly offended, inspecting his hand for the offending wound.
His godfather. Sirius. That’s who this magic belonged to. And a ripple of pain cut so quickly and sharply through Harry, he sucked a breath in. For how much he missed him still sat so close to the surface, grief he had never known had to abate.
Harry smiled, still watching the flames. “Until the last one. That’s when I knew I wasn’t dead, and the words of encouragement weren’t for me.”
Harry opened his mouth to reply, thinking of course he couldn’t, no, that wouldn’t be possible. But, before he could answer, a stern Scottish voice interrupted his thoughts. “Of course he can, Mr. Lupin. I’ll keep Tuesday evenings at seven o’clock free. You can use this classroom after dinner.”
“Yes.” Harry said firmly, his voice muffled by the pillow. His body relaxing at Draco’s touch, his assurance.
So, here he was, apparating back to the stoop of Grimmauld Place, his pockets heavy and his thoughts light for the first time in what felt like forever. The berg adder on the door huffed and puffed at him, as usual, his tongue flicking as he berated Harry “
Looking around at the top of the steps, he saw it in an entirely different light. Now that he was no longer staying here, he felt almost fond of it. Almost. His large king size mattress was no longer in the corner, but rather a small, full-sized bed with a delicate floral pattern quilt and soft purple pillows. There was a small bookshelf acting as a bedside table filled with vampire romance novels and a few dogeared copies of
He could hear Ron asking Rose what in the world was going on as he shut the door and grabbed a clean pair of black jeans, his trainers and a passable but plain dark green shirt. He ran his fingers through his hair a few times, knowing it wouldn’t be doing much good in any case, and rubbed some flour off his own cheek.
Draco didn’t have an answer. He was awake most of the night, long past when Harry had fallen asleep, his face pressed into the back of Draco’s neck, his breath hot on his shoulder. Wondering. Agonising.
Draco snorted fondly as he walked towards him. So much, and yet not much, had changed in the intervening years. Their love had grown and matured, as had their wiggentree. It was stronger, solid like the bedrock on which their home sat.
Harry had thrown himself on to Draco’s mattress, groaning in delight, as soon as it had been unshrunk and placed against the wall in the cottage.
He dropped his quill and closed the file when he realized he was flinging bits of ink all over his desk. Sighing in frustration, he looked down at the worn grain of ancient walnut. He had found the beautiful piece at an estate sale in Kent— he’d nearly fought an old lady for it. Using his wand he cleaned the specks of smudged ink before running his hands over the smooth wood apologetically.
“That’s the idea.” Harry had just taken his first bite of the food, and he closed his eyes happily. It was delicious. Perfect.
“Easier said than done.” Draco laughed awkwardly, starting to feel a bit too warm and stifled. He was starting to fidget, hands compulsively searching for something to keep them occupied. Shredding leaves, pulling pieces of grass mindlessly.
charm, nearly midnight on a Sunday. He replaced the towel after drying his face and walked back to his bed. Climbing in, he vowed to not think of Potter or that day in the bathroom or how Potter’s eyes were full of terror and regret as he knelt down by Draco with shaking hands outstretched, blood swirling around the shower drain.
In the forest, coming back from the thestrals in the clearing, yeah, he had decided not to die, but he had been waiting these few weeks to decide if he did really want to live. And there was a difference, one he hadn’t thought about until that moment, with his letter of goodbye on the table and the one man he would’ve never trusted with anything, painstakingly nursing him back from the edge, not holding him to anything, not asking for anything.
By the time Draco was finishing off his hat, Persephone had slipped out to check on Luna again, Harry had fallen asleep, curled into his own corner of the sofa, and Porter was picking up the tea tray and walking it back to the kitchen.
Draco was watching Harry pull out the contents of his life onto the floor. No rhyme or reason to the organisation. Just bold determination and a pile of unfolded pants.
“They’re on holiday from next week, you know. You get me back for Tuesday nights.” Harry’s eyes were closed, and he had moved right in beneath Draco’s arms, still flipping through pages and scribbling notes. Harry felt so content. Full of love. Full of righteous and self satisfied joy at the life that they had finally managed to build for themselves. Together. The chosen one and the death eater. Names they had left behind. Legacies that paled in comparison to who they really were. Who their lives had carved them out to be. Who they had fought and struggled and so valiantly endeavoured to become.
“Similar to mother’s, yes, but you know she never made it herself, Pans, the house elves made it.” Draco said, smiling, remembering the amount of time they spent together in their youth. “Could you grab the sparkling? We can go sit.”
“Fine, be that way.” She rolled her eyes. “Either way, as lovely as your one-singular-date sounded, it concerns me how smitten you seem. What exactly does this Romeo want from you?”
“Draco.” Harry said, softly at first. But there was no response, his lips kissing further down his stomach now, his hands sliding toward the flimsy waistband of his bottoms.
He lifted his head as a juvenile unicorn wandered closer to his patch of grass, nibbling little clover flowers as he went. Draco watched the unicorn without real scrutiny. It felt almost pointless to even be here in this patch of grass among them. He fiddled with the corner of Hagrid’s folded letter and huffed.
“Yes, Potter, I actually insist.” He breathed out heavily. “Just please don’t be offended if I scarper again.”
They walked in comfortable silence, bugs flying up around them as they disturbed the undergrowth of the trees, frogs leaping out of their way, and a few thestrals picking their way after them. Soon, the canopy cover began to thin as the stream let out into a little clearing that nestled a beautiful pond against a rocky outcropping. The stream ran into this pool before continuing its path out the other side and down further into the valley. The far side of the pond was buffeted by rocks and boulders piled high with moss, vines, and water loving flowers growing thick in the crevices.
To his utter astonishment, Luna not only accepted his apology but gave him a hug which made him feel like crying and bursting out of his skin and fleeing. He hadn’t been hugged in, god, he couldn’t remember how long, and the touch was decidedly foreign. She said that she knew Draco had been just as trapped as she had been and in much more danger than she was. Her eyes were filled with a knowing look that bored through Draco’s soul and he avoided her for the rest of the year. He hated that anyone could know what had happened to him. It made it too real.
“It’s the weirdest thing.” Ron said, fanning steam away from the cooling mass of egg. “When we started digging, we found identities for about eight of the 22 people who had been living down there. And, so far, all of them had been regular Unspeakables at some point. Four of them had been legally dead— funerals and everything, obituaries in the paper. One had supposedly retired and moved off to Spain, and the others just went missing. And here they are, living in the bowels of the ministry. We closed a record number of cold cases.”
It was a few nights later when Harry lay staring at the now familiar rafters and hanging herbs, his sheets kicked from his sweaty legs in the sticky summer air. He had just woken from a dream, one he was desperately trying to cling to, to analyse, to make sense of. It was sixth year again, and he had been following Malfoy in the dead of night, tailing him with the marauder's map, hidden beneath the invisibility cloak. The familiar rush of excitement and enthusiasm for the chase had led him out of the castle and down to the edge of the forbidden forest. Malfoy hadn’t once looked back as he strode across the lawn and into the trees, his robes sweeping around his long legs and his blonde hair easily visible as Harry followed.
Harry rubbed his thumb across his wand, staring blankly at the cubical divide in front of him. He’d been like this for at least an hour, his magic tingling against his wand beneath his fingers, his mind far away and ruminating.
Eying a particularly large green praying mantis on the door, he forced himself to stand up straight and exude that trademark Malfoy confidence— he was an adult and would act like it. He finally reached out for the door knocker after talking himself up to it. What kind of door knocker was this anyway? It looked like a hippo with wings. Written above the door frame in golden cursive was a sign that read,
Came a tiny voice behind Harry, and he turned to see a small black snake with a yellow stripe down its back slithering around the half cleared garden bed.
When Unice saw what had caught his eye, she reached over to snatch the paper off the table to see why Draco’s face was glowering at them. As she read across from him her eyebrows rose higher and higher into her hairline. Surprise and incredulity evident in every line of her face.
“Aldora Runcorn.” Said the girl, her voice more nervous than her housemate’s. She looked up and down at Harry, much the same way Edgar had. She seemed to be waiting for Harry to hold her surname against her.
Teddy stopped his victory lap, his hair changing back to bright blue, much brighter even than it was when Harry had first walked in. “Really? That sounds like so much fun!”
Without thinking, Harry curled up against the leathery hide, surprisingly soft and warm, closing his eyes and fighting back against the dread that had filled him. He was still safe. He could survive this. He had come this far.
Draco found Greg slouched in a little spindle legged chair in the corner of the cafe. He looked too large for the tiny table with delicate flowers and miniature fragile crystal vases. Greg was looking with great concern into his coffee as if it had started speaking Greek to him. Draco wondered what he could have been contemplating so deeply as he sat himself down across from his old friend and startled him to attention.
Draco turned more fully to Potter. “Thank you— But, now can I ask you something?” His healer voice was coming out in full force. Potter looked startled and weary.
He sealed the letter and pulled another sheet of parchment to write to his mother. This time dipping a quill in an ink pot.
Harry stilled comically with huge eyes as the thestral continued to flap its wings around him, pulling him closer, as a hen does with an errant and disobedient chick. “I didn’t fucking mean it!” He yelled in defeat. “I didn’t mean it, and I’ll go into the meeting if this fucking demonic bat gets off of me!”
Draco shook the sheets at Harry to make him move and he moaned pitifully and rolled off the bed and onto the floor.
He ran his hands through damp strands of hair, falling along his forehead, covering his scar. How did he get here? How had this become his life? He was the chosen one, the golden boy, he was the hope and awe of the magical world – yet, here he was, feeling as though he may crawl out of his own skin with need.
“We can’t.” Draco said quietly into the silence, in response to their magic twining around them, it was like his new mantra he was chanting inside his head to keep him on track. To keep him strong.
They just stared at each other for a long, long time, while a look of dawning realisation slowly crept across Harry’s face. “Oh my fucking god.” Harry said quietly not looking away from Draco, and Draco working hard to maintain this intense eye contact and not burst into flames. “Oh my god.” Harry said again in complete disbelief, running his hands through his hair.
