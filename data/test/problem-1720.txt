“Just as insufferable as always! I should have known.” Potter isn’t the only one with a trick up his sleeve. Draco picked up Potter’s abandoned butter beer from the bench and with a jerk of his arm, splashes it in his overbearing face.
"Darling," His mother sweeps into the room. She's holding a piece of parchment, her face apprehensive. "This just came for you. It has a ministry seal."
“When have you been to Hufflepuff?” Potter leans forward, eyebrows drawn. He’s genuinely curious and Draco’s tempted to string out the answer and enjoy Potter’s rapt attention.
“We are under a lake, you know.” Draco casts a warming charm anyway, and does not mention Potter’s casual use of four-syllable words. “I suppose you think the Hufflepuff common room is like being buried alive, or an earth worm, crawling about.”
"I’m sorry." Potter directs the words to his plate, but there’s something determined in the set of his shoulders that betrays him. The confidence to be wrong and admit it without any superfluous details. It was what made Potter the man that everyone thought he was, even if he didn’t live up to it all the time. It was a heavy crown to bear. No one could live up to it all the time. "I didn’t mean to generalize. I’m working on it."
In the evening he sits with his mother in the parlor and allows her to tell Draco about his father’s condition. It keeps his mind from wandering, from watching the clock when it reaches seven and he hasn’t heard a word.
“Is that so?” The innocence Harry injects into his voice wouldn’t fool Peeves. “Then you must have an idea of where I’m taking you now.”
Potter still has his back to him, prattling on about some nonsense like an utter ponce. As Draco can't hex the prat anyway, he pulls his wand from his robes and deposits it carefully into the box. He gives Karrey a hard
“Alright, then.” Professor Hangingbone stops once they reach the end of the dock and clasps her hands together.
They don’t hold hands or anything so obvious, but heads swivel in their direction anyway as they walk through the halls. Harry brushes the back of hand against Draco’s as they walk, bumping shoulders,
“Oh.” Draco’s not quite sure what to make of that. The idea that Harry might have been talking to them about anything concerning Draco makes him nervous. “I guess that makes sense.”
“Excuse m--” Potter’s lips are soft and warm when they brush against Draco’s. They’re standing an awkward angle, connected no where but their lips, and yet Draco’s brain short-circuits, caught in a full body shiver that spreads from that single point of contact, out to every part of his body. Potter tilts his head just so, applying just the right amount of pressure and Draco feels his breath hitch. He’s entirely too aware of his need, his desperation, as he moves his mouth in tandem with Potter, until they’re kissing so hard it’s almost bruising.
“I’ve never really had time to consider it before. I think it started around The Cup.” He doesn’t need to elaborate any more than that. They both know which event he’s speaking of. “It was the first time I really realized there’s magic all over the world, not just Britain. It makes me curious.”
to go along with it. There were plenty of girls and guys, Draco suspects, vying for the opportunity to have Potter press them into the mattress. He can only imagine the damage it would do to Potter’s reputation if anyone were to find out he was shagging a former Death Eater. Not to mention the
He wills himself to think pleasant thoughts, but the memories are fleeting. Instead, negative thoughts crash over him like waves. The terror of it all makes him tremble, tempt him into occlusion -- just the way Snape had taught him when he was still alive, robes swirling as he bade Draco to try again, and again.
"At the moment, you're nothing to me." Draco swallows thickly. Potter has stepped closer now. The elevator can't come fast enough. "It doesn't matter anyway."
“So what you’re saying,” Hermione says once they’re done, “is that the two of you need to stick together so that you can keep interacting normally with everyone else without having emotional flare-ups, at the expensive of your magic.”
“Are you alright?” Ernie leans in, placing a warm hand on Draco’s shoulder. Draco turns to him. His blonde eyebrows are knit and it makes his entire face scrunch. Draco wants to laugh. Objectively, Ernie isn’t his type with his fair features similar to Draco’s own, but he’s handsome enough, and if Draco didn’t suspect that he was hopelessly straight, he’d would be tempted to make a go of it. As it were, he only nods, suddenly incredibly tired.
Karrey returns with two glasses, already sweaty with condensation. They both have identical looking drinks and no straws this time. The elf looks at them both as if trying to remember something. Then deliberately places one glass in front of Potter and the other in front of Draco, blinking rapidly. "Karrey hopes you will enjoy."
Blaise overhears them, propping an arm on the back of his chair. “And what are you doing then, McMillan, if it’s so boring to you? Trip to the moon?”
He angles himself towards Potter and their knees brush under the table. They both jump and Draco’s ears grow hot. "As this is our first meals as not enemies," he blurts out, "I'll ask that you not to do anything crass. Like molesting me under the table. Or folding your food in order to eat when there's perfectly good silverware."
“Please,” he answers. Draco feels he should probably warn him that Slytherins prefer their drinks strong and occasionally laced with Veritaserum. On the other hand, it’s Harry
The air around Draco shivers and the room fades, the foyer’s marble floor dropping away from beneath his feet. The familiar jolt of apparition wraps around his middle, and he clenches his eyes shut, pops of color flashing in the darkness behind his lids. Then it's over, and Draco’s body comes down. Hard.
"I just thought I’d make sure." Draco sniffs, settling back in his chair. He smoothes a hand over the upholstery. "Wouldn't want anyone to get the wrong idea."
Well it’s not really like he had a choice. Draco tried asking Headland and Abernathy about taking a weekend off, and had been told it would have to be an extreme circumstance, which would be nothing short of dying or kidnapping the savior and keeping him in this house.
“Get out of here, Malfoy, I don’t want to talk to you,” Potter continues. Besides him, Weasley moves to climb to his feet.
He didn’t know how to feel about the revelation that Potter might have been trying to look out for him.
“Malfoy!” Potter throws his weight into Draco, a sharp elbow digging into his stomach and knocking the wind out of him as they fall to the floor. The surrounding desks skid across the stone, their classmates leaping to their feet to break things up, and a few, to egg them on.
"What's this then?" Millicent, leans forward, tucking a stray curl behind her ear from where it's escaped her bun. "Did something happen before? Are they targeting us?"
So far, so good. Potter looks at home as he stretches to make himself comfortable. Broad shoulders strain the fabric of his jumper, fit to his actual frame unlike the oversized bags he’d worn throughout the years, and Draco fights to keep his eyes from lingering for too long. They’re just two people having an innocent conversation. Draco ought to be able to handle that much.
Patronuses weren’t used lightly -- most people preferred to send owls and notes to relay messages within the castle when necessary -- so waking up to the spectral form of Potter’s stag was nothing short of ominous.
He’d returned from his trip sometime in the middle of the night, with a well-behaved Grawp in tow, in hopes that visiting the Giant tribe to the north would cure Grawp’s most recent bout of homesickness. Apparently, it had been very successful, if a bit short, and the two brothers returned home in good spirits. Not a moment too soon, given Potter’s response to the other arrival of the morning. Draco hadn’t even left his dorm before Potter’s Patronus arrived to tell him he should skip breakfast and meet Potter on the edge of the grounds.
"It’s a Sainsbury. Isn’t it lovely?" Why Lovegood chooses to interpret the curl of his lip as anything other than blatant disgust is a mystery.She gives his arm a small tug, her grip surprisingly strong as she leads him down the nearest aisle. "Muggles will eat such wonderfully strange things. Would you like some Goldfish?"
“She’ll be fine if you can manage some meaty bits from the kitchens,” Draco says absently, turning the letter over in his fingers. It feels a bulky, and when he breaks the wax seal on the back, something small and shiny falls out into his palm.
Draco’s not sure why he’s disappointed. He examines the small fish between his thumb and forefinger. Better to let Lovegood go first.
Draco sniffs. "Far be it from me to explain the inner workings of Potter’s mind." The line inches forward. Draco swears he feels himself age. "If the best gossip to cross your desk is that I’m finally able to leave my home under the watchful eyes of DMLE escorts, you’re not getting enough work done."
The gift wrapping party goes on into the afternoon and the early part of the evening. Afterwards Weasley ditches his chess set for the new miniature Quidditch game his brother, the Dragon Keeper if Draco remembers correctly, and even Granger joins them, watching from the side as they break into two teams for a series of matches. Someone brings fresh pumpkin pasties and biscuits up from the kitchens, and the crackle of the fire fills the room with a profound warmth that penetrates the heart, sinking bone deep.
Within his robes, the glass vials clink against each other, bumping against the outside of thigh. He uses his wand and does a cushioning charm that doesn’t hold. Instead the tubes float weightlessly from his pocket, soft as a marshmallows when Draco grabs them out of the air.
Draco's quill moves so fast, his hand can barely keep up. He bends low over his work, sweeping aside the loose strands of hair that brush his cheek, and wills his arm, under threat of every deity he’s ever come across, to steady.
“I sleep enough,” Potter snaps with the kind of subtly that confirms he’d have been eaten alive in Slytherin.
“Haaa, Lumos,” Potter’s panting now, a small ball of light illuminating them just enough so that Draco can take in the flushed head, the precum at the tip. He touches a finger to it and a string of wet comes away when he pulls it back.
"I’m not a Slytherin anymore either, but that’s still a problem for you!" Draco rounds the bed, pajama bottoms in hand. He thrusts his naked arm under Harry’s nose. "Look at it. It’s there. It’s never going to go away." He yanks his arm back to tug on his pajamas, wrestling with the ties when they knot. He doesn’t know what he’ll do if he has to stay here another minute. "Someday you’re going to have to accept it. Or not. Fucking hell!" Draco gives up and pulls on his robe.
Unfortunately breakfast is much like the first six months of their reconstruction year spent at the castle. Since the incident with the hat, everyone has been keeping their distance, including the few people that would normally keep Draco company. Further down, on the other side of the table, Ernie looks up long enough to offer a sympathetic frown before tucking back into his meal. Seated beside him, Parvati sniffs and ignores Draco completely. Apparently the indifference of a charmed magical object made him even more of a social pariah than if it’d pronounced him evil incarnate. In their eyes, the fact that the hat had misfired made Draco an unknown entity, and with the war still fresh in everyone’s memory, no one was prepared to deal with that.
“Or me,” Draco adds with a sniff. “Potter’s the sort to come with a warning on a good day. Adding a crisis of sexuality to it certainly doesn’t help matters.”
“Who’s for more tea?” shouts Hagrid with forced cheer. He doesn’t wait for either of them to answer as he tops off their mugs and piles more cakes onto their plates. “I’m startin’ to understand what Hermione was on about. The two of ye’ bicker like ye’ been together for years.”
Most of the eighth year students are already seated when Draco walks in, chatting and joking as they prepare their quills and flip idly through their textbooks. However, there’s a noticeable change in volume as Draco weaves his way between the chairs, hands covering mouths in hushed whispers as eyes flicker over him and away again. Pansy and Parvati takes seats in the back of the room, nont too far from Potter who also sits towards the back of the room
They step into the fire and are gone, leaving Draco in the middle of the floor, alone with his thoughts.
Potter frowns but doesn’t argue the point, hands buried deep in the pocket of his robes. The intensity of his stare is unnerving. It gives Draco the distinct impression that Potter feels entitled to something.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Try to keep up, Weaselbee. It would seem that every time one of us does something naughty or
Draco glances down, unfurling the jumper to reveal the giant R knit on the front. The tail of the ‘R’ look especially sticky, smeared white. He shrugs. “It looks better now, to be honest.”
Draco is torn between embarrassed sympathy and laughing his arse off. Glancing at Potter finds he’s trying to keep his mouth straight as he spells Ron dry.
Harry pushed himself to his feet, nodding to let Malfoy know he understood. Wandless magic always zapped his energy at the best of times, and the Siren's song, as well as Malfoy's probing, had reduced his limbs to gelatin. But there was no choice.
Draco lifts a brow. If Millicent's surprised to be addressed so casually by a Gryffindor he's fairly certain she's never exchanged more than a sneer from across the great hall with, it doesn't show. Perhaps, Draco considers, true reticence shines brightest in the company of the socially reckless.
Pansy lifts a hand to rub his arm. Her sympathetic expression is almost comically insincere. They settle into a comfortable silence.
His breath ghosts across Draco’s lips, making him shiver with anticipation. He feels like his whole body is on fire, waiting for Potter to touch him. Wanting to touch him just as much. Draco knows he’d only have to tilt his head to press their mouths together, to taste him. Wants to run his tongue along the seam of Potter’s lips and steal inside.
"The straw?" Harry looks down at it. "I don't know what to say, it's a crazy straw. You drink through it." He sucks again to prove his point.
Draco startles. He hadn’t brought it up on purpose, but that was the reality of his situation. Being allowed back into Hogwarts to finish his education had been a hard won fight, harder still with the condition that he was to stay in line under Headmistress McGongall’s careful supervision. Draco assumed that was why Potter had begun following him around the castle again, taking it upon himself to make Draco his special assignment.
Draco continues buttering his toast. He’s in good spirits and awoke this morning feeling practically ravenous. He’s currently on his fourth slice, and if the combined Malfoy-Black blood didn’t ensure that he’d always remain svelte, Draco thinks he’d have reason to worry. “You do not. You love every excuse it provides you to decorate based on a theme.”
Draco feels a bit of the tension bleed from his shoulders when Potter makes no qualms about sitting next to him, their knees knocking as he settles into a comfortable position. He leans forward to catch Draco’s eye. “Are you any good at this?”
“Mr. Malfoy, front and center!” Professor Hangingbone’s voice rings out loud and clear, stopping him mid-step. “
“It’s sort of like a casting a Patronus, isn’t it?” Ernie murmurs to Draco. “Channeling your emotions to produce the results.”
"Mmm," Potter hums happily, and the theory quickly dismisses itself by virtue of his not being face down on the table. Relief settles in Draco's stomach, followed by a rush of warmth. Potter’s pleased moans are a thing of beauty, positively indecent. He’s tempted to let him keep going, but Potter isn’t the only one with a sweet tooth.
Draco allows himself a cursory sweep of Potter's robes, careful not to linger on anything... unnecessary. The fabric looks expensive: a deep jewel green, so dark they're almost black. Obviously bespoke. Perhaps Twilfits, or a designer from off the continent, leaping at the chance to dress the most famous wizard in Britain while charging him through the nose for it.
“O-oh, yeah. Right. Okay.” Potter’s eyes still seem a bit glazed as he leads Draco towards his dorm. They’re at the top of a set of steep stairs, with an excellent view of the grounds through the high, round windows. Potter opens the door to a circular room with four four-poster beds similar to Draco’s own room. It’s a bit cozier, a little messier with the open trunks and owl cages and robes draped over every surface, but there’s a homey quality to it like the rest of the tower that Draco associates with Potter.
“How’d you know I was down here?” Draco asks, just this once unable to keep the awe he feels around the other out of his voice.
Potter shifts awkwardly. He makes a Herculean attempt at his rock cake, but thinks better of it when the bit he manages to gnaw off, crackles like glass between his teeth. “She saved my life. Seems like the right thing to do.”
The saddest part of all is that Draco can’t say the idea hasn’t crossed his mind. On numerous occasions as of late.
of heels. “I’ve nearly finished my essay and if I don’t do it now, I’ll never get to my Charms work.”
He tosses it in disgust, shaking his head when footsteps come to a stop behind him. Draco really ought to have known. He’d probably watched the whole thing like some vigilante voyeur.
“Right.” Without another word she turns and stomps in the direction of the dormitories. “Harry!” Draco winces as she continues to shout, disappearing from sight.
“Oh, I wouldn’t dream of it, Malfoy,” Potter give him cheeky grin. “I may not leave at all. Your bed’s much more comfortable than mine.”
It’s eerily quiet. Draco’s face flames as he turns around. “This is all your fault!” He sneers, advancing on Potter.
“Two peacock quills. One porcupine..,” Scrivenshaft carefully examines each as he puts them into a bag. He adds another quick quill and three bottles of ink. “The total will be four—“
"Nothing that I blame you for. " Blaise glances around the room, perching himself on the edge of Draco’s abandoned chair. "Potter has nothing to do with the two of you running into each other all the time."
"Careful. I should have warned you, they're a bit strong. I don't know what it is about house, elves but they have a much stronger tolerance than the rest of us."
“Anyone up for a skate later?” Seamus Finnegan calls from further down the table. “We had to cut it short last time but now that Harry and Malfoy are mates, we don’t have to worry about cracked skulls!”
? You must think bigger, darlings. Perhaps here at Hogwarts it’s a touch unique, but what about other magical institutions? Other historical figures? There is a whole, wide, world outside these walls!”
“I understand, Professor," Draco says, turning back around. "I absolutely believe Potter should have a go at it. Right after myself, seeing as I brought it up.” He stands and walks towards her desk. “And I’m right here, after all. It’ll be quick, I assure you.”
“I have never been more grateful to know a freak like you,” Draco says, returning Harry’s smile with a rueful one of his own. “It almost makes me glad sixth year happened. Almost!” He hurries to add when Harry opens his mouth.
Potter settles back onto a cushion and stares. Draco’s breath quickens. Under Potter's ardent gaze, the flush spreads from his face and down onto his neck, an unflattering shock of red that contrasts with the silken silver fabric at his chest. With the way he’s got his gaze fixed so utterly on Draco, there’s no way for Potter to miss it. Still, Draco can’t bring himself to demand that Potter stop, insist he attend elsewhere. Draco likes being looked at when it’s Potter doing the looking.
Potter runs a hand through his messy curls and grins. "You too. Do you plan to actually eat something this time?"
“Hello, hello. Bit nippy isn’t it? She rubs her gloved hands together. “Well. As you all know we’ve been discussing Father Christmas, and the associated muggle traditions associated with him.”
“Well, I think it’s a good thing,” Granger’s hair is bushy as ever as she settles on the other side of Potter. Her sparkly red headband catches the light. “I suppose it was bound to happen in one way or another.”
Of course he says none of this out loud. Draco’s not looking but he can tell his silence makes his friends uneasy.
“No you’re not. You’ve been trying to restore your reputation, and people are going to take your feelings for Harry and assume it’s a stunt to make yourself look better. All the mess they’ve said about potions and love spells? And what happens when he decides to break it off?”
In an unusual show of tact, Potter doesn’t say anything, but claps a firm hand on Draco’s shoulder and squeezes. Draco meets his eyes and they nod in unspoken acknowledgement, understanding passing between them. Every day it feels more natural, the message loud and clear: they’re in this together.
“Well.” Old Scrivenshaft, from behind the counter, cranes his neck. His bushy brows lower as he eyes Draco with suspicion. “You’re in good spirits.”
"Draco. Go tomorrow. Talk to Potter. I can tell you with certainty that he'll be there." He flicks his wand in a quick tempus. "We have to go before Robards gets back to his desk. Come on, Lovegood, I'll treat you to one of those Beetroot drinks you enjoy so much." He catches Draco's eye over Luna's shoulder and shakes his head.
Draco frowns. He’s never heard anything like that. Glancing at the others, it seems they’re just as confused. Even Granger raises her brows at Weasley, who shrugs. Behind his glasses, Potter’s eyes are wide.
“Why you?!” repeats Hangingbone, shrilly. Her hair seems to fly about her face and she looks deranged. “You knew my sister. You were sat at that table and watched them murder her and you did
“Mr. Malfoy.” Another voice drags Draco from his thoughts once again. It’s not exactly a trend he’s keen to continue; not now when he wants to throttle Potter’s throat. Draco rounds on the figure than stops.
I don’t want to leave either. The words rise unbidden and traitorous to the front of Draco’s mind. He can feel Potter’s nerve, his hope. Draco thinks the thrill of excitement and the butterflies in his stomach are all his, though. Potter’s words are vague -- an invitation but nothing more, placing the decision in Draco’s hands. He’s just not sure that even if he accepts, that it might mean what he
To his credit, Harry looks like he tried very hard not to snort before he fails. He pulls Draco back down. “We’ll leave for Andromeda’s early. I’m sure your Mother’s looking forward to seeing you.”
“The real hat was specially designed to be worn atop Father Christmas’ head,  and his head only,” She explains as she encourages Weasley to mime the action. “But this charmed replica,” she continues, “can do the very same. We’ll have you all try it on for a lark to see if it deems you ‘naughty or nice.’” Her eager gaze travels over each of them in turn, Draco feeling something akin to dread when her eyes land on him.
Potter’s a bit slower to move over to him than Draco, but they squeeze in and Ernie scoots down to make room.
is a disambiguation, loosely based on morality fables for children and the life of Saint Nicholas. And while muggle historians acknowledge his magical background, what they
"Maybe he'll talk after all," Ron muses. The suspicion that Malfoy is well aware of the curse he is suffering from is an undisclosed secret in the hospital. Hermione knows about it and so does Ron. "In the face of death, he might change his mind."
At least that is the impression the Healer gave. Hermione nods and grins as she sips her wine again.
"I had to stay with him," Ron says almost apologetically. "Hermione apparated here with you as soon as you were capable, but Malfoy was completely headless. It took me over an hour to calm him down, even though I had no idea about your condition. Eventually he was convinced to cast the spells on himself with the Elder Wand."
"Although," Draco began slowly as he pulled away from the hug to slowly walk backwards towards his bed. "Come to think of it, the odds of Granger's team winning is frighteningly high. And that again means she beat me two years in a row. This is the greatest humilia–"
Harry laughed, then buried his nose in Draco's hair, inhaling his scent. Draco made a horrified sound and tried to break free, Harry knew how to prevent that. "Hmm, I smell alcohol with a hint of vanilla. No worries, it's intoxicating as usual."
much trouble it had really been. Draco didn’t comment on the apple any further, to Harry’s luck, but he let a smug grin shine through for a moment. Git.
Hermione a massive apology! This is just not okay." Ginny folded her arms across her chest and glared at them.
Harry turned to his side so he didn't have to look at Ron anymore and could pretend to be mad at him. Meanwhile, he grabbed the Marauder’s Map again. Draco had arrived at the Prefects’ Bathroom and seemed to be making himself comfortable. A little trip to the fifth floor couldn't hurt Harry.
To Harry, the words make strangely little sense. Instead, he feels the need to tell Hermione that something is wrong. He can no longer feel the cold but rather feels as if he is being carried away on a cloud of cotton wool. He is unable to open his mouth and tell the others about this intoxicating feeling.
"True. But it's been discovered that it wasn't him who was involved in the case," Arthur explains. "It was supposedly his fiancée who got hold of confidential information through him."
Everything in him cried out to just pleasure himself, to thrust into Draco and just do it, but something small reminded him that this was bigger than a simple fuck. “Draco, you trust me, don’t you?” Harry asked softly, right next to his ear, and could literally testify to the blond man’s emerging goosebumps.
For the first few days after the case was resolved, stories of devastated magical families being finally reunited with their children dominated the press. The tide turned when the Aurors revealed that pure-blood families had been providing cover for the trafficking ring and had been willingly involved with them. Strongly traditional families, in particular, had seized the opportunity to rid themselves of the burden and shame of a Squib child in exchange for a great amount of gold.
Relief spreads through Harry. That's all he needs to hear, any pain paid off with that. "What happened?"
On the agenda for the day was a pony obstacle course in the morning. This was probably one of those announced equestrian games where they could score additional horseshoe points. Harry looked forward to the whole thing with mixed feelings. Justifiably so, as it turned out a little later.
It is almost an ordinary day – Draco frequently acts withdrawn – but something is gravely different: whenever possible, and he thinks he is not being noticed, Draco's eyes are riveted on Harry.
"I wasn't one of those who figured out on their own that there was something terribly wrong with their ideology. I was convinced for an embarrassingly long time that there was rightness with it." He propped his elbows on his thighs and looked at his hands as he continued to speak. "I wish I could say that it was all a façade then. That I knew I was chasing a fanatical idea. But I didn't know. I simply didn't question it. Until I couldn't avoid it, because my family and I were suddenly harmed by it."
Christmas unfolds as it is described in the most beautiful children's books. The house smells of warm treats and cinnamon, there is lively laughter and happy chatter everywhere. Everyone is wearing newly knitted clothes, curiously examining the presents they have received, helping Mrs Weasley prepare the next delicious meal or playing in the snow outside the front door. Joy and contentment dominate the minds, only Harry's high spirits fail to materialise.
Malfoy's perspective on matters was as arrogant and conceited as ever. None of the memories we had watched had changed that. He was always convinced he chose the right words and made the right decisions. His morals may have changed over the years, but this quality remained intact. His self-confidence seemed unassailable.
Another thought aids him in distracting himself from his doubts. It does not leave him alone, causing him to think back over and over again to the Trophy Room with Malfoy's memories. He visualises the picture frames in front of him, their contents lingering in his mind's eye. But that is not all – his focus keeps getting drawn back to a very particular picture frame that was labelled with a six.
Having completely forgotten the horror movie and the actual subject, Harry couldn’t help but admit to himself that there was some truth to Draco's statement, more than the others made it look like with their laughter. His greatest happiness was indeed sitting between his legs and rolled those gleaming eyes at something Theo had said. Harry's pulse quickened as if on cue at the silent confession.
Looking at the spot where Draco’s wound must be, Harry sighed. Winning the argument would cost a lot, maybe he should just drop it. “You act like I have nothing to do with this, but ever since we found out I’m your bloody saviour, I’m more involved than you might like me to be.”
Nothing kills the mood like the news that your own pet might be dying. That much, Draco knew. He knew what it was like to lose horses. He remembered the wound each one had left in his heart. He couldn't blame Potter for withdrawing himself. After lunch at the latest, Draco was ready to fold, talk to Potter, distract him, but fate showed him no mercy. So, as usual, he spent his noon training Feykir, wishing Lockhart death and throwing his father secret hateful looks.
Red eyes, snakeskin, stone walls, Hogwarts, an apple, a chirp, pain. So much pain and hate. Tears and blood, the smell of iron, the smell of death, water. More pain. Pain from one wound, from multiple wounds. Again the memory was wrested from him, but Harry went into the next one without comment. He was close. So close.
disappear." Draco didn't really sound reproachful and motioned down at them. It reminded Harry to put his clothes back on properly. As soon as that had happened, he set about closing Draco's trousers again with a pert grin on his lips. Draco's gaze lay attentively on Harry's hands, an everlasting hunger glittering in his eyes.
Draco hesitantly complies with the request, wincing ever so slightly as Harry gently begins to run his fingers through Draco's hair. But he does not resist and silently permits Harry. Harry wonders why he had assumed that Draco's hair was brittle and dull. Beneath his fingers, it feels as soft as it did when he wore it short. The only difference is evident in the love Draco holds for it.
Startled, I opened my eyes and immediately made a move to rise. But Draco was already nonchalantly settling across from me on an equally scarlet armchair, lounging serenely into it, and crossing his legs, prompting me to remain seated, pinned by his gaze as I myself stared at him wide-eyed.
"All right, mount up, Potter," Draco urged Harry and held Hetja's reins in Harry's place. They had come to a halt in the middle of the arena and were watched from the edge by the first onlookers, Ginny, Seamus and Dean to be precise.
"Harry thinks the Elder Wand won't be able to provide Malfoy with enough power," Hermione says in a thin voice, not looking at Ron. "He's planning to make Draco the Master of Death."
The whimper is replaced by a sob which, at last, breathes life back into Harry's limbs. He only hesitates for a split second before knocking lightly on the closed wooden door. When there is no response, Harry carefully pushes down the handle and slowly enters the dark room.
After their arrival, they split up into groups. While one third prepared the picnic, another set about looking after the ponies and the last third, including Harry and Ron, constructed a paddock fence that would serve them for a few hours. Then they immediately started devouring the sandwiches they had brought.
Lupin nodded and gave Harry an amused look. "Until he was 10 years old, he always hid from the farm dog on the back of a horse. I'm absolutely sure that's one of the reasons he was able to ride so early."
But Draco nodded and let himself be convinced even without Harry’s confidence. The Slytherin didn’t really have a choice, anyway. Harry admonished himself not to have such destructive thoughts, then even leaned in to give Draco a quick kiss on the lips before he headed for the Gryffindor common room.
The theory continues. It suggests that Mr Malfoy not only has the knowledge but also put that knowledge down on paper. The idea is risky enough, the theory actually just rubbish, but when one of the Aurors casually mentioned that Mr Malfoy's diary was confiscated when he was imprisoned, Anja's ears pricked up.
Draco's hand brushes a strand of hair from Harry's forehead and he looks him in the eye. "I can't risk you throwing that away."
Instead of answering, Weasley laboriously groped for his own phone in his trouser pocket. Potter reached for it before Weasley could even hold it out to him. With furrowed brows, Potter started typing, held the phone to his ear and turned away.
Then Harry let go of the blond, only holding him by the waist to keep him from falling over in the water. Draco held his hair in the back of his neck –
The evening began, of course, with drinking games, which particularly affected Neville. After a while the group split, some of them were drunk enough to dance (among them, of course, Ginny and Luna), some of them were going for the snacks and talked to each other in smaller groups, some of them, Neville to be exact, were too drunk to do anything at all. Harry made it his business to assist Neville and took the young man to the pillow sitting area.
go wrong, at least Harry's pony was coloured and not Draco's. This would save him a lot of unnecessary drama.
"And you want to bleed him dry?" Harry probed. He looked at the situation the same way Blaise did. Draco overdramatized it immensely.
It was tragic to see Draco grinning happily as if he was suddenly a different person. How loving he became, how much he let himself go, and it was all thanks to his lost hope. It was painful because he showed a side of himself that had lived hidden within him for so long and only appeared in the face of his human death. It was understandable, nobody liked to show their deepest inner being to the whole world, not even Draco. But he threw this principle out the window with the prospect of an imminent end and dropped the cold mask, only to put on a mask of happiness. Even in his last moments, Draco was unable to show his true feelings, the chance for unconditional honesty he was denied.
Because nobody said anything, Harry started to eat right away. Only when he lifted his eyes again did he notice that Ron and Hermione looked at him as if he had gone completely mad. “What?”
Harry presses his lips together. Getting Draco's cooperation now would have been far too easy. The world has no intention of sparing them the obstacles. But Harry has no intention of jamming on the brakes in the finishing lap.
Perhaps that would have been the right time. Harry was very convinced, at least for that moment, that it was the right time. Because, although Draco had the talent to drive him into insecurity, at the end of the day, Harry felt safer and more loved by him than ever before. But Harry wasn't the best at confessing love, as he had as little experience with it as he did with sex. He was certain of one thing, and that was that he wanted to make up for this lagging behind with Draco as well. So he opened his mouth but didn't get a chance to speak.
Ron playfully nudges him against the shoulder and begins to enumerate how much more structured his life is compared to Hermione's. Hermione interrupts him at point two, sub-point C:
The blond turned his head to Harry and frowned. "What have I wanted to know about you since we met?"
There are things Harry should be dealing with in order to truly heal, but he lacks the vocabulary to name them, so he has given up trying to find the right words.
His gaze drops to the postcard on which Pup is making himself comfortable. Sheepishly, Harry scratches the back of his head, but Draco puts him out of his misery before he has to think of a suitable reply.
A last sigh escaped Harry’s lips, then he dropped the ring into the outstretched hand of the waterspirit. A rejoicing shrill cry rang out, then the creature submerged and disappeared before Harry’s eyes. The wizard blinked a few times in confusion, then a light appeared in the depths of the lake, which raced towards him. Harry jumped aside just in time when someone already climbed out of the lake.
Harry had hardly spoken to Draco that evening, it had been pure coincidence that they had retired to their room almost at the same time. Draco had claimed the "better" bed (there was nothing better about it, it just stood further away from the door. But Draco insisted that in the event of an attempted assassination, Harry should serve as a living shield and was therefore correctly positioned closer to the door) and then started to unpack. He had also changed into light blue silk trousers and a white sleeping shirt, which again looked as if Draco had bought it completely overpriced. Harry had followed his bedtime routine in the bathroom and had also unpacked his travel bag afterwards. And now he was sitting on the small lilac sofa, wondering what must be wrong with a human that he was so fascinated by hair.
“And how does the curse work? Every time you touch water, you turn into a ‘waterspirit-like being'?” Harry asked, interrupting Draco.
"Quite so. It is no ordinary diary, however," Auror Filly says and does the unbelievable. He settles on a chair next to Mr Potter, defying all the laws a tin soldier has to follow. "It's completely empty. All the responsible departments have examined it for months, but only a magical signature could be detected. We dropped the investigation when it became evident that it couldn’t be entered without having the matching –“
The blond groaned unnerved and pushed his barely touched breakfast away, then looked up and at Harry, who returned the look as unimpressed as possible.
. Harry's other hand went from Draco's waist down to his hips and then onto his back where it lingered until Draco began to move his hips as if subconsciously.
Draco's hips jerked, his hands clawed painfully into Harry's hair and he moaned as if Harry had just given him the best rush. "I – I'm falling in love with you too, Harry," he stammered into the crook of Harry’s neck and Harry froze in his motion.
"You believe me, right?" Harry asked, looking for a hint of uncertainty in the grey eyes. It wouldn't have made sense not to believe Harry if it had only been for a bet, then he wouldn't have said all this.
Less than half an hour later, Jimar turns into Grimmauld Place and stops just a few houses from number twelve. As he pulls the wheelchair out of the boot, Harry leans over to Draco and whispers in his ear the words everyone needs to hear, courtesy of the Fidelius Charm.
Harry liked to believe Draco. But he was also sure that Draco didn't usually have an inexperienced rider clinging to him when he galloped bareback across the paddock. So he just made a sound that meant anything but agreement. Draco interpreted it as agreement anyway and clicked his tongue again.
and put the book on the “useless” stack as well. “Maybe we should start looking in the Forbidden Section," Harry mused, already thinking about returning to the library tonight with his invisibility cloak.
It took a load off my mind and this time I simply allowed the smile to settle on my face. The sudden sensation of comfort caused my hesitation to disappear as I scooted to the edge of the sofa and held out my hand to Draco. "Here's to a fresh start."
In the bottom row, there were seven picture frames, numbered from one to seven, clearly showing memories from the respective Hogwarts years. The photograph with the engraved 'one' displayed the Sorting Hat ceremony, the second picture a Quidditch game and the fourth showed several moments with the students from Durmstrang and Beauxbatons. Only at the sixth and penultimate image did I falter. Nothing but fog wafted where usually a memory replayed. No matter how long I stared at it, the fog would not lift, becoming much denser the harder I tried. So I directed my attention to the row of pictures above.
. When neither of them said anything, Draco grabbed his wand and walked over to Harry to leave the bathroom past him. Before he could go, Harry held him by the wrist.
sweaty, blond strands of hair stuck to his cheek and forehead, sweat was dripping down his temples and neck and his scent was sweet but tangy. A sweaty Draco with loose hair falling softly over his shoulder didn't help Harry's precarious situation in the least, he only felt his heart pumping more blood southwards.
Rather than bothering to answer, Draco's eyes drop to Harry's lips. He hesitates for a split second, but then leans his head a little further in Harry's direction and gently places his lips on Harry's.
A gentle touch on his upper arm made him flinch before he relaxed. Still he didn’t lift his head. Instead, he loosened his crossed arms to reach blindly for Draco’s waist and pull him a tiny bit closer. His heart reacted immediately to Draco’s warmth with soulful happiness, and the rest of his body greeted him with relief as if he had been absent too long.
"You’ve got an interesting taste, Mr Potter," Mr Malfoy said calmly, mockery drenching his voice. Before Harry could even think of answering, he felt a foot from Draco's direction smash painfully against his shin, and Mr Malfoy turned back to his son. "Draco, I'd be much obliged if we could have a private word after your breakfast."
Harry simply sat out the next day's lessons. He even kept himself from staring at Draco for unnecessarily long durations, which Ron and Hermione seemed to notice. At lunch, Harry finally told them about Draco's curse, but this time he made sure that nobody overheard them, especially Seamus. As expected, they were both shocked, but Hermione immediately offered to go to the library right after afternoon class to research blood curses, and Harry decided to help her with that. Ron said he would get in touch with his brother Bill. After all, the Weasleys were also a pure-blood family, this kind of curse could not have been kept secret forever. If anyone knew more about it, it was probably Bill.
happened between your promise and my question. I'm terribly sorry I didn't automatically assume that you'd still want me."
Draco gasped in surprise but didn’t resist. On the contrary, he buried his hands in Harry's hair again and pulled him closer until their lips almost touched. Harry hesitated instantly, but Draco overcame the last few millimetres and pressed his lips firmly against Harry's. Harry sighed with relief and kissed back with eager. This was
"Why are you working with your best friend's brother anyway?" Draco wanted to know. He sat in the armchair he had seemingly chosen as his own, his feet tucked up and alternately watching me talk or the flames flickering, whichever suited him best.
I had known that Malfoy was a person who clung to his survival. He fought for it, despite disdaining fighting, and chose paths that guaranteed his survival, no matter how questionable they were. I suspected that this was a trait that had led him to commit some of his worst decisions. But also his best, as I had discovered through Malfoy's memory museum.
Harry snorted at the potshot and also crossed his arms in front of his chest, unconsciously imitating Draco's posture. “You won't talk to me, but maybe this thing from the sea will,” he speculated and, judging by Draco's reaction, hit the bull's eye.
finally shut up as long as he kept an eye on the Slytherin and if he touched him, accidentally or not, it even disappeared completely. Draco obviously struggled to control himself, neither attacking Harry nor undressing him with his eyes, although in some moments he did allow the latter, which Harry tried to ignore as much as possible.
Malfoy continues to act distant towards Harry, barely speaking a word, not looking him in the eye, though Harry cherishes the hope that their constant connection will at least assuage Malfoy's hatred. Malfoy does not push him away, does not reach for Harry's hand out of his own will, but endures the touch without argument. Never once did he mention his mother or inquire how Harry could know the incantation. He presumably makes sense of it on his own.
Harry bites his tongue but nevertheless cannot stop his words. "It's only collecting memories. It has little to do with reality."
Malfoy regained his balance, not a second later dark fog crawled up his legs from the ground and wrapped itself around his wrists, which were thus pinned to his sides. In Malfoy's eyes, shock gave way to sheer anger.
Quietly, Harry said the password and the door slipped open as usual, but he stayed in the corridor a full ten seconds longer before pulling himself together. He had watched Draco closely on the Marauder’s Map, he had already been here for a good hour, that was certainly enough time to transform himself and to no longer stand naked at the edge of the pool. Harry remembered to hastily delete this image from his mind. After all, he wanted to avoid unnecessarily hot cheeks.
good, huh? I'll take that as a 'thank you'." He sat up on Harry's thighs and used the blanket to wipe the remains of Harry's orgasm off his and Harry's stomach. Harry closed his eyes with relish, floating on the fading feeling of his orgasm. "Don't fall asleep, Harry. The 'sleep with me'-part hasn't yet been fulfilled.”
"But Claire wasn't a Squib. I don't know about the other missing wizards and witches, but even if it were the case that they were all Squibs, many were no longer children at the time of their disappearance," I pointed out.
Actually, Harry didn’t want to ask, but it wasn’t as if fate would give him a choice. "Is Draco in there?" He pointed to the office door and stopped in front of Blaise. He glanced at him briefly, then nodded slowly. Harry nodded as well, then skimmed the notes on the noticeboard. That's all he wanted to know, even though the information was of absolutely no use to him.
"Oh, please, love. I'm not stupid enough to let you choose my outfit," Draco interrupted him with an amused chuckle. "My question is whether you are only concerned with the clothes or also with female body attributes. We’re
Nellie scoffs derisively, which Harry does not take personally and instead cleans the dust off the wings of the phoenix on the brass sign.
Filly looks at Harry in irritation for a few seconds but seems to collect himself quickly. "With all due respect, Mr Potter, but you won't get away with this. Where is the exhibit? I know you're responsible for the disappearance."
"Here, Your Highness. Sit on it!" Harry smiled contentedly, but Draco's expression didn’t change. He still stared at Harry with big eyes and very slowly, almost too slowly, his cheeks turned a soft pink. Harry frowned, but when Draco's eyes fluttered southwards it dawned on him. Could it be? Was that really the first time Draco had seen him shirtless? Harry's grin just widened. "What? Do you like what you see?"
"Pleased to meet you," Lupin said, and stretched out a hand to Sirius, which he took in his with far too much enthusiasm.
Draco sulked. From his perspective, however, he was probably a pure angel of innocence, but Harry noticed it anyway. At first, he was convinced that it was because Ginny had interrupted them, but as the day progressed, Draco's true problem became clearer. He sulked because Harry hadn't told him about his birthday. More precisely, he sulked
"I wanted to ask him," Harry began quietly. "I wanted to ask him if he wants to be in a relationship with me. Even though I knew I was keeping something from him. I just... I don't know how to explain any of this."
and keep your hands on the reins. Now!", Draco hissed disturbed, as soon as he noticed what Harry was doing.
Was Harry allowed to do this? To give comfort or not, where was the boundary with former school nemeses? Of course, they were older, they had survived a war, such trifles as old arguments had long been forgotten, but Harry was not sure how much Draco still clung to his old ideals. That the Malfoys had somehow managed to switch sides just before the end of the war had been a miracle, but they had always been out for their own benefit. Dumbledore’s side had been victorious, no wonder they had wanted to be part of it towards the end.
In fact, after a few minutes, which seemed like hours to Harry, the Slytherin detached his gaze from him and turned back into the floating position from before. Harry exhaled in relief, but this time so quietly that Draco didn't notice. Then he turned around and tiptoed out of the bathroom. That had clearly been too close and he had seen enough for now.
"Mr Malfoy's belongings were confiscated by the Ministry after his conviction and kept in safe custody," Filly explains, seeming to be the orator of the two Aurors. For half a second, Anja is tempted to refer to the other, whose name she has not caught for lack of interest, as the brawn and Filly as the brains, but stops herself in time as he continues. "After it's been thoroughly checked for any traces of dark magic, of course."
“Oh, leave him alone, Theo. You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink! You coming, Greg?”
"Are you going to tell me about your diary?" Harry returns the question, imitating Draco's head position in order to regard him in just as relaxed a manner. "I've worked most of it out by myself, but clearly I can't rely on that."
This was one hundred per cent a sideswipe at Harry's skills in bed. It couldn't have been anything else. Harry wanted to die. No, he actually
Draco's grip on his erection became looser, Harry grumbled protestingly. When Draco made no attempt to firm the grip again, he grabbed Draco's bottom and drew him closer to his own body until he felt Draco's hard cock rubbing against his through the silky fabric.
He had grown. Had discovered that being brave wasn't shameful and, after a bit of getting used to it, he even enjoyed it. It had been nerve-wracking at first, but in the end, his newfound courage had opened more doors for him than his cowardice had done in seventeen years.
The redhead snorted in amusement. "You wish, Harry sweetie pie, but I’m not. I simply don't want to be forced to hang out with Ron all the time now!"
Draco's eyebrows twitched as if they weren't sure whether to be confused or amused. "It's Lockhart. Either way, the training is for nought."
“For Mother, it was all the same, she just wanted to save me from my fate. In her last letter, she assured me that father now shares her view. It’s fairly late for me to be accepted by my father.” Draco laughed dryly. It sounded more like a dismal gasp.
That wasn't all that easy. Draco still wore his French braid from the night, which was surprisingly intact, but not quite. More loose strands than usual fell on his face and neck. A particularly long, curly strand fell over his shoulder and Harry began to wonder quietly how long Draco's hair actually was when unbraided. Draco looked as if he had only woken up five minutes ago. He was wearing his riding gear, but his sleepy expression gave him away.
The sight of Draco was more beautiful than ever. The red lips twisted into a smile, the grey eyes whose glow was just fading and the hair that, despite its condition, could not have been silkier. Harry didn’t dare to move yet; Draco and the situation were too beautiful.
He will never be someone else – he and all the outsiders will always view him in one and the same light, he needed to find his peace with that.
"Look, I'm sorry, okay? I don't know what I was thinking when I told him. My point was actually that I wanted to tell him that he... you know... means a lot to you. I think he missed that part."
Last words are not an easy choice. There are a million and more things Harry wants Draco to know. He wants to beg forgiveness for not being able to keep his word, he wants to give him more of his touch and make him realise what meaning the past visits carry for him. But no words seem adequate enough.
With the end of the week come the last days of February, and spring finally descends on London. It is then that another envelope from Parkinson arrives at Number Twelve Grimmauld Place. The owl has been sent by Ron, which Harry can tell by the fact that it lets Harry cuddle it for a whole five minutes – Ron's owls are the most affectionate Harry has encountered.
"He's reading it anyway," Ron informs him as he rummages in one of the kitchen cupboards in an unsuccessful search for something edible. "Maybe you should talk to him about it."
"I honestly don't even know," Ginny admitted shrugging. "It was Ron and Hermione's idea. The rest of us only agreed to it because we’re doing this
Jimar returns Harry's gaze appraisingly, but then his shoulders slump a little and he sits down opposite him again. "She was a long-term patient here, I sometimes played cards with her during my breaks. Suffers from a curse that suppresses her magical abilities. She was supposed to be transferred the day before yesterday, to a hospital closer to her family."
You could classify Nellie’s brusque demeanour as off-putting, but she is more kind-hearted to children, the 'brats', than to anyone else. Harry, on the other hand, had needed a load of lemon tartlets to get the pleasure of a fully-formulated "good morning". When he then began to help out a bit after work at Nellie's, he earned the nickname "Owlington". To this day, Harry still searches unsuccessfully for the compliment in the name.
Harry raised his head, smiled at Blaise who sat down to his left, a paper cup in his hands. Silently, Harry wondered how obvious his fascination with Draco was to everyone else. Not that it bothered him that others could read him. It was a strange feeling, almost as if they knew more about him than he knew about himself, but it didn't really worry him.
A bed with enough room for the two of them was the most important thing, of course, but the rest? What mood should he choose? Something simple or something cheesy? Did Draco even like sob-stuff? It was their first time after all and if he had the chance to plan it, he could definitely take the trouble to make it romantic. Unless Draco wasn’t into romance, in which case it might not be appropriate.
Harry had, of course, told them what had happened with Draco and while Ron had pursed his lips, Hermione had already started to plan Harry’s outfit. Why his friends, like the rest of Hogwarts, were not particularly surprised by the latest developments between a certain Gryffindor and a certain Slytherin, made Harry think, but not too much. He told himself that they were probably used to worse things because of the war.
Harry snorted. He was definitely bigger than when he was ten. "Thank you. I'm fighting for every centimetre.” Harry gestured to Ron, who was standing a little bit helpless next to his bed. "Hermione, this is Ron. Ron, Hermione."
"Your pony. Her name is Hetja," Draco explained and walked past Harry along the stable alley. Harry followed him reluctantly. "She's well-behaved, a bit stubborn sometimes, but nothing that can't be handled."
I stared at the hand as if it were a giant Acromantula, which was not particularly fond of me. Everything about this Malfoy did not match up with what I thought about him. I wondered why I had not noticed this before, or whether it was only since this very moment that he was behaving so strangely. I could not figure it out. Instead, I remembered just in time that I was not eleven years old anymore, pulled myself together and allowed Malfoy to help me up.
He does not apparate directly to the shop, instead taking his time, walking up Diagon Alley and watching as the morning breathes life into the various shops. The street positively blossoms day after day with the bell tower chiming nine o'clock – it offers Harry a sense of peacefulness. The rattling of
It is not rocket science to get to Draco Malfoy's room. He is no longer a prisoner and has remained in isolation of his own free will. His loss of magic may be erratic, but he is not classified as a danger worthy of guarding. Not any more.
Harry feels included and affirmed, regardless of his behaviour. And that is not a given, for his mood swings alarmingly. At times he sits silently at the dinner table, merely listening to the conversation of the other two, sometimes he rages about the most trivial matters, and other times he silently longs for nothing more than someone who understands his thoughts in all their depth. He hardly understands them himself.
Ron pressed his lips together to stop himself from laughing, but Hermione snorted, looked around briefly, probably careful not to be overheard, and then started to speak. “You seem hungry.”
Draco followed his gaze and sighed quietly. "Unfortunately, such spells never last very long." He looked up at the ceiling and sighed once more.
“I wanted nothing more in my life than freedom. By my fate, I was denied it for too long. The curse additionally suppressed this desire, even after the downfall of the Dark Lord,” Draco began to speak tenderly. Harry was silent, trying hard to focus on Draco’s words and not his touch. “Holding on to the hope that the curse could be broken after all, I didn’t think about the inevitable. The saviour sounded only like fiction to me, I saw no value in sparing even a thought for him. I can only emphasise again and again that I never believed in fairy tales and he was the definition of a fairy tale. A knight in shining armour who saves me from my fate? Ridiculous! But then you came.”
Harry frowned. He knew that Draco was good at assessing his abilities, but the decision seemed a bit hasty to him.
Mr Potter stares at the letters as if he knows of other convicts of Azkaban whose names he would have expected to see on this book.
if that’s even an adequate description for fingers. But graceful put it surprisingly well in a nutshell. They were slim, like the rest of Draco, but more delicate than bony. And
Harry closed his eyes, concentrated on Draco and his thoughts. That was just the jump-start, soon he had to break free and stay in reality.
Without hesitation, Harry interlocks their little fingers with each other. "You trusted me then, didn't you?"
Draco rolled his eyes, noticeably fighting down the hint of a smile, and let Harry pull him into a loose embrace. The blond sank against Harry's chest, sighed at the crook of his neck and shoved a hand into Harry's hair. "Right now, I have more reasons to be happy. In a few days I'll probably want to strangle you for this, so enjoy your aliveness while you still have it."
"Oh." Fuck. Draco's chest contracted painfully. How could he be so stupid? Holy shit, that was awful. And he sat here, completely unable to find the right words. Potter didn't deserve this.
Harry lowered his head, he felt sick. He had known that. Of course, he had. Hearing it only made it more real and reality hurt like salt in a fresh wound. Now came the hard part. How would he convince Draco that Harry was worth forgiving? That he was telling the truth?
The corner of Draco's mouth twitched in amusement. "It depends on the perspective." Harry made a face, suggesting that he wanted to officially end his own life. Draco chuckled softly. "It's good for now.”
with you people?" Blaise had also jumped to his feet and was now scowling at Hermione and Draco in turn. "You're behaving like
"After his formal discharge from Azkaban in September, we were going to move him to another sector," Jimar tells him as he steps next to Harry and shoves his hands into his trouser pockets. "You know he completed his sentence, right?"
“I’m not trying to achieve anything,” Draco replied quietly. Harry snorted, which drew a warning look from Prof. McGonagall.
He has missed his cheeky grin, his jokes that are not at all unlike George's, his wink when Healer Isaksen's stern look feels unsettling, his stories of poltergeists haunting his Muggle vehicle and depriving him of the ability to navigate left-hand traffic on English roads, and the infinite candour he always radiates.
"Ah." Malfoy proceeded to draw triangles on top of the circles in the sand. "So by your definition, that means the Gryffindors are the good ones."
So he opened his eyes, turned his head in a desperate attempt to find a dignified end with eloquent last words, but was knocked down before he could even think of putting his plan into action.
"I issued this special authorisation, Mr Potter," Robards replies measuredly. "Mr Malfoy is a prisoner of Azkaban, his father deceased, his mother out of the picture. Moreover, the man is more despised by his own ranks than by the general magical community. Do you honestly believe that anyone would care for this man's survival?"
Draco sighed, let himself sink against the back of his chair and rubbed the bridge of his nose. “I understand that you want to help me, but –”
"Have you gone mad?" Malfoy continued to glare at me in fury, but straightened his shoulders and made a noticeable effort to relax his body. "You could have just
– guests have referred to me as your fiancé," Harry enumerates the reason why he would rather be at his flat with Pup right now. "Mrs Dankworth called me a ‘little scallywag who wonderfully empathises with the sufferings of the children’ and then wanted to know if I had any children of my own. Give me
At first, he continued Draco's sluggish rhythm, soon found his own, to the beat of his chasing heartbeat. Harry heard nothing but Draco's panting on his lips, felt nothing but Draco's heated body underneath him yearning for it and let himself be catapulted to the highest heights and deepest hell. It was so simple, so made for each other. Their bodies, fitting together like pieces of a puzzle. Harry felt feverish, heat and cold rushing through his veins and fighting for dominance.
The reaction came immediately, Draco gasped into the kiss, bent his leg so Harry could hold it while pressing his hips even closer to Draco's.
He thought about how he was still afraid to say the wrong thing. He didn't want to make things worse for both of them, although at this point that was probably no longer possible. It helped that his adrenaline kicked in. It made Harry reckless, but it also made him brave, and he needed that right now. His intuition and his gut feeling slowly but surely gained the upper hand, which would help him.
Draco was definitely a man who liked to win. The sparkle in his eyes, made his whole being shine and infected everyone with his euphoria. Every congratulation stained his cheeks with rosy smugness. Draco was no humble winner, for God's sake, No! Rather, one could see his arrogance swell, his triumph turning into sweet arrogance. Harry could never have grown tired of it.
the reddened lips and tangled hair. That had its effect, even if Draco's posture was one of earnestness.
Of course, Harry had already noticed Draco’s thighs before, but seeing them naked and exposed flipped a switch inside him that put all the puzzle pieces in their proper place and gave him a picture of enlightenment. Draco had
It was only when Harry opened his eyes that he realised he had actually had his eyes closed. He looked into clear grey, he was so close to Draco, he could make out the black speckles in his iris and count his thick lashes. He didn't need his eyesight to recognise Draco's beauty. "I always see you, baby."
Harry gave Ron a quick look and shrugged his shoulders. “Well, yeah. But I don't think it would be too different from being with a girl,” Harry pondered aloud.
Breathing shallowly, Harry broke away from the kiss by pushing Draco away a little. This wasn’t the direction he wanted this to go, but Draco was too good to teach him otherwise. “For someone who thinks unrequited love is the worst curse, you don’t make it exactly easy for me!”
But the images didn't disappear even when he was awake, they just became more detailed, more revealing, and
with Ron, chatting about things that are forgotten only hours after they meet. On four other Fridays, he sits on the windowsill of his living room window and tries to organise his thoughts in written form. In the end, he only draws the root of an enormous tree and his name below it in curved letters. He writes it with a quill and not with his wand.
Parkinson, whose mask dropped as soon as the other wizard was out of her reach, eyes Harry once more. Surprisingly, however, with less resentment. "It's not by any chance because you'd agree to an interview with Witch Weekly, is it?"
One memory had featured one of my speeches, Malfoy had been standing quite far back and had been lost in the crowd of guests. Only when I had turned to him and told him that I had always disliked these kinds of events had I realised that Malfoy had fared no differently. He had acted out of a sense of duty, after all, he had his reputation to clear, but he had taken no pleasure in the masquerades.
. Harry tried very hard to calm his racing heart. "I – uh... I have to touch you for that." Draco frowned and eyed Harry curiously. He cleared his throat and forced himself to look at Draco. "
Draco lay turned away from Harry, his hair was braided as usual and was lying on the pillow as if draped. Harry sighed and let himself fall back into his own pillow. Perhaps Draco was just sleeping particularly soundly. Perhaps it was a coincidence that he didn't even make a noise on the next morning of their first kiss.
"Not a realistic one, no," Isaksen confirms Harry's most horrible suspicions. "He would have to be the one to part his magic from the wounds and, at the same time, the one to close them again. Such power he doesn't hold. No wizard in this world holds such power."
"No one is going to leave this hospital without undergoing an extensive inspection," he announces menacingly.
Harry deliberately rolled his eyes, the helmet, fortunately, covered his beaming smile well enough. He got on the scooter and waited patiently until Draco wrapped his arms around his stomach and he was ready to drive off. The wind was blowing in his face, Harry felt Draco nestle closer to him, he sighed softly and liberated.
"I have nothing for you," Malfoy replied scornfully. "As you may have noticed, the earth has orbited the sun a full five times without my presence. I'm as involved in what's happened as you exhibit decency. That amounts to a zero for both of us, in case your rotten brain hasn't figured that out yet. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't answer the Aurors' questions."
Harry raised an eyebrow in appraisal. Although Draco seemed really upset, he was still very much alive, which indicated that the Slytherin would not carry out his murder plan. At least not yet. “You can't seriously expect me not to tell anyone if you're not in any way willing to tell me anything about it.”
The tortured groan that leaves Ginny's mouth as her head drops back piques the curiosity of six guests standing not far away, who crane their necks to look at the two of them. Ginny is not bothered in the least. "Merlin, Harry, your life is as eventful as Aunt Muriel's. Which isn't to be taken as a compliment, mind you."
The tingling sensation on Harry's skin sank into his blood and made it boil with Draco's touch. He sank further back, stretched his legs under Draco's, made room for him to lie completely on top of him and between his legs. A sigh escaped Draco's lips, Harry caught it greedily, barely stopped himself from moaning.
Draco leaned over Harry's upper body, but kept his erection in place with two fingers, greedily kissing him on his wet lips.
This time Draco snorted, but in his mind voice and Harry almost laughed. The former Slytherin was quickly brought to drive up the wall. Usually Harry enjoyed this a little too much.
I looked over at the blond, who was maliciously gloating about Hagrid, who, I discovered by glancing out of the shop window, was actually standing in eyeshot, cheerfully waving with two ice cream cones. Pointy face, pale skin, voice dripping with scorn. Yes, there was no doubt about it. I had Draco Malfoy in front of me.
Draco exhaled audibly, seemed to collect himself and rested his chin on his fingertips thoughtfully. "I don't know enough about the connections to be sure, but there's a memory that might help us. Come –"
He talked about how he had made the deal with the waterspirit and how he had tried for days to get the ring. He went on about how he had gone to Draco every night and he had felt wrong to betray him, but then the idea of a Sleeping Draught had come to him. He also said that he had got hold of the ring after the incident with Hermione and Ron and had taken it to the waterspirit that same evening. Then he told them of the complete curse, how he had fallen under Draco’s spell and kissed him.
“A lovely morning to you too,” muttered Draco, who raised his head again to look at Harry. “And your breath smells terrible!”
"Fingers?" Harry asked without thinking and immediately regretted not being able to keep his mouth shut. But Seamus had once told him about fingers and it hadn't sounded too unrealistic.
"So far you're the only one and we'll take what we can get," Anja replies and she exchanges a small smile with her counterpart, which takes the edge off the mood.
him. As if Draco could read his mind, he positioned himself under Harry, kissed Harry's lips again, reassuringly and light as a feather grabbed his cock and aligned it just right.
Draco is not even incorrect in this statement. Just at that moment, Dvořák's Romance in F minor, Op. 11 is playing, a piece Harry has always been in the habit of listening to on Fridays. He finds no reason to expand his repertoire of composers, as he always finds the right tunes for his moods.
First I had done it for Healer Isaksen – she had asked for my help, so why should I have refused her? When that motivation had diminished, the goal of the Aurors had followed. I had really believed in being able to help people like Claire. By now I realised that was a misjudgement. Malfoy would never be one of the good ones, he would never even try.
Panting and with a hard beating heart, Harry collapsed on Draco, felt the aftershocks from their orgasms, smiled contentedly and closed his eyes. So that was it. Their first time. Amazingly normal, except for the demanding urges. Harry felt the need to ask Draco how he had liked it, but held himself back, took a breath again at first.
As soon as Harry has finished his work and dried his hands, he and Ron join the two in the drawing room, sitting down on the armchairs as Hermione and Draco have made themselves comfortable on the couch, as suspected, and in addition to their endless conversation about Muggle books, take turns petting Pup, who is purring between them.
I was aware that Malfoy would talk more about this spell on his own if he wanted to, so I silently observed him take a seat on the floor next to the door and lean against the stone wall.
, how much Harry would have given to see the look on Draco's face at that moment. But even without his glasses, he knew that Draco's cheeks were turning red. "I think that’s feasible," Harry whispered with significantly more self-control than he would have thought he was capable of.
"Is this... Do you even want to–?" Ah yes, the whole thing with forming whole sentences was rather difficult in his condition.
Harry broke off. He couldn't do it. Not if he wasn't able to see Draco before him. It was hard enough as it was, but he needed
with Draco, he had indeed, just like the Slytherin, been late for Charms, but he had not paid attention to his whispering classmates. He had already been aware that the rumbling in the small broom cupboard had made the rounds. Their tardiness sparked rumours, but they would certainly be more in the direction of murder and manslaughter than flirtations, so it didn't matter to Harry.
It probably should have been embarrassing for him, but the thought didn’t even occur to him as Draco's eyes darkened instantly and he took a firm step towards Harry. His hand cupped Harry’s on his cock, he began to
Harry laughed briefly, then leaned back in his chair to look at Draco, lost in thought. “What do you want to be called then?”
.” He pointed to a round protrusion in one corner of the room and walked towards it. The view was nice, he could see the stables and a place where horses were racked up and combed.
At the small reception, Jimar stands next to the young blonde woman who has since introduced herself to him as Lucy and is currently laughing with flushed cheeks at something Jimar has whispered into her ear. There is no sign of Healer Isaksen yet, although Harry is a little late. He silently hopes that the Healer has not left already out of impatience, but it seems conceivable.
From Jimar Harry learns that after an endless ordeal with the Ministry, Pansy Parkinson has finally been given the permission to visit Malfoy for an hour every fortnight. The two usually spend this time in Malfoy's room, smoking while quietly exchanging pleasantries. Ultimately, it was only through Malfoy's discharge and the personal approval of Healer Isaksen that she was allowed the visits at all but apparently her presence contributes greatly to the improvement of Malfoy's mental state.
Following his new plan, Harry continued his kisses on Draco's neck, shoved the shirt up his back as well, positioned Draco's body so that the blond lay on his stomach and kissed his way down his back. He took his time, caressed every centimetre of the warm skin and enjoyed the thin line between lust and tenderness. Draco melted under his touches like butter and Harry gratefully absorbed every sigh.
Sure enough, Malfoy's eyes flutter open, his eyes roam searchingly along the wall, but he never finds what he is looking for, so he focuses on an indeterminate point. His hand slides over the exposed strip of skin once more, his touch feather-light as he circles his belly button.
Harry made a noise to simulate interest and watched Draco sitting on one of the two leather sofas in the other corner of the room. He had wrapped one arm around Pansy, the other hand was holding his drink.
Of course, he was addressing the kiss. I had expected nothing less of him, and I could not exactly blame him. During all those weeks of racking my brains about Draco, his diary and reality, although I had tried to restrain myself from doing so, I had never found a satisfactory explanation for the kiss.
The words left Harry's lips as if they were made to be sung by him at this very moment. The melody flowed through his body, gathered in his fingertips and was brought to life by the soft sounds of the guitar. A shiver went down Harry's spine.
Harry made a surprised sound when Draco closed his hand around his oversensitive cock. Draco's impatience was written all over his face, so Harry propped himself on his elbows, curled his toes and allowed the new wave of lust to take over his body unhindered. Draco's gaze lay spellbound on Harry's cock, which hardened completely within minutes, the blond gave Harry a triumphant look. Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes. Of course, Draco had an effect on him like no other.
Hermione and Ron followed Harry's gaze and now all three of them stared, anything but subtly, at the Slytherin table. Draco settled down between Blaise and Pansy Parkinson and immediately set about eating his breakfast calmly. Ron and Hermione turned back to Harry, who kept his eyes on Draco.
Suddenly very aware of this, Harry, with some effort, drew back but left his hands where they were. The grey in Draco's eyes was dark, Harry could read nothing but desire. He almost gave in to the kiss again but remembered the reason for the interruption just in time.
I thought about my answer for a while, though I only succinctly reviewed my first thought and eventually just voiced it. "Bravery. When someone follows their path guided by bravery and doesn't let fear lead them astray."
on your back... I’m not blind, mate." Ron threw Harry a lewd grin over the edge of his phone screen.
There is a cold tension in Draco's body and his eyes dart hastily to Ron before he can focus on Harry again. "I could
husband, but Draco ducked away just in time, leaving Harry with just a handful of long hair in his fist. With a sigh, Harry let go of the hair, dropped back onto the sheet and reached out to Draco, who knelt beside his feet and tried to tame his unruly hair. "You must come here then,
On Thursday morning, Harry writes a letter to George, telling him that he has to take an indefinite break from work. He refrains from explaining in detail but knows that no one will hold it against him. For the time being, he has to concentrate on something Draco has never managed in his time and which requires all his attention.
. Harry tried hard not to gasp when his fingers suddenly touched Draco's bottom but were then led further down to his thigh. Harry waited for Draco to bury his own hand in Harry's hair again, then grabbed firmer.
Draco placed his lips gently and briefly on the corner of Harry's mouth, while he brushed back the foreskin of his cock, teasing the tip with his thumb. "Merlin, yes. I want it too!"
The tomcat is highly indignant when Harry lifts him out of Nellie's transport box into a foreign environment. He turns a cold shoulder to Harry, feeling neglected, even though he is the first reason for which Harry voluntarily left Draco's room.
His shirt fell and Harry wondered what the fuck he was even doing. This was a pretty pathetic attempt to turn Draco on. After all, Draco only wanted Harry because his body was trying to break free from a curse that could potentially destroy him. But Draco had returned the kiss, despite all attempts to resist the desire towards Harry. He had even started the French kiss. Did people do that when they had no interest in another person?
Draco crosses out another line, his quill digging into the parchment. At least it wasn’t running away with his hand anymore. Having Harry by his side meant Draco’s magic felt balanced more often than not. Unfortunately it did not to help him when it came to drafting a letter to his mother.
Fang props his head on the knee of Draco’s trousers, soaking them with an alarming amount of drool. When Draco tries to nudge his away, Fang growls, the thrum low in his throat.
“Dwayho?!” His eyes are wide and panicked, drool falling from Ernie’s chin due to his inability to shut his mouth.
Harry has the nerve to laugh. “How’d I know!? I followed you, you arse.” He indicates the invisibility cloak, lying abandoned behind him back by the stairs. His smile turns cheeky. “That’s kind of
"That’s alright, we’ve just ordered drinks," Longbottom laughs, beaming up at Potter. "Sit down, sit down."
Only once he’s there, he realizes he’s left his visitor’s badge on Opal’s desk. It’s a failed attempt to purchase his much needed cup of earl gray. The witch at the cart refuses to sell him anything without clearance.
Draco’s not fooled for a second. “You don’t have to lie, Potter. I know it’s not the Gryffindor common room, but it suits us just fine.” He gestures half-heartedly to the members of his house lounging about who pretend not to eavesdrop, like Harry Potter sat in the middle of their common room is an everyday occurrence. Let no one say that Slytherins aren’t ones for keeping appearances. “I suggest you get used to it.”
“C’mere Fang, you mangy scamp. Let ‘im eat in peace.” Hagrid pats the dog’s head as he bounds noisily to his side of the table, before passing Draco a dingy handkerchief with a grimace. “Sorry Malfoy. Still getting used to you, I suppose.”
Draco cuts his eyes away. It's a mistake. The back porch that leads into the garden proper falls directly into his line of sight, as does Auror Abernathy. There's a glass in his hand, no doubt something drained from Mother's favorite bottle of port. Abernathy catches Draco staring and holds his drink aloft, his expression smug.
Granger is in her element as they trudge into the snow, she and Longbottom leading them all towards the part of the forest where the best Evergreens are known to grow. Draco idly listens to their discussion of needle fullness and branch quality, until his mind begins to wander. He thinks back on the last few days, still trying to nail down what’s been so strange about them.
“Malfoy, I can sense your moods, remember? Which means the connection is already on the fritz again. What are you so pissy about?”
"Dining with others has long been proven to have a whole host of restorative properties for witches and wizards," Draco finds himself reciting stiffly. He's back in his room, then, running a finger for the millionth time along the torn pamphlet he’d managed to spellotape back together, if only just. "In the magical world, communal meals serve
"I don't-" Draco starts, and catches himself, his expression incredulous. He coughs. "I must have missed it." Walking past her, he takes a moment to examine their unusual surroundings. Several bins, similar to the one he’d landed in, fill the room,
"In Headland's office? Chang, I haven't seen you. Are you interning under someone new?" Draco turns back to Harry feigning perfect innocence. "It would have to be a great coincidence that you happened to be coming out of the mind healer I'm currently seeing, wouldn't it?"
Opal rolls her eyes but does as he asks, making a show of rising from her chair on tremulous knees. She slowly shuffles towards the mind healer’s office, disappearing through the oak doors. Hardly more than a couple seconds pass before she returns with much more spring in her step than when she’d left. Draco levels her with a dry look. "Really?"
Potter really has all the luck, Draco thinks to himself as he carefully places the cloak into his bag. He’s meeting the Chosen One in Hogsmeade this morning to finish their last minute Christmas shopping, as well as to test the effects of the curse. Hangingbone is due back sometime next week. With luck, Draco thinks as he spells the laces of his boots back through the holes, they won’t have to say anything to her at all.
Blaise doesn't bother to hide his amusement this time. "We've already moved past the introductions and onto the small talk, my friend. Help yourself to a drink?" The side of his mouth lifts. "You look quite thirsty."
Draco walks into the room, his eyes immediately seeking Potter out amongst the many, many cushions spread across the floor in a layer so thick, there's no stone to be seen beyond them. Potter sits crossed-legged, wearing a Cannons t-shirt and a pair of modest boxer shorts. Draco's eyes roam over his exposed calves and forearms, the latter flexing enticingly as Potter reaches forward to grab a handful of popcorn.
Draco guides Potter back down onto his shaft, his head bobbing eagerly as he sucks from root to tip. He brings a wandering hand up to brush over Draco's balls, give them a light squeeze, and Draco shouts, rising onto the balls of his feet. He feels the familar pressure building, feels his cock throb warningly in the wet heat of Potter's mouth.
“Yes but, Potter— ” Draco starts. This isn’t going how he’d planned. Not that he’d really planned it at all. He’s still surprised he hasn’t been thrown out yet, or enduring hex after hex.
The following morning after breakfast, Headmistress McGonagall asks all the eighth years to stay behind in the Great Hall. Draco braces himself for a lecture —he’s been wondering when she’d address the fight after heading about it — but in fact, all McGonagall does is give them the morning off with the task to find a Christmas tree to for Hangingbone’s classroom. Apparently Hagrid, who usually takes it upon himself to decorate the castle for the holidays, has taken time off to visit family (an idea that Draco thinks should alarm more people than it does). The Headmistress presents as a good opportunity for them to work on
He was next. Draco’s straightens, preparing himself for the inevitable when Potter suddenly crosses the circle. He comes to a stop in front of Ernie, using a wandless spell to fan away the smoke as Ernie gasps. Draco steps back, hoping the smoke will obscure his attempt to withdraw.
"Ron!" Potter laughs, smiling so wide that his teeth are on display, brilliant white and a little crooked. Draco’s alarmed to realize how endearing he finds it. "What are you doing here?"
"You know, maybe this supper club is what you need," Pansy says, after a moment. "Theo's here because of his father, but I had to practically sign my life away to the DMLE for chaperoned visits. I’m positive they’re only allowing it as some kind of test."
he’s placed it. Draco would be touched by the worry in her voice if he didn’t already know that Pansy’s presence is one part concern and two parts knowledge that Draco's favorite hiding spot has a particularly good view of the Prefect’s bathroom, which he, Pansy and Anthony Goldstein still have unfettered access, and that that privilege is one Goldstein has been known to abuse endlessly.
“Something like that,” Ernie returns, grimly. He looks to Draco again. Stands. “Just think about what I’ve said, alright? Happy Christmas, Draco. Harry.”
, the wards refreshed and his window glass repaired, Harry squinted up at the orange glow of street lamps overhead. The heels of Malfoy's shoes announced his presence as he drew up to Harry's side.
When the plates have thankfully been cleared away, individual tubs of ice cream are wheeled out in a metal trolley. Ben and Jerry's comes in a remarkable assortment of flavors and Draco feels rather safe in his selection as he chooses it. Turns out muggle ice cream tastes the same as what he's used to, even if there is no fizzing or whizzing to go along with it.
From the end the table, seated between Millicent and Finnigan, Longbottom looks up. "Alright, Harry?"
Reaching for his quill, Draco ignores Harry in favor of dipping it into his inkpot. He’s using a deep green today, and even in his head, he’s finds it saccharine to think that the color matches Harry’s eyes. When the quill has enough ink, Draco touches it to a scrap of parchment. He glances at Harry out of the corner of his eye. “Are you sure you shouldn’t have been in Slytherin? You’ve taken to us well enough.”
Draco sags. He's been so caught up in his own drama. "Mother, I'm sorry. I'm sure he's fine. We can send Coopey to check on him."
. Of course, Faith and Charity didn’t make it through the war. And neither did my husband.” Hangingbone finally draws her wand, as if coming to a decision. “But
He shuts his eyes. Somehow his wand is already in his hand and as he turns his head away, it aims itself at Ernie’s bottle.
"The lads at the Ministry who cooked up this whole supper business." The steak Karrey places in front of Finnigan sizzles enticingly. "Suppose to be a secret innit? Anonymous donor. There's all sorts of speculation as to who."
"Not yet," says Potter, carefully. "I’m sure Ginny’s ready to kick me out on my arse, but Luna’s put her off it until convocation." He smiles fondly at Lovegood, who smiles back.
Draco concentrates on the setting sun on his face, the zip of the insects flying by. "I couldn’t stand being in that house. I suppose that was the point. Anyone would go nutty being cooped up for too long, but at that time.." he trails off, swallowing hard. "I spent all my time outside. Sunrise to sunset, even sleeping in the garden when I could get away with it. My mother has a thing for flowers. She began planting them as a way to pass the time. I started as a way to keep her company, but I started to enjoy it. We started planting topiaries. Herbs. Trees." He snorts, wistfully. "By the time we were done, we had an entire orchard."
“What am I going to tell my parents?” Draco groans. He doesn’t know why he says the words out loud. He doesn’t even know how much he wants to tell them. He knows they’ve had their suspicions, but confirming as much is a different story altogether.
Staring into Potter’s face is what Draco imagines it’s like to enter the mouth of a lion. He’s a serpent, a beast — every creature unhinging it’s maw wide enough to fill their prey with deadly calm before their jaws snap shut. Unwavering survival versus inevitable destruction. Potter lifts his chin.
means he’s gearing up to say something. “Look, you know how I feel about it. Harry’s a good guy, but he’s always flying by the seat of his pants about something or other.” Ernie shrugs. “I just don’t want you to be one of those things.”
"Their beater is best in the league, but I don't like him much. Bit of a show-off." Potter's eyes widen and Draco feels himself blush. "Their new seeker could use a bit of work," he says quickly, "but their average hasn't dipped yet and they're on track to qualify for the finals."
So it wasn't until Malfoy arrived, hair rumpled, mouth sleep soft, as if he'd risen from a sensuous dream to slip on his tighter-than-regulation-sanctioned uniform and appear before Harry, that he realized he might have a problem. That really, he should have called anyone
“It wasn’t bad,” Weasley nods, and he sounds just as surprised as the others look to hear him say it. “See you around, Malfoy.”
“You’ve been upset lately. Not sleeping. So have I. Haven’t you had times where you laughed even if something wasn’t funny? Upset when you should be happy?” Draco shoots him an accusing look. “You’re irritated right now!”
"I'm aware," Draco snarls. "But that still doesn't explain why Harry Potter’s been the guest of honor at every supper I've attended, despite your assurance that the guests are chosen at random! You had to know something like this would happen eventually!"
He floos to London, then makes his way into the Ministry, exiting the grate and crossing the foyer. Ministry appointed visits were the only trips Draco was allowed to make by himself, for obvious reasons. Mind healers were on level three, a dimly lit stretch of offices far more intimidating than their intended purposes would suggest.
"Now. The last dinner. Sixth year," he adds with emphasis. "It wouldn’t surprise me if it’s a habit you can’t seem to break."
add another thirteen inches before a pair of third years accompanied by a burly fifth year trickle into the room and the light that filters through the murky water outside their window is bright enough to justify breakfast.
Witnesses agree that Malfoy’s influence was more than evident in the proceedings, as Potter did not deign to help a poor crying girl catch her lost crup, nor pose for photographs. However, candid shots reveal that the Death Eater’s thrall is strong, as evidenced by Potter’s glassy-eyed appearance and flushed skin. It is suspected that illegal potion use is at play. Connections have been made to the Malfoys and illegal potions rings in the past.
"Have you been, Milli?" Finnigan continues, turning towards her so there's mistake who he's addressing. "It's brilliant, though a bit rowdy after hours. I think you'd like it."
When it becomes apparent he isn’t planning to leave, Draco does the one thing he’s tried with varying success: ignores him. He’s been doing a good job of it since September, careful to never closely examine the reasons distance suddenly became necessary. What Draco knows is that he needs a book before he can head back to the table, and he needs to his his essay.
Theo’s eyes bounce from Pansy, who isn’t paying him any mind, to the horse, which neighs in a way Draco can’t help but divine as sarcastic.
“Your mattress?” Draco fights to keep his voice steady as he feels his own face heat. “You said mine was nicer, but I have yet to compare the two.”
“I’ll thank you not to threaten me, Weasley. I’m quite comfortable, even if your common room is as hot as a Ridgeback’s arsehole.” Draco pulls at his collar. “Do something nice. That’s what the hat was about right? Trying to sort us as one or the other.”
"I'm a strategist, Draco. You're too intelligent not to know that much. And you're too intelligent to take these suppers at face value."
"Is that all?" He turns back to his horse. Draco is of half a mind to pick up his abandoned trowel and throw it at him.
"I’ve been telling you you’re ordinary for years! Then you actually do something that can’t be denied — you save my life twice — and you don’t want anyone to acknowledge it?!"
“Good.” Draco sits up and folds his legs under him. “Our magic acts up when we’re together but the effects of the curse weaken. If we work at it, we can keep each other from going off the skid. It’s when we’re apart that the effects of the curse increase.” After a pause, Draco shares with them what happened to him in Hogsmeade, as well as his interactions with his friends. Surprisingly, Potter also shares an embarrassing episode about a dramatic outburst that resulted in Seamus wearing a giant bowl full of pudding, and scaring off a parliament of owls after sobbing in The Owlery.
Draco’s throat constricts, his voice tight. "Does it matter? Potter and I are barely acquaintances at this point. Thank Merlin the damn dinner guests rotate each time." He sighs. "I know Potter never wrote back because he doesn't want anything to do with me. And I refuse to embarrass myself again."
that you can pass around! Harry, say something," Ron continued annoyed. Harry just laughed softly into the blond hair before his face.
Curtains in the same shade of red adorn the shop windows and the dark solid wood floor creates a cosy atmosphere that sooner or later encourages every customer to sway consciously or unconsciously to the music. Harry hardly does anything else all day, and today is no exception. To the melodies of Wind of Change.
Draco tilted his head, an enchanting smile touched the corners of his mouth and he gave Harry a featherlight kiss on the lips. "If you're trying to imply that I'm more desperate than you are, I reject all accusations."
"And yet every nook and cranny of your pantry is now filled with tartlets," Draco retorts, still amused. "Have you ever considered at least adding some variety to the range? Or do you only own the one recipe?"
Harry felt like a sponge, absorbing every bit of information with interest. Draco didn’t talk often about his childhood and the curse in combination. He wanted to know more, finally daring to ask his questions. “Does it hurt when you transform?”
had tried to enlighten him? The thought was... disturbing but amusing and distracted Harry from his inner anguish.
"He continues to refuse to answer me," Harry replies. It is not a lie, but neither is it anything unsuitable for Jimar's ears.
No one who has completely given up and no longer sees a spark of a future has anything left to lose. That is the only comfort in hopelessness.
"Forty-two plus twenty-seven, Harry," Draco repeated, his voice purring, slowly kissing along Harry's jawline to his chin.
"Pansy thinks she can convince me of Muggle clothing," Draco explained, turning his head towards Harry and giving him a dazzling smile. "And she thinks I don't notice her slipping me women's clothing."
"This is his diary?" Mr Potter inquires the obvious, hands folded carefully on the tabletop in front of him, eyes on everything but the book. He seems to have to compensate for the initial stare.
To Hermione, no answer seems to be an answer as well, for she nods as if Harry has confirmed her suspicions. "Don't you think it might be better to move on from this and pursue something new?"
"Mate! Hold on, did something happen between you two?" Ron interrupted him with wide eyes. Harry closed his mouth and examined the muffin in front of him with great interest. Ron chuckled in amusement. "I
tired and we have to get up early in the mo –“ Harry tried to distract him, but Ron wasn’t one to be dismissed so easily.
With boiling blood, the feeling of soft lips on his own, a wet tongue exploring his mouth and Draco's body under his hands, Harry let Draco pull him closer to the stable wall, closer to the bushes.
Slowly, Draco lowered the parchment, then looked at Harry with dull eyes that reflected all his hidden pain. “No.”
On two Fridays Harry sits quietly in his bed, does not lift a finger, has his eyes closed and wishes he had never opened the letter from the hospital in June. On three other Fridays, he spends the night drinking in the
to push away his insecurity and guilt. Two days and he would return to London if Draco wouldn't listen to him by then, Harry was sure they would never see each other again. The thought sent a nauseous feeling through Harry. He pulled his knees to his body and wrapped his arms around them. He felt so lost.
He nods, breathing against the wool of his scarf, and watches Victoire sneak up behind Teddy to ruthlessly dump a handful of snow on him. "Jimar told me that the Ministry wants to take away St Mungos' access to his diary."
Now Harry looked up; he didn't want to miss Draco’s expression of pure gratitude. It was the reward for the new need, which Harry decided to call “
“You are not the reason I have made my decision,” Draco said, barely louder than a whisper. Draco seemed to be closer to Harry than he had suspected. And with his face turned towards him, Harry noticed it clearly through the warm breath he felt on his shoulder.
Some students looked around at Seamus in confusion, including the Slytherins, who didn’t really understand what Seamus was getting at yet. Harry already tore at Seamus' upper arm to tell him to keep his bloody mouth shut, but the Irishman was not to be put off. “Can you tell me why Ron named you after the Little Mermaid, Malfoy? Because my friends here have difficulty explaining it to me!”
So it was decided. Harry would go to the Great Lake again the following night and with a bit of luck, this time he wouldn't be in mortal danger and instead get some answers to burning questions. It was impossible to resist his curiosity, coupled with the new urgent need to protect Draco anytime and anywhere. Besides, Harry couldn’t come up with a better solution for now.
Draco's quick breath close to his ear and the blond hair tickled Harry at the tip of his nose. He felt a hand on his shoulder, Seamus congratulating their victory, then the hand was gone again and Harry remembered to let go.
Draco laughed softly and contentedly as he again ran his hand through Harry's stubborn hair. "Good, that makes the rest easy."
The mood was exuberant all day long. Everyone was feverishly awaiting the evening and Harry was also infected by it. A little bit he was interested in this Viktor, but most of all he was looking forward to spending time with Draco again.
Harry knows the answer that is on the tip of Draco's tongue and which he resists, and only for Harry's sake. It's not the "everything" Draco is convinced of, but it's not "nothing" either. It is the one thing Harry strives for but never achieves: Change, the course of life – it’s as if it is overtaking Harry at this very moment, rather than gradually unfolding as it does with all the others.
I did not perceive Malfoy's childhood or upbringing as an excuse for his behaviour, but I still accepted it as one of many explanations. The fact that neutrality towards Malfoy seemed to be my new commandment helped tremendously.
Draco's tongue licked over Harry's lower lip and he hummed contentedly. "Love, your eyes are closed, you cannot see me."
He does not know what he did to Malfoy to accuse him of being to blame for his misery. If he had hurled those words at Harry just a few weeks ago, Harry would have reacted with full-fledged anger. Malfoy brought his life's path on himself and he once knew that.
"Mr Longbottom, it's my fault Draco even left the farm," Harry hurriedly interjected. He was unwilling to imagine how Mr Malfoy would react to his son's attempt to escape. "If there's anyone you need to inform, it's Sirius. I am willing to bear the full consequence!"
As soon as I had crossed the greenhouse, I turned into a passage that led me into the castle. I became painfully aware that I would not only be saying goodbye to Draco on this last visit, but also to all of this. I would miss being able to visit Hogwarts once a week. Resolutely, I shook my head to banish those kinds of thoughts from my mind. I could worry about that later.
Flitwick began to explain the notes on the blackboard, but Harry just couldn’t concentrate on the wizard’s words. From the corner of his eye, he could see Draco finishing his notes, shifting uneasily around his chair and pressing a hand on his right forearm. Wait. Wasn’t this the spot where the waterspirit had hurt him? Did the wound hurt again? To Harry’s knowledge, it had almost healed, so where did the sudden pain come from?
Before Harry could put his finger on the bell, the door flew open and less than two seconds later something heavy hit Harry's chest. Surprised, Harry stumbled back a step, caught himself again, wrapped his arms around the body and pulled Draco closer to his chest. Hell, he had missed him so much, the thrill of reunion never really diminished.
Harry follows Filly suit, pushing back his chair and standing up, resisting the urge to stretch his limbs. "I don't see how I can –"
?" Mr Potter interrupts Filly with an expression on his face that displays more concern than confusion. Anja credits him with sympathy points, as not everyone would dare interrupt an Auror. On the other hand, she knows that Mr Potter started Auror training a few years ago and almost certainly knows the Aurors present in this room at least fleetingly, so this feat is only half as impressive.
“Has it been like this since you were born? Is this a lifetime-thing?” Harry continued to ask unabashedly. Now it was too late anyway, so Draco could be completely honest right away.
Harry nods and puts his glasses down on the washbasin. He glances at the bathtub filled with water and ice cubes and looks searchingly around the room. Hermione is holding a peculiar device, which she has connected to Harry's fingertips and explained is a measuring device. She currently has Ron tie her hair back and is rolling up the sleeves of her jumper. Draco is standing in the other corner of the room, pale as a sheet and with his arms wrapped around his body.
Harry twisted his mouth into a smile, even if it didn’t reach his eyes. He didn’t want to have this time pressure, he didn’t want to have to choose between one risk or the other, he didn’t want to have to see Draco go, he didn’t want to have to convince him to do something he didn’t want to do, but he had no choice. His heart would never forgive him if he gave up now. His mind and his
Harry's cheeks became hot and he had to force himself not to lower his gaze to the tips of his toes. What a conceited –
"Oh, sorry," Harry murmured half-heartedly, propped his elbows on the hay next to Draco's head and stopped the subconscious movement of his hips against Draco's leg. Instead, his attention fell on rosy soft lips and he sighed longingly while he let Draco's hair glide through his fingers.
“Hello? Is anybody there?” Really, a glorious question, he was at least as smart as the people from his cousin's horror movies who asked this question frequently.
Draco lifted a hand and trailed the tips of his fingers down the back of my neck, along my hairline. I could feel the goosebumps all the way down my legs.
I kept silent, eyeing the laces of my trainers and wondering if Malfoy had resented his mother for her mistakes. If he had ever gotten angry because she had introduced him to this philosophy that had caused so much pain in the world. He must have felt his mother's love, certainly, he had also felt a sense of responsibility towards her, but that did not preclude him from possibly reproaching her for her mistakes.
One more time he wants to listen to Draco gifting him with the word "love" as if they are even remotely capable of grasping the meaning behind it.
On Tuesday, precisely at eight o'clock, when Harry is about to hop into the shower after his daily morning jog, he decides that he has every right to regret his decision.
First, there are Draco's fingers inside him again, groping places inside him that leave him panting and whimpering, and then at last he feels entirely claimed by Draco. He pushes his hips towards the intoxicating sensation, feels Draco's hot breath on the back of his neck, the lips grazing the skin at his hairline and gasps softly as Draco shoves two fingers into his slightly parted mouth.
Harry had to press a hand to his mouth to avoid making a surprised sound, turning bright red. He didn't even see much, but enough to fuel his imagination. Draco stood with his back to him, wearing only a thin towel around his hips and he was stretching his tired limbs. The pool was just filling with water.
Harry's gaze fell on Draco's lips. They looked at least as soft as they felt. "Maybe you two have a spiritual bond. If you hurt yourself, he hurts himself too."
Just as Harry is about to cross the threshold that takes him and Draco out of the hospital, an all too familiar voice emerges from behind him.
- NO! Harry shook his head so as not to be carried away again by the intoxicating facts. He had lost control, but how was that even possible?
Harry came to this conclusion sometime later when he went into the dining hall with Ron and Hermione (who by now had gotten along splendidly and made it their business to exchange embarrassing stories about Harry). The dining hall was truly a
to you and you will become his luck or misfortune. I think you should really be sure that you can live with your decision no matter what your future will ultimately look like!”
didn’t want to know anything about the sex life of his best friends, but he thanked them inwardly for the insight. Ron pouted while Hermione grinned at Harry with amusement. For this moment Harry felt amazingly free of burden; he really had missed laughing so easily with his friends.
, it really spurred him on. Additionally, he suddenly seemed to seize his chance to get to know the Slytherin in a new way. Without hate, without rivalry, without grief, without pain, without dark memories. The past was forgotten, only the present counted, even if the future caused a lot of nervousness.
"Possibly," Draco responded calmly. He pushed himself off the doorframe and walked over to his bed. "Is it your thing to stare at people without asking?"
Malfoy's expression resembled one of someone who restrained themselves from rolling their eyes, but he remained composed – too composed – and raised his shoulders slightly. "Whatever you say. You must know."
"I liked it,” Harry muttered instead, buried his nose in the nape of Draco's neck and happily inhaled the delicious smell of his shampoo.
"Come here," Draco instructed, kneeling on the blanket and tapping with his fingertips on it. Harry's knees gave way and he came rather inelegantly to sit next to Draco. Draco smiled gently, then took Harry's hand in his and kissed him on the lips as light as a feather. Harry felt himself being pressed against the bark of the tree again, although it wasn’t too painful while sitting. Draco pushed his knees between Harry's legs, stopped the tender kisses only to continue them casually on Harry's fingertips.
“So tell me, Potter,” Pansy points her wand at his face. “Have you ever considered what you’d look like with a face full of fur? I've always imagined you as the Dumbledore type, myself.”
Draco hadn’t missed the way the Headmistress had looked at them as she mentioned supper, had made the all too right assumption that wherever they went, they would spending the rest of the evening together. Heat rushed to Draco’s ears and spread across his face. It would be naive to think the rumors of his relationship with Potter hadn’t spread to the faculty.
"My teeth," Malfoy smirked and exposed the objects in question. "I use whitening strips. I even have a muggle dentist I see twice a year, thanks to Granger." He moved to stand in front of Harry, colorless eyes impish under pale lashes. "But if you're curious about the rest.."
“S’not bad,” Draco laughs quietly, licking along his digits. He falls onto his back next to Potter with a sigh. He’s so hard, he could probably hammer nails with his cock at this point.
“Piss off,” say Blaise. There’s no winsome smile now, just teeth. “I suppose you think that’s funny.”
"I'm in recovery mode. Soft food, soft voices." Finnigan grins, although the gesture seems to cost him. He immediately cringes. "Took Dean out to The Veela's Touch until the wee hours, with the intention to sleep the rest of the day away. This is technically breakfast."
Draco looks down at his plate. He supposes it Gwarp or the rock cakes. This is what he gets for surrounding himself with more and more people with a low threshold for danger.
“I don’t see that anything funny about what I’ve said. See that you don’t get up to any mischief while you’re here or I’ll send you right back out that door.”
Potter took a deep breath. “Hey. Forget it. Maybe, you can come by the Tower when you’re done?” He runs an errant hand through his hair and tugs at a knot. “I’m not up for skating. We can just hang out or something.”
"Fate is a mysterious thing. Besides, I'd regret missing a chance at seeing you in those darling pajamas. It's been so long, don't you usually save them for special occasions?" Pansy turns to Potter, scooting closer to elbow his side. "Whenever I drop in on him, he's in his pants and jumper, stuffing his face with shortbread cookies and pouring over star charts. I'm going to report him to the BNSC."
Draco raises his chin and walks with all the aplomb and poise he’s ever been taught. He’s relieved when he spots not only Blaise and Pansy, but Ernie waiting for him on the end of the eighth year table. He drops wearily into the seat next to Pansy who pulls his arm as soon as he draws within range.
Harry laughs. Presses his palms flat to Draco’s back and slides them down to grip the flesh of his arse, pulling his cheeks apart as he picks up his pace. Draco’s pajamas are pushed down around his calves, Harry’s down to mid-thigh. His skin is damp and Draco’s hands slips, finding purchase in the sheets as his mouth falls open. “Harry,” It comes out as a strangled warning. Dolt that he is, Potter just laughs again and wraps his fingers around Draco’s prick, gives his a few skillful pulls to match the rhythm of his hips as Draco moans.
Potter hums in agreement. After the incident at the skating rink, they’d called a truce of sorts, making efforts to work together in class, pass each other items, and be altogether pleasant. While it’d kept them from any kind of emotional outbursts, it’d had a less than stellar effect on their magic. In advanced transfiguration, Draco’s mushroom had not transformed into a brolly, but instead stretched the mushroom’s stalk until it threatened to break through the ceiling, all the while fat drops of rain splashing upon them.
Entrees done, Draco's plate promptly vanishes, the tablecloth as immaculate as when he'd first sat down. Wiping his fingers on the heated towel Karrey offers him, Draco selects a slice of cake for afters. Harry declines, seemingly content to nurse his cup of tea-- a decision Draco both tries, and fails, to reconcile with after years spent observing Potter's developing treacle habit. That is, until the cake arrives. It's chocolate: moist and decadent, creamy mousse sandwiched between two layers, topped with a chocolate ganache. Exactly the kind Draco would consume without a second thought.
He shakes his head. "I do. We were both awful to each other. I didn't know any better. A lot was happening." Harry chokes out a laugh, but there's no amusement to it. "Besides, we didn't we just hate each other. We hated each other's beliefs, families, friends... you wouldn't believe the amount of times Hermione had to talk Ron and I down."
Draco ducks his head, as the others smile, slowly removing the gifts he needs to wrap from his bag. He remembers Fred Weasley. This is only the second Christmas since his death -- a death Draco, no matter how roundabout, had a hand in. Even though he’s formally apologized, both in letter and in person, the cowardly side of himself would rather avoid the awkward reminder. His presence is likely reminder enough.
.” He doesn’t miss the way Potter’s face heats at that, the thrill that runs through him. “Haven’t you been listening at all, Potter? Test it. Try something else.”
"Aren't we missing someone?" Potter interjects loudly, doing an abysmal job of trying to change the subject or lose Draco's suddenly piqued interest. Pansy's eyes light up in a way that says she scents blood as well.
It is Halloween, rather the anniversary of his parent’s death, which is why he has taken the day off. Later he will visit his parents' grave, but he still has time to take care of things he can influence. As a result, the morning feels a lot more fateful than Harry would like to admit as he hurries down the corridors of St Mungo's Hospital, struggling not to count the stares cast his way. Sometimes he feels like the long hair provided him more cover than he realised.
"So why couldn't you tell me that?" Draco leaps off the bed, running a furious hand through his hair. "I wouldn't have judged you! I'm seeing the same fucking Mind Healer if you hadn't noticed!"
She nods, a wane smile on her face. "I know. Don't worry about me. I just want to make sure you'll be alright. Run along now, it's almost seven."
Karrey brings their menus, and there's a lull in conversation as everyone deliberates. When the entrees are presented, much faster this time than at the market place, their plates are laden with all form of decadence - no galleon has been spared. Potter however, frowns.
"Really honing those Auror skills, aren’t you Potter," Draco says breathlessly, the smile fading from his face when Potter tenses. "What are you--" Draco looks around, then back to Potter. "What are you doing here?"
Draco nearly chokes, coughing as he tried not to dribble chocolate down his chin. “Piss off,” he wheezed. Potter’s face looks strangely fond as he passes Draco a napkin. He dabs at his mouth and when he’s confident he’s done making an arse of himself, he tosses his blonde hair back to great effect.
“Yes, Potter, don’t be so puritan about it.” Draco motions for him to get up and he leads him to the corridor at the other end of the room. “I’ll leave the door open if you’re afraid I’m going to ravish you.”
A thick, woolen scarf wrapped around her neck, Professor Hangingbone nods curtly. “I received your note. I’d like a moment alone, if I may.”
"It’s a form of treatment." Draco climbs to his feet, removing his soiled gardening gloves. He knocks them against his trousers a few times, eyes focused on the ground. "It starts at the end of the week, and I have to do it if I’m to return to any sense of normalcy. There's nothing more to say about it."
“You’re just mad because he’s the only beater to hold his average the whole season,” Draco pats Ernie’s shoulder with mock sympathy. “If it were you out there, you’d have already been knocked off your broom.”
Potter grabs Weasley by the back of his hideous ‘R’ jumper and lowers him down onto the cushions he’s suddenly transfigured out of marshmallows. He tucks one cushion behind Weasley’s back as another slips itself under his feet and onto his lap, propping him up until there are so many pillows surrounding Weasley, he looks like a ginger-haired snowman.
“Talk to her like what? I’m politely pointing out the obvious. Like the fact that you’re not making any of this easier having a temper tantrum!” Draco throws himself down so that he’s lying on his back. It’s a cloudless day and staring up at the sky feels like he’s staring into forever. He closes his eyes and takes a few deep breathes, relieved as the tension drains out of him, slowly. To his left he hears Potter exhale in a long sigh.
and the reminder of Potter’s presence is reassuring. Honestly Draco thinks he should be used to the stares by now. He certainly would have eaten up this kind attention a few years ago when he’d been so desperate for it.
"I meant every word I said to you. Even if you don't want to believe me, it's the truth." Harry took a deep breath. He doubted the explanation would help his case with Draco, but it was worth a try. "The bet or the competition, or whatever it was, it was a mistake. I thought at the time that I'd be doing Ron a favour by agreeing. He was satisfied and I didn't give it another thought. That was all. I wasn't using you, I would never be able to do that."
There is not really a precept of what a person should feel when they encounter the reason for an upheaval in their own future. It's not
"A lot of things," I thought aloud. "I mean, obviously most people aren't just one or the other. The majority do things every day that are both good and evil. And then there are the people who you think are just one thing, but even they make mistakes." I paused and threw another stone into the lake before continuing. "Dumbledore was one of those people. Who would have thought that even he could make mistakes?"
But no grief or sorrow emanated from the Slytherin. As if he had completely come to terms with the fact that his life was almost over. Or maybe it was like the last glimmer of pure happiness and joy before the curse carried him away and didn’t bring him back. Harry had already heard about this phenomenon. Old or ill people who were taken by the hand of life shortly before their death and were allowed a few days of happiness before they collapsed like a lifeless shell and left life behind for good.
Draco was far more talented with his fingers than Harry. He actually seemed to be pursuing an idea and didn’t just slap paint on the animal mindlessly. Harry couldn’t help but indulge in his fascination. The trees and the stable wall provided shade, and yet Draco's hair shone in the sunlight like a halo. Draco wore it in a bun at the nape of his neck, tied so loosely that half the strands fell loosely into his face. The movement of the pale hand that tucked the strands behind his ear was so subconscious and natural that Harry almost felt envious. Envious of
. However, most of them had met in a lounge not far from the dining hall and had played table football, cards or chess. So had Harry and Ron. The evening had been nice, the atmosphere relaxed.
Two hours later, dressed only in his invisibility cloak and swimming trunks, Harry crept through the slightly cool corridors of Hogwarts, which became progressively less cold during the nights. Eventually, the summer heat would catch up with them here. He stopped in front of the door of the Prefects’ Bathroom and took another deep breath. He was really just making a fuss. Draco wouldn't see him naked, only in swimming shorts. It was nothing special, Ron and his other Quidditch comrades had already seen much more of him.
Draco paused, seeming to be at odds with himself, but then he exhaled loudly and continued writing. “Because it’s not a girl.”
Harry frowned in confusion, but simply complied with the request to play along. “I don't really know. Hermione said there are several names. Mermaids, sirens, nymphs – no wait! I think it was called Merman?" Harry replied, visibly struggling to recall all the information correctly.
Harry searches unsuccessfully for Lucius Malfoy in Draco's appearance and waits patiently for Draco to continue.
Malfoy, who had laid half on top of him in his sleep. Harry's heart skipped a beat and he gave himself a few seconds to collect himself. Draco was lying in his bed. Draco was lying in his bed and on his chest. That was
Hermione and Ron walked a bit ahead of Harry and Draco and talked quietly. Lost in thought, Harry reached for Draco's hand, interlaced their fingers and spent his time, once again, watching Draco's profile. The pointy features, the nobly curved nose, the delicate lip contours, the high cheekbones, the storm grey eyes and the hair tied back at the neck looked particularly enchanting in the moonlight.
Harry tried hard not to stare at Draco too much during the day, but he was not successful at all. He was fascinated by him, of course. After all, he had discovered something quite captivating about the Slytherin. The teachers and students around him showed little understanding for his supposedly inexplicable staring and so he was admonished three times in Potion class alone that he should please focus more on his work and less on
Draco just made a refusing sound, closed his eyes and tilted his head back, just like Harry had done. But Harry wouldn’t have got a hard-on at the sight of himself, Draco had him having difficulty standing upright at all. The water poured over the pale skin, soaked the blond hair and made him shimmer silvery. Drops of water got caught in Draco's long lashes, ran down his cheeks like tears, moistened his lips in such a way that Harry could hardly resist the urge to kiss them.
Healer Isaksen appears exhausted. Her usually neatly tied back hair is dishevelled, displaying the evidence of draining hours of non-stop hard work. Wisps of hair dangle in her face or are tucked carelessly behind her ears. She sits in Jimar's office, on his chair, countless stacks of papers in front of her and laboriously massages the bridge of her nose.
It is not until Wednesday evening that Ron manages to get Harry out of the room. Hermione stays with Draco during the time. Harry's apathetic state does not abate outside Draco's room either. He does get into the shower after Ron gently but firmly drags him into the bathroom and changes into fresh clothes, but he continues to eat his meals with Draco. He gets convinced to sit in an armchair next to Draco's bed and Hermione and Ron take turns paying regular visits to Harry as well as Draco.
; with a high ceiling and huge windows. There were several tables scattered throughout the room where everyone could find their place. In total there were no more than twelve participants, but the volume of conversation was enormous. Harry tried his best to remember the new names and faces. Ginny introduced him and Ron to the others in record time.
Mr Potter looks up and at Anja, who returns the gaze firmly. She does not believe in magicless mind control, but perhaps Mr Potter can tell by looking at her how important his decision is.
Aubrey, Jimar's fiancée, is the reason why he decided to move to England back then. According to the stories Jimar tells him about her, however, he cannot comprehend why the two of them are still a couple. Upon Harry's cautious enquiry, he learnt that sometimes it is easier to stay true to old habits than to embark on a completely uncertain path. So it is with faded love.
"That's not an answer," I informed him, concentrating on detecting every movement of his face. "Are you trying to avoid it because I'm right?"
After Draco is seated in his wheelchair again, Harry hugs Jimar goodbye. Painfully, he realises for the second time that day that he has no idea if he will ever see the wizard again. Months in which seeing Jimar's face was a part of everyday life simply dissolve into dust.
Harry watches the Auror place the diary in the briefcase and then magically close it. He considers his options. Healer Isaksen has surely only left Harry here alone with an Auror because Jimar is still present. She would never allow any priority other than Malfoy's recovery to develop in this matter. But Harry knows Auror Headquarters. He has heard enough from Ron and Hermione and does not believe that the government has suddenly developed an interest in coddling Azkaban's convicts with special privileges. No, there is more.
Harry continued plucking his guitar and was truly tempted to ask Blaise for help. He was Draco's best friend. He knew him like no one else, his advice was all Harry needed right now. So Harry cleared his throat uneasily and looked intently at his fingers as he spoke. "There's this thing. I... know something and I am keeping this thing from another person, even though I know that the truth would be... better. I'm just afraid that the truth might hurt the other person and I don't know if it wouldn't be better for both of us to keep quiet."
Harry's breath slowed, and realisation flooded over him. Draco was trapped in his own past. It was only understandable. For him, the biggest mistake of his life was about to be repeated. He was confused. He didn't know what to rely on anymore, his own decisions seemed wrong, for they had led him to get attached to Harry. And Harry had been a mistake, at least in Draco's eyes.
"I think... that's enough," Draco whispered almost, then his gaze fell on Harry's lips and Harry's heart skipped a beat. The mood shifted from nervous uncertainty to desperate longing in a matter of seconds. Harry had no intention of resisting the temptation, nor did Draco, for he was already leaning in to press his lips eagerly on Harry's.
Draco instantly lowered his gaze and stared intently at an indefinable spot in front of him as he plucked Harry's shirt from his shoulder and hurriedly spread it out in front of him to sit on it. His cheeks had meanwhile taken on a red hue. "Pretty cocky, Potter," he murmured, obviously struggling to keep the last shred of self-respect.
On Thursday evening, Harry is listening to the strains of Schumann and absently leafing through the Daily Prophet when he decides that his theory about the fog and the protection spells is plausible enough to pursue. However, not sturdy enough to confront Malfoy about it. He does not even know if Malfoy knows about the protection spells. That is also the reason why he finds himself the following Friday silent and at a loss for words, sitting on a school bench opposite Malfoy in an otherwise empty classroom.
”Yep and he liked it, so save it! Anyway, I’m gonna get going, so wish me luck.“ With this, Harry rose without paying further attention to his barely touched food. Hermione blew him a kiss and Ron cheered with his cup into the air, wishing him “long steadiness“, which prompted Harry to flee the Great Hall even faster, hoping that Ron’s words had gone unheard by Draco.
Harry blinked at Draco, who returned the look unimpressed. "Not... in this case." He felt the heat rising from the back of his neck into his cheeks. Heavens, he should pull himself together, he was no longer a little schoolboy.
"Come and visit me sometime if you get the chance," Jimar bids Harry farewell, patting him on the back amicably. "I'm only a Portkey trip away."
The friction didn't help Harry's condition in the slightest, instead, it only got tighter in his trousers and Harry couldn't suppress the wheezing. Draco's lips moved along Harry's jaw, his fingers running up Harry's upper arms, over his shoulders and down his back. Blond strands of hair tickled Harry's cheek, driving him half-mad.
” just then (as it was at least as serious as an illness) but nothing of the sort was apparent in the blond man's expression. His face was blank instead, which surprised and confused Harry. “Merlin, don't get so excited, I don't know how to handle that.”
And Draco kissed Harry again. Much more urgent than before. Harry truly had to try hard to keep up. He let his hand gently slide down Draco's waist, Draco responded with a pleasant sigh into the kiss, which gave Harry goosebumps at once. Draco's fingers found Harry's neck, slid up his cheek, to his nape and into his hair.
Harry remains standing in the doorway, staring at Draco in bewilderment, struggling to put names to the feelings Draco's awakening evokes in him. Draco returns the stare for a few seconds, lowering it all too soon to his hands in his lap.
Harry closes his eyes, rinses the soap out of his hair and steps out of the shower cubicle. Back then, he dropped out of Auror training to escape those times. He does not like that Malfoy has brought them back to him. And he dislikes even more that he agreed to be involved in Malfoy's private affairs. Although Malfoy clearly had wanted this, hadn’t he? Why else would he have given Harry,
“If it soothes you,” Draco began with a gentle voice that contrasted sharply with his yearning eyes. “
Pup gracefully leaps onto the armrest of the couch right behind Draco and makes himself comfortable on it. Draco does not even flinch. Instead, he casts a fleeting glance at Harry's hand, apparently struggling with himself, but eventually scoots slowly closer to Harry. So close, he hardly has to extend his hand to tentatively place it next to Harry's.
“More like who can make the most noise,” Pansy sniffs. She places painted fingers to Theo’s chin and turns his head away from her. “And yet I can hear you masticate as if you cast a Sonorous on yourself.”
, where he’d angrily purchased a square of Alihosty fudge in order to test it against his symptoms. Alihosty, the primary ingredient in Laughing Potions, seemed like the most obvious place for him to start. While it was a long shot to think that someone had possibly snuck the leaf’s essence into his breakfast or hexed him, food related paranoia was something Draco was readily prepared for. Unfortunately, once he’d returned to his room and ran all the diagnostic spells he could think of on both the Alihosty and himself, there were no results strong enough to support his theory. Especially when, in the next moment, a wave of heartrendingly sweet contentment washed over him, despite his frustration.
“You two are getting along well,” Parvati says, spooning a bit oatmeal. She uses it to point to Pansy from the other side of the table. “They’re together almost as much as we are these days.”
“Are you sure I didn’t write the story?” Potter glares back at him. “Because you’re certainly treating things that way.”
“I don’t know, Professor,” Finnigan grins, gesturing at Potter. “Wouldn’t be the first time Hogwarts’ produced something unique.” A few people laugh good-naturedly. Potter grimaces. Runs a hand through his awful hair and it lingers just a bit too long over the curls that Draco knows hide his scar.
"Karrey is not allowed to visit Malfoy Manor without express permission. He is the one asking the auror to let Mr. Draco come."
in anyone, no matter their gender, we would support you.” She finishes the last with a delicate sniff, but never breaks eye contact. Their gaze remains locked for a long moment, Draco trying to send all the gratitude and sheer
Then the carriage jolts and Draco pulls off roughly, panting. Harry's stares up at him, his chest heaving, his face flushed. His lips are so full, they look bruised and Draco wants to bite down on the pout of his lower lip, feel the flesh of it between his teeth. Dimly Draco registers that he's hard, that the night air feels cool against the back of his neck. The horses have slowed. Draco dismounts from Harry's lap and flees for the safety of the seat opposite.
saved him. Everything had gone exactly as they had planned. Well, as Harry had planned. What the future would hold was written in the stars, but Harry didn’t want to worry about that now.
to understand what Draco's lack of sexual experience had to do with all this, but the realisation just wouldn't hit him.
So he goes about his day, feeds Pup, has breakfast, brews tea and then sits with Draco in the drawing room, where he greets him with a small smile but remains on the windowsill, silently watching the rain fall. He is wearing one of Harry's jumpers and the green fluffy socks Harry got from Molly for Christmas two years ago. Something about the sight warms Harry's heart.
“Your description is very similar to the typical Merman, but I just can't find anything about Mermen who are also wizards and can transform back and forth.”
The pain subsided as quickly as it had come, but still, the aftermath made Harry tremble all over his body and brought sweat to his brow. Holy shit, that had been worse than expected. Even though the pain continued to subside, Harry found it hard to see or hear properly. He hurriedly reached for his limbs as if he had to make sure that he really wasn’t injured. He heard a voice speaking to him.
just mounted the horse without help, whilst looking far too elegant for it to be considered untrained.
A smile touched the corner of Harry's mouth. He continued to hold Draco's wrists tightly over his head, his other hand he led to Draco's mouth. Draco opened his lips for Harry's fingers, didn't break eye contact, while he started sucking on them with a little too much devotion. Harry's cheeks burned, his erection twitched, but he just exhaled calmly and moved his wet fingers between Draco's legs.
Without a thought in his mind, Harry rushed into the stables, grabbed Hetja's snaffle while he was still racing, arrived at her stall and greeted the mare by putting the snaffle on her. He lacked the time for a friendly greeting. Hetja got nervous at once, apparently adapting to Harry's emotions. Harry led her out of the stable and to one of the nearby benches. He climbed on it and then on Hetja's back. Had he had more time, he would have chosen a saddle, but it was denied him.
Maybe Draco really was insane. But hadn’t he said that his body would long for the curse to be broken? What kind of willpower did Draco actually possess that he managed to resist like this? Harry wouldn’t have been able to do that for sure, he didn’t even manage to resist Draco, even if he probably should have done so. After all, he was about to rip his heart out.
Draco stubs out his cigarette on the saucer of the tea set placed on the table directly in front of him. "I doubt you could find enough people to stuff with that amount."
"I think I got a cramp in my thigh," Draco whispered suddenly, almost reproachfully. Harry laughed, felt for Draco's thigh with his free hand and pulled the hollow of his knee closer to him so he could massage him unhindered. Draco sighed contentedly and pressed his nose against Harry's neck. "You smell of sex," he noted mumbling, shoving his hand into dark hair and imitated Harry's massage movement there.
I kept running, towards the crimson sun, barely feeling the twinge in my ribs and throat. The pain in my chest overshadowed everything.
After a while, Draco offered Harry a sip of tea. He kept the apple to himself, probably to avoid reminding Harry of certain things, but tonight Harry would have preferred the apple. Since Draco wouldn’t take no for an answer anyway, Harry drank a tiny little sip. That would be fine, Draco had drunk most of it anyway.
It was not the end of the world. George had recommended that I take the week off anyway to recover from my hospital stay. Of course, nothing was further from my mind than recuperation. Now I had to make the most of the little time I had left.
do you think I’ve been trying to do all this time? A little hint: It’s not watering flowers!” Harry replied angrily. He knew that they were both at a dead end, but he was too frustrated to think about it.
And with that, a warm welcome to Draco’s terrifying side, which Harry didn’t like to experience. At least he didn’t have any claws at the moment that he could stab in Harry’s throat or heart. This was a relief, but he still carried a working wand and had the ability to cause pain to Harry with his gaze alone.
Harry can sense that these are just empty phrases leaving the Auror's mouth, but he remains silent. The feud between the Ministry and St Mungo's Hospital is truly none of his business.
"Look at me," Draco whispered, his voice piercing straight into my chest without encountering any obstruction and finding itself echoed in the eager pounding of my heartbeat.
Option number 1: Overpower him and take his blood without consent. His innocence along with it, just to be sure. Okay, no, that was really not an option.
to help Draco, he didn't care about the circumstances. Woman or man, it didn’t matter as long as one of them was willing to get it on with Draco. Otherwise, Harry would probably have to do it himself. Harry quickly erased these thoughts from his brain before he could turn red.
Harry's mind is reeling and he has to scramble to get a proper sentence together. "But ... what does that mean?"
"Don't freak out, Ron. Hermione is a good egg," Harry encouraged his best friend with a knowing grin on his lips. Hermione matched Ron’s taste precisely, he would act like the biggest idiot. This could only be fun.
Ron stares incredulously first at the grown stack of parchment and then at his father, who has the nerve to grin gleefully. "Believe it or not, that's what I'm trying to do. While you have nothing better to do than harass me."
So he let Draco lead him behind the stable, tied Hetja to a hanging branch of a birch tree and placed the buckets of paint on the outside wall of the stable, sorted according to the colours of the rainbow. There was even a garden hose and an outdoor faucet in case paint should drip on Draco's
A few minutes passed before their breath calmed down, when Draco tried to get up, Harry pulled him back to his chest. He wanted to lie here only a few more minutes, bare to the naked skin, with Draco at his side. Draco didn't object, wrapped one leg around Harry, lay against his chest, his head against Harry's shoulder. Harry, lost in thought, ran his fingers through blond hair, Draco drew circles on Harry's chest with the tip of his finger and they both listened to the roar of thunder and the howling wind.
Harry furrows his eyebrows, wishing for abilities that would cause Draco to never want to look away again. "I don't think it's funny either."
Malfoy brushed a second tear from his cheek with the back of his hand and finally looked at me. "I love her very much, too."
Suddenly, it struck Draco that he would have to ask Harry to cover Edward's eyes – being devoured by the Steps of Martyrdom would surely not be an acceptable last impression of him.
The blood rushed in his ears and he truly forgot his manners. With one swift movement, he grabbed Draco’s leg and positioned it close to his head while at the same time pointing it outwards. A blind man would have noticed what Harry was up to, but Draco was too busy thrusting his hip against Harry’s lips and panting enthusiastically to pay attention.
“Because he looks like a fish and acts like a spoiled princess,” Ron said out of nowhere. While Harry had to bite his tongue hard not to shout at Ron that Draco was nothing of the sort and Ron simply had no sense of taste, Seamus nodded contentedly; the reason seemed to be enough for him, even if the explanation for Draco's new nickname was even worse than what Harry would have thought of if he would have gotten to it.
Surprised, Harry flinched and turned to the source of the voice. Draco stood a few meters away from Harry, leaning against the stone as well and watching him amusedly. How long had he been standing there? And could he still read Harry’s mind? That would be most unpleasant, because just by seeing Draco, Harry imagined the most indecent things he wanted to do with him.
Harry raised an eyebrow unaffectedly, feigning indifference was beginning to be fun. “A pleasure to see you too,” Harry added and smiled a little.
An invisible weight lifts from Harry's shoulders. He will be able to keep his promise. He will return to Draco.
"We will talk about this, Harry James Potter, even if I have to force every word out of your confounded mouth!"
Malfoy was a labyrinth, with a new unresolved question lurking around every corner, but I kept that to myself. The greatest question I faced was undoubtedly what had happened to him after the war had ended. For he had changed. It was as if someone had begun to dig up the weeds after endless years of neglect.
“Maybe your true love is the ocean after all, you just don’t know it yet,” speculated Harry, another attempt at a joke that couldn’t have been more inappropriate.
I considered his choice of people to be cowardly. They had all accepted the apology, no matter how muted that acceptance had turned out to be. And Malfoy had been aware of that when he had chosen them. When I had asked him about it, he had shown me a memory of him sorting through a wooden chest with countless letters in it. They all were apologies from him, written but unsent because he did not want to disrupt the lives of those who had moved on.
than he had been a few minutes ago. It still didn't look healthy. Ron held on quite tight to his saddle and reins as he was thrown up and down on the back of the pony. The abstruse image was surpassed by Ron's beaming smile. Harry bit his tongue hard to keep from laughing at him.
Harry was truly grateful for the help of his best friends. Both of them were immediately aware of the gravity of the situation, so Draco’s fate received no mocking comments from Ron and no pointed derision from Hermione. The urge to help someone in need outweighed the fact that this someone was Draco Malfoy. Harry could only thank them for that, he had no energy to discuss whether Draco was worth saving. He felt as if he had to shout out into the world that this was the case and that Harry would help him without contradiction.
There is nothing Harry can do. He remains frozen in place, listening to his heartbeat pounding in his ears and trying his best to ignore the pressure on his temples. Aubrey's gaze travels downwards and settles on his gripped wand. As she looks Harry in the face again, something like realisation flits across her expression.
Draco threw Harry an amused look over his shoulder, Harry's knees felt like Molly's Jelly. Somehow, he managed to walk down the hallway without making a complete idiot of himself. Draco pushed open the door to their room, they crossed the threshold, Harry's stomach exploded with excitement. The door fell shut behind them, Draco turned on his heel to Harry, his gaze drifted greedily to Harry's lips and –
Harry endeavours to keep his voice steady. "Something has happened and matters have unfolded in a way that it has turned out to be best that I tell you about it."
"Tell me about Malfoy, I'd rather have that than the same old story," Ginny prompts him and with a polite smile grabs a fresh champagne glass from one of the trays the waiters wandering around have at the ready.
He told of the coldness that had not been willing to leave him, no matter how hard he had tried to find some warmth. Of tasks that had been demanded of him, although everything inside him had resisted. Of suffering he had spinelessly inflicted on others. And of pain that had followed when he had refused.
I spoke in a surprisingly composed voice, considering the fact that Malfoy had just implied the worthlessness of an entire group of people. I did not let my tone indicate that my blood was boiling in my veins and that I genuinely would have liked to push him out of the window. No, I still retained that much control.
Draco, feeling his skin as if by accident at the nape of his neck and the base of his ears, and noticing his tiny reactions to it, is a temptation Harry cannot resist.
Harry sighed but shook his head as he gestured in the air that Draco was welcome to take the fruit. Oh wasn’t it frustrating having to work with an uncooperative mer
He had only listened with half an ear, but that got his attention. "Two things: I don't know anything about designers and I prefer
Harry hears himself exhale noisily and slumps against the back of his chair. "And you want me to act as the anonymous informant," he states soberly.
insects," he cursed under his breath, and Harry burst out laughing. A panicked, crawling Draco was a bloody funny sight after all. "That's not
"I know," Harry heard himself respond defiantly. "The skirt suited you, okay? And I think you would look good in knickers too." Holding his breath, Harry waited for an answer.
They quickly found themselves back in their old rhythm, picked up where they had ended it and started to deepen it. Draco pushed Harry backwards against the lilac backrest, Harry hardly felt the pain in his shoulder, only felt Draco's warm breath on his lips. Harry's hands found their way up to Draco's waist, pulled the blond closer to him. Draco allowed it to happen, his own hands cupping Harry's face.
"And that's not even all. Behind the guesthouse, there are still the fields and a barn," Ginny grinned but then stopped abruptly. "I think that’s Luna! I'll be right back!" And the redhead disappeared in the direction of the guesthouse.
Draco didn't hesitate, let go of Harry's hair and accepted the invitation without question. Harry scooted aside as far as he could, the beds were narrow and Draco's body radiated an alluring coolness. The blond turned to Harry, nudged Harry's nose with his own and let his hand slide back into Harry's hair. Slowly, Harry reached for Draco's waist, stroking gently over the cool fabric. Draco reacted immediately, pushing his body closer to Harry's and sighed comfortably.
it scares you because it scares me too, but I’m asking you to trust me. Give the possibility of saving each other a chance.” Harry’s voice sounded rough and his vocal cords hurt when he spoke, but the truth came easily to his lips.
"Wait," Harry uttered, interrupted the kiss and loosened the grip around his dick. Draco frowned, his cheeks were red and he bit his lip as soon as his gaze fell on Harry's pulsating erection. "I want to see you come."
Harry kissed back with relish, let Draco bite his lip and smiled slightly as Draco’s fingers intertwined with Harry’s. Harry used the other hand to continue teasing Draco’s naked stomach. Draco had to tense in this position, causing the muscles to cramp even more with each touch.
So he represses any thought of magical books and sympathy he may have developed for them. He struggles with the guilt this causes in him. It is against his nature to not want to help people, but he has to trust that it is something different in this case.
I cut him off, not at all interested in his flimsy excuses. "Then tell me who else was involved, if it wasn't your family."
Harry dimly remembers that Parkinson works as a reporter for this particular magazine and hastily shakes his head so as not to raise any false hopes. He has never given interviews. "No, I actually have a bit of an odd question."
Pup approaches him from the bathroom after Harry has called him three times. For a moment Harry toys with the idea of carrying him into the kitchen but decides to order Pup to his bowl with a strict face. He peeks into the bathroom through the open crack and knocks gently as soon as he spots Draco staring apathetically at his reflection.
"Merlin, please stop talking!" I intervened and hastily sat up straighter on the sofa. "I certainly don't want to have
Inside it, he seeks a definition of reality that does not trouble him. He fathoms answers to questions that he does not formulate because he is afraid that the questions offer nothing but an illusion for him. One disappointment is more than enough. Now he must strive to regain his footing.
Auror Filly immediately clears his throat. "That is, of course, a possible theory, but we can guarantee that no curses of any kind are allowed inside Azkaban, neither are wands or other magic."
“Why would you ask me for a rendezvous if the kiss was the fault of my charm?” Draco interrupted Harry’s thoughts once again and changed the subject brutally, his arms crossed again with a calculating expression on his face.
stimulating. So every passing second Harry became more and more comfortable with the idea that Draco in lingerie was a hellishly erotic fantasy and dreamily revelled in his sparked imagination. Until, at dinner on Friday of the same week, he realised that he had a mouth, a voice and a wonderful husband. In fact, he only noticed it because they were eating spareribs and the oil made Draco's lips glisten rosy and look truly delicious. Essentially, it didn't matter what made him open his mouth. The result remained a clumsy stumble over his tongue.
He’d have to go looking for him. Even though Draco had asked him not to do just that, Harry had no choice. Waiting until the morning would be a waste of precious time. Time he didn’t want to spend thinking, but doing! Following these thoughts, Harry reached for the Marauder’s Map.
The resistance wasn’t too strong, but Draco’s tension was palpable. Harry didn’t manage to hold back, had to interrupt the kiss, only heard a ringing in his ears and a sighing moan, which had to be himself. The feeling was overwhelming, the tightness almost drove Harry out of his mind and made him feel the need to come instantly. Holding himself back and because his whole body was trembling with excitement, Harry remained in a state of rigidity for a moment.
After the war, he had tried to prove himself, that much I had been able to register. On a large scale, as well as on a small one. He had applied for countless jobs, had by no means been selective in his choice and had endured just as many rejections with a composed face. I had witnessed job interviews where he was asked to leave the building as soon as they found out what mark he wore on his arm. Neither an alias nor his impeccable grades were any use.
I tucked a strand of hair behind my ear and thought about Malfoy's answer. "This is a diary. Isn't the function of a diary to read in it?"
Draco’s gaze was somewhat pained when he raised his head again and looked directly at Harry. “This is really not a decision that’s supposed to off–”
Jimar and Anja exchange a small look. Jimar never doubted that Mr Potter would agree, nor did Anja. Not really, at least. She turns for one last look at her problem patient and suppresses a sigh before following Mr Potter
He crossed the room with long strides, only coming to a halt at the entrance door to the Trophy Room. He gestured meaningfully with one hand out into the hallway.
Malfoy now actually rolled his eyes. "Pythonel alludes to a case in the seventies named after its leader. It involved a human trafficking ring – more specifically, children of wizarding families were kidnapped, murdered or sold. The Aurors at the time remained in the dark for years as far as the discovery of the human trafficking ring was concerned. A complex network had developed, with supposedly uninvolved pure-blood families contributing, which ensured Pythonel's cover – however, in seventy-eight the case was solved. What do you want me to tell you, Potter?"
Ron nodded and sat up a little while he thoughtfully let his gaze wander across the room. “Does that mean you don’t care?” he then asked calmly.
Slowly Harry turns and walks back, looks into Draco's eyes, in which he can read nothing but nervousness, and stops only in front of the bed. It takes all his effort not to interpret this small wish as a sign of trust and just regard it for what it is. The wish for connection, for something that relieves his fear. He probably would have asked anyone for it.
Harry nodded gently, holding Draco's fingers in his tight grip and tried to calm his heart. He trusted Draco. Of course he did.
Exhausted and out of mood, Harry only longed for a bubble bath, a warm meal and one of those massages that only Draco's divine Healer hands were able to give. When he heard cackling laughter from the bedroom, he sensed that real life was about to thwart his plans. Alongside Draco's laughter, which he had recognised among hundreds, there was also Pansy's.
"Good," Draco mumbled to Harry's lips, then he pushed Harry away impatiently, turned on his stomach and crawled to the edge of the bed to look for something in the bedside drawer. Meanwhile, Harry's gaze lay fascinated on Draco's arse, which could only look more delicious when covered by the net. Harry let his hand roam over the soft skin, almost heard Draco's smile. Then the blond turned around, placed himself backwards under Harry again, his hair tickled on Harry's arms and he held a condom out to him.
Harry raised an eyebrow, a strange feeling came over him to defend Draco from Ron and to rebuke his best friend, but he ignored the feeling. “As long as he doesn't realise that you’re –”
Harry looked away from the clear eyes that fixated on him and chuckled as he turned his back to the edge of the pool so that he now supported himself with his elbows behind him. “Maybe you're right and I’m falling for you after all.”
Ignoring the whispering, murmuring, and giggling, Harry turned briefly to Draco before their paths would part. There was a mischievous smile on Draco’s lips, which surprised Harry a little. But he didn’t complain, as long as Draco didn’t mind the looks and comments of the others, neither would Harry.
A smile appears on Harry's lips and he does not even have to open his eyes to know that they are bathed in light, that he has successfully cast the spell and that it is doing something, even if he can only guess at the moment what depth it will carry.
Harry whispers, and immediately the dark outline of an elongated and slim compartment appears, swinging open after Harry taps it once more with his wand. Inside, embedded on a phoenix feather, lies the Elder Wand. Exactly where Harry has lovingly preserved it, never intending to set eyes on it again.
But Harry didn’t even listen to Draco properly anymore, instead turning in the direction from where he could hear Draco’s voice and feeling blindly in the darkness until he got hold of silky hair, found Draco’s neck immediately and bent forward. The kiss was uncoordinated and somehow Harry didn’t really get it right either, due to his lack of vision, but none of that mattered.
"It's been in the family for generations, it's not as if we paid for it," Draco tried his hand at humility when he noticed Harry's bewildered look. They had just stopped in front of the manor with the arched windows and got off the, suddenly very tiny, scooter.
." Draco's voice trembled, but it was more than enough to finish Harry off. One last time Harry thrust his hips into Draco’s fist. He felt Draco's fingers move along his shaft with practised precision and when he finally pressed his lips against Draco's, his knees weakened and stars danced before his eyes. Harry's orgasm overwhelmed him with unplanned force, only the fact that he clung to the wall with one hand saved him from falling.
So why would Harry flout his loyalty? Remember when the two of them met for the first time? The upheaval of the future? Let me tell you that Harry won’t lose his sense of loyalty, not in the future. There's only one time he'll break it, and that's right now. Because without a break, nothing can heal.
"Put your foot in the stirrup, gather momentum and swing the other leg over the back. Preferably a bit more elegant than Weasley," Draco added. Harry grinned at the sight of his best friend, who had less than good heaved his weight onto the back of his pony – Baldur – somehow, and was now struggling to balance himself.
Draco was the one who took the decision away from Harry by suddenly breaking away from him, taking a small step back, pulling down Harry’s boxers and closing his fingers around Harry’s cock. At first, Harry wanted to protest, to pull Draco back to himself, but as the movement quickened, the train of thought was drowned out in a moan and he let his head fall back.
attention, but the extent of it was frightening indeed. Slowly, but surely, he began to understand why Draco hid his past so carefully.
As the bond of their magic grows, so does the aggravated tingle on Harry's right side. It extends from his hip, all the way to his back.
. In shock, he looked at the ice first, then at the blond and then at the ice again. “Wandless magic?!”
Harry was actually hoping that his empty stomach would help the alcohol take effect more quickly, but is then tempted to try one of the chocolate tarts with vanilla cream filling. In the meantime, Ginny tells him about the countless press conferences she has to endure on behalf of her Quidditch team and how she instantly singles out the reporters, who have never so much as glanced at a sports article in their lives, and how she enjoys her pranks on them. She does not mention Malfoy again.
Harry immediately felt the heat on his cheeks and mumbled an incomprehensible affirmation. No way, Draco had no clue. Either he was a born natural or he had knowledge that went beyond locker room jokes and porn. Harry felt completely inferior, which resulted in him feeling totally ashamed.
Draco sighed, resting his head on one hand and looking somewhere past Harry. “This means that I’m bound to love the person who takes my virginity and that this love will be forever and unconditional. That, or I’m
"I don't know what you want from me. I've already agreed, you don't need to convince me of anything."
Draco pushed Harry a few steps back until Harry could feel tree bark on his back and a stabbing pain burst in his shoulder. Harry hissed, but before Draco could even inquire, he turned the tables. Now it was the blond who was pressed against the broad tree trunk, Harry let one hand wander down Draco's back, the other was buried in blond hair at the back of Draco's head.
"You can't lose what you've never had," Draco murmured softly. This time I felt his smile. "You're as free as I am, Harry. Letting go is a significant part of love."
again? Oh right, because he wasn’t just any old twat. He was Harry’s twat. With a sigh, Harry pressed his nose to Draco’s cheek and intertwined their fingers. One day he might learn to understand these feelings, but for the moment he was quite comfortable with their very existence.
to believe Nick, it would mean that Mr Malfoy will not tell anyone about the curse. Even if he knows about it. Simply because he does not want a cure for it to be found.
By this time, the two of them were standing in the Entrance Hall of Hogwarts, where not a soul was roaming around at that time of the morning. But soon the early risers would show up and neither of the two young men wanted to be caught here. Harry longed for something to eat and perhaps a shower to get rid of the remnants of the sweat caused by fear. But most of all he longed for a bed and a long sleep. Not exactly the perfect conditions for the planned fling.
"Draco, I haven't been completely honest with you," I finally voiced what was weighing heavily on my chest. "You –"
Draco pressed his lips shut, his cheeks covered with red patches, as always when something upset him. Harry returned the gaze unyieldingly, even if it took all the effort he could muster. It worked. Draco kept his lips carefully sealed for the rest of the evening.
Harry's cheeks grew hot. Without wasting a thought to further consequences, Harry continued his kisses southwards, grabbed the thigh firmer, felt the muscle under his fingers tense and relax again and spread Draco's legs a little more.
"The temperatures should hold for a while and I haven't made any plans for my lunch break yet," Harry shares slowly.
Harry just couldn't take his eyes off Draco, even though he could only see him up to his shoulders. It was absolutely surreal and either he was having the barmiest nightmare of his life or he had found out Draco's secret. So far he could only guess what exactly this secret contained. Harry’s gaze fell on Draco's hand that was holding on to the rock and he almost jumped up and ran away. It wasn't a human hand, somehow it was, but not really. The hand was webbed and reminded him a bit of the creature's hand, which definitely didn't make him feel any better.
The lesson passed surprisingly quickly, Draco seemed more than relieved when Lockhart announced the end and then left the riding hall with Mr Malfoy. Harry now knew what the others had meant by "unjustified good reputation". Lockhart had distracted Draco and Feykir with his way of teaching in such a manner that Harry was sure that the lesson had done more harm than good. Draco had once even looked almost as if he was about to yell at Lockhart, Harry was sure that Mr Malfoy's presence alone had stopped him.
Still, everything about this was perfect. Draco in his arms, Hedwig lying next to Harry who let him tickle her between her ears (now that Harry was paying attention to it, he actually noticed that Draco reacted a bit distant to the dog, maybe there was more to Lupin's story than expected) and the exuberant conversations of his friends made the day flawless.
Draco nestled his head back against Harry's crook of the neck, a quiet smile on his lips. Harry's heart was beating faster. He had to tell him about the bet with Ron. Of course, he had to.
