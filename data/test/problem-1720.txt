Harry paused.  He didn't really want to bring this up while Draco was crying, but Draco still had his questioning grey eyes on him.  "Well, actually there's something I've been wanting to ask you." Greg and Vince got up unobtrusively and went back to bed, closing the curtains around themselves.
"So none of them have been proved guilty, doesn't that make them innocent?" He cast another sidelong smirk at the jury.
“I have missed you, brother.”  Louis said.
Harry wasn't sure.  "Something expensive."
“In the meantime we will ensure no harm comes to our little cousin.”  Skarpheðinn added, clapping Malfoy on the shoulder hard enough to make him stagger.  “I’m sure we can count on your assistance, Lord Potter.”  Harry nodded but didn’t get a chance to reply before Malfoy interrupted.
When Harry had finished reading it, he set Draco's essay down.  "That was good, Draco.  Come up here." He patted the bed next him and Draco moved to sit there.  Harry enfolded him in his arms.  "You're forgiven now, love, but if it happens again your punishment will be  much more severe."
Harry slid his hands down to clutch Draco's bum.  "My point, pet, is that now I can do whatever I want to you and there's no danger of being interrupted.  No one will be there to spare you from me now."
“Quiddich lockers?”  From Goyle
“The King won’t have any power here if the Dark Lord kills us all.”  Draco snapped.
Pansy Parkinson raised her hand.  “Draco was faster, sir.”  Beside her Zabini elbowed her.  She punched him in the thigh.  Zabini winced and Malfoy snorted.  He looked more relaxed and envigorated than Harry had seen him all year.
"Auror Calcare," the woman started half-heartedly, "in your opinion, was Mr Malfoy a danger to the public."
Snape fixed him with a glare.  “You’re not here to drink fine wine and make friends, Potter.  This is the sole purpose of your visit.”  And Harry could only find himself relieved to hear himself called by his name again.
Malfoy had finished his Rosary, but it didn’t seem to have much calmed him.  “He’s putting runes in place that will support the castle if the wards collapse.  They need to go on all the ground floor supporting walls.”
Harry approached Draco.  "Are you okay?"
“Well, I’m certainly not giving you whiskey on an empty stomach.”  Snape retrieved only one tumbler from the cupboard of the sideboard.
They were in Snape’s office for the fifth Monday evening in a row.  As before, they were sitting in front of the fire with a pot of tea between them.  Malfoy had called for a house elf and asked for some biscuits.  “I hope you don’t mind,” he had said, “I missed dinner.  I had correspondence to attend to.”  Malfoy had been unexpectedly cordial to Harry in their meetings.  He was still sharp at times, usually when Harry asked questions he deemed to be stupid, but he was usually polite, if a little detached.  He still looked awful, though.  Everyday the bags under his eyes seemed to be deeper and his face was more drawn.  Whatever the cause of his exhaustion was, a month and a half at Hogwarts had not alleviated it.
“You two can take your seats.”  Snape instructed.  “Now,” Snape addressed the room, “what did you notice about that duel?  Why do you think Mr Malfoy won?”  There was silence, the class was slightly stunned by the display they had witnessed.  Snape sighed.  “Anyone?”
"Not nervous, are you love?"
It must have been about three in the morning when he heard the noise.  A soft whimpering issued from across the room.  Harry sat up, wondering if someone was having a nightmare.  He pulled open his curtains.  Dove was in the middle of his bed again, hair spread around him.  This time, though, he was tossing his head around and small whimpers escaped his lips.
So far there were no Potter children in Hufflepuff.  Morgana and Lilith were in Slytherin, Circe was in Ravenclaw and Nox was in Griffyndor.  Harry suspected Salem would be another Ravenclaw and Mercury would be put in Griffyndor, but he honestly wouldn't mind if either of them sorted Hufflepuff.
Draco looked affronted.  "Am not a bitch."
“Don’t call him that. And who says I haven’t come up with something myself?”
Draco was running up the path behind them.  He held his robes in his hands to keep them away from his feet, making him look almost like a child as he ran.  Behind him his two wolfhounds trotted calmly through the Orangery.
“Calm down.”  Snape told him firmly.
“Because that will look like you couldn’t be bothered and just grabbed the Slytherin closest to you.” Not that the Slytherin closest to him would mind.
Harry sighed, the preconceived ideas about Magical Submissives were really damaging Draco.  He tightened his hold around the blond's waist and looked down at him.  "Draco, if I choose you, it will be you and only you for the rest of my life, I swear."
The calm was broken by the door opening.  Ron and Hermione came in, both looking tired and worried.  Harry got back to his feet and Hermione hugged him tightly.
“Our friend told us that, as well as resembling our brother, the boy is missing a ring finger.”  This King looked around the room as though ensuring he had full attention, and Harry knew he was working his way up to a finale.  “He also brought this, he claims he took it from Draco.”
“Good morning, Mr Potter. Here are the minutes from Tuesday’s muggle-born integration seminar.”
Snape seemed to read Harry’s thoughts.  “He’s not perfect, Potter, but he’s all we’ve got.”
Things became chilly between Harry and his erstwhile best friend over the following weeks.  Ron wouldn't give up on his 'Slytherins are evil' campaign, but the Slytherins proved him wrong at every turn.  They were polite, considerate and really no trouble at all.  Draco was incredible.  Most of the time he was unrecognisable as the boy Harry had known for six years, then he would say something that reminded Harry vividly of the Malfoy he had known, except he was funny rather than offensive.  One such event occurred about a month into the term.
It worked, though.  Malfoy showed no emotion, but after a moment of thought he nodded shortly.  “Fine.  Meet me at seven in Professor Snape’s office.”
“Marie, Claudine, would you accompany us?”  Two of the ladies got to their feet.  “Gabrielle, perhaps you would keep an eye on Belle and the girls?”
"Right, ruined," Ron turned his snarl on Dove.  "I bet you loved every second of it.  You're all muggle-hating scum."
The Duc smiled at Harry and shook his hand.  “It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
“Yes, sir, you will. You’re very drunk and you’re not thinking clearly, or you wouldn’t be doing this.” This was taking all of Draco’s self-control, but he couldn’t go into work on Monday and face Mr Potter’s awkward regret.
“You’ll do, I suppose.”  He allowed.

Malfoy looked amused.  “Are you nervous, Potter?”

The 'ð' Skarpheðinn is an eth, pronounced in Norse as a voiced 'th' as in 'then' or 'that' (as opposed to the unvoiced 'th' as in 'thin' or 'thistle' represented by a thorn, 'Þ').
"And how do you plan to do that?"
"I do," Greg said.
“Who survived the war?”  Draco nodded.  “All of your family, Draco, everyone’s alright.”  More or less.  Draco’s cousin Ragnar had been so badly injured in the battle to retake the ministry no one had thought he would survive, but he had, a little worse for wear.  Alexandre de Montespan had declared himself deeply traumatised by his war experience and retired to his family’s home in Anjou.  For all his talk, Harry thought there was some truth to the man’s self-declared frailty.  There had been other injuries here and there, and no one had emerged from the war as they had entered, but everyone was more or less safe and sound.
“Concentrating.”  Zabini replied pointedly, not taking his eyes from the wall.
“No.” Harry replied decisively. He seemed to have woken up a bit. “You’ve been so helpful, Draco, think you deserve a reward.”
"Yes, why do you ask?"
"Draco," Harry called quietly.  Draco turned so quickly that his hair flicked out in a wide arc, the cigarette falling from his hand.  "Come with me." Draco scrambled to his feet.
Harry had indeed seen many dogs, and interacted with plenty of them.  He gave Ajax an obliging scratch and the dog extended his neck to give Harry more room.
It was Vince who answered him.  "Draco's with Pansy getting ready, and Theo and Blaise are purifying the space we're going use.  Once that's all done we'll go and cast the circle and start the ritual.  So in about ten minutes."
“Some,” Malfoy acknowledged lightly.  “People believe that I’m an easy way to the King.  They write to me asking that I petition the King for this and that, and so I must pass their request on or write them back telling them my refusal.  It’s usually a refusal.  I have no position in court, I’m not a politician.  But if it’s some little thing, like that their daughter be permitted a position in the Queen’s household, or their son join His Majesty on a hunt, then I consider it.  Only if their family has valuable connections or the children promising qualities.”  He shot Harry a smirk.  “Only if the daughter is ugly, or the Queen would never forgive me.”
As the car came to a halt, Malfoy slid himself out and went round to the boot.  Popping it open he pulled out two holdalls.  He passed the first to Crabbe, who had followed him round, then grabbed the second himself.  His cigarette was finished so he threw it on the ground and ground it out with his foot.  His canvas shoes were scuffed and he was wearing a pair of shorts which only reached his mid-thigh, the hair on his legs must have been too pale to be seen.  He had on a strap top which was low cut enough to reveal his sculpted pecks but almost reached the bottom of his shorts, the braid of his hair also reached to that length.  The shorts were black and the top was pale grey with black writing that said:
Draco stepped into Mr Potter’s living room and opened the curtains. It was a bright, summers day, as befitted the occasion, and Draco wouldn’t have put it past Shacklebolt to have performed a little weather magic to ensure that everything was perfect for darling daughter’s special day. He repeated this process in Mr Potter’s bedroom, the light revealing Mr Potter, still wrapped in his duvet, groaning at he brightness. Draco respectfully turned away as Mr Potter collected himself, and picked out some dress robes from Mr Potter’s wardrobe.
“Can’t we get the younger kids out through the secret passages?”  Harry asked.  It had been his first thought.
“Have you thought more about what you will say to the King?”
Harry balked.  "What?" How did Greg know something that Harry was only just starting to admit?
“Won’t regret anything. Do the spell.” He demanded.
The two men glared at one another, Malfoy pale, broad and chiselled, Snape dark, tall and wiry.  It was Malfoy who looked away first.
“Expulso!” Zabini shouted almost before his wand was up, and a pulse of blue shot towards Malfoy.
All the Sytherins were pleasant to those around them, there weren't any snide comments or nasty pranks.  The younger years still played up, but eighth year were on best behaviour.  Draco was quiet, but polite to those around him.  He was still sarcastic and occasionally superior, but it was with none of his former malice. Sometimes it was quite funny actually.
"None, none was needed, the evidence was conclusive."
Slughorn seemed unaffected by Zabini’s tone.  “And this is Cormac McLaggen,” he gestured to the larger of the two seventh years, “and Marcus Belby.”
Several eyes turned to them in shock, but Harry showed no surprise.  "Thank you."
"Harry, love.  Tonight it's Harry."
Malfoy took one.  “Thank you.  Vincent wants to know if you’ll walk me back to the common room this evening.”
"What's the plan?" Cissa was the first to speak.
“Does he understand English?”  Harry asked, glancing anxiously at the dogs.
"Sustained. Please return to the matter at hand or finish with the witness, you've made your point."
"I'll let you and your friends miss my class on Thursday afternoon to perform the ceremony, if that won't be too soon."
Harry got out the larger box and opened.  Draco looked at the two pieces with wides eyes.  Wordlessly Harry clipped the bracelet around Draco's wrist and watched as it shrink to fit.  He motioned for Draco to turn and pulled his loose hair into a ponytail, clipping it onto place with the clasp.
“Yeah,” Harry muttered absently, “you’re desperate for it.”
"Yes, he was extremely dangerous." Calcare seemed to perk up.
Harry stood in the corridor facing Crabbe and Goyle.  He and Hermione had cornered them on their way to dinner as they lagged behind the other Slytherins.
"Yeah, and so do Draco and Pansy, but I'm not really sure about it, and Blaise and Theo don't believe at all."
Harry walked into the dormitory a while later to see Draco curled on his bed with a potions book.  Harry recognised the chapter as the one Professor Snape had told them to read.  Snape was still acting strangely and no reason had yet been found. There were rumours beginning to circulate that went from unlikely to ridiculous.  Some said that he had lost a lover in the war and hadn't got over it, which seemed far too romantic for Snape.  Others that he was suffering from a dreadful disease with no cure, unlikely for a vampire.  The other popular one was that it wasn't Snape at all but an imposter and the real Snape had died in the final battle, but that was impossible as a polyjuice potion needed the subject to be alive.  Whatever the truth was, the eighth year Slytherins seemed to know.  They were always exchanging meaningful looks in his lessons and Draco looked perpetually worried in his presence.
“You’re not a bad player, Dorchester.”  Enghien observed.
Harry grinned to himself.  After all, it wasn't everyday you made your lover come so hard they passed out.  "How do you feel?"
Harry had spent some time trying to educate himself about history while enjoying his country seclusion, but he still only had a passing understanding of who Eleanor of Aquitaine had been, so he just matched Draco’s smile.  “Lots of people want you back, Draco.”
Draco nodded and there was silence for a bit.  Harry watched Draco's eyes scanning the page, his brow furrowed cutely in concentration and his full, pale pink lips mouthing an ingredient to himself every so often.  As he watched something clicked.  Draco had said Snape was mourning, that was familiar.  Someone else had used that word recently.  Hadn't Blaise said it?  Harry couldn't for the life of him remember the context though.  One thing was sure: the 'lost a lover in the war' theory was looking the most promising at the moment.
"Thank you, sir." Draco blushed.
Harry, unsure of what she meant but curious, chose his words carefully.  “I’m not sure that’s something I should be discussing.”
As class ended, Harry pulled Draco into an empty classroom.  It was break so they wouldn't be missed.  Draco's eyes were lowered and he hadn't spoken a word since breakfast.
Harry took hold of the other end of the portkey and a moment later felt the familiar twisting, jerking sensation of being dragged away.  He landed solidly on his back on a paved surface, his trunk skittering from his grip.  He lay for a few moments recovering the breath that had been knocked out of him.  Then Malfoy appeared above him and offered him a hand up.
“And after the ballet,” Engheim continued, “the Feast.  Now that I am looking forward to.”
“Excellent,” Lady Florence said, and took Harry’s arm.  “The Queen doesn’t hold with all of this stuffy standing on ceremony.  She wants to meet you properly.”
Draco led them back up the path to the palace.  They entered through a small door in the central building, and then made their way up a sweeping staircase.  The King was waiting for them in the Hall of Mirrors.
Hermione nodded in understanding. "Yes, well," she smiled gently, "I suppose we're all just going to have to get over ourselves."
Snape snorted.  “Yes, you’re well known for your piety.  Go now.”  He instructed.  Monstespan went, and Snape called after him, “Perhaps to the chapel.”
“I’ll try,” Harry replied tensely.
"Um, Harry," Hermione's voice came from somewhere to his left, behind a large book, "did you just growl?"
He stood.  The friar was saying something but Harry wasn’t listening.  He was only concerned with looking at Draco, assessing him for damage, trying to determine whether he was pleased or distressed by Harry’s intrusion into this quiet world.  Draco was taller, of course, both he and Harry had grown since they were sixteen.  Draco hadn’t filled out like Harry had though, he was lean, and he still looked fragile.  The brittleness that had existed in him in their sixth year was still there, but at least he didn’t look as exhausted as he did in Harry’s memories.  His skin had a bit more colour and his eyes were a bit brighter.  Harry couldn’t see any evidence of torture, Draco had walked up the aisle easily enough, and his face was unmarred, but of course there was the rest of him to consider.  And Harry could certainly consider it.
Harry couldn’t really bring himself to believe it though.  What were the chances of Draco having survived his time with the Death Eaters, his disfigurement at their hands, and somehow made his way to Prague?  It seemed impossible.
"Breakfast.  You said we had to get through it."
“Good.”  Hermione said firmly, and Harry frowned at her.  He’d have liked someone on his side.
It was then that he heard a delighted squeal from behind him. “Oh look, that’s Harry Potter and Daphne Greengrass, isn’t it? I knew it, I just knew it!”
“Or any war.”  Malfoy muttered.
Draco leaned in conspiratorially, “it’s my favourite.”  He smiled at Harry and Harry decided he liked this side of Draco, more relaxed than he had seen him recently, surrounded by friends and dogs.
Malfoy looked at him as though he was the most stupid person he’d ever met.  “No, Potter.  Don’t you think I would have mentioned it before now?  We have translation spells all over the palace for visitors.  Lord, you're such a muggle.”
On Thursday morning, Harry woke up happier than he'd ever been in his life.  He was going to bond with Draco and it was going to be perfect.  In the bed next to his, Draco was sitting up, rubbing his eyes.
"Why does that have anything to do with getting into fights?"
Luckily Malfoy had shown Harry a handful of card games in their lessons, and Harry had practiced Whist with him, Flosi and Skarpheðinn.  “Of course.”  He replied.
"So Mr Malfoy was imprisoned and sentenced to the Dementor's Kiss with no legal precedent?"
Draco watched Mr Potter sway to a sitting position the sofa. He and Draco had attended the departmental celebration of Daphne and Greg’s elopement at the Leaky, and Mr Potter had been so well on his way to being completely wankered that Draco couldn’t in good conscience allow him to apparate home himself. It was hardly the first time Draco had seen his employer in such a state, and he knew Mr Potter to be a good-natured drunk, so it wasn’t too arduous a task, more amusing than anything else.
“Won’t you accompany me on a walk along the gallery, Lord Dorchester?”  Queen Élizabeth asked Harry.
"I'm sorry?"
Malfoy offered a thin smile in response, but it didn’t reach his eyes.  “I’m quite alright, thank you, Professor.”
"You can go first."
Draco gasped, then he reached out and touched the metal.  "Its beautiful.  Am I really allowed to wear it?"
Kingsley nodded and sat himself in his chair behind his desk.  Severus and Harry took seats opposite him, while Draco slid to the floor next to Harry.
“That’s right.  He’s not in line for the throne, though.  He doesn’t have any royal blood.”
“So you just keep him around ‘cause you fancy him.”
Harry nodded.  "So talk me through the ritual again."
Draco obediently went to the fire place, threw in the floo powder and stated his destination.  Harry followed him and was soon standing in the foyer of his manor.  Draco was looking around in wonder, and with good reason.  The foyer was five stories tall, the same height as the rest of the house, and had a crystal dome instead of the ceiling.  The crystal refracted the light and made rainbows dance across the cream-coloured walls.
Dinner was strange for Harry.  He was seated next to Malfoy at the end of the table, with the King on Malfoy’s other side, then the Queen, then one of the Queen’s companions, then Lucius Malfoy.  Around them various members of the court were arrayed, including Malfoy’s friends and some of the Ladies in Waiting and Maids of Honour Harry had met earlier.  The food was excellent, rich and varied, but Harry felt himself too much under scrutiny to really enjoy it.  Malfoy was tense beside him, but managed to continue a lively conversation with his brother about some new paintings that Louis had commissioned, and did his best to involve Harry in them as well.
"Right.  Was he like that before he turned 17?"
"Harry, did you punch Ron?" Neville had entered the dormitory.
“Idiot.  But anyway, Dorchester, you must play cards with us again whenever you please.  Draco spends half his time at confession, it’s so very dull.”
There was dancing too: Greg and Vince, of course, the happy couple; Pansy and Theo, together again for now; Neville and Luna, awkward perfection; Hermione and Blaise, a budding romance.  When Draco looked across at him, as he did every few minutes, Harry motioned for him to come over.  Draco excused himself politely from the conversation, his father glancing briefly at Harry before relinquishing hold of his son.  Lucius had accepted Harry as his son-in-law very easily, he had already known of Draco feelings for Harry and was pleased to see that Draco had been claimed by someone he loved.  While he was reluctant to let his son out of his sight, he seemed to trust Harry well enough.
“That is yours, isn’t it Severus?”  Malfoy asked smugly.
“He gave you those…” Harry nodded at the beads.
Looking at Malfoy holding the Cavalier, Harry had to observe that there were no similarities between Belle’s broad head with its smiling mouth and Malfoy’s narrow, serious face.  Whatever the reason for the nickname Malfoy had been given, it was not, as Florence had suggested, a physical likeness.  Perhaps, as Charlotte had said, it was due to Malfoy’s behaviour, or perhaps it was just cruelty.  Harry suspected the latter as he considered Belle’s shining dark eyes and perpetually wagging tail.
“And why exactly is this the case?” Ron looked amused rather than inquisitive, as if he already knew the answer.
“But why do I have to take anyone at all?”
“Of course,” Harry replied to her second question, then considered her first.  “We don’t really know each other that well, we’re in different houses at school and we argued a lot when we were younger.”  Less than a year ago, really, but he was reluctant to tell her that.  “But we’re getting along better now, he’s been helping me a lot.”  Harry realised this was true.  Although their arrangement had started as simply a mutually beneficial one, Harry had begun to enjoy their meetings, even Malfoy’s biting sarcasm no longer bothered him.
“I must speak to my superior.”  The Friar turned as quickly as he could, robes flapping with him, and hurried between the pews.  Harry fought the urge to restrain him, or follow him, and instead sank back down onto the bench.  He hoped he hadn’t been too heavy handed, and that the Franciscans, who ran the wizarding portion of the church, would bring Draco to him rather than resisting or spiriting him away.
"I bought something for you."
"Why?  Don't Blaise, Pansy and Theo do that when you're not here."
When Harry made his way back to his room, Draco was proof reading his essay.  He handed it to his Master once he was finished.  Harry took it from him and sat on his bed to read it.  Draco came and knelt at his feet.
"Yes, ma'am." The Malfoy family lawyer answered smoothly. "Defence calls their first witness, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Minister of Magic."
There were footsteps behind him.  The friar had returned, and behind him was a slim figure in a simple grey robe.  The shock of pale hair confirmed who it was before Harry had even turned to get a proper look.
"Can you imagine what would have happened if Voldemort had known about Malfoy?" Harry shuddered
Snape regarded him with a sneer.  “No, Potter, don’t be ridiculous.  There are first and second years out there, there will be no fighting.  If the wards break, then the castle has a line of physical defence.  And I believe that the Aurors have been alerted.  They will also attempt to defend the castle.  If these fail, and the Death Eaters gain entry to the castle, then the staff will seek to come to an agreement that will secure the safety of all of the students.  As you might imagine, this will be made significantly more difficult to achieve if two of the people that the Dark Lord most wants to kill are among the student body.  You're not here for your own safety, Mr Potter, you’re here for everyone else’s.”
“Voldemort doesn’t know what peace is.”  Harry replied.  “He’s being trying to kill me my whole life.  He tried to kill me when I was a year old, just because he thought I might grow up to be a threat.  He’s been trying to kill me ever since, even when I was just a child who couldn’t have hurt him.  And he’s insane now; even if he started out last time with a purpose and a political rhetoric, now he’s turned into a monster with no concern for whom he hurts.  He took such risks this summer just to try to kill me that he revealed himself to the Ministry,” Harry didn’t want to bring up the prophecy, “and even his most loyal followers have started to abandon him.  If he’s left you alone it’s because his attention has been elsewhere.  The moment he decides you pose a threat he’ll seek to destroy you, yes, so perhaps you might be reluctant to get involved.  But he’s unstable, so he could decide at any time that you’re a danger to him, or that for some reason you’re not worthy of living in the world he wants to create, and he’ll try to destroy you all anyway.  I’d say your best option is to get ahead of it, to make your stand while his attention’s still on securing the UK, so that you can work with those of us who are still resisting him there.”
“Shut up,” Ron hissed.
"Oh, stop snivelling, Malfoy.  Your precious daddy deserves everything he gets."
Kingsley still looked mutinous, but that slowly slid into resigned acceptance.  "Okay," he agreed hesitantly.
Harry supposed wasn't that big a deal, but Slytherins were supposed to be suspicious and back-stabbing.  They, of all people, should be on their guard.  But now they were sleeping peacefully, completely exposed.  Greg and Vince were lying close together, Vince turned inwards and Greg had his arm across his partner's shoulders.  Blaise was sprawled across the entire bed.  Theo was turned away from him, shuffling restlessly.  And Draco was curled in a ball halfway down his bed, his long hair spread around him all across the bed.  His face was peaceful and his beauty was breath taking.
"Cool, I'll start," Zabini responded. "I'm Blaise."
Harry put his hand to Dove's cheek and turned his face towards Harry.  Harry bent down and their lips brushed.  Draco's lips were soft and full, Harry pressed against them more firmly.  He put the other hand possessively in the small of Draco's back, tugging him in closer.  Harry's tongue sought entrance and Draco gladly gave it.  Harry slid his tongue into Draco's mouth and Draco's cautiously met it.  Their kiss became more heated, Harry pulling Draco into his lap.  After a few minutes Harry had to break the kiss.  He couldn't cross the line, yet.
“And what would you know about that?”  Lady Florence demanded of her friend.  “You’re hardly a frequent guest in the King’s chambers, Charlotte.”
"Of course."
Malfoy smirked.  “This door leads directly to the palace, it keeps us from having to fight through the muggles outside.  We’re looking directly into the North Wing of the palace.  This is the Gallery of Illustrious Men.  Welcome to Versailles, Potter.”
“They appear to have been let into the palace by an unknown helper, Sire.”  A guard, more elaborately attired than the rest, informed them.
Harry was guided to the centre of the circle, then the others took their places.  Greg stood in the north, Vince in the south, Theo in the west and Blaise in the east.  Pansy stood on the opposite side of the alter from the couple.  Hermione, Neville, Ginny and an assortment of Harry's friends stood at the sides of the room where they could watch without getting in the way.
“They’ve had a boy,” she said, “and look, he’s so cute.”
The other man chuckled. “This time, we’re agreement.”
Harry nodded, accepting the wisdom of Greg's words.  "So what happens now?"
"Oh, it's not that different to being like anyone else.  Just sometimes I don't know what to do with myself.  Like if I've finished all my homework and no one's there to give me something to do I get a bit lost.  I just stand there thinking how best to serve my master, then I remember I don't have a master so I think about how best to help my friends, but I usually can't think of much there either.  It's not like they need me to cook or anything, and they won't let me tidy up for them.  Then Greg or Vince will snap me out of it and I'll feel a bit stupid for just standing there, but they never get angry they just give me something to do.  If they weren't around I'd probably just stand around looking lost way more of the time."
“Cheers,” Harry muttered, not appreciating Malfoy’s banter.
Draco nodded, his right hand drifting up to touch his familiar crucifix, and Harry knew he was thanking God.  From the gesture Harry could see his maimed hand, missing its fourth finger right down to the knuckle, the gap jarring.  He could remember vividly the sick feeling he’d had seeing Draco’s finger appear in front of him, proving that Draco had been taken by people who were prepared to hurt him.  Harry viewed that as the single moment that had signalled the start of a war that had ripped apart his whole life.
Harry seemed to be on the same page as him, because he leant down and whispered into his ear.  "Soon, baby." It didn't do anything for Draco's predicament.
Harry liked them already.
Harry focused in on his book.  It was about magical creatures that looked human, and there was a chapter about Magical Submissives.  It basically said that they were useless burdens on the wizards who claimed them.  But there was some useful information.  Before Submissives were claimed they has to be wooed, the person wooing them assumed temporary mastery of the Submissives until they decided if they wanted to keep them.  Like a pet.  Harry shook his head.  The role of the Master was to control the Submissive completely.  Tell them when to eat, drink and sleep, they had to obey their Master's every command.  Harry blushed, the Submissive couldn't even orgasm without permission.
Nott grinned.  "Just names should be fine."
“I have a letter for you.”  For the second time that day, Harry found a piece of parchment being held out to him.
“Why does he even want me there?  So your father can finish what Voldemort started.”
"Yes, sir."
“Don’t forget about Bors.”
"He's already ready."
When Draco approached him, Harry held out his hand.  "Would you do me the honour giving me the next dance?"
“Yeah.”
Draco did as he was told.  Harry pulled off the covers, pleased to see his submissive already hard.  He seated himself between Draco's legs and heard his gasp before he took his cock into his mouth.  Draco whimpered and bucked until Harry forced him to stay still.  Harry focused on sucking, taking Draco as deep as possible and applying as much suction as he could.  Then he wet his fingers, sliding one into Draco.  Draco moaned and begged for more.  Harry worked until he had three fingers inside Draco, with Draco's cock still firmly in his mouth.  Draco was gasping and whimpering, then all but screamed when Harry pushed against his prostate.
“To the palace?”
“Because Draco doesn’t do filing, or copy up drafts, or take dictation.”
Harry didn’t respond because as the doors opened they revealed not the courtyard, as Harry had expected, but a hallway extending away, white and brightly lit by chandeliers hanging from the arched ceiling.
Harry continued thrusting, his rhythm becoming less and less fluid.  Half of Draco's whimpers had become Harry's name, and the other half were most likely Master.  Harry felt his orgasm approaching quickly, he only just managed to allow Draco release before he was coming and unable to form coherent thought.  Warmth rushed through him, his muscles cramping as he emptied himself into Draco.
Harry couldn't wait much longer.  He pulled his fingers out hurriedly and slicked his cock.  He aligned himself with practiced ease and slid into Draco just an inch.  He had to choke back a growl.  Draco was so fucking tight.  Harry had never been with a virgin before, mostly the other guys he had been with were older and experienced.  Draco was beautiful in his innocence.  He gasped and whimpered a little as Harry slid in deeper.
Nott grinned.  “Oh no, Potter.  Malfoy’s told us all, you’re off limits.  No serious disfigurement, in class or outside it.”
Remus rubbed his face.  "I have no idea.  We're fucked."
“Alright,” Harry agreed mechanically, “call me Harry.”
Professor Slughorn
Harry piled pillows up to support Draco's hips.  He turned Draco over and lay him so his bum was in the air.  Then he conjured a length of silk and used it to bind Draco's hands to the headboard.
She looked over at the Slytherins, studied Malfoy for a moment, then nodded.
“Are the Death Eaters inside?”  Malfoy interrupted.
“What’s he like?”  Neville sounded a little nervous.
“So,” Lady Florence said, and she turned her sharp gaze on Harry, “you’re friends with the Little Cavalier.”
"Minister, when did you become aware of Mr Malfoy's renewed appeal?"
"Auror Calcare, you oversaw Mr Malfoy's arrest after the final battle."
Harry sank into the nearest seat the table.  Behind him Lisette covered her mouth with her hand.
“What’s going on?”  Harry asked Snape, although he already had some idea.
“Your Majesty,” Lady Florence said querulously as they all dipped, “we were coming to meet you in your rooms.”
“No.”  Malfoy paused.  “I need to ask you something.”
"Less so, but he was still quite..." Greg searched for the word, "delicate.  Not like you saw him at all."
Malfoy jumped off the desk and advanced on Zabini.  He did something complicated with his wand that Harry didn’t follow and Zabini’s head became free of the immobilising spell.  Zabini glared at Malfoy, but Malfoy just smirked and raised an eyebrow, his wand still trained on his opponent.
“Severus,” the young monarch said, “we have missed you.”  Then he embraced his godfather.
Zabini snorted.  “I wouldn’t let him hear you say it, he’s only twenty-four, you see.”
“Yes, well, we have class to get to.  I just wanted to introduce you, Potter, but we should be getting on.  I’ll see you at dinner.”  He told his cousins.  “They’re the sons of my father’s sister,” he explained as he led Harry away from the antechamber, “they’re completely insane.”
“Oh, god, Harry please. Don’t stop.”
"So?  You'd only be gone for a morning."
Flosi grinned.  “My brothers and I have long wished to join your war against the man who calls himself the Dark Lord.”
Greg snorted in disbelief.  "Right, we hate muggles.  That's why I drive a muggle car which Dove's dad gave me for my birthday."
Christmas Holidays
Vince smiled at him, recognising his discomfort.  "We were wondering if you would do us a favour this weekend."
He did so.  “Your Majesty, I’m happy to back.”
Harry rolled off of Draco as his eyes began to blink open.  "Okay, baby?"
Harry snorted at the man’s coy attitude and skimmed the article in front of him in disgust. It was the usual unsubstantiated drivel about his fictional romance with Daphne, but unfortunately this time it was accompanied by a picture that did look distressingly like him proposing. The light from the camera’s flash glinted off the diamond in such a way as to disguise the fact that it wasn’t actually a ring.
Harry had followed Snape and Louis to a room that he assumed was the council room, a long room on the ground floor that overlooked the dark grounds.  Lucius Malfoy had joined them, along with a few other men Harry knew to be Louis’ ministers.  The King stood at the head of the table, his back to the window, and planted his hands on the table in fury.
Shocked, Harry whipped around to look at Malfoy.  “You’re not playing quidditch this year?”  He parroted.  “What’s wrong with you?”  Harry couldn’t imagine anything less than a life-threatening injury preventing someone from playing quidditch.
"Yes, Master, but later.  He needs to be with Severus now, so they can both heal."
Oh God, someone up there was definitely trying to make his life hell.  The Slytherins looked uncomfortable, they'd been avoiding a confrontation for weeks and they didn't want one now.
Zabini’s scowl darkened.  “I concede, you wanker, now let me up!”  Malfoy’s smirk turned into a grin.
The five Slytherins left the common room bags in hand.  Draco hugged himself and shivered.  He felt very exposed, all alone.  He wasn't alone, he reminded himself.  Harry had agreed to look after him, even though he knew what he was, despite what he had done to him in the past.  He didn't deserve it, he knew that.
Calcare didn't look like he really understood the question.  "I suppose so."
Once back in the common room, Harry related the evening’s events to Ron and Hermione.  “But Malfoy’s not allowed to drink, he’s underage.”  Hermione objected.
Harry eased his horse back from a canter into a trot, the cool shade of the forest giving way to the summer heat as he rode through the open fields that surrounded his home.  The purchase of this estate had been one of his first actions after the war.  England had become claustrophobic, the Ministry needed rebuilding from the ground up and Harry didn’t have the stomach for it.  There was also a certain faction that wanted to infantilise him, treat him as a school child rather than a man who had just orchestrated the defeat of the most powerful dark wizard of the age.  Harry didn’t want to be somewhere where important conversations ended as he entered the room, where people told him not to concern himself with matters of consequence.  The decision to move to France had been easy.  Louis welcomed him warmly into both the court and his confidences, and Harry no longer felt the need to constantly look over his shoulder.
“Just tired from all of the dancing and feasting at Versailles, I’m sure.”  Zabini interjected, clapping a hand onto Malfoy’s shoulder.  For some reason, the familiarity irritated Harry.
The man shook his head, looking truly concerned now.  Harry wondered if it could be true, if Draco could really be here without anyone knowing who he was.
Slughorn moved on quickly.  “I was so glad to hear the news of your new nephew, Draco.”
“And what,” a voice interrupted the hysteria, “is so funny?  Flora?  Charlotte?”
Draco sighed and stood up. He pulled out his wand and muttered: “perpurgare.”
"No ma'am."
"I want to know if you'd like me to court you."
“My mother was never Queen.”  Malfoy corrected.  “She was the Dauphine when she met my father.”  Harry rolled his eyes and Malfoy scowled.  “These things are important, many of the nobility will use any excuse to take offence.  Demanding a public apology for some imagined slight is a key form of political manoeuvring.  Be precise when you speak and keep your temper, whatever veiled insults are made against you.”
“They’re huge.”  Was all Harry could think to say.
"What's in it for the wizard."
“But in poor health, I understand.”  Zabini showed his teeth again.
Malfoy nodded.  “Anyone in the ranks with enough finesse to unpick your wards defected with my father.  We’re safe here.”
“I’m not going to be sick.” There was an awkward pause in which Draco stowed his wand back in his robes and Mr Potter levered himself off the sofa. “Look, Draco, you were right that I wouldn’t have kissed you if I hadn’t been drunk.” Draco swallowed and reminded himself that he had expected this. “But not for the reason that you’re thinking.” Mr Potter hurried on. “I do find you very attractive…”
"Harry," Harry corrected softly.
The statue tutted.  “Nonsense, you’re the brother of the King.”
Harry sighed.  “No.  Well, maybe.  He gave me a letter from his half-brother.  You know, his brother’s the King of France.”
She retreated for a second before returning with a box.  She opened it to reveal three items.  A bracelet about eight centimetres wide, a hair clasp and a collar.  They were all white gold and all studded with emeralds.
Murmurs cascaded through the courthouse.  Kingsley stepped down from his seat with the rest of the Wizengamont and over to the witness stand.  The Lawyer, as Harry had christened him in his mind, stood again and moved up to the stand.
"You've just punished him in a very gentle way because he did something that's harmful to him, think you've more than proved that you care."
Draco shuddered at the memory. “Vytautas Abakanowicz,” he put in automatically. God, he’d been so jealous he’d thought he might die.
“And what does the rest of this contingency plan involve.  Me and Malfoy hiding in here while everybody else does the fighting?”
“Nope, like it here.” He slurred, then he slumped against Draco’s side. “Need to say thank you, Draco.”
Harry refused to allow his anger to be piqued.  "I don't want to accuse him of anything, sir." He took a deep breathe.  "I want to court him."
“What is this?”  He asked on impulse.
The Pureblood Ideal:
Zabini’s face contorted.  “You’re pathetic, Weasley.  I mean really, nine months in the womb and your mother ended up with you.  Jesus Christ, I bet she cries herself to sleep every night.”  He rounded on Harry, “And as for you, Potter-”
Harry followed after her, still trying to comprehend that she'd called Malfoy precious.
“Yes,” Draco conceded.
“Well, I’m sure you’ll throw out the seating plan if you go alone.”
"It's okay, baby." Harry reassured him softly.  "It's gonna hurt a bit but I'll make it worth it, I promise."
Harry collapsed next to Draco as his aftershocks faded. Draco nestled tiredly into his side. They were both pleasantly sated and riding high on endorphins. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d been this content, certainly never with another lover. It was a long time before either of them spoke.
"Great," Harry muttered, "that'll be discreet."
Harry had no idea who Bonnaire was or what his work was like, but he nodded along sincerely.  Their Serene Highnesses, Harry guessed, were Lisette’s parents, the Prince and Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.  Maybe a portrait of the Dauphin would make the grandparents happy, Harry didn’t know.
Draco started up a litany of ‘now’s until Harry slowly pressed the head of his cock into him. Draco tipped his head back on the bed; he loved this bit, slowly being filled until he couldn’t take anymore. Harry was so thick – he was so full, the stretch so good.
Snape shot him a piercing glance.  “Quickly.”  He muttered, and brushed past Condé.
Malfoy merely nodded and tucked it behind his ear.
Whispers erupted throughout the Hall.  Some of the students, mainly Purebloods,  seemed to understand what they were looking at and soon the words Magical Submissive were floating through the Hall.  There was no other reasonable explanation for a Malfoy kneeling at the feet of a Potter.
Harry shook his head at Ron's immaturity, this was why Hermione had suggested they didn't tell Ron about the whole magical submissive thing.  "You think they won, Ron?" Just for something to say, really.
“It’s beautiful, Your Majesty.”  Harry answered truthfully.
“You didn’t say that to Malfoy, did you?”
"Might be a bit of a problem for some of us.  Ron nearly had a fit when he found out Crabbe and Goyle are sharing a bed."
Goyle had just finished putting the car hood up and locking it.  He smiled over at her.  “Sorry, traffic.”
"I know, baby, but I'm going to make it perfect."
Draco blushed even harder but shook his head.  "No, Master.  We can bond whenever you're ready, as long as all the boxes have been ticked."
Snape poured Harry and himself glasses of a clear, deep purple liquid.  The light from the fire shone through the liquid and turned Snape's skin  purple as he carried the drinks over to the table.  Snape seated himself in the chair across from Harry and sipped his drink.
"I have a six year-old sister.  What, I should have let her die?  Is that what you would have done with your precious Gryffindor bravery?" Blaise hissed.
"Dove, after breakfast I want you to stay with Greg and Vince.  I need to sort everything out for this afternoon."
“It was no trouble,” the Queen demurred, “and my Belle loves them so much.”
Everyone had settled themselves on beds now for their impromptu getting-know-you session.
“No, but since his uncle died he is his grandfather’s only heir.  He must play the part.”
"Don't be so melodramatic Rem, it could be worse."
Hermione shook her head.  “You two are so immature.”
"I don't think it will be, all I have to do is prove I care about Draco and we'll be able to bond."
“We weren’t paying attention,” Lady Charlotte admitted unnecessarily.
Harry was saved from spending the entire morning with the Chevalier, but not by a more favourable fate.  Snape came across them taking a stroll in the Orangery.  He cut through the Chevalier’s prattle about Florence de Rohan, the beauteous maid who had so cruelly jilted him, with a single utterance of Harry’s title.
In fact, Draco had never been touched sexually.  Not even by himself.  Not even before he had turned seventeen.  He couldn't, couldn't bring himself pleasure without permission and couldn't allow another to before he was claimed.  Once he was claimed only his master could touch him or give permission for him to touch himself.  Harry groaned low in his throat, if he claimed Draco he would be the first and last to bring him pleasure.  The master, of course, could do as they pleased.  They could have as many lovers as they wanted.
"Says me, and I'm a Malfoy so I win." Draco flicked his hair and returned to his essay.
Mr Potter paled at that. “Damn, this is serious. Do you have any ideas, Draco? Perhaps we should leak the photos of the Lithuanian Embassy Christmas Ball, after all. It would make a point. You still have them, don’t you?”
“I wasn’t sure,” Draco started, and then stopped again.  “Who…”. He couldn’t finish this question either.
"We could be evil, sadistic people who love the idea of being Death Eaters and want to kill you and Lily because you aren't pureblood."
"I'll see what I can do.  Lie on your back."
“Why doesn’t that surprise me? Shall I call through to ask him if he’s available to see you?”
“I’m not hearing a question, Potter.”
“How do you know this stuff?”
Nott went next. "Theo,"
As they neared the Slytherin common room, the wall slid open and Goyle stepped out. “Oh,” he said, and stopped short as he saw them.  “There you are, Draco.”
The Duc rolled his eyes.  “You’re a lost cause.”  He turned to Harry.  “Will you join us on the hunt tomorrow?”
Draco looked up into his Godfather's eyes.  They were dark and serious as ever.
"I think there's something going on with him."
Harry finished his own breakfast, interspersing eating with feeding Draco. The whispers continued.  Some people looked towards them with contempt, others awe, but most just looked confused.
Snape looked at Harry as though he were a particularly hideous fish that had just flopped out of the pool they were circumnavigating onto the path at his feet.  “Have you learnt nothing?  You are about to try to persuade the King of France that he should invest his own money and men in a war on foreign soil.  One he does not yet believe concerns him.  One that would be a political minefield.  That will take more than an honest face and a good story.”
"Lilith said I will be."
"Are you going back to sleep already?" Harry asked incredulously.
“With the Chevalier de Maintenon and the Duc d’Enghien.”  Malfoy glanced at Harry.  “Perhaps I could relieve you of Lord Dorchester, Your Majesty, if you’re finished with him.”
Malfoy was once again flanked by Bors and Ajax, and all three stopped when they saw Harry and Lisette.  “Your Majesty,” Malfoy said, and bowed.  The dogs, following Malfoy’s cue, executed bows of their own.  They bent and laid their front legs on the floor up to the elbow, their back legs remaining straight, and their tails wagged happily.
"He had escaped from Azkaban, he was merely returned upon capture."
"I'm already ready."
Vince frowned.  "Well, Hermione already knows, Neville doesn't seem like the type of guy to ask and no one else will notice if you have Draco with you."
“If that’s all.”  Malfoy made for the door.
“And the other Slytherins?  Did you grow up with them?”
Blaise shook his head.  "Cocky bitch." He muttered, tousling Draco's hair.
Harry nodded.  "Yeah, and you should have seen the way they treat Malfoy.  It's like he's made of glass or something.  They all look at him kind of... gently."
Harry did as he had been instructed.  The hound sniffed thoughtfully at Harry’s hand, and then lowered his chin onto it.  Harry stared at the handful of Wolfhound muzzle he held.
"Of course, Lily."
"Well, a little, Master - er, Harry.  I don't really know what to do."
Ginny snorted.  “Oh right, just a letter from the King of France.  No big deal.”
It was a Thursday when Greg and Vince approached him.  Their wedding was approaching and they spent most of their weekends at home organising it, leaving Draco under the watchful gaze of Blaise,Theo and Pansy.  They cornered him in the common room.
Draco yawned, "Yes, Master."
Harry pulled loose the tie holding closed Draco's silver robe.  It fell from his shoulders to pool on the floor like molten metal.  Next came the black slip.  It too was held only by a tie, the entire outfit was designed for easy access to Draco's body.  He pushed that to the floor as well where it mixed with the silver to make a stormy grey.
"I probably would have before I got to know you guys properly." There was silence as they both contemplated the past.
Harry didn’t know what to think.  At least that sounded a little more like Malfoy.  Harry broke the wax seal and unfolded the parchment to reveal a handwritten letter.
"Harry, please, now."
“I can walk.” He snapped.
"Slytherin, definitely.  I don't even want to think about what the Gryffindors would do to Draco if they were near him in that position."
The couple nodded knowingly.  "You punished him, yeah?" Vince checked.
“Shall we get on with it?  Malfoy asked.
Harry leaned down and met Draco's lips with his own.  It was only their second kiss but Draco opened his mouth for Harry immediately.  Harry still had the blond's arms pinned to the wall above his head, now he moved Draco's wrists into one hand and used the spare one to pull their bodies together.  Harry groaned at the feeling of Draco's hips pressed against him while he continued to explore Draco's mouth with his tongue.  This was rapidly becoming too intense.  Harry somehow found the strength to pull away from Dove's mouth gently.
“I think maybe they expect you to keep up with what’s happening in the world yourself.”
“They’ll be in the Great Hall, with everyone else.”
“And where do you think you are, silly goose?”  The Queen asked.
“You’re so miserable,” Enghein joined in.
Draco came out of it slowly.  His whimpers turned to harsh breathing and he clutched at his friends.  Harry got up and and came over to Dove's bed.
“And you are?”  Lady Charlotte retorted.
"Draco,"
“It was obviously something.”  Harry insisted doggedly.
“It’s about Draco, then.”
“That was no trouble either, sir. More serving my own interests, really. Won’t do me any good if I loose you. Work-wise, I mean, sir.” Draco knew that Mr Potter was too drunk to infer any other meaning from the sentence.
Malfoy pursed his lips.  “I suspected that might be the case.  Shall I communicate your grateful acceptance to His Majesty?”
“He wants me to focus on my school work, NEWTs are important and he says sixth year is where all the real work is done.”  Malfoy’s expression gave no clue as to how he might feel about this.
“Not yet,” Harry replied.  And then he was stepping through the doors and the hall was before him.
“He’s got a hell of a temper, though.”  Harry noted, repeating Nott’s sentiment.
Draco blushed.  "You didn't have to, Master."
"Yeah, I did hope you'd enjoy it." Harry laughed at the reproachful look that earned him.
The children nodded in tandem, then dispersed.  The conversation had taken no more than thirty seconds, a brief lull in the heated battle.  Severus went to the Dark Lord and be murdered while Draco, Greg and Vince went to the Room of Requirement to burn.
GVGVGVGVGVGV
"But don't tell him the whole thing.  Say you only heard half."
"He was fine.  We had a bit of a heart to heart after he hit Ron.  Is it true Snape told you to destroy Ravenclaw's diadem?"
“Yes, Harry please, help me find it. They were a birthday present from Greg.” Harry knew this well enough; he’d given Goyle an advance on his salary so that he could pay for the delicate diamond studs.
“Don’t be so awful,” admonished the Queen.
They were approaching the centre of the semi-circle, and ahead of them on the left a corridor opened up leading further into the stables.  On the right the arches ended and there was an arched doorway.  The doors were closed and there was a circular opening where the keyhole would normally be.  Malfoy took the portkey from within his robes and slid it into the opening.  The lock clicked and the doors began to swing open.
"Yeah, about daddy."
Harry gave Draco another gentle, chaste kiss before leading him into the corridor for their next lesson, potions.
“I can’t ride.”  Harry admitted.
Harry entered the jewelry store cautiously.  He had left Draco with Greg and Vince after they had gotten back from Potter Manor while he had gone into Hogsmeade.  He was looking for something to buy Draco, something expensive.  Jewelry shops always scared him, though.  The sales assistants always jumped on you to try and make you buy something, if you refused help they watched you suspiciously as you browsed.
“This is one of several contingency plans the staff has in place for eventualities such as this.”  Snape sighed, “Try to keep your frustration under control, Mr Potter, you’re going to be in a confined space for the foreseeable future.”
As for Sirius’s insistence that Draco could be a good friend to him, and easy to look at on top of it all, Harry was beginning to think that this was just bait used in an effort to make New York University more appealing. His godfather would not be above a childish ploy to encourage Harry to move North so that he could take up in the city permanently as Harry’s chaperone.
Maybe it would be better if you lived somewhere other than the home where your parents are buried.
This trip was made entirely to indulge his godfather and satisfy his obligation to tour New York University, the single northern postgrad program to which he had been accepted. His plan was to spend the week with Sirius, and Sirius’s relations as necessary. He would walk the undoubtedly impressive campus, graciously decline his acceptance in favor of a local southern choice, and go right back home.
“No, just the week. I’m only here to look at NYU…”
Draco stilled under his touch, not returning the touch or pulling away. His smoldering grey eyes locked onto Harry’s, pinning him.
“They’d be worth every penny if he came to a decent amount of parties,” she said dryly, holding her hand out as if she expected Draco to pass her his container. “He’s missed half of the summer season.”
Harry glanced down at the black leather dress shoes crossed casually over one another on the floor of the back seat. Every inch of Draco dripped wealth, from his shoes and striped socks to the gleaming silver flask that had found its way back to his lips. It was all laid on so thick that it almost looked like a costume.
“Well, that’s a completely different story.  Very scandalous.”  She looked quite delighted by it.  “The current king, that’s Louis XXIII, his father was Charles XV, and his mother is Narcissa Malfoy.”
“Where’s the Duc d’Orleans?”  He asked, his voice icy calm.  “Tell me, and I’ll heal you.”
"I meant no offence, Master.  It's just, some Dominants choose to marry someone else and live with them while keeping their submissive elsewhere." His eyes were now trained on the floor.
"Possibly."
Harry laughed wryly and took a sip of his purple drink.  It was sweet and refreshing, tasting a little of apples, with a powerful kick of alcohol.
"Mende," Severus approached.  "You're doing well today."
“Oh, yeah, ok.  That suits me too.”  Harry was inexplicably surprised by Malfoy’s statement.  Every new detail about his life made Malfoy seem more like a real person to Harry, and Harry wasn’t sure whether he found it interesting or disconcerting.
Draco did as he was asked while Harry quickly undressed.  Harry positioned himself in front of Draco, slipping a hand behind his submissive's head.
“Then you’ll have to stay here with the ladies.”  Enghien smirked again, and Harry realised that he was being teased.
“But you can’t allow the public to know that.” Mr Potter sighed and moved around Draco to grab his tea, which Draco took as admission that he was right. “And it’s not like you actually have to marry her, you know she’s just waiting until she has enough money to elope with Greg.” Greg Goyle was Mr Potter’s security guard, at Draco’s behest, and was not considered an adequate match for Daphne by her parents. Daphne thought otherwise. “Now remember, during the service try to look touched, but don’t get tearful, no one likes a tearful civil servant. Try to stay out of any informal photos, but allow a few formal ones, preferable with the Minister, and make sure Daphne is at your side. You’ll be seated at a table with Daphne and probably some others from the ministry. The meal is likely to be a simple three-course with table service, I sincerely doubt that the Minister’s daughter will have opted for a buffet, so start with the cutlery on the outside and move inwards with each course. There’ll most likely be wine on the table, offer it around, starting with the ladies, before you pour your own glass, and do try not to get drunk. We don’t want a repeat of the Lithuanian Embassy’s Christmas Ball again, do we?” Mr Potter winced at he reminder of that particular debacle.
“Home sweet home,” he said as he pushed the door open, and the Wolfhounds bounded ahead of him into the room.
Harry summoned lubricant from his bedside table.  He removed his fingers and slicked them with it before gently pushing them back inside Draco, their movement aided by the viscous liquid.  He pushed them in further and Draco's whole body tensed as Harry touched his prostate.
They sat down to play, and Harry found himself opposite, and therefore in partnership with, Henri d’Enghien.  As Malfoy dealt the first hand, Alexandre de Montespan set up a running chatter that seemed unstoppable.  Harry found himself adding in a few comments when he could, as did Malfoy and Enghien.  Mostly it was a rundown of the court gossip, which Harry only followed a small amount of.  He settled into a contented rhythm of cards and idle conversation, and soon he and the Duc had the requisite five points to win the game.
Harry leant down and pressed his lips to Draco's.  Their tongues tied moments later, Harry invading Draco's mouth with his tongue.  He lifted the smaller boy onto his lap and held him close.  Tongue still caressing Draco's, he encouraged the blond to straddle him.  When Draco did, Harry ground their bodies together harder.  Draco whimpered as pleasure washed over him.  The bond was ready, he knew it, and now he was desperate for it to be completed.  He had waited so long.
“I came to see you.”  Harry said, realising the truth of it.  “Your brother wants you home.”
“He’ll be happy to see you, I’m sure.”
"How?  The Dark Lord wants you three," he motioned at the Slytherins, "to join him.  So you decided that it would be a good idea put your lives in danger by spying against him, you know, so you can die painful deaths.  How could it be worse, Cissa?"
Malfoy gave him a look.  “You have met my father, haven’t you, Potter?”
Harry knocked on the door of the Potions Master's office.
"I think I'd like it if you courted me, sir." Draco said timidly, after only a moments hesitation.
"Oh, right, thanks." Harry watched as Draco's tiny hand relinquished it's hold.
"How may I return the favour, Master?"
“I don’t like all this sitting round, though.”  Ron continued.  “Feels like we’re just waiting for the Death Eaters to come and get us.  I suppose being in a castle with only one way out is a bit of a tactical disadvantage in this situation.”
“The fact is there have been threats.”  Malfoy admitted.
“Have you ever seen Swan Lake?”  Draco asked.
"Yeah.  Dove told you all that?"
Draco ushered Daphne ahead of him into Mr Potter’s office. Mr Potter was behind his desk, and stood to greet Daphne. He asked Draco to stay as well.
Harry looked across at the Slytherins taking this class with him.  It was Draco, Blaise and Greg.  They were silent, not discussing what was going on with Snape, perhaps they already knew.  Draco, sitting at the next bench from him, was biting his lip worriedly.
Pansy looked back at her work. “Good afternoon, Mr Weasley.” She reiterated pointedly.
“Well,” Hermione said emphatically, and Harry wondered if he was going to regret asking.  “Louis XVII had a sister, called Marie Thérèse, and Charles X had a son, Louis Antoine, and they got married.”  She drew them onto the tree.  “Louis Antoine’s mother was a witch, and he was a wizard.  So when Marie Thérèse and Louis Antoine had a son-”
“Yes,” Harry replied, “as long as I get the NEWTs I need.”
Malfoy shrugged.  “She’s the King’s wife, and they’re a good match.”  His words were as impersonal as ever, but thee was a hint of warmth in his tone, and Harry suspected that he did in fact rather like Queen Élizabeth.
“From His Majesty, King Louis the twenty-third.”  Malfoy clarified.
"I'm just a distant cousin to the main line, Lucius and I have the same grandfather.  Mende Malfoy, at your service." He gave a courtly bow. "And you, my little cousin, how are you?" He addressed Draco.
"Thank you.  I've never really been able to tell anyone that before.  I don't want them to think I'm really the way I pretended to be."
Draco leaned forward towards Harry under guise of putting Belle in his lap.  “Time is of the essence, the Dark Lord’s power grows in Britain and if His Majesty is going to move against him it must be soon.  He wishes to hear your case so that he can make a quick decision.”
Theo and Pansy approached with their two boys, Rory and Alexander.  Their relationship was more stable now, though their arguments were still legendary.  Greg and Vince were travelling, they hadn't really stopped since their honeymoon, they enjoyed the nomadic lifestyle too much.  But they always visited regularly and were favoured uncles among the children for the exotic gifts they brought with them.  Neville and Luna were at Hogwarts, Neville teaching Herbology and Luna teaching Arithmancy.  Lucius and Severus were enjoying early retirement in the Malfoy villa in France and McGonagall was always pestering Draco to take Severus's old job, as his replacement was nowhere near as capable.

“Repressed homosexuality.”  Enghien said casually, and Harry couldn’t tell if he was being serious or not.
The Queen laughed, and the dogs scampered over to her as soon as Malfoy had straightened.  She gave them each an affectionate scratch.  “It’s so nice to see them reunited with you.”  She told Malfoy as he approached.  “Your father wanted to keep them confined to the stables during your absence, but I forbade it.  They stayed with me instead.”
“And what if I just release a statement saying that we’re not getting married, end of story?”
The rest of the room seemed to have quietened down.  Ron was sulking about being teased by the Slytherins and there was quiet banter issuing from the green and silver side of the room.  Malfoy was quiet, only responding when spoken to, although he seemed to do that good-naturedly enough.  He had a soft smile for anyone who interacted with him, and the others looked on indulgently whenever he joined the discussion.
"This is so cool.  It's exactly what that scum deserves."
“Bors and Ajax brought down a buck.”  He announced proudly.
“No?” replied Draco, unsettled by the turn the conversation had taken.
“Oh, of course.”  Harry stood as well.
“Now, usual training duel rules apply; do try not maim one another.  And for the benefit of the audience, cast your spells aloud.  Do you understand?”  Both Slytherins nodded.  “Then you may begin.”
"Overruled." Countered Madam Bones.  "Minister Shacklebolt has seen these memories, I'm sure he knows what he's talking about.  Please continue."
“Oh,” Harry said in surprise.  He glanced around at the women who had accompanied them; they were a little way behind and talking softly.  “Are you sure?”  Harry had never had any suggestion from Malfoy that that would be appropriate.
Friday morning saw Draco on his bed with his feet flat, back arched and head tipped back.
"And he has to kneel at you feet." Vince finished.
Draco didn’t even need a moment to think. “I want to suck your cock.” He whispered as he climbed onto the bed after Harry.
She smoothed the paper out on the table while she poured tea from the teapot into a cup with her other hand, then she added milk and stirred before she settled in to skim the front page.  It took her less than a minute, and then she sat back with a smile.
Draco just looked at him. “If you’re going to be sick, sir, could you do it somewhere that isn’t on me.”
Harry tipped his head back and groaned. He should have known the picture would have made the papers before either of them had the chance to stop it. After the Lithuanian Embassy’s Christmas Ball, Draco had managed to secure the originals and copies of the photographs before they had left the photographer’s office, by what means Harry wasn’t exactly sure. That method would clearly not work in this case.
"Can you imagine what people would say if the Chosen One, who'd just increased his power tenfold by bonding with a magical submissive, spoke out against you."
Harry frowned, of course not.  “What about my friends?”  He asked, deflated.
“I don’t know really, just tired I suppose.  Too much time spent at a desk, its nothing really.”  He hesitated.  “But my father doesn’t want me to play this year.”  He admitted.
Harry smiled.  "Good, but I won't do anything until you're ready as well."
They all stopped at a distance and bowed.  He waved them forward.
"Hey Harry, how are the dorms?"
“What was that about?”  Harry asked Malfoy when he joined him in Snape’s office.
“By portkey, I imagine.”  Snape said.  “It is permitted for courtiers to create their own portkeys to leave, is it not?”
Harry sat down next to Draco.  "Hey, Draco?"
“They’ve been staying with me since you’ve been gone.”  Harry explained, feeling a little breathless.
"Then what was used, Auror Calcare?"
“What do you think?”  The Queen asked as she led him further into the hall.
Harry shook himself.  He probably shouldn't be thinking that.  He got himself a glass of water and went back to bed.
“You two are going to be the highest on their list of targets.  There’s no point making it easy for them.”  Flosi explained.
"Let's go round and say our names, in case anyone doesn't know." Nott suggested, which was lucky really as Harry had no idea what his first name was.  "It'll be like team-building."
Harry stood with Ron outside the Defence classroom.  Defence lessons with Snape hadn’t been as appalling as Harry had feared.  They had focuses not, as Remus had done, on magical beings, and not, as Umbridge tried, on theory, but rather on the practical skills necessary to defeat an opposing wizard.  So far, Snape had drilled them on hexes, jinxes, counter curses and defensive magic.  He had promised them that in this lesson, they would be able to put all this to use and duel each other.  Harry had found himself reluctantly looking forward to the lessons, in spite of the teacher, and was rather excited to actually get some duelling practice.  He also felt that they were finally learning something constructive, something that Harry, and everyone else who was going to be sucked into this war, could actually use.
"Relax, we've spent years researching this, you'll get there."
“His Majesty has requested your presence at the palace.”  Snape told him, his face betraying nothing.
“My brother believes his right to rule comes from God.  As do we all.”  Draco touched his crucifix, caressed it.  “He took the fact that his father’s second wife was barren and he became king against all expectations as confirmation of this.  He will not bow to another.”
"Really." Harry smiled.  "Well I might call you pet, you are mine, after all."
Draco smiled shyly.  "I sort of got that when you comforted me after I punched him."
“And what has wonder-ferret come up with to get you out of this one, then?” They both knew what he was referring to.
“We do our best.”  Flosi replied.  “Come, cousin, it’s late.”  And before Harry had really registered McGonagall’s words, he had ushered Malfoy out of the room.
"Oh, like he did for you, Harry.  Never said a word about your parents, did he?"
Harry began to retort, but was interrupted by the thunder of paws and two huge streaks of grey before Malfoy was covered in a mound of moving fur.
“Weelll,” Lady Charlotte drew out the syllable, exchanging a significant look with her fellow Maid, “in that case perhaps you can answer a question for us.”

As Harry watched, frozen, Greg blinked his eyes open.  He sat up and shook Vince awake.  Vince looked around groggily then his eyes fixed on Draco.  They both got out of bed and made their way over to the crying boy.
Vince shook his head bitterly.  "They're not for other people."
Draco leant forward and fixed Harry with his disconcerting blank gaze.  “It’s of utmost importance that the King take your side, the Ministry is doing nothing to fight the Dark Lord.  The King’s support, both politically and militarily, is your best chance of destroying him.”  Harry hadn’t heard Draco talk so openly about the purpose of Harry’s visit before.
HDHDHDHDHDHDHDHDHD
“Is that likely?”  Harry asked.  Louis hadn’t seemed like the type to want to exterminate all muggles and muggleborns, but he might be self-centred enough to acquiesce to Voldemort’s demands to keep his life comfortable.
The next day was Saturday and Harry and Draco were in Professor Snape's private quarters.
"Why?" He bit the back of Draco's neck.  "Last night wasn't enough for you?"
"Fine, I guess.  It's gonna be weird sharing with the other houses."
"Dove, would you get me my bag, please?" He asked casually.
Snape shrugged, “We’ll simply have to keep trying.  If we continue to appeal to his Majesty, perhaps he’ll see reason.”
“I’m okay, thanks, Hermione.”  The last thing Harry wanted was an impenetrable text book on wizarding history.
As Harry directed his mare around the side of the house to the stables, he saw a figure in black robes leaning against the stable door.  Harry was still not a notably good rider, and Esther was his only horse, a calm lady in middle age who put up with his poor posture and was happy to indulge his morning canters through the woods.  Nonetheless he was capable of dismounting without incident and passing Esther’s reins to his only stable hand.
When Potter ran he half-heartedly followed.  The more faithful, like his sister-in-law, followed with more vigour.  He watched the fighting with a sinking heart.  This would never end well, and when it didn't, he would be the one to pay.  He just hoped someone would keep Draco safe for him.
“I suppose congratulations are in order, sir.” Draco was smirking.
“Come on, this is Malfoy we’re talking about.”  Ron reminded her.  “I don’t think he’s going to tell Harry anything that would help him.”
“Which he doesn’t.”  The Duc acknowledged.  “You’d go with him, wouldn’t you, Montespan?”
Malfoy shrugged enigmatically.  “They think they do.”  Then he strode away down the corridor, shoes ringing out on the floor.
"Of course, Harry."
“Ah yes,” McGonagall murmured, “just who we’ve been waiting for.”
“What did you have in mind?” asked Daphne curiously.
"Yes," Calcare announced proudly, "I believe I have."
“Ok, good idea.”  Harry agreed.  He didn’t want to make any more of a fool of himself than necessary.
“Didn’t mean… help… this evening.” Mr Potter’s sentences were loosing coherence as he fought to stay awake. “Meant… sorting out all that… rubbish… with Daphne.”
One good thing had come out of it though.  Professor Snape had given them their own room, it was being cleaned at the moment, but it would be ready by tomorrow.  Harry was relieved to say the least, he hadn't looked forward to claiming his submissive in a crowded dormitory, Draco deserved better than that.
Harry was surprised that Malfoy had managed to wait his turn and not interrupted earlier.  Now he lifted his eyes briefly in Slughorn’s direction before dropping them again.  “We are all grateful that God has granted His Majesty a healthy child.”  He replied, and his hand went to his throat, where Harry saw a small, silver crucifix hanging.
"Thank you."
Vince took Harry by the arm as soon as Draco had gotten in the shower.  "Today won't be easy.  First you have to get through breakfast; then there's classes, Draco will have to come to yours; people aren't going to be kind, you know, and there's protocol to follow."
"And because of that I was made to hate Slytherins and like Gryffindors and be the perfect little soldier for the Light?" Harry's temper was piqued.
“This allows admittance only for those who were touching the portkey at the time of travel.”  Malfoy explained.  “The doorway is warded against all others.”
“Unlike you, Malfoy, I wasn’t born into this stuff.”
Harry didn’t know.  “He’d surely understand if you’re not ready for the intensity of Versailles after everything you’ve been through.”
“Evidently.”
“How is Malfoy the object of my devotion?”
“Well, you know how Daphne and Greg have been saving up to, er, take some time off, so to speak?”
“How about you and me go out for a drink sometime and practice some magical togetherness?” Ron’s pick up lines were awful, but he looked hopeful.
“I think the King will want to speak to you tomorrow,” Draco told Harry in an undertone as the other two launched into a discussion of tomorrow’s food.
Severus sat on his bed in the Slytherin dormitories.  He was leaning against the headboard with Luc in between his legs.  Remus was lounging against a pillar of the four-poster at the other end of the bed.  Lily and Cissa were on the opposite side to him halfway down the bed.
"Did you have a nightmare?" He asked softly.
Draco blushed, he'd never been kissed before as this was his first courting.  "Okay."
"He's not..."
“Mr Weasley, what and unexpected pleasure. Do you have an appointment?” Harry could just make out Draco’s words through the heavy door.
‘Oh come on, Hermione, its Malfoy.  We’ve never been civil.”
Harry was early.  He had told himself it was because after rescheduling Quidditch trials to the next evening he had nothing better to do, but in reality he knew it was because he didn’t want to piss Malfoy off by being late.  He hung around in the corridor outside Snape’s office for five minutes until Malfoy showed up at seven on the dot.  As ever, he was flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.  He opened the door to the office and gestured Harry in ahead of him.
Dear Mr Potter,
Harry stared in shock, Draco was not usually this timid, or formal.  "Oh, um, you can call me Harry."
“Then why are they bothering?”  Harry asked, more to himself than Snape, as he was aware it wasn’t exactly the brightest question.  Then a thought occurred and glanced up quickly to meet Snape’s eyes, where he saw it mirrored.  “It’s a distraction.”
“Langlock!”  Malfoy cut across whatever curse Zabini had been about to cast, though Harry had his suspicions, and hopped up onto his desk as Zabini spluttered.  “Petrificus Totalus!”  Zabini keeled over backwards with a thud.
Harry reached over and tilted his head up.  "Dove, it's okay, really.  I was being an ungrateful brat and you had every right to pull me up on it."
"Well, we have to maintain your cover, but we have to protect Harry as well."
Malfoy offered the man another upward twitch of his lips, and then turned to Harry.  “A word, Potter.  Outside.”
Malfoy’s exhaustion had returned when Harry saw him next.  The previous weekend had been the christening of the Dauphin, which Malfoy had attended.  The photos in the Prophet, not, this time the front page, had shown Malfoy with his family in the gardens of Versailles.  Malfoy’s nephew, Jean-Luc, was swaddled in a long white robe and held by his mother.  Malfoy was in thick robes against the November chill, navy with silver embroidery.  The dark fabric was stark against Malfoy’s skin and Malfoy looked tense as he looked out from the picture.  The King also looked tense, resplendent as he was in white and gold, there was a tightness around his eyes and his smile appeared forced.
“You’re worried about Snape.”  Harry realised.
“I’m sure.”  Malfoy echoed.  Then he stood.  “If you’ll excuse me, Professor, I have prefect duties I must attend to.”
“Oh, so they’re your staff.”
“I can’t, I’ll be in Hogsmeade early for Mass.  How about Sunday evening, after dinner?”
Draco bit his lip.  "I'm not meant to tell you, sir.  I'm sorry." He looked up at Harry with his big grey eyes and Harry may have melted.
“Will you join us for some Whist, Lord Dorchester?”  The Duc d’Enghien asked graciously.
"I'm Harry Potter, I just wanted to thank you for doing such a convincing job in there."
Harry looked up as someone entered the dormitory, it was Hermione.  They hadn't really had a chance to talk recently, Harry was busy with Draco and spent most of his time with him, Greg and Vince.  Hermione had gotten quite close to Pansy, enjoying watching the drama of Pansy’s on off relationship with Theo.
“You must attend his Majesty immediately.”  Condé informed them.
“What’re they doing here?”  Ron hissed.  “They should be in fucking Azkaban.”
“I meant what I said before, you don’t need to be so formal.” His grip tightened on Draco’s shoulder.
“Lord Dorchester,” Louis replied.  “We are very pleased to have you at our court.  I hope your journey was comfortable.”
Luckily, Hermione did not seem to be in a hurry to raid the Black library, as she sometimes was, and simply chuckled and said, “Ok, history lesson time.”  She reached into her bag and produced parchment and a biro.
"Its okay, you're forgiven.  And you're allowed to make mistakes, Dove, just try to learn from them."
“Well, I’m sure there’s loads of protocol and stuff that I should know about.”
"I dint think it's anything sinister, 'Mione, just odd.  He doesn't seem himself.  I'm actually..." Harry looked down.  "I'm actually a bit worried."
"Master?" Draco's voice was muffled by sleep and the pillow.
"Yes, I'm looking for a courting gift for my submissive."
“I don’t know if I can come back.”  Draco said, face suddenly open and vulnerable, fingers still at his throat.  “People will have moved on, settled.”
Malfoy’s rooms were smaller than Harry’s.  There was a foyer and a room beyond it, and a door off to the right.  In the room ahead Harry could see two young men, Harry’s age or a little older, sat at a table and being enthusiastically greeted by Bors and Ajax.  They stood when they saw Malfoy and Harry.
“I have Quidditch this evening.”
Harry had stayed in the gardens until people had begun to leave for bed in the early hours, more to observe the Christmas Eve festivities than with any wish to partake in them.  He had barely managed to drift to sleep when a tremor ran through the walls and ceiling that shook him to the bone.  He shot to his feet as the palace continued shaking.  It was a feeling familiar to Harry from the assault on Hogwarts.  Versailles was under attack.
“Skarpheðinn specialises in curse-breaking and warding,” Malfoy explained, gesturing to the man who had spoken, “Flosi in runes and defensive magic.”
“If you have an interest in such things then I’m sure demonstrations can be arranged.”  Flosi offered.
Harry almost got distracted by just how cute he sounded when he spoke.  He smiled reassuringly at Draco.  "Don't worry, Dove, I'll make sure you don't get lost while they're away."
"Oh, Goddess.  That was good, sir."
“The wards are linked directly to the castle foundations.”  Hermione explained.  “We’re feeling the full force of the spells hitting them.  If they break the castle could start to come down around our ears.”
The Slytherins laughed.  “Well, where else do you want us to do it?  The common room?”
Harry grinned, he'd hoped Draco would say something like that.  "Well, you could put this on for me." He reached over and retrieved the collar he had bought Draco from the dresser.
Malfoy threw him a furious look.  “Sire, is it really appropriate to have the Potter boy here at this juncture?”
"Dove?" Harry asked gently.
"Yes, Master." Then he looked tremulously up at Harry.  "Is... is that it, Master?"
Draco felt his cheeks heat; oh yes, he still had those photographs, kept very safely beside his bed. “Nothing that drastic, sir.” Although not far off, he had to admit. “I was just thinking that if you can’t breach this imaginary contract, then…”
"This is very important." Severus told him again.  "There's a diadem in the Room of Hidden Things.  It needs to be destroyed, Fiend Fyre should do it.  There's no time to explain."
“You’re actually quite important, Potter, I don’t know if you’ve noticed.  Anyway, I’m not stupid enough to get on Draco’s bad side, you saw what he did to Blaise.”
Draco smiled.  “She’s named after Eleanor of Aquitaine, and I think she merits the comparison.”
As Harry had feared, Slughorn was quick to probe McLaggen and Belby for information about their prosperous relatives.  McLaggen passed the test, obviously having a close relationship to his well-connected uncle, but Belby was less fortunate as his father and the uncle in question were not close.  Then it was Zabini’s turn.
"It's part of the bond.  So you'll have to decide which table you want to sit at.  Gryffindor or Slytherin?"
“Showers?”  Crabbe suggested.
"That doesn't matter.  I'll die for my son if I have to."
Harry laid his hand on Draco's shoulder.  "You okay?" He asked softly.
“My chambers,” Malfoy replied, “they’re in the southern wing.”
Malfoy gave his little, expressive shrug.  “I suppose.”  He smiled a little, just a softening of his sharp eyes and a twitch of his lips.  “Don’t worry, I’ll look after you.”  Harry didn’t know how to respond, and before he could formulate anything, Malfoy held out a narrow silver rod.  It was about the length of Harry’s forearm and had the appearance of two engraved sword hilts lain pommel to pommel.  “This will take us to the stables.”
Draco blushed and Harry realised was the first he had called him Dove, it had seemed natural at the time.  "Thank you, Harry." Draco murmured the last word so quietly Harry almost missed it, but when Draco looked up at him questioningly Harry smiled encouragingly.
"Enter."
“Who?”  Harry asked.
"I'm an old man, Harry, you'll always be children to me."
Greg nodded as if he had expected this.  "Good," he said sincerely.  "You should talk to Severus, though."
“Off.”  Came Malfoy’s voice from somewhere behind one of the dogs’ massive heads.  Immediately both dogs flopped back to the floor.  “That’s very bad manners.”  Malfoy remonstrated with the enormous hounds as he brushed himself off, and they both hung their heads and flicked their tails low in apology.  Malfoy smiled indulgently.  “But it’s alright,” he told them, and their tails came back up to wag furiously.  They were each as tall as Harry’s waist and, though slender, had broad, muscular shoulders.  Their fur was coarse and shades of grey and brown.  Malfoy crouched down and held out a hand to each dog, and they came in with their heads low and their bodies wiggling happily to butt their faces against his hands and snuffle in his ears.  “Alright,” Malfoy said after a few moments, standing up, “that’s enough.  Go and say hello to Potter.”
“And will you be going?”
“I know, darling, I’m a monster and there’s simply no hope for me,” Pansy replied, turning fully in her seat to reach back and brush Draco’s hair out of his eyes. Although her tone was light, Harry could swear there was a measure of real tenderness in the way her gloved hand stroked her friend’s hair.
“Tell me what else you do,” Harry said, trying to coax more something more than vague indifference or clever sass out of Draco.
Draco rolled his eyes.
Millicent leaned forward, addressing Harry.
“Gatsby?”
“Only the wealthiest bootlegger this side of the Mason Dixon,” Blaise said.
“Draco knows what he did. He just wanted to be in the back
“Are you both alright?” Harry asked quietly, gently squeezing Draco’s hand.
“No, thank you...not just yet,” Harry said.
Draco had the audacity to smile shyly in return.
“Pansy, won’t you turn on the radio?” Draco said sweetly, leaning forward to run a hand through her gleaming black hair. “Or wait ten goddamn minutes. It’s not like we’re far from the party.”
“She talks a big game, but she would never actually do that,” Draco said. His voice was so soft that just the wind whipping through the windows may have been enough to conceal it. “Sometimes people pretend not to care when they really do.”
“For instance, what if the economy took a downward turn. Having a meaningful education could protect you from being destitute...”
“To the party!” Pansy yelled, pulling Blaise and Millicent with her towards the door.
If he could, Harry would have happily ridden halfway out of the window to give them all more space. Draco and his pack had been friends for a long time and Harry felt akin to an explorer who was trying to communicate with an ancient tribe...except he didn’t understand the language or know a damn thing about the local customs. He couldn’t tell if they were talking about him, or if they wanted him to participate more, or really if they even wanted him there at all.
“You put her in the front with me. You know what happens when you let her sit up front.”
Pansy waved her hand airly at Draco.
Harry imagined that in this city where the name Malfoy was its own calling card, Draco was given no chance to be his own person. And in a class of people who had no motivation to achieve anything because of their privilege, Draco would be scoffed at by his peers for not taking advantage of it, or by wasting his time trying to learn something that could just as easily be bought.
“I was.” Draco said it so softly Harry read his lips rather than heard the words.
“He has been staying with us, so I do see him fairly often. But...yes. He’s been kind to me.”
Harry grimaced and turned away to look out the window. The way Draco’s friends stayed insulated behind their money and power was at best obnoxious and at worst criminal. And if Draco was different, Harry could understand why he would feel the need to stay liquored up, to stay detached. Harry felt detached in Georgia. But he was also embittered by it.
The smell of melting asphalt filled Harry’s nostrils as they drove, and the sidewalks were bustling with people, some already in their evening clothes. Harry felt as though he were so far out the window that he could scoop up a puppy right from the sidewalk vendors arms, or pluck a bouquet from one of the standing carts. From his vantage point he spied Draco’s reflection in the side mirror; he was taking a long, lavish pull from his flask, head thrown back and throat bobbing slowly. Although Harry thought it was typical that Draco began nursing a flask the moment he was alone with his friends, this act was the first thing Harry had seen the Manhattan socialite do that wasn’t done in an extraneous rush.
“If I don’t go somewhere with this lot, they assume I didn’t go at all,” he said.
Harry was wearing exactly what he had gotten off the train in - a light brown summer suit with dark brown suspenders and a skinny green tie, the one Sirius always said brought out his eyes. But Draco looked absolutely immaculate in a pressed black tuxedo with a striped vest and plain bowtie, still a little ruffled-looking from his climb into the back seat. They looked like they belonged to an entirely different class of people.
Harry stared at Draco’s long, delicate fingers and the cigarette he offered with the tiny Nat Sherman stamp near the filter.
Harry leaned in.
“One of us,” Millicent echoed with a wink.
He decided that even in the most complicated and obscure cultures, it was bad manners to refuse both a drink and a cigarette. Harry didn’t smoke often, but Nat Sherman was a brand that he was especially susceptible to. Each cigarette had a touch of menthol oil rubbed on the filter, making it minty and sweet on your lips as you inhaled. He took a long, thoughtful drag, savoring the rare indulgence. He wondered absently if Draco tasted like sweet mint....it would certainly suit someone with pale skin and full lips like his. More likely, though, his tongue had the permanent malty bite of old, expensive whiskey.
Draco ran a hand through his platinum hair and sucked in a quiet breath, followed by a long drag of his cigarette that sizzled down to the filter. Harry watched from the corner of his eye as Draco took a few moments to relax into what looked like his normal, snarky self. His grip on Harry loosened, and he nestled their interlocked hands into the small space between where their thighs touched, hiding them from view.
Draco pursed his lips, but said nothing. Instead he took a pull from his flask, and this time Harry noticed that it had an etching of a green dragon. When he looked closer, he saw that it was encrusted with tiny emeralds for eyes.
“Pansy!” Blaise gasped, voice ringing with ironic scandal. “What a horrible thing to say.”
“But...Sirius said you didn’t drink…”
badly,” she said, her voice somewhat mocking.
“Well, lucky for us, if we hit someone, you can fix them. You must know something about medicine from all those nights spent studying.”
Harry flushed. Draco’s soft breath was right in the crook of his neck, his hands on Harry’s side, bracing himself from being pushed too far. Draco gradually adjusted to a comfortable seated position, his bowtie and collar loosened from the fray. Try as he might to remember that Draco was only a pretty face from a wealthy family, Harry couldn’t help but enjoy when he moved slowly.
“Business,” Harry answered awkwardly. Although Pansy had slid so far over from the passenger seat that she was nearly in Blaise’s lap, and Millicent was lost in her own thoughts, he still knew that they could hear what he and Draco were saying, and that made him feel observed, like at any moment they all might turn and exchange another look over his ideas.
The five partygoers piled into the Duesenberg. It was sweltering hot, but Harry wouldn’t dare complain. Complaining was both rude and pointless; it wouldn’t make the city any less hot.
Harry did not drink at all, but he would never say that in such company. Religious retribution had nothing to do with his decision...Harry feared neither fire nor brimstone. He just didn't like to lose control.
But then Draco was looking at Pansy like she was the least interesting thing he had ever laid eyes on, and, even though Draco’s hand was still interlaced with his, Harry wasn’t sure he had been correct.
They grinned at each other like hyenas of the same pack, both affectionate and predatory. Harry got the distinct impression that they were enjoying themselves, that this was all just a big game to them. Harry felt as though he had no place in it.
The heavy tension in the car subsided.
“Don’t you worry about me, my love. No matter what I do, the Malfoy name and all that comes with it follows me as persistently as my own shadow.”
As a matter of fact, in the short time he had spent in their company, the only thing he was able to gleam about each member of the party was how dangerous they each were in their own way. Millicent was willing to go along with anything, Blaise was a slave to his immediate desires, Pansy was actively trying to create drama and Draco was too attractive and too sharp for Harry to defend against.
She clicked on the dial without responding. The heartbreaking whine of a trombone with the backing of a full brass band filled the empty space and blotted out most of the salacious noises, but not the sight of Pansy’s arm stroking a repetitive motion over Blaise’s sleek blue trousers.
“Really? It’s a beautiful campus, and a prestigious university. May I inquire as to what you'll be attending for?”
A bright flash blinded him momentarily, and the car swerved wildly. Wind rushed through the windows at a new angle, and the roar of it momentarily drowned out the screaming crescendo of a car horn as Millicent and Draco were crushed against Harry’s frame.
“One of Gatsby’s parties,” Millicent said, the flash of a match briefly illuminating her face.
Millicent and Pansy exchanged condescending glances, and Harry wholeheartedly regretted giving his unsolicited opinion. Draco tapped his chin thoughtfully, assessing Harry with warm grey eyes.
Draco flicked the remains of his cigarette out Harry’s window and opened his mouth to speak, but Pansy took her lips away from Blaise's ear long enough to turn her grin on Draco, cutting him off.
Harry felt nearly overwhelmed by the excess of it all, the sense of royalty and entitlement it bestowed. He edged closer to Draco and tried to keep his heart confined to his chest as their shoulders brushed.
To add insult to an already stressful endeavor, ‘spending time with Sirius’s blood relatives’ apparently meant that Harry be introduced to Narcissa and her aloof husband to exchange pleasantries and then be gently shooed over to the kids table. Harry would have been furious if Sirius hadn’t been adamant for weeks that Harry meet Draco, the notoriously blasé heir to the Malfoy fortune. Sirius had written about Draco in nearly every letter, describing him with a certain poetry, and speaking of him with admiration.
Pansy and Draco began the process of switching seats, climbing over each other and laughing, falling and kicking up their legs in a graceless ballet. Pansy's dress clinked and gleamed in the sunset like a crystal chandelier, and the feather on her glittering headband nearly snapped against the ceiling.
Draco wagged a finger at her and slid the flask back in his jacket pocket. He winked at Harry.
With Pansy and Blaise clearly occupied, Millicent off in her own thoughts, and the sweet sounds of blues coming through the radio, maybe now would be the best time to try to talk to Draco. He almost felt as though they were alone, compartmentalized and free to converse without input from the rest of the group. Harry was emboldened by it, and he would be lying if he said he wasn’t at all curious about Draco. What was it that Sirius saw that he was missing...or was there really nothing there at all?
This time Harry pursed his lips. He wondered if Draco was making a guess about him, or if Sirius was a two way street of information.
It was pitch black on this side of the bridge, the darkness broken by a seemingly endless shower of dry grey flakes drifting through the air. It was ancient and eerie; a motor tour through Pompey just as Vesuvius coughed the first round of ash from its throat.
“He would, too,” Millicent pointedly informed Harry before turning away in favor of the window.
According to Sirius, Draco had been accepted to Columbia for Medical Such and Such, and was already signed up for his fall classes. This tied in perfectly with the long, repetitive paragraphs dedicated to lecturing him about getting out of his comfort zone.
“Draco, for the love of…” she was laughing, but with no small amount of force, she batted his ankles off of her person and pushed him closer to Harry. “Get your shoes off of my dress.”
‘Of course you need to let everyone know you’re unhappy. Typical socialite behavior,’ he thought and tried to concentrate on the way the breeze from the open windows caressed his face. He was in the back seat directly behind Draco, crowded uncomfortably with two acquaintances on the sticky leather bench.
For the briefest moment, Harry felt as though this exchange was about him.
Harry shook his head.
