“Shall we give these Gryffindors a show, Malfoy?” She had said loud enough to get the trio’s attention, and to earn a hoot and holler from Millicent, Theodore, and Blaise. The others seemed too shocked to fully understand what was going on.
His thoughts were interrupted when he heard his name being called. It shouldn’t have come as a surprise to him that he would see her here, especially since she just moved into a flat not far from his place. Even so, when he saw her standing in front of him, he was at a loss for words.
Blaise sighed, “I don’t know. Everyone has been so on edge since word got out about Robards assigning a special team for some top-secret case.  The newcomers like me know nothing about it. You met with Robards, didn’t you? What did he tell you about it?”
“I’m an empath, you see, and I can sense-”
He definitely looked worse for wear, he didn’t need a mirror to tell him that. Pansy, on the other hand, looked rather put together. She wore a surprisingly simple Muggle outfit. Her hair was tied in a bun, and her face looked freshly cleaned. She must have had an early start to the day, he presumed.
“I will not.” Draco felt his words come out stronger this time as he sprang up from the table, though the tears had already begun to blur his vision, “I won’t marry some girl I could never love!”
“Draco,” Theodore leaned closer to chat, despite the roaring noise of the public, “How’ve you been, mate? Haven’t seen you in a bit.”
“Truthfully? I don’t know,” Draco responded, eyes refusing to meet his.
Draco and Anthony had shared drinks and chatted a bit more before Draco started to
“Oh,” Draco’s stomach dipped at the memory and the mention of his name, “Well, considering I was inebriated throughout the entirety of it, I can’t say it went as well as it could have.”
Draco turned to Potter, bewildered, “You understand Dutch?”
Pansy smirked, “Come on Draco, no straight man puts
“How?” He asked, puzzled, “I’ve only accepted it myself quite recently.”
Draco wanted to be selfish. He wanted to give into his pride. He had done it for so many years, it wouldn’t be difficult to do so now. How could he not? Draco? An
In this instance, Draco decided that knocking was unnecessary.
“This bloke,” Anthony slurred, “has some of the funniest stories to tell about Blaise.”
Draco couldn’t maintain eye contact and instead focused intently on the menu despite having ordered already, “No.”
“So…what does that have to do with my past?” Draco felt his hands shake a bit from where he placed them in his lap. He bit his bottom lip hard enough to draw blood, hoping to snap him out of whatever trance he was in at that moment.
“Maybe,” Harry looked at his shoes, “I don’t know.”
Draco couldn’t find the words to deny it, to tell him that it was nothing, or that it was just a misunderstanding. He could only look at Harry, who for the briefest moment caught his eye. In that millisecond their eyes met, a million unsaid words passed between the two of them. Time stopped and for a moment, all he could see was the brilliant emerald of his eyes, drowning everything else out. But the moment was fleeting. Before he could open his mouth, tell Harry how he felt with the faintest of expressions and the silence of his wordless voice, time resumed and he remembered his place from across the room was but another world away.
Had he not been as tipsy as he was, he would have likely decided against the entire endeavor, but Draco’s sound mind was never exactly sound while inebriated. Nevertheless, he persisted, trying to seem as nonchalant as possible by blending in with the crowd, keeping his eyes peeled for any suspicious characters. While he struggled to maneuver himself to the stairs, which led to an open terrace up top, he had thought he heard a familiar voice.
Blaise raised a single brow at him, “A Muggle place?”
he was having a heart attack.
“Our wealth is dwindling since father disappeared, mother. The Aurors have been tracking him and they believe he is in possession of a Time-Turner. I didn’t want it to be true, but it is. They spotted him in Belgium seeking a Curse-Breaker.”
Robards smirked at that, “I had a feeling you’d enjoy it. Once you’re settled in you’ll have free reign over this collection. It’s yours to study and experiment on, though I trust you’ll follow the necessary precautions when handling these Dark Artefacts.”
Draco shook his head, “Not for me, otherwise I wouldn’t have moved away from everyone and everything I’ve ever known.”
He sighed, sinking further into the leather chair. Thinking about all this was giving him a headache, and it made the realization that Draco was still waiting even more bothersome. Bouncing his leg up and down, whilst fidgeting in his chair, he became a bit restless waiting for his possible new employer to show up. When the door finally swung open, he jumped a bit.
“You’ve got a cute little place here. And who’s this little guy?” She looked over at Mittens, languid and saucer-eyed, with a wide grin on her face.
“You know, I was just starting to think you’re alright,” Harry called out to him as Draco exited the room, “But you’re still the same arrogant arsehole you’ve always been!”
Harry chuckled to himself as Mittens rubbed his face aggressively against his hand. Standing up, he shook his head at Draco, not in disappointment, but rather something unknown to him, “You continue to surprise me.”
Draco said nothing, just opened and closed his mouth like a fish out of water. He didn’t know how to respond. How could he when he’s heard the words he never expected to hear, the very same that Draco had felt for so long but was too afraid to say himself?
Harry trailed off, as if searching for the correct word, though he was a bit distracted as he patted Mitten’s head and body.
Draco smiled back, scratching at the nape of his neck, “His name is Mittens. He’s quite friendly if you want to hold him.”
Anthony laughed, “Aren’t we all, mate?”
Draco had found, surprisingly, that Anthony and Justin were actually decent company. Justin, being Muggle born and all, worked in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office. Blaise had befriended him, on accident really, during the first few months of his Auror training, where he was assigned a case in which he had to inquire about a Muggle weapon. Anthony also worked in the Ministry, doing some administrative work, where he befriended many people, including Blaise and Justin.
Longbottom spoke up next, sporting a rather unnerved expression, “And if we find nothing?”
to talk to him as often as he could.
have to have this conversation again, mother?” He looked at her pointedly.
He knew what she was going to say. ‘Draco dear, you have a duty to your family and our name. You can have as many hush-hush side romances as you want, but you need to carry on the Malfoy line blah blah blah’. He’s had this conversation more than once and was
“Not only that, but now I'm to search for my father who may be trying to bring the Dark Lord back.” Draco sighed, still feeling numb to the fact that this was his life now and
Draco hummed, staring off in the distance at some ornate painting of the Malfoy family, back when they were happy. Lucius looked as stern as ever, but young Draco was smiling a bit as he looked up to his mother, and for a moment they shared a glance with a glint of something in their eyes that Draco couldn’t quite place.
Suddenly, the attention was on him. He looked up at Potter to find him sharing a smile with him. Frankly, he wasn’t sure Potter had ever looked at him like that. His heartbeat was rapid, beating frantically in his chest to the point where his hands began to shake. All eyes were on him now and Draco thought he’d pass out right then and there. It was happening, the same familiar feeling he’d gotten so used to in the years past. His palms shook, his fingertips began to tingle and he couldn’t breathe, no matter how many breaths he took. He needed to get out of there immediately.
Blaise lifted an eyebrow at that, “Since when have the two of you become so close?”
The man sputtered, causing Draco to instinctively throw a dirty look at Potter before reassuring the old man, “You don’t have to answer that. Thank you for your time, Sébastien. I just have one more question.”
Draco opened his mouth to speak but hesitated for a moment when he saw Blaise’s expectant glance.
“I was going to say cozy,” Harry met Draco’s gaze for a moment, startling the blonde wizard with an undeniable warmth behind his eyes and a slight, crooked smile. Just one look was enough to wreck him and Draco felt as though he’d collapse right then and there if he wasn’t gripping the wooden bed frame for support.
he thought to himself, ‘
“Here, a present,” Draco wasn’t looking at Pansy, but he could practically see the smirk on her face, “for you. Looks like you desperately need it.”
Draco perked up then. He couldn’t really be suggesting-
Irma giggled at the sight, while Blaise gave Draco a deadly glare, though eventually complied. Even Potter cracked a smile at the sight as he and Longbottom followed the pair into Draco’s office.
“Why here? At a Muggle art museum?” Potter wondered out loud, taking in some of the hyperrealistic art pieces around him.
For the first 6 months or so after the war, he had no choice but to stay at the Manor until his trial approached. After the trial had ended, he no longer found it in him to stay in that wretched house. It was his childhood home, the only place he’d ever really known besides Hogwarts, but the war ruined them both for him and he found himself tired of it all. After that, he packed up his things, wrote a letter to his mother, and settled in a small loft in a Muggle neighborhood in London. It was a simple life, one that his family could not understand, but one he was content with. He didn’t need the same things he thought he did before the war, and certainly didn’t want the same things. For the first time in his life, the Muggle world seemed much more favorable than the Wizarding world for that fact alone.
Draco sat in his office, tapping his pen against the desk incessantly. The
(See the end of the chapter for
“Robards said he was spotted not far from here, along the museum grounds. He was spotted for only a second, but we have a witness who confirms it was him. Blaise, I want you to question the witness while Potter and I search the grounds.” Draco started, pointing off in the not so far distance to where the museum should be, before directing his attention to Longbottom and Irma, “Meanwhile, you two are to report to the local Auror department here and conduct your tracking spells.”
Draco cleared his throat, taking a step back from the close approximation of Harry’s body, which had moved far too close for comfort. It wasn’t that he didn’t appreciate the history lesson, he just had no idea why he was there in the first place.
Blaise rolled his eyes, “Obviously, but why are you here in the Auror department?”
He had hardly noticed his mother’s presence whenever he was in the Manor. His mind was always a million miles away, reminiscing on some of the darkest moments of his life - all taking place here. A deep bitterness had set in his heart and he’d come to despise his childhood home, but his mother was still there. Regardless of her misdeeds, he couldn’t bring himself to hating her like he hated his father. She had birthed him, she had loved him when no one else did.
What does it mean?” Blaise craned his head over to Draco who narrowed his eyes at the magical lettering.
“We’re not here to arrest you,” Blaise reassured the man, “we just need information on Lucius.”
Mittens, pleased from all the positive attention he’s gotten, curled up in Draco’s lap as he nursed the half-filled drink in his hand - a concoction of vodka and something fruity that Justin, playing the bartender, had whipped up in a flash. All the women in the room turned and “aww’ed” at the sight. Irma scooted next to him on his couch, letting Mittens sniff her hand before he rubbed against it.
Pansy sighed, “Believe me, I’m trying. It seems, however, the head of the Floo Network Authority has a personal vendetta against me.”
Draco thought back on all the times his father spent working on the Time-Turner in his home. He remembered for many months after the war, Lucius’s cries of frustration could be heard throughout the whole house when he couldn’t get the damned thing to work. Perhaps his “business” that kept him out of the country for so long was really him trying to find someone to fix it for him.
She gave him a knowing look as she sipped her coffee, “You know. Seeing Potter again.”
“So did you? Have some fun?” Draco waggled his eyebrows at her, causing her to laugh and playfully slap him on the arm.
“Look, all I’m saying,” Blaise hesitated, as his voice softened to a barely audible murmur, “is to be careful, Draco.”
Draco smiled at her, “I’m happy for you, Pans.”
Harry looked sheepish, “Well, I have something of yours.”
“I’ve some news.”
“You...you cannot be serious,” he muttered, taking note of everyone’s smiling, happy faces compared to the somber one on his.
Draco shrugged, “You never know.”
Draco grinned as Blaise led him through the main doors, “Neither did I, mate. Neither did I.”
“You may take a seat,” The lackey spoke in a particularly disdainful voice, offering no more than that as he took his leave.
Footsteps echoed inside the men’s room until they reached the sink and turned the faucet off. Draco didn’t dare look to see who it was, but he had a feeling it was Blaise. It always was Blaise who came to calm him when Draco embarrassed himself like this.
"You want to
Harry and Draco stand outside the school Headmistress’s office, exchanging nervous looks. This is a new realm of parenting for both of them.
They both felt a bit pleased at the realization that they could still communicate silently like that. It was an old code. As an only child who grew up in a quiet house, Draco often got overwhelmed in the face of the exuberance of the Weasley family, even though he really did enjoy being around them. Well,
"From what I understand, I need to let him challenge me for the position of Alpha."
Draco's hand stilled at the sound of his name. He had been staring into the fire, lost in thought, running his fingers through Harry's hair. He turned to look at him.
Harry rolled his eyes and picked him up, carrying him the short distance to the bedroom, where he helped him under the sheets and crawled in after him.
"I don't—I don't know. I'm
"What?"
"Does it hurt?"
"That you're my pet human."
The she-wolf stood over the young black wolf, growling ferociously as the grey wolf lowered his head and advanced once again, this time with a new target.
Draco threw himself at his boyfriend, wrapping him in a hug so tight Harry complained about not being able to breathe. Draco released him and kissed him happily. "Thank you."
"Harry. You need to wake up. Come on, Harry!
Oh, he was

Draco murmured against his ear, and Harry shivered.
watched Harry force himself to enter another house full of horrible memories not that long ago—”
The ensuing row, when Weasley confronted Harry the next day, had been intense, and Draco had held Harry tightly afterward when he'd shown up on his doorstep, desperately promising him that his choice to be with Draco wouldn't end his lifelong friendships with Weasley and Granger and hoping against all hope that he wasn't lying to him.
"Yeah?" Harry was breathless, his eyes  incredibly soft as he looked down at him; the warmth in them helping warm Draco from the inside out.
"What does that mean?"
Draco smiled back. "Yes...I wonder, too. I guess I'd better get up there, then."
“Teddy likes most people,” Harry smiles and leans over to nudge Draco’s shoulder with his own. “If you like him, Teddy probably will, too.”
using that thing!" He looked pleadingly at Draco, who shrugged.
Harry smiled weakly. "I wish that I didn't, Drake. I really wish I didn't."
"I'm sorry for these," Harry whispers, running his own fingers over the Sectumsempra scars on Draco's chest.
” Draco blurts. “But he was so excited to see you tonight! I thought—”
He stepped past Ron through the doorway. Ron moved to follow, but Draco called him back.
"Good," Draco winks and turns back to his magical cooking.
After they ate, they took an

"What have I
"Draco?"
! What am I going to
Draco took his hand and laced their fingers together. "I'm coming. I love you, I'm never letting you walk into a fight alone again."
At this, she laughed aloud. "See what I mean? Good influence."
Draco gently trailed his hands over his arm, chest, shoulder, upper back... He replaced his hands with his mouth and Harry tipped his head back, releasing a low moan. His fists were clenched tightly, as if he were at war with himself. This was clearly
“Wait.”
"I, er," Harry floundered. "I'm not sick, I'm sorry, I just didn't know how to..."
"I'm so sorry to bother you, Harry," George said anxiously, as Harry turned to look at him. "But I can't find Nadine, and there's been an alert. Someone's attempting to breach the Wards at the front gate."
The Golden Boy approaches tentatively, hands raised.
Draco nodded, leaning over to rest his head on Harry's chest. "I don't like it. You've had more than enough violence in your life. You've already seen far too much death. You shouldn't have to face any more."
. How could I? I'm hopelessly in love with him. I have been for a while now."
"I forgive you in advance," Draco teased. "But just this once, because it
"So you'll talk to Harry? Soon?"
Draco swallows nervously as he turns to greet his boyfriend, Harry and Teddy turning with him.
"Oh, bloody hell Harry, just kiss me."
"I...um, no. I'm just...his boyfriend."
Harry laughed. "Well, this time I think it's really true."
Harry dropped his gaze, mouth curving into a small, sad smile. "Still, I won't."
That was all the invitation Harry needed to slowly begin thrusting upward, and Draco keened, breathing out a soft "

"Yes."

"Harry, no, you're not—"
"No. Thank you, Jenkins."
"NO!"
Hermione and Ron's sitting room came into focus. The couple were sitting on the sofa, a drink in Ron's hands. He looked miserable, but Draco couldn't bring himself to care. They both turned toward the fireplace at his shout.
Harry kissed him. "Yes! I think they're going to go for it."
Teddy nods, and Potter smiles. “I didn’t have plans tonight, anyway. My friend was just leaving when you got here, so the timing is perfect. Why don’t I get you some ice cream?” He shoots Draco another sharp look. “You
He wasn't likely to admit to it out loud, but Ron was actually glad that Malfoy had made it out okay, too.
He pinched his nose with two fingers and downed the whole thing in one go, shuddering and wiping his mouth with the back of his hand when he finished. He handed the empty vial back to Draco, who corked it and shrunk it down again, tucking it back into his pocket.
A sharp crack indicated Jenkins' arrival, and they both turned to see the House Elf bowing low. "Mistress Malfoy is here to see you, sirs."
The next morning Harry still looked pale and sickly, but he was in surprisingly good spirits when Draco arrived at Grimmauld Place with additional doses of the potions that he'd taken the day before.
"Don't need them anymore," Harry responded with a shrug. "Enhanced werewolf senses and all that."
"Time for a nap, little one!" Hermione swept Rosie up out of her chair, kissing her cheek noisily. "I'll just be a moment." They disappeared up the stairs.
The other man's face was curiously blank, his brilliant green eyes inscrutable.

Lost in the feel of Harry's mouth, the hands cupping is arse, his own hands tangled in Harry's dark locks, Draco whines when Harry abruptly pulls back.

“I know, Ted,” Draco puts an arm around him and gives him a squeeze, pulling away before Teddy has time to object to the physical affection. “I know. And you don’t have to give up just yet, just don’t let this ruin your friendship with Victoire, alright? You’ll regret that more than anything else.”
“No,” Draco sputters, clutching the bouquet of flowers he’d brought for her, “I would not.”
You said,” Harry laughs. “You looked so shocked.”
"McDougal has that new position now though, he outranks Hermione."
"Don't sound so enthusiastic, Draco. I might think you actually like me," Blaise drawls from Draco's other side, eliciting an amused cackle from Pansy.
They’re making dinner as planned when Teddy comes through the Floo and catches them kissing.
After Harry finished, Draco slid under the covers with him. "I can't believe how calm these last few months have been."
Draco stared at him. "Are you sure that's a good idea? I know how apprehensive you've been about—"
"Yeah," Ron grinned. "I really do. And it'll get easier, you know, once things calm down."
“I suppose it’s fine,” Draco pretends to huff.
Draco runs his fingers over the soft fabric and the tight creases along the folded lines. “Are these new?”
“What the hell is...?” Derek starts to ask.
"Hello Harry!"
“A fitting punishment,” Harry laughs, touching his fingers to the wrong cheek, and Draco grins over his shoulder before going home through the Floo.
Harry chuckled and caught his hand, pressing his knuckles to his lips. "Sorry, I wasn't trying to bring that up. Will you eat with me?"
"I am now. I'm sorry I wasn't here. What about—are you alright?"
Ron and Harry both respond with forced, overly-bright smiles, but they relax slightly when Draco informs them that there’s more than enough food for three in the bag and invites Ron to stay.

"Stop interrupting!" Harry admonishes, and Draco pouts but goes quiet.
Ron had his eyes covered with a hand. "Are they clothed?"
"Hey," Draco drew his attention back to him with a gentle touch to his cheek. "Stop that, now. Be here with me."
"Where's Draco?" Ron asks Seamus. "I want to ask him about that barrel roll he did. That was bloody amazing. Did you see it? Fucking

Draco caught his hand and laced their fingers together.
And you continued to date me anyway?
Potter nods politely as he takes the seat beside him. "Malfoy."
Harry stilled and turned away. "I can't, Drake."
"Actually, I was thinking we could go out tonight. You know that pub we used to go to all the time?"
George's blush deepened, and he smiled and indicated toward his small family. "This is Alicia, and our baby Lucas."
Draco lets out a shuddering sigh. “No. I, um, I kissed him. On the cheek. Earlier today. He ran away after.”
Draco ran his hands over his face and through his hair. "I don't know."
"How much of that did you hear?" Harry asked, coming over to him.
Harry pins Draco with a look, his green eyes blazing. "Say it again."
"I didn't want you to see."
I reach up and pull him down for a sweet kiss, and he stretches out over me, slotting our legs together comfortably and burying his face against the other side of my neck, bringing his other hand up to trace over the blank-appearing patch of skin with his thumb like he has hundreds of times before, before it was blank.
"I know I'll have to fight him, but I don't know how or when. Or if I'll need to..." Harry faltered for a moment, "to kill him, or if I just need to best him in a fight. I'll ask Kasper more about it this afternoon."
"Just watch out for him, alright?" Draco said softly.
"Ah, yes. That is what I was nominated to come out and discuss with you."
Draco stares at him, heart leaping in his chest at Harry's words. "It's always been hard for me to believe that you might feel as strongly for me as I do for you, you know that."

Ginny came to kneel by the fireplace, a knowing look in her eyes.
Draco followed Harry's lead and relaxed his defensive stance and fierce expression, finally tucking his wand back into his sleeve. "Oh."

He got to his feet and followed her into the library. She closed the door behind them and turned to face him, eyes brimming with tears.

They started with some of the smaller cuts and scrapes, before working their way up to the deeper bite wounds.

"I'm surprised you're the only one who came up to see what all the fuss is about, Mia-Rose. Where is everyone? Have the others still not returned from the hunt?"
Harry turned to nod to Christine, who was standing between two makeshift beds containing Kasper and Sofia. A third bed was on Sofia's other side, a sheet reverently drawn over the body.
” Harry stammers.
Draco sputtered, "
Draco sat up in the bed and let Harry curl up with his head in his lap, running his slender fingers over Harry's shoulders and back and through his hair, and soon Harry was fast asleep again.
After a month, Robards had observed a training session with Harry and, as much as he'd wanted to, Harry couldn't deny that Draco was ready.
“It’s not that kind of relationship,” Harry says stiffly. “He has no interest in meeting Teddy, ever, and I wouldn’t want him to anyway. It’s...temporary. Mutually beneficial, for the time being.”
“Okay, but—” Teddy cuts himself off at the sight of Lottie and Violet coming downstairs, eleven-year-old Violet desperately trying to hide behind her mother.

“I’ll ask him about it.” Draco hesitates before offering, “Would you, er, would you like to meet them? Harry and Teddy? Then we could still spend Saturdays together, with Teddy…”
"Oh," Draco laughs lightly, "well... carry on, then."
Draco pulled off after a long moment, and crawled up to kiss him on the mouth.
"I couldn't possibly care less what Weasley thinks of my relationship with Harry, Hermione." Draco rolled his eyes.

Harry felt a surge of rage, followed by a disconcerting amount of fear. He leaned forward to rest his head on his folded arms on top of the table as the room around him spun.
“I’m really glad you’re okay,” Draco whispers when the kiss breaks for a moment.

"Don't. Don't run again." Harry's voice is low and hoarse and familiar, and when I turn to face him I'm already throwing my arms around his neck and opening my mouth to accept his kiss.
"So, you didn't stop Neville before he added too much powdered Aconite to his potion yesterday? Or warn a bunch of First Year Hufflepuffs away from going down a corridor where Peeves was having a snit and throwing bricks at everyone?

"What do you want to do?"
"So...who killed Lorcan?" Kasper asked. "How do we..."
“No,” Harry sighs. “He’s still asleep. I’ll tell him when he comes down for breakfast.”

A small smile creeps onto his face, and Draco finds himself answering, “Invite me to stay for dinner and a drink, and I’ll teach you all my secrets.”

"Sorry! Still getting the hang of that again. What's going on, Harry? Thomas was having a meltdown and it took me a few minutes to get him calmed down, but Draco said there was someone trying to get through the Wards?"
Draco nodded shakily, still clinging to him. Harry ran one hand over his back and the other through his hair. "I'm sorry," he whispered, "I'm sorry they don't see you the way that I do."
He picks up a treacle tart from a local bakery and makes dinner—Harry's favorite—and he waits.
Not that Potter wasn't attractive before, he was, but he's stunning as an adult, with his stupid vivid emerald eyes behind his glasses and almost intentionally-looking messy hair and broad shoulders and clearly fit body under his striking crimson Auror robes...
The man gives him a dazzling smile and holds out a hand. “Brandon Somers.”
Draco wrapped his arms around him and held him, pressing soft kisses against his shoulder and whispering soothing words in his ear as Harry's body began to shake. He sobbed hard and turned in his arms, burying his face against his shoulder, and Draco continued running his hands over his back, holding him until Harry finally quieted and started to drift off.
"No," Harry laughed softly, "but feel free to show me."
," I drawl. Another perfect moment from my memories. Not unlike tonight...Is it still night? Or early morning? I'm not sure.
...because...I'm..." He drifted off, leaving his sentence unfinished.
"About as subtle as a freight train, darling," she laughed.

"No. My husband Lewis is very supportive. He was a school teacher at a private Wizarding Primary school, before. Now he homeschools her. And Lewis has a close friend, a former colleague, who is able to quietly make the Wolfsbane potion for her. And we created a...a room. For her. For when she transforms. We're making it work as best we can."
“Right,” Harry lifts the top two boxes, his eyebrows lifting in surprise when Draco picks up the third. “I can come back for that one.”
Ron set the drinks on the nearest table and drew his wand.
"Good idea. Well, start reading and tell me if you find anything that sounds promising."
"Wait!"
"I'll catch the lot of you one day!" Pierson called, dropping his hands to his knees as he caught his breath.
"Yeah, Hermione was with Kingsley in his office trying to wake him up. The strain of having the Imperius Curse lifted made him pass out for a few minutes. Ron was distracting Robards and McDougal outside. She used my invisibility cloak to get in Kingsley's office, so they didn't even know she was in there. Genius, really. I showed up right as things were about to get ugly for Ron, but I incapacitated Robards and McDougal and then Kingsley and Hermione came out of his office and took over from there."
Harry looks up, tilting his head to one side. He scrutinizes Draco's face, looking for any sign of mockery, but he finds only sincerity and understanding there.
"We brought Firewhiskey," Draco leaned over and said conspiratorially to Hermione as they followed her to the living room.
Part of Harry is glad to see it, even if it
She smiled at him. "I understand."
A single tear trailed down his cheek, and Hermione jumped on the bed and threw her arms around him.
come home from work.
"I know," I say, hot tears prickling behind my eyes again and making my voice shake. "I know. But if you let me explain, if you—"
Kasper nodded, bowing his head in acquiescence. "Yes, Alpha. Of course."
Draco huffs and looks away.
Draco pulls him into another fervent kiss, and the sensation of their naked bodies pressed together feels better than either of them could have imagined.
“It’s nice to meet you,” Teddy says sullenly, turning away.
“Yes. Now Apparate back to the Burrow,” Draco orders with an over-the-top parental glare. “You’re not supposed to be here.”
He pulled one of George's newest line of Extendable Ears—now just an earpiece and a tiny beetle-shaped magical transmitter that could sneak almost anywhere without being noticed.
"I'll help you in the kitchen," Draco volunteered.
Potter's vivid green eyes were wide behind his glasses. "You're...?"
"Spider free, I promise. D'you like it?"
“We never worked from our books until Slughorn took over. Before that, we only ever used them for research for our essays. In class, Snape always put the instructions on the blackboard. Technically, you had access to Snape's special instructions for five years before you ever used his old school book…”
He lightly squeezes the hand Draco is clutching tightly. “Draco?”
know about what would make me happy?” Harry says hotly, scowling at him before turning on his heel and heading for the door.
"Just show him you care when he gets home. You'll be fine. I mean,
“Don’t worry, Harry,” Teddy tries to reassure him, “Grandmother Narcissa is really nice.”

“How did you get even
. I still hurt people in the war. Some things can't be forgiven."
," he ordered through gritted teeth. He screamed again, and Draco heard bones cracking.
“What does that mean?” Draco asked Blaise when they sealed the well up again, but the dark-haired wizard didn’t answer and instead shook his head and laughed.
“Damn it,” Potter muttered under his breath, kicking at a leaf that fell from the trees above.
Hi friends! I've been through the ringer these last few months, struggling with health concerns and financial issues but since this COVID-19 business is still running rampant where I live, I have plenty more time to write than ever before. I will be trying to update semi-regularly, though I ask you all to be patient with me since life always has a way of messing things up. I hope you're all staying safe and healthy! Xoxo
“I’m a bit surprised, to be honest.”
A moment paused before Draco realized he needed to step in and say something. The tension was palpable, even worse now that Irma made such an insensitive comment.
Draco looked at the man, confused, until he realized he was staring at Potter again. His green eyes, which were far brighter than Draco remembered, bored into his, forcing him to answer a question he never even asked, and one that Draco fought hard to suppress.
Potter seemed just as uncomfortable as Malfoy when Irma swung her arm around his shoulders, “And of course, I heard about our superstar savior over here.”
Pansy pshawed the notion, “Oh please, since when do you ever go to Blaise for advice?”
“...yes,” He replied, feeling shame and anger coursing through his veins.
Robards shook his head, “Not to our knowledge. As I was saying, we were unable to track his location past Belgium until Auror Weasley and his team got word of someone matching the target’s description in Rotterdam.”
“Draco? Are you listening?” Pansy held her purse over her shoulder, while her heels clicked against the floor.
He must have heard Draco’s question, but did not answer as the two caravanned towards the door.  It wasn’t hot out, though Harry’s face was flushed, likely from the Apparation. Tiny beads of sweat dotted Harry’s forehead as he walked towards the building, threatening to fall with every step he took.
The room was hauntingly quiet, though their voices sprang into the air, reverberating throughout the room discernibly. The noise did not do much to help with the thick tension that encompassed the room, and certainly didn’t help the thundering beat of Draco’s heart against his chest.
Peering over his shoulder, Draco realized it was just the trio this time. A sigh of relief escaped his lungs. He didn’t need to have another Hogwarts reunion party if he were spotted this time around. Yet, the unfortunate reality of the situation was that if he were to get caught spying on the trio, he knew it would not end well for him, especially being that he was alone. He would have no explanation, other than to admit he was indeed spying on them.
Draco realized as he stood abruptly that his appearance looked quite disheveled, not to mention the fact he was mid-panic when Blaise discovered him. He must have been quite a sight to look at. “Official Ministry business. You know I work here, on occasion.”
Pansy’s eyes nearly jumped out of her head while Blaise, Malfoy, and the rest of the group laughed at her facial expression.
Though his office was large, there simply weren't enough seats for all of them. Draco decided to move into the Dark Room, hoping that it would provide enough space for everyone, as well as a private room to discuss their findings. Luckily, there was already a table with multiple chairs near the entrance of the room, just waiting for them to arrive.
Instead of replying, Harry had turned to say goodbye to his friends. It was then that Draco had looked around the now-emptying pub that he realized most of his friends were getting ready to leave as well. Had they really been there for that long?
Draco’s eyes widened once he realized someone was actually inside, “Are you the Curse-Breaker?”
Draco groaned at the loud roar, which only added to the pounding in his head. He shoved his head under the pillow and hoped that whoever his unexpected visitor was, they’d go away.
Draco tried not to snicker. He highly doubted working with the Auror department was going to do anything but worsen his mental health, but she was right. He had no idea when another opportunity like this would happen again.
, you’ve grown into such a lightweight.”
At first, he hadn’t realized that Harry was staring at him. Blaise was in the middle of greeting Weasley, when he noticed the familiar dark mess of hair that was on Harry’s head, and those unrelenting green eyes. It seemed Harry was just as surprised to see him as well, as they both just stared at each other for a moment before the weight of Anthony’s arm on his shoulder began to droop, bringing his attention back to reality.
“What would you have me say, Potter?” Draco took the opportunity to look at Harry,
Blaise furrowed his eyebrows at the blonde wizard, either thinking him an idiot or utterly deranged, “So that’s it then, you’re going to throw your entire career and any chance to see your father again out the window, just like that?”
“How did you know where I lived?” Draco asked, afraid of the possible answer burning in his mind. The blurry memory of being tucked into his silk sheets by an unknown, warm body terrified him.
Pansy scoffed, “Oh please, it’s not like we’re getting married. We had sex, that was all. He left in the morning anyways, so I doubt it’ll happen again.”
“Should we knock?” Blaise asked, causing both Potter and Draco to give him a dirty look, “What? It’s better than blasting the door down, we have no idea who could be inside!”
“Seriously, Draco,” Pansy rested her hand on his shoulder, feeling the warmth emanating from his body, “I think you should go for it.”
Draco and Blaise hadn’t always gotten along when they were in school, especially in sixth year, but they always had respect for one another. Pansy, who was very close with both, was usually the one who brought them together during outings. After the war, neither men had felt the need to continue whatever grudge they had back in school. Since then, they were on better terms, but still hadn't kept in contact all that much. Draco, however, noticed that the man had changed quite a bit since the last time he saw him. He was taller, more muscular – in Draco’s opinion, he was pretty fit.
As always, feel free to comment your thoughts/feelings/questions about this chapter, and I will do my best to answer them! Have a great weekend everyone!
Robards huffed, scratching at his chin, “I figured as much. Well, back to it, I suppose. I’ll see you tomorrow then, lad. Bright and early!”
“I understand your past is a bit...colorful. We all made mistakes when we were kids. But you seem like a changed man.” Anthony said, with a light pink tinge on his cheeks, eyes darting from Draco’s face to the noise from inside.
Draco turned away, his hand frozen on the doorknob.
Draco knew she’d say that, still willfully blind to the fact that their name simply didn’t hold the same power it once did. The reality was that their assets were near frozen after the trial, especially after Lucius disappeared and the Aurors got word of his malicious plans.
Pansy rolled her eyes, “Oh believe me, I would, if I wasn’t bloody starving.”
“I was for a bit, but I’ve come to terms with it,” Draco replied, offering no more to the conversation than that. It was bad enough having to hear it from Pansy, whom he wrote to the night before. She floo’d over after work, discussing Draco’s new case and doing nothing to make Draco feel better about the situation when every five seconds she was asking him how he he felt. Clearly, he wasn’t feeling great about it, so talking about it only made it worse.
Still Malfoy after all these years? “Been a while.”
“The perimeter is secured, there’s no sign of him anywhere.” Potter huffed under his breath, looking dangerously tired due to the large bags under his eyes.
“There, there,” Narcissa crooned in his ear, “It’s alright, Draco.”
Time will pass, and he will heal. Those were the words he always said to himself. As Narcissa ran her fingers through his blonde locks, he stared intently at the portrait of their family resting over the fireplace. Time had passed, that much was true. But if he hadn’t healed by now, he doubted it would ever happen. As his mother held onto him, portrait Draco stared back into the eyes of twenty one year old Draco, mirroring his sadness in a way that it never had before. The sobs ceased, but Draco still stared at that portrait, waiting for the moment the sadness would leave its face. Only, it never did.
He shook his head, trying to be understanding, “I’m not doing it for the money. Besides, there’s something you should know.”
Granger turned to Potter, “Harry, I need to get Ron home. Are you okay getting home on your own?”
look at him. The hurt and confusion was there, but it was masked by anger. Draco found it difficult to look at him so directly, as the regret coursed through him like a rush of adrenaline.
“As you can imagine, we’re a bit backed up here,” He stated, piling on a load of files and paperwork onto his desk.
“Malfoy? Is that you?”
Draco was stuck admiring the foyer. Though it was covered in dust and cobwebs, it was a beautifully decorated home. Draco credited it to the last matron of the house and his great Aunt, Walburga Black. He had heard many unpleasant stories about the woman but had never met her himself. He supposed that was for the best; he doubted she would’ve been a fan of him. Despite that, It was a shame that her home had fallen into such disarray, though even he could not rest the blame on Potter – the ancestral Black home had been all but abandoned throughout his childhood.
That night, Draco roamed the streets until he happened upon a bar with a blinking neon sign that read “Mortar & Pestle”. He thought it was a stupid name and nearly scoffed at it until he witnessed something inside that caught his eye. The bar was packed to the brim with people inside as well as on the second-floor terrace. From across the sea of people, he thought he could just barely make out a silhouette of a black-haired man with glasses, leaning against the outdoor railing. It was difficult to tell – the bar was flooded with muggles, all young and self-important, but the idea refused to leave his mind until he was sure that it was him.
Harry shrugged, “Slightly.”
much effort into his appearance.”
“I take it you’ve never seen the house before,” Harry remarked, digging through the desk in search of something.
“Potter, what do you know about Luxembourg?” His tone verged on excitement, to which Potter could only blink in return, mouth agape.
He shook silently until Potter placed a reluctant hand on his shoulder, “I want to help you, Draco.”
He refused to look at the ashen-haired man, despite him sitting within listening distance of the two conspiring Aurors. Draco just sat there, looking wildly uncomfortable as they discussed the capture of his father, a newfound discovery since his last excursion to the muggle bar where he overheard the Aurors’ plans.
“Yes, and I will tell you the same thing I told him. I cannot help you.” The man finally seemed to take notice of Blaise and Harry standing behind Draco, eying warily at their Auror robes.
Robards looked pleased as he clasped his hands together, “Excellent. Now then! Onto a more important note.”
Draco stood abruptly, “Mother...please tell me you were unaware of this.”
Draco nodded once, allowing Potter to step forward and scan the area with his wand. When he gave them the all-clear signal, the others followed towards the well. Looking down, it seemed to be mysteriously covered by rocks. On the side of the well was a small, bronze plaque with no words visible.
“Maybe there’s another way leading out of this tunnel,” Blaise motioned for the exit, noticing the lights beginning to turn on, meaning they were now open for the public.
With that, Weasley left the room, still refusing eye contact with Draco. It was probably for the best, Draco decided. He didn’t need to receive a scowl from the weasel this early in the morning, for it would surely ruin his day.
Draco nodded in reply. Blaise, taking a quick glance around, suddenly grabbed Draco’s arm and rushed him through the hallway into an empty conference room of some sorts– away from those who could potentially overhear their conversation.  Why it mattered, Draco had no idea, but he did not question it.
“So” she sat down in her chaise stationed in front of the fireplace. Draco sat opposite of her. “Might I ask what this is about?”
the words died in his throat before he could utter them out. He knew she would take them the wrong way, anyways. She
Pansy sighed exasperatedly, rolling his limp body around to face her, “Oh come on, Draco. Stop throwing a pity party for yourself and buy me food!”
“Small?” Draco finished for him.
Pansy snorted, “No, but at least he looked entertained.”
“You don’t have to feel embarrassed.” He replied, stepping closer to Draco now so that they stood face-to-face, mere inches away, “I get it. We all do.”
“I’m sure you do,” he replied.
Robards stopped in front of the chalkboard to call attention to Draco, who stood beside him. He tried not to stare at his feet as dozens of Aurors stared at him like he carried the plague. Some familiar faces he recognized, such as that of Neville Longbottom and Weasley. Potter and Blaise were not seen, thankfully.
He looked down at himself. He was wearing a white silk shirt, one of the nicest ones he owned, and black trousers, with a plain, but expensive, black robe over it. A reminder of the days in which he had wanted for nothing in the Manor. It wasn’t anything out of the ordinary.
Draco nodded, “Of course.” He may be a lot of things, but he’s certainly not an idiot.
“My dear, we’ve ALL known for quite some time. Years even.” Her cackling turned into small giggles, but her face was still as amused as ever.
When they arrived, Draco was unsurprised to find the team waiting for him there. Potter had an uncomfortable look on his face, as did Longbottom. It must have been quite a shock for the both of them to be assigned to a team with two Slytherins they went to school with. Irma, a short, pixie-haired vixen, filed her nails as she leaned into her chair. She looked bored and entirely unprofessional, but from Potter’s testimony, she was one of the best. Draco hoped that would be the case - he couldn’t afford any failures.
He paused with his hand on the door handle, turning his head to look back at the blond-haired wizard.
Draco hummed in response. He had been made well aware of Sirius Black being the black sheep of their family. ‘His presence was a stain on our family’s history’, or so he had heard about a million times from the numerous Blacks he had come to know throughout his life. The same was said for his mother’s sister, Andromeda.
Harry led him through the hallway, passing the Black family china, the very same that his mother had tried so desperately to inherit when he was young. The room itself was full of dusty old books, and an archaic desk that had to have been there for hundreds of years. Draco stared in awe at the grandeur of the ancient library.
He slid across his desk a binder the size of a dictionary, chock full of documents with the Department of Magical Law Enforcement’s logo engraved in the front of it. Draco already dreaded the idea of having to scour through all of those pages.
He turned his head to find Blaise, of all the people, approaching him as he exited the bathroom.
Lucius slammed his fist against the mahogany table, causing his mother’s porcelain tea set to shake from where it stood atop the surface. Draco felt his whole body seize, flinching at the noise. Narcissa sipped her tea as if all was normal and fine, not even blinking an eye at the sudden outburst.
Draco nodded, “I’ll search upstairs if you search the outdoor area.”
“No, mother, I can’t. I...” He started, though his voice began to falter as he realized that this was it - his one defining moment, “I...like men.”
It was relatively cool outside, despite it being the middle of summer – cold enough to see his breath, but not cold enough to need a scarf or gloves. Instead, Draco settled for shoving his hands in his overcoat, which had a warmth charm on the inside of it.
The man looked behind them for a moment, to make sure there was no one else trailing them, before ultimately deciding to appease them, “Alright, come in.”
“Sébastien. I will leave it at that,” He stated, still eying their uniforms suspiciously.
Blaise stayed silent for a moment before hesitantly opening his mouth, “It doesn’t matter what I think. Now go and get dressed, we’re meeting at the Ministry soon.”
“Thank you for the wand,” Draco’s eyes were downcast, as he shoved the wand into his back pocket, “but I must be going.”
“Mother, you know I have to get to work.” He lied again with ease. He didn’t work on the weekends, but going home and laying on his bed with Mittens curling up next to him seemed like a much better option than staying there a moment longer.
Blaise shrugged, “More like a change in my work schedule.”
Draco fought hard not to scoff in front of his mother. His ‘business’ meant trying to rebuild the Malfoy name from the 6 foot grave it was dug under during the war, while staying as far away from Wizarding London as best as he could, lest the Aurors get a hint of whatever malicious plan he has yet to accomplish. From what it sounded like, he was trying to increase their influence elsewhere, if worse came to worst and staying at the Manor was no longer an option. Had Draco been the same person he was three years ago, this would have mattered a great deal to him, and he would likely have joined his father in his endeavors. The thought was now laughable to Draco in numerous ways.
“Oh come on, Blaise,” Draco rolled his eyes at the other man, “you and I both know this is pointless! It’s just another ploy to throw us off of his trail.”
“I’d say you know the majority of us pretty well, don’t you, Malfoy?” Blaise asked with a mischievous look in his eyes. Payback, Draco supposed, for not allowing him to flirt with Miss Dendron.
Draco placed the Time-Turner back into its enclosed clase, muttering the locking spell Robards taught him. When he stood, finally stretching out his legs, he replied to Blaise, “Thank Potter, he was the one who recommended you.”
His mother didn’t seem convinced but decided to not press him any further. She gazed over at him with a look of curiosity as she asked, “Are you leaving so soon?”
Draco sincerely doubted that. Still, he knew better than to argue with her once she'd set her mind on something.
“I’m surprised you’d pick a place like this,” Harry spoke to him first, pointing out the design and architecture of the building - quite rustic - a small, family-type place.
Draco swallowed the lump in his throat, hard.
The man almost looked amused, “No? So you’re not Draco Malfoy?”
Draco felt as though he had no choice but to comply, despite knowing his proclivity towards alcohol was a bit...dangerous at times, if the memory of last time served correctly. Still, what else was there for him to do now that his safe space had been infiltrated by the likes of Pansy Parkinson herself? He and Harry exchanged a shrug before exiting the room together, knowing that whatever was to come now was certainly Pansy’s fault.
Draco laughed, “Always with the comebacks, this one. Give it a rest, Potter. You’ll never be as quick to the punch as I am.”
“Not to play devil’s advocate,” Weasley started, “but I’d say he certainly is different from how he was in school. He may still be a bit of a prat, but he seems more disciplined now.”
Draco had decent conversations with the group, especially Lovegood and Justin, who had enwrapped him into a conversation about current events in the Wizarding world, something Draco appreciated, after having lived in a Muggle neighborhood for so long. He found that he was even able to have a conversation with the Weasleys, including Granger, without a single insult being thrown. It was mostly mundane conversation, a bit awkward at best, but it was better than sitting there scowling, as Draco would have done without all the alcohol in his system. Trying to be amicable towards Granger was a bit more difficult, considering she stared at him as if he was about to hop on the table and start hexing everyone. Instead, Draco decided to fight that battle another day and avoided her presence as best as he could.
The Head Auror led him through a series of hallways and doors until he reached the heart of the Auror department. This was where numerous desks and offices belonging to all of the Aurors were located as well as the break room, an audience chamber, and the evidence room. As Draco followed him into the center where an enchanted chalkboard, likely donated from Hogwarts or Beauxbatons, wrote new information as several Aurors crowded around it, connecting lines and such to several pictures of faces he’s seen before - all Death Eaters. Some of the faces had a big red X marked upon them. Knowing it could only mean one thing, Draco felt his heart drop to his stomach. His father, Augustus Rookwood and Corban Yaxley were the only faces without an X on them.
Harry nodded, silently accepting the apology, but his expression was stony. He was grateful he'd convinced Draco to stay home for this conversation. Coming across that bit of information had sent Draco into a towering rage that had yet to abate.
Paul looks up and gives him another warm smile. “I would love to, but only if you’re sure you feel ready for me to meet them.”
, can they?”
She waved a dismissive hand. "Patience has never been my son's strongest of virtues—go. Oh, and Harry?"
She pulled away to look into his face, placing her hands on his shoulders and arching an eyebrow.
Draco feigned shock and horror. "How
Harry rolled his eyes and turned over again. "Fine. Whatever. Stay as long as you want. I don't care. Jenkins?"
“DAD!” Teddy comes barreling down the stairs. “I did that Quidditch trick you taught me this week! I got the Quaffle past Draco and he didn’t even see it coming!”
"But?"
"Shut up." Harry laughed weakly, "Wait, my broken...? Oh, right. I broke my wrist yesterday."
After wolfing down an obscene amount of food provided by an ecstatic Jenkins—his appetite clearly back in full force—Harry started to yawn.
"I'm sorry," Draco blurts. "I'm sorry, okay? I was wrong, I'm sorry. I still love you. I've regretted that night every second since I left."
"I doubt it. You want to go? I'm sure Oliver could get me a couple tickets last minute if I asked."
Harry smiled. "It's true."
Weasley taking it? Still crying himself to sleep every night?"
They threw themselves into a fierce hug, both crying softly as they clung to each other.
Rumors were flying around the Ministry about Harry Potter, and how he had murdered someone, and the strange turn of events that suddenly had his former boss and mentor, Gawain Robards, pushing for him to get the Dementor's Kiss.
Draco laughed. "You have to say that. You're my mother."
When he reached the door, he turned and pointed his wand right at Ron Weasley's chest.
start getting some energy back. It's already been better, actually. He's been sleeping a lot less during the day. He still gets tired in the evenings, but it's a big improvement from a month ago when he was sleeping half the day as well."
"And the challenge? It's just for dominance, right? You don't have to kill him?"
"Of course! I'll let them know at the front desk that they can come back."
"I love you too," Draco responded shakily, finally releasing his grip on Harry's arms and kissing him fiercely before pulling away and wiping at his eyes. "Kick his arse."
“Yes I was.” Harry chuckled again as he lay back down against Draco. “I do think it could though.”
"The healers aren't sure his leg will ever fully heal," Draco sighed. "He doesn't need it all the time. Stairs are hard for him, though."
"Best morning ever," he laughed into Draco's neck, pressing kisses along it, lightly scratching him with his stubble as he went. "Can I take care of you now?"

"Fine. Cast one of your bloody Privacy Spells, then. Otherwise they'll all hear everything anyways."

There’s no visible physical change in him, but Harry is writhing on the ground, his face twisted in pain like he’s under the Cruciatus Curse, but Draco knows that it’s something different. The electric blue light is unfamiliar, and he’s intimately familiar with that particular Unforgivable.
you!"
"Probably. If they're yelling..."
"What?"
When Harry coaxes his lips open with his tongue, Draco whimpers shamelessly into his mouth, clinging tightly to him. He whimpers again when he's spun and pressed against a wall so that Harry can hold him up more easily, so that he can feel the hard press of Harry's erection against his hip as they slowly begin to move against each other.

Draco left the owl and went to help in the kitchen.

Draco huffed and buried his face in the crook of Harry's neck. "Easier said than done."
Lorcan sneered when Kasper followed Harry into the room and shut the door behind them.
Draco's stomach clenched painfully as he read, and then fury flooded through him. He felt his face heating, angry tears welling up in the corners of his eyes. It was disgraceful, it was revolting, it was

“Oh, nothing. I’m just glad I ran into you and Mal—I mean, Draco—today. I need to get going, but I’ll see you next week, okay?”
“Hello,” Draco looks up from where he’s working, chopping ingredients for his next potion but not actively brewing.
Draco let out a sigh of relief and sank onto the edge of the bed beside Harry. "Is there anything we can do to help him until then?"

Harry looked like he wanted to object to the use of that particular title, especially in reference to his prick, but he slapped a hand over his mouth to stifle the loud, positively
Harry let Draco towel him off, slide a pair of boxers up his legs, and guide him to bed.
"I'm not sure when it changed," Draco whispered.
Harry sighs and runs a hand through his hair. "This is stupid."
"Alright, who are you and what have you done with Harry Potter?"
Harry crawled back into bed and Draco ran a hand over his shoulder. "Are you okay?"
"I think the fever is making you delirious," Draco chuckled, trailing kisses down Harry's neck.
Two and a half months later, and his heart still ached.
"D'you want to stay for dinner? Hermione's made this fantastic-smelling roast chicken and we were just about to sit down. You could tell us more about them while we eat. I mean, if you're hungry... "
getting things because you’re ‘Harry Potter.’”
Harry woke on a dirty floor, like he had every day for the past two weeks since he'd been unceremoniously tossed into this cell, but for the first time since Draco's visit the day before, his head felt remarkably clear.
To his relief, they

"Absolutely. What time?"
“I can understand that,” she says softly, and Draco knows that she does. Ginny lays her head on his shoulder, wrapping an arm around him.
Harry pulled out his wand to magically reinforce the cell doors and Lorcan growled.
“Of course,” Draco steps back to let him into the foyer, then shuts the door behind him. “Harry, what are you…?”
"Crush me to death in our new living room?"
"Hm. Okay, let's not worry about it for now, then. How are you feeling? Any steadier?"

"Sure." Harry had winked at him. Before Apparating away, he'd leaned over and kissed him again, "I'll owl you."

"Talking about me, I hope?" Healer Gordon asked from the doorway, smiling brightly at them.
“Dudley, you remember Draco? My husband,” Harry clarifies, confirming the nature of their relationship and succinctly explaining why Draco is looking at him like he’d like to turn him into a slug all in one. “Why don’t you sit? I’ll tell Lottie you’re here.”
“Are you
They made their way to the bedroom at some point, and were interrupted a while later by a loud tapping on the kitchen window. Harry ignored it, continuing his enthusiastic ministrations on Draco's neck until Draco pushed him off with a hand on his chest.
him. "You can go down if you want. But I grabbed a few things for you from the kitchens in case you didn't."
"Got owled into work — Big lead on a case. Not sure how long I'll be gone, but I'm still planning on Quidditch on Saturday. See you then. —Harry"
•••••
The next day was much of the same, except in the late afternoon Harry drifted off and dreamt of a familiar pack of werewolves.
"I'm not going anywhere. Go back to sleep, love."
After a few hours of this, one person
Draco shakes his head, stepping closer and smiling. “Show me your tattoos?”
Draco sleeps better than he has in years, and, for the first time since the winter chill set in for the season, he wakes up warm. Harry is curled around his back, an arm draped over his waist and their legs tangled together, snoring softly behind him. Draco shifts back against him and freezes when he brushes against a hardness that can only be a morning erection.
"Why not?"
Ron glances over at him, hesitating for a moment before apparently deciding to answer with the complete frankness that Draco has come to appreciate from him.
"Hm. And those wedding rumors," Draco tilted his head to one side, and exaggeratedly curious expression on his face, "any truth to them?"
“I’m sorry,” Harry and Draco say in unison, as they sit down with their full wine glasses later that night.
I can’t do anything but nod. The thought has tormented me for two years. Draco being with...her.
“Are you okay?” Draco asks when he gets back to the foyer where Harry is staring blankly at the wall. He startles at the words, as if he hadn’t realized he was there.
Harry brings Teddy at exactly eight in the morning on May seventh, looking curiously around the entryway of Draco's house when he invites them in.
“I’m the reason they’re together,” Teddy says smugly, the topic of his family pulling him from his dark mood. “They
•••••
Later, Draco finally gets his chance to make Harry tell him about all of his scars.
Draco looks up in surprise. He’s attractive, this person. He’s older than Draco, although it’s difficult to tell by how much. He’s clearly fit, and well dressed, and his face is lined in the right places: the corners of his eyes, around his mouth. His eyes are bright blue and smiling. His jawline is sharp, and his hair is grey at the temples, but otherwise full and dark.
“Stop being a soppy git, Potter.” Draco says, opening his eyes and fixing me with a hard stare. “And fuck me.”
said he was going to check on Harry on his way home from work. She supposed they had gotten to talking, or started a game of chess or something.
Draco glared at Hermione and pulled his lips into a tight line, leaving it to her to try and explain.
“Sorry if we interrupted your
"How unbelievably hot you are."
"Okay."
"Yes," Draco gasps, "yes, I want everythi—Mmm."
"DO YOU REALLY THINK
He tugs at the elastic and Harry nods. Draco drags them down and is struck by the realization that Harry isn’t wearing underwear under them when he finds himself looking at his bare cock. It’s gorgeous, and Draco immediately wants it in his mouth, but not yet. “Potter, you filthy little bitch, you didn’t wear any—” He doesn’t finish the sentence, distracted by Harry gripping himself hard and groaning. Draco grins. “Oh.
Hermione grinned at her husband. "Just because you have the emotional range of a teaspoon, Ronald, doesn't mean we all have."
They haven’t talked about it, any of it, since that night. Since Draco had held him until Harry was wrung out, leaving to pick up Teddy only after Ron and Hermione had arrived to take over and do what they did best.
wonderful."
Harry grins, white teeth flashing in the near-dark. Draco tosses his wand at the bedside table and watches helplessly as it rolls off and clatters to the floor, shooting off a few red sparks in protest as it bounces before rolling under the bed and coming to a stop.
Tentatively, the wolf stepped forward, putting all of his weight on his left paw. He lifted it and set it back down again, before taking another step.
Nadine's expression darkened. "You're doing your godson a disservice by staying away from him now, Harry. And to his father's memory as well, because you're sending a
“Hermione offered to keep Teddy at their house until dinner tonight, around six. He’s already over there.”
Harry eyed him warily as Draco pointed his wand at the injured paw and murmured a simple healing spell. The broken bone snapped back into place, and Harry yelped and darted away from him, leaping off of the bed and spinning around to look at him, whimpering.
The three of them researched endlessly, trying to figure out how to restore Ron's memories in hopes of finding a clue to help them.
“Yeah. And me. Is that weird? Do we need, er, different names?”
After a several silent minutes of letter burning, Harry laced his fingers through Draco's and set their intertwined hands back on his knee. In response, Draco gave his hand a squeeze, but still didn't speak. Once the last of the letters burned, they simply sat together, staring into the flames.
until recently—"
The first brush of their lips was hesitant. Harry brought a hand up to Draco's cheek. Draco made a soft sound and pressed closer. Harry grabbed Draco around the waist and tugged him on top of him on the bed.
"I'm highly evolved, Weasel, I wouldn't expect you to understand," Draco sneered before leaning down to kiss Harry firmly on the lips. "Hello, darling."
Harry laughed again as Draco pulled him into another passionate kiss.
Harry shrugs, and the nonchalant look on his face is only slightly forced. “It’s not like we live together. We do see each other a lot. We’ve become close friends.”
Seamus and Dean exchange concerned glances. "Yeah."
. He'd created that potion just for her. Beneath his prickly Slytherin exterior, Draco Malfoy was as kind and good a friend as they come.
She fixes him with a sharp, calculating look. "No. You
“Then maybe he deserves another chance. A chance to explain himself, at least.”
Harry leans back into the embrace, dropping his head onto Draco’s shoulder. “I think so. It’s just...a lot.”
"Ginny and I would never have worked, Ron. Even she can see that now. And while I do feel bad that I hurt her, I don't regret ending things when I did. We're both happier now, and I'm still the same person I've always been."
Draco leans back forcefully, tipping backwards on the sofa and pulling Harry down on top of him between his legs. Harry groans into the kiss, shifting his hips and lacing the fingers of one hand with Draco’s above his head. “
They crawled under the covers and Draco wrapped an arm around Harry, his chest pressed firmly against the other man's back. He sighed contentedly and buried his nose in that thick black hair, inhaling the tangy-sweet smell of Harry's shampoo.
When they were both fully dressed, Draco pulled something out of his jeans pocket. It was a minuscule vial of potion that immediately grew to the size of a small goblet in his hand. He uncorked it and held it out with a sympathetic expression. "Hermione made sure you'd be prepared for tonight."
"Mama!" Thomas threw himself at his mother. Draco let out a sigh of relief as he watched them; Nadine seemed relatively unharmed—just a few shallow cuts that Draco could heal easily.
“Well, it’s a very old and very small country, isn’t it?” He offered, rubbing the back of his neck in doubt.
Neither Draco nor Harry said anything. Draco was focusing too hard on trying not to throw up, while Harry just stood there, looking concerned. Longbottom gave Harry a firm pat on the back, while Ginny gave him a peck on the cheek as the pair headed out together. At the time, Draco was too drunk to notice. Even Lovegood had left, and the only ones left on the street were Harry, Draco, Blaise, Justin and Anthony. Eventually Justin and Anthony had left, while Draco sat on a bench, focusing hard on trying not to see double.
“Yes,” he replied, “but I refused. He will have a very difficult time finding anyone to fix it.”
Draco didn’t really know how to respond to that, so he opted for a brief, but friendly wave as he walked out the door. Before he exited the building however, he realized he desperately needed a moment to catch his breath. Finding a bench by the restrooms, he took a seat, placing the contract in his hand onto the seat next to him. Throughout the meeting, Draco’s nerves caused him to sweat profusely through his vest. He opted for black, as he normally did, and yet he could feel the sweat start to build up underneath his silky button-down and matching black vest. It almost made him want to take off his coat, but the Auror department was the last place he would ever dare to strip off his clothing.
The mood changed, and after that, neither of them could carry on the conversation. She knew better than to talk about him, knew how sensitive of a subject it was. Still, he couldn’t blame her. He even felt a bit of guilt seeing how quickly she tucked her tail between her legs, like a kicked puppy.
He clarified, “I mean, are you in a hurry to get home?”
Neither of them spoke for a moment, as they stared at their crazy friends with small smiles on their faces. It was Harry who directed Draco’s attention back to him when he spoke next.
“Like I said, I live in Muggle London. I have for several years now.” Draco replied, feeling tired of having to explain himself.
Robards hesitated, “I’m afraid there’s not much I can do for your father, since his last excursion to Azkaban. However, I can petition to shorten your family’s probation, once the case is closed.”
As always, thank you for reading my fic, and stay tuned for more! Love you all XOXO
“Have you kept up with the others much?” She asked, and for a moment he was confused. Up until recently, he hadn’t kept up with much of anyone.
“Enough!” He screamed. The volume and pitch of his voice, now shredded with rage, was terrifying, “You WILL marry a pure-blooded girl, this is not up for discussion!”
“So you fought in the war with the Aurors?” Blaise asked, eyes widened.
Draco felt his nerves start to go until Blaise put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. It didn’t do much to calm his anxiety, but he appreciated nonetheless.
“You really should fix that if you don’t want guests accidentally witnessing something that may scar them,” He looked around her flat for a chair to sit in and was genuinely surprised. It was bigger than his, that was for sure, although it was fairly obvious that she had just moved in as unpacked boxes still littered the living room.
Harry blinked at him, not really knowing what to say, and instead opted for another sip of his drink. Before long, Draco had joined the others, and eventually, so did Harry. For a short, ridiculous, drunken moment, they were all able to put aside their differences and just be human beings for once, and it felt
“I have to admit,” Blaise whispered, “I wasn’t expecting to go gallivanting through any dangerous dungeons today.”
Just looking at it left a sour taste in Draco’s mouth, but he chose to ignore it as he discarded the newspaper and moved towards the voice.
Harry blinked, turning to face Draco, his face suddenly baring no emotion other than acknowledgment of the man standing in front of him, “Sorry, I forgot who I was talking to for a moment. Just follow me this way.”
Blaise bowed like a house elf before his master, “After you, Auror Malfoy.”
"Draco!” Pansy practically screamed from the other room, “Are you seriously still in bed? You lazy sack of-“
As Draco entered the Manor once more, he hesitated to tell his mother the truth behind his departure.
Draco looked around, realizing they needed to leave, “We should get back to the others.”
I mean it’s not as if he was ashamed, he’s gotten over that long ago, but this was definitely
“No.” Draco didn’t think before the word tumbled out of his mouth and past his lips.
Draco nodded. He took hold of the binder as Robards stood from his desk, prompting Draco to do the same.
Something along those lines, he was sure.
As Blaise turned to walk back towards Draco’s fireplace, Draco felt the frustration inside him building. Before he thought it through, he felt the word ‘no’ escape past his lips.
“Like I said before,” Draco gave Blaise a pointed look to which the latter rolled his eyes, “coming here was pointless. My father is just trying to throw us off of his trail.”
They now stood in Parcs de la Pétrusse, overlooking the view of the Adolphe bridge and the Pétrusse Casemates. It was as Draco expected, a city built on the ruins of another, with Roman and medieval architecture still prevalent throughout the city, with a tiny bit of modernism sprinkled in there as well. Yet again, their journey was proved to be futile as Lucius left no indication he was ever there. Potter, Blaise and Draco scoured the city for at least an hour, galavanting through every museum they could find within walking distance to the park where he was spotted, and even then, nothing of significance was found.
Draco opened his mouth to speak but found an unforgiving silence that his vocal cords could not break. He trembled as the water droplets dripped off of his soaking wet body.
“I have to say Pans, you’ve changed quite a bit,” Blaise looked the woman up and down, with a smirk on his face, “In fact, you look like even more of a slag than before.”
“We just want to ask you a few questions,” Potter spoke up from behind him, though the vexed man stared only at Draco.
Draco shook his head fervently, “No parties, please. I don’t need to be called a traitor by everyone I’ve ever known, thank you very much.”
~~~~~
“Sébastien, could you tell us what Lucius sought you out for?” Blaise asked next, leaning against the other side of the wall, as the room was small enough for the four of them to take up most of the space.
She sat down across from him, noticing the way her long dark hair flowed in waves behind her back, “It’s water under the bridge now. Besides, I knew you were going through a lot.”
He thought that by eavesdropping on Harry and his friends that he would find answers, but now he’s been left with only more questions. Though he wanted to disbelieve the words he’s heard, it made far too much sense to be incorrect. Now he’s left with a question of his morality, and an iron-clad boot stepping on his already shattered heart. Is it better to join the Aurors in finding his father? Or is it better to stay blindly loyal to the man who wanted nothing to do with him? He stared up at the stars, hoping to find a semblance of peace when looking at them. His vision was blurry with tears, leaving him with a feeling of emptiness he knew all too well. Before he could draw any more attention to himself, he stepped into an alley and apparated himself home, where he could at least cry about his fucked up life in the privacy of his own home.
It felt good to be reckless. It felt good to enjoy time with his friends, who Draco could barely call friends, since he barely allowed himself to have relationships with anyone anymore. For a brief moment, he was able to forget his loneliness, no matter how hard it threatened to eat him alive every time he looked over at Potter, who seemed to be surrounded by love and companionship at every moment of the day.
Harry pushes Draco onto his back and takes his cock in hand, stroking fast and adding a twist at the end that he likes when he pulls himself off, and from the way Draco is arching his back to push harder into Harry's hand, he's a fan as well.
"It was brilliant, 'Mione! Even Kasper was convinced in the end. Thank you so much. Now we just have to wait and see if it worked. Either way though, I've had enough excitement for one lifetime."
"Thank you very much, Master Draco."
Harry pulled back, looking dazed and concerned, as Draco cupped his cheek with a palm. "Harry. I want—I want you to—"
Draco sighed and buried his nose in Harry's dark hair. "Alright, I promise."
"A surprise party?
," Harry glared at them. "Wake the others and check them over for injuries, then start preparing this lot for transport to the Ministry holding cells. Or did you think our Stunners would last all day?"
"That's great news!" Hermione said with a smile.
The blond gazed at him for a long moment. "Just the one dose?"
George Weasley’s face pales as he watches his friend twitch on the cobblestones. “We need to get him to Mungo’s.”
Potter’s eyes narrow at Draco over Teddy’s head before he turns back to the child in his arms. “Nothing is more important than you, Teddy,” he says firmly. “Nothing. Understand?”
“You didn’t deserve this. I never should have...I’m sorry.” Draco squeezes his eyes shut.
"No, it's okay. He should have told you, but he'll be fine. He'll wake up in a few minutes." Harry looked over at Ron. "What happened? Are you okay?"
. I was hoping you'd read something we haven't." He glanced hopefully at Hermione.

"Oh?"
He found his mother in the parlor, reading in her favorite chair by the window. She stood when he walked in, setting her book down and stepping toward him.
Jenkins stepped forward and took his hand. Another "pop," and the elf had Apparated them across the room, landing with Harry on the bed and himself standing at his bedside. The elf snapped his fingers and the covers wrapped themselves over Harry up to his chin.
Curly had disliked Malfoy immediately. his superior attitude and the accusations he'd leveled at them had immediately had put him on the defensive. But then, Curly had been unable to look away as Potter clung to him, and despite his coldness toward them, which now seemed pretty understandable, Malfoy had been incredibly tender with his fiancé.
“Ah, well that explains the bandage,” Harry jokes. “And the pain.”
"Not a chance in hell, Harry."
He has Paul, and Harry has...well, whoever Harry is sleeping with this week. There’s no room for Draco’s feelings here.
Harry was sitting at the table, a large, steaming mug cupped in his hands. He looked up and smiled, but his eyes were red. "Oh. Sorry Drake, did I wake you?"

“Much. Are you hungry?”
"Ah. You
She shoos him toward the door.

, I mean, it’s entirely possible that I—I mean it really might not have been him, but just in case—“
"Say Mama," Draco coached.
"Draco, wait. It's almost Noon. Can I take you to lunch?"
"I..." He sighed in resignation. "It's Potter, Mum. It's always been Potter."
“Gentlemen, thank you for coming. I want you both to know how much we enjoy having Edward here at our school, and there is no risk of suspension or expulsion today. This is only a first offense, so I assure you, as long as the behavior does not persist, everything will be fine.”
What was left of Draco’s sober mind forced him to look at himself in the mirror. He was not the same idiotic teenager that he was when he knew Harry. He was a grown man, and one who worked hard for the life he had. He wasn’t a slave to his father’s name anymore, and he shouldn’t feel ashamed when he
“I understand,” Draco responded, feeling slightly resigned to his father’s imminent fate, “What do you require of me?”
“I…I’m sorry, but I think you must be mistaken,” Draco felt himself saying the words out loud, without thinking.
Draco leaned over to take a closer look at the wand. He wondered if it still felt the same in his hand, if it still answered to him. Grabbing it, he felt nothing at first. Then, he felt something – a gust of wind, like a whispering of sorts in the depths of his mind. Perhaps it was nothing. Perhaps it was the wand choosing him once again. Regardless, it felt good to have it back in his hands.
“Draco, over here!” Pansy caught his attention, with a devilish grin on her face, “Look who came to join us.”
“No,” He lied effortlessly, drinking the last of his tea and standing up to stretch his legs.
Harry stood awkwardly in the corner, waiting for his co-worker to acknowledge him, “Malfoy, are you alright? You’ve been staring at your empty desk for over an hour now.”
Draco, looking like a manic hyena, grinned and said, “It would be my honor, Parkinson.”
The issue had a portrait of Potter along with some other less-important Auror, as it read in big, bold letters,
His words stung, but Draco understood. He was a Black by blood, just as much as he was a Malfoy. Draco couldn’t imagine this was comfortable for Harry much either, despite the latter inviting him over in the first place. A tidal wave of thoughts crashed and collided inside his mind; his mouth was far too behind to catch up. His tongue felt hot and tumefied in his mouth every time Potter spoke directly to him – so much so, that he chose not to speak at all, knowing his words would surely fail him.
She stuck her tongue out at the blonde-haired man, scooching her chair closer to Theodore’s to the point where she was basically sitting on his lap.
supposed to talk about, Harry Potter was damn near the top of that list.
It wasn’t until Mittens leaped onto his lap, as Draco shut his eyes so painfully tight, he thought he might see stars. His clenched fists, tugging at his hair painfully, automatically reached for the kitten’s fur. His breathing came slower now as he pet Mittens’ fur through shaky hands. This was often their routine. Mittens, while still a young cat, was wise and knew whenever Draco would get bad again. It was one of the main reasons Draco became so attached to the feline.
Draco could have died right there, utterly mortified by what he’d done. Part of him was still in disbelief that Potter was there at all, nonetheless somewhat
“Why would Lucius write that on this specific painting?” Harry looked around to see if there were anymore magical writings, but no, just the one.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You don’t seem to be enjoying yourself much, though,” Anthony pointed out, staring at Draco’s bare forearms as they leaned against the railing.
“Isn’t that the truth,” Anthony clinked their glasses together at that, bringing Blaise and Justin’s attention back to them.
“What are you doing here?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, “This is Pansy we’re talking about, the woman has no shame.”
“No, and I have no intention of being anything other than her friend.” His tone was biting, and for good reason.
“And you know this because...you’re an Auror now?” Her voice cracked at the word.
“So, you’re taking the job, right?” Pansy inquired in between sips of her martini.
“Ah, here it is.” Harry brought out an Ollivander’s wand box – one he must have gotten recently from the dust, or lack thereof.
With that, the trio made their move to exit the room when Sébastien peeked his head out of the door, “Good luck,
“Does it ever stop?”
“I do understand,” he replied, feeling his heart bang against his ribcage, “and that’s why it has to be me that stops him. Not them.”
Draco watched her walk away until his attention had shifted when Anthony’s hands started to roam from his shoulders to his lower back. Normally, he wouldn’t have complained, and possibly even taken it a step further, but since they were in front of Potter, Draco couldn’t help but feel a bit odd about it.
“Wait!” He started for the door, but Harry’s voice stopped him. “You’re leaving just like that? Without saying a word?”
“Pans, if you were a bloke,” Draco slurred, not realizing how loud he was being, “I would let you take me home and fuck me.”
From the angle he stood at, Draco’s dark mark was visible enough for Anthony to see the head of the snake poking out from his rolled-up sleeves. Noticing this, Draco shyly rolled his sleeves down, embarrassed and ashamed at the look of surprise on Anthony’s face. He supposed he should have suspected a reaction like that from him. He was, of course, a part of Potter’s entourage.
“Makes sense as to why he’s traveled to various cities to find someone to fix it.” Potter offered, sharing a knowing glance with Blaise as Draco continued to question Sébastien.
He chuckled, “I haven’t seen Blaise piss drunk in ages. I wonder if he still acts like a prat every time he drinks, or if he’s finally grown out of it.”
The Auror stretched his hand out, as they exchanged a firm handshake, “You as well, Mr. Malfoy.”
He sat with his elbows resting on his knees and his hands tangled in his hair.
“Draco!” Narcissa met him at the door this time, still dressed in her loungewear - a long, black gown with intricate lacing on the sleeves to make it look like snake scales. How very fitting for a Malfoy, Draco thought to himself.
Draco couldn’t find it in him to laugh, or even smile at that remark.
Draco found himself drawn to the portrait - De val van Ixion - whatever that meant. It portrayed a man falling to a fiery death, wielding a face of terror as Hell burned all around him.
Potter shrugged, “Just barely. I picked up a book this morning after hearing about our new assignment.”
Blaise had laughed as if it was the funniest insult he had ever heard. Had Draco been sober, he would have come up with a humiliating comeback to wipe that smug look off the Weasel’s face. Unfortunately, Ronald was not the only one who was incredibly plastered, as most people around him started laughing at the incredibly stupid insult. He found that he couldn’t contain his laughter either and bellowed alongside with Blaise, mostly for the fact that Zabini looked like he was about to rupture an artery from how hard he was laughing.
There were very few precious moments throughout his life when Draco found himself unable to say anything. He was always quick to the punch – good with his words. This time, however, Draco felt that if he were to say anything, he would surely fumble, so he opted to stay silent, waiting for the moment his mouth could open again.
, get that wand out of my face!” Pansy shrieked as the tip of his wand came within an inch of her nose.
Harry turned to him, replying, “You go on ahead, I’ll take a long lunch. I doubt Robards would mind.”
Blaise looked to be simultaneously in a state of shock and glee, “Robards told me the news this morning. I can’t believe you’ve actually accepted the job.”
“No?” Lucius repeated while his eyes narrowed into slits.
despite his colorful past, as Anthony tactfully put it. In school, Draco liked being the center of attention. He liked being the leader of a group, and he liked having people look up to him. Now? In the present? Draco couldn’t hate the attention more.
He hated remembering. Yet, every time he tried to forget, he relived it in his dreams. As time passed and the weeks turned into months, Draco realized he couldn’t live without his mother in his life, and so he did his best to visit every so often. Not soon after his departure from the Manor, Lucius left on his own as well to “save their family”, never staying in one place for too long before moving to some other location, likely staying at one of their many estates abroad.
“Theodore darling, be a dear and buy me a drink,” she said before planting a big wet kiss on his cheek.
That night he packed everything of value he had on him, all of his clothes and personal belongings and apparated somewhere they would never find him. In Muggle London, he was invisible. Two weeks had passed before he found a permanent place to lay his head in Chiswick, the flat he still calls his home.
After knocking on the door and being escorted to his mother’s parlour, as per the usual routine, he was surprised to see she was already there waiting for him.
As they sat in silence, it bitterly reminded Draco how once, long ago, he would have done anything for his parents’ approval. And then Lucius allowed the Dark Lord into their home, and all of a sudden, Draco didn’t see much of a reason to want to be like him anymore.
Before he could exit, Draco called out, “Wait!”
Behind where Draco was sitting, he could hear the soft laughter of Pansy and Millicent, but he couldn’t pay much attention because Draco couldn’t get a good look, but he could’ve
Robards was the last to enter, as he moved swiftly into the room just a moment after Draco and Blaise did.
His theory was proved correct when he finally reached the terrace to find Potter and his crew leaning against the railing, overlooking the streets with drinks in their hands. They hadn’t spotted him yet, but Draco felt his heartbeat slamming against his chest all the same. Had he not been in such a crowded place teeming with Muggles, he would have cast a disillusionment charm on himself to seem more inconspicuous. Luckily, the place was crowded with enough Muggles that he blended in with the crowd well enough. When he reached the opposite end of the bar in which Potter and his friends stood, he ordered a Guinness, notably facing away from the group. When his beer was finally handed to him, he muttered a single word spell, which muted nearly everything around him except for the voices of Potter and his friends.
“Draco,” Blaise’s voice called out from behind him. When Draco turned to face his intruder, he was surprised to find Blaise still wearing his pajamas as well, a Slytherin green pajama set that he’d clearly never gotten rid of from their school days.
“You should’ve seen what I was like in sixth year,” Draco realized he was falling out of his chair, and leaned on Anthony for support, “especially in the Slytherin dormitories.”
“As you can see in the reports, we were only able to get as far as Antwerp before the trail went cold. My partner and I have spoken to locals in the area though none saw anyone meeting the perpetrator’s description.” Weasley kept his voice lowered, but there was only so much he could do to keep Malfoy from overhearing this information while he remained in the same room as him.
“No, don’t-” Anthony placed a hand on his arm to halt his action, startling Draco with his touch, “You don't have to. This is your home.”
“Well, Crabbe is dead, Goyle has fallen off the face of the Earth, Blaise is always busy with work, Millicent barely talks to anybody, and I haven’t kept in contact with Theodore much.”
“I, uh, polished it for you, before you came. I mean, I’ve had it a while, I just knew I would see you again at some point, so…” Harry stammered, running a hand through his untamed hair, his rounded glasses slowly sliding down his nose until he pushed them back up again. If Draco didn’t know any better, he would’ve said Harry was downright bashful. But sadly, he did know better.
After so many years running from Aurors, Draco couldn’t possibly imagine himself being employed as one. And yet, the thought of clearing his name, and helping his family get their wealth back was too tempting to bear. Had he been the same person he was a few years ago, he would have jumped at the chance. He would have done anything for his family. Now? Even if he does love his family, is he willing to give up his freedom for them? After everything that had happened in the past several years, the answer was not so clear.
“You should have warned me about it. The very last thing I wanted today was to have to entertain people at my flat,” Draco quieted down as he realized all eyes were on him now. He was angry, of course, but he didn’t want to yell at Pansy for trying to make him happy. Even if it was totally and completely misguided.
His bedroom door slammed open and he could hear Mittens’ bell jingling like mad as he ran as far away from the insane woman in Draco’s doorway.
Draco repeated, crossing his arms across his chest, “No, I won’t be going.”
“When Pansy reached out to us about throwing you a surprise party, I had a feeling you would react poorly,” Harry smirked, pressing his wire-framed glasses back up his nose.
“I will.”
Blaise patted him on the back then, grinning wildly, “Always knew you’d be useful.”
The fact of the matter was that he had sworn to himself, many years ago, that had he ever come across Harry again, he would look the other way. It had been too long, too
Draco sneered, calling out rather loudly, “What is it, Potter? You got a problem with faggots?”
Despite it all, Draco felt reassured. At least he wasn’t the only one.
Robards smiled at him then, a full smile that conveyed the satisfaction of adding a new hire onto the case, “Fantastic! Now I’ll just hand you these.”
He followed her, feeling the walls begin to shrink around him as the familiar black walls with paintings adorned of previous Malfoys and Blacks taunted him. He hated coming home.
“I forgot what it looked like,” Draco spoke softly, running the edge of his fingers along the edge of the wand.
However, it wasn’t enough for Draco to act with forethought. Grabbing his wand, which had now fallen beneath the dining room table upon opening the letter, he cast a quick
Draco shook his head, “No, did you?”
With that, the Head Auror rose and walked out of the door as swiftly as he came in. It was incredible how time efficient the man was, never wasting a moment on mindless chatter, just hard facts. As Head Auror, he must be quite busy, as busy as he imagined Potter would be when he eventually took his place. The thought soured Draco’s mood, especially considering if he were to stay positioned as an Auror, he would likely have to refer to Potter as his boss.
The man had a surly expression as he eyed Draco up and down before leading him down the hallway. He looked unfamiliar to Draco, but from his attire, Draco could tell he was an Auror, or at least a lackey for the Aurors, since he didn’t hold that same holier-than-thou attitude that most had – though it wasn’t for a lack of effort. As the lackey, whom Draco secretly nicknamed in his head, led him through a series of doorways, he eventually led him to an office of some sorts – one he had not been in before.

The lights were flickered on as soon as he entered and he suddenly recognized the faces of several people inside his flat. Blaise, Potter, Irma, and Longbottom sat at his dining table while Millicent, Theodore Nott, and a few other familiar faces packed themselves to the side of the door, bursting out a “Surprise!” as soon as he’d taken notice of them.

Harry broke eye contact and hummed, as he looked over at the others who had now taken over the dance floor. Anthony too, called over by Justin and Blaise, had gone to dance, leaving Harry and Draco alone at the table.

, although the sender’s name was mysteriously not written on there.
“Now I see why you wanted to get away from all of us,” Pansy came to Draco’s side, slinging an arm over his shoulders, while Millicent and Theodore laughed at his pained expression.
Millicent reached around the table to playfully slap Theodore on the arm, “You two are just as naughty as you were in school.”
, of course. The real reason Harry was there inside his room.
Draco let out a slow breath, afraid that his beating hard would betray him by pounding loudly enough that the Head Auror would hear it.
“Don’t be stupid, Draco. You’re going.” With that, Blaise entered the fireplace and Floo’d himself out of Draco’s flat, leaving him standing there, huffing with anger.
“Enjoying the party?” Draco smirked, chugging the last of his drink before setting it aside. Leaning his forearms against the railing he looked at the Muggles walking the streets, unassuming and unaware that a dozen or more wizards were partying just above them.
He sighed, knowing that was as close to an apology as he would ever get from her. He muttered an ‘ok’, and without another glance, walked outside and apparated home. It was foolish of him to hope for more and yet he always did. Of course, Draco realized over the years that he’d been a fool about many things. What’s another foolish hope to add to the list of his many, many faults?
“-go dancing? I never thought I’d see the day!” Granger exclaimed, sounding like she had already had one too many.
Pansy looked like she could melt from how adorable his story was. The truth of the matter was, it wasn’t a sweet story at all. When Draco found that cat, it was in the back of an alley of a Muggle bar, where Draco sat, drunk out of his mind, and having one of the worst meltdowns since the war ended. He had just moved out of the manor. He had just told his family the truth, and his father, the man who he looked up to his whole life, refused to speak to him. He remembered flashes of the war – his hands shook, just as they had when pointing his wand at Dumbledore. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw it. Then, he heard a soft purr as Mittens approached him. He was a runt, small and feeble, and it was clear that he was just a kitten, but nonetheless, he fearlessly approached Draco and soon enough, was able to snap him out of his flashback.
Draco stood in his black silk robe, sipping on a glass of ice-cold water when the noise from the Floo sent his glass flying through the air and leaving water droplets all over his window. The glass nearly shattered upon contact with the hardwood floors, but Draco had caught it at the very last second.
There it was. The overwhelming truth, that isn’t so overwhelming for someone who already knew. It was no secret to Draco that the Malfoy family had a Time-Turner in their possession. It was his father’s, so he never got the chance to use it himself. The fact that they hired him onto this case wasn’t surprising at all, now that he understood the real reasoning behind it. Even so, he couldn’t help but feel a bit cheated. Not only was he being used as a pawn in the Ministry’s game of cat and mouse between them and his father, but now he was to undermine his entire family legacy just to arrest his father and capture the Time-Turner. Yet, the depressing truth was that even if he didn’t take the job, they would likely capture him anyways, letting the Malfoy name forever rot in Azkaban with his father. This way, however, Draco could at least pass on their legacy in less devastating ways.
Draco leaned over the bathroom sink, breathing heavily as he stared at himself in the mirror. The familiarity of it all made the bile in the back of his throat rise, but what was left of the rational part of his mind refused to let Draco make a fool of himself now – especially not when Harry
A moment of silence passed until Draco began to breathe deeply out through his mouth and in through his nose until his heart rate relaxed a bit.
“How can you defend him? After all this time, knowing everything that he’s done...and you still defend him?”
"You’re a former Death Eater,” the man stated simply, allowing Draco to give into the dread that filled his stomach, “Oh, no need to give me that look. I wouldn’t send you a letter of employment if I wanted you arrested.”
Narcissa said nothing but when they met each other’s gaze, Draco felt an ache in his chest, an ache for all that was lost.
“Draco?”
Granger chuckled, “Disciplined or disillusioned, now that the Death Eaters are gone?”
Draco ran his fingers through his hair, exasperated by the conversation and the rush of adrenaline pumping through his blood with the alcohol sloshing around in his stomach.
“When are we to depart for Rotterdam?” He asked, though his voice shook in the beginning. It was hard to notice to the untrained ear as he coughed through it, but to Draco, it was clear as day.
an understatement. He said nothing though, sipping his overpriced cappuccino silently.
Draco cleared his throat and gave them a curt nod, trying his best to seem as unaffected by the unexpected presence as possible, “Potter, Weasley. What brings you here?”
“Some,” Robards said, placing the Time-Turner back in its case, “but not all. During the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, we lost most of our collection of Time-Turners. Luckily, we were able to confiscate one from our latest arrest of Antonin Dolohov. After questioning him, we found that he had stolen one from the Department of Mysteries prior to his arrest and sent it through a portkey to a Death Eater lair located in Suffolk. I had a small team of Aurors take care of it recently.”
Draco didn’t have an answer, and instead opted for silence. It’s true, he and Blaise hadn’t exactly been close for the majority of the years that they’ve known each other, but he knew he had good intentions.
,” Draco muttered, handling his wand below his belt so as not to raise suspicion of any muggles.
Draco didn’t know what to say to that. He felt his cheeks begin to flush as a sharp knock on the door brought his attention back to the reality of the situation.
Blaise and Potter watched in awe as the rocks crumbled and exposed the floor beneath the well. That, they were not expecting.
The thought sent echoes to his mind and throughout his body, causing shockwaves to sweep through his spine, as he began to shake uncontrollably. He breathed in and out, panting now, as his thoughts begun to race, and his mouth went dry. As he heaved, his shaky hands reached for his chest, and Draco
“A while,” Draco confessed, unwittingly.
Draco snorted, slurring just as well “Have you met the man? He’s –
Draco shrugged, “I don’t mind. I’ve got nothing else to do.”
Draco raised an eyebrow at him, but he was impressed, “What is the myth?”
He turned to the others to find that most of them were slack jawed. Except for Potter, who stared at him was such intensity, he thought he might pass out. Or maybe that was the alcohol. Draco really couldn’t tell.
He hoped, foolishly, that it would be enough to burn his fears, his desires, and all awful memories of the boy who lived. As he stared into the flames, he almost wanted to believe it would.
It was Pansy, of course, who poured them down his throat, one by one from Draco’s liquor cabinet - which was soon to be emptied by the rate things were going thus far. An hour or so had passed, and the anger he felt towards his longtime friend had dulled to the point of total apathy when he realized how much fun everyone else was having. His Slytherin friends mostly kept to themselves but were friendly enough to the others. Harry had found himself at the center of attention, as per usual, telling stories of his exploits on previous cases working under Robards. Blaise, Irma and Longbottom listened intently, chuckling at his gregarious attitude, and even Draco found it difficult to take his eyes off of the man as he told his tales in exaggerated detail. A part of him didn’t know if it was from the alcohol or from something else entirely. Perhaps it was a bit of both, but he was glad that the attention had finally shifted from awkward congratulations to adventurous tales. He wasn’t sure how much recognition he could possibly handle, given the circumstances.
"Not as good as—"
He picked up his wand and cast a Tempus Charm.
Draco had been startled, but he took the proffered hand and smiled, forcing himself to sound as nonchalant as possible. "With
Harry grins. “Well, you know me…
Harry rolls his eyes. "They do
The Aurors flushed in unison and jumped to action at the order.
"I was having a cathartic experience," Draco said vaguely, waving a hand. "There may have been screaming."
"He threatened you," I say, losing control of my stupid fucking mouth again.
Nadine sat down beside him and picked up a train, shooting him a sly smile. "You bonded with your boyfriend last night."
Like Draco's had earlier, Harry's stomach answered for him by growling loudly. An attractive blush washed over his cheeks as he gave her an embarrassed smile. "I'm starving. Thanks! That would be fantastic, but...could we all eat in here tonight? I'd like to talk to you lot a bit more, if that's alright, but I don't think I can make it downstairs in my current state."
Draco shrugs. “It was a little funny. His face when you blocked his Hex without your wand, I mean. I thought he was going to wet himself.”
"Er, alright." Potter shrugs and goes silent.
Stepping up next to Harry, he sat down cross-legged beside him and gently placed a hand on the other man's knee. "This okay?"
“That doesn’t seem like the kind of relationship that would make you…” Draco finishes the sentence nervously as Harry spins around and stands up, his eyes flashing dangerously. “...happy.”
"Harry?"
"You know what I want," Draco laughed,
They’re exactly the words I’ve longed to hear, but it’s too late. He’s
"Harry, please," Draco gasped. "Don't go."
"Yeah." Harry tossed the cane on the floor. "I just need to..." He shifted towards the bed and tugged Draco on top of him as they fell over in a tangle of limbs. Harry grinned wickedly, snaking his arms around Draco's waist. "Lie down."
worse.
Harry had tucked him under the covers and begun stripping out of his Auror robes. "No, I should have told you. It's just hard to talk about. It's been so many years, sometimes I feel like I should be fine, like it shouldn't hurt anymore."
Harry grins and nods. “You got it. I’ll be right back. Do you want anything, Draco?”
"I'm sorry."
He turns to look up at Draco, who is staring down at him in wonder, and then smiling softly and running a finger over his lightning bolt scar. Without thinking, Harry sits up to kiss him, and their friends whoop and cheer in response.
“Okay.”
Draco loses it when Harry touches him. He only has to pump his cock a few times, and then Draco is arching his back and coming, blood rushing in his ears and pleasure coursing through his veins.

Lucky for me, Harry seems to feel the same way. He reluctantly drags his mouth away in an attempt to regain some control, pressing our foreheads together and panting softly as he looks into my eyes. "Come back to mine?" He asks, looking hopeful and suddenly a little shy.
"Circe, you're beautiful, Drake. I want you so much."
Afterward, they lay side-by-side on their backs, hands intertwined between them.
"I know," Harry drops to one knee and pulls him into a tight hug. "I'm sorry, kid. Something came up. I'll see you next week though, alright?"
Ron groaned and shoved him again. "Don't bring that up. This is the first night off I've had in ages! It's bloody exhausting!"

Harry groaned as he slowly regained consciousness. His head was spinning. The searing pain nearly made him black out again.
Draco leaned in for another kiss as Harry set his hands on his waist and pulled him flush against him. "Me too."
I mean, you're still—" Mathias indicated with his hand at Harry's body, "attractive and all. But I don't feel that magnetic pull I felt yesterday. Like I'd go stark raving mad if I didn't get you into my bed."
“I don’t know. He got a letter yesterday. Muggle Post. We
Hermione ended the call and beckoned a rather drawn and pale-looking Draco into the large fireplace.
A few weeks later, all communication with Draco had been cut off, and Harry had been a different person from that point forward, his fear and anger at the situation eating at him from the inside out.
As they ate in the kitchen, Harry asked, "who did you write to?"
, Harry. And wounds heal, with time. They don't change who you are."
The woman pulled the blanket down and removed the bandages that covered Harry's left leg from the middle of his thigh to just above his ankle. The open wounds had been healed, but much like the bite mark on his shoulder, the internal damage was still clearly visible.
"You've been unbelievably sweet these past few days," Draco sighs, cupping Harry's cheek.
"So have I." He cut her off, his voice teeming with bitterness. "Have you gotten to the bit about

"Stay with me. I...I can't risk hurting you, even if it was by accident. I couldn't live with myself if I...please. Promise me. Next time you'll just go home. Please. I'll be okay."
"'S nice to be home."

Draco sighed. "I'm sorry. How did it go before that?"

"I'm telling your Healer about this," Draco muttered mutinously a few minutes later, suppressing another low moan as Harry kissed him and rolled his hips against him.
Harry strode across the room to her, while Draco hesitated in the doorway.
He flushed crimson, a horrified expression on his face as he stared at her in shock. "Mum!
"See you later, Harry."
Harry stares blankly at him, nonplussed. "What on earth are you talking about?"

Draco closed the distance between them and reached out, first touching Harry's arm, recoiling, and then brushing his fingers over his forehead.
"I don't know how you do that," Harry breathed against his ear, "you're incredible."
"No." He pushes Harry away and walks to the door. "Ask one of your

"Why haven't I seen you in so long?" Teddy asked, frowning. "You didn't come to my birthday."
He paused, his hand on the doorknob.
Draco decided not to push it and changed the subject. "So, what are you having? Tea?"
"Please!" Another piercing scream.
," Harry murmured, breaking the kiss to mouth at his neck, hands tugging his neatly-tucked shirttails loose and sliding over the bare skin of his back and slotting a leg between Draco's in a way that had them both moaning lowly.
“I’m just worried about him,” Draco tells Paul later, over dinner. “People think he’s some indomitable force because he’s, you know, Harry Potter, and maybe to a degree he is, but he’s still...human. He still gets burnt out and tired, and I know he’ll take good care of Teddy, he always does, but he’s not always the best at taking care of
He flops onto the sofa as soon as Brandon leaves, in a manner that would have earned him a thorough scolding at the Manor when he was a child, and covers his face with his hands.
It was only a few minutes before Harry began to stir.
Harry swallows hard and sets down his teacup on the side table before pulling Draco into a hug.
. I was wondering when he'd show back up."
. Draco could scarcely believe it.
He settled Draco under it on the sofa, then busied himself in the kitchen making an enormous cup of hot cocoa. Mug in hand, he made his way back to the sitting room. Draco accepted it gratefully, immediately putting the cup to his lips and taking a sip.
"What's Davis saying?"
"Yes, well," Draco conceded. "Maybe a
He held out a hand, and she shook it, eyes brightening. "Is it true you're..."
Draco nodded. "Of course. I came directly here from Wolf's Hollow. Erm, that's the name of the house."
"Mmhm."
" Draco groaned as Harry pressed him down into the mattress. "What do you want, darling?"
"Like hell he didn't!"
Harry nods and leans in. “Yeah.”
Harry tenses beside him and moves so quickly Draco doesn’t understand what’s happening until the jet of electric blue light strikes Harry in the back, where Draco had been standing seconds earlier. Draco watches in horror as Harry’s eyes widen and his knees start to buckle.
"As I've told you," Draco was saying, "you'll have to speak to Harry. But my understanding is that disputes between magical creatures are not to be interfered with by wizards. I'm not sure I understand why you're here."
"Thanks, love."
Harry just chuckles softly. “So, do you—?”

Harry sits up to kiss him again to cover his embarrassment at the truth behind Draco's words. "Stop that. You know I only want you," he murmurs against Draco's lips before lying back down.

"No." Harry swiped his thumbs over Draco's cheekbones, wiping the tears away. "
"He did, but not before..." Her eyes filled up with tears again.
"Don't tempt me," Ron groans. "I might actually do it."
"But you love me anyway," Draco laughs, kissing and biting along his jaw.
“Next time,” he flies back up to pass the ball back to Teddy, “keep your eyes focused on the right hoop until the

let Malfoy back to see his fiancé this instant, or I'll arrest you and toss you in Azkaban for interfering in werewolf business, which is in direct violation of Code Seven paragraph Three of the Inter-Species Treaty of 1698.
Harry agreed to let her ask around and see what she could learn from her colleagues.

Ginny looks shocked. “You’re joking. I’m going to

Harry jumps. “Draco! When did you get here? It’s not—wait, what time is it?”
"Bye, Draco!" Hermione called before giving Ron a quick kiss goodbye.
. In a
As they ate and began talking, the awkward tension began to ease as they fell into familiar patterns of discussion and debate. After they set the food aside and began to listen to the Quidditch match, sitting facing each other on the sofa, they never once stopped talking.
Teddy fixes Harry with a stubborn glare that could rival Harry's own. "No. I want to know what's going on."
"Harry?"
“Yeah, be right there!”
Three weeks later, Draco is more than ready to check himself into the Janus Thickley Ward at St. Mungo’s. When Teddy begs to go to Florean Fortescue’s for ice cream before dinner, yet another potential tantrum visibly brewing, Draco simply doesn't have a shred of resistance left. He gives in, knowing he’ll regret it later but too tired to face another battle.
The underground room was enormous. There were at least thirty cells with barred doors and solid walls between them. The center of the room was a large circle. The door to the stairs was also barred.
Nadine, no matter what happens to me. You and Thomas deserve to be free, even if I can't beat Lorcan. You can stay with Draco for a little while until all of the dust settles. I've been updating my Will with Gringotts this week and you and Thomas will be taken care of, I promise."
He lifted his head to look at her for a second, then dropped it back onto Harry's pillow.
"Do you think you might be up to try standing tomorrow?"
Harry continued to his bedroom, stripping down to his underwear and leaving clothes on the floor as he went. He crawled under the covers and buried his face in the pillow.
Lorcan sneered. "So, our new super-powerful Alpha brought a Death Eater bodyguard with him. That's cute. Couldn't fend for himself, then?"
"Fine. But I'm here." Harry says. "You don't have to talk to me, or tell me who did it, but if you want to talk... I'm here."
He turns us to Apparate on the spot, and we whirl away to an unfamiliar flat. Well, unfamiliar in that I've never been there before, but the thrum of Harry's magic powering the Wards, the pot of broomstick polish on the kitchen table, the empty box of takeaway curry on the counter, the crimson Auror robes strewn over the back of a kitchen chair, the copy of Quidditch Quarterly tossed haphazardly on the sofa, it's all so
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Harry teases, his eyes widening innocently, “did you want me to contradict you? Rewrite history for you a little bit?”

Draco smiled back before turning to follow the Healer. "Of course. Thanks, Weasley."

very well know."
There was a strange tension in the house when Harry walked in the door. "Draco?"
"If I had used my Veela heritage on you that day in Diagon Alley, when we ran into each other again, to make you want me. I would never have done it on purpose, but I wondered if maybe, accidentally—"
“Sorry,” Harry’s nose crinkles in a wince. “Sorry. I, er, panicked. Stupid of me, I know. I just…” Harry steps closer, reaches out to brush his thumb over Draco’s cheek, his hand shaking. “Have you ever wanted something so badly, wanted it so much you thought the wanting might just kill you, and then it’s right there, close enough to touch, and you realize you might actually get it, but it’s just...too good, too perfect, to be real?” Draco nods slowly. “You...you’re like that to me.”
"I will," Harry replied, giving him a grateful smile before turning to leave. "See you."
"Traitor," Draco growled, glaring at his back as he walked away. "I'll bring something
Draco's eyes widened. "Harry, that's..." He smiled so broadly his cheeks hurt from the strain. "I'd love that. Thank you."
Hangover potion, most likely. Draco didn’t hesitate to rip the cork out and swallow it in one go. Instant relief swept through his body, and he finally felt well enough to sit up on the bed to look at his intruder.
“Pansy was just telling me about your job. You work for the Ministry? I’m surprised we hadn’t run into each other sooner.” Draco was too drunk to tell, but it almost looked like he shifted his chair closer, while Pansy turned around to chat with Millicent.
The Malfoys were stunned by the revelation. Lucius looked as if he would keel over right then and there, while Narcissa just stared, mouth agape.
"So how was it?” Pansy interrupted his thoughts.
“My father, Lucius? He was here?” Draco asked, taking a look at the room behind him.
When he came out to his mother, he was surprised to find that she didn’t care much, but his
“Frankly, I found it pretty hilarious, especially that licentious kiss we’d shared.”
“Is something on your mind, dear?” She stared expectantly at him with concern.
“Honestly, if you weren’t so unbelievably homosexual, I would have killed you on the spot.” Her tone caused Draco to laugh even harder until Pansy finally found a tight fitting top that was low enough to imply ‘street-walker’ and led him out of the room.
the Malfoy way. Even still, his father barely talked to him as it was, so nothing really changed much. Perhaps it was for the best, Draco thought, that their relationship could never go back to the way it was.
Draco blinked at him, feeling the breath he’d been holding in leave his body, “You’ve never called me that before.”
Potter walked alongside him until they reached the entrance of the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen. He raised an eyebrow at him, as if to ask if they should enter. Draco gave him a  curt nod before following the latter inside. Luckily, the Auror department had an extensive collection of polyjuice and other Muggle disguises so they didn’t stick out like sore thumbs while investigating, instead looking like regular policemen.
“Yes, he brought it here for me to examine, but it is very unstable. I’m afraid one wrong use could be enough to punch a hole through the very fabric of time itself.” The old man hung his head, shaking it at the floor in disgust.
They entered the shady man’s room, which seemed to be an old prison cell, fashioned into a small living space, complete with magical artefacts of all kinds - many of which were illegal. Draco tried not to stare in awe at the man’s impressive collection, taking note of the staring glass eye. He wondered if it was the same one sold at Borgin and Burkes forever ago.
They sat at a table in the corner, meant for larger parties. The group chatted amongst themselves, discussing work and such. Potter and Weasley sat next to each other, both across from Potter and Blaise. Since he’d seen the red-haired weasel, he made it a point to avoid eye contact altogether. When the waitress came, Draco and the rest of them ordered tapas and sangria for the lot of them.
Despite the fact that the world around him was spinning, Draco couldn’t help but focus deeply on the man’s appearance. It
“No, I went to Beauxbatons. Much more prestigious than Hogwarts anyway. Less Death Eaters too.” Irma replied in a playful manner, but the sentiment was lost upon the group. Everyone else at the table had a downcast expression after it was said.
“Brussels, is it? I thought he was in Switzerland.”

The pleasant feeling in his stomach dipped at the question. He hadn’t told her yet and now he has to tell her in a Muggle coffee shop? After not seeing her for three years?
Draco waggled his eyebrows at Potter, not particularly meaning it in a suggestive way, but more to get a reaction out of the man.
Draco inhaled sharply, eyes widened as Anthony stepped closer to him. His eyes were glued onto his, highlighting the fact that both men were headed towards inebriation, with Draco being the soberer of the two. Even so, Draco didn’t know what to say when Anthony came within a few inches of him, watching carefully as he spoke softly between the two of them.
“Thanks for that, Pans,” Draco rubbed his face, still feeling slightly groggy, “but why are you here?”
“Yes, it’s actually just down the block from here. I’m having a bit of trouble trying to set up a Floo address there, but hopefully it should be done soon,” She paused, “Perhaps you can come to visit me then.”
“You never responded to my letter,” Harry looked up, now staring straight at him, “Did you ever receive it?”

He should have been used to it by now, really. Panic attacks were not new to him. There were many nights when he would wake up with the same sensations – barely coming to, with the growing numbness of his fingers giving him warning of what was to come. And yet, each and every time, it took him by surprise.
On nights like this when Draco felt the liquid courage sloshing around in his stomach, he loved to take walks. Very seldom in his life was he ever allowed to leave the grounds of the Manor, even for midnight strolls like this. Living on his own, he took advantage of the freedom that came with being able to go anywhere he wanted and do anything he wanted. Walking the streets at night when no one but the other drunk, lonely souls roamed up and down the pavement soon became another one of his creature comforts. Sometimes, he’d roam for hours, basking in the mundaneness of the existence of Muggle life, until exhaustion brought him back home. He envied them sometimes – he had lived through a war that they will never learn about, never hear about, never know about. He watched as they walked their dogs and their children with nary a frown or complaint and wondered what it was about the simplicity of their lives that made them so content. Perhaps that’s why he too yearned for that contentment in moving to a Muggle neighborhood. Nevertheless, he tried and failed to understand their behavior often. Only on nights like this, when he witnessed an inebriated man falling over under a streetlight, or a homeless woman screeching to herself in an alleyway that he truly began to empathize with them. They may be different from him fundamentally, but their madness is the same. It was comforting to him to know that he wasn’t the only fucked up one in the universe, with or without magic being involved.
“So, are you feeling better about the situation now?” Weasley asked, swinging an arm around Harry’s shoulders as if to cheer him up.
“What’s your name?” Potter asked, taking a seat in one of the wooden chairs against the wall.
he was. It was the first time in a long time that he allowed these thoughts to creep in - when days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months, and he lived alone, unfeeling and uncaring about the world. Despite the fact that he was in a room filled with people, he felt the loneliness seep into him until he forced the drink in his hand to drown out the thoughts.
It took a moment for Draco to adjust his eyes; He simply couldn’t believe what was happening. Of course, upon realizing there was no threat, he put his wand away immediately. Still, seeing all these people in his flat didn’t help him to feel at ease in the slightest.
“In all our years at Hogwarts, I’ve never seen you this plastered, Malfoy,” Harry smiled at him in a way that was either genuine, or genuinely making fun of him, he couldn’t decide.
“I – uh, well no-,” Harry stammered, his face burning bright red.
Blaise opened his mouth to speak but Irma spoke first, “I imagine the two of you have quite a history then.”
Potter led the way out to where the rest of the group was. Irma, Blaise, Neville and Ron had decided to join them as well. He already dreaded how this evening would go, but now that Draco’s been forced to work together with said people, he had to learn how to play nice.
Harry nodded in acknowledgment but didn’t say much. Instead, he took a large swig of whatever dark drink was in his hand, and Draco was slightly impressed by the giant gulp he took.
“Yes, well…” He trailed off, not really knowing what to say at that. He saw Longbottom and Potter’s face and knew well that they were as uncomfortable as he was.
“Who do you think you are, Potter,” Draco pointed a finger at him that was a little bit too close to his face, “telling me what to do? I’m a grown man.”
Draco stayed silent, gritting his teeth together in an effort to bite his tongue.
Robards face was as cold as ice as he spoke, furrowing his brows as he expressed disdain towards Draco’s father, “We need you on the case, nobody in our ranks has the knowledge you do on an artefact as powerful as this. If what we’ve found in our reports is true, Lucius may be trying to use it to bring the Dark Lord back.”
“Hey,” Granger pointed in Draco’s direction, “doesn’t that Muggle over there sorta look like him?”
Draco changed the subject, “So, you went home with Theodore, huh?”
Harry opened his mouth, but Ron, utterly sloshed, interrupted and spat at Draco, “What would you know about being an Auror, ferret?”
Draco shuddered at the thought.
“Not a funny one,” Longbottom muttered under his breath.
She motioned between Harry and Draco who sat directly across from each other. Their eyes met and for a moment, Draco thought he saw a glint of hurt and sadness in them. He tried not to think about it as he looked directly down at his feet.
Draco ignored him and instead pointed his wand at the rocks and chanted,
“Do you not realize how amazing of an opportunity this is, Draco?” She asked, eyes lighting up with zeal, “Working for the Ministry, you’d be set for life! You can move out of your shitty flat-“
Hello everyone, thanks again for checking out my story :) I will be trying to post new chapters as frequently as I can. Please let me know in the comments what you think of the story so far!
Blaise’s eyes nearly bulged out of his skull, “What? Working here?”
Changing the subject, Blaise proposed, “Well since you’re here, we might as well get lunch. You hungry?”
Upon opening it, Draco thought he might actually pass out.
Draco thought. Normally when he received his summons to the Ministry, they typically left a name. This time, the anonymous contractor offered little to no information about why he was there, other than to say that Draco’s work was needed. He was never one to turn down work – especially now that he needed the money to support himself, even if it meant working with Aurors. Still, the times he had worked with the Ministry, it wasn’t nearly as ceremonious as this. Whatever job they had for him this time, he thought, must be big.
He didn’t know what to expect upon telling her. He thought maybe she’d be angry, appalled even. He wasn’t expecting her expression to remain unchanged, as if she’d already known.
Suddenly, Draco knew what this was about. Harry didn’t have to open it for Draco to understand what was inside, the look on Harry’s face alone spoke volumes.
“Good, I was actually hoping to run into you again.”
One particular painting caught Draco’s eye, though he couldn’t read Dutch so the title of it was lost upon him, “I suspect he’s trying to throw us off of his trail.”
Although his tone lacked sincerity behind it, Narcissa still stopped him from leaving when she called his name out.

feel how drunk he was. His head was spinning and the loud noise of the pub became even more deafening than it was before.
Draco squirmed in his seat.
willing to have it again.
“A Slytherin and a Ravenclaw? Who could have guessed it?” Theodore laughed.
Draco’s eyes widened, “A case? You mean-“
“And we’re searching for your father, correct?”
Pansy hummed, “I hardly kept in contact with anyone, save you and Blaise. America is
“Ah,” Blaise responded, “now it all makes sense.”
“Sorry about him, he’s…” Harry trailed off.
“So,” Harry asked, eyes fixated on something in the distance, “how long has this been going on?”
Draco was destined to die alone, with nothing but the weight of his misery to keep him company – he was sure of it.
flat, Draco felt hesitation grip him like a boa constrictor, squeezing the rationality out of him. Anthony was a handsome man, and one who was clearly interested in him, so why was Draco feeling so reluctant? His heart rate quickened when Anthony’s hands slid up his arm, and up to his shoulder. His blue eyes seemed impossibly blue, not unlike the color of azurite. Draco wondered to himself how he ever thought they could be green.
Draco’s face crumpled in confusion but Blaise cackled as they made their way back up the well.
i'm sorry it took me so long to upload this. I've had some serious health issues lately, but I'm in recovery and am feeling much better! Thank you to all who've stuck with me and this story this long. I appreciate it more than words can describe.
Wordlessly, Draco stepped into his room to change, despite desperately wanting to jump back in bed and forget that entire exchange ever happened. With a flick of his wand, Draco apparated to the Ministry, ready to face whatever was to come.
The Auror smiled at him, in response, “I know it’s a lot to think about. Of course, the pay will be substantial. And as for your rather colorful past…”
“What’s that you’ve got?” He wasn’t necessarily curious but needed to say something just so that they wouldn’t sit there in silence, as they’ve done before.
“No,” Draco shook his head, “the passageway is here, inside the well.”
Instead he casted a quick, wandless drying spell and stretched uncomfortably from where he was sitting. He just hoped in the few minutes he took to relax that nobody would recognize-
“Good afternoon.” Draco entered, wielding a wary glance as he realized that behind Robards’ office door, revealed a red-faced Weasley conversing with the Head Auror about some private matter, “I apologize for my unannounced visit.”
Sébastien shrugged, “I’ve never met the man. I serve wizards from all over the world. My guess is that he found me through reputation.”
“Yes, Mr. Potter?” Robards did not look pleased at being interrupted.
“-holds a strong energy. I know,” Harry gave him an understanding look, before walking over to Draco, “It takes some getting used to.”
“Should we split up?” Potter asked when they reached an outdoor exhibit, showing out of place, misfigured statues of some sort. This modern art, Draco realized, he simply didn’t understand.
Weasley laughed, “Harry might be a prodigy when it comes to being an Auror, but bloody hell, what a shoddy dancer he is!”
“And what about my family? Will their name be cleared as well?” Draco demanded.
“It’s not spying,” he whispered to himself, burying his face into the Guiness that sat on the bar in front of him, “it’s mere curiosity.”
Without another word, he disappeared into his room, feeling increasingly uncomfortable with the number of eyes staring at him. He could hear the people begin to chatter among themselves once again and that gave him the time he needed to take a deep breath and sink his face into his hands as he sat on his bed. Why today, of all the days? Why did it have to be after visiting the Manor, when every part of him felt compelled to lock himself indoors and curl under his sheets and contemplate the existential dread of being a Malfoy?
Draco felt tears start to form but he blinked them back before they had the chance to fall. He was so tired of wasting his tears and his breath.
“This calls for a celebration,” Pansy grinned, holding her second martini up in the air as if she were about to give a toast, “I’ll plan everything, of course, but we really should plan it sooner than later.”
He danced with Anthony briefly and Pansy who just groped and rubbed and pushed herself against him. From the corner of his eye, he could see that Harry, Granger and Weasley had all taken their seats and seemed to be in deep conversation about something. It was obvious Harry wasn’t the dancing type, or simply wasn’t drunk enough for it. The trio turned to look at him every now and then, but Draco’s attention was elsewhere when he felt Pansy’s hands on his shoulders, as she turned the drunken man around to face her.
They could hear the man grumbling and the cluttering of several objects before the door swung open, revealing a shady, red-faced man with a white beard and wizened skin, “I said go away! What do you want?”
, Draco thought to himself.
“What is that?” He exclaimed, bewildered as he pointed to the candle.
Only it wasn’t. Blaise didn’t look convinced, and despite himself, Draco wasn’t either.
“I don’t,” His tone came out harsher than he intended, but it was a miracle in itself that he was able to form a sentence to begin with, “work for the Ministry. I work independently. The Ministry has contracted me for my work once or twice.”
“The point of what?”
“No, I will not.” He shook his head and through the tears he saw the look of disappointment on his father’s face. It was more painful than a thousand knives cutting into his chest. It was worse than lying in a pool of his own blood in the Sixth-floor boys’ bathroom.
Draco mumbled, still grasping onto his pillow as if it was a protective shield, “Just leave me here to die.”
Draco snorted, “When has anything in my family been easy? It is what it is.”
With that, the Head Auror left Draco in a tizzy, alone in his new office. He didn’t know how to feel. A part of him was excited at the prospect of having so much power in his position, yet the downside of it was the fact that his entire job was centered around the fact that he was expected to aid in the capture of his father. Had he just found out the news today, he might have fainted on his new employer. His rather embarrassing escapade after eavesdropping on Potter and his friends proved rather useful. At least this way, he had more time to let it settle. Now, his most difficult mission was not finding his father, nor the Time-Turner, but telling his mother the news.
Later in the afternoon, he went to the Manor to have tea with his mother. He tried to visit as often as he could, but once a week was all he could muster when every step he took into the Manor made him want to jump off a bridge.
Draco was shocked to hear that. Of all the people in the world coming to his defense, he never thought it would ever be Weasley.
Draco laughed, until he felt a shirt being thrown at him from across the room.
At the end of Robards’ speech, he ushered Draco into a room with a glass door and an empty desk. It was one of the larger offices he’d seen with a separate door leading directly to the evidence room, or as the Auror’s liked to call it, the Dark room.
Something unfamiliar in Anthony’s eyes made Draco want to retreat, as if he already knew what he was thinking. He was no idiot, he saw the way Anthony looked at him, remembered what his touch felt like the first time they went out drinking and his hands had a mind of their own. If Harry hadn’t been there, he would have likely enjoyed it more. But with the reality of him being just a few paces away, standing within his
for him to come up with the right words to say. He didn’t even know where to start. But he knew he owed him his life, and nothing would ever erase the man from his mind, no matter how hard he tried. Years, months, weeks passed by and it all went to hell the moment Harry Potter stepped into this pub.
“Why’s that?” Draco asked, sipping his water.
“12 Grimmauld Place,” He muttered to himself. A buzzer went off in his head, and suddenly it all made sense, “This is your home?”
Draco sobbed in her arms, for the first time perhaps ever. Years of trauma weighed heavily on his mind, and at that moment, he couldn’t be bothered to put up the front he always had. The thunder roared outside, but the Manor was quiet. The only noise that could be heard in that parlour were the silent sobs of Draco holding his mother, terrified of the moment he had to let go and face his problems head on. Violent images wracked his mind, as he rested his head on her shoulder.
Harry snickered as well, stepping close enough to Draco that they stood shoulder-to-shoulder as they leaned against the sink wall, “And yet, sometimes I feel like you’re the only person I can relate to. You know what it’s like to walk into a room and have people whisper about you, half lies and half truths. You know how it feels to be reminded every damn day what we did or didn’t do.”
"Okay."
"Harry and I bonded over it!" She laughed. "Besides, I admitted to my crush on Granger, so it wasn't totally one-sided. How
What?"
"Most of us are," her voice shook slightly as she spoke. "Your friend is a fantastic Healer."
"Great. I'll be back before that."
"This is highly irregular," Kasper argued. "Nadine wasn't supposed to be part of the Challenge at all. Technically, she should be punished for interfering."
Harry shrugged. "Nope, sorry."
, but he threw his book across the room in a fit of pique and decided to get dressed and leave the flat before he smashed everything he owned and earned himself another visit from the Aurors.
mixed with his. His father had explained the difference to him as a child, had told him his blood made him
“But—“
"Can I undo this? I want to touch your hair."
Draco turns his face into the pillow so that Harry won't see his tears. So this is it, then.
"Alphas are stronger than the average werewolf. They have certain psychic abilities in regards to the well-being of the pack. If needed, the Alpha can also partially transform without a full moon to protect us. Harry's body is just undergoing the physiological changes needed to incorporate these specialized skills. He should be back to normal by his full moon transformation tomorrow night."
“Yes, she was.”
He stood and started toward the door, releasing the Privacy Charm with a wave of his hand.
"Can we start over?"
“What—what could
“Auror raid,” Harry says, as Draco traces his fingers over a scar on his right shoulder, then to another on his left pectoral, then to the strange round one over his sternum. “Aurors, Aurors, oh yeah, that one is from a Horcrux. It sort of...attached itself to my chest. Hermione had to use a Severing Charm to get it off.”
"Look deep into my
, Draco thought to himself.
“You offered to buy me lunch last night, somewhere in the middle of you fawning over Anthony Goldstein and embarrassing yourself in front of Harry Potter.”
“Shut up, Irma.” Harry was the one to interrupt her this time.
Draco rolled his eyes and pulled on the back of Blaise’s collar until he fell back on his chair, “You can flirt later. We’ve no time to waste, you prat.”
Draco felt his palms start to sweat as he glanced at the Aurors passing by his glass-enclosed office, throwing him dirty looks while Robards had his back turned away from them. This surely couldn’t be good.
Draco stood frozen, disbelieving the words he heard. If what they’re saying is true, does this mean that his father is the Death Eater they’ve been searching for? Is this why he’s been invited onto the case?
“I was having lunch with Blaise,” Draco replied, while muttering under his breath, “not that it’s any of your business.”
. Mostly in his thoughts and in his dreams, which consequently tended to turn into nightmares, was he able to distract himself as best as he could by occupying his time with something meaningless. But nearly every damn day, Draco would read his name somewhere in a headline in the Daily Prophet, or from word of mouth as he passed by other wizards in the area. It was as exhausting as it was tormenting.
boring compared to here.”
“Oh, that’s nothing,” Pansy squawked, donning the same pink flush Blaise was, “in fifth year, we played truth or dare in the Slytherin dorms, and I dared Blaise to kiss Millicent. I thought maybe he might have Apparated from how quickly he disappeared!”
He paused suddenly, as Draco exited the evidence room and entered his office once more, “Tell me, Mr. Malfoy, do you keep in contact with your father?”
Draco stuttered, in response, “I…okay.”
“Maybe we could even get the gang back together for a night of drinking.” She grinned at the idea.
There it was, in all its glory. 10 inches long, hawthorn wood – it was just as he remembered it. He had gotten a replacement in the years past, of course, but none felt as right nor as natural as that one did. Draco didn’t even realize the tremors racking his body until he tried to move and found he couldn’t without shaking uncontrollably. He was paralyzed, and in his shock, he found himself speechless as well. Harry refused to make eye contact, and Draco couldn’t find it in him to look at his longtime enemy either. Had Draco not been as stubborn as he was, he wouldn’t have fought the urge to shrink down into himself, like he normally would have.
Robards motioned towards the evidence room, to which Draco followed him in. There wasn’t a single light on in the room, save for a candle placed directly in the center. As they both entered through Draco’s side door, Robards switched on the light to reveal dozens, if not hundreds, of magical items enclosed in boxes on the mile-long stacks of shelves. Draco couldn’t decide if this was a dream come true or a nightmare, as he realized that some of the more dangerous dark artefacts remained enclosed in this room as well. The candle that flickered in the center of the room, at first glance, looked as if it was about to go out. Draco turned his attention towards it, making it flicker into a huge flame that would have engulfed the room if it wasn’t kept in a magically sealed case.
He turned, to find her with a genuine look of affection on her face, making the guilt seep deeply into his stomach, “My dear, please do take care of yourself.”
“Ixion was the son of a king and he murdered his father-in-law. Zeus took pity on him and invited him to dine with the gods, but he grew lustful of Zeus’s wife, Hera. Zeus tricked him by creating a cloud in the shape of Hera and Ixion slept with it, and so Zeus condemned him to a fiery wheel, where he would fall and roll in the Underworld for all of eternity.”
That shut him up quickly. An apologetic look fell over his face, but she didn’t seem to have any time for pity as she quickly waved him off and changed the subject.
Pansy rolled her eyes, “Oh don’t be daft. Everyone will be ecstatic!”
A moment passed before he recognized his surroundings, getting used to the unpleasantness that came with apparating. He hated doing it but it was awfully efficient. As he stepped over to the front door of his flat, he paused, feeling that something was off. Scanning the door with his wand, his heart hammered in his chest upon realizing his protection charms had been broken. Someone was inside
