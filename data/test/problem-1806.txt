Harry grabbed Draco's shoulder, keeping him on the ground as Harry dropped to his knees as well.
Beaming, Harry falls onto the couch. “I made it a game. We aim at cereal pieces and have chocolate rewards for the rest.”
“Harry, then. Please, have a seat.”
His ankles were snatched by an invisible force, ripping Draco from the ground and pulling him high into the air and smacking his head against the stone floor in the process. The little Ravenclaws laughed when Draco's robes fell around his face, casting him into darkness.
Attempting to be polite, Harry asks, “What’d you make?”
“You’re lucky my wand is across the room, Malfoy, or I’d hex your ugly face.”
Mr. Cook continues. “You are of legal age, and you are the next in line to take custody of Teddy instead of a family member such as Mr. Malfoy-”
“You know,” Ms. Dribble calls as she drifts from the bedroom to the bathroom, “chaos and unruliness is expected. The boy’s behavior is hardly a reflection of the new life you’re providing for him right now. So we expect honesty, Mr. Potter.”
"You know, I didn't take you to be gay."
What had been a rather pleasant surprise was Aberforth's willingness to serve Harry practically bottomless alcohol after Hogwarts' curfew and out of bounds.
"Alright, now-"
"I think I might be gay, too."
"Right."
Draco's face split into a huge smile, and Harry leaned forward to kiss him. Their lips were pulled too tight in their smiles to kiss properly, but it didn't matter. Nothing really mattered in that moment. It was surreal, Harry and Draco crouching in the midnight shadow of Mr. Weasley's shed outside of Ron and Hermione's wedding reception, sliding bands onto the other's finger. It may not have ever been what Harry had expected or imagined, but it was everything he could have ever wanted.
"Why? Weasley's such a lovely, understanding person. I can't imagine he'd care." Draco saw some of Harry's bliss flicker at the total lack of sarcasm in his voice but he just sighed, content, as the flicker faded and Harry threw his head back to laugh.
There is a list as tall as a dragon of things that Harry dreads since the war ended, but the anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts is without a doubt at the very top. He’s already sweating under his black dress robes and the ceremonies haven’t even begun.
(See the end of the chapter for
But what if he refuses to say goodbye?
Rolling onto his stomach, Draco huffs a few breaths that dance over the line between scoffs and chuckles, positions himself more comfortably, and falls back asleep.
Draco chuckled softly at the little girl. "You're brave enough to be a Gryffindor."
Even after six years of varying classes with Granger, Draco was still impressed by her ability to practically vomit a textbook. Slughorn nodded, looking just as impressed.
Tom shrugs, unaffected by the sharp tone. “Still true.”
Not after the other night, Harry thought, his heart twisting sadly. He didn't elaborate, but he shook his head. "No, I know that's not it."
"I usually do. It's not that strange."
“Well, obviously, it would be in Teddy’s best interests not to home-hop, but he also needs a home that can provide a stable living environment filled with love and patience as he goes through this tough time.”
“Oh, there are loads that can’t be,” Tom says, leaning on the bar and fixing Draco with a fierce look. “But you’re not one of ‘em. You’re just a boy. Just an unfortunate product of your raisin’.”
I love the Harry Potter world as much as the next guy in 2021, but the Ministry's bulldozing ineptitude that sort of flutters all over the place and the general 'that's not how anything works wtf is wrong with you' that all readers felt over the course of the series is what really gets this story going in the direction I wanted haha
"You can be as mean and nasty as you want," she said, screwing up her face against the tears in her eyes. "And you can push everyone away as much as you'd like, but that doesn't change the fact that you're exactly what you apparently don't want to be - a good person that deserves not to be treated like absolute shit all the time!"
"Don't bother barking up this one's tree," Pansy said, nodding to Draco but not looking at him directly. "He's not worth anyone's time."
Draco rolls his eyes. “Honestly. I’m not about to wake him up if he’s actually sleeping. But I want time with him again. I looked after him every day before all this, and I am not about to have you simply take that away from me when I am so clearly significantly better suited to the task. Just because most of Teddy’s family is gone now doesn’t mean that he ought to be entirely without them.”
Hoping it's not apparent that he was seconds away from drawing his wand, Harry turns his back on Malfoy and strides into the office, Teddy still curled comfortably into his chest.
What she thought there was left to love, Draco hadn't a clue.
Draco reaches to retrieve some plates. His hand smacks into Harry, knocking his glasses askew.
“You don’t deserve Teddy and you know it.”
Ginny. Her brown eyes were wide as she pulled her hand back into her own lap. Charlie nudged Harry, playing off the silent commotion as brotherly shoving, much to Harry's relief. Mrs. Weasley eyed him for a moment, but turned her attention to Ron, who had begun shoveling in his pudding with enough enthusiasm to warrant a reprimand.
"So," Mrs. Weasley started after a few minutes. "Tomorrow's the big day. Everyone excited?"
"She must understand, is all." Harry squeezed Draco's hand. "Nothing wrong about that."
“Fuck this,” he snaps suddenly, rising to his feet. Potter is an absolute imbecile that literally wastes the oxygen he sucks up every second, and Draco is not about to be at his mercy any longer.
“They...
"I haven't-"
There was a pause.
“We’re just...angry at each other.”
"You don't think they'd try to hide it for whatever reason?"
“I hope so,” Ron says on her other side. “Otherwise, I’m not going to keep coming.”
Draco nodded again. Potter's hands moved to Draco's underarms, helping him to his feet. Draco swayed slightly when he stood, but an arm snaked around his waist to hold him steady. Potter grabbed Draco's arm that hung between them and swung it up over his head and around his shoulder. The hand on Draco's waist gently pulled them closer, pressing their sides together, as Potter began to lead them down the corridor.
"Still am." Harry stopped and grabbed Draco's hand then, having him look him in the eye before they reached the store. "How've things been? Your letter was awfully short."
He hadn't said it very loud, but Harry rushed over when Malfoy didn't reply. He dropped to Malfoy's side, heart beginning to hammer, only to find that the Slytherin was...asleep.
"I think I have a better idea than you think," she replied coolly.
"Come on, you can't do this to yourself," she pressed as he looked at her. "Go back to being friends with those Gryffindors and be happy again."
He looked absolutely dead on his feet, skin even taking on a gray tinge in the past couple days.
“What do you mean?” Harry asks. His voice sounds far away, distant in his own ears.
Mr. Cook smiles kindly. “Much as I admire the dedication, there is also your lack of experience with children.”
Hope, tentatively breaking through the raging waves of complete despair, peaked in Draco's eyes, and Harry found himself leaning into the short distance between them.
"Nobody is going to love me while I'm here at Hogwarts," he said softly, feeling the truth in his words. Potter's green eyes flashed in his mind, though, bright and close, stirring something painful in Draco's chest.
“Thank you.”
Draco groaned, rolling himself over and making to sit up.
"Here, hold these, please," Draco's mother said, handing him a tin as he came to her side in the drawing room.
Hermione scowls. “First of all, that was most definitely not an accident and you ought to have used that moment to teach Teddy not to pull on a cat’s tail.”
She rolled her eyes and finally let go of him, but Harry didn't make the break for it he had planned only seconds prior. He sighed and glanced at the group of students that were filing away from them.
"What is?" Harry asked. He was still watching Draco stare at his desk.
“You’ve got to eat more. You can’t grow if you don’t eat.”
“Did you?”
Except he’s not kinless.
"Okay..."
"I don't need some boy to like me," Karen said, her cheeks turning pink but her eyes set and determined. "I don't even like boys."
"But why are you here? Why are you doing this to me?" Draco finally turned then, finding Potter with his hands in his pockets and brows knitted in confusion.
“Ah, ‘ello, ‘arry!” Fleur greets presently. She’s rocking herself in a padded wooden chair, hand on her belly and Teddy at her feet.
The first morning back to lessons, Draco felt more refreshed and ready for the world than he had in a long time. Perhaps not his bum, but the rest of him felt in top form. Despite their usual arrangement to not share a bed on the weeknights, Harry had stayed in Draco's dormitory after their rather spectacular evening. It had been nice, just lying together and talking as the sun faded into the horizon and they faded into sleep. Their bodies had overcompensated for them, however, and Draco and Harry both awaken before dawn, giving them plenty of time to sneak Harry out of the Slytherin dungeon and back to his own dormitory.
“Mr. Potter,” Ms. Dribble interrupts. “I must say, I am impressed.”
So drown his sorrows he had.
“Shhh!” A finger springs to Potter’s lips. “He’s finally asleep! He needs to rest, not you bursting in and bothering him.”
“Merlin’s beard, are you paid to find the best in everything?”
"I wasn't sure you were coming," Draco's mother said as he entered the kitchen. It smelled amazing.
Harry nodded back, lying his head on the pillow beside Draco. After a moment, he laughed softly. "You know, if someone had told me a few months ago that I'd be happily sharing a bed, twice, with Draco Malfoy and snogging him in some broom closet, I'd have probably hexed them on the spot. Funny how things change, mm?"
Madam Pomfrey was fussing. Draco had been awake for nearly two hours. He had eaten everything on the tray she had brought him, drank every drop of the potion she gave him, answered every question she had asked him, and performed every strange task she had requested. He had felt particularly foolish when she had asked him to hop on one foot, but Draco had done it. Anything to be released to the privacy of his own room.
Seeming to realize what she said, Mrs. Weasley's face turned bright red. "Oh, dear, I'm so sorry-not quite what I-I'll just go see to Arthur, shall I?"
"Take...off...these...blasted...boxers," Draco moaned between kisses. His hands reached down and began to tug at the fabric still keeping them apart, and Harry released his grip on Draco's cock to help.
“Well, that’s not unusual,” Mr. Cook says pleasantly, then he nods toward Teddy himself. “And he certainly seems to be doing just fine. I swear he’s grown twenty centimeters since I last saw him. Perhaps you could speak with a pediatric healer about solutions if you’re still concerned about it, though, Harry. And speaking of which, when is his next appointment?”
Where was
Draco knew that voice. He cringed as he looked up and saw Pansy standing over him, giving Karen a haughty look. Easily three times the first year's size, Pansy stepped around Draco's chair to stand in front of them both, arms crossed and legs locked. To Karen's credit, she didn't seem intimidated, only confused.
Ron's mouth opened and closed a few times, eyes wide with disbelief, but Hermione looked thoughtful.
“I am not-”
He took off his robes, stripping to just a tee shirt and boxer briefs before climbing into bed. There was little hope that sleep would come to him, but Draco pulled his covers around him all the same, punching the lumps out of his pillow before dropping onto it. Only a few minutes passed before he was brooding again.
“...Draco.”
Draco tenses.
Mr. Weasley’s voice cuts in. “Molly, she looks beautiful. Let her wear her hair as she pleases. Plenty of other witches have their hair off their shoulders.”
“Oh. What, then?”
But, for all his supposed Gryffindor bravery, Harry had yet to tell her. Instead, Harry had taken to avoiding her at all costs, hastily crafting excuses to leave whenever he did happen to befall her company. Hurt swam in her eyes each time. It tore at Harry when he was alone, yet he continued to do nothing.
He stopped as Draco gave a watery scoff.
Hermione shook her head sadly. "That's just awful."
“You probably just got lucky like you always have. Achieving the same feat for an entire day rather than a couple hours would be more reflective.”
“Day-o!” Teddy’s voice betrays Harry. It’s all safety and joy, and it takes everything in Harry not to openly groan right in the Care-Seekers’ beaming faces.
Admittedly, Draco hasn’t thought about Teddy’s lost parents as often as he maybe should. Lupin and his wife were hardly what would even be called acknowledged in his social circle before their deaths. Tonks was brought up as bait for Bellatrix and his mother, but otherwise, Teddy’s parents were simply names, a former teacher. Still, he knew the story of Teddy’s namesake; Andromeda was always quite proud, and it was the sole reason for her being singed from the family tree long before Draco was even born.
“I mean,” Potter begins after several seconds, “that’s- but I’m gone five days a week, eight hour a day minimum. It’s a-”
Harry flopped onto the bed beside Draco with a contented sigh. "I can't really bring myself to give a damn at the moment, to be honest."
"With this year, you can rebuild yourself. Make yourself a strong, better man than your father ever was." His mother's voice wavered, and Draco forced himself to look back up at her. Tears swam in her eyes.
"It's both of our potion. It would practically be cheating if you weren't here."
“Well, yes.” Harry rubs at the back of his neck. “So we have to get going pretty quick. You ready, Teddy?”
But there is no way Draco can attend. There is absolutely no way that he’s going to stride into the remembrance ceremony of a battle in which he very openly fought on the wrong side. It’s the epitome of a potential disaster. Everything he fears, hates, and actively represses, all rolled into one enormous, society-wide escapade that requires dress robes and a perfectly-molded somber face. Blood draining away into the shadowiest reaches of his soul, Draco’s hands shake as he unfolds the leaflet against his better judgement.
Gasping and stuttering for breath, Draco jumped as though burned. Harry leapt back, hand pulling away and eyes widening in alarm. For a moment, they sat there, Draco on his back and propped up on his elbows, Harry straddling him and leaning back, both breathing heavily.
“Right. Sounds...sounds good.”
So he sat among Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs, all whispering together and shooting glances at him from time to time. Draco fiddled with his quill to avoid looking at them.
“Not particular to potions, no.”
"Oh, Harry, Draco, thank goodness I found you," she said, pulling them both into a bone-breaking hug. She pulled back and held onto their robes as she fixed them with a stern glare. "You two staying sober as you promised, right?"
"Did you even read the definition and use?" Hermione sighed.
Without giving him a chance to reply, Hemione pats Harry on the arm and is whisked away by a passing swarm of Ministry workers. Perhaps it’s for the best. Harry hasn’t a clue how to respond anyway.
"And for another, you were alone." Harry's smile fell. "You kept your head down, didn't talk, didn't show up for meals. It was just different. And especially finding out about people attacking you in the corridors and you were just taking it...I couldn't ignore that. That has stopped, right?"
"That's it?" Ron asked, scandalized. "No lecture? No silent treatment? No nothing?"
“Think of it more as a liability contract,” Ms. Dribble says.
Malfoy eyed him. His lips twitched. "Just that your record doesn't leave me wanting you to brew up an antidote for me anytime soon."
"Malfoy?" Harry gently pressed his knuckles into Malfoy's chest.
Harry's head smacked the floor, sending fireworks erupting in his vision, but he blinked them away as he twisted himself and pulled at Malfoy's robes so that they were both upright. When Harry finally came face to face with Malfoy, his heart stopped.
Potter raised his brows but nodded. "I suppose you're right. That was a bit of a nightmare waking up, wasn't it? Nearly wet myself."
“Right,” Potter says, turning his back on Draco. “Teddy, come on.”
Draco shrugged. "Mother's better, but...I mentioned that you and I were friends."
Hermione sighed as though hearing his thoughts. "All I'm saying is that if you persist this...let's call it a 'friendship' with Malfoy, it's going to draw attention. Just...be prepared for it to be taken either way."
"Morning."
He walked up to Harry in the greenhouse, tossing his bag under the table as he greeted him.
His chest almost cracks like the wall.
"Come on," Hermione said when she returned from the storeroom, arms full of ingredients. She didn't sound as exasperated as he had expected. There was even some sympathy, or maybe just pity, in her eyes. "The potion's not terribly complicated to start, and it'll help take your mind off Draco."
But, being so late, Draco knew his mother was likely asleep. He stood from the bed and made his way to the kitchen. A cup of tea might calm him enough to catch a few minutes of sleep.
“Are you having trouble with money?” Harry asks bluntly. Unease weaves into the acids of his stomach.
This is also the point in Deserved were I always felt I left my comfort zone when it comes to writing sex/feelings/pushing characters so outside their canon-personalities, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 2017 me was different than 2020 me.
“Since Teddy’s most recent park fiasco, I took the liberty to ask around at work where a good alternative for magical children would be,” Draco says, eyes averted as he walks over to the bookshelf. “That address is for a park protected by what will appear to be an abandoned burial house. It seems to be the most popular one and the most secure.”
"Back to my dormitory," Harry said. "Admit it, you slept better there than you have all year. Nothing weird. Just...you need sleep."
Mr. Cook pulls out a long roll of parchment from the opposite side of the large desk and lays it on the surface between them. The writing is neat and small, filling the entire thing with all manners of indentations, asterisks, bolded phrases, and blank underlines for signatures, initials. It’s a daunting piece of paperwork.
“What is your obsession with independence?” Harry asks furiously, using every ounce of restraint he has not to raise his voice. “He’s only two!”
The switch from Malfoy’s flat to Harry’s is always a bit jarring, much as Harry tries to ignore it. He sets Teddy down to look around. Having remembered the stress of trying to clean the entire place just before the Care-Seekers arrived last time, Harry took the time to do most of the cleaning last night after Teddy had gone to bed. All that remains to do now are a few dishes. Regardless, the place is nothing compared to Malfoy’s roomy home. Harry sighs as he sinks into the loveseat.
"And why would you do that?"
"Here we are!" Granger said when she finally returned. Four Butterbeers slid onto the table as she climbed back into her seat.
“Not, ah...arguing, yelling, that sort of behavior, around Teddy?”
"But for the third day in a row, it is."
“Go park? Go park day?”
Storming into the kitchen, he pulls out a thick glass and a half-empty bottle of Beetle Berry Whiskey. Chase only told him not to
Malfoy scoffed lightly, but his voice wasn't the scathing tone Harry expected. "No. It's mostly different oils and some herbs. We'd be in trouble if it were making the noises you're hearing."
When Andromeda and Teddy first stepped through the manor’s doors with their unending luggage, they completely altered Malfoy Manor. Decades of layered stiffness and stillness shattered, replaced by the Tonks’ joy and life and bountiful hope. Without ever trying, Teddy transformed the manor, transformed Draco, and Draco craves that light to be back in his life for good.

Harry swallows. Is letting a known ex-Death Eater watch Teddy, regardless of circumstances, going to make him look like an unfit guardian?
Draco looked down at his tea, unsure of what to say.
"Well, they are weeds, and weeds have a natural survivability even in the colder months. And if you're comfortable, you're more than welcome to call me 'Luna'."
"You were the one that wanted to take our time."
Draco removed a hand from Teddy to wipe the baby slobber off his face and Teddy wiggled until he dropped onto Draco's leg, cooing happily. Sitting there, letting the baby crawl all over his lap, exploring the stranger in his living room, Draco felt some of the calm he thought he had left on the train coming back to him.
"I'll, er, meet you guys there," he said. He looked over and saw Ron and Hermione stopped and waiting for him. "Really, I'll catch up. There's something I want to check out first."
Frowning, Draco makes to answer the door. Who could possibly want to visit with him?
“Seep Daco bed?”
Harry's hand on Draco's back slid further down, finally cupping the firm arse there and pressing their cocks together between them. Unintentionally, one of Harry's fingers slipped between Draco's cheeks, dragging gently across the entrance within.
Their quiz, merely ten open-ended questions about the most basic differences between potions, draughts, and elixirs, wasn't difficult at all. Draco finished only second to Granger, and when Slughorn took up their parchments, he felt confident that he'd be among the top half of the class. They were then instructed to collect their potions, some of them adding in a few drops of veritaserum. Draco and Harry hadn't been selected to add to their potion, leaving them a few minutes to talk while Slughorn marked their quizzes.
“Noted. I’m still going to start the process, open up that conversation this week, see how it goes.”
“The last time we walked to the store, unfortunately,” Draco says, walking toward the kitchen. “Besides, I think Teddy ought to work through the basics of toilet training and fully master them before we try to attempt an outing.”
“Otay.”
The following morning, Draco actually made it to breakfast, never having gone to bed the night before. He arrived early enough that only a handful of students were there, sipping coffee and sleepily buttering toast. Only a pair of third years sat at the Slytherin table, and Draco made sure to given them plenty of room, sitting at the very end of the table nearest the doors. He poured a cup of coffee and held it with both hands, savoring the warmth.
That stopped Draco in his tracks.
Draco smiled. It was the same thing for him. Something about the safety that came with his nights beside Harry quelled Draco's nightmares and allowed him uninterrupted sleep. It was the most beautiful thing, something precious.
Potter’s voice is soft and irritated. “Who the bloody-”
“Yeah, I-” Harry swallows past a dry mouth. “Yeah, Andromeda and Teddy moved in with the Malfoys after Lucius died. But did-”
"Look, I'm trying to do my homework. I'm behind enough already, so give it a rest. You're too young to understand anyway."
Though his voice is gentle, Mr. Cook’s question seems to spark hot electricity through Teddy, who jerks, shoving himself deeper into Harry’s chest, knocking most of the air out of his lungs. A grunt slips from them both, and Mr. Cook’s smile falters.
In one fluid motion, Harry pulled his hand from Malfoy's chest, extracted his own wand, and pointed it directly at Josh. Though there were several feet separating them, Josh flinched considerably and stepped to the side. Harry kept his wand trained on him.
is back. “What?”
"Because I should be punished," Malfoy said savagely.
"Oh, yeah," Harry said lamely. "He, er, well, he was upset, but we...we talked a bit and he's doing alright now."
“Why couch? Bed?”
Potter blinks stupidly. “You came to see Teddy?”
"No worries," Draco said to Mrs. Weasley. "We're happy to help."
“I ‘lly shou’ug Te’y more, shou’n’t I?”
"Yeah, for like a jinx or something, not this," Conrad said. "This isn't right, mate. It's going to cause questions."
"Wow, thanks."
“Angwy who?”
Draco raised a hand to stop him as he stood up. "I'd love to hear whatever insult you've been rehearsing, but I have far better things to be doing right now."
Mr. Cook nods. “A lot of that is what one typically agrees to when it comes to registering children for more institutionalized child care, nothing too out of bounds.
Draco unbuttoned Harry's pants painstakingly slow, nipping at his neck all the while, sending Harry into a daze while he again fumbled his fingers at Draco's dress robes, trying to figure out how to undo them. But when Harry's pants fell to the floor and Draco began to kiss and nibble his way down Harry's front, all brain functions ceased. He could only stand there, breathing heavily against the door, as Draco's nose bumped the skin just beside his erection, cheek grazing his cock without meaning to and making Harry's eyes roll back. Draco's hands were sliding down Harry's sides, coming to rest on his thighs, as he tilted his head to plant a tender kiss to the underside of Harry's cock.
It started with a few of his old friends from the DA finding him - Luna, Parvati and Padma Patil, Cho Change, Michael Corner. Then it became people he only knew by sight, followed by downright strangers pleading for his autograph. Before long, people lingered in their compartment, begging for details of Harry, Ron, and Hermione's year away from Hogwarts, how Harry had killed Voldemort, how Harry himself hadn't died when he went into the Forbidden Forest that night.
"Uh...no. I deliberately avoided it, even though she really wanted to."
Of course Teddy is terrified of him now, Draco thinks with a fresh wave of shame; Teddy has never seen Draco so much as raise his voice before. Seeing what was likely the bulk of Draco and Potter’s row, Teddy just witnessed one of his favorite people, one of the two only people in his life anymore turn into a monster before his very eyes.
As though slapped, Draco was shoved back as his cheek was forcefully scratched. It didn't feel particularly deep, but Draco fought not to shake as the cut began to sting.
She smiled back. "Of course. Now let me go - I'm late for lunch!"
"Any idea what that was about?"
Herbology passed in a haze, Draco shifting between holding his head and stuttering out any breath he could, sure he was going to drop dead any second, to scratching random words from the blackboard onto his parchment. When the bell rang, he simply dropped his head onto the desk, feeling exhausted and wanting to sleep. At least his next period was a break, then lunch. So much time before he had to be anywhere.
"I've been giving him all the space he could ever want and it's absolutely awful."
And because Harry was Harry, he burst out laughing.
"But..." Harry shook his head. "Treating you like a...like a human being isn't causing a scene, Malfoy."
“I know you do. I’m sorry, Teddy.” Harry closes his eyes at the surges of emotion, thinking of Teddy’s grief, of all they’ve lost, they and everyone else. “I’m so sorry.”
"No, it's not that, it's just..."
"Huh. Guess I could've."
"It's nothing."
“Isn’t-” Harry frowns. “Isn’t he a bit young? When do kids typically toilet train?”
responsible for almost the full bulk of Teddy’s needs, isn’t he?”
“He needs to eat more.”
"I know." Draco pressed a chaste kiss to Harry's lips. "I love you."
A hiss came from Malfoy's lips, and Harry turned to find Malfoy squeezing his left hand. A few blood drops sat on the table next to his discarded knife.
"How does that make any sense?"
Ropes sprung up around Draco's ankles, knees, middle, and shoulders, pinning his arms against his sides and locking his legs together. Caught off guard, he fell forward, only turning his head at the last second to avoid another bloody nose. His cheek crashed into the stone, though, sending a wave of pain through his face.
"For serving alcohol to students!"
Very carefully so as not to wake Malfoy, Harry removed Malfoy's robes and shoes. He stirred slightly as Harry worked, but after a few stressful minutes, Harry had Malfoy lying on his bed in only his undershirt and his pants, still sound asleep. Far more comfortable for sleeping. Luckily, Harry's covers were as he had left them, shoved to the side, making it easy to cover Malfoy up without further disturbing him.
But the dam is shattered. Draco can’t stop now, not if he wanted to, not if he tried, not if he was physically felled on the spot. “You think I was just born thinking these things, acting this way? You think attempting to
He had never admitted it out loud. Draco hadn't anyone to tell that he suspected that, of all those that he surrounded himself with all those years, not one had ever truly been his friend. It was humiliating, but nothing more than he deserved. Draco's adolescent years at Hogwarts were just a seven-year cringe.
“Look, I get you’re worrying like some middle-aged witch but I for one am trying to get some dinner on the table so Teddy has a little bit of normalcy and still goes to bed at a decent time-”
“Ah-wee otay?” Teddy asks suddenly, absolutely
Harry withdrew the hand that had been holding Draco's cheek and trailed his fingers down Draco's neck, halting briefly to tickle the exposed nipple on Draco's chest as he continued downward. Draco gasped slightly, rolling his head back with pleasure and only fueling Harry's boldness. As Harry dipped to nibble at the skin that blended Draco's neck and shoulder, he let his hand continue to wander down Draco's chest and stomach. His index finger cautiously slipped into Draco's waistband.
"What-" He stopped when his voice caught, and he cleared his throat. "Why am I here?"
“I’d be careful, Malfoy. Your face might stick like that.”
"I didn't know falling in love required any level of maturity."
He’s not wrong, but that’s sort of what annoys Harry the most.
Sorry for any irritations and thanks for sticking through :)
But Harry could only shake his head as Draco removed his dress robes, pushing them to the floor and working next on his undershirt. Harry made to catch up, but he couldn't seem to find the clasps on Draco's front while concentrating on their kiss, only managing to get his fingers lost in the fabric.
"That would explain a lot."
"Oh?"
"Come on, Harry, let's go!" Ron called as he walked past, his and Hermione's own vial in hand. "Malfoy leave you with the clean up?"
Harry pressed a kiss to Draco's cheek, pulling his attention. "You okay?"
"I get that you three are these big heroes that can do no wrong and things would be fair for you, but it's not going to be that way with her!" He grabbed at his hair, breathing labored and legs weak. "I...I did this to her, and I-I-I have to fix it! I can't-I don't-"
"Oh, you foolish little-"
Teddy.”
"There's something really wrong with you, you know that?" the tallest one shouted, tilting her head up to make sure Draco could see just how angry she was. "Harry's been through enough without you going on and pulling some Dark Magic on him!"
Draco groans, and he can hear Harry doing the same. “No, Teddy,” they say together.
Somewhat refreshed, Harry stands by the door with his back to Teddy for another few minutes, until the sounds of general upset are mostly faded and he can hear his name being tentatively whispered. Teddy’s face is pale but for around his eyes, dry and a little bloodshot, and Harry’s heart melts at the sight. But with so much happening, he hasn’t the time to snuggle Teddy as much as he needs. Instead, with a soft voice and gentle hand around Teddy’s, Harry leads the toddler back into the house to deliver a quick apology to Fleur, who then takes Teddy by the other hand to find a seat in the garden. With about fifteen minutes left, Harry jogs up the staircases back to Ron’s room.
"Once you've completely come down from the spell, I suspect you'll be quite happy the Ministry's done their investigation." The girl scowled. "Honestly, I can't believe the Ministry even let one of their kind come back to Hogwarts! What were they thinking, letting two Death Eaters go free? They're just plain evil-"
Even though it had been years, Harry still wished Sirius's head would pop out of the flames. Maybe Sirius could tell him that he was being totally mental for wanting to be Malfoy's friend and talk some sense into him, like Ron had been trying to do since the start of term. It'd be like Sirius to do so, Harry thought as he remembered the bitterness in his godfather's voice when he talked to or about Snape, his equivalent to what Malfoy had always been to Harry. The memory made his heart sink slightly.
All in all, it had been a miserable first two weeks of the new year, and Harry was quite glad when Friday's lessons were over. Despite the disaster of the previous weekend, Harry wondered if he could get away with another sneaky visit to Hogsmeade. He doubted Professor McGonagall would be keeping too sharp an eye out. Far more likely to impede him was Aberforth refusing to serve him after the trouble Harry had caused.
"What?"
"Uh..." Draco thought about facing the Great Hall, the angry stares, the furious whispers. Harry, sitting on the opposite side of the room, his back likely to him. "No, I don't think I will."
“Alright, but just for a minute or two, okay?”
"Better than you'll ever have?" Draco asked, his voice only barely concealing his moan. "I must say, I agree."
It didn't warrant an answer, and Harry snatched Draco's hand back in his and led him out of the dungeons, Granger and Weasley at their heels. It was blissfully strange, Draco thought as the four skipped up the castle to the library to spend the remainder of time until lunch. The golden trio of their year, heroes of the wizarding world, walking happily alongside the teenage Death Eater that was practically the reason for Albus Dumbledore's murder. But Draco couldn't bring himself to stress over the details of the strangeness of their group as they filed into the library, quietly giggling among the shelves.
"Like...in her arms...?"
"As much as everyone keeps trying to say that," Harry said firmly, his hands holding Draco's face. "I am not just trying to save you. I have better things to do than try to save someone I don't like or don't think deserves it."
“I have...I’ve got to stop smiling.
“Park!” Teddy squeals, jumping down to run a couple laps around his room. Harry lets the sight fill him up, smile only faltering when he turns, catches sight of Draco in the doorway, looking irritated.
“Day-o?” Teddy’s head lifts then, eyes cracking open. “Lank?”
Harry just sighs.
Quick as a flash, Draco whips around, robes fanning out as he scans the night. It wouldn’t be the first time he’s been sought out while leaving work. But after nearly two years, most people either know to avoid him or have already gotten their taunts out of the way.
Outraged, Harry’s voice raises. “You want to talk about being careful with orphans? Those-”
you don't need looking after that I asked Luna to check on you."
Harry chuckles. “What about Percy?”
Merlin, Draco thinks. “Yes,” he says aloud. “He’s still getting all his food groups, though. He’s anything but particular. I feel like he just doesn’t like to eat a lot at once, so he has smaller portions throughout the day.”
"Where are you going?" Draco asked.
"Potter..."
"Good. You deserve it."
"All we have is each other. I ought to have at least pretended to grieve with her. But I let her do it alone."
Nothing.
Bliss.
Hot embarrassment seared Draco's stomach. He didn't need an escort.
Teddy shimmies out of Potter’s arm to the floor, waddles at a toddle-sprint to throw himself into Draco’s waiting embrace. It’s brief, seeing each other regularly once more, and Draco looks up to find absolute fury raging in Potter’s eyes as he stomps closer.
"Why're you so pro-Malfoy all the sudden, anyway?" came a voice from directly behind Harry. He turned and found himself within feet of Ginny for the first time in months, who was glaring down at him.
Against all his screaming instincts to fuck Draco into an oblivion, Harry carefully pulled himself partially out, then slid back in just as carefully. The sensation was beyond pleasure, beyond bliss, beyond anything Harry had ever felt. It was the perfect answer to every question he had ever asked, the destination that he felt he had always been seeking. Harry moaned, dropping his face into Draco's chest as he pulled back again, sliding slowly back to that spot that made Draco whimper.
“It doesn’t matter. It’s our job to make him ready.”
Harry gives up, opens the door.
"Now, this is a rather unusual ingredient, as it is a potion itself, correct? But, as I'm sure some of you remember, it also wasn't listed in the recipe."
Karen's deep blush answered for her. A laugh bubbled up in Draco's chest, though it came out more like a dry gargle. She let go of him, arms crossing indignantly.
When the committee had been formed, Harry alone had been given the list of students they would be discussing, and he had immediately seen Malfoy's name. Without a second thought, Harry had appealed to Kingsley directly that Malfoy, as well as his mother, be acquitted. When asked what evidence or reasoning he had for their innocence, Harry had used the weight of his own name for the first time to ask that they simply be cleared without a trial as a favor. Though obviously confused, Kingsley had agreed, wiping the name from Harry's list and seeing to the acquittal personally. Ron and the others had openly wondered why Malfoy hadn't been on their list, but Harry had remained silent. Hermione and perhaps Luna may have supported Harry's decision, but he knew few others would be so forgiving of the Malfoys.
“Next summer,” Harry says. “June, I believe.”
"And why not?"
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Malfoy suddenly says. He’s looking at the clock over the table, which reads just a few minutes until five. “I’ve got to go. Teddy? Teddy, come on now, it’s time to go!”
he’s incapable of being unconditionally affectionate in the way Teddy deserves. He would love to blame the entire thing on Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, and yet Draco feels it with his very soul, the crushing weight of his inability to just
A few moments crept by as Harry scribbled something down about wood-based ingredients. As Slughorn began to drone on about the different uses, Harry realized Malfoy had set his quill down at some point. He had his head resting lightly on the fingertips of his right hand, eyes closed and breathing as though partially submerged in water.
“What, you stick to exactly everything you’ve ever said and never had a change of heart, even just for an afternoon?”
“It’s three in the morning. No.”
"Yes, I am."
Torn between not wanting to see more of Malfoy and curiosity over what could possibly be making such a sound, Harry hesitates at the door for far too many moments before finally wrapping his hand around the door knob and carefully cracking it open.
“I know you do. I count what’s in the drawer.”
That was all she had to say about it? Karen had moved her head down to stare somewhere over her feet that were still on the opposite armrest, so Draco couldn't read her facial expression. She didn't say anymore for several minutes, and Draco decided after a bit to take it as s good sign. Not that he would have necessarily blamed Karen. The wizarding world was a bit more ahead of the times than what little he knew about the muggle world, but they still had a long way to go for total acceptance.
When Draco woke next, the world was properly still. He kept his eyes closed for a few moments, not wanting to relive the pain that opening them had brought him before, but curiosity got the better of him. Carefully, he cracked a single eye but found that it was dark enough to be safe. He opened his eyes and looked around.
His room is about as dark as his nightmare, but that’s all Draco can readily recall of it. He never has been good at remembering his dreams, and now that he has plenty of fodder for the worst kinds of nightmares, he’s grateful. The fear lingers in him in spite of the lacking memories, the missing reason, and Draco sits up to chug the glass of water at his bedside.
Pain flickered in Malfoy's eyes. "She's a fool for seeking my company."
"I'm great. Really."
Harry glances at Draco, who wants nothing more than to groan. He really ought to teach Harry how to lie. Stay calm and confident, make sure to sprinkle in enough truth so that it’s impossible to separate what’s false.
"You're welcome?"
It was pathetic, Draco knew. What was stopping him from taking notes like a normal student? He should be able to face the stares and the glares, he should be able to handle the whispers and being hated. He wasn't a child. Why was it suddenly so hard to breathe?
Rolling his eyes, Harry walks into Teddy’s room. The little boy looks miserable. Eyes puffy from crying and lips pulled back into a grimace, Teddy moves a handful of figurines around the carpet before him while making little noises on their behalf. It’s half-hearted at best. But when he catches sight of Harry, Teddy’s face cracks in half with the power of his smile and he launches into air for Harry to catch him.
“I know, but we can’t-”
Bemused, Harry and Draco glanced over and found a Hufflepuff, a student Draco didn't recognize, peeking into the greenhouse, her eyes wide.
"I don't care what Lucius Malfoy would have said, it doesn't make your cold attitude justified!"
"Malfoy?"
“You could
Keeping his hands warm in his pockets, Harry nudged Draco with his elbow. "Well, now you've met him. Cute little thing, right?"
Harry's eyes grew wider in understanding. "Oh. Oh, right."
Flames were pressed firmly into Draco's skin, igniting his skin where four wand tips assaulted him. The wand tips lifted and found new flesh to burn, repeating the process over and over again. Draco groaned involuntarily and squirmed at the pain, but thankfully, his attackers held him steady.
His feet took him back toward the common room. As he dropped a floor, an empty path met him. It was Friday and the day before Halloween; most of the castle would be out and about until curfew. The emptiness was nice, and Draco let out a sigh as he walked.
The soft voice startles Harry, mostly due to the fact he didn’t realize just how much Teddy has already quieted down. It’s still loud but less carrying, and Harry looks up from the shaded corner they’re huddled in and sees Malfoy standing a few meters away. Looking uncomfortable, he clears his throat.
"Maybe," Harry said, his temper rising. "Since none of you seem to be trying to move past anything at all, just trying to stay stuck in the all the hate from before the war."
"Hermione, what in the bloody-"
“Come on, little one. Let’s get you in bed. You must be tired.”
"Have you been asleep this whole time?" she asked, brows knitting together in surprise. "It's nearly lunchtime. I was starting to get worried."
Harry rubbed his eyes as he watched the far away practice. A chilly wind passed by, tickling his nose as he thought that, though unbelievably difficult and uncomfortable, he was quite glad that he finally spoken with Ginny and set things straight. At least now she had her closure and could truly move on with her life. Harry likely would be involved with the Weasley family for a long time to come, and he hoped that one day he and Ginny could be at least cordial.
That terror in Malfoy's eyes haunted Harry throughout the day. The way he had quietly pleaded that Harry not defend him
The corridors weren't as empty as Draco had hoped, the passing period not yet complete. Lined up outside the classroom door was a mass of Slytherin first years, the little girl from the feast among them. She appeared far less miserable, even waving shyly as Draco passed. Despite himself, he smiled back, the last of his anxiety from Herbology slipping away.
His stomach dropped out of his body entirely and his lungs stopped working for several seconds. Harry's mouth fell open as he took a subconscious step back. He had been so careful. He had looked around when he entered the common room - no one had been there.
The classroom door burst open.
"What the-" Harry gasped, then he pulled Malfoy in for a fierce hug. "What the
Four days was a long time to wait for what should have been a quick letter. Draco's nerves were shot from the anticipation, waiting every morning for the horned owl to return. But the week had ended and Draco had still yet to receive a reply with the Saturday morning post. Though he had been keeping an eye out for any further news in discarded copies of the
"No one else's opinion matters. You're in control of your own happiness, you know. Aren't...aren't you miserable now?"
“This is excellent, Harry,” Mr. Cook says. “Do you and Mr. Malfoy plan to continue this arrangement for long?”
Professor Slughorn had only just risen from his desk when Harry quietly entered the dungeons. The squat wizard grinned at him, winking as though they were old friends, and gestured for Harry to find a seat.
Breathing normally again, Draco felt as though crawling out of a well that had tried its damnedest to drown him. Exhaustion smacked him all at once. His shoulders slumped and his body tilted forward a few inches only to be caught by the hands still pressed to his chest.
Harry hadn't been able to stop himself from helping Draco when he had found him near unconsciousness in the snow the other day. He had stopped and helped without thinking, falling easily into the role and relishing in the contact he was able to have with Draco. Harry didn't regret a second of it. Bringing Draco back from the brink of collapse was the least Harry could do for him. It had been most relieving when Draco hadn't pushed him away, but Harry had made sure not to overstay his welcome, leaving Draco there in the snow once his breathing had returned to normal.
"Alright, then, I'll stir. You pour in the leaves when I say so."
“Fine.”
This is what his therapist, a young healer named Oscar Chase, was torturing Draco over just last evening.
Potter's lips twitched as though wanting to smile. "Maybe not, but I think things could be different now, don't you?"
"All we're doing is...wait, what is it we're having to do again?"
Teddy frowns from his position on the floor of the play area, blocks stacked about three high and another poised in his hand. “No,” he whines.
He can go to the store another day.
The men all nodded, smiling indulgently as Ginny stepped into the room.
“Right...” Draco clears his throat. “Well, since all this has happened, my finances are stretched thin. What with having to move, replace everything, and now caring for Teddy and keeping him and myself fed, I’m not left with much at the end of the month. I’m sure things will look up in time, but for now I’m trying to cut costs where I can so I can replenish a savings account for emergencies.”
“He’s not stupid. He knows what he’s supposed to do. He just won’t. Thinks I’m going to give up if he wets himself enough, well we’ll just see-”
And maybe he did.
“Hmmm. Well...”
"What a wonderful surprise, Draco!"
Draco's stomach twisted with regret. He had come an awfully long way in the past few months, but Draco still didn't feel entirely certain that he deserved the happiness that begin with Harry brought him. Was he really ready to commit more than he already had to dooming Harry to the reputation of being seen with a Malfoy? Already students at the castle whispered when they walked together in the corridors as friends. How much worse might it become if they actually crossed that line and showed the true nature of their relationship in the open?
"No, you are!"
"Whatever," Josh said after a moment. "We don't have to take this."
"Been a bit more than friendly, I'd say. Snogged him a few times. Once in our dormitory."
He didn't leave his room the rest of the day, instead brooding and trying to complete some of his homework. At first distracted, it only took a few scratch-outs on his Defense Against the Dark Arts essay to kick Draco into some real focus. Before things got out of hand, Draco had actually enjoyed his schoolwork, a secret he kept from all his friends and fans at the time to keep up a certain image, but he had relished in the knowledge school brought him and the marks he earned. Because of the difficulty and sheer volume of work that the seventh years were undertaking, Draco could actually forget that he was a complete waste of a human being in the time he spent working.
Harry already had the cork off the vial, making it simple work to dump the leaves into the cauldron. The potion's surface shimmered slightly at the addition, emanating a soft hiss as it turned a milky violet against Hermione's continued stirring.
Potter’s wand is raised again. “‘Narrow-mindedness?’” he cries. “You want to talk about narrow-mindedness, what about all your swagger around Hogwarts, calling half the school 'mudbloods' and cheering when the Chamber of Secrets opened?”
Of course.
"You ought to let me have another one."
"So...is that a yes?" Draco asked.
"Wow, it tastes just as good as it smells."
He hadn't found him, though. Harry sighed as he neared the top of the tower. He had looked absolutely everywhere he could think, but Malfoy was apparently far faster than he looked, having made it to the castle before Harry could catch him and disappearing into the safe depths of the Slytherin dungeon.
"Cool. What're you reading now?"
"...no."
!" as she pointed her wand at his feet.
"Or it might be that he was scared of committing to you and this was just a good excuse to pull away a bit," she said cautiously.
That would have been nice to know earlier on, Harry thought. But he supposed that was the point.
Granger's hand hit the air again.
“Er...”
“Technically, you are a part of the Ministry’s Auror training program, not a full employee.”
"Sure thing."
“Of course not.”
how he’s going to beat Draco at his own game.
“It’s this another one of your independence obsessions?”
of us, I’m someone he actually knows, someone he happens to like, regardless of what you might prefer.”
Hermione gave him a sympathetic smile and patted his arm. "I know. But you of all people ought to know by now that we don't really have a say in when things like this come up. You've faced worse and come out on top. I doubt a little thing like a crush on Malfoy is going to ruin you now."
"Uh..."
Draco expels a breath he was apparently holding, frustration coming out in a low whine. “If he would just have a single success, he’d catch on straight away. He’s a bright kid. But he just...
Andromeda peered at the baby on the floor, eyes softening. "He's wonderful. It's rather lucky, though, that his mother was a metamorphmagus, too. This time, I'm a bit more prepared for it."
"Hey, hey..."
“Then what is?”
Furious tears stung his eyes as he laid there, wondering if any of it would have made a difference. What it all boiled down to was how enormous of a coward Draco really was.
Brows creasing, eyes bemused, Harry seems to tense fully for an instant just before his shoulders fall slack, and a strange sense of triumph flits through Draco when Harry goes to pick up his sandwich.
He hadn't forgotten, but Draco was still blown away with how green those eyes were.
“Bye bye!”
conversation. He can’t see Harry’s face in the darkness or with the angle, but Draco can hear a few small noises coming from him, as though Harry is wanting to say something but unable to find the proper words.
“Teddy’s wellbeing is the priority, Mr. Malfoy.”
And Draco loved him in return.
“Tire?”
these allegations had anything to them that law enforcement would obviously want to check it out, but the author never said that these things were actually happening."
“Wait, wanna-wanna stay!”
Karen glared at Draco until a single tear finally splashed onto her cheek. "Whatever. I was just leaving."
"Yes, Mother. I haven't had any issues."
Draco had almost forgotten that it was Potter who crouched there, Potter's hands that kept him from falling face-first into the floor. Potter's hands moved from his chest to his shoulders, holding him steady. Oddly enough, it wasn't as repulsive of a touch as he would have thought.
“No, definitely not,” Harry says, leaning forward. “Actually, we both talked about that specifically even before we agreed to room together. We...well, I’d say we’re getting on great all things considered.”
"I should hope so, considering the properties of the ingredients."
But when Teddy reached for something just beyond Harry's shoulder and was unable to snag it, his face screwed up tightly and he let out a very unhappy wail.
The Malfoy Manor was cold. It always had been, in that emotional sense that books spoke of, but as Draco locked his old school trunk, now fully packed, he could physically feel the chill pass through his bedroom. He straightened, rubbing circles into his sore back. He had been packing his trunk on and off for weeks, stopping for days at a time as he swayed between how bad of an idea he thought it was at the time. Draco collapsed onto his bed with a groan.
Guilt shot through Draco's heart like an arrow. "No, Mother, I-"
Not wanting to be rude, Harry simply nodded and Andromeda disappeared back into the kitchen, returning a moment later with a large tray in her arms.
"What has you looking so down?" Luna asked at dinner that evening. Draco had stopped asking her why she chose to sit with him at the meals he attended.
"What is it?"
have a good day.”
"Morning, Harry."
“I would certainly say so,” Ms. Dribble says. “Teddy, how are you liking it?”
Draco can’t blame him.
“Your narrow-mindedness about me is what will get us in trouble and cost us both Teddy,” Draco growls.
Weasley glared back as he, too, stood and drew his wand. "Which part? The part about you being a fame-hungry prat or the part about how worthless of a piece of rubbish Malfoy is?"
A sharp elbow digs into Harry’s thigh, jolting him back to the present.
“Please?”
“No. No baf.”
"But," Ron said loudly, "with how happy you two prats made each other, it was hard not to be okay with it. You were a sopping, depressed mess after the war."
The kitchen was alive with the smells and sounds of dinner, all of Harry's, Ron's, Ginny's, and Charlie's favorites as though Mrs. Weasley was determined to make each of them the guest of honor. It brought a lump deep in his throat watching Mrs. Weasley sweep about the room, setting dishes on the large table and running a shaking hand through her wild hair. Mr. Weasley and Charlie were already sitting, their amused but strained expressions making it clear that Mrs. Weasley wanted no help. Ron was only a few steps ahead of Harry, making his way to a chair.
Hermione had grabbed him by the arm, however, stopping him.
"Malfoy!"
“We had an early day,” Potter says with a quick rise of his shoulder. “What’s got your knickers in a bunch today? You’re more shrill than usual.”
Ron frowned. "Again?"
She patted his shoulder. "Not to worry, Mr. Malfoy. I'll be here if anything else is to happen, though I'd frankly rather you not need it."
“You think I don’t know that?” Malfoy sneers. “Meat is just expensive, in case you haven’t checked a price tag in the past two years. You can get protein and iron from other sources, too, you big oaf. Teddy’s getting what he needs, I can assure you, I’m just doing what I can to stretch my pay as far as I can this month, so shove off.”
“No.”
"Mr. Tuft, Mr. Martinez, Miss Campbell, Mr. Potter, and Mr. Weasley, you all will be on my left." Slughorn dropped the pile of parchment on his desk and rubbed his hands together. "Alright, now let's see how well you all brewed up some bliss, shall we?"
"Well, no," Draco admitted. He had returned to his own bed since Saturday night, and the sleeplessness had unfortunately returned. "But we both survived well enough on little sleep before. Why're you having trouble now?"
Alarmed, Harry whispered, "Hey, hey...I'm sorry, I didn't mean-"
There’s a definite sob then, distinctly different from the cries of a toddler not getting his way, and Harry and Malfoy return their attentions back to Teddy. Sitting next to the half-full tub with his arms around his knees, tears and snot covering his face, Teddy stares at them both, eyes darting between the two.
"You keep using that word, 'deserve'." Potter said. "But what makes you think that you're the only one who knows what people deserve?"
Panic flares in Harry’s chest, frigid and harsh. “No.”
"Hey, bewitcher!"
!" Josh's wand swiped between them, and Draco couldn't stop the gasp that escaped his lips when his robes were ripped at the chest, exposing his flesh enough to form another scratch.
Teddy grumbles, and when the seconds trickle into minutes, into lifetimes in the night, Draco assumes that the boy has accepted Harry’s plea. He returns to bed.
"But-"
For the first time in years, Draco's heart and lungs were working in perfect harmony without thought, giving him a clear mind. He had led his life nearly entirely in the service of pleasing another - his father, his fan-friends, the Dark Lord himself. When Draco had been left with no one to please, no one to seek affection from, the darkness of his own mind seemed to have sought to swallow him whole. His crimes had haunted him, his reason not allowing him to grasp at anyone to try and please once the dust settled on the Dark Lord's body, leaving him more a shell than a man.
The thought of catering to Potter’s ego is immensely nauseating. But it’s Draco’s reality.
“No, they’re not here,” Hermione says gently. “That’s what
Just as he had in Herbology the morning before, Malfoy was breathing strangely and seemed to be forcing himself not to bolt from the room. It wasn't at all the Malfoy Harry had known for seven years, and while a change from the pretentious and smug prat was nice, it didn't suit Malfoy to look so downright petrified in the safety of a Potions class.
Malfoy shook his head. "Not if you know what you're doing."
"She's a bitch."
Harry had Draco pinned against the wall of the Owlery, hands pulling Draco's arms above his head as passion brought their lips together. Near-silent moans mingled on their lips as Harry brought his body flush against Draco's, desperate for closeness that couldn't be satisfied. Backs of his hands against the frozen stone above their heads, Draco's fingers wrapped in Harry's as his tongue slid across the other's lips.
“I suppose. I do wish he ate more,” he admits with an uncertain laugh. Teddy often only eats a few bites of whatever he’s given. It drives Harry madder than he likes, not just watching the food go to waste but also being so certain that Teddy is going to starve on Harry's watch.
"Don't mention it."
"Puer Creaturae is currently listed as the third most complicated potion to exact, due that it literally creates a life."
"How is he?"
"Sorry," Malfoy said, voice slightly hoarse. "I didn't mean to bring that up. I...I didn't know."
“I suppose...” Harry turns back to Teddy. “Okay, you can stand, but you have to stay right here. No running off, okay?”
“I’m willing, too.”
“Are we really doing this?” Harry asks.
Harry nodded. "How...how is she?"
"Ugh," he groaned, pinching the bridge of his nose tenderly. He winced at the pain. Something wet bubbled within when he tried to breathe through his nose, and Draco opened his eyes to see blood drops on the floor in front of him.
"Well, maybe there doesn't have to always be conversation."
She scrunched up her face. "They're talking about boys."
Ms. Dribble cuts across him firmly. “I’ll be taking a look around the home first, thank you.”
“What? I don’t-”
"How's the Ministry handling everything these days, anyway, Dad?" Charlie asked.
“Please?” Harry squats and sets Teddy on his feet. “Can you pick up your toys for me, please?”
"Well, someone ought to, since you apparently think that this," Weasley again gestured furiously at Draco, "is anything but wrong."
It was Christmas morning. Draco had enjoyed a quiet coffee and muffin breakfast with his mother as the sun rose, but now they were preparing to go visit Andromeda and Teddy as it neared mid-morning. Draco figured that he ought to reply to Harry's letter and return the owl before they left.
But neither Harry nor Malfoy stood as Slughorn waddled away, instead opening their textbooks to find the recipe. The effects reminded Harry of some of the muggle creams that Aunt Petunia used to put on her face every evening. It didn't look terribly complicated except for a bolded note that, if not thickened correctly, the potion could cause wrinkles instead of removing them. At least it didn't look likely to explode all over them. Harry looked over at Malfoy.
That wasn't the reply Draco had been expecting. Those green eyes were set, completely void of any teasing or doubt. Draco blinked a few times, eyes feeling misty suddenly. It was late. He was tired. He didn't need to be having this conversation with this person at this hour.
For several seconds they simply stood there, Draco gasping for air and shaking pathetically against the corridor wall. Potter's hand remained on Draco's arm, holding him firm without being too tight.
Teddy just stares.
"Okay, no one who matters," Harry amended. "No one in the pub, for sure. I wish you'd have stayed a bit longer. No one thought Ron was in line with...with what he said. So please...don't. Ever."
“Your lease is up at the end of June, yes?”
“I suspect that Harry Potter feels much the same way about himself.”
“Then no real harm done. Children get hurt at parks every day. I’m sure she’s fine, and Teddy will be, as well.”
Chuckling to himself, Harry stepped outside.
"Well...if you're here and offering, it'd save me a hassle later if you could pick up some formula at the store down the road."
They seemed to freeze in time, their hands not quite ready to release one another. The high of orgasm made Harry smile like a fool on Draco's lips as they both panted into each other, gulping for air.
"No, but it hardly matters-"
“I can watch him while you’re working, you utter-”
"Focus," Potter whispered. "Focus on taking a deep breath. Breathe in, hold it a moment, then breathe out."
But then Draco fell in love with Teddy.
"Draco?"
Potter's face flushed. "I-that's not what I meant!"
Harry waited as Draco seemed to think it over, his hands gently running through Harry's hair. In the darkness, Harry unabashedly closed his eyes and savored the touch.
“I don’t need Potter’s help,” Draco clips out. “I can figure it out.”
Luna nodded, taking a bite of pork. "Yes, that is how it usually goes. Hermione told me what happened in Hogsmeade this weekend. Ron Weasley is rather cruel at times, isn't he?"
"Look," Ron slurred, sounding exasperated. "Mum's looking for you two. Thank Merlin I found you before she did...but just...ugh, just hurry it up and go find her, will you? I shouldn't be hunting you prats down at my own wedding."
But Harry just laughed as he kissed Draco again, pressing his hips downward, sliding their erections together once more, and Draco was left with no other choice but to give into the sensations that were setting his body on fire.
“En’ca’cas!” Teddy repeats happily as they breach the doorway. The smells aren’t unpleasant, and they hit full force then.
“He’s
A hiccup stopped the growing sobs for a moment, enough for Draco to finally lift his eyes to meet Harry's. Harry tried to offer a smile but Draco's lips only trembled as he began to cry again.
"Come on. Let's go have dinner, and then you can have your identity crisis in peace. It'll go better if you've got food in your stomach."
Harry watched as the barn owl stuck out its leg for Draco to carefully attach his letter. He gave the owl a few gentle strokes, then carried it one of the many windows, where it took to the wind. Draco stood there, watching it fly away.
Ron grins back as the lift lands and the doors open. “Brilliant.”
Teddy’s sweet voice punctures the silence, drawing Harry’s attention as two feet of energy slams into his knees. Harry stumbles a bit for it, finally collapsing into a seated position on the floor to accept the crazed embrace of a nearly-two-year-old Teddy Lupin.
Harry physically shook his head, taking another step back.
After seeing that Malfoy was going to be alright, McGonagall had spoken with Ron, Hermione, Neville, and Luna. Between their accounts and what the sixth years had told her themselves, McGonagall had initially given Conrad, Maddox, and Cooper a week's worth of detentions for being weak-willed bystanders. But the boys then had willingly confessed to a confrontation earlier in the year when they had held Malfoy down and apparently burned him repeatedly, so their detentions extended to a month and they had lost all their Hogsmeade privileges for the year.
Malfoy didn't answer, eyes downcast. Feeling brave, Harry took another tiny step closer directly into Malfoy's personal space. Harry reached up with his free hand and gently bumped Malfoy's chin, silently requesting those eyes. Confusion, sorrow, and fear swam there, breaking Harry's heart.
Nodding, Harry goes to her, leaving Teddy, whose cries are beginning to shift from angry to upset, on the bed. He grinds his knuckles into his eyes once, twice, three times. “Yeah, I think I’m just going to wait it out. I don’t know what’s wrong with him. I don’t think he’s ever hit someone like that before.”
Like he didn't know that already, Harry thought bitterly.
“No!”
Teeth clenching with the force to crack them, Draco exhales sharply through his nose. Chase isn’t wrong; Draco has never wanted his hatred for the beloved Boy Who Lived to be psychoanalyzed beyond repair. But things with Potter are changing. Novel civility aside, he and Potter are loosely wound together for the next year and change, and Chase knows it. It makes sense that the healer would want to revisit the topic at a new angle, try to worm into Draco's psyche however he can.
Heads swiveled and whispers erupted when Draco walked into the Great Hall some ten minutes later, after making sure he took his time coming up from the dungeons. It wasn't unexpected, but Draco still felt the familiar trickle of unease as he searched for a seat far out of the way. He dropped into an empty seat that had plenty of space on all sides. Relieved to have sound relative solitude, he began adding bits of stew to his bowl. He grabbed a roll and took a small spoonful of stewed beef into his mouth, stomach rumbling appreciatively.
Draco shakes his head with a scoff. “No living creature accidentally starves to death. He’s going to be fine.”
Draco signs his name on the register scroll. “Yes,” he says stiffly. After a hesitation, he adds, “Good afternoon.”
"Dammit, Harry,
“So,” he starts when he swallows, “how’s married life?”
Granger spoke first, the casualness sounding incredibly forced. "So, Malfoy. Er...Draco." She licked her lips and glanced at Weasley, whose eyes grew wide. "I saw you go into Tomes and Scrolls. Do you, uh, did you find what you were looking for?"
. But even so, Draco shook his head sadly.
“Er...” Harry brings Teddy to his side by one hand, fingers tight around his wrist. “I-I-I thought this was a slide, wasn’t it?”
“I look forward to seeing that, Harry,” Mr. Cook says, smile widening. He stands then, gesturing toward the door. “Now, I need to draw up the paperwork for you to sign, but in the meantime, you’re welcome to see Teddy in the waiting room. I suspect he and Mr. Malfoy are finished speaking with my partner by now.”
With so much time on his hands before lessons, Draco had taken a long, hot bath before making his way down to breakfast. It wasn't his usual meal, but Draco was feeling particularly good.
“Yes, dear.”
After the overwhelmingly emotional and draining mess that was the chaos of the day, Harry was immensely glad to be confined to the tiny space of the threstal carriage with Ron, Hermione, Neville, and Luna.
"So that makes this, what, your fifth time to read this thing?" Ron asked.
Success.
"Of course, Draco. We're friends, after all. What are friends for?"
“Why couldn’t I just not have been raised to be a monster?”
She put her hands on her hips. "Yeah, but I only started knocking because you weren't answering me. I called your name many times!"
The Potters’ brows furrow, lips all turning down even more. “What’s gotten into you?”
"Now, with the formalities out of the way, let us begin a new year!" Professor McGonagall called, sitting down rather abruptly.
There’s a beat of silence as the three of them simply look at one another. It’s Ms. Dribble’s brittle voice that breaks the moment.
It caught Draco off guard, the genuine concern in Potter's voice. For a moment, he couldn't think of what to say, instead trying not to focus too much on how his leg was still resting on Potter's. When he found that he couldn't, Draco asked, "So how am I supposed to get out of here without causing an enormous scene?"
Beer is supposed to make one sleepy, Draco thinks as he stares at the clock in his kitchen. It’s nearing ten o’clock, there are three empty bottles of Kindle Hops on the tabletop, and Draco is still riding an anxiety-driven high that’s threatening to fully consume him. All he wants is to sleep and work, sleep and work, with no time to think in between.
“Too right!” Mr. Cook says enthusiastically, waving Potter into his office once more. “Come along, Harry, and we can make this quick.”
The panic that had flared briefly in Draco's chest dissolved and he reached up to smack the back of Harry's head. "You prat."
It’s a phenomenally brilliant Saturday morning.
Potter, sicking a skinny little Ravenclaw to act as his bodyguard. Technically, Draco could believe it, but the audacity of it was utterly mortifying. He downed the rest of his cup and set it on the table hard.
At eighteen past, Potter finally shows up, Teddy on his hip and the small blue backpack slung over his opposite shoulder. Appearing just as harried and tired as ever, Potter stumbles on the foot rug just in side the department’s door.
"Come on," he said softly. "Let's go warm up properly."
"No, but he's been trying to keep me from making any friends in Slytherin, trying to set me up with first years in his own House." She sighed. "They're alright, but I know what they think of me...besides, I don't think Slytherins are nearly as bad as Josh has always told me. I like the kids in our House."
Draco was rapidly becoming overly aware of how close they were. Barely a foot separated their faces, their hips smashed together, and Draco's leg was resting over Potter's thigh beneath the blankets. As Draco breathed as quietly as he could, he could smell Potter everywhere. It was overwhelming, and it was overwhelming how much Draco was
"Harry?"
Malfoy scoffed softly. "They have every reason, Potter."
That anxiety is back.
At the top, Harry found Malfoy on the ground.
"Look, I-"
He fell forward and smacked the wall to catch himself, sending an echoing slap reverberating up the tower.
Harry Apparates them to the only park he knows about in London, a muggle one that sits between his old flat and the grocers he used to frequent. It’s large and almost always busy, making it easy for him to conceal or hide any magic Teddy might let slip in the chaos. Harry hasn’t been back in a few weeks, as he and Teddy have been enjoying the open grassy area outside their building lately. They both take a deep inhale of the playground’s smells the moment they arrive, concealed partially by a large rosebush. Stepping from its safety, Teddy’s face lights up at the intricate, wooden structure with metal attachments, his entire body quivering with excitement at Harry’s side. He gives Teddy a nudge, releases his hand, then watches as he vanishes among the other children.
