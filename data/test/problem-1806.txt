“Probably, yea.” Harry smiles, small and awkward. “Sex proves difficult when you’d rather not be naked.”
When Draco stands up to greet him, Harry notices how long and lean his legs are in his burgundy trousers.
“Can I suck your cock?” he asks, already sinking down to his knees. There’s nothing he wants more than that cock in his mouth. The fact that he’ll be able to stay fully clothed is an added bonus.
As he returns back to himself, Draco looks absolutely debauched, from kiss-swollen lips to the two coatings of come. There’s now no indication that his hair was ever in a braid.
They’re soon settled at the table, each with their hands wrapped around a warm mug of tea. Harry allows himself a moment to drink in the details that are Draco. The hair in the messy plait, the skin that’s as pale as it’s ever been. He looks slightly different today, and it takes Harry a while to realise that it must be due to the absence of any gold thread. Finally, he lets his gaze linger on the expanse of skin exposed by the deep v of Draco’s dressing gown.
Instead of resuming their kiss, Draco turns his attention to the fly on Harry’s jeans, making quick work of it. As Harry’s fingers encircle Draco’s cock through his sweatpants, Draco’s own hand delves inside Harry’s underwear. His fingers instantly find their way to the nub that is Harry’s dick. He kisses Harry as he begins to rub it. Pleasure blooms through Harry, and it isn’t long until he’s rocking against Draco’s fingers. His grip on Draco’s cock loosens, his hand moving to the arm of the chair instead, allowing easier movement.
Harry tried to buy himself some time by focussing all his attention on his coffee. He’d known he was bisexual for a while. When Ginny broke up with him, telling him that she was a lesbian, it had caused him to do his own introspection. While he’d told all his friends, he’d never felt the need to announce it to the world.
The kissing resumes. Harry runs an idle hand over Draco’s cock. They press their own against Draco’s thigh, while fae tongues at their earlobe.
Harry slips away from his conversation partners, heading in Draco’s direction. It’s slow going; he keeps getting waylaid by people asking inane questions. But he’s closer now.
Harry had figured as much, he just hasn’t gotten that far yet. Still he takes that as some kind of admonishment, tugging Draco’s underwear down in one fell swoop. As Draco steps out of them, Harry eyes his cock, which is even more tantalisingly gorgeous than he could have hoped. The moment that Draco has both feet on the floor again, Harry has his mouth on his cock, relishing the feeling. With his hand holding the base steady, Harry quickly sets up a rhythm, pushing himself slightly further than he can handle, just for the way it grounds him in his body.
Ron smiles placatingly. "I'm aware of that, too. But wasn't it you who said that you think Malfoy and Harry share ownership of the Elder Wand because no disarming spell was used at all?"
Harry folded his arms across his chest and tried to look as challenging as Draco, he failed and probably looked more like a lovesick, defiant fool. "A few
It is not until Christmas Eve that peace returns to the Weasley house. All the children and family members have taken up residence in the small rooms, made themselves comfortable and are finally enjoying meeting each other again in perfect harmony. There is the usual family hubbub, something that is probably unavoidable when belonging to the Weasleys, but nothing that could spoil anyone's mood.
I wanted to scream in his face that he was not the one to demand answers. He was the convict, the Death Eater, the coward. It was he who knew the names of the wizards who were guilty of countless atrocities. By refusing to answer me, he was only helping to perpetuate the evil in the world. The thought flashed through my mind that Malfoy likely did not care. He was just a bad person who did not care about the welfare of others.
It comes as little surprise to Harry that his life is too mundane for Ginny's liking. It was the reason that their relationship ended and even though they only joke about it now, it affected Ginny badly for a long time. At the time, she was still convinced she could change Harry. But it does not work like that, they both know that by now.
Mr Malfoy's gaze fell on Draco's hair. He pursed his lips as if to say something. There was a glint of reproof in his otherwise vacant eyes. "Interesting coiffure."
It was a need for consummate closeness in a physical way that urged us on. Which led me to rub my fingertip over the skin on Draco's puckered hole, to catch his contented sigh and ease my fingers, one after the other, inside him. Everything was happening agonisingly slowly and yet the sensation was already far too much. It was too hot, too close and still not nearly enough.
No matter the weather, Harry conquers his weaker self every morning and jogs his usual lap around the block. It is long enough to waken his circulation for the day and yet concise enough not to be tempted to complain about the weather. At eight o'clock he treats himself to a hot shower and fifteen minutes later he turns on the old stereo and sets the breakfast table.
The Sleeping Draught had also been a stupid idea, it had apparently had little effect on Draco, considering how agile he had been the next day. Besides, Harry hadn’t gotten the opportunity to steal the ring unobtrusively. He had the ring, but that was only due to his unrestrained luck. It was a mystery in itself that Draco hadn’t noticed.
Jimar makes a vague gesture with his hand. "I quit, but they would have sacked me anyway. Both the hospital and –" He falters and shrugs. "You know."
When Harry once more thrust his tongue particularly deep in Draco, he moaned and pushed Harry away using his foot. "Fucking hell, if you don't put your dick inside me in the next ten seconds, I’ll –"
Before I got the chance to actually open the door, I caught the sound of a suppressed coughing behind me. In an instant, I turned on my heel and stared into the face of a dapper wizard who radiated something completely different than reluctance and hatred.
“Can I ask you something, Harry?” Hermione took a more serious tone. Harry fiddled with his sleeve, but nodded and looked at Hermione, waiting. “Have you ever thought about whether these positive feelings for Malfoy only come from this ‘
He remembers being told that the Aurors had thoroughly examined Malfoy's diary. Surely a part of Malfoy's soul would be apparent in such an examination. Harry cannot completely shake off his doubts; Ginny has awakened a suspicion in him that runs too deep for comfort. However, he is determined not to rush into any decisions and to wait and see. Even if that requires quite a bit of strength from him.
"Nice to finally meet you, Draco." Sirius smiled broadly and shook Draco's hand, who looked as if he would like to wring Harry's neck, but at the same time not present a bad first impression of himself. "Now let the poor animal out of the car," he added, addressing Harry.
“Couldn’t it be that you just imagined it? Out of shock, because of this strange creature you were talking about?” Ron wondered. He'd even stopped eating.
Jimar sighs. "That they'll send you a letter at New Year, politely expressing the gratitude of the Ministry and the Hospital, and then you'll be released from your assistance."
his imprisonment, and instead looks firmly at Mr Potter, who is still staring spellbound at the brass plate. Or rather at the "Draco Malfoy" engraved on the plate.
Harry had to fight hard with himself to not give free rein to his anger. Where this instinct to defend Draco came from, he didn't even want to know.
“Maybe it was a good thing that I annoyed you at the lake,” Harry thought aloud and just couldn’t stop himself from grinning.
"What – What are you doing?" Harry's throat was dry as dust, and the question was about as gullible as he looked.
My thoughts spun incoherently in my mind and I frantically tried to organise them. There were indications and connections, but I could not figure out how they fit together.
Draco’s smile widened unintentionally, then he raised one hand and brushed a strand of hair from Harry’s eyes. “Well, your longstanding wish to get me into bed was granted. Persistence suits you better than I thought.”
Harry raised his eyebrows. Draco seemed quite willing. "Don’t tell me you're done sulking and let me?"
On Wednesday evening, Harry heard another student talk about Draco’s upcoming birthday for the first time. It was a Ravenclaw of their age who speculated whether a party would be thrown. The experience reminded Harry that he was behaving more than selfishly. Draco’s birthday was less than two weeks away and all he thought about was that he couldn’t deal with the feelings Draco was causing in him. It was all pretty damn irrelevant, considering the fact that Draco was on the verge of his human demise.
“Yes, it’s just... I –” Draco faltered and raised his head, which had just been pushed into the pillow.
Harry simply put up with the lewd comments. Accompanied by his two best friends, he walked straight towards the Great Hall. He really didn’t have the nerve to worry about anything else but that he had to face Draco in just a minute, so he didn’t even get angry with the gapers. Ron, however, hexed anyone who squinted in their direction for even half a second too long. The fact that he was pretty quickly out of breath from hexing continuously only confirmed Harry’s theory that by now all of Hogwarts must know.
Seven o'clock in the morning, the beeping of an alarm clock just wouldn't stop and something warm and massive made it hard for Harry to breathe freely. He braced himself against the something and not a second later there was a rumble and "Ouch!", but at least Harry was able to breathe again.
For the rest of the drive, no one says a word, except for Jimar's quiet curses whenever the left-hand traffic troubles him. Harry just continues to hold Draco's hand, constantly shooting him appraising glances or watching the lights of the cars they pass. It feels strangely definitive to see Draco outside his small room. The question blossoms in Harry's mind whether Draco is even aware of his newfound freedom, and whether he will ever be able to appreciate how much was risked to save him.
Encouragingly, Hermione patted Harry’s hand as she thoughtfully drew her brows together. “The only thing different that night was that Malfoy didn’t wear his ring. Didn’t you say that the ring holds the condition of the curse? If the ring is missing, the condition is also missing! That’s it!"
"How –" he starts hastily, but is too exhausted to find any more words. Instead, he holds Draco by the wrist and pulls his hand close to his chest.
Draco now looked even more stressed and tried to free his wrist from the grip, Harry was smart enough not to let that happen. “Let go of me!” he demanded, Harry knew that Draco had the power to make him do it, so he loosened his grip just a little. To free himself, Draco pulled his hand out of Harry’s grip, which was loose, but not
Harry's gaze fell on Draco's lips, so soft, so beautiful, so perfect. He looked back into Draco's eyes, which looked at him waiting. Draco was looking for something. He was looking for the one thing Harry needed right now. He sought the wrong thing. He shouldn't have been looking for the Something. He should have been looking for the One. But neither of them knew that at that very moment.
Draco grimaced while he tilted his head thoughtfully. "Does he have another birthday present in case he chickens out like he did the last five times? Hurray to Hermione's patience, I'd have dumped him for all his cowardice long ago!"
The Aurors, who know for a fact that Azkaban is not such a place, but who, unlike Anja, advocate the concept much more readily, remain silent. Silence is what allows this place to remain.
Harry placed his lips on Draco's forehead and closed his eyes to remind himself to stay calm. "Now you just have to forgive yourself."
Robards' sympathy is appropriate, as Harry learns the following evening at his weekly dinner at his best friends' house. Hermione does not participate, she is working overtime at St Mungo's Hospital, so Ron tells him the news.
The Aurors, exchanging a look under Mr Potter's gaze, decide to take the diplomatic approach, which is not necessarily honest, Anja finds. "Each wizard has their own magical signature that distinguishes us from each other and makes identification easier. In your training days, all forms of identification were recorded and put on paper, of course," Filly explains.
There was something wonderfully tender about the scene, something I did not know from my own mother because she had been denied the chance to give it to me. Draco seemed like a boy again, despite the fact that he had to be fifteen or sixteen years old in this memory.
The following Wednesday is the first of March and thus Ron's birthday. Disagreements are set aside and forgotten for the day. Harry bakes a two-tier cake, with Draco contributing with the icing, and decorates the dining area of the kitchen with a tacky garland congratulating Ron on his fiftieth birthday, about which Ron is delightfully entertained.
It is peak-activity time. The lights in most of the patients' rooms have not yet been turned off. Relatives, friends and loved ones are crowding around the beds of the sick and await the new year full of anticipation. The mood is exuberant, no one wastes a thought on visiting hours or similar regulations.
“Goyle's a joke. It's like wanting to have sex with a pet or a house-elf!” Harry made it short with the last candidate. This time the list had been processed much faster, all for nothing. None of the three even remotely suited Draco.
Harry has asked Ron to keep their conversation to himself for the time being – since Hermione's pregnancy, he has felt positively obliged to go easy on Hermione in every possible way. Harry notices that Ron's loyalty is not limited to Harry and that Ron prefers to do what he thinks is wisest when he sits opposite Hermione and Ron at dinner and they exchange one of their love-vows glances. When Hermione then clears her throat and makes a serious face, Harry becomes fully aware that this dinner serves a purpose.
Softly, a light gleamed around Draco. He clawed a hand into his shirt, just above his heart, and gasped heavily. Not a second later, the light extinguished again and Draco clung to the side of the basin, searching for support and fighting back tears.
Harry and Draco took their time on the way to Hogsmeade. It wasn’t dark yet, thanks to the long evenings of the summer, so it didn’t feel as if curfew was about to begin. Draco didn’t say much, neither did Harry. The silence was a bit strange but surprisingly pleasant in spite of everything. Draco’s cool hand in Harry’s made the situation even more bearable than it already was.
“It doesn’t change much,” Draco tells him. “I try to avoid gendered words like man and son, but that’s about it. I haven’t settled on new pronouns yet.”
Harry thinks for a moment, remembers what it feels like to be on a broom. The sensation of racing through the air, the wind on his face. The weightlessness. The freedom. He smiles. “Yea, that’s a pretty good feeling.”
“So fucking hot,” Draco tells him, continuing to fuck him all the way through his orgasm. “Gonna make me come too.”
As Draco removes faer hand, Harry pushes the rest of the way into Draco’s mouth. As their balls come to rest against Draco’s chin, they place their hands in Draco’s hair, threading their fingers through the blond strands. As Draco’s eyes begin to water, Harry slides their cock out of faer mouth before pushing back in. They set a slow pace, fucking Draco’s mouth, as Draco sucks and hums in greedy appreciation.
“Oh.” Harry’s feeling relieved, but this new information is also making him curious. “Your gold thread,” he asks, “is that also magic?”
“You gonna fuck me?” Draco asks. Fae breaks away from the kiss, getting up from the bed. By the time fae is on faer hands and knees in front of the mirror, fae has removed faer trousers and pants. “Merlin’s sake, Harry, hurry up.”
The metal steps floated smoothly past him and up high. Perhaps all the way to the clouds. Perhaps all the way to hell.
!" Ginny smirked as she got out of the car. Molly Weasley, mother of Ron and Ginny, just opened the passenger door and gave Ginny a withering look that silenced the young woman. The fact that Ginny’s pestering possibly motivated Harry to speed went against the grain of the round woman. That Harry even owned a scooter and was allowed to ride it was only thanks to Sirius and his impressive power for persuasion. So instead of continuing to annoy Harry, Ginny and her mother set about unloading their luggage.
And Harry kissed Draco, shoved a hand to the back of the blond's neck, pushed himself off the wall to press his body against Draco's. The latter sighed as if he had waited too long for it, slid his free hand into Harry's hair and applied more pressure on Harry's fingers around his erection.
McGonagall would not only kill him but also expose him in front of the whole class, Gryffindors and Slytherins alike. Ron had tried to wake him up three times before he had given up. A treacherous decision, at least Harry thought so. And now he hadn't even had breakfast.
But Nellie is very much herself. She straightens her back, snatches the cleaning rag from Harry's hands and wipes across one of the window ledges as she flashes him a placating smile. "I'd probably go back, yes. Because if I hadn't been there that night, seven other children might have lost their lives too. I can't find peace when I feel like I'm not healing someone even though I could."
, it might have been a little late for that. And there was still this irrepressible need to kiss Draco again, which he could hardly suppress. How much of it was the charm and how much of it was himself, he left mentally uncommented.
Harry’s steps became faster, echoing loudly off the stone walls. Some paintings looked around in surprise, but no one showed themselves to them. If a teacher had been out, they would have heard Harry coming directly, but that didn’t matter to him at the moment. He was not known for his brilliant ideas, so far they had all gone wrong. His first flop idea had almost cost him his life. To make it even better, here he was returning to the monster that had almost killed him.
"She had a seizure out of nowhere. Sirius took her straight to the vet. They're examining her now. He'll be in touch as soon as he knows more."
.” He looked up at Draco's face. The light hair fell stubbornly on his face, his cheeks flushed. He pushed his lower lip forward a little bit and frowned. Hell, he would
"Yes, I can smell it," uttered Draco, who scrunched his nose and stubbornly looked straight ahead at the gravel path.
I loathed the fact that I was so transparent. I especially detested that it was Malfoy who managed to read me so easily. Still – he was not entirely wrong. I was aware that I would not get an answer if I did not bring myself to simply ask my questions.
"If the fall is so severe that I break both my legs from it, then a mobile phone will most likely not survive either," Draco replied, lowering his head to look at his fingernails. His high ponytail bounced as he moved and a few strands came loose from it.
"Merlin have mercy on you, boy," Madam Pomfrey gasped in horror, and in the next second summoned a vial labelled
would Draco tell anyone else? Was he out for revenge? For the kiss? Or the ring stealing? He looked very human at the moment, meaning he must have got it back, the waterspirit had kept his word. But why he was now the number one topic of conversation among the Slytherins, he didn’t know.
"I like men." Oh, wow. Draco's mental slap hurt him deservedly. That was probably the stupidest subject he could have come up with. "And my father wishes I wouldn't." Well,
The lake lay dark and smooth in front of Harry, who came to a halt at the same place where he had previously watched Draco and where he himself had almost been killed. Shaking off the memory, Harry gazed over the surface of the water glistening in the moonlight, but nothing happened. No waterspirit appeared, no gurgling – everything remained calm and gave Harry a moment of peace. He almost changed his mind, went back to the castle and respected Draco's wish, but his resolve to get answers led him to stay and he cleared his throat audibly.
to Harry that he wouldn't even dare say. He also wore tight dark jeans and a loose white top, which was cut just right to show off his collarbone and drive Harry half crazy. Had Draco not been besieged by Pansy, he probably would have dragged him into a dark corner. It also helped that Seamus handed out the first round of drinks.
“Good morning!” Harry greeted the Slytherin a little too cheerfully, but he had been awake a few moments longer than Draco. Draco moaned softly and dropped his forehead against Harry’s shoulder. “You drool in your sleep,” Harry informed him happily.
When on Wednesday evening the dinner with Hermione and Ron is cancelled, as the mood is too gloomy to fuel it unnecessarily, Harry casts
"Viktor Krum. He's quite a well-known show rider, but not much older than us. Draco met him at a championship and they got to know each other, that’s why he spent a summer here two years ago. Since then, he has been showing up here from time to time. He's a pleasant company and has given me quite valuable riding tips," Blaise answered emphatically unconcernedly. Both Hermione and Draco kept quiet and were suddenly very interested in their respective plates.
“Even though the waterspirits were deprived of the ability to walk on land, they still possessed enough magic to cast an eternal curse on the blood of the wizarding family. The curse was intended to ensure that those affected became the enemy of their own relatives. So they became waterspirit-like beings. The curse was to plunge the family into tragedy, which it did at first, but the wizarding society continued to develop, and the war with the waterspirits was increasingly forgotten. Those affected by the curse learned to deal with their fate and thus ended the disruption within the family.” Draco paused. He didn't seem to want to tell anymore.
"Who are we talking about?" Ron asked, sitting next to Blaise as usual and reached across the table for a roll. The daily morning routine was as hard after days as it had been on the first.
"You mean 'pardon’," Draco corrected and placed his foot back on Pansy's lap. "You wanted to know where I was when I missed the riding lesson, right?"
The answer seems obvious. Azkaban changes people, of course, it does. But how is it possible that it just erases an entire personality, an entire charm? Harry does not want to believe that the part of Malfoy he does not consider loathsome has simply been obliterated.
Harry moaned, his eyes closed, his hands found Draco's thighs and eagerly moved up and down. It didn't take long before it became clearly too tight in Harry's trousers, he felt the smug smile on Draco's lips, but the hunger in him made him forget to be embarrassed. Instead, he kissed Draco properly, gave in to the game of their tongues and desperately tried not to think about Draco's hand on his crotch.
Uncertainly Harry looked up from his feet again. Draco had turned away a bit. He held on to his wand, no longer crossing his arms, just gazed indefinitely at a medium-sized spider in the corner above the front door, sitting calmly in its web without moving.
Harry was pretty sure that Draco and him were the only wizards who chose each other's masturbation activities as a cover-up story, but it seemed to work out fine. At least now he knew that Draco was reasonably well and he didn't want to talk to Harry about it. Basically, he knew as much as he did before, but he was good at pretending it was different.
Harry’s nervousness rose – his palms became sweaty, his heart was pounding faster once again, and he became a little dizzy while watching Draco read the letter with concentration. Draco just had to say
"If I'd had feelings for him, it wouldn't have made my actions any better, but at least it would have justified them. But I didn't and she knew that. She held everything against me. Every mistake, every decision, every silly grin, every lie. She held my entire personality against me. It was like a slap in the face and at the same time, I could see myself clearly for the first time. Not in my own world, where I was always right, but in reality. In the eyes of my friends."
Something tightens its grip around Harry's hand and forces him to pause. "Tomorrow. Tomorrow I'll like lemon tartlets."
"The diary won't save me." Draco wrapped his hand around my roaming fingers. "It will grant me more time, that's all."
Draco cocked an eyebrow, turned his head towards Harry and smiled innocently. "I don't know what you’re talking about."
Draco closes his eyes in agony. "I was always doomed to die early. Somewhere in one of the cells in Azkaban, amongst the stench of blood and urine, I made peace with that. That I'm still here wasn't meant to be."
"Well, we're roommates. I could hardly defend myself if you tried to strangle me in my sleep. If I remember correctly you–" Harry began but was furiously interrupted by Ron.
Malfoy's jaw cracked barely audibly, but he did not move an inch from the spot. "Then why did you do it?"
"It's just a theory, but it's a lot more plausible than you sharing a magical signature with Malfoy," she explains, then taps a page in the book in her hand. "It's an exceedingly rare phenomenon and as of yet I'm not entirely sure how it came about, but all the signs suggest that you’re sharing wands."
But Draco cut him off. “Calm down. I don’t actually feel the need to eat them, I prefer to leave that to those born as waterspirits. I’m getting more of a murderous urge instead.” Harry swallowed and an uneasy feeling came over him. “As disgusting as it sounds, that’s normal for the cursed. I can’t resist it, just try to ignore it as long as I can. These desires are deeply rooted in the nature of the waterspirits and are part of the curse. I can still fight them, but it gets harder the closer my birthday comes.”
"What's up with her?" Harry asks, turning to Ron, who just shrugs boredly and adds the sliced courgettes to the simmering pot on the hob. He appears to have given up on questioning Hermione's mood swings.
It already costs Harry every effort to permit Draco his space and time to gather his thoughts and reach a decision that he can stand behind, but the nature of Draco’s looks renders him weak. Stoutly, he fights the urge to ask Draco one more time about last night. But when the melancholy does not fade even as Draco settles down on the couch next to Harry, as he does most evenings, and looks at him expectantly, he can no longer contain himself.
Slowly, tentatively and carefully, Harry felt long fingers feel his hair, only to reach their destination on his cheek. Harry's skin burned under the touch, his breath became inexorably faster.
His exhalation had probably been a little louder than planned, because Draco opened his eyes instantly and looked around frantically in the supposedly empty bathroom. Again, Harry recognized the gills on Draco's neck, but before he could think of stepping even closer, Draco's eyes fell on him.
With his heart pounding and his prick begging for attention, Harry crawled back up to Draco’s eye level and allowed himself the sight for a moment. Through the thin film of sweat, Draco’s skin shone in the torches’ light, his breaths came quickly, calmed down only slowly, his mouth was slightly open and his hair was tousled. A light red shimmer adorned his cheeks, which could also be found on the swollen lips, hell, for this sight, Harry gladly accepted jaw pain.
"Don't be shy," Draco said amusedly, but then came closer and gave Harry a leg-up, while at the same time holding Katla by the lead rope. Draco was much stronger than he looked, so Harry sat on the back of the pony less than five seconds later. To keep his balance, Harry reached into the dark mane of the horse. Meanwhile, Draco wiped his palms on Harry's jodhpurs. Harry almost wheezed at the touch but remembered just in time what was within the rules of etiquette.
Harry shakes his head uncomprehendingly. That is impossible, Jimar works for the Ministry. Not to mention that he is one of the most cordial people Harry has ever met. "There must be some sort of mistake. Jimar would never ..." Harry breaks off, but continues to shake his head.
Something warm and beautiful woke Harry the next morning. Plus his arm hurt because of something heavy which seemed to be lying on it. Warm, beautiful and heavy. Harry smiled even before he opened his eyes because he knew exactly who that was next to him. Warm, beautiful, heavy and human! Those were clearly Draco’s bare legs against his. With a wildly beating heart, Harry opened his eyes and looked down at the blond shock of hair in his arm.
If Harry thought about it, Draco would probably get it later rather than sooner, but Harry didn’t lack patience as long as he could dive into the sight of Draco in the meantime. And he did. Even though he felt more than insane to walk along the path next to the blond and look at him as if he had never seen a human before.
They return to their old routines, still paying regular visits to Number Twelve Grimmauld Place, but they grow fewer. Harry thinks they notice Draco engaging more with Harry and so their presence is no longer all that necessary, but Harry feels more burdened with each dead end they meet. Only Nellie's visits, during which he is assured that Draco's loss of magic continues to be gradual, soothe his strained mind – he has time on his hands.
turn back now. No, he would not listen to his heart beating way too fast in his chest or to the tugging in the pit of his stomach that was telling him to get the hell out of there as fast as he could.
“Do you want to go to the fifth floor tonight?” Harry didn’t know why he asked the question, but his need to ensure Draco’s safety and well-being pushed him to do so. He didn’t even know why he was asking a question in the first place, especially this very question after an eternity of silence. Though he knew Draco suffered physical pain if he neglected his mer-creature form for too long, officially, Harry didn’t know that Draco hadn’t gone to the Prefects’ Bathroom last night but had stayed in his bed. Yes, only the unofficial part of his mind that kept searching the Marauder’s Map for Draco knew about it.
Draco's hands explored Harry's back, stroking along his spine, pulling him closer, so that Harry eventually lay between Draco's legs. One hand on Draco's hips, the other travelled along Draco's thighs, Harry just let himself dissolve. His hips moved as if by magic against Draco who picked up the movement and responded. Harry moaned, interrupted the kiss to concentrate only on the sweet friction. Draco's hot breath brushed against his lips, Harry buried his nose in the crook of Draco's neck. He smelled of vanilla and something floral, Harry greedily inhaled the scent.
,” said the waterspirit in its deep, rumbling voice, which nevertheless echoed silkily and denied Draco an answer of his own.
And Harry wanted to, pressed his lips against Draco's and just let himself float in the nothingness for a few moments. Not a thought haunted his mind, only Draco mattered. And when he broke away from the kiss, and they turned to walk, Harry felt alive again.
“So it would be perfectly all right with you if I told you that I would like nothing better than to rip your clothes off? How seductive you look in your trunks, but even more seductive without any clothes? How I would love to touch you,
My fist burned and Malfoy stumbled back from the force of the blow. His face was twisted in pain and my chest constricted unpleasantly.
But because Draco took his time, spreading only feather-light kisses on Harry's belly and letting his hand do the work, Harry remembered that a bare arse could actually be a beautiful view. So he cumbersomely pushed the black shorts to Draco's knees and sighed at the sight.
Madam Pomfrey came hurrying towards them as soon as Snape and Draco crossed the threshold, behind which the familiar, spacious hospital ward appeared. Snape briefly informed her of Draco's condition but disappeared as soon as he had helped to hoist Draco onto one of the beds.
Harry stubbornly keeps his eyes straight ahead as he hurries down the corridors of the second floor, the
Harry nods and hums in confirmation. He remembers vaguely that Dumbledore was a great supporter of Nellie's dream of becoming a Healer and always encouraged her in it. In fact, if he is not mistaken, it was he who helped her to pursue the training, even though it went against her family's wishes.
"Unbelievable, Draco, you’re unbelievable," Harry breathed completely beside himself, his hands gliding over the lace as if on their own, tracing the embroidered swirls. Red suited Draco, it flattered his lips, his cheeks, his body. "Hell, I love you!"
Suddenly, Draco's face cleared up and an amused smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. "It's good to know you're actually listening to me, Potter. And
Knowing Draco was watching each of Harry's steps over his shoulder, Harry let one hand slowly slide over the soft muscle and rolled the condom over his own erection. He had all the time in the world and he would take Draco apart here and now, make him whimper, Harry bit his lip so as not to moan. Then he sank to his knees behind Draco and wished, once again, to be able to enjoy the sight clearly. But his imagination helped and maybe it wasn't bad that Harry didn't get to see the full picture. He might have given up instantly and surrendered to his own desires.
"I'll do my utmost," he manages to say, rising from his chair at the same time as Robards. "Thank you for your time."
“Do you believe me, Harry?” Draco asked into the kiss, but Harry forgot that he was supposed to answer. Instead, he grabbed Draco’s hip to pull him even closer to himself, no blade should fit between them anymore, only Draco’s body against his and the wet lips on his own. It’s all Harry wanted.
"Only if they catch me," Jimar interrupts her lightly. "I've quit my job and there's nothing else keeping me in England. If I get the chance to pay off my debt before I leave, I intend to do so."
Draco sighed comfortably, wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and, without interrupting the kiss, climbed onto the bed so that he knelt in front of the still-standing Harry to stay at eye level with him. There Harry had the kneeling Draco he had wished for, but he didn’t look as if he was going to complete Harry’s inner plan. Without further ado, Harry decided to take action and pushed Draco further onto the mattress to be able to climb onto the bed himself.
Harry deliberately disregards the comment and proceeds with the facts. "To gain more time, I need the diary. It contains, in a sense, magic reserves I can transfer to Draco. It's risky but doable."
It had all started with a trip through Europe. Alone, he had hiked along the Atlantic coasts of France, Spain and Portugal, spending nights under the stars in secluded coves, with nothing but the sound of the ocean and the screech of seagulls in his ears for days on end. Eventually, he had returned by order of the Ministry, cut short his eight-week trip to five and travelled back to England.
“Next time we’ll go to a wine tasting, maybe that will meet your standards!” With this, Harry clinked his glass against Draco’s and emptied the glass at one swallow. The liquid burned Harry’s mouth and throat and made him cough up in a frenzy while he felt his stomach already rebelling. Draco’s facial expression resembled Harry’s very much, which made him laugh throatily.
Draco's mouth stood slightly open, his cheeks now tinted in bright red, his eyebrows furrowed, but his eyes glowed with such intensity that it drove Harry half-mad. Draco was speechless and Harry's heart turned somersaults because it had never felt so free before.
"Fortunately, yes," Blaise replied. "Feykir was the reason why Draco defied his father's word for the first time."
Draco understood, stared at him perplexed for a few seconds, then he seemed to gather himself, rolled his eyes and reached for his quill again. “No, and I would be obliged if you would stop worrying about my ‘tennis activities’. Unless this is some ridiculous attempt to tell me you'd be interested in helping me out with that.”
"Of course, it's top-secret and all, but how is our patient doing?" Jimar inquires. He was the one who welcomed Harry after his last diary visit and surely still recalls Harry's wrath-distorted face. Harry does not blame him for being curious.
Draco says such things only on their evenings together. He says them when he ventures out of his shell, like a snail, and opens up to Harry a little more each time.  Whether it is through their reading or spending time together in silence.
"Would he tell me if he didn’t wish to be left alone?" Draco wanted to slap himself. The question only confirmed Weasley's unspoken suspicions, but by now it was too late anyway.
Harry pretended that Ron had insulted his honour and his best friend even laughed a little before he went back to his game. But Ron wouldn't be Ron if he couldn't multitask. "Did he hurt himself, too? Is this some kind of twisted version of a hickey for you lads?"
fall under his spell. So why did you kiss him under the spell?” Ron asked, looking as if he had just been given an incredibly complicated Arithmancy exercise.
Harry placed one hand at the back of his head and raised the other to brush a strand of hair out of Draco's face. Shit, why was he nervous anyway? "Would you even –" Harry choked on his own saliva but courageously started again. "Would you like to try it?"
"Come on, mate. Malfoy's anything but a nice bloke, but you wouldn't wish him dead anyway," Ron takes his wife's side. Another thing that intensified after the wedding. Ron only rarely takes his side now, and only in Hermione's absence.
Chases are much easier when you have your target in sight. But Draco was already over the hills and Harry could only hope that he was following the right path. It was an easy route, just a wide road leading into the forest, but soon smaller paths separated from the big road. Harry stubbornly stuck to his route, a tiny glimmer of hope within him made him believe that he knew where Draco was headed. If he was wrong, this was all for nothing.
“The way – the way that you just – that you fuck my pussy. The way that it – it fills me up. Can’t get enough.” Harry’s pretty sure that he’s incoherent, but he doesn’t really care. He’s too busy getting fucked within an inch of his life.
“What are you trying to achieve with your clothes?” Draco asks as an enchanted tape measure determines the length of Harry’s arm.
That night, with his hand shoved down inside his sweatpants, that image of Draco on his broomstick is all that Harry can think of as he strokes himself.
“I’m still working on this myself,” he says, “but you might also want to work on feeling good about having a body. Indulge in those moments when having a body feels like a good thing.”
“I get that you don’t want to draw attention to yourself,” Draco explains. “But the way you’re dressing now,” he shrugs, “that’s exactly what you’re doing.”
And, holy shit, does Harry want that too. Their cock is so hard that it’s aching, desperate to be inside Draco. They let go of Draco’s ass, start to undo their jeans, noticing the half-moon crescents they left behind as they do so.
As he hovers in the air, Draco comes to a stop beside him. Draco’s cheeks are flushed red, his hair coming loose from its braid. There is an ease to him that’s not usually present, as if he’s come undone somewhat.
Harry doesn’t have to be told twice. In next to no time, the two of them are up in the air, whooping and hollering and flying loop-de-loops. It’s exhilarating. Harry feels alive. Present.
Harry wants to ask what Draco means, but there’s a small gaggle of witches swooping in now, trapping Harry in small talk once again. By the time Harry is able to emerge, Draco is nowhere to be found.
Each time Harry thrusts into faer, Draco lets out an unbridled moan that Harry knows only happens when they hit faer prostate. Fae has completely let go, but, with faer head dropped forward, fae is missing the sight of it.
Harry studied Malfoy for a moment. Were they actually becoming friends? More to the point, did Harry want to be friends with Malfoy? ‘Yea, ok,’ Harry agreed.
And now, here he is, at this stuffy event like every other vaguely important wix in Britain. Harry doesn’t quite know what to make of it.
Harry lets go of Draco who collapses down into his chair. Harry keeps his legs spread wide, watches Draco as he admires the sight of Harry’s well-fucked, come-spattered pussy.
Harry shakes their head. “Not really. I thought I might have some trouble choosing pronouns, since there’s so many. But the others just didn’t feel like me.”
Harry is beginning to lose their pace, but, before they can begin to worry about it, Draco is tumbling over into orgasm. As fae pulses around Harry’s cock, fae pulls Harry after faer. As their hips stutter, they come inside Draco’s ass, vision filling with stars as they do so.
That’s all the encouragement that Harry needs. He slides off the arm of the chair, until he’s straddling Draco. One hand in Draco’s hair, the other pressed against his chest, Harry kisses him, plumbing the depths of Draco’s mouth. As they kiss, Draco grips Harry’s hips, hands occasionally travelling up his sides but never going beyond the bottom of his binder.
Harry places a hand over Draco’s on the table, hoping it will quiet him. It does. “Thank you,” he says.
Harry’s breathing hitches at the sensation. Each time that Draco fucks back into him, it’s slightly harder and faster. Their kissing is replaced by Draco sucking at Harry’s bottom lip as Harry can only moan breathlessly in response to Draco’s cock driving into him over and over again.
“I think I understand what you’re trying to do. But it actually requires effort. Wearing your oldest, baggiest clothing isn’t an option.”
“No, I’m going to keep it simple,” Draco assures him. “Use neutral colours. It’s just going to be higher quality and better fitting.”
He would read the rest of the magazine later; he needed to get back to work. He quickly flicked through the magazine one last time and, in doing so, a flag fell out from between the pages.
“Definitely,” Draco tells them. Fae licks at the precome before sliding faer mouth over Harry’s cock.
The two of them settle on the bed as Draco begins to paint their nails. For long moments, neither of them speaks, but Harry can see that Draco is deep in thought.
Harry only had to consider for a moment. The thing was, he really, really did want to. He nodded his agreement.
Harry lets the hand on Draco’s chest drift downward, ever so slowly, until he’s palming the bulge in Draco’s sweatpants. Somehow, the feeling of Draco’s cock hardening beneath his hand is still more of a novelty than the fact that Draco wears sweatpants.
Draco is wearing a perfectly starched white shirt, collar crisp, gold stitching on the pocket. In the place of a tie, he is once again wearing that locket. His hair is pulled back in a simple braid today.
Arriving home after a long day at the Ministry, Harry stops just long enough to shrug off his robes before making his way to Draco’s study. Draco is sitting at the large desk in the ornately furnished room, frowning at the papers in his hands. He doesn’t look up when Harry taps at the door.
Draco hums in enthusiastic agreement. After a few last punishing thrusts, Harry pulls their cock from Draco’s mouth and begins stroking it at much the same speed.
“Yea, you always talk about seeing me come apart, how into it you are.” Fae shrugs. “Sounds kinda hot.”
“It was phenomenal,” Harry tells him. As Draco stands up, Harry tucks his now spent cock back into his sweatpants.
As Draco shifts to a gentler suckling, the fingers that were holding Harry’s labia apart shift, pressing against the entrance to his pussy. It gives way slowly, and Draco begins pistoning his fingers in and out, his mouth still on Harry’s dick. A familiar sound makes Harry realise that Draco’s using his spare hand to jerk himself off.
“Quid pro quo,” Draco tells him. “What about your love life? I take it you’re not with Weasley anymore?”
It’s absolute bliss, Harry thinks, kissing Draco while he strokes both of their cocks. This is how sex should always be. It feels good, but he’s still mostly clothed and the attention isn’t entirely on him. He grips at Draco’s thighs as Draco’s strokes get faster and faster. And then, with a strangled cry, Harry is coming.
Without further thought, Harry gets up, walks around the table until he’s standing in front of Draco. “Can I?” he asks, fingers skating over the silk of the dressing gown.
“Feel so good,” Draco murmurs against his lips. He begins rocking his hips, cock pulling back imperceptibly before pushing back in.
Because it is hot, unbelievably hot, seeing Draco like this. Sated and sweaty, this is probably what he looks like after sex, Harry muses.
Luna, completely oblivious, continued talking. ‘Obviously, Ginny’s going to be interviewed, given her success at quidditch.’
Harry is relieved when Draco doesn’t invite him to join. While he waits for Draco’s return, he skim reads the paper. The only detail he’s able to take in, however, is the fact that there are, for once, no writeups about him.
That was something of an understatement, but Harry didn’t have time to tell Luna as much. He’d now made it to the front of the queue.
A few days later, Harry is making his way to a small coffeeshop. He was surprised when Draco owled him, asking to meet up, but he quickly agreed.
Harry’s hand in Draco’s hair loosened long ago, but he removes it now, lets it trail over Draco’s neck and shoulder. The expert way that Draco’s fingering him reminds Harry of his earlier goal.
In one deft movement, Draco has pulled his cock out, waistband now tucked beneath his balls. Draco scoots forward until his cock is brushing up against Harry’s, and then he’s wrapping a slick hand around them both.
When Harry entered the coffee shop, Ginny and Luna were already seated at a table near the back. When he reached them, he hugged them each in turn before they all joined the queue. As they did so, Harry wondered vaguely if it was odd to be getting coffee with his ex-girlfriend and her girlfriend.
Harry laughs. “You’re so demanding.” Nails still digging in, Harry pries Draco’s cheeks apart and bends forward until their tongue is pressing insistently against Draco’s hole.
“Was thinking about having sex in front of a mirror,” Draco says, all of faer attention on Harry’s nails. “How hot it would be to watch myself getting fucked.”
Draco releases Harry’s lip. “I love fucking your tight pussy,” he says, pressing his forehead against Harry’s.
A week later, Harry arrives on the doorstep of Malfoy Manor bright and early. He’d received an owl the previous night, telling him his clothes were ready.
With some effort, Draco stands up. Harry gets an unobstructed view of faer clothed erection before Draco is pulling them to their feet as well.
Awkward silence falls between the two of them. It had been awkward like this at the manor, too, after Draco had returned from his shower. Harry had left as soon as he’d performed a perfunctory trying-on of the clothes, unable to withstand the jagged, raw feeling between the two of them.
“You look nice,” Draco tells Harry once he’s reached the table. He’s casting a critical eye over Harry’s clothes though, so Harry doesn’t read too far into it.
‘Right,’ Luna continued. ‘Think about all the children you’d be helping. Knowing that the Chosen One is just like them.’
Draco’s response is to kiss them again. Fae quickly deepens the kiss, pushing Harry backwards until the two of them are lying on the sofa. It’s not particularly comfortable, but as Draco’s tongue begins to plumb the depths of Harry’s mouth, Harry decides that they don’t really care.
“I have threads that are imbued with magic,” Draco explains. “There’s a black one that I’ll sew into your clothes. Draws attention away from them.”
Harry doesn’t get a chance to answer him – with a hand in Harry’s hair, Draco pulls him in for a kiss. Admittedly, it’s only brief, but it leaves Harry wanting more.
And then Draco is sliding faer way down Harry’s body, until fae is kneeling in front of them. Harry unbuttons their trousers, pulling them and their pants down to mid-thigh. In their nervousness, their cock has softened slightly, so they grab hold of it, giving it a couple of strokes. Draco reaches out faer own hand, wrapping it around the head of Harry’s cock. Harry lets their hand fall to their side.
“I tried to tell myself it wasn’t any of my business, but,” he shrugs, “if I were in your position, I’d want someone to suggest it.”
Harry had asked him, once, what he did during his long hours in his study. Draco had taken on the self-important attitude of old when he insisted that Harry couldn’t possibly understand. Harry hadn’t pushed it further, knowing this false bravado covered over insecurities.
Harry wasn’t quite sure what to make of this mixture of sincerity and vague taunting. ‘Was there something you were needing?’ he asked, words coming out slightly too harsh.
Draco pulls out, leaving Harry feeling unbearably empty, and starts stroking his cock. His hand flies over the length of it, chasing his orgasm. With a low groan, come spurts out of the tip, striping Harry’s dick and vulva with its warm stickiness.
’. It was well written, which he’d always known it would be, and any lingering nerves were quickly dissipating.
From this distance, he can see the detailing on Draco’s robes, thin gold thread fanning out at his waist and hips. The robes have a high collar and, over that, Draco is wearing a gold locket on a delicate chain.
Harry gathers Draco’s come onto his fingertips before licking it off languidly. He returns his hand to his pussy to collect any remaining drops, Draco’s eyes following the movement. “We should do that more often,” he tells Draco.
Gradually, a thought occurs to Harry. “You being nonbinary, does that change anything? Do I still use the same words?”
In a matter of moments, they have their cock out, stroking it with one lubed up hand while the other runs gently over Draco’s ass.
Before Harry can reply, Draco is walking away. Harry turns in the opposite direction and heads for the library.
In the end, it hadn’t been a very hard decision. In fact, the whole process had been quite painless. He’d sat down for an interview with Luna and then he’d had his photograph taken. The worst part had been the group photographs and the author who had spent the entire time flirting with Harry. But even that had been bearable.
Draco lifts his eyes, continues to slurp on Harry’s dick for a few more moments before pulling away. “Now?” he asks.
“Right, well.” Draco leads him through large hallways. “I was just having a pot of tea. Did you want some?”
“So fucking tight,” Harry tells faer as they continue at this rapid pace. One of their hands finds its way to Draco’s hip, while the other grips faer shoulder, pulling faer back to met each of their thrusts. Harry knows that they aren’t going to last long.
Harry’s hand is still on top of Draco’s. Draco now turns his hand until its palm is facing upwards and grips hold of Harry’s. For a moment, they just sit holding hands.
Harry quickly turned to the page it had fallen from. It seemed this rainbow flag was another tradition from the Muggle world. He picked the flag up and the rainbow of colours began to glow. It was quite pretty really. Harry propped the flag up in an empty quill holder.
“It means that I’m not a man, but I’m also not a woman. I don’t fit into that either/or binary. And I thought – ” He pauses, looking deep into Harry’s eyes, as if searching for something. “Again, this probably isn’t any of my business, but it seems like you could be nonbinary too.”
Harry grips at Draco’s ass, kneading it, digging their nails in. They take a moment to appreciate the silver polish against Draco’s pale skin.
Harry doesn’t hear from Draco in a week and he’s despairing about what that means for him, for the both of them. And then, suddenly, Draco is owling him, and they’re meeting at the muggle coffeeshop again.
The hand that was in Harry’s hair now rests on his knee. “Better now that you’re here,” Draco replies.
“You have sex while you’re fully clothed?” Harry kinda can’t believe the direction this conversation is taking.
“When I was in Milan,” Draco says, “I met a lot of trans people. I discovered that I, myself, am trans. Have you ever heard the word nonbinary?”
Draco hums faer agreement, lifts faer head just enough to be able to meet faer own eyes. Harry drinks in the sight too, the familiar wanton expression, the unabashed nature of it all. Draco falls into tell-tale silence as fae reaches back and tugs at faer cock.
Harry’s eyes are drawn to the hints of gold. The locket that had been tucked inside Draco’s jumper. The gold thread sewn through it. The realisation that Draco’s come apart this much, despite the presence of the thread, hits Harry like a tonne of bricks. He wonders how much looser, how much hotter, Draco would look without the tempering effect of the thread.
“Be quick about it,” Harry tells faer. As Draco continues, Harry conjures a mirror, tries to work out where in the room to place it.
This is the only kind of sex Harry has been having recently – solo and furtive, with not even the slightest effort to unclothe himself. He prefers it this way, with no one there to strip him down or to watch him as he gets off. It’s just him and the delicious feeling of a rapidly building orgasm.
As they focus back on their drinks, Harry finds himself lost in thought. He’s suddenly desperate to get to a muggle library, desperate to use the internet to research this new part of himself.
Malfoy had spent the last ten minutes perched on the edge of Harry’s desk as the two of them discussed their latest case. Harry was having some trouble focussing on the conversation though, given the aforementioned perching.
“But I’m your sap,” Draco counters with a shocking amount of sincerity. He kisses Harry again – hint of a teasing tongue this time – as his hand travels up Harry’s thigh.
The desperation in faer voice is enough to make Harry come, striping Draco’s face with white. This, in turn, has Draco coming, silent once again and with eyes shut.
The thing is, though, that Harry does want their cock sucked. The thought of the wet heat of Draco’s mouth around them, pulling them toward orgasm, has their cock getting, somehow, even harder. And yet –
“Yea.” Harry agrees. They splay a hand over Draco’s thigh, take in the silver polish against Draco’s skin once again.
‘Oh.’ Luna seemed slightly surprised. ‘Well, every June, the Muggles celebrate their rainbow people. They have a name for them.’ She turns to Ginny. ‘Do you remember what it was?’
Draco’s back was pushed against the stable wall, Harry pressed their bodies together again and sighed comfortably, just as Draco's free hand stroked his arm down to his hand. Harry wanted to reach for Draco's fingers, but then he understood what Draco actually wanted.
The high-security sector is only a small area on the fourth floor, isolated first and foremost from the rest of the hospital, and is equipped with loads of spells to prevent an escape. Most of the time, however, it stands empty; most wizards and witches die in Azkaban before they are admitted.
"The patient's condition could be stabilised, for the time being, thus he is not in a life-threatening situation at the moment. However, neither the cause of the injuries nor the exact progress can be identified at this stage. My team and I assume that we’re dealing with a still unknown curse that may have gone wrong," Anja continues her explanation.
"Can I kiss you?" Harry whispered more than he spoke. His voice throaty, as if he hadn't spoken for hours.
Healers detect physical illnesses and can cure them. Anja has always had an extraordinary talent for this, but she has always been careful when she encounters anything more than physical wounds. It rarely happens, is no more than a night-black, abyssal stain there where most others only have colours flickering jauntily when Anja performs her magical inspections. She knows that other Healers do not detect colours or dark stains when they examine their patients. And she also knows that she cannot heal or otherwise alter the colours.
A horrified cry escaped his lips and, continuing to stare at the Muggle, he clung to the soft rubber-covered handrails of the Stairs of Darkness, squeezing his knees together to keep his balance.
A splash at the edge of the pool made Harry spin around. And there he was. Harry’s eyes widened and he had to press a hand to his mouth to not make a sound. He hadn't been dreaming. No, definitely not. You couldn't even dream about whatever was in front of him. If one only had seen Draco's bare torso, one would already have become suspicious. Harry recognized silvery-blue scales scattered on his body, which were visible from his upper body down, piled up and covering a huge fishtail. Harry needed a moment to collect himself, then he approached unnoticed. This was not the time to be horrified, he had already known what to expect.
Draco smiled again, then turned back to Neville. For a while no one said anything, Harry just watched the movement of the pale fingers feeding Neville tirelessly. The sight shouldn’t have been as heartwarming as it was.
Neville willingly let himself be supported by Harry and Draco and was led out of the dining hall into the entrance area of the guesthouse. He put up a good fight, even muttered a slurred apology, which Draco particular enjoyed. They were just passing the door to the lounge when someone called Draco's name. The blond paused abruptly, bringing Harry and Neville to a halt.
Draco’s body, which fit perfectly like a missing piece of the puzzle into his own, drove him half-mad and Harry really had to fight to slow down and not rip Draco’s clothes off immediately. For all his panic a moment ago, he was now quite gagging for more.
Yes, why were we doing that? Why had I even entered the diary after hearing the news about Malfoy's mother? It was absurd, I should have skipped that one visit and instead dealt with how I was feeling about it and to what extent it even affected me.
"Nothing," Harry began, still looking at the red smudge of paint on Draco's cheek. "You're good at this. Painting, I mean."
an expensive liquor. Draco’s lips drew upwards as he looked at the drink, but then took pity and held out his glass to Harry as he looked straight into his eyes.
Harry almost exhaled in relief. An invisible weight lifted off his chest and allowed him to breathe freely again. This wasn't about them. Draco hadn't decided against Harry. If he thought about it, it didn't make sense for Draco to back out now. No sense
“I knew it wouldn’t have any significant effect on me, besides, I was hoping to find out why you wanted to put me to sleep,” Draco replied, studying Harry’s face, his gaze stuck to Harry’s lips for a little too long. Harry ignored that, as usual.
him all that, they just enhanced it for the sheer aesthetics. And Harry was bloody grateful that Draco was willing to grant him this aesthetic enrichment.
?" Ron asked, exchanging a panicked look with Harry, who continued to look fascinated at Draco. He leaned in the doorway but kept glancing nervously down the hallway.
throw up in Potter’s direction." As he spoke, Draco got up and helped Neville to his feet at the same time. Harry rushed to his aid at once.
"Draco," Mr Malfoy greeted his son composed and stopped at the head of the table between Ron and Harry. His attention, however, was entirely focused on Draco.
Doubts are the death of every glimmer of hope. They sneak up on you and when their trap closes, they devour you skin and hair. It's like a chain reaction. One doubt is followed by the next, and at some point, each part of the scaffold of hope seems faulty and unstable.
“Flirtations? I don’t quite follow,” Draco replied. Merlin, how could a voice be so beautifully soft and speak such frustrating words?
Draco, who continued to stroke Harry’s cheek, smiled slightly. “You’ll get over me, Harry. It will torture you and the pain will pass only slowly, but you will succeed.” If Harry hadn’t recognised the hurt undertone in Draco’s voice, he would’ve assumed Draco was joking. “And if your longing devours you, you can pay me a visit and let yourself be beaten in a swimming race.”
“Since when does the saviour of the wizarding world care about following rules?” Draco muttered, making it sound more suggestive than it should have been.
Filly stands opposite the table, slides the open book almost reverently towards Harry and looks at him with bright eyes. A mystery is about to be solved for him here; Harry wishes to be cooking in his small flat right now, listening to the sounds of Dvořák. He pulls himself together – he knows that everyone present is counting on him.
But when reality hit Harry like cold water, he didn't need any prompting for what followed. Still a little weak but decisive, he grabbed Draco by the hips, turned him onto his back and in the same movement bent over the blond, who only gasped in shock but then bit his lip. The lip where traces of Harry's orgasm were still visible. Harry suppressed a moan at the sight, wiped Draco clean with his thumb and then kissed him with all the passion he could muster.
Harry put his phone and his hands in his pocket. "I have no intention of changing teammates. Is that enough?" He probably sounded sulkier than intended.
Harry rubbed his temples; Draco's memories flew past him faster and faster in front of his inner eye. Everything in him was reluctant to give Draco the memory he asked of him. He knew that Draco thought Harry was so coy because the memory hurt him and although that certainly added to his discomfort, it wasn't the whole truth. With the pictures would come the emotions and he didn't want Draco to see the full extent.
"Absolutely not. Not until we all calm down!" Theo crossed his arms and looked as if he would throw himself at Harry if necessary if he tried to get past him.
"Hermione." Harry leans forward in his chair and looks urgently at his best friend. "You know I'm not actually going to die. At least not if you help me."
Malfoy cast me a sceptical look. "Is that what you would like me to wonder so you can tell me the answer?" I rolled my eyes and Malfoy fought a smug grin off his lips. "Perhaps, Potter. Perhaps I do wonder."
In summary, Draco was capable of turning everyone around him into mindless zombies who were pining for him, but his powers faded with… his saviour? This had to be the one to whom he had to lose his virginity to in order to break the curse. Yes, that had to be it.
Potter was silent, understandably so, for quite some time. Draco wasn't sure if digging his own grave would be too dramatic, but the need to do just that was very much in his mind.
On Friday evening, the night before New Year's Eve, Harry has reached a point where he is toying with the idea of simply marching into St Mungo's Hospital and demanding a diary visit. The only thing stopping him is the planned dinner with his best friends, which Ron has spontaneously planned and allowed no protest from Harry.
Draco raised his eyebrow, then grabbed one of Harry's hands and looked at it for a moment with furrowed brows before looking up again. "They're not very long."
“Nott may be more sociable, but he's not half as handsome as Zabini is. He behaves a bit odd at times, might remind one of Luna if his father wasn't one of Voldemort's most loyal Death Eaters. I doubt that Draco should be going back into the company of people with these ideals right now,” Harry continued. Nott wasn’t his father, but the possibility that he had similar ideals was not so far-fetched. Moreover, Harry knew nothing about Nott's sexuality, he had neither a boyfriend nor a girlfriend, to Harry's knowledge.
He thought of how Draco awakened this adrenaline in him. And so much more. He raised this optimistic hope for a future. He made him feel certain that there was a chance for a happy ending. He made Harry feel the need to open up. And that was new. Completely new. But exciting and good.
, Harry wants to say, but he bites his tongue. His main problem is that he cannot rank his priorities rationally, and every possible decision feels like the wrong one, or at least one in which he must expect loss.
Harry feels pain fading, open wounds whose bleeding has stopped, loneliness vanishing, magic gasping for breath as if it were being subjected to constant drowning, and a heartbeat that is steadily growing stronger and steadier.
"Can I –" Harry breaks off. There is too high a probability that Draco will send him away if he asks to stay. And right now, at this very moment, Harry cannot leave the room, lie down in his bed and pretend he is not needed.
Harry fights the urge to get up, hold him in his arms and reassure him that everything will be all right, and instead returns the gaze steadfastly. "I'm not going to die, nor are you going to be the one to make my brain think I am. All you have to do is be there with me."
Hermione and Harry set out late in the afternoon to search the entire library for books on curse-breaking spells and potions. It was quite a bit of work to pick out all the books on the subject, but at the end of the day, the two of them sat on the floor of the library surrounded by a good two dozen books and went through them at high speed, only to forcefully close the book and put it on the “useless” stack if they were unsuccessful.
Harry refrained from mentioning that it was not him who was acting like a spoiled prince who had only recently lost the right to his throne. Granting Draco sovereign power was the last thing Harry intended to do now.
"Of course, he does. But you can't protect him from everything. We and he are already doing all we can to make sure he's okay. He knows that."
Harry feels the mixture of disappointment and anger flare up inside him, so he concentrates on stepping into the footsteps that already exist on the path. It helps a little. The impulsive anger subsides and he dares a glance in Ron's direction, who is eyeing him with a thoughtful expression. Caught, Harry lowers his gaze again. He is like an open book to Ron, he realises.
"I'm afraid I am serious," Hermione counters, her gaze unyielding, but Harry can see concern in it. "Harry, it can't be healthy to develop such an attachment to a magical object. I remember all too well you sitting here across from us talking about how reluctant you were to participate in this project. Don't get me wrong, it's important and great that your opinion has evolved and changed, but even you must realise that any further step would be too far."
Potter was silent again, and slowly, it was driving Draco mad. He didn't really want to think or speak of his father, this had been a dreadful idea. Still, Potter's silence felt thoughtful, not pejorative, and that made Draco feel halfway better.
Healer Isaksen would certainly have laughed at this point, at least Harry believes so. However, he does not laugh and meets Filly's gaze unflinchingly. The only aspect of the answer which surprises him is that he got it. "Then why bother? He's not only a Death Eater, but he's also a convicted prisoner."
Gingerly, Harry guides their interlaced fingers to Draco's heart and carefully traces one of the lines with a fingertip. He feels his magic entwining with Draco's, yet to be sealed. Harry holds off on that today. For now, he surrenders to the sensation of Draco's touch and gaze on his skin and only later devotes his attention to his actual task. With a smile on his lips, Harry closes his eyes.
! Coupled with the feeling, Harry just named. Curiosity. Curiosity stronger than the warnings the universe supposedly tried to give him. They're not warnings, they're
"Okay," Harry said with little eloquence. And when Draco looked at him again, almost hopeful, Harry smiled softly. "I mean... I know what that is."
Ron looked as if he had a Veela-Hermione in front of him as he continued to walk towards Draco with reddened cheeks and widened eyes. Hermione, who had the exact same expression next to him, did the same. Neither of them paid any attention to Harry, but Draco noticed with a quick glance that Harry was awake and well. With a single movement, he rolled Harry’s wand, which was closer to him than to Harry himself, towards him, but continued to look at the two Gryffindors, who obviously had no intention of stopping.
Harry pushed his hips towards Draco's hand and his legs twitched. It was better than good. It was better than groundbreaking. It was just indescribable. Draco's lips found Harry's, the man moaned and whimpered into the kiss. His erection ached from restraint, Harry grabbed Draco's waist firmly and pulled him closer.
"You're talking about my future self, aren't you?" Draco deduced, as I only stared at the ceiling and remained silent. "You’re certainly a great wizard, Potter, but I dare to doubt that you play such a drastic role in my future life that I could hate you."
Harry wanted to know from Isaksen what would happen if Malfoy lost his last bit of magic. In the worst case, he would only be non-magical, which is not ideal, but at least he would be healthy, right? Isaksen explained to him, however, that Malfoy's physical condition has reached such a miserable state that he would die of the consequences.
Harry frowns and promptly sits up a little. Narcissa Malfoy's whereabouts have been a mystery to the Aurors for many years, but Harry is not involved enough to know if she was fleeing a prison sentence back then. "Does that mean she'll be locked up now?"
Malfoy had not asked another time why he had been convicted, he had just accepted it after my vague confirmations of his theory. We did not talk often about the five years that had passed. Instead, I tried to make up for the two years before when I had lost track of Malfoy. That took up more than enough time.
! I want to see great teamwork, a fair competition and many successes on your four-legged friends! So make an effort and have
Draco, the breathtakingly beautiful bastard, sat leaning against the bedpost next to Harry's feet, held his sketchbook in his hands and also a pencil. His hair was a little tousled but loose, his teeth were buried in his lower lip and his eyes flitted back from Harry to the paper in front of him. The blanket covered his centre, his chest and legs were still completely exposed. As exposed as Harry felt and apparently was. A look down confirmed his feeling. He lay completely naked in Draco's bed and was entirely at his mercy.
“And Malfoy didn’t like it? That’s why he’s spreading the word now?” Hermione asked, with a highly critical expression on her face. Jesus, wasn’t she even
"Uh, no." Admittedly he hadn't considered this yet, but when he thought about his fantasies and dreams, he had never felt the need for control. "No, it's not about control," he said with more emphasis. "I guess, essentially, I just think your feminine side is hot and I'd like to see more of it."
"You have to want it in order for it to work." Draco's voice sounded shaky, but it never failed. "Three times my aunt made me experience the consequences of the curse before I gave in."
Harry almost laughed bitterly. Why was Draco still interested in their classes? In a few days, it was all over anyway. “Ron is currently occupying my dormitory,” he admitted and blamed his directness on the alcohol, the effects of which had long faded away.
From another picture frame, no memory waved cheerfully at me, only Moaning Myrtle. She sat amidst hundreds of colourful flowers, tossing her hair as if being prompted to pose for a portrait, and flashed me her most charming smile. There was no date on the picture frame, just "Myrtle Elizabeth Warren" written in squiggly letters.
"Draco," Harry murmured, interrupted the kiss and cast a glance over him. Framed by silky, blond hair, his features looked almost too sharp in the sparse light behind closed curtains. Although that was deceiving. Since their return to Hogwarts, Draco's features had become softer, the high cheekbones appeared more delicate than unhealthy, the dark shadows under his eyes had almost completely faded and a spark lit up the grey of his eyes. "Have I already told you today that you’re bloody beautiful?"
Harry stopped at the now familiar spot on the lakeshore, revealing himself by taking off his cloak and already wondering how best to call for a waterspirit. The night was cooler than usual, clouds were hanging in the sky and obscured the moon to such an extent that the darkness seemed even more ghostly. Top conditions
Draco chuckled amusedly, then he wrapped both hands around Harry's hand, leaned over to his ear and gave him a little kiss on the cheek. "Your jealousy is blinding you, Potter. You’re focusing on the wrong thing." He stopped and pointed his pocket lamp into the thicket. Something white and square was attached to a tree there. Draco grinned smugly at Harry, but when he noticed Harry's furrowed brow, he sighed. "I told you that Krum is merely the past. That doesn't mean that everything that mattered in his time also lies in the past."
"I've had as many as three reporters ask me about my hair care routine and as many as five – let me repeat that explicitly:
didn't care about superficiality shouldn't do that. But what was Harry supposed to do? Just lie to himself and claim that he didn't spend too much time looking at Draco's tight jodhpurs that were filled out in exactly the right places? No, that was bullshit. Maybe he just had to come to terms with the fact that his body didn't care quite as much about personality than his heart.
Knotts does not say a word throughout the entire walk; he did much the same at their last meeting last Sunday. From the reception desk, where again the young, blond woman is sitting, Harry continues alone and determinedly makes his way along the corridors of the high-security sector until he reaches Mr Waters' office. The door is open, Auror Loy Filly is standing in front of it and welcomes him with a few words of greeting.
The feeling made Harry pant. It was strange, not bad, but also not as groundbreaking as he had expected. It was a little bit uncomfortable, but he quickly got used to it. Draco left his hand unmoved, Harry didn't have to open his eyes to know that Draco was studying every reaction on his face. He frowned and opened his eyes, as expected, he was met by grey eyes.
Harry's heart was beating faster, he sensed that the story didn't have a happy ending and was tempted to interrupt Draco. The blond spoke as if he was being chased, as if he had no choice but to tell the story. He was suffering the pain of memory.
Harry cleared his throat to draw attention to himself and Ron. Draco hardly looked up from his breakfast, but, like Blaise, moved aside a little to make room for the two of them at their table. Harry sat down next to Draco, gave Blaise a questioning look, but he only waved it off discreetly. Draco noticed the gesture anyway and threw a reproachful glance at his best friend.
perhaps? Whatever it was, it cooled Harry's nerves efficiently. Still, not completely, it would have been impossible. After all, Draco was sitting so close to him that their knees touched and he could
to label people 'worthless' or 'slut'. You can't expect me to cut capers when he treats Hermione like that!"
And with that, Draco made an inviting gesture towards Katla and, when Harry didn't move on his own, grabbed his upper arm boldly and pushed him towards the mare. Katla didn’t exactly belong to the small type of pony and of course, didn’t wear a saddle. A little over-challenged Harry threw a look at Draco.
Not a second too soon, Harry crossed the threshold of the barn door, a roll of thunder echoed and the clouds opened their floodgates. The rain poured down loud and mercilessly, another thunder rumbled. Draco didn't wait for Harry, walked past the machines parked here and climbed up a rotten ladder at the edge of the barn. Harry followed Draco, at the top he looked around in surprise. A hayloft.
Draco groaned surrenderingly, straightened up, returned Harry's gaze with grey eyes burning with longing and fear. "I like you, Harry," he began, his hand massaging dark hair at the back of his neck. "So much, I think – No, I know I'm falling in love with you too."
Harry deliberately keeps his voice sounding as reassuring as possible, how well he manages it he cannot tell.
"Do you see that? The exercise makes no sense at all! Feykir only gets nervous and then his rhythm gets unclear," Hermione complained and joined the conversation.
Harry nodded and stirred around his tea with a spoon. “I told you there was something fishy going on.”
Sirius. Draco felt as though he should know who this person was. If he was honest with himself, he knew
“A tragic case indeed, sir. Hypothermia from last night might be the reason. With respect, I’d better take Mr Potter to the hospital wing so Madam Pomfrey can give him a prophylactic potion.” Draco, that sneaky… genius! After Harry looked particularly suffering again, Flitwick gave in and sent the two of them to the hospital wing.
. Slughorn was truly merciless when it came to exposing Harry, but the Gryffindor was not to be put off and continued his observations unperturbed.
"The teams of two have already been divided, should there be any complaints, my office door is always open to you. Your team will collect points over the next two weeks, we call them horseshoes, which will be credited to you for additional activities on the farm, success in riding lessons or winning equestrian games. The team that has achieved the most points at the end of the week wins. We have put together a variation of prizes: A few vouchers for equestrian shops, free lessons on our farm, as always a lot of sweets and of course the trophy you get to keep!
Without interrupting the kiss, his hand crept between their bodies, climbed under the shirt that had slipped out of Draco's trousers at some point and ran his fingers over the heated skin. Draco's breaths became more uneven, Harry grinned contentedly into the kiss, which Draco only commented by lifting his hips slightly, pushing them against Harry's.
"No offence, but what has that got to do with me?" Mr Potter asks, having looked attentively back and forth between Anja and Auror Filly.
A rustle beside him indicated that Draco leaned a little closer to Harry. The warm breath Harry felt on the side of his neck only confirmed that. “So you didn't notice it, did you? Have you ever thought that it's because I’m trying hard to restrain myself?”
Weasley intercepted Potter and Draco in the dining hall entrance and had a look on his face as he'd just seen a ghost. Draco frowned, Potter, however, stopped dead in his tracks.
"Yes, probably," Potter replied to Weasley. "Hey, can you... I don't know... let somebody know? I've lost my appetite. I'm just going to –" Potter broke off and pointed behind him as if it would explain what he was
The bathroom next to the office should be free," Harry said, glancing at the crowded bathroom adjacent to the dining hall.
Keeping his eyes on our hands, Draco took a deep breath and then began to tell me. Of dark times that had required even darker deeds. Of his mad aunt who had tried to convince him of cruelty and of his mother who had just stood idly by while his father had been conspicuous by his absence.
please!" Mrs Longbottom admonished, but Draco had already disappeared and closed the door behind him. So she smiled kindly at the three of them. "I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun here. Go and unpack your things, and I'll meet you all in the dining hall in two hours."
Malfoy glared at me, he was so close I could see specks of lemon yellow in the grey of his eyes, but he did not move an inch. "Get your filthy fingers off me. I'm not going to answer your ridiculous questions, Potter."
And with that, he grabbed Draco by the wrist and dragged him determined out of the dining hall. Hermione gazed after them for a moment, then jumped up too and disappeared, still trembling with rage, towards the bathroom. Some of the other participants looked curiously in their direction, the argument had been anything but quiet.
Harry nods slightly and has to fight the urge to lower his head. He is all too aware of the risk this plan entails.
Harry came to a halt in front of where Draco was seated and continued to struggle not to blush. In the Great Hall, one could probably have heard a pin drop by now, it had become so quiet. Even the teachers at the teacher’s table looked interestedly in Harry’s direction, perhaps they were worried that there would be injuries.
Harry didn’t feel like the emotional support he was supposed to be in this situation. Not surprisingly, he more than nervously pushed open the door to the platform of the Astronomy Tower and looked around worried. Everything was dark, only the moon and a few stars provided the necessary light. Perfect conditions for their project.
“Yea?” Harry says. They’re not really able to say much more, overwhelmed, as usual, by the thought of having sex with Draco.
’ stretched above the photograph. He flicked through the magazine until he found his interview, under the heading ‘
Harry gives the cock a light squeeze, once again marvelling at its thickness. He breaks their kiss. “Want you inside me,” he says.
“Nonbinary, yes.” His research had made that abundantly clear. “And I’m going to use they/them pronouns.”
Harry steps aside to let Draco in while he takes in the story on the front page. The headline reads ‘Potter: New Clothes and a New Beau?’ Beneath it is a photo of Harry and Draco kissing outside the coffeeshop yesterday.
Harry spreads his legs wider, urging Draco in deeper. They kiss as Draco pushes further and further in, until Harry can feel Draco’s balls brushing his skin. Draco doesn’t move and Harry relishes the feeling of fullness, of being stretched wide by Draco’s thick cock. He tries to spread his legs even wider, uses his arms around Draco’s shoulders to pull himself closer, wanting Draco as deep as he can possibly go.
“You’re not going to make me dress like that, are you?” Harry asks. It’s not that he doesn’t like the way Draco dresses. He definitely does. It just doesn’t really feel like Harry.
That sentiment can only last for so long though. Eventually, Harry breaks the kiss. “Need to move,” they tell Draco.
Harry laughs, leaning down to press a kiss to Draco’s lips. “Anyone ever told you that you’re a sap?”
When Draco answers the door, he’s wearing a silk floral dressing gown. The sight of him is almost enough to make Harry’s brain implode. Especially given his recent recurring fantasies.
They’ve just come to the conclusion that they’ll fuck Draco on the floor near the door when Draco finally finishes, capping the polish and then casting a charm over Harry’s nails.
“Merlin, Draco,” Harry tells him, burying his fingers in the hair at the back of Draco’s head. He holds Draco’s head there, relishing the way that Draco licks and slurps and sucks at his dick.
Pushing the labia aside, Draco sucks Harry’s dick into his mouth, tongue lathing over the tip of it. Over and over, Draco licks it, maintaining suction as he does so. He releases it, licks a broad stripe over it, then dives in for more.
“Not fully, no. But I wouldn’t, for example, take this off.” He plucks at the collar of his dressing gown.
Draco kisses him now, open-mouthed and sloppy. His thrusts are becoming erratic, but the pressure of his thumb on Harry’s dick remains.
Draco is onto Harry’s second hand now. There are still four nails to be painted. It’s clear that fae is struggling to concentrate.
In the days that followed, as mail was delivered around the office, there was always a sizeable pile for Harry. Mostly, they were thank you notes and strangers coming out to Harry in return. But there was the occasional rude letter as well.
Malfoy shook his head. ‘Just came to say well done.’ His tone was still mostly light, but the moment he finished speaking, he turned on his heel and left.
Mostly though, he’s overwhelmed by the idea of Draco’s cock in his mouth. In his eagerness, he places open-mouthed kisses on it, through the underwear.
“Of course I do. There’s a reason I dress like this.” He gestures at the clothes he’s wearing – a long, fitted jumper with gold woven through, and tight black pants. “I use clothing as armour, as a way to create an illusion.”
“Oh?” Harry says, hoping his voice doesn’t betray the definite interest his cock is taking in that idea.
The next morning, Harry has only been dressed for about ten minutes when there’s a knock at the door. He finds Draco standing on the other side, wearing a patterned jumper and grey pants while holding a newspaper.
“Sorry,” Harry says as he steps inside, “I got a bit too excited. About the clothes,” he adds hurriedly.
‘That would make sense,’ Malfoy agreed and Harry was about to get offended on Luna’s behalf. ‘They are quite striking.’
“Can you get your cock in me already?” Draco responds. The word comes out of faer easily now, but there was a brief period where fae wondered if the two of them should change the words they used for their bodies.
Across the room, Harry spots Draco Malfoy. He hasn’t seen Draco in nearly three years. Not since he left the wizarding world to live in Milan or Paris or somewhere equally posh. They’d been on relatively good terms when he left too, and he hadn’t even bothered to say goodbye.
“The opposite, actually.” The hand at Harry’s knee is drawing circles now. “There’s one set I really like.”
Harry doesn’t miss the pronoun use. Sure, he’d had suspicions, but it’s nice to have confirmation that Draco’s into guys. Makes him feel less guilty about lusting after him.
As Harry quickly works their way inside, they look up, into the mirror. Draco is already glassy-eyed and slack-jawed, faer initial swearing replaced with unintelligible moans. Harry eases up, soothes their tongue over Draco’s pucker before darting it back in. Soon, Draco is practically squirming from the insistent pressure. Harry pulls back, resorts to licking broad stripes over faer hole.
An amused smile played at the corner of Malfoy’s lips. ‘Would you like me to spell that out for you too?’
At the end of May, Harry received a package at his desk. He knew straight away that it was the new edition of the Quibbler.
They arrive in a brightly lit sunroom where a teapot and mug are sitting on a table, alongside the newspaper. Draco waves his wand and another mug flies into the room.
Late one afternoon, Malfoy was back at Harry’s desk. Harry was starting to feel like he’d seen more of Malfoy in the last two weeks than he had in the previous year.
Now, as Draco makes a note on a page, Harry crosses the room, around the desk, and perches on the arm of Draco’s antique chair. This makes Draco look up, his frown instantly replaced with a warm smile. He doesn’t even scold Harry for disrespecting such an auspicious piece of furniture.
Draco clears his throat and Harry lifts his eyes to meet Draco’s. He’s been caught staring, he’s definitely been caught staring, and now he’s lost for words, unable to come up with a good excuse.
Draco stands up, and now they’re eye to eye. “Please,” he says, and Harry can hear how much he wants this too.
‘Yea,’ Harry agreed, as he considered the likelihood that the flag was broken. Surely it shouldn’t be glowing for Malfoy?
He looks up at Draco as he blows him. He takes in the way the dressing gown frames his body, the wild look in his eyes, the incoherent muttering. He’s an absolute mess, but Harry is pretty sure that Draco’s never looked better.
Draco is already inside, sitting at a table, waiting for him. Once Harry’s ordered, he makes his way over to join him.
Harry continues to gently stroke their spent cock, taking in the sight of Draco on faer knees. Harry isn’t sure that they’ve ever seen anyone looking so debauched. Especially not while fully clothed. Come is dripping off faer face. Meanwhile, a large damp spot on faer trousers betrays faer own orgasm. The messy sight is almost enough to have Harry ready for round two.
He doesn’t have to wait long. Soon, they’re hovering outside the coffeeshop, about to part ways. Harry is still none the wiser as to whether this was a date. He’s just about to turn and leave when, suddenly, Draco is leaning in and kissing him. Harry’s caught by surprise and the kiss is brief enough that he doesn’t have a chance to return it.
“Suggest what?” Harry asks, absolutely clueless as to where this conversation could be going. The only thing he can be sure of is that it isn’t romantic.
“Thank fuck.” They surge forward to kiss Draco, hand instantly finding its way to faer cock. They palm faer through faer trousers.
It was several days before the rest of the wizarding world received their copies of the Quibbler. Harry quickly realised the day had come when it took him an extra ten minutes to get to his desk in the morning. Five different people had stopped him along the way to congratulate him or ask him advice.
With a final lick of his fingers, Harry stands up from the desk now, legs shaky, and leans forward to kiss Draco. “Guess it paid off,” he says.
“It’ll be good for my business,” Draco explains with a shrug. “I probably also owe you a few favours.”
Luna smiled in sad resignation before perking up slightly. ‘Well, what about you, Harry? Have you considered coming out publicly?’
Draco’s hands are at the waistband of Harry’s sweatpants and he breaks the kiss. “Can I?” he asks Harry.
‘I don’t know I’d have been able to do the same, if I were in your position,’ Malfoy continued. ‘Y’know, if I were some big celebrity like you.’
‘Anyway,’ Malfoy said, ‘I ended up reading it cover to cover.’ He gave the flag one final twirl before stepping away from the desk. ‘I’ll see you in half an hour, ok?’
Harry had reread the page in the Quibbler about the pride flag after Malfoy’s previous interactions with it. ‘
Harry picks the paper up. It’s turned to the section for best- and worst-dressed. And there’s Harry’s own face, staring up at him, looking lost and uncertain. The caption below reads, ‘The Slob Who Lived?’.
“Well, you said it’s about blending in.” It’s measuring the breadth of Harry’s shoulders now. “But what do you mean by that?”
Malfoy, apparently taking this as an invitation, snatched the letter out of Harry’s hand. As he read, a scowl began to form, gradually getting deeper and deeper. Suddenly, he screwed the letter into a ball. ‘Fool needs to go back to the dark ages where he belongs.’
Draco leans forward, places a soft kiss to the tip of Harry’s cock. Then, fae looks up at Harry. “You should fuck my mouth,” fae tells them.
Draco is watching him with a raised eyebrow now, a slight hint of self-consciousness about him. Harry takes off again, flies another loop-de-loop in an attempt to distract himself.
With the last dribble of come wrung out of them, Harry pulls their cock out of Draco’s ass and sits back. Draco, meanwhile, collapses to the ground and rolls onto faer side.
In fact, the sight of Draco coming undone at his ministrations is enough to have Harry shoving his free hand inside his sweatpants. He works his own cock with his hand while he continues to work Draco’s cock with his mouth. It’s all so much, and Harry’s getting close. It seems like Draco is too. Harry’s unsure which of them is going to come first.
’ the magazine had said. Harry had ignored the dubiousness of that as a concept to instead focus on the more relevant issue. The flag was trying to say that Malfoy wasn’t straight.
“Thank you.” Draco smiles, demure, before arching that eyebrow again. “Unfortunately I can’t say the same for your clothing choices.”
“Do you want to be?” Harry counters. He’s genuinely unsure how Draco will answer. While it’s clear that Draco is nervous, Harry doesn’t know why.
As they talked, Malfoy was pawing his way through the items on Harry’s desk, picking up each one in turn.
Unbidden, the image Draco is describing comes to the forefront of Harry’s mind. “Fuck,” he whispers.
Harry was suspicious. That sounded remarkably like a genuine compliment. ‘Thanks?’ he said with a hint of a question.
‘Most of them are worth it.’ Harry dug around in his pile of mail. ‘Read this one,’ he said, holding out a letter from a thirteen year old boy.
Harry pushes the rest of the way inside in one fell swoop, eliciting a deep guttural moan from Draco. They pull out and push back in at much the same speed and Draco moans again and drops faer head forward.
Harry withdraws their hand from faer balls, instead using it to spread faer ass cheeks apart. After one final stroke, they press the blunt head of their cock against Draco’s hole. Slowly, slowly, fae gives way beneath them, and they edge their way inside.
