tutor-“
“Please don’t make me go, mother.”
“What did I say about using wandless magic?”
She breathed with a soft smile, her hand absently reaching out to touch his shoulder, only to hastily pull it back again, heeding Draco’s weary gaze.
“You’re scared.”
“Can you make him a potion? It would kill him to miss dinner tonight, we were going to try a new recipe for dessert.”
“Harry’s in town, do you remember him?”
Hermione called.
Draco chuckled, the sound so foreign in his throat. He sighed as he wiped his face with the back of his arm.
Draco let himself get lost in the moment, just a rare second that he didn’t have to reside inside his own mind... before he had to go, leaving her with a parting stroke as he slowly strode over to the feed shed.
As much as this had seemed like a good plan at the time… the idea of having a royally pissed of alpha after him wasn’t so appealing right about now.
Hermione just chuckled, too used to his games, one hand coming to rest under her chin as the other reached out and tapped him on the nose teasingly.
His hands were already all over the boy, one on his neck, pressing him down to the floor so that his ass was raised high, presenting him for his Alpha, the other hand making work of his pants and tearing at the material as he ripped them down the boy’s legs.
It was hard not to let his mind wander back to his school days, back to the halls of Hogwarts where he had had to pass that man every day.
He started again, eyes wary as he watched Draco’s head sink a little more.
He was...
She sighed wearily, her eyes crinkling in a soft smile. Draco’s gut twisted at that, wincing from the heavy helping of guilt that rushed through his mind. He had worried her, both of them… that was something that he wasn't used to— having someone worrying about him. After all they had done, it was bittersweet knowing he had put them through so much. Knowing that they cared enough to feel that way in the first place.
“Better.”
Love you ♥️
”There’s only one reason why those two ingredients would be used together, Draco, and I just don’t understand why? Why would you do it? Why make yourself sick like that? How long has this been going on, since the start? Have you hated being here that much— that you would actually—“
The Beta had attempted to pull him into conversation a few times but when Draco didn’t mutter more than a few words he seemed to back off, Hermione following suit, the witch only drifting a hand under the table to brush softly against his bicep in a comforting gesture.
The alpha leant down over him again, sniffing the expanse of his skin before he finally pulled away with a satisfied growl.
He said, bringing his glass to his lips and taking a large gulp, letting the liquid sit in his throat for a moment before he swallowed. He flicked a glance to Draco before his eyes met Hermione’s again, pulling on another warm smile.
excuses. Understood?”
Hermione scoffed, and Draco was too preoccupied with his food to bother asking what a microwave even was.
Harry just smiled, his eyes drifting over the panting Omega, his gaze dropping to the boy’s plump pink lips, catching the way they parted ever so slightly with each laboured breath.
Ron said slowly, his fingers drumming against his glass. Draco looked down at the table, biting his lip as his mind reeled on what to say.
“People talk, it’s what they do.”
It had been a month since Draco had crawled out of the fireplace, a whole month… and yet strangely, it felt like no time had passed at all.
… I don’t even know how to tell him without bawling my eyes out. That’s not how I want him to find out.”
Draco nodded.
Hermione cocked her head to the side for a beat, her face taking on an almost sad quality.
“Draco–“
”He can be such an idiot sometimes.”
“Really? There’s not that bitter aftertaste?”
Draco gave him a once over, eyes scanning unabashed down Harry’s form before he finally met his gaze again.
She whispered, squeezing her eyes shut as she held him tighter. He didn’t try to pull away.
“Harry meant your father. I guess he saw your hair and kind of freaked out. I can’t entirely blame him for that, if Lucius was in our house then I wouldn’t exactly call him a welcome guest. Harry is very protective.”
“That was a close one, ay, boy?”
Draco’s asked, his voice wobbly as he pulled away from her.
Ron asked with a scowl, earning another tinkling laugh from the witch. Draco watched the two with hidden fascination, a smile inching on his lips that he hadn’t yet realised was there.
Draco sneered, grabbing at the suitcase that was currently being hauled away by a skittish house-elf, only to hurl the bag right into his bedroom wall. The case crashed with a deafening sound, flinging open with a crack and spilling the contents across the plush carpet.
seemed that he had actually slept for longer than just a few hours...
She smirked, patting him on the shoulder gently when he continued to avoid her eyes.
Harry breathed, letting the unspoken threat drift into his words.
hands.”
cold by then.”
Draco said, shaking his head as he bent down, the loose-knit sweater sliding down the line of his back as he did, unveiling a strip of soft pale flesh to Harry’s searching eyes.
Neither the witch nor the wizard seemed to practice this custom though… their scents freely permeating the room in a sickly swirl. Draco wasn’t used to it, the reek of it overpowering his delicate senses. It made his knees weak.
… with
Of course, Harry hadn’t known at the time that Lucius had targeted him because of his ties with Voldemort, that information had only become apparent many years later. Not that it really mattered, the
“Harry!”
“Of course, Draco, you don’t have to see him again.”
He had to stop twice on his way, sucking in deep lungsful of air as the cramping in his stomach slowly abated, before another burst sent him to his knees.
Hermione smiled, moving to the side so that he could escape to his room.
His own groan drowned out Draco’s high pitched keen before he thrust forward again, one arm wrapping possessively around the boy’s middle as the other wrapped around his chest, using his new hold to pound into the moaning Omega.
Harry was dressed within a matter of minutes before he hastily transported himself to Hermione and Ron’s place, his breath coming fast and heavy as he called out to the witch.
Draco snarled in response, baring his teeth at Harry when the Alpha let out a surprised chuckle.
“Thanks.”
Draco jolted at the touch, his mouth dropping wide in a soundless gasp when Harry stroked him roughly, once, twice, then two more times— and he was already coming, his body seizing as he let out a muffled cry, his hips jutting up as pleasure rolled over him again and again.
him with them,
He stiffened when he felt Hermione’s hands rest on his shoulders, her eyes imploring him to look at her.
”Fuck.”
“Oh, that’s easy! I just add a smidge of wander-weed to my potions and it clears that right up.”
Blaise sighed, one last look to the retreating omega before he turned on his heel and left.
Harry sagged against him as he caught his breath, before he finally pulled them both to the ground, the Omega whimpering when Harry’s knot tugged at his swollen opening.
“Shit, kid, I never meant to—“
Harry groaned, his hot breath tickling the back of Draco’s neck as he nuzzled into him.
Draco muttered, his lips twisting a little when he more felt than heard the relieved breath Hermione let out.
“You’re young, Draco, you didn’t see the war, you didn’t see the way the wizarding world turned on us. We barely made it through. We sheltered you from it, we kept you ignorant, kept you here and away from prying eyes and I apologise for that, but it’s time to grow up.”
, but he wished he
Harry murmured, glancing at the boy as he took another swig of his drink before putting the glass down and continuing with a sigh.
“Goodnight, Draco!”
“I’ll tell him, dear.”
Harry stilled, his arm tightening a little around Draco’s middle as if expecting him to run.
Draco sighed, his body finally sagging listlessly against his new bedroom wall.
No, what was worse was then all of
“Silly thing.”
His own pants were gone next.
, let me—“
“Fuck…”
She held him for a long while after that, her concern raising a little more with every passing minute.
She smiled, one hand drifting up to tuck a stray strand behind his ear, smiling when he didn’t try to stop her.
“I wasn’t trying to force you, I just thought we were both… sorry.”
“I was just surprised, that’s all, and his scent is… it’s just so, it’s disgusting, so, you know I’m sensitive to that…”
him, he had—
Hermione chirped happily, glancing at Ron who was still watching him in barely hidden shock. The Beta stood up quickly, his chair scraping across the floor.
“Draco! Come in, come in, this is my mate, Ron, and this is-“
“Thanks, Rubeus.”
Any guesses on what’s going to happen next?
“Payback’s a
Draco insisted, beaming when Ron’s eyes widened at that, his hand slapping the table in gusto.
He’d never be able to mate with another either, but he hadn’t really wanted that
did that make something inside of his gut tighten?
He didn’t deserve this... didn’t deserve
“I’m sorry Draco, that should have
“Mated or not,”
Narcissa insisted, grimacing at the stench of betrayal rolling off her son. He had such a pretty scent, it was a waste to sully it with something so trivial.
— what the fuck was Draco supposed to take from that?
“Alright, give me the room.”
His mother used to touch him, but not often. His father, of course, would never, especially after Draco had presented… like he would catch some kind of disease from his Omega son.
“Always.”
Harry asked, the corner of his mouth twitching up when Draco’s own eyes faltered, not liking the way the Alpha was looking at him, not liking the way his stomach fluttered at the sudden memory of this man’s hands in his hair…
Harry was his
Especially in front of
“Everything’s fine, hon, I guess I just haven't kept up with my stock. I’ll pick up a few things after work. Do you need anything?”
“You’re a slut for this, aren’t you?”
“You know, you didn’t even apologise last night?
He felt hot, his breath coming out in short gasps as his bleary eyes tried to focus on the man scowling down at him, fingers still gripping his hair.
in such a way was— it was supposed to be something reserved for lovers… for
It was so
When Draco’s sluggish mind finally reminded him that Ron was still waiting for an answer, he did his best to force on an easy smile, nodding his head in answer.
, an urgent message, was it? I guess that explains why you came home smelling like
“Never…”
When he finally opened the bathroom door, he came face to face with a very distressed looking Hermione, an ever-present crease between her brow as her gaze travelled over his face.
“Ron…”
”Ron.”
Before the Alpha could even get a second glance, the Omega was on him, tiny body springing up like a kitten and tackling him to the ground, a furious shriek accompanying an attack of nails and teeth.
Yes, a nice little cottage in the country sounded nice… and maybe, maybe Hermione and Ron would still want to see him after?
“Kid…”
“They are… no longer with us?”
“She’s already lost her parents… she couldn’t lose this place too. And then, of course, when she got pregnant, we just wanted to settle down on a nice place without all the
“Draco!”
They followed the gesture, Hermione sending Draco one last encouraging smile before she tugged a reluctant Ron out of the room.
“Or are you more of a maple man?”
Hola! ✨
”I don’t know a lot about… well, uh, you know, in my day, health classes were pretty badly
Ron asked suddenly, the question seeming to surprise even himself. Draco clasped his hands together, his mouth opening to answer before he had even decided what to say. He wasn’t used to people talking to him like this, like what he said was important.
“Before this… your father had been meeting with a few Alpha’s, from respectable houses, of course-“
Draco heaved, his voice coming out cracked and broken as he tried to struggle under the Alpha’s appraising stare, whimpering pathetically when he felt a thick finger brush over his clenching hole.
The spell was hissed and Draco’s body froze again, this time with his legs splayed across the ground and his back hunched uncomfortably where Harry had pushed him.
The only time he saw his father was at dinnertime, and that was an excruciating affair. No one ever talked, no one ever
, so…
Harry growled, his hot breath mingling with Draco’s as he continued to struggle under him. Harry’s jaw clenched in irritation, his fingers further tightening around Draco’s slender wrists, pulling another pained whine from the Omega, only for him to further his impossible fight to escape.
But, that didn’t stop Harry’s clothes from smelling like him, the heavy royal-blue coat that Hermione had taken for him so strongly stinking of Alpha, Draco had wondered if he had somehow managed to inject his scent into every fibre.
She hummed, her eyes already started to stray back to the page, as if she was on an interesting passage that she couldn’t bear to leave.
Pretty and scentless…
”N-No, I wouldn’t— it wasn’t to make m-me sick!”
”No, it’s fine, I’m not really that hungry anyway.”
What do we think? Things are about to get crazy me thinks 👀 any guesses on what’s to come next? What’s Ron gonna do? ✨
, was the very real and very scary fact, that Draco... was hard.
... the fire inside of them...
“But—“
Draco choked out, his voice wavering as his head started to spin, a swirling nausea traveling up his throat.
There was a whisper of something, a hushed murmur of words before the burning pain below started to dissipate, only leaving him with the oddest sensation of…
I hope you liked the chapter, I had a really small window today to write and post this so I hope it’s alright!
He murmured, tilting his head forward towards her outstretched hand so that she could feel his forehead. She gave him a look he couldn’t quite read but quickly covered it with a smile.
The Alpha breathed in a satisfied breath, rolling his shoulders back as he smirked at the trembling boy bowed down at his feet.
He didn’t make it.
Draco asked, dragging one slender finger through the syrupy mix before he brought it to his mouth, parting his lips slightly and wrapping them around the coated digit as he sucked on it with a moan.
He warned, his arm around Draco’s chest caging him in, the hardening rod at the Omega’s back fitting so seamlessly against the curve of his ass. Like it was meant to be there.
Harry snarled, his teeth sinking into the boy’s ear with a growl. Draco didn’t seem to even notice, his body strangely slumped against the wall, his weight only held up by Harry’s own heavy form.
Harry said as evenly as he could, the last few words not escaping the sharp growl that had been building in his chest.
Hermione's words trailed off as she watched the Omega half stumble through the door, his eyes glazed and unfocused before he raised his head slowly and blinked up at the both of them.
Draco huffed, cocking his head to the side as he watched Harry’s mouth twist in irritation.
She whispered to him softly, letting him breathe her scent, keeping her pheromones comforting and calm— just the way he liked.
“She told you all that, did she?”
The Alpha roared, his heavy body rolling over swiftly and trapping the boy’s struggling form underneath him. His hands quickly coming up to grip Draco’s flailing wrists, slamming them to the ground hard enough for the boy to let out a sharp cry.
Draco called over his shoulder, already disappearing into the kitchen with a swish of his hips.
Draco sighed again, ignoring the cold chill that ran up his spine as he slowly opened the door, wincing as it let out a groaning creak.
According to Lucius, releasing one’s pheromones was a primitive practise reserved only for mudbloods and common folk.
“The gravy’s my recipe. There’s a secret ingredient I use.”
She went to fuss over his now rumpled clothes, but Draco shrugged out of her grip quickly, her uninhibited scent already clinging to him and turning his stomach.
The Alpha’s cock hung heavy and thick between his legs, already pulsing with need, filled and ready to take the Omega purring so prettily for him.
He sighed dramatically, his cheeks warming when Hermione just gifted him an another amused grin in reply.
“Draco, we still have half an hour until the end of class, and I already let you off early yesterday.”
Draco sighed, scrunching up his eyes as he groaned under his breath. It was fine. Everything was going to be ok.
“Ron’s home.”
of course, we can’t forget the best part! That I was left there to sit in a puddle of my own cold piss... because I refused to trade pleasantries for food like a trained chimpanzee. But thank you, thank you so very much for this lovely meal.”
“Look, kid, this isn’t a punishment, alright? Your mother sent me here to
Fuck!
“I’m sorry?”
The Beta had finished the tour by showing him the horses, letting a nervous Draco pet the beasts until he had freaked out at the animal’s braying whinny and tripped over his own feet, only to fall on his ass in front of Ron.
The conversation had had a few hiccups, but all in all, it had been an interesting evening.
A few good hours had passed after that, and he heard the familiar sounds of Ron and Hermione retiring to their rooms. He still couldn’t relax, not when his heart had forgotten how to beat at a steady pace.
Draco suddenly gasped desperately, his breath coming hard and fast before he convulsed against the wall… and then… something sweet started to drift into the air.
The sight before him would have brought him to his knees— had he not been poisoned with a potion that left him unable to move a single muscle.
Draco drowned the words out, instead letting his head nuzzle into the warmth of the Alpha’s belly, giving himself this single moment, this second of reprieve before he would have to push him away.
“Stop!”
“Draco.”
Draco’s words were cut off when another spell forced his lips to seal, his body frozen on the spot as the smell of breakfast drifted around him.
Draco shuddered, his eyes continuing to blink dazedly in the dark.
tight it felt like he was simultaneously trying to push him out and suck him back in. The Alpha roared as he felt himself coming to his end, a coursing rage of pleasure so strange and unique it felt like it was ripping him apart.
Draco ran, not even picking a direction, his body just surging towards the dim light of the hallway.
Harry gave his same warning, watching Draco closely with his hand on his wand.
how it felt… it was more like Draco had been flung into a time and place that stood completely still. It was living, it was breathing… and yet it was not entirely

Harry growled, his lip twitching when Draco just chuckled softly, picking up his fork again and digging in.

“Eggs, kid, could you go grab them?”
Draco murmured, his words twisting into something strange and new as his lips slowly started to stretch into a feline grin.

No cliffhanger this time, promise 😈🤞
could see it, so could they.
”I’m tired… I think I’ll, um, sleep now. Sorry.”
“I can barely smell you, but you’re definitely alpha.”
Draco said with a shrug, annoyed with himself for volunteering more information then she had asked for… but something about the way she was so quick to put him at ease made him lower his guard a little.
So... why did that dream leave him feeling so sad?
Fuck, that hurt— that look of pure dejection directed right at Ron.
A hot stream of piss landed on Draco’s horrified face then as Harry grunted above him, aiming his cock and releasing the torrent down over the omega’s chest and thighs, soaking his clothes and marking every inch of his chilled flesh.
“It’s peppermint tea. Very muggle, I know, but I always loved it as a young girl.”
“He didn’t want one.”
The worst part of all this was… Draco had actually come to crave every touch, every stroke of his hair, every warm embrace. He would happily crawl up and die if it meant that he could just spend his last few minutes pressed up against another body.
“What’s for dinner? Don’t tell me it’s that
Harry stared at the door for a moment longer than necessary before he threw his hands up in the air in defeat and pulled out his wand, wracking his brain for a spell that would be able to slap on the right basecoat and dry it so that they could start painting it… by
The voice said, amused.
and the fact that there was a seed of sickness already starting to burrow deep in his gut.
“Bite me.”
easy task.
She said carefully, her eyes crinkling in a small smile as she gave his hand one last reassuring squeeze and let go. Draco cleared his throat, blinking quickly when he felt that humiliating sting prickle at his eyes.

“But aren’t my parents paying you?”
”Yup, just like her mother.”
… his muscles not used to it, his cheeks aching deliciously when he crawled into bed each night, memorising every second of his day so he could never forget a thing, nothing ever too insignificant for him to latch onto.
Leave this place.
Harry’s anger had died down a little after his shower, the warm water flowing over his tense muscles and slowly washing the last hour away. He knew he had to get back down there again, give Draco the instruction and his time, only to probably only do it all over again for the next hour.
using it.
then and
It would only be a matter of time before he would be clutching his belly in pain again, wracked by vicious cramps that refused to subside no matter how much he cried.
“Why the muggle farm?”
He watched the Beta flick a surprised glance to him, an odd twitch of his lips hinting at the start of a smile.
“You’re serious? You want to paint the house… by
She grinned, grabbing herself a plate next before seating herself at the other side of the table. Draco nodded, clearing his throat as he smoothed down his bed-hair, grimacing when Hermione smirked at the action.
Draco asked, the disbelief evident in your tone. Ron just shrugged, leaning against the barn with a yawn.
“Oh… ah, no, I just… it’s…”
Draco hummed, still not entirely present, his brow creased a little from the thought still clinging to him.
“Don’t you have a job?”
Ron shoved his way through to pull Hermione out of the man’s grip, but the Alpha was already dropping her hand, two narrowed green eyes staring down at Draco.
here… but he missed his home. Missed his bed.
“My darling, you know that if I had the power to, I would make this all go away… but I can’t.”
“Insolent!”
Ron asked, his words half-rushed and unsure. Draco just smiled shyly, his heart thumping heavy in his chest when Ron gave him an answering grin.
“What the hell, Draco? Why would you do that?”
Ron shrugged, holding up a banana before waggling it in front of the boy. Draco giggled, actually
. Fuck, the dreams he had about this man. He woke up almost every morning with a mess of slick through his sheets... the cleaning spell had become a morning ritual.
(See the end of the chapter for
He didn’t know what was wrong with him, didn’t know why it was affecting him this way, he couldn’t even blame it on an upcoming heat. He was still a good month away before his next one and there was no way he could blame it purely on Harry’s scent either…
“Enough!”
Draco whispered, before turning on his heels and marching to his room. He didn’t shower, didn’t brush his teeth, didn’t even change, just flung off his shirt and dived under the covers, his mind going over the mess that had been the last few hours.
Lucius had been able to go to school, to interact with a wide range of students with their own unique pheromones and scents— he hadn’t been locked away like some
… of his own bodies sick desire.
The look was finished with a pair of thigh-high boots, a matching noir that contrasted devilishly with his moonlight skin and silver hair, hair that was slicked back and tucked behind his ears.
”Yes, he means well, he’s just funny with these things. You should have seen him when Rose went into rut for the first time, I don’t think I saw him leave the kitchen once. We were eating pancakes every day for a week. He cooks when he’s stressed— well, I suppose you probably already noticed that.”
“Did you really think that was a smart thing to do, Draco?”
He murmured, clenching his hands into fists when he saw them start to shake, clearing his throat quickly as he dropped his eyes back onto his closed workbook, trembling fingers moving quickly to find the page.
“Hermione…”
Her eyes seemed to dawdle on his face, biting her lip as she reached forward and gently placed the back of her hand to his forehead.
Ron nodded quickly and tried to hide the doubt in his eyes.
“I said no!”
Draco woke up, jolting up in his bed, sheets tangled in his sweaty legs and he quickly kicked them away, needing anything and everything that touching his heated skin
”Kid,”
He trailed off, scowling when Hermione gave him a wry smile.
So here we go! Thank you for being so patient, and thank you for all the lovely comments xXx
Ron grunted, spearing a piece of potato before shoving it in his mouth. Draco finished his mouthful, taking a sip of water before loading up his fork again.
Then, he would probably dream of pumpkin-butterbeer soup and wait until his father threw him at the next available Alpha.
Draco said dismissively, blinking when he caught his own tone.
“40 minutes. I could do this all day, brat.”
Hermione murmured, her hand coming back up to tuck a strand of loose hair behind his ear… which made Draco think of
’ He could already hear his father say, with a sneer in his voice, eyes as cold as his heart. Green eyes.
So, this chapter gave me HELL. I kept rewriting the first half so many times before I just gave up and decided to stop touching it lmaoo ugh
you, and that’s what I’m going to do. For the next few months, I’ll guide you into becoming an upstanding young man of your rank, we’ll get this house into tip-top shape, and
Ron asked, flicking his head to the side when Draco didn’t move. The Beta bumped his shoulder playfully, making Draco blink out of his daze and look up at the older man.
“Wha-“
”It’s alright, dear, everything is going to be ok.”
They both shuddered in union as the pulse of the mark sealed them together in a powerful surge of an ancient decree.
It was getting harder to pretend.
Harry
When the shock finally wore off, Draco was clawing at the ground, kicking and screaming as he elbowed the alpha in the gut, a raging satisfaction curling in his stomach when he heard Harry suck in a pained breath.
Ahhhhhhh it’s hereeee, the truth comes outtttttt!!!
Ron said proudly, waving his fork at Draco.
... frozen in place for hours, without even my voice to scream for help.”
“Your mother explained about the troubles you’ve had at home. People trying to break into the house, the threats on your life, how there were whispers about a kidnapping attempt—“
Ron asked softly, forcing his voice to stay steady, calm, without accusation.
Hermione said, waving her hand in front of his face to get his attention. Draco blinked, frowning for a moment before he slipped on a smile.
Draco purred, his eyes flicking over Harry's form for a beat before he looked away again.
Ron asked, suddenly walking forward out of Draco’s reach and into the room. Draco slunk back behind the door frame and out of sight as he heard Ron take the mystery visitor into a hug, both men chuckling fondly at each other.
“Healing spell.”
Draco sighed, stabbing his fork back into his pasta and shoving it into his mouth. He had attempted to slow himself down, lest he be
bad before?
Draco managed to hastily crumple up his sheets and stuff them under the bed before he pulled out a spare set from the looming wardrobe in the corner of his room. He didn’t understand the need for an extra set when there was magic but he silently thanked the past muggles of Hermione's family for the forethought and attempted to wrangle the sheets on the large bed.
“What did you say?”
often enough.”
“Why? Because I’m an Omega?”
, when he was sitting on his haunches, his eyes in line with his tutors’ ugly cock, all he could do was gawk at it, his body trembling in a mixture of fear, revulsion… and
He scented the room, sucking in a startled breath when he smelt the lingering scent of two Alphas… Harry and Hermione.
“Harry! What is
”Can you look at me, please?”
“It doesn’t matter. You crossed a line, darling, and the Ministry was all too happy to have a Malfoy’s head on the chopping block.”
“Because you’re a child.”
“I need you, I need, oh,
Draco hadn’t noticed that his hair was no longer in the man’s grasp, only realising when his head slumped and the man’s eyes were no longer in his line of vision.
cooked him anything like this before.
Harry hummed in understanding, grabbing a handful of tissues before he handed them to her.
Ron almost ran into the kitchen, leaving Hermione and Draco alone. After an awkward beat Draco gingerly took his seat as the Alpha’s eyes watched him carefully. She reached out a hand only to pull it back again when Draco jolted away from her.
He patted down his robes, turning to grab his case so he could drag it in front of him before settling himself on the floor with a huff, his eyes scanning the empty room.
As the two fell into a seamless system of pancake batter and bananas, there was a strange muttering of muffled voices drifting from the direction of the lounge room.
“Your parents told us what happened, Draco. I’m so very sorry you had to go through all that. No matter what happened in the past, no child should be subjected to that kind of treatment.”
He wouldn’t look at Ron, and that very action made the Beta’s stomach twist.
At least, that’s what it felt like.
The Alpha’s face split into a wide smile at that, and Draco had a hard time trying to keep himself from getting sucked into it. Had anyone ever smiled at him like that before?
to come.
Just as Draco had commanded, Harry had hidden his scent, amazingly well, for someone who wasn’t from a pureblood line.
He sniffled, wiping his face with the back of his arm, closing his eyes briefly as he curled up on his side, his bottom lip trembling.
Draco finally snapped, before he breezed past her towards the hall. He paused for a beat, closing his eyes as he let out a slow breath.
“It’s torturous, isn’t it? Being unable to move… unable to speak, just… totally and completely
“So, I thought that we could start classes tomorrow, just so today you can get a little more comfortable, maybe explore the farm a bit? Ron will run you through what chores you’ll be doing once he’s back from work.”
Just as that thought struck him, there was a light knock on his door, causing him to jolt back into the hard wood of his bedframe.
He murmured, his voice strangely breathy as he went to move past them. Ron quickly placed a hand on his shoulder, stopping his retreat.
Harry growled, a wild grin stretching his lips as he licked the small trickle of blood running down Draco’s ear, his tongue grazing over the teeth marks he had left there.
“Ouch. That almost hurt my feelings.”
Harry tried to find himself through the fog of his rut, trying to grasp onto something concrete, but all he could smell was that
”He had to go. I’m fine. Bed rest for the week.”
I’m soooo sorry about the wait 😭 After the last chapter I actually got a new full time job— which, in itself, ate up a
“N-No…”
Draco was still on the floor, a horrified expression on his face as the creature’s tongue flopped from his oversized mouth, whining again before turning to slobber all over Hermione’s face.
She asked softly, tucking a strand of his hair behind his ear as he made to speak.
Ron asked, jolting Draco out of another daze.
“I told you to
Harry replied, opening the overhead cupboard and pulling out two plates before he placed them down on the kitchen bench.
He breathed, hard body grinding against Draco’s leg as he keened beneath the Alpha.
He murmured, pressing a kiss to the soft fur of his head. Rubeus whined again.
“Yes, Draco, you’re going to be living here for a year, so you will be expected to help out a little.”
And it was
He said softly, the disbelief in her voice making him inwardly cringe. Had he really looked
He didn’t even have his wand anymore to clean the mess. Hermione still hadn’t noticed that fact yet as he had managed to hide it from her only because she had suspended 'practised magic' classes while he was sick.
I hope you’ve all enjoyed your weekend!
“In the eyes of the law, Draco, you’re still a child. An omega isn’t considered an adult until the age of twenty-five years, and you’ve only just turned nineteen, you little brat. So, like it or not, you’re under my care now. I would advise you to be very careful not to push me anymore.”
“This is
Draco let Blaise’s fingers stray down to the curve of his ass before he finally pushed the alpha off with a smirk.
“Hermione said you have an interest in potions, Draco? Well, I’ve been experimenting with Flobberworm mucous, but instead of using it as a thickener as you would in potions, I’ve found that it adds this really great buttery flavour to my pie pastry.”
news?”
By the time dinner time rolled around, Ron’s anxiety had grown into a tangible mass still slowly expanding in his gut. Draco had offered to help, which was actually a nice surprise considering he had spent the last week in bed.
The witch sighed, moving her hands to cross them over her chest as she held his eyes. Draco tried not to let the confusion show, his teeth sinking into the side of his cheek.
Oop. Cliffhanger 🤭
The Beta mumbled under his breath, his scent spiking with a bristling agitation. It went straight to Draco’s head, the heavy smell wafting over to him quickly and encumbering his concentration. The Omega grit his teeth, pressing his body further into the wall to keep his stance strong.
“For the last time, that was Ron’s fault. I told him that adding butterbeer was a terrible idea.”
“No…”
Yes, the boy was
The heavy arm around his waist tightened, a warning grunt from the Alpha behind him.
The Alpha’s eyes narrowed a little at that, almost unnoticeable under his smile.
There was a flash of something on his face, something Draco couldn’t name. Fear? Concern? Shame? It was gone before he could even decide, replaced once more by a hardened glare.
“Fine, you monster, ruin my weekend why don’t you?”
“Unmated?”
”I’m pregnant.”
“Hm?”
Draco choked out, heart leaping out of his chest as he wrapped his arms around his shoulders. He felt
“I think we need to have a little talk, Draco.”
. That was exactly what Harry had wanted to see.
“Expelliarmus.”
. Please tell Ron I’m not up to it tonight.”
. Each new breath filling his lungs with the sweet scent still permeating off the creature he had claimed. Harry smiled with a hum, nuzzling into the boy’s slender neck and pressing his nose to his newly marked scent glad.
This was Harry’s job, getting wealthy offspring in line before they could do any more harm to their parents’ reputations, and he was
“Fuck, kid, why? Why would do that to yourself?”
Harry hadn’t even realised he had stopped blocking his scent, hadn’t noticed the sour turn of his pheromones pumping heavily into the small room.
She winked, her disposition changing so quickly and severely that Draco almost lost his breath. They chatted for a while after that, the Alpha lighting up at any talk of academics. He could feel her excitement through her expression, through her voice, her scent shifting into an oddly sweet and airy aroma.
Draco just cocked his head to the side in mock confusion, stabbing the soaked pancake with his fork and ripping off a piece to shove in his mouth.
“Ron’s at work, so you have to put up with my cooking today.”
Ron suddenly said, his voice unusually gentle, his eyes shining. Draco held his gaze, his gut twisting again.
Harry asked with a growl, tightening his grip on his already bruised wrists. Harry saw Draco’s hands then, his eyes widening when he spied the blood on his pale fingers.
There was also the irritating fact that the kid had a special talent for annoying the hell out of him— not to mention that on top of it all... the little shit was disturbingly gorgeous as well.
“Plus, you know, it’s actually been quite profitable. There’s been a recent surge of interest with muggle things in the wizarding world, so we do pretty well handmaking our own cheeses and selling the milk and wheat. It was good for Rose, too, she was able to grow up away from the city and she learned to appreciate good hard work.”
Now... that burden had insulted that friend and Draco didn’t have to wonder whose side they would take.
Oh, Merlin.
Harry looked...
“You know
Ok, enough from me— thank you for reading!! xX
Draco asked, the surprise genuine in his voice. Ron’s grin widened, the sight of it raising the Omega’s eyebrows.
knows his way around the kitchen, aren’t I lucky?”
He murmured, gripping his knife and fork until his pale hands turned a shade whiter.
Just another minute…
Hermione chuckled, watching Ron take a beat before he realised her meaning.
... not because of what they were doing in it… but because he had
calling me that.”
Draco started to struggle then, using what little he had left of his strength to yank himself away, the force of it surprising the Alpha enough that he let go, his answering roar melding with Draco’s own cry when the half-deflated knot was ripped from his hole.
“Oh? About
“Morning, daddy.”
”A potion to make you sick?”
test.
“He was a gift from a friend.”
He shouldn’t have done that. This was Hermione and Ron’s friend, and they had explicitly asked if he would be ok with this.
For the first time that night, Draco felt real fear.
Draco said, watching Hermione wince.
“Why should I?”
As soon as he transported back to his room, he was already making his way out the door and down the stairs, taking each step two at a time.
The words were out of his throat before he could stop them, the heaviness of them weighing down the quiet chatter between the boy and his mate.
Harry smirked for a moment before he let his expression turn cold.
He made it to the bathroom, stumbling naked through the hall, slamming the door and locking it in a half-dazed panic.
“A dog? Isn’t an owl or a cat more… fitting?”
He already felt uneasy in this room, with this boy, without a scent to attach to him. Harry didn’t know how he had smelt him that day of their first meeting, not when he had just sat through an entire dinner with him and not picked up a whisperer of a scent at all.
“Get off m-me!”
“Oh, Merlin! I’m so sorry, dear, he’s usually not this friendly. Sit, Rubeus, sit! Good boy, there we go, good boy.”
, shall we?”
He could smell the change in her scent, the calming wave of Alpha pheromones that instantly eased his nerves and made him sigh. He hated when she did that.
So, why did he
Ron said, a strange seed of excitement ever-growing in his voice as he leaned closer to Draco, his eyes dancing under the ceiling light. Draco couldn’t help but be pulled in to the man’s enthusiasm, his own eyes widening at his words.
“A job? Do you have one? Or, do you just enjoy inviting yourself over to people’s places for a free meal?”
A bond… the
“Quiet now, my darling, you didn’t let me finish. Your father had been planning to have you mated this summer, but because of… this
Potter, the man whose name had been flung around throughout the entirety of his childhood— a hidden newspaper that he had found stuffed in his mother’s vanity— a curse on his father’s lips whenever he thought no one was around…
, his hands rushing to his mouth to cut off the obscene sound.
That was just another thing he would have to worry about,
Draco asked tentatively, biting his tongue when he saw Ron give him a look.
The Beta raised his eyebrows at that, all but cocking his head at Draco’s words.
“Oh…”
”You can tell me anything, Draco, you don’t have to be afraid to talk to me, ever. I want you to think of me as a safe place.”
Rubeus continued to watch him quietly, blinking up at him as he let out another soft whine.
“Honey-milk weed and dried acklelope petal… is that what you took?”
“I’m Mr. Potter. I assume your mother has informed you of my employ?”
Draco felt hot, his skin blistering like an alien sun as he writhed against him. It was like he could feel everything around him, too much, too fast, his heart racing under another wave of crashing pheromones.
He probably got his looks from his mother, then, Harry mused. He couldn’t really remember what the witch looked like after all these years, but he could take a guess.
, like the phantom of a nightmare, it was now only but a distant and distorted memory.
of my time— and before that I had signed up to a bunch of fic exchanges, so, basically, any and all time I had left after work was used in a mad scramble to write a story for each coming exchange by the fast approaching deadlines 🙈
Draco asked with a wry smile, catching the Beta’s eye roll when he finally realised that Draco was watching him.
“He said it was normal, just… Omega stuff. It’s my… time.”
. Quiet shuddering sobs wracking his slender frame as he shivered in Harry’s embrace.
He smirked, shaking his head when Draco’s eyes narrowed into slits, the Omega finally dropping his arms to his sides briskly before sticking his tongue out at the amused man.
He felt raw, exposed, the remnants of the dream refusing to drift from his mind, dragging him under.
Ron started, his words leaving him when Draco flinched at the sound of his own name on Ron’s lips.
The wand Draco had been reaching for under his pillow was yanked from his finger tips and flung into the shadowed grasp of the man towering in the darkness of his room.
There were muffled voices, shouting… but Draco couldn’t focus on it, couldn’t focus on anything, all he wanted to do was leave.
Draco, now released from the magic’s confines, slumped to his side, a pitiful groan leaving his lips.
Harry muttered to himself under his breath, before he murmured his first attempt at a spell.
Draco nodded along but his mind reeled to catch up to what the man was saying… early stages?
Draco started, only for his mother to speak over him quickly, attempting to pull him back into her arms. He didn’t let her.
Draco nodded at Ron in answer, his head in the crook of Hermione’s neck as she gently trailed her fingers through his pale hair.
Draco suddenly said, biting his tongue when he saw Hermione frown at the shift in his mood. He tried to relax his shoulders, wondering when they had become so tense.
before he went and grabbed the rest of the condiments, settling an array of toppings on the small table in front of Draco’s watchful eyes.
“The gravy is wonderful.”
Draco cut her off, yanking himself out of her arms as he looked up at her wildly, his teeth clenching at the disappointment in her eyes.
“Mm?”
, yes, of course. It’s all coming back to me now.”
Harry’s steps faltered as he inched forward, his eyes going wide when saw that Draco was seated in a small puddle on the floor, a dark patch where the boy’s trousers were damp…
He had been sheltered all his life, even before he had presented as Omega, his parents hiding him away in the Manor in fear of retribution against their only son.
Draco’s body slumped to the floor, each breath coming out in a moan as he tried to drag himself to the door.
Harry
“Where did you disappear to–“
. Did he remember the Alpha? How could he ever forget?
“D-Don’t… hurt… her.”
“I wasn’t in my right mind, obviously. I would never have touched you if it wasn’t for you dumping a shitload of pheromones into the air.”
Well, alright, he was hungry, then.
If she knew what he had really done… she wouldn’t have looked at him so warmly.
“Alpha!”
Another shudder took his body as he crawled away on unsteady limbs, like a lamb taking its first few shaky steps across the rolling meadow.
Draco chocked out, but even he heard the false note in his own voice.
what I’m referring to, kid. It needs to be discussed.”
Ron didn’t laugh though, and even the playful eye roll had shifted into something grimmer.
Little hiccuped sobs escaped his throat as he brought his knees up into his chest. He was pathetic.
“Help yourself to as much as you want, there’s plenty.”
Draco huffed, his fingers clenching into a tight fist, his nails cutting into his palm to create little scarlet crescents.
Harry warned, watching the way the omega just stared at the plate, his stomach gurgling in protest.
Hi hi hi!! I’m back!! ✨
Something about the needy whine coming from his own mouth took him back, but all too soon he was grasping for Harry again, the heat of their skin melding together as the world around them slipped away.
When his time finally crawled to its finish, Draco was once again forced back into his chair, his eyes on his plate, the food now long
Harry murmured in his ear, the heat of his breath making him shiver. Draco tried shaking his head, only to let out a terrified moan when the Alpha’s fingers brushed up against his straining length.
“Eggs, bacon, toast.”
and, what? That was it?
… and then...
He commanded under his breath, nose nuzzling into his neck as a hot tongue traced sleepily over his freshly marked scent gland.
All Draco could see was this man, and those eyes… everything else was blurry, smudged.
“You feel it too, don’t you?”
Draco scrunched his eyes closed, trying to will away the answering sting that accompanied the realisation that in
He said, wincing when Hermione cocked her head at him.
Draco’s jaw clenched and he refused to meet her gaze, which only lead to another stretch of silence that left both of them grimacing at the floor.
… she had been crying.
it… what had happened here, what if he could never look at him the same way again, what if—
Draco raised his eyebrows, reaching out to grasp the cup, cautiously bringing it to his lips before taking a weary sip. It was good, really good, and strangely refreshing after such a big meal.
“Ah… yes, t-that sounds lovely, thank you.”
Something cold and slimy coiled in his stomach as he listened to them, his fork scraping across his plate as he swirled it around to gather a forkful of his barely touched pasta. He didn’t eat it, just continued to turn it in circles, liking the way the sound of it cut through the happy chorus of laughter grinding at his eardrums.
Those ingredients together made a potion that would make the one who drank it terribly
student to do that.”
It hit Draco like a punch to the stomach, that look, transported him back to two months ago when Ron had looked at him with barely hidden distaste, that same look of worry directed at Hermione, as if to say, ‘
Draco trailed off, grimacing when his mouth refused to answer the question with anything more substantial. The look Ron was giving him… he hated it when he became this stuttering nonsensical child, he wanted to look a little more grown-up than that.
”You won’t be needing that.”
Draco asked, his words overly sugared as he blinked up at the alpha.
“What do you think you’re doing?”
Draco murmured, finally dropping his hand; but not before he let his fingers slide down the seam of Harry’s button-up shirt.
“May I go to my room, now?”
He said quietly, a shaky hand reaching out to grab the cutlery, his eyes scanning the plate of food before trying to figure out where exactly to start. The house-elves had
The Alpha leapt forward with a growl, strong fingers instantly reaching out to wrap around the Omega’s right ankle before he dragged him back.
Draco finished lamely, his shoulders rising into a half-hearted shrug. Ron continued to watch him for a beat longer, those ocean-storm eyes flickering with something indiscernible before he finally looked away, cracking both eggs into a separate bowl and tipping them into the batter.
“You’re the one who— you’re… y-you
“Mm, handsome
Draco nodded again.
“You— what the
Draco asked, ignoring Harry’s words as he leaned back in the chair, stretching like a cat in the sun.
Also, I know that Hermione got her parents back in canon but I had to fudge the details a little for plot. Forgive me xx
He moved forward, past a large wooden table and to the next doorway, only to pause when he heard voices in the next room. He could hear a tinkling laugh, and a deeper, smoother voice as well… he lifted his nose a little, scenting the air. Alpha, of course… and Beta.
What could one lone
The Alpha let out a victorious groan when his eyes landed on the Omega’s little pink hole, slick already thick and glistening down the crack of his luscious ass… down his thighs.
Draco finally asked, kicking himself at the way his voice came out breathy and strained. Hermione leant forward, pulling him into a half hug and patting him on the back, her hair sticking to his wet skin.
Draco let out a soundless gasp, his mouth gaping in horror as his mind reeled.
He dropped his briefcase by the door, trying to ignore another contaminated lungful of air before he finally moved forward.
“Leaving here dressed like a slut… coming home smelling like
Draco wound his arms around the Alpha’s broad shoulders, pulling him impossibly close as he felt the finger retract, something far bigger taking its place…
The Alpha’s eyes flashed suddenly, his lips curling into a smile as he chimed in over Draco’s stumbled words.
without the cheeky Omega roaming the place.
Draco said, crossing his arms over his chest as the biting cold of the night finally started to register.
“C’mon, I’m hungry. How do you have your scones? We’ve got jam, marmalade, honey, cream…”
”I need to talk to you, Draco.”
Harry murmured slowly, his movements languid and relaxed as he walked to the end of Draco’s bed, the Omega’s wand held loosely in his grip. He tapped the wand absently, his eyes flicking over Draco’s form, covered only by a thin white sheet.
“What’s for breakfast?”
They had done that a lot, that look, so much so that Draco had to try and just tune it out… otherwise he truly
She sniffled with a small smile, dabbing her cheeks absently as she stared down at her slippers.
Harry leaned forward, his voice going dangerously quiet as he grasped Draco’s chin tightly to angle his head up so that their eyes were forced to meet.
It was the pain, that ever-increasing pulse of hurt that had been slowly travelling through his body… that was now
In the end, Harry stayed until the news was shared, grinning when his friend’s face split into the widest smile he had ever seen and pulled Hermione into his arms. Harry felt like he was intruding, but the both of them begged him to stay for a drink… which had turned into a
Someone was yelling but he didn’t know who, and soon insistent hands were tugging at him, leading him over to the warmth of the lounge room fire. He was sat down on a chair and covered in a blanket, and even after he mumbled something about ruining the couch, gentle fingers continued to brush through his hair.
“I slept all day?”
”I… I’m…”
“Well, this wasn’t for you, gorgeous, this was just a little a payback for a… certain
, Harry had tried to give the boy space, only to knock on his door a few hours later and check on him. Draco never answered him and the door was of course locked, so he decided the best course of action was to just leave him alone for the night.
Harry was on him, fingers scraping down his sides and grasping onto his hips to pull him forward. Draco moaned as he felt the Alpha’s unsheathed erection sliding hot and wet between his cheeks, painted in Draco’s own slick.
Draco mused, propping his elbow on the table and resting his chin in his hand. Harry glanced over his shoulder and raised a disapproving eyebrow before he went back to his task.
Draco asked wearily, scrunching up his nose as he looked up at Ron suspiciously. The Beta laughed, ruffling the Omega’s hair again and earning another annoyed scowl.
”It’s nice.”
“Hermione, what’s the emergency?”
how fucked up was that?
When Mrs Malfoy had warned him of her son’s demeanour, Harry hadn’t really believed the boy would pose much of a challenge. He had worked with teenagers before, from the down beaten beta following the wrong path, to the worst of the alpha delinquents the purebloods had thrown at him.
A chill ran down Draco’s back and more slick started to trickle down his legs, making him squeeze his thighs together desperately, as if that would stop it.
Draco stumbled back, not biting back his surprised gasp in time before it echoed through the quiet room.
Though, smelling whatever leftover pheromones that clung to the Alpha’s maroon button-up did horrible things for his hunger… and he wasn’t talking about his
Draco let out a pained hiss when Harry’s grip tightened in his hair, the alpha seemingly immune to Draco’s nails digging into his skin, scratching to be released.
He wondered if they ever noticed it, noticed the way he leaned into every touch, noticed how pathetically
“Is there any dessert?”
… that shouldn’t have hurt. He was a Malfoy, what was wrong with that?
When Ron returned home his stomach was still in knots. He had thought on it all day and couldn’t come up with any reason why Draco would be using those two ingredients… except
“Tomorrow’s Saturday! Do you really expect me to do that?”
When he finally saw it he blanched, his trembling fingers rushing to the spot and brushing up against the wet material.
Harry muttered, his eyes back on Draco, catching the slight flinch hidden behind the scowl.
The alpha paused for a moment, standing over the omega for a beat longer before he finally turned and walked out of the room without another word, closing the door quietly behind him.
Draco scoffed, leaning back in his chair and rolling his eyes.
It was a long and drawn-out moment before Draco finally did as he asked, his head rising slowly to reveal bleary eyes and a trembling bottom lip.
“20 minutes facing the wall. When your time is done, I expect an apology and a thank you for breakfast, then you can enjoy your meal with me. Let’s hope it won’t be
He instinctively went to clutch at his belly… only to find that his hands wouldn’t move from his sides, hanging limply as a surrounding numbness took over his entire body.
, that part hadn’t been exaggerated in the least.
“Please don’t be upset at her for telling me, even with our differences, as a mother myself, I can understand just how scary these past few months must have been for her… and you too, dear. She knows that this is the safest place for you, and my mate and I will do our absolute best to help you through your last year of schooling. Everything is going to work out just fine, ok?”
“What the fuck is wrong with you?”
“Banana?”
“You want me to… enjoy the chores?”
She smiled, her sing-song voice grating his mood even more. He glared at her, gripping his robes self-consciously when the scent of Alpha drifted from the woman.
Draco opened his mouth, not sure what to say to that. Everything she said was right, but it sounded so sad when she said it out loud.
What the fuck was wrong with him? He could already feel the shocked faces of Hermione and Ron staring at him, the weight of a heavy atmosphere crushing his ribcage with every steady breath.
With a curling grin, Draco picked up his plate and dumped its contents over Harry’s head, the toast flopping wetly on top of his dark hair, pieces of egg and bacon falling over his shoulders.
Draco sniffled, clutching his stomach as he peered up at Ron with hollow eyes. His breath had started to slow finally but his voice was still tight.

. Running down his legs and staining his pants.
“Should we add banana to the pancakes?”
”Breath, kid, it’s ok, just take a breath and tell me what you need to tell me. I’ll listen.”
OMG HI 😭♥️ I’m really terribly sorry about the major delay! If I’m being honest, this chapter gave me a hell of a time! I wrote the first half shortly after the last chapter... and then I just stopped. I couldn’t seem to get into it, everything I wrote sounded horribly crude 😩
Ron growled under his breath, a hand coming up to rub at his face tiredly as he listened to the Omega start to sniffle.
He walked to the bed, grimacing once more at the small size of it, huffing out loud as he pulled the covers back and jumped in, the springs creaking under his weight. It smelled like them.
He swallowed quickly, straightening himself up and pulling the quilt a little higher before he answered.

“Good morning.”
was his day.
“I can whip one up quickly, it’s really no trouble.”
She didn’t seem to believe him, her brow furrowing at the easy smile he was sending her way, but she chose not to push. They had been together for enough years now for her to know that if he wasn’t ready to share something… then it wasn’t much use trying to dig for it.
He reminded Harry of a cat.
Harry asked softly, pulling away from her so that he could see her face. She had stopped crying, which was a good start.
Draco sucked in a shallow breath, his heart thrumming in his ears at the way that voice tugged something deep inside of him, something that had been buried under a mountain of warmth that had piled up during his time here.
“You made this?”
She sighed, a heavy silence filling the room as her scent spiked in an uncomfortable sorrow. She spoke again, her voice once more back to her sing-song tone.
“You’ll stay with me just a little longer, won’t you, boy?”
Hope it’s ok! Love yas ♥️ Happy belated Mother's Day to all you yummy mummies xx
“Do you remember Harry? He stopped by–
“You sure seemed like a bitch in heat to me.”
… he... they weren’t even close! That kind of scent-marking wasn’t something you did with a practical
He said, trying to keep the agitation out of his tone. From Hermione’s expression, he hadn’t been so successful.
It didn’t end up taking him long at all to drift off to sleep, a sudden tiredness swarming over his body and propelling him into a restless slumber.
Draco nodded slowly in response, biting his lip as he looked down at the steaming mug.
Draco hissed, his words wavering when Harry forced more pressure on his trapped wrists. The Omega sucked in another pained breath, biting his lip to suppress a whimper when Harry’s grip tightened.
Revenge is a dish best served in a glass of freshly squeezed OJ 😌
“Very mature, kid.”
She mused, pursing her lips to hide another smile when Draco dropped his eyes to the floor and continued to ignore her.
After a moment the light started to shimmer and before Draco could reach out and touch it, it finally disappeared beneath his skin.
Draco murmured, shakily placing his fork back down on his plate.
Draco dropped his head back on the desk with a bang, wincing at the jolt of pain that gripped his skull quickly before it let him go.
Draco slumped back into the door, letting it slowly close behind him as he let out a slow breath.
“Everything is going to work out just fine, Draco. You’re safe here, I promise.”
A lone sob slipped from Draco’s throat, his heavy limbs scrambling to pull himself away from the Alpha still pressing kisses down his nape, lips searing over his bonding bite, as if they were just two lovers in the thrall of a romantic tryst.
She huffed, watching Draco as he brushed his fingers over the cooling pad, a tired smile on his lips.
Harry murmured, flicking his gaze over to the omega, watching him wearily as the boy pulled out a chair and sat himself down.
The Chosen One has arrived. Dun, dun, dun.
When Harry had gotten this gig, he had assumed that he had signed up for a recluse omega teenager in need of a little guidance. He hadn’t exactly thought to heed the woman’s warning.
like he weighed no more than a stiff breeze.
Ron’s grunted after her. Draco did a half-wave behind him as he disappeared, shaking his head when he felt a small smile spill onto his face.
Draco frowned, his hand reaching up slowly to touch his cheek, jolting when he felt a wetness there. He was crying.
“I apologise, Draco, what happened yesterday… it shouldn’t have happened at all. I had no intention of leaving you last night, but I got an urgent message and–“

“He wasn’t saying your name.”

, again.
— I suppose it’s not much better nowadays, it’s not really—“
Draco scowled, kicking out at the fallen case, trying to pull back the bubbling anger that was steadily rising through his chest.
“Are you hungry, kid? What can I make you? Pancakes? Or— you want a big English breakfast, right? Extra ruby-weed on the side?”
“Draco, I have something to ask you, and I need you to be honest with me.”
Draco sucked in a quiet breath, not liking the way those words touched something tender inside of him, like when someone pressed down on a bruise.
, you know that, don’t you pet?”
“Your father.”
At least they had stopped laughing.
“I suppose I shouldn’t ask if you want another serving, then?”
She trailed off, her face screwing up as a sob escaped her lips. Harry pulled her into him, wrapping his arms around her as he let her cry into his chest.
Harry ordered, holding up Draco’s plate as he waited.
Well... what did ya think? 👀 I know, no Harry yet, but I had to flesh out the story a little before his entrance. Tout vient à point à qui sait attendre 😘
Draco muttered, voice thick with tears as he sniffed and nuzzled into Hermione’s neck, leaving a damp patch on her shirt collar.
She replied, and the sounds of before came to a sudden stop.
Three words whimpered over and over again, the Omega’s body trembling viciously against him, all of his previous fight long forgotten.
Draco cut her off, his voice cold and quiet, his throat already constricting at the scent of that man on the witch he had come to adore.
From the Alpha... that had taken everything from him.
Draco sighed, pushing himself to his feet, leaving his bag behind and following the direction that the Alpha had disappeared in. The room he entered was much like the last; simple, dated… and oddly cosy. So different to the dark looming walls of Malfoy Manor.
He murmured quietly before he pulled the pad up to rest against his belly. Hermione grinned, cupping his cheek gently and pressing a kiss to his forehead.
Ron started, his brow already creasing as he darted his eyes from the pantry and over to where his mate was sitting, her chin resting on her hand as she glanced up from the book she was reading.
Ron finished, clearing his throat when he caught Draco’s confused expression.
The Beta had tried a few things, the supportive friend, the warm father figure, the overly happy uncle… today it seemed he was trying out a crisp strict-dad routine.
Draco asked, his voice low, head bowed when he couldn’t meet her eyes.
“Let me go, I’m going to be
The place was a complete
Hermione watched them with wide eyes as they both made their way to Draco’s room, the boy stepping through first before he slowly sank down onto his bed and dropped his head.
“Mm.”
“Draco…”
“Mr Potter, but of course, you can call me Harry.”
He would find it eventually, he always did. But, for now… for now, he would just enjoy it.
Draco gave an embarrassed nod before he grabbed the forgotten banana and started peeling it, asking Ron how he wanted it prepared.
He wiped his tears, finally stemming the flow as he sniffled miserably, the ghost of Harry’s arms wrapped around his body, making him whimper.

They worked together in a comfortable silence after that, Ron giving orders and Draco following them diligently, a little

“I’ll give this to the chickens, too.”
Ron paused for a moment before his lips tugged into a warm smile, a hand coming up to rest on Draco’s shoulder.
“You know, Draco, I think we’re going to get along just fine.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Pleasantries should never be used to barter for hostage food.”
The Alpha’s eyes were on him, cold eyes, green eyes.
Oh, Merlin… he had
The Omega nodded quickly, a quiet smile on his lips as he smashed down the feelings that came bubbling up at those words.
Draco’s mind continued to reel, the entirety of what had just happened swimming through his head in a swirling fog. The more he tried to make sense of it, the less
“I’m fine.”
Draco was too
Hermione stayed by his bedside as he sipped at the steaming cup— and Ron moved in and out of the room, bringing back snacks and various drinks to litter his bed-side table with.
, and after that, Draco would be sent to his room to do his revisions for what he had learned that day… before washing up and going to bed.
She whispered with a wink before she finally stepped back from him, smoothing down her shirt as she sighed.
He said cheerily, ignoring Harry’s look as he moved a single pancake to his plate and started spreading butter over it, before dousing it with a generous serving of golden syrup.
Draco gasped, moving forward to clutch at his mother’s pretty gown, wrinkling the material in a desperate grip.
Draco started, and Harry gave him an encouraging nod before he continued on.
good at it, too.
Hermione asked, her voice flickering with a note of concern. This wasn’t the first time she had asked him, and it most likely wouldn’t be the last. It had been almost two weeks since
Draco rolled onto his side as he whimpered, hands moving down to his entrance as a wave of pain took his body. He let out another broken cry as he felt the Alpha’s seed trickle down his legs, hot and sticky on his fingers. Blood. There was blood too.
I hope you all had an amazing weekend ☀️

He murmured, before he wiped his eyes and turned away from her, hugging the cooling pad to his belly.
He glanced back at Harry, his eyes shining brightly as he did a little twirl, Harry’s eyes helplessly grazing over his form, catching the way the shorts ended just a little above the curve of his ass.
Like it was
“Night, kid.”
Harry tore his eyes away from him with a sigh, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Well, I’m going to check on him, is he in his room?”
”Sorry, I just heard that this can help a little during— ah, this time. It’s charmed, so it will keep cold.”
Narcissa shushed him easily, her hand once more coming up to comb through his hair. She was going to miss that.
She finally sighed, dropping her head into her hands as Harry rubbed her back worriedly, waiting for her breathing to calm.
“Mm, remind me to get on your bad side, then.”
It made her upset, to imagine a child devoid of the very thing that was imperative to their development.
The man suddenly said, interrupting Hermione as he audibly sniffed the air. Draco paled, his legs suddenly wobbly as he took in those words.
Everything
“Kid, I… you’re
lopsided smile and
Hermione nodded, chuckling softly as she wiped her cheeks.
Draco bit out, right before he thrust his head forward and smacked it right into the Alpha’s nose.
Ron grinned, his face lighting up for the first time since Draco had met him.
The witch didn’t take a second pause before she was carefully opening the door, the warmth of her scent instantly filling the room and easing his nerves. She unfortunately couldn’t replace Harry, though, his scent seemed to cling stubbornly to the walls, like an unwelcome guest that had long overstayed their welcome.
Ron said evenly, sighing again when Draco’s mouth dropped.
There was a long and stunned silence before Harry finally snarled out a curse, his chair screeching back as he grabbed Draco roughly by the wrist, a growl rumbling through his chest as he manhandled him into the corner and shoved him down by his shoulders, grabbing his wand.
She smiled, leaning down to kiss his forehead when he made no move to pull out of her grasp. She let her scent drift around him, the calming effect pulling a shuddering sigh from her son. He leant into her unconsciously, his head nuzzling against the hand she held against his cheek.
And the smell.
It was just this damn
Hermione distinctly remembered the Alpha roaming the school halls like some kind of scentless nightmare, delighting in the fact that he could prey on the younger students by sneaking up on them unawares and terrorising them in a way that only Lucius could… but he still had it better than Draco.
“I’m here, I’m here, hold on.”
Draco coughed out, scratching at the imposing hand as the fingers tightened a little more. His eyes had adjusted finally in the looming darkness and he got his first proper look at the alpha on top of him.
“It must have been hard, sleeping in a different bed… in a different house. You didn’t get out much before this, did you?”
“You’re not my first omega client, and you’re certainly not my first wayward charge either. If it eases your mind, I am on suppressants and I can assure you that I have
with you? Get off him!”
“I’m guessing it’s not such a pleasure to meet me, hm?”
Hello hello! Easter holidays proved to be fruitful, so here is another chapter 😘♥️
*Warning* a quick reminder to please please reread the tags if you need ♥️ It’s not too late to turn back now xx
“There’s just a lot of history there, dear, nothing for you to worry about. I promise, if you wish it so, I can make sure that Harry doesn’t come to the house anymore if you’re scared of him.”
Draco bit out through each heavy pant, his words slow and slurred.
“I am in
Of course, they noticed. How could they not?
It took Draco a long while to realise that Harry was next to him again, hands strangely gentle as they rubbed his back. He was murmuring something too, and Draco had to grasp at every fibre of his consciousness and pull himself into the present enough to hear what it was.
Ron frowned, his mouth opening to speak before he paused, as if thinking better of it. After a long moment of awkward silence, he drew in a long breath and spoke, his voice a little more gentle this time.
Hermione’s voice rang out, strangely muted, like she was in another room of the house, an echo. She grabbed at the other Alpha’s hand, only for him to shake her off and grasp her wrist tightly to hold her away.
Pretty, just like his
Draco smiled down at him, scratching behind Rubeus’ floppy ears just the way he liked it.
She looked….
It had been strangely easier to pretend that everything was ok at the start, as if the more that time passed, the further the dark had seeped into the cracks of his soul.
A slight flush travelled up his collar as he looked between the Beta and the Alpha, Hermione innocently focussing on her own food, a hidden smile playing on her lips. Draco dropped his own eyes to his plate again, Ron clearing his throat as the three continued to eat, the scraping of knives and forks across porcelain plates.
He finally asked, trying to slow himself down from scoffing the entire plate. He had barely eaten a thing in ages and now his stomach was fighting with his mind about how much he could actually get down in one sitting.
“Delicious, isn’t it?”
Harry ripped himself away from his thoughts with a frustrated growl, a satisfied little rumble rising in his throat when he saw the boy flinch.
He heard Hermione say before a deeper voice rumbled in reply.
(See the end of the chapter for
A mating bond had been formed.
Ron seemed to wait a bit, blue eyes still scanning over Draco’s face, waiting for him to say something more. When he didn’t, Ron continued, dragging a tired hand through red hair.
Harry never said another word,
Draco blinked slowly into the darkness as his tears dried on his cheeks. He reached a numb hand up to wipe them away.
Borsk asked, his tone now strangely kind for the first time since their meeting.

Love youuuu ♥️
The whole room filled with the obscene sounds of flesh slapping against flesh, Harry’s grunting matching the Omega’s own pleasure-soaked cries.
Draco went rigid, slowly pulling himself away from the Alpha with a frown, his arms holding the towel tighter to his body.
Draco ground out, a deep chill licking up his back as a soft breeze touched his wet skin.
Hermione started, raising a hand swiftly before Draco could celebrate.
“Must you make this harder than it already is?”
, of course.
“No, thank you.”
“You went too far this time, Draco, you pushed too much. We don’t have the influence we had before the war. Do you know how many strings your father had to pull just to keep you out of Azkaban? Do you know how many favours we had to call in? You cast an unforgivable curse on your tutor, Draco, an

Hermione explained with a grin, tucking a strand of wild hair behind her ears.

a little voice inside of him whispered.
Harry smirked, his eyes holding the Omega’s incensed gaze for a heated moment before he pivoted the boy’s wand in his hands and snapped it right in half.
… had
“Yes… and I like, ah, potions.”
Borsk’s voice broke through Draco’s muddled thoughts, the brashness of it yanking him to the forefront of his mind. Draco looked down to where the healer’s eyes were, his own eyes widening in shock when he saw an amber light emerging from his belly.
Ron didn’t know what to do, in every version of this conversation he had run through in his head to prepare— none of them had gone like
“Hand me the eggs, will ya?”
”Mhm, I’m ok. Just… rest.”
“It was my belief that
“It’s just pasta, no experimenting tonight, promise.”
Harry scoffed, holding himself back from stepping towards the boy, not even sure where that odd impulse had come from.
“I’m sorry…”
“I’m not hungry. Sorry. Goodnight.”
“Alright lad, I need you to answer some questions while the potion takes effect, then we can see what we’re dealing with here.”
Green.
Harry released him from the spell before he muttered another one that had Draco dumped unceremoniously back into his chair and in front of his plate.
Hermione stopped him with a smile, shaking her head quickly.
And reality crashed in.
Well, the
“What do you want?!”
Anyway, I hope you enjoy! ❤️
”Shit!”
He felt light.
That didn’t buy him more than a wasted second though and the alpha was quick to pull his flailing body back, fingers winding around Draco’s throat once more.
in that moment, so entirely devoid of a way out… just like that night with Harry, just like… the time with his Alpha tutor.
“He’s all fucking over you!”
Hermione’s anxiety either.
Harry looked down at the boy with a lingering smirk, his eyes straying for a moment on the Omega’s naked back, porcelain skin stretched taut over his ribcage as he sucked in a muffled whimper.
makes it legal to fuck an omega after their first heat–
“Hard on whom, mother? I’m the one being shipped off to some fucking half-bloods farm while you and father make merry with the rest of bloody London!”
Ron sighed, his steps faltering for a moment before he cleared his throat and moved forward again.
“Would you feel better if we rehearsed it a bit? Make it a little less scary when it comes to telling him the good news?”
“Draco.”
He heard Draco’s soft footsteps coming down the stairs and he straightened his back before turning to meet him.
. Very expensive, this one, isn’t it? Though, I suppose, money is of no consequence when daddy’s got the bill.”
Just as he had stumbled into the lounge-room, a large hand grasped the back of his sequinned shirt and yanked him back, tearing the expensive material as he was flung hard onto his ass.
of him. Every night. And it was driving him bloody bonkers.
the sound of his claws scratching softly at his door almost giving Draco a heart attack at the time.
Harry scowled, winning a fiery glare from the boy.
Draco nodded his head, turning on the spot quickly when he felt a blush travel up his throat.
He manoeuvred them around so that they were spooning once again and sighed almost contently. Almost.
Ironic, indeed.
Draco snarled, the words coming out half chocked as he finally managed to pull himself up from the ground, wavering on the spot and holding the wall for balance.
Even Lucius’s temper had been one born of ice... how strange then, that they had created a child of fire.
He felt so overwhelmingly
“Are you going to calm down?”
Someone was coming into his room, someone whose scent sent a fresh wave of panic roaring through his body.
He murmured, reaching his fingers out to graze softly across Harry’s cheek... Harry could barely feel it, yet somehow the heat of the boy’s body infiltrated every single cell in his body, calling out to him in a cruel and crippling song.
. He clenched unconsciously, waiting for that familiar bite of pain, but there was nothing.
Harry quickly finished cooking the last of the pancake batter—
The Alpha lined himself up again before he finally pushed forward into welcoming heat, the head of his cock stretching the tight ring of muscles impossibly wide with a single powerful thrust.
An explosion of flavour burst in his mouth as he chewed, assaulting his senses so wonderfully that he groaned out loud. He let slip a smile, quickly shovelling in another mouthful, groaning again at the taste.
“You must be talking about the fact that you left me here
He was hyperventilating now, sucking in half-chocked sobs as he clutched at his throat and looked at Ron in panic.
, it’s been put on hold. You have no wish for a bond, so this gives you some time to work on your studies, and perhaps, even find a suitable career.”
Ron’s head snapped up, his body leaning forward a little as if he wanted to walk over to Draco.
Draco asked cautiously, tasting blood on his tongue.
He looked like a living, breathing embodiment of
“He wasn’t attacking you or anything, kid, he just likes people.”
She started, holding up a hand when she saw him ready to snap back at her.
Maybe it wasn’t going to be so bad here after all?
like this? Never.
“I’m not a dog.”
Draco whispered in shock, his shaking hands now covered in it.
The beast seemed to know just when he was needed too, whining at his door in the middle of the night sometimes when Draco awoke from one of his nightmares.
A quick update only because this chapter was already mostly done. I’ve got a lot of ongoing projects but I do try to keep everything updated as much as I can 🥺
Draco muttered under his breath as he got up out of his chair and turned to leave, the sound of Ron’s voice behind him making him pause.
Draco called over his shoulder, his steps only faltering when Harry started to follow him. The boy turned back with a huff, a rising irritation finally flickering past his gaze.
He had only been out for a few hours so he still had a while before the potion would wear off. Enough time to get changed into something a little warmer, pack a go-bag and hide out at Pansy’s for a few days.
Hermione finally answered, wringing her hands together as an awkward silence followed. She finally continued on when she realised Draco wasn’t going to say anything.
, washing away the stain of slick.

He trailed off and when minutes passed and he didn’t continue, Hermione spoke instead.
Draco muttered, hiking up his towel a little more as the chill started to travel up his neck.
of him.”
He didn’t look at her as he said it and he didn’t wait until she replied, just moved quickly to his room before shutting the door behind him and collapsing on the floor.
Narcissa continued, one hand moving up to brush through his snow-fallen hair, kissing the top of his head before she spoke.
now. Remind me again what yesterday’s important lesson was? Oh, yes,
”Little—“
“Mm, that’s still there… I haven’t yet figured out how to fix that but I-“
Draco asked, the curiosity suddenly burning in his mind. This Alpha… this witch, was nothing like the people who had made up his world before this. There was nothing cold, nothing distant, nothing greasy about her at all… just warmth.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione said, bowing her head quickly as she sniffled miserably.
Oh, Merlin.
, better than good, better than amazing. It was like a heavy weight he hadn’t even know had been holding him down, suddenly lifted… and he was floating.
It had worried them, Hermione and Ron, seeing Draco’s pale face after he had finished with the healer, the eery silence of his blank eyes and shaking hands…
Draco murmured, shakey hands clasping firmly over his knife and fork before he looked up at the Alpha.
very moment, he was taking comfort from
Draco moaned, a shudder running up his spine as the scent of the man on top of him enveloped him like a dream.
The toast popped then, and the alpha moved quickly to grab each steaming slice, throwing them on the plates before he magicked the butter to spread itself so that he could serve up the rest of the food.
Hermione’s freighted voice rang out, instantly making him turn quickly on the spot and flick his gaze over his trousers.
“I’m honestly fine, thank you though.”
His body shuddered under the weight of it.
“Of course, dear, you’ve had a big day. I’ve sent your bag to your room and there’s a towel on your bed if you want to take a shower. Let us know if you need anything at all.”
“I have everything I need for that. I’m teaching him advanced potion making, I wouldn’t have the need for anything of yours— even so, I haven't done anything practical with him whilst he’s been on bed rest. Is something wrong, Ron? Why are you so worried?”
Draco scoffed, crossing his arms petulantly.
When Draco made it to the kitchen, a small smile played at his lips, his eyes scanning over the mess of groceries splayed across the floor before Ron muttered to himself, wand in hand, and magicked everything back in place.
Harry started, only for Draco to cut him off again.
Draco answered in reply, his head nodding readily as he spared a glance to Ron. The Beta met the boy’s eyes before drifting back to his own plate, clearing his throat before he spoke.
“Anyway, I’ve talked your ear off, haven’t I? I’ll leave you now to get settled, I know this must all be so new and frightening, being away from home and all-“
He was raised inside the dreary walls, tutors thrown at him left and right, his own parents ignoring his questions as to why they were so scared. He knew about the war, knew their position had been on the wrong side, but all the other details were…
Ron had made Draco follow him around the whole damn property, showing him the wheat fields and rolling emerald hills before he toured them both around a small heard of noisy sheep and smelly goats.
He slowly made his way to the chickens, checking their water trough and feeder before he threw in the food scraps. He left the bin there to collect on his way back and started the long hike to the stables.
“Yes.”
”I can’t tell you how scared I was, Draco, how scared we both were.”
He sobbed, feeling Harry’s movements speed up, hips snapping viciously against him in a song of sweat and sex.
Hermione exclaimed with a sudden grin, her hands coming up to rest on her hips.
He just didn’t know what to make of it, didn’t know why the kid would even want to do what he was doing… maybe he was homesick? Maybe he was doing it for attention, or some kind of cry for help?
“You’re h-hurting me…”
exceptions,
“We just weren’t expecting you, that’s all, you could have sent an owl.”
Ron asked slowly, his eyes flicking over Draco quickly as if trying to gauge his reaction.
The man asked slowly, a strange lilt to his voice that Draco hadn’t the energy or the focus to decipher.
Alpha.
She said happily, a zing in her step as she opened the door and left him with one last wide smile... then she was gone.
, this wasn’t going to be as easy as he had once thought…
That was it,
Those eyes were staring at him now, slightly narrowed yet unapologetically curious. The corner of the boy’s plump lips quirked up as Harry continued to stare, the tip of his tongue grazing across the seam of his lips, caught suddenly when he trapped it under the point of a canine.
sick.
, Ron, of course I insisted, but he was quite adamant that he didn’t want one. I can’t exactly force him to take it, can I?”
Draco spoke again.
Draco asked suddenly, biting his lip when he saw the way Ron’s spine straightened at the question.
He barked, eyes running down Draco’s form and making him flinch.
“You have a test on Monday, Draco, so yes, I expect my
Ron asked, and Draco’s stomach dropped. He
Hermione started, her worried voice pulling him out of the hole he was crawling through, her hand on his.
As if he could.
“We can’t stay? I just think Draco would like it better if–“
“Right, that same law that
He whispered out into the void, the tightening of his throat twisting it into a cross between a word and a sound.
scent, the sugary sweet smell of the Omega now tainted by the ugly odour of fear.
imperfect hair.
The night continued on easily after that, a strange warmness nestling around the trio as they ate, casual conversation commencing shortly after. The uneasy tension between Ron and Draco had mostly dissipated, much to the boy’s relief, his heart now beating at a steady pace for the first time that night.
Draco sat up, cautiously sniffing the air as she sat down, the Alpha placing one of the cups in front of him before taking a small sip of her own.
Ron said lowly, his eyes never leaving the bowl as he whisked in the eggs. Draco’s spine stiffened, sucking in a quiet breath as he regarded Ron’s rigid movements.
“… it is important to keep the Alpha close during this time… do you understand?”
“Oh, isn’t that cute? You actually think he cares for you.”
Let me know if you have ideas or things you want to see! I can’t promise anything but I’m always open to them 😘♥️♥️
Ron asked suddenly, shaking Draco from his darkening thoughts.
His pants were pulled down swiftly, hot skin greeting the chilly morning air, Harry’s fingers soft and insistent as they ran down the curve of a cheek and started to spread him open.
Footsteps.
“We’re old and boring these days, Draco, so we usually spend the end of the night with a book by the fire. Feel free to have a look at the bookshelves, dear, our Rose was a big reader too so there should be a few things for younger eyes. Or… you can verse Ron at wizard’s chess, he’s surprisingly good at it. Aren’t you, darling?”
Draco said slowly, quickly stifling a yawn.
Harry done fucked up 🙃 I don’t feel as bad about the whole
“You’re trying to kill me with food.”
Draco snipped, the edge in his voice all but swallowed by an artless moan that escaped from his lips when Harry’s other hand rubbed circles across his back.
Every time the
That wasn’t
“You’re so touchy today.”
Draco smirked, almost sighing in relief when the heavy atmosphere lifted and Ron’s serious expression morphed into something a little more familiar.
Draco said, his tone still oddly cheery— only now laden with an edge, like a blade hidden behind every word. He continued on, stabbing another piece of pancake, the sound of the fork scratching across the plate making Harry’s jaw clench.
“You can ask my mother to throw in a bonus for your trouble, tell her you had to rough me up a little, she’ll like that.”
A deep voice rumbled beside him, making Draco jump, his eyes going wide as the realisation hit him.
Draco cut her off, gritting his teeth as he avoided her eyes.
When he made it to the stables, he greeted the horses with a small smile. He didn’t know why the beasts had scared him so much at the start… now, they had become somewhat of a comfort these last few weeks.
. Hermione wasn’t lying, the guy could cook.
whip up a selection of food to drop off at the boy’s door, feeling a little less worried when he passed by Draco’s room an hour later to find the tray empty.
(See the end of the chapter for
… he also didn’t miss the fact that that word had sounded so nice on his lips.
. If he could just keep it together long enough to finish school and find some place that would take him on as an apprentice, maybe he could set himself up a little life of his own. Maybe save enough money to buy a little cottage in the country, like Hermione and Ron, perhaps get himself a few chickens, fill the place with honeysuckle and light.
“Draco?”
She whispered, leaning into him with a sigh.
, his mouth formed into a grim line, emerald eyes set ablaze in a slow-burning rage.
Sometimes when Hermione gave him one of those searching looks, he was so painfully tempted to spill his guts, to tell her everything that had happened… so that she could fix this.
“Oh… hey.”
She asked, the latter part of the question said in a quiet discomfort. She already knew his answer, just as he did… only, as soon as the word ‘
Harry’s fingers suddenly grasped his hair, twisting his head to the front and rolling Draco’s body over so that he was once again on his back.
“Draco… please don’t look at me like that. This might be good for you! It’s only for a year, my darling, you can make some friends, finish your studies… it will be alright, I promise.”
“He hates my father?”
No more holes, so, at least that could be checked off the list.
“Are you awake, dear? Can I come in?”
“Last night… hm.”
”Hermione?”
It was interesting, really, to see the way her unguarded scent changed with her mood, uniquely new and strangely familiar. Another thing he would just have to get used to.
“Well, how lucky am I? To be left in such
Draco looked up at him again, eyes wide and red-rimmed.
Draco grumbled, annoyed when Hermione cupped his cheek and pecked him on the forehead as if he were a child.
At one point, Hermione had knocked softly on his door, asking if he was ok, but he ignored it, wondering if enough time had passed for it to be believable that he was asleep already. Probably not, it didn’t matter anyway, she walked away after she was greeted only by his silence, her soft steps padding back down the hall.
Anyway! I just finished my last exchange and I might try to hold off on signing up to anymore until I update at least a few of my WIPs— including this one ♥️
“Oh, lighten up, handsome, I just want to brighten up the place a little.”
The healer came shortly after that, stepping from the emerald flames with a sour look on his face. He regarded the quiet Omega, eyes scanning over his pale face.
The Omega let out a distressed whine that stabbed through the fog in Harry’s mind, but it didn’t stop him,
How could his parents do this to him? How could they have sent him off to this place… with
“You’ve been asleep all day, dear, I didn't want to wake you but Ron insisted that you needed to eat something… Are you hungry?”
“Nice wand. Hawthorn wood, right? Ah, and with a unicorn hair core… how
Harry barked, only for Draco to double his efforts.
’ started to curl his tongue, the smell of the dish she had brought in drifted over to him, winning an uncomfortable growl from his empty stomach.
”They have a lesser-known effect of… they can— it h-helps to—“
“Why do you do that every time, you silly mutt?”
“How terribly predictable.”
The last of Harry’s stumble words cut off as a sharp pain radiated up his stomach, causing a strangled groan to escape his lips.
Draco grinned, propping his hand on his waist and eyeing the newly fixed walls some more. Harry studied him for a brief moment before he finally spoke.
“Ah, excellent! I was a wiz at potions when I was at Hogwarts.”
“Oh, honey, please don’t say that, you’re perfect the way you are, you hear me? Just perfect.”
“Oh, Draco, you don’t know how good it is to hear that.”
She chuckled, smoothing down his wet hair with a motherly smile.
“No fussing now, this is just to see where the problem is.”
She had noticed how he reacted to it now, so different to what he was like at the start.
Draco drawled as he padded into the kitchen, his lips stretching in a yawn before he pulled out a chair and sat down, sleepy eyes watching the alpha in his kitchen.
Ron’s frown made the Omega swallow, and it was a good long moment before he spoke again.
He was a fiery little one. That was something the boy hadn’t gotten from his father or his mother.
“I’ll indulge you on this, Draco, because I can’t see the harm in doing a little hard labour, but I can tell you now that we are
“You’re temperate is still down, that’s good… how are you feeling, dear?”
Harryyyy. No 😞🤚
Through the walking nightmare that had been that night, the one thing that truly haunted him, out of everything else… was the way that that man had comforted him. He could feel it now, the ghost of a touch on his back, gently stroking him, urging him to breathe.
should learn some manners, Mr Potter, it’s not very cordial to offer a gift only to take it back again.”
He gasped innocently, resting his chin on his hand and smiling up at Harry.
Hermione started, smiling at Draco in encouragement when he shuffled on the spot awkwardly, not knowing whether she was actually genuinely interested or if she was just trying to make conversation.
He was right, fuck he was—
Draco scraped his leftover eggs into the scrap bin before he grabbed it and walked to the door.
Harry snarled, teeth sinking into the tender flesh of the Omega’s shoulder, the pain of it melding with the bliss still wracking his body.
Before he could even ask, Borsk’s fingers were probing his stomach, only pulling away to grab his wand and mutter a whispered spell under his breath. The amber light twisted then, curling into a pretty spiral and Draco sucked in a quiet breath as he watched it dance in front of him, almost mesmerised in the glowing light that was bore from his own belly.
brat throw at him that he hadn’t already dealt with a million times before?
He scowled, the earlier heat in his voice from before simmering to a low flame, his body moving down Draco’s form until he was just above his crotch.
Draco sighed when he finally made it to his room, noticing his bag set up on the dresser and a fluffy towel on the bed as promised. He opened his case, not bothering to unpack for the night, just rummaging around until he found his pyjamas.
The voice chuckled, as the sound of a happy whine and a thumping tail joined the mix. Draco let slip a scowl, even now he hated the beast, always following him around the farm and drooling on his pant leg. He wasn’t annoyingly adorable at all. Not in the
He sniffled into the dark as he made to move, moaning at the burning tug at his entrance that refused to let him go.
He scowled, dropping his fork so that it clattered across his plate before he crossed his arms over his chest. Harry watched him for a long moment, waiting for Draco’s breathing to calm before he spoke.
There was some part of him, some tiny seed of doubt that had hoped it was all just a big misunderstanding… that Draco would tell him he was being a paranoid old geezer and to mind his own business.
Draco spat out, shoving in another mouthful as he glared at Harry. He only chewed it twice before he started speaking again, his words half muffled between each bite.
You’re amazing!!!
The Alpha growled lowly as the scent of it lingered in his nostrils, interrupting the smell of his mate resting in his arms… only…
“It’s good to hear you laugh, kid, you should do it more often.”
you let me come here? Was it money? Did my parents offer you something in exchange?”
“Great, you’re done with the walls. I’m going to start on the painting, I picked up this really lovely colour a while ago.
Draco stepped forward slowly, like a lion on the prowl, that same smile twisting his lips.
“Yeah… I guess I probably deserve that.”
“No muggle training tonight?”
She said with a smile, her hand dropping to cup his cheek gently before she let go.
His sheets were soaked in his own slick... and that realisation just made his stomach roll.
He would do it tonight, whether he liked it or not…
“Have you been using any of my ingredients from the pantry?”
Thank you so much for reading! I hope you liked the chapter xx
Draco tried to pull his face away but that only made Harry's grip tighten. They stared each other down for a heated moment, neither of them giving in until finally, Draco let slip a soft chuckle, a flicker of amusement settling in his gaze.
, not when his whole body had been enveloped by a thick and swirling storm of pheromones.
“See yourself out, Mr Potter, I’ll look the other way if you change your mind about that china–“
“Potter?”
Not that Harry had needed to capture him so, not when Draco’s entire body went lax as soon as their bodies had entwined, his head immediately tilting and exposing the pale curve of his neck.
Draco yelled, cutting off Ron before suddenly bursting into tears.
a challenge.”
people… when they didn’t even know the truth? He was going to have to keep up this charade, all the while knowing that this woman’s kindness was at the result of a lie.
mind… he had dreamt of that voice enough, had laid awake in his bed as it whispered around him like a ghost.
Harry teased, ruffling her hair the way he used to do where they were kids, earning a hard-won scowl from the witch.
“Oh, yes, it’s very impressive.”
It was only then that Harry could feel it through the post-mating bliss that had wrapped around him only moments before.
Hermione gave him a sympathetic look before she reached out, gently taking his free hand in hers.
Borsk gave him a look, clearing his throat before he dropped a hand on Draco’s knee. It was only then that Draco realised he had been shaking, his body cold, skin clammy.
Harry growled in his ear, the sound of it rumbling through his chest and vibrating through Draco’s skin.
Draco broke down, the last of his strength leaving him as he crumpled to the ground. It took him a long while to realise that he was being held, whispered words spoken into the wind as a hand stroked slowly over his hair.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco muttered, pushing himself up from his chair before he could see Hermione’s expression, before she could say anything more.
Draco grumbled, catching Ron’s smirk.
… feel the mess between his legs. One of his hands reached down before he could stop it, his fingers grazing across something wet.
“Fine—“
Draco seemed to stiffen under him for a brief second before he was struggling again, letting out a frustrated growl when his efforts proved fruitless.
Before Draco could say anything more, there was a sudden knock at the door, a loud tapping that made the boy jump, before a grin stretched impossibly wide over his nauseatingly pretty face.
, something startlingly sour.
“Good morning, sleepyhead!”
Draco shook his head quickly, his red eyes wide and wild.
Draco whispered, trying to duck his head away to hide his expression as he stood up and started stacking the empty plates— only to freeze when suddenly there was a gasp, a panicked and shrill sound that had Draco yanking his hands away from the plates.
“I’m pregnant.”
CLIFFHANGER 🙈 I’M SORRY
(See the end of the chapter for
“Prickly little thing, aren’t you? Must be the Malfoy genes.”
Draco steadied himself, taking a deep breath before puffing out his chest and raising his chin. He was nothing if he wasn’t a Malfoy.
Draco’s mouth dropped, shooting up in his chair.
. He just had to get used to it, he told himself.
“And don’t you even think for one second that you’re a burden. I’m getting paid handsomely to be your new tutor, and with my daughter gone, you’re helping a poor mother with her empty-nest-syndrome.”
It was odd, Harry had spelled away his scent before he left that morning, yet Draco could swear he still smelt it. It lingered in the air like a bad dream, filling his lungs and infecting every cell until he felt like he could no longer breathe.
The Alpha was their friend, their
He wouldn’t lie… today had felt
Draco cut him off hastily, a grin tugging at his lips before he could even stop himself.
He could feel the heat of his ass, the muted sting of phantom handprints hot against his smarting cheeks.
He yelped when rough hands yanked him from the floor, Harry’s heavy body lifting off him for a beat only to drag him belly-first over the his hard thighs.
Harry pulled his plate away sharply, shooting him a warning glance.
“Hello, Draco. It’s nice to meet you…
“Harry…”
At least, that’s what he kept telling himself.
“Not much of a morning person, are you?”
The naughty corner thing is thanks to an unhealthy amount of ‘Supernanny’ 😌
Harry staggered back into the… fuck, so
She bemoaned, her voice wavering as her hands came down to smooth at the fabric of her gown, the golden silk cooperating with her movements and shining uninhibited under the dull light of the room.
Draco gave him a look, a strange flash of something crossing his features that Harry couldn’t catch, only for it to be replaced by a slow smile.
“What? Now? He’s not even finished with dinner, Ron, can’t it wait?”
To live here freely, on your own, without your mother's input?”
It was like Harry and him were... oh,
His head was spinning, pins and needles spreading out over the expanse of his body, wherever they touched and lighting up like an unhinged blaze, burning through him until he was nothing but a wisp in the breeze.
, recklessly so, and if Harry didn’t nip that in the bud right at the start, it was going to take a lot longer than a few months before Harry was out of this shithole… and
Thank you so much for reading and leaving comments and kudos! I’m honestly so honoured xxx you’re amazing ♥️♥️♥️
Harry asked carefully, guiding her over to the couch and seating them both.
When she pulled him down a long and winding hall that lead to a small bedroom, Draco could finally breathe, the Alpha witch’s scent no longer seeming so distasteful now that it wasn’t tangled with her mate’s.
“Oh, honey, I just, I’m so sorry! Merlin, I don’t know what got into him, he’s normally not so… I’ve sent him away, and for what it’s worth, he’s very very sorry, he didn’t even know who you were, he-“
His thoughts were interrupted by a sharp tap at his window and he spun around to find a fluffy white owl with a brown speckled nape waiting for him.
“Do you want me to break your wrists, you little idiot?”
“Stay with me…”
Also, if you’re interested in a dark omegaverse Drarry—
The healer cut Hermione off with an irritated grunt, only bothering to make a flicking motion with his hand in a sign that he wanted them out.
Blaise groaned, an easy grin stretching across his lips before he finally stepped back, leaning instead against the side of the house.
Harry’s words died in his throat when Draco finally turned towards him, his face a mess of tears, eyes red-rimmed and glassy. He tried to stand but his legs buckled under him.
Harry chuckled, an edge hidden behind the warning. When it breached him, Draco let out a breathy moan, burying his head in Harry’s shoulder, shuddering into his arms.
Harry snarled, his breath hot against Draco’s flesh when he finally pulled back to glare at him. A flush rose up Draco’s neck, heating his cheeks as he scowled up at Harry’s looming face, finally starting to struggle again in his hold.
Draco sat up, his eyebrows raising as he looked down at his belly, a hand curling over it in disbelief.
Hermione would then come back with some other childhood memory of the three in school, and Ron would chuckle and mention a name of someone Draco wouldn’t know… and then they would
Mr. Potter…
, I need it!”
“Yes, please—
. Oh, Merlin.
Draco groaned into his hands, slumping forward as he willed himself not to cry. He was so damn sick of crying.
The Alpha stilled when he heard a muffled whimper, only for the sound to be drowned out by a series of sharp breaths. It took Harry a moment to realise that the sounds the boy was making actually resembled words, and another moment after that before he could decipher them.
Ron nodded his head, his heart still clenching at the sight of the boy crying so morosely.
It wasn’t until he was on his third shot of fire-whiskey that a sudden surge of panic ran through his body... his face turning a shade of sickly white.
“I’m here to tell you what to do, and you’re here to listen.
Draco finally replied, sneaking another glance to the Beta. There was a ghost of a smile tugging up his lips now and he suddenly leaned closer to Draco, almost conspiratorially. Draco leaned forward a fraction too, holding his breath to escape the harsh proximity of Ron’s scent.
“I’m sorry, s-sorry, please.”
All sense of reason evaporated into the honeyed air as instinct coursed through his veins, reaching every cell, capturing every fibre of his being.
Hermione asked, biting her lip as she glanced over Draco’s slumped form. He shook his head, twirling his fork around his plate before he finally sucked in a breath and pushed the plate away from him.
. Before he even knew it, he was back in the corner again, face to the wall with his mouth shut and his body frozen into position.
“Draco? Is everything…”
Draco swore under his breath, thankful that he was far enough away from the house that neither Ron nor Hermione could see him. That would have been just another reason for them to ask him to see a doctor.
Draco asked tersely, his lips forming a thin line as he crossed his arms over his chest, glaring at him. Ron breathed in slowly and sighed, adding a splash of vanilla essence before he finally looked at him.
He never thought that in this place he could feel so alone… and yet he did, more than ever before.
Draco didn’t move,
Ron grinned, slinging his arm around the younger Omega’s shoulders as he responded with an embarrassed smile.
He asked, hard eyes holding Draco’s gaze, watching him almost curiously when he shook his head.
In his book, that was a win.
“Harry… you know that’s not what I meant, I was just saying that we weren’t expecting you, and we have a visitor-“
He had no idea, and the thought of having to sit Draco down and ask him why…
Draco bit out, ignoring the strange flutter of his heart as the alpha continued to stare him down.
… did he? He couldn’t have, even now Draco kept his scent securely guarded, it was all but second nature to him. Hermione had even had a talk with him about it, telling him that he could feel comfortable enough to release his scent if he wanted… but that just felt
Harry asked with a sigh, clearly unimpressed. Draco rolled his eyes, popping everything down on the floor beside his feet before he glanced up at the wall with a raised eyebrow.
“You expect me to keep my hands to myself when you come to me dressed like
He missed his mother, and, surprisingly… he missed his father too. It was nice here, he felt
Draco had only managed to make it halfway across the room before Harry was on him again, slamming his slender body hard against the closest wall, the Alpha’s large form curling around him as he pressed his face next to the Omega’s ear, blood already smudging across the pale skin.
“No–“
“C’mon, let me introduce you to my mate and then I’ll show you to your room.”
“Didn’t want one? Can’t you tell him you insist? The kid’s probably just worried about making a fuss, that’s all.”
Through his still open bedroom door, Draco heard the tell-tale signs of Ron arriving home, the somewhat muted chatter of Hermione becoming clearer as they moved from the loungeroom and into the kitchen.
“Ah, well, I think that’s a story for another day, dear. Let’s just get you settled for now. Feel free to make yourself comfortable, you can take a nap if you like and I’ll call you when dinner is ready. Ron’s cooking tonight, and he’s surprisingly brilliant at it.”
“No!”
was his favourite part, a brief and parting moment that left him feeling something other than this swirling mix of numb and pain.
Hermione replied, the worry clear in her voice.
“Is Hermione teaching you wandless magic?”
It was his eyes though that caught his breath. Two large orbs, the colour of an ocean storm, framed by long pale lashes that should have given him more than a whisper of innocence… and yet, left him with anything
Draco said absently, jolting when he felt Ron slap him on the back affectionately.
Harry leant forward, the scruff of his stubbled cheek brushing across the soft flesh of Draco’s neck, making the omega suck in a strained breath around the ever-tightening hand.
Flashes of that night ran through his mind…
Draco thought, as he continued to shovel in the rest of his food, the scent of chocolate and oranges drifting sweetly through the air...
The Omega whimpered under the assault, his body already surrendering to the Alpha as he pushed back onto the hot tongue, moaning and writhing as it fucked his hole.
Harry stepped back from the wall, eyeing his work as he stuffed his wand back into his pocket.
Ron was quick to react, shouting something about getting a healer, but Draco didn’t hear the rest, not when the world around him suddenly fell to a quiet whisper, his ears thrumming in a constant buzz as he stared at his bloody fingers.
“You’re on spud duty.”
. He wasn’t going there. Not when he was feeling this good for the first time in a long while.
“It was Hermione’s parent's farm, well, her grandfather’s originally. When he passed, it was given to her father and mother, but… due to, uh, certain events, it’s in Hermione’s hands now.”
“You use bug-wheat? Have you tried adding dandelion root with it? It goes really well with bug-wheat.”
It was like he couldn’t get close enough to him, that— even joined like this... it still wasn’t enough.
(mind the tags 👀)
Ron replied, the sound of cupboards opening and things being put away. Draco grimaced, ducking his head to rest on Rubeus’s back. He had forgotten about tonight, forgotten his promise to work on the dessert. It felt like so long ago that they had even had that conversation.
He had only been here for two months now, but even that had gone too fast. He knew that eventually, two months would turn into three, then four, and before he knew it, his year would be finished and he would leave this place forever.
After last night’s
Harry surged forward after the retreating omega, a heavy hand wrapping tightly around the boy’s delicate wrist and yanking him back, almost pulling him off balance as he flung him around and pressed him tight up against the nearby wall.
Draco sang, blowing a kiss in a quick farewell before he skipped out of the room, swinging his hips as he did, his ass swaying just so inline of Harry’s vision.
Harry Potter.
Ron was making him dessert, and it
Of what had been done.
He was pathetic, and if
”I took them, I t-took the ingredients to make… t-to make a potion.”
He felt…
”Oh… ok.”
a but, I want you to spend an hour and no less going over your charms tomorrow.”
Harry bit out, grinding his cock against Draco’s ass as if to punctuate his point. Draco stilled, the words hitting him like a punch in the gut, a half strangled choking sound slipping past his lips before he could stop it.
“Uh, y-yes, come in.”
. Why did he have to say that?
Draco murmured quickly, still not sure how he was supposed to respond. Ron didn’t seem to notice his disquiet, too wrapped up in the topic at hand.
“Sorry, just, I’m
Draco nodded absently at that, picking an invisible thread from the cooling pad.
“If you say so.”
. He couldn’t really put his finger on what exactly about the evening had niggled something deep and warm inside of him, but it felt good.
She asked, nibbling her bottom lip when he paused.
The question caught Draco like a punch in the stomach but he shook his head quickly, ignoring the way his bond mark on the nape of his neck
Draco sighed wearily as he pushed around his scrambled eggs, not missing the look that passed between Hermione and Ron.
Draco flinched, his body humming where Ron touched him.
Harry muttered, and before Draco could even guess what he was referring to, the alpha’s wand was out, a spell leaving Harry’s lips seconds before Draco’s body was propelled into the corner of the room by an invisible force, plopped down on his ass with his eyes to the wall.
“To tutor you, yes, but you’re going to be a part of our family during your stay here, Draco, and everyone has to pitch in, which includes
“I’m just feeling a bit under the weather.”
… but he assumed it had something to do with the way Ron and Hermione laughed.
, good morning, Draco.”
my name.”
he refused to name...
Draco’s scream vibrated against the floorboards that his face had been pushed into, his body jerking as his Alpha lapped at the wound, a bitter-sweet tang of blood flooding into Harry’s mouth.
for one had been a bit of a curveball…
Draco scowled, rolling his eyes and turning away from Ron as he tried to save his hair, hiding the flush that ran up his neck.
“Thanks.”
Harry started, only to pause when he saw a paint can and a set of brushes in the boy’s arms. Draco held up his hands in show, grinning at the alpha with a wink.
Harry cleared his throat, ignoring the itch to move back. That would be an easy victory for the lad and he could already tell that he was going to be a handful.
Harry finally said, choosing his words carefully as he watched the young man’s expression change from curiosity to boredom. Draco turned on his heel with a dismissive flick of his hand and made to disappear out of the room.
Draco asked uneasily, eyeing the creature who was still sitting in the corner of the room, his big head lolling to the side in question when Draco looked to him.
He murmured, neither hand stopping as Draco relaxed into him a little more.
The Alpha slung an arm around the boy’s waist, chest against back, each laboured breath mirrored by the other.
Hermione smirked, standing up to grab both their plates before carrying them into the kitchen. She was gone for a few minutes but when she came back, she had two steaming mugs in her hands, a cooling scent of peppermint drifting towards him, mixing almost pleasantly with her scent.
Harry tried to speak, but again his words fell flat on a frozen tongue.
“You’ve called me
It was going to be a long year.
“I’m Healer Borsk, what’s the lad’s name?”
His gut twisted painfully at the sight of the pale-haired boy huddled in the corner of the room, still frozen in his spell.
”Rest up, dear, I’ll come to check on you in an hour, ok?”
His knot formed too quickly, the fat girth of it catching on the Omega’s well-stretched rim a few times before he finally had to force it back in with one last vicious thrust, burying the knot as deep as it would go before he came into the boy, marking him with his seed.
Draco purred, inching closer as he tilted his head back and scented the air, the delicate curve of his pale neck catching Harry’s eyes for a moment before the boy’s words finally sunk in.
“If you can work hard and prove to him that you can do more than just cause trouble, he’ll leave it for a few years. Just make him proud, darling, and everything will fall into place. I promise.”
“I… uh, yeah, thank you.”
The sound of Harry’s knife and fork scraping against his plate was torturous, and Draco groaned at the back of his throat.
“I… um, better, actually.”
allow him to show his face in wizarding society for the rest of his life if he knew the truth.
Draco let out a long breath as he walked through the door, shutting it behind him with a click and propelling himself into the surrounding darkness.
He flinched when he felt Hermione’s hand gently cover his own, her thumb brushing over his knuckle in the way that always made him shiver.
one… but even that had been a walk in the park compared to Lucius.
Harry...
. Everything about him put Draco on edge… and the
Ron said, a strange edge to his voice. Draco frowned but shrugged his shoulders, turning with a quiet exhale and grabbing the plate mid-air to carry it to the sink. He heard a tired sigh from behind him and his body tensed.
“Last time I checked, Malfoy was my name.”
tired.”
… he was in a world of trouble.
They all ate in a happy yet strained silence and by the time Draco had scraped his plate clean his stomach was bursting.
They all eventually seated themselves and dinner was served. Hermione and Ron both flicked glances at Draco throughout the evening to check in with him, but he had answered every one of them with a calm nod, before dropping his eyes back to his food.
…and Draco had been sick… a lot.
“Draco— what, your
Harry asked, trying to keep his tone amenable. He needed Draco to come to terms with their new arrangement as soon as possible, so that he could finish his assignment and get the hell out of here.
“You will.”
situation 🍳🥓
“He’s in town for the weekend and he wanted to know if he could pop in for dinner tonight. Is that something that is going to make you uncomfortable, Draco? Because if it does, even the slightest bit, I need you to tell me, ok?”
The alpha swayed on the spot as another wave of dizzying pain ran straight up his spine, causing him to let out a strained burst of air.
“Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t-“
His mother had come in shortly after that, screaming bloody murder at the vision of the man in the crux of a curse. She never made mention of the fact that the Alpha’s half-hard cock was bobbing about and free from his trousers, or even the fact that Draco was on his knees, eyes wide and face entirely bloodless…
“O-Okay.”
Draco blinked, clutching the blanket closer to his body, the scent of Harry’s piss now all through his sheets.
The healer started, eyeing Draco with a raised eyebrow before he continued.
...and that dream 👀
“I’d like to see how you’d explain that to Ron.”
now, and even with the modern rights Omega’s had in regards to forced bonds… his father would
, I swear. I wouldn’t have let him come over without your approval first, I know that he makes you a little uncomfortable. Anyway, he saw you curled up by the stables and brought you in.”
, but in that moment... he really didn’t give a shit, he could handle it just fine. Stomach be damned!
The witch seemed to relax at that, but the tension was still so thick in the air, stifling all four of them into an uncomfortable silence. Something sharp twisted in Draco’s gut, his head lowering as his cheeks heated in shame.
Draco said, forcing his arms to stay by his side so that he wouldn’t wring them in front of Ron. He was good at this, at pretending, he was a Malfoy.
He pushed himself to the back wall for balance, trying to keep the distaste from his expression, eyeing the worried look from Hermione and the mildly perturbed expression from her partner, Ron.
as he watched the Alpha flail on the ground, like a fish that had been pulled from the sea and left to die on the sand.
Draco whispered, unable to push any real strength into his voice.
. He didn’t tell her that he had a feeling it was all only temporary... he could keep that to himself for now.
Draco gasped, his body weakly trying to drag himself away, only for the Alpha to growl in warning, his teeth still latched to the boy’s shoulder.
, there were just three words whispered in the dark, words that should have brought Harry a fervent satisfaction... only to leave him with anything but.
His parents were both Alphas, as were all of his tutors, but it was custom in Malfoy Manor— as in most esteemed families— to subdue one’s scent. Lucius never stood for anyone carelessly releasing their pheromones, it was, after all, the absolute height of incivility.
Not that he didn’t feel like he was already halfway there.
“You’re
“Thank you, Harry, I’d really like that.”
He started with the bacon first.
Hermione muttered, shooting him a look that made him grimace.
”Ron, he’s only just gotten off bed rest, can this really not wait—“
“Goodnight, Hermione, Ron… Mr, ah, Harr-“
the reaction Draco had wanted.
I’m so sorry about the updates delay! I had my dad visiting and could not find the time to sneak away and write 🤧
“Deep breaths, that’s it, good boy, that’s it…”
A deep voice murmured in front of him, so quiet it could have been a cruel trick of the wind. Or of his
“You can either stay for the last 30 minutes or you can do an hour of revision tomorrow. It’s up to you, dear.”
Hermione started— startled, worried. Draco cut her off, slapping on a small smile.
Yes I may or may not have used a little wand-penis joke. When I was googling Draco and Harry’s wands I saw that Harry’s was supposed to be an extra inch longer then Draco’s. Forgive me, I couldn’t resist 🤧
, now.”
Draco breathed, biting his bottom lip when he felt it quiver under his words. His mother moved quickly, the golden train of her gown trailing across the floor as she pulled him into her arms. He stiffened for a moment before he let himself sag into her embrace, letting slip a muffled sniffle.
“That you’re pregnant, Draco.”
Of course, his father, Lucius, had been the same— he too had been taught from a young age by his own parents to control his scent.
I'm back! :)
It was just so different from how things were at home. Usually, Draco would spend his morning exercising, then came his tutoring from 7 am to 5 pm, and after that, he would help his mother in the garden or work on his potions.
If he told Hermione… the witch would be forced to tell his mother.
He murmured, eyes on Draco’s long legs as the omega made his way up the few steps to the front door, turning back with a smile.
, if you could call an Alpha that. She had a kind smile, at least, but that didn’t really mean much. Anyone could fake a smile.
“Trust a bloody Malfoy to tell us what’s good and proper in wizarding society.”
Ron finally finished with a breath, eyes holding Draco’s gaze until the Omega finally dropped it to the floor, his cheeks heating slightly at the look.
“Yeah, goodnight, Draco.”
“Oh, don’t sound so surprised. I can’t cook as well as Ron, but I can still boil a jug of water and use a microwave.”
He hissed, his lips pressing into a thin line when he saw the way his mother flinched back at his words. He could smell her scent, something she was usually so skilled at hiding, a swirling stench of guilt and melancholy that burned at Draco’s nostrils.
Draco breathed, running his tongue over his teeth as he grinned at Harry.
Draco teased with a smirk, bumping Harry’s shoulder playfully. Harry scowled at him, but took a swig of his glass, nodding at him in thanks. Draco took another small sip of his, eyes staying on Harry for a lingering moment, as if searching for something.
He burst into tears, his hands rushing forward to wipe them away, but they kept coming, flowing like the overwhelming sadness that was coursing through his every nerve.
his shoulders slumping as if he had used all of his energy to say it.
Like his own parents, always so… elusive.
Draco cried out, arching when a calloused hand slid down his hip and curled around the curve of his ass, finger probing at his drenched hole.
“I know, I just thought maybe you needed something for one of your potions… you sure you didn’t borrow anything? Maybe to use for your potion class with Draco?”
He was getting a little more used to it, at least.
“I hate you.”
He sucked in a deep breath when he was met with the cool breeze of the early morning, closing his eyes for a beat as he let it whisper through his hair.
“You’re an alpha, aren’t you? That’s a little unorthodox for a nanny, isn’t it?”
And not only that, but to… to do
They felt strangely cold on his skin, such a waring contrast to the overwhelming heat that was pressed up hard against him…
They were so different from his own parents, the vibrant array of warmth that surrounded them almost suffocating, their combined scents swirling freely together in a heady mix that was so foreign to the Omega.
“You’re a glorified
“Welcome back.”
Remember him? He fucking
Only, he had his wand then… and he had an unforgivable curse chanting in his mind as his tutor cornered him inside the tiny bathroom and ordered him on his knees.
“You must be Draco, pleasure to meet you, I’m Hermione.”
She assured him, her mouth twisting up in a gentle smile as her eyes grazed across the young Omega’s frozen body, his expression oddly pained.
Draco asked, the question more of a segway for his own mind. Hermione’s eyes widened a fraction and she smiled, tapping the tip of her finger against his nose as she got off the bed hastily and headed for the door.
Draco sat up straighter, his eyes once more finding Hermione’s again.
When he was done, he groaned, leaning back in his chair to relieve some of the pressure in his belly. Had he ever been that full before in his life?
She finished, sighing into her hands when she saw her son blink away budding tears, ignoring her gaze as he scowled down at his feet.
, younger than Harry had anticipated, with a shock of snow-fallen hair that fell just above his shoulders.
wasn't something you found all that deplorable. Forgive me for misunderstanding.”
The words were harsh but the man’s fingers were oddly gentle as he helped Draco sit up and drink.
Draco gasped out, another shudder running up his spine when he felt the alpha’s lips on his neck, smoothing gentle kisses over his sweaty skin. Over his mating mark— the same mark he had been hiding in vain under turtle necks and scarves, too nauseous to even look at it when he was alone.
“I usually am.”
He felt his face heat as he screwed his eyes shut… because not even those thoughts could hold a candle to what was happening to him right now, because... because that wasn’t the
had happened, and yet it seemed that no time had passed at all.
There was someone knocking on the door after that, a voice calling out to him, but he ignored it, letting the sound of the rushing water drown out everything else, even his own pitiful whimpers.
What do we think? 👀 I’m not the biggest fan of this chapter just because it gave me such a hard time, but I hope it was ok on your end! I feel like my writing has been really lacking lately and I’m a big ball of insecurities right now— so please ignore my ramblings, it’s late and I still haven’t packed lol 😩
“What— ah, how much did my parents tell you?”
He was suffocating on the artificial aroma of a fruit he usually didn’t care for, but it was better than the thick and heady scent of that
“Now,
“Know what?”
. A fact that had deeply irritated Harry to no end when he had gotten a proper look at him during dinner.
It was true, in comparison to before he felt like he was walking on air. There were no more cramps, no more pain… he felt
Harry let out a furious roar as his hands automatically released the Omega to rush to his nose, fingers already smearing a hot stream of blood across his lips.
“Malfoy?”
Harry chuckled, the sound light, the smile soft… but the eyes, those green eyes, they were anything but.
Hermione sighed, her voice getting quieter as they left the kitchen, whatever Ron said in reply swallowed by the distance.
as a doctor saw him, they would realise that there was nothing wrong with him physically and they would call him a liar. Probably toss him out on his ass, too.
“My cooking isn’t as adventurous as yours, dear, I don’t use any of that stuff, you know that.”
Ron’s stomach twisted.
They had hidden Draco away and somehow expected him to do without such a

The words left Draco’s lips with a
Draco managed to choke out, a brief second of relief when the hand loosened a little in reply.
“Fuck.”
Ron opened his mouth to speak, only to close it again, his mind coming to a sudden halt as those words swirled a storm inside his brain.
Ron warned with a smirk, watching Draco shake his head with an eye-roll.
The boy was
Harry continued, moving both his and Draco’s wands up high, holding them side-by-side under the glint of the full moon peeking through the mauve drapes.
This was
Ron sighed, half groaning into his hand before he ran it through his hair and straightened his back. He decided that he would wait for after dinner before he sat Draco down and had the talk. If he did it now then it would probably make things a little awkward around the dinner table— or at least, that was the excuse Ron was happy to use to delay the inevitable.
Hermione insisted, only for Draco to shake his head quickly.
Draco waved him off with a hand.
And it didn’t help that all he could smell was
Harry’s hands were on him, running under the constraints of his clothes before finally dipping low, fingers curving and grazing across his sensitive cock.
The boy laughed, eyeing Harry’s grimace as he crossed his legs and leaned back into the wall, the red marks on his chin already shadowing where Harry’s fingers had been.
She asked softly, grabbing the pepper before liberally shaking it over her eggs. Draco scrunched up his nose.
But, no. He couldn’t do that, because that would be the end of his life here for good. Harry had reminded him of that before he left, had given him the choice to choose, as if he already knew what Draco would do.
Draco murmured thoughtfully as he chewed, as if scouring his mind for the memory.
Happy reading! Xx
So... um... that happened 👀 any, uh, thoughts on that?
It was
When dinner was ready and they all sat down to eat, the atmosphere was surprisingly light. Draco and Hermione mostly talked between themselves when they both noticed Ron’s lack of attention in conversation.
Draco spat, the first real sign of genuine anger settling in those silver eyes. Harry held him for a moment longer before he scowled and let him go, moving over to a small wooden table tucked in the corner of the room before he pulled out a chair.
“Earth to Draco…”
He roared, and Draco whimpered in fear— but then whined in something
The Alpha roared victoriously into his Omegas throat as he came, sinking his teeth into the tender skin of the boy’s scent glad.
“Bloody thing!”
Ron said gruffly, a weary sigh leaving his lips as he watched the way Draco tensed up.

The words were out of Draco’s mouth before he could stop them and he wanted to bang his head against the table.
Harry had known suffering before he had even entered the world of magic, his childhood with the Dursley’s hadn’t exactly been a
He was so tight, so
“I’m not
Ron moved forward then, and somehow it left Draco feeling exposed. He followed him after a beat, squashing the sudden desire to reach out and grab the back of the Beta’s shirt like a frightened child.
“Anyway, ah, we’ll try you on a few different chores, and you can see what you like most. It doesn’t have to be something you hate, we’d prefer it if you could enjoy your time here.”
She knew he was more sensitive, knew that from his own account, he grew up almost entirely deprived of the scent of his parents— and everyone is else who had come into contact with him.
“Ah, thank you, but I’m just

Draco chuckled, liking the feel of it on his face. It used to hurt in the begging, the
Both Hermione and Ron shouted in union, but Draco didn’t hear the rest,
Alpha’s were territorial, and it wasn’t so strange for one to quickly adopt a place they had stayed at briefly and become protective of it… but to be territorial over
“I’ll do the hour tomorrow, too.”
She smiled when her son looked up at her abruptly, his wide eyes suddenly so young, suddenly so alike the child he was not so long ago.
The sound only melded with the noise of the party downstairs, the mind-numbing boom of the music vibrating the old walls, a cacophony of incessant chatter and chortles echoing under his feet.
“I don’t want to fucking hear it, just leave me the fuck alone!”
“Got any butterbeer left? Maybe we can mix it into his pasta.”
“Thank you, I appreciate the compliment. It’s just macaroni and cheese, a muggle
“Well, it seems there’s nothing wrong, the blood is nothing to worry about in this case– it can sometimes happen in the early stages. Still, we'll need to keep an eye on it over the next coming months to be safe.”
He was going to have to have a long talk with Draco when he got back.
Hermione said, this time the worry more pronounced in her voice.
Harry asked breathily, his hands rising to her shoulders to steady her as she finally looked at him.
“Mother, you promised! You can’t-“
She sighed, grimacing when Draco narrowed his eyes at her.
of happened. I promised to keep you safe and I haven’t exactly kept that promise, have I?”
“I can smell your slick.”
Draco was dressed to the nines, his delicate frame dazzling in a shining silver blouse that seemed to flow down over his shoulders like a molten waterfall. The shirt was tucked in at his middle where a pair of high-waisted black leather shorts fit snugly over his hips.
“He said he’s not feeling well.”
Hermione stepped forward, quickly pulling Draco into a hug which strangely, he seemed to sink into, a strained sigh escaping his lips at the contact.
Harry let out a slow breath as he gazed around the room, catching the way a few stray rays of sunlight shone through moth-bitten curtains and lit up a constellation of dust littering the air.
Harry was quick, using his larger frame to hold the Omega down, his scent swirling around him, unleashed like a vicious rapture…
He fought it, a rising panic prickling up his spine as he tried to wriggle away, ignoring the sharp flash of pain that warned him to keep still, holding him, stretching him wide and leaving him filled.
Thanks for reading 😈♥️
Ron asked softly, his heart thumping heavily in his chest as he watched Draco shiver on the spot, his arms wrapping around his belly, making him look even smaller than he already was.
“How did I get here?”
Draco nodded jerkily in answer and the healer jumped straight into his interrogation.
Draco screamed, his whole body shuddering as he came, a wave of blinding pleasure ripping through every cell, leaving him open, leaving him
and left to grow up within four dark wall… without even the pheromones of his parents to attune to.
Harry blew out his breath, his fist clenching as he watched Draco smirk at him, like he had just pulled the winning hand.
He whispered, and Hermione’s smile quickly turned to a look of concern as tears started to spill from his eyes. He sniffled miserably as the Alpha quickly pulled him into another hug, stroking his back as he fell into a fit of sobs.
“Manners, remember? Do I really have to teach you how to say ‘
Thanks a much for reading! Harry coming soon, to a chapter near you 😏
“I suppose mother didn’t warn you that I have quite the skilled hand at potions.”
Then, just like that, the omega was gone, like a passing breeze on a blistering day...
He smiled to himself, ignoring the tremor of his bottom lip as he leaned his head against the door.
“Thank you.”
“If you are quite done with the tantrum, I can get on with things.”
of it all didn’t really numb what had been done to him.
Harry’s nose wrinkled as something unpleasant drifted through the fog that had captured his brain, something misplaced in the honeyed air… something
Draco sighed, crossing his arms over his chest and leaning back into his chair with a disapproving click of his tongue.
*Edit: I’m writing another omegaverse Drarry, if you’re interested! It’s called—
Draco finally asked, biting his lip as Ron frowned and moved past him, slowly making his way from the kitchen and into the dining room. Draco followed closely behind, trying to peak past Ron’s larger body and failing miserably.
Because as
“Ah…”
Hermione sighed, narrowing her eyes at her mate in warning before directing her gaze back to Draco. She seemed to notice Draco’s blooming unease, his distress seeping through his well-guarded scent. Before she could say anything, Draco spoke up, his tone clipped to keep his voice from wavering.
“Sliced is fine. You’re on banana duty, so when I pour the batter into the pan you’ve got to put a few pieces on top. Don’t skimp out on me though, we’re banana crazy in this house.”
let himself live in the dark again.
“Are you alright, Draco? Rubeus didn’t scare you, did he? I promise he’s a sweet thing, he’ll be on his best behaviour from now on.”
She smiled at him encouragingly when he went to speak again, mouth agape and breath coming fast… only to close it and drop his head to her shoulder.
Harry asked, his voice strangely quiet, his words anything but.
No one seemed to notice him, but the voices eventually died down, and that was how Draco realised he was in his room, his skin sticky with sweat and his nostrils burning.
“Fuck.”
“It’s delicious…”
“Thanks for taking me out, Blaise, I haven’t had that much fun in a long time.”
Harry smiled again, his eyes casting down to the Omega’s wand, his fingers brushing over the velvety wood.
Draco shrugged, missing the way his friend’s eyes tightened at that.
“Good boy.”
… it was
“Wait, what? Chores?”
Draco suddenly screamed, his breath coming fast as he rocked back and forth, and Ron could only watch in horror as Draco sobbed pitifully into his own hands.
pumpkin soup again.”
Harry started, his grip on the Omega’s wrists tightening again in warning when he had started to move once more. He didn’t miss the flash of fear that took the boys eyes, but it was gone in an instant, replaced only by that same glare.
Draco moaned at the sharp sting spreading over his scalp, but all it did was add another song to the chorus of pain wrapping itself around his body.
Harry sighed, trying to ignore the way Draco watched him under heavy-lidded eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I didn’t say it was a bad thing.”
“I can tell.”
“We’ll start on this section first and hopefully we can then get to the rest of the wall before it gets too late.”
“But Ron will be home any minute now and he asked me to help with dinner.”
No. Draco scowled to himself, shaking his head of the thought, his eyes staring straight ahead into the horizon.
Harry, was more than a little
“Let’s have us a little
Ron quickly paled, swallowing thickly as he dropped his hand.
Ron asked, but she just shook her head and pursed her lips.

Draco sputtered, his face paling as he looked at the man, really looked at him.
His clothes were at his feet, soaked with water and overrun with strawberry-scented suds, washing away the smell of
Draco sighed, not looking up from his plate as he quickly scarfed down the rest of his meal.
“… but I am no longer hungry.”
Harry smirked, emerald eyes dancing mischievously when Draco audibly gasped at those words, the Omega jerking further back on his bed as he pulled the sheet higher over his lithe body.
magic whatsoever? Have you gone mad?”
Draco mumbled quietly before shuffling his way out of the room.
”Hey, kid, you gotta give us more than that. Where’s healer Borsk? What did he say?”
Draco sobbed, another jolt of pleasure rushing up his spine when Harry hooked his finger and found the place inside him that made him scream.
