“It was completely empty when I got it,” she switched to the first page, “these were my first requests. I just wrote down what I wanted, closed the book – and within seconds stuff flew at me from all sides! Her Ladyship overdid it a bit, I’m afraid, not sure every item she suggested is in fact useful, but I already found some interesting stuff… it’s just so much, I summoned it all to my room but haven’t been able to sort through it yet.”
“Oh well,” Hermine straightened her hair and smiled at Harry, “I’m actually glad you know, it was weird keeping this secret from you.”
before he gave in and flung himself onto his bed, astounded by his own sobbing. He was so very… angry. And his chest hurt so much. But he certainly did not cry for Draco Malfoy.
Harry became more nervous by the minute– he had to find the perfect colour for Draco and fast. When it was his time to practice, Harry gulped and went to the front. Strangely enough the whole class fell silent. Draco looked at him expectantly and Harry closed his eyes. The only colour that came to his mind was the one he had chosen for his bedroom at Number Twelve,
Draco seemed to be intrigued by Harry’s fascination for the painting. He rose from his sofa, picked up both of their mugs and stepped next to Harry handing him his tea. ”Pity, you don’t like it – I think it’s beautiful… very calming to look at.”
“Ginny, don’t,” Harry said, “she’s not ordering me. It’s an invitation. Grant you, the language is a bit odd, but I guess that’s pure-blood lingo?” He grinned and Ginny relaxed.
Ron certainly did not need to be encouraged. He grinned widely and stuffed his mouth with a chocolate treat. When he grabbed for another one before he had even gulped down the first, Hermione elbowed him in the ribs and Harry chuckled.
Odie beamed at Harry. “That is so lovely, Harry! And what a sweet pet name for David! Draco – how cute is that!”
Teddy finally calmed down and his hair turned lavender. Harry walked back into the kitchen with the baby in his arms. Meanwhile Josh had finished eating and offered to hold Teddy, so Harry could continue his lunch. But Teddy started to sob again as soon as Harry tried to hand him over.
The Headmistress’ concession to the Ball’s motto was wearing a top hat instead of her usual pointed one. When she saw Harry standing next to Draco, dressed in similar clothes, she raised one eye-brow and smiled. Harry exhaled. He had not been sure what to expect – after all he was dating a suspect. Still, he had always assumed that McGonagall –just like Harry himself– believed Draco to be innocent.
Hannah went for her favourite bright peach and everybody agreed, Draco looked quite horrible in it. Even worse was Neville’s choice of military green.
“You will always find someone in the painting ready to deliver a message – like this red squirrel by the name of Polly – if you have news to report or need support. Be assured none of us former Headmasters and Headmistresses is inclined to pop up without being asked, except in case of urgency or imminent danger. This is actually quite a sacrifice for some of us. The Wizard’s Wood – that’s the name of the painting – happens to be a favourite place of recreation for many Imagics.”
“Yeah, I see Hermione’s point. They certainly don’t need me to have a good time,” he said while thinking
“Wow, that’s… that’s a rather intimate question…,” Cass stuttered, “… it’s impossible to choose just one… I would have to name at least a dozen or so…”
“I see you reserve the nappy change for pudding,” Andromeda grinned picking up her spoon as well. “But do not hope I will forget it’s your turn to do it.”
“You know of course, she hardly ever talks,” Aberforth said. “Never was much of a chatterbox and since the war she stopped speaking altogehter, I haven’t heard her say a word for months.”
“Now, what about you, dear? You’re alright? I hope your family is not giving you a hard time for being gay?”
Harry gulped. “Me and Draco, that’s a little bit more complicated I guess… but I still know what you mean, I remember feeling awfully proud being his date at the ball. But of course it’s different… difficult…”
“Come on, Harry, let’s go,” Ron gave Harry a meaningful look, turned to leave and grudgingly Harry followed his example.
“I guess so! I’m pretty sure her Ladyship could tell because the copy was created at Hogwarts – we would just have to fetch your book and show it to her!”
When he apparated back to No 12 late in the evening, he was quite content. After all, nothing bad had happened, he had only asked another guy for a date. Worst case, Josh wasn’t interested and Harry had made a bit of a fool of himself. Well, that wasn’t a first and would certainly not be the last time, no need to worry about it. Josh was a decent guy, he was sure of that. If he declined, he would just say so and certainly not gossip about Harry asking him out.
There was a bang coming from the exit and seconds later Hermione rushed back into the gym shouting, “The Ravenclaws have left! Next house – Hannah and the Hufflepuffs, come with me please!”

“Thank you, Kreacher,” Harry said and took a bite from the kidney-pie, “mhhh... excellent... everything's delicious! You can go back to the kitchen now.”
“No you didn’t. You hurt me – but only after I tried to torture you.” Draco shrugged but still stared at the front of the room. “Fighting you… it was the only way of keeping my distance, I guess.”
Harry stared at the colourful little mats in front of him. Each place mat seemed to be of a unique pattern and with a name woven into it. Luna’s mat showed a delirious floral pattern in shades of blue, with plenty of red and yellow lines drawn into it but without a trace of green. Ron’s pattern was a bright red and yellow tartan, with some finer lines of green and blue.
“Ah, Ms Granger, come along, come along, I want to show you something – and you of course Mr Potter, Mr Weasley,” Flitweak squeaked excitedly and guided them to the boudoir painting resting on top of an easel at the back of his room.
“Fuck! No!” Harry cried. “Actually, yes, go into hiding with your Muggle… friends. Even if I hate them already. Maybe that’s a clever way of covering your tracks. But don’t –do you hear me?– don’t stay there forever! You shouldn’t make a decision of such consequence in the midst of a crisis anyway! Promise, please?” Harry begged.
“Brilliant indeed! Plus helping Mr Potter is certainly worth some credit on your probation scale Ms Malfoy,” Josh said to the woman in his charge.
“We could talk here, if you like? There’s no room more private in the castle”, Harry suggested, as nobody would be able to climb the squeaking spiral staircase without giving them notice. Otto finally stopped nuzzling Cass' hair and took his seat on Harry’s arm.
Harry dreaded to be questioned about Draco when he met with Ron and Hermione after breakfast. But his friends seemed to sense that he did not want to talk about it, neither of them mentioned Draco. They sat in Harry’s room, did some homework together and pondered the still unsolved mystery of missing Imagics – but carefully stepped around the issue of Harry’s changed relationship with his former adversary. Several times Harry caught Ron gawping at him, but never did his best pal dare to ask what was actually going on. He was quite grateful for their reticence as he would not have known what to tell them. Harry felt he had done all he could do and now it was Draco’s turn to make up his mind.
“Seriously?” Ginny stared at her ex, “but… I thought you of all people would get it?” Her eyes darted from Harry to Draco.
Josh nodded and kicked his heel in the ground. “Yep. Looks like I’ve fucked up my career pretty badly.”
Harry sat down, heart pounding. Had he given away his feelings for Draco? And if so, was that good or bad? Before he could make up his mind, Blaise stepped to the front. He was the last one to practice.
Harry blushed. Molly Weasley had become most certainly his surrogate mother since their first encounter, years ago at Kingscross station. And as much as he loved her, he was not looking forward to one of her lengthy lectures today.
Harry gave the C.O.M.A. volume to Flitwick and told the Headmistress about his message to Snape. Both McGonagall and Flitwick approved of this move. Snape’s Imagic turned up shortly afterwards and –just as Harry had expected– he insisted on stepping in for the Fat Lady.
This did not come totally unexpectedly. Harry was fully aware of having unresolved issues about… well, his sexual orientation. Compared to the other challenges of his teenage years – like killing Voldemort and saving the wizarding world – being confused about his sexual preferences had seemed rather irrelevant. Yes, his first crush on Cho might have been mingled with feelings he had harboured for her boyfriend Cedric. Yes, he had always loved to look at pictures of professional Quidditch players, preferably with fewer clothes on display than during a game. And yes, being with Ginny had felt nice, but… not nearly half as exciting as some of his dreams lately.
"But, Hermione... a security risk? I think you’ve lost perspective!" Ron went on. "So far the school is short of four Imagics. Well, inconvenient as that might be, it does not put any living, breathing person in jeopardy – and apparently the Headmistress is not too alarmed either.”
Draco bit his lips before he said, “That’s exactly what I’ve been asking myself for the last few hours. In Muggle crime fiction the motive is either money or sex.” He paused and Harry was baffled about Draco’s knowledge of Muggle fiction!
She sighed deeply and caressed the cup with a hesitant finger. The moment her skin touched the bone china, something unexpected happened in the painting. While Bellatrix kept glaring, little Andromeda turned her face to Narcissa and kissed her sister on the cheek. Narcissa blushed twice, in the picture and right in front of Harry and Ginny, who had the embarrassing feeling of having watched a very intimate moment not meant to be observed.
“A family,” Floppy whispered barely audible. “Mother, father and two boys. It is old, the picture. Floppy thinks Master Professor Laddley himself is the elder brother.”
They watched the owls flying in and out for a while in silence. A huge snow-owl landed close to them and stared at Otto, who seemed to be delighted by the attention.
Harry wondered for a moment how Snape was meant to sit down with them, but then he saw the easel next to several sofas, holding a painting of an empty wing chair in front of a fire place.
“But she never left without a proper replacement,” Hermione said, “that’s the alarming thing! I’m pretty sure she’s been abducted and, yes, Harry, I agree with you – that’s a direct attack at our house. In fact Tharros’ involvement is even more unlikely now. All the missing Imagics are closely connected to Gryffindor – she can’t be responsible!”
The afternoon tea dance was a roaring success. Harry had never had so much fun at any of Hogwarts’ festivities before and not just because he was now officially dating Draco Malfoy. In fact he didn’t even spend much time with Draco, because many students –boys and girls alike– wanted to dance with Harry and he didn’t turn anyone down. The dress code seemed to make kids more daring and even the first-years were not shy to approach their hero. Draco on the other hand was also a very sought after dance-partner because of his excellent skills. That is why the two of them hardly ever danced with each other.
Then he gave Harry a meaningful look. “Hey, I won’t ask you about Draco’s whereabouts but I am pretty sure you know more than you let Kingsley know –“
Maybe there had been someone else last year, when Harry was on the run? He had to find out, he would ask Ginny about it –
“That’s better, thank you,” Harry said, “I understand that you are confused, but Professor Flitwick will take care of the situation.”
His heart skipped when he found one curtain drawn close. Taking his breath he carefully pulled the heavy fabric aside – to find Luna and Dean snogging. Luckily they were so engrossed with each other that they didn’t even realize his presence
Harry was amused by his friends’ bickering. Some things obviously never change and he was quite glad about that.
“What madness is this? Ahhhh … get off me!” the attacked cried. “Nooo … ahhhh …” He blustered and Pinkie shrieked again.
When he finally joined his classmates again, their Potions lesson was nearly over. Professor Slughorn did not seem to mind, he even offered to tutor Harry in case he had questions about today’s homework. The rest of the afternoon Harry spent at the pool, first instructing younger students and later on swimming laps next to Blaise and Tommy, until it was time to get dressed for dinner. Not that he was particularily hungry.
“Funny enough, I can’t remember dad ever mentioning him… strange, don’t you think?” Ron replied, “I always assumed dad knows everybody dealing with Muggle issues.”
“Don’t worry, I’m sure he’s having a great time – Hagrid is sitting him,” said Andromeda. Instead of Teddy she was accompanied by her sister. Harry was a bit embarrassed by Narcissa Malfoy seeing him in pyjamas as she was of course immaculately styled as usual. But Draco’s mother smiled and enquired politely about his health. She was clearly determined to be on friendly terms with him.
“The Room of Requirement! It’s supposed to return, if we need it,” Harry explained while trying to straighten Draco’s shirt without much success, “and I dare say we need it urgently. We simply have to search for it… oh, for fuck’s sake, your shirt is crumpled beyond hope –everybody will see what we’ve been up to! Let’s just –“ he opened his sporran, pulled out the invisibility cloak and threw it over their heads.
Harry moved quickly between Elf and wall. “No need to apologise, Kreacher. You have done very well! I am sure you would have told me anything worthwhile. I trust you, Kreacher.”
Draco must have seen Harry’s attempts in the beginner’s corner of the ballroom, getting first instructions from Flitwick. He blew at his tea and Harry could see the tiniest bit of a pink tongue tipping the rim of Draco’s cup. Which was totally distracting.
Although Harry was pretty sure, Ron was joking, he feared for his friend’s confidence. Ron was prone to feelings of inferiority. Harry decided to play for a joke instead.
McGonagall opened a roll of parchment lying on her desk. “I took notes… both Professor Tharros and Professor Jordan paid several visits to the archives during the summer months, which is not unusual at all. Preparing for classes often requires research especially for new teachers. But neither of them went to the archives after mid-August and if our esteemed Imagics remember correctly, and we have no reason to doubt this –“ several of the Imagics around the walls murmured their approval, “– Albus’ Imagic disappeared sometime during the last week of August. So both Jordan’s and Tharros’ visits seem to be unsuspicious.
But the one portrait Harry was most eager to look at was empty. The tall gilt frame right behind McGonagall’s chair showed nothing but a rather dull backdrop of an empty chair and an odd curtain, whereas Albus Dumbledore’s wise face was not to be seen. Harry was rather disappointed.
“Good idea,” said Harry, then he turned to Hannah Abbot, “Hannah and the Hufflepuff prefects, would you do the same for your fellows? That’s great, thank you. And finally… looks like there’s no prefect from Slytherin with us but quite a number of younger students… Draco and Blaise, could you two walk your lot back to the dungeons?”
“Your uncle is supposed to be out of the country and the Ministry is on his heels anyway, I think we can’t do much about this line of enquiry… but tell me about Laddley.”
“Sometimes the best way to help is –it might sound terribly boring, Charles– following orders. And it might even take courage,” he explained, “especially if that’s not what your friends want to do, understood?”
Before Harry even had a chance to reply, Draco said, “I’m most certainly not worshipping Jordan! I just happen to prefer having my probation officer in plain sight in front of me – instead of having him hard on my heels.”
Following an impulse Harry opened the door to the common room, instead of going downstairs right away.
Otto seemed to sense her discomfort and moved back to Cass’s shoulder hooting softly. She smiled and petted the owl distractedly while she continued, “So here it goes… my sleaze-bag of a father, Taurus Malfoy happens to be a very talented painter and also a first class expert of Charms. Being a Malfoy he did not really need to find himself a profession, even as a younger son he was well off financially, but his talents did not stay unnoticed among wizards and witches interested in arts– which are not too many, I have to say. Compared to the Muggle world, our lot seems to be rather single minded. We pretty much focus on magic and Quidditch, that’s it. Most witchards –that’s the gender neutral term for witches and wizards, by the way– have no clue about music, fine arts, sports, foreign cultures and what not. It’s a shame actually.”
Draco cleared his voice. “What I said yesterday evening… you know, about why you better not get involved with me, because I’m just a mess and you deserve much better… well, that’s only part of the truth. There’s other stuff as well, things you should know… about me… oh, fuck – this is harder, than I imagined…” his voice trailed off.
“Draco… I really… we’re not…” Harry stuttered, “I guess he’s alright but I’ve quit the early morning–… whatever, we don’t talk much lately.”
“I am very glad that your recovery is making good progress, Harry,” she said looking slightly worried, “and not just because I hope that you will be able to find my son… although I have to admit, that’s part of it.”
“For once I agree with your cousin. Reluctantly.” Hermione gave Draco a stern look, “He has a point. With such grades you will need no coaching at all.”
He cleared his voice, “Well apparently… Madame Pince… no, the library… Hermione… oh fuck – I don’t know how to explain this!” he blurted, “The library is a lady and she fancies you, Hermione! You can do whatever you want with it… with her… whatever.”
Andromeda he saw quite frequently, being the grandmother of his orphaned godson, whom she raised. Her recent losses gave Harry lots of reasons for guilt trips. He tried to take Teddy off her hands at least once a week for a few hours, usually at Friday afternoon. And although baby-sitting had been rather awkward at first, he had soon started to thoroughly enjoy the hours spent with his godson – at least as long as the nappy didn’t need to be changed.
Molly sighed. “Of course, love. First of all – I really trust your judgement. If you think Draco Malfoy has a good heart, I’m sure he has. For those terribly bad decisions he has made, while still half a child, I hold his parents far more responsible than him. In fact, I am very much looking forward to getting to know this young man who has won your heart.”
Flitwick nodded and asked them to step back from the easel. Then he started to whisper a complicated incantation while dragging both wand and brush around the frame of the painting. Harry could only understand a few words, something like ‘
For some endless seconds the hall fell totally silent. Most of the students and members of staff alike seemed stunned. One by one people started to clap their hands. Some were obviously polite enough to do so although they had no idea, what that motto was all about. Others grinned widely and began to cheer. Ginny jumped up and struck one fist in the air yelling “Yes!”
Ron looked very pleased with himself and then asked. “So… what about you and Ginny? Any chance of hooking up again?”
“Which it won’t!” said Hermione with an encouraging smile at Harry. Suddenly she dropped her wand, which she had pointed at the newly mended wall between their rooms, and Harry found himself wrapped in a thight hug, her tuft of brown hair in his face.
Harry grinned at her, “Yeah, it’s good news, at least we hope it is… Hermione found a book at the library, it’s called C.O.M.A. Cyclopedia of Mean Arts. One Chapter explains in detail how to turn a painting into a trap for Imagics – just like the one Mrs Malfoy owns! Funny thing is, a copy of the very same book happens to be part of the library at No 12, the Blacks’ library.”
“All right, Harry… – hold on a minute! Not Harry Potter, by chance?!” the man grinned broadly. “Don’t tell me you’re famous Harry Potter?”
Harry secured the letter to Otto’s leg and the owl sailed gracefully through the open window hooting softly. Harry’s eyes followed Otto as long as he could see the owl’s white feathers in the darkness. Then he sighed and closed the window. This day had been intense.
“Hi,” Harry replied with a grin, “glad to see you too. Actually, I have a request, Sir Cardogan. You know Daisy? Girl in a white dress, with a huge bird for a pet? I’d like to know where she is. Could you search for her?”
“Luna, Hannah, Blaise and Draco – please stay at your old dormitories until the heads of houses take over and send you back, which might take a while, especially for Flitwick. Dean, I’m sure you’ll find shelter at Ravenclaw House for tonight.” Dean blushed und Luna looked delighted.
“Oh fuck it,” Harry groaned. It was way too late for early morning tea with Draco. But what was the point of it anyway? Draco would not miss him, most likely he had only kept to their routine to humour Harry for Ginny’s sake.
“Oh, but I think you will, darling! Because I am rather good at Unforgivable Curses – if I say so myself… especially the Cruciatus Curse has always been one of my favourites.”
and smiled to himself when the door swung open. Yes, he could hear the Gryffindor students complaining about being held back well enough now. Neville was not to be envied.
“No, just some unpleasant incident with a vomiting book from the Black library – sorry, no table manners,” Harry mumbled.
“But you are,” Harry said, “nice, kind-hearted and tolerant – in spite of your upbringing.” Otto hooted approvingly.
Then she turned to Ginny and said, “You are quite right, we are able to pass as twins and believe me, we made good use of it, when we were kids. Fooled our parents quite a bit, didn’t we Draco?” she turned to her cousin, trying to include him into the conversation. Draco rolled his eyes and leaned back into his seat as if he tried to blend in with the upholstering.
“Don’t you get fresh with me, young man,” Odie said with a mock frown. “What was I saying? Ah – the question remains, do you still want to sit the girls, David, or would you rather go back to school immediately? We could ask the neighbours instead. But if you consider staying until we return tomorrow, Harry is welcome to keep you company of course.”
“I know exactly what you mean, that’s just how I feel about Cassy,” Draco said raising his gaze and for one of those rare moments he looked right into Harry’s eyes.
Oh, that was a surprise. Harry was curious what she had in mind. To his amazement Ms Malfoy took a rather large painting out of her somewhat dowdy leather bag. Obviously Hermione was not the only woman in possession of an enchanted handbag.
Harry hardly believed his eyes. This was undoubtedly Sylvia Silver, the formerly naked lady, walking at Severus Snape’s side.
Like the previous weekends, Harry spent some hours of Saturday afternoon with his pet in the air, which was once again an excellent distraction. Otto was in high spirits and they dived and raced until Harry was out of breath. Flying back to the owlery, he was so exhausted, that he even pondered the idea of a little nap before changing into his costume – when suddenly Otto shot ahead, shrieked and entered the owlery in a whirl. Harry was curious, what his pet had spotted and carefully manoeuvred his broom into the bird-house – to find a very excited Otto sitting on Draco Malfoy’s shoulder, nuzzling his blond hair.
“Hush, off you go,” Neville said to Blaise, “I’ve got to concentrate, if I want to win that one. Why don’t you ask our nutcase musician to play the piano for us?”
“Thank you, Poppy, my dear,” Aberforth rasped in a horrible voice and sat down. His eyes met Harry’s, who was struck by the sight of him. Aberforth’s eyebrows were gone and his face was covered in heavy rashes that made Harry appreciate the fact, that his own face had been barely touched by the flames.
But Floppy’s and Millie’s report had not been the only news of the day. When Molly and Arthur finally appeared at Gryffindor Tower, the Weasley siblings were in for another surprise. Not only would their mother be teaching D.A.D.A., but their father had agreed to step in for Laddley and to take over Muggle Studies for the time being. When they told their kids that Flitwick had asked Arthur to stay at school as well, at least temporarily, it was one of the very rare moments when both Ron and Ginny gawped speechlessly at their parents.
Ginny stopped laughing and looked slightly embarrassed. “Sorry, my dear,” she said, “but I’m afraid you’ll have to work that out for yourself.” She shivered. “Well, I better take a hot shower fast before I freeze to death… Hermione's waiting for you upstairs by the way, she looks so smug, as if she invented a spell to control the solar system, you know that look?” She blew him a kiss and headed for the girls’ showers.
“Yeah, that’s most unlikely. Plus Draco would not keep it secret, if it were that horrible. He could even improve his probation regime, if he were able to unmask a hidden Death Eater, don’t you think? I guess it’s something more personal, a flaw of character probably. Okay, I’ll try to persuade him to tell me.” Harry said, “Next question: Ability or talent for Magical Arts? According to Ron, Josh claims to be clueless. I wasn’t able to bring it up with Laddley so far. What about Tharros?”
“Oh no, it’s quite simple. Madam Pince gave me a special book…” she stopped at the foot of the stairs, rummaged in her bag and pulled out a small volume bound in soft purple leather.
The smell of his trunk –unventilated clothes, slightly dusty– it was so similar to the smell of the cupboard under the stairs of No 4 Privet Drive… why had that never occurred to him before?
Harry ran his fingers through his hair. His mind raced. He had to convince McGonagall, he had to find the flaw in her arguments. Draco simply could not be responsible for this mess.
Harry took the little tot from his grandma and planted a kiss in Teddy’s hair, which turned immediately a bright shade of pink.
They took shelter beyond the porch and Cass teased Ginny for having obviously slipped on the wet ground as her back was covered in mud. Ginny laughed, turned around and wiggled her bottom in Cass’ direction which made Draco laugh out loud.
“Good evening, Gryffindors,” she said. “I came to see what all this noise was about – well, it’s very good of you to visit, Mr Potter. Your house has missed you.”
“She’s to be sorted backstage,” Draco explained, “There’s no sorting ceremony tonight, the first-years have been sorted a month ago and nobody wants Cass to be exposed on her first night.” He seemed tense and Harry could well imagine why. If Narcissa Malfoy was right, Cass would not be a Slytherin – which must be tough for her cousin.
“But I still hope Professor Flitwick gets the necessary permission from Ms Malfoy,” Sylvia said, “for getting some proper clothes and also for staying permanently at Hogwarts. Professor Flitwick and the Headmistress promised to keep me on display and that’s so much better than existing in storage. Also I would like very much to stay for Pippin’s sake of course. He has taken such a liking to Headmaster Snape.” She blushed again and glanced at Snape with adoring eyes.
“Surely not all the pretty girls have a crush on Draco?” Dean looked at Luna with a slightly nervous expression.
“Professor Flitwick himself, of course,” McGonagall said, ”as I mentioned, he is quite an expert in Magical Arts, which are in fact part of Highly Advanced Charms. It’s tradition that the Master of Charms does the portrait of the residing Headmaster or Headmistress of Hogwarts. Albus just delayed this task until the very last moment.”
“I’m sure it does, Professor,” Harry responded. He felt inclined to smile encouragingly at Laddley. If Laddley was able to see the light of reason, Harry was willing to reassess his opinion of him. Especially today, with his heart full of joy.
“Listen, Kreacher,” Harry said at the foot of the stairs, “a few weeks ago I’ve asked you about unusual sightings of Imagics and you mentioned that those House-elves, who do the room service, might know – remember?”
Silently she conjured a Patronus and sent her cat-shaped messenger down the stairs. They were all rather surprised, when mere seconds later her Patronus reappeared with Laddley hard on the cat's paws.
To get back to the topic at hand, Harry said, “Yeah, right you are. So… who cares about Magical Arts?”
“Starving? Excuse me!” Hermione glared incredulously at her boy-friend, “You’ve just had a huge slice of ham and a leek pie, not to mention a load of chips –“
“Yeah, she did.” Cass paused for a moment and grasped the windowsill hard. When she continued to talk, she faced the open sky, as if she were not talking to Harry anymore but to the air, the wind and the light rain that hat started to fall again. Otto seemed to sense her discomfort and cooed softly as if he wanted to calm Cassy.
Flitwick improved her protection, made some changes to the raptor which is guarding her… and now they have to stay at the seaside for some reason. That is why Polly has to play messenger once again.”
“There you are,” said Draco with a nervous smile. Hands at his hips he was leaning against a pillar at the side of the balustrade. Blonde hair shining in the light of numerous candles, grey eyes burning, elegant even in his kilt – the sight of him was dazzling.
Harry stared at the apparition. They had put all the known facts about the whole affair onto the board. There was a timeline, starting with the removal of the portraits from Hogwarts to the archives up to the present day, pictures of the missing Imagics and of the four suspects and so many remarks that Harry guessed, he needed an hour to read them all. He stepped closer to have a better look.
“I think we have to reconsider the safekeeping of late Headmaster Dumbledore’s wand,” said Minerva McGonagall who listened in to the interview.
Harry slapped Ron’s shoulder harder but laughed. He was awfully glad that Ron was joking again. They resumed walking quietly for a few minutes. It was a fine morning. Harry enjoyed the fresh autumn air, the sprinkle of frost on the trees which gradually melted as the sun came out. When the path took a turn they could finally see the village. Hogsmeade was the picture of an old-fashioned hamlet, with its weather-beaten stone houses and smoke drifting from their chimneys straight up in the air.
They crossed the borders of Hogwarts. Flying smoothly over tree tops Harry and Otto left the castle behind. He would leave Hogwarts for good in only a few months time... to do what exactly?
“So Uncle Taurus –Cassy’s father– would be a natural suspect as he always wanted to be the Master of the Manor and he’s the next in line… but he is wanted for his crimes anyway, he could never claim the heritage, even if I were out of the picture.” He shook his head. “On the other hand – if I simply asked myself, whom I distrust, that would be Laddley of course.”
“As far as I know my son has been fascinated by you since your very first encounter at Madam Malkin’s – you might remember that? Harry Potter was all he would talk about for the rest of the afternoon.
Harry threw back his head and laughed. He laughed, flooded with relief and feeling as if he wouldn’t stop laughing soon, not in a long time.
“Thank you, Ms Granger… about my request – well, I don’t know yet,” Sylvia Silvers Imagic whispered nearly inaudibly.
Ron burst out laughing. “Welcome back to the world of mischief, ‘Mione! I’ve wondered how long it'll take you to be done with following the rules in times of peace. What did you say, eh? ‘
“Wow – that must be a crib-charmer! Those toys are incredibly rare and valuable!” Hermione exclaimed.

“Oh Darling, I’ve no idea what you are even talking about!” fake-Draco laughed. “I know perfectly well where Draco is. Right here, at the Hogshead Inn.” He took a bow.
Still under cover of the Invisibility Cloak Harry wrapped one arm around Draco’s hips and moved them both towards the door, relieved, that Draco didn’t resist. They even brushed lightly against a girl but in the turmoil after Shacklebolt’s declaration she didn’t seem to realise.
They all stepped closer to the painting next to the empty space, where Snape’s Imagic was to be seen standing at a beautiful beach. To Harry’s surprise the Imagic had taken off his robes, shoes and socks. Wearing just a shirt and rolled up trousers he stood so close to the water that every now and then a wave splashed over his bare feet.
Harry walked towards the Manor the following afternoon wondering what on earth Narcissa Malfoy wanted to discuss with him this time. Otto was overexcited. Sitting on Harry’s shoulder he fluttered nervously and nibbled at Harrys hair, obviously strung high by anticipation to see his family again.
“Yes, exactly. I never believed Taurus Malfoy to be clever enough for inventing such a complex spell in the first place,” Hermione said with disdain.
he thought climbing upstairs. He wanted nothing more than to be alone in his room. Maybe there was time for a nap before lunch? Suddenly Harry felt extremely tired.
Harry felt a pang of regret. “Look, I’m sorry. Truly, I am. It’s just… you haven’t found anything useful yet… just yesterday evening you said so yourself.”
Harry had heard more than enough. Adrenalin and hot anger were flushing his body. He removed the cloak, stood up and said, “Thank you Tommy, that was very brave of you!” Then he stepped closer to face his teacher.
Harry grinned. He was actually quite fond of the atmosphere. The room was hopelessly overcrowded, because the news of his presence had drawn every student down from the dormitories. Some overexcited first-years had even hugged Harry and seemed close to climbing on his lap, which really touched him. Had he and his friends really been so tiny just a few years ago? It was hard to believe.
Now it was Draco’s turn to blush. “You wish, Potter…” He rose from his chair and turned to the door. “Thanks for the tea and the inspiring conversation, but I’ve got to make myself presentable.”
Harry stared at the name. Martin McBride. So that was Draco’s Muggle friend. Harry took another look at the building. The house stood at a crossroad in a residential area, a fine semidetached house with a brick façade surrounded by a well-trimmed garden. The tall pine-tree next to the house was draped in a garland and a wreath at the door added some more seasonal touch. He had not expected Draco’s refuge to be so decent… so middle-class. But this was the place Otto had guided him to. The owl had settled in the top of the pine and was probably fast asleep by now.
“Of course this has nothing at all to do with gender, character or –another prejudice– relationship issues. It simply depends on the animals involved. I can make an educated guess that Mr Weasley’s former Patronus was a pet whereas Ms Granger’s is a wild animal?”
Harry had no idea what to say to that. He was overwhelmed by remorse, love, compassion and a well-known feeling of guilt.
Harry and Ron drew breath to yell their protest but Hermione beat them to it as she said with a wicked grin, “Well, they come in quite handy, in case I want to have some obnoxious Slytherin punched in the groin.”
“So…” Draco sighed, ”that’s another reason why I said you deserve much better. Actually I think Jordan would be perfect for you. He’s kind, honest… and good looking as well. If anybody deserves you, it’s him.” He snorted. “Have I mentioned that I hate him? And don’t pretend you’re not interested – I know you are!”
“Congrats, Cass,” Draco said, turning to his cousin, ”well, it was to be expected. You are much better off in any other house than Slytherin… as we are presently not at the height of our popularity I’m afraid. Plus Gryffindor sure can use some functioning brains besides Granger’s.”
“Well, if they must… I definitely have not abducted any obese female Imagic,” Draco smiled and planted another soft kiss on Harry’s temple, “on the other hand – if a nude painting of a certain superhero were amiss, I might well be a plausible suspect.” He gave Harry’s body a tight squeeze.
There was a flickering light behind drawn curtains of two first-floor windows. Following an impulse Harry hovered in mid-air and peeked inside, making use of a gap between the curtains – and nearly lost his balance on the broom! He had to steady himself because the sight was horrifying – surely that could not be true? He must have hallucinations!
Harry suddenly realized all his swimmers were gathered at the railing close to where he and Draco were having their shouting match. They were actually gawping at Harry and Draco, which irritated Harry quite a bit.
For the next few days Harry concentrated all his energy on the investigation, which was a convenient way of keeping any unwelcome thoughts about Draco Malfoy at bay – although Draco was still one of the suspects and Harry still believed him to be innocent.
“Mr Weasley needs to overcome his shock and I’m sure you have homework to do?” She added and dismissed Harry and his friends with an amused look.
And Harry wasn’t even annoyed about other students keeping them apart. In fact it was quite a relief, as dancing with Draco turned out to be rather overwhelming. The novel sensation of physical closeness was way too thrilling to feel comfortable in public. Holding hands was exciting enough, but the touch of Draco’s hand on his back, Draco’s breath close to Harry’s ear, the smell of Draco –a hint of citrus and Mediterranean herbs maybe?– all of this made Harry’s body ache for more. He basically wanted to rip Draco’s clothes off, which was not an appropriate idea for an afternoon tea dance of course.
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Harry said, “if you’ll excuse me… bathroom.” He nodded and turned to leave.
“Well, many witchard families might be open-minded nowadays,” Harry said, “but we all know that some traditional pure-bloods still discriminate against queer witches.” Harry said giving Cass a quick glance.
When he entered the Great Hall half an hour later, Cass was talking to Hermione and Ron over breakfast.
“Point taken. Honestly, I more than regret the decision to fly to the pub all alone… but… this is different. There’s no evil wizard lurking around anymore! It’ll be nothing more than a tedious long distance flight.”
“Yeah, you could do that, there’s enough left for two more servings. I’m afraid I’ve gotta go now,” Josh said sounding reluctant. “Listen Harry, your question, about having a drink together… it’s complicated… I’d like to explain but I’m afraid I have to hurry.” He seemed to hesitate before finally he said, “I’ll owl you, promise.”
“And because the Tracking Spell didn’t work properly, you assume he left secretly and Apparated back to London for a few hours, ran to the Ministry and abducted an Imagic? Seriously?” Harry shook his head. “I don’t think he is even capable of wandless Apparation and his wand was still confiscated at that time.”
Ron chuckled. “Yeah, she is. And I certainly don’t blame her… actually he comes in quite handy – her endurance on the dance-floor is much better than mine – I’m already beaten. I should probably let her lead…”
“Coming,” Harry shouted. His heart skipped a beat – maybe Draco was looking for him? No, no – he needed to stop thinking about Draco.
“Most certainly, Filius… any chance of getting my glass topped up?” She smiled at Harry while Flitwick poured the firewhiskey, “How’s your recovery coming along? Matron said you might be ready to fly within a few days – is that true?”
“You know what? I think that description might actually please her,” Harry said and risked biting into one of the muffins after some hesitation. It was quite nice, mostly pineapple and coconut flavour with a hint of lemon.
He retreated right after pudding and was now by himself, busy worrying and pacing his room like a trapped animal once again. This time it was not only Draco’s absence that concerned him, he was also worried how Molly and Arthur would get along with Mrs Malfoy, as they intended to spend this evening together.
Harry suppressed a laugh and was glad to see, that the young Healer grinned as well. She didn’t seem offended one bit.
“Always good to develop a new skill,” Harry grinned. He reached down and brushed his fingers lightly against the back of Draco’s hand.
“Oh yes, I can and I will with great pleasure! I will report your outrageous behaviour to the Headmistress immediately and I sincerely hope I don’t have to see
“– and we played Bridge and I was quite content,” the Imagic shrugged apologetically before she addressed the former Headmistresses, “I had no idea you were trapped with me!” She dropped her glance and sighed, “I am so very sorry!”
“That won’t be necessary,” said Ron pulling at Harry’s arm. “It’s okay, Harry, calm down. Mr Dumbledore will have his reasons,” he addressed the older man, “Sorry, Mr Dumbledore – we did not want to upset you. We’ll just leave now, okay?”
Hermione nodded. “I totally agree with Harry. Plus Molly’s going to be brilliant at keeping students in check! This woman was trained by Fred and George – she’ll have no problems with discipline. Grant you, it might be a little bit awkward at first, not just for you but for me as well, seeing she’s practically my mother-in-law – but I’m sure she’ll handle this fair.” She turned towards Cass. “You needn’t worry, Cassy – Molly is such a kind person, she’ll take to you in an instant.”
Hermione sighed, “That’s exactly what irritates me. If Draco is innocent –and I still trust Harry’s and Cass’ judgement– why has he disappeared?” She hesitated for a moment before adding, “Harry, you don’t think Draco might have done something stupid for fear of being imprisoned? He’s not in danger of… hurting himself, is he?”
“What are you cooking?” Harry said trying very hard to control his breathing and to behave normally. “Smells delicious.”
Then he opened the door to the kitchen. “I’m just preparing breakfast – and you must join us, Harry!”
“As a date?” Harry’s heart skipped a beat. That question came rather surprisingly after all of Draco’s concerns.
Harry avoided her eyes and shrugged. “Well, I guess it depends on what he has done… let’s find out, shall we?” He nodded towards the staff table where Cass was having a heated discussion with the Headmistress and Kingsley Shacklebolt. Ginny stood right behind Cass, her hand on her girl-friend’s shoulder.
While O’Malley still admired the view, Harry kept his eyes on the painting –mainly to avoid Draco’s– when it suddenly hit him. Yes!
“My name is Sylvia Silver and I used to be Sir Lodovicus Malfoy’s favourite model …” her blush increased some more and she added nearly inaudibly, “and his mistress.”
“I’m so sorry,” he said. “I truly am! I should have stopped fighting Draco! I should have protected him instead. I was just… totally clueless! Stupid! I should have –“
“That’s just… disgusting,” Draco said with distain. “This is an all-time low even for your standards, Zabini.”
“Forget about Josh! I might have had a little crush on him when we first met, but… I don’t want perfect,” Harry said feeling bold, “I want you. Your past doesn’t change that.”
Daisy giggled, “That is so funny! Draco knows you really well, Harry, he predicted, you would ask me about his reading! But I promised not to tell and Imagics always keep their promises. I’m reading
“Now you’re talking, pal!” Ron grinned. “Breakfast first it is and then… well, I’m certainly comfortable on a broom and I’d very much like to come with you, Harry – while my brilliant girlfriend talks shop with Professor Flitwick.”
“Merlin, where on earth did you find that cup? Oh, I see… at the Black Townhouse most likely. Oh. Forgive me for calling the house by its old name… I am just used to it… I should probably call it the Potter House…” Narcissa’s voice trailed off. It was more obvious than ever, that she was insecure and quite at loss how to behave naturally in front of her visitors.
“We’ve all been there,” Ginny grinned, “tell you what, since we are going to attend the same classes, we could sit together, if you want? I’ll back you up and you’ll be just fine.”
“Fine,” Hermione said, “I agree with Ron, we should concentrate on the new teachers, get to know them better, find out about their background. How about each of us focuses on one of them? I volunteer to endear myself to Tharros, as both of you seem to be frightened of her.”
“Ah, Professor,” Harry called after Flitwick, “you’ll find the front door locked – I’ve sealed the main entrance… just a precaution.”
Draco’s voice was much softer and somewhat defensive. “Believe it or not, Blaise, I regard privacy very highly – mine as well as others. And someone’s sexual orientation is nothing to gossip about.”
“I’m afraid the explanation is simple – if disappointing,” Hermione said, “it is rather difficult to transcribe names to ancient runes. Runes work like hieroglyphs, not like our letters. So if you want to write a name, you need to be very careful to get it right. I assume, Dumbledore just didn’t have the right runes available on the curtain. As he could only use what was already there, he wanted to avoid giving us a wrong lead.”
“Of course not!” Harry said with feeling, “Draco warned both me and Blaise because we’re on the swim team.”
Hermione pointed at the Muggle Study teacher’s picture. “Gregory Laddley has indeed been working for the same department as your dad, Ron, but not at the London office. He has been a Muggles Liaison officer stationed under cover at the United Nations for several years.”
“Apparently Ms Malfoy thinks it’s some kind of ancient magic, you know, something about being closely related to that ghastly woman in the portrait. As Ms Malfoy was born into the Black family she thinks she will be able to remove it.” Harry said.
Daisy narrowed her eyes. She took Ariana’s hand and turned to her new found friend. “I think I’ll call my pet now, Ariana. He might look a bit grim but he won’t hurt you, I promise – so don’t be frightened!”
He had to ask Hermione’s opinion on the collection of course. Maybe she had already been through some of the books last autumn, when they were staying at No 12 for a few weeks? Harry could not even remember whether they had been in this room at that time? Probably not, as the door to the library was right beside the now empty spot, where Walburga Black’s portrait used to be. As long as it had been on display, there would have been no chance of getting into the library without her wailing like a fire engine.
Aberforth stepped up to their table and slapped Harry’s back. “What’s this about Harry being scared? Don’t pull my leg, Seamus! Tadhg might seem a bit rude but he sure knows how to deal with my regular customers!” he said with a nod towards the bartender. “Good to have you back at Hogwarts! I hear you might come to the village more often this year? Well, you know where to find me – the Hog’s Head will always be happy to serve you!”
“Well…” Harry said, hesitantly finding his words, “that’s not what I thought back then… I had the impression… I might have imagined that you and Ginny… the three of you always sticking together…
Laddley verified Taurus Malfoy’s fake identity as Tadgh the barkeeper and confessed to his complicity. His regular visits to the pub – before and after every trip to St. Mungo’s – had given them plenty of opportunity to make arrangements. Taurus Malfoy had supplied Laddley with Polyjuice Potion, apparently he had nicked some of his nephew’s personal belongings from the Manor including a brush. And he told Laddley to impersonate Draco on several occasions, one of them was the abduction of Albus Dumbledore’s Imagic.
Harry did as he was told and suddenly new information appeared on the board, squeezing in between the previous writing. There were even some facts Harry had not been consciously aware of, such as the date of Mrs Malfoy’s visit to his house which was Monday the 24th of August. And he had even managed to place a picture onto the board, showing a wizard he had never laid eyes on before! The man was very pale and had ash blonde hair, his forehead was unusually high and he had a piercing stare. Harry was quite certain, they had never met, but he still looked familiar.
Neville took charge of his group and tried to make the Gryffindors go upstairs, which raised much complaint. Gryffindors never wanted to leave the centre of any battle and to be shipped off to safety when facing a problem was an insult to them. Harry could understand their protests well enough.
Cass reappeared. She looked rather flushed and put the place mat she was holding onto the empty spot at the table between Draco’s and Ginny’s place.
Harry nodded. He felt deeply uncomfortable about Josh’s further enquiries of the interaction between tracking spell and Polyjuice Potion… Kingsley needed to know and it better be Josh who delivered the message or the young Auror might be in even more trouble.
He walked to the front of the room and addressed the class at large, “Cats, dogs and horses are the most usual shapes of Patronuses, mine’s a black stallion for example. These animals are probably common because many of us are familiar with them. And luckily –in terms of Ms Abbott’s problem– we are also familiar with their ways of giving noise.”
The building was the size of a cottage, but with all the features of a villa – bay windows and even a tiny balcony. Its front was painted a soft pink hue and the roof shimmered of copper.
“Yes, it’s fresh from the oven, still hot. I’m a bit picky with my bread, that’s why I always bake on Saturday mornings.” Odie took a seat next to Harry and refilled both their cups.
“No, thank Merlin, they don’t!” Draco said under his breath and dropped the cloak. He stepped down from an old school-broom and started waving his wand while murmuring incantations.
He kept his eyes closed and let his head fall to his breast – but mere seconds later a forceful wet-rag-hex took him by surprise. Harry felt like being slapped with a dripping piece of cleaning cloth, he gasped and opened his eyes.
After a moment of awkward silence Ron blurted, “Blimey, you’ve got yourself an awfully nice companion, Professor!”
“Not at all, Mr Malfoy, quite the contrary. Please remove your robes and join me at the front–  thank you.”
Harry was pleased to see that Draco laughed as heartily as the others. Still, Draco did not look at Harry again. Not like minutes before. Harry’s insides did a funny little twist when he recalled that moment, just before Flitwick had given his speech.
Partly to change topic, and partly because he wanted Draco to confirm his feelings for Ginny he added, “You should be proud of your cousin, by the way. Her speech yesterday was really awesome! She’s such a great addition to our school, I really like her a lot.”
Harry thought, not that he had ever believed Josh to be involved. Ron gave Harry a questioning look – apparently Ron guessed that Josh must have told Harry all about his dismissal this morning already.
“Harry, pal, you know you can trust us beyond any doubt, don’t you?” Ron went on, “And you don’t have to do this alone, rescuing your darling…” He elbowed Harry playfully. “If that’s what you have to do, we’re rooting for you, me and Hermione. She’s told me to say that much.”
“Good,” Harry smiled, “otherwise I would be very disappointed. You’ll see for yourself why I want you to do this. Trust me, ok?”
Meanwhile they had passed the main entrance of the castle and were heading for the dungeons as today's first lesson was Potions.
“Shush, Mr Dumbledore! No talking! And don’t you dare address a Healer without proper respect, do you hear me?” She put her hands on her hips. “Or I might suppose you’re not just recovering from injuries but losing your marbles as well!” She looked quite annoyed.
Ron gave his sister a stern look, “Care to share your feelings with your brother? Honestly, I’d feel less like an idiot, if you had told me about this –“ he pointed at their interlaced fingers, “instead of getting the news yesterday evening like the rest of the school.”
The Imagic’s raised an eye brow. “I can assure you Miss Daisy is perfectly fine. She’s presently at Bellevue Beach.
“That’s what we want to find out, Harry,” McGonagall said, “and as some of my predecessors insisted you might be able to help, I finally agreed to draw you into this mess, crime or mystery – whatever it is.” She sighed. “Still I am very reluctant to keep you from your studies, as I feel you more than deserve a final school year without being bothered once again.”
Harry was astounded. Draco could play the piano? He had heard music coming from the common room some evenings but hadn’t bothered to find out who was playing. Draco’s talents seemed countless.
“No, I am not. But still… she had to pay the price for her choices anyway. And I am not talking about Lucius being imprisoned,” she hesitated for a moment before going on, “Considering Lucius’ feelings for women this was under no circumstances ever going to be a happy marriage.”
On and on the stags galloped around the lawn waving a pattern of silvery sparks into the frosty grass, until they finally seemed to tire. They slowed down and trotted side by side towards their masters until the silvery shapes stopped just a few feet in front of Harry and Draco. Their antlers touched once again, but this was no longer a fight, this was a caress and the sparks flew higher and more brilliant than before… and then, perfectly synchronous they turned away and trotted side by side towards the forbidden forest. Only when their shapes reached the edge of the forest did they dissolve into thin air.
Harry gawped at her. “I had no idea about that! And Draco is quite right, I am presently collecting information about Magical Arts, so any insight you can give me is much appreciated. But… this is a confidential matter, I cannot tell you why I need to know and I have to ask for your discretion.”
“No worries, Profess… sorry, Headmistress,” Harry said, “of course I want to help – even though I have no idea how. Since when is Dumbledore – I mean, his Imagic missing? What have you done so far? Just tell me everything, will you?”
“No, that’s actually a great idea, Andromeda – not awkward at all, quite the contrary!” Harry smiled at her while moving Otto from his left arm to his right – Otto had the habit of squeezing his claws rather tightly when he was excited and the sight of the baby-boy seemed to be very exciting indeed.
“Ms Granger, Mr Weasley – you know the deal. Mr Potter is not supposed to speak or you’re banned from the Hospital Wing faster than you can say ‘
“Well, I’m bi… I guess,” Carter blushed, “haven’t dated a guy yet but… I can well imagine I might someday.”
As soon as Ron closed the door she shouted, “Harry! We might have another lead!” Her expression was very much the same as after exams, slightly dishevelled but very pleased with herself as well.
He shook his head and sighed. “The name ‘Firebird Hex’ was suspicious of course and that is why I asked Daisy to stay at the seaside with him, close to the water until I finished testing its powers. They were never meant to leave before I was convinced that the hex was safe… but then Ariana arrived at Bellevue Beach of all places and Daisy – true Gryffindor girl that she’s been in her time – entered the fray.”
“Let’s not exaggerate,” Severus Snape corrected, ”at the first of September 4047 magical paintings were stored at the Ministry archives and with good planning and joint efforts we have managed to check them all – he’s not there. An Imagic can only visit other magic paintings at the same vicinity or…”
“Bow down, Millie and Floppy, bow down!” Kreacher shouted shoving the other House-elves’ heads to the floor. “For this is Master Harry Potter who has saved us all! Master Harry Potter wants to talk to you although none of you deserves this! Master Harry Potter is the most–”
“So the question remains, Mr Potter,” Snape’s portrait continued, “has Albus Dumbledore ever mentioned any other portrait of himself to you?”
“Watch your tone, Mr Malfoy! And where do you think you’re going?” Josh raised his voice as well, “you’re still a student of my class for the next hour!”
Cass continued, “Shocking, isn’t it? But trust me, I don’t exaggerate. As for Taurus’ reason for staying put at the Manor, well, he did not want to let go of the arts collection – he experimented with old paintings, examined their magic and created his own. Meanwhile Uncle Lucius relished in supressing Taurus and made his brother’s life as difficult as possible. Lucius is so full of himself, all arrogance and smugness. His homosexuality was nothing he was ever ashamed of– which would be a good thing, if it were not rooted in his huge dislike of women and anything feminine. He truly believes gay wizards are superior beings. Poor Aunt Cissy.”
The next door opened and Blaise interrupted, “Shush, Potter-squad! It’s not even seven and I need my beauty sleep! Go save Malfoy, but quietly please!”
a member of our crazy bunch anyway, right? No, what got me thinking was the way you and Ginny behaved. You seemed such good friends but… there wasn’t much passion going on, right? Don’t get me wrong, I think it is very important to be good friends with one’s partner, but such a young couple should be more than that – and you were not, right?”
Ron seemed only a little bit embarrassed, but mostly delighted by his friend’s praise of his mother. “I have to admit the old girl is doing quite well.” He turned to Harry. “I guess, we can swap seats again next lesson.” He had asked Harry to switch places during D.A.D.A. lessons and Harry had gladly agreed. Sitting next to Hermione up front was far better than the constant reminder of Draco’s absence by staring at the empty chair next to Blaise.
“We have to get you out of here, and fast,” Harry murmured close to Draco’s ear, “trust me… I’ll explain everything as soon as we can’t be overheard.”
Pondering the consequences of having a brainy partner Harry’s mind wandered to Draco of course. How was Draco coping in hiding? What did he do all day long? Was he bored? And most importantly – did he miss Harry?
Harry was totally confused. What had that been about? Just seconds ago he had felt really close to Draco, hardly managed to breathe – and in the next moment, Draco stormed off with a biting remark. He sighed and headed for the Guest House to drop off his books and change for swimming. At least one question had been answered, a question that had bothered Harry for some time now: Draco definitely knew that Harry was gay. Why else had he warned Harry about Laddley?
“Well I… Josh… it doesn’t matter anyway ‘cause he’s a teacher,” Harry said weakly. “But about being straight? Not really.”
“That’s brilliant, Josh! Now we have proof that someone out there regularly disguised himself as Draco!”
This was the fourth day without a message from Draco, which was probably a good thing. Hopefully Draco just laid low until he got an all clear. But what if Draco had already left his refuge and fallen into Taurus Malfoy’s hands? Would they even know about it? Or would it be like this forever – Draco gone without a trace? Harry managed to gulp down a few bites before he pushed his plate away.
There was so much feeling in his voice that Harry’s heart beat faster and his eyes searched Draco’s flushed face.
“To all of you – as soon as you are back at your houses, send me a Patronus to confirm that you’re safe. Same goes for any complication – I want to know about anything even slightly worrying. Understood?” They all murmured their agreement.
Maybe to cry once in a while was not so bad after all? At least that’s what the Mental Healer had suggested whom Harry had been forced to see for some weeks after the Battle of Hogwarts. What was his name again? Harry tried to remember. Something Irish…
“Everything’s fine, we’re all glad Tommy’s back in the pool,” Harry grinned at the boys and took a seat.
When the House-elves repeated their statement in front of Flitwick, the deputy Headmaster immediately contacted Kingsley Shacklebolt. After a quick consultation with the probation office it was confirmed, that Draco’s whereabouts for the first of September was well recorded for. Josh Jordan and another Auror had been at Philomella Black’s house in Edinburgh for most of that day preparing Draco’s and Cass’ transfer to the Manor. On that occasion Josh had once again seen the nasty side-effects of the tracking spell on Draco’s health.
And now this weird dream had ruined his mood. Harry sighed and tried to concentrate on last evening’s pleasant events instead… so Draco was gay, he had smiled at Harry and agreed to talk about… well, them.
Ginny and Cass shared Harry’s preferred early morning sofa. They pretended to read but mostly giggled and whispered to each other. Very few younger students had access to the Guest House because they were related to eighth-years. Luna claimed to be a distant cousin of Neville's - 'seventh cousin six times removed' she had said, whatever that meant. Harry strongly suspected she wanted to spend time with Dean and not Neville. And Ginny and Cass were officially visiting Ron and Draco, although they mostly came to avoid the noise of the overcrowded Gryffindor common room. Ron was of course nowhere to be seen – he was in all likelihood snogging Hermione in the privacy of their shared rooms. Draco on the other hand was present, but seemed totally absorbed in a book once again.
Harry’s heart sank. He reached for Hermione’s hand – and realized heavy bandages around his fingers. “Draco?” He whispered urgently.
to agree with our values and principles without actually sharing them, this will not do. I need to trust my staff and I cannot trust you, if I know you to be prejudiced and ignorant about essential human rights. Because this is at the core of the matter – the belief humans are equals no matter what. Whether Muggle, Witchard or Squib, whether female, male or any other gender, whether black, white or any other skin colour, whether heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual… just everyone.”
Well, Harry had told Cass weeks ago that she could tell Draco about it, so it was to be expected. But still… at each of their early morning encounters Harry had been waiting for Draco’s comment, for being teased about it or any kind of confirmation the message had been received. Maybe it simply didn’t matter to Draco that much? Harry compared Draco’s silence to Tommy’s excited reaction. Straight people probably didn’t find this news as interesting as other queers, he concluded.
Cass laughed. “You are quite right, he has more important duties. That’s exactly why he will stay at school – he’s the new D.A.D.A. teacher, don’t you know?”
“Yeah, now you’re shocked, aren’t you? I’ve had casual sex with a number of guys. I wish I hadn’t. I wish I had never tried to live like my father but I did… at least for a while.”
Cass turned to her cousin shouting, “Everything alright, Dray? Or shall I go kick your probation officer’s sexy bottom?”
Still in his dressing gown Draco opened the door. His eyes went wide when he saw Harry. Oh Merlin, how Harry had missed Draco’s early morning looks, hair a bit ruffled, face flushed and less on guard than at any other time.
Standing at the side of the dance-floor, watching Draco dance with Hermione, Harry marvelled again at Draco’s graceful movements. His posture was so elegant and he did not seem to be exhausted one bit.
Then she addressed Hermione and Ron. “Five minutes – do you hear me? So you better give him a summary, not the long story!” She turned away tending to a kid two beds further down the room muttering something like “… no idea what’s good for him…”
“Thank you for telling me Daisy, I will be there on time,” Harry answered. That would be Kingsley coming to investigate, he assumed. To change the topic he asked, “By the way – are you enjoying your book? And did Draco tell you what he is reading?”
He finally let go of Harry’s wrist, which still buzzed with the imprint of his touch. Harry rubbed at the skin where Josh’s fingers had been just seconds before and wondered why his pulse had quickened?
Harry cleared his desk with a quick spell and placed the ancient volume on top. Then he took the tiny brush, stepped away from the desk as far as possible and opened the book carefully with the tip of the brush.
“McGonagall wants us to keep our eyes open, watch the teachers and report anything dubious. Meanwhile she’ll make some enquiries at the Ministry. She’ll try to find out who had access to the Ministry archives in August – apparently the head of the archives is an old friend of hers and she hopes to obtain the visitor records without having to disclose what’s going on. The idea is to pretend we don’t know yet, that Dumbledore’s Imagic is missing in order to lull the perpetrator. She went to London right after talking to me.”
,” Hermione beamed at him. “Very clever! Malfoy owls are a special breed famous for secret messaging – I should have thought of that. Of course it must have been Draco’s idea to give you one of their owls last summer. Looks like he really was courting you even before you knew it.”
Draco froze for a moment. It was their first deliberate physical contact since the night of the Battle, when they had been huddled close on Harry’s broom, taking a flight from the burning Room of Requirements. When Draco finally squeezed back, Harry felt a shiver of excitement running through his body.
“No bother at all. Andromeda said you usually have lunch together before she darts off. Plus I want to have lunch myself before I get back to work in about half an hour or so – then Teddy is all yours.”
How was Draco supposed to enter, if she watched Harry’s room that closely? Harry remembered the Aurors standing at the castle’s main entrance and at the front of the guest house well enough... would Draco be able to pass any door at all? The cloak did not allow him to walk through walls after all!
Josh grinned. “Yeah? Thanks, Harry… you know what’s funny? I wasn’t too keen on taking this position in the first place but then I really enjoyed teaching! I’m gonna miss my classes.” He shook his head.
Harry just nodded and Tommy said, “It’s ok. I don’t think he’ll accept your offer anyway– he’s so full of hatred…”
“Of course!” Harry secretly hoped that the girl’s abilities to draw were better than his own – otherwise the result wouldn’t be of much help. “You’ve got everything you need? Pencils and paper? Or shall I ask Professor Flitwick to provide stuff?”
Hermione smiled and said, “You have been snoring for some time, but don’t worry, it was highly entertaining.”
“As far as I know? Violating your probation, abducting Imagics, destroying Hogwarts’ security system,” Harry said with a stern face. “I know you’re innocent and I’ll prove it, but until then you have to hide.”
“Not at all, Minerva,” said the Imagic, “I’d be delighted, my feet are numb already.” He turned to a bench where he had dropped his robes, socks and shoes.
“Look!” Harry pointed at Luna and Dean with a laugh. Luna had combined an elegant yellow dress with a big bushy beard of Dumbledore-ish proportions, whereas Dean was wearing traditional dress robes with golden high-heels. Harry marvelled at Dean’s ability to walk in these shoes.
“Good evening, Professor,” he said, “I just promised to come again soon. It’s really nice to be back.” He smiled at her and was rewarded with a miniature smile in return.
“He sure looks very… impressive,” Harry finally managed to say. “I trust it must be very reassuring to have him around.” The bird flapped his huge wings a few times and immediately a storm hit the painting, leaves and branches danced in the wind and Daisy’s strawberry blond locks and her white skirts were in dishevel.
Shouts again from the students’ tables interrupted the Headmistress before she went on, “Yes, we now have an indoor pool of truly Olympic measures. But only students who are at least 17 years old may use the pool any time – all of the younger students must take swimming lessons, before they have access to the pool area. Without exceptions!”
“Yeah, maybe not. But it’ll be awkward to perform magic in front of a crowd of people watching – I’m afraid I’ll make a fool of myself.” Cass sighed.
“Now that I have met Cassy, I finally understand the connection between you and Ginny – obviously you’ve got the same taste!” She winked at him. “Seriously, the two of you reminded me of a pair of schoolmates from my days at Hogwarts. They were very good friends and everybody agreed they made a nice couple, they even got married! But when they were in their mid-twenties they got a divorce and both of them came out.”
Well, it would certainly take some time to get used to that but he quite liked the idea of being on such friendly terms with Draco’s mother.
“Oh well, if you insist…” Draco drew a sharp breath and for a split second he looked right into Harry’s eyes before he lowered his gaze to Harry’s chest. ”I apologize for my manners. And I thoroughly thank you for your testimony at the trial, Potter.”
Harry was very glad that Ron was present – at least someone to exchange an eye-roll with once in a while.
“… I’d also be content,” Draco finished Harry’s sentence with a lopsided grin, “Sorry, Potter, can’t help it – I actually approve of what you say.”
She shook her head. “The last message I received from my son was a letter delivered by owl the day he left Hogwarts. He told me about going into hiding and –” she gave a sarcastic little laugh. “ – ‘
“And what is more – without solid proof the Ministry won’t permit cracking the law firm, hence the A.D. might not be able to catch Taurus Malfoy,” Hermione added.
“– exactly. The only member of staff who leaves Hogwarts regularly on weekends is Professor Laddley –to visit his brother, who’s apparently unwell– but we’ve asked him to postpone this week’s visit and he agreed. First he was a bit annoyed but in the end he gave in. Anyway, no painting has left the premises since the Imagics went missing, we are quite certain of that. And we keep watching all the exits of the castle with great care. Therefore Headmistresses Da Ponte and Darknight must still be in some painting at the castle and will be able to come back.”
“What are you even talking about? I’ve done nothing wrong! At least not since after the war… so I have nothing to fear, right? If the Aurors think they have evidence against me, they must have made a mistake and I simply have to sort this out!”
He cleared his voice, ”Well, I woke up earlier than usual… by the way, your tea is ready.” He pointed at the kitchen counter.
“Right.” McGonagall cleared her voice. “I apologize. Maybe we need to start all over again. Let us sit down, shall we? If you don’t mind, Severus?”
“What? No!” Harry shouted, “That’s just… Snape’s Imagic just had to tell me something… which I can’t tell you, it’s confidential… “ He was furious at himself, about his nonsensical stuttering and about another fucking flush creeping up from his neck. Draco sodding Malfoy’s flushes really were contagious after all!
So the other Draco, the one who had stared at Harry wide-eyed just before Pinkie arrived, that must have been a polyjuiced Aberforth, he concluded. What else did he need to know? With a sudden jolt of panic Harry remembered his wand, lying in front of his bound feet, when Taurus reached for the invisibility cloak.
Harry was dumbfounded. What was he supposed to do now? Dance with Draco Malfoy or run away screaming?
The villain shook his head. “Again, not interested any more. If I get what I want, there’s no need to flee the country, no need at all.” He grinned with such confidence that Harry’s hope sank. Whatever that crazy bastard had in mind, he seemed to be damn sure of it.
“Ah – yes. Sorry.” Harry felt like an idiot. “Of course I will support her, I’ll be glad to get to know her and make sure nobody gives her sh–... sorry, nobody gives her a hard time at school.” Then he asked, “Why is she suddenly allowed to join anyway? Don’t get me wrong, I am really happy for her, but what does her father say about it?“
“How come you didn’t attend school up until now?” Hermione asked, “I thought it’s compulsory for all kids with magical abilities?”
Josh grinned. “Really? You don’t? Well I think, I might have a pretty good idea…” They watched Draco leaving the pool area and Josh added, “But he certainly has a point. I shouldn’t call you Harry, at least not in front of others. Your fan-club won’t like it either.” he nodded towards the small group of runners who stared at them.
“Yes, the sword of Gryffindor too could destroy Imagics – how come you know that?” Flitwick was astonished.
“Hush, Pinkie,” Daisy said straightening her dress, “don’t be naughty, calm down,” and the beast obeyed.
“Don’t worry about that, Ms Malfoy,” Harry said, “I won’t gossip. I know all too well how dreadful it is, to be talked about behind one’s back.”
“Cassiopeia will join the seventh-year students. She was granted special permission to sit for her O.W.L. at the Ministry of Magic just last week and as she passed with rather good grades, she should have no trouble with sixth-year’s lessons. You have to know, Mr Potter,” she went on, ”Cassy is rather talented and very ambitious. She took her magical education into her own hands. While going to Muggle school, she worked through all of the textbooks from Hogwarts year after year – at least Dumbledore made sure she got every item from the reading list. And she also got help with her studies: To Lucius’ annoyance Draco insisted in spending part of every holiday in Edinburgh, to pass on what he himself had just been taught. Also Philomella, who is a retired Healer, and sometimes even Professor McGonagall tutored her. Philomella became like a parent to Cassiopeia…” Narcissa Malfoy said with great compassion, “whereas I did very little to help her – up until now. And I regret it very much.”
“We have not yet decided on a theme for our Halloween celebration – we wanted to hear your ideas first. If you have a suggestion for the ball’s motto, write it on a slip of parchment with your name on it and put it into this pumpkin –“ Flitwick pointed to a huge pumpkin with a lid like a post box sitting in front of the teacher’s table. “– within the course of one week.
At least the Imagic enquiries made some progress – thanks to Hermione’s new status as chief investigator of ancient literature. Saturday afternoon Harry spent some more hours at the Headmistress’ office following the latest leads. McGonagall promptly enquired after the Ollivander copy of C.O.M.A. and received the information that the book was indeed stored at the Ministry. Same as the original book of Hogwarts, it had not been checked out for years – in fact nobody at all had looked at it since the Ollivander collection had been donated to the Ministry. Kingsley Shacklebolt had instructed Ms Malfoy’s present probation officer to search discretely for the second copy and he expected to get results within a few days.
“Do we really have to behave like... this? I mean, aren’t we a bit too old for- for fighting like school-boys?”
Hermione grinned. “Actually that’s very much how he behaved … he recited suggestive limericks for a while – it was quite funny. Even McGonagall chuckled.”
“How did you manage? Did you find the Room of Requirements? And how the fuck did you succeed in passing the entrance of both castle and guest house unspotted?”
“Kreacher fetched the nasty book, just as Master Harry Potter told him to,” the House-elf said with a deep bow and handed the ancient Cyclopedia of Mean Arts from the Black library to Harry.
“Oh. ‘Morning – Harry, Ron,” he grumbled, “the pub’s closed until lunch-time… what brings you here so early?”
“I don’t even want to dignify that nonsense with a response, but just to make sure: Ron, you’re so sloppy, you would make the worst house-husband ever.” Harry smirked at his best mate and was relieved when he grinned back. “And you know well enough, I need you to work with me, right? Do you honestly think I’m interested in going through that training alone? It’s supposed to be way tougher than Hogwarts! I don’t think I have a chance all by myself.”
“Oh no, this is so inconvenient…” Harry groaned awaking one Friday morning with a disturbingly clear memory of yet another Josh-Jordan-themed dream – and a sizeable erection. Obviously he was having a crush on Josh. And not quite as innocent as the crush little Ron used to have years ago.
Aberforth laughed and said, “Don’t worry – Snow White is one of my goats.” And with a final nod he followed Hagrid.
“Well, our parents ordered it, although at that time it was already pretty obvious she would never get married. And I kept the cup after her death, same as the portrait. It was a relief to have at least two keepsakes from her… it used to stand right here, on the mantelpiece of the fireplace. But it is gone. It went missing when the Death Eaters raided the inn. I searched for it in the ruins, believe me, I’ve searched for days. It is lost.”
“After the introduction of our new teachers every member of staff will explain, what kind of physical exercise they intend to offer. In October you can try different classes, but must make up your mind until the end of the month. You can take two different courses or the same one twice a week, but you will practice what you have chosen until Christmas. After the holidays you can switch to different sports.”
To Harry’s surprise Draco blushed violently and turned away. The other guys wolf whistled and started to pester Luna, whom she was talking about, but Luna just smiled in her sweet innocent way.
Draco paused a moment before he continued, “Cass said, she told you about the pure-blood way of being gay? Fuck whomever you fancy but never ever get close to anyone?” He glanced at Harry but quickly turned away when their eyes met. “Appalled, are you?”
Silence. Harry stared at the empty chair in front of him. He hardly comprehended what had just happened. Not only had Draco more or less declared his feelings for Harry in public, he had even admitted to being in love with Harry for two years! And in spite of that he refused to get involved with Harry, had turned him down for absurd reasons.
Harry cleared his voice, “Well, she doesn’t. That’s why I wanted to talk to you first… Hermione… she just summoned the book so we don’t know where exactly the book was stored but–”
Soon enough Harry saw the lights of Hogsmeade from afar. He decided to make it quick and fly right into the hamlet, which was considered very rude. But nobody could see him anyway under his cloak and it was so much faster than walking. He swept between rooftops towards the Hogshead Inn, avoiding the smoke that rose from the chimneys.
“It’s physical exercise, work-out, any kind of Muggle sports,” Cass explained stirring her porridge. “You never had anything like that before, right?”
“Listen, Daisy and Ariana, I have an idea!” Harry said urgently, “how about I put in a good word for you, talk to Aberforth, find a solution so Ariana can stay – and in return Ariana tells me where her Filia Cup has gone?”
He was also curious about Arthur Weasley’s afternoon visit to Hogsmeade. Arthur had tried to talk some sense into Aberforth. Since Laddley’s breakdown, Albus Dumbledore’s brother had been interviewed by both Headmistress and Headauror without success. He continued to flat out refuse to tell Laddley’s story, even when threatened to be taken into custody. Harry had to give him credit for steadfastly keeping the promise he had made to his friend. Maybe Arthur, who got along well with Aberforth, had been able to obtain the truth?
“Of course she does, Harry!” Daisy giggled again. “Why wouldn’t she? We’re friends and that’s what friends do, right? I know she doesn’t like to talk to real people, she’s a bit shy, but we often chat all night. We’ve both been lonely before and now… Ariana doesn’t want to go back to the pub, Harry, and the Headmistress promised to ask her brother about it. We so much hope that she’s allowed to stay permanently, just like the naked… I mean, just like Ms Silver.”
Harry was anything but in a festive mood this evening. At lunchtime he had barely been able to look at Draco. Last night’s concern about Ginny and Draco’s evolving attachment seemed ridiculous compared to the present threat. If Draco was framed by someone for any sort of crime, he would lose his probation and be sent to Azkaban, a prison that had destroyed much stronger characters. The thought alone made Harry feel sick. And he totally refused to believe, Draco might actually be involved in this foul play.
Harry gulped down the bile that had risen to his throat. He closed the door quietly without locking up and leaned against the wall of the corridor. He felt stunned. Knowing that something was about to happen sooner or later was one thing. But laying eyes on it without warning was something else entirely. His heart beat frantically and his mind was strangely empty. He had no idea what to do next. Should he go back to his room? Suffer in splendid isolation? Self-pity had been a close companion during his fifth year at Hogwarts – he had no intention of renewing that unpleasant relationship.
“Good evening students,” cried Flitwick in his high pitched voice, “I hope you are all in good spirits and enjoy your weekend. As Headmistress McGonagall has urgent business in London to attend to, she asked me to address you on her behalf. First of all we are delighted that the new sports courses are a success and many students take the opportunity to try different sports – that is just what we had hoped for.
McGonagall turned towards the students. “Well, this went rather well. I assume you would have preferred me to give him notice him right away? Trust me – that would just enable him to feel like a victim and we cannot want that. Now the decision is his to make… and we have time to prepare, should he decide to leave.” She gave Harry a meaningful look and he knew exactly what she was hinting at. If Laddley decided on leaving, they would need to make sure no painting containing an Imagic was removed from the premises with him.
“May I remind you, Mr Potter,” Flitwick explained, ”that Headmaster Dumbledore’s Imagic went amiss at the Ministry, not at Hogwarts, which makes all the difference! In all likelihood he was lured to another painting at the Ministry Archives and someone removed that painting to a place yet unknown. Therefore he cannot return because he’s in the wrong vicinity. To get back into his very own portrait from afar, he would have to be in another portrait of himself, not just in any kind of painting. And as far as we know, there is no other portrait of Albus Dumbledore, than the empty one. The missing Headmistresses on the other hand must still be at Hogwarts. No student or member of staff has left the grounds since they went missing –“
Just moments later, Dean declared he wanted to fetch some sweets at Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop, sweets by the odd name 'Teeth Twitchies'.
When Harry was walking towards the cottage from the nearest apparition point half an hour later his hair was wet and he could still smell the sick on himself. Hopefully this was just his nose playing tricks on him. At least Otto had not shown any signs of disgust and owls were supposed to be of delicate sense of smell. The owl had arrived at No 12 late in the morning after an intensive night of long distance training. His pet had been fast asleep when Harry left, so Teddy would have to do without his new-found friend this Friday.
“I’m afraid the Ministry archives’ security system is rather weak, they don’t check wands,” McGonagall said. “Maybe this affair will even be the reason for some improvements long overdue – but of course that would not be helpful for our case. Presently the procedure is simple enough. One walks up to the counter at the entrance and signs the registry, the receptionist merely checks the appearance of the visitor by comparison to a picture from the Ministry’s own files. Kingsley let me have a look at Draco’s file, his picture was taken at the trial and is not very good. Any blonde young person might pass for him. One would not even have to use Polyjuice Potion.”
“Pray, Filius, be kind,” said Headmistress Nightingale’s Imagic, “this young woman has been going through enough lately, don’t you think she deserves to benefit at least a little bit too?”
“I’ve asked the House-elves to prepare tea for us later,” said McGonagall, “but before we indulge, I suggest we talk about the matter at hand.” She turned to face the wall at the back of the room, where three large oil-paintings hung side by side. The vacant space at the far left of the wall must be where the Wizard’s Wood was usually kept, Harry thought.
Ariana had returned to her portrait accompanied by Daisy and both girls were staring wide eyed at the vicious wizard who continued to ridicule them.
“So, what are your plans for today, boys?” Odie asked. “Harry, you have to know, that Frankie and I are going to Glasgow for the weekend, to attend my niece’s wedding. Before you turned up, the idea was that David would stay at home and watch the girls for us – can’t bring along two naughty dogs to a wedding, can you?”
“Not much information to be gained from the crime scene, I’m afraid,” Snape continued, “the Bellevue Beach is as pleasant as ever but a first rough search gave not away what has happened to our two missing colleagues. The only clue I have found so far, is an empty bottle. Professor Flitwick is still examining the object.” He raised his voice to the other Imagics, “Does anybody know about a bottle at Bellevue Beach? I cannot remember seeing it there before. Or is there a bottle amiss in some other painting?”
The Imagic smiled warmly and once again Harry marvelled at her beauty. “Lydia gave me this gown and eventually she brought other ladies to my room as well. I was so happy! It was wonderful to have some company again and most of the ladies were quite relieved to retreat to a place without gentlemen once in a while… Lydia said that there are some really ghastly Imagics around at Malfoy Manor! Anyway – my lady-friends taught me how to play Bridge and I became quite good at it!” she said proudly as her voice became more confident.
“Dearest Aunt Walburga, I took the liberty of bringing along one of my favourite paintings from the Manor, maybe you want to have a look?” Narcissa said.
Harry threw his head back and laughed. It felt so good to be officially dating Draco and not to deny his affection any longer.
“Andromeda asked me to watch Teddy a bit until you’d come – he’s fast asleep by the way. She had an urgent call from the Department of Childcare. Obviously Teddy is considered to be a child with ‘special needs’,” Josh snorted. “I’d rather call it special abilities! But they asked Andromeda to prove she’s fit to raise him – can you believe that? Absolutely ridiculous! Being Tonk’s mum she knows more about Metamorphmagics than all of those stupid legal custodians put together.”
“You are beyond ridiculous! What is wrong with you?” Harry shouted, “I don’t get it! We’re fine for weeks and suddenly you behave as if… as if we were still sixth-years and nothing had ever changed since then! You barely talk to me in the morning or at mealtime and now you’re making up stuff about Jo–… about Professor Jordan – ”
“Nice choice indeed, Mr Potter,” said Draco and his smile was genuine and so warm that Harry’s heart beat faster. “Looks as if you’ve done part of my home-work already.”
Harry did not respond – he simply had no idea what to say. If he kept silent, maybe she would assume he was asleep? He held his breath until she closed the door quietly.
“That is very interesting indeed!” McGonagall raised her eye-brows, “May I ask where precisely in our library Ms Granger found that book? Surely it is not part of the Arts section? Otherwise Filius would be familiar with the hex. Does Madame Pince know about it?”
“Very well,” the Imagic nodded, “I shall see what I can do… maybe I can find a replacement for my present position and make a visit to the Wizards’ Wood tomorrow morning, assuming that at least Mr Malfoy has kept his morning routine.” He paused for a second. “I am quite pleased that you are so concerned… for the investigation, that is.” He smirked.
“Right. Sorry,” Harry said feeling suddenly awkward, “I’m afraid I got a bit carried away… we’ll start with your arm work. Ten laps with paddles, five crawling, five breaststrokes, ok?”
Hearing the House-elf refer to Number Twelve by his own name, Harry was oddly touched and realised that he must indeed have gained Kreacher’s full loyalty.
He opened the door and scanned the room for Ron and Hermione. He really –desperately– needed his best friends right now. Maybe he could even tell them what he had seen? Maybe Ron would be as shocked –if for different reasons– than Harry himself? That would be a small relief at least.
“Headmaster Snape is presently making enquiries at Bellevue Beach, trying to find some clue what might have happened there,” McGonagall explained, “he should be back soon.”
Harry shook his head in disbelief, “So you think somebody tampered with the portrait while it was stored at the archives? In that case he must still be there, in any of the other paintings…”
He desperately needed a distraction and was glad to see Cass and Ginny approaching. They were holding hands and looked radiant with joy.
“Yes,” Ron said rather proudly, “Hermione connected our separate rooms and now we share a sitting room and a bedroom.”
Harry remembered his compassion, when he had found Draco sobbing in that damn bath-room – well, at least until Draco had tried to curse him. He remembered Ron’s and Hermione’s constant complaint about him being obsessed with Draco. Harry had justified his focus by insisting that
When they finally broke apart, Harry cleared his voice. Both of them turned around and stared at Harry. Although their expression was very different – Draco blushed violently and looked upset, while the other grinned widely – their features were very much alike, nearly same height, lean frame and white blonde fringe falling into the forehead. They were even dressed alike in black trousers and white shirts. Harry wondered for a second, if maybe Draco had a secret twin brother?
“Wow, you’ve got a nice pattern, Malfoy, I’ll give you that” Harry said, “though there’s not much courage in your backbone obviously!” He grinned at Draco.
At dinner time Harry grudgingly had to aknowledge – not to think of Draco Malfoy for one whole day was anything but easy. He entered the great hall partly expecting Draco’s place to be empty once more. The sudden sight of another white-blond head next to Cass gave him a jolt of pleasant surprise. Which didn’t mean anything of course.
“Well… we started to talk to each other again on the Floo some time ago,” Andromeda seemed a little bit reluctant to confess to that. “It all started with a note of condolence she sent me after the war… and I had the feeling she meant it. She is… Narcissa is not a bad person, Harry. I am glad you accepted her invitation and before you ask – it was her own idea to invite you, not mine.”
And when Harry argued, that wearing a kilt was not really gender bending, she dispelled his doubts by saying, this were only true for Scotsmen. Lacking other options Harry had tried one on and immediately loved the feeling of scratchy wool on his bare thighs.
. Harry’s heart jumped every time he looked at those words. This confirmation, that Draco’s Patronus still had the shape of a stag, was a declaration of love, if ever there was one.
. And I might add, that as much as it delights me to hear you appreciate my physiognomy, you might save us both some discomfort by keeping your thoughts to yourself.”
“Professor, how about we –“ he gestured at Hermione and Ron, “search Laddley’s room, while you fill in Molly and Arthur?” he asked.
Ron yawned. “Yeah, right… I’m ready to go to bed anyway. Bugger, we’ve got a Transfiguration test tomorrow – be grateful you’re still convalescent, Harry! I’m mighty glad that the affair of the missing Imagic is finally over.”
Harry was surprised about his own reaction, he felt… not much actually. His emotions were on hold but his mind raced: How could he have been so misguided again about a guy he fancied? Why had he fallen for Draco sodding Malfoy of all people in the first place? He wanted to smack himself for being so stupid! Harry was as angry at himself as he was angry at Draco.
“Your wand? What about it? It’s right here, in the drawer of your bed-side table, perfectly intact.” Hermione opened the drawer for him.
“So… you’re not… you know?” Ron stuttered, “Fuck’s sake, I never thought I might even consider this idea one day!” He looked positively shocked by his own thoughts.
“Good evening everybody… Mr Potter,” Laddley was the last one to appear at their table and nodded his greetings.
“Sorry to disappoint, but looks like you’ve got the wrong door, my friend. There’s no Draco in this house.”
And when Harry had thanked him awkwardly, Draco continued with a dismissive gesture, “Just sit down and spare me your pottering around in the kitchen…”
“Oh, that’ll be great fun, watching you two trying to be polite to each other,” Cass seemed to enjoy their mutual discomfort immensely and Harry could not help but feeling a bit of a dumb-ass himself.
Harry entered the common room to put the kettle on – and was surprised by Ron and Hermione, clearly waiting for him, both still wearing pyjamas and night robes.
“Of course not,” Harry said, “but – right now? I mean… we’ve got Potions in about half an hour. Or shall I come afterwards?”
Harry grinned at Ron and nodded. Yes, racing with his best friend had been great fun. They had looped and dived, just like during Quidditch practice and Harry had even forgotten about the dreadful investigation for a few minutes.
Harry need not have worried. The other young owls were obviously rather pleased to have their clown back. There was a lot of hooting and fluttering, but all in a distinctly friendly way, while the adult owls were just watching the spectacle from above. Harry was relieved.
Harry felt deflated. Whom was he trying to fool? There was no denying it – he had allowed himself to be smitten by Draco Malfoy. Brilliant. Harry moaned in frustration.
One hour later Harry was completely and utterly happy. He sat next to Draco, they rested their knees against each other under the table and whenever he looked at Draco he was rewarded with a warm smile – a smile, that was heart throbbing, breath stealing and did very funny things to the rest of his body too.
“Leave him alone. As long as he’s still able to waltz with me once a week, he can sprain his ankles all he likes,” Hermione patted Ron’s knee.
McGonagall snorted, “Headmistress Longbottom has doubts just about everything. If I trusted her judgement, I would not leave my bed in the morning.”
Harry’s heart pounded but he managed to keep his voice steady and tried to appear bored, “Since when do you care for my safety? Anyway this is none of your business, Malfoy.”
“Ah, that’s better. Thank you, Filius. I felt different as long as I was Head of House myself, but now I spend a good deal of my time negotiating the delicate rivalries between houses and that is terribly exhausting! The house structure just feeds a mental concept of ‘
So all in all his coming out to them had gone rather well. A bit awkward but that was to be expected. If Harry wanted to be out and proud, he better got used to awkward moments as there were more to come for sure. Hopefully one day the fact, that Harry Potter, all time hero of the wizarding world, was gay would be common knowledge and nothing remarkable at all.
having tea together, we just happen to…” his voice trailed off while Draco said, “So what if we are? Got a problem with it, Headmaster? In that case your successor shouldn’t have put students from different houses in one dormitory.”
They all ordered Full Magical Breakfasts with tea and as they munched their way through servings of cackling cereal and freaking fried eggs Harry gave his friends a detailed report of yesterday’s events.
Hermione looked concerned. “You realize that Taurus Malfoy made a mistake when he tried to get a hold of Otto, right? He will eventually give himself away. The Aurors are searching every inch of the surroundings and will catch him in the end. Draco just has to stay where he is until they succeed. He is clever enough to stay put at his refuge unless he is told otherwise, I am sure of it.”
The music stopped and all eyes were upon them. Professor Flitwick scuttled towards them from the beginners’ corner.
Both House-elves gawped at Harry wide-eyed. They were most certainly not used to being addressed by a wizard at all, let alone by famous Harry Potter!
Sylvia blushed again. “Actually, Professor, as my painting has been trifled with anyway – would it be possible to get some decent clothes? With only the choice between nakedness and this gown for so many years… it would be such a relief to be dressed properly again. I could meet other people, maybe go for a walk with Pippin…”
“Going with ones best friends is nothing to be ashamed of,” Harry said defensively. “You make it sound as if Ron and Hermione were bad company!”
Now his friends gawped at Cass instead of Harry and she seemed to take the attention much better than him. She shrugged once more, grinned at them and said, “Yep, magic dyke, that’s me and that’s just fine.”
“No, I assure you, Harry, Albus Dumbledore’s Imagic is not making social calls to other paintings. We are quite certain about that.” All the former headmasters and headmistresses nodded looking grave. When McGonagall realized Harry’s confusion she explained, ”The image of a real person in a magic portrait is called an Imagic–“
– for weeks, for months,” Kreacher nodded eagerly, “he brought the book with him, just a few years after Master Regulus…” the House-elf gulped, his huge eyes filled with tears and he even forgot to hiccup.
A sudden knock at the door drew his attention back to present company. The door was shoved aside and two pale faces with identical blonde fringes stared into their compartment, one grinning, one frowning.
Harry rose and smiled. Heart pounding, he said, “Hi Draco!” and made a tentative step – until Draco flung himself at Harry.
Harry was aghast. Why had nobody told him about the Imagics’ power before! It was perfectly clear now, that the whole affair was far more serious than he had assumed it to be.
“But that’s great! I had no idea he’s coming! McGonagall only told me that he finally regained consciousness three days ago. When will he be here? ‘Cause I’d really like to wait for him, if you don’t mind?”
Harry just nodded. He remembered the most pompous snow owl Narcissa Malfoy had sent to him and was afraid, she might offer that horrible bird to him! He was convinced that this owl and himself shared a mutual disliking for each other.
At the very same time Blaise Zabini entered the pool area and boomed, “What’s that? Harry Potter is gay? You’ve finally made it official? Good for you, Harry! Any chance of hooking up with me? In that case I might even consider joining your team.” He laughed and wriggled his eye-brows at Harry. “What a brilliant plot twist, superhero!”
To his surprise Cass was waiting for him all by herself. She was sitting on a window sill and jumped up as soon as she saw him.
"They are coping alright. They still have not forgiven me for the memory charm, but whenever I ask them, what I should have done instead, they are quite at loss. So I guess, they will come around eventually."
“Oh… me too.” said Harry. “Morning person, that is. Well, you will have to share the common room or fuck off to your own bedroom, if you don’t want to see me.”
“My parents were…“ he shook his head and sobbed, “they made the mistake of taking Tim to a Muggle hospital and… the doctors told them that their son had been tortured… and raped, more than once.”
“Do you now?” He laughed before adding in a fake Scottish accent, “Took you long enough, lad!” He pulled dark glasses out of his pocket and grinned at Harry.
Harry felt stunned. Of course McGonagall had said she wanted to find professional help for Laddley… but why in Merlin’s name did she have to hire the very same Mental Healer Harry had been seeing?
“Yes, you most certainly are, my dear,” said Nightingale’s Imagic squeezing her hand. “But go on – tell us about what happened this summer.”
“Actually, I believe you. I have to admit, it was rather impressive to see you walking up to the Dark Lord in the forest, all alone without fighting back, sacrificing yourself for your friends. So you might well refuse to tell me, even if I used the Cruciatus Curse on you. That is why I have something else in mind.” He smirked and Harry’s heart sank. Whatever his opponent had planned, that malicious grin did not bode well.
“Otto was so impatient to visit his family, I had to drop him off at the aviary first thing,” Harry explained.
Harry stared at his friends. “Are you sure? I haven’t time to take another shower and change before dinner!”
Harry sighed. “Right. Until then we have to search without Otto’s help… Draco gave me no clue about his place of hiding but for some reason I suspect he might be in Edinburgh. The Headmistress already asked Cassy’s aunt without result. But by any chance… maybe
“I don’t know, Mr Potter,” Laddley said inertly, “this has been a secret for so many years… very few people knew what happened to Tim, only the Healers of St. Mungo’s and Abe… and suddenly it’s part of an official investigation.” He shook his head and sighed. “But maybe it’s a good thing… I’ll think about it, okay?”
“Well, in that case I better get started,” Narcissa Malfoy said and turned towards the staircase to the entrance hall, followed by Harry and Josh, who had returned the baby to his grandmother.
He realized McGonagall had quit talking to Madam Pince, who rose from her chair and both witches walked towards the eighth-years’ table.
“Because… I’m pretty sure that you trust him… but if you ever start to doubt his intentions, you might want to remember what I said.” Josh sighed. “And I also wanted to tell you what I found out about his trouble with the damn tracker. Maybe this can even help to clear his name.”
And now Harry stood in front of this house, nervous and quite at loss how to proceed. The Aurors waited in the fields outside of the town for his message. As soon as he had spoken to Draco, Harry was supposed to send his Patronus their way, confirming that everything was alright. Josh had it made perfectly clear, that he expected a message within one hour – otherwise they would come searching for Harry and Draco.
“No,” Hermione crossed her arms in front of her chest, “I am sorry to contradict you, Professor, but I don’t think so. First of all, if Draco Malfoy was actually involved in this scam, he would have covered his tracks. Instead we find blunt evidence pointing at him – far too obvious for my taste. Why put the trap painting in his very own room, for example? Hogwarts offers an abundance of storage rooms, secret alcoves and barely used closets. He could have hidden the painting out of sight easily. What is more – why give his ‘real’ name at the Ministry archives? Again, he could have disguised his presence without much effort. Draco is far too clever to make such mistakes.”
Phineas Nigellus Black greeted Harry with a strangled voice, “Good of you to come, Mr Potter, most grateful we are.”
Hermione grinned and Harry flushed. He most certainly did not want to dig into this. “Right. What about Draco Malfoy’s room?“
“Whatever happened to the two of you?” Blaise boomed in is usual blunt way addressing Harry and Draco, when all of them had finished eating eventually. “Are you afraid your motto for the ball will be drawn and everybody finally hears about your most perverted phantasies? I assume Princess Malfoy went for something totally girlish, like ‘
“As Cassiopeia is eighteen years old, her father would no longer be entitled to make decisions for her, even if he were still around. But he was one of the Death Eaters who fled the country as soon as the war was over to avoid trial. I think… I hope, he will never return!” she said with feeling. “Cassy could have already gone to Hogwarts last year as soon as she came of age. But with all what was going on at the school last term, even Minerva McGonagall – a close friend of Philomella’s – advised her against it. So Cassy decided to graduate first at Muggle school and to wait one more year.”
“Sound’s like an exciting career to me,” said Harry. “So why did he accept this position at Hogwarts? Must be a huge down-grade in salary and prestige.”
Crossing his arms in front of his chest Harry raised his voice, “Well, you might think this is none of our business, but there’s an official enquiry going on. You make it sound as if we were just two nosy school-boys! But McGonagall agreed on asking you and – franky, I thought you might prefer to tell us, before the Auror Department decides to interrogate officially.”
“You’ve come!” Draco whispered. “It’s been nearly a month… I’ve started to fear I might never see you again, Mr Potter!”
Flitwick nodded and she stepped behind the easel. After reproducing the incident board, she continued to mutter incantations for minutes and waved her wand frantically.
“’Takes a natural authority like you,” Ron grinned at Harry, “to get Gryffindors out of harm’s way!”
This one's for those who are going through a difficult time at the moment... and might need to trust in the transformative energy of tears. It'll get better, luv, promise!
“Hi, boys!” she said and slouched onto the carpet, received with an enthusiastic kiss from her lover.
Harry was again amazed at his effect on the crowd. Of course Flitwick backing him up helped but he was still surprised that most of them did exactly as he told them without serious protests and not too much fuss either.
“I’m afraid not,” Snape’s Imagic looked grave, “but I have asked Sir Cadogan to ask around and he reports to me every day, so we might still get lucky.”
Harry sighed. Yes, he had guessed correctly. “Listen, Molly, I know you mean well but Draco is a much better person than we all believed him to be! Ron and Hermione think so as well and – “
“Well, I don’t know how long you can stay, but maybe you could try taking down the portrait first and then we all can have tea together? Andromeda brought an apple tart,” he addressed the young man, “if that’s ok with you, Auror Jordon?”
“Right.” Harry looked pleadingly at Hermione, hoping she would come to his rescue before he messed up this chance.
“What makes you think he will be dismissed?” Kingsley Shacklebolt raised his eye-brows. “I most certainly won’t get rid of one of my best young Aurors because he did something behind my back – which, by the way, I would have permitted him to do, if asked.”
Both Harry and Blaise seized this chance and became training partners. Apart from Draco Malfoy, Zabini was the only eighth-year Slytherin and Harry found the guy to be much improved since sixth-year. When he mentioned as much, Blaise grinned and said, “Yeah, I guess we’ve all grown up a bit… don’t you think, you’ve changed as well?”
“Did he tell me about his attachment to you?” She raised her eye-brows. “Mr Potter, my son did not need to tell me. His feelings for you were no secret to me. He’s been besotted with you for far too long.” She looked at Harry with an unreadable expression and Harry felt deeply embarrassed.
“But what if they do not return? The Headmistresses might have stepped into a hexed painting, making it impossible for them to leave again,” said Harry, “I mean, Dumbledore’s Imagic is obviously unable to come back as well.”
Reluctantly he reentered the Headmistress’ quarters – to find Ron in the focus of everybody’s attention. His best friend had risen from his chair and just stood there shock frozen, white as a sheet and gawping.
“Draco–,” Harry cleared his voice, “I mean, Malfoy said so. It might come in handy to have a Slytherin informant, don’t you think? Anyway he kind of warned me about Laddley, said not to be fooled by him – I think he knows something disadvantageous about Laddley’s past.”
They were standing in front of Harry’s copy of the Magic Board in his bedroom after Sunday dinner. His friends were deeply impressed.
Andromeda came home around four smiling brightly. The issue was settled, she was granted the right to raise Teddy by herself and without interference of any legal guardian.
Hermione was flushed and excited about this offer. She buzzed off as soon as she had cleared her plate muttering, “Have to fetch my books…”
“Last night was very exciting… for Daisy,” Draco said in a low voice, “she talked about it all morning – I’ve… she’s been waiting for you.”
Flitwick sighed with relief, “Thank you, that would be excellent, Mr Potter, excellent indeed. Meanwhile I’ll inform the Headmistress. She’s in her private rooms tonight, entertaining a guest… oh Merlin, this is a disaster! No point in hiding our problem any longer…”
When they climbed the stairs to the seventh floor corridor, Harry hoped with all his heart that Draco might be safe in the Room of Requirement already – or at least stay out of their way. They finally reached the enchanted staircase to McGonagall’s office, she waved her wand and the floppy stairs became solid once more.
“You’re truly fucked, mate,” Ron said with much compassion, “missing pudding for a meeting with your mother-in-law.”
“– well, you won’t, at least not tonight, Mr Grey,” Flitwick said with a stern look at the boy, “and if you keep interrupting me, you won’t dance any other evening either. Let us hope the disappearance of the Fat Lady is nothing to worry about – but maybe it is. In any case I need to inform the Headmistress and therefore have to leave immediately. In my absence Mr Potter is in charge,” Flitwick said and again some Slytherins grumbled but most of the other students accepted Harry’s authority without complaint.
Josh looked amazing, just like a sports model. His trunks and tank-top were fire-fighter red and made his skin glow. He was surrounded by a bunch of guys including Draco Malfoy. The sudden sight of Draco’s pale slender body in nothing but black swimming trunks was quite distracting. Harry gulped and walked towards them, addressing Josh.
