“We can make it seem as if Remus Lupin is the Regent of House Potter, up till Lord Black is given his trial and freed. Luckily, Lord Rings are charmed so that if a Lord wishes them to remain unseen, they shall be invisible to all but the wearer.”
It had black plumage, freckled with white, almost silvery, spots, with a heart-shaped facial disc and round, black eyes. It was smaller than his Hedwig, it looked to be 40cm at least, 50cm at most, whereas Hedwig was 58cm. It was a complete opposite to his Hedwig, dark with light spots, to Hedwig's light with dark spots plumage. It's eyes were the most captivating though; a dark brown, almost black, big, round and widely open, it looked as if it was staring straight at your soul.
Alrod seemed to be thinking the same thing for he said, “Well. It seems Lord Black will need that solicitor immediately.”
"The will reading will commence."
Chapter four is here! Thank you all for the lovely people who really liked this work! And to anyone who has concerns or problems or confusion about this story, tell me and if I don't answer, that means that it will be answered further into the story.
Needless to say, Kreacher cut back on his cutting remarks, apologizing to Harry and listening to his orders quietly. He was asked to clean and maintain the house, to make it befitting of the Black name. Harry remembered that Grimmauld Place was in unstable conditions so he'd ask Alrod or the Black Account Manager for a list of names or services that could help. Kreacher objected—mildly due to the glares of the others—at first but Harry said he wanted the manor to be back to its glorious splendour and that would only be possible if an expert would see to the house. Hearing this, Kreacher reluctantly acquiesced.
Once seated, he turned to Mimsy. "Will you eat with me, Mimsy?" He asked. Mimsy starts at the question and gives him a long look before nodding her head and sitting at the table. Beaming at her, Harry turned to study his food. Pancakes, omelettes, sausages, yoghurt, muffins, and a bowl of assorted fruits. Harry took a bit of each while Mimsy took to the sweet side; pancakes dripped in honey, yoghurt, muffins, and fruits. Harry dutifully drank his potions before he dug in. As he ate, the young lord decided to pack some muffins with him on his shopping trip.
Harry nodded, placing the knowledge in a safe place in his brain. He'll do better next time.
“This, I believe, is only applicable to those that can speak parseltongue and, of course, have magic. Unfortunately, I do not know how one goes about doing parselmagic, however, fortunately, there should be some books and journals about it in the Slytherin Vault. Would it be something you wish to have taken out of the vaults? I am the Potter Account Manager but I am not the Slytherin Account Manager so I will have to confer with her, anyhow, sooner or later,” Alrod says. This made Harry blink.
"The will reading has finished. This gathering is adjourned."
Older Harry never spoke of mansions like Potter Manor and Black Manor, he never spoke of being a Lord and being overly rich, nor did he speak about houses in trees, and various house-elves. Harry thinks that his older counterpart never got to experience what he is now experiencing. He feels bad for his older self, to have never gotten this connection, this inheritance from his father.
Needless to say, Harry could say nothing else. Still, even thru Corvus's petulance and complaints, Harry did not wish to prosecute the headmaster for this (not even including the borderline legal tracking spell). When Corvus asked why not, Harry answered it was because Voldemort was still at large and so, it would not be good for the people to lose faith in the Leader of the Light. Harry, though, still wanted answers and so would get them from the headmaster himself, privately and not in front of a large body of people. There was no need to air their dirty laundry to the whole wizarding world, after all.
“Lord Potter…” Alrod began uncertainly.
on his that Harry politely did not look at it, lest he makes a face and offends the goblin who had helped him so much. Harry took his potions and promptly gagged, making Alrod laugh. Harry blushed and pouted, sulkily tucking in and ignoring Alrod's amused face. Once they were done, they went back to some of the things on Harry’s Inheritance Test and clarified the things there.
Dumbledore beams at him, "Of course, of course! These old bones will surely appreciate it!"
“You can have it opened, Lord Potter, as soon as you gain your lordships.”
"Do you want me to
“Those are nutrient and supplement potions, as well as stomach-soothing potions. Take the first two before each meal, the stomach soother after waking up. Make sure to eat only thirty minutes, no less, after taking the stomach soother or it will have the opposite effect instead, Lord Potter. Among them are bone-strengthening potions to further fix your weak, brittle bones, and another nutrient potion made specifically for them, which you will drink every night,” Gurkrat explained readily, “You will have to drink these potions for the next half-year, Lord Potter, before you can be considered borderline healthy. You can stop the stomach soother after a month and a half at the least, if you never miss a meal and your potions within that time, three months at most if you do any of the aforementioned as well as get sick or injured."
Now I know why he's such a drama queen, with a name like that!
, coldness and darkness like the Peverell ring’s surging but different, cold, like aunt Petunia when she would look at Harry, and dark, like his cupboard when he’d hide from uncle Vernon, the place he was too big to be able to grab Harry from. It made Harry want to be sick and he feared he would before the magic settled, even more, the bad feelings disappearing, though not with the memories it evoked.
While he worked, he grabbed a piece of paper and dropped it by his cupboard, his actions as fluid as water. Anything else would cause attention on him that Harry just didn't need. Harry thinks about when he would write his reply to his letter when Dudley announces that he would be going over to Piers Polkiss' house, aunt Petunia chiming in about getting groceries while he's gone. Uncle Vernon, the 'loving, caring husband that he is,' states that he'll drive her. That only leaves...
It was ten minutes till the will reading when the double doors to Alrod's office opened with a bang. Everyone jumped in their seats, Harry jumping the highest. At the doors was an old man, with long white hair and beard, wearing pink and turquoise robes, accented with bronze embroidery. His breath came out in soft pants as if he had run all the way here. He gave a small smile when he saw everyone there (Severus and Minerva noted it was a bit strained).
Hands grabbed his unyielding, caging them in and away from him. Harry fought the hands restraining him, panic bubbling at his chest that resulted in loud, rasping gasps.
Wearing a new set of shrunken clothes, this time from Moony's closet, provided to him by Mimsy, Harry came back out to see the quiet house-elf placing breakfast on the table. Mimsy nodded at him, using her magic to move the chair back for Harry. He smiled at her in thanks.
Corvus had a bewildered look. Why would Vernon be screaming when he was downstairs and Corvus was all the way upstairs and away from him?
! Not even the Dursleys would mess him up so—well, actually, they would, if they could, and in a way they did but that just means Dumbledore was as bad as the Dursleys!
When accused of messing with the Dursleys, Corvus merely raised a brow and said that if they were messing with Dudley as he said, then Petunia would surely have noticed them go out the front door. She hadn't (because they apparated out) so Corvus cheerfully waved them away, saying they were probably just stressed and how it'd pass as soon as they left come Sunday. The Dursleys didn't really believe them but had no proof to back up their words, so they reluctantly left, only hastening their exit when Corvus narrowed his eyes.
"Goblin magic; it's why it's faster and pricier than normal," Alrod answers readily.
Harry frowns, “Is there no way to fix that?”
'. Turns out, there was some reasoning behind Malfoy's hostility with him. He couldn't imagine how someone as posh as Malfoy reacting even mildly to someone saying that to him, especially since the offering of handshakes weren't that much of a common thing with Lords and Heirs, usually they just bow their heads at each other and only shake hands when an agreement has been reached or an alliance formed.
Alrod stared at the young wizard in front of him, righteously angry but also wound tight, distrusting, and unsure of who to turn to. The goblin shook his head.
“You will know if it rejects you.”
"Master Harry is not setting the table. That be Mimsy's job," Mimsy says firmly, hands on her hips and a pout on her lips. Harry stares at her uncertainly, fiddling with his fingers.
fast, I guess. I didn’t want to believe that the Dursleys were right when they called it
Draco grabbed him by the shoulder and drug him over to the staircase entrance. Where Carraway was due to appear any second.
The bedroom door is cracked, and Harry can see Ron’s back to the opening as he speaks with Bill. Their voices are low and indistinct. Bill smooths at Ron’s shoulder, fixing him with a reassuring smile.
“Alright, Teddy,” Harry says when Draco Disapparates without so much as a spare glance in his direction. “Let’s get moving, hm?”
Harry’s watch beeps at his wrist. Half past four. Malfoy is going to be a pain.
"Sorry?"
Harry watched as Malfoy gathered the unused pieces of hummingbird feathers, butterfly wings, beetle eyes, hornet bodies, and salamander skin. His hands shook, though he seemed otherwise steady.
Draco stops there, sure that the long list of influential witches and wizards that follow is an impressive one. His breath is caught, though, burning his chest as his lungs struggle against the pathetic miscommunications that Draco’s body seems to be having.
“A what?”
“Well, if I thought you’d willingly talk about him, I’d just ask. He’s a huge part of what we’re trying to understand and unravel, but you always freeze at the mention of him, so I’ve had to get creative,
“Did you try out that park?" Draco asks once he’s able to busy himself with the kettle.
"You heard me."
There was a buzzing in Draco's ear then, and the world felt as if it was rising from the oblivion he and Harry had temporarily thrown it into, coming around them and reminding Draco of what exactly he had just done. Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater and outcasted disgrace, had just kissed Harry Potter, the Chosen One and savior of the wizarding world, in front of the entire school. He gulped.
Harry followed Neville's eyes down the table. Towards the end closest to the doors sat Conrad, Maddox, and Cooper, eating a rather subdued breakfast. Harry shook his head as Hermione and Ron joined them.
It's just a shock, really. Brilliant as many people think
"You'll feel better soon, Harry."
At that, Harry openly balks. “What, as if every parent has all this experience with kids before having their own?”
Draco clears his throat. “I’m not mad at
It wasn't as though being a famous war hero was a nightmare in and of itself. No, it was the sheer amount of attention that Harry now drew that was entirely too much. He hadn't much enjoyed being the mysterious enigma that was Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, before the war. But now that he had outright defeated Voldemort...Harry was beyond idolization, it seemed.
They stepped out onto the street and a fierce wind slammed the door closed behind hem, whipping their cloaks into a frenzy. Draco pulled his hand from Potter's in a vain effort to keep himself warm, crossing his arms and bowing his head against the wind.
The melody is slow, an odd weave of sorrowful and amused. And as Harry comes to stand in the doorway, he fights his jaw's instinct to fall.
"Er...what?" Harry asked, thoroughly confused.
"Mm."
"So you attacked him?" Hermione shouted somewhere behind him.
The number of students being Sorted was literally twice as many as usual. Though Sorted, the previous year's number of first years had been drastically diminished, as Voldemort hadn't allowed muggleborns to be permitted, nor were many half-bloods. Due to this, all of the previous year's first years were repeating the Sorting alongside those that hadn't been permitted to attend with them and the current year's actual 11-year-olds.
"Maybe?" Harry stepped closer. "You should've heard the whole pub defending you after you left. I think, if you just listen, you'll find that it's not just me trying to move forward, Draco."
"I'm glad to finally meet you."
"I'm sorry, it's just that you're so young," he said. "What makes you think you know what you like already?"
"Draco?"
“When do you plan to find a larger home? I think a house with a yard, or at the absolute least a larger flat so this child may have his own space to grow, should be your next step.”
The Burrow was rather quiet on the inside, everyone busy enjoying themselves at the reception outside beneath the summer stars.
"She said you'd be sensitive to light...but don't worry about opening your eyes now. The sun's about to go down anyway, then you won't have to worry about it."
But Draco's attacker was far more gentle than they should have been if they were hoping to do him in, and Draco wondered if he was hallucinating when there were two warm hands pressing into his chest, not enough to hurt but enough to ease some of the tension in the strained muscles there.
"Ron, how dare you!" Mrs. Weasley snapped. Her eyes narrowed dangerously. "That is hardly the things to say when someone's been murdered."
"I eat far more than I used to."
Hearing his name in Harry's voice made his heart skip a beat. It sounded foreign but so
He ought to eat, Draco thought as he descended the stairs toward the enchanted wall that would lead to the common room. Despite dinner being the busiest meal of the day, it had already been nearly half an hour since it began and would likely be thinning out by the time Draco actually arrived. He tossed his bag on his bed and made his way back upstairs.
"Malfoy?"
“Wh-” Heat rises in Harry’s face, starting deep in his jaw and flickering like flames straight upward. “I- well, no, I wasn’t
Ron shook his head. "Same principle, mate. I reckon the only reason Malfoy didn't try to blow my brains out at the time was because we were twelve and didn't know how."
"Harry's brows furrowed. "I've never received any mail from Gringotts and I don't have a magical guardian," Harry said confused. Corvus shook his head.
. It's him that would be doing the laundry anyway. And so what if he wouldn't be eating the dinner he cooked? He wouldn't be allowed to eat it anyway.
Harry Potter sits and stares at intricate, ornate boxes. Six boxes are placed on the table in front of him, each with its own designs and symbols. Each box is connected to Harry through the family he has never met, as well as through one man on that fated night.
So it was a quiet and Disillusioned Harry that sat still, watching as a few people walked in, one by one or with pairs. The first one to arrive was a short man, in green robes and with thick white hair. From his sharp, pointed ears, Harry gathered him to be the Charms Professor, Filius Flitwick, who Alrod informed him was half-goblin. He had glanced at his corner at first, which made Harry tense, but immediately his gaze slid over, and went for his seat, bowing at Alrod and giving the customary greeting. Once he was seated, Harry relaxed in his seat.
“May your gold multiply, Lord Potter, and may your enemies cower before you.” Harry jumps at the new phrase but Healer Gurkrat has already left, leaving the young Lord in front of the lard double doors.
Hedwig gave a doubtful look at Corvus, not even paying attention to the black owl, perched on the desk. Corvus simply stood still as the wise, golden eyes of the owl studied him dubious. Seeing the look, Harry merely chuckled.
"Boy! What's taking you so long!? What are you lazing about with the mail for!?" His uncle bellows from the kitchen. Harry exhales then, his tears gone as soon as it came.
"Hello, pretty, who might you be?" Harry coos, rubbing his finger on the owl's breast feathers. The owl squawks and ruffles its wings. Harry raises a brow.
cousin, Hedwig. The one I was telling you about a while back? This is him," Harry explained patiently. Hedwig bobbed her head and understanding before turning her unblinking gaze to Caligo, Caligo standing quite still like his human had only seconds ago.
It was unbelievable. It was... It was
During that time, Corvus also taught Harry some wizarding customs. Just a few basic things, proper greetings, bows, and just a bit of social etiquette. He winced when he learned that handshakes were a bit of a thing in the British Wizarding World. Apparently, it was very rude to refuse a person's hand, almost as if to say
," a deep breath, the expanding of the chest, and Harry desperately tried to follow, "
Harry sighs. This would have been harder to say, a decade ago, before the war started, but he could easily say it now, after everything. There is a world outside of petty house rivalries and each characteristic that the houses favored are all good qualities. If the world would be safer if the Boy Who Lived wore silver and green, then let it protest and shout. There are worse things than words, like guns and bombs, war and death, and life, goddamnit.
When would he have ever even placed these
"Master Harry, then."
It was where Harry found himself now, tucked into his dad's bed of red and orange, thinking of all the things that happened this day.
It was a short trip to Gringotts, being in Diagon Alley and all, though it was crowded, as usual. Corvus was not impressed with the crowd and resolved to find if there were any other magical districts in the UK.
Harry turns bashful, ducking his chin to his collarbone. He clears his throat, a pink tint on his cheeks.
But with his letter in his hands, the reality of it all came crashing down on him like a tsunami of emotions. He clutches the letter to his heart, desperately holding back on tears that threaten to fall. Harry hasn't cried since he was 7, he wouldn't cry now, not with the Dursleys so close.
It was the trip inside the bank that put a bit of pause in their purposeful stride. It was hard to have a purposeful stride when you had to wait behind a line. It made Harry a little embarrassed, going in strong like they had, even the tip of Corvus' ears were red. Thankfully, it wasn't as if they burst open the doors or anything. They just walked looking like men on a mission and no one really noticed that in a bank.
"W-what do I..." little Harry hesitates, uncertain. His older self nods, understanding.
"I want them in bars," he growled, copper eyes pulsing in golden flashes.
Harry flinched back. "That... That would be bad, right? I mean, it being removed, that is. Wreaking havoc and trying to possess people and all that," Harry asked with a grimace, not wanting to be a burden being second nature after years with the Dursleys.
Severus would have thought it to be a cruel joke of Potter's, had he not known that Gringotts could not be fooled by such petty parlour tricks that James Potter had so loved. But still! That Lily not only forgave him but Lily, the woman he had loved, had still considered him her best friend and would entrust her son to
Little Harry's eyes widen even more. "Warn me?" He whispers fearfully.
Harry placed the envelope back inside the bag, resolving to read it later so he could take his time with it.
When he opened the black box, he saw little jewelry within: two golden bands, a few bracelets and a few simple necklaces. One necklace was a circular pendant with the initials HJP on one side and J&L on the other. Another necklace had a pendant of deer antlers and another necklace was a locket that held a picture of baby him on one side and his parents on the other side. Harry considers it a miracle that his aunt had not sold the things.
“I’ll see you then, Alrod,” Harry smiles but then pauses, an uncertain look on his face.
Harry, once Mimsy had dropped him off at Diagon Alley, had a fun time shopping yesterday.
"Then come with me, Mister Potter. There is another way to prove your identity and if you are who you say you are, then we can settle the matter of your key easily," Alrod states. He turns and walks a brisk walk towards the hall away from the tellers and Harry rushes to catch up with him.
"15 Galleons per block/spell, as opposed to the hospital's 8," Alrod answers, "It's also three times faster than any hospital, capable of undoing any spell or curse within the day."
“Before I leave,” Harry licks his lip, “I have just one more question.”
Seeing this, Harry explains, “A mutually beneficial relationship.”
"Hey there, little man." Not boy, never boy. Harry Potter never had a chance to be a boy, not since that night in Godric's Hallow.
When the goblin bank teller came back, he was accompanied by another goblin, this one staring at him more harshly than the former. Harry gulped, before bowing again, just to be sure.
It was because of this, Corvus wisely dropped the subject and any mention of Dumbledore was strictly professional and brief. Harry appreciated this, wanting more time to lick his wounds from the sting of the headmaster's betrayal.
"Caligo," Harry rasps, still a bit winded and he raises his hand with the letter—which is more of a note, really—and Caligo swoops towards him and grabs the note in his talons and flies out the still open window. Harry is glad Caligo decided to carry his note like that, rather than have him tie it to his leg; he really doubts his shaking hands would be able to do such a nimble task.
Harry, in turned, smiled apologetically at the owl. "Oh, I'm so sorry, sweetheart, where are my manners? Let me introduce you to my cousin, Corvus, and his owl, Caligo," Harry pointed out to the pair in question, "Corvus, Caligo, this is my owl, Hedwig."
by Eunice Atkins, and
Nodding, Harry makes up his mind. He would have gained his lordships either way, but Albus Dumbledore has gone too far. Thinking about it, Harry realized that half, if not most, of the reasons why his older counterpart’s life became so depressing lies with Dumbledore. Hopefully, with his inheritances, he would be able to escape the Headmaster’s grasp and whatever reasons he had that he would ruin a child’s life so much.
After a short catching up—Harry learned that Corvus had been adopted by a magical family after a bout of accidental magic made first adopted family aware of magic, and had been in America and then France since then—they were interrupted by a loud gurgling sound.
Inwardly, Corvus was quite pleased that his gentle, usually mild and quiet younger cousin had such a smart and strong-willed familiar, with a fierce attitude too. She would be very protective of her human, no doubt, and would never allow him to be too sad.
Harry was excited to take his first-ever dip on a tub and to be able to stay for longer than 10 minutes. He was even more excited when he discovered it had a bubble bath function on one of the taps.
James Potter, his schoolyard bully and all along toerag, had not only apologized but had also bequeathed him money, told him to start his own apothecary, and practically complimented him! It was almost like a scene from a nightmare he once had at 14, with a civil, polite, and almost kind James Potter greeting him amicably and friendly, a sight that had him breaking out in hives and waking him up with a terrified gasp. Severus would not even begin with to mention that James Potter had been aware and
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry had noticed that both shops had some books about him (which creeped him out and irked him) and the young Lord planned on discussing that with Alrod.
Truthfully, Remus was struggling to keep himself still so he wouldn't smother his cub within his arms, growling and snarling and all; seeing how shy his cub was, he knew he'd not be comfortable with physical contact just yet. Admittedly, he was also keeping still so he did not rush out and kill the people who had dared hurt and neglect his cub, his best friends' son.
At Harry’s nod, the pair makes it out of the room and the grand marble of the main hall becomes stone, the light dimming. Harry is reminded of caves; slightly damp stone and torch-lit light. Harry wonders how they’ll get to the vaults, as there are no stairs or even escalators (Harry also wonders if wizards
Originally, Corvus thought, as the last two Potters in Britain, Harry would take his Lordship when he reached his majority, but without the proper knowledge of his duties, all Harry would be us a name figure—Corvus refuses for his dear younger cousin to be something as insignificant and foolish. He'll have to teach Harry everything within the span of three years, five at the longest. As it is, he'll have to teach the basics (customs, tradition, etiquette) to Harry this summer.
"That's who you are, is it not?" He said shyly but a hint of cheek could be heard in his voice. The women snorted at that.
Still teary eyed, younger him nods and stares at him, attention undivided. Harry nods, satisfied.
While Ilvermony had Quadpot and Quidditch, with a few other clubs like Broom Racing and even muggle sports like soccer and track, but Ilvermorny had more than just quidditch and quadpot. It had horse racing,
He stays there, letting his tears, happy tears, fall from his eyes, as he waits. He's been waiting, always waiting, and what's a little bit more of waiting? He's coming back, just like he promised, and Harry wouldn't be alone anymore.
At this, Harry frowns confused.
on him? It was said they were applied yearly on him, since 1987. That was when he was, what, seven? Why would that man even—
Alrod nods, “Congratulations, Lord Peverell.”
"Well," he wets his lips, "What should I do?" Harry was not used to staying still, he was also not used to not doing chores early in the morning to late afternoon. Since he was 6, Harry had been constantly moving.
It was, admittedly, hard to tell Corvus everything that had happened in the last nine years. Often, he had to grab his cousin and stop him from committing murder, either the Dursleys for how they treat Harry or Dumbledore for being so '
Alrod raises his brows and stares down at the young wizard, making Harry struggle not to fidget. From the use of his title, Harry takes this as a formal request so Harry nods and promises not to overestimate himself in things he did not yet understand.
This is chapter 2...
He packed up his things on his bag, his food on top, water bottle strapped at the side. He hefted the old bag, heavy with precious belongings and necessities.
As always, entering Diagon Alley was a dream for Harry, though he'd gotten somewhat used to it last summer. It was nice, though, to see Corvus slightly impressed with the charm and rune work, and how it opened like a waterfall. When asked, Corvus said that the family that adopted him was involved and known for their warding and protection runes and protective charm work. As he was named heir then Lord, he took up to learning it early.
"How'd you sleep?"
“It’s alright, Teddy, everything is okay,” Potter shushes into Teddy’s ear. His hand rubs the little back gently as his eyes find Draco’s. There is a nauseating intimacy there now, a new level of...
The Great Hall was nearly exactly as he remembered it, though through the ceiling's enchantments, he could make out deep cracks in the stone that hadn't been entirely mended. Other than the sheer mass of students being larger than previous years, Harry felt almost as though he had taken a huge step back in time.
Something small and sharp strikes the back of his head.
“Nah. Just tryin’ to keep you straight a touch, kid. You’ve come a long way. Even said ‘please’ today.” The barman winks. “Makin’ strides, you are.”
"Depends on the dose. With how little we took, I'd say it's more likely to wear off by lunch."
Well, mostly without issue or worry. He still hadn't returned the 'I love you' that Harry had spoken to him in his bed the night before.
It hadn't made any sense, but Harry hadn't given chase. Draco had been likely out of his reach by then, anyway.
But when Harry returns home later, he wonders just how much merit the sentiment really has. He finds Draco leaning against Teddy’s bedroom door frame, pinching the bridge of his nose and looking all the part praying for patience as Teddy screams angrily somewhere beyond.
Draco might, but the mere child beside him didn't deserve those looks.
“Daco!” Teddy calls, hurrying over. “Daco, there fire!”
“Be that as it may,” he says, and he’s grateful his voice is steady, “I still would like to know why, of all the muggle books that must exist, you had to get Teddy the most mindless one available. I can’t even think straight anymore. All I can think about are orange stars and pink ovals.”
"Mr. Potter, what in Merlin's beard are you doing?"
"Er...what?"
"I'll bet you anything Slughorn assigns us some sort of essay once these potions are complete," she had said last lesson.
It was a rather nice home, Draco thought as they Apparated at the curb of a suburban two-story house. Somewhere between large and small, the home definitely had more of a cozy feel than the Malfoy Manor ever had. Long-dead gardens wrapped around the front porch and lined the walkway that extended to the street behind them. Christmas lights hung from the dormers protruding from the second story. Draco tried to smile at the sight. It really was a pleasant looking home despite his anxiety about the inhabitants.
"Are you mad?" Harry hissed as Draco shoved him quietly against the wall. Draco slapped a hand across Harry's mouth.
Harry raises a brow at him, sets Teddy on his feet next to the tub. “Yes. You have to get a bath.”
“Exactly.” But as Draco takes a sip of his tea, watching Harry do the same with more pursed lips, more worried eyes, that unfortunate stirring of pity starts up in his middle. “You know,” he starts, “the Care-Seekers aren’t going to expect Teddy to be perfect. In any case, you’re not
A lot is processing in those big brown eyes. Teddy blinks several times and bites his lip as he tries to make sense of Draco’s and Potter’s assurances. Finally, after an endlessly hung moment, Teddy reaches slowly for Draco.
"Oh."
All in all, Christmas could have gone a lot worse, Draco thought as he laid in bed that night.
“Count them,” Harry says, smug. “Go on, go count them like a madman.”
Draco looked up at Luna as she stood, her hand out and waiting for him. He had grown accustomed to her presence in the past several weeks, but never had they spent time together on the weekends, nor for any extended period of time. It was a daunting thought, to be in the company of another for hours at a time. Draco hadn't inflicted himself on anyone in so long, he wasn't sure he was up to it.
Draco stumbled into the Slytherin common room, nearly falling down the marble steps in his haste to reach the privacy of his dormitory. An unexpected perk of being the only male seventh year in his House, Draco had been given his own bedroom, no larger than a broom closet. It sat just to the left of the boy's main dormitory door and opened only at his hand, no password necessary for total privacy. He rushed in, slamming the door behind him as he collapsed onto the bed.
As Harry climbed the stairs to the hospital wing, his stomach continued to churn. It was a peculiar feeling, as though he were standing on the edge of something big and unknown, something equal parts terrifying and exhilarating. But Harry stood at the edge, teetering, unsure if he was ready leap in feet first.
When there’s no reply, Harry waves his wand to finish the dishes and makes his way back to the bedroom. Teddy isn’t there.
“Harry?” Mr. Cook’s voice calls through the door, sounding concerned.
Mr. Cook simply offers Harry’s embarrassment a pitying shrug.
“And why shouldn’t I be?”
Ron smacked the door once more, his voice fading as he walked away. "Just find her!"
“What a pretentious way to say he’s two and a half.”
Draco lifted his head to look at Potter. There was no way the Chosen One suffered the same ailment as Draco. Not something as irrational as this.
With another shrug, Draco tosses a carrot stick in his mouth and turns toward his bedroom. He waves a hand over his shoulder. “Please,” he says, and it sounds close to a sneer without being quite so...sneering. “I’m just better at being the bad guy than you are.”
The words hardly left his mouth when Harry was orgasming, spilling directly into Draco as Draco came between them. They were both moaning shakily as their bodies twitched with the ride. It was perfect. No amount of Bliss Potion could compare.
A wild idea struck Harry like a bolt of lightning.
“Oh, I’m not really trying to sleep,” Harry chuckles. He pulls Teddy closer, resting a hand on his small back when Teddy slumps forward. “Not really. I was just resting my eyes. I’m tired.”
His tears hadn't pooled enough to fall, and Draco blinked rapidly to prevent them from doing so as he shook his head. "I don't deserve this. I don't deserve to be happy."
“-I know it- wait, what?”
Harry snorted, the sound echoing in the quiet castle. "Professor, 'm pretty sure I'm pissed and was just caught out of bounds."
it was him, how he had quivered when Ron started to shout. Anger bubbled in Harry's stomach, but he forced himself to try and relax. He didn't want to be worked up when he found Malfoy. He wanted to be calm so that he could best explain to Malfoy how far from the truth Ron's words were.
Nodding, Draco offers a polite smile. “That makes sense. It’ll be best for Teddy, which is what this is all about.”
"I expect dinner to be finished soon," his mother said at his back. She stepped to the kitchen door, resting her hand on the handle. "Why don't you drop off your things in your room and I'll see to making us a couple of plates?"
“It’s not rabbit food-”
"I'd like to," he said. "I really would. But...I just can't stop reliving my worst memories. It's hardly even up to me."
"Well, that's good," Hermione said. "So why's he ignoring you? Lover's spat?"
"I don't know for sure," Hermione said. "But it might just be that he's scared of doing anything that might get his mum in trouble. They're all they have anymore."
“What does that have to do with anything?”
Harry chuckles through his nose, just a breathy sort of laugh, as he drops back onto the couch. Maybe it’s not such a bad thing, to be the bad guy, he thinks. At least Teddy will eat the noodles.
just when I take him to be watched in the mornings and when I pick him up after work.”
"Hey hey hey, whoa," Harry interrupted. Draco chanced a look and found Harry was shaking his head. "Look...I get it. Kind of. I can understand, at least. But Draco...this isn't some sick joke. Gryffindors hardly have the patience or acting skills to pull off something so elaborate, especially me.
“Uh...yes, I would say so.” When Chase doesn’t respond, Draco elaborates. “Now it’s not me supplementing what Andromeda and Mother are already doing, it’s...at least, when I have him, Teddy’s milestones feel like my own as well.”
Miles and miles stretched on, seconds to minutes to hours, time seemingly not working at all in this dark, dark space. Still, he walked.
Severus' iron mask seemed to crumble more and more as Lily's voice and memory spoke, starting from when her form appeared.
He flinched at the harsh glare of the goblin and bowed his head if only to surprise the goblin so much he loses the sneer, and answers in as steady a voice as possible, "I would like to speak to the Potter's Account Manager, please."
Lucius raises a curious brow to his friend, to which the dark-haired man shook his head, unaware of the reason for being held back. Lucius nodded at that and gave his goodbyes. He clutched the letter that Potter had given to him, a distant memory from the past tugging at his mind. He had a feeling he might know what the letter was about and was eager to get home to see if his theory was right. He turned and left his friend to handle whatever it is that the Potter Account Manager wanted.
He was to be made aware of the Will Reading on the day itself, leaving him only a few minutes to fix himself and make his way to the Will Reading Room. Though it would have been better if he were not present at all but because he was Chief Warlock, his presence was required, whether he was mentioned or not, though that was just Alrod’s opinion. Goblins apparently don’t like him.
“Serve them? Like… slaves?” Harry asks, uncertain. He breathes out in relief when Alrod shakes his head.
Older Harry sighs and runs a hand through his hair, "I won't lie to you, Harry. Some will try to control you, and they will try, very hard, but if you stay true to yourself and remember my words, you'll be alright, everything will be alright."
Harry tried not to wince and play with his fringe, asking the goblin instead what was wrong with it exactly.
“Alrod.”
Harry didn’t say this to the goblin.
Alrod gave them a minute to compose themselves before playing James' will. Severus would have thought his part was done, now that Lily's will was read. He was wrong.
"It is," he agrees. Little Harry's head snaps up, confused. He smiles ruefully, a bit apologetic. He knows it's confusing, as is always with magic this complex.
Even so, Corvus couldn't help but feel a bit proud of his cousin. Harry had gone through many a thing while he was gone, things he did not yet fully know of, and come out of it still the kind, sweet boy that he'd always been. But even with the short amount of time he's had with his cousin since his return, he had already caught glimpses of the strong, confident young man he was turning into. Harry did not go through all he's had and come out a weaker man.
"Are you planning to apparate me all over Britain till I do or something?" He asked petulantly.
Before Harry’s thoughts could spiral deeper, Alrod answers. “It merely means you have a proficiency in it, Harry. When or if you learn any healing spells, charms, or runes, you will take to it easier and more natural than someone who does not have it as their Family Magics. That is not to say that you are a prodigy, or that you already have the ability or knowledge to use Healing Magics, or that only people with Family Magics can excel in certain areas of magic.”
His thoughts were interrupted by happy chirping, Caligo hoping this way and that, twittering about with pleased, squinted eyes. A glance at Hedwig saw to her preening her feathers, seemingly ignoring the smaller, joyous owl.
"They're in Diagon Alley, sir, working. They told me to meet up with them there, and to get Tom the Barkeeper to open the way," he says, trying to make his voice sound like he's reciting the last part. The man's eyebrows rise to his hairline.
"Boy!"
"Do not trust Albus Dumbledore."
“From the looks of it, I was right?” Alrod inquired.
It was also during then that they'd found out that Harry had not received a single letter from Corvus before the one he had sent almost a week ago. Corvus had sported a heartbroken expression, grieving that his younger cousin had possibly thought that he had been forgotten and abandoned all this time, never once receiving the letters and gifts that he had sent him. It was exactly what Harry had thought, when he was younger and years had gone by without a word from his cousin, so he had no words to comfort him. Apparently, the only reason why he was able to get the letter Corvus had sent last was that he used a bit of blood magic on it; only those with the same blood would be able to read it and, as an unintended side-effect, would allow Calligo to find Harry wherever he was (due to the shared blood between Harry and his human) and get past any wards he was in or under, Calligo being able to do so as he was Corvus' Bonded Owl.
There was a... goblin, in red and gold, guarding the entrance, who eyed Harry, and he blushed because he knew it was because of his clothes. Still, if there was one good thing that the Dursleys taught him, it was to be polite and respectful. So Harry bowed his head, surprising the goblin.
He nodded in thanks and grabbed the parchment, unrolling it to see a few words written on it in red.
The Gaunt box was the plainest of the lot; African Blackwood box with snake carvings for a frame, one sole snake had one jadeite as its eye, the others missing theirs, the crest on the middle front; two shades of green with snakes coiling with each other.
“I expect you on the 28
The Black Heir ring resides inside a black ornate box, silver frames and a large iolite gem on the middle of the lid, the Black Family crest in the middle of the gem; three ravens, a hand holding a wand and a skull, with the word
Making up his mind, Harry breaks the rules for the first time in his life. He makes himself some food. He makes sandwiches and gets two juice boxes and a water bottle from the fridge, a thrill going up his spine knowing that it would be a noticeable loss in the fridge but he'd be long gone when the Dursleys' notice. He goes up to Dudley's second room and scavenges for a bag Dudley no longer used. Harry could take one of his cousin's nice bags but Harry was no thief, even if his relatives would say differently.
"In regards to money, as the Heir and only Potter—in Britain at that time, that is—you should have been getting mail from the Goblins at Gringotts," Corvus explained, frowning.
“Harry… It was believed that when your parents went into hiding, they used a Fidelius Charm, a spell to conceal, to hide a secret, the secret being the home you once had in Godric’s Hollow. This secret is contained to one person, only they know what the secret and, therefore, only they could share it. They are called Secret-Keepers—“
With a frown, Harry asks, “Let me guess: Dumbledore closed it, didn’t he?”
“Healer Gurkrat,” Harry breathed out once he was calm. He looked at the elder and strict Goblin and bowed his head, “Thank you for your help, Healer Gurkrat. I’ve never felt better in my entire life.” And it was true. Now that it was gone, Harry was able to notice that he’d lived his life in numb pain, aches all over his body from within.
Placing the ring on his left thumb, the young wizard waits with bated breath as he feels the family magic wrap around him, judging him. Not a few seconds later, the magic settles, giving him a cool feeling, like a breeze or breath in cold weather, magic like a black mist, almost tangible and giving him a familiar feeling, like the one he felt during those times he would be sick and in pain and like the next breath he would take would be his last. Harry shivers at the magic and memory.
"You best behave yourself, boy, and I better come back to a clean and whole house or it's your back on the streets, you hear me, freak?" Vernon threatens by the door as they leave, Petunia already in the car.
The goblin, much to Harry's relief, nodded curtly and hopped off his stool. "Wait here, please," he stated before disappearing behind the doors.
Harry's train of thought was halted when uncle Vernon's voice echoed through the house in a scream. Harry jumped at the sound and Corvus immediately got to his feet, wand in hand and the other on Harry's shoulder.
“Should we mention me being Lord Potter?” Harry asks as he shuffles through the papers of his properties and shares. Harry did not know what house-elves are, but he seems to have a number of them from a couple of his houses: three Peverell house-elves, five Potter house-elves, seven Black house-elves, eight Slytherin and Gryffindor house-elves, and about a hundred or so Hogwarts house-elves. Should Harry be alarmed?
Corvus smirks, eyes flashing towards the Dursleys as he answers, "Anytime and anywhere, petit vert." The Dursleys pale at the statement.
Alrod shakes his head, “I do not see why we should. It is better to keep such things quiet and in our favour.”
, in the words of Dudley’s American shows.
. "Follow my lead, Petit Vert,
For the third time today, Harry felt tears pool in his eyes, but this time finally let them fall. He sat there crying over the box of things that belonged to him and his parents, sobbing over the pain and love, over the sadness and the joy, of everything that was in his life.
Remus' breath went out in a whoosh, catching Harry's attention. Harry glanced at him and the older man gave a small smile, to which Harry gave a hesitant one back. Emboldened, Harry straightened his back, fingers clutching the hem of his shirt and tried to greet his godparents hello.
With that, Alrod places Lily Potter's will into the sphere. From the corner, he sees how most of the room sat up straight, Severus taking a deep, fortifying breath, while Remus looked to be determined, steeling himself from his own emotions. Harry understood them both.
He grabbed Harry by the front of his robes and pulled him in, smashing their lips together in a kiss that seared Draco down to his very soul.
"What are you doing?" Malfoy asked through his teeth, though he didn't pull his hand away.
Far from desirable.
“Heyyy.”
He wondered if he ought to just fall.
“Well, I think that will do for now,” Mr. Cook says. He starts to gather his things. “Yet I must say, gentlemen, I am quite proud of the progress that Teddy’s new family has made. Who’d have thought, eh?”
"It's alright," Draco said. "It's just, uh, personal. I'd rather not get into it. But believe me, when you know, you know."
“No. Stan.”
"It's...it's not..." Draco's voice was only a raspy whisper, slipping out between gasps for air. He knew he was beginning to shake harder and he withdrew his hand. "Don't. Please. Not...not for me."
“Shhh!” Draco nearly jumps out of his skin at Potter’s sudden and booming voice directly behind him.
"Here, I think I have one." Draco opened his own bag and pulled out a quill to give their charge, but the shrub knocked it away. It's cries grew angrier. And louder.
He rubbed his eyes as he made his way up to the library alone. Hermione had been quite excited by the idea of kicking off their weekend doing homework, but Ron's begging not to skip two meals in one day had her begrudgingly waving goodbye to Harry as they parted ways, leaving him to trek through the castle alone. Homework was the furthest thing from his mind these days, but as he had already neglected the mountain that had accumulated thus far, he figured he ought to try and make a dent in it before his marks began to suffer.
They drink, the liquid warm and pleasant against Harry’s tongue.
Harry dropped down onto the foot of the bed, head dropping into his hands. He, too, had been tempted by the Ministry's offer. To be given job security so young was a gift. But Harry fought with more than simply a choice between entering the workforce or returning to school.
“You also just agreed that my idea is in Teddy’s best interest.”
"Blasted kids," Carraway muttered, her voice clear through the thin door. "Too damn fast."
For a moment, they just stared at one another awkwardly, until Weasley and Granger came up to Potter's side, dragging him away without so much as a glance Draco's way. Only when he was completely alone did Draco's shaking subside, breathing becoming more natural. But his heartrate had only just dropped to normal when Professor Sprout ushered him out to make room for her next lesson.
Harry did his best to comfort the crying baby while Andromeda stepped into the kitchen once more, but for all the shushing and bouncing, Teddy only continued to scream. Tiny teeth sank into Harry's shoulder briefly. He groaned to keep from swearing right in Teddy's ear. Not that he'd have heard it anyway.
"I am not some game to play, some person to save."
“I am plenty affectionate with him. But there was a certain routine Teddy was used to before you came and mucked it up. He’s probably just confused as to what’s acceptable and what’s not since you insist on treating him like a baby.”
"Please, no one cares enough about him to ask questions. Do they, Malfoy?
Several moments passed. Draco wiped at his eyes, the cold wind turning them to ice on his cheeks and tearing at the skin there. It was enough to give his frightened sorrow pause, a rare relief for Draco in the past several days.
"Lupin asked me."
"What?" Harry asked, surprised. "How did you-"
Weasley slammed a fist on the table, shaking the mugs and drawing the rest of the pub's attention to their table. "Oh, quit being so high and mighty! If you weren't so stuck on being the poster boy of love and peace or whatever, you'd wish he'd just off himself, too!"
Draco raised his brows at her. "Finally? You had only just started attacking the door."
Irritated, Draco continues to the kitchen, brewing some coffee to start the day. Despite his annoyance at Potter and how
Harry reached out and grabbed the front of Malfoy's cloak and pushed him against the wall. Abrupt fury lapped at Harry's stomach.
“NO!”
Potter sighed, and Draco glanced over despite himself. Potter looked...sad. Strange.
“You got that right,” Harry grumbles.
“Ah.”
Harry blinked. "What, like at a time?"
"I deserve it," he said quietly.
I realize that you likely have a much stronger bond with Teddy than Mr. Potter-”
Draco shrugs as he sits in the center of a couch placed beneath a small Bewitched window. With a disbelieving tut, Chase settles into the chair facing him.
"I'm not saying he was right in what he did at all."
"Where is Karen?"
"No one's stopping you from relaxing, Ron."
shout it from the rooftops."
"Harry?"
"How the hell did you come to the conclusion to bring me into your dormitory?" Draco asked, forcing himself to sound calm. "Into your
Anxiety clawed at his chest. After Voldemort's death, there was a solid week's worth of work that had been done to repair Hogwarts as well as find, identify, and bury the dead. It had nearly been fifty-fifty on deaths of those in the rebellion and Death Eaters, a number that gave many families comfort, knowing that their loved ones died likely taking at least one Death Eater with them. But for Harry, it was devastating. So many lives were needlessly lost to Voldemort's ruthless battle against death, unity, and understanding.
Harry shrugged as he offered a quill to their shrub. "Well, I can't say that girls are repulsive or anything. Maybe I like both. I hear there's a term for that now."
It’s too much. Potter has spelled the mark precisely despite his idiocy, and Draco’s aforementioned stress and anxieties are just fractionally beyond his control so soon after receiving that damned invitation. Not even bothering with his wand from his pocket, Draco whips around to take a swing at Harry fucking Potter’s face with his bare fist. It’s crude and barbaric and his father is likely rolling in his rotting grave, but Draco doesn’t care, can’t care. He aims a punch to Potter’s stupid scar.
“It’s not ridiculous! You’re going to look me in the eye and tell me you’re not one bit nervous about meeting with them?”
"This year?" Josh sputtered. "He...you weren't here last year, you have no idea what he'd done!"
"Welcome, all, welcome," Professor McGonagall called, bringing the thundering Hall to silence in the span of a few seconds. She smiled down at them, a rather unusual look for the strict witch. "Welcome to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, though this is the first year in the school's history that so many students are actually being welcomed back.
Face growing hot, Harry scowls. “Well, I didn’t have this issue when it was just me and him, either. Probably because I let him fall asleep with the affection he obviously needs. He wasn’t seeking it out in the middle of the night because I just gave it to him.”
do this.
“Er, Harry, please.”
“Seems fair to me,” Draco says evenly.
Well, should we just dive right in, or would you like the distraction of hearing about my weekend?”
Words fail Draco. Mouth and brows warped with utter incredulity, all he can do is stare.
“I’d rather get it right.”
Not quite knowing what to say, Draco nods, slow and deliberate. His step is quite sure when he stands though his head is pleasantly fuzzy, and it’s with an unfamiliar sense of assuredness in his soul that Draco Apparates home to make his way to bed. Perhaps the old barman with no teeth has some merit. He made the same points Draco has heard many a Monday, but somehow they sound more realistic, more concrete and less fantastical coming from a simple man named Tom.
"Stop, stop." Potter's voice was hardly above a whisper and incredibly calm, a clash against the swirling vortex of terror that was Draco's entire world. Potter's other hand came to Draco's chest, adding more pressure there, and strangely...there was some relief.
Potter’s eyes changed from leering to angry in record time. “You don’t get to decide when I can and can’t pick up my godson.”
"Mmm? And what could possess an eleven-year-old girl to sit with a grumpy old man instead of her friends?"
"Don't bother with this one," a high-pitched voice interrupted.
Gemma’s smile breeches far above the definition of ‘beaming.’ Unsettled, Draco turns to find a chair at the greatest distance from her to wait, yet that smile seeps through the empty waiting room like a bad odor, reaching him regardless.
"That is a bit unusual," she said kindly. "Not that being close with the Potter boy is a bad thing, but...you ought to be careful there."
The tide of panic began to return. Draco struggled to take a breath that could abate it.
"Have I?" Harry laughed once without humor. "Well, give it back."
Harry let out a breath he hadn't realized he had been holding and smiled bracingly. "It's alright. The point is, I do get it, wanting to avoid everyone looking and talking. Although I never thought to duck in here to hide."
Ron shrugged as he walked away, leaving Harry considerably less angry and less exasperated when Hermione sat down with her textbook already open in her hands.
"I-Hermione...that just-" He took a breath. "No, Hermione. It's not like that, either. I'm...I'm not even gay."
But now, as he sat perched on the edge of the tower, wind stinging his cheeks and whipping through his hair, Draco had finally found some tears to shed. He blinked, and the first drop fell onto his cheek. It turned to ice almost instantly as the wind hit him again. The promised blizzard had dissipated, it seemed, leaving an angry cold that hadn't the strength to cover the earth in any more snow. Draco could understand the feeling.
“Dim-end.”
"Oh, but I really think I do. People have always stared at me. It's got to be the most obnoxious thing I've ever experienced, and that's saying something. You ought to meet my aunt and uncle."
“Pup-leh d...d...”
"Tell that to Draco," Harry muttered. "Maybe he'll listen to you and stop being a total arse and let himself be happy for once. Let me be happy."
"Why thank you, Draco."
"No, I suppose not." Draco eyed Harry as he tentatively stroked a leaf. "But you dated, right? Had plenty of girls before...this."
“No you wouldn’t. You’d moan about him not clearing his plate.”
"Surely it's not necessary for both of us to be here?"
“Wow, I knew he was tired, but he’s never fallen asleep that fast for me."
“Look,” Draco says then, dropping all pretense, all the festering attitude and tone and frustration, shamelessly throwing himself metaphorically to his knees in desperation. “I can’t expect to have what I had with Teddy before, but at the very least, I can watch him during the day while you’re off doing whatever it is you do at the Ministry. Having two people he knows and trusts watching him regularly will be better for him than whatever chaos you’re tossing him through now. It’ll offer him better stability.”
Vivid memories of the wandburns covering his arms filled his head, dancing with the various jinxes and hexes thrown at him in the corridors. He had begged Professor McGonagall not to write his mother about the incident that nearly resulted in his skull being shattered and miraculously, she had complied. Being a legal adult likely had been the only thing keeping his secret safe.
"A bit sad?" Harry asked, incredulous. "Hermione, the kids tried to literally blow Malfoy's head apart."
"I meant to hit the wall behind him," Josh said, pleading. "I just wanted to scare him, but I missed. I was just so angry...I didn't mean...I just didn't aim it properly...it was...it was an accident."
"You don't think that that's what he'd've said if I'd been killed?"
Blast, it was freezing.
Far from the laughter that would have followed in previous years, the class cooed at Potter's plight, and Professor Sprout nodded her head. "No worries today, Potter. Have a seat where you can find one, I know we're a bit crowded in here. But let's not be late next time, hmm?"
"Oh, just wonderful!" She nodded at Malfoy. "Draco was just helping me look for a book I cannot seem to find."
"Apology accepted!" Karen smiled at him. "Are you going to eat lunch today?"
"How much do you ususally get?"
The rush from the Burrow to King's Cross had been noticeably less stressful than in previous years, leaving them all at least twenty minutes to say good-bye before the train was set to leave. Mrs. Weasley had finally released the tears that had threatened to fall for weeks, sobbing openly into each of their chests in turn as she said her farewells to Harry, Ron, and Ginny. Mr. Weasley had firmly shaken Harry's and Ron's hands, as had Charlie, and embraced his daughter tightly. It had been emotional, and Ron had fretfully tried to ease his mother's tears by reminding her that all the danger had passed, that they would all be back for Christmas before she knew it. It had seemed to help as they boarded, but Harry saw Mrs. Weasley dissolve into tears again from the train window.
Harry looked up. "So we actually
All is well.
Draco shot into a sitting position, blinking around in alarm at the sound of Ron Weasley's voice, loud and clear at his side. It was dark still, but Draco was surrounded by a royal red, and pressed against him was...
“Just take a bite, Teddy. Then you’ll see how hungry you are and you’ll feel better.”
He ran his fingers through his hair, pulling at the strands until they stung his scalp. For the millionth time since stepping foot onto the grounds, Draco thought about what a foolish hope returning to Hogwarts had been. There was no way for things to actually get better, no matter what the Lovegood girl kept telling him.
“Ha-wee yuv Daco,” Teddy says, put out. “Wan’ Daco here.”
“I worry that it already is involved.”
"I said, 'Can I get some real sleep tonight?'"
"Come here often?"
"Guess we better get going, mm?" he asked.
“You have a garden in your fridge.”
Draco took three sharp kicks to his sides before the laughter echoing off the empty corridor walls began to fade away, footfalls taking the boys around the corner and leaving Draco alone at last. When silence met his ears, Draco sat up, groaning, and inspected his arms. Dozens of tiny burns covered them, each a varying shade of shining red. They stung when Draco let his robes fall over his arm again.
It’s not terribly likely that Teddy knows what Draco’s talking about, not really. Still, it’s nice to hear the agreement. As Draco is loading up three plates, Potter wanders into the kitchen. He looks just as groggy, just as wild, just as twisted as Teddy does.
“Well, yes, I think I’m doing alright.” He licks at his lips once. “I...I’m making an effort to do things differently with Teddy than how I was raised.”
"Harry?" Hermione stopped in front of the classroom door, blocking him and Ron from entering. "You talk to him, yes?"
“It certainly has the promise, and it’s not like the situation is novel,” Mr. Cook chuckles. “We’d just need Mr. Malfoy on board and to have things in writing-”
Harry had been most disturbed by Josh's punishment after everything. He had admitted to instigating the first attack and took full responsibility for the second, and yet McGonagall hadn't expelled him as Harry had viciously hoped. But when the headmistress had told Harry that Josh also lost all his Hogsmeade privileges for the year, along with a month's worth of detentions followed by weekly detentions until the end of the year, Harry had felt his hackles fall. It was almost exactly what his own punishment had been after he himself had attacked Malfoy two years previous.
If Harry were truly honest with himself, and he almost had to be with his current state, he still loved Draco deeply. Nothing could change that overnight. Or over-week. However long it had been since Draco had started to push Harry away with everything he had, both emotionally and physically.
he could find, Draco needed to hear it from his mother that she was okay.
No, it’s not Teddy’s fault that Draco has spent the hours following his mother’s and aunt’s deaths searching for and securing a respectable flat. It’s not Teddy’s fault that Draco forces down just enough food to carry him through the shopping required to fill that new flat. It’s not Teddy’s fault that Draco has spent every waking hour for two straight days assembling new furniture, unpacking hundreds of galleons’ worth of things that make a flat a home. It’s not Teddy’s fault that Draco doesn’t have time to mourn. It’s not Teddy’s fault that Draco now faces an uphill battle against impossible odds to reclaim the only thing in his world that makes life worth living.
It should have been strange, having Christmas tea with Andromeda, Teddy, Draco, and Narcissa. Less than a year ago, Harry never thought he'd be here, politely talking about the various administrative changes Hogwarts had undertaken with Narcissa Malfoy and her estranged sister while Remus Lupin's son crawled around their feet. It could have been easier, maybe, without Narcissa staring quietly at the floor for most of the exchange, but it also could have been so much worse.
That had been the year Draco began struggling to keep his meals down.
“Ahhh!” Harry cries out.
"It's not about my right to talk, it's about leaving a little girl that has nothing to do with what you're really mad about alone."
And now, as he threw the last of his clean socks into Fred's old trunk, Harry was about to leave the room empty again. The following day was September 1, and Harry Potter was returning to Hogwarts.
"Oh, Ron, I didn't insist a thing. This was all your idea."
Harry glanced around. The N.E.W.T. level Potions class held the fewest students of all his lessons, and the students had clumped together at six desks arranged into three tables. Ron and Hermione sat at one desk pressed with Ernie Macmillan and another Hufflepuff Harry was sure hadn't been in the class his sixth year; four Ravenclaws sat together at another table; and at the last table sat Draco Malfoy, entirely alone and eyes downcast. Harry quietly dropped into the seat beside him.
Mimsy cocked her head. The marauders had no problem busying themselves as they waited for food, she even often had to chase them away from the kitchen as they made a mess trying to 'help move things along'. She supposes the young master, new as he was to the place, was still unsure of how to use Marauder's Den and all it had, the way her Marauder masters intended it for.
, his best mate's little sister. Frankly, Harry still didn't want to think about it.
Harry hums, “So basically, what they don’t know won’t hurt us.”
A few seconds later, Harry found the envelope and handed it to Corvus, who then tied it to the Ministry owl. He waited until the owl flew away before glancing curiously at his older cousin, slightly worried he got in trouble despite what he'd said.
Suddenly, Harry froze as realization struck. 1987… He was seven years old… The only thing notable that happened then was…
With a grim face, Alrod answers the young wizard slowly, his words careful, “You must know first, Lord Potter, that although Lord Black is in prison, it was not a normal imprisoning.”
Albus Dumbledore sat slumped in his seat, the twinkle in his eyes noticeably gone. He had, to Harry, looked every bit his age and almost like the weary war general that he was. Harry had almost forgotten, amidst shocking truths, colourfully vibrant robes, and Dumbledore's cheery disposition, that this man was almost 110 years old and had gone through two wars, was a teacher for longer than he was alive, even before his father was born, and had probably attended or grieved over many of his students' deaths. This was a man that had fought for what he thought was right but had carried the burdens on his own, never sharing them with anyone, plotting how he could save them all. It was this that had led to a third war in the future, the one after Voldemort's second war and defeat.
Alrod turned to him, "Lord Potter, this is Healer Gurkrat. She will be the one conducting the cleansing and healing."
"No, that was not what happened," Uldrick agreed, his scowl softening. The Potters nodded and grasped each others' hand, Harry looking for support and Corvus readily giving it.
"You are awake sooner than I expected," Gurkrat stated, making Harry jump at the suddenness of her appearance. He did not notice her come through the door, and when exactly had she arrived for her to be beside the bed already.
And then Older Harry was gone.
) weeks because he bore the mark of a madman. When he had been released (vouched for as a double agent), he had still been on house arrest for two months and was heavily watched by the DMLE and had an agent from a British ICW agency to conduct bi-weekly check-ups on him for a year, especially since he became a member of the Hogwarts Staff.
ignore but...
Alrod is shocked at this, not at the muggle phrase but by the calm and levelheadedness of a supposed 10-year old boy. ‘
Harry felt his eyes itch and burn, nuzzling back to embrace the older Potter. "I would have been okay so long as you were here," he mumbled into his cousin's chest.
Harry's breath left him in a whoosh. Hands shaking, he plops down on his bed, rereading the letter once, twice, three times before he remembers to breathe again and—his jumbled thoughts come to a halt when he hears a soft hoot. Slowly, he turned his head to the bedframe where Caligo perched on. Caligo chirped and hopped a bit on the metal frame, and as Harry continued to watch the black owl, he felt he could grab hold of a few of his thoughts within his muddled brain. Caligo turned his beak to the side and Harry followed his gaze to the desk.
Harry thought about it deeply. He supposes it makes sense, in some way. Death Magic not being necessarily evil but was still useable for evil. It was like a kitchen knife, a tool one uses for cooking, to create sustenance that’s needed for the body, but was sharp enough that carelessness could hurt the wielder or others, and if one stabs a person with a knife hard enough, could kill them.
When they finished eating, Harry looked up, "So what do we do?"
Alrod stood up from his seat and guided Harry out the huge doors, "Then come this way."
," a whoosh, air escaping, lungs compressing, and Harry follows with short, shaky breaths.
century at least—have a proficiency in Death Magic, Shadow Magic, Obscure Magics, and/or Healing Magic,” Alrod adds lastly.
“The fact that you’ve consistently chosen fame over family throughout the years should have been enough of a turn off for anyone to ever grant you guardianship over another living creature. Isn’t that how you lost the Weasley girl? You put her off so you could gallivant off to save the world? Trying to be such a noble bastard and it cost you probably the only witch foolish enough to love you.”
Draco glances at Harry, looking as though he wants to both laugh and sneer. Somehow, he’s able to convey the combination pretty well. Harry rolls his eyes, unwrapping the tortillas for he and Teddy to start steaming them. Throughout the following hour, Draco manages to thin the sauce to quiet his own fretting, and Harry allows Teddy to make an enormous mess helping them stuff, roll, and align the enchiladas in a baking dish before literally dumping a bag of cheese over the entire thing, much to both Harry’s and Draco’s exasperation. Finally, though, the three sit down to eat.
"Is that..."
"What's going on? You alright?"
“So yes, O Chosen One, I think you’ll find me
Malfoy narrows his eyes. “Mark my words, Potter. Your tendency to put people aside for your own selfish goals will show up before long with Teddy, and I will be patiently waiting to catch him.”
Draco poured his tea into his cup and held it in both hands, savoring the warmth it brought his frozen fingers. He took a sip. Now that the war was over and Draco no longer was living in personified panic, he had hoped sleep could come easier. But it seemed that the opposite had occurred - now that the world had fallen into a certain amount of calm, Draco was sleeping less than ever. Waking nightmares kept him tossing and turning into the night, and even when he did manage to fall asleep, the horrific memories only jolted him back awake.
“If Potter can’t manage, would he be placed with me?”
And Draco wants to be there for it.
“Wan’ Daco
Potter stares. His wand remains aimed at Draco, steady as ever.
She offered him the glass, and though Draco took it, he didn't drink.
“Morning.”
But even after the war, Draco hadn't worried over it. He had far worse crimes he had committed than preferring men to women.
"I love you, too," Harry smiled.
Draco's knee felt cold as Potter stood abruptly, his hand going with him to whip out his wand. "Take that back."
"I'm personally in favor of flying."
But now, nearing eight in the morning, Draco was sitting, fully dressed, at the end of the hospital bed and growing impatient with Madam Pomfrey's fussing. She had waved her wand across his forehead multiple times and checked various reflexes at least three times each, and it seemed that the matron was now just looking for reasons to keep him there.
"No, your eye was swollen at the Welcoming Feast," Harry pressed when Malfoy returned and checked on the potion. "I saw you, remember?"
Harry rolled his eyes. "I'm asking if we can share a bed again, you idiot."
“I’ll be there.”
“What do you think you’re doing here?” Potter hisses. “You think you can just break into-”
With a loud crack, Potter Apparates into existence, just at the other end of the couch. Squealing with delight, Teddy launches from Draco’s lap to tackle his godfather to the floor.
Draco looked up, surprised. "You're religious?"
Draco nodded. "I haven't written her since term started. She hasn't written me, either, but I know she's just trying not to bother me."
But with the holidays bearing over them and Draco's body turning into putty beneath him, Harry decided to wordlessly ask once more. He didn't get the chance, however.
"Hey," the boy snapped, poking Draco hard in the chest until he opened his eyes. "What, you think I'm just gonna go away if you close your eyes? Well, too bloody bad."
"Hey."
“I-” Potter stops, an odd look flitting across his face like a rippling. Confusion, so common in those eyes, flare and fade into annoyance before he shakes his head and continues. “Teddy’s happy here.”
“Then a renewal would not be as necessary. It would simply fall to Harry’s prerogative without our department’s interference, as would be the case for any biological parent.”
Her smile was worth the lie, though Draco only felt a little guilty as he walked out of the Great Hall. Karen was far sweeter than he was sure he had ever been, but something about that forceful need for acceptance reminded Draco fiercely of what he had once been, just an entitled 11-year-old looking for friends.
"Hello, Draco."
Hermione is struggling to reach him through the thick throng of workers pushing in the opposite direction. Hardly any taller than their time at Hogwarts, Hermione’s bushy hair is lost among the crowd for a moment as Harry slows to wait for her.
“I work for the Ministry. How is that a concern?”
If only she knew the half of it.
Weasley grinned. "I don't feel bad for what's happened in the past. I'm not above that. But if Harry's willing and able to move on and be your friend, I reckon I'm willing to try, too."
“I can see your pants.”
But Teddy is snoring into his thin pillow.
"You're being an overdramatic moron."
Draco stopped to stare at the child. He seemed excessively small, blue eyes too large for his face and fine hair a strange mix of dark brown and hot pink. Those blue eyes came to meet Draco's, and in the few short seconds that followed, they changed to a pale gray and his hair became a deep black.
"Report me how? What wrong have I done?"
Harry’s brows shoot up, vanishing into his mess of hair. Ears feeling warm, Draco’s about to retract the offer when Harry clears his throat and says, “Yeah, actually. Sounds great,” and stands to follow.
“No, it was fine, really.”
A terrible sadness welled up inside Draco's chest as he nodded.
Harry chuckled and turned to his start his antidote. He found the recipe and saw that Malfoy was right - it was almost comically simple. Just a powderized bezoar boiled in oak sap and moss oil. He turned to see the recipes for Prohibis Spiritum and Blood-duct. They were equally as simple, if requiring a few more ingredients and steps. With a glance at the clock, Harry had to admit that it made sense. Just over an hour remained. Slughorn wouldn't have actually assigned something impossible.
There’s warmth under his skin now. It’s a bit of a sore spot for Harry, his ongoing lack of a love life. Though things aren’t strained by any means, he and Ginny didn’t rekindle as they had both hoped after the war, and Harry hasn’t been terribly successful in dating since. Not that he’s exactly tried, but still.
"It's a bit more than that, mate," Harry said, and Draco raised his eyebrows at him, vaguely surprised.
But Draco couldn't listen to Harry begging him to stop, begging him to stay. Draco couldn't listen to Harry's voice as he grabbed his things from the table and finally listened to his body, listened to the panic. Pushing his way past Harry's outstretched arm and Weasley standing in the doorway, Draco bolted.
"Mission accomplished," Harry said distractedly, trying to focus on talking, kissing, and unbuttoning all at once. It was far more complicated than he had anticipated. But before long, Harry had Draco's shirt undone and untucked, exposing the flesh underneath to his frantic fingers.
"You-"
"Of what?"
She narrowed her eyes a bit more, then beamed as she released them both. "Well good. I know they're adults and all, but I must say that it is nice to know they have you two making sure they get home okay."
"As always, Aberforth, you are missing the point entirely! Come, Potter. It's back to the castle with you."
She waved a hand dismissively. "Oh, Harry, dear, you're too kind." She set the last dish down and glanced toward the staircase. "I've made everyone's favorite, so feel free to eat as much as you'd life! Nothing left, you hear me?"
Half past nine, Draco appears.
Potter’s fuming could steam the room. “Why’d you do that? He’s got to eat more than two bites a meal.”
Her eyes were green, much like Potter's. But Karen's eyes held more innocence than he was sure he or Potter had ever possessed. He shook his head, feeling more and more like a monster.
It was Friday, the Friday ending the first week after the holiday, and Harry was drunk at the Hog's Head. The clock struck midnight. It was Saturday.
Harry dropped into a spot at breakfast the following morning, beyond exhausted. He hadn't slept more than two hours and was wondering how in the world he had survived on so little sleep this long. Yawning, he poured himself a cup of coffee and scanned the Slytherin table.
"He really has changed, hasn't he?"
"Where are you off to in such a hurry?" she asked. Ron hesitated a moment beside them, but when Hermione waved her hand at him, he continued down the staircase with a shrug.
Harry's feet led him through the corridors aimlessly, knowing most routes without needing to lift his eyes. Filch had retired after the war, though many suspected that McGonagall has personally seen that he leave the castle for good. He had yet to be replaced, a fact McGonagall had not mentioned to the main student body. Harry knew that the teachers took turns patrolling the castle at night in Filch's place, but Harry was far less concerned with being caught out of bed than he once was.
“No harm done.” Malfoy grabs a canvas bag from the countertop and begins stuffing fruit into it. “I got caught up cooking and am only just now ready to leave anyway.”
The speaker stops.
Harry's brows furrowed, trying to make sense of what Luna was saying. It was reminiscent of when he had first kissed Cho and Hermione seemed to know every single wild reason as to why Cho had been crying during it. He never had really grasped all of that, either.
Having managed to undo Harry's shirt without trouble, Draco slid his hands across the bare chest between them, sending chills across Harry's skin and making him tilt his head back at the sensation. Draco's lips locked onto his neck, licking at the area just below his ear. Harry's hips bucked slightly, his excitement growing.
“I can adjust my hours to account for that and fit Teddy’s needs.”
“I believe so! I heard about a fairly high-class building that has lots of different floor plans and price options, and they advertise to offer lease discounts for law enforcement.”
Harry closed his eyes briefly as he descended to the entrance hall, horrified at the thought of what the boys had done. Harry had seen some strange marks all over Malfoy's arms when he had helped Madam Pomfrey change him, but at the time Harry hadn't given them much thought.
But he couldn't do that. Harry rubbed the heels of his hands into his eyes. In some sick way, he knew he owed it to the wizarding world that he had just saved to stay. To vanish now would be ungrateful to those who had stayed by his side all these years, supported him through thick and thin, loved him when he hadn't loved himself.
Draco tried to glare at her, hating Harry Potter. But he hadn't anything planned for the day anyway, and Draco found himself ten minutes later crouched over helping Luna Lovegood search for dandelions in the frosty grass.
Draco sets out the plates, scooting Teddy close enough to prevent the most possible food from falling to the floor. Potter murmurs a ‘thanks,’ which Teddy echoes more enthusiastically, and they begin to eat.
“He’s not that bad, really.” Harry yawns, checking the clock. Once they return from their break, there’s only another half hour until the Auror trainees are dismissed to the physical training portion of their day. “We may as well go back; there’s only a minute left.”
Teddy hurries into the kitchen clutching his elephant. Malfoy stoops to hug him, lifting him and offering him out to Harry. Their eyes lock.
"Right."
“That’s- that’s exactly what I was going to say.”
me instead of putting him in nappies when I’m not around, you absolute waste of oxygen,” Draco snaps.
As though stepping into the beginnings of a fog, Draco smiled back. They stared at one another, and Draco was struck full force with how absolutely beautiful Harry's eyes were. Bright, vivid green as though they were created from every gorgeous meadow described in poetry and a distinctive almond shape that bordered on exotic. The deep bags that hung below no longer were a sign of deprivation but a battle scar of Harry's strength, and Draco forgot the world as he suddenly reached out and took Harry's hand in his own.
The doors to the Great Hall were uncharacteristically closed for a regular weekend dinner. It gave Draco pause as he wondered for a moment if there was a feast, a holiday he had forgotten. Had there been some sort of notice about it?
Draco shook his head. "No, but it might be why someone called me a 'bewitcher' this morning."
Narcissa smiled sadly at him but offered her hand out, which Harry took and gently shook.
And so, the committee had been born.
The finger's froze in his hair, and Harry forced himself to breathe calmly. He had been thinking it for nearly a week, but now it was out in the open and Draco was only silent in response.
Fucking hell.
“Yell?” Teddy’s voice wobbles. “Push, yell? Mean. Why mean, Day-o?”
There was a pause, most of the girls awkwardly fidgeting with their bags or their hair, but several shared pitying looks. The girl who had spoken before just sighed and patted his arm.
Without much argument against that logic, Harry had agreed and was now more or less Hermione's auditor. As Slughorn began their lesson and started going around to inspect everyone's potions so far, Harry pulled out his notes and quill. But Hermione was just stirring, so Harry set them on the desk and moved around their table with the guise of seeing better into their cauldron, though his eyes were on Draco.
The night is calm, though, betraying nothing out of place as Draco waits tensely for several heavy moments. When his nerves reach a peak, can’t take anymore, he finally turns and hurries into the Leaky Cauldron and to the Disapparation point. He imagines he can hear footsteps soft behind him the entire way, but Draco doesn’t have a particularly good imagination.
A humid breeze licks at his face. Did Tom walk him to the door? The barman is nowhere to be seen, though, and the road appears empty enough for Draco to stumble across it safely. Stagnant air, pressing tight against him, then warmth. Draco hears a disembodied and husky voice coming from somewhere in the bizarre mix of colors in front of him.
“Much better now,” he says after a moment’s thought. “We had our issues at the start, but we’re doing well now, I believe.”
Right?
“I don’t believe you’re permitted to tell a patient about your personal life, healer.”
Hands balled into fists in his pockets and teeth furiously grinding together, Draco turns on his heel and all but stomps out of the office.
"Well, not everyone can have a baby the normal way."
Draco shoots another shot of Firewhiskey at the Leaky Cauldron’s bar, grateful for Tom’s understanding silence as he beckons for another. Although, intuitive as the barman likely is, Draco’s inclined to believe that it’s simply his own face that’s putting Tom off speaking to him than anything. Draco’s skin is pastier than usual against the swollen red flesh around his eyes and nose from all the damn crying he’s done in the last eighteen hours. Potter certainly knows how to press Draco’s buttons, but the comment comparing his own raising with his current attempt at parenting cut too close to the core of Draco’s worst fears, to all his fears and insecurities with raising Teddy.
Across the front page of the paper that Hermione was offering them, dated nearly a week previous, was the bolded headline:
"Well, come one, then, Draco," his mother said, leading the way up the front steps and knocking confidently on the wreathed door.
she says with a precise wave of her wand. Teddy’s cries are cut off instantly. Somehow, the quiet born from the charm is louder.
"Maybe you'll talk if you've got enough fire under you."
"Oh, no, nothing like that..." Harry ran his hand through his hair and looked out a nearby window. Not that he didn't trust Hermione to handle it with grace and discretion, but telling her about what had happened did not appeal to him. Knowing him, he'd likely tell the story wrong and give off the wrong impression of what had happened and why it had happened.
Harry started, but it was just Ron returning from the storeroom himself with an armload of ingredients.
The old witch tuts, shaking her head slightly. “There is nothing that prohibits you from seeing Teddy as far as the laws go, no. But as Mr. Potter is now responsible for the boy, it is entirely up to him who has access to Teddy, myself and Jameson being the obvious exception.”
Draco nodded. "Yeah, just...still new. I wasn't ready."
Two minutes.
"It was in the corridor just now, someone called me a-"
that.”
"My entire family's been in Gryffindor," she said quietly. "I'm the first Slytherin in...well, I think forever."
“Oh, I’ll have more of Teddy before long,” Draco says lazily. “I’m not even concerned, really.”
McGonagall had been nearly beyond words when she, Ron, and Madam Pomfrey had arrived in the corridor. She had ordered Josh, Conrad, Maddox, and Cooper to her office, telling them that she would deal with them later, before tending to Malfoy with Madam Pomfrey. It was only over twenty-four hours later, when Harry was stumbling out of the hospital wing, that he saw her again and thought to ask what had come of the sixth years.
Josh's eyes were wide and vacant, as though not really seeing Harry. "I was just trying to keep my little sister safe," he said blankly.
Weasley glowered. "It's not about your friends, because Malfoy certainly isn't one of them."
Harry laughed. "'Plenty of girls'? I dated two, and I wouldn't even count the first one. Bloody nightmare, she was. Always crying, and I could never say the right thing. Besides, weren't you with Pansy for like...four years or something equally outrageous?"
"Draco?"
"Mmhm."
Harry's ears rang slightly at the abrupt silence that met him after the roar of the winds. The shop was larger than it looked from the outside and was a bit dusty smelling. Other than the fact that all the shelves were hardly more than a meter tall, Harry was fiercely reminded of the Hogwarts library.
"Well...I..." Draco drowned the rest of his tea, now lukewarm, in one gulp and set it noisily on the counter. "I ought to try and sleep. You know...big day..."
Hermione followed Harry's glare.
Several seconds of silence follow in which a Chase seems to struggle with himself behind a perfectly composed facade. But Draco is prepared to fight; he is not ready to sort through what losing his mother means to him.
“Oh, my, that never grows old. The bluntness of children, yes?”
tell me you know how babies are made. Please, Harry, don't make me explain that to you."
“Okay, but really; what if I trip?”
"I really couldn't care less, you fuckwit."
Bewilderment covered Draco's face, but it quickly gave way to annoyance.
"Hey," Harry said, grabbing Draco's chin and tilting his face up until their eyes finally met. "It's...look, she's just-"
“I deal enough with Potter. I don’t need him in here, too.”
"Malfoy," Hermione repeated. "Have you seen him?"
“Ha-wee! You back!”
“I just- well, it seemed like the best idea,” he stammers. “I mean, Teddy doesn’t know Fleur or Mrs. Weasley almost at all, and it seemed like a fair idea to try since- well, I mean, since Teddy lived with Malfoy before and already knows him, and Teddy so far seems to really like it, and-”
Harry shrugs, far more casual than he feels. “Just break it. I can help with the fee.”
Swallowing, Draco said, "You don't want to be my friend."
It was an old-looking building called Tomes and Scrolls, and as far as Harry knew, few students frequented the place. The Hogwarts library had most everything a student could possibly need or want, including a large collection of both wizarding and muggle novels. But Harry knew he had seen Malfoy enter, and he took a breath of sharp, cold air, coughed a bit for it, and stepped inside.
Harry sighed and closed his eyes. He had learned to take things as they came from the moment he had entered the wizarding world. There wasn't any reason to change that now.
"I...well, no, not really."
drinking.
But with lessons over and the train due to take those returning home for the holidays to London the following morning, Harry felt less inclined to keep bundled as he pressed his bare chest against Draco's, fiercely kissing him against the bed below.
Within mere hours after taking Teddy home, Harry had the harsh realization that he really only had a vague idea of what was Teddy’s ‘typical behavior.’ Prior to being all Teddy has left, Harry only took Teddy on the occasional outing about every other weekend or met with Andromeda and Teddy for a meal a couple times a month. If he’s completely honest with himself, especially after this week, Harry can only answer such a question with partial certainty.
obviously is still alright with printing gossip, but they're not going to hide anything or report blatant lies anymore. That's why the article had been written as it had."
It didn't matter.
Hermione's gaze intensified, and Harry willed himself not to look too guilty. He shrugged sheepishly, and she sighed, pulling out her notes and handing them over.
The tray was unsteady, made to fold and slide behind the couch, and a rather full cup of coffee on it shook dangerously when Teddy pulled on it. The cup rattled, splashing some of the dark liquid onto the tray. Draco lunged forward as two of the tray's legs began to lift off the floor. With one hand, Draco snatched the cup to prevent it from spilling everywhere, and with the other hand, he smacked his palm on the tray, steadying it as Teddy finally found his feet.
"Come on."
“Wet.”
As the rest of the class murmured their agreement, Draco kept his eyes down. He felt as though he were beginning to suffocate, but he didn't dare draw attention to himself by asking to be excused.
"So," Harry began. "Come here often?"
Halloween had always been such an exciting time for Harry. This year felt different for more than one reason, namely the cost the previous year had on his general happiness, but this was also the first Halloween that Harry knew it was the anniversary of his parents' murders. Perhaps seventeen years of never knowing this fact had something to do with it, but Harry didn't feel particularly sad over it. As it had been his entire life, Halloween was just another day. In a way, he was grateful for it. It made it easier to think about them.
"Doesn't matter."
need to do is call each other by our first names. Teddy has no idea who we’re talking about half the time.”
“Yeah, I’ve got time,” Harry says with a glance at his watch. Malfoy has to work at five, but he only works the register at a potions shop. “What’s up?”
A wild laugh bursts from Draco’s mouth. Everything spins dangerously as he then free-falls hundreds of fathoms into a void he cannot see.
"Harry, I have never
"Right...uh, I will be," Draco said. He pushed off the counter and gave his mother a soft peck on the cheek. "I'm a bit tired from the train and all. I think I'll take a hot bath and rest."
"Mmm," Draco hummed, stretching his neck against Harry's grip, trying to kiss him again.
“You just said-”
Brows rising up his withered old head, the barman complies.
"Er...good."
"You said it back this time," he commented.
“You pick him up every day at four; why should today be any different?”
"No bloody idea," Ron said, face relaxing. "I'm just glad I have Hermione to do all the...ah...I mean, to help me out."
He became aware of the softness of a warm bed beneath him, though he couldn't remember the walk to his dormitory. He must have stumbled his way back after Josh and his friends had their fun.
“Does that include sleeping with you?” Harry teases over the tension. “I’ve seen him with you in the mornings sometimes. You ought to relax about trying to get him to grow up.”
"Harry!" she called in a hushed voice, waving her arm and gesturing for him to join them.
Excited whispers hissed across the quiet of the dungeon, though Slughorn didn't make to quiet them. He simply beamed back at the class for a moment before waving his wand, instructions appearing on the board.
The class fell still. Draco frowned. He didn't remember seeing that on the ingredient list.
“Understandable, given the circumstances.” Mr. Cook withdraws a roll of parchment from the bag Ms. Dribble laid on the loveseat. He sits. “Has he been overly reserved, do you believe?” With a wave of his wand, a harsh black quill appears and begins taking notes on its own accord. Frustrating memories from Harry’s fourth year spring to mind at the sight.
“How are you doing it?” he caves, dropping all pretense.
"Thank you," he murmured to Madam Pomfrey as he passed her by.
Draco’s heart is pounding. His shins are aching, his sides are cramping, his lungs are burning with the desperation with which he runs. Only blackness is before him, and Draco runs blindly from the horrors at his ankles. Though he can’t see it, the earth drops into a chasm only meters from him, and the moment he feels it’s right, Draco launches into the air. Yet his jump is ill-timed. He falls, falls into an abyss so deep that even his intuition can’t predict the depth. Draco’s stomach disappears and his blood turns to ice as he falls further and further into nothingness, his death racing up on him with terrifying speed.
"He thinks he deserves it," Harry said.
"Alright."
It was
"Oi! You awake in there?"
A minute or two ends up being four hours. It’s only by chance that Harry happens to hear his alarm beeping from the living room in time to shower and leave for work. His body aches from being twisted up with Teddy in the minuscule, stiff, plastic-wrapped toddler bed, which makes training a real living hell. For six straight hours Harry, Ron, and the other trainees sit in rigid metal chairs for paper exams, further stiffening his muscles, only given reprieve in stretching when the physical exams begin in the afternoon. Still, he doesn’t perform quite as well as he typically does. He doesn’t come in last, though, so Harry won’t write the day off as a total loss.
Teddy completely loses it.
"I actually did have a letter I need to send."
“Teddy, I’m back,” Harry calls as he Apparates into Malfoy’s living room.
“Maybe because I’m not what you’ve always made me out to be!” Without meaning to, Draco’s voice falters. All the hours being forced to sift through his deepest emotions and memories and shortcomings creep out now, at the worst possible time, lacing through his words, soaking them with the thinly-veiled depression there. “Maybe I was just a bloody child caught on the wrong side of things! You think I wanted to end up where I did?”
“Er...sorry I’m a bit late.”
Malfoy raised his eyebrows. "All these years, I thought I was just being a prat calling you bad at Potions. Turns out, you actually have no idea what you're doing?"
Hermione rolled her eyes. "Honestly, Ron, can't you tell that he's changed this year?"
Harry makes a face. “Convince me? I
"I'll be up in a bit, mate."
"Just what I've always heard." Draco shrugged. "We're both ruthless and seek a certain kind of justice. Our methods are just a bit different."
“Nooo.” The whining is bordering on the decibel that can only reach canines. Draco screws his eyes up at the sound, but Potter only looks all the more determined, trying to force a loose-limbed toddler back into his chair to sit.
Harry leans against the countertop several paces away as he nods. “We went both yesterday and today. Teddy loves it. The playscape’s much taller than the muggle ones, so I had to keep him from jumping to his death every few minutes-”
The entire thing is full of produce. Harry stares, a bit amazed that for such a large refrigerator, Malfoy has managed to fill almost every nook and cranny with fresh leafy things and fruits and strange vegetables Harry can’t name. There are a handful of sauce jars and some milk, but otherwise-
"Hermione, how-"
"I would encourage you not to be too harsh a judge of Mr. Malfoy's fear."
Overly aware that Draco was somewhere right beside him, Harry sighed. "I know that, Hermione, but how do you explain that to someone else? To Draco?"
"Why're you so tired?" Draco asked as Harry stifled another yawn.
“Because if you wet the couch, it’ll be harder to clean than your bed, that’s all,” Harry says gently. “You’re not in trouble.”
“You are. You’re just nervous about the ceremony part.”
Karen glanced over at the table of first years and shrugged. "To be honest, I'd rather sit here with you for now."
He groaned.
"Don't be. They argued plenty before I decided to get too friendly with you." Harry grinned at him, but as their lesson drew to a close and their shrubs were collected, Draco felt increasingly guilty over the trouble he had caused by simply existing.
“Had you ever considered doing something in potions before all this?” Harry asks. “Maybe not the apothecary, but something else that required the skill?”
Draco hasn’t replied, but his chewing can be heard in the evening hush. When several seconds pass, though, Harry looks over, fully expecting that condescending squint, smug insults on the top of his tongue, ready for deployment the moment he swallows.
“Right.”
"I've been telling everyone that for years." Ron grinned. "But for real, Harry. You came out of it, and now that all this crap with Malfoy and the
"Er..."
"What's going on?" Ron, who was following with Hermione and Neville, asked as they descended another staircase. "Why're we worried about Malfoy? He's a big boy, I bet you-"
“Have you found something?”
Harry inched away, hoping her hand would just slip off of him if he did it carefully enough. "Just...I'm not hungry yet."
“Yes, sir.”
"Look," Hermione said calmly, thankfully interrupting his thoughts. "I'm not trying to corner you or give you an identity crisis. I just want to tell you to be careful."
"Well, unlike some people, I'm trying to put the past behind me and get on with my life," he snapped at her.
Draco turns to the final page. “And this is a-”
Draco's mouth went dry. "How, uh...how do you mean?"
“...no?”
"We..." Draco swallowed. "We should get back to our dormitories...before...before Carraway comes back."
“Are you just now getting back?” Malfoy asks.
She had said it so softly that Draco contemplated pretending he hadn't heard her. But his mother deserved more respect than that. He carefully removed his plate and hers from the island and moved to set them in the large sink before answering.
"Hermione?" Harry asked, unable to hold back another moment. She turned and looked at him. "Is...is there anything you can do? I don't know how long Ron's going to be."
Malfoy nodded. "Easy enough. You work on Baneberry, it's the simplest."
Madam Pince whipped around the shelves, eyes bulging. "What did I tell you?!"
"Oh. Sorry I was just-"
It’s not his. Draco stares at the back of it, adrenaline making him a bit stupid, before realizing that Teddy must be awake. He throws back the covers, opens his door a fraction to peer into the living room.
He chuckled bodily to himself as he walked back to the front of the room. Harry sneaked a glance at Malfoy, but it seemed that the praise had gone unheard. His eyes were trained on the same spot, back just as rigid, breathing just as strained.
But Teddy did.
Draco stopped Harry from leading them back to the party. Harry looked back, knowing he had to be looking at Draco with just as sappy a look in his eyes as Draco was giving him, and it was perfect. He leaned in and kissed Draco's lips, hands coming to rest on his face as Draco's wrapped around Harry's waist. Endless love and devotion poured from one set of lips to the other, filling them both up more than they could ever hope to contain.
"Could've just used a spell."
Mmm," Draco humming between them. "Not wanting any visitors?"
But admitting it to the Care-Seekers, who hold Teddy’s fate in their hands by judgement of Harry’s capabilities, doesn’t seem wise.
And just like that, the realization hits Draco strangely, crystal clear, harsh in its contrast to the softness of the waiting room: Teddy is going to grow up. He won’t be little forever. He won’t ask Draco to sing him songs forever. He won’t survive solely on rice, yogurt, and fish forever. He won’t stack blocks forever. One day, Teddy will grow up.
"I don't think that's how this works."
“If you think you’re just going to up and
at him.
"Being...being civil...to me."
Teddy or some other-”
“Do...do you sit with him until he falls asleep every night?”
"The night Dumbledore was killed," Potter continued when Draco remained quiet.
Face a brilliant magenta, Hermione drew herself up in as dignified a stance as she could. "That's really none of your business."
“I know how much Teddy means to you,” she says. “And I feel awful about what I said about how another family might’ve been better suited to raise him. I...I don’t want to tell you what to do. I haven’t a clue as to what children really need; I’m so far from ready, and yet you are tackling the challenge head-on. Just like you always do.” She lets out a noise like the cross between a giggle and a scoff. “I believe you can do this all on your own, Harry, I truly do. I also know that you want what is in Teddy’s best interests. From everything you’ve told Ron and me...Malfoy is a part of that. Being closer to him can't be all that bad if Teddy's found so much worthwhile there, surely?”
"So I think what you meant to say was 'thank you'."
“I have regular hours and a salary-”
Harry chuckled softly, ignoring the mild hurt that pulsed in his chest. It wasn't his place to force Draco to love him back, and as Draco hadn't thrown him from his bed at the phrase, Harry tried to take it as a win. Or at least not a loss.
“Did you hear me, Teddy?”
It was unnerving, her uninhibited honesty delivered with such a sweet voice. Draco pushed off the wall and made to walk away, but the Lovegood girl followed him.
Draco looked down the Slytherin table and spotted her among a group of first years. He nodded, and Luna smiled.
"Hermione," Harry said, confused. "How could you possibly say or believe that after...everything?"
She shrugged. "Well, she is."
"Shit," Potter said. "Shit, I didn't...I didn't mean to do this...I didn't..."
“Oh, has Teddy fallen asleep?” Mr. Cook asks as they step inside.
"Blimey, it's cold," Ron muttered at Harry's side. "Let's get a drink, eh?"
As Harry put his wand away, he hardly dared to breathe as Carraway drew closer, her wandlight casting shadows through the crack under the door as she checked the doors along the corridor. Harry's chest was pressed against Draco, who was leaning against the back of the tiny closet with his hands up as though in surrender, palms barely touching Harry's shoulders. When Harry turned his head forward and away from the door, his nose bumped Draco's.
Harry was beaming at him, green eyes misty.
The heat fuming off of Potter is insatiably amusing. Draco has to bite his lip in an attempt not to laugh when Mr. Cook grins, eyes shining with pride.
The following morning, Harry sat up in bed, actually awake this time, rubbing his eyes as hard as he could. There was no way this little sleep was good for him. Between the nightmares and his violent tossing and turning, Harry was lucky to get a couple hours of sleep a night. Before returning to school, it had hadn't mattered. But now, he was expected to be up early and be productive throughout the day, not to mention staying up late to tackle the mountain of homework that was likely to accumulate by the end of the week. Already he had a four-feet-long essay over the different ways one could use transfiguration magic to conceal their identity, and with Potions, Charms, and Defense Against the Dark Arts coming up that day, he was likely to receive more.
“Just just have to do as your told and not vomit for about half an hour, then it’s over. You can manage that.”
"I suppose we ought to get moving, then, hm?" Harry asked.
Draco's head tilted back as he moaned openly, subconsciously thrusting up into Harry's hand and then back down on his finger. Harry's finger sunk all the way in at the movement, and Draco's muscles tightened around him. But Draco didn't seem uncomfortable, nearing on the exact opposite as he crashed his lips back to Harry's in a desperate kiss. Harry began to twist his hand on Draco's cock, sliding it up and down and keeping his other hand as still as he could while Draco came up and down on his finger.
Still, he wraps his hand around his wand in his pocket.
"It's a bit different than we used to eat," she said. "But I think it's about time for a change, wouldn't you agree?"
“Speaking of that,” Harry says, sitting up straighter, “what we
"'S'at still 'lright?" he mumbled, trying to blink away the sleep.
Seeing the anger burn in those green eyes gives Draco great pleasure. It’s ritualistic as much as it is active, sought, the goal for the past eight damn years. But the triumph of winding Potter up so quickly is fleeting in the present, dampened when Draco remembers his predicament, Ms. Dribble’s words. He needs Potter’s approval to see Teddy.
"Professor Flitwick will continue his former duties as well as taking on the role of deputy headmaster."
"What do you mean, what everyone's talking about?" Harry asked.
"Er...come again?"
But was it too late? The image of Harry's retreating back in the snow, not even glancing back, flashed in his head.
He groaned inwardly. Of course the Lovegood girl would be an early riser, even on the weekend. Without invitation, she dropped into the seat beside him and reached for some cereal and the pitcher of orange juice.
"I take it back.
"So suggesting a drink at the Three Broomsticks is out of the question?"
“And second of all, you really ought to consider it. What would the real harm be? Too, it would likely save the both of you some time and effort if you aren’t popping across London everyday. Besides, your schedules are pretty opposite, isn’t that right?”
He was back to being totally alone.
"Hermione make you?"
“What? What do you do? Toss him on the bed and walk out?”
"You-you-" he stuttered, climbing onto shaking knees. "You absolute-you-"
"What?" Harry asked, looking just as bewildered as Draco felt.
"Have you finished packing for school?"
"You missed breakfast," she said, pointing at the paper. "And dinner last night. You wouldn't have noticed yet, but you and Draco are all anyone's talking about, and it's all thanks to whatever idiot at the
“Stop calling me that,” Draco snaps.
"Let's skip the formalities, shall we? Narcissa and I already cleared away most of the awkwardness." She pulled back and surveyed Draco closely at arm's length. "You look good. A bit ill, perhaps, but good."
All Draco could do was nod.
“Park.”
"I'm not letting people get away with it, even if you're not going to help." Harry finally released Malfoy's cloak and took a step back. Malfoy stayed against the wall, looking increasingly lost. "I didn't go through all the hell I did just to let some stupid kids keep acting like this."
Hermione snorted. "No, Harry, her womb."
"Potter is a constant fixture in our media," she said "A hero, whereas our name is...not what it used to be. Being Potter's friend just might bring you a certain publicity that you might not find flattering, is all. So just...be aware."
“Come on, Teddy, just a bite?”
"These particular potions, in addition to their longer stewing periods, also require more specific and unique ingredient details. Some might ask you to drop in a very specified amount only under the light of a full moon. Some may require you to sing to it while you stir. You will likely feel a bit foolish during the next few weeks, but if you put in the work, the reward will be great."
Also edited chapter 3 but only the Horcrux part.
"Harry came to Gringotts three days ago," Alrod began, capturing the shock adults' attention, "He was without his Gringotts key so he was required to do a blood test, which then revealed issues that have since then been solved. It was what prompted Lord Potter to attain his Lordship."
“Well,” Harry began, “I’m planning on checking out the properties you gave me that are habitable, as well as meeting the house-elves from each house. I’ll probably assign them some cleaning or maintaining work, nothing too big. Then, I suppose I could check to see what I’ll need after I found which house I’ll stay in—necessities, furniture, and possibly clothes, food. Then, when I’m settled, I’ll buy for my Hogwarts things.”
“Do I need to meet them?”
escalators).
Alrod nodded in response.
“It is because of this, most probably, why your godfather had blood adopted you.”
The women gave firm nods from behind Remus, and even Snape had nodded too. Seeing this, Harry glanced at Alrod, who gave a nod. He gestured for the adults to be seated again before addressing them.
Uldrick let out curses under his breath in Gobbledegook—Harry assumed he was swearing, it felt like he was swearing.
Fortunately, this year, Harry had all his books with him. Normally, they'd be in his trunk, which would immediately be confiscated by Vernon and locked in the cupboard under the stairs, but thanks to a little something Hermione introduced to him called Owl Order, he was able to buy a new trunk that was resizable with a tap of the wand, no magic necessary. He placed all his books, parchment, and stationary there before he left Hogwarts, shrinking his trunk and hiding it in his pocket, while his old trunk housed only his clothes, although he did pack some newer, well fitted, clothes in his new trunk, just in case he needed to run away again. One can never be too prepared and all that muck.
(See the end of the chapter for
He stopped thinking about it.
“Ow! What the—“
“You can contact them whenever you wish; they will all wait for you. Though, some of them might need to meet you to receive their orders on what to do with the houses they are in. You simply wish to see them and they will arrive,” Alrod adds, knowing he wouldn’t know. Harry nods gratefully.
He went inside the pub, playing with his fringe, lest he gets sighted—although he shouldn't really, no one would see as he had covered it up with a Band-Aid.
"Coming, uncle Vernon!" Harry replies, dropping his Hogwarts letter by his cupboard, using his foot to slide it under the door. His older self warned him that his relatives might try to take it from him. He wouldn't let them.
"Issues? What issues? Did something happen? Will Harry be okay?" The questions came flying out his mouth, concern lacing his voice as he stared back and forth from Alrod to Harry. Harry jumped at the worry present on the scarred man's face, never been directed that kind of look before. The young wizard felt his chest warm at the feelings bubbling there.
Harry was gently pushed back a little and he looked up to see Corvus' grinning face, "Only death could make me leave now and not even then, mon petit vert!" Harry laughed. He laughed because he knew that his cousin was half meant what he said in his jest. He laughed because his cousin was home—not home at the Dursleys but with him. He laughed because even if his life wasn't normal, and he had weird dreams, and danger lurked in every corner of his life, it would be alright, because Corvus was home.
“There are nine properties you can live in, Harry, that are within the UK. There two outside of the UK and the rest are unsuitable for living in. Oaken Ranch is to be given to Remus Lupin.”
Then comes a tapping at the door.
Leaving him alone with Teddy, Andromeda and Draco's mother vanished into the adjacent kitchen.
“The Ministry has pushed for these reformations to be swift,” Planters continues, correctly interpreting the murmurs breaking out. “Swift but thought-out, as there has been increasing unrest inside the prison.” He pauses, scanning through the scroll in his hand. “Now, let’s run through these policies. To begin-”
"Looking forward to the holiday?" Harry asked.
“Good afternoon,” Harry replies. His voice sounds hoarse.
Harry smiles as he helps Ron straighten the collar of his brand new dress robes. “You’re not going to trip. You’re going to be fine.”
“Knowing me, I won’t.”
Draco slowed to a stop at the shout. He had learned early in the year that running only made things worse. Turning slowly on the spot, Draco found himself face to face with three furious but shockingly tiny Ravenclaws. The top of the tallest one's head wouldn't have bumped Draco's chin. Though his chest began to heave with anticipation, he couldn't help but wonder how old they were. Maybe he lucked out and they weren't old enough to do much damage.
Harry glanced around them. The whispering seemed to grow more confused and angry, but he just dropped back into his seat, dragging Draco by the waist into the spot beside him.
at me," he snapped, making to stand up.
"Please...please don't," Harry said into Draco's ear. "Ron's...he's a...nothing he said was true, Draco. No one wants...no one
"And some couples can't because they're gay."
"Well, you didn't seem the type to me, either. I don't really think it's something you can tell just by looking at a person."
They hold each other’s gaze for several moments too long.
Potter was looking right back at him, and it took a lot in Draco not to look away. In the past, he would have glared or made a face, but now he simply stared back. After a few moments, Potter's lips twitched into the smallest of smiles before returning to his conversation with Longbottom. Draco watched Potter a moment more before he realized that Weasley's eyes were on him. Draco did drop his gaze then, not wanting to see the justified hate there.
“It’s never too early.”
The ceremony goes just as flawlessly as Harry predicted to Ron an hour ago. Ginny strides down the aisle first, stunning, glowing in the near-sunset light, followed by Hermione and her father. Ron’s jaw actually drops when Hermione steps into view, and quite frankly, Harry’s sure his does, too. Her hair is sleek, similar to how she did it for the Yule Ball but not quite as elaborate, and her robes are the kind of simple silk that reminds Harry of expensive book pages, something that Hermione wears well. With the sun kissing at the horizon just beyond the altar and likely blinding the seated crowd, Ron and Hermione marry, beaming like fools under the charm and sharing their first kiss much to the crowd’s ecstatic cheers.
“Yeah?”
“Why?”
Grin turning gentle, Draco stands to shelve the guitar. “Not just now, little one. I’ll be needing to leave for work soon.”
He freezes on the landing.
“Look, you can take Monday or nothing!”
“A touch?” Ms. Dribble barks. “That place was basically a closet with a balcony.”
She shot him a sharp look. "Didn't you take your own notes? It wasn't as if you had much to distract you."
She fixed him with an uncertain look as she bit her lip. "I saw you bring Malfoy into your dormitory, Harry."
"W'sss 'appen'd?" Draco's question barely passed as actual words. Even to himself, it sounded as though he were speaking Troll.
"Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy!" Slughorn boomed as she approached their desk, causing Malfoy to jump. "I must say, I was immensely impressed with your De-Aging Solution! Not a thing wrong with it! Top marks, top marks, and most curious, too..." He trailed away and eyed them with a peculiar smirk. "Anyway, excellent work, my boys! In fact, I might just use it on myself later."
"And you!" she shouted at someone behind Harry. "Serving him! Since when did you serve students? I ought to report you!"
"You didn't have to."
"That...that sounds great, Mother."
In the same moment, Draco and Potter move forward to offer comfort. But Teddy flinches so harshly away from Draco that he smacks into the door frame. His lips quiver. He hurries into Potter’s open arms, buries his face into his chest.
any Dark stuff was going on." She took her hand off his, eyeing him carefully as Harry started to slice again. "It was a very cleverly worded article. It made all this nonsense about Draco tricking you with Dark Magic into being his friend sound like fact, but it never once said anything was definitive. Even the section about Narcissa, it just mentioned that
As Mrs. Weasley wiped her eyes, everyone else began to load their plates.
“Toy!” Teddy suddenly squeals, turning to race into the little bedroom he and Harry share. Harry hopes it’s to do as he asked.
"Well, I think I ought to catch some sleep," he said, quickly tossing his school things away and standing up. Neither Ron nor Hermione looked at him.
Harry looks up at the large platform that’s been constructed on the grounds. Indeed, Kingsley Shacklebolt, the most suitable Minister of Magic Harry’s known so far, is striding across the stage toward a podium at the center.
How adjusted are the Care-Seekers expecting Teddy to be after a single week? Harry’s unsure of the correct answers, of what Mr. Cook is looking for as far as Teddy folding into Harry’s new life, and he hesitates. Torn between telling the truth and potentially losing the Care-Seekers’ confidence and lying and definitely losing the Care-Seekers’ confidence, Harry’s words fail him. A dense silence fills the tiny living space. Several seconds tick by, and Mr. Cook waits.
A door opened somewhere over their heads and Draco tilted his head back to see the look on his mother's and aunt's faces when they saw him with Teddy. He hoped it would make his mother smile, maybe ease some of the worry he knew Andromeda was likely still feeling.
“You stole the sun from my-
"If they started all this just to hurt Draco, they didn't give thought to how this is hurting me, too."
Draco shifted uncomfortably. "Technically, I have."
A small, hopeful smile tugged at Draco's lips. "Maybe."
“Where do you keep your sobering potions?” Potter asks.
is really transforming you, you know.”
"I think that's up to you."
"Dinner's nearly ready," he said. "Mum says you ought to wash up."
“No, but tucking him in with a few kind words and leaving him to fall asleep on his own teaches him independence. You’re coddling him.”
It should have stirred some alarm, some anxiety, some emotion besides joy in Draco's heart to hear Weasley proclaiming that he was about to offer his formal apologies. But the fog of bliss protected his heart and his lungs, keeping him breathing evenly as he simply beamed at Weasley.
"I...I don't know what you think it is I'm doing to you," he began. "But I don't want to cause any trouble. I just...I just want things to be right. I want to make them right again."
Doubt flickered among the emotions in Malfoy's eyes.
Soft footfalls echoed in the stairwell behind Harry, and they both froze. Hardly an inch separated their faces.
"See? It's not just me, and Hermione has only once been accused of trying to save someone."
Waving his wand frantically, Harry Vanishes the smoke that fills the kitchen as quickly as he can, one cubic sectional at a time. The clock reads only a few minutes until six, and Draco is due to return from his appointment any second. Harry does
“Teddy was not in the manor at the time of the explosion, no.”
Harry shakes himself. He doesn’t need to think of that now. Not any of it.
"I thought we were keeping the...er...affection private for now."
For the first time in years, Draco was angry. He had felt nothing but fear, depression, and emptiness since his sixth year, which only increased as the war progressed. But now, as he laid on his bed in the wake of his bewildering encounter with Potter, Draco actually felt angry.
“Well, Harry,” Mr. Cook says with a wave of his wand, “thank you for your time.” The quill and parchment drop all signs of life, falling into the wizard’s hands. “We have the little we need at this time, and we will be returning in precisely three weeks, on Friday, the 24th of March, for a more thorough interview and inspection once both of you have had some time to settle.”
"Well, I doubt any teacher would say anything to you," Draco said, eyes turning back to the darkness beyond the ledge.
The little girl sniffled again, but she smiled. "Thank you."
But with little choice, Harry removed his own cloak, robes, and shoes, stripping down to just as much clothing as he had left on Malfoy, and slipped under the blankets and into the bed.
"Okay."
“What’s up?”
The doorknob rattled at Harry's back, though it only stirred vague alarm as he sensed rather than saw Draco lick his lips.
He can hear a conversation murmuring through from the living room as Teddy vanishes into it. Disposing of the food no one is likely to eat at this point, Draco takes a small breath, readies himself, then exits the kitchen.
Alone again, Harry looked back to kiss Draco.
Draco raised his brows at her. "What's with the enthusiasm?"
“That’s a common feeling among parents. All your love for the
“It’s his
"Come on, Malfoy, I'm not actually an idiot." Harry said it specifically to try and goad Malfoy into maybe throwing the word back at him as an insult, but Malfoy only gulped and turned his back to Harry.
Panting as quietly as he could, Draco looked up at his name. Harry was still seated beside him, though it looked like the lesson was over. Students filed out of the greenhouse around them. Their whispers and their glares only made Draco shake even more.
“This is a red circle.”
makes it sound, you know. I'd bet more people than you think aren't that messed up."
The manor was nearly just as he had left it - much too cold, far too dark, conspicuously void of anything that had once made it a
Mrs. Weasley's eyes narrowed slightly. "Well, it'll be good to have a full education. I'm glad somebody could talk some sense into you."
Around his own mouthful of food, Draco grumbles something too quiet to hear, but Harry can see the tightening in his cheeks, trying to hold back his own satisfaction to save some mental sort of face.
Irritation keeps Harry from relaxing. Harry pushes off the couch, goes to peek in on Teddy, Malfoy and his independence fetish be damned. But when he sees through the darkness of Teddy’s room that the blankets are still, the air without noise, there’s a hesitation in Harry. He creeps closer to the tiny bed to kneel down, almost hopeful to find Teddy awake and silently crying so he can comfort the distress that Malfoy caused.
“And you don’t have it,” Tom says. But his voice is kind. Sympathetic.
Draco hissed, breaking their kiss and thrusting back onto Harry's finger, barely one knuckle inside of him.
"Yeah. I saw the owl on the grounds and thought it was pretty, so I went to pet it, and it had a letter with your name on it." Karen offered a rolled piece of parchment out to him.
“That’s not what the hell-”
“Why?”
They had reached the castle steps, and Harry slipped his way into the entrance hall behind Professor McGonagall. The castle was hardly considered warm, but without the wind slapping Harry repeatedly, it felt as though stepping into a furnace. He sighed contentedly.
"Oh. Because you knew you were gay, or...?"
If he wasn't so intoxicated by the Fire Whiskey, Harry might have been terrified of her. But he walked alongside Professor McGonagall through the village, feeling nothing but sadness and confusion at his own personal relationship troubles. Somewhere behind the alcohol, though, he thought he ought to be more concerned with the fact that he was likely moments away from finally being expelled.
“Having help raise a child is important,” he says. “Many single parents struggle not just with supporting a child on one income but also managing the stress of parenting. It is not a requirement to have a spouse, obviously, but being on your own will add to what is already a stressful situation, which is why your marital status is of slight concern.
"Well, Slytherins and Gryffindors aren't terribly different when it comes down to it."
"Well, no one wanted you to go about calling people mudbloods again, I'm sure."
"But there's no possible way anyone could think she's done anything Dark!" Hermione said, sounding exasperated. "Not anyone who isn't some dim-witted gossip stirrer anyway."
requested a meeting with me to be a more permanent fixture in Teddy’s life,” he drawls, deliberate in his satisfaction. “I wouldn’t have missed a chance to have my name on the papers for the world.”
“How’re you okay with just letting him starve like that?”
. Harry slid his hand up Draco's back and into his hair, desperate for more, desperate for everything. When their hips lined up without warning, sliding equally excited parts of them both together, Harry moaned softly into Draco's gasp.
Harry's eyes had closed at some point, and Draco was behind his eyelids. Draco was there, hands on him, lips against his, telling him that he loved him.
"No." Malfoy didn't ask what he had meant, confirming all of Harry's suspicions at once.
Malfoy looked as though he would have liked to roll his eyes, and for a moment Harry felt as though he were looking back in time. But the sensation was shattered when Malfoy sighed sadly and looked down. "I don't need protection. Anything that comes my way is well deserved."
He should have leapt from the bed and ran. He should have shoved Potter away from him, shouted at him. But Draco didn't do anything when it became obvious that they were alone. Nearly a full minute ticked by and Draco couldn't bring himself to move.
“Dam.”
“Well, as this is a legally binding document, you both would still be obligated to abide by it. There is nothing in here that outlines the potential for an early expiration, as Harry, Kara, and I all agreed that having the stability for Teddy while Harry is in his training will be beneficial regardless of the guardianship status.”
“Uh...what?”
Only their boxer briefs separated them, and Harry's chest burned as it slid against Draco's skin. A thin sheen of sweat covered them both as Harry kissed and licked Draco's mouth with every bit of passion he had. Fire connected them at every contact and it only seared when Harry grinded his hips against Draco's.
I love you all the same.”
Mrs. Weasley pursed her lips. "Maybe this isn't the right time or place to-"
But Andromeda, who was usually so good at keeping Harry updated on Teddy's life, hadn't once mentioned that the Malfoys would be over for Christmas.
Harry turned back to Malfoy. He had his eyes closed again and was trying to take deep breaths, but his shaking had become so violent that it wasn't proving very possible.
Draco groans harsh, runs a hand over his face. “That’s all well and good for now, but do you intend on using bribery forever just to have him properly use the toilet?”
Teddy squealed happily, waving his arms and kicking his legs with glee.
It wasn't unheard of, but having an odd-House-out in a family was a bit unusual. But Draco didn't think that was what Karen really needed to hear.
“That’s...Merlin, that’s completely mental.”
Fists form at Draco’s lap, clenching hard.
“What sort of interventions?”
"Let you? Boy, you know you've been paying me, right?"
“What did you do?”
"Maybe."
Hurt filled Hermione's eyes. "Well, I haven't seen him since we had our row yesterday, but Dean and Seamus said that he was in the dormitory last night. I just...oh, he can be just horrible sometimes, but I'd rather not...I don't really..."
As he has been each night since moving in with Malfoy, Harry finds himself blinking awake in the dead of night, disoriented. The clock above the front door glows faintly. 1:02am. He slumps back into the cloud-like cushions of the sofa. He’s tired enough as it is without having his sleep interrupted every night for no better reason than not being in his own space.
