He smiled to himself as he remembered that exact moment when Ron had whispered about her common sense in the library. It was so quiet, since they'd been perched at a table in an area of the library that wasn't heavily trafficked. So, naturally, Hermione's face immediately shot up from behind the latest edition of Hogwarts: A History as she heard Ron's less than polite remark. Her nose flared a tiny bit when she was mad, and that coupled with her crossed arms gave them the complete Angry Hermione Look.
and whispering things like 'Come closer my pretties'. If I didn't already know your dream tendencies, I would have assumed you were just some trench coat clad pervert fantasizing about creeping after unsuspecting females." He felt his ears and cheeks immediately pigmenting to a signature Ronald Weasley beet red, embarrassed he'd been mumbling in his sleep, and about mince meat pies of all things. When Hermione saw this, though, her petrifying stare seemed to soften a bit, a teasing glint in her honey brown eyes.
Sorry this one took so long to post, I've got a lot on my plate lately. I hope you enjoy this chapter!
I know my chapters have been shorter and not as good lately, and if you're wondering, it's because I've been super duper stressed out. I've been doing a lot of different things, and along with juggling my school work and mental health, I've realized that it's better to take time off than to keep pushing myself too hard. In summary, I'm calling a brief hiatus to take some time to regroup.
looking at it, and that’s when I realized that in this really tiny fine print, on the front page of the book was
And, most of the time when she’d ask why he was looking rather vexed, he’d answer with something that had to do with dearest Ferret Faced Fucktard. “Oh
Harry was so utterly confused. He followed Ginny and Luna for a good twenty minutes around the school under his invisibility cloak, and they had rounded this one corner, but when HE rounded it, they were completely gone. And there was nothing but a dead end there. He'd walked up to the empty stone wall in front of him, prodding every single stone in it with the tip of his wand, just to see if a passage would open up. But nothing happened.
Weasley took a moment to register who exactly he had run into, and a scowl of his own played on his face as he hissed, "Ferret, you right foul git. Come back to Hogwarts, have you? Well if you know what's good for you, then stay away from me and my friends, for fear that we might hex you to hell and back on sight." After looking slightly contemplative for a split second he added, "Well actually, upon further thought, pop up whenever you like. I wouldn't mind watching you suffer
"Alright then, Harry," Luna said with a soft smile, “Nothing like topping off the night with some light reading.” Harry couldn’t help but release a snort of amusement at her words. She was really something else.
“Lumos.” The hallway lit up in a soft bluish glow, the dust whirling in little spirals around their feet with each step. Luna pressed her palm against a slightly ajar door, pushing it open with a loud screech of old hinges. The room behind it looked as though an elephant had stomped through it.
it burned my eyeballs to look at. Anyways, anyways- I keep getting distracted- I was looking at those words cause they looked super familiar, you know?”
I'm guessing Harry wants to LEAVE your DAMNED CLUTCHES! I've been sitting here for HOURS and-" the blood drained from his face. He looked as though he'd just witnessed Snape himself cartwheeling about with unicorns on a flowery field in mid May.
When the train finally jolted to a stop, Ginny awoke, jumping into an alert sitting position, a Spongify coming halfway out of her mouth, and then stopping as she realized where she was. This caused everyone to put on a amused expression, likely towards the fact that Ginny had been using a Spongify spell to seemingly protect herself, which, unless the objective was to soften something, would prove itself completely futile. When she saw everyone's puzzled faces, she shooed them with her hands, as if to say "OH for god's sake, just get your things and be on with it." Not wanting to further aggravate his grumpy sister, Ron, Harry, and Hermione immediately began rounding up their things, with Ronald pocketing half his snacks and shoveling the remaining amount into his mouth, ignoring the fact that this only reinforced Harry's earlier mock.
“AggGGGGAAA!” He jumped back in surprise, trying to staunch the heavy flow of blood from the gashes. The crimson shone bright against the pallor of his skin in the silver moonlight and the pain was blinding.
"Maybe to the library, we're already heading in that direction, and we can look into this a tad to gather information on what just happened," he responded. His body felt worn out, but his brain was buzzing with curiosity, crossing out sleep from his list of options.
The grass that so softly shifted in the breeze, the ashen clouds rolling above the horizon, the scattered wildflowers, the twigs and stalks poking up from the ground. The serene landscape. The smell of rain dancing around her nose, her patchwork dress, her yellow sweater. The earth beneath her, the sound of the wind in the brush...she’d been here before-
"Luna?" Harry called as he felt his way along one of the many walls of the room, trying to find her in the vast space.
Looking down at the pile of chicken puree in front of him, he swore under his breath at the fact that he'd turned a rather good piece of chicken into rubbish. Ron thought about trying to transfigure it back to its original state, then thought better, fearing he might screw it up and have a chunk of RAW chicken, or even worse, a live chicken in front of him on his dish. So instead, he just started on his next piece of chicken, this time vowing not to turn violent against it for forces it could not control.
"Hermione, I know this is just you acting out of this habit towards all the men in your life, but there's no need to wake up a bloke with such a face like that, you know, you look quite unattractive with that ugly scowl contorting your less than ugly features." This seemed to just make her more irritated than before.
I never thought I'd see the day," Malfoy's scoff came from behind him. Well this was fanbloodytastic. Now he had to deal with the Ferret. He spun around angrily, coming face to face, well actually more chin to forehead, with the blond. He took a step back on autopilot, not wanting to be so close.
It was a considerably startling sight to behold. Draco bit his tongue to stop from calling out as Theo and the Gryffindors suddenly disappeared from his view,
They decided to just go back and meet Hermione at the library in their spare time, and walked briskly away from the wall, Ron practically radiating his anxiety in neon waves. In Harry's preoccupied state, he ran into the corner of the turn instead of around it. But instead of the impact between the wall and him hurting, he fell right through, and kept falling through this new, dark, abyss.
” That name seemed so familiar. Luna felt as though she could almost compile a face to match the name, the person on the tips of her memory. She trained her eyes on the name, taking it in letter for letter, trying to jog some sort of recollection. But the echo of a face to pair with this name stayed locked behind bars in the back of her mind. Luna shook her head softly, and turned her attention back to Theo, who had just reached out to grasp the page between his fingertips. His hand had barely grazed the paper when his body swirled, getting sucked into the book-
" She tapped her finger impatiently on the wooden Gryffindor table, and it made a soft tap, the heavily bitten fingernails barely touching the table with each tap. Harry looked at her sheepishly, opening his mouth to ask her to repeat when a commotion behind caused his head to turn. He didn't NEED to look, of course, he could already quite accurately guess who the source of it was. But he glanced behind anyways, and what he saw and heard caught him off guard completely.
His feelings were just a knot in his stomach. Not guilt, or anything like that. He reckoned it might be an identity crisis of sorts, and for good reason. Draco had no idea what he wanted. Not from his life, not from himself, not from anyone else. He’d just been living in a world where day in and day out, nothing changed.
The earth sealed over the cracks, the grass covered the bare earth once again. Then everything was peaceful, with only the wind whispering softly, the conflict beneath raging on in a cage of roots and soil.
“You’re a fascinating person, you know that, right? Not a bad sort of fascinating, a brilliant sort of fascinating. And pretty amazing if you ask me.”
Not to mention how at the trial, his father had  attempted to drag his own family down with him, stating they joined Voldemort’s forces of their own free will. Absolute bullshite. They’d joined because he’d thrown them head first into it. And every time he’d seen his father since the trial, Lucius had made it clear he wished he’d never defected and let his son undergo whatever fate had planned. Which didn’t exactly make Draco feel entirely good inside, considering he was attempting to break free of his family’s practices and become an entirely different person.
, at least I'm not busy drooling over other people's clothes while dreaming of mince meat pies." With that said, she tossed him a classic Angry Hermione look, and marched off to go read somewhere less Ronald inhabited. He really didn't blame her. Ron had been a real tosser for the last couple of weeks, and only Harry knew why. They had decided to keep it a secret from Hermione.
interest in Harry whatsoever- I’d bet everything I’ve got that he’s only doing this to mess with Harry’s heart,” Ginny growled from the floor.
He narrowed his eyes, the frown on his face deepening as he snarled, "Weasel. Fancy seeing you here."
"Good, pet." Harry savoured the word.  "Yes, I do like that.  Very sexy." Draco blushed adorably, so Harry continued, moving closer to his submissive and pinning him against the wall, holding his arms above his head.  Maybe now was the time to try out the dominance thing.  "You know I've been hard since breakfast.  Having you kneel next to me, take food from me, it turned me on so much." Dove gave a little moan and Harry smiled.  "Not yet, baby.  But when I claim you I'll make you feel so good."
They hurried along the gallery, past the chapel and into the Salon of Hercules, where Harry had first met the King.  From there, there was a seemingly endless succession of Salons, each as richly decorated with paintings and marble as the last.  Finally they left the War Salon and entered the Hall of Mirrors.  Lisette was standing in the Hall in front of the entrance to the Council Cabinet with Belle in her arms.
“Nope.” That was definitely Ron. Harry loved it when Ron came to visit, it got Draco fluffed up like an angry cat.
“She dislikes being back in Versailles, she remains in her rooms most of the time.”  Malfoy hesitated.  “And she is most displeased with me at the moment.”
Malfoy was curled in his chair with his feet under him, and he looked over at Harry, his eyes sharp, face inscrutable.  “It’s a very sad story, actually.  Allegra Zabini was born Allegra Borgia.  The Borgias are a powerful Italian family, like many others their power in the muggle world has dwindled just as their influence in our world has waxed.  Allegra is the only child of Alfonso Borgia, and she fell in love with a poor count from Sicily, Cesare Zabini, but her father would not allow the match.  They eloped to Venice and were married in secret and had Blaise.  When Allegra’s family found out they had her husband killed.  It changed Allegra greatly.  She had known my mother at court, so she placed her son in my family’s care and went to travel the world.  She takes husbands as she sees fit, but none of them measure up to her first love.  She finds it too difficult to be around her son, he reminds her too much of Cesare.”
Once Belle had had enough of her flirting with the bigger dogs, she got to her feet and greeted Malfoy as a long lost friend.  She jumped as far as her diminutive frame would allow up his leg and made pleased little huffs under her breath.  Malfoy scooped her up and held her against his chest.
Harry’s youth and inability to take part in politics had not prevented Scrimgeour, the new Minister for Magic, from calling at Harry’s new home and attempting a crude political seduction.  Scrimgeour was sure Harry would see the wisdom in the measures that he wished to impose to combat Voldemort’s return.  He elaborated only briefly on what these measures might be, and made it clear that he expected Harry’s very public support of any and all actions he took.  Harry had swiftly disillusioned him.  He might have limited political interest, but he wasn’t going to be anyone’s pawn.
Harry knew, because Draco had told him, that the French had their main Christmas meal on Christmas Eve, and also opened their presents that evening.  It was an odd concept to Harry, because the main events of Christmas Day had always been the food and the presents for him, and Harry wondered what actually happened on Christmas day if those had already been done.
"Dove, after breakfast I want you to stay with Greg and Vince.  I need to sort everything out for this afternoon."
"Magical submissives are really rare magical creatures, they pledge themselves to one wizard or witch and are bound to them.  It's barbaric.  The submissive needs permission to eat and sleep and do all sorts of things."
“They appear to have been let into the palace by an unknown helper, Sire.”  A guard, more elaborately attired than the rest, informed them.
"I'm not sure, sir.  Severus says that she didn't seem surprised when he told her what he heard.  Daddy says he thinks she had premonitions, that perhaps she already knew."
"If that's okay, Master.  You've worn me out a little." He yawned cutely, wrinkling his nose a little.
Malfoy took a sip of his tea.  “Yes, he lived with us mostly.  His mother is a difficult woman.”  Malfoy’s tone was neutral but he was frowning.
“Because from the way you responded to it I don’t have to worry about making you uncomfortable anymore.”
Draco was pliant beneath him, no longer pulling against the bindings.  Harry untied him quickly, turning him over.  Draco sighed contentedly and curled up into his usual sleeping position.
Harry was guided to the centre of the circle, then the others took their places.  Greg stood in the north, Vince in the south, Theo in the west and Blaise in the east.  Pansy stood on the opposite side of the alter from the couple.  Hermione, Neville, Ginny and an assortment of Harry's friends stood at the sides of the room where they could watch without getting in the way.
Ron shook his head.  “All the passageways lead into Hogsmeade, the Death Eaters are bound to have people there.  The wards start just a little way from the village.”
Vince brightened up immediately.  "Oh, not much.  Just give him something to do if he looks a bit lost.  Someone from the younger years will make sure he eats properly.  He just needs to feel he's doing something that someone else asked him to do.  Even if it's just doing homework or playing chess."
Snape entered with his usual billowing black robes.  He surveyed the class dispassionately then moved to the board.
King Louis XXIII was immediately recognisable from the photographs Harry had seen of him in The Prophet.  He was wearing robes in a gold brocade and his brown hair was long down his back.  Beside him were his wife, also in gold, and Lucius Malfoy in royal blue and silver.  Others also milled around there.  Their murmured conversation ceased at Harry and Malfoy’s entrance and the King stepped away from the group and toward the centre of the room.  Malfoy met him there, Harry at his shoulder, and they both bowed before the King.  Harry held the awkward position Malfoy had shown him until the King motioned for them to rise.  As soon as Malfoy was upright, the King embraced him.
There was dancing too: Greg and Vince, of course, the happy couple; Pansy and Theo, together again for now; Neville and Luna, awkward perfection; Hermione and Blaise, a budding romance.  When Draco looked across at him, as he did every few minutes, Harry motioned for him to come over.  Draco excused himself politely from the conversation, his father glancing briefly at Harry before relinquishing hold of his son.  Lucius had accepted Harry as his son-in-law very easily, he had already known of Draco feelings for Harry and was pleased to see that Draco had been claimed by someone he loved.  While he was reluctant to let his son out of his sight, he seemed to trust Harry well enough.
“Mr Weasley, what and unexpected pleasure. Do you have an appointment?” Harry could just make out Draco’s words through the heavy door.
"Draco," Harry called quietly.  Draco turned so quickly that his hair flicked out in a wide arc, the cigarette falling from his hand.  "Come with me." Draco scrambled to his feet.
Malfoy was being unusually forthcoming, and Harry didn’t want to push him back into his shell, so he kept his tone neutral.  “Why not?”
Harry grinned to himself.  After all, it wasn't everyday you made your lover come so hard they passed out.  "How do you feel?"
Harry swallowed, wondering if he would ever get used to that.  "So, do you have homework to do or something?"
Harry thought that was a little bit harsh.  Really, Hermione was the only person he knew that actually read the paper for news, rather than gossip or sports.  Harry had in the past tried to keep up with what Voldemort was doing through the Prophet, but had found himself put off by all of the lies about him.  Hermione could hardly blame him for that.  “So, what?  You think I should go to France alone and spend Christmas with strangers and people who hate me?”
"Hey, Harry." A sixth year Gryffindor greeted him.  "So you get to boss Malfoy around?" He didn't wait for Harry to contradict him, but pressed on.  "Can you make him do tricks, like a pet?"
"Would you make love to me again, please." Harry was surprised at Draco's boldness, but pleased.  He wanted Draco to feel like he could ask for what he wanted in bed, not like he had to tread on eggshells.  "I mean, if you can handle it, sir." Draco added in mock concern.
“This is one of several contingency plans the staff has in place for eventualities such as this.”  Snape sighed, “Try to keep your frustration under control, Mr Potter, you’re going to be in a confined space for the foreseeable future.”
“Well yeah,” said Harry, feeling a little defensive, “it’s important to practice this stuff, pretty soon we’re all going to need it.”
"I can't wait until we bond." He said as he released Draco's wrists.  "We don't have to wait the whole two weeks, right?"
Draco's entire body went stiff.  His back arched until Harry was sure it would break.  His head lifted completely off the bed so it was Harry taking his body weight.  Then his body spasmed over and over again.  His eyes rolled back and he went limp.
Harry looked across at Flosi, who offered him a wide, feral grin, and shrugged his shoulders.  “Fine.”
Harry had waited until after the Feast and the completion of Ron and Hermione’s duties in shepherding the first years back to the Common Room to tell them about the letter.  When they were settled in front of the fire, Hermione with a book and Harry and Ron with a deck of cards, he showed them.   Ron looked just as thunderstruck as Harry felt.
“Our friend told us that, as well as resembling our brother, the boy is missing a ring finger.”  This King looked around the room as though ensuring he had full attention, and Harry knew he was working his way up to a finale.  “He also brought this, he claims he took it from Draco.”
"Like I said before, I want your opinion.  I don't ever want you to be scared to tell me how you feel."
"Yeah, but don't worry about that.  I don't think he's expecting you to know him inside out, it's enough that you're willing to learn."
“I wanted to talk to you.”  Malfoy motioned that he go ahead.  “In private.”  Ginny was right, Malfoy looked terrible.  There were deep bags under his eyes and his hair was hanging limp, not combed back as it usually was.
“Don’t be silly, Harry.”  Hermione had admonished.  “No one called Sirius that, did they?  They knew he would hate it.  And nobody calls Malfoy ‘Your Grace’ at school, it’s not the done thing.”
Draco felt his cheeks heat; oh yes, he still had those photographs, kept very safely beside his bed. “Nothing that drastic, sir.” Although not far off, he had to admit. “I was just thinking that if you can’t breach this imaginary contract, then…”
Draco nodded and there was silence for a bit.  Harry watched Draco's eyes scanning the page, his brow furrowed cutely in concentration and his full, pale pink lips mouthing an ingredient to himself every so often.  As he watched something clicked.  Draco had said Snape was mourning, that was familiar.  Someone else had used that word recently.  Hadn't Blaise said it?  Harry couldn't for the life of him remember the context though.  One thing was sure: the 'lost a lover in the war' theory was looking the most promising at the moment.
Malfoy shrugged enigmatically.  “They think they do.”  Then he strode away down the corridor, shoes ringing out on the floor.
As the car parked up outside the doors, Harry felt his stomach drop.  Goyle was driving, Crabbe riding shotgun.  It seemed the Fyndfire hadn’t killed him after all.  He had stumbled out of the burnt out room of requirement hours later and straight into Goyle’s arms.  But it wasn’t those two who were worrying him.  Malfoy was sprawled languidly across the back seat, a cigarette held loosely between his fingers.
"Unfortunately, not.  He has to stay in the school grounds during term time as part of his suspended sentence.  You and Hermione are the only people who know, and we don't want anyone else to find out.  We trust you."
The portkey relocated them from Harry’s stables to the King’s, and Harry made the now familiar trek along the colonnade and through the enchanted door into the palace.  In the Gallery of Illustrious Men they were greeted by an agitated Condé.
When he returned to the bedroom, freshly brewed cup in hand, Mr Potter was in the middle of getting dressed. Draco quickly placed the cup on the bedside table and turned away. It was hardly the first time he had seen Mr Potter in a state of undress, it happened most mornings, but it still managed to fluster him. He cursed his pale complexion, which showed the rush of blood to his cheeks so completely.
“But why haven’t we heard all about it?  I mean, this is Malfoy we’re talking about.  Forget ‘my father will hear about this’, I think ‘my brother, the King of France, will hear about this’ would be more impressive.”  Harry could hardly imagine Malfoy passing up a chance like that.
It was not until the pudding, raspberry Pavlova or chocolate torte with Chantilly cream, had been eaten and the wedding cake cut that the evening became eventful. As couples were whirling around the dance floor that stood elevated above the grass, Daphne decided that it was probably safer she and Harry take a turn around the lawn in the summer dusk rather than face the horrors of Harry’s dancing. They were only about halfway round when Daphne’s hand suddenly disappeared from Harry’s elbow and shot to her ear.
“And because he flocks around the King like a lap dog.”  Added Lady Charlotte.  “Why, I heard that in the evenings he sits at the King’s feet before the fire.”  She giggled.
“Don’t be silly,” Hermione admonished.  “You’ve just claimed an important title, and you’re already famous in the wizarding world on your own merits.  It would be surprising if the King didn’t want to meet you.”
Harry shook his head at Ron's immaturity, this was why Hermione had suggested they didn't tell Ron about the whole magical submissive thing.  "You think they won, Ron?" Just for something to say, really.
“Blaise?  Yes, he gets that from his mother.  Apparently she was just the same when she was younger.  Had to be, I suppose, to disobey Alfonso Borgia.  I met him once, he’s terrifying.  She’s not like that anymore, though.  She's very cold.”
As Harry ignored the Transfigurations professor, he thought about Draco.  The Slytherins hadn't interacted much with the Gryffindors since the name thing, but Harry had spent that time watching them, and mainly the way they treated Draco.  It was like he was a young child, he was casually directed to do everyday activities like reading and playing chess, as he needed to be constantly entertained.  His ability to learn and do magic didn't seem to be effected though, and he beat almost everyone he played at chess.  Harry wondered if there would be some way to get Ron to play him, but Ron was still sulking about having to share space with 'Slytherin scum'.  Draco like physical contact too, he was constantly reaching out for his friends, and they seemed to do they same thing.  There was a lot of hugging and hand-holding, just like with a child.  Greg and Vince were even known to pick him up and carry him on occasion, he was so much smaller than them.
She nodded.  “I think so too.  This situation with your English Dark Lord tries him greatly.”  She looked at Harry sharply.  “And you wish my husband to involve himself with it.”  She had stopped walking, and Harry realised the true purpose of this interview.
“He, erm,” Harry wasn’t sure how he should refer to the French king, “He wants me to come to Versailles for Christmas.”
Pansy stood and smoothed her pencil skirt before picking up a sheaf of parchments. She shuffled the papers straight before handing them to Mr Potter.
"Fucking Death Eater scum." Ron yelled.  Draco just stood in the centre of the room staring at his feet.  "No one wants you here, you should be in Azkaban.  Well, you haven't got your bodyguards to hide behind now.  You and your pathetic father will get what's coming to you." Draco's eyes flicked up to Ron's face at the mention of his father.  Ron continued gleefully when he got a reaction.  "That's right, your precious daddy is going to die.  Gonna cry about it, Malfoy?" Harry wondered whether he should speak up, neither of them had noticed him yet and he was transfixed with shock at his friend’s cruelty.  Dove still hadn't said a word but his eyes were now fixed on Ron instead of his feet.  "He deserves it, you know that right Malfoy?  He deserves what he gets, he deserves..." Ron was cut off by Draco stepping up and punching him in the face.
But Harry wasn’t scared of any of them, because Zabini’s voice cracked halfway through and the dogs’ tails were low between their legs.  All three of them warmed to Harry after that, and Zabini showed him a ritual that would cause an alarm to sound if a Death Eater crossed the line of a circle.  They cast it together around the castle, yet another line of defence.
Harry supposed wasn't that big a deal, but Slytherins were supposed to be suspicious and back-stabbing.  They, of all people, should be on their guard.  But now they were sleeping peacefully, completely exposed.  Greg and Vince were lying close together, Vince turned inwards and Greg had his arm across his partner's shoulders.  Blaise was sprawled across the entire bed.  Theo was turned away from him, shuffling restlessly.  And Draco was curled in a ball halfway down his bed, his long hair spread around him all across the bed.  His face was peaceful and his beauty was breath taking.
He took the proffered glass and allowed himself to relax as Daphne guided him through the necessary small talk with rich purebloods. He had to admit that while he didn’t enjoy the publicity generated by bringing a date to a social event, Daphne was invaluable to him at times when it was important for him to make a good impression, and Draco couldn’t be there to guide him. He’d have preferred Draco to be there, of course, but it would have seemed odd to have his PA as his plus one to an event like this.
Harry laughed wryly and took a sip of his purple drink.  It was sweet and refreshing, tasting a little of apples, with a powerful kick of alcohol.
To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy laughed.  “You’re one to talk about favouritism.  He’s my godfather, Potter, of course I’m his favourite.”
Daphne embraced both Draco and Pansy in turn, before Draco triggered the verbal relay spell set up to link his and Mr Potter’s desks. “Miss Greengrass to see you, sir.”
"I am suggesting, Auror, that perhaps the 'entire wizarding world' has not been informed of Mr Malfoy's motives.  Perhaps the common knowledge it holds does not cover Mr Malfoy’s true feelings and inclinations.  Is that not possible, Auror Calcare?"
So far there were no Potter children in Hufflepuff.  Morgana and Lilith were in Slytherin, Circe was in Ravenclaw and Nox was in Griffyndor.  Harry suspected Salem would be another Ravenclaw and Mercury would be put in Griffyndor, but he honestly wouldn't mind if either of them sorted Hufflepuff.
Louis smiled.  “Excellent.  In that case, Draco, I chose this room to meet you because I knew how anxious you would be to get to the chapel, so if you wish, then you are excused.”
Murmurs cascaded through the courthouse.  Kingsley stepped down from his seat with the rest of the Wizengamont and over to the witness stand.  The Lawyer, as Harry had christened him in his mind, stood again and moved up to the stand.
"Give him bite sized pieces of food.  You can use your fingers or cutlery, whichever is easier for the food."
“That is understandable,” the Queen began, but stopped when the doors at the other end of the gallery, which she and Harry had almost reached, opened and Malfoy stepped through.
Draco started up a litany of ‘now’s until Harry slowly pressed the head of his cock into him. Draco tipped his head back on the bed; he loved this bit, slowly being filled until he couldn’t take anymore. Harry was so thick – he was so full, the stretch so good.
Harry bid Severus good evening and left in search of Draco.  He wondered into the grounds as the sun was setting.  It cast a warm glow over the lake and the grass.  Draco Greg and Vince were sitting in the sun, Draco's hair glittering with oranges and golds.  He was so beautiful.  Then Harry saw the cigarette clutched loosely between his submissive's fingers.
“Of course, sir.” Draco followed Mr Potter into his office to hang his robe on the peg and then went to fix tea.
"Don't worry, you don't have to be faithful.  It's just the pureblood way of bonding, plenty of people don't really believe." Vince assured Harry.
They finished looking at the rose gardens, lake and quidditch pitch, then went back to the entrance hall.  Draco gave the hall one last, awed look before flooing back to Hogwarts.
“Repressed homosexuality.”  Enghien said casually, and Harry couldn’t tell if he was being serious or not.
Malfoy went through his usual ritual of tea making.  “I want to go over a few points of etiquette, Potter.”
“He wants me to focus on my school work, NEWTs are important and he says sixth year is where all the real work is done.”  Malfoy’s expression gave no clue as to how he might feel about this.
Feeling completely turned about, Harry took the letter.  After all, it had only been the previous term that Malfoy had been threatening Harry with dire consequences for getting his father arrested.  Now he was acting as messenger without a singe insult thrown at Harry.
Severus laughed softly, before turning back to the matter at hand.  "There's a pensive of Dumbledore's in the Headmistress' office which has some useful memories in.  This deception has been going on a long time, if there was one person in touch with every part of it, it was Dumbledore."
She laughed at him kindly.  “Yes, I’m sure.  Plenty of people address me by my first name.  I lived here for a long time and had many friends here before I was Queen.  I do not hold with these old-fashioned traditions, not in private.”
The Queen was an engaging conversationalist.  Harry sat with her and drank tea as she lightly questioned him about his life at Hogwarts.  A number of ladies sat with them and joined in the conversation at times.  Lady Florence and Lady Charlotte sat with a gaggle of younger girls at the side of the room, and they seemed happy to chatter among themselves.
Malfoy nodded and stepped away from him.  “Bors, Ajax, bedroom.”  He instructed, and the two hounds turned and trotted back the way they had come.  The doors they had entered the balcony through opened as the dogs reached them, and then closed firmly behind them.
Harry tipped his head back and groaned. He should have known the picture would have made the papers before either of them had the chance to stop it. After the Lithuanian Embassy’s Christmas Ball, Draco had managed to secure the originals and copies of the photographs before they had left the photographer’s office, by what means Harry wasn’t exactly sure. That method would clearly not work in this case.
There were footsteps behind him.  The friar had returned, and behind him was a slim figure in a simple grey robe.  The shock of pale hair confirmed who it was before Harry had even turned to get a proper look.
Malfoy’s cousins were terrifying.  Not particularly tall or even broad, but there as a wiry strength to them and their faces were weathered and sharp.  They were almost as fair as Malfoy, but their hair was a darker blond and the taller one was sporting a magnificent beard.  They both wore black robes and there was a hint of blue-black ink at their necks and wrists.
Hermione shook her head.  "He wouldn't have been able to claim him.  To claim a submissive you have to prove that you are strong enough to claim than, but also that you can love them, care for them, provide for them and pleasure them." She was counting them off on her fingers but turned a bit pink at the last one.
“Only Gregory and Vince.  Greg is the son of my father’s groundskeeper and Vince’s father is our steward.”
"Yeah.  But maybe leave out the hate part." Harry was not amused.  "Seriously, it'll be fine.  Sev knows you can't bond unless you're right for Dove, and he won't do anything to sabotage his Godson's chances."
Malfoy’s rooms were smaller than Harry’s.  There was a foyer and a room beyond it, and a door off to the right.  In the room ahead Harry could see two young men, Harry’s age or a little older, sat at a table and being enthusiastically greeted by Bors and Ajax.  They stood when they saw Malfoy and Harry.
Harry had to steer his mind in a different direction before he ended up taking the book to bed.  He continued reading.  Hermione had been right about the masters having to prove themselves.  There was an order it had to be done in as well.  First, you had to prove your strength and ability to dominate them.  Then that you were able to provide for them, that you had the money and means to keep them secure.  After the practicalities were dealt with, you had to prove you could take care of them.  See to their needs, but first understand their needs.  As love took time to accomplish, the promise of love was accepted before the bonding ritual.  As the Submissive couldn't be touched sexually until the bonding, proving you could pleasure them was part of ritual.  When they orgasmed the bonding was complete.
Draco obediently went to the fire place, threw in the floo powder and stated his destination.  Harry followed him and was soon standing in the foyer of his manor.  Draco was looking around in wonder, and with good reason.  The foyer was five stories tall, the same height as the rest of the house, and had a crystal dome instead of the ceiling.  The crystal refracted the light and made rainbows dance across the cream-coloured walls.
Harry smiled as the couple made their way over with their eleven year old daughter Rosie.  "Hey, you're a bit late aren't you.  I thought you'd have been camped here over night, just in case."
Draco examined the dark rosary that had been returned to him.  “Severus…”. He didn’t ask, couldn’t bring himself to finish the question, just stared down at the beads.
Malfoy took one.  “Thank you.  Vincent wants to know if you’ll walk me back to the common room this evening.”
“Thank you,” Harry said, although it did not cover the sudden wave of gratitude he felt at having another ally in this place.
Fascinating was not the word Harry would have chosen.  Mind-numbingly dull would have been more appropriate.  Hermione gathered her parchment and pen back into her bag and left for the library with half a piece of toast in her mouth.
His manners were still perfect.  As the friar turned and left, he stood calmly before Harry in his plain robes, with his hair long and lose, less formal than Harry had ever seen him.  Not monk’s robes, Harry realised, even as he registered the possibility.  He wouldn’t have put it past Draco to take holy orders, but he was glad he hadn’t.  He still had that quiet stillness about him, not really born from tranquillity, but rather an intense reserve, and the conservation of valuable energy.
Sure enough, a voice sounded from behind him.  "Can I help you, sir?  Are you looking for something specific?"
“Of course.  Allow me to present Harry Potter, the Marquess of Dorchester.”  Malfoy turned to Harry.  “Harry, let me introduce His Serene Highness the Prince of Condé.”  The statue was wearing a broad, feathered hat, high boots and wielded a large sword.  He didn’t look particularly serene.
He ran from his room and out into the hallway.  There were others leaving their rooms and wandering into the corridor in confusion.  Harry followed the general flow of people towards the Hall of Mirrors.  It was strange to see the extravagant gallery filled with people in their nightclothes.  There were guards in red robes and plumed hats mingling with frightened looking nobles.  Harry quickly singled out Snape as one of the few dressed and not looking like a terrified rabbit, and made his way over to him.
The Lawyer smiled, or rather smirked, he had to be a Malfoy relative.  "So my client was arrested on the grounds of common knowledge."
Draco left and Ron turned to Harry. “You do know that you’re the only person in the building to have a secretary and a PA don’t you?”
Ron sobered a little.  “I reckon that’s true enough.”  He opened his mouth to continue the thought, but was distracted by the arrival of Malfoy and Zabini.  “I just wish we weren’t sharing the class with the Slytherins, I bet half of them are just waiting for You Know Who’s order to murder us in our beds.”
"Lilith don't tease your brother." Lilith just smirked, looking a lot like Draco did whenever they ran into Ron in Diagon Alley.  "It doesn't matter what House you're put in, Salem, just as long as you're happy there."
“Not if I can help it.”  Blaise Zabini had slipped into the chamber as they had been talking.  “Shift yourself, Potter.”  He chivvied Harry out of the way so he could get to the wall behind him.
Harry eased his horse back from a canter into a trot, the cool shade of the forest giving way to the summer heat as he rode through the open fields that surrounded his home.  The purchase of this estate had been one of his first actions after the war.  England had become claustrophobic, the Ministry needed rebuilding from the ground up and Harry didn’t have the stomach for it.  There was also a certain faction that wanted to infantilise him, treat him as a school child rather than a man who had just orchestrated the defeat of the most powerful dark wizard of the age.  Harry didn’t want to be somewhere where important conversations ended as he entered the room, where people told him not to concern himself with matters of consequence.  The decision to move to France had been easy.  Louis welcomed him warmly into both the court and his confidences, and Harry no longer felt the need to constantly look over his shoulder.
He wandered off to do as he was told and Harry took a deep breath.  This was going to be a long weekend if he had to struggle to control himself around Draco the whole time.  He couldn't help it though.  The boy was beautiful, and the vulnerability and submission just added to it.
Harry bit his lip, he had been meaning to talk to Draco about this.  He didn't usually care about other people smoking, but Draco was his responsibility.  "I'd prefer it if you didn't Draco." He hesitated.  "In fact, I don't want you smoking at all, understood, Draco."
“His Majesty has requested your presence at the palace.”  Snape told him, his face betraying nothing.
They were in Snape’s office for the fifth Monday evening in a row.  As before, they were sitting in front of the fire with a pot of tea between them.  Malfoy had called for a house elf and asked for some biscuits.  “I hope you don’t mind,” he had said, “I missed dinner.  I had correspondence to attend to.”  Malfoy had been unexpectedly cordial to Harry in their meetings.  He was still sharp at times, usually when Harry asked questions he deemed to be stupid, but he was usually polite, if a little detached.  He still looked awful, though.  Everyday the bags under his eyes seemed to be deeper and his face was more drawn.  Whatever the cause of his exhaustion was, a month and a half at Hogwarts had not alleviated it.
As if on cue, the little auburn spaniel came shooting past them to greet the other dogs.  Harry turned and saw Gabrielle, the lady Lisette had entrusted her dog to, hurrying down the gallery as fast as her expansive russet robes would allow.
It was an unusual piece of initiative from Malfoy, and the Queen jumped on it.  “But of course, you must go.”  She assured Harry.  “You need to make friends with young men your own age.  I will see you both at dinner.”
Harry had also taken the time to look at a map of England and find out where exactly Dorchester was.  In Dorset, unsurprisingly, but the Black family seemed to have lost whatever historic connection they had to the city.  He was now Harry Potter, fourteenth Marquess of Dorchester.  This gave him a whole slew of responsibilities, such as voting for the implementation of new wizarding laws put forward by the Wizengamot, and a seat on the Board of Governors at Hogwarts.  Luckily for Harry, he could not take any of these positions until he had come of age.  Given the return of Voldemort, and the prophecy Dumbledore had revealed to him the previous term, Harry wasn’t entirely sure he would live to see his seventeenth birthday.  If he did get the chance, Harry would have liked to honour Sirius with his political decisions, but as Sirius had never had the opportunity to exercise the rights given to him by his position, Harry did not know what he would have wanted.  Although his parents had not legally disowned him, and so Sirius had inherited on his father’s death, this had not occurred until he was already in Azkaban, and so while his title had not been stripped from him – there was no surviving family to demand it and no foreign king gunning for him – he had hardly been welcome in the Ministry.  Harry didn’t know what political stance Sirius would have taken had he had the chance.  He didn’t know very much about his godfather at all.  He know Sirius would have opposed anything discriminatory towards muggleborns, but he had never discussed his views on the economy or education or any of the other things Harry would soon be asked to make decisions about.
“They like you.”  Malfoy observed as Bors presented Harry with an ear to scratch behind.  Harry found himself relieved at that.  “That’s enough of that, come on.”  Harry wasn’t sure whether the instruction was directed at him or the dogs.  Malfoy started walking.  “Leave the trunk, Potter, it’ll be taken to your rooms.”
When Potter ran he half-heartedly followed.  The more faithful, like his sister-in-law, followed with more vigour.  He watched the fighting with a sinking heart.  This would never end well, and when it didn't, he would be the one to pay.  He just hoped someone would keep Draco safe for him.
To Harry’s surprise, Snape answered instead.  “Lucius has not hidden his opinion that France should not involve itself with the war against the Dark Lord.  The King takes his stepfather’s opinions seriously.”
Harry grinned, he'd hoped Draco would say something like that.  "Well, you could put this on for me." He reached over and retrieved the collar he had bought Draco from the dresser.
"You know, with Salem and Mercury at Hogwarts now, we'll have the Manor all to ourselves." He used his grip on Draco's wrist to pull the man towards him.
Harry had spent some time trying to educate himself about history while enjoying his country seclusion, but he still only had a passing understanding of who Eleanor of Aquitaine had been, so he just matched Draco’s smile.  “Lots of people want you back, Draco.”
Snape gave him a slightly fonder look than that with which he had favoured Harry.  “And hear about your most recent heartbreak?  Another time.”
“This way.”  Flosi replied calmly, and guided Harry more gently past the milling Hufflepuffs and to the other end of the Hall, where the teacher’s table was.  The door behind the head table opened to a wave of Flosi’s hand.  He directed Harry through, Malfoy and Skarpheðinn hot on their heels, and into the same chamber Harry had been ushered into after he had been declared one of the Triwizard Champions.
“An ally?”  Harry was disbelieving.  “He’s Lucius Malfoy’s stepson.  I don’t know why he would be my ally.  I assume he wants me dead, just like Voldemort.”
“What…” Harry tried to marshal his confusion into a question.  “Since when was there a King of France?”
“I was wondering if we could change the day, I have a meeting I can’t change.”  The Order was meeting to discuss the latest information brought in by their spies.
As usual, Hermione’s explanation had raised more questions than it answered.  “Go back to the emperor bit.”
Malfoy did it again with only slightly dramatic consequences.  “I know.  It’s one of the reasons I’m not playing quidditch this year, I’m falling apart.”
Harry opened his mouth to ask what the hell a magical submissive was, but Hermione put her hand on his arm.  "Thank you, we won't tell anyone." She said, as if they'd explained everything.
“Because he used the desk.”  Harry said hopefully, and then added, “Sir,” quickly.  Since he had begun using Snape’s office for his meetings with Malfoy he had become irrationally reluctant to annoy the professor too much.
Snape sighed and sat at Draco’s table.  “Your father isn’t a fool, Draco.  But he may be misguided.  He wants peace, and an easy life.  And he wants the King to consolidate his power here before he embarks on any foreign adventures.”
“Does that take up a lot of time?”  Harry was intrigued; Malfoy did not often talk about his own role in the French court.
"You've just punished him in a very gentle way because he did something that's harmful to him, think you've more than proved that you care."
“And I you, Your Majesty.”  Malfoy returned the hug with a light touch on his half brother’s shoulders.  Then he delicately extricated himself.  “Your Majesty, allow me to present Harry Potter, the Marquess of Dorchester.”
Draco poured the three glasses and brought them over to the table.  Harry sat next to him.  He watched Snape, opposite, take what Harry would characterise as a large mouthful of his whiskey in spite of his protestations.  Harry glared into his whiskey, unsure of how he felt.  He knew he had lost something in the last few minutes, lost his chance at support from one of the most powerful people in Europe, but he didn’t feel the blow as heavily as he thought he might.  In a sense, he had lost what he had never had.  He was in no worse a position than he had been in five minutes ago, but also no better.
When Harry had finished reading it, he set Draco's essay down.  "That was good, Draco.  Come up here." He patted the bed next him and Draco moved to sit there.  Harry enfolded him in his arms.  "You're forgiven now, love, but if it happens again your punishment will be  much more severe."
"Auror Calcare," the woman started half-heartedly, "in your opinion, was Mr Malfoy a danger to the public."
The end finally came on a rainy afternoon in May.  The Order’s raids on the Death Eaters had been increasing in their frequency and ferocity, and Harry had put every available resource into pumping the Death Eaters they captured for any information about Voldemort or Draco.  The former had been much more plentiful than the latter, and Harry had found all he needed to know to destroy a large part of Voldemort’s troops and draw him out into the open.  As it transpired, the Death Eaters were far less efficient than the Order at gathering information, because they had a marked preference for killing rather than taking prisoners, and so they never had the level of intelligence the Order did.  Harry’s decision was made when they captured Rudolphus LeStrange, who told them, under interrogation, that he had been involved in the original plan to kidnap Draco, but Draco had disappeared months ago.  Harry knew then that Draco was either dead or not in Death Eater hands, and there was no point delaying their final action against the Dark Lord.
“I meant what I said before, you don’t need to be so formal.” His grip tightened on Draco’s shoulder.
“And you, Lord Dorchester, you must be tired.  My valet, Blouin, will show you to your chambers where you can rest a little, and then perhaps you might tour the castle.  If that is agreeable?”
It was eight o’clock on the morning of Marina Shacklebolt’s wedding to Roger Davies that Draco double-checked his clothes in the mirror and flooed to Mr Potter’s flat. It was not unusual for him to visit Mr Potter before work to ensure that the man was adequately dressed for the ministry. Between that and the office, he spent very little time in his own dingy bedsit, which was all the better really. Today, however, it was particularly important that he was there in a timely fashion; he had to brief Mr Potter on the social etiquette of attending the Minister’s daughter’s wedding. There would be press everywhere looking for a scoop, as well as influential purebloods who resented Mr Potter’s place in the ministry, waiting for him to slip up.
Draco drew in a deep breath as he imagined what they would do in the bed, how Harry would take him.  He could see himself tied to the grey wood headboard, or lying on his back among those pillows.  If he'd ever resented the sexual frustration he had to endure, it was now.
He and Neville left promptly.  Harry felt bad about leaving Luna alone, but she merely smiled and produced a copy of the Quibbler.  “I’m sure Ron and Hermione will pop in when they can.  I don’t mind being alone.”  She reassured them.
Malfoy returned her smile, and Harry could see the warmth there, even though he was too buttoned up to demonstrate it further.  “You have my gratitude, Your Majesty.”
Harry knew the real question behind that, so he answered it as frankly as he could.  "I'm going to ask Dove if I can court him."
“Yes, I’m a friend of Draco’s.”  Harry cut in, answering Lady Florence’s original question before the argument could escalate.  He had to make a conscious effort to call Malfoy ‘Draco’, as he had suggested, and describing him as a friend felt like something of an exaggeration.
The Chevalier de Montespan was tall as well, but more sandy-haired than fair.  And he was very good-looking, Harry had to admit.  He could understand why Malfoy might show more interest in him than Louise de la Fare, whoever she might be.  The Chevalier shook his hand as well and pronounced himself delighted.
The dark-haired man on the floor was wearing black robes and was covered in blood.  It seemed to be his own, as it was clear that one or both of the dogs had attacked him and his throat was all but ripped out.  Snape approached the man and crouched over him.
“Of course, sir.” Draco made his way into the kitchen and easily found the components necessary for tea. Sometimes he thought he knew his way around Mr Potter’s kitchen better that his own.
The Sorting was the same as it always was.  The Sorting Hat spoke rubbish and the first years were terrified.  The new Gryffindor students stared at Harry like he was God and Harry felt like banging his head against the table for it.  He just wanted to get on with it.
“Yeah, but it’s worth it to prevent a diplomatic incident with the old-school purebloods and their ilk.”
The tension in Draco's body and the redoubling of his tears made Harry wonder what exactly Draco expected Harry to do to him.  "I know you will. " He reached across Draco to the desk and pulled out a scroll and a quill.  "You're going to write a foot and a half long essay for me called 'why my Master doesn't want me to smoke', okay?"
Harry laughed. “Draco, I wake up every morning and see you. Having you in my bed rather than next to it will only be an improvement.”
Malfoy made a non-committed noise and Harry felt he hadn’t quite got to the heart of it.  Malfoy walked over to the fireplace and Harry looked at the room he hadn’t been in since his Occulmency lessons had ended so abruptly the previous year.  The room hadn’t changed, the walls were full of jars of ingredients and the desk stood imposingly in the centre, now bereft of the Penseive.  Malfoy directed his wand at the fireplace, and it sparked into life.
Harry began to retort, but was interrupted by the thunder of paws and two huge streaks of grey before Malfoy was covered in a mound of moving fur.
“I’m speaking French,” Malfoy replied distractedly, “you’re the only one speaking and hearing English.”
“Might I ask,” the friar began tensely, “what your interest in finding such a person here would be?”
"Yeah, if that's okay with you." Harry was a little unsure, he and Draco had never got on in the past, and even though Draco had changed a lot he might still remember their old animosity.
“Well, I’m certainly not giving you whiskey on an empty stomach.”  Snape retrieved only one tumbler from the cupboard of the sideboard.
“Perhaps,” Malfoy conceded, “if they want.  But they both have other options.  Greg’s great with animals, so he’ll probably take a place on the palace hunt at Versailles.  Vince is a talented cellist, there would also be a place at Versailles for him if he chose, but he could play for any orchestra he chose.”
They sat down to play, and Harry found himself opposite, and therefore in partnership with, Henri d’Enghien.  As Malfoy dealt the first hand, Alexandre de Montespan set up a running chatter that seemed unstoppable.  Harry found himself adding in a few comments when he could, as did Malfoy and Enghien.  Mostly it was a rundown of the court gossip, which Harry only followed a small amount of.  He settled into a contented rhythm of cards and idle conversation, and soon he and the Duc had the requisite five points to win the game.
Vince smiled at him, recognising his discomfort.  "We were wondering if you would do us a favour this weekend."
Snape sighed.  "I do suppose I owe you an explanation, and now seems to be the correct time to set things straight.  I don't know how much Draco has told you, so I will explain all that I can.  I expect you believed me to be hostile to you because I disliked your father." Harry nodded.  "It’s true that I didn't like your father in the least, but your mother was like a sister to me.  When we found out about the prophesy, your mother told me to go to Voldemort.  And I did.  It resulted in their death.  Every time I see you I'm reminded of that.  Lily asked me treat you like any other student, and I'm afraid I've failed her.  I'm not proud of that."  His sentences were staccato and awkward, but then it was an awkward situation.
Malfoy rolled his shoulders and it sounded as though every joint and sinew in his shoulders, back and neck were popping and crunching at the same time.  Harry winced.  “That doesn’t sound healthy.”
"They probably know how precious magical submissives are." She looked around them. "We should go to dinner.  We're going to miss the sorting.
"Yes, submissives find it quite hard to function before they are claimed.  They need to be told what to do.  Without a Dominant, I guess Crabbe and Goyle are fulfilling that role."
“But why would the wizards want a king?”  Harry had had enough trouble with politicians, he couldn’t imagine wanting a monarch.
“I was sorry to miss your mother’s wedding this summer, Blaise.”  Harry remembered hearing that Zabini’s mother was something of a black widow.
“Some,” Malfoy acknowledged lightly.  “People believe that I’m an easy way to the King.  They write to me asking that I petition the King for this and that, and so I must pass their request on or write them back telling them my refusal.  It’s usually a refusal.  I have no position in court, I’m not a politician.  But if it’s some little thing, like that their daughter be permitted a position in the Queen’s household, or their son join His Majesty on a hunt, then I consider it.  Only if their family has valuable connections or the children promising qualities.”  He shot Harry a smirk.  “Only if the daughter is ugly, or the Queen would never forgive me.”
Draco didn’t even need a moment to think. “I want to suck your cock.” He whispered as he climbed onto the bed after Harry.
"What do you mean?  I would've thought that punishing him would prove my dominance, not that I care."
"Let's go round and say our names, in case anyone doesn't know." Nott suggested, which was lucky really as Harry had no idea what his first name was.  "It'll be like team-building."
They were interrupted, as they always were, by Snape’s entrance.  “You weren’t at dinner.”  He said by way of greeting.
“You stared at him all through breakfast, and now you look set to stare at him all through lunch.  Did you guys fight on the train?  Do you think he’s up to something?”
Once back in the common room, Harry related the evening’s events to Ron and Hermione.  “But Malfoy’s not allowed to drink, he’s underage.”  Hermione objected.
“Yeah,” Ron agreed, “when McGonagall came to the common room and told us all to go to the Great Hall, we thought you’d be here.  But we couldn’t see you; we thought you might have gone off on your own, mate.”
“He’s a fool if he thinks the Dark Lord will leave us alone.”  Draco muttered darkly, echoing Harry’s thoughts.
“Just the ones I grew up with.”  Malfoy gave one of his expressive shrugs.  “English and French, obviously, and Italian because of Blaise and Icelandic because of my cousins.”
“Yes,” Draco replied, “but the Queen isn’t fond of the giant rats, so we’re having Swan Lake instead, and Sleeping Beauty on Boxing Day.”
“Who can tell why, your Majesty.”  Snape said.  “For greed or for ideology.  Whatever the cause, the culprit is out of our reach.  We must now consider the Dark Lord.”
Malfoy’s exhaustion had returned when Harry saw him next.  The previous weekend had been the christening of the Dauphin, which Malfoy had attended.  The photos in the Prophet, not, this time the front page, had shown Malfoy with his family in the gardens of Versailles.  Malfoy’s nephew, Jean-Luc, was swaddled in a long white robe and held by his mother.  Malfoy was in thick robes against the November chill, navy with silver embroidery.  The dark fabric was stark against Malfoy’s skin and Malfoy looked tense as he looked out from the picture.  The King also looked tense, resplendent as he was in white and gold, there was a tightness around his eyes and his smile appeared forced.
There was something weird going on here and Harry didn't like it.  It felt wrong.  Malfoy wasn't acting like he usually would, he wasn't dressed like he usually was, didn't make the same sneering comments or show his usual distain.  Harry knew first hand that people could change, but they didn't just get personality transplants.  He resolved to watch closely to see what was really going on.
The King held out his hand behind him and his wife stepped forward to join them.  “Draco, welcome home.”  The Queen said warmly, and held out her hand for Malfoy to kiss.
"I know that's what people think, Dove, but I want it to be your decision too.  I don't want to do anything you're not comfortable with."
“I’m not going to be sick.” There was an awkward pause in which Draco stowed his wand back in his robes and Mr Potter levered himself off the sofa. “Look, Draco, you were right that I wouldn’t have kissed you if I hadn’t been drunk.” Draco swallowed and reminded himself that he had expected this. “But not for the reason that you’re thinking.” Mr Potter hurried on. “I do find you very attractive…”
Draco folded his arms and set his hip against Harry’s footboard. “Why is it that I can't allow you to attend a wedding alone without you inadvertently becoming engaged, Mr Potter?”
“I think the King will want to speak to you tomorrow,” Draco told Harry in an undertone as the other two launched into a discussion of tomorrow’s food.
Theo smiled at Ron, though it didn't reach his eyes.  "Sorry man, we'll turn it off if you're coming in."
"Thank you." If The Lawyer had been anymore smug he would have started purring.  He turned to the prosecution lawyer.  "Your witness."
“You don’t seem particularly concerned about Draco, Lucius, given that he’s your son.”  Snape squared off against Malfoy, his stance aggressive.
Snape regarded him with a sneer.  “No, Potter, don’t be ridiculous.  There are first and second years out there, there will be no fighting.  If the wards break, then the castle has a line of physical defence.  And I believe that the Aurors have been alerted.  They will also attempt to defend the castle.  If these fail, and the Death Eaters gain entry to the castle, then the staff will seek to come to an agreement that will secure the safety of all of the students.  As you might imagine, this will be made significantly more difficult to achieve if two of the people that the Dark Lord most wants to kill are among the student body.  You're not here for your own safety, Mr Potter, you’re here for everyone else’s.”
"Toast with marmite." Vince supplied.  He slid two slices onto Harry's plate.  "I made some up for you the way he likes it."
“Can’t we get the younger kids out through the secret passages?”  Harry asked.  It had been his first thought.
Draco was in love, with the house as well as with Harry.  They went out to look at the grounds which were huge.  As they walked through the rock garden, Draco pulled out a cigarette.
It made sense, or at least it did to Hermione, who observed to Harry over dinner that evening, “The pureblood community hasn’t survived in secrecy for hundreds years by being martyrs for their cause.  Self-interest is their main priority now as much as it was during the witch hunts in the seventeenth century.  They’re not going to risk their own necks by following a madman, even if they do agree with his rhetoric.”
Harry reread the paragraph several times in an attempt to understand the dynamics it described, but could only really surmise that Lucius Malfoy was the stepfather of a French king.  He was prevented from further perusal of the article by Hermione’s arrival.  She stepped onto the kitchen hearth and then over to the table where Harry had been having a late breakfast.
“Well, that’s a completely different story.  Very scandalous.”  She looked quite delighted by it.  “The current king, that’s Louis XXIII, his father was Charles XV, and his mother is Narcissa Malfoy.”
Snape gave him his customary look of distain.  “Because if I call him otherwise in front of the wrong person I’ll be crucioed until I bleed from my eye sockets, Potter.  It’s not a habit I want to get into.”
Harry had been looking forward to taking grim pleasure in following Lucius Malfoy’s trial in The Daily Prophet.  Not that it would bring Sirius back, or bring Bellatrix Lestrange to justice, but it would at least bring him a measure of satisfaction.  But when the first Prophet of August was delivered to Grimauld Place, where Harry had chosen to spend the summer in spite of Professor Dumbledore and Molly Weasley’s protestations, it did not contain news of Lucius Malfoy’s imminent incarceration.  Instead, the front page held a story that Harry could not quite make sense of.  ‘King Louis XXIII of France Sires Heir’ the headline read, and the photograph next to it showed a man richly dressed in embroidered robes with long brown hair standing beside a blonde woman similarly adorned and holding a baby in a long, white shirt.  Harry read the first paragraph, which explained that Louis XXIII, King of France, and his wife, Élizabeth of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, had had their first son, who they had named Jean-Luc.  It promised a full and exclusive spread of pictures of the French royal family in the following ten pages.  This provided something of a conundrum for Harry, because as far as he knew there had been no French monarchy since Napoleon, and while he could not put an exact date on the Revolution, he thought it had probably happened about two-hundred years ago.  He was sure Hermione would know what it meant, and so resolved to ask her when she came over to use the Black library, as she had almost every day since the start of summer.  In the meantime he read further down the column.  It did not provide any more details as to exactly why there appeared to be a French king, but halfway down the page it did mention the very man Harry had initially hoped to read about.
“Nope, like it here.” He slurred, then he slumped against Draco’s side. “Need to say thank you, Draco.”
He was brought out of his doze by a knock on the outer door.  He pushed himself off the bed and went to the door.  Upon opening it, Harry found himself face to face with two young women, just a few years older than himself.  One was blonde, like the Queen, and the other had fiery red hair.  Both were wearing robes that fitted more like dresses, with fitted bodices and wide skirts, both covered in delicate floral embroidery.  The blonde was wearing lavender, and the redhead pale green.  Harry stared at them for a moment, surprised and unsure of what to say.
As they neared the Slytherin common room, the wall slid open and Goyle stepped out. “Oh,” he said, and stopped short as he saw them.  “There you are, Draco.”
Malfoy shrugged.  “She’s the King’s wife, and they’re a good match.”  His words were as impersonal as ever, but thee was a hint of warmth in his tone, and Harry suspected that he did in fact rather like Queen Élizabeth.
Harry absorbed that for a few moments.  Harry wasn’t used to thinking of the Slytherins as individuals with skills and preferences.  Then, as his thoughts returned to the start of their conversation, an awful thought struck him.  “I don’t have to learn French, do I?”
"You won't have sold us out.  And besides, if he's your student you'll never be nice.  I know I can count on you to be your usual horrible self to him, but you’ll teach him what he needs to know."
“The problem is,” Daphne began their scheming, “that my parents really want the marriage to go ahead.”
Harry reached over and tilted his head up.  "Dove, it's okay, really.  I was being an ungrateful brat and you had every right to pull me up on it."
"I've always thought it was to keep you alive, sir." It took Harry a second to realise that Draco's tone was unusually sharp.  He glared at him and Draco immediately dropped his eyes.  "I'm sorry, sir.  It's not my place..."
“I think, sir, that bed would be a better option for you than the sofa at the moment.” Draco reached out a hand to help the man up, but Mr Potter instead used it to pull Draco down next to him.
"You have to show him that you have the means to take care of him, right?" Harry nodded.  "Well then, why don't you show him one or two of the properties you've inherited, that should prove you can provide for him.  Then buy him something nice to flash your money around a bit."
Harry touched Draco's face softly.  "I will never hurt you like that, Dove.  But I will punish you if you misbehave."
As Harry held Draco gently in his arms, he reflected that he'd never really planned out his life.  He'd had vague expectations: that he'd join the Aurors, that he'd live with Ron until Ron and Hermione got married, maybe even that he'd marry Ginny.  He'd never planned though, he hadn't thought about how many kids he'd like or where he wanted to live, he hadn't even officially applied to the Aurors.  Now he could see himself living at Potter Manor with Draco and four, or maybe five, kids. While human men couldn't get pregnant, all magical submissive were 'receptive to their Master's seed' as Draco had so delicately put it.  They could have as many kids as they wanted.
After the ballet had finished they went for dinner in the Orangery building.  It ran at a right angle to the palace at a single storey, and was made from the same cream stone with arching windows and a high ceiling.  It was beautiful, and the smell of oranges perfumed the air from the trees that had been brought in for the winter.  This time Harry didn’t have a seat, he stood with the Chevalier and watched as Draco and his family ate.  It was a surreal experience, this en masse observation of the royal family.  Draco looked blank, his face as much of a mask as Harry had ever seen it, though he kept conversation with his brother and his godfather on either side of him.  Harry felt for him, and admired the self-control Draco had in managing restore his façade after his earlier anger.  The rest of the courtiers were served snacks and refreshments on trays that floated between them.  It was delicious, and plentiful, but eating standing up was awkward and Harry hoped he wouldn’t have to make a habit of it.  Once dinner was over, Harry was whisked off into the gardens where there was dancing and drinking.  Draco even seemed to manage to enjoy himself.  He laughed as Maintenon released a snitch and he dashed through the trees with his wolfhounds at his heels, his navy and silver robes flying around him.  Harry couldn’t help but smile as he watched Draco jumping for the snitch and his dogs twisted around him in the snow.
“Right.”  Harry chose not to dwell on that.  “Do they understand French?  He growled when you said about being killed.”
Lucius held his son for a long time before he released him.  "I understand I have you to thank for this, Mr Potter."
“Then why are they bothering?”  Harry asked, more to himself than Snape, as he was aware it wasn’t exactly the brightest question.  Then a thought occurred and glanced up quickly to meet Snape’s eyes, where he saw it mirrored.  “It’s a distraction.”
“So,” Lady Florence said, and she turned her sharp gaze on Harry, “you’re friends with the Little Cavalier.”
Harry entered Kingsley's office flanked by Draco and Severus.  Kingsley looked slightly surprised to see them, Harry hadn't exactly made an appointment.
Draco ushered Daphne ahead of him into Mr Potter’s office. Mr Potter was behind his desk, and stood to greet Daphne. He asked Draco to stay as well.
Snape fixed him with a glare.  “You’re not here to drink fine wine and make friends, Potter.  This is the sole purpose of your visit.”  And Harry could only find himself relieved to hear himself called by his name again.
Hermione was now situated to the left of the entrance to Platform 9 and ¾ with the Weasleys.  Harry joined them and was quickly engulfed by a cacophony of greetings.  Between him, Ron and Hermione, they got their three trunks on board and into an empty compartment.  Then they went back onto the platform to say goodbye to Mr and Mrs Weasley.  Molly squeezed Harry as firmly as ever and cautioned them all to be careful.  Arthur told them to enjoy their sixth year, because their seventh year would be all about their NEWTS.
Harry shifted a little.  This was slightly uncomfortable and incredibly erotic at the same time.  All his friends hearing the nature of his relationship with Draco, not that they didn't already know what Draco was.
"Please, call me Severus, or whichever of the ridiculous nicknames the children have come up that takes your fancy."
“Who survived the war?”  Draco nodded.  “All of your family, Draco, everyone’s alright.”  More or less.  Draco’s cousin Ragnar had been so badly injured in the battle to retake the ministry no one had thought he would survive, but he had, a little worse for wear.  Alexandre de Montespan had declared himself deeply traumatised by his war experience and retired to his family’s home in Anjou.  For all his talk, Harry thought there was some truth to the man’s self-declared frailty.  There had been other injuries here and there, and no one had emerged from the war as they had entered, but everyone was more or less safe and sound.
“Monsieur,” the guard who had accompanied them pounded on his door, “Monsieur, open the door, please.”  He kept pounding, but there was no response.
“I know the Queen supports us.”  Draco agreed.  “Perhaps her voice in the end will outweigh my father’s.”
“Perfect.”  Condé turned back to Malfoy.  “Now, I have a message for you, Draco.  The King is waiting to receive you in the Salon of Hercules.”  The statue leant forward conspiratorially.  “I think His Majesty has missed you.”
"Lucius." Severus hurried over and wrapped his arms around his mate's waist.  Lucius rested his head against Severus' shoulder.  Draco took Harry's hand and retreated a little.
Draco closed them in his fist, tight, so the beads must have dug into the soft skin of his palm and made little dents, if only Harry could take his hand and look, and tucked them into some hidden place in his robes.
Harry met his professor's eyes.  "Of course.  I refuse to treat him like an object or a piece of meat."
Draco leaned forward towards Harry under guise of putting Belle in his lap.  “Time is of the essence, the Dark Lord’s power grows in Britain and if His Majesty is going to move against him it must be soon.  He wishes to hear your case so that he can make a quick decision.”
There was silence in the room for many moments as they all took in the horror of the situation.  Draco gone, taken by what could only be Death Eaters, and no way to find him without acceding to Voldemort’s demands.  Bors and Ajax put their bloody muzzles on Malfoy’s empty bed, and snuffled dolefully at the mussed sheets.  Then Ajax set up a whining, crying howl, and Bors joined him until Snape called them both to heel, and told them I know, but quiet now, that’s enough like they were people, and cleaned their muzzles with a spell.
“All kinds, really.”  Malfoy passed a hand over eyes.  “Some from Death Eater sympathisers, some from anti-monarchists, some from French purists who don’t like my father’s place in court.  I had hoped it would die down once it became obvious that our position would not alter as a result, but if anything it’s become worse.”
Malfoy nodded.  “Anyone in the ranks with enough finesse to unpick your wards defected with my father.  We’re safe here.”
Enghien snorted.  “That silly chit?  Don’t waste your time on her.”  Harry had to agree with that assessment.
“I…” Harry didn’t know what to say, “I won’t try to make you.”  He held out his fist, a little clumsy, and Draco reached out to take what was in it.  “You should have this back though.”
“Harry, then. You don’t have to say this to spare my feelings or because you’re embarrassed about what happened before. We can just go home and pretend none of this ever happened.”
Draco’s hands found Harry’s waist, and his nails dug frantic gauges into his back. He felt like he was on fire, every nerve-ending overloaded with pleasure. He brought his hips up to meet Harry’s downwards thrusts and moved a hand between their bodies to squeeze his cock. Harry pulled his arm away and linked their hands on the bedding.
As Harry bid his children farewell, he reflected that this was definitely a happy ending.  He looked at his husband.  "Home, now."
“Blaise isn’t much for duelling, really.  He’s had the same training as me, of course, but he much prefers longer and more intricate spell casting, like the kind my cousins practice.  In particular, my cousin Grettir specialises in ancient rituals.  He and Blaise have often worked on them together.  That’s what he’s good at.”
Looking at Malfoy holding the Cavalier, Harry had to observe that there were no similarities between Belle’s broad head with its smiling mouth and Malfoy’s narrow, serious face.  Whatever the reason for the nickname Malfoy had been given, it was not, as Florence had suggested, a physical likeness.  Perhaps, as Charlotte had said, it was due to Malfoy’s behaviour, or perhaps it was just cruelty.  Harry suspected the latter as he considered Belle’s shining dark eyes and perpetually wagging tail.
Draco just looked at him. “If you’re going to be sick, sir, could you do it somewhere that isn’t on me.”
"It's okay, baby." Harry reassured him softly.  "It's gonna hurt a bit but I'll make it worth it, I promise."
Harry found himself disconcerted by this glimpse into Malfoy and Snape’s relationship.  “That doesn’t sound like Snape.”
Draco looked uncertain and moved to sit at Harry's feet.  "Greg said you're gonna spend some time with me at the weekend."
Draco looked at him for a moment, then his eyes drifted to the alter behind Harry.  “I don’t know if I want to go.”  He said softly.
“You will join us for dinner,” Louis broke in, more a command than a question.  “And you, of course, Draco.  I won’t dine without my brother beside me on his first night at home.”  Harry didn’t miss the look the King shot behind him at Lucius Malfoy, who was watching the exchange with a sour expression.
Harry sighed.  “No.  Well, maybe.  He gave me a letter from his half-brother.  You know, his brother’s the King of France.”
“We should go in.”  Snape muttered, but he still hesitated in front of the door.  Louis’ temper had grown no better since Harry had first met him, and if the news was bad instead of good there was no saying what was waiting for them behind the door.
In fact, Draco had never been touched sexually.  Not even by himself.  Not even before he had turned seventeen.  He couldn't, couldn't bring himself pleasure without permission and couldn't allow another to before he was claimed.  Once he was claimed only his master could touch him or give permission for him to touch himself.  Harry groaned low in his throat, if he claimed Draco he would be the first and last to bring him pleasure.  The master, of course, could do as they pleased.  They could have as many lovers as they wanted.
“And is that how you want to spend you Christmas?  Chatting up politicians and royalty who just want to use your fame for their own ends?”  Harry had told her about Scrimgeour’s visit.
As they left, Malfoy bade Snape goodnight.  Harry still felt a twinge of envy and guilt in his gut whenever he saw Malfoy and Snape interact.  Not that Snape ever seemed to say anything particularly nice to Malfoy, but Malfoy seemed to understand Snape’s attitude better than Harry ever had and reacted with joviality.
Malfoy already looked exhausted, and as he went on to outline the other preparations that would need to be made in the next few days, Harry understood why.  A tailor was coming from Paris to make sure both of them had outfits in the latest court fashion.  “So send to Gringotts, Potter” Malfoy said, “it’s going to be exorbitantly expensive.”  And there were gifts to buy for the King and Queen, and the new Dauphin, both to mark their arrival and to give on Christmas Eve.  “But I’ll pick them,” Malfoy assured him, “you just put your name on the card.”  They hadn’t even left Hogwarts yet, and Harry already couldn’t wait for it to be over.
Kingsley shifted uncomfortably. "Harry Potter came to visit me two weeks ago, he made me aware of new evidence that has not yet been brought to light."
Draco touched the teacher's arm gently.  "Thank you, Godfather."  Snape just nodded and gave them both a handful of floo powder.
Malfoy be frowned.  “You may not like Professor Snape, but be careful about what you say about him at court.  He is also the King’s godfather.”
Draco stormed into his room, Harry and Snape following closely enough to see the door smack into wall with enough force to damage the plaster.  Harry hadn’t seen such a display of emotion from the other boy in quite some time.
Pansy and Draco were already at their desks flanking Mr Potter’s door when he finally arrived at the office, looking flustered and creased despite the fact that Draco had spelled his robes straight not half an hour earlier.
Draco gasped, then he reached out and touched the metal.  "Its beautiful.  Am I really allowed to wear it?"
Harry stood looking up at Hogwarts.  It had been well repaired from the final battle and looked much like it had in his sixth year.  He stood at the entrance with the rest of the eighth years.  He, Ron and Hermione had decided to return to get their NEWTs.  Harry and Ron still wanted to be Aurors and Hermione wanted to be a Mediwitch.  There were five Gryffindors, four Raveclaws, two Hufflepuffs and three Slytherins so far.
When Draco approached him, Harry held out his hand.  "Would you do me the honour giving me the next dance?"
“His brother, in fact.”  Harry stood now, encroaching a little on the other man’s space.  “Is Draco here?”
Harry nodded grudgingly, he couldn’t deny that his skin was already itching from inaction.  “Are Ron and Hermione okay?”
Snape shrugged, “We’ll simply have to keep trying.  If we continue to appeal to his Majesty, perhaps he’ll see reason.”
The friar stepped back.  “I don’t know if I can share such details with you.  This can be a place of sanctuary for some.”
It was Vince who answered him.  "Draco's with Pansy getting ready, and Theo and Blaise are purifying the space we're going use.  Once that's all done we'll go and cast the circle and start the ritual.  So in about ten minutes."
This, of course, convinced Ron further that Draco had not changed in the slightest, and convinced Harry of the exact opposite.
Harry looked over at Draco, who had kept silent so far.  He was watching the argument with wide, silver eyes.  Greg reached over and put a comforting arm around him.  Harry remembered that night on the Astronomy Tower.  At the time he had blamed Draco, but after much thought he had come to believe that most people would have done the same thing if their loved ones had been threatened.  Even then, knowing the consequences, Draco hadn't been able to murder Dumbledore.
Whatever response the King was going to make was cut off by a flash of light in the centre of the table.  They all jumped back, startled.
Crabbe's eyes slid away.  "Yeah, we thought you might have noticed that, you always had a thing for watching Draco." He looked over at Goyle, who nodded.  "We don't want this getting round, yeah? We wouldn't usually tell people, but we do owe you guys, and we figure we can trust you." Harry was startled, but tried to hide it.  "Draco's a magical submissive, turned on his seventeenth birthday."
Malfoy instructed him in the etiquette of the French court until just after nine, when they were interrupted by the door that led into Snape’s classroom opening.  Snape strode through and Malfoy broke off his sentence concerning the correct way to address the Queen and smiled at his godfather.
Surprise showed on the woman's face before she recovered herself.  "A necklace or bracelet or something else?"
"I'm sorry, Master, please don't Reject me, please.  I'll do whatever you want to make it up to you, please give me whatever punishment you want, but please don't Reject me." Draco's words came out in a rush, begging Harry not to break up with him.
"This court has convened to hear the appeal of Lucius Malfoy." Madam Bones began.  "Would the defence like to open."
“Where we met the Grand Condé?”  Harry was still trying to get his head around the geography of the palace.
Harry looked as well.  The hall beyond was in the same white stone, gilt with gold.  It was cavernous.  More than double the height of the corridor they had left, there was only a balcony running around the edge of the chapel at their height, and from his angle Harry couldn’t see the floor below them.  There were pillars along the length of the balcony and the domed ceiling high above ceiling was richly painted with religious imagery.  Directly opposite Harry was a golden organ with silver pipes.  The room was captivating.  It was the first demonstration Harry had seen of the true luxury and extravagance of Versailles.
“In the meantime we will ensure no harm comes to our little cousin.”  Skarpheðinn added, clapping Malfoy on the shoulder hard enough to make him stagger.  “I’m sure we can count on your assistance, Lord Potter.”  Harry nodded but didn’t get a chance to reply before Malfoy interrupted.
Snape didn’t exactly return the grip.  He stood stiffly and placed a hand on King Louis’ arm.  “It’s good to see you, your Majesty.”  He replied.  “I trust you enjoyed the hunt.”
“It’s no trouble to apparate here before I go home, sir, but I really think you should go to bed now if you don’t want to wake up on the sofa tomorrow.”
“You don’t have to be that polite… y’know. Pansy… not that polite.” Mr Potter replied with a nudge to Draco’s side.
"It's the ladybird wings next," Draco said with smile.  "If you put the Passion Flower in now, it'll explode."
“But don’t you see, the French court has always supported the Ministry in fighting Voldemort, and King Louis has made it very clear that he’s going to continue that.  He even made a statement last summer that any reports of Voldemort’s return should be investigated fully.  That’s as much support as he could have given you.  It’s more than the Ministry gave you, they waited until they had proof dumped on their doorstep before they admitted there might be anything wrong.  You have to make the most of it, even if it means making nice with Malfoy.”
Greg looked at him intently.  "You don't have to do this, you know.  You still have another week to complete the bond."
“Some in the French court claim that the name Jean-Luc was chosen to honour the King’s stepfather, Lucius Malfoy.  This continues the controversy over His Majesty’s close relationship to his stepfather that began when he ascended to the throne in 1993, at the age of nineteen, and requested that the Wizengamot return the Earldom of Wiltshire to his stepfather.  Readers will remember that the Wizengamot stripped Lord Malfoy’s title from him in 1979 for adultery, which was at the time still a crime under wizarding law, when he seduced Narcissa Black, the then Dauphine, away from King Louis’s father, the late Charles XV of France, then Dauphin.  As adultery has been legal since 1990, His Majesty’s petition was granted by the Wizengamot in spite of opposition from the Chief Warlock Albus Dumbledore.  His Majesty also revived the title of Duc d’Orleans, which he bestowed on his half brother Draco Malfoy in 1994.”
“No, it’s hardly a secret.  Much discussed in wizarding circles, I understand.”  Malfoy gives Harry another long look.
His relationship with Snape had improved from his school days, what with their having fought a war together and their joint concern for Draco, but the man still preferred limited small talk.
“Severus wants you to keep it.”  Harry said, and saw the relief in Draco’s eyes, the exhale that untensed his shoulders.
Harry sat down on Draco's bed and pulled the boy close to him without hesitation.  He had to be dominant and in control.  Draco snuggled into his shoulder, still shaking a little.  Calm and caring, he reminded himself.
"I'll let you and your friends miss my class on Thursday afternoon to perform the ceremony, if that won't be too soon."
His first lesson was double defence with the seventh and eighth year Gryffindors and Ravenclaws.  There was a new defence teacher called Zac Goldmann.  He was knowledgable and made class interesting, but Harry really missed Remus.  He entered the classroom with Draco slightly behind him.
"So I wouldn't have to sit with little shits like you." Harry finally was allowed to finish a sentence and shouldered past him into the room, pulling Draco along with him by the hand.
“You should refer to the King as ‘Your Majesty’ or ‘Sire’.  When entering a room, nobility enter in order of precedence.  As you are a guest, the King may wish for you to assume a particular position, but unless otherwise directed, Marquises come directly after Dukes.  If it’s any comfort to you, you will precede my father.”  The thought did indeed give Harry some satisfaction, but he quickly clamped down on it.  All of this stuff was ridiculous anyway.  “At Versailles, every moment of the day is proscribed by routine.  The day starts with the King’s petit lever in his bedchamber.  It’s now a smaller event than it has been in the past.  Only a privileged few are allowed to attend, mainly those nobles who serve as gentlemen of the bedchamber.  You may or may not be granted access to the King at this time, it depends how well His Majesty likes you.  Then there is the grand lever, when the King leaves his rooms and goes to mass, it is important that every member of the court is present at this time if they wish for advancement.  I would recommend attending both the grand lever and mass if you wish to make headway with the King.  Also there are hunts, parties and dinners that you must be seen at.  On Christmas Eve there will be a ballet, and another on Boxing Day.  There will be a feast at midnight on Christmas Eve, when gifts will be exchanged.  Christmas Day itself will be a day of hunting and repose.  Evenings are spent playing cards and making polite conversation.  Every interaction you will have with another courtier will be political in nature.  Ensure that you show appropriate deference to those above you in the hierarchy.  Address them as ‘sir’ or ‘monsieur’.”
"I'm sorry, I just can't.  Can you imagine what people would say?" Kingsley shook his head emphatically.
“Just tired from all of the dancing and feasting at Versailles, I’m sure.”  Zabini interjected, clapping a hand onto Malfoy’s shoulder.  For some reason, the familiarity irritated Harry.
“I’d rather disembowel myself.”  Harry assured her as Ron simultaneously said, “Urgh, Hermione, don’t be disgusting.”
“Of course,” Harry laughed a little, “they’re yours, Draco.  They’ve been missing you,” he pushed a little, “pining, I think.”
“Most agreeable, thank you, Sire.”  A man, presumably Blouin, detached himself from group and lead Harry out of the room.
"Can you imagine what people would say if the Chosen One, who'd just increased his power tenfold by bonding with a magical submissive, spoke out against you."
"We haven't apologised for the shit we did to them, either.  We've all just tried to put the past behind us.  Clearly, you can't."
Harry guided Draco into the Great Hall with his hand in the small of the blond's back.  Not many people seemed to notice this, they were mostly half asleep and focussed on their food.  But when Harry led them to the Slytherin table it attracted more attention.  He made his way to a space on the table with Greg and Vince flanking him.
“How about you and me go out for a drink sometime and practice some magical togetherness?” Ron’s pick up lines were awful, but he looked hopeful.
“You don’t have to.”  Harry said quickly, even though he wasn’t sure that was true.  “You can go back to England,” and then without conscious permission, “or you can come and stay with me.”
Greg and Vince watched in surprise Harry led their friend away.  He lead them to their room and pulled the chair away from the desk.  "Sit." He instructed.  Draco sat with trepidation, looking up at Harry with fear in his eyes, tears beginning to shine.  He was wearing the cuffs Harry had given him.  "I told you not smoke anymore and you disobeyed me.  What do you have to say, Draco?"
As class ended, Harry pulled Draco into an empty classroom.  It was break so they wouldn't be missed.  Draco's eyes were lowered and he hadn't spoken a word since breakfast.
They were rapidly approaching the end of the corridor, signified by a pair of busts flanking duck egg blue doors.  The doors swung open as they approached and Harry followed Malfoy into the next room.  He found himself on a balcony that had a railing along its length on the right and a wall with a single opening on the left.
“The magical community are notoriously conservative.  Even in England we don’t have anything approaching a democracy.  The Wizengamot choose the Minister of Magic from among their own ranks, there’s no public vote.  In France they’re even more traditionalist, I think the King rules more or less as an absolute monarch.”  At Harry’s confused express she elaborated, “That means the king decides everything.”
Harry stared in shock, Draco was not usually this timid, or formal.  "Oh, um, you can call me Harry."
“Not much going for me here.”  Montespan stretched languidly.  “Not unless Florence de Rohan changes her mind.”
Greg touched Malfoy's arm gently.  He looked up.  "Draco, but these guys," he gestured this friends, "call me Dove.  I have no idea why."
Malfoy’s terse answers were beginning to irritate Harry.  “You always were his favourite.”  He sneered.
“No, I know.  I just don’t understand what the fuss is about.  I’ll make my case, and the King will make his decision.  What’s all this need for discussion?”
“Oh,” said Harry, self conscious in front of the beautiful Queen, “only good things, I hope, Your Majesty.”
"I think it's pretty clear that you're not still behaving the way you were before.  To everyone except Ron, anyway."
“Yes,” Malfoy agreed, but did not elaborate.  He sat himself down in one of the chairs, Snape’s, Harry thought, and gestured to the other.  “Have a seat.”
Hermione nodded in understanding. "Yes, well," she smiled gently, "I suppose we're all just going to have to get over ourselves."
Belle settled into Harry’s lap without complaint and Harry laid a tentative hand on her warm flank.  He wasn’t entirely comfortable with the fragile little thing in his hands, but his mind was on Draco’s words.  “Do you think I can persuade him?”
Vince frowned.  "Well, Hermione already knows, Neville doesn't seem like the type of guy to ask and no one else will notice if you have Draco with you."
Harry pushed the door open and entered the dark room.  Snape sat at the desk but stood as Harry entered.
“His brother is King Louis France.  Draco Malfoy is the Duc d’Orleans.”  The friar looked stunned.  Harry leant in.  “As you might imagine, His Majesty is extremely concerned with the Duc’s safety.  If Draco is here, you need to bring him to me.”  Harry didn’t mean to be menacing, but he could feel the dark tension within himself.  He needed to know if Draco was here, to see him with his own eyes and see if he was safe and well.
Harry dropped down onto the bed.  It had been a trying three days; people didn't seem to be able to keep their mouths shut about him and Draco.  Once the Slytherins had been firmly told to shut up or get cursed by Harry and the eighth year Slytherins, they mostly kept their thoughts to themselves, too interested in self-preservation to risk a hexing from the Boy-Who-Lived(-Twice).  The Gryffindors, on the other hand, just didn't know when to shut up.  Three days after his courtship had started and Harry had already cursed five of them, and a couple of Ravenclaws and a Hufflepuff to boot.
Harry pushed into him fully without warning, finding his prostate on the first try.  Draco screamed into the pillow and bucked as much as he could with his hands tied in front of him and legs stretched behind.  Harry pulled out as quickly as he'd sunk in, starting a punishing rhythm.  Draco was moaning continuously, back arching and wrists tugging against the restraints.  A litany of pleas fell continuously from his lips.
The door opened and Ron entered, followed closely by Draco. “Will that be all, sir?” He looked exactly as Harry had envisaged, flustered and fluffy while trying to appear detached.
Draco made eye contact with Harry for a long moment, his eyes flat with that familiar blank expression.  “I think perhaps I should speak to the Marquis alone, thank you, Dominic.”
"It's part of the bond.  So you'll have to decide which table you want to sit at.  Gryffindor or Slytherin?"
Harry stepped over the threshold.  The floor was tiled in black and white, and the walls were a cream stone.  On the right were windows spilling light across the tiles and on the left various statues of men carved from the same cream stone stood in alcoves.
"I probably would have before I got to know you guys properly." There was silence as they both contemplated the past.
“Well, it’s not like I get a choice in who sends me letters.  He wants me to go to France for Christmas.”
He stood.  The friar was saying something but Harry wasn’t listening.  He was only concerned with looking at Draco, assessing him for damage, trying to determine whether he was pleased or distressed by Harry’s intrusion into this quiet world.  Draco was taller, of course, both he and Harry had grown since they were sixteen.  Draco hadn’t filled out like Harry had though, he was lean, and he still looked fragile.  The brittleness that had existed in him in their sixth year was still there, but at least he didn’t look as exhausted as he did in Harry’s memories.  His skin had a bit more colour and his eyes were a bit brighter.  Harry couldn’t see any evidence of torture, Draco had walked up the aisle easily enough, and his face was unmarred, but of course there was the rest of him to consider.  And Harry could certainly consider it.
Draco was currently studying Arithmancy with Theo in the library.  It was the only subject that Draco took that Harry didn't, and he took all the subjects Harry was doing, just mostly in different classes.  Of course he had to miss his lesson to be with Harry, so Snape had arranged for Theo to help him catch up on missed lessons during Harry's free periods.
“Er – don’t call him that – that would be the rather expensive honeymoon I buy them very publically as a wedding present. Hopefully it’ll show my happiness at their nuptials. Then, when Dapnhe is Mrs Gregory Goyle, she can release the story of how I wasn’t actually proposing. God knows if anyone will believe it, but that’s not really important. At least no one will be able to say either of us has wronged the other, and that’ll be the end of that.”
Harry gulped, he hadn't realised Snape would interpret it like that.  "I don't want to humiliate him, sir.  Over the last few weeks we've grown to know each other better and I think I could bond with him."
"Yeah, but we also thought they couldn't string a sentence together, yet clearly they can.  Also, Pansy was perfectly civil to me earlier, not one word about being a mudblood.  I'd say there's plenty we don't know about the Slytherins."
It was then that he heard a delighted squeal from behind him. “Oh look, that’s Harry Potter and Daphne Greengrass, isn’t it? I knew it, I just knew it!”
“What precautions?  Has Dumbledore agreed?”  He had agreed to Dementors, so Harry wasn’t particularly surprised.
“It’s Christmas Eve, we should be enjoying ourselves, no?”  He sounded a little unsteady.  “Whiskey, Potter?”
“But from what?”  Snape murmured, clearly unwilling to further spook those milling around him.  “An infiltration of some kind?”
Kingsley's eyes widened and flicked from Draco to Harry to Draco again.  "Whatever trouble you've gotten yourself into, I can help you, Harry."
“They’ve been staying with me since you’ve been gone.”  Harry explained, feeling a little breathless.
On Thursday morning, Harry woke up happier than he'd ever been in his life.  He was going to bond with Draco and it was going to be perfect.  In the bed next to his, Draco was sitting up, rubbing his eyes.
Harry quieted him, then looked at him sternly.  "I'm not going to Reject you, but you will be punished."
“We had biscuits.  Didn’t we, Potter?”  Harry was too surprised at being included in their conversation to respond.
"I have something that would make it even more obvious, sir.  It's a bonding gift from Pansy.  I thought she was being a little presumptuous at the time, but you can see if you like it." He reached into his dresser and pulled out a little velvet bag, emptying the contents into his hand.
"What are you accusing my Godson of this time, Potter?" There was still a bit of the old Snape in there somewhere after all.
Harry’s suite was sumptuous.  They were on the second floor of the central part of the palace.  Harry had been able to work out by looking out of the windows on his way through the palace that the hallway they had arrived in was on the first floor of one of the wings of the building, and the room they had met the King in connected that wing to the main building.  Blouin had led Harry up a flight of stairs and out towards the front of the building, whereas the Salon of Hercules was at the back.  The walls of the suite were white panelled wood, but the furniture was covered in turquoise and gold silk.  There were several sitting rooms and a bathroom, as well as a spacious bedroom with a canopy bed.  Harry found his trunk waiting for him, and unpacked a few items.  Then, as the King had suggested, Harry rested.
She retreated for a second before returning with a box.  She opened it to reveal three items.  A bracelet about eight centimetres wide, a hair clasp and a collar.  They were all white gold and all studded with emeralds.
Harry entered the jewelry store cautiously.  He had left Draco with Greg and Vince after they had gotten back from Potter Manor while he had gone into Hogsmeade.  He was looking for something to buy Draco, something expensive.  Jewelry shops always scared him, though.  The sales assistants always jumped on you to try and make you buy something, if you refused help they watched you suspiciously as you browsed.
Snape treated Harry to his characteristic sardonic sneer.  “Quite well, thank you.”  He looked at Montespan.  “If you’ll excuse us, Alexandre, I need to speak with the Marquess.”
Draco watched Mr Potter sway to a sitting position the sofa. He and Draco had attended the departmental celebration of Daphne and Greg’s elopement at the Leaky, and Mr Potter had been so well on his way to being completely wankered that Draco couldn’t in good conscience allow him to apparate home himself. It was hardly the first time Draco had seen his employer in such a state, and he knew Mr Potter to be a good-natured drunk, so it wasn’t too arduous a task, more amusing than anything else.
"I know that.  It just seems to weird.  My own mother wouldn't want to turn me into The Chosen One, she wouldn't want to force me into a life like the one I've had."
"So what should we do?" he asked her softly.  If Hermione thought there was something wrong, there was something wrong.
“What was so important that you missed dinner?”  Harry asked as they made their way down the darkened corridor.
"Today you will be making a healing draft.  Instructions are on the board.  Vials to be handed to me at the end of the lesson." His voice was tired.
And then he leaned forward and pressed his lips messily to Draco’s. Draco wanted to push him off and tell him he was drunk and that they should both just go to bed – separately – but somehow that just didn’t happen. Somehow Draco was melting backwards and moaning into Harry’s mouth and trying to get their bodies as close together as possible. When they broke apart for air Harry smiled dopily down at him. “Now… bed’s a good idea.”
"What?" asked Harry, alarmed.  "No, I don't think so." He sounded unconvincing even to his own ears.
His curse made contact and Zabini went down, legs twitching uncontrollably.  In the time it took him to mutter the counter-charm, Malfoy had emerged from the other side of the desk.  Malfoy cast Collocorpus, a sticking hex, but Zabini managed to roll out of the way and cast Reducto on his way to his feet.  Malfoy ducked down behind the desk again.  Malfoy proceeded to bombard Zabini with a succession of hexes and jinxes from under and over the desk.  Zabini was hardly able to return any fire in between defending himself.  Harry could read the frustration on his face as his wand work became sloppier, and in the end, Malfoy’s Anteoculatia broke his defences.  A pair of very fine antlers sprouted from Zabini’s head, and his face contorted.
Harry pushed in until he bottomed out.  He stayed there a while, with Draco thrashing and begging.  Then, when he was almost overwhelmed by the pressure, he pulled out so only the head remained inside Draco.  Harry paused for what felt like an infinite moment.  Tears slid down Draco's cheeks, Harry leaned up and kissed him, then slammed back in.  Draco screamed.
“Very much.  We must have brought down at least five deer.  I think we shall have them for a New Year’s feast.  Are you well.”
As Harry watched, frozen, Greg blinked his eyes open.  He sat up and shook Vince awake.  Vince looked around groggily then his eyes fixed on Draco.  They both got out of bed and made their way over to the crying boy.
“Come in, come in.”  Slughorn gestured them in good-naturedly.  “Sit yourselves down.”  Harry and Neville sat on the same side as Slughorn, but left a seat free between Neville and the rotund professor.  Harry found himself opposite Malfoy, but the boy did not meet Harry’s gaze.  “Do you all know each other?”  Slughorn enquired solicitously.  “You four are in the same year,” he indicated Harry, Neville, Zabini and Malfoy, “so I expect you do already.”
“Or,” Lady Florence suggested, “the Chevalier de Maintenon.”  The two descended into fits of giggles.
"I have a six year-old sister.  What, I should have let her die?  Is that what you would have done with your precious Gryffindor bravery?" Blaise hissed.
Lisette tutted good-naturedly.  “She hasn’t done a single thing I’ve asked her since you’ve left.  You’ll have to do some more training with her, Draco, I’m sure I can’t make her behave herself.”
Harry closed his eyes, imagining Draco under him, unable to come without Harry's permission.  Would he beg and writhe?  What would happen if Harry denied him completion?  Harry shook with the idea, the power would be addictive.  He would have to be careful not to abuse it, but if he got the balance right it would be incredible.
Draco had also helped him once more in potions since the first lesson, once again catching Harry's hand before he could add the wrong ingredient, averting the disaster.  Which reminded Harry of the other thing that had been bothering him: Snape.  In all the lessons Harry had had so far he had done what he did that first lesson, give instructions and leave.  Ginny told him that Snape did the same thing in the seventh year lessons.  It was so out of character, Harry wondered what was going on.  Harry and Ginny hadn't got back together after the final battle.  Ginny had got back with Dean, and Harry couldn't bring himself to be upset.  Over the summer he had experimented a bit, found out he like both boys and girls, that he preferred to top guys than bottom, that he actually got a bit dominant in bed.  Which brought him, with a blush, back to Draco.  He wondered who would claim him.  Hermione said that they had to love him - but the amount of control they'd have over him, some part of Harry didn't like the idea of someone controlling Draco to that extent.  But then what was he going to do about it? Claim him?  Somehow, Harry couldn't see it.
"No, it's not okay.  You bloody Slytherins are so full of it.  You come back here like nothing happened.  Showing off you Dark Marks.  Prancing around, taking over our dormitory.  You should all be in Azkaban with you're worthless parents."
"I'm glad you haven't freaked out or started hating us for lying to you.  We would have told you earlier, but we assumed you wouldn't believe us and would think we were making excuses for what we've done."
“We’re above the chapel vestibule,” Malfoy explained.  They approached the opening in the left-hand wall and Harry saw that it was in fact another pair of blue doors, decorated with gold and open to show another balcony beyond.  “That’s the chapel through there.”  Malfoy gazed out through the doors and crossed himself absently.
Harry wanted to so much, but he knew he'd hurt Draco if he did it now.  Instead he pushed in another finger.  Draco gasped and thrust his hips as Harry massaged his prostate.  His back arched, long hair spread around him.
"We'll cast a circle, then you and Draco will be bonded in front of the Goddess.  Pansy will do the honours, she knows the ritual.  All you have to do is say yes to all the questions, Draco already knows his part."
"This is very important." Severus told him again.  "There's a diadem in the Room of Hidden Things.  It needs to be destroyed, Fiend Fyre should do it.  There's no time to explain."
Draco sat in the common room, leaning over his homework.  He frowned, pulling Blaise's essay towards him.  "The gillyweed definitely reacts with cowslip, not the catnip."
The Order took Voldemort by surprise at his stronghold deep in the heart of the Ministry.  Harry let the others deal with his minions.  While Crabbe and Goyle and Draco’s cousins took care of the Death Eaters that blocked the way, Harry strode through the tumult and into the room in which the Dark Lord was holding court.  There were a few more Death Eaters here, of course, and Harry soon found himself battling the shield they had formed in front of Voldemort.  Harry was not alone, either.  He had Snape beside him, and Flosi and Enghein had overcome their adversaries in the corridor to join Harry.  Battered and bleeding, the four of them managed to remove the final barrier to Voldemort.  He was less than Harry remembered him from when they had last met almost two years earlier.  Then he had seemed all-powerful, terrifying and invulnerable.  Now Harry saw him for what he was, a twisted man whose skill in the Dark Arts and manipulating others had not been enough to defeat the forces allied against him.  His presence still filled the room, brooding and malevolent, and he felt Enghein falter beside him, but it no longer had any effect on Harry.
“Is that likely?”  Harry asked.  Louis hadn’t seemed like the type to want to exterminate all muggles and muggleborns, but he might be self-centred enough to acquiesce to Voldemort’s demands to keep his life comfortable.
Harry summoned lubricant from his bedside table.  He removed his fingers and slicked them with it before gently pushing them back inside Draco, their movement aided by the viscous liquid.  He pushed them in further and Draco's whole body tensed as Harry touched his prostate.
But it didn’t come to that, and Harry, Malfoy and Flosi were only waiting a half hour after Ron and Hermione left before Professor McGonagall entered.
“You’re not going to try and turn me into a werewolf, are you?  Like Zabini tried to with Malfoy.”  Harry asked when the Slytherin sat down beside him.
Greg nodded as if he had expected this.  "Good," he said sincerely.  "You should talk to Severus, though."
Harry redoubled his efforts and thrust harder into Draco’s body. He could feel himself reaching his peak, and he made sure to hit Draco’s prostate with every thrust, wanting to bring Draco off before he lost control. Draco was clenching around him uncontrollably, thrashing on the bed and whimpering little strings of nonsense to himself. Harry saw his cock twitch, and then he was coming, streaking both of their stomachs and calling out Harry’s name. Harry wasn’t far behind him, the contractions of Draco’s body bringing him over the edge in just another few thrusts.
When they arrived at the station, Morgana shot them a look.  "I'd ask what kept you, Daddy, but I don't think I want to know."
Harry stood with Ron outside the Defence classroom.  Defence lessons with Snape hadn’t been as appalling as Harry had feared.  They had focuses not, as Remus had done, on magical beings, and not, as Umbridge tried, on theory, but rather on the practical skills necessary to defeat an opposing wizard.  So far, Snape had drilled them on hexes, jinxes, counter curses and defensive magic.  He had promised them that in this lesson, they would be able to put all this to use and duel each other.  Harry had found himself reluctantly looking forward to the lessons, in spite of the teacher, and was rather excited to actually get some duelling practice.  He also felt that they were finally learning something constructive, something that Harry, and everyone else who was going to be sucked into this war, could actually use.
Harry frowned as he realised this was true.  He avoided most people because they had a tendency to hero-worship.  Neville was rapidly taking Ron's place in the Golden trio, which was a relief because it meant an end to having to listen to Ron and Hermione's bickering.
“Well,” Hermione said emphatically, and Harry wondered if he was going to regret asking.  “Louis XVII had a sister, called Marie Thérèse, and Charles X had a son, Louis Antoine, and they got married.”  She drew them onto the tree.  “Louis Antoine’s mother was a witch, and he was a wizard.  So when Marie Thérèse and Louis Antoine had a son-”
The spoke for a little longer about the plan to free Lucius, then moved on to more personal matters.
Mr Potter paled at that. “Damn, this is serious. Do you have any ideas, Draco? Perhaps we should leak the photos of the Lithuanian Embassy Christmas Ball, after all. It would make a point. You still have them, don’t you?”
“You’re actually quite important, Potter, I don’t know if you’ve noticed.  Anyway, I’m not stupid enough to get on Draco’s bad side, you saw what he did to Blaise.”
She smoothed the paper out on the table while she poured tea from the teapot into a cup with her other hand, then she added milk and stirred before she settled in to skim the front page.  It took her less than a minute, and then she sat back with a smile.
Harry heard a commotion across the hall.  Louis was there, his white nightgown covered with an ornate golden robe.
“I must speak to my superior.”  The Friar turned as quickly as he could, robes flapping with him, and hurried between the pews.  Harry fought the urge to restrain him, or follow him, and instead sank back down onto the bench.  He hoped he hadn’t been too heavy handed, and that the Franciscans, who ran the wizarding portion of the church, would bring Draco to him rather than resisting or spiriting him away.
“The wards are linked directly to the castle foundations.”  Hermione explained.  “We’re feeling the full force of the spells hitting them.  If they break the castle could start to come down around our ears.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed for a moment as he calculated, weighing what he knew about his brother’s personality, whether such an approach would work.  “I don’t know,” he repeated.
Draco leant forward and fixed Harry with his disconcerting blank gaze.  “It’s of utmost importance that the King take your side, the Ministry is doing nothing to fight the Dark Lord.  The King’s support, both politically and militarily, is your best chance of destroying him.”  Harry hadn’t heard Draco talk so openly about the purpose of Harry’s visit before.
“Precisely.  As soon as Mr Malfoy had found cover he had one.  You must remember to be aware of your surroundings when you duel, whether they can offer you safety, or” he looked straight at Harry, “danger.”  Harry thought, involuntarily, of Sirius falling through the Veil, as he was sure Snape had intended.  He wasn’t sure whether Snape was being cruel or simply trying to hammer his point home.  Watching him interact with Malfoy had confused Harry’s view of him.  “What else?”
Harry tucked a strand of hair out of Draco's eyes.  "Okay, more than a crush.  I think I'm starting to see why Greg and Vince were so anxious for me to wake up and like you." He gave Draco a cheeky smile.
Harry took it from him.  It was a little silver lightning bolt, with a ring at the top designed to be a pendant or charm.  Harry threaded the ring through the hole in the collar designed for that specific purpose.  It looked perfect, balancing the rest of the collar and adding interest.
"Yes, but you could have beaten the crap out of him for disobeying you, instead you gave him a punishment that will actually help him understand  rather than just make him afraid to cross you."
“Now, usual training duel rules apply; do try not maim one another.  And for the benefit of the audience, cast your spells aloud.  Do you understand?”  Both Slytherins nodded.  “Then you may begin.”
Draco led them back up the path to the palace.  They entered through a small door in the central building, and then made their way up a sweeping staircase.  The King was waiting for them in the Hall of Mirrors.
"Might be a bit of a problem for some of us.  Ron nearly had a fit when he found out Crabbe and Goyle are sharing a bed."
Daphne looked at him as though she thought he was mentally handicapped. “Of course I have, but they don’t care. This is the most advantageous marriage they could have hoped for, and they won’t let it go easily. They don’t see the fact that you didn’t mean to propose as any reason for us not to marry.”
"Please, please take me, Master.  Claim me, I want to be yours." Draco was crying now, the need to complete the bonding almost painful.
"Mr Potter, take a seat." He gestured to an armchair in front of the fireplace.  "Would you like a drink."
“And you always help you… help me, I mean… help me out. Even when you don’t have to. Maybe I should give you a raise.” The man giggled to himself. “Like that time at the Lith-u-anian Embassy… Embassy Ball… when they got pictures of me getting head from the Lith… Lithaynan quiddutch… quidditch player who plays for the Falcons.”
The doors at the other end of the balcony were guarded by red-robed sentries standing immobile and imposing.  Malfoy scarcely checked his stride as they stepped out of his way and opened the doors.  Harry was close at Malfoy’s heels as they entered the Salon of Hercules.  It was, unlike what had gone before, not white.  Instead, the walls were decorated in slabs of red or blue veined marble, with gilt moulding and a classical scene painted onto the ceiling.  It was large room, though not in the same league as the chapel, and there were arched windows on two sides making it bright and airy in spite of the imposing colours.  But Harry only took in the décor for a moment before is attention was drawn inexorably to the other end of the room, where a small group of people was clustered before the fireplace.
Voldemort crumpled.  Harry had discussed this with his little entourage.  Voldemort ruled through theatrics and creating fear, so they had decided that quick action would catch him off guard.  They knew that with his forces destroyed, the Dark Lord’s instinct would be to try to control the situation with rhetoric and posturing, intimidate those he couldn’t hope to beat by force.  Harry had never intended to give him the chance.
Harry couldn’t really bring himself to believe it though.  What were the chances of Draco having survived his time with the Death Eaters, his disfigurement at their hands, and somehow made his way to Prague?  It seemed impossible.
Harry leaned down and met Draco's lips with his own.  It was only their second kiss but Draco opened his mouth for Harry immediately.  Harry still had the blond's arms pinned to the wall above his head, now he moved Draco's wrists into one hand and used the spare one to pull their bodies together.  Harry groaned at the feeling of Draco's hips pressed against him while he continued to explore Draco's mouth with his tongue.  This was rapidly becoming too intense.  Harry somehow found the strength to pull away from Dove's mouth gently.
It worked, though.  Malfoy showed no emotion, but after a moment of thought he nodded shortly.  “Fine.  Meet me at seven in Professor Snape’s office.”
Snape seemed to inherit Bors and Ajax, because they were at Hogwarts when Harry returned, with the run of the dungeons, teaching Fang to catch rabbits.  Or perhaps they belonged to Zabini, now, because the flanked him like a canine Crabbe and Goyle when he confronted Harry.
One good thing had come out of it though.  Professor Snape had given them their own room, it was being cleaned at the moment, but it would be ready by tomorrow.  Harry was relieved to say the least, he hadn't looked forward to claiming his submissive in a crowded dormitory, Draco deserved better than that.
The King banged a fist on the table.  “And why would one of our own court turn against us?  Never could I have conceived of such a betrayal.”
Harry did not immediately recognise the object Louis deposited onto the table, or at least he didn’t understand its significance.  It was a Rosary made of dark, gleaming wood.  There was a resounding silence for several moments.
Harry offered Draco the food with his fingers.  Draco willing opened his mouth and accepted the food.  His lips brushing Harry's skin as he closed them around the toast.  Harry had to stifle a moan as he immediately got hard.  Draco laid his head against Harry's thigh and Harry stroked his fingers through the soft, blonde hair.  Now Harry understood why this was the done thing, it was so intimate.
As Draco turned to the desk, Harry left him and went to the common room.  Greg and Vince were there and looked at him expectantly when he entered.
"Nice to know you have such a high opinion of us, Weasley." Blaise and Vince had come in behind Harry.  It was Blaise, unsurprisingly, who had spoken.  Could this get any worse?
“Oh right,” Malfoy said belatedly, “you haven’t met them.  Boys, sit.”  The wiggling continued for a moment and Malfoy said pointedly, “Please.”  They sat, heads up and eyes bright.  “Potter, this is Ajax,” Malfoy indicated the more brown-toned dog, “and Bors.”
Harry took hold of the other end of the portkey and a moment later felt the familiar twisting, jerking sensation of being dragged away.  He landed solidly on his back on a paved surface, his trunk skittering from his grip.  He lay for a few moments recovering the breath that had been knocked out of him.  Then Malfoy appeared above him and offered him a hand up.
“The King is waiting behind those doors.”  Malfoy brushed dust from Harry’s robes and straightened his collar anxiously.  The sudden contact startled Harry slightly, it was probably the closest they had come since their scuffles in previous years.  “Try not to make a fool of yourself.”
Or perhaps the dogs were Harry’s, because they joined him at Grimauld Place for the summer and stayed when he didn’t return to Hogwarts the next year.  Fighting Voldemort was a full time job, now, as was teaching the wolfhounds not to kill everything that moved in the little garden.  He also seemed to have inherited Crabbe and Goyle, who move into Grimauld place as well and provided mostly silent company for Harry as he made it his business to hunt down and capture every Death Eater he could get his hands on.  He let them do the interrogating, mostly, because they seemed to be very good at it.  And where did you say Voldemort was?  And what are his plans?  And have you seen Draco Malfoy?  But that last question was always answered by a negative, and then screams.
Lisette held her hands out and Harry handed her Belle.  Harry and Malfoy both bowed to the ladies and made their farewells.  The Queen continued her slow procession up the gallery, and Malfoy led Harry back the way Harry had come at a much swifter pace.
Harry could feel himself starting to loose control, but he wanted Draco to come first.  For some reason it seemed important to watch his submissive orgasm.
"We're going to be late.  Has everyone got everything they need?" There was a chorus of "yes, Dad".  "Harry, are you ready to go?"
“I don’t know really, just tired I suppose.  Too much time spent at a desk, its nothing really.”  He hesitated.  “But my father doesn’t want me to play this year.”  He admitted.
Harry sighed, cutting him off.  "No, it's okay.  You're right, and anyway, it's quite reassuring to see you're not as much of a pushover as I thought you might be."
Harry had no idea who Bonnaire was or what his work was like, but he nodded along sincerely.  Their Serene Highnesses, Harry guessed, were Lisette’s parents, the Prince and Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.  Maybe a portrait of the Dauphin would make the grandparents happy, Harry didn’t know.
He turned to Harry, and gestured that he continue walking down the path.  “I trust you haven’t been too bored by the Chevalier.”  Snape said, some of his good humour from his discussion with Montespan seeming to remain.
"Dove, why don't you go find Blaise.  I think he was looking for you." They looked up to see Greg walking over.
Being five foot seven and weighing eight stone wet through did not make Draco Malfoy any less of a force of nature. In fact, all his diminutive stature did was lure people into a false sense of security so that he could then bend them to his formidable will. It had been this ability that had kept him out of Azkaban after the war, had kept him from having his wand snapped and his magic bound. No amount of Malfoy will power, however, could keep him in possession of his family fortune, which had been seized by the ministry, leaving him all but destitute. This lack of funds was not a problem Draco had to contemplate for very long. In his efforts to remain unincarcerated, Draco had sat in the ministry holding cells and shaken, and looked fragile, and pouted – Merlin , how he’d pouted – until in the end Minister Shacklebolt’s wife herself had insisted to her husband that they simply couldn’t send such a sweet boy to Azkaban, and didn’t he see how delicate Draco was. Shacklebolt had grumbled and moaned but in the end had prized getting laid too much to protest overly, and really, the Malfoy boy couldn’t be that much of a threat. Still, he thought it best that Draco take some menial job at the ministry, just so everybody could keep an eye on him.
“They’re attacking all the way down by Hogsmeade?”  Harry was shocked.  “But the whole castle’s shaking.”
"The white gold will complement his looks, while the emeralds will reflect your eyes, Mr Potter." Harry was pleasantly surprised that she didn't make a fuss about who he was, but then an expensive jewelry shop in Hogsmeade probably got plenty of famous clientele.
Ron seemed momentarily at a loss.  Harry was glad the Slytherins were being so reasonable, Ron hadn't exactly been polite.  Someone up there, however, seemed to hate Harry, as Ron was evidently looking for a fight.
Malfoy hesitated.  “You may have noticed that there has been some anxiety about my safety this year.”
"Its quite alright, Mr Potter.  I understand how delicate the courting process is.  If anyone enquires, I will tell them that Draco spent the morning helping me with a potion."
“Of course.  He’s the closest thing I have to a brother.”  Then Malfoy hesitated, and added.  “Aside from His Majesty, of course.”  But Harry thought the first bit was the truth.
“Won’t you accompany me on a walk along the gallery, Lord Dorchester?”  Queen Élizabeth asked Harry.
The Slytherins all turned to him immediately, squashing onto the bed.  Greg pulled Draco into his lap, murmuring apologies.  Draco's father was in Azkaban awaiting to Dementor's Kiss.  Harry remembered after the final battle, Lucius holding Draco to him and refusing to let anyone else near him.  It had been oddly touching, Lucius' fierce protectiveness.
"Uh, yeah," Harry looked over at Hermione for help.  She gave none.  "We were wondering if there was something up with Malfoy."
“Well, what do you expect?”  Malfoy said now.  “My father’s past escapades and current preferment by the King have only stirred up the rivalry that has always existed between us.”
He took Crabbe’s free hand and the three of them sauntered over to where Zabini, Parkinson and Nott stood.  Their greetings were subdued.  They just exchanged quick kisses and nods.  Then McGonagall called them all together.
"And if we loose our souls somewhere between the torturing and the killing, it'll be fine." Lucius added.  "They can be casualties of war."
Montespan sighed.  “The King should just settle some nice country seat on him, so he doesn’t have to deal with all the drama here.”
Harry snapped.  "Ron, shut up!" He yelled, surprising even himself.  "He's about to loose a parent, have a little empathy."
That set Draco’s brain into motion again. He had been trying to get Mr Potter to go to bed because Mr Potter was absolutely off his face. And because he was absolutely off his face, this was definitely not a good idea. “No, Mr Potter, I don’t think that’s a good idea. I mean you should go to bed, but by yourself. You don’t want to do anything you’ll regret tomorrow.”
“For helping me out, you always help me out.” Mr Potter’s voice was indistinct against Draco’s shoulder.
"I'll bring him back," Mende looked between Severus and Draco, "for you both.  I won't see you mourn him."
“I’ll come,” Draco said, soft as an exhaled breath.  “To your house, to see the dogs.  Then we’ll see.”
“Weelll,” Lady Charlotte drew out the syllable, exchanging a significant look with her fellow Maid, “in that case perhaps you can answer a question for us.”
"He was explaining why he had to make me hate Slytherins.  He did a pretty good job of it too, back then.  He was so annoying that I didn't notice what an idiot Ron could be.  It gave us a united front." Harry sighed, remembering old times.  "But this is better, I like knowing the truth."
"Oh look, there's Theo and Pansy." Hermione quickly changed the subject while Harry and Draco sniggered.
Snape arrived the next day.  Harry had been awakened by a soft thump-scratch at his door, and once he had thrown a robe over his pyjamas and opened the door, he had found Bors standing there, waiting patiently.  “Er, give me a second.”  He had told the dog, feeling a bit stupid.  He had put his clothes on and followed the dog along corridors and down stairs until he was once again at Draco’s door.
Harry seemed to be on the same page as him, because he leant down and whispered into his ear.  "Soon, baby." It didn't do anything for Draco's predicament.
As the car came to a halt, Malfoy slid himself out and went round to the boot.  Popping it open he pulled out two holdalls.  He passed the first to Crabbe, who had followed him round, then grabbed the second himself.  His cigarette was finished so he threw it on the ground and ground it out with his foot.  His canvas shoes were scuffed and he was wearing a pair of shorts which only reached his mid-thigh, the hair on his legs must have been too pale to be seen.  He had on a strap top which was low cut enough to reveal his sculpted pecks but almost reached the bottom of his shorts, the braid of his hair also reached to that length.  The shorts were black and the top was pale grey with black writing that said:
“Harry,” Malfoy said, turning to him, and under that grey gaze Harry immediately felt included in the warmth that Belle’s appearance had engendered.  “Have you met Belle?”
Malfoy offered a thin smile in response, but it didn’t reach his eyes.  “I’m quite alright, thank you, Professor.”
A middle aged man made his way to the stand.  Harry recognised him as the Head of MLE, he had been in charge of the Death Eaters' arrests and subsequent imprisonment.
“As long as it can be done discreetly, I don’t see why they shouldn’t come in for a few minutes.”  Snape allowed.
Kingsley looked around the courtroom as if for some sort of escape, then swallowed nervously.  "Yes, I believe it does."
The door opened, and Malfoy stepped through floating a platter of sandwiches ahead of him.  “What are you talking about?”  He enquired.
“I don’t know, Gin- I mean, I’ve been noticing him watching Harry and stuff, and earlier- after they...you know- he seemed really genuine-”
Draco sat down primly at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, Pansy trailing behind him. She never did get over him, the damned plonker. She was really getting on his nerves lately, with all her
There was a loud splitting sound from below, and in a blur of brown and green, the ground between them tore, roots spiralling up through the crevice in uncontrollable spires, immediately wrapping around Malfoy’s wrists and ankles, pulling him down with immeasurable force.
Harry barely had any time to register what was happening before Malfoy’s chapped lips were on his own. It was a very passionate kiss, and, though it was their third, it felt the most real. Harry felt his heart beating at a most unhealthy rate, and, when they broke away from each other, found himself longing for more.
Not to mention his gayness, which he’d realized was a thing when he’d seen a very muscular shirtless man on the cover of a muggle magazine. How would they take that? Not well, he assumed. His parents had always pushed him to create an
"Well I spoke with Professor Malfoy." Harrys head shot right up at the name, just like does anytime someone mentions Draco. Lily continued.
The thought of the Weasley home made him think of all the time him and Harry went to stay there. Himself, Harry and the Weasley's playing quidditch in the large garden. Harry and him snuggling on he sofa at Christmas at the Weasley's, both finally happy after the war.
"Now students, the new first years will be arriving shortly so please be silent." She sat down and, not long after, the door to the great hall opened. Students filled the long row between the long house tables with Neville Longbottom leading them down the hall and then sitting down next to Harry. They greated each other then quickly put their attention back to the Head mistress.
"Anyway, what about you. I cant be the only one with a sob story." Draco started laughing at the shear bluntness of the girl. It was almost like talking to an adult. He thought about his life for a second and knew the thing that made him even more sad than his school years.
"You know how hard it was for me as well, I thought we could get through out together, but you up and left. You cold have talked to me, not hide away and close your self off."
After the discussion with McGonagall, Harry headed towards the great hall to sit ready for the feast to begin. He entered noticing that most of the student were sat down apart, from all the first years that would be sorted in a short while. He looked over to the staff table where he spotted all the teachers sitting down, some chatting, some watching over the students.
It was the last few minutes of Draco's lesson. He was teaching first year Gryffindor and Hufflepuff students. Draco was delighted to be teaching the young Gryffindor girl, Lily, who had be sent to deliver Draco his work when her first arrived at Hogwarts. She was a delightful girl with so much energy.
After the sorting hat ceremony was complete she made the annual speech about how the Forbidden Forest is forbidden (hence the name) and other school rules etc. After she dismissed everyone by letting each year go one by one. Harry and the other Heads of Houses were told to go meet their students at their common rooms. Harry headed for the Gryffindor common rooms while Draco went the complete opposite direction towards the dungeons. Both nervous for their next encounter.
The letter hit Draco really hard. He wanted to crawl into a ball and cry his eyes out. But he knew he had to be strong for Harry.
Lily pauses for a second. "Remember what I said Professor. You both could do with a little happiness. Talk to him." She smiled and began walking away.
Harry was surprised Draco didn't notice him before he got this close. The lighting from the door had crept in when he had opened the door and the great hinged creeped loudly.
"We've had a decrease of people willing and qualified to teach at Hogwarts over the years and when you were suggested by Professor Longbottom for the Defence Against The Dark Arts position and idea popped in my head of searching for other old students of mine to teach. That's when I spoke to Mr Malfoy about the Potions Professor opening, he was reluctant to take the offer but after careful consideration he accepted, to my relief." McGonagall explained.
Harrys became fearful of what draco meant. He knew Draco's life was hard because of what happened, but he though it was getting better.
Lily walked back towards the way they came and Harry stood watching the girl walk away. After a few seconds he turned away and continued towards his new destination.
He always had a skill for potions and when he left Hogwarts after the added 8th year where some students decide to return to complete their NEWTS. He became a potions master and got a job supplying potions (to hospitals ext.) and also experiment with new ones, just how he'd always dreamed he would. He did this for a few years until he got job offer from America with an even better job.  After the war there was a lot of shame being a Malfoy and America was a fresh start where people didn't know him and where he could be himself. He felt suffocated being constantly looked t in hate and ridiculed for his mistakes.
Professor La Rouge, who teaches Flying and Muggle studies, flued from her home in France.  And finally, Professors Flitwick, Vector and Babbling all Apperated into Hogsmead.
"YOU LEFT ME, DRACO." Harry had finally broken down after holding in for so long. His knees growing weaker and threatening to collapse from out under him.
That hit her deep in her heart. Seeing Harry like this brought out her paternal instincts in her. She stood and hugged Harry tightly.
"Yes, just give me a moment." Draco put down the cloths he had folded in his hands and walked towards the door. The door opened to reveal a young student with folders and parchment in her hands. She looked up at him and smiled.
Some of the teachers weren't on the train because some used the flu network or some stay at Hogwarts. Hagrid, of course, lives at Hogwarts just like Professor Trelawney. Also Professor Binns, because he a ghost. (Duh). Draco, Harry, Professor Muchham and Neville Longbottom all used the Hogwarts Express.
"This is your home Harry. I wont be the reason you have to give that up." Draco had gotten all his stuff and began walking out the bedroom.
Giving upon his appearance, Harry continued on his path towards the Potions classroom witch was connected to Draco's office. As he reached the door he contemplated whether to knock or simply walk in. He opted for just walking in. Not knowing if Draco was actually in his classroom or office.
Lily pushed of the desk and began walking backward slowly, "If it makes you feel any better, I think you've improved immensely Professor."
Lily huffed out a breath, "You see professor, my brother was older than me, he was an Auror. I loved him so much. There was a raid or something in this old house. Four went in...only two came out. Both not my brother. His body was dragged out later on. They say their informant was misinformed and they underestimated the amount of people in the house. That's why I missed our last lesson. The funeral was yesterday."
The room was just as he remembered it. Rows of large tables covered in various flask, metal contraptions and a few scattered cauldrons. Cabinets lined up against the cracked stone walls.
It was lite only by the moonlight shining through the high windows. Lamps were scattered around producing daunting shadows across the large room. He looked toward the desk and saw him, and begun slowly stepping closer and closer. Draco was hunched over, quill in hand scribbling away on parchment. He looked content.
The rest of the train ride was full of small talk and then silence while they either read or prepare work for their classes. Draco couldn't stop thinking about Harry and if he should go and find him but he couldn't gather up the courage to go, knowing what he would have to face if he talked to Harry. So he spent the journey attempting to read while actual moping about Harry.
Seeing him again brought unwanted memories back. Memories of the times we had together, the love that was born from those years ago. I shook my head trying to not think of that. Although, he looked like the same Harry as always, he had grown a little stubble which only made him more attractive. His muggle trench coat covering his white button up shirt and dress pants.
He seemed to recognise her and replied with a smile, "Lily, right? I remember your excellent use of expeliarmus in DADA. You have very good potential."
When she mentioned Draco his head popped up then he sighed. "That was actually one of the reasons I nearly said no."
"Head mistress Mcgonagall, sent for me to give you these. She said they were the lesson curriculum for this year and information about your new duty's as the Head of Slytherin. Also, there's a note from her. Will that be all or would you like me to wait for a response, Professor?"  She looked so young, with her dirty blonde pig tails and her bright pink hair bands. She seemed extremely proud of her delivery and Draco couldn't help but smile at her.
"No, that will be all. What's your name?"  Draco asked as the girl passed him the parchment and folder.
"Harry, my dear," She stood up out of her chair and embraced harry tightly. She pulled back from harry and looked at the older boy. She remembered his Hogwarts years and his innocence before all the even worse things happened to the poor boy. She saw memories in her mind of the boy growing and ageing with a darkness about him. It was like over the years his hope and positive nature was drained out of him. However, as she looked at Harry she could see the 11 year old boy she once taught. It filled her heart with love that after all these years and after all the loss he had suffered he was able to get his spark back.
Harry was walking along the dark corridors of Hogwarts, lite by only the moonlight and candles burning along the walls, with a fast pace. He was going straight to Draco.
As Draco put away all his belongings in his new room at Hogwarts, a knock came from the oak wood door that hung a painting of snake in a apple tree.
He wore simple muggle cloths, jeans and a blue t-shirt which complimented his eyes. I almost forgot how he can look so casual and effortless but so hot at the same time. He had a navy duffel bag strapped to his back and a leather jacket slung over his arm.
"Mr Malfoy? I understand you had a rocked relationship during school and with the war." She questioned. Harry was reluctant to explain further but went one anyway, "Draco and I were actually together a few years ago."
She wanted everyone to have love like her parents. So she hoped with her help they could makeup with each other. Walking up to the professor with a confident stride, she said hi hopping he would remember her from DADA and him being her Head of House.
Not saying much, Harry walked into the living room, threw the letter into the fireplace and lit the logs ablaze.
"Harry I-I.." His apology was cut short by Harry fleeing from the room. After a few seconds Draco composed himself and began to run after Harry and into the spitting sky.
So now he's walking into the large compartment already containing two of the Hogwarts professors. He was introduced to the new transfigurations teacher, Professor Muchham. She reminded him of Professor Mcgonagall with the way she speaks and the way she presents her self.  There was also Neville Longbottom who was the herbology professor and had been since Professor Sprout retired 3 years. He greeted him nervous smile and a hand shake. He waited for Harry to show but he never did. Draco then got out his copy of Shakespeare's Othello and read.
Him and Harry at Ron and Hermione's wedding. Holding each other close as they slow dance to the soft calm music, wishing it could never end.
It had been a week since the start of school and Draco had finally gotten into the flow of teaching and being head of Slytherin.
"Sir, there's a student here to give you something. Shall I open the door for you?" The snake hissed.
She finished and let a few tears fall out of her red eyes. Draco felt so many emotions for the girl. Why do so many bad thing happen to good people.
Oh, she nodded her head to show her understanding. "If you don't mind me asking, you said we're together. What happened?" Harry clearly was in his head thinking deeply about his answer. After he let out a deep breath he replied.
"Lily, could I speak with you for a minute." She looked up with a weary smile. Lily had waved her friend good bye and walked to Draco and proceeded to lean on the dest next to her professor.
"Maybe you could try and fix it. At least you have the chance to make amends. I think you both could do with a bit of happiness. When ever I see him he seems just as lost as you."
We both, slowly, begin to walk towards each other until we both hear the whistle of the train and stopped. A sad timid smile passed between us, then I watched as he walked away towards the train.
"Your probably right." He said, which surprised himself.  He looked at the girl and wondered why she was giving a teacher love advice.
His older more matured face staring back at me. He looked unjustifiably attractive, with scars perturbing out of his short sleeved t-shirt which, although brought up bad memories of Dark Lords and one horrific bath room incident, just added to the appeal of Draco Malfoy.
"You don't seem like your usual self, Lily. Is there something a matter, if you don't mind me asking." She seemed reluctant to speak but she spoke anyway.
He got on the train, a sense of de ja vu hit him. It reminded him of his first year at Hogwarts, getting on the train, a whole world yet to be learned. He knew he wouldn't be able to sit in the teachers compartment so he opted for a normal compartment, reminding him of when they saw Remus Lupin on the train in third year. He really did miss Remus. He also missed Sirius. Nothing felt right without his Godfather and Remus. They were everything to him, his chance to get to know his parents through them. But sadly, they were taken away from him before he could really get to know them, especially Sirius. The longing to of had more time with Sirius was never ending. But when your Harry Potter , he thought, you just have to live with the fact that most of the people you love die.
A smile appeared on Harry's face as he looked at the old headmaster. Then his eyes locked onto his old transfigurations professor.
He caused so much pain and sadness when he was at Hogwarts. He bullied and tormented others to make him feel better because of his pain. Now, he wanted to repent for his sins. Hopefully, he thought, being at Hogwarts he could help other students with their pain just like he wished someone could have for him.
He had been wanting to talk to Harry but every time he saw him Harry had turned around and walked in the other direction.
"I understand you left on bad terms but he seems to miss you and regret what he did. He didn't say much but from what I gathered I think you both could do with talking, in my opinion. I also understand that I am a student and have no right telling you what to do and getting in your personal lives.
Draco looked at the girl, "You are very mature for you age, when I was in first year I was a self-centred nob."
"You confuse and also intrigue me Lily. When in was a student, especially in first year, I would of been petrified at talking to a teacher with such honesty and concern for there well being. Why are you different."
"I've been having problems at home and we talked about everything, it really helped. He also spoke of you." She paused for a moment. They both stopped walking and Harry looked in her in the eyes.
Harry lunged for Draco and held him tight while sobbing uncontrollably. Draco was surprised at the sudden show of affection from Harry, but slowly eased into the embrace.
"Draco, what's going on. Has something happened." He reached out to make draco stop what he was doing.  Staring into Harry's eyes made him freeze for a second and reconsider what he was about to do. However, everything that's happened flowed into Draco's mind.
"I was also apprehensive as to accept the offer but I missed Hogwarts so much, despite everything that happened."
