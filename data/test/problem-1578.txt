Gailak walked over to Harry and handed him the test looking at the woman, how dare she try and hurt the young lord in his bank. Once Harry showed the stupid woman his inheritance as well as the Will of his mother, she looked ready to have a heart attack. “You’re a Creature!!! You’re not even fully human how can they let you into Hogwarts!!! This is outrageous!! I don’t believe you!! If this was true, then you wouldn’t be attending the school.” The woman shrieked looking around seeing that even her family was looking ashamed of her performance. Just as she was say all of this Harry’s magic lashed out letting everyone see his true form, Ears, eyes and his long Hair. “I am the king of the light and dark elves you pathetic woman and I will not allow you speak such treachery about my people, or any others is that understood? You will stop this outrageous outburst and either go about your business with the bank or leave I am done speaking and you will leave me and my family alone.” Harry yelled with such authority that the woman’s family bowed their heads in shame, changing back into his human form and walking back to his family while he waited for Gailak to take him to his vault. “This way my young lord, lets get you the money you need for your school things, so you don’t have to be in Diagon Alley any longer than you need to.” Gailak said looking back at the family who just got their goblin to take them to their own vault.
Harry's hand touched her skin and their magic glowed around them as they were bonded instantly. “Whoa, what just happened?” Harry said looking at Amethyst “Young Master we were meant to be! I have found my soul Familiar! It means I am the only Familiar that will be able to bond completely with you.” Amethyst said sounded proud that she found her one true master “This is amazing I can’t wait to take back with me.” Harry said picking up Amethyst and walked toward his father. “I found who I want.” Harry said looking up at his father who looked so proud. “Harry you’ve bonded to your true familiar I’m so proud of you.” Tom said having heard the conversation. After a couple of minutes Draco came back with a black kitten with bright green eyes “Her name is Jade, the owner said that most customers take one look at her and say her eyes are to creepy.” Draco said looking at Jade like everyone was crazy to think such a thing about a kitten. “I think she is beautiful Drayk, I love her eyes they definitely named this beauty correctly.” Harry said as they both walked up to the counter and paid for their Familiars as well as their beds, food and Jade’s collar. Amethyst wrapped herself around Harry’s arm and laid her head on his shoulder as they walked into Olivanders. “AHHH! What are you doing with that ugly thing?” again the Woman just couldn’t leave them alone “She is my Familiar and if you or any of your family so much as touch her I will have you arrested for harming her.” Harry said seeing the woman raising her wand, “Now if your Children are done getting their wands, I would like to get mine so I can get out of here and go home.” He said looking at her with a glare that would freeze time. “Yes, we are done anything to get away from that THING!” She shrieked looking at the snake like it would strike at any second backing her kids towards the door before bolting. “Finally, Now let me help you get your wands gentlemen.” Olivander said looking thankful that woman was out of his hair. It took only 10 minutes for them to find their perfect wands, Draco’s was a 11 and a quarter inch Hawthorn and Dragon Heartstring and Harry’s was of course the brother to his fathers wand 13 inch Holly and Phoenix Feather, after paying for their wands they left the shop and went back into the Leaky Cauldron and apparated back home.

“Oh, thank merlin… I kept praying to either die or get saved. I’m glad it’s the other option.” Harry said, smiling for the first time in what seems like his whole life. Yawning, he laid back down and was out like a light again.
Harry was not the average boy of six, most would say that he was able to understand what was going on around him from the time he was born. Harry was a wizard and yes, he knew, his relatives secret but Harry had no power over them for some reason his gift would not work. Harry was punished for the tiniest of things and if he so much as looked a certain way he was punished.

“Severus, who is this little child? When you said you found him, I thought you meant Harry.” Cissa said, looking over at the child, who was no bigger than a three-year-old.
They all gathered into the ritual room waiting for the other goblins to get inside. Harry was getting more nervous he didn’t understand why his parents wanted this to happen but knew it must be a good reason. “Mister Potter we will start with your inheritance test then we will do the purge that one takes a little bit longer.” Gailak said seeing that Harry was nervous and wanting to put his at ease, “nothing to worry about young lord these tests don’t hurt you, though with the purge you might find it to be uncomfortable its not harmful.” Gailak assured him with a smile, as he grabbed a piece of parchment that would be used for the inheritance test. “I need three drops of your blood on this parchment Mister Potter, and we will see what your parents thought to be important.” Gailak knew the answer but was forbidden to say anything until the test was complete. Harry pricked his finger and let the blood drop onto the parchment.
“Cissa, we found him, but he needs your help bad,” Severus said, looking panicked and out of breath. Cissa acted and got a bed ready to take care of her patient.

“You think I care what you want, I am going to have my fill of you, and you are going to comply other wise it will be 100 times worse.” Vernon said with a knowing look suggesting that he knew I wanted to die.
Cissa grabbed the parchment after it was done. What she saw caused her stomach to roll. “Severus, please tell me they suffered,” Cissa said; on the verge of tears, she handed him Harry’s medical report.

Harry and Draco walked to his fathers chambers, just as his dad was returning from the Great Hall as well. “Harry, are you okay son?” Severus asked looking concerned for his child. “I’m fine, but can Drayk and I get a quick bite to eat in here? I really don’t want to go back into the lions den.” Harry said with a sign as he slumped down on to the sofa. “Of course, Dobby? Please get Harry and Draco their favorite breakfast please.” Severus said as the young house elf popped in to the chambers. “Oh yes master Severus anything for Harry and young master Draco.” Dobby squeaked as he popped away.
Smiling, Cissa chuckled, “He wore himself out with that little attack; Sev, he will be just fine.” She said, walking back over to her desk to finish the report.
“That will be the end of that, you two have two weeks detention for your lack of respect.” Professor McGonagall said jumping off the desk. “I will have you know Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger the Headmaster is still very much gay and Miss. Granger being gay is accepted in our world. Maybe not in the Muggle world but in the Wizarding, world being gay is okay.” McGonagall said looking very angry at her lions. “Professor, what right does Draco have in taking Harry way from the option of having a wife and child.” Hermione whined looking at Harry with hunger. “Because Draco didn’t take my rights away. If anything, I took his away when my magic bonded us at Nine years old.” Harry said glaring at Hermione then at Draco with a sad look. “Not that it’s any of your business, who I am with or not nor is it the Ministry or the Headmasters.” Harry said looking back to the two lions behind him with his purple eyes showing again.
“Mom and Dad, I didn’t expect you guys to be here until this weekend.” Draco said going over to his mom and giving her a hug. “We thought with everything that is about to happen today, we should probably show up sooner rather than later.” Lucius said smiling at his son, then smirking at his god-son “Nice hair there Harry the braid is very nice.” Lucius winked. “Draco helped me do it, I get tired of just putting it in a basic ponytail. That and it also gave him the excuse to play with my hair.” Harry said smiling over at Draco who blushed a little, as he sat down at the table. “So, what did you guys come up with to help with the situation we are dealing with?” Draco said trying to get off the topic of his obsession with Harry’s hair. “On the day of the purge, Lady Hogwarts gave me a very ancient ward that prevents anyone putting tracking spells, port-keys and really bad curses on anyone, not even Dumbledore knows about it.” Severus said looking at his son who had a very shocked look on his face. “Why didn’t I think of that sooner, but wouldn’t that give away our hand?” Harry asked his dad knowing that was what they were trying to avoid. “No, not if you play as if its all part of the blessing Lady Magic gave you when you two bonded.” Severus said smiling at his son who then laughed. “How very Slytherin of you Dad, that would work perfectly with what mom told me I could do to make it so they couldn’t harm anyone anymore.” Harry said seeing the confusion around the room except for Draco’s. “What do you mean Harry, what did Lilly suggest?” Tom asked feeling hope about todays events for the first time. “After Dumbledore tries to kidnap Draco, and if fails I will invoke my right to a fair judgement.” Harry said letting his words sink in knowing the adults in the room would understand at once. “Your mother is still one of the most brilliant witches, I ever got the pleasure of knowing.” Tom said smiling brightly at what Lilly had suggested to Harry. “I agree, that is a brilliant idea and it would work to she would be fair with the punishment for all parties involved.” Severus said also smiling at the fact that his best friend is still helping them even if its from the mind of his son. After all the plans were set, Severus sat next to Draco and started the warding spell which luckily with Lady Hogwarts help it wasn’t to be taxing on Severus’s magic. “You are now the most protected eleven-year old’s in all of the UK.” Severus said smiling at Harry’s shocked look. “Did I forget to mention that if I placed the ward one of a true bonded pair that both of them were protected by that ward?” Severus said smiling knowing he did it on purpose wanting to see the look on Harry’s face. “Lady Hogwarts, also said that if one of us had a port-key placed on us without our consent that it would just transport us to each other is that correct?” Harry asked making sure he had all the plans correct before Draco and he went down to the Great Hall. “Yes, you are correct. Now just to let the events unfold they way they need to unfold.” Tom said looking nervous now for his son, walking over to him and giving him a hug.
Having no other choice Harry got undressed and onto the bed, he prayed he would die today or that someone would save him.
Chapter 4: Wills, Purge, Inheritance
They barley got into the Hall before Draco was pushed out of the way by someone red and brown. “Out of the way Malfoy, Harry is our friend he doesn’t need disgusting Death Eaters like you around him.” Ron Weasley loudly said the other students in the Great Hall turned towards the commotion. Before Ron could grab Harry’s arm he was being pinned to the wall. “I warned you once Weasley, do not touch me or my family. I also told you we are not friends, nor will I ever be friends with someone who believes they can push people around to get what they want.” Harry said glaring at Ron who looked scared seeing Harry’s purple eyes.
It took no time at all to get to the bank and sent to a waiting room for the goblin in charge of the Potter accounts. “Ah, Mister Potter how good to see you again.” Gailak said as he walked in and took his seat a crossed from the young lord, he was pleased to see Harry again he would have to summon Griphook before the young lord left today. “Hello Master Gailak, I wish to full fill my parents wish and get an inheritance test done as well as a purge on myself and everyone in the room.” The young lord said looking nervous but determined, while they had been waiting Sirius and Remus joined them after Siri got new clothes and a shower. “That has been arranged and the ritual room is being set up as we speak, it will only be another few minutes I will come get you when it is time.” Gailak said as he walked to the door to make sure everything was in order. Mean while Sirius was in tears about see Harry again and how much he had grown. “Harry you have gotten so big, well not as big as you should be but bigger than you were.” Sirius said between sobs angry that he had missed all of this for his time in Azkaban. “Siri its going to be ok now, you are here and that’s all the matters.” Harry said as he walked over to Sirius and hugged him and smiled. “Mister Potter they are ready for you, if you will follow me.” Gailak came back into the room happy that Harry had his family back.

“Harry, can you hear me?” Cissa asked, staying calm as not to frighten him.
After the dream both man and child hurried to get everything packed, then met everyone at the entrance to the hotel getting into a van that would take them back to their plane. “What took you guys so long.” Tom asked looking concerned at how pale Severus looked he also looked to be in shock. “It’s okay TomTom, Severus just found out the ritual my mom planned to do worked after he found me in a nightmare because of the goat. I was able to finally get rid of him by going into my mindscape and that’s where we saw mum and dad.” Harry laughed at the looks he was getting all of them shocked that Lily pulled it off, then seeing the look in Harry’s eyes all they could do was smile. They all left the hotel and headed to the plane, but everyone was in a better mood knowing that Harry could speak with his parents whenever he needed them.

“Tom? Severus? What are you doing here?” Lucius asked seeing the nervousness radiating off Severus as he sat down at the table. “What has that old goat done now? I asked around the Ministry he hasn’t been complaining or asking Fudge about anything, so if he is planning something, they don’t know anything about it.” Lucius said looking a little put out by the glances that Severus kept giving Tom. “Harry had to put a eavesdropping charm on the two lions that have been giving him trouble today, after they tried to put the imperious curse on him. While listening to the conversation Dumbledore spoke to them and got a plan for tomorrow before Harry and Draco go to the Great Hall.” Tom said pausing to let Lucius absorb all the information. “What kind of plan?” Lucius said fearing that he was not going to like this at all. “Dumbledore is going to try and kidnap Draco in order to get Harry to do what he wants.” Tom said waiting for the outburst, but so far it didn’t happen. “Wait you said try? What are you doing to prevent that from happening?” Lucius asked when he saw Severus relax a little, which meant he had been waiting for an outburst. “I have away that would make it to where Dumbledore couldn’t use any kind of port-key on Harry or Draco.” Severus said smiling and thanking Lady Hogwarts for her gift on the day of the purge. “What are you talking about?” Tom asked looking confused on what his husband was saying. “On the day of the purge while I was in sleep state, Lady Hogwarts spoke to me and gifted me a very ancient ward that not even Dumbledore knows about. It will prevent anyone from putting a port-key, tracking spell, or any kind of harmful curse on the boys inside or outside of Hogwarts.” Severus said kinda wishing he had thought to use it from the very beginning of the year. “That’s amazing, but I feel like there is a catch to the ward.” Lucius said also getting a nod from Tom that he was thinking the same thing. “It means that the only way for the boys to use any kind of transportation like that they would have to be willing to use it. I also know that it must be performed every few years to keep the ward strong and if I place it on a bonded pair then I only must place it on Draco and Harry is protected as well. The catch is that if someone places a port-key on either of the boys it would automatically transport them to each other so if Harry is in the middle of one of his trainings with you things could be a little distracting, same for Draco with his training.” Severus said look from Tom to Lucius wondering what they were thinking. “I would rather the boys get distracted in training, then one or both of them get kidnapped.” Tom said as Lucius nodded in agreement and know how good Severus was with wards, he knew his son and god-son were protected.
Not waiting for a response, the Minister tapped the next parchment and Lilies voice started to speak. “I Lily Rose Evans Potter do declare of being in a sound mind state this is my last will and testament witnessed by my husband James Charles Potter and our friend Sirius Orion Black if you survive me James please take care of Harry and don’t get him into trouble that means you to Sirius. I leave everything to my husband should he survive expect the few gifts for our friends.

Harry was nervous to go, he knew his family would be there but it wasn’t going to be as easy as just going to school when it came to Albus Dumbledore. “Harry you don’t have to go on the train, you can just come with us to the school.” His dad said Harry hadn’t been away from Tom and him long since the day they found him, to say he was nervous for his son would be putting it lightly. “I can’t leave Drayk to go alone besides its part of the experience.” Harry said smiling at his dad knowing his fathers love him a lot to have become teachers. They all got their trunks and headed towards kings cross station, the potter-Snape and Malfoy family helped their kids put everything away saying goodbye they got on the train.
Acknowledgments: Thank You all for your comments I really appreciate your patients with me, this chapter took longer to get done than I would have liked but here it is hope you all enjoy…
A couple of days later, it was time for the reading of the wills but Harry made it known that Dumbledore was not to be there or he would have the wills read with the goblins, Harry told the Minister this was his one and only chance to show that he could be trusted. Everyone put on their best clothes and robes to enter the Ministry, Harry was nervous because this would be the first time the wizarding world would see him. “Alright, everyone are we ready to go and watch the Minister make a fool of himself?” Lucius said knowing some how Dumbledore would show up saying the wills couldn’t be read with out his legal guardians present, little did Albus know was that Tom and Severus got granted that by Magical Child Services three weeks ago. “Sev, make sure you have the documents stating you are now Harry's guardianship over Harry.” Lucius said but got a look like he was dumb from Severus like he would forget such an important document. They all gathered around and decided to use a portkey rather than the floo network the grabbed onto the book and were teleported into the Ministry. They all started walking towards the court room 12 when who shows his face? None other than the old goat himself, looking smug that he would get his way finally. They all ignored him and walked into the court room, before they could even speak guards were on either side grabbing everyone trying to pull them away from Harry. “THAT IS IT! MINISTER I GAVE YOU A CHANCE! UNHAND MY GUARDIANS THIS INSTANT OR YOU WILL FIND JUST HOW MUCH POWER I HAVE OF THE PEOPLE.” Harry projected his voice which stopped the guards at once looking at the Minister wondering what happened, Harry was glaring at everyone in the room as it started to get cold. “Harry, they aren’t your guardians I am I have the documents to prove it.” Dumbledore said with a smile the brat was his but as soon as he brought the documents out had they been true nothing could destroy them, and Harry snapped his fingers and the documents burst into flames and ash. “I suggest, you old goat think twice before you speak again, or don’t you remember what ashes feel like.” Harry said with such malice that the whole room shivered, how could a seven-year-old have such control and power, looking around he grabbed his family and walked up to the stands of the court room. “I Harry James Potter hold here the true documents of my guardianship in my had, and I demand my parents wills are read I have a rather busy day and don’t want to be in this room longer than I have to.” Harry said glaring at the Minister who swallowed and looked like he was sweating nodding they brought the wills out and started the process.
It took 4 hours to get everything done, longer because Harry’s features changed and ended up causing some pain due to the ears. After everyone one was done with the shock they just got to their body’s and minds they went back into the waiting room to speak with Gailak about making sure all assets were secure. “Mister Riddle Snape, would it be alright if I brought my son into see you?” Gailak finally asked once things had calmed down, hoping Harry would remember Griphook. “Of course, Gailak, I have missed Griphook dearly and wish to apologies for my disappearance.” Harry said with a sad smile on his face, “you do not need to do such a thing, it was not your fault for leaving.” Gailak said as he called his son into the room. “Harry! Oh, it is so good to see you again my friend it has been to long.” Griphook smiled at him happy to see the young lord looking like he should. “It is wonderful to see you Grippy, I have missed you dearly.” Harry said smiling brightly as the goblin sat down looking like he just won a vault full of Galleons. “Now Mister Riddle Snape we have investigated all your assets and vaults everything seems to be fine except for the Potter vaults, someone claiming to be your magical guardian have been withdrawing money from the main Lord vault. I have investigated who it was and Albus Dumbledore as taken a total of 1.5 million Galleons out of the vault.” Gailak said with much distaste “We will be getting the money back in your vault and Gringotts will be suing Dumbledore for fraud.” He said hating that the goblins had been tricked but would do everything to fix this issue. “Thank you Gailak for all your help, Grippy you and I will have to get together and make up for lost time.” Harry said getting everyone ready to leave, it had been a long day and they all needed to rest. “You are much welcome young lord, we will let you know if anything come up in the rest of the investigation, now why don’t you get your family home it looks like you all are ready to drop.” Gailak said as he waved the young lord and his family off one by one the disappeared into the flames.
After having a full breakfast Harry and Draco looked at what they had for classes that day. “Well this should be fun, Double Transfiguration, Defense, Potions and History of Magic everything with the Lions except for History of Magic.” Harry said Sarcastically looking annoyed still with everything that happened. “Yes, but at least its’s with teachers we liked minus Professor Binns.” Draco said trying to lighten the mood. “Just as long as they stay away from me, I will be fine.” Harry said but didn’t sound convinced it would happen.

“What Have you done now BOY!? You think you can make all this noise and us not think it was you?” Vernon asked while he grabbed Harry out of is safe place and dragged him upstairs.
“THAT BASTERED! How dare he think that; he can do this to our family.” Tom yelled looking like his old self when he got mad. “Harry, I understand why you are mad, but to use the bit of leverage we have won’t help. We need something that will truly end this without giving our whole hand away.” Severus said going over to his husband to try and calm him down. “I know dad but what can we do? I am so tired of acting like this is just some big annoyance, I just want to go to school and be a kid. Why does everyone have to make a big deal out of me living through the bloody killing cures.” Harry said shrinking further into Draco and looking like he just wanted everything to just be over. “Uncle Sevvy, I think it’s a bad one this time.” Draco said as he saw Harry shrink more and more into himself trying to become smaller than he was. “Harry, go into your mind scape, speak with Lil’s, let your mind rest as well as your body. We will figure out what to do in the morning before breakfast okay.” Severus said looking at his son knowing that talking with Lily would help Harry’s mind rest, she wouldn’t let him out until she felt that he was well enough.
“Harry, are you okay? I felt your energy all the way in my class.” Tom said coming into the quarters after setting things up for class in the morning. “Yes, I would like to know what caused this to happen as well” Severus said though he had a feeling he already knew see as it hadn’t been long since the meeting with the old goat.
“Yes, Harry, it really happened; you no longer have to worry about your aunt or uncle. Your cousin is in the hospital getting the help he needs but has no memory of you or his parents.” Severus explained, praying that Harry was going to be alright.
“Harry my boy, I sure this is just a misunderstanding. I don’t believe Mr. Weasley meant any harm.” Said the old goat as he walked down from the head table. “Oh, he meant it headmaster and I advise that he stay away from me, I might not be so nice next time.” Harry said still glaring as he dropped Ron on the floor and walked over to Draco. “Come on Drayk lets go eat I see that Professor Snape is handing out schedules.” Harry smiled holding out his hand to Draco. As they started to walk hand in hand a voice was heard. “That is wrong Harry, being gay is gross and you’ll never be accepted in our world.” Said the big toothed girl from the train. Turning around looking pissed and ready to kill Harry said, “Miss. Granger before you open your mouth, I would advise you to look up Wizarding laws, they are quite different than the Muggle world.” Not bothering for an answer, they left for their table got their schedules and left the Great Hall.
“Sevvy? What’s going on? Am I in trouble?” Harry asked, finally feeling a bit calmer with someone he knew in the room.
“NOO! Beat me, stab me but anything but that, you’ll have to kill me first.” Harry yelled and glared at his Uncle who got red in the face.
Inheritance test of one Harry James Potter:
Harry and Tom both passed out from crying, both just laid in the bed. Severus was on cloud nine Harry remembered them, all anyone could do was watch as they slept both looked at peace. Severus and Cissa left them to rest while they got things ready for Harry’s new room, well Cissa got Harry’s room ready Severus finished the potions they would need for the next six months. The next couple of hours we peaceful, Tom had woken up for the need to use the loo was extreme as he was only gone a couple of minutes, he heard the screaming. “NO UNCLE, PLEASE DON’T IT HURTS I PROMISE TO BE GOOD DON’T STICK IT IN THERE PLEASE. I’LL BE GOOD, I WON’T BURN THE FOOD AGAIN PLEASE STOP.” Harry screamed Tom rushed into the room and saw bottles and medical supplies flying around the room he did his best not to get hit as he tried to get to Harry. When he got to the bed Tom grabbed Harry’s hand “Harry its ok, your safe he can’t hurt you anymore I promise you are safe Harry please wake up.” Tom said in hysterics but saw that Harry was slowing waking up, then bright emerald eyes looked up at him and Harry started to sob “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt you please don’t leave me I am such a freak, but I will behave I promise.” Harry said heavily breathing that’s what Severus heard as he ran in with Cissa and both of their hearts broke for the child. “Harry I won’t ever leave you not again, and you are not a freak you are loved and wanted you are special and beautiful. Nothing those people said to you is true, you are not I repeat not a freak.” Tom said through sobs as his heart broke for the boy he held. Harry started to calm down with those words and just held Tom feeling comfort once again he closed his eyes told him self “They are dead, they are dead, they can’t hurt me anymore.” He repeated this in his head as he looked up at Tom “Thank you, I am sorry for breaking anything I will help clean them up.” Harry started to move but Cissa said no that what happened was all part of the healing process and that it was her fault for not giving him the potion to block out bad dreams.

Shocked at what just happened the Minister knew that vow was unbreakable, and he couldn’t afford Harry’s godfather dying if Harry was found he was sure to lose any respect from the public. “Now Severus you can’t be serious what if Harry is dead then we have lost all hope of defeating Voldemort.” Albus said though he wasn’t worried if Harry died, he could take over with ease. Just as that thought crossed his mind him and the minister were flown into the wall and held there, not know what was going on until a door to right in front of them opened did they understand the ramifications of what was said. Harry stood in the door looking anything but calm his magic was swirling around him like mad and his eyes went from Emerald Green to a solid Purple. “YOU WILL NOT GET ANYTHING FROM ME!! I WILL NOT HELP YOU, I WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE, AND THAT IS WHAT YOU WILL DO! YOU LEFT ME WITH AN ABUSIVE AUNT AND An UNCLE YOU SEXUALLY DID THINGS TO ME THAT MY INNOCENCE IS GONE! WHO EVER KILLED THEM I WOULD SHAKE THEIR HAND BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THEY DESERVED. MY COUSIN IS KNOWN OF YOUR CONCERN HE IS SAFE AND I WILL KEEP IT THAT WHY IF I WERE YOU. NOW GET OUT AND DO NOT RETURN, AND I MEAN IT LEAVE ME AND MY FAMILY ALONE ALL OF MY FAMILY.” Harry said as he dropped them back to the ground pointed to the fire which lite and called out Ministry of Magic Ministers Office looking at the men and forced them into the fire. Once they were gone Harry collapsed onto the floor.
This is a long chapter hope you like it
Once Tom was sure the boys were asleep, he looked at Severus and dragged him to the fireplace to call Lucius. “Do you think it wise to do this, Lucius will probably want to drag Dumbledore out of the castle after hearing what was said.” Severus said looking at his husband who seemed to already have his mind made up. “This needs to be done Sev, Draco is Lucius’s son and even though he is in our care while he is here this isn’t a matter with school, this is about his life.” Tom said making it known this is how it had to be. “Well let’s try to be slightly gentle about this, we can’t just beat around the bush, but we also can’t be super blunt.” Severus said looking at Tom who looked a little offended but at the same time amused. “Of course, oh sweet and sensitive husband, I will be gentle for the sake of Draco as well as our ears.” Tom said trying to keep the mood light. Tom tossed floo powder into the fire place and said, “Malfoy Manor, London.” Both Severus and Tom walked into the kitchen of the Manor.
So, it had been decided that they would fly to the United States Harry not liking crowded areas only agreed because Lucius had a private plane. “We will arrive in about 45 minutes the hotel is booked in the Disney World resort and we have all day passes to both sides of the park as well as an all-day pass to Universal.” Lucius said amused that Cissa had gotten them all to agree to take Harry away from their world for a little while. It was a good idea because he could tell that the stress was not only getting to Harry but to Draco as well. Once they arrived to their resort the boys were in awe, at how beautiful a fictional castle could look, the boys could have got whiplash with how fast their heads were turn back and forth trying to see everything. Laughing the family finally got to their suite and got ready for the day, when they left London it was ten in the morning and it took them nine hours to get to Florida but because of the Time difference they arrived at noon on July 31st, 1987. “Uncle Lucy, what can we do first today?” Harry asked practically bouncing from excitement, he really did hate that nickname, but he knew Harry has given everyone one, so he smiled. “What do you want to do it is as they say your day.” Lucius said chuckling when Harry looked shocked but then saddened when he saw shame in Harry’s eyes. “Har, why don’t we go to out to lunch at one of the places we saw, when we came in, I’m sure hungry and the plane ride kind of wore me out a bit.” Draco said grabbing Harry’s hand smiling hoping he got that hurt look out of Harry’s face. “Okay Drayk, we can go eat because I agree the plane ride did ware me out a bit, and I am hungry too.” Harry said smiling brightly to Draco, Harry knew that he was the only one right now who could bring a true smile to his face, something inside of Harry seem to want to be happy with Draco.

“What happened? Where am I? Who are you?” Harry asked, starting to look panicked
A couple of days after the visit that left two boys bonded Cissa and the other thought it was time for the wills of Harry’s parents to be read as well as ask the goblins to do a purge and an inheritance test. “Think we should talk to Harry first about the wills, he agreed to the purge but doesn’t understand why we want to do an inheritance test on him.” Severus Said after talking to Harry last night about what the purge and inheritance do Severus wasn’t sure on why Cissa is wanting the test done but it seems that when she was doing a health screen on Harry something was a little different than things should be. “I am fine with the wills, I just don’t understand the inheritance test so I will make a suggestion if my parents wills state I should have one done I will get one does that work?” Harry said as he walked into the library looking concerned that they would be mad about him eavesdropping. Severus smiled the boy always seemed to have the right answer to the most serious of situations, they agreed to the suggestion and all of them agreed to have the wills read that the Ministry in front of the court a couple of days after Harry’s seventh birthday.

“No Uncle V-Vernon I d-didn’t do it, I d-don’t know what that noise was, I only thought that this wasn’t home this was a prison.” Harry said hoping that little comment would really get him killed then he wouldn’t have to go it himself.
“Your about to regret saying that you old goat. I call upon Lady Magic and invoke my magical right to seek judgement on those who have tried to harm my family and my self, past, present and future. I also ask Lady Hogwarts if she is listening to please lock down the school so the accused can’t escape until punishment has been passed.” Harry said feeling the wave of magic from both ladies. Hogwarts was locked down with in minutes, as Lady Magic just stood there observing each of the accused who all had gone pale. “I am ashamed of you two Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger how could you become so blinded to the evil in your own prejudice hearts. This is not who I gifted magic to you had bright futures ahead of you and you might have just thrown it all away.” The Lady said looking up and down at each of their cores as well as what was truly in their hearts. “I see mostly you have been under spells and potions, but you still have a lot to learn based on what I see in your hearts, so your punishment is this. You Hermione Jean Granger will only be allowed to use your magic during classes nothing more, you are also banned from using the library, you need to learn that books aren’t the answer to everything, so take good notes listen to your teachers and maybe by the end of the year if your heart has changed I will give you full use of your magic again. Your punishment is the same Ronald Bilus Weasley with an added punishment like Hermione’s you are not allowed to harm anyone with your hands or anyone else hands.” Lady Magic said waving her hand and releasing them from the spells, and potions they were on but allowing them to remember what they did and their punishment before putting a timer on their cores.
As soon as Severus got into the Manor, he was yelling for Narcissa for help. Coming out of the library, Cissa asked, “what is all the ruckus for Severus?” that is until she saw a small child in his arms.
The first will to be read will be one of James Charles Potter as he was the first to fall. Everyone sat down as the Minister tapped the paper and it started to read for itself in the voice of James Potter. “I James Charles Potter, do declare of being in of a sound mind that this is my last will and testament, witnessed by my wife Lily Rose Evans Potter and my best friend Sirius Orion Black. Lily if you have survived, I leave you everything to you expect the few gifts to our friends. To Remus Lupin I bequeath to you the vault 585 in it is some extra cash, as well as some books I know you will love, alone with the deed to cabin in Howling shores; its out of the way and unplotted so it’s safe.

Both men nodded in agreement and headed out to do their tasks, giving Cissa time to process everything that happened to her godson. “You poor child, I know you can’t hear me but know this, we never stopped looking for you after they took you from us. You now have your true family back, and we won’t be letting you go again.” Cissa said, brushing Harry’s hair out of his face.
Just as Harry and his friends walked into the Defense class he was stopped again. “It’s quite rude to leave someone who wasn’t done speaking to you Mr. Potter.” Dumbledore said looking slightly angry. “Again Professor, I am sorry but unless my parents are here, I don’t have to say another word to you.” Harry said starting to get angry at the look that the Old Goat was giving him. “My son is right unless myself or Severus are present you won’t be alone with Harry, Albus sorry it’s what we advised Harry to tell you or any teacher.” Tom said coming up behind Dumbledore.
Draco sat back down, but before he could even get comfortable the compartment door opened again. Harry hadn’t time to calm down, when he saw a door of red, why wouldn’t people just leave him alone. “So, it’s true, Harry Potter is on the train.” The redhead said he had to be related to that mad women from Diagon Alley. “What! Could you [possibly want I’ve had enough harassment for one day.” Harry said looking tried and annoyed as he looked at the redhead.

“Oh, this poor boy, I hope those horrible muggles got what they deserve,” Cissa said, looking at Severus for confirmation. “Yes, Tom got rid of them; what does Harry need to be healed first?” Severus asks, watching Cissa wave her wand at Harry getting a diagnostic of his health.
The court room was in a state of shock that not only did Albus know who the really betrayed the Potters, but that the Potters wanted nothing to do with Albus. “Albus? You didn’t? Why would you do such a thing to them?” Minerva McGonagall asked looking as if she was on the verge of tears. “This is all just a misunderstanding, I didn’t know Peter would betray them I really thought he was the best choice rather than Sirius.” Albus stated though he was angry that he couldn’t get the wills stopped from being read. “You are correct in it being a misunderstanding SIR, but from what I heard you knowing who the keeper was yes you still let my godfather be sent to Azkaban without trial for a crime he did not commit” Harry said looking both angry and smug at the same time, “I suggest Minister that you get my godfather out of his holding cell and let him be reunited with his husband and family.” He continued no longer looking at the goat that cause his parents death. “Of course, Mister Potter, I will have him brought here right away. I have to ask what you are going to do now?” The Minister asked hoping that Harry would still help them win the war against the dark lord though he has a feeling its not whom Dumbledore said it was. “I will be on my way to the goblins to do as my parents have wished me to do.” Harry said looking at Dumbledore once again looking smug when he say that the goat was trying to think of away for him to not do so. “Must ask why you have to go to the goblins when you can do all of that here?” Albus asked seeing if he could get Harry to listen to reason that the goblins couldn’t be trusted. “My mother obviously didn’t trust the Ministry and would rather make a deal with the goblins so that is where I am going, besides the Ministry hasn’t proven they can be trusted.” Harry shot back with malice “now if you will excuse me, like I said before I have a very busy day with my family and do not wish to take up anymore of your time.” Harry said then on a side note said, “Send my godfather to Malfoy Manor, Remus is waiting with open arms.” As he walked out of the court room to get to Gringotts and figure out why his parents wanted him to get these tests done.
Harry turned around to look at the person who thought they could cast an unforgivable on him. “I’m a half-elf mind curses don’t work on me, and I do believe I warned both of you to leave me alone.” Harry said finally unleashing his full elf form. “Tell us the truth what have you done to the Harry Potter I read about?” Hermione asked looking slightly frightened at Harry’s appearance. “Maybe, if you stopped believing everything you read you would see what’s right in front of your face.” Harry glared taking a small step towards them. “Why would your mother carry a baby for that ugly bat, she was pretty and brilliant, how did she even know someone like him?” Ron asked sweating as he said those words.

Everyone grabbed their bags for the day, and left their quarters heading towards the Great Hall. Severus and Tom left for the door leading to the Teachers entrance to the Head Table. With one last glance at the boys they nodded and left. “Are you ready for this? You know they are going to push me and do everything they can to get me out of arms reach.” Draco said starting to get a little nervous since they left the safety of their quarters. “Yeah, I will have to let it happen so Dumbledore puts the port-key on you.” Harry said also getting equally nervous about everything that’s about to happen. As they got closer to the Great Hall, Harry squeezed Draco’s hand just as someone pushed him out of the way and into a wall. “How many times do I have to tell you Malfoy, Harry is my best mate, stay away from him you slimy snake.” Ron Weasley said looking smugly at Draco who had hit his head a little on the wall. “I am not your best mate, I don’t know how many times I have to tell you this, and if you every touch my bonded like that again you’ll get much worse than a bump on the head.” Harry said looking at Ron with his purple eyes, as Harry walked over to help Draco up but of course the other Lion was there. “Harry stop pretending to like that sleezy snake, you have to see you are under a spell, no one could ever truly love a git like him.” Hermione said pushing Draco further away from Harry just like the Headmaster had told her. “Now, now children there’s no need to fight I’m sure we can come to an understanding.” Dumbledore said going over to help Draco up off the ground. “What kind of understanding are we talking about Headmaster?” Harry asked doing everything to remain calm knowing this was it and they Draco was going to be fine. “Well for starters, you will start doing what your told or you’ll never see Mr. Malfoy again. Bumblebees!” Dumbledore said as he tried to activate the port-key. Nothing happened Draco was still there except now he was right next to Harry again.
“Remus.”
You have to be at the Astronomy Tower as soon as possible, I’ll find a way to take care of things here.”
See, the cool thing about watching water is that it’s always changing. When he gets there at five in the afternoon the first day, he gets to see the sunset over a calm beach. Water is blue, clear, or green. He’d always known that. But that evening the water was red. Fading into purple, some pink at the very edges. Where the sun disappeared into the sea, it was burning yellow.

“I see that you’re faring well, I assume someone has asked to see you to confirm this later?”
Draco and Theo both glance over to see Misty walk in, carrying Salem like he’s a log instead of a Kneazle.
Draco whirls on him, which is really a bad decision because he looks a little too cute this morning to be intimidating. Harry winces, now is so not the time. “Have you lost your mind?
“Your mother never is going to settle down, is she?” Pansy asks. Blaise just shakes his head.
Sorry this was so late, but also hi how is everyone? hope you're doing well we're moving on to the second task next chapter :)
Why is a kid behind the counter of a wand shop?
Instead a small house elf steps out of the shadows and into the moonlit room.
“Did ya lose it? Be honest.” He says to Draco.
“So, no goodbye, then?” He asks, leaning casually against the doorway and pretending like he didn’t just hear Lupin give Harry the map back.
“-oy! Are you even listening to me?! You come into my house, use

Draco’s shriek as water is unnecessarily dumped on them.
“As for Granger, I was seen when I found her, by a Hufflepuff, you know how annoyingly loyal they all are, if I hadn’t come clean, they would have found a way to blame the attacks on me, which you’ve told me numerous time was not allowed to happen.”
“Darling?” Lucius asks, right around the time the witches by Narcissa’s side seem to clue in.
“Well...this is unusual…” Lupin said.
“And you haven’t?”
And Crabbe and Goyle were at dinner, but they didn’t say a word.
“You is not having to explain yourself, sir. There has been a big change in Master Harry’s life. Kreecher has seen many changes in his time, sir, and when wizards change, they be needing time to adjust. Your schedule has been too busy for that, sir, you is young and you is needing time.”
It’s the worst threat he can think of and from the looks on their faces, it works. Before they can ask questions he turns to Ginny, “How did

“I wasn’t!”
“Misty-”
“Ronald!” Granger warns right as Draco sees something snap in Pansy’s eyes. Her wand is out before any of them can react and poking right into a freckled throat.

he whisper-shouts at the insolent professor rolling his eyes, “
“I would kindly ask that you-”
Harry shucks off his shirt and pants, appreciating how cute it is that Draco still blushes and looks away when his shirt is off.
“Ah, Remus already has him, I just wanted to get the papers so we can get all the paperwork over today.”
Draco seems unsure too, which can’t be good.
”Either way, we need to do something to ensure the students‘ safety.”
meet the end he’s been waiting for. A quick curse to his heart, a stinger to his eye sockets, maybe a quick slitting of his throat.
She waves, Cedric kisses her on the cheek and closes the distance between them and Harry decides then and there that Cedric deserves the title of Hogwarts Champion not only because he’s kind, charming, funny, and smart, but because Cho might murder someone if her boyfriend dies.
“And we are still family, we will always be loyal to you, no matter who you are. Whether you think so or not, we know you are going to be great. And you know how much Slytherins love greatness.”

And then he had to be up at three on Thursday morning for Astrology, and the course began again, this time with
It must be karma or something equally ridiculous, like Potter and his bunch of friends, for example. One second he’s laughing with his friends, and the next something is landing in Goyle’s cauldron and their potion is exploding everywhere.

Harry sets the note aside, hardly believing there’s more than five hundred pages in the tiny book labeled
On the plus side, his little outburst has left the man amused in his grief. “I agree, Hagrid is exceptionally gentle, however your father does not share our views.”
Sirius smiles at him, moving his eyes over to a suspiciously quiet Narcissa fiddling with her tea cup.
“I don’t!” He snaps, picking LuLu up and holding her back from her weird love fest with Potter’s jeans. “LuLu is a Kneazle, and a fine one at that, now if you’ll excuse us, we have important places to be!”
Harry says automatically, then he turns to Draco who is standing way too close for comfort and nods.
Hermione nods, standing up and throwing the necklace over her and Harry.

So yeah, long fucking week, long fucking life, and there’s not a single fucking reason he should be awake at seven in the fucking morning on a
Deciding that doesn’t dignify a response, Draco turns on his heel and marches to the side of the man’s hut, finding the Hippogriff and bowing deeply. He knows Hagrid is watching, but at this point he doesn’t fucking care.
Hermione and Ron are both seconds away from a heart attack, he’s sure, but he waves them on and smiles at Fleur again. At least this time she’s slightly amused and not dead-seat on hitting him.
going to make it? I can’t take it from you, Harry. You need it more and I-”
“You’ve made a friend, I have to say that’s more than I was hoping for, but dear Merlin, Draco, have you been eating at all?”
Care for Magical Creatures was being taught by that awful giant Hagrid this year and why Draco agreed to take the class he still didn’t know, something about it being required. Idly he wonders if he can get Snape to get him out of it, after all, no one seemed to be able to open their book.
It all comes back too fast.
But which thing is she staring at?
The first thing he does is take a well deserved shower. He kinda smells like snake, and Draco, plus he really needs something to wake him up. Just because Draco slept through most of the night doesn’t mean Harry did. Of course, he gets out of the shower right as the others are heading down to breakfast, which means Ron teases him and Seamus and Dean don’t fully get the joke but laugh anyways. Neville just looks tired, so at least he has that going for him.
The last thing he sees of the Dursleys' house is Aunt Petunia’s panicked face and the smell of burned turkey.
“What the hell…”
“Tell me, Dearie, what do you consider to be your pastimes?”
He feels the familiar pull of Veritaserum right before the astonishment that his mother- his own pure and loving mother- used it on him. LuLu didn’t even warn him, the traitor.  Luckily he’s been learning how to deal with the potion for a while now.
Narcissa stares at him with wide eyes for a second before she’s laughing. Bending at the waist and almost to the point of snorting, and then she moves forward, completely disregarding her wand and hugging him so hard he nearly suffocates.

“There’s been another attack, are you all safe?”
“Don’t listen to him, Pans, he’s truly heartbroken!”
The first thing Draco does after being released is try to sleep.
Dumbledore gins at him, “Would you like a lemon drop before we begin?”
He doesn’t get a reply.
He’s never failed before, and he’s fought Riddle at least three times and won every time, right?” Another nod. “Even when he was at full power against baby Harry, the guy just vanished after one curse. Harry’s got this, you said it yourself, he won’t lose. He’s got Ron and Hermione, and they’ve got the three of us and we’ve never failed before, we have

Draco grins, “Well, you don’t need a name to have a good time.”
“Harry?” Godric, it’s only been a few hours and he’s missed his boyfriend’s voice, “I tried to call earlier when Sirius and Remus were here but you didn’t answer.”
“What can’t you talk about in front of us?”
Cedric laughs, light and easy, “That’s Malfoy for you. I do try to stay out of trouble though.”
Potter rolls his eyes for the second time and Draco fears he really might give the other boy a black eye before whatever this is ends.
And isn’t that the million dollar question? Draco doesn’t really know himself, but he did promise to answer any question Harry asked, and maybe if he just opened his mouth he could get

to her heart.
They’re heading to Dumbledore’s office when McGonagall stops them, almost running straight into Snape.
“Not Weasley.” Is all Draco can manage. It seems to be enough because Potter immediately feels around for his glasses. Once they’re thrown on and he can see Draco clearly, he frowns.
Narcissa straightens her back, brushes back her hair, Draco just
“So we’re dealing with a giant deadly snake, your father, the grounds-keeper who would know more about this than either of us in Azkaban, Dumbledore missing, and Potter’s inability to stay out of trouble.”
“Hermione knows them! She won’t let me get hurt-”
he do something wrong?
Draco turns away from them with a little laugh, dragging Ron over to Blaise and Narcissa for a chat so he can find what Pansy’s done with his poor boyfriend.
Harry opens his mouth to ask a question, then remembers where he is and shuts it. After a brief pet and a kiss to her forehead, Hedgwing takes off and Harry is left with a toy sized trunk, an empty cage, and a lot of confusion.
“Oh I’d give up anything to hit him across the head one good time, just not when everyone is suspicious about everything. Besides, I only have two days left to beat you at Wizard’s Chess.”
Draco pulls away and rolls his eyes, “Oh come off it, we both know you’re the brother Mum never had, and I’m almost positive you and Professor Lupin are married, so he’s family too.”
“Father has them in a room in our house and when he was too busy to hurt me himself he would stick me in there and leave me for hours on end.” Draco shakes his head, glaring at the man in front of him, “Why do you care?!”
“Mum…” Draco swallows, “I’ll write her. She’ll be fine.”
“That is exactly what I’m annoyed about.”
Things were looking up Wednesday after dinner when the Six Morons, as Pansy likes to call them, met up in the Gang’s Room for some studying and light reading. Well, he and Hermione called it ‘light reading’. Winky called it ‘an excuse to stay up late’, Blaise called it ‘an unhealthy coping mechanism’, and Ron called it ‘disgusting, but in an intellectual way’.
“I had Kreecher bring me a vile from the Black storages, but Sirius came in and told me to bring you down for hot chocolate. It’ll help with the taste.”
—————
what's up, folks? it's 3 am and I have not slept and have been crying my eyes out because everything is fucky wucky so here's a chapter with hella good things! Like luna! I love luna! And Draco being a Disaster Gay! We love a Disaster Gay! We are a Disaster Gay!
LuLu takes off with one last look at Malfoy.
Draco wakes up first, swearing he fell asleep on a couch and not a bloody comfortable bed, and that his friends had been in chairs not under sheets and fluffy blankets. He’s also pretty sure that their school books hadn’t been by a giant fireplace, and that none of them thought to cast a warming spell on a cup of coffee that definitely hadn’t been there last night. LuLu doesn’t seem to mind the development, though, so Draco decides it really isn’t
It’s the Halloween Hogsmeade weekend, and he wouldn’t miss this year’s tricks for the world.
“No, they just like sleeping. Which you do too, Ron.”
“It’s okay to say he’s acting like an old person. I won’t take offense, hon.”
“Malfoy?”

Kreecher gives him a look, but Harry assures him that he’s nowhere near as bad as Sirius is in a kitchen, and that’s how Harry finds himself cooking eggs while Kreecher makes waffles.

Pansy sighs, “Merlin, Draco, we all thought you were dead until your mother contacted us.”
Harry nods, Blaise glares at Ron who just shrugs.
Ron gives him a look, “Because I respect them?”
you remind me?”
“Yeah, Sev and I are good.” Draco mumbles. He registers Blaise politely asking them to ‘shut the fuck up’, but he might be imaging things.
“Not a threat,” Draco slides his eyes over to the boy next to him, “A warning.”

Harry’s stepping forward before Hermione or Ron can pull him back. He stands with the champions, glaring at the asshole with a gleam in her eyes.
happy given that Skeeter was now bluntly calling Cedric a piece of trash, Krum a Dark Lord, Fleur a fucking monsterus slut, and Harry the only thing worse than the Dark Arts themselves. He still wants to burn her eyebrows off for those last two statements, but Pansy had told him that he couldn’t go to jail until
“Someone get this thing off me! It’s clawing at my leather!”
But, after years of sneaking around and years of having to know everything he can to survive, Draco doesn't go inside. He takes a long look at the area around him.
“Come, Draco.”
Help them straight into Azkaban, that is.

I’d never offend you! You’re the best thing to ever happen to me, honest!”
Some time during his thoughts he’d managed to get dressed. When he came back to his head Blaise was leading him down the grand staircase to the dining room. Without his shoes it feel weird, but then again he wasn’t being abused like his parents probably were, so why did shoes matter?
i hope it was up to your expectations! be warned though, i have a path if i decide to keep umbitch around and a bath if i decide to toss her out, i'm just not sure which path to take...yet
“But you haven’t asked a question, have you?”
. Draco curses himself before making his way straight to Snape’s office, spitting out the password and barging in.
Between that and the trust fund Draco’s been adding to since he was sixteen and realized he might have to flee his home, he should be covered for about a year.
But that sounds a little creepy, plus Blaise always checks addresses and Draco doubts that his friend would want to visit a house that’s on record as destroyed with possible ghosts. The second that Kingsley stops finding that joke funny Draco’s making him change it.
“I decided to take him with me to the headmaster’s office, Dumbledore is bound to have books that might help, if all else it will bore him to sleep.”

Lucius has a sinking feeling in his stomach, like he knows what Draco is going to do before he does it.
And then Lucius opens his mouth and says, “I don’t know.”
His eyes flash in that beautiful grey way, his hair rises just enough to tickle the outskirts of Harry’s vision. Warm to the touch, soft and sweet like a roasted marshmallow. Only this marshmallow has killed for him and would probably do so again.

Hermione and Millie took refuge in the library. Hermione’s been dying to explore it, she went on for thirty minutes about how the restricted section was a laugh compared to all the books in the Malfoy Library, and she’s completely right. It helps that the library is one of Draco’s favorite rooms.
“My sleep schedule is fine, thanks.”
“Merlin, did you listen to a word Mr. Malfoy said?” Blaise rolls his eyes, “You’ll be learning occlumency. It’s a-fuck why did no one think to explain this to you?”
His last thought before everything goes black is a vivid image of Pansy and Blaise cussing him out. Who knew he could predict the future?
“You’ll be okay for a few months, won’t you?” Ron asks.
“Honey-”
“Are you sure you want to do this?” Draco asks, like they were the ones with secrets too big for their own feet.

“Ah, hogwash, Willie, let ‘m have his fun. ‘S not easy being without a wand when ya already gotten one.”
They’re quiet for a moment, Draco watches the fish swimming in the moonlit lake.
“He asked us if Mr. Malfoy was kind to you, and we thought he was until Christmas.”
Hermione flushes, “I wouldn’t go that far, ma’am, I just-”
franchises…franchises that Theo inherited….“Wanna help me with my papers?”
That ears him a sleepy smile, “Please, you’d be lost without us and you know it.”
The elf is all business, “Master Draco was only tryin’ to help Mister Potter! Dobby had orders not let Mister Potter die is all! Dobby meant no harm!”
“If you betray us, it will cost you your life.”
Harry supposes the elf is right. He is older, and probably wiser, than Harry is. They finish breakfast and Kreecher refuses to let him help clean up the kitchen, so Harry makes his way up the stairs to his room.
“Or dying spells, preferably not green or pink.”
Harry nods again, a force of habit for when he’s not at Hogwarts, and then remembers what Remus said about speaking. “Yes, you’re right.”
Hermione laughs, nearly bumping into Ron and Pansy, “That’s because you’ve decided to become Pomfrey’s torture toy.”
The last thing Harry had ever expected was for Dobby to appear right before him and bow to Malfoy.
Fields of fresh flowers, giant snakes flying into purple nests up in the tops of trees that shine in the sunlight. Geia, young and half her size, chasing a blue dragon-looking snake through snow fields. The same snake, tall and dangerous, glistening wings like the night sky stretching out as she speaks to thousands of snakes before her. Geia flying with the dragons, taking baths in springs surrounded by glowing plants. Playing hide and seek with pixies and flying up to ask the trees if she could rest on their branches.

Dumbledore raises an eyebrow, “I have no clue what you’re talking about, Mister Zabini.”
“Fleur!” He throws his arms around her and Harry has to admit she isn’t as pretty as he originally thought she was. “C'est si bon de te voir! Comment vas-tu mon amour?”
He was going to have a stroke before this class was over with. Hagrid took Granger’s book and opened it with ease after running a finger down it’s spine. It had been that simple? Oh fuck he was gonna blow.
“If it troubles you I would love to ease your mind.”
“I...I could be okay with an investment.” Howie says, frowning. “A debt investment, maybe?”
“It’s settled then.” Holy fuck, is Severus
weirdly convenient.”
His entire world is filled with the word ‘yes’, something he likens to a hazy cloud of pink. To lust rushing through his veins, to the areas he’s thinking with instead of his brain.
“Would you care to explain to me,” Lupin leans against his desk, arms crossed and eyebrow raised expectantly, “If you’re okay?”
“Scars can’t hurt! You’re just hiding from your feelings!”
“Fine, fine. You may think this is a set back, but really, I’m excited. It’s been ages since I’ve seen our dear friend Padfoot, and I’m quite looking forward to our time together.”
about his ideas, but the whole school knows it was opened fifty years ago. Didn't you read about it in
“I do believe that may be my doing,” Severus frowns, “And to answer your questions, we are at the beginning of a war, that is all the reasoning you need to be trained.”
Lucius felt his heart squeeze at the sight, but the pain in his arm was starting to worsen. “Stay here, I’ll be right back.”
Draco. No one gives a shit, everyone here minds their own business for the most part. If you’re that worried use a glamor.”
Molly Wealsey starts to get a little too red in the face for comfort, even Mr. Wealsey takes a step back.
“It tells me that you have become a frequent visitor of Dementors, and I would like to know why. The
Harry watches, slightly amused, as Morgana’s two inch long body turns to glare at Nagini, who’s deemed the morning important enough to venture out of the bed Harry went and got her on the second day of break. Morgana is roughly the size of Nagini’s eyes, it’s an amusing sight.
“Hippogriffs don’t make deep cuts, Draco. What really happened?”
“Me either. I’ve been so busy making clothes that I forgot a date was supposed to be a part of my ensemble…” Pansy gives Theo a calculated look. “You dress up nicely, don’t you Theo?”
“But that soup is being orange, and this soup is being….” She holds up a spoonful, watching the unidentified brown liquid splash back into her bowl.
moranga: i HATE you
For the second time that day, the crowd cheers for him.
Blaise is one second away from cutting off his arm and putting it in a museum. “He….you’ve been...what?”
“What do you want, Potter?” Draco sighs. He’s tired, he doesn’t want to think about anything after what he just experienced, not to mention that he definitely does not have the emotional energy for this. Potter is lucky as hell that everyone else is asleep, he can only imagine the gossip if Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter were seen casually speaking in the middle of the fucking hallway. Would Scarface ever learn to use his brain? Draco was starting to run out of hope.
There’s a lot of roaring, screaming and cheering from the crowd and then finally,
The manor seems smaller now, not looming over him like the past few years. He doesn't feel the slightest bit of anxiety looking at the steps, walking into the door feels more like coming home than it ever has.
“Dumbledore is-”
“You cook now?!”
“So your biggest fear….”
They work for a few more hours, interrupted by customers, but not many. Weird, considering that they’re in the middle of the notorious August School Rush.
“I suppose that makes sense. Ron said she wasn’t a threat, poor thing has been wound up by my feet all morning.”
“Say something!” he all but yells, making Draco flinch and finally meet green eyes that are open. Not closed. Potter is sitting, not lying limp on the Quidditch field. Draco sucks in a deep breath.
Draco rolls his eyes at Pansy’s usual bullshit. It is
Snape drags him to the Potions labs every Tuesday and Thursday before practice to help find a cure for his arm because, naturally, his father used some curse not even Dumbledore could figure out, so far the trial and eras weren’t going well. Draco had probably used up half the school’s reservoir of Blood Replenishing potions by now.
Draco gives him a look, one that Kingsley is familiar and fond of. One that means there might still be hope for one Draco Malfoy.
. It’s a wonder the boy is still alive at all and it pisses off Draco so much that when they land and Potter is
Harry tries to wait patiently, but it’s very dark, they never did put a light down here, and he knows it’s bad to eavesdrop. Aunt Petunia always questions him to make sure he doesn't listen in to her conversations, but he hears his
But, he’s also not used to it at all.
His loyal Kneazle. Rubbing against Black’s legs.
“Can I try again, professor? I think I have something...Draco kinda helped.”
Harry Potter looked like he was either going to burst into tears or murder everyone within five feet of him. Draco wondered for a moment what the hell could’ve happened, but it didn’t really take a long time for him to figure it out.
Theo has to aparate them there so the Ministry doesn’t know about Draco’s probably illegal trip to another country, and Draco uses the time to persuade himself that this is going to be perfectly fine.
pansy: to think that we were worried about you
“The wound on your arm, it’s not healing because of the dark magic I suspect was on the blade. Normal healing potions and spells won’t work on it, you’ll have to keep your cast until we can speak to Severus about this. And yes, I will be speaking to Severus about this. All of this.”
Maybe Hufflepuffs aren’t bad afterall...Draco watches him walk away before realizing he’s acting like a first year with a crush, turning on his heel and marching to the lunch room so Pansy and Blaise can give him shit for missing Transfiguration. Again.
At some point during his mental battle he’s stood up and made his way to the other boy. His mouth moves before he can tell his brain to stop. “You have to follow what Hermione says, even if she tells you to stop breathing. You cannot be seen, you have to be punctual, you can’t get hurt, you can’t let your emotions get the better of you and-”
It was decided that the Weasleys, all of them, were staying for the entirety of break. Charlie and Bill didn’t feel comfortable leaving their father, much less their siblings and mother, alone. Molly hasn’t stopped fretting over Arthur, and while he’s looking much better, he still isn’t in top shape.
“Oh shove off, I’ve been waiting to redo his closet.”
Ellios: I'm going to help with your trauma
Draco sits in silence for a moment, trying to wrap his head around a life without his friends. It’s unbearable, to say the least, so he says, “Sir. I fail to see how this affects my original question.”
Or maybe he shouldn’t be surprised at all. Draco quickens his pace and arrives to the two at the same time Lupin steps into the light supplied by Snape’s wand.
“How?” he asked for the class after Hagrid instructed them to open it.
“Isn’t it cool!” Harry grins, still walking like speaking to a beast will keep it from killing him. Maybe if Draco ties him to a chair the Goblet won’t kill him and he can spend the entire Tournament getting yelled at.
The kid glares. “I wouldn’t know, would I?”
“Not of wizarding kind,” Blaise smirks, “More….personal, if you will-”
“And that side is?”
for backup! You know what they did?”
They’re running businesses now.
Narcissa groans and shakes her head, but there’s a faint smile on her lips. Sirius makes to hug her in greeting but then a different voice cuts them off.
“Hello, Harry.” No need to sound so suspicious, but Krum does. Harry looks around them, sees that no one is really paying attention, and leans closer.
They surprisingly haven’t made a dent in his bank account, yet. If Draco keeps letting her go wild they might end up being in trouble.
“Professor Lupin!” Pansy smiles, “How lovely to see you so happy! I hear Draco’s uncle has that effect on people.”
to the point that Draco thought sex, love, and romance just didn’t
The only thing worse is the laughter that Riddle is screaming, but he’s not screaming.
Dumbledore had almost fucking hugged him when he told the old coot what had happened in the infirmary. Taking that as a good sign, he did finally feel the anxiety wearing away from his bones. For a long time there three potions hadn’t been enough, but he knew four were a little too dangerous. To remind Potter of their agreement, he kept picking on the boy, but he could tell Potter wasn’t really offended anymore. Somehow it made him feel a little lighter.
“I’m not leaving them!” He shouts.
“You will
With the way the sun is setting on their family living room, all light and happy, warm and safe, he’d have to agree.
“Hmm? Oh…” Harry bites his lip, then lets out a long sigh. “You’re about to think me mental-”
“Line up everyone!” he roars, completely gone to his anger now. He doesn’t even care that a crowd is forming. “Harry Potter’s giving out signed photos!”
“Not until spring, there’s still a few months left you know.”
be talking to Griphook about this.”
“Look,” Harry sighs, moving away from his spot by the windows, “If this is about the merpeople, Ra said it’s fine. He gets it, if anything I think he’s more pissed at Dumbledore for being so reckless. I healed one of the mermen you attacked, and if he had the time to take us back to shore then the rest are probably fine so, you know, no harm done.”
Only Pansy is nowhere to be seen, and he ends up staring right at Harry curled up in one of the armchairs. That softens him up, partly because
and now she’s moved onto something called Golden Girls.
Sirius snorts beside him, “Thought he was being clever about it too, like James and I wouldn’t notice his mood swings, or him disappearing in the middle of the night. One time he tried to tell us his mother was sick the week after Christmas break like we hadn’t just seen her!”
They wouldn’t, of course, but that doesn't mean he’d say ‘no’ if they ever asked.
Theo huffs, retracting himself from the awkwardly long hug and fixing him with a look that’s ruined by the tear marks on his cheeks. “You’re not welcome.”
----------
He makes a token attempt, lying back in the room he’s called his since he was born, closing his eyes, paying special attention to his breaths, focusing on the feeling of silk sheets against his skin. At some point in the night Draco even finds himself counting sheep, considering breaking his probation and brewing an illegal sleeping potion, because at this point in his life things can’t really get worse.
He hears screaming all around him, Dumbledore casts a spell, there’s a flash of light and the Dementors are gone but Potter….
Draco asks. His blood is running cold. If she’s scared he can’t imagine how Harry will react. Fleur doesn’t get scared.
Almost like some weird ironic trick of fate, his Patronus had to be abnormal and rare.
Monday begins at 9:45 sharp for his Astronomy exam, followed by Charms and a brief lunch break that quickly turns into a study break for the end of the day DADA Exam. By time Dinner rolls around, Draco’s dead to everything but his notes. Blaise and Pansy steer him to the Gang’s Room, where he becomes aware of Hermione’s notes and some voices around them.
“He’s fine, Ron. I wouldn’t be so calm if he was still in any serious danger.”
Draco starts to make a comment about that not being particularly surprising, but then Dumbledore walks through the door and he has to bite his tongue. He learned a few months ago how much fun pissing off a powerful wizard is, and once is honestly more than enough.
George nods beside his twin, “We were just dropping candy for a bullying git!”
It’s two in the morning when Draco finally gives in and sits up, eyeing everything in his room.
Magic always lingers for bloodlines like theirs.
Harry pauses.
“Naturally, I haven’t seen him in nearly a year, much less had time to celebrate his birthday in a way he deserves.”
“Well if they didn’t conjure the Mark then who did?!” Crouch asks in a shrill voice that kinda makes Draco want to rip out his vocal cords. The only reason he doesn’t is because Harry has started rubbing his thumb across the back of Draco’s hand and it’s caused him to finally stop shaking.
He tries, he does, but it taste like smoke and-
One to Pansy to tell her that she was a flower among weeds. One to Blaise, it definitely sang, and may or may not have consisted of Draco calling him every embarrassing nickname he could think of. One to Flint that said ‘thank you for your kindness and patience’ with no signature, he’s not a fool after all. One to both Crabbe and Goyle that thanked them for their friendship. One for Snape and Dumbledore, both thanks for everything they’ve done for him. Simple, polite, and straight to the point with most of them. Good politics is all it is, the more people like you, the more they’re likely to do what you want, or stay loyal when you need them to.
You’re giving out
“No, I’m being a brat because you poisoned my hot chocolate.”
Draco is going to vomit. As soon as his heart starts working again he’s going to throw up all over her uniform.
A problem, because he can’t find any of them. Or at least, he
stands right now, not exactly the time to be testing the waters, and it’s not exactly safe for them to be seen together even if Narcissa is secretly on their side.
Harry does put the cat down...on his lap that is. He absently pets her and wonders what Malfoy is up to right now. He’d been forced home, which sucked for him because break would’ve been the perfect time to corner the blonde and force him to fess up. Not actually hating Malfoy was weirder than...well everything.
“You’d rather follow Voldemort than stay loyal to your friends?! Your
“What?”
“What do you want, Potter?” Draco asks, evenly, as calm as he can manage, quiet to an extent.
Perfect Weasley.
space.
They don’t say anything, but Harry gets the feeling they won’t take well to the ‘Potter Stinks’ badge shining on his back. He just hopes Seeker got a good picture of it. It’s the only thing he wants in the headlines, thank you very much.
As soon as that’s done he doesn’t even eat. He blinks once in the classroom and then he’s being cornered by a girl that looks a lot like Daphne, only she’s wearing Ravenclaw robes, so it must be Astoria.
“Misty is not doing well with the alone.” She says, like it’s some sort of big secret. “Mister Draco be saving Misty from dying with madness, and Misty will be saving Mister Draco from the madness too.”
Weasley has other ideas.
He waves them both away, “Please, you’re hungry from your travels. I won’t be long, do save me something from Crabbe and Goyle if you can.”
Ignoring him, Draco begins to pace, so Snape ends up in a chair instead.
“The iron has antirust charms! The steps have anti-trip magic! And the flowers are being pretty! And the spirals are difficult for Mister Draco to be throwing himself off of!”
something he had only
Harry nods in agreement and that gets Lupin laughing off to the side.
And sure, the Firebolt that Harry gets from a ‘mysterious admirer’ during dinner annoys him just a bit because he knows how annoying Quidditch will be next year, but he can’t fight the smile tugging at his lips when he sees the look of pure joy on Harry’s face.
Harry yawns back, “You’re skin is pretty perfect. A little on the pale side, though.”
And he does. Draco goes all the way back to when he first got himself into this mess. Something about Quirrell had rubbed him the wrong way, so he went and complained to Dumbledore who had cryptically told him to be careful. And because he, the big bad eleven-year-old, thought himself capable, he had taken matters into his own hands and started following around weird people. Like Quirrell, and Harry Potter, which is how he ended up saving Harry from the beasts in the woods that was very weird because the very same beast he saved Potter from was the one that Quirrell met with a lot and when Draco saw the man
Harry smiles at him so gently it makes him loosen his grip, “I won’t. I’ll see you later, promise.”
Harry rolls his eyes, but they’re not done yet.
“-plus we totally saw him and Harry on the map last year.”
“You asked me how long...since last year.”
Potter picks that exact moment to smile at Hagrid and announce “I’ll do it.”
shop owners, but Diagon is what’s recommended. I’m not experienced enough in potions, hell, I barely know the good ingredients from the bad ones. Carla says she doesn’t count, people like Sal is a little
“Imagine thinking you two brats are honorable….”
“But people will recognize me-”
.” Sirius adds. The lights start dancing again, Harry’s half tempted to take a step back. “I won’t let him do it again.”
“What the hell were you thinking?!”
All piled into the main living room with a book playing overhead on the ceiling, next to little stars Remus charmed to look like constellations.
TW for abuse, although it'snot as bad as the first chapter if I remember correctly. Still, be careful!
“Naturally,” Pansy rolls her eyes, “Look, Draco. Last year I think I slept maybe once a week because I was so worried about you, and this year is no different. If you agree, Blaise and I can stop losing our bloody minds over you because we’d know you were safe. If you can’t lie to us, we can’t lie to you. Same with betrayal. It’s a two way street with how our friendship started.”
“And Sisily does not mean to be being disrespectful, but Master Draco be loving lemon
“Mister Draco is being a liar!”
Firebolt from Sirius.
“Then he won’t know.” Harry says instead, “He’ll never find out. You have my word.”
Memory Draco does not get up, as a matter of fact, Real Draco is almost positive Memory Draco is knocked the fuck out, but that doesn’t stop Lucius from beating him awake only to punch him back to sleep. Draco doesn’t bother hiding it from Potter this time, he thinks about it when his father grabs Memory Draco’s lifeless arm and puts a dark blade against his still bleeding wound, but the worst was surely over.
His kitten purrs up at him, climbing all over as if making sure he was okay, and when she sees the brace he’s been forced to wear to keep damned ointment on, she growls. “It’s okay girl, just a small set back is all.”
I'm so excited for next chapter because it's finally finals and the final task omg are y'all excited? I am :)
Krum grins, “I hope her face makes headlines. What an awful woman.”
better looking.”
“Um...is there something wrong, Madam?”
Potter is lying face up on the ground, eyes closed and mouth open, and Draco, for once in his life, can’t think of anything worse.
have to make plates?!”
Misty is quiet the next day.
chocolate. Miss Pansy be loving strawberry and Mister Blaise be loving turtle and caramel. That is why we put them all out, ma’am.”
They also, apparently, went to the Ministry every single day after he was released. Demanding to see him, threatening legal action, pointing out that the Ministry never even offered him a Mind Healer for the months he spent in the hell hole. The Ministry was on the verge of giving in when his mother’s probation officer ran in screaming about the Manor being on fire.
He’s neck deep in an Armithacy paper when the floo lights up, followed by
Harry’s eyes bulge out of his head,
----------
“You weren’t kidding when you said you have a date?” Ron stutters. He looks oddly put out, which is interesting considering he seriously doesn’t have a date. Which isn’t a big deal to Draco, but is a big deal to Pansy.
Because all of the Weasleys are staying, the Malfoys have joined in on the break sharing, letting Draco stay over every night. Narcissa says it’s because of the attack, but Harry secretly thinks she just likes having so many people around. Lucius looks a little uncomfortable, tucked into an armchair, but his smile is real, and he’s been around just as much as Narcissa has, so Harry thinks it’s fine.
“But we could still ask her. We don’t have a lot to go off of here! Anything that could work we need to use!”
On Monday, Hagrid lectured them, a long painful experience but it’s now too cold to be outside for a long period of time, and he’d rather listen to the oaf speak than give into Blaise’s demands for a warming charm
He images Anvi, bowing in the same way, long curly hair in the dirt, and feels stronger. He can do this.
“I’m surprised you didn’t go after Potter,” Flint remarks towards the end of the meal.
The two in front of him share some looks, communicating something he wished he could be a part of.
The quiet voice vibrates from the other side of the fence, making a mockery of the eerie silence that Draco can’t stand.
It’s priceless, the way everything about Snap freezes and he can almost see the flaring up of nerves right above the other man’s eyeballs. He can pinpoint it by now with how many Potter-head-pains he’s had. Before his beloved godfather can run wild with his question, Draco provides a bit more context just so he can fully share his pain with someone.
Chapter 7: The Gloat
Everyone landed in the Leaky Cauldron 15 minutes later hoping that no one would bother them. “Ah, Severus is it really that time?” Tom the owner said looking at Harry with such hope in his eyes, only looking away when Harry glared at him. “Yes.” Severus said also glaring at Tom who knows that Harry hates it when people stare at him. “Right well, you all have a wonderful morning so far its not to packed.” Tom said looking uncomfortable getting caught up in the moment every time he got to see Harry Potter. They walked to the back of the building and tapped on the brick wall, as Diagon Alley appeared into view. “Let’s get to Gringotts and then we will have Cissa and Tom grab your books while you get fitted for your robes.” Severus said looking around seeing it really wasn’t as packed as he thought it would be, hoping that this would be an easy trip and they could get home he and Tom still had to do their lesson plans and send it to Dumbledore who had thrown a fit about letting them become professors.
Harry was in shock; how could my mom hide this from them? Harry collapsed into the chair that had been offered and put his hands in his head, did mum hide this or is something else at work here? Closing his eyes, he begged his mum to answer, “They knew you were their son, Harry but three weeks after you were born, they ended up in the hospital with no memory of you or of us being together. Lucius thought it best to hide it from the public because we didn’t want Dumbledore to know who your real fathers were. James being a good friend to us all agreed to marry me, and blood adopt you. We changed your birthday your real date of birth is June 26th, 1979 Harry you were 2 years old when we were killed.” His mum said with such sadness in her eyes she was fearful that Harry would hate her. So, Harry was 8 years old instead of 7 which would make sense on why he seemed to be smarter than he should be his brain was more developed. “I am sorry you had to find out this way honey, but after everyone gets purged you all will remember and Harry you will still have my eyes, but you’ll look more like Tom and Sev though you will still have some of James features.” Lily said to make sure that Harry understood how important the purge was. Finally looking up into the eyes of his fathers who looked shocked and confused he smiled and said, “Mum explained, but for you to understand we all need to do the purge.” Harry said they both nodded and all of them got ready for the purge ritual. “Now all of you need to take this potion and lay down in the circle this ritual takes about 2 hours to get through and doing everyone all at once will save us time.” Gailak said they all did as instructed and laid down in the circle as the goblins each sat on a rune and started chanting the goblins then took a dropped of everyone’s blood and put it on a piece of parchment to know what was being purged. Everyone one but Harry’s were the same except Sirius and Remus’s Hate potion the purge list is as followed
“Harry! Was that necessary? We just wanted the best for you.” Hermione said looking shocked about what had just happened. “If it wasn’t necessary, I wouldn’t have done it, be thankful Lady Magic was lenient with you and Ron.” Harry said looking bored but in side was relieved. “You’ve ruined me! I will do everything in my power to destroy you.” Dumbledore yelled looking like a child having a tantrum. “Really, you’ve already lost most of your power Headmaster. Do you really want to lose the rest?” Harry asked looking really bored now. “I advise you to start proving you can change your ways, so you can possibly have a chance in getting back in Lady Magics good graces.” Harry said before taking Draco’s hand and walking towards the Great Hall doors. Not seeing, Lady Fate watching the whole scene agreeing with what the young elf had said and hoping she could help Dumbledore be the good wizard she had seen him become.
Severus Snape and his husband Tom Riddle I know you have the wrong impression of me the only thing I can suggest is a purge test and hope you understand afterwards. I leave you Vault 590 with all the Potters library potions books as well as very rare ingredients.
“He is going to need a lot of potions, Sev, and we are going to have to rebreak some of his bones so that they can set right.” Cissa explained she hated that she would have to do this, but it needed to be done. “I will put him in a magic-induced coma; that’s the best I can do for him, so he isn’t in pain.” She said with tears in her eyes.
“NO! I must get out of here now; please let me go… Wait, what happened to my studder? What have you done to me?” Harry said, sounding angry
“Today I will find away to end myself, I cannot live in this retched house another moment.” Harry thought as he laid on his small baby mattress. “I just have to get through the whole day and then when they leave with Duddley for his birthday, I’ll end it then.” Harry said to himself, this was never his home or even felt like a home so why should he stay.
True name:
Lucius Malfoy, I know we had to hide the fact that we got along and dear brother I am sorry that I am gone, but I hope Harry and Draco become great friends. I leave you vault 589
Severus sat down in the chair and then looked at him, clearing his throat he started to speak. “November 1st, 1979 a prophecy was read at a diner in a town called hogsmead by a soon to be professor at the wizarding school in our world. It talked about a child being born on the seventh month would kill the dark lord and he would have powers the dark lord knows not, the prophecy went on stating that those who had faced the dark lord three times and won would produce this child and that he would mark the child as his equal that neither could die in the hands of the other and that as long as one of them lived the other would survive. Now at the time everyone thought the dark lord was a man named Lord Voldemort but there is no such lord, it’s a lie told by the man who really is the dark lord pretending to be part of the light side. That man’s name is Albus Dumbledore…” Severus went to say something but looked down and saw Harry was crying
5. Skele-gro (once after having to rebreak Harry’s bones that did not heal correctly)
As they walked into Gringotts Griphook walked up to Harry “Harry! How are you? Is it really time for your first year of Hogwarts already?” the goblin asked smiling up at his friend “Grippy! I am doing great, and yes its time for my first year, I need your dad to take me to my vault so I can get money for my things.” Harry said smiling back happy that he got to stay friends with Griphook. Just as he was asking for the goblins father someone shouted out his name. “Harry!? Harry Potter is that really you?” Asked the voice he didn’t recognize Harry turned around to see nothing but red. Molly Weasley and her family had just walked into Gringotts to get the little money they had for the kids school things when she saw a boy speaking to a goblin with such ease, she then recognized the boy and couldn’t have been more excited. Harry not knowing who this woman or the other redheads where backed up slightly to get some distance. “Yes, my name is Harry but its not just Potter.” He said glaring just a little, he really hated when people didn’t use his real name. “Of course, its Potter you’re the boy who lived.” The woman said looking like she knew who he was, not even seeing who he was with. “I am sorry Madam, but my name is Hariad Argulus Severus Potter Riddle Snape so yes its not just Potter.” Harry said glaring more this time after being told he was wrong. “Oh, Harry your just confused your parents would be ashamed of you for changing your name and letting yourself be adopted by these two.” The woman said looking at Severus and Tom like they were the plaque, then had the notion that she could take Harry’s hand and guide him towards the front of Gringotts.
Harry was fuming by the time he got down to the dungeons. “* Draco meet me in dads quarters. What I’m hearing needs to be heard by them. *” Harry sent out to Draco through the bond. “x Okay, see you soon. x” Draco replied sounding interested and confused on what was going on. Harry walked into his parents quarters ready to throw something. Looking at his dad gritting his teeth he said, “Calming draught now.” Harry was close to losing control. Just as Severus handed his son the draught Draco walked in rushing to Harry. “I’m here Har, breath in deep and out slowly just listen to my voice.” Draco said doing everything Lily had taught them to calm Harry down. “Thanks, Drayk my mother says she’s proud of you.” Harry said looking up at his bonded.
Severus ran to Harry, but Draco got to him first hugging him. “Its okay Harry, I’m here you are safe theys can’t hurt you I won’ts let them.” Draco said and he cradled Harry who clung to Draco he wouldn’t allow anyone to hurt his Harry not ever as he thought that both Harry’s magic and Draco’s swirled around them and connected together with such beauty and grace that only those watching new what had just happened. After the magic died down both boys were exhausted, they fell asleep on the floor well after becoming bonded in magic, mind, and soul most people would be drained. “I knew they were mates, but I didn’t expect that so soon.” Lucius said looking amused as he went over and picked up his son as Severus picked up Harry. It was time for them all to get a long nap after all the excitement.
Sirius and Remus had a Hate Potion to Hate Severus Snape, Tom Riddle and The Malfoys.
Potter Argon Castle
2. Nutrition Potion (three times a day for the next 6 months)
It had been four years to the day that the Potter Riddle Snape Family and Malfoys had the purge done and even with the law suit that Dumbledore went through with the goblins, he was still in office as head warlock as well as headmaster of Hogwarts. “Tom, I am still not sure if we should let Harry go to Hogwarts, I don’t want to run the risk of Dumbledore trying anything.” Severus said knowing that Dumbledore would do everything possible to get Harry away from them. “We can’t keep him hidden and having him go to a different school than his bonded will hurt them both magically.” Tom said ever since the day of Dumbledore’s first visit Harry and Draco’s bond has been anything but normal, both could convey their thoughts, feelings and give each other magic when needed. Even though Harry was technically 12 medical history puts him as only 11 so he was starting Hogwarts the same year as Draco. “We’ve tested how far they can be away from one another before it starts to cause problems, having Harry at a different school shouldn’t do any harm.” Severus said but knowing that they couldn’t be apart more than a week before it started to drain them, Severus knew his argument wasn’t going to be won that Harry had to go to Hogwarts. Severus knew there was only one way for Harry to be safe and he would only do it for his family. “Sev, you know that we can’t keep them apart we have to let them go…. Sev what are you thinking?” Tom said looking at his husband knowing that Severus was planning something that he wasn’t liking but was determined to do. “I’m going to take Lucius up on his offer, and I think you should to.” Severus said looking unhappy about doing this but knew it would be a sure way to keep Harry away from Dumbledore. Tom looked at his husband surprised at the lengths he would go for his family, this was Dumbledore the man would do anything to have the world run the way he wanted it to be ran. “Sev, are you sure? I don’t want you doing this if its going to make you unhappy.” Tom said as he took his husbands hand looking concerned “I will be unhappy but if this helps keep Harry safe, I will do everything to make it happen.” Severus said with such determination that even Tom couldn’t stop him. “Very well I will take Lucius up on his offer too, no point in not having both of us there.” Tom said with a smile oh Dumbledore was not going to be happy with the board of governors, Tom had been trying to get the defense post for years and because they could never keep a professor more than a year it was finally his chance that he could finally take that curse away and stay at Hogwarts for the 8 years that Harry was there. Severus just smiled knowing that the curse on the defense post was going to be lifted and no one would be the wiser. “Well let’s go tell Lucius the good news.” Severus said smiling knowing that his family will be there made taking the Potions position a little more bearable.
After leaving Gringotts and asking Griphook to come over for dinner later, Severus, Lucius and the boys walked over to the robe shop while Tom and Cissa went to get their books and school supplies. Walking into the shop they saw that they weren’t going to be lucky on not seeing that woman again. “More Hogwarts students?” The shop owner said, “Right over on the platform and I will get you measured then you can let me know what you’ll need.” She said again noticing how tense the air got as soon as they walked in. “They both need thick winter, and Spring Cloaks and Robes as well as Dress robes shoes and boots.” Severus said luckily the boys had just gone shopping for regular clothes a couple of days ago, so they were good on everything else. Once they were measured and chose the materials they liked, they paid and had it made out to be owl to them later that night not wanting to be in the store longer than they had too. “Now that is over with all we need is your trunks and both of you need to pick out a familiar and then we can go to Olivanders and get your wand.” Lucius said looking back at the shop pray that was the last they saw of the Weasleys, he could sense that Harry was getting anxious. “Harry? Are you ok? You’ve been quite since Gringotts” Draco said with the bond it was easier to talk this way than try to whisper it. “Yeah, I’m fine Drayk I am just tired of all the drama my name brings.” Harry said looking at Draco with such sadness in his eyes. “Oh, Har I knew this was going to be hard, but I never expected this.” Draco said waving his hand towards the robe shop walking over to harry and hugging him. “As long as I have you with me Drayk I can get through these long days ahead.” Harry said hugging him back smiling. They walked towards the book shop as Tom and Cissa came out holding bags with books, quills, ink, parchment and their potions supplies plus extra. “Everything okay?” Tom said seeing that Harry looked drained hoping nothing went wrong “Yeah, just got done with our robes, now we need our trunks and we can then place all over our things in their while we pick out a familiar.” Harry said perking up when he thought about getting a pet.
A couple of months after the visit from the Minister and Dumbledore as well as their agreement to have the wills read after Harry’s birthday and everyone was nervous because today was Harry’s seventh birthday and knowing how he was treated in the past everyone in the house wanted this day to be special and to be remembered by the young boy. “Why don’t we take him to a place the wizarding world won’t bother him just for the day?” Cissa suggested She wanted to take the boys to Disney World and Universal Studios but knew it would take some convincing for the three men. “Aunt Cissa we don’t need to do anything big, I’m fine with just a small party here.” Harry said even though what Cissy was thinking sounded like loads of fun he didn’t want to be a bother even if it was his birthday. “Harry, I want to make this something to remember and was hoping to convince these men into taking you to Disney world and Universal Studios for a couple of days.” Cissa said knowing Harry must have heard her thoughts and didn’t want to cause trouble not that the boy ever troubled anyone he was so reserved only Draco seemed to be able to get him to come out of his shell. Well being bonded mates its only natural that they were close Cissa thought. “I think that’s a wonderful idea actually it will get us all away from prying eyes and we could all do with some relaxing.” Tom said with a smile it would be good for Harry to have fun and be away from the stress that the Ministry had seem to place on a seven-year-old rather than deal with it themselves.
Creature Inheritance: King of the light and Dark Elves of Amothistral
McGonagall got a handle on the class and had everyone start to try and turn their match sticks into needles. Harry and his friends got theirs to change fully on their first try, while it took Hermione and a couple of others to get it in two or three tries, Ron didn’t even get the tip to change. “Well done everyone you all did well, I want to congratulate Blaise, Theo, Draco and Harry for getting their match sticks to change on their first try, 5 points each to your house. McGonagall said with a stern smile not really letting anyone know how proud she was of her nephew.
To Sirius Black I bequeath Vault 586 just don’t tell lily what’s inside or you’ll be joining me. Let it also be known that Peter Pettigrew is our secret keeper for our house in Godrics Hollow. He has been acting strange, so I feel its important to make it known that Albus Dumbledore requested we switch to Peter instead of Sirius. If Godrics Hollow is attacked know that Peter was the keeper and Dumbledore was the binder. Dumbledore stop pressuring my family into your fake war.

4. Dreamless Sleep Potion (once a night until Harry is healed)
They left right after dinner towards the Headmasters office, not really wanting to see the old goat but knew they had to show up as civilized as possible. “Acid Pops.” Tom said with a roll of his eyes. Walking into the Headmasters office Dumbledore wasn’t the only one there. “Eight o’clock right on time, good I asked all the teachers here tonight so we can discuss Harry’s future and make sure his behavior in classes will stop being so disruptive.” Dumbledore said not even bothering to see the looks of shock on everyone’s face. “Now Harry I will not be having you throwing students up against a wall anymore and this thing with Draco in pretending to be gay will stop as well.” Dumbledore continued giving everyone a grandfather smiles of sadness that made it seem like he was sorry that Harry was doing all of this. “I will stop you right there Professor before you make a bigger fool of yourself than you already have. First off, I am gay, Second, I will not stop what is going on with Draco and I since that would be going against Lady Magic herself as she was the one who accepted our Magic and Soul bond at just nine years old. Third, I will try not to throw anyone against a wall but I will warn you if Mr. Weasley or Miss Granger do not cease and desisted the notion that I am their best friend than I will not be held accountable for what happens when they have already been warned twice now. That also goes for any of the Gryffindor’s who think that just because I am Harry Potter and my mother was Lily, they have some right to demand I am changed from a Slytherin to a Gryffindor.” Harry said looking at Dumbledore with very bright purple eyes of determination that everyone in the room could tell that Harry was not happy about being told to stay away from Draco. “I will also put in if this whole conversation was about you trying to take control of my life and not actually about something to do with school or my classes, I have no problem going to the school board and filing a complaint to them for you using your position as Headmaster for anything other than being a School Headmaster.” Harry smirked at the goat with such malice that would have made Severus and Tom laugh if they weren’t in the company of other teachers. “I think this meeting is over, like I said before I am a busy man and I do have another meeting.” Dumbledore said looking shot down and ready to throw a tantrum for not getting his way. “I will then say good night to you all and see you all in class tomorrow.” Harry said bowing as he walked out of the office and started to go back to the Slytherin common room, or try to that is until he got his in the back by a curse.
“How dare that man think, that there is something wrong with my behavior.” Harry said getting closer to the edge of a full transformation. “What has Luci found out? I don’t want to go in blind when we go to this so-called meeting.” Severus said pacing back and forth in their quarters looking concerned. “Sevvy, sit down you are going to ware a hole out on the floor, everything is fine he’s just trying to get a rise out of us. I just got done talking to Luci and he said that Dumbledore hasn’t been complaining or trying to do anything at the Ministry. So, Dumbledore is really just trying to get Harry to do something that will give him cause to try to get him away from Severus and I even though legally he couldn’t do it.” Tom said walking to up to his husband and giving him a hug. “Dad, Father, I think we should introduce our trump card, it will probably give us more room to breath and keep him in line.” Harry said but wasn’t sure that his parents would go for that idea, they hadn’t planned to use that bit of leverage until on a later date. “I don’t believe we will have to use that card just yet Harry, but if he continues to be a problem then we will send the documents over as well as watch his face as everything gets blown up.” Severus said also hoping that they didn’t have to use it anytime soon.
Draco wrote, admiring how elegantly his own words flowed, compared to Harry’s scruffy scribble.
"I'm still right," Malfoy insists.
“Potter won’t want to know,” Draco answered sullenly. “He already made that completely clear. He doesn't want anything serious, and it’s not like I need anything from him,” Draco continued, hearing his voice rise sharply. “I won’t be asking him for time, or money. He won’t even have to acknowledge them. I’ll be enough of a father to make up for the deficit.”
"What?"
This is the happiest
Mille and Greg both laughed at that, because it was true. Pansy, always a mistress of reinvention, had styled herself as a paragon of saintly motherhood since giving birth to Cygnus six months before. She’d be entirely cross with Draco for about three seconds, before she decided it was the best news that she’d ever heard. Millie gave Draco a hug, and kissed his cheek.
Molly Weasley might clip out a picture of.
is not the word Harry would have used. He tries to find a way to describe what a terrible idea it is to invite Malfoy to a party full of people who fought on the opposite side of a war
Draco had to laugh. Harry rarely looked rattled, but this afternoon he certainly did.
"Alright, fine. But we didn't eat curry."
"So what? You don't like French food anymore?"
He’d been too busy being sick, feeling bitter about Louis St Clare, and making life-altering decisions to actually sit back and feel happy about his choice. Even so, there was a tiny person growing inside of him – a brand new life – and that, he supposed, was pretty exciting.
To his dismay, neither of those happened, and the two of them sat in awkward silence. What on earth had he been thinking? He’d walked away from Harry that very day, and told him that he wanted to get over loving him. Then he’d sent Harry a Patronus in the middle of the bloody night and kissed him at the merest hint of affection. He tucked his hair behind his ears, buying time. He was fickle and capricious, and Harry had every right to be angry at him. “Fuck, I’m sorry,” Draco said.
"Well, alright then. Chocolate and apricot jam sandwich biscuits today, I think."
Malfoy tsks. "Of course not. It's a Depression-era recipe. Things like eggs and butter were hard to get so people tried other things."
The next morning, Draco was idly leafing through one of the pregnancy books that Pans had sent over weeks before, lazing about in the settee, when Harry Firecalled and suggested that the two of them meet in Café Quendryth. Despite all of Greg’s valiant efforts, Draco found his resolve crumbling the moment that the other wizard opened his mouth.
As always, the Mediwix – Healer Braithwaite, fresh from St Mungo’s – was kind and welcoming. Draco wasn’t one for malingering, especially on the day of an important game, so it was obvious to the team Mediwix that it was a serious matter.
Harry does. He doesn’t care if this is weird as hell, he does. And he knows Other Harry can hear it, there’s no way he can’t but Harry can’t stop himself from hyperventilating, because it’s real. It’s all real. Other Harry is…
Luna wanders in to get a vegan chocolate cupcake. She takes her time choosing and then turns to Harry.
Now that Sunday had arrived, Draco was cursing his past-self with all manner of horrible hexes. He’d felt so happy and safe in Fratelli’s that he’d agreed to this visit without thinking about the consequences of actually having to be brave enough to step through the door, and face a bevy of ginger-haired Weasleys.
"Merlin help me, I'm not ready for a world where Malfoy is more culturally sensitive than Hermione," Ron says.
When he emerges Ron and Hermione are still at the table, looking expectantly at Harry and Harry still has a half hour before he needs to go to the Manor for work. He has been effectively trapped.
"You're actually surprisingly like an old lady. You make lots of biscuits and soups and go antiques shopping and read cookbooks and have a little dog."
Whatever he chose to do about his pregnancy, Draco knew the Mediwix would help him. With that, Draco stood. He changed back into the pyjamas he’d abandoned only an hour or so before and slid beneath the cold, wrinkled sheets.
Malfoy turns away from the window and Harry finds a door to the greenhouse and joins Malfoy and Luna for porridge. Harry is surprised to see the table is set for three. There are fewer bowls and pots and things today, though the gold-rimmed teapot and the floral cow creamer are out, and a pot Harry assumes is full of honey. And there's a bowl of porridge still steaming under a warming charm. Or, Harry assumes it's a bowl of porridge, underneath all the toppings—a mound of stewed fruit, shredded coconut, and walnuts all drizzled with cream obscure most of the surface.
Harry very nearly laughs. Weird. That’s exactly how he feels, too. He wishes he’d stayed. He wishes he could see them right now, the way Draco is no doubt holding Harry tight, or cradling his face, or caressing his hair.
"Well maybe not daily."
Malfoy stands at the counter drumming his fingers for a moment.
"Hiya Hagrid."
"Maybe it's Polyjuice," Hermione says, smiling like Malfoy's new behavior isn't deeply disturbing to her.
Draco would have made a disbelieving reply to Ron’s fortune-telling, except that was the moment that their main courses arrived. Their pastas were abundant, buttery, and unquestionably delicious. Harry and he thanked the waiter, ordered a couple of fresh drinks, and set to work eating. Draco was secretly pleased Harry was eating his pasta every bit as heartily as he was; the green-eyed wizard wasn’t even eating for two.
Draco huffed out a breath, won over by Harry’s enthusiasm. “Alright,” he acquiesced, clipping the buckles of his satchel together, and swinging it over his shoulder. “But somewhere small and unassuming! I don’t need to be on the front of the
"The thing is, I don't know. Part of me feels like I can never forgive the things he did. I mean, Ron, he
“You’re tired,” Harry said, breaking the peace that had settled between. “I’m going to go now. We’ve talked about a lot today. You ought to nap for a couple of hours, Draco. Get your strength back.” Standing, Harry
Ron pops his head into the kitchen. "Pizzas are here."
"You're impossible, you know that?"
There was more besides the headline article, and Harry skipped through the pages. Draco breathed out a small sigh of relief. The article could have been so much worse. The rest of the paper was nothing but a rehash of old
Frantically, Draco began to pull them off, frazzled, and stressed that his plans had suddenly gone awry.
s. "This is really good, Malfoy."
"It's Draco now. We kiss so it's Draco."
He didn’t seem to, though. The other wizard got to his feet. He picked up the box of tissues that Draco kept on the sideboard, and then offered it to him. Draco pulled a few from the box, and he gave his face a wipe.
"Let it happen naturally."
Draco heard the cheering of the crowd, and heard Marcus’s rousing victory speech, but all he could think about was Harry Potter.
"Are we not going to talk about it then?"
As always when Harry Potter arrived anywhere there was a moment of awed hush from the other tables, but the unruly-haired wizard seemed to take that in his stride. He walked over to Draco’s table and sat across from him. Draco thought Harry’s hair was a little longer than it’d been during their night together, and it curled a little at the ends where it was still damp from being washed. Merlin, but Harry was an attractive man.
, Draco. It's a much more reliable source of news. Unless of course you're looking for news about Harry's dating, then the
"Yeah because everything's about you. No I just… It's been a while and I don't know what to expect."
"I feel that way sometimes, especially when I'm overwhelmed. Are you overwhelmed?" Luna asks him, with those wide guileless eyes. With anyone else Harry would lie.
"How's the cushy security job, you miss me yet?"
"I'm out of yeast," he says grumpily.
"Fresh fava beans."
Flicking back to the front cover, Draco read the article again. Merlin, but it couldn’t really be clearer.
"Actually—" Harry says, planning to dispute this, but Malfoy talks over him.
Mediwitch Hayes gave him a kindly glance. “Please don’t worry,” she said. “Everybody here is entirely non-judgmental, and we deal with lots of different pregnancies, and lots of different fathers. No two are the same.” She sat back and found Draco’s eyes. “That being said, I do counsel that you at least inform the other father about your condition. It’ll be helpful to have details of his family history and a measure of his magical strength, just so that I can calibrate any potions you need appropriately.”
They’d never been the close confidants that he was with Greg or even Pansy. Their friendship had been mirth and it’d been banter. What Harry and he had since Café Quendryth was a new, imprecise thing, something they were still working the rules out of. Draco liked his odd new afternoons with Harry – liked them lots, actually – but he wasn’t quite sure how to describe what Harry and he were to each other.
They’d been due to watch
Draco listened. Harry’s vehemence was powerful to behold, and he pitied the
"Well?" Ron says, "How was it?"
"Name one thing you like."
There were a few little glances, a few concealed smiles of affection from the elegant ladies and veritable old wizards who enjoyed the establishment. Harry had been correct about his fans. Most of the public had been elated at the idea of Harry and him becoming parents. The number of soft toys and knitted socks that they’d been gifted far outweighed the number of Howlers that the Owl Post-Office had intercepted, and had sent directly back to where they had come from.
A charm set Draco’s hair straight, and he gave himself a practice-smile in the mirror. Good Godric, but he looked dreadful. Truly appalling. There were a couple of spots on his chin - a result, no doubt, of his unhealthy cravings – and his skin was pasty and wan. One look at him, and Harry would be withdrawing his offer of involvement, and backing slowly out of the door. There wasn’t anything he could do about that now.
Conversation around the table began to move on after that. Even if there was anything to be done about the article, now wasn’t the time to worry about it. Hermione regaled the table with tales of her overnight volunteering and the unsurprising incompetence of the Aurors that she’d had dealings with. A couple of registered werewolves had been arrested, even though it was nowhere close to the full moon. “Nothing but out-and-out prejudice,” Hermione uttered, to the agreement of the Weasleys.
. Draco mentally chastised himself. He was talking to himself like a sap and a Hufflepuff. He couldn’t afford to let his guard down, and develop feelings that weren’t reciprocated.
"You're not supposed to wear them with a button up. They don't go."
the magazine and it landed in his hands. “I had the chicken,” he answered, opening the magazine on his lap. “It tasted okay to me. Maybe it was the sautéed potato?”
Judith nodded her head. “Might I ask what it is that you dislike, so that I can inform the owners?”
"Canned black olives?
"Fine," Harry says, losing patience. "I think it's pretty rich that you think
When the waiter comes to take their order Harry has managed to hang on to his shrimp tempura roll but Malfoy has wheedled and cajoled and dared Harry to try the yellowtail hamachi with sliced jalapeño and the soft shell crab roll and a roll with eel and something called masago. All of which, Harry must admit in short order, are quite good, which Harry thinks will make Draco look smug, but actually he just smiles his cinnamon roll smile.
He breaks off several leaves of fresh basil he gathers from a pot on the windowsill into the sauce, and turns to Malfoy with a, “What have we got, then?”
"I wasn't terrible, Snape was a shite teacher."
Draco was quiet for a moment, taking in everything that Harry had said. Despite his contempt for that appalling book, there was definitely something to what Harry was saying. Draco felt his cheeks pinken. He was actually rather impressed with Harry’s handle on the situation. “I’m not sure there’s much to be proud of today,” Draco said, marginally less grouchily. “I don’t have any clothes that fit me. I’ll be attending our hospital appointment half-starkers.”
Draco has made him breakfast. Well, Draco usually makes him breakfast but this feels different. Draco has his back turned to Harry, standing at the counter fixing his coffee which seems to take a very long time today. Harry wonders if he should be saying something and wonders long enough that it begins to feel weird he hasn't spoken yet and Draco won't look at him and he's starting to panic when Draco turns around, coffee held in front of his chest like a talisman.
"He does," Hermione says. She takes a sip of coffee. "I've been doing a bit of reading on restorative justice, things like prison abolition and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa. We're not the first post-war society wondering what to do with a really violent racial or otherwise bigoted history and how to recover. I mean, we live in the foremost colonialist aggressor country in the world. If wizards learned
Tea is not a disaster.
"One must draw the line somewhere. Oh, look at this one. There's a whole section on buckwheat flour."
“Only if we’re late,” Harry said cheerfully, leading Draco up the garden path, and past the much-commented about pig-pen, enclosures full of clucking chickens, and some very well maintained-vegetable patches. “Please don’t worry,” he continued, pausing as they arrived outside the cracked midnight-blue of the Burrow door. “The Weasleys have been my people since I was eleven, but now you and the baby are my family. So, you’re every bit as welcome here as I am.”
With a wave of his wand, Draco magicked any hidden crumbs from his shirt front, and turned his face to Harry. “You still haven’t answered my first question though. Why are you here? I didn’t think you even wanted children.”
After that, Harry moved upwards and began to kiss Draco again. There was an urgency to his lips now, a friction, and Draco felt a hot coil of desire begin to unfold inside of him; felt their magic tangling and twisting and pressing close against his skin.
Narcissa was full of stories too. She’d enjoyed dinner with the Parkinsons, visited the Malfoy Châteaux in France, and worked hard for her sister’s charitable foundation. Draco admired his Mother’s steadfastness. Her work was all anonymous, an act of contrition for her part in the war. Excluding Andromeda, Draco was the only person who knew about it.
"You mean he was angry you thought he'd stoop to do the dishes?" Hermione asks.
Other Harry scoffs. “Don’t even get me started. I’ve known her for long enough to know there’s nothing we can say, but she really needs to rest.”
wrote that it’d been the ‘debut of a generation.’ Draco Malfoy, and the puzzling Muggle virus that had knocked him out of the team warranted a sentence at the bottom of the page.
"We've kissed," Harry blurts out.
Hayes walked Harry and Draco out into the hallway and bade them goodbye. The two of them were quiet, lost in their own thoughts as they made their way to the elevators and down to the ground floor Apothecary.
"Am I supposed to know what that is?"
showed that Harry was due in fifteen minutes, so that meant there was time to do one last run-through of his home, and double check that everything looked spotless.
“I’m about done,” Mr Weasley – Arthur – said, smoothing out the tea-towel, slow and deliberate in his movements. “Shall we have a brew, while we wait for the rest of the gang to return? They’ve all piled into the field across the way; it's charmed with a Notice-Me-Not so the Muggles can’t see the broomsticks. Stick the kettle on.”
"This is a terrible idea," Harry says. Ron and Malfoy look at Harry with similar expressions of defiance on their faces and the absurdity of Ron and Malfoy responding the same way to anything makes Harry feel more than a little hysterical. He laughs weakly. "This is a terrible idea," he tries again. Malfoy puts his hands on his hips. Ron arches an eyebrow.
"I don't know how to answer that."
That was rich, coming from Harry. Draco wanted to explode, and his fingers itched to fling hexes at Harry’s handsome, stupid face. Harry had been the one who had left Half-Moon Place and left Draco humiliated. Harry had been the one to call Draco his mistake.
Draco felt a lump in his throat, and he wiped his eyes with the heel of his hand. He screwed the parchment up, and threw it to the floor in a pitiful gesture.
"Yes. All-righting. It doesn't fix anything. You feel guilty about letting me get cursed, don't you?"
"Who doesn't like lasagna?" Ron asks through a mouth full of raspberry jam sandwich biscuit.
"I just thought—"
Harry and he argued over the merits of musicals for another few minutes, and then Harry repositioned himself, letting his shoulder rest against Draco’s own. Every slim, tiny piece of interest that Draco had invested in the film evaporated, and, as Harry moved his arm so that it rested across the back of the settee, Draco settled into it. Quite honestly, Harry didn’t have any business being quite as comfortable to cuddle as he was – the wizard was all hard lines and muscle – but Draco couldn’t help himself. Draco leant into him, burrowing into Harry’s chest, pleased at how well their bodies fit together.
"You inherited both the Potter and the Black fortune. I cannot understand why you are so preoccupied with the price of everything."
. How did you end up with this hanging on your wall? Why, precisely, has this never come up in conversation?”
Grimmauld seemed to be.
"Be honest, Potter. You're only here because you get paid good money to eat porridge and pretend you're protecting me. You wouldn't come near me otherwise."
“Harry,” he says, and Harry startles and sits very still. “I know what you’re thinking right now. I do, because I was in your position not long ago. Believe it or not, you’re not in a different universe, or timeline, or dimension. Whatever you’ve been trying to convince yourself you’re in is wrong. You can keep giving yourself all kinds of arguments as to why this can’t be real, but all you are is a good few years into the future.”
"So what's the problem?"
“Mr Malfoy,” the elf explained, “we are very sad but there is bad news. Miffy is regretful, but the Anjelica roots needed to brew the potion have not been dried for the requisite four hours. We are grievously embarrassed. If it pleases sir, we have taken the liberty of asking our colleagues at Frobisher’s Apothecary to make up the potion. They will bring it over by Floo the very moment it is completed, and sir will, of course, not be charged.”
“I’m not here to tell you what your future is going to be like. I’m not here to tell you what you’re doing wrong. Life hasn’t been what you’d call ordinary for m— for you.
"Just tell me to take off my trousers, Malfoy."
"Leave me and my toast alone," Harry says but he lets Malfoy tug him into an alleyway and Apparate them to a bakery off the side of Diagon Alley.
That hadn’t been the answer Draco had expected. Truth was, Draco felt shamefaced about the way that he’d treated Harry’s friends back when they’d all been Hogwarts students, and he often tried to swerve the conversation away whenever the subject of them came up. His bullying, arsehole behaviour had been a combination of low self-esteem, parroting his father’s vile opinions and a crippling jealousy of the Gryffindor trio’s close friendship.
pregnant, after all – when a small witch ambled over to where he was sat, and slid in the chair beside him. Her hair was Weasley-red, but it had a bright glow to it and her eyes were sky-blue. Whomever she was, there was an unmistakable Veela inheritance.
“You're genuinely sure that you’re ready for this?” Harry asked, looking at first at Draco for conformation and then up at the rickety, tumble-down form of the Burrow stood before them. “We don’t have to do this now. We don’t have to do anything that you’re not ready for.
But he also wants Neville to get his apology. To get the recognition of all the hurt Malfoy caused him. Can't Malfoy feel badly about the things he's done without… feeling bad?
"We kissed only yesterday. I don't suppose we could simply enjoy ourselves for a bit before bringing up our soul crushing war time regrets, hmm?" Malfoy asks, taking Harry's hands and putting them around his waist. "We could, for example, kiss more. There could be a lot more kissing."
The fluster and panic dissipated from Harry’s face and Draco sighed. Of course, the wand was nowhere to be seen. “I ran as soon as I heard you shout,” Harry admitted. “You sounded so upset that I just made for the stairs. What is it, Draco? A broken fastener? A lost button? Let me fix it.” Draco felt his heart sink as Harry took out his own wand, looking appallingly hopeful. “I’m a dab hand at Tailoring Charms,” Harry coaxed. Merlin, but why was he cursed with such a do-gooder for a co-parent? There wasn't any keeping secrets from Harry Potter.
Harry did what he was told, and Draco arranged the sandwiches on the plates, adding salad for garnish. He
“I didn’t think that’d be so emotional,” Harry said, as soon as they stood outside of St Mungo’s. They’d both been given little images of their
Draco will most certainly not be making Harry Potter breakfast.
He watches Other Harry fall asleep on Malfoy's chest, turn around, Malfoy’s arm reaching for him, body wrapping around his, both falling asleep again, then both turning on their back, one leg over the other’s thigh —
At that, new noise filled the room. It was a fast little pulsing; a steady whoosh-whoosh-whoosh that echoed subtly around them. Hearing it, Draco felt a small part of his stoic nature crumble forever into dust.
They're in the kitchen, like always. The rest of the Manor isn't barren and echoey like before, the fancy little end tables Harry expected are back in the hallways sporting flower arrangements Malfoy must have owled in every few days. But still they sit in the kitchen.
Draco definitely,
"Isn't it always," Ron says, bringing plates over. "Speaking of, who eats take out on real plates? The whole point is eating out of the container."
With that, he began rocking his hips, tiny movements that pushed a little deeper with each thrust. He ran his hand down the inside of Draco’s thigh, gently pushing his leg up, and the new position eased Draco into enjoying the stretch and the sudden, brilliant fullness.
And here's Luna, wearing three flowy skirts layered over each other, skipping through the grounds of the house where she was held prisoner. It's all so bizarre.
Draco bit back a half-smile at that. He remembered his passionate, heartbroken tears when Father had told him, aged six, of his decided bond with Astoria Greengrass. He’d sobbed, and begged to be allowed to bond with playmate Blaise Zabini instead, so the two of them could have sleepovers every night, and play on their broomsticks. Father hadn’t understood Draco then, and he expected that Lucius would have been even more appalled now.
"I'm lost," Harry says.
Professor Binns—"
"Did you change your mind then?"
“Hermione was overjoyed,” Harry said, finding Draco’s eyes. “She said that she thought that a baby would be the making of me.” Sitting back in his chair, Harry elaborated. “’Mione knows that I’ve always wanted a family – wanted kids of my own – but after the accident I stopped dating. She said that she’d gotten a little bit concerned that it wasn’t going to happen for me… I mean, she told me off for not carrying my own condoms, but that’s Hemione. She always needs to find something to moan at me about. Anyway, long story short, Hermione said she was pleased for me. Says she thinks I’ll be an awesome dad.” He quirked a smile in Draco’s direction. “And yeah. That meant a lot. Even when I was eleven, I respected her opinion more than any of the adults I knew.”
"It's alright."
"My apologies, next time I'll ask the cow for uglier packaging to suit your tastes."
"You just have a history of making people cry with a snog."
paparazzi hanging back, pretending to look at the window display of Madam Primpernelle’s Beautifying Potions. He stepped beside Harry, feeling suddenly vulnerable.
"You're alright, Malfoy."
Because while blood does flow south at the eyeful that is a fully naked Draco Malfoy, Harry’s pulse quickens at the soft gazes between the two men in the bath. The way they look at each other, full of affection, hands linking between them.
Ron shrugs. "Yeah, me and Hermione
“You should go to sleep,” Harry said, nonchalant as anything. It was hard to believe they’d just shared the best kiss of Draco’s whole life. “You need your rest, because we’ve got a big day tomorrow, Draco. We’re looking at houses, remember? I’ll Floo in at half-ten and pick you up.”
"Why would you think—" Harry has to stop. He doesn't actually know why he's so angry. Maybe it's the presumption, like of course Harry would like a
"I read cookbooks. It's in my Italian cookbook."
At some point Harry starts noticing that the cinnamon rolls are delicious.
"Shut up," Harry says, but his voice just sounds scratchy and pathetic.
"Whichever one has frosting," Harry contributes.
"I never would have thought you'd be so snuggly," Malfoy says. "You always seemed so tense and angry."
His black tee-shirt, printed with the Sleekeazy hair potion logo, was snug over his muscles, and he appeared to be wearing brand-new jeans. Even Harry’s hair was considerably less of a bird’s nest than it usually appeared.
Draco expected the next words out of Harry’s mouth to be a tease about him believing old witch’s stories; perhaps an impression of Trelawny or even a sly suggestion that they read their tea leaves, and discover where Puddlemere would finish next season. Instead, Harry’s fingers brushed over the skin of Draco’s forearm, gentle as feathers, and he spoke his reply with a soft voice. “It is.”
Draco sniffed. He’d thought he’d been so shrewd, but his mother had read him as effortlessly as a first-year spell. “And you’re not upset?” he asked, cautiously. He watched as his mother picked up her glass and took a small, deliberate sip. She was obviously thinking; working out precisely how to phrase her answer.
Harry's work days are much quieter than he's become accustomed to in the last year. He thinks he'd feel twitchy and bored if he wasn't so tired. Malfoy spends most of the week writing on a stack of documents at the kitchen table which leaves Harry to his own devices. He sits in the hallway with a paperback he doesn't have the energy to open and quite frequently naps. Which is why he's surprised when he finds Malfoy in the kitchen on Friday looking harried and chopping chives at a speed that would worry Harry if Harry cared about Malfoy chopping off his fingers.
Malfoy is wearing black boxer briefs when he gets out of bed and makes for the bathroom, and if Harry’s pulse quickens at the expanse of exposed skin, no one needs to know. He would never know how to explain it, if someone asked him, but Draco Malfoy is unexpectedly beautiful in the way he speaks, moves, and carries himself.
“And I know Grimmauld’s a bit ramshackle, and quirky and no, it isn’t beside the sea, but I think we could be happy here, Draco.” Harry said, taking his hand from Draco and gesturing around them. “I don’t want our baby to have two homes and two separate lives. I want our baby to lay down, each night, knowing that the two people who love her the most in the world are safely within these four walls. You and the baby, you’re my family. And I want us to be together. I know Grimmauld isn’t modern or magnificent, but I think we could make it something really special. Last night, I asked you to give me a chance, Draco. Move in here, with me. This is a home for a family. Let me give you and the baby the happy life you deserve.”
“I think Tom is right. We need to speak to the goblins, see if there is anything they can do to stop the ministry from getting their hands on Harry.” Cissa said, trying to get both men to focus on something else. “It’s going to be a few days until he wakes up, Sev why don’t you start stocking up on the potions. Tom, why don’t you firecall the goblins and set up an appointment with them. Then after dinner, we will rebreak the bones, and we should be all set for a few days.” Cissa said, giving them the direction of things to do for a while.

“Cissa, I wish they would have suffered more, but unfortunately, we had to be quick due to Harry’s injuries,” Severus said, wishing he could have tortured those muggles more for what they did to Harry.
“No, Harry, you aren’t in trouble; we saved you from your relatives, don’t you remember?” Severus asked, hoping there was not a lot of memory loss.
As he was walking back, he listened to the lions conversation. “Do you believe what Harry said?” Hermione asked Ron sounding worried that she had gotten everything so wrong. “From what I’ve seen about this Harry is that he doesn’t lie.” Ron said sounding upset that something wasn’t going his way. “You think Dumbledore is wrong? That Harry is being bewitched and held against his will?” Hermione asked sounding shocked that something like that could even happen. “Hermione, you saw the imperious curse, it didn’t work on him. If he was really bewitched that spell would have made his eyes glaze over.” Ron said sounding defeated that their Headmaster was wrong about something.
He wonders if she’s okay.
“I know it-”
He’s not entirely sure he honestly expected gifts from the family before him.
Kingsley pauses. “You are?”
----------
Draco was here with his father is a complete mystery that Harry kinda needs to know the answer to. Especially when said evil father is casually chatting with the Minister of Magic himself. It’s to make sure he’s safe! Not because something about how Draco looks at Cedric rubs him the wrong way.
Somehow he doesn’t think that’ll go over well either.
Harry steps closer to him, “He doesn’t, sir. If he had his wand, he would’ve taken Draco away the second those masked men started doing...whatever the hell they were doing.”
“Your life is worth nothing.” Potter spits and Draco almost drops LuLu then and there. The boy has his wand out and pointed down the bridge of Pettigrew’s nose. He’s never seen so much hatred in those green eyes.
He can’t get it out of his mind. The blood, the screaming, the

Draco nods. “Thank you, for standing up for me, Crabbe and Goyle usually just stand there.”
Curse his sweet tooth. Curse it right into the ground.
“Headmaster-” he begins as soon as he steps foot in the office, a mistake really, given that Dumbledore is holding a paper with a grave look that stops him in his tracks.
Draco’s beside him with a gasp before he can react further, hand digging into his arm almost more painful than the pressure already there.
“I think he is? I’m not really sure, actually. Slytherins are good liars, and while I’ve always been able to tell, he did give himself a loophole.”
“Naturally.”
just let me tell them.”
As of right now, Pansy is currently running her own clothing line, with fashion shows all over the world, using the Parkinson fortune for what she considers to be ‘good’.

decide to share. For when this whole agreement blows up in his face.
Maybe Draco should’ve threatened to kill him if he jeopardized his safety last night. Maybe that would’ve kept The Idiot Who Keeps Trying To Die from walking forward and staring directly into the creature’s, Buckbeak, eyes. He glares at the animal like he was daring it to hurt Potter, and then the stupid thing bows and Hagrid is bellowing “Good Job!”
“Occa-who?”
Narcissa seems displeased by this fact. “Well, I guess it won’t be hard to remember.”
His heart beat picks up. Sirius Black maybe?  He couldn’t have gotten in the school though. There was no way for him to sneak in unnoticed. It was impossible…..besides he wasn’t the man’s target….either way the suspense is starting to irritate him so he snatches his wand and whirls around, pointing it into nothingness.
Sirius smiles, Remus pats his shoulders.
The man looks over at Harry and softens. “I couldn’t take my eyes off you at first. You look so much like James….I nearly cried until I saw the kid next to you. I’ve seen Peter’s rat form so many times I knew it was him even in black and white. At first I thought I was dreaming, but he was missing a toe and I just knew that little bastard was up to no good, probably waiting for Voldemort-” Draco flinches at the name- “to rise again so he could hand you over and finish what he started all those years ago. I couldn’t let that happen so one night, when they came with food, I transformed and was skinny enough to sneak through the bars. Then I swam away from that bloody island and came here to try and keep that fucker from getting too close. I almost convinced this Crookshanks fellow to help me, but he was worried about upsetting his owner.”

The first, what we know as rivers and lakes, is known as Ertt Vāṭṭar. The second, while most commonly known as Mother Ocean, is called Yathārt'tha Veḷḷaṁ. Okay? You with me?”
Draco raises an eyebrow. “I didn’t know there was a
Only, Harry sits straight up on the same couch he fell asleep on. In the same room with the same furniture, the same pictures of Remus and Sirius on the walls, the same carpet, so many things to indicate that he never left.
Hermione’s pissed off at
“We brought him back.” Is the dignified response.
“Why are you home so late? It’s nearly eight.”
“I can explain-”
At least Pansy and Blaise had drug him to a secluded corner before screaming at him. Pansy gently trailed the few visible bruises on his face while her companion looked on with a worry he's only seen from his mother.
Draco rolls to his side, close enough for Harry to kiss if he wants to. “Hi.”
Harry finally reaches him and grabs him by his shoulder, dear Merlin he can feel the other’s cold body through his gloves. He quickly shucks off his coat and throws it on the thin shoulders, lifting Malfoy’s face towards him, inspecting the right black eye.
Draco: something is wrong.
“Did Mr. Malfoy-”
“Hey Harry!” he grins, Draco swallows down a sudden bout of jealousy he has no idea existed, “Did you hear? Apparently Sirius Black has been spotted!”
(See the end of the chapter for

like being in danger, but I saw a name on the map that struck me as odd because the map doesn’t lie, but the person in question is known to be dead.”
“On the plus side, in the one before this only the headmasters were injured.”
Draco closes his eyes, reaching to undo whatever had been done to his team, but then Flint starts to chuckle.
They go in, Sisily makes tea, Draco takes his place on the couch between his friends, LuLu protectively in his lap. Narcissa sits opposite to them. No one speaks for the longest time, he has this unshakable urge to reach out and hug her again, to sit next to her, or in her lap like he did when he was little. Just to be close.

“Oh absolutely not. We’re adding that to the Tomorrow list! I’ve used up too much magic today and this wand isn’t quite used to me yet, so something that big is going to have to wait.”

“Alright!” Draco shouts, hoping to everything that Theo wasn’t planning on telling Misty about the time he got so sleep deprived he wore Pansy’s skirt for an entire hour. “That’s enough! Didn’t you come here for business?”

No, Riddle made the mistake of coming after what Draco considers important.
Harry doesn’t know what the fuck to say to that, but Helga- no, Auksas, is already turning her back to him and making her way to her nest.
Narcissa turns on her heel to give Lucius the full force of her anger. Nothing betrays her until she speaks and the glass candle on the mantle behind his father shatters from her rage.
“Oh you’re hardly one to talk. Didn’t you sneak out in a school wide lock-down to kill a thousand year old deadly beast last year?”
So that’s why Potter has been so insistent about coming back, bloody git has someone special. Bloody annoying. “Potter you’ve got yourself a
“Guess that’s it then.”
“Professor, this is probably about the worst thing that could’ve happened.”
The light fixtures he wasn’t too sure on. Back at the Manor it was all chandeliers and wall sconces, but looking at those makes Draco feel like he’s going to puke, so he ends up getting three circular, copper, hanging pendant lights.

It’s spewing out of his mouth before he can stop it.
Because he is stupid and forgot that while Harry fucking Potter lacks most, if not all, common sense, he had left him with Ron fucking Weasley, the most ignorant and air-headed wizard of their time.
“Draco.”
There’s a world of possibilities.
When he looks out, his brain quiets. The noise that silence brings fades away into a soothing push and pull.

Draco, trying to hate Lavender: Fuck! She's nice!
Blaise had accidentally pushed him out of a tree, and he’d been so angry about it that he set the tree on fire. Subsequently, Belle didn’t bat an eyelash, and that’s exactly how his mother and his best friend’s mother became so close.
“A Goblin Friend?” Misty gives him an awed sort of look. It makes Draco uncomfortable. “Mister Draco, you really are amazing.”
“That was extremely reckless and I am very happy you’re safe. If you ever tell anyone that I hugged you I will hex you into next year.”
Harry is here? What the fuck? Who let him in?
----------

Fleur laughs through her tears, and then pulls back with shaky hands.
Well, Draco understands why. The last time he left his father’s health in his mother’s hands she killed him. Not for long, of course, and she
“If you die I will ground you! Do you understand me?!
“Sir,” he begins rather nicely, fulling intending to weasel his way out of the class entirely,  “I’m afraid I can’t cut correctly because of-“
Draco flinches back without meaning to. Of course he knows that, he’d been under two of them, he’d seen what mind control curses can do to people, his father is still recovering and Draco seriously doubts that he’ll ever get over it. The first time he hurt his Torture Pixie was when he was under Impero, and the only reason he didn’t fight harder was because of the Crucius Hour he endured beforehand.
Draco snorts beside his friend, quickly taking a seat before Pansy can react. She takes his hand, glaring at Blaise as he sits beside her. They don’t bother fussing at LuLu for hopping onto her own chair.
He’s so irritated he doesn’t even notice the baby Weasley until she’s glaring right back at him. “-he didn’t want any of that.”

Harry moves to get it, but Aunt Petunia stops him.

Snape catches on uncomfortably quick. “You’re worried about Granger.”

it hurts. Draco flinches back instinctively, clutching the wound to his chest.
Harry was the first to leave, something Draco’s dying to check on. He tried calling on the ‘cell phone’ Hermione made them all, but the witch in question had shaken her head and told him to let Harry be so he had. As much as it makes him slightly jealous, Hermione and Ron do know his boyfriend best, so if they say to give him space Draco will….for now at least.
Draco makes a noise somewhere between a choke and a laugh. “Draco, huh? You do realize Weasley is going to have a heart attack when he hears me calling you Hermione.”
Narcissa’s face, the one he’s only seen in photographs, pops up into the fire with a smile. “Hello, darling. And Mister Potter, it is a pleasure to meet you, though I do wish it was under better circumstances.”
is?!”
Sirius Black had been the one to lead Voldemort straight to their house, straight to the baby on the second floor. Sirius Black had been so close to getting rid of them, even killed his friend Peter Pettigrew, another one of Voldemort’s favorites. And if Black was back now, that could only mean one thing.
His shopkeepers are
He tries not to smile.
“More secrets, I presume?” Draco draws in his most seething voice yet.
“I is being Misty.” Misty says, bowing a little but not leaving Draco’s side. “Are you being a friend to Mister Draco?”
Harry levitates the cast iron table out the open French doors and Malfoy sets the postage stamp sized kitchen table down on the floor and stands back while Harry enlarges it. Malfoy is positively beaming when Harry lowers his wand, the table back to full size and nestled perfectly in the nook of windows opposite the stove top and counter. It's on the small side, not like the giant dining tables set in other rooms. The top is laid with tiles of various colored flowers, each with a little border, no two tiles alike. It's perfect in Malfoy's gold and green kitchen. Malfoy steps forward and runs his hand over the surface, his happiness so unadulterated. Harry watches him trace the flowers with his slender fingers until he can't bear it anymore.
"'Arry," Hagrid booms merrily. "Good ter see you, lad."
Ending his pregnancy meant that he wouldn’t have to tell his mum either. Narcissa Malfoy wouldn't ever say a word of criticism aloud, but Draco knew there'd be a secret place inside her that was devastated to know he was considering ending the pregnancy.
"Yes but I'll know. I'll lie awake at night thinking about how the Savior is so modest and self-sacrificing that he bought himself the ugliest plainest white plates to match his boring pure white soul."
“You deserve nothing less,” Mother said, apparently satisfied by his answer. “Lucius, for all his faults, was attentive to a fault. Of course, he’d bonded with me only understanding that I’d beget him an heir. Even so, I cannot believe that all his small kindnesses were a falsehood.” Taking out her wand, Narcissa twirled it between the pair of them, and with a small sparkle of magic, their plates of Beef Wellington were returned to perfection. “Now, I’m going to have Adrianne go and live with you,” Mother continued, taking up her knife and fork, “and I won’t brook any disagreement. If you must insist in living away from your ancestral home then I will, at least, ensure you have help that befits your situation. Now please, eat,” she insisted, pointing down at Draco’s plate. “You must be famished, and I won’t have my granddaughter fed on nothing but croissants.”
When Harry wakes up again the sun is high up in the sky. The wristwatch — which Harry recognises as The Prewett watch he still wears — on the bedside table tells him it’s nearly three o’clock. He’s slept nearly eight hours and lost most of his free time to explore. He’s tempted by a shower, but he can go without. He strips down, lays his clothes flat on the lovely patterned rug and casts laundry charms on each item until they smell clean and look properly ironed. He throws a Scourgify on himself, which he really, really hates resorting to but he doesn’t cringe or recoil at it anymore after too many stakeouts, not to mention his War days.
“Oh yes,” Harry answered, and then he was kissing Draco once more, deep and slow, walking Draco over the carpet to his bed. The backs of Draco’s knees hit the bed, and he dropped down onto the plushy covers. Shaking his head, Harry surveyed the scene. “All these pillows. They a pure-blood thing, or a Draco thing?”
, Goyle!” Draco managed. “The Mediwix doesn’t need to know your life story.”
Harry looks up from peeling the label on his butterbeer to meet the looks on his friends' faces, knowing they're all thinking of everything they've been through, all the grief and terror, and he quietly agrees that yeah, a lot can happen in a year.
“Oh, yes,” Harry agreed, nuzzling the sensitive spot beneath Draco’s ear. “You’re right. The chicken smells good too.”
Other Harry grins in response, which only confuses Harry further.
"This may be hard for you to believe, but this isn't about you and what you think of me."
Malfoy, mercifully, keeps his mouth shut at this statement from Ron and Harry thinks maybe they'll all get out of this relatively unscathed for once.
"What, like ever? You can't promise that."
"I would've thought you'd make more fancy French food. Coq au vin and boeuf bourguignon and stuff like that."
"You'll see," Malfoy says, taking a jar off the shelf filled with gray powder.
"One crier counts for five," Ron says as Hermione walks in the front door, coming home from the Hogwarts library. "Hermione! Guess what? Harry kissed Malfoy again!"
And, sure enough, she did, almost straight away. Draco felt the
"And you had the idea to bring them here."
Narcissa rose from her seat as Draco entered, and he greeted her with a kiss to the cheek as was his custom. Draco felt the warmth of her magic and love as she took his hand in her own. Mother had flourished in the years since the war, and looked more youthful than her forty-nine years.
Harry puts his hands on Malfoy's ribs, feeling the tender spot just beneath and leans up to kiss him. The kiss starts as a gentle press of lips. As soon as their lips touch Harry doesn't feel awkward anymore, he feels like he wants to nibble on Malfoy's bottom lip. So he does just that while Malfoy's hands do wonderful things in Harry's hair, scratching and softly tugging. They press closer together, Harry can feel Malfoy's chest against his own, but the kiss stays soft. Malfoy pulls back sometimes and Harry can feel him smile against his lips before kissing him again and again, their lips clinging to one another.
Petrol jumps up onto him, curling up on his lap. Harry has no idea what the next few years will bring him, despite knowing it somehow ends here, but his chest warms up at the idea of seeing Petrol again. “I’m looking forward to meeting you in the future,” he tells the cat, and pets her soft fur until she’s purring.
"Have I told you how my mother died?" she asks him.
Harry buries his head in his hands. "Why are you torturing me? Isn't it bad enough I kissed Malfoy without you two talking about tongues?"
"I told you, if it wasn't at Hogwarts odds are I've never had it."
Draco almost felt like he was intruding. Such ostentatious displays hadn’t been customary when he was growing up. His own childhood had been quiet and subdued: Lucius’s opinions on child rearing hadn’t strayed very far from the idea of children being seen and not heard. Indeed, even the seeing part had been somewhat rare until Draco was old enough to be amusing. Before that, most of Draco’s time had been spent in the company of his elf-nanny, and his Governess. That definitely wasn’t what he wanted for his own little one. Draco wanted to be a hands-on dad; tucking in his child when they went to bed, teaching them to read himself, and making sure that they never, even for a moment, felt like they were surplus to requirements.
Harry tries to sleep. He really does, for a whole hour even. At four in the morning he gives up, grabs his invisibility cloak and Floos to the Manor. His steps echo throughout the cold, empty Manor as he makes his way to Malfoy's rooms. He digs through Malfoy's magically expanded armoire to find clean pants and another pair of pajamas for him. Then he goes downstairs to make sure Yip has food and water. Yip simply lifts his head up from his bed and then flops down again when he sees it's Harry.
"Well don't let me interfere, Potter. Now show me the bedroom I worked so hard on."
That was a statement, not a question, and Draco nodded his assent.
my name and never seen me again, that I’d do the same to you? Oh, my darling, darling boy. This is why you’ve not been home, isn’t it? You thought I’d reject your child? Reject my own flesh and blood? Draco, she’ll be my light that brightens my life. Surely you think me capable of more than such baseless prejudice?” Pausing, Narcissa dabbed once at the corner of her eyes with a handkerchief. Draco was astonished. Mother never, ever shed tears. “You’ve always been cut from a different cloth to Lucius and I, Draco. Even when you were young it was clear that an arranged bond with a suitable witch wouldn’t be to your liking.”
"It's Bill, not 'Mr. Weasley', don't be weird."
He didn’t want to be the one to make a first move though, not here, not in their child’s bedroom, in Grimmauld Place. For a moment Harry looked like he was about to lean in and close the space between them, but all he did was take the toy from Draco’s hand. Harry placed it back on the shelf, and Draco let out a breath, too loud, and far too disappointed.
