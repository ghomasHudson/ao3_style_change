Hearing Pansy arrive Draco downed the rest of his coffee and returned to cleaning the breakfast items.
Draco spotted him looking around and sighed “Don’t even ask.” He said. Lowering coffee to the table before running a hand through his hair, slinking backwards in the chair.
Harry took the letter and checked it over, before performing a quick Geminio spell. The letters copied themselves out, ready till in the names and addresses.
Malfoy tilted his head, the corner of his lip moving. “So I was right.” he smiled watching as Harry huffed in annoyance.
Draco was still stood against the wall, debating a reply when Pansy arrived with the first issue of the night. He shoved his phone into his pocket. Not getting another chance to check his phone till he got home.
"Getting Nagini out of your bed, so you can get out my bed, and I can get into mine and sleep." He stated, choosing the high road and ignoring that stupid nickname.
Harry thought he heard Draco huff, but he wasn’t sure. After a while, Draco lent back so their faces were on the same level. Harry only realised Draco was stood in between his legs when the other placed his hands on either side of Harry’s thighs. His face with the unreadable expression once more. Harry wanted to wipe the look straight off his face. Dropping his eyes to Draco’s lips as he caught Draco doing the same.
“I am sorry about Teddy. He’s upset about the others being away. It’s going to break his heart when we move out.” Harry blurted out.
“Okay, you need to get some shoes on, come on,” Draco interrupted, picking Scorpius up and shifting him from the chair to the floor.
Grieg laughed, “Look, my point is we’ve been friends since school, I wouldn’t have survived school or graduated or even got married if I hadn’t been for you. So I’ll support you. If you ever wanna talk, bitch about stupid Potter that you love so much, you know where I am.”
“Quite a few I’d imagine.” Harry tried to count them, however, got confused as he went. There were a lot of kids.
“There has to be another way to break the spell, without that!” He stated, completely ignored by the other two. He could feel his eyes going wide as saucers.
“Duly noted,” Draco nodded, as he started to rub his arm.  “I just meant, what would you know, Potter, about being defenceless?”
Swallowing down his reply, Harry continued to climb into his bed, turning his back to Draco. He took a deep breath, ‘just pretend this was normal Wednesday behaviour' he thought. He could sleep with Draco in the same bed. Surprisingly, sleep came easily that night.
Pansy sighed, taking a deep breath, “Let’s start from the beginning, how do you know Draco is coming Christmas day?”
“Bonsoir Famille Potter,” A little voice called from the sitting room. Dropping his blanket, Albus raced out to greet the guests and direct them into the living room.
“Fool me once.” Draco warned, shaking his head. He’d already organised their wedding, a reminder of why he never organised weddings, and their baby shower, again another reminder why he’d never do that again.
"Students have started school so it's autumn.” Draco shrugged, picking an invisible stitch on his bedding, as Harry continued cleaning.
Draco looked down at the cup “Thank you.” He muttered. Then made some space at the deck for Harry to sit down at. The pair sat in silence, sipping their drinks until they made eye contact.
Greg laughed, shaking his head, “Well if you ever wanna help a mate out, you know where to find me. So where is Harry? Didn’t he join ya?” Greg looked around.
Malfoy sat back in his chair frowning, “It’s still nice to receive a formal invite.” He counter-argued, tilting his head.
Harry felt his face fall, Malfoy had to be joking. He watched the other, waiting for the other to crack. He didn’t. “You’re joking, right? She’s a daemon in human form,” Harry settled on asking.
“Right, I’ve got to go! I need to find Luna and stand next to her before she gets hit and has to kiss someone else!” Nevile called as he was jogging backwards. Leaving the pair once more in silence as they watched his retreating back.
“Ew, married people vibes,” Pansy hissed. Lifting her fingers into a small cross shape, hoping to propel the very thoughts and idea away from herself.
“I want to whistle like Albus!” Scorpius pointed to the offending boy who looked happy as Larry at the fact he could now whistle.
“That kind of stuff doesn’t exist,” Draco rolls his eyes and finally stands up, brushing dirt off his trousers. They were from a charity shop a few blocks away and were incredibly soft, if a bit raggedy.
The idea that Draco is rivals with the Golden Trio is thus successfully established into their DADA professor’s head along with the rest of the student body. The students who were never close to them, who always watched from the sidelines and gossiped later, were convinced Draco and the Golden Trio were once again, truly, at each other’s throats.
These fights are planned far, far in advance. They’re like a play or a dance, rehearsed lines and carefully picked spells. They determine which ones are okay to get hit by, which they will block, and which will “luckily” miss their mark.
“I can man that one,” Draco offers, moving to grab his own cloak, and Harry looks like he’s going to argue.
“Hey, there’s an idea!” Harry says excitedly, not hiding at all the fact he was trying to cheer Draco up. The idea really is a good one, though, and so Harry and Draco set up a table beside one of the windows in the common room and balance all of the BSL books Draco currently has towards the underwater view. They open them up to a chart of the alphabet, a few greetings, and some basic conversational phrases.
There is a nudge at his hand and he tilts his head sideways in question, expecting… well, he isn’t sure what he’s expecting, but it certainly isn’t just empty, open air. Had he really felt something? Or was he imagining things?
Even still… Draco doesn’t like how much they have to sneak around, hates that this is a requirement for them just to stay happy and in control of any part of this hellish year, but he’s glad to at least have this. For just a little while, it can feel like everything is alright and he doesn’t have to be suspicious of every other person he comes across.
“Three,” Krum holds up three fingers as he says it, “Ve use the first two for most schooling. Third is advanced.”
Draco rolls his eyes at his cousin’s antics. “Idiot,” he mumbles and the beetle on his shoulder buzzes its wings in agreement. “Come now. People are waiting for me. It’s time to get this plan into action.”
Draco zeroes in on the one child out of many that looks to be about his age and walks over. “Good evening,” he greets with a nod to the boy, who looks bored out of his mind. His robes are raggedy and look frayed at the edges. “My name is Draco,” he does not use his family name. Max hadn’t told Draco their family name when they’d first met and that had seemed to work.
“I’m curious about something too,” Eve says with a pointed look at Draco, leaning forward against the table, and Draco arches a brow at her in confusion.
“Oh, you mean like that family you’re always complaining about? The Weasels, or whatever their name is?”
“Come along,” the witch suddenly sounded firm, hands clasped in front of her and shoulders straight, “Let us be off. We have a lot to get to today.” She was walking past Draco briskly and he scurries to catch up, startled by her abruptness.
“Oh! Boy wonder has jokes today!” Draco throws his head back and claps a few times, “Could you let me know, though, when you actually come up with a funny one?”
Eventually Eve has to leave, and Draco and Potter are left to their own devices. There is a moment of awkward silence as the two boys just stand beside each other, their guide gone, and in completely foreign territory.
Studying for OWLs is by far the most exhausting thing Draco has done in his academic career so far. The teachers already pile on extra review work for the upcoming exams, but Draco has always been very intense when it came to his schoolwork.
“Someone’s got to,” he says cheerfully and Harry makes an affronted noise while Hagrid lets out a boom of laughter.
Potter’s cheeks clearly redden at the compliments, but he offers them both a small smile. “Thanks. I’m just glad this is helping anyone,” he replies after a beat, then they all go back to their work.
“No room,” Draco immediately says, almost on instinct, and Potter rolls his eyes and shoves his way in anyway.
When he tries to talk to Hermione about it that evening, however, she wants nothing to do with him, still upset about what he had done the previous night. It seems their exciting Potions class wasn’t quite enough to put her into a good mood with him, so he leaves her be and lets her sort out her grievances. There’s no point in pushing her, he knew that, just as there was never any point in pushing him. They both needed time to manage their negative moods when they got to be too much. They were truly birds of a feather…
“What do you mean?” Weasley questions suspiciously, leaning back like he expects Draco to say something so insulting it might cause him physical harm. If only…
“Don’t you have to head down to the pitch soon?” Draco questions one Thursday afternoon in late May. He and Potter sit in the Astronomy Tower, back to back on the floor, some homework spread out around them, and the radio sitting on the floor beside them.
“His true name… is Voldemort.” She says it with such severity, such intensity, that Draco feels like he is supposed to feel something about it, but he doesn’t. It just sounds like another made up word, like Muggle. “He had followers known as DeathEaters,” she continues and, okay, that at least sounded a bit more threatening, “And your parents were part of them.”
From where Draco is standing, he can see a jungle within, miles and miles of it, with clouds and a blue sky above. There’s also a blast of humid air that smacks him in the face a moment later, but he isn’t paying it all that much mind, as impressive as it might be.
“It is not fair,” McGonagall agrees, gives his shoulder a final squeeze, then stands straight and composes herself, “But lingering on it will do us no good. Come. We will stop by Gringotts first.”
Finally, with that done, Mr. Davis looks up, adjusts his monocle, and blinks his big, blank eyes at Draco. “Hello,” he says, his voice as haunting as ever. He really was Tracey’s father… “Mr. Malfoy… Tracey talks about you.”
Flint manages to surprise Johnson, however, taking a nasty swipe at the back of her broom, and she tosses the Quaffle to Spinnet. It is then that Draco flies past the other players, seemingly appearing out of nowhere, and snatches the Quaffle from Spinnet before she can get a proper grip on the ball. His opposing Chaser squawks indignantly, looking furious, but Draco is already curving around the edge of the field and making his way to the goal posts.
“No! Definitely not!” Potter immediately jumps to the defense of his school, looking back at Krum to make sure he understands, before turning back to Draco and grips his shoulder a little tighter. “You need to tell someone. Your Head of House - wait, no, that’s Snape, scratch that - Professor McGonagall, then. Dumbledore, even!”
Draco and Harry stay, sitting and speaking with Hermione and Weasley over small things, big things, and everything in the middle. Draco would rather go for food and a shower like the others had, but he really doesn’t want to leave Harry alone. After everything the night prior he doesn’t want to let the Gryffindor out of his sight, like Harry will disappear if he does.
“You do realize it is my job to save you? Prince Charming and all that,” Draco hums, but the joke falls flat. Harry is quiet for too long, Draco’s shoulder growing wetter and wetter.
“How about we set up a place for you guys to sleep? And some spare pajamas,” he says, smile tight, and Draco nods his thanks. Hermione huffs again, but bids them all good night before slipping out and heading back to her own dorm. She does pause to give Draco and Harry a concerned once over, however, and that at least makes the blonde boy feel a bit more at ease.
“You aren’t a burden to me,” Harry whispers, pressing closer. “Everyone is hurting after what happened, including you, but you think you have to be strong for everyone else. I get that…” Of course Harry gets it. The boy is constantly acting strong to try and assure his friends. “But I can always trust you when I need to fall apart a little bit, right?”
“The Gameskeeper…” Draco’s voice begins confidently, but then abruptly fades into embarrassment, “Uh… caught me taking photographs of his dog…”
They stand like that for a while longer, just staring at each other, until Zacharias Smith is yelling at them, “Hey! You two gonna kiss or are we getting started anytime soon?!”
“I own the place now,” Sirius says, looking up at the tall, imposing ceiling. “Might as well make it feel loved… for once.”
“Doing what’s right? How is going against your families right? How is spitting on everything they’ve done for you okay?” Joshua, because apparently that’s his name, fires back and Draco snarls.
“We need practical teaching for our O.W.L.s, though!” Granger says sharply, looking horrified, before she very suddenly sobers and eyes Draco meaningfully. “That’s not what she’s worried about, though.”
“What are they, by the way?” Potter asks and Draco looks at him, confused, unsure where the question had cropped up from. “Max, I mean. I can’t really tell and I’ve been nervous to ask.”
“We must check all the doors until we find the one we want,” Tracey says airily, looking up at the ceiling for some reason. Draco knows her father is part of the Ministry like Draco’s is, but he wonders why she knows how the Department of Mysteries works. Then he remembers it’s Tracey and drops it.
“Aye, Draco Malfoy,” Hagrid says, turning and smiling at Draco in a way it makes the boy’s shoulders relax. “You’ve been creatin’ quite the stir, ain’ ye? Good ter see someone lookin’ out fer THAT one,” Hagrid makes a motion towards Harry with his head and the boy flushes. Draco glances over at him thoughtfully, before shrugging and smiling back at Hagrid.
Draco shrugs, as if it is no big deal. “Then this will still be a helpful lesson for your life, I suspect. How do you expect to get better if you don’t push your boundaries a little?”
“Are… are there any other family members I have… out there?” he whispers, looking at Harry pleadingly and the other boy looks taken aback and then apologetic again. Draco’s stomach drops.
The Astronomy Tower, the Owlery, isolated spots on the grounds of the castle, and very occasionally the Greenhouses were Draco’s main hideaways to talk on his radio. They were all quiet and abandoned when classes were out, or just out of the way enough it would be easy for Draco to cover what he was doing if someone ever did approach.
Draco, for the time being, watched from a distance as Harry grew more and more flustered. They would need to head for the locker room soon to get changed, but for now Draco could wait and enjoy the show.
a cruel mistress. Seriously, though, he doesn’t sound like a bad guy. You used to gush about him all the time. You at least stopped with all the parent comments, right?”
“Just wait and see, Malfoy,” the boy wonder says lowly, then hooks their arms together and drags him after Eve when they get the passes.
Draco is having none of it. He pouts immediately, holding the cage a little closer to his chest and looking up at the employee unhappily. “Excuse me, but this is the owl I choose. She’s lovely and I want her.”
“I do. It is nothing, really, I was just hoping for your help with something. I can go. I’ll tell Umbridge I had a question about homework if she brings it up,” Draco says in a rush. He doesn’t know how Umbridge could ever know about this kind of meeting, but he wouldn’t put it past her… somehow…
They don’t linger, though, because there’s something about this situation that makes Draco think they might be on the clock. Why else would the Gryffindors have run off so suddenly without preamble? Without waiting for Draco?
They fall into silence, basking in the morning air, listening to the world as it comes alive, uncaring for the drama they’ve lived through only two nights ago.
“Oh, Harry,” Mrs. Weasley sighs, reaching out and brushing her fingers through Potter’s curls. Some of the shaking eases away at the action. “Here, take the rest of your potion,” she says, so gentle in her every action, but Potter shakes his head like a petulant child, burying himself deeper into Draco’s fur.
It was thanks to his capabilities to leave early that he ended up at the Room of Requirement before any of the other students. It is also how he ended up running into Dobby during the last DA meeting of the year, who was in the process of decorating the entire room with Harry Potter themed Christmas decorations.
Ever since she had taken over, the whole of Hogwarts had basically agreed to make her life a living hell. Now, with her sanity already on the fritz, she looks like she’s going to start laughing like a mad woman while her head spins three-hundred and sixty degrees. Her eyes are wild, her hair unkempt, and her robes are crooked where they sit. She looks like she hasn’t slept in weeks and has been running a marathon everyday.
“Anyway, Order told me to give you this,” Ebru is still speaking, reaching under her robes and pulling out a badge. It is a simple design in the shape of a geometric, gold octagon on a black background. In the middle of the crossing lines sits a tiny piece of amber.
“The Order knows what it’s doing, Harry, please… don’t jump into this when you don’t need to,” Granger pleads, but there’s an edge to her tone, like she’s already growing frustrated herself.
“Yeah, if you were to out stage anyone it would be me,” he says. Harry had told him before his father was a Chaser. It had helped when they practiced alone, Harry familiar with the position more than expected.
“That was… something,” he decides, glancing up at the elder witch at his side. She sighs, sounding disappointed, but nods.
Draco scowls at where she had been before looking down when Sirius nudges his hand with his wet nose. Sirius, despite being a dog, has remarkably expressive eyes as he looks to the form in clear concern. This form wouldn’t get them anywhere near the Records Department.
“The very one,” Lucius smirks, seeming to share a joke with his wife. Then, he is looking back to his son and Draco feels a distinct drop in his stomach. Lucius doesn’t look mad or disappointed or enraged like Draco had been panicking he would be. Instead, he looks proud. Once upon a time, that would have felt good…
There is, of course, chocolate, American candies, along with a few cans of perishables and water. There’s a notecard that reads “Can’t be punk rock if you’re not hydrated!” that Potter treats like it could be a “hundred dollar bill,” or whatever Max called it.
“I’ll try. I’d imagine there would be tons of land for me to run around on in my animagus form?” Draco asks.
! Merlin, punish yourself later! I want answers!” Draco demands, marching over and grabbing his wardrobe’s handle to hold the door still. Dobby makes a high-pitched, whining noise, but does as told. “Why? If it would have been against orders, why keep something like this from my parents? Are you hoping to hold this over me, then? Huh?!”
“It happened because we shattered the prophecy record in their room,” Harry says slowly, looking back at the shattered glass on the ground.
The pitch, after that, goes to the Slytherins. Draco makes note of all the Gryffindor’s furious faces, locking them away in his memories, before he’s in the air and focusing on his strategy.
Draco has only just gotten himself situated, hands in his lap, when the goblin takes hold of the controls and they take off like a whip. The young boy shrieks in surprise, hands shooting out to cling to McGonagall’s robes as they rocket out into a massive cavern, a bottomless pit beneath them, all lit by rudimentary torches. The elder witch at his side seems unaffected as they swerve left and right, spiraling down and down and down, sitting up straight and only tilting slightly with the movement. She does have one hand up to hold her hat in place, however, but she hardly seems bothered.
The thoughts follow him through the rest of the day, building up his optimism as he heads to wandless tutoring. He feels confident and invigorated, adrenaline coursing through him as he finally manages to cast
The pale boy scowls and leans forward, ignoring Harry and Theodore’s calls of protest, and reaches into the bag, scooping out a very familiar, brown snake. “Muddy,” he says, eyes thinned as the snake’s tail curls around his hand like a greeting and her head comes up to look at Draco.
When everything is over, and Draco has hardly even cheered since he has to be well behaved right now if he even dares wish to survive the rest of the summer, Lucius is telling Narcissa to head home without them. He’d like some time with their son.
In the next ten minutes students begin to arrive in Umbridge’s office, filling up the space. They are all Slytherins, because of course they are, eight more in total. Crabbe, Goyle, Theodore, and Pansy are all there and they all give Draco confused glances. When he glares at them, however, they fall silent and play along.
“Apparently You-Know-Who showed up. Potter said something or other to Lestrange to piss him off and he attacked,” Blaise replies and Draco feels what remains of his blood drain from his face. Voldemort… had been there? Voldemort had attacked Harry? No. No that couldn’t have happened…
Max calls him an idiot and won’t talk to Draco for a few days after that, and Draco regrets telling them about the fight, but at least they
“Will do! Feel good mixtapes, coming up!” Max says brightly, but then pauses, sobering up. “Can’t believe you guys actually had a kid die… That’s really awful,” they whisper and Draco sighs.
Potter has the good grace to at least look away, face stony, so Draco continues. “My house is not weak, nor would anyone forgive you for insinuating we are victims in any manner, but it does seem convenient that everyone’s eyes are on the first house everyone is far too eager to place the blame on.”
“I’m really sorry,” the other boy says quietly, fidgeting with his hands. “I think Ron’s trying to help you,” Draco can’t help but snort and Harry’s green eyes widen in panic, “Honest! He just… he doesn’t have the best tact…”
Eventually the first years go off to their dorm rooms and Draco bids Pansy good night, heading off himself.
As Draco stands before it, observing it and taking photos, he’s reminded of a strange, demented fountain, the water gurgling and spitting out nasty bubbles of swamp gas. The Weasley twins would love it. He reminds himself to get them copies of the photos later.
“Plus, the connection Voldemort and I seem to have. What else could it be?” Harry says, sounding more and more excited. Draco isn’t sure why this, of all things, has got the Boy-Who-Lived so energized, especially with everything going on.
The Brain Room, the oldest known division, originating with study of the Muggle mind, and now studied the mind as a whole.
Draco swallows, immediately not liking where his mind is taking him, and he forces down all the sickening feelings that are building up inside him. He couldn’t address this now, couldn’t think about it. He and Weasley were on the clock and they couldn’t dilly-dally anymore.
“Everyone’s afraid of something. My mama told me so.” That draws Draco up short. Max’s mother? Muggle or not, a mother was a mother, and they knew far more than anyone could ever fathom. Draco’s own mother had proven that. “Maybe your dad is scared of everything changing, like with those traditions and junk. Maybe that’s why he’s trying to get rid of them.”
Pansy had shown up at Brewer’s Alchemy right before closing to ensure he kept his word. She was already dressed in the outfit she had deemed appropriate for the night’s festivities and Draco saw more than one set of eyes in the shop eye her appreciatively. She was dressed in a tight mini royal blue dress that hugged her every curve and left nothing to the imagination. Her cropped brown hair was bone straight and tucked behind one ear. Her makeup was artful as always, and if Draco wasn’t gay, and not always irritated with her a bit, he would have looked twice. He dreaded walking back to the flat with her in her high heels, knowing she would complain the entire walk. She finally agreed that they could apparate, even though they both abhorred the feeling of doing so. As soon as they arrived home, she dragged him to his bedroom to begin getting ready.
With that, Blaise left and shut Draco’s door behind him. Begrudgingly, Draco pulled himself from his bed and grabbed clothes to take with him to the shower. He still felt hungover and hoped the water would wash some of his grogginess away.
“Alright everybody!” Blaise shouted to the group, now clustered in a small circle to the left of the bar, “To old friends and new beginnings!” He thrust his glass outwards towards the center and gave a knowing look at Draco. Each of his friends did the same, shouting the familiar words, and swiftly glancing between him and the green-eyed man beside him. Potter turned slightly to Draco and much softer than the rest of them, declared “to old friends and new beginnings” and thrust his hand into the center with the other Slytherins. Glancing up, he caught Potter staring down at him, and he tried to will down another blush from surfacing. He licked his lips, clinked his glass with the others declaring the same sentiment. They each downed their shot and after sucking on their lemon, their group peeled into laughter at the faces they were all making. Well and truly sloshed now, Draco reiterated that it was time to go home. The alcohol had clearly caught up with all of them and Draco knew that if he didn’t go to bed soon, his night would be spent dealing with the spins.
“Shut up Millie. Like you’re any different.” Draco raised an eyebrow at where Greg;s arms were tightly wrapped around her waist. She merely winked and turned back to the bar when the bartender sat their glasses in front of them, poured the tequila and placed a lemon on the edge of each glass.
“I am resolute, strong, and I have had many, many years to steel myself to the evils of man. I can last a short while more,” Huang-Jun assures, but it doesn’t do much to calm Draco down. Apparently, it doesn’t do much for Weasley, either…
On his eighth birthday Draco gets his very own racing broom. He adores it and goes flying for hours on end, even convincing his father to come into the air for a little bit and pass around a Quaffle. Lucius doesn’t stay long, but it still is positively invigorating.
“Yeah, yeah…” Harry sighs, and for a while Draco thinks that’s the end of the discussion. They focus on their wand work and incantations, Astoria drifts by to help Draco with a particular wrist movement he’d been missing, but then Harry is sighing miserably.
“What a coincidence. So am I,” Harry smiles, free and joyful like he hadn’t been in so long, and Draco presses down until their lips are meeting in yet another kiss, his purr and Harry’s laughter intermingling with every move.
“Guess not, I don’t know them, but I highly doubt it,” he says then shoots a glance sideways when Harry says nothing. The boy’s green eyes are huge and staring straight ahead as they walk, his lips thin, and he’s pale like he was after he’d been sorted. Draco tries not to groan. He really wasn’t the person for this. “Look, when we get there how about we just sit at the Gryffindor table, okay? I want to see Hermione anyway.”
“They came to rescue me, you see. I thought I could stop the troll - on account I have read so much about them - but I couldn’t…” Hermione says and Pansy chokes on her own spit while Ron actually drops his wand. Draco only just manages to contain his shocked expression as he stares up at his best friend, the girl facing off against three of their teachers and telling a flat lie.
Harry brought his mate in his room through the window, being extra careful to not hit his head. Most of the lower parts of his room was underwater, as he needed it or for whenever he felt like it, he’d go to the water. With roots crawling into the room from the outside, and bottles and things Harry found interesting was kept there. With it underwater, and the sun still up, it made the room light with blue.
Their reunion only led to more future questions for Draco, While Harry just watched, satisfied with who he finally got in his grasp...
He won’t feel satisfied until he sees Harry in person, unharmed. He needs to know what is wrong with Sirius. He wants to know what happened with the strange, black orb that had formed in the Death Chamber. He should walk the halls of Hogwarts and assure himself that Umbridge will not return.
He wasn’t necessarily proud of them, he didn’t really care, but he was happy he didn’t have to work as hard to get them to leave him alone. It wasn’t like he needed his guards anymore, either. His taunts rarely escalated into physical violence nowadays, and usually it was only with Potter that they did, and a few thrown hexes tended to solve the issue quick enough.
Draco has absolutely no idea what is going on right now, his eyes widening as the three Gryffindors settle into his compartment like they own the place.
“Or, we’re innovators,” Potter offers back cheerfully, even though he looks like he’s going to start laughing again.
Oh well, it wasn’t like he intended to interact with them much beyond the initial mission into the Ministry’s Records Department.
With a solid weight in his stomach the blond schools his features. He takes all the feelings rolling around in his head, stuffs them together, then locks them away for later. He feels cold, but that’s what he needs right now.
“Alright, Malfoy?” asks the other twin, but he’s still smirking so Draco doesn’t think he’s actually trying to ask after his wellbeing. The Weasley’s and the Malfoy’s despised one another. It wouldn’t do to start showing concern over each other.
When Draco wakes back up the sun is setting and the crowd of Gryffindors around Potter’s bed is dissipating. The sound of rain still murmurs outside the hospital wing, giving the room a quiet, relaxed atmosphere that wasn’t present last time he was conscious.
Draco stares at his radio in amazement, not for the words, but for how they make his chest feel lighter very suddenly.
“While a counseling service is a beneficial tool for young minds, requiring students to already know what they want to do prior to entering their meetings is directly detrimental to our developing sense of self. As we grow, so too does the world, thus meaning our desires, skill sets, and the demand for particular workers will shift. Demanding we put a particular career choice as our focus rather than urging us to experiment with our lives and abilities is an inefficient use of resources, power, and generally lazy and disrespectful.”
Draco eyes the girl quietly for a time, both walking in silence, until he offers, in a hesitant voice, “Very well… Hermione. Then you may call me Draco, if you like.”
“Can you just live here forever?” Sirius questions when Draco comes down to dinner after quieting a mouthy Walburga. The next day he and Potter would be leaving, and while she was “happy to see that mutt out of her home” she was sad to see Draco go.
He’d already had similar instances with Max over the year, but this is the first time Harry’s dealt with it.
“Draco!” The blonde looks up at the call just in time to see Harry following after, moving much quicker on his broom with an air of confidence about him. “Toss it to me! I can lose him!”
“Oh, uh… Thank you, Mr. Potter. That’s high praise coming from such a seasoned Chaser yourself,” Draco says carefully, one eyebrow arching, “How long ago did you play, again? Thirty? Forty years?”
“You two are also standing right beneath it,” Draco calls, then wiggles his fingers at them and smirks. “Kisssssss.”
“Plus!” Potter’s voice is far too high and Draco thinks he may be getting a tad hysterical, “If YOU present the photos, you’ll have a higher chance of being trusted. You’re unbiased in this situation, they’d only think you were in the right place at the right time, and your father’s in the Ministry.”
“Hello?!” Weasley calls when, after a few moments of standing before the building, nothing happens. Draco isn’t sure exactly what he feels, like a chill up his spine that has nothing to do with the cold, but he can’t help but glance sideways at the swirling clouds. They look like they are moving differently, suddenly. “Anyone home?!”
“And sneak around all day? Rather not,” he says, then presses in close, leisurely wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist and settling against his front. “Want to just go around the grounds? It’s bound to be quiet with everyone in Hogsmeade.”
He also doesn’t have much reason to stick around anymore, he realizes. He knows how this goes. Potter and the twins will get in trouble, Montague won’t, and Draco will just talk to Potter afterwards. So, instead, Draco turns around and makes his way towards the locker rooms.
The bushy-haired girl then sweeps her two friends away and drags them towards the busier parts of Hogsmeade in search of something to do, ignoring Draco’s flabbergasted face and Potter’s mumbled protests. Weasley doesn’t say anything, because his mouth is full of PopRocks, and Draco really doesn’t have time to think about when he’d managed to snag those from the Slytherin’s bag.
She shoves it at Draco with a scowl. She wasn’t a very pleasant woman, he was quickly realizing, and he wondered how much she knew about his involvement in her demotion.
Potter’s arms fall into his lap and he looks down. He looks crestfallen, actually, and a string in Draco’s heart actually has the audacity to get tugged. “I was never able to get my permission slip signed.”
“You cannot force emotion,” Sinistra says, turning back to look at the girls, completely emotionless herself. “In the end, practice will assure you success, just as with any spell.”
For a long stretch of time the ten-year-old crouches beside his bed, staring at the vast expanse of nothingness, a numb kind of panic settling into his bones.
“Combination of adrenaline crash, pain, and potions,” Draco tries to smirk, but it fades in his exhaustion. He presses his hand more firmly into Harry’s cheek, urging them to make eye contact - grey to green - and he says, honestly, “You have no idea how relieved I am to see you…”
“It is the offensive variant of the Patronus Charm,” Granger speaks up, finding her voice now that Draco has gotten the ball rolling. “It is the physical manifestation of our survival instinct.”
He also calls on her while he’s in the library, which earns him a nasty glare from Pince. He can only be thankful Granger isn’t present, otherwise she would surely blow a gasket seeing the Malfoy house elf. She’d been so wrapped up in her SPEW nonsense Draco hardly knew how to come close to handling her. How could the Gryffindor kids deal with this on a regular basis?
“And by ‘it,’ what are you referring to?” Draco demands, ignoring the sickening lurch in his stomach when he hears that family name. His aunt Bellatrix, his mother’s sister.
“Yes, but that doesn’t mean you have to do every single thing he tells you. He’s not your ruler and you’re not slaves. That’s not how teams work,” Draco shakes his head. Flint had given Draco plenty of orders before that he hadn’t listened to, and a few that he had. Everyone on the Slytherin team had. It was just how they worked.
He’d been having so much fun, lost in the humdrum of the crowd, happy even though he’d probably never admit it out loud. Not to the company that had put him in the mood and certainly not to his parents.
Leandra Cass is a short, plump Hufflepuff girl with dark skin, straight, black hair, and a cute green dress with pink flowers adorning the base. When Eve makes her way over and Leandra sees her, the Hufflepuff beams, looking positively cherubic, and Draco can tell Eve melts a little, even from this angle.
“Very rousing speech, Mr. Malfoy,” Umbridge says above the din of the students, wand pointing straight at the blond even as the other DA members raise their wands in preparation. “But that is far enough.”
In addition, he had every intention of telling Harry the moment they saw each other again at Hogwarts, and this additional time to research might give him more answers that Harry and the Golden Trio were sure to want.
Again, Harry and Ron keep Draco updated as the tryouts continue. Ron doesn’t know all the names of every student this time, but he can point out some of the returning players. The same thing happens for Ravenclaw when it is their turn next. By this time the Weasley twins have showered and joined them to “Check out the competition.”
?!” Harry exclaims, manners out the window in the face of this apparent discovery. Draco doesn’t understand why this is so surprising. Flying was spectacular from what he’d just discovered, who wouldn’t want to do it?
“Sit back down, Draco, you know better,” Mr Nubble says, making a motion with his hand at the abandoned chair behind the pale boy, but he isn’t having any of this. He has never gotten mail before and he wants to see it.
And then Potter is smiling helplessly and ducking his head, shoulders shaking with small hiccups of laughter, and Draco’s heart jumps again, a few heartstrings getting yanked in every direction, and Draco wonders if this is what Eve felt like when Leandra smiled at her.
Draco glares furiously at the radio, grip tightening on the device with vicious, tiny fingers, and he shakes it. “Work, you stupid thing!” he demands, voice watery and angry with child-like indignation.
“Wouldn’t I be intruding? Isn’t this as much of an escape for you, too?” Potter asks and his voice sounds thin. Almost confused, but not quite. It makes something in Draco’s gut twist, so he puts on a smarmy mask and gives Potter a bland look.
“What part of ‘We don’t know’ did you not catch?” Eve hisses back at him, growing irritated, but before a fight or argument can break out between them, the door behind them swings shut on its own, startling them with the loud, violent bang. They shriek, looking back at the door, then scramble towards it when it begins to bleed away.
Draco feels something inside him catch, tightening and twisting with the sudden burst of emotion those words bring on, and he tries to gulp around them. “I should thank you, too,” he whispers, smiling even though his eyes are suddenly wet. “For putting up with me. I know it can’t have been easy.”
“Stick your right hand out over your broom and say ‘UP!’” Madam Hooch instructs, placing down a broom of her own and then showing them how to do it. Harry immediately does as instructed and his broom shoots straight up into his hand. Draco stares, amazed and impressed, before taking a deep breath, centering himself, and trying as well. It is with a great sense of pride that his own broom shoots straight into his hand with a resounding smack. He looks again at Harry, a giddiness taking over him and wondering if his friend saw. They lock eyes and grin at each other, some of the nerves washing off Draco.
“In that case,” Draco sighs, deflating, then reaches into his satchel and removes his manila folder. He uses a quick Duplicating Charm on his findings, then holds the copy out to Dumbledore. “That’s everything I’ve found, so far, on this investigation.”
They’d fit into each other’s spaces so easily, it just took them a while to figure out how to make it a good thing.
“Deal,” Sirius chuckles, then squeezes Draco’s shoulder as his eyes turn sad. “Take care of yourself, Draco. I don’t like you being out here on your own. This should be someone else’s responsibility.”
Except that wasn’t like Potter, the Weasleys were gone too, and the teachers wouldn’t have stood for such a flimsy excuse as “teenage romance gone awry.” Still, that dreadful thought had planted itself in Draco’s head, despite his reasoning, and he couldn’t seem to shake it.
“Think of what you fight for,” his professor eventually instructs, not disagreeing or agreeing with Draco’s personal assessment, but Draco suspects she doubts him very much. He tries not to flinch or look away, focusing on her words instead. “What kind of power might coincide with these feelings?”
“Whoa… whoa, whoa, whoa… You’re THE Harry Potter?” Max begins, which garners a confused and even more panicked expression from Potter, because a Muggle isn’t supposed to know who he is. “The child actor?”
“I am not obsessed,” Snape says dryly, not looking up from his cauldron where he is dutifully working. Draco had originally been running circles around him and his things until the man had summoned a stool and parked Draco into it. The young boy’s legs dangled and swung as he spoke, like he wanted to be up and moving, but knowing he shouldn’t push his luck with his godfather.
“No… no I didn’t,” Harry mumbles, ducking his head and staring down at the table. A tension fills the already ward-filled air, the students uncertain what to say in the face of Harry’s mounting distress, until finally Draco frees his hand and instead reaches out to lay it against Harry’s back. Before he can offer any words of comfort, however, Harry is looking up at him sharply. “Are the Potters part of those Sacred 28 assholes?”
Then, apparently done with her announcements, McGonagall is telling them to wait here while she disappears into what Draco realizes to be the Great Hall. Whispers quickly pick up amongst the students and Draco manages to wiggle through to Hermione, who thankfully meets him halfway.
“Yeah, a punk. A group of like-minded youth who refuse to be made into mindless, consumer sheep by the desperate bourgeoisie who struggle to remain relevant by belittling those who cannot fight for themselves. We are aware of the hypocrisy within our society that sustains the upper class on a foundation of colonialism and death. We, then, strive to tear it down.”
He hardly even looked in Potter’s direction. Draco suspected he had more communication with the Malfoy heir than he did the Boy-Who-Lived.
“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” the redhead sounded frustrated for some reason and Draco glances at him. “I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling with a troll.” That has Harry snorting, obviously finding that funny, and Draco wonders who Fred is.
Max snorts, sudden and heartfelt, which has Draco perking up. “Well, that can’t be right. Your dad probably just wants you to be some kinda puppet, I bet. A carbon copy of him!”
“A living person… Who is gone now, from this world. He will be marginally missed for the rest of our days.”
But they couldn’t linger. They had their distraction and they needed to go. So, he hurries forward towards Tracey, pawing at her arm until she looks up. He then makes pointed motions at the closest door they could get to and she nods, understanding, and hooks her arms under Weasley’s armpits.
Draco figured if he wanted proof, at this point, he was going to have to go and get it. Moody’s office was a mystery to Draco, but Potter had described a place cluttered with all kinds of stuff, most of which he couldn’t identify. If there was any proof to be found… it had to be somewhere in there.
“Can it work through solid objects?” Harry asks quickly, “That’s what heat vision goggles are so great for.”
“He was right at the center of the initial explosion when Harry threw the record,” Tracey finally speaks up, standing shoulder to shoulder with Luna, her eyes staring straight at Draco blankly. “He was knocked out from the reaction between the veil and prophecy record, not from the knife. Whatever happened to him because of it has left him comatose.”
Harry is fucking terrified and Draco isn’t sure what to do with that. He’s scared too, but he hasn’t been facing off against Death Eaters this whole time, unsure if he’ll make it out alive or not.
An announcement sounds through the train, then, as Draco is stretching to get down his things, that they should leave their possessions onboard and they will be taken up to the school later. Draco pouts at that, having rushed all the way back here to get his things, but doesn’t let his mood sour too much as he’s dragged out of the compartment by his best friend.
The jukebox, as it turns out, is what is playing the music. It takes money through a little slot and then allows the customer to pick the next song. Draco is intrigued by its shape and design, all the lights flashing inside, while Max has the audacity to say, “This thing is so old!”
Potter jumps a little, leaning away and looking back at Draco with wide eyes, before glancing back behind him towards Hagrid’s hut. There is movement inside and Draco can occasionally see the half giant walking around inside.
“He… Can I…?” Draco can’t seem to find the right words, spluttering desperately, but Sinistra cuts him off.
“Is that that girl’s name?” Harry asks, motioning with his head towards the closed compartment door and Draco nods at him.
“How long have you even been down here?” Weasley asks, looking bewildered. The two wizards must look a mess with their soaked robes and wind-thrown hair.
Today, however, he is alone, making notes on a piece of parchment as he tries to list out possible subjects.
The table is quiet for a few beats, soaking up everything they’d discussed, until Granger sighs miserably and says, flatly, “Pureblood culture is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.”
“Goblins. Oceanic merpeople. Giants, if you can manage. If you think of any, go for it, and if we come up with any, we’ll contact you,” the Slytherin replies with a cheerful smile, Skeeter’s glare only getting harsher.
“I wish everyone would calm down about Slytherin joining us,” Potter admits, ducking his head with a defeated sigh.
Umbridge is pleased to see Draco as she prepares for her next class, which Draco takes as a good sign he’s done something right in his plan thus far, and he voices his “concerns.”
And in the corner is a small photo of Draco’s face, unmoving at first, but when he twists the card a little the picture changes to that of a snow leopard.
“True… But he was the one that found the troll,” Hermione cuts in, wagging her finger absently in front of her while she thinks. “If it had been Professor Sinistra the troll would have gotten in earlier, since we saw her at the Feast, and Muddy would have fled much earlier than we know she did.”
“W-what?” he splutters in surprise, shaking his head in obvious confusion, and the merman rolls his eyes but keeps smiling.
“It’s very impressive that someone so young was able to develop a spell so quickly,” Granger tries to play peacemaker, but her hair is a mess and there is a definite twitch in her right eye. Weasley, also, takes a step away from her.
Sirius looks between the two boys with a raised brow, confused, but doesn’t push the subject. They end up wishing Draco farewell a moment later, hurrying off to meet up with the Weasley’s for Potter’s big day. Draco, alone once more, goes back to taking photos of some of the decorative statues and gargoyles, enjoying the calm before the storm.
“Oh! Well, as you must know we share Potions on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,” she begins, forced cheer in her voice as she begins to recount her schedule. Tentatively Ron joins in, asking Harry why they have to wait until Friday for that, and Harry tells Ron the same thing he told Draco.
The next time Draco has the opportunity he offers his Walkman to Krum, a cassette of Nirvana already set inside, and watches as the Durmstrang Champion listens to the music, head bobbing but expression unwavering.
“So, drop me. You’ve gotten me some truly juicy, heart-pounding information for my lovely readers, but if I am as useless as you say…” Skeeter pauses and extends her hand to Draco, a vial of some kind between her pointer and middle finger, and Draco pauses to look at it.
“We’ll be fine,” Blaise adds on, in a rare instance of sincerity, and his hand grabs for Draco’s invisible shoulder. It’s just a quick squeeze of reassurance, but something solid and begrudging settles in Draco’s stomach.
He isn’t in a rush, though. There are so many other things to worry about right now and, walking around Brixton looking for local music and food, Draco doesn’t want to worry about anything.
The corridors are empty, no one is supposed to be out, it is night out and he must be breaking so many rules, but he just doesn’t
“Hello, Professor,” Hagrid greets stiffly. It was in moments like these it really shown through how much of a Gryffindor the half-giant still was. Not standing down from a confrontation, but completely lacking in capable acting skills.
“That’s what I’m doing, end of story,” Harry says sharply, “Then, afterwards, I’ll come back down. Blaise said the password to get in was ‘hognose.’ Is that right?”
“We did hear the Order talking, though,” Blaise says, glancing back at the entrance to the hospital wing with a judgmental look. “Really, it’s a miracle they’ve stayed secret this long. They have no idea how to use inside voices.”
“She’s the only one that knows about these meet ups, and she would be familiar with her own Turbo XX, making jinxing it easier, I’d assume,” Draco would admit, he wasn’t so familiar with jinxes or hexes save for the basics, but it made logical sense. He simply needed to start researching this to get a better picture. Until then, though, he only had his theories. “Plus, she’s the only witch or wizard I know of that can use magic without a wand.”
“Good to see you, Draco,” Sirius says with a grin, reaching out and squeezing the blonde’s shoulder, “And I love the hair! Harry mentioned it and I didn’t believe him.”
After a truly impressive struggle on their end, Draco winds up having to accept his fate as Max recounts some of his more expressive stories about Potter. Clearly plenty of terms have been Muggle-fied, but Potter seems to catch on quick enough, and grins brightly at the radio in his hands, occasionally encouraging Max on.
wand,” she says firmly, and her wand, made of a pitch-black wood that has been shaped into a geometric shape, flies out of her robes and into her hand. She puts the wand back into her robes a moment later.
For a moment Fudge considers the options, the corridor falling silent as they wait. “Black… will not be returning to Azkaban. Nor will he be sentenced to the dementor’s kiss,” Fudge finally says, slowly weighing each word as he speaks, “He will be under heavy observation, however, but… so long as he cooperates, he may return to the Black family home.”
They fall into companionable silence, reading as students mill about outside, finding compartments before the train gets moving. Eventually, and completely expected, their own door busts open to let in the Golden Trio.
The boy stops mid-sentence and looks over, green eyes wide with surprise. He probably hadn’t even noticed he was talking so much. “Oh! Yeah, sure. Go ahead.”
“Is that… sign language?” Skeeter questions, baffled, as Eve and Agi have a silent conversation with each other.
“Hey, Draco, sorry. I don’t think Max is in any shape to chat right now,” Eric says, sounding distracted. There are sounds of a struggle in the background and Max’s voice calling, “Eric, put me down! Put me down! You jerkwad, put me down!”
McGonagall calmly stashes her stick away and turns back to Mrs Nubble. Everyone is staring in utter silence now, shock permeating around the room like a physical entity. “Will that suffice?” the witch questions and Mrs Nubble swallows.
“Not just from an outsider’s point of view,” Max’s mother continues, “But from the one experiencing it as well.”
“Again?” Draco arches a brow, remembering Sirius Black hadn’t been given a trial the first time, either.
“Why would I do that if I already have you at my beck and call?” Draco drawls, bored, and crosses his arms. Skeeter seems particularly displeased by the comment and, thankfully, shuts up for the time being. “Find anything out about Crouch?”
He does not get to attend Potter’s hearing, even when he honeys his words and lays praise after praise on all the officials that will be present. They tell him not to worry, that this was a private matter, but he would surely hear about the outcome soon afterwards.
“We are in desperate need of a new Beater,” she says, but waves that one off, “A Chaser,” now she looks pointedly at Draco. He has no idea what a Chaser is, though. “And a Seeker,” then she looks at Harry. The boy sits up straight, eyes widening even further. He doesn’t have anything to say to that so Draco wonders if Seeker is a big deal.
“And while you are a complete mess of a man, you have proven to possess wit well-suited for the position of professor,” Draco continues, still not saying what he’d originally meant to say, but unable to quit now that he’d gotten going.
As they ate and Mrs Nubble hustled around gathering her paperwork and supplies for work, Mr Nubble listed out their chores for the day. Frederick was to gather up and do the laundry through the day while cleaning the bathrooms in his free time. Ada needed to vacuum every floor in the house and mow the yard. Draco was to tend the garden, as usual, and help Mr Nubble organize, clean, and prep the kitchen. Frederick and Ada gave Draco sympathetic looks, for Mr Nubble was a very demanding man and would most likely be nit picking Draco every step of the way.
“Hypothetically…” Draco says, sighing, “If I did send Skeeter to you, why are you approaching me now?”
Then he’s reeling back in horror, his green eyes blown wide after he’d read the beginning of the spell’s description. “No! Absolutely not! Are you a nutter or something?!”
“What could you have possibly done, mate?” Weasley reasons, his brows pinched and concerned. “There were Aurors there and everything. And the toad snuck up on us. We did all that we could.”
“No! Turn it off! I am not having that stuck in my head, you hear me?” Hermione demands, but Draco moves the CD player out of her reach before she can snatch it. He’s grinning now, the song going on. “Malfoy, I’m serious, stop it!”
“I am not having this conversation with you again,” Draco grumbles, having to hold the radio under his chin as he lifts up a bag of fertilizer.
Harry grins brightly, like he had before he’d made a fool of himself, “Nice to meet you too, Draco Malfoy.”
The Unspeakables, to Draco’s understanding, did the exact same thing in the Department of Mysteries. Sure, it would be easier to sneak around at night, when no one was there, but Draco and Weasley didn’t have that option with their floo situation. It would have been significantly more helpful to have had an Invisibility Cloak with them as they made their way down to the Ministry’s basement, but it would alert the Unspeakables to their presence due to their currently active security spells.
“That’s lovely to hear. Listen, I actually wanted to ask for your assistance, Mr. Davis,” Draco finally moves onto why he’d really hurried to the Records Department the second he’d been offered access. Mr. Davis says nothing, just tilts his head to one side. “Everything is recorded here. What about…” he was taking a chance here, “Prophecies?”
“What do you two want?” he demands, making for his own trunk to deposit his textbooks and equipment, but his two housemates won’t move out of the way, so he’s left to just stand there awkwardly in his own room.
The sun and breeze feel heavenly against Draco’s skin as he lays out in the grass, all his finals behind him and he can finally breathe a sigh of relief. He’d felt confident in most of them, but still utterly spent from all the studying and papers he’d had to do.
Draco, shocked, raises a hand to his stinging cheek, eyes wide as saucers as he watches Granger slump back into her seat. He’s taunted many, many people with a lot worse than that, but he’s never been slapped before.
He sets the camera to the side, fully intent to continue his silent reading, but Creevey is still standing beside his table. Draco arches a displeased eyebrow at him. “What?” he snaps.
“Who should we tell? About the Killing Curse?” Potter questions as Draco goes to retrieve his satchel and camera. The distance that the movement puts between them seems to make it a tad easier to talk, for the moment.
“What? Yeah-- I mean no, of course not, everything’s kind of a mess, but… you already knew that and…” Harry stops and groans, taking back his hand from Draco’s grasp to run both through his messy hair. Draco waits, just as he had in the hospital wing, and watches.
“You ‘don’t have a clue,’ not ‘ain’t got no clue,’ Max,” Draco drawls, ignoring the following raspberry the Muggle blows at him over their connection. “And what about that boy you were waxing poetic about some time ago? Did you two not have a relationship of sorts building?” Max didn’t often talk about their romantic life or leanings, but it had been mentioned on a few occasions that they’d finally approached the newest boy in their class in hopes of making something of their feelings.
Potter hesitates, eying his own cup, but then slowly raises it. “To loved ones,” he says, softer than most toasts Draco has ever heard, and taps his tea against Sirius’s. Their galaxies morph and explode as well, now in a mish-mash of reds and purples, and the two drink.
The easiest solution Draco could think of, thus, was dragging Longbottom out to deal with one of his safer fears, which lead to Longbottom’s panicked stuttering, which lead to Draco growing irritated, which lead to him shoving Longbottom none-too-kindly into the clearing housing the thestral herd.
“Maybe… Someone will still find him?” Draco offers slowly, shrugging a shoulder and looking awkward. “I mean… Someone has to clean the train, right?”
“Hello, Luna. Tracey,” Draco nods and Tracey offers a fast wave despite standing right in front of him while her face doesn’t change. “Did you need something?”
There were precursors to the Ministry, though. Ruling factions of witches and wizards that would eventually evolve into the government Draco knew today. They must have been the ones this dragon had interacted with.
“What you just defined is what you already do,” Ginny muses, a small smile on her face, and Draco arches a haughty brow at her.
” with the ease of a master, and his beautiful stag leaps from his wand. Immediately, the stag and thestral are intrigued by each other, turning to sniff at their faces, necks, flanks, until their leaning back. They stamp in place a few times, not disturbing any of the dirt, before they’re both hopping and trotting through the surrounding trees.
Harry leans just the slightest bit towards Draco, eyes fluttering, but then he’s leaning back and looking around. “We shouldn’t talk here,” he says, voice rough, and then he’s leading them further down the hallway to an abandoned classroom. It’s filled with desks and chairs stacked upside down atop them. Some chalkboards are shoved against the far wall and sheets cover some furniture in the corner.
Mr. Crouch?” Eve whispers. Draco’s never seen her so shaken, but then again they’ve never seen a dead body before, either.
In addition, Draco found it particularly easy to tell the twins apart through the written word. George’s handwriting was slightly more flowy than Fred’s, while Fred had a surprisingly subtle sense of dark humor. Eventually, once he’d realized the twins were sharing a page for their letters, Draco had begun writing two separate letters for each. In turn, he usually received a pair of letters in return, one from “Gred” and one from “Forge.”
He sits with Eve, Crabbe, and Goyle for the beginning of the ride, but much as his last trip on this very train, eventually Crabbe and Goyle slip away. A little faster this time, which Draco is thankful for, and so too does Eve.
Potter rarely spoke to him beyond a professional level, and usually completely ignored him outside of their file digging, but Draco hardly cared. He usually avoided Sirius and Potter, allowing them to have their super fun, super exciting family holiday, and stuck to his guest room to keep looking through files on his own.
They are eventually ushered off the field by their team after all the official announcements are made, properly awarding Slytherin the victory. The locker room is abuzz with activity as they go about peeling off their uniforms. The dour, ruthless attitude from before the game is gone, everyone grinning and laughing and patting Harry on the back. Even Flint cracks a smile and gives the bespectacled boy a nod.
“Why do Muggles do anything?” Draco scoffs, scratching behind the kitten’s ear, “Because they’re panicky, stupid animals.”
Draco sits through one of the most boring prefects’ meetings he could ever conceive of before he has the chance to flee. Pansy Parkinson is the female Slytherin prefect, and Granger and Weasley are, indeed, the Gryffindor prefects. Draco hardly even notes who the other houses have as prefects, he couldn’t care less.
“Pansy…” Draco drawled in warning and felt satisfied when her drunken reflexes caused her to stumble in her heels. Blaise attempted to keep her upright but ended up stumbling himself. Not looking away from Pansy and Blaise, Draco smiled softly when he heard Millie snort in laughter.
The morning passed without Potter making his presence known. Draco slipped into his rhythm of taking and filling orders. He wasn’t ashamed that he flirted here and there to convince people to upgrade their coffee or purchase a dessert. What were a few calculated smiles and well placed bashful looks compared to the money flowing into his register. He didn’t start his business solely for the money, but Draco couldn’t escape a Malfoy’s financial know-how if he tried. Plus, people were taking the flyers Blaise dropped off earlier announcing their band’s next gig. Draco still did feel bad at how much he had neglected his friends once he became Theo’s. The band had been one of the only things keeping Draco from slipping under at times. It was hard to think he had been allowing someone to cloud the things that were important to him. Draco was ready to make things right  though and he knew getting a large crowd to their show would be a great starting off point.
“And tarnish these beautiful hands?” Blaise shoved his hands into Draco’s face, “Never.” He playfully slapped Draco’s cheek and turned to leave the room. “Meet at eclipse in an hour and do not be late!”
“Whatever are you doing here darling?” Pansy looked like the cat that caught the canary as she stalked towards the pair.
“Yup.” He said shortly, popping the “p” harshly as he tugged an apron on. He still hadn’t looked at Millie.
Draco sighed and pushed up to stand straight. He closed his eyes as he threw his arms over his head to stretch out his back and arms and brought them down on a sigh. Rolling his neck, he opened his eyes and almost screamed. Potter was standing at the counter.
“What do you mean, I’m one to talk? I can assure you I gyrated upon no one.” Millie couldn’t help but laugh.
“I’m serious,” Harry cracked a smile now moving with him on the opposite side of the counter, “go out with me.”
“When I opened the door, I saw some guy getting fucked by Theo.” Draco stopped again, trying to control his breathing to keep himself from sobbing, “Theo didn’t see me at first. The other guy did. And he looked so confused and jumped off him so quick. Theo just sat up and looked at me and didn’t say anything.” Draco had started speed talking, his emotions rolling out a pace he couldn’t control, “And I just, I just immediately went to the closet and started pulling my shit out. I can’t remember everything I yelled at him…” Draco trailed off again and wiped his eyes.
He hadn’t seemed to notice Draco yet as his eyes were still peering up at the large chalkboard plastered above Draco’s head that held their menu. Using the moment, Draco took a small breath and took him in. Potter looked…well...he looked
“Don’t give me attitude Draco. You skipped the last three rehearsals. And we have a gig coming up!” Blaise turned to look at him with his hands on his hips, exasperated at the notion.
Showering was uneventful, and it wasn’t until Draco was heading out the door, muffin in hand, that events from the night before popped back into his mind.  Draco hadn’t seen Potter in years, and he had now seen him twice in one day. Who did he think he was, popping in and saving Draco from an imbecile? Sure, Draco was drunk, but he could have handled him. And what was with the whole helping him into the car thing? And whispering into his ear? And telling him he would see him today?
Reaching the coffee shop, he whipped out his keys, unlocked the door and set about with determination to start his day and not to worry one bit about this whole Potter business.
Over the years, Draco became accustomed to, and was secretly fulfilled by, doing tasks the muggle way. His entire childhood was nothing but drills of superiority based on the fact that magic coursed through his veins. After the trials, Draco’s wand was forced under restricted access. He could use the wand for pre-determined tasks; mostly to help him finish school. At first, he resented his magic being limited; felt no better than a squib. But, once he delved into muggle society, he garnered a new appreciation for doing things without magic. He liked doing things with his hands and seeing his hard work come to fruition simply by trying hard. Plus, Draco found that the less he used it, the more attuned he became to his own magic and to magic around him. Pansy said he was wasting a gift. That was alright though. He and Pansy disagreed on most things.
In the group of students Pansy is closest to the door and she’s clearly been waiting for Draco’s return with the way she keeps glancing at the entrance. She catches the snow leopard’s eye, then looks around herself. She holds her palm out behind her back as she looks, then, when Umbridge is bent over a random spot on the floor, the open palm becomes a thumbs up.
For a moment, Weasley stiffens, staring off to the front of the Room of Requirement, and then he’s standing up straighter, still staring. The silence that has snapped over them has grown tense, the group exchanging confused glances before focusing on Weasley again.
“Apparently he’s ill. Percy is filling in for him,” Granger explains. It was an acceptable explanation, but with everything piling on top of each other Draco still felt suspicious. Not long after that he lets Granger head over to her date, who smiles as she approaches and hands her a goblet of punch.
“You boys want me to help you?” Vivian offers, still smirking, and Fred and George snap their head to look at her like she may be their guardian angel.
“What?!” Potter looks stricken and shocked, his green eyes widening into saucers, “Why would I want to hang out with you?!”
“Aye, I was,” he says after a beat. Harry must also notice how off he is because he tilts his head in question. “Gettin’ yer present. Ye know tha’.”
“I can send it in your next care package!” Max says giddily, “Eric just got his driver’s license. He’ll drive me to the store—”
“Sneaking up on people again, I see,” Draco sneers, his terror and shock morphing into anger as he tries to cover up his blunder.
It had successfully run Bagman off, which would mean a new judge would temporarily be called in for the final task from the Department of Magical Games and Sports. The last-minute nature of the call would put the task a little behind, but that was exactly what they needed.
“Yeah, like… keep people from realizing it’s going on? Disguise it?” Max says, and then they say one of the most brilliant things Draco has heard in a while. “Have you ever heard of a bait and switch?”
“Well, I figured that when we’re adults and we go exploring the world and we need a translator you can cover French and I can cover Spanish!”
“She tried to hex me!” Draco yelps in surprise at the new voice, springing away and a hand flying to his wand as he spins around. Sirius Black walks leisurely behind them, one hand tapping at his chin thoughtfully. “Lovely woman.”
“I’m sorry…” Harry begins and both Draco and Sinistra look to him, “I think I misunderstand… You’re allowing us… to have our own brooms?”
“Hush, you,” Eve says to him, hands on her hips. “We’ve still got the element of surprise. No one knows we’re here, and if we stay low we can keep it that way.”
“Never thought you’d like fat, little crybabies, Parvati,” Pansy finishes, cackling and looking far too cheerful. Like she usually did in these situations Pansy said terrible things and went along with Theodore and Millicent, but kept a far more cheerful disposition.
“Confusing?” Draco repeats, fidgeting with his long sleeve. It was getting colder outside and the manor was a tad drafty, but Draco’s winter wear was all very comfortable.
He’s still all skin and bones, and Draco isn’t sure why he expected that to change in less than an hour, but his eyes have a life to them that has doubtful been there in a long, long while.
“I would hope not,” Harry smirks, a little laughter returning to his voice, and Draco looks at him sharply. The Gryffindor just shrugs. “But there’s different kinds of caring, Draco. Different kinds of…” here Harry pauses, looking startled at himself, then he’s glancing away. “Different kinds of love. One isn’t superior over the other. If it’s there, it’s there, and it’s important that we nurture and care for it.”
“Malfoy, do us all a favor and catch that bloody Snitch already so we can be done with this,” Flint tells Draco on their way back onto the field. Draco says nothing, but he nods. He was doing his best, but even a professional Seeker would have issues in this weather.
Draco’s brows must be somewhere in the stratosphere with how high he’s raised them, shocked by the turn of events. “Well… I can see the logical conclusion that occlumency would be beneficial to you…” Draco admits very carefully, because the angry expression on Harry’s face feels like a minefield. “However, I do not see how they could believe assigning you Uncle Severus would be such a good idea. The man blatantly despises you, and you need a calm teacher to work on occlumency.”
One of the “sat-e-lite” radios that Max’s father had been showing off earlier in the day now sits in his grasp and Draco isn’t sure why.
Apparently, Theodore had found her the day prior and had snuck out table scraps for the little thing. It was positively adorable, if pathetic, and Draco and Pansy had quickly crouched on the ground around Theodore to pet her.
“Max, if you don’t tell me then I’ll just figure it out from Eric or your parents,” Draco growls, clutching the radio tightly.
Draco groans and rolls his eyes skyward, asking some higher power for strength, before looking back at Potter with a bland expression. “As I recall, in second year our dear Ginny Weasley was actually possessed by the Dark Lord. If anyone knows what it’s like to be possessed by him, it’s her.”
“You’re paying attention to me, are you? How sweet,” except his tone is anything but sweet, and Potter scowls a little deeper, looking away. Draco glares at him, waiting for him to say something else foolish or to leave, but for a while Potter remains silent, looking anywhere but at Draco.
Draco can’t be too upset, though, since his own arms had found their way around Potter’s shoulders and were squeezing his head so close to his body that Draco had to check he hadn’t strangled the boy in the night.
“You want to hang out more… after all this is over?” Potter questions. He seems baffled, just a little bit, but mostly he looks incredibly pleased judging by the smile slowly growing on his face.
Tracey looks back at Luna and tilts her head, curious. “What if someone saw a death in a moving picture? Could they see thestrals?”
Draco’s first response is to ask what the fuck that kind of answer is, especially when they are just talking about snails, but the look on Longbottom’s face stills the Slytherin. Max begins groaning about being a terrible, snail-torturing person, but Draco isn’t paying attention. Longbottom looks distant and drawn in at the same time. It is clear that whatever Longbottom had been thinking about when he made that comment, it ran a lot deeper than where Draco and Max had been.
The older boy looks at him strangely, lips twisting like he thinks the question is insane, but he at least answers. “I’m listening to music… It’s a CD player… How do you
He didn’t cry too often over the radio, but after that he still lost count. Sometimes he was handed off to another member of Max’s family who was better suited for the particular problem. Eric was great with things to do with anxiety while Max’s father was just good at making Draco smile again. Max was good at simply calming Draco down enough to talk, but Max’s mother was the true MVP.
“No room my ass,” Harry says back with a grin, tossing his stuff up to the holding space above. He then plops down on Draco’s side, still grinning, until Draco reaches up to poke his nose until it wrinkles. The bespectacled boy splutters, shaking out his head, and Draco smirks.
Then the troll is raising its club with its other hand and Draco has only a second to bend his body upward to avoid the sideways swing of the weapon. Draco flops back, still hanging, and tries not to start hyperventilating when he realizes he had almost lost his head.
, appearing humanoid but distinctly not, and whatever face it might have is hooded in shadow, but it is definitely
“Do you think it’s spying on us?” Ada questions and Draco scoffs, giving her an unimpressed look. She glances over and immediately looks defensive at his expression. “What? What else could it be?”
Draco’s own hands move, running his palms down Harry’s legs, then back up again until they twitch. His long fingers pry further upward, up under Harry’s shirt, and feel over the lion’s twitching stomach muscles.
Draco, left alone, attempts to go back to his photography, but he can’t help the nervous twisting in his gut at what is to come.
He never finds out why Potter was so upset. None of them say a single word for the rest of the evening and all Potter does is chew at their licorice wands. His face does keep morphing through a series of complex emotions. Mostly he seems shocked, drawn in and void, but occasionally his eyes scrunch up like he’s fighting tears, or he frowns so deeply in thought it looks like he’ll develop sagging jowls, or his face twists in such vicious, unadulterated
Draco takes a moment to consider the question. He wasn’t being asked some greater, philosophical question here. He was being asked why he, individually, fought in his life. Why did he work to stay alive?
“So, while we were there over Easter Break, Potter had the brilliant idea to remove the entire wall,” Draco says, then glares at his cup again. “Honestly, Eve, it’s not a cone. They must have had spoons.”
They’ve done this before, it shouldn’t be hard anymore, but Weasley turns out to be a bigger hazard than they could have guessed.
Draco lowers the letter when he’s done with it and hardly even bats an eye when Ada makes grabby hands at him and he passes it to her.
Sure, Draco didn’t know what “battery-“ or “solar- powered” meant, but he was certain it all was related to “e-lek-try-city,” so what was the point? Malfoy Manor was filled with old and new magic alike, the radio didn’t stand a chance.
“Thank you, young master,” Tana bows, and then she’s gone. Draco stands by his closet for a few, long moments, staring at the spot the house elf had disappeared from and massaging his temples. House elves were weird…
“It’s just…” Hermione starts, but then she trails off and looks away. Draco waits for a second for her to continue, but when she doesn’t he steps a little closer to her and nudges her shoulder with his.
When they make it down to the Slytherin common room Harry collapses on one of the couches, looking tired but ultimately content for the day, while Draco goes to grab some of his school supplies and start on some homework.
“Their choices are not your business! And you JUST SAID they should just go out and get a job, but then tell them they’re hopeless anyway! You are such a hypocrite!” That was Max’s new favorite word. “Hypocrite.” Draco had been impressed at first, but once it started getting thrown at him, he’d become significantly less happy.
The blonde blinks at him, brows raised, before he scoffs and flicks his head, nose going up. “Of course it is! I never had any doubt of that,” he says, knowing he sounds snobbish and not caring, especially when Draco looks back over at Harry to smirk and finds the other boy’s smile has turned blinding.
“No room, my ass,” he says and it all feels fairly familiar. He plops down beside Draco, Weasley on Potter’s other side, and Granger sits beside Eve and across from Draco.
“Stop saying maybe. Just spit it out,” Draco snaps, glaring at Longbottom, and the tall boy gulps and gathers every bit of his supposed Gryffindor courage.
“Well… If you have good, happy memories, then you have more incentive to survive, yes? And, vice versa, if you fight to survive with all your might, you have more opportunity to build a true and happy life,” Granger offers.
“Another spell that may be of assistance,” Draco flips through the pages again, coming to a stop on a smaller spell that only takes up half a page, “is the Hermes Charm. It creates whirlwinds under the castor’s feet that allow them to glide along the floor.”
Draco, though, quite liked the cold, and the greying, chilly atmosphere really was beautiful. With a brand-new disposable camera in hand - Max had sent him a new one for the year since, apparently, they were cheap and “disposable for a reason” - he snapped photo after photo of the lake, the forest in the distance, the castle. He even managed to get a picture of one of the giant squid’s tentacles breaching the surface of the lake for a moment.
Just then the bathroom door opens and Blaise reenters. All three boys look over at him in alarm, and he looks back. He catches sight of the little, brown snake curling around Draco’s hand, stares at it for a very long time, then looks at Draco with an arched brow. “You really were meant for Slytherin, weren’t you?” he questions, the first thing Draco has heard him say yet, then he shakes his head and turns to his bed, mumbling, “Pet snakes… jeez.”
Draco is nodding along, climbing back into his seat after McGonagall, but then the words sink in and he pauses, brows shooting into his bangs. “Wait, wait, what? Did you just say 17 and 29?” he questions, looking between the elder witch and the goblin in disbelief. “THAT’S how you decided to divvy up your currency? With two prime numbers?” McGonagall is giving him an odd look, apparently not seeing any issue here, and Draco scowls slightly. “You must see how illogical that is! That means…” Draco pauses to do the math in his head. Luckily, he always liked math. “There are 493 Knuts in a Galleon! How… what… why?”
Draco stands there for a long, silent moment, his expression schooled and hand idly running down Lucky’s flank. He watches the Gryffindor, standing there, amidst his fears and thoughts, but not running away. He watches the Gryffindor who was able to admit he wasn’t ready, but he didn’t want to give up either.
Potter looks especially smug, even if his glasses are askew. “Serves you right,” Potter snarks. Draco rolls his eyes and reaches up, as if to readjust Potter’s glasses, but ends up taking them away instead. Potter yelps yet again, but Draco puts them on his own face before they can get nabbed.
“No, the Goblet does not retain this information. What it did tell me, however, was why your name emerged.”
Eventually, though, Potter ends up pressing his side into Draco’s, seeming unaware he is even doing it, and he rests his head in his folded arms on the table.
Potter reaches out to take the book Draco offers to him, looking it over with wide eyes. “Your Dark Arts book? Isn’t this your baby, or something?”
“Don’t give the Time-Turner more than five turns,” Granger warns, offering significantly more helpful advice.
“What are you, then?” Weasley asks, “Please say a ferret. Please tell me he attacked a Death Eater as a ferret.”
” Draco says sharply, sticking “Basket Case” by Green Day in her head. She turns around and immediately fires “Remember the Time” by Michael Jackson into Draco’s head. They glare at each other, silent, then go back to their readings, not wanting to draw Pince’s attention with any flashier hexes.
“Sirius has already taken advantage of that, too,” Potter chuckles and he and Draco share a small smile, before finally they go back to what they had been working on before.
“People can make anything look official if they work at it enough. I should know,” Mrs Nubble, a lawyer, and a very good one, says. She was trying to be gentle, which Draco supposes is nice of her, but he wants to see that letter.
Still, Draco sees the hesitant, angry pinch to Harry’s eyes and he wishes they were in a situation where Draco could ease them.
“How are we supposed to go back?” Millicent calls, apparently coming to the same realization and looking rightly terrified. “Our common room and the troll are in the same spot!”
late over in America and they should let Max go to get some sleep, but Draco would definitely be contacting them again later in the day for a much longer conversation.
It is during a DA meeting, Draco talking in hushed tones with the twins, when Daphne and Astoria Greengrass approach Harry. The lesson hasn’t started yet, everyone getting settled and joining their friends, but the Slytherin sisters look like they are on a mission.
That last one was pretty shocking. Of all the Gryffindor boys of this year, Ronald Weasley seemed the second least qualified to be made prefect, Longbottom being dead last. Most qualified, from Draco’s very logical and unbiased perspective, would probably have been Dean Thomas, who was levelheaded and generally pleasant to be around, so long as he didn’t try to approach Draco, and would hardly have as much on his mind as any of the Golden Trio.
“Be quiet, Ron,” Granger snaps and Weasley backs up, hands in surrender. It really does look like the girl will blow something with how hard she’s focusing on the feather in front of her, one hand out and pointing three fingers at the offending object.
Draco, finally finding his voice, points back at the way Blaise had left. “You told him we were dating?”
Sirius had also believed Draco had made the right choice in keeping all the details to himself, that Potter had enough to focus on with the Triwizard Tournament, and Draco intended to continue that trend until absolutely necessary.
“Now, hold on jus’ a moment,” Hagrid is saying, looking completely lost as Draco pulls his camera back out and offers a charming smile up at him. Potter and Granger, meanwhile, skirt around the wall to a nearby window to watch outside, looking jumpy as they murmur to each other.
Narcissa makes sure the workers at the robes shop know not to let Draco out of their sight, gives him a kiss on the cheek, then hurries off. Draco is almost immediately ushered up onto a stool, robes floating over his head as the workers get to work. He’s familiar with this process, thankfully, and he allows his mind to wander as pins stick into the robes, sizing them perfectly.
“Why could Dumbledore not have taught you, though? He seems like a better suited instructor, if you ask me.” At Harry’s tense silence Draco has his answer, along with a new feeling of rage bubbling up in his gut. “He is
But, just a few hours later, they are awoken by the other Slytherin boys arriving and beginning to get ready for bed. It’s properly time for bed, now, but that’s not the first thought in Draco’s head.
“A decent number, I guess,” Theodore replies. His full attention has been, thankfully, on Lucky this entire time, allowing Draco to not have to control his shocked facial expressions. “A few people are even kind of angry, I hear.”
There are definite tears rolling down Harry’s cheeks. Draco has only ever seen the boy cry once before and it had been broken down wailing and sobbing. This soft misery breaks his heart with every breath.
“It is educational,” Draco berates on instinct. As silly as Muggles may be, a museum is a museum and it deserves some respect.
“I am questioning the ideals we have been raised by, yes,” Draco says carefully. He didn’t want them telling Umbridge he was actually against her. With that woman present everything was so much more difficult. “I still know opportunity when I see it, however, so I would recommend you mind your business.”
“What’s wrong?” Draco asks as he begins working out the physical motions of the Stone Wall Defense. Harry, for a moment, just stands beside him, before joining in.
Harry growls loudly, hands coming up to pull at his hair in his mounting frustration, before he’s forcing them back down and turning away from all of them. “We’ll need to go back through the Hall of Prophecy,” he growls, starting to take the lead, but Draco is quick to trot ahead of him. He stops, though, when Harry grabs his tail roughly, making the snow leopard swing around and growl at him.
“Well, we can use these cloaks to get everyone to the Ministry floos. They don’t need floo powder for return trips, right?” Draco grunts an affirmative and Blaise continues. “Right, well, we go two at a time, one person drops off the second person, then comes back to pick up someone else. We’ll be able to go even faster with two of these.”
The rock polisher was donated, the resin kits were thrown out, and the model planes were destroyed. The only one they didn’t react violently to had been the tigers and the zoo, but Draco would have been shocked if animal-lover Max actually ended up boycotting the zoo.
“Yes. Undersecretary Umbridge was at her Ministry office a few days ago and called me up for tea,” Lucius begins, pristinely cutting into a finely seasoned roast on his plate.
“OKAASAN!” Eve shrieks, mortified, as Draco and Harry yelp and spring apart, their eyes huge and surprised by the sudden bluntness of it all. “They’re fifteen!”
“Uh oh,” Draco grunts sarcastically, finally turning his head to look at Harry. The Gryffindor is laying on his side, facing the Slytherin, and he looks… thoughtful?
“How’d you manage to do it, then? It would surely take a powerful spell to alter the Goblet of Fire. Why, maybe even a dark spell,” Draco purrs, following Potter as he shoves past him. The boy had been locked up, talking with all the judges for the Triwizard Tournament, probably begging for forgiveness for a long while now, and Draco had nearly fallen asleep waiting.
Draco takes a deep breath and begins to retell his story to Dumbledore, with a few excluded points. He tells Dumbledore that he had been up at the Astronomy Tower after hours, taking photos, and doesn’t mention the Animagus Potion. He recounts seeing two figures in the distance, the flash of green he was now certain had been a Killing Curse, and his rush down.
as well and he was beginning to wonder if Muggles were… okay. Did they need help? Was a mass group therapy session in order?
“Says who? I bet his voice was cracking all over the place beforehand,” Draco scoffs. His voice certainly had…
“Your traditions? Were you going to say your traditions? I bet you were about to say your traditions. Because you’re always talking about your
It makes logical sense. Draco discovered the Militus Charm, pushed for everyone to learn it, and was the first of all of them to figure it out. He understands the charm better than anyone here. Granger, of course, was the second to master the charm, rather quickly too, and who had just as much book knowledge of it as Draco.
“Ron,” Harry whispers weakly, expression pinched with displeasure. Draco knew Harry wasn’t a big fan of Hermione either, but he’d never made any scathing remarks about her and seemed especially disappointed with Ron’s.
Harry’s eyes widen comically, his glasses crooked from how he’s been laying down, and Draco half-consciously slips the glasses off and sets them on the side table like it is second nature. “YOU know occlumency?!” Harry questions, baffled.
“Clam it, you! I can hear your pompous exasperation from here. I don’t know exactly what we’ll do, just that it has to do with SPACE! I’ll make sure to tell you about it all afterwards.”
Granger was the only one who had managed to form her Militus besides the Slytherin. Draco had been expecting some kind of yappy dog, at best, and had even been joking about it for some time beforehand, but then the muggleborn had stated the incantation and out lumbered the dark, menacing form of a grizzly bear.
“Are you sure they’re moving towards us and not just… going past?” Leandra ventures, ever hopeful, but Weasley’s expression isn’t promising and dread is quickly inching up Draco’s spine.
Before Draco can respond to that, probably demand how Eve can be so flippant about possibly being abandoned by her own mother, the compartment door opens to reveal Gryffindor’s Golden Trio.
“They were taken, and developed, using Muggle means. Any tampering done would be immediately detectable by anyone half decent in magic,” Draco says sharply, then smirks thinly and bows his head, “Sir.”
“I just think you’re trying to avoid my riddle, silly peasant,” Draco sighs for show, like he’s disappointed. Riddles and word puzzles could distract Max on occasion, if they were invigorating enough. They didn’t last long, though, on account of Max always losing focus. “Don’t try and change the subject. What has four legs in the morning, two in the afternoon, and three in the evening?”
This place, teaching these kids, really was Harry’s element. The ease at which Harry fell into his role as teacher, even when he was stressed, was admirable. And now… the pride Harry was showing wasn’t even for himself, it was for someone else. That kind of positivity… it could really change a kid’s life.
When they get to the compartment it is already deserted. Even Draco’s bags are gone, which he can only assume is Leandra’s influence. Eve wouldn’t have gotten them for Draco, but Leandra could have convinced her it was the right thing to do.
Weasley groans, rolling his eyes skyward. “If I ever randomly burst into song, just kill me there,” he says, clearly not excited at the very idea of a musical, which Draco thinks is uncalled for. Musicals were spectacular affairs. Even Max liked them. Called them “totally awesome.”
” he says clearly, like he’s done every morning and evening since the full moon nearly an entire month ago. So much for storm season, since it took the weather this long to get to this point…
“Not the Unforgiveables,” Potter says firmly, eyes narrowing as he looks at Draco like he may turn on him at any second, which is terribly rude.
“Correct. Five points to Gryffindor,” Sinistra says simply and Hermione lets out a sigh of relief. “What are the origins of the name ‘Astronomy’?” Oh, she wasn’t messing around, was she? She was just jumping right into the next question.
Sure, there were the bad eggs, the truly bad eggs, who thrived on discourse and cruelty, and maybe Draco had been like that his first few years at Hogwarts, but those were just the loudest of the bunch. And, unfortunately, it seemed they were the only ones everyone outside of Slytherin liked to pay attention to.
He’s never seen Potter grin quite as widely, quite as purely, as he does in that moment. It’s like the sun had stepped onto the mortal plain for a visit. Draco’s fingers twitch, part of him wanting to snap a photo, but he holds back.
“I suggested we get Colin Creevey,” Granger explains, which is precisely who would make more sense than Draco, “But I recalled magical photography can occasionally be tampered with by unique spells, which we do not know, but Fudge does not currently trust us and would surely use it against us.” Fudge? As in the Minister?!
Harry has leant towards his duffel bag and is gently searching through it for any other snakes, but thankfully finds none. So, it’s just Muddy, then. At least there’s that.
“I changed my own mind. Even in captivity, allowing my hatred to fester only did me harm. I am fully aware that most humans would not even know of my existence, let alone endorse my treatment.”
The other fifth year boys are already in their dorm, ready for bed, save for Theodore who is standing in the bathroom doorway with his toothbrush in his mouth. They all appear to be in the middle of hushed conversation, then immediately drop off when Draco steps in.
More, long windows look out into the lake along the wall, and a circular alcove, much too small for a person, is dug out to the far right with what looks like a circular tunnel leading up and out of the room. Feathers lay at the base of the alcove and Draco realizes, after a few beats, that owls must use this tunnel to get down to them when needed.
“I’m not sure…” Draco admits, quiet. If anything, it looked like emotional damage, and he wasn’t even sure if it was recent. The Dursley’s clearly didn’t like magic, but they also looked like they feared it. In addition, ever since first year, Potter had been looking better and better. Still damaged, and always a bit paler at the beginning of the school year, but he had clothes and meals and friends now.
Draco pauses, brows furrowing. “Spirit animal?” That sounded slightly like a Patronus, which was not at all what Draco was attempting to ask about.
“Harry and me saw them, too,” Ginny says with a groan, rolling her eyes. To Draco’s knowledge Ginny did not know Eve well at all, but if she had been with Potter it wouldn’t be outside the realm of possibilities for him to have sought out a seat with her.
“Of course. Thank you, Miss. Ebru,” Draco nods, pinning the pin to the lapel of the trench coat his mother had gotten him with the expanded pockets.
“What is your problem, huh?! You don’t like being out of control? You want everything to be perfect according to YOUR standards?”
“Speak for yourself,” Eve snorts, sitting in a chair with Leandra perched on her legs. The Hufflepuff girl still looks flustered about that, which clearly makes Eve exceptionally pleased.
“We went to school together,” Malfoy said with a slight blush covering his face. “Where’s your list of names and addresses?” he commented.
“I wish it was. I really do.” This time Harry’s voice was quiet, causing another silence to fill the air.
Malfoy glanced at Harry for a lifeline. Harry opened his eyes wide, hoping to portray an ‘I dunno’ message, causing the grey eyes to constrict.
“I am sorry, for nearly killing you, but same time not sorry,” Harry admitted as he nervously rubbed the back of his head.
“But.” Draco said. It wasn’t a question, rather a statement. He tried to remain relaxed, but something deep down unnerved him.
Draco had taken the chance to head into the dining room, still rubbing his leg. He was already sorting boxes when Harry arrived. Draco hadn’t said a single word since the incident. From his current body language, it was near impossible to tell what he was thinking. Unsure what he should say or do, Harry silently helped him crush boxes. Slowly turning the place back into a dining room from the storage hub it had been.
However, he didn’t get far before Harry gripped his arm, pulling him back down. Draco could feel his face going red. He threw his head back against the sofa rest, looking at the ceiling. “I wanted an excuse to talk to you.”
To think he was voluntarily leaving Draco alone when only the other day he was on the edge of panic at the idea of Draco left unsupervised in his house. How had things changed in such a short amount of time?
“Oh. Hey. Nagini?! Are you really acting like finding the Dark Lord's, once-dead-now-alive-snake in our room is no big deal?!" he practically shouted.
Teddy had been full-on since he found out the boys would be staying with Ginny till Christmas Eve. Harry knew it was just down to him being bored however he was already struggling to deal with it.
Changing the topic with a distraction technique, Harry knew it well. Inspecting Malfoy’s actions and face as he handed over the list, the slight pink blush got worse when he spotted Harry staring.
He still wasn’t sure what to make of it, While it was Albus handwriting, he had followed the dots; it was Harry’s handwriting. So had Harry been inviting him through Albus? However this was back before they were a thing, they weren’t even a thing now.
Hearing a low chuckle, he glanced up in time to see Malfoy shaking his head, smiling down at the coloured paper in his hands, as he set up the boys, including pulling out an extensive collection of pens all in rainbow order. The big fancy kind, that as a child Harry remembered looking at in shops and wishing he could own.
He regretted leaving so early and wondered if Harry would hate him for it, at the time he had panicked. Draco crashed his head against the wall once more. He couldn’t do this dating malarky. It was too complicated, He’d never done it before. The arranged marriage to Astoria meant he had to do very little. Biting his finger nail, the sound of the kitchen door opening made him stand up straight, only to relax a few seconds later when he realised it was only a magic-ed tray taking out the first lot of starters.
The pair dissolving into an awkward silence, listening to the shouts and splattering of snow around them.
Teddy huffed once more, pretending to paw at the ground. “Sorry, Uncle Dray. Rhinos can charge at 30mph.” He mumbled head still looking down. Before he turned and charged back down the corridor up the steps.
Malfoy meanwhile wasn’t convinced, just raising an eyebrow and slightly tilting his head to the side while continuing to stare at Harry.
Draco’s heart stopped. That was far too much information for him. This family was going to be the end of him. He was sure of that.
Lily nodded. “I was just shocked, I knew something was gonna happen, but I didn’t expect him to just try and leave right in front of us.” Harry never outright disrespected Lily. James made a noise in agreement.
Harry dived in the water, deciding to keep his current form, least he’d scare his mate. He also kept a bubble of air around his head, he needed to breath.
“Yes sir.” They both sounded sad and walked out the room, but they were not even supposed to be close to Harry’s area at all. James sighed,
James stood with Lily, and watched over the icy waters, distantly wondering how Harry was feeling. When he reached his Mature Stage, it had come and passed, lasting a full day. He remembers his body aching up and down so much that he could not move. He slept most of the day, and when he did wake up, he just stared at the room ceiling before closing his eyes again. But he never did feel a pull like...
James made a noise. I t was too soon to say anything. With the Mature Stage and with the way Harry was acting, They needed more information to guess anything. But he already knows, and he’s sure that Lily knows too.
Without pausing, he started swimming back to the top, desperately aching for air to get to his lungs. He wasn’t really a good swimmer, but at the moment it doesn’t matter. His life was at stake. He could tell from the rush in the water, the monster was right behind him.
He opened the large wooded front door to the sound of heavy rain beating down on the street and felt his heart drop. Looking out into the flooded streets and dark grey skies, he wondered how he couldn’t notice the weather when he first awoke and quickly dismissed that thought as he remembered that the  already soundproof walls of his large house were as thick as giant pine trees and the fact that he didn’t open his dark curtain to peek outside in his panic. He let out a groan, reaching his hand up to rub his forehead.
Walking ahead, he noticed that there were no visible footprints that he could see in the sand around him but his own. There was a deep circle-like imprint around where he had laid, but not obvious as to who put him there. He frowned, puzzled. There wasn’t a note or anything on the small island, it didn’t even look as if anyone lived there.
Draco was smart, one of the smartest kids in his school, much less his grade, so college was not out of his way. He knows that if you want a successful life, you’re going to need a successful career to back that up. He wants to go to college, but he also wants to use this chance to get from under his parents and distance himself away from them. Since he was able to walk, talk, and read, he started seeing less and less of them. He doesn’t even remember how tall his father was than how tall he himself is compared to his father or even how his mother sounded.
Draco was losing conscious fast. Whatever it was that was dragging him down and down to the sea floor, wasn’t being gentle with his body, and his air was running out.
“Harry,” she said in a calm and patient voice, ignoring what he said and keeping his attention on her. His eyes went straight to her, glowing. “We’ve been through this before. There is no one there. What you are feeling is your perimeter getting bigger. Things like that are completely normal after you have passed the Mature stage.” Lily started confidently.
That’s probably because he can’t feel anything. Well that’s not true, he feels something, but not what he’d expected at the time.
Something wet and warm dripped on his lap. He turned his attention back to the man, his focus should have never strayed in the first place, and saw that he was much closer, his nose grazed his own. He flinched back in fear, the man lips were dripping red, and pressed together.
Anna immediately straightened and sped-walked to the icy water where Harry disappeared into, while Alexander fell to the ground. “Thanks, dad. It was nice
“They had to have drug me...,” Harry made the mistake of shifting a hoof, wanting to provide comfort. His mates’ eyes snapped to him. “What are you? Who are you? Where am I? What did you mean by ‘mate?’”
He didn’t respond to the question, not really, but his eyes faintly lowered to his lips and back up with darker eyes than before. Draco felt heat wash over his face. No one he knew ever willing looked at him like that – like they want to gobble him up. Draco’s’ mind sped up, and he bunched up his hands in the soft cotton sheets that he thought about the reason they were there; he hated them and wanted them gone.
there. But not nearly as strong as it was before, want him to scratch his head bloody. It felt quiet, subdued in a way, asleep but ready to wake, for he was where he was supposed to be. With whom he was supposed to be with. He would have been here earlier, if it wasn’t for his smart but stubborn lady of a mother and avoided unnecessary harm to his mate.
Draco’s eyebrows furrowed. “I’m safe now. Besides, I don’t like causing unnecessary pain to others.”
“You don’t know how he would have acted.” James interrupted, shaking his head. “We told you this. While everyone goes through this stage, everyone also behaves different. Now that Harry is settled and rested, and
Can problems be solve by ignoring the problem, going around the problem, become apart of the problem, help the problem, or ask the problem questions about the problem??
After a moment, he didn’t feel the pain of sharp teeth biting into his body. He opened his eyes, expecting to see red dripping into the blue of the water.
“Harry is a strong person, gifted and blessed with his magic, we know that.” Nothing James thought could argue against that, after all, he was there when Harry was born.
His skin was a warm caramel color that had faint and sharp pale blue cracks wrapped around his arms and all over his skin, all the way to his muscled thighs. There was some kind of cloth wrapped around his lower waist. He had muscles and was buff but not much, but Draco knew if he wanted, he could hold him down with breaking a sweat. He was halfway crouched over Draco, as if he didn’t want to trap him in place, but also didn’t want to be too far.
Unable to move, he watched as the mysterious man gently lifted his hand, and looking as if he has got expensive wine, licked, and sucked on the dripping cut on Draco’s hand. His mouth dropped open, and something stirred low in his gut. The man groaned low in the throat as he continued to suck on his finger, a faint pink blush across his face, and his eyes closed. Draco frowned his eyebrows in confusion and weary. He whispered, “W-what are you doing? Stop.”
“Someone’s here!” Harry suddenly said loudly, jumping out the body of water, his body reforming in the air for his feet to touch the ground. “I’m feeling a pull from somebody in that direction.” He waved his arm to the far right as he rapidly walked, His skin still moist from his nap. His face and skin were also a pale blue as it always was when he formed his body back to quickly. His eyes were a swirling mess of cerulean and lush green, letting Lily know that he still wasn’t settled right yet.
Lily blinked, slowly turning from the cooking station, bemusement in her face and put down the sharp ware. She brought her hands up a placing manner, not making fast movements and came a little forward to coming into the sitting/eating room where James was. She tilted her head and glanced at James, as he put his paper book down but stayed seated in his sitting.
Sorry for the wait. I wasn't sure if I wanted to post a type of messing and wild kiss that leaves someone knocked out. (Sigh)
tried to eat me, and now I’m seeing talking shapes made of water...” His voice was high, but not squeaky. Harry already missed having his weight on his back.
.” Her strong voice, filled with will, conviction and power ranged out. Her magic quick to respond. A smoke-like fog lifted from her lips and entered Harry’s ears. His body instantly froze, his magic though powerful, was unable to block the sudden and unexpected intrusion of hers’ in his body. Although Harry’s magic would usually never fight Lily’s’ as it knows where it came from, it's source.
His mate let out a groan and tried to shake his arms to move his hands but couldn’t. His mate wasn’t a strong person, from the thinness of his arms, but he also wasn’t weak. His hand trailed over his chest, and stomach. He was perfect for him. His mate was his, and only his. The water around them surged.
there while you guys handled Big Bro.” He huffed and puffed, looking like he desperately needed air.
The creature didn’t bother answering, his head still turned to Draco. Draco can’t see if it has eyes, but it has a long snout, kind of like a horse.
Stars erupted around his vision as he was deprived of his air. With a fleeting groan, he was rushed away into darkness.
want something to stop if it feels good – no, it’s confusing his mind. Was it the kiss or the person behind that made it feel
He would wake up to presents and gifts by his bedside on his birthday or any special occasion, which felt like every day. Food was sometimes just delivered to the house already paid for or a high-end chef wound come and personally prepare and cook the food right in front of him. He knew it was from them, without asking. The chefs never talked to him at all, just cooked and left. One he had talked to; he grew to like his company.
“How do you know my name?!” Draco asked, and glanced around. He needed to stall the man for time while he looked for some way to escape. He looked around without trying to be obvious, but he was in a closed off room that only have a few windows that looked to be blocked by water. An underwater room. His heart sunk, so much for trying to run, and it wasn’t possible to swim, as the man could turn into some water horse creature.
The feeling popped back, as if it never left. The pull...but this time, it was stronger. The need to go there was stronger, and without his mother there to stop him, he can.
Stepping over the small but sharp rocks and moved in the water ‘til it was a few inches over his feet. The water was so clear and blue that he could see his shoes as he walked. He bent down to rinse off his hand, his blood slipping steadily in the large mass of clear and bright water.
$200 were left on the dining room table every week, without fail. Although he didn’t want to touch it, it helped pay for field trips, and whenever he wanted or needed on the spot. Things he needed (phone bill, clothing, toothpaste, and mouthwash) were always paid ahead of time, and things he’d want (new video games, shoes, candy) were already in the house in their respectable spot.
He bent, motioning his head to his mates’ bleed hand, ignoring how to red shined brightly in his eyes. He wanted to lick it all up.
“What are you doing?! Who are you?!” Draco needed his to talk. If he did, it would put a pause on whatever he’s preparing to him. His chest filled with anticipation; What’s gonna happen to him?
It was large, clear, and blue, and about the size of a house. From where he was sitting on it's back, he couldn’t see the face of the water creature, but from the way it chuffed and snorted its nose, it was annoyed.
The water creature just looked at him for a few seconds. The dragon was roaring now, loudly, and it made Draco twitchy. “Please.” He begged.
He stood up, to look for a broken stick or something but saw nothing. He walked closer towards the sand near the water and kneeled to dig around in the sand. He small yelp escaped his mouth, and he snatched back his hand. A small drop of blood was sliding down his pointer finger. Narrowing his eyes, he popped his bloody finger in his mouth, and moved the sand with his other hand to see what caused his bleeding. There about 2 inches in the sand, were about 3 shark teeth of different sizes. He grinned. He could use these as weapons if he were careful. But now, he needed to rinse the blood off.
He lifted his wet hand to his chin and tilted it closer to look in his now wide beautiful eyes. “And I meant that, My little mate.”
Then there was a splash, and all he could see was huge and dirty teeth before he was dragged under the water.
Hopeless, He couldn’t move as the man once again ignored his questions and grabbed his arm to keep him still. Draco was pulled even closer and started to thrash wildly and fight. He wanted nothing of what the mysterious and creepy man was gonna give him. “Let me go!” he yelled.
His lips were so soft and warm, colliding with Draco’s, and even though he was protesting to it, Draco could feel everything he was doing, and it heated up his body even more. His teeth were lightly nibbling and when his sharp tongue swept across his lips, asking for entrance, Draco unconsciously opened.
His room was filled with water, for him; the water from his room was connected to the large ocean from a window. Gathering pressure, he pressed the button to release the window, to more and open water. As soon as the window was up, he tasted a sweet metallic in the water, coming from the same direction of the pull.
Harry slowly drifted next to the bed. His mate made a noise, confused, and looked around. “What are you doing? Where am I?”
Sorry about the summary, didn't know what to put without giving anything away. Just people clicking on my story makes me so happy. Please comment what you think... Hope you enjoy.
When touching a large mass of water, as Harry was connecting to it, he could dissolve his form, and still be there, anywhere in this water. But sometimes, it also made things extremely easy to do multiple things at once. With the thought of wanting to touch his mate even now, he couldn’t stop himself.
With his mate here, it would be better to get him somewhere safe before having an all-out battle, even if Harry was sure he’ll win. His mate comes first, with everything.
Draco saw it blink, kinda. The water in the face area made movement. Its head moved closer, to see him better.
the bag was one of the perks of having rich people who made his existence possible but worked too much to say an easy ‘good morning’. But anyways...
He nodded. It was the only explanation of him not being in the city, a thousand miles away from home. As he didn’t see his book bag and phone, the ones who took him had to have dropped it. So, no way to call someone, even if he would have got a signal. He sighed, his parents might not notice him missing ‘til later, but he told Pansy that he was coming today, and he would never go back on his word. She knows that if he did, it would not be from choice.
Draco’s heart thumped so loud; it muted his hearing. He could barely breath, his mind was fuzzy. He cannot put together a single thought, much less function right now. His body was hot and overheating.
He frowned and turned the water back off in disappointment. His parent had important and private jobs. He knew that. But having to wake up and even go to sleep by himself made him feel bitter and lonely. Draco basically raised himself, and does not hide the fact, he embraces it with honor.
He followed its gaze to notice that a large, dark green dragon was thrashing as it was tangled in ropes made of water, roaring in anger. Draco stared at the teeth in fear, they were the ones he saw when he was dragged below.
But what he saw was something he couldn’t explain. Whatever it was that was holding him up, was made of water. It was like some kind of densely thick gel. But the shape was strange.
Draco shook his head. He needed to focus on the present. If he was dropped off on this island, then he could safely assume that whoever brought him here, would come back to get him. He needed to try and get off the island before they come back. Or at least find some way to depend himself.
Harry slowly galloped through the front room, closest to the opening water, and went towards the back. He knew his mate was looking around curiously. Harry loved water, it made up of half of his body and magic, but he wanted some human things; he did have a separate area if he wanted to walk or sleep in his human form. One of his beds were siting on a small island of wood while surrounded by water on the open floor. The bed was large and a pearl white, with cushions. Harry often liked to dive in the water after sleeping in his human form.
the water horses’ words popped in his mind, sounding of regret, and sorrow and longing. The horse shuffled a little, wanting to move.
Harry was not always sure when he is awake or not. A dormant state, his father once said, easily to wake up at times, and not. He can’t just open his eyes...
He’s eyes snapped open as the heat he felt on his face also went to his hand. The man softly unclenched his hand from the sheets that were a faint red. He blinked; my hand was still bleeding. Draco snapped up his head as he saw movement, the man was opening his smooth pink lips to reveal white pearly teeth, and a luscious tongue.
Draco peered up to the water creature, curiously. It was tensed, from how it's neck stood with strong muscles. It was causing the dragon pain and he didn't seem to stop anytime soon.
waters, it was an easy distraction. But now that it was just them two there, his mate had all his attention...
James sighed, rubbing his forehead. This whole situation was a mess. He turned back to the frozen kids and canceled his magic over them.
It wasn’t hard to form the outline of his human body behind his mate and still concentrate on getting home quickly, without running into anyone. He could feel his chest lean close to his mates’ back, and felt him jump in shock, making a noise of confusion. He slowly crept his hands up his arms and over the strange cloth on his chest, grabbing and dug his head in the side of his neck, huffing in his ear with want.
The house was always cleaned, around the times he would be gone for school. He came back to the faint smell of ocean breeze cleaning products, even if he cleaned while he was there anyway. At least they remember what scent he preferred.
Harry thought and calmed himself, settling his hands around his waist and willed them to move no further. His mate huffed weakly. Harry didn’t know what he could and couldn’t feel with the uncompleted bond between them, but Harry knew what he wanted to.
That and the fact that i'm starting an overnight job fulltime....anyway, let me know what you think. I was scratching my head at this chapter.
Lily gave a faint shrug, as if unsure of how to answer the question. “When I would walk closer to the waters to somewhat check on him, I’d hear what sounds like mumbles. His repeating of the words, ‘someone’s coming’ or ‘I have to go’. I thought it was fever talk, even though Harry never got fevers since his birth. He shouldn’t be anywhere else in his condition, especially at this time besides his water in
year old birthday and came and gone without him seeing his parents at all that day. He opened his eyes to the latest iPhone that came out just a few days ago, his already recently brought TV already replaced with a big, wider, and enhanced version, and his old-time favorite: blueberry pancakes. He did not once get an ‘happy birthday’ said to him by his parents that he didn’t see at all.
Draco crouched by a tree, wrapping his arms around himself. Despite being in the full heat of the sun, he felt so cold and lonely. The thought that someone had successfully kidnapped him, scared him. Now, he was stuck on some island, by himself and not knowing how he is gonna get home. He was alone. But he was used to being alone. All the time, ever since he was little.
in his right state of mind. He never calls her ‘mom’, it always ‘mother’ and he does not yell. “I have to go! I can’t waste anyone more time talking to people who doesn’t listen.” He began to move to exit the room, his back straight and strong. Lily knew she had to do something fast.
His arm broke through the water’s surface before he felt weight lift the rest of his body out the water. Closing his eyes, and curling his arms around his face, he screamed.
And with that, with his other large and warm hand, he gripped Draco’s chin and gently holding it while Draco was opening his mouth, brought his still wet lips to his dry ones.
Wincing, he got a shark tooth, and ran it down his ankle. In a panic, he blindly swept his hand down, and saw red. A section of the tongue was cut off; His leg was free.
With a grunt, he pushed up his upper part of his body up off whatever it was on. His hair was wet, and his clothing.
To his surprise the creature just shrunk his sized, lowering them to the surface level of the water, with Draco still on it is back. As his size got smaller, Draco now got a small guess as to what it was. Four long and strong legs with a body of muscles and a long neck, with wavy moving water down it's back as hair.
When he touched water, at his will, his body became the water in full sense. His mass could appear if he wanted it too, but at most times, he kept himself fluid.
be bothered by this mysterious being’s presence. His scent of something unknown arose from him with a hint of musk and body heat messed with his mind.
“What’s wrong?!” Lily and James both heard Anna shout and knew that both her and Alexander were coming their way fast. When they reached the room entry, James lifted his right hand, keeping his eyes on Harry and pausing them in their steps.
Both Draco and the dragon stilled, catching the tone of the strange shape of water. His anger and impatience quick to grow. Draco shrunk back.
He tried to sit up but found that he didn’t have any strength. He panted and slowly crept his other unoccupied hand to grip the man’s hair to try and pull him off. Thankfully hearing his plea, the man lifted his head, with glowing eyes and a wistful smile.
Draco didn’t care about his wet and soggy clothing as he walking to his bus stop that was a few blocks from his house. He didn’t care about the fact that if he kept walking this same speed, he could miss his bus, despite that today was essential to his future, and therefore his life. He just didn’t care, not like how he did a few minutes ago. He didn’t care about anything at that moment.
Despite being totally lost and confused, Draco can’t focus on nothing but the man in front of him with wide eyes. With his wet, but warm hands having a firm grasp on his chin, Draco’s unable to move his head away, much less talk.
Walking in the rain didn’t used to bother him. Besides his clothes and only his clothes and shoes getting wet thanks to his tough and smooth bookbag that was made for whatever material that had the rainwater run off the sides instead of
James tilted his head, “but the ‘pull’, do you think that...” he was unsure of how to continue. “he’s talking about
“Harry...,” Lily warned. He kept walking. James turned his head to the side and closed his eyes. He could hear Anna and Alexander start to make noises, fighting his magic.
He remembered waking up every morning, running down the long and dark hallways to his parents’ room, only to find it clean and empty. The bed was wrinkle free, a sign that it hasn’t been slept in at all. There were clothes in the closets, but they were the same clothing he saw every morning when he’d check. The tub and walk-in showers were still dry, not been used in however time. His heart faltered, before he roughly slammed the door and ran back to his room.
Waking up late, packing some of his toiletries and extra clothes, and reheating last night’s dinner had him stuffing his face as he raced for the door. While it really would not be a problem if he missed the school bus and didn’t go to school today, he had something important to do that is a little heavy on his chest.
Harry was a clam and obedient child. He never talked back to his parents, always helped his younger siblings, Anna, and Alexander with whatever they needed that wasn’t beyond reason, but he also liked to play around from time to time. He was a loving and caring son, and big brother, but the Maturing Stage is stressful for the young ones going through it, and the ones around them But it was never heard of to be this way.
The words slowly echoed throughout his mind. Draco jolted, startled. The words didn’t seem to be spoken to him. The things head turned to look at something in the distance. No other movement was made from it, besides the water below them moving in sharp and rough waves.
Draco made up his mind. There were already too many questions about what all happened today...but this weird water creature had recused him, and listened to him when it didn't need to. And it seems like he cares about his somewhat. (
With slow movements, he scooped up the teeth with some sand, and slowly put them in his shorts pocket. He then grabbed some more sand, so they wouldn’t be poking him when he moved and stood back up and motioned to the water.
Unable to center himself, or even control his body, Draco was left with the only option to force the man to stop. He bit down as hard as he could, with all his might, on the burning hot tongue that was still in his mouth. More blood spilled in his mouth, spit mixing in as it crawled down his neck and Draco shuttered in disgust. There was something else. He squirmed, there was something in the blood, and we wanted it out of his mouth. He expected the man to jump back in pain and confusion, but the man burrowed closer to Draco, trying to dig his tongue down his throat with a loud moan.
Man...Going from Dr. Phil to Catfish had me so lost with things. Sorry for the wait. Please comment and enjoy!!
James narrowed his hazel eyes. This isn’t normal Mature Stage behavior. Harry shouldn’t even be moving right now, much less talking so coherently.
