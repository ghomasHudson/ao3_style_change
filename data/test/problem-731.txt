"Tomorrow is the first Hogsmeade trip," Draco started, fidgeting with the hem of his shirt, "and I was wondering if you'd like to go with me."
"I'm alright," Harry said, reaching out and bruising his hand over Draco's where he'd placed it on the edge of his bed. Draco seemed to hyper-fixate on his hand then, allowing Pomfrey to finally be heard.
"There's hardly any drama around here these days! Everyone was confessing left and right after the war ended and now that everyone's in happy relationships, no one has any pain for me to enjoy anymore."
Draco turned then to stare over at Harry's side of the room and raked his eyes over the red Gryffindor banner and Quidditch posters. Draco never really had decorated his walls before, even at home. Staring at the posters made him want to now.
"No, singing in the shower is undignified," Draco said, sticking his nose up into the air as Harry laughed, the sound made him smile. "Are you still dating the weaslette?"
“You should set a different sound for that thing,” Draco groaned and Harry chuckled, snaking his arm around Draco’s stomach and pulling him towards himself.
"Oh that's right! How's the project been going then?" Hermione said and they began to talk about herbology, which got Ron and Harry completely lost.
"It's fine Malfoy," Harry said, the earlier humor from his voice was gone and it sounded hollow which immediately made Draco's stomach turn in a way that was not at all pleasant. What is happening to me? Draco thought, Just last year I'd be celebrating if I got that kind of reaction from Potter. Draco supposed that it was because he knew what it was like to go through a war and it wasn't all just petty digs anymore as they were when they were young. "Do you want to play the game or not?" Harry said, pulling Draco out of his thoughts as he sat up to look at him.
"For the hangover," Draco said, handing it gently to Harry. Harry sat up and gratefully took the vial and downed it in one gulp, the headache ended almost immediately. "Got Pansy to give me two."
Harry hurried to the window to call Draco's owl back to give the letter to him. He was watching it fly away just as the door burst open to admit Mrs. Weasley.
"That's not a bad idea, we could try catching her later at lunch or something," Ron said, excited to be of use when it seemed like Hermione and Harry were the only ones with any useful information on the subject.
Harry followed Draco as he made his way out of the common room and to the astronomy tower. Draco thought it was a bit of a miracle Filch didn't run into them, but they made it to the top of the tower safely.
"What?!" Draco shot up so fast blood rushed to his head and he had to steady himself against the wall.
"Just because I said I'd kiss him out of everyone in the circle, doesn't mean I like him. It only means he was the least repulsive out of the group."
"Was that a compliment?" Harry said, smirking as he dropped his arm. The smirk fell quickly as he was met with the sight of Draco leaning over his work with a concentrated look. The sight was breathtaking and Harry froze.
"Truth," Neville said and hoped it was the right decision. It evidently wasn't as her smirk spread wider if that was even possible.
"I was thinking we could have a study date today," Harry said as they got up to leave the table as well. "It's kind of late to go to Hogsmeade now and I have quite a bit of work this weekend."
"Oh stop being dramatic, none of us are dating anyone. I don't like Neville like that and Draco's too chicken to tell Potter he likes him."
"Well, I gotta say: I'm jealous, Weasley," Pansy said, shooting Ron a smirk as she went back to her seat. Ron was sputtering beside Hermione and was trying to wrap his head around the whole thing.
Harry turned back to the pitch where tryouts were happening, it seemed like the Slytherin captain was weeding out those who couldn't fly or didn't have very good broom handling. Harry liked watching Quidditch, even if it was just practice or just the Slytherins, but he was having trouble focusing with Draco next to him.
"How about we do it this coming Friday? Dean said, "We should be able to get everything ready by that time and it'll be nice to conclude the school week with."
"Well, we could sleep in for a bit and then eat lunch there at the three broomsticks, and after that we could go to honeydukes and wherever else looks interesting. We can leave at 11."
They ended up in The Three Broomsticks which was a great relief to Draco. They grabbed a booth in the back that was slightly hidden and a waitress showed up quickly after they sat down.
"Oh that's a brilliant idea!" Hermione practically shouted earning herself four bemused looks from the four other boys.
The second the seal broke the thing popped open and started spewing little fireworks and Harry could make out fancy cursive writing sprawled across the paper.
Draco had a feeling it was much worse than he was letting on, and he suddenly felt very angry, "Not that bad? That's child abuse!" Draco suddenly shouted and then caught himself when Harry seemed to startle at his sudden outburst. He knew Harry didn't need his rage right now, it wouldn't help him, so instead he took a breath and scooted a bit closer. "Sorry, but I mean, you shouldn't need to compare what your childhood was like to others'. Just because some people have gone through worse, doesn't make your pain any less valid."
"Go to sleep, you're going to need it after all the alcohol," Harry murmured, he then bent down and pressed a soft kiss onto Draco's temple.
Draco shuffled his feet under the table, staring hard down at his butterbeer that had been placed in front of him a minute ago. "I just wanted to apologize," Draco finally said, not looking up, "I shouldn't have just kissed you. If we can still be friends I'd like that." He felt his hands find the cup and his fingers wrap around it.
Harry immediately got lost in his eyes as he looked at him. They seemed to be glowing in the moonlight and Draco's hair was messily hanging in his face. Harry really was hopelessly in love with him.
The group seemed to be a mix of Ravenclaw and Gryffindor students and Harry couldn't help but be happy at how houses were mixing more.
"Oh, right. Sorry," Draco said, suddenly embarrassed. While he'd always had a lot expected of him as a kid, he still had had moments where he was allowed to act like a child when he was younger, Harry never even got that.
Draco laughed at this and then the server appeared with their drinks. She made a funny look at them and then swept off. Draco felt slightly uncomfortable by the look, but Harry didn't seem to notice it.
"Oh no, looks like tails," Seamus said in mock sadness when he noticed how eager Harry and Draco were to know what was said about them. Seamus passed the coin onto Dean who asked Neville next and then Neville asked Blaise.
"A good alcohol smuggler never shares his secrets," Seamus said with a laugh and Ginny thanked him again as she went to join Luna on her way out.
"I did this," Harry practically whispered, reaching out and trailing his fingertips over the scars lightly. Draco felt a shiver go down his spine.
Madam Pomfrey let out a long suffering sigh. There was no way to win with these two, ever since they'd become friends they were unable to be separated from each other. "Alright, if you stay out of my way you can stay," Pomfrey said, moving to grab a clipboard. "It seems like your potion exploded. Malfoy was lucky to have not been hit with it."
"Me neither," Hermione said, turning to look at the stairs where Harry had just disappeared up a moment ago.
"He-" Harry paused wondering if he should even tell them. The idea of telling them Draco kissed him embarrassed him enough and he didn't want to share that embarrassment with someone else. "He didn't do anything. I'm fine, just tired."
"I thought you said we couldn't talk about the questions outside of the game," Draco sighed, resigned. Pansy waved her hand dismissively at that.
I've spent most of my time doing my homework for the break and reading in the garden. My mother has been reading in the garden with me as of late as well, it's strange in all honesty. Sometimes I wonder if she's trying to make up for the last few years. I don't mind it, though.
“Any special reason you’ve picked out such a nice restaurant?” Draco smirked over his menu at Harry, he had a feeling he knew where this night was going. Harry’s face reddened and Draco knew he’d guessed right.
"I'll go," Draco offered a bit too quickly, but he knew what was about to come if he let Pansy ask him, he wanted to put it off as long as he could. He leaned over to Lavender to be able to whisper in her ear. "Who here would you want to snog?"
Draco moved out slightly before thrusting back in, causing Harry to cry out and Draco quickly stopped.
"You two could actually try and be civil," Hermione sighed. Even with everything that they had all been through, Hermione had realized that many that they hadn't gotten along with before the war had really just been a bunch of kids caught up in a war. After the war, and Draco's trials, Draco had mellowed out. Hermione saw this, the only person he still showed any of his old fire with was Harry.
Pansy swatted at his leg playfully, "I'm not a player. Just because girls actually like me doesn't make me a player."
When he came out he was dressed in what looked like pajama bottoms and a dark green muggle sweatshirt.
One thing that made dating Draco great was that he got to kiss him. Harry was quickly becoming addicted to Draco's lips.
Draco looked down at himself. The idea of substituting his daily shower for the scourgify charm was not appealing in the slightest, but he figured it'd have to do, "Alright."
"Apparently so, but I know she really does want to do something today. It really sucks that you're stuck with Malfoy."
Ron snickered, "Seems like she's getting told off." Pansy was putting down the bottle she had just picked up when the rest of eighth years started showing up.
Just as he was about to dive into his reading, though, the door slammed open and in came two shouting boys. Draco groaned as he turned around to see who had just busted through the door, finding Dean and Seamus loaded down with alcohol.
"Not really," Harry sighed, readjusting his book-bag on his shoulder. He would switch shoulders, but he didn't want to jam the bag between the two of them. "I've seen a couple more colors: pink and green. I think there are only four colors total, or I haven't seen any others at least. Everyone has a color too," Harry said, trailing off and looking out towards where they usually sat by the lake. There weren't many people out there as it was October and getting cold. "Oh, and sometimes people will glow brighter than usual."
"Okay, well I'm going to head to bed. It has got to have been an hour by now." Harry jumped to his feet, gathering his books and left a dumbfounded Draco sitting at the table.
The trek out to the edge of the forest by the lake was a bit long and Draco had to redo the heating charm on himself twice before they got to the far side of the forest.
"We're okay," Ginny looked down at the seat across from Ron. He was sitting in a booth in the back of the restaurant. "Can we sit for a moment?" Ginny gestured to the seat.
When Draco finally got in bed he found he couldn't sleep. He kept thinking back to the kiss he shared with Harry. Draco reached his hand up to his mouth and ran his fingers over his lips. He could still feel Harry's lips pressed against his and he couldn't get it out of his mind. Draco's eyes wandered over to where Harry was sleeping spread out on his back, his mouth open. Oh how soft Harry's lips were and the taste of alcohol on his breath, it was intoxicating and he had the urge to go over and wake him up if only to feel Harry's lips on his again.
Harry seemed like he was ready to blow up Draco suddenly noticed as he took in Harry's flushed face and tight grip on his book.
"I'm sure they won't care as long as you're happy," Hermione said with a comforting smile as she reached across to give Ginny's hands a small squeeze.
"The people my father worked for are dumb, but not that dumb," Draco murmured, he had turned back to his food and was staring absently down at his soup.
"Draco?" Hermione questioned, her eyebrow raised a bit at him. Harry blushed, it was the first time he'd called him Draco in front of anyone. They were on a first name basis now, sure, but Harry hadn't actually called him Draco when it wasn't just the two of them.
Draco removed his mouth from Harry's and brought his mouth down to his nipple. Harry's groan of protest was quickly replaced with another breathy moan that caught in his throat as Draco ran his tongue over Harry's sensitive nipple.
Draco leaned in before he could lose his nerve and their lips met with a spark that sent a shiver down his spine. The kiss quickly picked up as Harry brought his hands up to Draco's arms, but then as quickly as it started, it ended and Draco moved back to his side of the circle. Draco kept his eyes averted as he took his turn.
Blaise turned a bit pink from the admission and avoided eye contact with Neville as he resoutly stared at the ground in front of him.
Draco and Harry separated when they made it down the stairs, but Harry continued to wear the jumper the whole night. If anyone thought anything of it, they didn't say anything.
"Well you two obviously weren't going to say something and the tension was getting annoying!" Pansy replied crossing her arms and chuckling at Draco's flabbergasted look.
"Yes you did, non stop," Lucius said, "As soon as you met him and we've never gotten any ounce of peace since." Narcissa laughed lightly as Draco continued to try and save himself.
Ron seemed to find that completely irrelevant though and immediately went to asking the first thing that popped into his head, “Did you kiss him back?”
"Your decision? Or hers?" Draco noticed immediately that he hit another sore spot and inwardly cursed, "You don't have to answer."
"What can I get for you?" she asked with a bright smile that slightly wavered when her eyes landed on Draco.
Ginny let out a sigh, letting her head flop into her hands. "I sent a letter to my parents finally, telling them about Luna... about our relationship."
"Yeah, you guys kept it really well hidden. Though it does make more sense now, you guys make a cute couple," Ron said and smiled over at them.
He picked at his breakfast as he tried to list who had what colors in his head. Draco, Hermione, Ron, Seamus, and Dean were red. Ginny, Luna, Hannah Abbott, Pansy, and Neville were pink. Blaise, Susan Bones, and Madam Pomfrey were blue. And he could make out a couple greens in the sea of students, though he didn't know any by name. He briefly wondered what his color was.
3. Originally I wanted Ron to be completely oblivious to Draco and Harry, but I ended up thinking it’d be funnier if Ron kept ending up seeing things he didn’t mean to and then not saying anything about it, and of course Harry wouldn’t say anything either because he thought Ron was oblivious.
"Did you enjoy the kiss?" Pansy cut in before Harry could answer. It was against the rules, but Draco could feel the tug of an answer at the back of his throat as whatever magic that bound players to tell the truth while playing games counted that as a question.
“Well, if he’s ignoring you, you could write him a letter asking to meet up and saying you’re sorry. I don’t suggest asking him to the Yule Ball through a letter, though, so make sure to just ask him to meet up,” Hermione suggested.
"Death Eater," Draco heard someone mutter as he walked past Draco's table. He didn't recognize the kid, but his tie told him that the kid was from Gryffindor. Draco guessed the kid was probably a sixth year.
"No, you're fine. Just keep going," Harry said, letting out a shaky breath. Harry could feel himself stretching around Draco's fingers and the thought alone would make him shiver with need if he wasn't so focused on the burning sensation below. Draco moved his fingers a bit and then grazed a hard bundle of nerves.
"I think the two hours are over," Draco suddenly announced, standing up and quickly putting his books away before rushing off, leaving Harry feeling quite empty.
"You can't just nominate yourself, that's an abuse of power," Hermione said, rolling her eyes at Ron.
"Huh? Oh- yeah I'm good, I'm happy for you two," Harry gave them a smile and Hermione looked at him funny when everyone returned to eating.
The colors were pretty, Harry couldn't help but think as he stumbled around the room a little light headed. Someone had done some spell to make colored lights flash around the room and music was playing out of a gramophone in the corner. People were glowing all over the room though, adding to the haze of color that filled the room.
Harry was getting frustrated and angry, "Is that what you think this is? That I'm just fooling around with you?"
"Only partially. We haven't had a ball for a while, you can imagine why. I can't say I miss them though."
Draco glowed brighter than usual, but squeezed Harry's hand back. "I'm okay, don't worry. Though, the colors are a bit crazy," Harry chucked a bit, not letting Draco's hand go. Draco didn't make any move to drop his either.
“If you were worried about coming in on us naked then you’d give us a heads up before you show,” Draco grumbled as Pansy walked into the kitchen.
Hermione watched Pansy and Blaise out of the corner of her eye as she responded, "Looks like we're all going home then. I haven't heard of any eighth year who's staying here."
"Alright, everyone ready?" George said, finishing setting up the last of the fireworks, "fifteen seconds till midnight!"
"Here, this door leads outside to the greenhouse," Draco said, pushing open a door that looked exactly the same as every other door if Harry was being honest.
Harry managed to make eye contact with Draco and his eyes widened slightly. Harry watched as he said some kind of excuse to leave. Pansy smirked at him and Draco turned red and then he hurried out into the hall.
"Chocolate Frogs and Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans." Harry reached out to a shelf and grabbed a package of Fizzing Wizzbees for Ron.
Harry suddenly woke with a gasp and sat up very quickly, causing Draco to jump back. He was drenched in sweat. Harry stared around, wide eyed until his eyes landed on Draco and he let out a sigh of relief.
"Uh- yeah, yeah. 'Course, sorry," Harry shook his head and followed Ron to the Gryffindor table, mentally scolding himself for thinking like that, about Malfoy of all people.
"Just give it to me," Draco said, rolling his eyes and pulling it off Harry's shoulder and putting it on his own. Next he grabbed his jumper up from the bench and tossed it over Harry's shoulders. "Put it on, I don't want you catching a cold."
"What? It's not like this is the first time you've seen me shirtless," Hermione laughed as Ron's neck went red. "For goodness sake, take the shirt!" Hermione said when Ron continued to stare, and chucked it at his head.
Ron seemed equally confused by the turn in attitude but never-the-less made the best of it and kept up a lively conversation with both Harry and Hermione. By the time they got to the Great Hall both Ron and Hermione had shot glances at each other about 100 times.
Pansy rolled her eyes. "I'm not going to ruin your hair." Pansy stuck her fingers in the potion and rubbed it on her hands, bringing them up to his hair and messing it up.
"Why not? There must be someone you're interested in," Ron said, deciding to try and change tactics and use gender-neutral terms instead.
"There you are!" Hermione said aghast when Harry plopped down across the table from Ron and Hermione. "You were gone all day!"
"Well I doubt anyone would actually turn you down," Ron laughed. "I've heard a lot of girls whispering about you recently," he continued before Hermione smacked him in the head.
"They've been hanging out around each other so much lately, and they obviously like each other. The better question is how didn't you know," Hermione laughed a bit.
"What are the odds of you dying Gregory's hair orange right now, while he's sleeping," Draco announced and when Seamus and him both said ten, Seamus gathered up his wand and the group followed him silently up the stairs to Gregory's and Neville's dorm.
"You can say that again," Harry said, letting out a sigh. He looked back up and met Draco's eyes after a moment and then they both burst into a fit of giggles.
Harry groaned, "I'm not stalking him, I just happen to be looking at him... whenever you look at me."
Pansy watched the fire as it's light danced upon the walls and across Blaise's face. A long moment passed as she watched it, oddly calmed by it. It had been a while since she had been able to just relax in front of the fire and not be worried about something bigger than school work. The war had taken its toll on everyone and had taken so much from them that they'd never get back: family, friends, normalcy.
"Yeah," Harry responded feeling slightly awkward. It had been months since the war and he still hadn't asked her out again, it just hadn't felt right. Harry had thought about it, and in all honesty, he felt as though he didn't really ever like her. Sure, he cared about her, loved her even, but just not like that; which then got him thinking about other girls he liked and realized the only other one had been Cho, which had been a whole mess on it's own, and he felt as though he might have never liked her either. That had him thinking again and he wondered why he ever felt like he liked her and ended up with a whole other conclusion that he might have wanted to be with her simply because Cedric Diggory had dated her, which brought up a whole other existential crisis that he decided he didn't want to think about while sleeping on the floor of Ron's bedroom.
Harry and Draco had made a decision at the beginning of the year to set aside their differences and try a shot at being friends. This novel idea shocked Ron and pleased Hermione, but eventually Ron and Draco settled on a grudging friendship and they bonded over teasing Harry. Of course, both Ron and Hermione have been ignorant that there had been feelings other than friendship blooming, and Harry and Draco liked it that way. They both could hang out whenever, Hermione and Ron never questioning it. In fact, Hermione constantly praised Harry on putting their tiffs in the past and creating inter-house friendships; never once did she ever assume he might be getting something more than a quidditch buddy out of it.
"Nope, you said you wanted to prank Filch, no going back now," Draco said, laughing when Harry let out a put-out groan and fell back dramatically.
"You're so beautiful," Harry whispered. Draco moaned as his hands brushed lower, and Draco reached out, grabbing Harry's wrists.
Draco just decided to hope that Potter didn't hear anything as he hadn't mentioned it. "I'll see you later, Pansy, don't think this is over," Draco said as he turned to leave with Potter leaving Pansy smirking after them.
"I was a Death Eater, and will be one as long as this mark remains on my skin." Draco yanked his sleeve up, showing the dark ink that painted his skin. It was slightly faded now, but it was still there and Draco hated to look at it. He yanked his sleeve back down. "And my father too, he wouldn't be okay with me dating a guy, let alone you. He'd kill me."
"What are you talking about, just watching is boring," Draco complained, falling into easy conversation with the Gryffindors.
Ron noticed the new hair color first and tugged on Harry's sleeve to get him to look, "Trying something new are we Malfoy?" Ron laughed.
"It's not alright, I did that to you," Harry was pulling away now and Draco reached out to grab onto Harry's arms.
Draco made a noncommittal noise and closed his eyes. The sun streaming in the window was brighter than he ever remembered and everything seemed just a bit louder than usual.
"It's been alright I guess. I mean, it could be worse, we haven't gotten in any major fights yet so I suppose that's good."
"Thanks a lot, Draco," Harry said with a smile, "I'll see you later back at the castle!" With that Harry rushed across the street to meet up with Ron and Hermione.
"No, not at all. Those two at that table over there are glowing a pretty bright red though," Harry said, pointing to what seemed to be a young couple. From the looks of it they seemed to be Hogwarts students.
Draco groaned as Harry pushed against him slightly, the kiss was heating up fast and Draco found himself not minding at all.
The day had finally come for the party and almost all the eighth-years were gathered in front of the fireplace.
Rumors were flying by lunch about why Harry and Draco had been late. The most popular one was that Draco had tried to attack Harry and this rumor was backed up by their frazzled appearances. Draco and Harry hurried through lunch to go to the library and escape the rumors.
Draco chuckled, sitting down next to Harry close enough so their shoulders and knees brushed together.
Both Dean and Ron remembered last Friday's party though, and Harry and Draco hadn't kissed. Harry didn't seem to remember that though and Dean looked at Ron with a smirk.
"Well they've been dating for about six or so months now, and then the other day you said they both were red now, which kind of tipped me off."
"Yeah, you're probably right." Ginny got up to give the letter to Pigwidgeon and watched as he flew out the window with the letter to her parents.
Draco looked at her like she’d grown a second head, “What on earth would make you think that? He very clearly turned me down.”
Draco decided to copy Harry, pressing his finger into him slowly. Harry let out a small groan at the odd sensation and Draco pressed in further, still unsure what he was doing. He moved about for a minute before pressing a second one in as well, Harry sucked in a breath.
“And then he asked me if I was going with anyone!” Draco complained to Pansy back in her room after the Quidditch match, “He asked me that while literally holding my hand!”
“How was your date?” Ron said loudly as they arrived at the table and sat across from him and hermione. This earned them quite a few looks from those sitting at the table around them and some from the Hufflepuff table next to them.
"Who knows, I was reading on room expansion spells over the summer though and to expand all the house's dormitories like that would be pretty difficult," Hermione said.
"I just know how to think on my feet, unlike you," Draco said, walking over and placing his hands on Harry's hips, pulling him further into the room.
"Well I was thinking about the potions that were mixed together: Amortentia and Veritaserum. On its own, amortentia is a love potion and veritaserum is a truth serum, so what if the colors have to do with love?"
"Fair-" Blaise started but was interrupted by the door slamming open, displaying Pansy in the doorway, dressed in a solid black dress that bunched around her knees.
"He didn't seem to be actually interested in playing for the team," Harry laughed a bit, "Plus, you have much better broom handling skills and are more experienced."
"Why not? There's nothing that says we can't use it for parties," Ron said, "It's the room of requirement Hermione, we can use it for anything we require."
"Yeah, it seemed the whole room was glowing while we were in the common room, I think the flashing lights added to the effect."
Seeing as Pansy was too drunk and currently complaining on the floor, Dean took up the bottle and gave it a spin. The bottle rolled to a stop in front of Harry and Dean walked over to Harry.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all crowded around a table in the common room studying after dinner. Well, Hermione was studying. Harry and Ron had worked for about 45 minutes and then gave up in favor of playing wizards chess and complaining to Hermione about how boring studying was even though - as Hermione pointed out - they weren’t even doing so. After losing the game for the fifth time in a row, though, they had stopped again. Finals were in three weeks though and that was about the only reason Harry and Ron even agreed to stay with her and “study” at all.
Harry felt like an idiot as he made his was back to the castle carrying Draco's soaked robes. Why did I have to kiss him? he asked himself.
The game was decided to be Never have I ever and pansy had brought along a little bag full of never have I ever questions that she placed in the middle.
"Two butterbeers please," Harry quickly said, noticing the look and the waitress hurried off without a second glance at Draco.
"Wow I bet it's late," Draco suddenly interrupted and jumped off the bed. Harry watched him with a small disappointed frown as Draco walked over to his bed. "We should probably head to bed, we have early classes tomorrow." With that, Draco quickly got under the covers and Harry stared after him awkwardly.
"You fell asleep and my mother saw you," Draco said, his panic rising as he talked and he could feel his throat starting to close.
His brain was spinning a mile a minute but he was able to pull two coherent thoughts together long enough to push Draco off himself.
"I don't know," Harry said, turning away to stare out the window. He was surprised to say the least, he'd never have thought it was possible for it to be considered normal growing up. It really went against everything Uncle Vernon said. Though, that wasn't very surprising, he was ignorant about a lot.
"Yeah, it never works," Harry's eyes watched as Draco's hands ran over the sheets mindlessly. Draco had moved his eyes back to Harry and set to watching Harry's eyes as they stared down at Draco's hands. They sat like that for a moment in a peaceful silence.
Nothing could compare to the person beside him though. Harry looked to the right, where Draco had been next to him for the last hour. After he'd made sure Pansy was going to pace herself, he'd glued himself to Harry's side as Ron and Hermione had gone off to dance.
"In my opinion you should have started last month. Now, you're welcome to join us if you'd like. We're meeting at three, Draco can come too if he'd like," Hermione nodded at Draco and he gave a slight smile back. "On a whole other note, I found Ron with that," Hermione pointed to the marauder's map that was folded neatly on top of the notebook, "You really should have gotten rid of it. It could seriously be a liability if someone finds it."
"She said not to pour the water directly onto the plant, not to just not water it," Neville said, finally glancing over at Blaise only to laugh at the annoyed face Blaise was making. "I think I'm starting to notice a trend here," Neville smirked at Blaise who was continuously looking more annoyed with each word, "you just don't listen."
"Oh, no, I haven't yet," Harry said leaning over to rummage through his bag that was sitting on the floor at his feet. It was instant relief as he downed half of it like he'd been told.
"It's okay, I get it," Harry said, shaking his hands in front of his face, realizing why Ron was reusing to look at him.
Harry didn't seem to be planning on saying anymore and Draco let himself relax, leaning into Harry and resting his head on his shoulder.
"You're the one who wanted me to go faster," Draco sniggered, watching Harry try and walk, but when he tried to get up himself he couldn't help but notice just how sore he felt all over. "Oh no, this isn't gonna be very good for the quidditch match."
"Oh good, that was fast," Madam Pomfrey said when Harry entered the hospital wing. "I have some more information on the potion that you'll probably be happy to hear. Snape has been trying to figure out when it'll wear off, and it seems like it will only take three moon cycles. Meaning, the effects will wear off on New Years day at precisely 7:51pm."
The day got wilder as it went on. It seemed like the more colors he saw the more it didn't seem real. Everyone seemed to be surrounded by a color and he had yet to see anyone without a color. He supposed everyone had a color.
Draco shook his head, trying to clear the thoughts from his head and turned over, facing his back to Harry.
"No problem," Harry said, feeling his heart speed up stupidly. "What were they doing today?" Harry asked, trying to joke a bit, and Draco colored rapidly.
Harry looked over to where Ginny was nervously shifting in her seat and immediately felt like it wasn't going to be good news. Hermione looked happy though, so he figured it probably wasn't too bad, she was usually good at telling how people were feeling.
"She apparently can, and now both of us are stuck playing 'friends' until the end of the school year," Harry sighed. Ron's muttering of how unfair the situation was faded into the background as Harry opened the door to the Great Hall and found himself automatically searching for blond hair. Harry almost immediately found Malfoy sitting at the Slytherin table, sat facing the Gryffindor table as he had for the last seven years.
Harry let his hand find it's way between Draco's legs and rub circles against his entrance, slowly pressing against him when Draco suddenly stopped him.
"Yeah... but never one that was glowing like this..." Harry trailed off as he continued to stare at the letter, it felt like it might blow up in his face, he could practically feel the magic radiating off it. He slowly picked it up and opened it as everyone watched with fascination.
"What's the matter?! Harry, it's two in the afternoon! One would think you died, you missed breakfast and then also lunch," Hermione berated Harry. "Do you plan on getting up any time today?"
"No, don't stop, please," Harry practically begged, leaning his head back to look up at Draco, gasping slightly. Draco started to continue slowly at first but then began to pick up the pace, thrusting into Harry as he leaned forward to capture Harry's lips in a kiss. Soon Harry's moans turned from slight pain to pleasure as he started to relax and grind back on Draco - rolling his hips in small circles that slowly got faster until their movements were erratic. Draco grabbed his hands and pushed them above his head on the wall.
"It's alright," Harry said, stepping over the pile and making his way over to Draco, "I'm glad I get to make my first with you."
"Of course I have, everyone has," Draco gave Harry an are you stupid look and held the door open for him.
Harry could hear the worry in his voice and he couldn't help but think about how a year ago he would've been shocked to see Draco worried about him. "I'm not sure exactly, all I did was stir the potion," Harry said, "well, I suppose I didn't even get to do that. It exploded before I even managed to bring the stirring stick the whole way around. It was a murky color though, and last week it looked fine."
"So are you going to get in this time by yourself or will I have to shove you in again?" Harry asked when he had toed off his shoes and looked back to see Draco hadn't moved.
Harry smiled at the use of his name. They'd been doing more and more things other than homework during their punishments lately, and as a result, Draco had been calling him Harry more. He loved the sound of his name on his tongue.
"One," Both Pansy and Blaise said at once and Blaise turned to look at Neville again as he leaned in.
Harry then realized it was Monday, which meant they had potions first thing. He cast a quick tempus and freaked out when it showed class had started ten minutes ago.
"Are you going to ever get out of bed today?" Draco groaned, flopping dramatically backwards onto his bed. Harry would have made fun of how dramatic he was being if he wasn't so annoyed.
"Great! Now go to your room, I bet Potter is waiting for you!" Pansy smirked as she dodged a stinging hex.
"Yeah, you promised to tell me what happened while you were at Draco's as well," Ginny said, flopping down on Ron's bed.
Harry cleared his throat and Draco looked up at him. He was about to say something when a waitress arrived at their table.
“I may have asked him if he was going with anyone, and when he said he wasn’t even planning on going I said he should. Then, when he asked why I said he should go because it’s our last year.”
"No way, I've been looking forward to it for a while now, I haven't even been able to get my hands on it yet."
He felt more comfortable with Draco than he did anyone else, and he felt himself sigh in contentment, leaning his head down on top of Draco's. He could hear the wind whistling through the trees of the forbidden forest and felt the cool breeze on his face. It was the most relaxed Harry had been in a while. He was almost asleep when Draco moved off of where he was leaning against Harry to sit up.
When he took his chances of turning back, Draco seemed to be glowing brighter, if that was even possible and it honestly hurt his eyes a bit. He decided he should probably try and focus back on his school work for the sake of both his grades and sanity.
"Professor Snape just finished analyzing the potion and it seems it wasn't just an accident," Pomfrey said in that matter-of-fact way nurses seemed to be able to do, even when giving bad news.
"I can't believe you got us into this," Draco said, continuing his earlier rant by finally directly speaking to Harry. For the past ten minutes Draco had been making snarky comments and complaints about the situation, as they walked to where McGonagall said their dormitories were. Harry had to say, he preferred when Malfoy was just ranting and he could just stay there silently.
Neville was walking back to the castle when he heard his name being called. He turned around and was shocked to see none other than Blaise Zabini jogging after him.
"Good, then get out of bed so we can do something today," Hermione said, swiftly turning around and walking out the door.
I've made it to Hogwarts alright and the feast was fine. The eighth years have our own dormitories this year but I'm stuck with Potter of all people. We were supposed to be able to choose our rooms but instead stupid Potter slammed into me in the hall. As I'm sure you're already aware, the new headmaster is McGonagall and she stopped us in the hall and not only made us late to pick our roommate but also has required us to spend at least an hour a day together. She won't let us refuse either and now I'm stuck hanging out with him until the end of the school year! It's preposterous, what are we even supposed to do?!
They sat hours later next to a small fire Harry had made, leaning against the cave wall and each other.
"So, are we not gonna address the elephant in the room?" Blaise finally chimed in, "How on earth did you score a date with Potter?"
The lights turned off then and the room was plunged into darkness a moment later. Draco opened one eye then and peeked over at Harry, his back was to Draco though.
"Uh- I've never kissed anyone before," Neville muttered, looking very shy as Blaise looked at him. Blaise was well known as being a bit of a player around school. He'd come out as gay in his third year and from then on had rarely not been in a relationship. Knowing this, Neville really didn't want to screw up and completely embarrass himself.
When Filch finally passed and they couldn't hear his footsteps anymore, Harry turned towards Draco with that lop-sided grin that he loved so much and he couldn't help himself. Draco pressed Harry into the wall and captured his lips. Harry sighed into the kiss, his hands coming up to tangle in Draco's hair. Draco kissed Harry with a fervor that rivaled their kiss in the woods.
"Draco," Pansy said without hesitation and when the coin landed on tails, Pansy turned to Draco and he suddenly felt more nervous than ever because he knew he wouldn't be able to lie.
Blaise gazed lazily over at the work he was holding up and then it hit him: he had herbology today, which meant an entire hour working next to Neville. A smile spread across his face.
"I don't think we'll have enough time to get them back before the match though," Draco murmured, already trying to come up with ideas on how to get the fireworks back and prank Filch in the process.
"Pretty much," Harry rounded his stuff up on the bench and then turned to the rest of the team, "Great job today, guys. We won't have practice next Tuesday as we normally would as a bit of a break, but I expect to see you all on Thursday. Have fun with the rest of your day and make sure to get sleep."
"No way. Just use a cleaning charm; I'm starving and want to finish setting this up," Draco said, suddenly sitting up to get back to the fort, "we can shower later."
"Come this way," Harry said and led him to the edge of the water, so Draco could get a view of the whole lake and the moon in the sky above the castle.
Both boys stopped yelling and trying to untangle themselves from each other when they heard laughing. Turning to stare at Hermione who had dissolved in a fit of laughter by the door, they suddenly realized just how close they were to each other and quickly disentangled themselves and rushed to get as far away from each other as possible as their faces rapidly colored.
When the final class ended, Harry, Ron, and Hermione headed down to the pitch for practice. Hermione broke off from them when they reached the stands though and left with a quick good luck to sit and do homework.
"How would you know I carried back bags every time? Were you spying on me? I think that says more about you than me," Draco said back, trying to act nonchalant, but inside he was freaking out a bit. He didn't know why, but the idea that Harry had been paying so close attention to him all those years filled him with a feeling of unexplainable giddiness.
"Ugh, this is the worst," Ron groaned as they entered his room, but his opinion quickly changed as Hermione pulled her shirt off and handed it over to him. Ron stared for a moment sputtering.
"Bye," Harry said. He waited until everyone had gone except Draco before grabbing his bag and tossing it over his shoulder.
"Two butterbeers," Harry said and the witch hurried off. "Did you really think I would take you to Madam Puddifoots?"
"You'll just have to take my word for it," Harry said as they stepped out into the cold outside air. "Do you have any shops you wanted to go to?"
Draco didn't say anything, instead turning his attention to the issue at hand: what the hell was he supposed to do?
They entered the store and the door chimed signaling their entrance. The store was swarming with Hogwarts students and they had to squeeze by a group of fourth years to reach the chocolate section.
Harry reached up a hand to run his fingers through Draco's hair, he let out a contented sigh, leaning into the touch. It was nice to relax like this.
Draco's ears burned, he had no idea what any of the glowing meant, but the fact that he was glowing the most was embarrassing enough. "Do you have any idea what's causing it yet?"
Harry blushed at that as Hermione shot a glare at Ron. "It's not like that, Ron. I already told you. I dated Ginny, remember?"
It had gotten better as some time passed, of course, and now it was only slightly awkward at times when they were all together.
“Don’t give him any ideas,” Draco said, eyeing the chocolate, “The junk food from there is already bad enough. I can only imagine if they filled chocolate with the earwax flavoring from bertie botts every flavor beans or something.” His nose wrinkled in disgust.
Draco unbuttoned Harry's pants and pulled them down, revealing his erection straining against his boxers. Draco felt and saw him shudder as Draco pulled his underwear down as well, causing him some much needed friction. Draco leaned forward as he brought his hand to Harry's erection. Draco stroked him a few times as he kissed along his collar bone. At this point Harry was a moaning and panting mess, arching into Draco's hand. Standing up a bit, Draco leaned up to sink his teeth into Harry's skin right above his collarbone as he rubbed his thumb over the tip of Harry's erection.
Draco just stared at him waiting for him to continue, letter still clutched in his hands, and lips pressed in a thin line.
Hey all, I'm back with the next chapter now that finals are finally over! Also, today is my birthday so here's an early update.
Harry and Draco were running for the office doors as soon as Filch left the room. Harry rushed to the desk, hurrying through the drawers to find where he kept the confiscated items.
"This time, but you both have had countless other pointless fights that have started with you too." Harry realized arguing with Hermione was futile and decided to give up, sighing.
Harry and Draco had decided to go to Hogsmeade again on Saturday and were now bundled up in warm clothes as they made their way to Hogsmeade. Harry had plans to stay with Draco for the two hours of their punishment and then he was going to meet Ron and Hermione.
They were both drunk, doing this would practically be taking advantage of Draco, Harry suddenly thought and grabbed Draco's hands as they were about to go under his shirt.
They walked up to the counter to pay and Blaise took the chocolate frogs out of Neville's hands, "I'll pay."
Relief flooded Harry, if she was saying that they were probably right, they most likely were. It felt like a load of stress taken off his shoulders. If they knew what the colors meant, there was less chance of anything going wrong with the potion that they didn't foresee.
"So, are you going to take any girls to Hogsmeade this weekend?" Ron tried to ask casually. Hermione shot him a glare over the top of her book that he tried to ignore. He didn't want to straight-up ask Harry if he liked Draco, he didn't want to make him feel uncomfortable, but he also wanted to help him if he could. "You've had a lot of girls ask you out lately."
"Exactly. Let's say only one of the potions took effect, what would either of those do for their cause? You don't know any information that they'd be willing to be caught for and logically what would putting you under a love potion do?
"Stop making people kiss people they don't want to!" Ron shouted and glared over at Pansy and Blaise.
“HE WHAT?!” both Ron and Hermione shouted, quickly turning back to him, shock and surprise written all over their faces. Harry winced.
"Never have I ever gone skinny dipping," Draco had said, his words slightly slurred from the alcohol and he then tipped his glass back, shameless.
"Here," Draco said, offering his scarf to Harry with a light blush. "I'm not very cold. Use a heating charm too, it'll help."
Harry rolled his eyes, pushing Draco off him, who fell backwards still laughing. "You're too tired, you're getting loopy," he paused, letting Draco catch his breath, "just do it."
"Oh come on 'Mione, it's fine, trust me," Ron said, squinting up at her, "Though we should stock up on hangover potion before the next one."
“Yeah, good thing too or I would’ve had to come get you. Now, come on,” Draco said, lacing their fingers together and dragging him out the doors and out into the winter air.
Ron, on the other hand, stripped down to his pajamas and only managed a "good night" before he was out. Harry waited a few more minutes to make sure he was out before sneaking out of bed and making his way down stairs. He could only hope no one would wake as he was on his way down.
They seemed to notice Draco then, too, calling over to him, "Hey, glad you're here, mind helping out. We got a bit much."
"The food can wait," Draco said, fingers undoing the buttons of Harry's pants and hands making their way past his waistband. Harry was immediately grateful Draco was the one he'd fallen in love with.
“Now I’m just a bit nervous about who did it. You know? It stresses me out that they still haven’t figured that out,” Harry said, not noticing the way Draco fidgeted with his hands and kept his eyes on his drink.
"I guess we can't put off the inevitable huh...." Harry said trailing off and looking down at his plate again as if it held the answers. When it seemed like he wasn't going to be continuing that sentence, Pansy let out another scoff and rolled her eyes turning to Ron and Hermione.
"Yeah, you're probably right," Hermione sighed, plopping down onto their usual spot on the couch in front of the fire.
"You can't force me to too!" Draco looked over to Harry, his eyes silently pleading for him to take a drink instead, but Harry didn't seem to be about to give a complaint. Harry hadn't drunk anything to skip out a dare or truth the whole game and instead had just started drinking anyway. Draco cursed his gryffindorness.
"There's a lot of suits of armor around his office right?" Draco asked, an idea slowly forming in his head after a long moment of silence.
"I mean he's friends with more than- wait what?! You did this?!" Draco practically shouted, getting a very stern look from Madam Pince but he didn't much care. "I can't believe you did that!"
"So is yours you know," Harry laughed when Draco's light expression turned to one of horror as he tried to fix it.
"Uh, it's about something you said earlier..." Harry said, trailing off. Ginny stayed silent though, waiting for him to continue and he eventually did. "You said you were bi, and I was wondering what that meant?"
"It's not," Harry said, flopping back down next to Draco, "Hermione just overreacts a bit. It'd really only be dangerous if we had someone like Voldemort trying to get into the castle again, but anyone who'd try that are pretty much all in Azkaban and don't have enough power to try anyway."
“I bet the grounds of Hogwarts will be covered in snow by tomorrow,” Harry said, glancing over at Draco.
"Dare," she said with a look on her face that said she was ready for any kind of dare he threw her way.
Harry pressed light kisses down the back side of Draco’s neck and Draco let out a content sigh scooting further back into Harry’s embrace, “You don’t have plans tonight right?” Harry asked between kisses.
"You and Ron both, well at least he thought so after he started feeling better," Hermione sighed and rolled her eyes fondly, "What am I going to do with him."
"Alright, my turn!" Blaise said as he reached for the little bag, "Never have I ever kissed more than ten people." Blaise, Pansy, and Lavender all took a shot shamelessly, and looked rather proud of the fact.
Her suspicions were confirmed anyway when Draco came into the dining hall twenty minutes later, meeting eyes with Harry and then dropping them to hurry over to the Slytherin table.
Harry's hands go back to Draco's shirt as he tried, again, to take it off; Draco leaned back and pulled it off for him. Harry reached forward to run his hands across Draco's abdomen and chest, his touches feeling like fire on Draco's skin.
"I didn't make any face," Draco suddenly tried to pull his hand back but Harry held fast and laced their fingers together.
Everyone looked at each other as no one gave any suggestions. "Fine, looks like I have to do everything," Pansy sighed dramatically, "How about that muggle game: Truth or Dare or Drink?" Most everyone just stared at her again: almost no one had heard of the game before except those with muggle parents.
Normal friends don't sleep in the same bed together after a bad dream though, Ron would never sleep with me.
Even though Ginny never said anything and went on like everything was normal, he still felt awkward and felt as though he should really talk to her and give an explanation. But then again, what would he even say? "Hey, sorry I haven't asked you out again, but I don't think we should get back together because I think I might be gay"? Like hell if he was going to say that! Hell, he didn't even know what he was feeling! Sure, he never really liked any girls before, but he also never had any crushes on guys either... at least he thought not.
"I think it might be time to get some fresh air," Draco said, taking the drink from Harry's hands and replacing it with water, "Come on, follow me."
Neville's smile made Blaise's stomach flip, he really liked it when Neville smiled. During their eighth year, he hardly ever saw Neville smile.
Harry let out a sigh, grabbing his book bag and heading after him. When he made it down the stairs and set his stuff down at the table, taking the seat across from Draco, Draco didn't even look at him and Harry felt a twinge of sadness.
"The only thing I'm angry about is that you're never going to stop talking about him now," Lucius sighed and rubbed his hands over his eyes tiredly.
"Nah, I don't think so," Blaise said, "In my opinion it was perfectly justified. You two are practically hanging off each other, you might as well have already been dating."
"I'm going home to see my parents as they're both under probation and restricted to the house. Which doesn't really seem like much of a punishment to me as the manor is pretty big, but whatever. Blaise is going home too," Draco said over the racket Blaise and Pansy were making, gently scooting his plate away from them.
Harry looked up and saw the waitress had come back with their drinks and she looked utterly shocked. Harry and Draco both coughed awkwardly and pulled their hands away from each other as the waitress put the drinks down and hurried off, shooting them glances the whole way across the room.
Harry surveyed him for a moment before stopping, Draco turned back to him about to question him. Harry pulled his scarf off before he could say anything though and wrapped it around his neck, pulling him closer by it. “I bet you were one of the students who stayed inside on snow days when everyone was having snowball fights, huh?”
"Wait, I wanted to apologize," Draco said and Hermione looked at him like he had a third eye. "For everything that is."
That finally got a reaction out of him though and he let go of the letter with one hand to reach out for Harry’s, “Really? Like for real?” he asked, trying to get Harry to meet his eyes.
“Maybe only because he hasn’t been around us a whole lot,” Hermione said slowly, “but I assume you’re saying that because none of us exactly got along in years past. Though, if that’s the reason, you forgot Harry in your listing there.”
"Where were you?" Ron whispered and Hermione was leaning in to listen too, "You weren't in your room when I went to find you," Ron's eyes traveled over to where Draco was trying to ignore Pansy who was trying to get his attention, "Either of you."
"Oh no, absolutely not, no way in hell," Draco said, breaking the silence and plastering a look on his face somewhere between distraught and disgusted, because while he didn't really find the thought of him rooming with Harry all that horrible, he knew that Pansy would never let it go.
"Shit," Harry said when he woke up the next day, Draco curled up against his chest, on the floor of the astronomy tower. They were definitely late for class if the sun shining brightly against his eyes was anything to go by.
"I was thinking, instead of going back to our dorms we stay in the Room of Requirement tonight. What do you say? We haven't had much time to hang out since school started again."
"Well I have homework that I have to finish so we'll do that." Harry didn't seem very pleased to find out that he was going to be spending an hour doing homework with Malfoy, but agreed anyway, resigned to his fate.
Harry let out a soft laugh. He'd never thought there'd be a day when Draco would suggest a cleaning charm over taking a shower when he didn't have to.
"Oh that?" Ginny laughed, "It means I like both guys and girls. You had me worried you were pulling me aside for something bad."
"Alright, I'm okay now," Draco said, leaning back and wiping his eyes, "I want to get it over with."
Now, I’d like to thank you all for sticking with this story until the end and for all the kudos, comments, and bookmarks. They’re what kept me going! I’ve never finished a story that was more than one chapter before in my life, so I’d proud to say I’ve finally finished one.
Harry stared at her a moment, still trying to get over the fact that you could like both, and that's normal. He finally found his voice after a moment of stunned silence though, "I think I am too."
"It was good. My parents are still working on unpacking their things here, so I helped a lot with that. All our decorations were in boxes still," Hermione said with a laugh.
"How would a stupid dare change how the punishment went," Pansy mocked, "It could change everything! You should be thanking me for the chance to kiss him!"
"I agree with Dean and Smith, but I'm pretty sure Seamus just came to have something to do. I mean, pretty much every eighth year was out there," Harry said, leaning forward to circle Dean and Zacharias' names.
Hermione had always thought girls were pretty since she was young, but she'd never really had a chance to kiss one before. She knew she was bi, had known for a while, but she'd never really talked to anyone about it before. She had liked Ron too much to try to date a girl and when she by now it had just seemed pointless to tell anyone as she was planning to be with Ron for the rest of her life. She wasn't exactly sure how he'd react too and didn't really want to deal with it.
Harry looked over when he felt something hit his shoulder and saw Draco asleep, leaning against him, his book held in loose fingers resting on his lap. Harry smiled at the sight.
Harry took the scarf cautiously, remembering when he had wrapped it around Draco's neck just two weeks ago. "Thanks."
"What! What do you need Pansy?" Draco said, finally paying attention to the girl who was laying next to him on the grass and had been calling his name for the last few minutes.
As much as Harry tried not to show it, he was worried about what the potion meant for the safety of Hogwarts, Hermione could tell. Even if it seemed as though it may have just been an accident, with no evidence on the contrary.
Harry and Draco had spent the weekend awkwardly shuffling around each other after Saturday and they had hung out during their free period in the morning so now Harry had the entire rest of the late afternoon and evening to himself. Because of this, he ended up in the common room with Ron and Hermione as they did homework - or more accurately, Hermione did homework. Ron and Harry had given up on homework a while ago and were engaged in a game of wizards chess. Hermione had stopped trying to get them to work after a few tries.
"Well, each color deals with a romantic feeling. Red, love; pink, crush; blue, not liking anyone currently; and green, aromantic," Harry glanced over at Draco, taking in the bright red haze surrounding him that never seemed to dim, "and the brighter the color, the more you're feeling that particular emotion."
After a moment of walking Draco seemed to finally realize that Harry wasn’t next to him. He started to turn around when Harry cleared his throat, startling Draco. He stepped backwards slightly, the back of his leg hitting something solid and he quickly ended up on the ground next to a kneeling Harry, holding a ring.
“No, no, I totally agree with you,” Hermione got out around the laughter, “it’s just that you were the one to say it.”
"Who knows," Harry mumbled, head pounding and still confused why Draco was glowing red. "I'm not terribly surprised though."
Their punishment passed awkwardly in the library studying. People looked over at them as they sat there, ignoring each other and as soon as Harry's wand buzzed from the alarm he'd set he jumped up and left the library as quick as he could.
"Keep in mind what my childhood was like," Harry mumbled, averting his eyes back to the pile of pillows at his feet.
"There you are!" Hermione said, standing up from her seat at the table in the great hall, 'I was worried when Madam Pomfrey came and took you out in the middle of class."
"Exactly! And then, the brighter the color, the more admiration or respect you're feeling for someone!"
Harry turned to look at her and lowered his voice as she had done, "Yeah, he finally agreed to go on a date with me."
The day after Christmas felt really lazy. Harry woke up after eleven and was met with an almost silent house. He could hear Molly Weasley Bustling around the kitchen downstairs preparing some sort of food.
Harry knew he was upset, could see it in his shoulders and the expression he made as he hurried away, but he just couldn’t seem to ask him to the Yule Ball. He wanted to hit head against a wall. “I’m so dumb,” he muttered to himself, hurrying to catch up with everyone as well and resolving to try to talk to Ron and Hermione later.
"I'm not taking it off," Harry said, pulling the fabric around himself protectively, "I don't care what they think."
He absently searched for his name and his eyes trailed over to Draco's name. Oh so close to his. Harry was reminded of all the time he had spent watching Draco's name move over the parchment in sixth year and the couple times his eyes had sought out Draco's name during the time he spent searching for horcruxes. Wondering why he hadn't realized sooner that he liked Draco, he set the parchment down on his bed.
By lunch Thursday, Hermione and Ron were sharing worried looks as Harry quietly ate, resoutly staring at his plate.
When the dormitory door closed, Harry took no time in pulling Draco into a kiss. They both stumbled their way to the bed as the back of Draco's knees hit Harry's mattress they both tumbled onto the bed, never breaking their kiss.
"I should probably go make sure he's up before he misses lunch and practice," Ron said, getting up, "Make sure they don't take my food away, I'm not done." With that he hurried off to the dorms to get Harry.
Harry was watching Draco now, the way his eyebrows knit together when he concentrated. He watched him move his hand to the corner of the page when he was about to finish and place his index finger below the page before turning it. Draco also placed his head in his hand and running his fingers through his hair when he worked on a question, he'd probably regret it later when his hair was messy though. Harry's eyes travelled from Draco's hand in his hair to his lips, he was running his lower lip through his teeth. They were soft, Harry knew. Really soft. He smelled like his body wash and citrus and he tasted like alcohol and chocolate that night. Harry wondered what he'd taste like if he hadn't been drinking.
"Yeah, plus Luna is actually the only one underage. She turned 17 in August, remember? And Luna's almost 17, what's the big deal?" Seamus snuck his arm around Dean's waist and Dean pulled him closer to him. They'd taken to doing so when they were talking to people or even just standing around. Hermione figured it might have to do with the fact that they didn't need to hide their relationship anymore, she smiled at them despite herself.
"Alright," Draco said. They stood feeding the thestrals in silence for a moment until Draco spoke up again, "I wanted to say I'm sorry."
"Is that what everyone thought? That I was dating her?" Draco asked laughing, "Nah, I never dated her, plus she likes girls. Er- don't tell anyone that though please, she'd skin me for telling you."
At dinner he decides there is one more thing he needs to do, and when he walks into the great hall he goes to the Gryffindor table instead of the Slytherin table, a whole hall of eyes following him.
"You know," Draco started, "There's no one around here and you said you wanted to kiss me earlier..."
"You really are a mess," Draco sighed, casting the charm and Harry let out a sigh as he suddenly warmed up.
"I'm fine, don't worry. Professor Snape apparently finished analyzing the potion is all," Harry went to sit down when he finally realized Draco was sitting at the Gryffindor table today. A smile spread across Harry's face as he completely forgot he was talking to Hermione and moved to sit down next to Draco, "Hey, it's been a bit since you sat here."
Harry suddenly felt a bit embarrassed about liking Draco as he remembered just how much Ron hated him. How stupid could he be for thinking that there could ever be a possibility that they could get along. "Since several days ago. We've decided to try and be friends." Harry rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly.
"Well," Harry looked for someone to point out, "That waiter over there behind the bar area is green, and the two women in the corner over there are pink." Draco gazed at the people Harry pointed out. Trying to figure out if there was a pattern in the people who glowed the most versus those who didn't.
"I won't kiss him if he doesn't want me to," Blaise announced, getting ready to pick up the bottle of firewhiskey if Neville said no.
"Yeah, yeah," Harry replied, grabbing Draco around the waist and pulling him closer and pressing a light kiss to Draco's lips
"Not really," Harry said evasively, avoiding Ron's eyes and moving his chess piece. It was a bad move and Ron won.
Tryouts started well, that was until Blaise and Ron started fighting. Blaise wasn't even there to try out and was only there to watch the rest of the Slytherins who where, which seemed to infuriate Ron. Harry could see why Ron was angry with Blaise as he had spent the entirety of the tryouts so far cheering on Slytherins and booing everyone else, but he also knew that Blaise was just screwing around and trying to get under Ron's skin. Lately the tension between the two had been growing as Ron seemed to have gotten the idea in his head that Blaise was constantly around Neville because he was plotting something with Draco, and Blaise had simply seemed to make it his mission to keep Ron in a permanent state of anger. Both Harry and Hermione were honestly quite fed up with it.
"The first Quidditch match is today," Harry said, pushing Draco's hair out of his face gently. Draco didn't open his eyes, only humming in response. "Gryffindor vs. Slytherin. You're going to it right?"
Draco let a soft sigh out as he shifted his head on Harry's shoulder. "I have something I want to show you," Harry said after a few more minutes, "I think you'll think it's cool."
"Oh yes, he brought me food when he could. He didn't do much else, but I know that he couldn't afford to do much else in his position," Luna said, smiling down at her food. Ginny took her hand under the table and gave it a squeeze. There was something final about what she said and everyone let the subject drop.
Harry lent forward to kiss Draco lightly and when he was about to pull away Draco grabbed him, pulling Harry on top of him and continuing the kiss.
Harry blushed, "Didn't have time to change and didn't want it to seem suspicious if they caught me leaving. You look really nice though, I missed you."
"Oh, and do tell Pomona thanks as well for me, you both work so hard," Mcgonagall said as Neville and Blaise reached the door.
Draco suddenly got quiet and in a small voice said, "Take the dark mark." It was suddenly very quiet in their shared room as Harry studied Draco carefully who looked like he was trying to curl into himself.
"Oh trust me, I hate that place as much as you. It's horrid in there. I have more sense than to take you there when I finally get you to agree to go on a date with me," Harry laughed and Draco smiled, he liked it when he laughed.
He slowly sat up, surveying the room. The window was open, they must've opened it the night before. His sheets were tossed off the bed along with most of his pillows and Pansy seemed to be using it all as a makeshift bed on the floor.
"Thanks," Harry gave Draco a shy smile that made Draco's stomach flip and his mouth go dry. Draco managed a nod and took the vial back, crossing the room back to his bedside table and placing the vial on it. The air was thick with awkward tension and Draco took his time putting the vial away as Harry stared at his back.
A/N: Trigger warning, homophobic language is referenced, though it is not directed at anyone in specific.
Harry paused for a second, then, "I have no idea who might have done it, and no idea what the effects are. I have noticed people glowing different colors though, and sometimes people glow brighter than others."
"Who wants to bet he's going to try and room with Potter?" Balise said as they got up, earning a glare from Draco shot over his shoulder.
Harry watched his retreating form from the bed and then realized he was still in Draco's bed and hurried to get up and start getting dressed. He was supposed to take a shower but he decided he'd just take one tonight because he didn't think he could handle seeing Draco again when he came out. He spelled his teeth clean and hurried out the door where he met Hermione and Ron.
His eyes suddenly flitted over to Draco across the hall and the thought of taking him crossed his mind for a second before he quickly shut it down. He wasn't going to entertain that thought even for a second.
Harry looked over at Draco and froze. Draco had two large scars cutting across his abdomen and up to his chest. Harry took them in and realized what they were from.
"I saw that you were at least fair with the Quidditch lineup," Draco said, without looking up from his book.
"Sorry, Professor," Harry said, making his way to his desk quickly, Draco following, "We overslept, it won't happen again."
When Harry reached his room he paused and took a deep breath. He let it out and gripped the door handle and opened it to find a dark room.
"Yeah, I mean it's mostly me. Thinking about it, I mean. She doesn't really care if people know, but I was kind of worried about my family."
“Are you going to sit here and tell me I'm wrong?” Ron said, misinterpreting the silence, “It was a valid guess at the very least! With how much care he puts into his looks coupled with the fact that he has literally never looked twice at a girl - besides Pansy, but we all know she’s a lesbian - there’s absolutely no way he’s straight!”
"Dunno, I think she caught a first year using a book as a coaster earlier today and took offence," Ron said back, laughing a bit.
"If I were to ask someone out, I'd make it clear I meant a date," Pansy drawled, "so it is kind of your fault." Blaise snickered.
"Hey guys," Harry said, "wow you got a lot of alcohol this time." Harry took in the massive pile on the table.
It rounded to a stop in front of Ron, "What are the odds you'll swap shirts with Hermione?" Ginny grinned when Ron's face flushed as he looked over at what Hermione was wearing. Hermione had on a pretty, flowery, tight, top. It was something Ron wouldn't be caught dead in. Hermione gave a laugh at the look on Ron's face and counted down from three.
Friday rolled around again and with it came the weekly party the eighth years had begun doing. Everyone was already in a circle when Draco made it down the stairs from his and Harry's shared room.
"You can't come watch the tryouts if you're just going to shout at everyone!" Ron was yelling at Blaise when Harry finally got to them.
"Grateful for the conversation Ron replied enthusiastically back, "Oh yeah! It'll be weird watching from the sidelines instead of playing, though."
"That's where I read with mother," Draco said, pointing out a pretty table and chair set in the corner of the greenhouse. It was surrounded by flowers and vines and sat on a concrete slab. "There's just about every plant you can think of in here, from all around the world."
The train ride passed quickly and before they knew it Harry, Ron, and Hermione were seated at the Gryffindor table in the great hall.
"You two seem to be getting along quite well recently," Ron said, and Hermione sent him a look. Harry wasn't really paying attention to them though, he was busy looking at the way the light hit Draco's hair and made it almost glow.
"Oh it's quite alright," Hermione said as she managed to pull herself together and wipe her eyes, "I just was worried that you two were fighting again, but I'm glad to be wrong. Anyway, how much more time do you two have?"
"Do I need to? He's always a git," Ron laughed and Harry high-fived him over the table and Draco shook his head.
“Shit!” Harry said, frantically checking the time that read 10:56. He was going to be late for sure if he didn’t get going immediately. “I’ll see you later tonight!” Harry called, grabbing his jumper and practically sprinting out the door to the front doors of the school.
Ron's mouth dropped, Luna looked like this was old news, and Hermione gave them a wide smile. "I'm so happy for you guys!" she said as Ron choked on his food. "Oh cut it out Ron," Hermione shot a look at her boyfriend who looked shell-shocked.
Ginny let out a laugh, "Yeah, I guess that probably wouldn't be the best idea. Thanks, for talking to me about this I mean. It helped a lot."
"That's fine, I don't mind," Blaise replied and then pressed his lips to Neville's before he could chicken out.
"Alright, who is going first? I went first last time, someone's got to step up!" said Pansy as soon as everyone was seated.
"You like both? That's a thing?" Harry asked, reeling from the information. You could like both? He could like both?
After a moment Draco pressed a third finger in and Harry's eyes squeezed shut at the intrusion. "Am I-"
"Of course it wouldn't be something easy," Harry groaned, slumping down on the bench, "can't I just have a normal year."
"I just need a new quill first and then we can go, it'll be quick," Draco laughed as he dragged Harry into Scrivenshaft's Quill Shop.
"Um, McGonagall stopped me in the hall and told me to find you because we have to hang out as it's getting close to curfew," at that, Pansy let out a hardly contained snicker and Draco shot her a look.
“‘M’kay,” Draco said, following Harry out of bed to shrug on some pants. Recently he’d started making sure to put on clothes when he wakes up because Pansy had a bad habit of coming through their floo unannounced and a couple times she’d caught them both quite spare of clothes.
Neville and Harry headed out the door first. Blaise leaned over to Draco then and said, "You know, this is kind of like a double date."
"Really? Awww," Ron said leaning a bit into her and kissing her cheek, "wish I made a move sooner." Hermione smiled and entwined her fingers with his.
Both Draco and Harry were dead drunk though and without a second thought Harry was over in front of Draco and kissing him, in less than a second.
If Draco saw the deep blush coating Harry's cheeks, he didn't comment, just let his eyes continue to trail over names.
"You're staring again,'' Pansy said as she looked towards Draco who was currently staring down some girl who was apparently confessing to Potter.
"Come on, let's leave them alone," Harry said, pulling away a shocked Hermione and a still-laughing Ron.
"Oh whatever, Harry won't die from hanging out with Malfoy," Hermione rolled her eyes, "it really is a smart idea: the prime example for disagreement between houses, getting along? That would be setting the perfect example."
Harry flopped back down on his bed to read the letter, pulling out parchment and a quill to write back.
"So, are you two on a date too?" Neville asked and Blaise snickered. Both Harry and Draco blushed bright red.
"That's just the thing!" Draco cut her off, "You didn't think. You're not a master at potions, you had no way to know for sure how the potion would affect us, and you were willing to let us drink it!" Pansy's eyes grew a bit teary as Draco fumed at her, "You never think about these things. You just rush blindly in! Forget the fact that it didn't work like you expected for a moment, what was your plan if McGonagall found out. We're all on a very tight leash here after our involvement in the war and you were ready to throw everything away for what?! For him to confess feelings for me that are more than likely aren't even there?!"
"Eight! Seven! Six!" Ron grabbed Hermione's hand and prepared to take a sip of the glass of champagne he had in his hand.
"Again, we'll help. Okay, step four-" Pansy started to say but before she could the door opened and Pansy slammed the book shut.
"Oh," Harry said, remembering that Hermione was talking to him, "They said that our potion had been mixed with amortentia."
"Malfoy isn't actually a bad roommate, he's just sort of quiet. He keeps to himself most of the time," Harry said, shoving a piece of bacon in his mouth.
There was a general head-nodding in agreement. "Great. Try and score as many points as you can and good luck!"
After breakfast Harry had a free period that he planned to use as time to go explain the color's meaning to Madam Pomfrey. On his way there, though, all he could hear were girls stressing about what they were going to wear.
I'd love to meet up with you. Everyone here also goes to bed shortly after the ball drops. I can apparate to yours if you want?
They made their way around a bend in comfortable silence until Ginny broke it again to stop Luna in her path. "Do you want to do something else tonight?"
His eyes wandered over to where he saw Hermione and Ron walking down the stairs together, Hermione laughing at something Ron had said. They were dressed fairly nicely, not fancy or anything, but still. He figured they were going on a date and hoped Pansy wasn't nearby to see. He knew that Pansy really liked her, even if she pretended she didn't care.
When Draco didn't respond to him though the kid seemed to get angrier, "Did you hear me? Why would they let a Death Eater like you in the school," the kid spat out at Draco. Draco tried not to respond and simply gripped the book tighter. "Knew it was only a matter of time until you decided to attack someone. Stay away from us." By the way he said 'us' Draco knew he meant the Gryffindor house, specifically Harry.
"That's code for 'I'm crying myself to sleep at night cause no girl wants me,'" Blaise said and Pansy immediately rounded on him.
“Mmmm, yeah eventually,” Harry responded. This was their usual routine; Harry would turn off the alarm, Draco would complain about the sound, then Harry would cuddle up next to Draco in bed for another ten minutes.
Harry and Draco set to work as they normally did, working in harmony and complete silence. Harry still felt the awkward tension, but it wasn't as strong while they were working.
"People? Yeah. It shows everyone in the castle at all times. It doesn't even have a delay. There's also secret passageways. The only room that I know of that isn't on here is the room of requirement. But I suppose that could be because it's impossible to plot."
Draco glanced at Harry and quickly looked away and reached for his silverware, cutting into the eggs on his plate and eating silently. Harry did the same but couldn't help but feel nervous. No one had said anything about the elephant in the room and it felt like he and Draco were currently sitting on cracked glass.
"Nobody?" Harry finally asked looking at Ron. He found it slightly hard to believe that absolutely no one wanted to room with him and would rather room with Slytherins.
This was unlike any of their kisses they had shared before, this time they were both sober and no one was forcing them to do so. They just were.
Pomfrey stared at him a moment, looking slightly surprised. Okay, definitely not normal, Harry thought. "Glowing?"
A few more points scored by Slytherin, and Draco was smirking at Harry. He wasn't worried though, there was plenty of time for Gryffindor to rebound.
On another note, I got you a Christmas gift that I was hoping to give you when we got back to school. Or we could possibly meet in Diagon Alley before we go back and I could give it to you then?
Draco had returned from dinner early to start his homework for the weekend, while Pansy and Blaise stayed in the great hall. He pulled out his potions textbook then, flipping to the chapter he had to read to do the required essay. The fire was burning in the grate and he felt the warmth from it on his legs. A sigh escaped his lips as he shrunk lower into the cushions, grateful for the silence of the common room.
They were on better terms of course, but Draco and Harry had been avoiding each other after what had happened after the last party. It was simply too awkward. Not to mention, Harry was still slightly upset over Draco's rejection.
Harry situated himself between Draco's legs and lightly trailed his fingers along the waistband of Draco's underwear.
Pansy snickered next to Draco as Blaise stormed off. Draco was just taking his book out of his bag when Harry finally arrived, with Ron and Hermione.
Draco woke up the next morning to a knock on his door and he quickly looked down to find Harry there where they'd fallen asleep the night before. They were both still naked and there was no way he could claim they were only friends. There was no way he could possibly talk his way out of this.
"You woulda thought he had a missing limb by the way they all looked at him! Parading around him like a spectacle like that!" Ron groaned as they sat down, drawing the blinds to the windows.
"Well they're invisible creatures that fly around your head. They usually mean you're dizzy or in love," Luna replied dreamily.
"Hey, I had a free period so I thought I'd come out a bit early with Seamus to get ready. Seamus is already up in the stands though," Dean said. Harry took in Dean's flushed and rumpled appearance and could guess what 'getting ready' had meant. Harry let out a soft chuckle and set his bag down, starting to change.
Hermione looked up at Harry's face to gauge a reaction over Ron's outburst, and her suspicions were confirmed when she saw the sad look in his eyes as he stared after Ron. Hermione sighed.
"Ugh," Harry groaned, rolling over to peek at Hermione with one eye, "why do I even need to get up? It's a Saturday."
"I wonder how the dormitories are going to work this year as there aren't many of us coming back and the dormitories aren't made for eighth years too," Hermione said, coming to his rescue.
"Sore from what, exactly? Seamus asked and Harry tried not to react, concentrating on not turning red.
Ron leaned over towards her and kissed her on the cheek, as she went to pick up the bottle next. Pansy took a great gulp of firewhiskey as it landed on Padma.
Once everyone was back on the ground and in the locker room Harry stood in front of them to hand out the quidditch schedule. "Our first match is against Ravenclaw in just over two weeks, so no slacking on practice. While it's just for fun, it's still good to play your best and make it a good match."
That had to have been one of the best things that had ever happened to him Draco decided and felt strangely empty as Harry pulled away.
"Wait! Slow down! He kissed you?! Oh my goodness! I'm so happy for you Draco!" Pansy said, throwing her arms around him and hugging him. Draco allowed himself to smile a little bit, he was extremely happy after all.
"Let's just go Ron. If we leave now we can go do something together," Hermione said. By the look Hermione was giving Ron, he was sure he didn't want to know what 'do something together meant' but it did the trick, Ron seemed to edge up a bit.
Draco stopped moving then and turned to look up at him. No one had really been as kind to him as Harry was being now and it made his heart ache, if possible he liked him even more in that moment. "I don't want to be a bother," Draco finally said.
"Sure didn't look like that. He was sitting there with that dumb look on his face staring at you. Anyone could see that he was at least checking you out. I could see it from across the room."
They all walked down to the Quidditch pitch together. Ron and Hermione, Pansy and Blaise, all in a group at the front. Draco and Harry were both lagging behind a bit, too wrapped up in each other to even notice the growing distance between themselves and their friends.
Harry smiled, he always enjoyed hanging out with Draco, "Alright, let me go get my books from my room and we can work till dinner."
There was a Quidditch match again between Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff today and Draco was wrapped up in a scarf that made him look impossibly small and adorable. Harry had to force himself to look away, blushing as red and Draco’s colorful haze.
When Draco finally complied Harry moaned out as Draco hit his prostate again, his toes curling. Draco pressed his hands down on Harry's hips, forcing him into place on the bed, and not allowing him room to move. He moved his mouth to Harry's right nipple and bit down lightly as he thrust forward.
"I thought it would work, Draco! And you all were taking veritaserum anyway, if you had admitted your feelings everyone would have just thought it was the potion!"
Harry had just gotten out of the shower about ten minutes ago and his hair was still dripping wet. Draco hated how Harry never seemed to take care of his hair. He never dried it and hardly ran a comb through it and Draco spent a lot of time wishing he had the courage to ask Harry if he could do it for him. At the same time though, his hair was part of what made him Harry Potter and as much as he said he hated it, he also really thought it was charming.
Coming hard, Harry trembled under Draco as he rode out the last of his orgasm, he tightened around Draco causing him to come as well.
"What did I tell her," Blaise said to Draco as they watched her stumble over to the alcohol table, "A nutter that one is." Draco let out a small laugh and Harry felt his stomach flip at the sound.
Draco looked up from where he was playing with his hands in his lap to meet Harry's eyes, "Green," he blurted out without thinking and when Harry laughed, his face went red.
They both rushed back to the common room to grab their book bags, straightening their clothes as they went.
"There is no such thing as privacy between us," Blaise laughed and leaned back, "Anyway, about this plan."
"Shove off Malfoy," was all Harry managed, because while he was very annoyed that Malfoy decided he needed to barge in just to start an argument, he brought up the very subject that he was trying to avoid mentioning: himself and Ginny and dating- and now he just felt embarrassed.
“That is like the worst possible thing you could have done, was that why you two were ignoring each other for a while?”
Blaise cleared his throat, trying to break some of the tension in the air and gain his composure. He quickly picked up the bottle and gave it a spin.
"Do you ever wish you had help with it?" Blaise continued, peeking over at Neville's face and bracing himself for the question he was going to ask next.
Hermione could see how nervous he was as they sat down at the table for breakfast. Harry had decided to drop it off to Draco by owl because he was worried Draco would just walk away if he tried to give it to him, so now he was nervously waiting for the post to arrive.
Harry gathered his things up and bade farewell to them, before Ron even recovered, and followed Draco out of the Great Hall.
He raised his wand to Goyle's hair and whispered the incantation. The group watched from across the room as Goyle's hair changed color from the roots out. They could barely make it out in the moonlight and they resolved to enjoy the new color in the morning.
"You look nice," Blaise said with a smirk as Draco emerged from their shared bathroom, "did you finally land a date?"
Draco's hair was just perfectly messed up and it seemed to glow in the light that streamed through the open doors. Harry was reminded all over again why he was in love with him.
"I think that Draco is trying to be a better person," Hermione said, "He can't help how he was brought up and I think that if he learns from the mistakes he made and apologizes, I can forgive him. I don't think Harry is being too forgiving; we were all just kids."
"Thanks." Harry guided Draco down some back roads then, they had been aimlessly making their way through the streets and ended up down some alleyway when Draco had an idea.
"We just fell asleep and didn't have an alarm," Harry mumbled, trying to figure out what on earth he was supposed to be working on, and praying that Hermione and Ron would do the same. He wanted them to let it go, not to mention that they were both glowing brighter than Draco was currently, and it was hurting his head to look at them. He wasn't so lucky though.
Harry thought about how soft Draco's lips were as he made his way into the compartment Hermione and Ron currently occupied. He'd miss being able to kiss Draco over the break.
"What's that?" Draco said, pointing to the blank paper when Hermione had left and Harry had closed the door. "It sounded dangerous."
Harry picked up one of the cups of alcohol and put it in front of her, "I dare you to drink that without using your hands."
"All good, all good, just don't make a habit of it," Slughorn said, turning back to the board where he was explaining some potion.
"They treated you poorly didn't they? What did they do specifically," Draco felt worried, then he added, "You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, I don't mean to pry."
"Yeah," Ron said around a mouth full of chicken, then he tried to continue but no one could understand with his mouth full.
He looked over at Ron who was sound asleep on his bed, snoring peacefully. He sighed laying back down and relaxing back into his pillow. They'd all stayed up late the night before, opening presents and eating junk food. He was about to close his eyes and try to fall back asleep for a bit longer when he heard tapping on his window. With a groan he got up to open the window.
"Well then help me come up with one," Harry said, walking over to Draco's bed and flopping down on it.
Draco made a face, “I saw your dancing then, it was subpar, and I’m guessing you have not practiced since either, huh?”
"Oh," Draco visibly deflated, but Harry had turned back to his food to take another bite and didn't seem to notice.
"Wow, you offend me," Draco muttered and that was the last thing Harry remembered before he fell asleep feeling more content and safe than he had in awhile.
When they were all seated around the table eating Harry finally wondered if he should tell them where he had been and why. Draco's parents had reacted well, so their reaction couldn't be too bad right?
"I just suggest trying dating a guy," Seamus said, "Or try being with a guy, if you know what I mean." Seamus wiggled his eyebrows and Harry went red.
I'm glad everything went well with your coming out. I'm actually thinking about telling my parents as well. I'm not sure how my mother will take it and I know my father will be anything but pleased but I'm sick of hiding it and my parents have been talking about possible marriages lately. I think I will do it sometime after Christmas so I don't have very long before school starts if they get mad.
Ginny smiled at him, "Thanks, it means a lot. I want to say sorry too, I mean I didn't exactly help things. I didn't make any effort to try and talk either." Ginny gave a small laugh, things were starting to look like they could go back to normal.
"This is not a punishment, be happy that you're not both in detention. Now, do I make myself clear?"
"Oh don't be a wimp," Pansy groaned, "Potter did it with no issues last time." Pansy then seemed to get an idea and a shit-eating grin crossed her face, "You're going to let Potter win?" That seemed to do the trick and Draco set the cup down, crawling over to Harry.
"Yeah, you're one to talk, Draco. At least the rest of us have admitted we're gay and you're still just sitting there pretending to be straight," Pansy replied.
"Oh," realization seemed to dawn on Draco's face, "I mean, it's not common, but it's still accepted. It's a natural thing, why wouldn't they accept it?"
Harry sent him a glare as he finally got the vine to let go, "What great help you are," he muttered, "and I didn't sleep through the whole class."
"The potions essay, for Slughorn. I'm completely lost and it doesn't make any sense," Harry groaned, throwing his head back and tossing his arm over his face.
She found her walking down the hall almost immediately and quickly told her what was going on and in seconds they were up in Draco and Harry's dorm room.
Harry made his way out of the castle to where Care of Magical Creatures was being held. He had a feeling that he may be a bit late.
The party was loud loud, and Harry's eyes were hurting from all the lights quicker than he'd like to admit.
Ginny came out today as well and Luna stopped by. Ginny and I came out together actually, I suggested it cause she seemed really nervous. Turned out, there was nothing to worry about, everyone took it extremely well, apparently Charlie is Asexual and Aromantic as well.
When Pansy made it back to the circle without falling, the game resumed and in a couple rounds Luna was getting up to press a light kiss to Pansy's lips. Blaise hoped that'd make her happy, but instead it seemed to do the opposite as she flopped down on her back and complained about how badly she wanted a girlfriend.  (Me too Pansy)
"Yes, and you've seemed so willing to return that friendliness since we've been back. You've been ignoring me," he shot back. Draco took this as his cue to lean in close, putting his mouth next to Harry's ear and he could feel his breath tickle his ear. Harry's face heated up as he stumbled backwards towards the table, but Draco grabbed his hip before Harry could get very far. Harry stiffened slightly at the contact.
"Never have I ever had dyed hair," Neville said. Lavender took a shot and so did Goyle. The former didn't look very happy about it though and sent a glare around the circle, his hair was still slightly orange.
"Oh hey, there you are," Draco greeted him as he entered the common room, "you disappeared after class, I was wondering where you went."
"What exactly are Wrackspurts, Luna?" Ron mumbled around a bite of food at Hermione shot him a look at which he promptly closed his mouth and continued chewing, this time with his mouth closed.
"Yeah, it's pretty obvious. You look at him too softly for you to truly hate him," Dean said, setting his own armful of alcohol down on the table.
"Uh," Harry wasn't sure he wanted to explain that the only reason he knew was because his two best friends got laid to the school nurse. "We realized because of the brightness of the colors," it wasn't a total lie, "the brighter the color the more you are feeling love or like towards a person."
Draco watched as Harry stood up and disappeared out the gap in the curtains and soon after he heard the water turn on. He let out a sigh, Harry was just too good for him. No matter what Harry said, he deserved much better than him, Draco thought.
"Shit!" Harry cried out as Draco thrust into him at a different angle, "Right there," he said as Draco hit his prostate and his fingers curled into fists against the wall. Harry's back arched into Draco as he brought his hand down from the wall to grasp Harry's neglected erection, stroking him to each thrust.
"Hi, um I was having trouble again in herbology lately and was hoping you could help me?" That was another thing that had changed: Blaise had been coming to Neville for help more and more often. At first, it confused Neville as Blaise really hadn't gone out of his way to talk to him before, but soon Neville started to feel a bit of pride in the fact that Blaise was going to him for help. It showed that Blaise thought he was competent enough in the subject that he was willing to ask him for help, and since Neville wasn't much good in any other subject he greatly appreciated it.
Neville quickly shut his eyes as Blasie kissed him, he knew he wasn't supposed to have his eyes open as he kissed at least. The kiss was quick and over a bit faster than both of them wanted. When it was over, Blaise rushed back to his place in the circle, both his and Neville's faces' coloring fast.
"Blaise really likes Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans too. Blaise once bought one of those packs filled with only the bad ones for Pansy as a gag gift; she gagged at a few really bad ones and then refused to ever eat them again. It was so funny we never told her," Draco let out a light laugh as he related the story to Harry.
Tonight, the sky was clear and Draco could see stars, bright above them. The night was warm and he could hear cicadas in the trees, summer was always nice.
"I am not bottoming," Draco said, nose turned up at the idea of a Malfoy bottoming. Or at least that's what Harry guessed Draco wanted him to think, Harry could tell that he was scared though and his face softened.
“Ah, here it is,” Pansy held out a nice suit that she’d pulled out from her closet. It was a dark blue and Draco could tell it had cost quite a bit.
"Uh- I'd love to, but I'm really not looking for a relationship right now," he settled on, it wasn't a complete lie as he didn't really want to date as he still wasn't sure if he wanted to date boys or girls, "I'm really sorry," he added in hopes to make her feel even slightly better because by now she seemed to have grabbed the attention of the entire table and some people from other tables had started to take notice as well.
The next day Harry woke up without a headache, but it quickly returned when he entered the great hall to see the mess of reds, pinks, blues, and greens.
His hair caught the light and seemed to glow in the sun, though it could also be due to the fact that he actually was glowing.
"Harry! Thank goodness you're okay," Hermione said, pulling him into a hug, giving Draco a slightly awkward glance. Her and Ron still were a bit wary around Draco and Harry couldn't really blame them, but they weren't downright refusing to accept that Harry and Draco were friends now, which Harry thought was good. "Were there any weird effects of the potion? What happened exactly?"
"I told you two not to bring alcohol, they're underage," Hermione hissed to Dean as she waved towards where Luna and Ginny sat, talking quietly between themselves.
"Yeah, don't let Hermione hear you say that. She's already got it set in her head that this was a good idea, and you'd only reinforce it."
"Climbed a tree," Draco muttered, and before anyone could question it he got up and excused himself to go to bed. Everyone followed his lead and Dean and Seams rounded up the alcohol before leaving.
"You have to hang out with Malfoy?? She can't make you do that!" Ron sputtered indignantly as they made their way down the corridor towards the Great Hall.
She wanted to pull her hair out when Draco sat down next to Harry in the stands. In the Gryffindor section no less. Either he didn't notice or didn't care that he was out of place. Him and Harry argued back and forth, completely in their own world.
"What no, of course not," Harry responded. Of course he didn't care, he was just too busy being shocked by the fact that Ron and Hermione had really not cared at all - the wizarding world really was very different from the muggle world - to have a big reaction.
"Just sounds like an excuse to me," Draco said as Harry paid for his candy, Draco following his lead.
"Alright," Harry said with a smile, reminded of when they'd work on homework together when they first got assigned their punishment by McGonagall. Now though, they were doing it as a study date and Harry couldn't be any happier.
"You ready?" Draco said and a very small shy smile spread across his features and Harry had to remember how to breathe.
"Well if he didn't always start-" Harry began and McGonagall sent him a look that made him snap his mouth shut.
"It's a practice snitch," Draco responded, almost like he read Harry's mind. "It won't move until you press this." He turned the snitch over and pointed out a small button on the snitch, "You can set it not to leave a certain area, that way you won't lose it."
Draco's mind was spinning, on one hand, he knew Harry along with everyone else was worried someone had infiltrated Hogwarts again and he really should let them know that it wasn't a death eater. On the other hand, though, Pansy was his best friend (even if he was furious at her at the moment) and he had no idea what would happen to her if anyone found out. He couldn't tell anyone if he wanted to protect her too.
Harry was suddenly worried "monitoring" him meant keeping him in the hospital wing, "You don't mean I have to stay here, right?"
Harry leaned in and gave Draco a kiss that he'd meant to be quick but before he could pull away Draco was grabbing his hips, pulling Harry closer and quickly deepening the kiss. Harry quickly responded after a moment of surprise, moving his own hands to Draco's hips.
Suddenly he felt like he was being watched and swept his eyes over the room to find both Harry and Draco looking at them from across the room. Neville gave a small laugh and Blaise looked up from his drink.
"Your brother didn't care in the slightest. I don't think they will either," Luna said, placing an arm around Ginny's shoulder as they stared down at a small envelope that sat on the bed.
He tried to sit up in bed and ended up falling back with a groan when a sharp pain shot up his abdomen. Right, Potter sliced me open.
"What are the odds of you..." Ron asked Draco, trailing off as he thought. Then, a horrible smirk spread across his lips, "addressing me as Sir for the next week."
"What- what happened last night stays between us okay!" Draco shouted in a panic and quickly got up and hurried off to the bathroom to hide his quickly reddening face.
Without another word, Harry scooped him up and dropped him in the water, robes and all. Draco came up sputtering and shivering a moment later.
"Yeah, it can be difficult, with just the two of us. But it's worth it," Neville replied with a small smile, equally happy for the awkward silence being broken and talking about his favorite thing.
"Ron, leave it. Tryouts are over, let's go back inside," Harry said trying to grab Ron's arm and drag him away from Blaise, but Ron just shook him off.
"It's a strong contributing factor," Harry laughed, watching Draco's eyes trail over the paper, trying to pick out names of people he knew.
"Sorry," Harry responded, sitting down next to Luna, who was sitting next to Ginny again, ensuring himself a good view of Draco. That is, if he didn't have his back to Harry. Draco was resountly sitting with his back to Harry, trying to ignore him, this bothered Harry more than he cared to admit.
As soon as Harry had caught the snitch he'd gone straight for the ground. He felt like he'd die if he stayed on the broom for another minute. His whole body ached and he was beyond glad the match was over which was a first for him.
“Well they did, mostly. Sometimes if too much is going on though ontop of all the colors, or there’s a lot of people, it can be a bit much.”
His head seemed to stop spinning after gulping down the disgusting liquid, but the haze remained, "What happened?"
"They didn't like me too much. They weren't fond of magic. My uncle hated the mention of magic and my cousin followed his lead," Draco stared up at him, he had a feeling he knew where this was going.
"Still felt too long to me," Pansy said, swinging her arms at her sides as they made it up the hill.
When they reached the kitchen Harry had to take a second to take in the sheer amount of food. Molly was really out-doing herself this year, he thought as he took a seat between Ron and George.
"Yeah, sorry about that," Draco smiled back, one of his soft smiles that seemed to be reserved for just Harry.
Almost everyone except the Slytherin's cheered as Gryffindor won and Cooper descended to the ground to be surrounded by her teammates.
"What?" Harry said, seemingly startled out of whatever he was thinking about while staring Malfoy down across the room.
Harry decided, in this moment, that this was the best kiss he'd ever had and would happily die kissing Draco Malfoy. Then his stomach twisted at the realization of what liking this kiss meant and he suddenly sobered up as he pushed back from Draco who kept his eyes closed for a moment not wanting it to be over.
"Budge over," Draco said, already climbing into bed next to Harry. Harry moved over a bit and Draco leaned his head onto his shoulder. Harry's heart hammered in his chest.
"Ohh~ So this mysterious boyfriend has a name now?" Pansy smirked at him as Blaise buried his head in his hands and groaned. "Plus it's been more than just homework help. You're even helping him out with that little project of his."
"No, you're not. You've read all week and I'm getting sick of it. All you do is sit there and read and I'm just confined to the room as you do it. It sucks."
Harry only tugged on Draco's underwear in response. Draco lifted his hips up to allow him to remove the offending article and sucked in a breath when the cold air assaulted him. Harry was back between his legs quickly though and soon Draco was back to wishing Harry would stop teasing him.
Draco wasn't in bed with Harry when he awoke the next morning, and he felt a little sad until the bathroom door opened and he was rewarded with the sight of Draco in a bath towel. The towel was wrapped around his upper chest again, and he couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.
"Raine Anderson," McGonagall called from the front of the room where she was holding a piece of parchment and standing next to a stool with an old hat on it.
"No buts. There's no excuses for your non-stop bickering! I've been thinking and the other professors and I have come up with a few ideas that might help promote better behavior from the two of you," Draco and Harry immediately shared frightened looks, whatever she was about to say, both of them knew they wouldn't like it, "in lue of inter-house unity, I've decided that you two will be those that set the example. I want you two to be spending at least an hour a day on school days and two on weekends in each others company. This can be simply studying together or actually doing something fun but you need to spend it together. Do I make myself clear?"
It was three in the morning when Draco woke up. At first he wasn't sure what woke him up until he looked over to see Harry thrashing around in his bed. Draco watched him for a moment, trying to decide what to do. He suddenly noticed the tears rolling down Harry's cheeks as he rolled about on his bed.
"Yeah, class started over twenty minutes ago, and we didn't see you at breakfast," Hermione hissed to them. They were all seated in a line, Ron and Hermione to his left and Draco to his right with Pansy and Blaise next to him. Harry figured they were currently grilling Draco too.
"Oh! Before you go, I heard people are starting a ton of new clubs this year. You know, school unity and all that jazz. But the point is, there's going to be a fair-like thing on Sunday for all the clubs. Want to join Crabbe, Blaise and I? I suppose it's worth checking out. Plus I heard there's gonna be food and stuff."
"Like teasing Malfoy?" Neville said with a knowing smile at Blaise who suddenly looked slightly worried. "Don't worry, I won't say anything, but you guys really aren't the most quiet."
"Oh, we all know that you like him Blaise, don't act like you're just going for help," Draco said a smirk spreading over his face.
"Well we had to know if you were the heir!" Harry said scooting down a bit so Draco could get more comfortable on his shoulder. Draco scooted over a bit more and relaxed.
"Don't worry, I won't. What about you two? Anything new?" Harry said with a slight smirk at Ron who turned a light shade of pink. He knew that Ron had been trying to go a step further with Hermione for months but just couldn't get up the courage. Ron chose to ignore Harry's implication though.
"Your face says it all," Pansy said, finally moving out of the doorway and walking up next to Draco, "here, let me help." Pansy picked up the small container of hair-styling potion. "You need to style it, but don't slick it back. You're not your dad. You need your own style."
Harry laughed as they bickered over Ron's eating habits and Ginny turned towards him. "Did you go to Hogsmeade with Malfoy?"
"They were kissing when I came in," Ron hissed to Hermione when he got back and Hermione's head jerked to look at him.
Draco could feel sweat forming on the back of his neck, despite the cold air. "Not sure. I suppose someone could have accidentally spilled amortentia into the potion and doesn't want to get in trouble, so they don't come forward." He knew Harry wasn't gullible enough to believe that, but he could hope. Maybe if he could get Harry to think that, he could get the rest of the staff to believe it too, then Pansy could get off scot free and they could put it all behind them.
“Come on, time to get up. You’ve gotta get dressed,” Harry said, pressing his lips to Draco’s once before sitting up.
Blaise absentmindedly turned to look at who was sitting to his left and suddenly remembered that he was seated next to Neville when his eyes met Neville's. Neville's face was one of slight shock as Hermione started the countdown.
Harry tried his best to walk normally into the Great Hall for breakfast, he really did, but he couldn't help it. Hermione noticed something was up almost immediately, especially when he tried to sit down and his face scrunched up in pain. He managed to fend off her questions by telling her he'd just practiced extra hard last night for Quidditch and was just sore, but Seamus and Dean were sending him knowing looks all through breakfast.
He was just curious about him, that's all, and trying to understand why he kept thinking about the night in the astronomy tower after the Quidditch match. He was also trying to understand why he couldn't think about the Yule Ball next month without thinking about Draco as well. They always seemed to exist in the same space next to each other in his mind.
"Well I just hope you know what you're doing Harry," Molly said, "I know you two didn't get along in the past..."
Harry only glared at him and then seemed to get an idea, "I was thinking we should do the prank on Filch tonight. Our first match as the eighth year team is this weekend and having fireworks for after the match would be pretty cool."
Harry leaned further into Draco, bringing his hands up to run them through Draco's hair. Draco's hands went to Harry's head, as he cupped his face, deepening the kiss. Harry ran his tongue across Draco's lower lip, asking for entrance and Draco eagerly granted it. The kiss deepened further and Harry's hands dropped from Draco's hair to his hips and Draco moved his own to Harry's hair. Lips traveled over cheeks and down to necks before making their way back to each other's mouths. It was intoxicating and Harry felt drunk.
"Yeah?" Ginny said with a small laugh, "Good for you then. What made you realize that? Was it Malfoy?" She said it like a joke but when Harry just turned redder and didn't meet her eyes she let out a small gasp, "No way! You like Malfoy!"
Draco turned pink at the ears, "Good thing we are then," Draco said, but he couldn't manage to say it with enough conviction that Harry would believe him.
"Best not to try and move around too much. The spell that caused that was dark magic, so I wasn't able to heal you. The best I could do was keep it from bleeding too much." Draco moved his hand to feel the bandages that were wrapped around his chest. "It's a good thing Professor Snape showed up when he did, I imagine it could have turned out a lot worse," Pomfrey said, waving her wand around and muttering spells. "Okay, take this for any pain and make sure to get some rest."
Draco lost it then, the tears coming back as he slumped forward into Blaise's chest. Draco wasn't one to initiate physical contact with anyone and Blaise was caught off guard for a moment before wrapping his arms around Draco's shaking shoulders.
"You two are unbelievable," Hermione sighed then turned back to the list and circled their names. "Okay, well since we have the keeper and seeker we still need the rest of the team. Pansy, Goyle, Ernie Macmillan, and Bulstrode all tried out for beater, who do you guys want?"
Draco let out a sigh and dropped his hand, “Yeah, but I don’t feel like going.” With that, he muttered about getting left behind by their friends and hurried up to them.
And as for Draco, his friends weren't so forgiving. Pansy took it upon herself to shout "Saint Potter~" in a high-pitched voice every time Draco left to see him: successfully allerting the entire eighth-year, Slytherin, dorms to Draco's endeavors and embarrassing him in the process. This embarrassment was partly due to the fact it would catch the whole dorms attention, but mostly because it had more meaning than just a dig. It was right after Christmas break and Pansy walked in on Harry teasing Draco about things he said in the past- hence the 'Saint Potter'- and then thoroughly snogging Draco.
"He has to know or it won't make any sense-" Hermione was saying when he sat down, interrupting her, "oh, hey Harry."
"Yeah, I know you do, I do too," Blaise said, leaning his head against Pansy's shoulder as they sat in front of the fire.
"Course," Harry paused for a moment as he watched Draco shift on the pillows, "I can run a bath for you if you'd like, it might help a bit."
"Well I'd hope not, you already have enough people who do that for you, don't you?" Draco realized he'd hit a sore spot just as he said it because Harry's whole body stiffened, and he suddenly felt really bad. "I'm sorry- I didn't mean-"
"We went to the library this morning to get some homework done and lost track of time," Harry said and Draco had to cover his mouth so they didn't hear the laugh that struggled to escape.
Blaise glared at her and then turned back to Draco, "What's gotten into you all of a sudden? Just last week you would've had no problem with it."
Harry slumped down into the seat next to Draco in the dining hall for dinner, "This is a first, you're never here before I am."
"In that case, Macmillan's out too, he couldn't even manage to stay on his broom the entire tryout," Ron replied.
“Hey, I came outside for those sometimes you kno-” Harry cut him off by pressing his lips to Draco’s. The protest died in his throat, letting his arms find their way behind Harry’s neck, pulling him closer.
"Uh- oh yes! Thanks, that makes perfect sense." In all honesty Harry hadn't heard a word and was more preoccupied with noting just how light Draco's eyelashes are. He'd ask Hermione about the essay tomorrow.
Hermione watched Harry blush as Pansy and Draco fought with each other and smiled. Oh how much has changed since first year, thought Hermione.
"Alright, well we could hold tryouts on Wednesday this week, I think that's the ninth," Harry said, "What do you think Ron."
“Date?” Ginny, Luna, and Neville questioned all at once, eyes wide as they turned to take in Draco and Harry.
"One on personality or something I've worked hard at, you know?" Hermione said, "Something that isn't based on looks."
"It appears someone tampered with the potion after all," Pomfrey said, "Though we have no idea who, why, or what the effects are except the colors..." She trailed off, letting Harry process the information before starting again, "Do you have any idea who might have done it, or any ideas about the potion's effects?"
Draco pressed his lips to Harry's forehead and then captured Harry's lips in a soft kiss when he looked up. Harry sighed into the kiss and Draco pulled Harry further into himself. He slowly pulled away after a moment to look into Harry's eyes, "I love you, you know."
He was also wondering how long Draco had liked him for, if Draco had thought he liked him back, if he did like Draco back.
“I’m pretty sure no one is going to be paying such close attention to our dancing that I need to be perfect at this.”
"That's good, I was worried when you collapsed," Draco said. Harry looked over at him; his head was down and he had a look in his eyes Harry couldn't quite place. The look made him feel oddly bad and he reached his hand out, fingers grazing Draco's before grabbing his hand and giving a gentle squeeze.
Harry would find himself leaning into Draco's shoulder as they sat at the top of the tower. Or he'd find himself scooting closer to Draco as they worked on homework. Even when studying, it never really seemed boring anymore.
"Alright, we should do it just after dinner though, he goes back to his office for a few moments and then makes his rounds. We can strike as he's leaving his office, or just before," a mischievous look took over Draco's face and Harry smiled. He liked seeing this side to Draco.
"Never have I ever gotten detention," Lavender said. She hadn't gone to the last few and most were just fine with that, and where kind of bummed that she decided to show up again.
He looked for the new seeker now, finally spotting the young fourth year that had taken his old position on the team. The girl looked nervous, Harry noticed. He remembered how nervous he was for his first game as seeker.
Harry couldn't help but agree, but before he could say so, he caught sight of Draco coming down the stairs. He was dressed in dark clothes that hugged his figure and Harry willed his heart rate to calm down.
Draco hated himself for getting up in the middle of the great hall at the end of dinner to walk over to Potter of all people, especially with all the stares he was earning. He didn't know why but he felt the distinct need to show the entire great hall that he had some kind of claim over Harry. He would adamantly deny that his sudden show of possessiveness had anything to do with the recent inflow of constant confessions to The Boy Who Lived though. The love letters, although annoying beyond belief, had nothing to do with it at all. Nothing. And the night they spent together two days ago also meant nothing, of course.
Harry woke up, head pounding, in the hospital wing with barely any memory of how he'd gotten there. He tried to sit up, but didn't make it up far before he was flopping back onto the bed with a groan, his head spinning.
"Yeah? Then try and explain why you're shaking like a leaf," he said, leaning his head to look into Harry's eyes.
"Alright," Hermione sighed, realizing she'd never win, "but you two better give them some hangover potion tomorrow if they feel bad."
"No you don't. You're always so," Harry brushed his lips against Draco's neck as he spoke, "reserved." Draco let out a shuddering sigh at the feeling of Harry's lips on his neck.
Draco felt himself start to crumble as he saw the look on Harry's face. He really loved him and that look was beyond cute. If his father didn't know, why shouldn't he enjoy himself a little bit...
Hermione raised her eyebrows at him, "Okay, I'll humor you. If you aren't stalking him because you think he's up to something, then why are you?"
Luckily for Draco, a couple rounds passed were Harry didn't kiss anyone and he let himself calm down. Just as he was letting out a shaky breath, the bottle rolled to a stop in front of him. He looked up to find Lavender staring back with a hungry look in her eye and he got the distinct impression he was about to be eaten alive.
"I'm with Harry on this one Hermione," Ron piped up, "Malfoy always starts everything." Hermione glared at him, which promptly shut him up.
“Yeah, I mean it,” Harry breathed, “I wanted to ask you to the Yule Ball too, that is if you aren’t still planning on not going?”
He found the eighth-year dorms quickly, pointing to the names of Hermione and Ron alone, well after curfew, in the common room, "Think they're making out in there?" he asked, laughing at the disgusted face Harry made.
When Harry showed up, Draco was with him and they quickly separated to go to their respective tables.
"If it isn't Harry Potter," a voice drawled from the compartment door, cutting off Hermione and causing the four of them to turn their heads.
Her cough had drawn the attention of not only Harry, but also those sitting around him and the girl's face colored as Ron and Hermione, turned to look at her.
The end-of-the-year feast went by in a blur and Draco, Pansy, and Blaise sat at the Gryffindor's table per Draco's request and despite the weird looks from the teachers' table.
"So, you wouldn't like it if I did this?" and Draco kissed him, full on the mouth and Harry made a sound between a groan and a gasp, too shocked to move as he pulled away with the same stupid smirk on his face that makes Harry's heart pound - though he'd never admit it.
"I've been meaning to ask, growing all the potions ingredients just you and Professor Sprout must take a while."
Hermione and Harry were the only ones to take a shot and Hermione shuddered at the memory. She did not like flying.
"No, not that, I mean- they're dating? Since when?" Harry asked, surprise written all over his face.
"Where were you two?" Ron whisper-yelled to Harry as the professor tried to grab the class' attention once again.
"Well, I was mad at first," Lucius admitted, "but your mother helped. I was mostly worried about you, especially since you liked the exact person who the Dark Lord was against. I've learned a lot over the last few years and especially after Potter helped us all stay out of azkaban, I don't think you could have picked someone better."
"Let's just do homework in the common room," Draco said upon noticing Harry. Draco rounded up his books from his bed and walked out of the dorm without a second glance towards Harry.
Draco found himself hiding out in the library with Pansy after classes had ended for the day, putting off having to go to the dormitories and having to spend that stupid hour with Potter.
“Yeah, I suppose you’re right,” Harry said, giving up on his hair and heading over to sit across from Ron on his bed.
His wish came true as he was able to make it all the way back to the common room without seeing anyone. His luck ended when he made it into the room though and caught sight of Ron and Hermione kissing on the couch.
"Yeah, I used to cook for my aunt and uncle actually which wasn't exactly fun, but when I stayed at Ron's house over the summer I helped his mom with the cooking and found I really enjoyed it." Harry felt kind of proud of himself, especially when he noticed that Draco was giving him an impressed look.
"Common room?" Harry said as he came up behind Draco who was hiding at the back of the library with Pansy and Blaise as usual.
Harry went red at all the possibilities of answers to that question, he quickly took a shot before an answer could spill from his lips.
Hey guys! That was the last chapter! There will still be an epilogue of course, so look out for that though.
"Ah!" Draco could feel him shudder as Harry slammed his hips backwards into Draco and came for the second time, practically shouting Draco's name as he tightened around him, sending Draco over the edge.
Draco sent him a small smile and a thanks in return and Harry's heart swelled. Harry quickly looked around and then grabbed Draco's hand, giving it a slight squeeze.
"I'll be alright," Harry said, turning to continue walking. Draco watched him walk for a moment before hurrying to catch up.
Ron had reached the dorms in record time due to his desire to hurry back to his food at the table waiting for him. He yanked the door open in time to see Draco fall to the floor with a loud thud.
"Did you now? Is he the cause of your 'gay awakening'?" He didn't think it was possible, Harry got even redder.
Harry paced around his dorm room, Ron had just left so he had the room to himself. He'd been thinking about Draco kissing him for days and it was starting to hurt his brain. He had a million questions.
This is bad, he thought, feeling his body grow warmer as he watched the way Draco's muscles flexed as he struggled with his shirt.
"I'm pretty sure that's just a Gryffindor trait," Draco said and Harry laughed, returning to the restroom to get dressed, Draco watched him go with a smile.
Summer break had hit Hogwarts finally after a long year filled with actual studying- due to Hermione's insistence. Eighth year had come and gone quite quickly in Harry's opinion. But if you asked Ron, summer hadn't come soon enough. Though, of course, Ron happened to be dating someone who apparently prized school above her own life. While Harry dated someone who decided he was too smart for school again and only came back to appease his mother. He, unlike Hermione, decided to prize sneaking off and making out with Harry above studying.
"Okay, so today we're going to play a different game," Pansy announced. She had seemed to have become the unofficial leader of the parties. "It's a game that the lovely Hermione suggested," Pansy winked and tilted her cup of firewhiskey at Hermione who lightly blushed; Ron looked mildly shocked, "called Paranoia. For those who don't know how to play, it's simple: one person will start the game off by whispering a question to the person to their left. Then, that person has to name a person in the circle as an answer. Then that person would flip a coin, heads, and they have to tell what the question was. Tails, and they don't have to say the question. Rules are that you can't talk about the question ever if the coin lands on tails. That means you can't tell someone else what the question was after the game." Pansy paused for a moment, "So, I'll give an example of how the game would be played now. I'd turn to Draco here and ask him who he thinks is the smartest and he'd say Hermione. Then I'd flip this sickle here," Pansy gave it a flip, "And it's landed on tails so I'd then tell everyone what the question was. Any questions?"
"How was the date?" Blaise asked, voice way too chipper for it being two in the morning. "It must have gone well, with how late it is" Blaise said and Draco didn't have to be able to see him to know he was smirking.
Draco looked to where the two were furiously kissing and his eyes widened as he started to realize what might be happening with the potion. He prayed he was wrong.
He made it back to his dorm an hour later, eyes puffy and swollen, but finally feeling composed enough to make his way back to his room. He was hoping Blaise would be asleep when he arrived, but as he opened the door and Blaise's voice rang out through the dark, he realized he wasn't going to be so lucky.
"That's my job as your best friend. It's also my job to get you to do fun things, and that is why you should come to the party."
The two hours passed extremely slowly and Harry spent most of his sneaking glances over his book at Draco.
An hour later and Pansy was slurring her words and complaining that she hadn't gotten to kiss anyone yet.
"Yeah," Harry seemed relieved by the change in subject, "Gryffindor vs. Slytherin is next weekend on the seventh of November and our first match is against Ravenclaw on the 14th."
"Not at all. She's insufferable," Pansy said with a scoff, "Always telling me I should be more lady-like and then going and throwing herself at the feet at any man who offers a bit of power and money, like a common whore."
Ron groaned and muttered something about having terrible luck as Draco picked the bottle back up. It landed on Pansy next and she looked at Draco eagerly. "What are the odds of you playing the rest of the game without a shirt?"
"The rumors are false and you're an idiot for just blindly trusting what others have been saying," Harry said through gritted teeth. "He's not a Death Eater, you can't define people by their past mistakes! And he didn't attack me!" Harry practically shouted the last sentence and it gained the attention of the entire room. "If I hear one more person say he attacked me, they'll be finding themselves unable to talk for the rest of the school year!" Harry shouted, quickly gathering his and Draco's things before Madam Pince could come over and kick them out herself.
"Yeah? I think it'd be a lot more enjoyable than being an auror. I've had enough running after bad wizards for a lifetime I think," Harry let out a dry laugh.
Draco led Harry to the gate where he'd be able to apparate from. "I'll see you when we get back to school," Draco said, pulling Harry into a quick hug.
"Didn't know you were in here either until I looked over and saw you a second ago either," Harry lied, looking down at his book before Draco looked at him too closely and caught him in the lie.
By the time Ginny picked up the bottle to start her turn, Draco wanted to stop playing. He in no way wanted to watch as Harry kissed another person.
"Well I vote Bulstrode out, she couldn't hit a bludger to save her life and I'm pretty sure she was just out there for a laugh," Harry said.
"Well, I better go then. I have some homework to finish still," Neville said, and Blaise couldn't help feeling a little disappointed.
They'd go somewhere and study, or sit at the top of the astronomy tower and look out over the grounds, way past curfew. It was nice, better than nice. It was one of the only times Harry felt like he could relax and let himself go.
"You do realize that your house is Gryffindor and that everyone on that team is younger than both of you? It won't exactly be a fair match, plus I heard they have second years," Hermione laughed a bit at Ron's put-out expression. "I'll still be there though," Hermione finally said, and a smile broke out across Ron's face. Hermione turned back to her book, a small smile crossing her lips.
"No one seems to like what house they're being placed in this year," Harry finally said after the fifth person to be placed somewhere other than Gryffindor looked longingly after the Gryffindors.
"Come on, I know a hall that not many people walk though," Ginny said and started to lead him through the crowd and to an adjacent hall that was empty. "So what did you need to talk about?" Ginny asked when they came to a stop.
Draco watched him curiously and was about to ask what his idea was when he realized that they'd made it to their usual spot and Harry was dropping his hand to set his stuff down.
"Great, we have the alcohol and the room covered, we just need the food, decorations, and music," Blaise said, serving himself from the platters of food that lined the table.
Draco was about to answer when he remembered something, "Wasn't today a hogsmeade weekend? I don't want you to miss out on it taking care of me."
Will they react terribly? Harry wondered, taking a bite of his own eggs. He vaguely wondered if they'd poisoned them, but decided that it might be worse to not eat them or spit them back out. Scratch that, they'll definitely react terribly, Harry thought, the question is how terribly. Like we're about to both die, terribly, or Draco's about to get disowned, terribly.
"Well they don't know that. They're young and impressionable right now and usually younger kids tend to turn to those who are popular and you are a prime candidate," Hermione said, turning back towards McGonagall who had finished sorting the new first years and was preparing to give the welcoming speech.
"Hey," Harry reached out and touched Draco's cheek, "don't be sorry. It's fine if you aren't ready. We don't have to do anything, I understand."
The game began with Madam Hooch's whistle and then all the players were in the air. The announcer was a small Ravenclaw boy, he had to have been no older than a fourth year, Harry thought. The kid wasn't biased and didn't constantly need Mcgonagall telling him he couldn't say certain things like Lee Jordan, Harry figured that might have been part of the reason he got the job.
Draco had chosen to sit at the Gryffindor table, a little too close to be just friendly, just to keep up the teasing with Harry.
"I have to agree with Malfoy," Hermione said, "It just doesn't seem like something Voldemort's followers would do. Something isn't right."
"Of course you're going for the alcohol, though I didn't even think about that being a way to complete our punishment," Draco said when he stopped laughing, and Harry forced himself to look away, face turning red.
"Since when?" Ron said with a tone of contempt, he knew that Harry and Draco had seemed to be getting along better but Harry had reassured him that they weren't anything more and he felt angry that Harry would befriend someone like Draco. Hermione, on the other hand, felt angry at Ron's complete obliviousness and the tone he used, especially when Harry was so obviously feeling pretty happy about it.
Harry smiled at Draco, smiling as he walked backwards toward the bed. "Come on, I have a bit before I need to head back," Harry said and Draco hurried over to him.
Harry spun next and it landed on Goyle, who was dared to kiss Parvati (who promptly wiped her lips multiple times and took a shot of firewhiskey.) A few more rounds went by until Ginny spun and it landed on Draco.
Harry spluttered in indignance and a few people looked over at him, he blushed red before lowering his head and hissing back, "I'm not stalking him."
“Thank you, you look amazing too,” Draco said and Harry envied how he never seemed to get flustered.
Breakfast continued with Harry thinking silently and Seamus and Dean shooting him nervous glances, he figured he should probably talk to them later.
A sort of sad expression took over Draco’s face for a moment before he seemed to shove it away, “No, I don’t think I’m even going to go,” Draco finally said with a sigh. Harry couldn’t read the look on his face.
"Nah, I think it's good you finally got the guts to do something," Pansy giggled, she was already pretty much drunk. She swore up and down that she was a heavy weight but was always the first one drunk when they drank together.
He really missed their hang-outs and their study sessions (which usually ended up being them sitting talking to each other with their homework out). Draco was lonely if he was being honest. He had made up with Pansy and decided to not rat her out, even if she totally deserved it. Even though he had Blaise and Pansy, he still felt unbelievably lonely and wondered how he ever dealt with not being Harry's friend before.
Draco started drinking the moment Dean and Seamus set the bottles down on the table. He had been feeling funny around Harry all week and just wanted to forget about it all for a while. By the time the games began he was feeling blissfully light headed and stumbled over to sit between Pansy and Lavender. Nobody really seemed to want to sit next to Lavender as she seemed to switch spots every Friday, Draco mirrored Hermione - who was on Lavender's left - and gave her a large berth.
But it felt so good, and it almost felt like a sort of rebellion, even- the 'chosen one', fooling around in a hall with none other than Draco Malfoy. Man, if the press caught wind of this, he thought, but that was the glory in it, no one would ever know. To top it off, the whole thing just felt so right, that he was barely thinking about the rebellious nature of his actions when he was kissing Draco.
"I won't tell a soul," Draco laughed and dropped his chocolate frog onto the counter to pay. The employee gave him a cautious look and rang up Draco's purchase, Draco tried to ignore the look.
"Yes, the rumors are true," Draco said noncommittally as he made his way towards the stairs, the rest of the sixth years following behind.
Thirdly, what is the wizarding world's opinion on homosexuality? This was probably the most puzzling. He could remember all the times Vernon would yell about people engaging in immoral acts and how "all those fags are going to burn hell!" Harry couldn't picture a society where homosexuality was a normal thing, he supposed he should probably look into it since he was part of that world now.
"Okay guys," Harry said, quickly turning around to address the group and avoid the possibility of an awkward discussion with Ron. "Just because their team is younger than us doesn't mean they aren't good or should be taken lightly. Our score in this match doesn't matter towards the house cup of course, but that shouldn't mean we go light on them as it's still a good practice match for both of our teams. Got it?"
"Mmm," Draco mumbled, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes as Harry continued to cuddle up to his back, "mornin'"
"You're not just going to let this go of course," Blaise said, "What are you going to do in return? If you want my advice, I say you include the mudblood and blood traitor in whatever it is you have planned for him. I think-"
Rumors were flying by the second day and they just seemed to be getting worse as the days passed. Though, none of the rumors really seemed to be getting that close to the truth, some didn't fail to make Harry's cheeks heat up and Pansy to snicker quietly to Draco. Draco assumed she might have started the spread of a few of them.
Hermione noticed the lack of bickering immediately, turning to see Draco grinning at the match and Harry staring resoutly forward, face painted a bright red. She shook her head in exasperation.
When the clock in the corner chimed midnight, everyone started to get up and pack the alcohol up and head to bed. Dean and Seamus rounded up the alcohol as they usually did and Seamus snuck a bottle to Ginny to take with her when Hermione wasn't looking.
"So you're still going to tell me you don't like him?" Pansy asked as soon as the last person left the common room to go to bed.
"Easy," Ginny replied, getting down onto her knees and putting her face up to the cup. Grabbing the rim of the cup with her mouth, she tilted her head back and downed it all in one gulp, before setting it back down on the carpet.
Harry had to stifle a laugh as Ron sat down. Ginny handed Ron the bottle with a smirk and Ron spun it a little harder than he needed to.
Draco didn’t know when they started moving, but soon he found himself trapped between Harry and the wall, and he had no complaints. The way Harry pressed against him was perfect and Harry’s hands in his hair were all he ever wanted.
Hermione studied him for a moment, "I- I'm not sure... would you care if he did? Like Malfoy I mean?"
"Think he'll give us the spell? I got some people I wouldn't mind giving a new look to," Ron snickered and Hermione shook her head at him.
"Yeah, I'm sure you are," Draco grumbled, picking at his robes. Harry quickly casted a warming charm on Draco as he tried to peel his robes off himself. "Thanks," Draco said with a sigh as he warmed up.
Just then, the door opened and Draco walked in, looking around them awkwardly. Then he looked at Harry and his eyes dropped to where Harry's hand had fallen away slightly from where he was prodding the bruise on his neck. He knew what it was immediately and flushed redder than he ever had before, all the way down to his neck. Coughing, he quickly turned from them and hurried off to the bathrooms.
