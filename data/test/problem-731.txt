The man’s nervousness was making him twitchy, and it wasn’t until Draco reached his neat pile of clothes on the bench that he realized what this was likely about.
Draco froze, his voice going breathy.  “Merlin, Harry,
“Lovely,” she said after he’d reluctantly closed the door.  “You’ve made a nice place for yourself here, it seems.”
“Then what are you talking about?”  His voice sounded wary, with just enough genuine concern to make it seem like he really didn’t know.  Like
“Let’s get some music in here!” one of the Slytherins whooped—Harry thought it might have been Nott.  Then, to his mortification, he heard a clattering behind the bar, and the usual background music switched to something faster, more upbeat.
Bored out of his mind, Harry would sometimes watch from the entryway corner.  It was only a few steps from his cupboard, so he could easily slip back inside if she got up or went for the door.  It had been in one of these “frivolous” American dramas that he’d heard the phrase originally.

Draco wondered whether it was embarrassment.  He just prayed it wasn’t regret.
voicing a threat, you believed that his former treatment of you, combined with him reaching for his wand, served as the equivalent, and thus acted on said belief, which led to what happened next?”  She sounded frightfully neutral about the whole situation, and he feared that it still wasn’t enough context to absolve him.
“Are you kidding me?  It’s

His memory of their first hookup was driving Draco insane.  For some idiotic reason, he had suggested

?”  He was halfway out of his seat, but Narcissa halted his progress with a firm hand on his shoulder.
Every detail of every interaction since their first kiss had become a record of momentous beginning, and Draco savored each with the same flash of disbelief as before.  He wondered whether it would ever grow old – then quickly hoped that it wouldn’t.
All of a sudden, Harry pulled back, voice coming fast and clumsy.  “I have to go… Ron and Hermione-”
Jenkins’ bland face was now mottled with doubt and embarrassment.  “That’s not…!  I…
.  You mean to say…that all this time, you-”
Draco rolled his eyes at the sarcasm – though, inside, he thoroughly appreciated it – then couldn’t help a wave of somberness overtaking him as he admitted, “I was a bit surprised.  I didn’t realize you had gotten permission to use the Floo.  Though, I suppose it makes sense that McGonagall wouldn’t offer me that privilege – I don’t have a great history with letting people into the castle.”

”  Unlike Draco’s pathetic attempt, he heard the bones clicking back into proper place.  The man repeated the spell, drawing it across Draco’s chest and down to his poorly battered hip.
He thought of the peacocks, proud and aggressive, and couldn’t help but think his father had chosen the perfect, unintentional doppelganger for a family pet.
In truth, the pet names made him melt – as embarrassing as they were.  Which is why he’d counted in the first place.

“-at the Manor that night I was captured.  Mister Malfoy...err, Lucius, and Bellatrix wanted to turn me in to Voldemort-”
“Oh.”  Slowly, as if defusing a bomb, he extricated himself from the man and stepped back, face absolutely burning.  He needed to leave.
In his peripherals, Draco caught Potter watching him as he tugged off his sweaty shirt.  Though he hid it well, the thought made him squirm with excitement.
But Potter didn’t move.  He seemed
He strolled into the Great Hall, distracted and late, but when his eyes landed upon Harry, the man was already beaming up at him.  Draco felt something crack and melt inside of him.
Waking late, he looked in the mirror to find a ghastly visage looking back at him.  He traced the dark bags of skin with weary fingers, wondering if others could see the world haunting him when they looked in his eyes.  Or perhaps he had it backwards, and it was
“At this hour?” she groaned.  “You can do schoolwork tomorrow!”

had weighed heavy on his mind, and some part of him had since been stuck on the idea that he could figure something out…a counter-potion of sorts.  Something to ease his mind, if not his past.
,” Draco stated flatly.  It was cruel of Harry to make Draco refuse like this, to be the one to see reason, when all he wanted to see now was Harry on his knees for him in broad daylight.
” Draco shouted.  “It was the only spell I could perform wandlessly to defend myself!”
“There’s no match tonight,” Draco responded, voice tight.  He looked as far as he could in his peripherals without turning; there were several men shifting behind him now.
Harry seemed to chew on that idea for a while.  “Well, it’s not something I would bloody well forget, is it?” he came back with after a pause.  At least his voice was regaining a shade of its characteristic sass.
Draco.  It wasn’t a threat – not in the real sense, anyway – but he could see her eyes sparkling with amusement when he folded.

Grant pulled him forward into a crushing kiss, and Draco surged up into it – refusing to become a victim of his own circumstances.  He could enjoy this; he could twist this so he was the one who came out on top, even if only in his own mind.  Maybe if he liked it, he would be able to forget…
[Harry carries over an enormous tray of rugelach, which the audience has not seen since they were potential disasters in the oven.  Now, they are laid out neatly, if a little eccentrically, in the shape of a Jewish star, with six rugelach forming each triangle.

“Yeah,” Longbottom responded easily.  “I mean, I don’t know for sure, but they’ve been a bit off-sorts the past few times I’ve seen them together, so I’m just speculating here.  Maybe Hannah’s heard more?”
Harry chugged the rest of his drink, slamming the stein down onto the table when he finished.  “Let’s do this,” he ground out.

Hello!  Hope everyone is doing well and staying safe.
Inside, he gestured to a seat, raising his brow at how firmly Slughorn shut the door behind him.  “Please.”
Perhaps Potter had been offended that he’d referenced the war tangentially.  That if anyone had the right to bring it up, it certainly wasn’t Draco.  He’d understand if that was the case, but something told him that wasn’t it either.
McGonagall began announcing the faculty, and he rose in a startled motion when his name was called.  Fuck, everyone was looking at him now.  They all thought he shouldn’t be here, that it was laughable for him to step into a position so clearly unsuited to him.
“Yeah, you could say that.”  The voice was gruff and low and, so far, unidentifiable.  “Let’s have a match, Malfoy.”

“I think I’m liking ‘Professor’ at the moment.”
Her narrowed gaze flickered between Harry and Draco.  Finally, they landed on him to stay.  “And if I were to ask those questions about your relationship?  What might you answer?”
“Won’t everyone see?” he asked at last.
His throat was warm and muscled in Draco’s grip.  The pulse under his fingers flurried, and he felt a certain drunkenness in having his rival here beneath his hand.  In touching an “untouchable” thing.

Draco drew himself up, trying to regain some wounded pride with a dignified sniff.  “It was an ambush, really.  Psychological warfare.  She came at me in the common room yesterday, talking about how she had once dreamed of going to the Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts – how she was practically an actress anyway, despite not having any formal training, and that she would be the star of any production Hogwarts could conceivably produce (though we both know it won’t, given the ban on all theatre performances for the past decade).  Anyway, combined with how she keeps wresting control from me regarding the decorating contest, I was a little irked to say the least.  So I

.  Security must be tightening.”
He was still stewing about the premature demise of his youth when Fenn came up and tapped him on the shoulder.  “Looking good, Malfoy,” she said with a laugh, crossing her arms over a perplexing outfit of shredded black clothes and little metal bits everywhere.
“I knew you’d flip when you read it,” he admitted, since Harry had yet to say anything.  That worried him, and so he filled the silence with explanation, hoping to lure some reaction from the man in turn.  “
Mother wanted the past, but Draco had changed.  He had changed, and for the first time in his life, he found no comfort in the familiar – the etiquette, the influence, the traditions.  The war had destroyed the illusion of it all, and perhaps it had never existed concretely to begin with.  He needed something new.
McGonagall smiled then, looking a little emotional herself.  “You’re all my students.  Always.”
“Oh, spare me the bullshit, Morpheus!”  Draco’s voice was sharp with venom.  “You got a servant out of the deal.  Someone to brew all your merchandise and bite their tongue at your astounding lack of knowledge.  Everyone knows you’re a piss-poor Potions master, and they like my potions better – admit it!  I heard Madam Wilkinson saying they’d improved significantly just the other day!”
Harry was mid-spasm when it happened.  He was against the wall, water streaming into his eyes and splattering the glasses he hadn’t even bothered to take off, body held firmly in place by two hands and a wicked, wicked tongue.
Draco rolled up his sleeve and looked at his Mark in disgust.  There was no point in hiding it – everyone knew it was there.  When he covered it, the only one he was hiding it from was himself.
She strolled through the gardens.  He strolled between shelves in the library.

Mother strode, stiff-backed, to the front desk and checked them in.  The wizard there eyed them warily, but confirmed their appointment for three.  Draco took a step forward, thinking they were done.
It was Harry.

While Potter whipped his head side to side, examining each of the pitch-black rooms as they passed, Draco spent his time examining
that kind of research.”
Draco stilled, imagining it himself.  But it wasn’t a humorous picture.
“I’m perfectly fine on my own!” he lied.  “Unlike ‘Savior of the Universe’ over here, who needs to be the center of attention at every waking moment!”  He felt the conversation spinning away from him, but he couldn’t quite get a grasp on himself enough to stop.
VOLDEMORT: Hmph.  Well, we’ll see when they come out.
After a long pause, he simply said, “I don’t get why you haven’t, then.”  There was no judgment in his tone, just a general sense of puzzlement.
It was hard and rushed and messy, but the man poured his whole self into it – all the cockiness and tentativeness and good-graced humor that he’d developed somewhere along the way.  Harry felt
FRED: Your recipe today comes from Lord Voldemort – any words of wisdom for them, old man?
, and Harry sprayed pumpkin juice across the table with a choking, spluttering sound.
Draco glanced over at Potter, catching his grimace as Slughorn clapped him jovially on the shoulder.  In his opinion, if Potter felt uncomfortable, then he deserved every bloody second of it.  When he’d sat with Longbottom and his wife this morning, that had been understandable – they were friends after all – but sitting between Slughorn and
was the enterer this time – and therefore it felt like the two of them could finally have a conversation rather than perform an improvisational play in front of an audience.

like a wild animal.  Draco had spent so many years taunting him, coming up with new ways to prove himself an equal through rivalry.  He didn’t want Potter to see just how pathetic he had become.
.  There had to be some mistake.
But a few minutes later, he looked down and noticed Harry was gone.  Had something happened?  He remained gone for the rest of the game, and Draco played distractedly, noticing fouls long seconds after they’d happened and entirely missing the chase leading up to Hufflepuff catching the snitch.

“Just form a loose circle and fly around the pitch,” he called to the class, landing to help Jimmy – the last student having issues getting up in the air.  He sighed.  “And what seems to be the issue this time, Mister Hathburn?”  Using his surname, of course, was a bit of exasperated humor at this point.  He found it stuffy to do so all the time – like he was purporting himself as a mini McGonagall.

It didn’t last though – he glanced back up as soon as Draco began stepping into his trousers.

Naturally, Draco was disappointed with this suggestion as well, but it was almost worth it to see the look of abject loss on Harry’s face.  Like he’d built up a terribly exciting night with Draco in his head, and it was all crashing down around him – ultimately, a very flattering sentiment.  He only hoped he could live up to it tomorrow, or whenever the time came.
about Potter, actually.”
He’d felt that pressure before, and it had always preceded a kiss.
Draco willed the cashier to answer, to simply take the money in his outstretched hand and be done with it, though he dreaded it was already too late to escape.
The day passed by in a blur of relief mixed with anxiousness, and his only comfort in the whirlwind was the fierce, satisfied expression on McGonagall’s face that night when he saw her sitting at dinner.  About halfway through the meal, she caught him looking – and to his surprise, she offered him a tense, half-smile that seemed to convey multitudes, though she said nothing at all.
“Never mind!” the boy blurted.  “Enjoy your afternoon!”  He glanced over at Draco again and gave a slight nod, as if just seeing him for the first time.  “Mister Malfoy.”  And then he was gone.

He checked his cufflinks one more time before swiveling to face him.  “Care to dance, Potter?”
“Oh, are you?”  She signaled a waitress for more sugar for the table.  “Then, I’m afraid I’ll have to elaborate: how are you and Professor Potter getting along?”
can’t do.  Maybe he’ll even show us some, later…”
Reminded of how pathetically desperate his writing sounded by having it read aloud to him, Draco did the only thing one could do in such a situation: deflect with overly arrogant humor.  “Why, do you want it to be?”
Potter seemed to have no such sense; it was that Gryffindor thing again.  He barreled right into the copse at full speed, sending a murder of angry crows tearing through the night sky.  Draco dodged them with a roll and dropped down next to where the branches still shifted and shuddered below.

Harry’s head snapped up, and he looked Draco over quickly before answering.  “Ron and Hermione are getting married,” he blurted.  “How was your visit?”
Harry’s face closed off in an instant when he noticed the harmful words.  The song ended in time with his realization, and Draco’s easy grin slid, liquid, from his face.
Harry gulped adorably, a faint rosiness coloring his cheeks.
“Wellllll…” He stretched out the syllable to be cute, but from Hermione’s expression, he was falling somewhere short of “pathetic.”  “Ron and I have a plan.”
Potter shrieked loudly into the quiet night, stumbling backwards and falling over in his fright.  “
“Mhmm,” Draco hummed distractedly as he laced up his boots.  “I’m sure they were
His humor had mostly faded by the time he reached the Manor, but there were traces of it left in his system – enough so that, having kept a perfectly neutral expression for the past few minutes, he suddenly broke into a smile remembering Harry’s adorable incredulousness when he’d said he had to leave.  The next few moments, of course, were inevitably spent rearranging his face so that his parents could read nothing of the events that had transpired – and, in that way, they could belong to no one but him.
“Please?”  Harry’s eyes grew impossibly wide with entreaty, and Draco would’ve missed the twinkle of mischief if he hadn’t been trained to look.
Draco clamped down on his cheek to stifle a growl of endless frustration.  “I haven’t

It took a long time, but when the tears slowed and dried, he picked up the statue and his wand and left the room.
Draco fumed and cast his thoughts in futile circles as he geared up to help some kids with Quidditch practice.  It was a pair of second-year girls from Slytherin who likely wouldn’t make the team due to their age, but they had come up to him after breakfast this morning and asked, so he had agreed to help them out.  He recognized them vaguely from Potter’s class yesterday.
VOLDEMORT: Delicious flavors.  I don’t usually like basil, but it complements the parmesan beautifully, and the black pepper brings an edge of spiciness that keeps it from being too bland.  Moving onto the sweet.
so!” he assured.  “Well, now that that’s settled-”  He patted his knees with finality before moving to heave himself up.
Draco leads him by the hand into their bedroom, stopping Harry so he’s facing the mirror. Standing behind the pregnant man, Draco leans over to place a soft kiss behind his ear, hands moving to his collar.
“It is. Especially when you know you have parents who won’t be accepting. I’ve got some experience there.” Draco sighs and Harry squeezes his hand in an effort to be some kind of comfort. Part of the continuing rift between Draco and his mother after his father went to Azkaban was her refusal to accept Draco’s sexuality. His father, of course, was completely unaccepting as well, but there was only so much he could do from his cell. Draco had literally no one after Astoria left.
Today, Friday, marks four full weeks that he’s been working at the CRMM. The first two weeks of training had been intense but extremely engaging, and Harry looks forward to going to work every day. At the beginning of October, he’d been given his own station in one of the Dark Magic Research labs. His lab partners are two other Dark Magic experts and three Curse-Breakers. The Dark Magic experts take the
“Yeah. It was after midnight by then. But when he left, I saw him out and there was this odd moment. We just looked at each other and we were standing quite close in the entry.” Harry loses himself in the memory for just a second. “I really thought he might kiss me, but then he just put a hand on my shoulder and thanked me for a wonderful evening and…left.” Harry’s shoulders fall, remembering that weird empty feeling he’d had when the door had clicked shut behind Draco.
“He’s right there, Harry. I can feel his head.” Healer Powell withdraws his hand and eases Harry’s legs back to the bed. “When your body tells you to push, I want you to push. As soon as that happens, press the call button so we can come set up for delivery. He’s almost here, gentlemen.”
“Oh, that’s even better than I imagined it.” Harry can’t wipe the smile from his face.
— left the coffee shop. The conversation had swung from lighthearted banter to sincere apologies for everything from the war, and Hogwarts, and Myrtle’s bathroom.
“Try now and see if that was enough.” Draco returns the denims and Harry slides them on. They button successfully and he sighs in relief before making the mistake of looking in the mirror again. “I still look pregnant.”
“She seems to be enjoying it. She was a bit homesick at first, but I think most kids are.” Blaise shrugs.
“That would be fantastic!” James nods.
“Draco’s here,” Matthew says quietly. “I can hear him talking to my parents.”
“You look dreadful, Harry. You’re quite pale.”
Draco turns from sliding the last dresser drawer shut. “I agree. Can you believe we only have three months before we get to meet our son?”
Harry is in complete awe that this tiny person is growing inside him. He steals another glance at Draco, who positively beams at him.
“I can’t say I blame you. I don’t think I’d particularly like the process of being pregnant, either.”
Draco’s nimble fingers pop the button on Harry’s jeans. Harry lifts his hips without being asked. He gasps softly as Draco hooks his fingers under the elastic of his pants and slides them down along with his jeans. Harry’s cock springs free, bouncing softly against his stomach.
Harry turns his head quickly, quite sure he looks like he just got caught with his hand in the cookie jar. “I’m sorry. I got lost in my head thinking about how good it feels to be here, next to you.”
is going to work out, kids and all.
“I can’t wait. Ready to put our new room together?”
“Yes. Any penetration, including anal sex, is safe. Your body has a membrane between your womb and your rectum that keeps the baby protected and that membrane won’t dilate and open until you’re in labour.”
“Yes?” Harry replies hesitantly.
Harry struggles to keep himself calm and finally loses the battle against the anger boiling under the surface.
Draco nods, but before he can answer, the Floo roars to life and Hermione steps out. Harry gives Draco a look that says they’ll talk about it later and wraps Hermione in his arms.
Harry toes off his shoes in the entry and moves into the house, lighting a fire with a wordless, wandless
“Well, what page are you on?” Harry asks.
Harry smiles as he rolls over, spreading his legs around Draco again and planting his feet on the blanket. He gazes at Draco, who leans up between his legs and kisses him softly. Draco gently pushes one of Harry’s knees to his chest. Harry feels incredibly on display, more so than the times Draco has fingered and rimmed him already, as Draco’s gaze rakes down Harry’s body and then focuses on his hole.
Draco takes a moment and then continues, voice slightly halting.
“You’ll figure it out, there’s no rush. You and I both know there’s more in your vaults that you and your kids could ever spend in your lifetimes.” Draco pauses thoughtfully. “What, exactly, are you looking for when trying to select something?”
He slides back into bed and picks up his book,
“I am. Four weeks.”
“You’re awake, too?”
“Is your wand ever reluctant or temperamental? Perhaps when you’re tired?”
Harry leans forward, awkward over his belly, and draws Draco into a kiss. The soft moan from his fiancé shoots straight to his cock and the kiss takes a sudden turn from ‘aren't we so lucky?’ to ‘would you like to get lucky?’ Easing their lips apart, just enough to speak, Harry says, “Shall we take this to
Draco’s voice is husky as he asks, and Harry nods his consent. Draco is almost reverent as he undoes Harry’s fly and slides the fabric over his hips, down his thighs, and to the ground. Harry warms not only from arousal but from having someone so…dedicated to taking care of him and making sure he is ok. That’s always been Harry’s job — taking care of everyone else. It’s wonderful to be on the receiving end.
“Lunch would be great.” Feeling Draco’s hand on the small of his back, Harry shoots a Malfoy-worthy smirk at the clerk and allows himself to be gently guided to the exit. He relaxes with the soft pressure from Draco and by the time they are outside, Harry’s much calmer.
Draco laughs softly. “We’ll keep that in mind, Lil.”
“We know I can carry.”
“it’s ok, Draco. I’m nervous, too.” Harry takes a breath and decides just to say what he feels. “I am falling for you so hard and so fast it almost makes my head spin. But it also feels better than any relationship I’ve ever been in.”
“All right. Let’s give it a few minutes, then.” Draco’s hand rubs his lower back softly. “I didn't know you weren’t feeling well.”
“That’s a personal decision. If you’re feeling well and not experiencing magic fatigue, there’s no reason you can’t. But male pregnancies carry a high miscarriage rate when you don’t listen to your body and rest enough. I would advise you to err on the side of caution and not work if you’re not feeling up to it. If you are feeling well, there’s no reason not to.”
Clad in his towel, Harry finds himself sighing in front of his wardrobe.
“None taken,” Draco laughs, “but I am sure between the two of us we can help you feel better about your skills.”
Minerva raises her wand and begins a complex pattern between their hands.
“Surely there’s an acceptable name for our son somewhere in here.” Draco shakes his head and smiles. “I know you’ve written some things down, too.”
The next morning’s Prophet boasts a picture of the pair of them, through the front window of Little Witches and Wizards. Harry is looking at baby clothes, bump clearly visible, while Draco rubs his back. He smiles at the picture. Media and their hijinks aside, it’s actually a lovely shot of them shopping for the son they both love so much.
in twelve years, and he’s suddenly realising just how much he’s missed this kind of companionship.
“All right. Clothes. Do you know where you’re going?”
“Scorp’s gone to get some potion. It shouldn’t take him more than a few minutes.”
The visit to Wand and Wood had been very fruitful, and there was a team coming to set up most of the furniture they’d picked for the new addition later in the week. They had decided to carry home the carefully shrunken and lightened furnishings for the nursery, though.
He ties the letter to Edgar, the great horned owl he’d adopted from the Wizarding Owl rescue several years ago. “You can wait for an answer if he has one,” Harry tells the bird, before standing, stretching, and heading for the shower.
“I’ve chosen a film, but I seem to be lacking company and wine.” Draco’s grey eyes shift from teasing to concerned as he takes in Harry’s expression. “Are you all right, Harry?”
“Dad?” Scorpius’ voice drifts from the bedroom.
“We are,” Harry confirms, coming alongside Draco from the kitchen. “We’re having tea with the Headmistress in her office. We won’t embarrass you.” He winks at the kids. “Off we go. James first.”
The door opens and James leads Matthew in by the hand, both of them settling on the bed.
, then?”
“That’s good to know.”
scared, and it’s not my body.”
“You should be good now, even if you throw up.”
“I’d like to be able to tell Blaise.” Harry nods as Draco continues. “We keep in regular touch, even though he’s been in Italy. His daughter just started Hogwarts, so he’s looking at moving back to England.”
Draco helps Harry into his shoes and together, they move through the French doors and out into the garden. Harry squeezes Draco’s hand as they head down the hill.
Draco keens in response and tightens his grip on Harry’s hips. It would nearly be painful if it didn’t feel so good. Draco presses into him harder and faster.
“Can we talk about post-Hogwarts?”
The soft fabric slides over Harry’s hips, then stops.
Draco gently pulls his leg back again, and Harry gasps as the Healer’s fingers slide in.
“You are most welcome. Have a seat, gentlemen.” She gestures to the small sitting area. The men settle side by side on the couch.
“Of course it is. Why don’t you go up to James’ room and take all the time you need?”
“Are you going to die like mum?”
“That sounds perfect,” Draco nods in agreement.
“You probably won’t, Mr Potter.” Harry shifts his attention to the Healer. He can’t be a day under seventy. “I’m Healer Powell. I’m a male obstetrics specialist with the Male Pregnancy Clinic.”
“I found Dad and Draco. I’m going to put you on speaker, okay?”
“Who was your pediatric Healer?”
, the second time around.
Harry sighs and together, he and Draco move to the couch.
“Well, I heard we’ve become a triad,” Harry teases.
“Reach down, Harry!” Healer Powell’s voice breaks through the haze. “Reach down and deliver your son!
“You cannot earn your way into this family, Matthew. You’ve been chosen. You also cannot do anything to be removed from it, save your own personal choice to leave. And even if you did that, you would still be loved and welcome if you chose to return.”
Propped in bed with Draco in a chair next to him, he listens to Healer Powell running over his most recent test results.
“Love you, too.”
“Something like that, I think.” Draco points to a ring, and Erwin immediately pulls it from the display.
“Harry?” Draco’s voice fills the shower.
The chime of the Floo drifts up the stairs and Harry tucks a last stack of clothes into a drawer before kissing Draco quickly.
“He doesn’t want to know,” Harry mutters while tugging on his joggers and shirt. “It was his bloody fault anyway.”
are interested?”
Harry summons another book and is once again thankful for Hermione. “Here. This book goes over an awful lot, but I’d like for you to do some reading.” James looks down at
The sound of the door being pushed open yanks Harry out of his cogitation and he swiftly stands upright, putting one hand on the wine bottle he’s supposed to be retrieving as Draco pokes his head in.
Harry smiles into Draco’s shoulder, then eases back. “That’s why I asked you to stay. I’m just not ready to let you go tonight.” He gives Draco a peck. “Let’s at least get comfortable. Do you want something to sleep in?”
“I want to be married before Regulus is born.”
“Still ok?”
“I have questions.”
“I’ve usually topped. I bottomed once. It was ok.”
Harry catches Draco’s smirk. Lily clearly takes after her father in her love of carbs.
Draco helps Harry into the bed and takes his hand as Healer Powell begins checking him over. Continuous monitoring charms are put into place, and Harry hears the swoosh of Regulus’ heartbeat fill the room.
He makes his way down the stairs and kisses Draco softly.
“It should be fine since we’ll be out. It’s cold.” Harry turns in Draco’s arms for a kiss before heading for his wardrobe.
“I don’t think Blaise or Hermione would be a problem.” Harry’s not worried about either of their close friends outing them before they are ready. He’s much more worried about their co-workers, or a wizard spotting them in Muggle London. “Do you think anyone at work will figure it out?”
“Enjoy the ride, gentlemen,” the hostess says before stepping out and closing the door.
“Yeah. That is important to me.”
After Draco had treated him to lunch, he’d helped ward the man’s phone before they parted ways outside the restaurant. Harry had been a bit shocked when Draco had affectionately squeezed his hand while thanking him for all his help. Harry smiles now, remembering the feeling of warmth that filled him at Draco’s simple touch.
A few moments later Draco’s eyes widen as he realises what he’s said, but Harry moves swiftly to cup Draco’s ivory cheek.
“Yes, Mr Potter?”
Harry is standing, eyes closed, letting the steaming hot water course down his back when he hears the door to the bathroom open.
“Scorp and I were both glad you and Draco started dating, we told you that!” Al pauses and Harry’s not sure how to interpret the look on his son’s face. “And the baby took a while to sink in, but we’re both happy for a little brother. Scorp has always wanted a sibling, and now he’ll have four!”
“I’d appreciate that,” Draco says, reaching into the bowl and turning his attention to the telly. Harry lazily waves a hand and dims the lights as Simon begins narrating the opening scene.
He pulls back from the kiss and reaches to hold both of Draco’s hands. “I’ve always told my kids to have an open dialogue with their partners when the time comes.”
“My children are meddling.”
“I know. It’s just kind of nice to see my dad in the same kind of relationship as me.” James pauses and his eyes dart to his bedside table. Harry’s eyes follow and he spots James’ mobile there. “Can I call Matthew and tell him?”
“I think we’ve reached the point of no return.” He moves back into the bedroom, and Draco follows, standing behind him as he turns to the mirror again. “Even my loosest robes aren’t going to hide my bump anymore.”
Hermione’s face shifts to a soft smile. “How did this start?”
“To be fair, love,” Draco says gently, “you're more powerful than the average wizard, and you haven’t done anything magically taxing.”
Draco huffs a laugh and Harry can hear the pleasure in his voice.
James, Albus, and Lily step forward from behind Harry, handing Draco’s wedding ring to Minerva, followed by Scorpius from behind Draco, who passes over Harry’s.
“Ok.” Draco helps Harry to sit up and tip the potion into his mouth. He swallows and immediately gags.
the garbage I went through. It just seems unfair that you dealt with so much, and nothing you did merited being put through it.”
“I really think everything will be fine, but I need that peace of mind.”
“I did, actually. Draco made sure of that.”
“Fuck, Harry…yes, hole…good, so good…more.”
“I have plans for dinner, as well,” he lies. He
“Potter.” Blaise greets him with a smile.
“Yes. Something simple.” Harry has no energy for anything ornate, and that part has never been important to him. He and Draco are just not fancy. For one being (unwillingly) famous and the other being brought up with only the best, they really are a very down-to-earth couple. “Just us and the kids, Hermione, Blaise if you’d like. I’m sure Minerva will perform the bonding ritual if we ask her.”
“Then why are we here?” Scorpius also looks concerned and more than a little confused.
“Not that I’ve noticed.”
“Healer Carr will be here in a few moments. She’s just gathering what she needs to check you over.”
“Ok, kids. We’re meeting Matthew in front of The Spotted Owl, then brunch before shopping. Ignore the stares, please. Don’t make rude gestures at the press once they find us. Stay out in front of Draco and me so we can keep an eye out.”
“When we promised you we would take care of you, we meant just like all our other children,” Harry clarifies. “That includes university studies if that’s what you choose to do.”
“Nnnngh. Yes. Like that. Don’t stop.”
“I do.”
“Yes. Traditionally, a son would do as his mother requested out of respect for family honour.” Draco sets the letter aside and slides his arms around Harry. “She’s got a bit of a problem, there, though. I don’t give a shite about pure-blood honour, and I intend to be with you for the rest of my days.”
“Well, that makes a lot more sense.” Draco smiles. “So I can hold your hand in the middle of wizarding London and no one would be the wiser?”
Living with Draco, Harry decides, is the best kind of wonderful and the best kind of boring, all wrapped in one. He slides the pan of asparagus into the oven next to the chicken and potatoes he’s been baking and turns to put together a salad. It’s been over two weeks since Draco officially moved in, and they’ve fallen into a comfortable routine around work and home.
“James.” Draco’s voice is gentle and encouraging, even if Harry can hear the nervousness in his tone. “Just say it. Everyone in this room has a preference for men, even if one of them is your dad. We’re not going to judge you. We want to help.”
“It’s completely ok. I…” Harry pauses, clearing his throat from the sudden roughness before he can continue. “I actually have a pretty strong preference for bottoming. I’ve topped with a man. It’s ok. But I much prefer a cock inside me.”
“You can move. Godric, you feel so good.”
“It’s not something I’ve considered before, honestly.” Harry finds both Draco’s hands and takes them in his own. “Draco, I could have been completely happy with our life and our blended kids. But this is a baby that’s half you and half me. And the more I sit here and think about that, the more I think that’s wonderful.”
“Well, I think you should do it soon. So does James.”
“Like you loved mum?”
“Absolutely,” Draco says. “Come talk to us when you’re ready, ok?”
“Hmm?”
“Of course!” She stands and gestures to the Floo. “Please let me know if there’s anything I can do for the children. Or the two of you, for that matter. I am glad to see the two of you happy and doing well.”
“I’m the lucky one.” Draco perches on the ottoman next to his feet. “There’s no way I could ever deserve what we have, but I'm so thankful I have it anyway. I can’t wait to meet our son, to marry you, to raise our family together.”
Harry can’t help but laugh at the gleeful look in Draco’s eyes. The magical tailor Draco hired has created a wide array of clothes to accommodate Harry’s bump that are charmed to magically expand as he grows and then magically shrink as Harry’s body returns to normal after the birth. He knows he looks good in the clothes — as good as one can look pregnant — but he’s never cared as much about fashion as Draco. He does, however, appreciate the way Draco looks at him when he’s wearing well-tailored clothes.
“Draco?”
“Draco?”
Harry and Draco Side-Along the children to the Apparition point in wizarding London, and Harry steels himself for the stares as he laces his fingers with Draco’s and squeezes gently.
Hermione’s lilting laugh makes him smile. “Stand up then, and let me have a look at you.”
Upstairs, Harry knocks lightly on Al’s bedroom door. “Al? Can we come in?”
“Good to see you again, Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy,” Healer Powell greets them with a jovial tone.
“Would you like a couple of moving images?” Healer Powell asks softly, seeming hesitant to interrupt the moment.
“I was a bit off earlier.” Harry feels Draco shaking with silent laughter next to him.
“Are you all okay with that?” Scorpius asks.
Draco’s grip on his hand tightens, and Harry is astounded how much their baby has changed in the three weeks since his last appointment. While Harry was glad to be past the more frequent monitoring stage, he’s missed seeing their sweet baby every week.
“You have no idea,” Harry quips.
“There’s a couple of options,” Draco explains. “There’s no wizard’s contraception potion like there is for witches, but there is a male contraception spell. There’s also Muggle condoms. Neither is one-hundred percent effective, though.”
“Meddling? How so?”
“I need to push. I need to push.”
“That’s your son. He’s
Harry angles his head to look at Draco and tries not to look overly maudlin. “I’m glad I can be that person.”
“You have no idea,” Harry laughs.
The whoosh of the baby's heartbeat fills the room, and Harry returns to staring at their baby.
“We can order in. Does anything sound good?”
Draco’s hand reaches for his abdomen, lovingly running his hands across the slight protrusion that had really not been noticeable before today.
“More than.” The warmth coursing into Harry’s body from where their palms touch brings him a feeling of contentment. This just
“Draco!”
“Potter?”
No sooner does the Healer exit the room than Harry is wracked with another brutal contraction.
“Tonight, it’s my turn. I want to take care of you.”
“I’m looking forward to that.” Draco squeezes Harry’s hand and grins down at him.
Harry reaches for his bedside table and pulls on the bottom drawer, warded to open only at his touch. He withdraws a phial of lube and coats the fingers of one hand and the palm of the other.
“That’s a lot to unpack all at once.”
“Merlin, I was such a little arsehole.” Malfoy shakes his downturned head with a derisive smile before lifting his chin to look Harry square in the eye. “But I really wanted to raise Scorpius to be the complete opposite of that. It’s part of why I went to such lengths to have an heir. I could change the meaning behind the name Malfoy. I could…I could be on the right side of something for once. I could teach my son to be everything I was not. I could teach him to be a good man.”
“Let’s start here,” Draco says thoughtfully. “Are you comfortable telling us what you and Matthew
but routine. The sex is frequent and passionate, and Harry is enjoying the fact that they’re completely comfortable trying new things and finding out what works for them. But beyond that, Harry finds himself falling further in love with Draco every day. It’s not that they don’t disagree — they do, and it can be heated — but they care more about each other than about being right. Harry loves figuring out how to best take care of Draco’s physical and emotional needs and in turn, Draco takes fantastic care of him.
Harry chuckles. “I’d love that more than anything.”
He hears Draco return, followed by the rustle of clothing and then bedsheets. Draco’s side of the bed dips, and Draco’s hand joins Harry’s.
“Now, see in the imaging how his head is down, but a little to the left side?” James nods. “So find the centre of the bottom of the abdomen, then shift a little to the left.”
Draco’s hand grips his hip and pulls him closer.
Harry notices Draco’s effort to move the subject gently away from Harry’s childhood and smiles appreciatively.
“And now?” They move to have a seat in the living room, Hermione taking up her favourite spot in the overstuffed easy chair while Harry tucks himself under Draco’s arm on the couch.
Harry enters to find his son unpacking clothes. He looks more relaxed, and Harry hopes the impression he’s receiving is accurate. He perches on the edge of the bed and watches Al continue to move around his room.
“Er, sorry about that.” Harry feels his face warm and hopes Draco blames it on the Floo connection instead of Harry’s embarrassment.
Matthew’s eyes go a bit wide, and Harry sees James squeeze his hand gently.
“Is he moving, Dad?” Lily is practically vibrating with excitement.
“I’d prefer to make Matthew a Potter myself in a few years, Lil.” He tips his head back to kiss Matthew’s jaw quickly.
“That’s a good sign. It means your womb is growing. Can you show me where?”
“Of course, Mr Malfoy.” Erwin hurries off, rings in hand, to do as Draco asked. Harry’s mind is swirling with thoughts of engagement and a wedding and a future with Draco. All of it sounds perfect to him.
“You’re aware that a small percentage of male wizards can carry children, yes?”
Harry nods in agreement with Draco. “And then you would stay here, Matthew, if that was your choice, or you could choose different arrangements. We will support you no matter what choice you make.”
“Let’s get you back in bed, then. You should have a good 4-5 hours of relief from that potion.”
“Hello?” Harry says uncertainly.
.” The tremble in Draco’s voice betrays his confident words.
“Harry? James?”
“I loved Ginny. Probably part of me always will. When she died, I didn’t think I’d ever want to be with someone else. It was me and the kids against the world, and I was ok with that. I didn’t date at all; I wasn’t looking to date.” Harry huffs another laugh. “That remained true up until about halfway through tea that day.”
Standing in front of the mirror, Harry smoothes his robes and turns again. He sighs and pokes his head out of the bedroom door.
“I know we’ve talked about consent, but I want to make sure you understand you do not have to consent to anything you’re not comfortable with. And you’re never to pressure Matthew to consent if he’s not comfortable.”
been with a man?” Draco asks softly.
Matthew is back to just openly letting his tears fall. “Thank you. I don’t know what else to say.”
Thirty minutes later, Draco is the proud owner of two new iPhones and Harry is glowering at the twenty-something clerk who has been flirting with Draco the entire time he’s been helping them.
He lays there, eyes still closed, catching his breath for a moment. Draco’s smile is still in the forefront of his mind.
“Good. Yeah, that’ll be good.” Harry stutters, still desperately trying to process what just happened.
“Harry!” Draco’s voice is in his ear. “You have to push, love. Regulus needs his daddy to bring him fully into the world.”
“But if either of you has questions about sex, or anything else, really, you can always come to us together or alone, ok?” Harry looks to both boys, who nod. “Good. Is there anything else you need tonight?”
, he reminds himself.
“I look pretty good,” Harry says to his reflection. He’s dressed in the impeccably tailored outfit Draco helped him pick out when they went shopping earlier in the week; charcoal trousers and waistcoat over a dark wine-coloured dress shirt.
“Yes. That’s perfect.”
“Harry’s really pregnant?” Scorpius’ face is schooled into a carefully neutral expression. Harry’s come to learn this means he hasn’t decided how he feels, yet.
“Of course. We talked about it more than once beforehand. And it wasn’t until a couple of weeks ago. Right before I wrote to you.”
“I know everything went flawlessly today with the simulations, but still.”
Harry pats the bed. “Come on and sit, Scorp. What’s on your mind?”
“Hmmm?” Draco stirs next to him.
“Apply a little more pressure for me.”
He feels much better back in his own body and quickly passes a phial to Draco. Harry grins when
“I’m so glad I can be the source of your entertainment this morning,” Harry says, sarcasm lacing his voice.
“Let's take a closer look this time.” Healer Carr mutters an incantation and the image in the bubble is suddenly more defined. She begins moving her wand with small, precise movements against Harry’s abdomen until there’s a distinct tiny face.
Draco makes a show of peering behind Harry and leering at his arse. Harry’s face lights on fire and he smiles bashfully under the attention. The doors open and Draco quickly straightens. Harry fails to hide his laugh as they head out the doors and towards the front entrance of the CRMM.
James finally speaks for both of them. “We’ll need more at some point, though.”
“What does she mean about removing you from the estate?”
Harry hears Draco take in and release a deep breath.
“It’s worth a try.”
“No, I hate it. But nothing I do makes it change. I can’t just make myself worry less.”
“It seems Lily has written,” Harry smiles as Draco, being the non-pregnant one, swiftly moves to let the owl in.
“Never? Well, that’s a thing we need to try, then.” Harry traces invisible patterns on Draco’s chest with his fingers. “I enjoy both giving and receiving them. No teeth though.”
Draco stands, wide-eyed, and looks around. The large room is bright and covered in posters of Quidditch players, team posters, and other memorabilia. Along the wall opposite them, past a long row of benches, is a bank of large lockers decorated with insignia and colours of various Quidditch teams. Draco steps over to one end and runs his hand along them. “These all have names?”
“Draco?” Harry whispers.
Draco turns from grinning at his locker to grin at Harry. “Yeah, for quite some time. I supported the Tornadoes in school, though. Thank you. This is fabulous.”
But he had.
“At school is fine as long as nobody else knows.”
“Everything is progressing well.” The Healer withdraws her fingers and doffs her gloves. “We will continue to check every other week until twelve weeks. The canal is usually fully developed at that time. After that it will just be quick checks of your membrane.”
They land smoothly in the bedroom, but Harry finds himself still held close to Draco’s chest, feeling Draco’s breath in his hair. He wraps his arm around the blond and for long moments, they stand in silence, just clinging to each other.
One of Draco’s palms leaves Harry’s hip, and Harry hears a distinct pop as the phial of lube is opened. His breath quickens in anticipation, waiting for the touch of Draco’s fingers, and gasping when he instead feels oil — warm oil — drip gently into his crevice. A rush of affection courses through his body for Draco and his little considerate gestures. Warming the oil is such a small thing, but Harry enjoys knowing someone cares enough to pay attention to the little details.
“Would you gentlemen like to know the sex? We should be able to tell today.” Healer Carr’s voice breaks through their moment.
“He’s making plans with me, Claire,” a deep voice says from the doorway to the lab. Harry’s gaze shoots to the doorway where Draco is leaning against the doorframe, looking absolutely fabulous in black trousers and a ribbed turtleneck jumper in slate blue. His eyes are narrowed at Claire and he looks a bit upset.
“You’re his only sister, you twit,” Albus retorts.
Harry runs his hands through his hair and huffs out a breath.
“It’s not perfect, but it’s better, and it
Hermione’s voice plays in his head.
Putting himself between Harry and the mirror, Draco frees Harry’s straining erection from his pants. Kissing the tip, he slides the soft fabric free and returns to take Harry’s cock into this mouth.
“He is.”
“Not in the least.” Harry turns and takes Draco’s hand. “Come on. Let’s go see if we can’t get Al to calm down.”
“Of course. She’s your best friend. Having her over for dinner is probably overdue.” Harry sees no hesitation or unease in Draco’s face. Draco squeezes Harry’s hip. “I’m going to go change out of my work clothes.”
With a silent nod, Healer Powell disappears from the room. Draco grips Harry’s hand as they wait, neither one able to form words to express their fears and needing no words to understand what the other is feeling.
“You’re not wrong. It
Harry reaches down and the warded drawer clicks open at his touch. A tug and a silent summoning spell later, a vial of lube, a set of anal beads, and a vibrating dildo are in his hand. It’s not the charmed one he uses on himself, but it’ll be good for Draco’s first time using one on someone else. He sets them beside him on the bed and rolls over to kiss Draco softly.
“I can ask our solicitor what we would need to do. When does he turn seventeen?”
“Yes,” Draco confirms, ”we want to be married before Regulus is born.”
“Me, neither. It’s all right, Harry. Just relax.” Draco’s hand moves quicker, and Harry relaxes against Draco’s shoulder, gently sucking on his earlobe. It’s not long before Harry is moaning and cumming and his knees are nearly giving out. Draco’s strong arm draws Harry against his chest and holds him upright as Draco tips over the edge, their releases swirling together and away down the drain.
“We’re going to hang up so I can Apparate Matthew home. We’ll be there in a moment.”
“Al?”
“Harry.” His tone is soft. “Come on, love. You need to get this potion down before the other wears off. Unless you want another round of vomiting, that is.”
“Yes, Al. I’m happier than I’ve been in a very long time. I have a fiancé I love very much who loves me in return and treats me wonderfully well. We have four amazing kids and one more on the way.” He pats Al’s shoulder. “This is the kind of happiness I wish for you kids one day.”
He’s just stepped under the spray when he hears Draco open the bathroom door. A rustle of clothes later, and Draco slips in with him.
“Works for me.”
“I haven’t. I sat and stared at the Prophet for the better part of an hour this morning.” Harry shrugs and scoffs at himself. “Then I used the parchment I had intended for a list to write to you, instead.”
Harry’s unprepared for the amount of rage he feels towards Matthew’s parents.
“Harry.” Draco’s voice is firm now. “You’re exhausted and you’re frustrated. It’s getting late. You’re not going to be able to focus tonight. Let me take you home.”
“Of course, I would.” Draco sounds a little wounded. This co-parenting a blended family is going to be an interesting journey. “Your safety is important to me, James.”
“In that case…” Draco eases Harry out of his arms and takes both his hands. Harry’s body shivers at the loss of warmth and contact.
Harry breathes in the cooling autumn air and mulls over how very much he’s enjoyed spending the afternoon with Draco. So much so, that they parted with a friendly handshake, agreeing to owl and find time to get together again. Plus, Harry can’t deny that he finds Draco very
“Well, perhaps that’s a good thing,” Draco drawls. Matthew laughs.
“You’re doing so well, Harry. I’m so proud of you. I love you so much.” Draco’s steady stream of comfort and reassurance grounds him and gives him strength.
Harry laughs and moves to straddle Draco’s legs. Those slender hips lift just enough for Harry to slide his fingers under the elastic and slowly reveal the final part of Draco’s body to him.
“Like a date?” Harry asks, his insecurity needing the clarification.
Harry’s tugging an oversized green hoodie — Draco’s old quidditch hoodie to be precise — on over his t-shirt when the Floo chimes. He stares, wide-eyed, at Draco who looks equally panicked.
. Love like this happens in fairy tales, not in real life with your former childhood nemesis. Still, here he is, with his fiancé and their unborn son and their big, beautiful, blended family.
“Matthew, I’m sure you know we’re extremely open about sex and sexuality in this house.”
Harry lays and listens to trunks bumping and feet stomping below him until there’s a pop and Harry knows they’re gone.
“Nothing is
“Yes, Hermione?” Harry tries (and fails) to keep from grinning.
Draco looks almost sheepish as he shrugs nonchalantly. “I offered to meet you and escort you to the office. I thought you might appreciate a familiar face.”
“That would be wonderful.”
“No, It’s not that,” Draco says quickly. “I do. Very much. I guess I imagined being a lot more apprehensive for the ‘let’s move in together’ conversation. And I didn’t picture it happening at the kitchen sink.”
“Zabini.” Harry smiles in return before looking at Draco. While his body is perfectly poised and relaxed, Harry knows that look in his eyes. His nerves are as on edge as Harry’s own.
“We have a solicitor ready to deal with it, James,” Harry tries to reassure his son. “I know you’ve gotten some press from you and Matthew, but this will probably be a bit different.”
Scorpius’ footsteps fade into the distance and there’s a distinct
“Of course.”
Lily looks up at her dad, big green eyes as sincere as an eleven-year-old’s can be.
He pulls two books of constellations towards him and flips open the large one to a diagram of the constellations of the night sky, spreading it across both their laps.
“Let’s go back to that Muggle cafe with the French onion soup you like so much. I don’t feel like being papped today.”
Draco heaves a gigantic sigh and Harry looks at him in alarm.
“Vision charm, I think,” Harry replies immediately. “If Draco kisses me, I don’t want to have to worry with my glasses. Not the first time, at least.”
“Removed the benevolent magic from the imaging. It’s residual Dark Magic. It can’t do any harm under most circumstances, but if the core is strained, it moves in and causes haemorrhaging. I suspect if I had an average magical core, I’d have been dead already.”
“In the lab, yes.”
“Yes, Lil. I love him very much.”
“We are.” Draco smiles at Harry. “We’re moving in together and we’d like a new bedroom suite.”
He stumbles out into the CRMM reception room and is startled by two strong hands on his shoulders, helping him to regain his balance. His eyes shoot up and lock onto a familiar pair of smiling grey ones. Draco withdraws his hands once Harry is steady and shakes his head with a bit of a smirk.
Harry’s mind is whirling. He’s pregnant?!? He’s not supposed to be able to carry. He and Draco never discussed more children. This wasn’t part of their plan. Harry glances at Draco whose eyes are wide with shock.
“Will that be enough?”
“My mother’s owl.” He raises his voice. “Leave him, Lil. I’ll be right down. He’ll bite your finger off if the letter isn’t for you.”
“So are you getting married sooner then?” Lily is all smiles. Harry figured his little girl would be excited about a baby.
“No, I just didn’t realise how tight my muscles are.” Harry shifts slightly. “Go on. It feels good.”
“Breathe through your nose. You only have to keep it down for a minute.” Draco’s coaching helps, and Harry breathes, willing his stomach to stay put.
“We can call Healer Carr or Healer Powell about inducing.”
“It’s possible, yes.” Draco’s tone is careful and he is clearly confused.
Fingers tweak his nipples again as hands run down to his hips and grip.
Harry takes a deep breath. Speaking openly about preferences during sex is never exactly easy. It’s a little awkward even in the best circumstances. But this is important to him. He wants to know what Draco likes and dislikes, and he wants Draco to feel comfortable doing things he knows Harry will enjoy.
Harry opens his eyes long enough to see one Mediwizard on each side of him and Healer Powell between his legs, then the twisting in his gut intensifies and he needs to push again.
“Pookie?”
“I am.” Harry’s brain is reeling, trying to figure out how all of this fits with his illness.
“For what it’s worth, I like who you’ve become.” Harry catches himself forgetting to breathe again as Draco’s eyes lock onto his own.
Draco snickers as they follow the hostess to their table. Every eye in the restaurant swivels to look as they walk by, and Harry internally rolls his eyes. People always openly gawk when he goes out with the children, but this is going to be worse than usual. He and Draco had decided beforehand that they weren’t going to behave any differently to appease the masses or the press. They’re in a happy, loving relationship and anyone who doesn’t like it doesn’t have to look.
“Was this an accident?”
“Thank you for the opportunity. I’m excited to get started,” Harry says in return. And he really means it. After talking with Mr Mason, Harry is certain that this job will challenge him, but he finds it fascinating. He’s optimistic it will be fulfilling for him, as well.
“I didn’t even know you were a carrier.”
“Of course.” Harry sets his book aside, wraps his hands around the bottom of his belly, and rubs.
Draco gives an undignified snort and the three of them burst out laughing.
“I can certainly understand why you’d be concerned about being exploited like that.” Draco sounds appreciative of Harry’s staunch opposition to being nothing but an icon. “What do you mean
Al hangs his head and Harry laughs. Harry draws his wand and levitates James’ trunk over next to Al’s and Scorpius’ and makes eye contact with Draco. Draco nods once, and Harry draws a steadying breath as he looks at his kids.
He carefully schools his voice to be caring and supportive instead of angry.
Harry sinks onto the blanket, impressed immediately with the extensive cushioning charms Draco has put on it. It’s like laying down on a soft bed. Draco settles beside him and guides him gently onto his back. Harry reaches for Draco but Draco grasps his hands and lays them back at his sides.
“Let me clean this up, and we can go upstairs.” He gathers the remains of their dinner, and Draco grabs the popcorn bowl and empty butterbeer bottles.
“Thank you. That might be my saving grace.” He shrugs at the Healer. “Being still and doing nothing has never been a particular strength of mine.”
“Then I got peppered with questions about when we might get engaged or married, and whether or not they would be permitted to come on our honeymoon.”
“No, you haven’t upset me.” Harry braces himself and forges ahead. “It’s actually at the other end of the emotional spectrum.”
“Merlin, yes. I do the same.”
be getting his own room.” James pulls a face, and Harry shakes his head. “I know you’ll probably continue to share a bed. We just want him to have his own space if he needs some time to himself.”
“Ok then.” Draco kisses Harry quickly. “I’ll be back as soon as I can.”
“Mmm. Same.” Harry’s mouth waters at the memory of licking his way into Draco’s heat whilst Draco was spread open on the tabletop. “You…you make my body feel good in a way that literally no one has before. It’s wonderful. I have only one complaint about our sex life, actually.”
Harry hesitates. He really wants to finish this last core imaging before he leaves.
“Everything you asked for is in here, including the potions Draco just bottled. We’re going to spell it to require your magical signature so you can maintain your privacy.”
Harry tries and fails to hide a smile.
“You’re never graceful anywhere, except maybe on a broom.” Draco quips, making Harry chuckle. The man steps back and Harry watches as he blatantly looks him over with an appreciative gaze. The gesture makes Harry’s stomach swoop for a much more pleasant reason than the upcoming job interview. “You look great. Are you ready?”
“I certainly think it has — minus the being ill, of course — but I’m in a different position than you are. I know you’ve been okay with everything, but I wasn’t sure you thought it was all
Harry blinks, startled.
“Me, too.” Draco gently tips Harry’s chin up and covers his mouth with those perfect, pink lips. He sighs into the kiss as a tongue teases his lips open.
Harry nearly bursts with pride. He has always told his children they have lived a privileged upbringing despite losing their mother. James seems to recognise that and has a desire to make a difference. For all he tries to hide it, he has a very sensitive soul.
not enough to match the sensations in his dream. He hesitates, wondering if he should be embarrassed at what he’s thinking about doing, even though he’s alone in his house in the privacy of his own bedroom.
“He brought wine. He kept me company in the kitchen while I got dinner into the oven.” Harry’s hands head for his hair again, but he catches himself this time and forces them into his lap. He chews his bottom lip, rolling over memories from the previous night and trying to decide how to explain them.
“Staying away from her sounds delightful, actually. I’m not at all interested in Claire. She’s not my type.” Harry sees relief flit through Draco’s expression and wonders how he’s supposed to interpret it. He shakes his head as he finishes processing everything Draco has been saying. “Wait. You think I look good in these trousers?”
“I’ll be back in a few.”
“If you look here—“ Healer Carr gestures to the image she’s just frozen, “—you can see tiny arms and legs beginning to form.”
Harry bears down again, pushing against the bizarre sensation of feeling Regulus’ body sliding down inside his body. Gasping for breath, he hesitates.
“Why don’t you check?” he asks suggestively.
“So, first of all, do you have enough lube and condoms?”
“I don’t. And he made the choice to break our engagement over it, not I.” Hermione sighs deeply.
The kids all clamour for a seat and Draco helps Harry out of his coat before pulling out his chair for him. Harry kisses his cheek in thanks before sitting, shaking his head at the gasps he’s hearing around the spacious dining room. Draco slides into the seat next to him.
“I felt the wards shift when you Apparated in. They’re pretty restricted, so I figured it was you.”
“Reservation for Potter and Malfoy, for seven,” Draco tells the hostess. Harry nearly chokes on his laughter as the hostess’s eyes move from Draco’s face, to Harry’s face, to their joined hands, to the five children, eyes growing wider by the second.
“You’re both okay. Better than okay. The malevolent magic was all contained and counter-cursed. Both your vitals stayed stable the whole time.” Draco’s hand smoothes Harry’s forehead and flattens his hair.
Malfoy eyes Harry carefully. “What do you mean you don’t know where…oh! You’ve put your youngest on the train, yeah?”
“We did.” Harry suddenly feels a bit shy again. “And then he stayed for another glass of wine and we watched a movie,” he blurts.
Al’s head perks up.
He’s just drying off from his shower when Edgar returns, parchment tied to his leg. Harry tucks his towel around his waist and collects the parchment, sending Edgar off to the perch.
“Is Mina a Muggle-born?”
“Are you nervous?” Harry asks against Draco’s kiss-swollen lips.
“That doesn’t mean they need to hear it.” Draco squeezes Harry's hips gently. “We need to go or we’ll be late.”
Matthew gives James a meaningful look. He’s apparently the one who has been chosen to broach the subject first.
Harry would have lost his mind at home by now if it weren’t for Hermione. She’s been supplying him with a steady stream of books — fiction and non-fiction — and DVDs. It’s not unusual anymore for Hermione to be around a few evenings a week, chatting with Harry about what’s going on at the Ministry or puttering around the potions lab upstairs with Draco, seeing what he’s got brewing.
“I love the four of you.” Harry is trying desperately not to get choked up. “All right, go! We’ll see you at Easter!”
Touching a hand to the door and then pulling it open, Harry holds it to let Draco step in first. Following behind, Harry nearly walks straight into Draco, who has stopped abruptly just inside.
“Yes, son?” Draco answers.
Soft strains drift into the kitchen as Harry slides the last two plates into the cabinet. He smiles to himself and moves to wipe the counters so he can join Draco. They had cooked dinner together and — between kisses and soft touches — had managed to put together a fantastic meal. Draco had run a foot up and down his calf as they ate, as if he couldn’t stand for them not to be touching. It had been wonderful and intimate, even if it was nothing more than preparing a meal and eating it.
He turns and heads off the platform, Harry trailing behind him.
“You got us a private pod?” Harry shoots Draco an incredulous look. No one had ever gone to this much effort for him or made him feel so special. He suspects Draco may set out to spoil him if this relationship goes well.
“I can’t tell you how happy I am to hear that.” Harry knows this will be a long journey for Al, and probably a life-long treatment plan, but he’s thrilled Al is already seeing a difference.
Draco is gently stroking his hair, whispering quietly in his ear. “I love you, Harry. I know this is a shock, but we’re having a baby. I can’t believe you’re carrying our child.” Harry focuses on Draco’s touch and his words and tries not to pay attention to what Healer Carr is doing.
“Have you given any more thought to how we want to tell the kids?” Draco’s hand rests protectively over Harry’s stomach while they lie tangled together on the couch.
Draco slips out the door as James and Matthew both slide off the bed and move to hug Harry. James gives Harry’s swollen belly a quick pat and smiles.
“I think I might be amenable,” Draco drawls, winking up at Harry.
“Oh…here it comes. I’m gonna be split into pieces.” Harry groans as he feels the tightening begin. Draco’s arms come around him, holding him close.
Confusion crosses her face. Harry smiles.
Harry looks up from his seat on the couch when he hears the “pop” of Draco’s apparition. Harry stands and gives Draco a quick kiss.
“Oh, good. I just jotted a quick note to Matthew to let him know we are moving forward with guardianship plans and that we’ll be in touch with them once we know more.”
Matthew’s tears are falling by this point. “I really thought you meant you’d just get me through Hogwarts. That’s so much already.”
The corner of Malfoy’s mouth quirks up just a bit. “Shall we, then?”
“Come on.”
They stroll the furniture section hand in hand, and Harry can’t shake his deep sense of elation that he and Draco are taking steps to build a life
“You’re not the only one who didn’t sleep well.” Harry looks more intently at Draco’s eyes and notices the tired lines there. “Why don’t we go get some takeaway and watch a film on the couch?”
He hits send and settles in for what could be an uncomfortable conversation.
He leans forward and examines the wrinkles developing around his eyes.
“It does, doesn’t it?” Harry chuckles. “I’m pretty happy about it, though.”
Harry extends his arm and feels the needle slip into his vein. Suddenly everything is swimming and his vision is closing in from the sides and everything he can still see is hazy.
Releasing Hermione, Harry gestures to the table and she settles herself in a chair.
“Go get the other three. We might as well do this now,” Harry says softly. Draco nods and stands.
“It’s perfect.”
“Do I look as bad as I feel?”
Harry resists his desire to deepen the kiss. The kids will be arriving in about half an hour, and that doesn’t leave enough time for even a quick shag. Draco apparently feels no such hindrance and Harry has to ease away gently.
James’ face goes red, knowing that he’s about to have a discussion about sex with his dad, his dad’s fiancé, and his boyfriend, but he nods. He disappears through the door and Harry immediately looks at Draco.
“In the photograph? No.” Draco runs his eyes down the length of Harry’s body, sitting up against the headboard. “Right now, yes.”
“Of course.” The Healer adjusts her wand until the little boy’s face pops back in to focus. “Would you like some images of his face?”
“Ok, let’s get Scorpius settled into a room, get dinner ordered, and get everyone unpacked. If you have more questions, you can ask either of us or both of us together.”
“You don’t even want to know how much Dark Magic I saw before seventeen,” Harry spits, wondering exactly how much malevolent magic might come from having a piece of a megalomaniac’s soul in your body for sixteen years, “so unless you want the Prophet running a front-page story about how Harry Potter
Shaking his head, Harry mindlessly kicks a small rock up the path in front of him. He has no idea what to do now that he’s acknowledged his attraction to the blond, especially considering how very open Draco had been about his sexuality. He’s not supposed to find someone whose father once tried to murder him attractive, is he?
“Dad will be down in just a minute.”
They turn to where Draco has the other children and their luggage arranged for the Portkey.
Draco returns to the room that night slightly earlier than usual, having come straight from the library with all the relevant books and notes he’s collected on the subject.
“There aren’t many things I don’t know.” The man who claims to be Merlin smiles mysteriously, “You also look awful like your ancestor. He was in my year. Kind of a prat if you ask me, but rather brilliant at potions.”
Pansy sighs, and for a moment she reminds him of Granger when Potter or Weasley is being exceedingly stupid. “You know, for how much you stare at him, it’s a miracle how much you don’t
“It’s not like that.” He shakes his head and tosses the newspaper back at Pansy a little vehemently. “We were just — hanging out
He turns to look at Harry, who looks perfectly at home sitting at the Slytherin table, chewing on a piece of toast and stealing sips from Draco’s coffee. He wonders if his mother knew then. Though even if she didn’t, she definitely knows now.
Draco nods and tries not to think about the implications in those words. He stands up and pushes the chair back to its place, still a little dazed.
When Draco wakes up the sun is in his eyes. Light streams in from the gap between the curtains, too warm and almost blinding. He blinks rapidly to adjust before sitting up, still disoriented, his head aching like it might explode. He startles a little when he sees the dark-haired boy sleeping soundly next to him, his head oriented toward the wrong end of the bed. But before Draco can try to remember how he ended up falling asleep in Potter’s bed, he notices the time displayed on the clock on the opposite wall, and promptly panics.
“Wow. These are nice.” He immediately takes off his glasses and puts the new ones on, blinking a few times to adjust. “And they fit perfectly. How does your mum know which ones to get?”
“Now, can you fix this radio or not? ”
“Draco!” He hears Lovegood shout first. The older Ravenclaw sprints up to his attackers before they could get the chance to scatter and disappear. Potter is running towards him.
“Blimey, that’s not at all what Binns told us in History of Magic.” Draco forces himself to stop laughing when his stomach starts to hurt, and clears his throat a few times to recover. “But you must’ve got on with him well enough to become his court sorcerer later, no?”
Silence looms over the space between them, the ticking of the clock on the wall is amplified thousandfold, echoing in the empty room.
Harry frowns.
That’s how they end up sitting across from each other on Potter’s bed, 3 a.m., each leaning against a bedpost with their legs outstretched, their knees close enough to touch, while exchanging banters and passing back and forth the bottle of Ogden’s Potter had smuggled in from Hogsmeade last weekend. The radio lies flat on the bed next to Potter, playing some late-night music programme he chose after spending quite some time going through all the newly discovered Muggle stations. Draco can’t help but marvel at how easy it is to just be here with him, drinking and talking instead of hexing each other to death. It wasn’t supposed to be, it had seemed, yet somehow it just
. He stops that train of thought right in its track.
“I dare you to listen to this one and
picked out for him. And Draco knows he’d happily sit through a dinner with the Weasleys if it meant having this next to him.
“What is that supposed to mean?”
“Theoretically. I just don’t think that’s really where he went.” Draco shakes his head, frowning as he examines the portrait up close. “He’s young in this portrait, Harry, only a few years older than us. And I’m quite certain that there are no other known portraits of him in his youth in Wizarding Britain.”
Nothing serious, of course, they are only a group of young Ravenclaws. Draco vaguely recognizes the blond girl leading the group — her parents died in the series of raids on Muggleborns early on in the summer last year. Draco had very little to do with those, having been essentially locked up in the Manor at the time, though that’s not to say he doesn’t feel somewhat responsible for it.
“Gin and I are much better off as friends, Luna. And — there’s someone else.”
A voice in his head screams.
Harry stares into wide grey eyes, and the disbelief in them mirrors what he feels.
He’s gotten quite good at avoiding spontaneous attacks in the halls these days. He usually has his hand on his wand every time he turns his back or turns a corner. And he does, when they approach him on his way to Transfiguration, but he loses his focus for a split second when he hears Potter’s voice coming from somewhere near.
If he really thinks about it, it might’ve actually been sixth year, when he was desperately trying to figure out what Draco was up to. While he can now admit that his motives in tracking down Draco then were less clear cut than he had made himself and everyone else believe, his instincts were right in that it was, in fact, tied to Voldemort business, the way much of his life has been.
“Do you not?” He breathes, then swallows hard when he hears the tremble in his own voice, suddenly terrified of what it might give away. He wants to step back, but his limbs don’t seem to be listening to him. It’s not even a question.
Unlike what Draco would’ve expected though, Potter doesn’t appear surprised or incredulous. He seems
gossip around the Great Hall first thing Monday morning. He grossly underestimates how observant Potter can be, however. Before he could move much at all, Potter turns back to him and grabs him by the elbow.
himself, created the Room of Requirement. Salazar, what is with Slytherins and secret rooms?
Draco sees out of the corner of his eye a group of Hufflepuff fifth-years walking by them just as he’s shoving some snow down the back of Potter's cloak. He sobers a bit at the alarmed expressions on their faces. Potter, however, clearly not having noticed the attention, lets out what could only be described as a loud squawk before whipping around and tackling Draco onto the snow-covered ground.
“Mhmm.” The other boy stirs awake and grumbles, before blinking open one eye to peer at Draco. “It’s Saturday, Draco.”
“So it’s not true that you went on a date at Hogsmeade?” Pansy challenges.
Wrong. It turns out to be so much worse.
Potter reaches out silently, but his fingers don’t land on or even near the wound. They graze a few smaller, much older scars instead, right over his heart.
Now, to say Draco’s stunned might be an understatement.
“Not like what?” Merlin presses.
And hell, he sure can make Draco hope, but he can bloody well crush his hope, too.
“I can’t believe you didn’t tell me.”
“The other day, when you asked me why I was following you—” After a long silence, Potter whispers. He’s staring at the longest scar, the one that splits the faded skull in half, looking pained for reasons unknown, glancing back up at him, “I wasn’t lying when I said I was worried.”
“You should be more careful, though.” She adds seriously. “Those Potter fangirls will try to hex you. The Prophet will drag you through the mud. Now, and especially when it does come true.”
Draco considers that for a moment. He really doesn't see how the Weasleys would welcome him into their home on Christmas, despite him having gotten on relatively good terms with their youngest son in recent weeks.
“Harry.” Draco gasps out. “Merlin’s alive.”
“Sure — ” Draco stops when the full meaning behind Harry’s words actually occurs to him. “Oh. You can’t come inside. Not yet, anyway.”
“Maybe you should come with me,” Harry suggests softly.
It’s a little excessive, even for him. But whenever Draco tries to protest, Harry just shrugs and brushes it off with some bollock excuse about inter-house unity, and such. And Draco? Well, let’s just say he didn’t have the heart to argue with him, especially since not getting hexed by screaming girls is rather nice.
“I’m fine, Potter.”
Salazar, Draco, if that’s not pining I don’t know what is. Don’t even get me started on how you sulked every time you saw him with Ginevra Weasley in sixth year.”
“You should hire an interior decorator.” Draco gazes at the family tree tapestry in Regulus’s old room, frowning at the scorched spot where Sirius’ name had been. Harry thinks he really ought to learn to mend that at some point. “This place is in worse shape than the Manor had been last year.”
“Sounds brilliant.”
“Oh, I think that’s a story for another day.”
“I think you’re just using me as an excuse to get drunk, Potter.” Watching as he twists open the screw cap, Draco shakes his head in amusement.
Draco freezes, unable to withdraw his arm despite the disapproving voice screaming in his head. He glances at the calloused fingers wrapped tightly around his wrist, and then looks back at Potter expectantly.
“I’d apologize if I were you.” Lovegood suggests almost casually, “If you don’t want Professor Flitwick to hear about how you collaboratively cheated on your last Charms exam.”
“I thought we’ve been over this.”
“A Muggle
A fleeting thought occurs to Draco before it slips from his fuzzy brain again.
“ — he tells Merlin that Arthur is his ‘destiny’.” Draco finishes his sentence for him quietly.
As they’re walking back to the main road, Potter finally notices the group of Hufflepuffs still looking at them, and smiles at them tentatively as a greeting. Draco takes the opportunity to insert some distance between them, trying to do some damage control on what would surely become
“It’s not pity.” The other boy rushes out and grabs Draco’s wrist, gripping hard, colors climbing up his cheeks. “I—”
It’s always the same dream, with slight variations. Sometimes he’s standing right in the middle of the flames, eyes closed, waiting for the flames to lick up his robes and torch his skin and flesh. Other times, he’s on a broom clutching at a familiar presence, but a sharp turn sends him falling into the fire. Sometimes the other boy’s outstretched hand grazes and misses his. Other times, the hand doesn’t reach for him at all.
“If I recall correctly, he saved your life, and you saved his.”
The rational side of him knows that it could just be Potter being his usual altruistic self, but still that doesn’t make sense. Saving his life and testifying at his trial was the work of his moral integrity and sense of righteousness, but this — this is something different. This is kindness, and Harry Potter has never shown him kindness, nor did he ever have a reason to.
“I’ll be just a moment.”
Now that a real Black is here, Harry is practically invisible. Brilliant.
because a dragon told you that you must?”
“Hey.” He greets him, sounding breathless and almost a bit embarrassed, his green eyes sparkling in the silvery light emitting from the tips of their wands. It takes a moment for Draco to register the absence of his invisibility cloak. He didn’t even bring it.
“You were
“I think that’s a good idea.” Potter schools his expression into something relatively neutral, “Could you let Professor McGonagall know, Luna?”
“Have you not been listening to me for the past five minutes?” Draco rolls his eyes and huffs, looking appalled by his stupidity. “He wanted to make his private residence into something useful when he left Hogwarts.”
“You?”
“It’s always Potter
, Potter
Before Harry could begin to panic about it, their destination corridor comes into view. They stop in front of the seemingly innocuous brick wall, and Draco closes his eyes in concentration. A moment later, a set of familiar double doors emerge from the wall.
“What about your dinner with the Weasleys?”
She pulls out a rolled-up newspaper from her robe pocket and tosses it at Draco. He reflexively snatches it out of the air right before it hits him in the face. And just as she says, there on the front page is a photo of them at the counter at Three Broomsticks. He’s momentarily surprised that neither of them noticed someone snapping the shot. After all, both of them are as paranoid as you can get about unwanted attention these days, though for completely different reasons.
“What?” He blinks.
“All these years, I couldn’t stop thinking that maybe if I wasn’t a Malfoy and he wasn’t the Chosen One, we’d probably — get on, you know?”
“Just so you don’t accidentally end up somewhere else, when you come back, remember to require ‘Camelot’,” Merlin adds.
“It’s just a Stinging hex. It’ll be fine.”
“And why’s that?” He breathes.
But the Chosen One’s grinning at him — if only a little awkwardly, his eyes sparkling.
“Mother wanted to patch things up when they got to France. They’ve just been writing to each other. Anyway, she says hello. Open the package.”
“Alright — wait, what?!” Potter's head snaps up and he stares incredulously. Draco cringes.
“During the war. I—” Draco stills his hand, sighing as the memory comes back to him, “I had to make sure they didn’t know what I was listening to.”
“I can’t sleep.” Potter replies, sounding nonchalant, “Nightmares.”
“Right.”
“So you’re saying, sir, ” He sits down and glances around again, almost trying to make sure that this isn’t some weird dream, “That you used to live here?”
“Apparently she heard from Aunt Andromeda that we’re getting along now.”
“But I have.”
“Once in a while for dinner, when I was a child.” Draco nods pensively. “It’s sort of gloomy, isn’t it? Though that old house-elf did like me, for whatever reason. He used to scare all the other children away but brought me biscuits sometimes, the good ones.”
In the weeks leading up to Christmas holidays, Draco spent his days with Harry tagging along almost wherever he goes.
“Merlin.” Potter rubs his forehead, his fingers graze over the lightning scar involuntarily.
“Well, sort of. I’m in a portrait.”
“I did—” He frowns, “You’re Merlin?”
to be. And maybe Potter really didn’t know, but he still saved him in the end anyway — yet that might have been the worst part of it all, because it had made Draco
“We don’t
“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself,” Potter replies caustically before turning his attention back to Draco.
How ironic, Draco thinks. He wonders whether Potter knows that out of every toxic insult they’ve flung at each other, these are the words that haunt his dreams. Except not anymore, perhaps, because it appears that he’s no longer on the receiving end of it.
“Oh.” He stares. “Right.”
Harry Potter is the saviour of the Wizarding World, the beacon of everything that is right and good. He’s a flash of lightning in the dark and gloomy sky in midsummer, electrifying and powerful. He’s so close, yet just far enough to be out of reach.
“Both of you survived the war and are given the opportunity to choose again, so why won’t you take it?”
“Thought I would be able to catch you here, Harry. Ron and Ginny and I leave for the Burrow tomorrow.” She pauses and turns to look at Draco hopefully. “I’ll see you two on Christmas, yeah?”
“What did it feel like, risking everything for someone who might not appreciate it?” He asks instead.
Big mistake, clearly. “Fine. A dozen times, maybe. I’ve lost count, to be quite honest.”
one of them, Potter.” Draco drops his gaze to the now blurred mark on his forearm, “What I’ve done cannot ever be undone.”
“Huh.” Surprise flashes across Potter’s eyes for a split of a second, aimed not so much at the answer itself but at Draco. “I’ll, uh, ask Hermione about it.”
“Don’t have to clean or wipe the fog off of the lenses, of course.” Draco finishes absentmindedly.
Right when he reaches for the door handle, the voice speaks again,
“Fine.” Not that he ever thought he could be immune to Potter saying his name like that, but he doesn’t like being proven right. “I won’t.”
“What, did you not mean it?”
And of course, Potter and Lovegood turn the corner at that exact moment.
“Oh, Potter. It’s better than that, I promise.”
“Hello there.”
when I was young, could I?” The young man rolls his eyes, looking half indignant and half amused. He then leans back in his chair and absentmindedly waves his right hand, conjuring the flames in the fireplace into the shape of a baby dragon. Draco notices it then, the bright red cape draped over the arm of the chair—It’s embellished with a golden, embroidered dragon that looks rather regal. It matches the color scheme of the room.
“Alright, so why don’t you tell me what conclusion you would jump to?” He tries to keep the bitterness out of his tone. It doesn't work.
I realize I should probably clarify the housing situation here. The house system is still intact, but the eighth years live together in a separate dorm. They have single rooms and much more freedom around the school since they're all adults.
“No, Kreacher, thank you.” The elf looks a little put out at that but dutifully takes his leave. Draco turns back to Harry then. “Are you going to give me a tour?”
Draco could only nod.
“Oh, he probably thinks that I’m up to some shady business again. After all, he was right before, so he must believe he’s right this time around, too.” Merlin falls silent, and Draco can’t help rambling on, barely masking the inexplicable anger raging through him with acrid sarcasm.
“Can I come?”
Then he walks on past, forcing himself not to look back.
“I just — ” There’s a brief, frustrated pause, and Potter runs his fingers through the unruly dark strands on his head, like he’s already regretting what he’s about to say, but can’t seem to stop himself because he simply can’t hold it in anymore.
“And you say you’re not suspicious. How convincing, Potter.” He closes his eyes and settles for the truth, suddenly exhausted. “I’m fixing that room. You’ve got a problem with that?”
“What did it feel like, lying to your aunt and Voldemort for him?” Merlin asks bemusedly, “Tossing your wand to him when you know it could get you killed?”
“What a coincidence.” The other boy smiles after a flicker of surprise flashes across his eyes, “I’m sorry, too.”
taste in music.” Rolling his eyes, Draco drawls sarcastically, “If you can’t tone it down, at least listen to a better station.”
“Draco, listen to me.” He meets his eyes and demands, and Draco’s chest clenches at the way his name rolls off of Potter tongue, soft and sincere, like that’s how he’s always been calling him. “You can’t erase what you’ve done, that’s true, but that doesn’t mean your life has to be defined by it. You are not a bad person—far from it, in fact, so stop punishing yourself for a choice you never made. It’s all over now and you survived. And what’s the point of making it out alive, if you refused to
Draco frowns. “What do you mean?”
“Huh.” That gives Draco pause. That would certainly fit, given that the room was constructed with medieval magic. “That sounds possible. I’ve looked all through the restricted section, though. Found nothing of it. Not sure where else I could look at this point.” And for some reason, Merlin just wouldn't tell him more about it, though he asks almost every time he visits.
“No, no of course I did.”
“How do you—” Draco frowns.
“You’re not expecting me to pay you for this, are you?”
He makes a mental note to look up how that works later.
“Right, but is it? Something that can’t be changed?”
“Everything about him.”
“That’s just because you’re terrible at finding them.” He scoffs absentmindedly, still too absorbed in his drifting thoughts, “You have to bypass some wards.”
“What’s wrong?”
Draco simply shrugs. It’s not like he has anything better to do. Pansy and Blaise tend to go out on what they refuse to call dates on weekends, and he’s not about to subject himself to third-wheeling his friends.
just can’t seem to suppress the Gryffindor in him, picks up a fistful of snow and throws it right at Draco’s head. The stunt inevitably evolves into a full-on snowball fight, because really, how could it not?
“I see you haven’t changed at all, Potter.” He leans in to whisper in his ear, and tries not to think too much about why the other boy shivers at his touch.
“Can’t change the past, of course, but what about the future?”
“All those years, you stood by his side and protected him without receiving any credit?”
“For Christmas.” He shrugs like it’s obvious, but looks away. “Kreacher might be more inclined to make the place livable and cook some decent food if an actual Black is in the house.”
He regrets this new friendship thing already.
, like the last piece of a puzzle falling into place.
“Call it what you want.” Draco swallows hard, shoving the disappointment from inside his chest. “But he suggested that we start over, so I suppose you could say that.”
“See what?”
“Of course.”
“Oh. Right.” Harry rubs the back of his head a little awkwardly, realizing that he’s unlikely to be of any help for that. “I’ll leave you to it, then. Uh, just, holler if you need anything.”
He thinks he’s finally starting to understand why Potter is reacting like this. This self-sacrificing idiot with a saviour complex. Brave, kind, stupid Potter, who always wants to fix everything by himself.
“Great-aunt Walburga. Charming as always.”
“Wait, wait, let me get this straight — ” Draco’s almost finished with his rum when Merlin starts talking about a speaking dragon that sees the future. “You worked as a
“That’s right. Where he was apparently a servant for years since magic was —” Draco stops abruptly. “Maybe I shouldn’t be telling you this part without his permission.”
“Apparently.” Draco nods grimly. “And History of Magic was all just loads of bull.”
Now that the dust has settled, and the person he’s yearned for is alive and well in front of him, close enough for him to touch yet so far,
this, Draco lets him.
“If he’s that concerned he should’ve just left me to rot in Azkaban. But no, he had to play this selfless, forgiving hero and testify, so now he has to keep tabs on me just to make sure I don’t muck it up again and ruin his reputation.”
The headline above the photo read:
“It was on the front page of the bloody Prophet, for Merlin’s sake. Everyone was talking about it at breakfast.”
Draco undoes his shirt buttons and Potter freezes.
“Welcome back, Master Draco. Master Draco’s trunk is already in Master Regulus’ old bedroom. Would Master Draco like some tea and biscuits?”
He slips out of bed and pulls on a jumper and some trousers. There’re great things about having individual bedrooms this year, except it also feels disorienting at times. He’s reluctant to admit that he actually misses how Blaise’s small snores and Theo’s incoherent muttering used to ground him in reality when he startles from a nightmare. Now he’s left with himself, alone in the silent darkness.
“What about you?”
“Oi, get up. My clothes are getting wet.” Draco mumbles, despite not being quite ready to let go of the very warm savior in his arms.
Potter’s gaze is flickering, and there’s a slight, almost imperceptible tremor in the hand tightly gripping his wand, betraying his thinly veiled nervousness.
“Um, anyhow.” He’s fidgeting with a loose strand of yarn on his jumper, his gaze flickering everywhere but at him. “Goodnight, Malfoy.”
“How many times?”
“Good. Meet you in the common room in half an hour, then.”
“You really believed in that?”
Or worse, Potter trying to
“I take it that you already owled Mrs. Weasley?” He asks when Hermione is gone.
He feels the blanket being abruptly tugged away from him. He shivers a little from the cold and reluctantly opens one eye.
Not that there’s much to be seen, but Harry takes him through the foyer into the living area, then up the stairs. He had spent his summer tearing this place apart, removing any spells or objects that could even resemble dark magic despite Kreacher’s very vocal protests. It took so long that he never actually got around to doing any redecorating, and the house still looks as dreary as the day he inherited it.
“If you really don’t want to go to that it’s fine.” Harry looks a little put out at that. “But I’m sure Molly and Arthur would love to have you there.”
“Alright.”
“None. I would ask him.” Merlin tilts his head and studies Draco intently. In response, he carefully masks his facial expressions against the piercing gaze that makes him want to hide.
He lets the letter slip out of his hand onto the table, and buries his face in his palms so as not to die of sheer embarrassment. Merlin, not only has his mother heard about the rumors, she’s
The Room of Requirement wasn’t exactly on top of anyone’s list in the rebuilding of Hogwarts over the summer. Draco, however, recently stumbled upon some books on sentient object repairs and transfiguration implementation that made him want to try to fix it. He’s spent every night since Halloween performing combinations of spells at the brick wall, and he’s gotten so far as getting the double door to show up. He can tell that he’s almost there, and it’s an exhilarating feeling.
“Alright then.” Draco swallows whatever snarky comment he was going to make, and gestures at the cloak in Harry’s hand. Wordlessly, Harry unfolds it and drapes it over them both as Draco reaches for the common room door.
“I’m Harry. Harry Potter. Pleasure to make your acquaintance.”
“Bloody hell, Parkinson.”
“Look who’s back, the filthy half-breed — Oh dear, isn’t this Narcissa’s boy? What a pleasant surprise.”
What is Harry Potter to him, then?
“Will this do?”
“I believe I still owe you an apology.” He blurts out before he could regret it, letting the alcohol-induced impulse surging in his bloodstream take over his sensible head for once, “I’m sorry. For all these years.”
my Camelot.”
“Didn’t work out that way in the end, of course,” Draco adds weakly, remembering all the nights he spent alone in his room, clutching to the radio he had stolen from his mother and wishing for any traces of
“Which, mind you, includes saving my life.” He cracks a smile, but the look in his eyes soon turns somber. “I was there when Dumbledore died, you know.”
“There might have been, but I can’t remember. I could ask Hermione to find the book again, if you’d like to read it?” Harry offers sheepishly. “Though I don’t think that helps with our current missing portrait case. He must have gone to another portrait of his, right? One of those Chocolate Frog cards, maybe? I don't really see why you'd be so concerned. ”
On the page, underneath several scratched out spells is one that theoretically should fully restore the door. He whispers it several times to test his pronunciation, before raising his wand at the door, then swishes and points.
(See the end of the chapter for
There’s a suspicious blush on Harry’s cheek at that, and Draco eyes him curiously.
“I know, I just — I dream about it, you know. Sometimes in those dreams you — ” He can’t seem to get the words out, but Draco thinks he knows what he’s trying to say.
“He’s gone.” Draco breathes to him, confusion and anxiety evident in his shaky voice, “Merlin’s gone from his portrait.”
Draco nods, and ponders the name as he walks toward the exit, suddenly remembering it from History of Magic. Isn’t that where Merlin served as court sorcerer?
They do try to hex him. To Draco’s utter embarrassment, they succeed, too.
Draco’s surprised at his own conclusion.
“We — what,
“Too busy with term exams.” Draco shakes his head.
“They’re high-end wizarding glasses, Potter.” Draco rolls his eyes. He could be such a Muggle, sometimes. “They magically adjust to your eyesight as well as the lighting. They’re also dust and moisture resistant, so you don’t have to — ”
“Anyone care to explain to me what is going on?” Lovegood asks icily.
Draco laughs at how close that is to what he first believed, and Harry turns to stare at him in surprise.
.” Merlin points out, like that should really matter.
He takes a gulp of his coffee and opens the letter.
“Another day?”
“Hmm?”
Draco swallows hard, a lump thick and heavy in his throat.
“Oh, we’re friends now?”
“We’ll be over first thing in the morning, ‘Mione.”
He remembers that incident on the train, how his blood was boiling in his veins at the thought of Potter trying to stop him, Potter
“I don't.” Staring straight into his eyes, Potter steps even closer and holds his gaze with newfound resolve, looking all too earnest and sincere now it makes Draco angry and hopeful all at once.
“You’re Merlin.” He shakes his head, trying to process the information, before suddenly realizing that he’s talking to one of the greatest wizards of all time. “I mean,
He knocks on Draco’s door promptly at midnight with his cloak clutched in his hand, and Draco opens the door with a look of (delighted?) surprise in his eyes. He’s changed out of his school robes into a soft-looking grey jumper and black jeans —
“Draco Malfoy.” He takes his hand, and all he could seem to think is
EDIT: The song in the radio is Iris by The Goo Goo Dolls (1998)
. Draco knows he really should hate it. But Salazar, it's a heady thing.
“Nobody has
“Don’t have to what?”
Harry sighs, not about to lie. He watches as Draco pulls out his wand to dust off the shelves, his grey eyes gleaming at the sight of the volumes. Many of the titles are in ancient runes that Harry can’t even pretend to understand.
“Is it true?”
Draco scowls, but the corners of his eyes crinkle almost fondly. “I’m not cheap, Potter.”
They don’t talk about it.
“The way he looks at you.”
“Well, it was the only way to find out who had died. And — ” He stops himself, swallowing hard.
“Never said you were.”
“Who says that it has to be a one-time deal?” Merlin gets up to add a few logs into the fireplace and puts on a kettle, then leans against the wall with his arms crossed.
“What in Merlin’s name are you talking about?”
“Wait, what?” Draco frowns. “Was Merlin not the sorcerer of King Arthur’s court in Muggle stories?”
He never could focus on anything else when Potter’s involved.
He finally says it, just like that, as easy as if he's been calling him by his given name all this time. Draco thinks a little forlornly back on the boy who couldn't be at home in his own house, who muttered the name in secret to a tampered radio, praying that he'd live.
“Right,
“You’re right.” The dark-haired boy nods after a moment. “Let me fix this, then.”
While the students around them were all genuinely shocked at first, some faculty members raised an occasional eyebrow, it quickly became enough of a norm that no one really bats an eyelash now. Draco has already had a few genuinely entertaining chess matches with Weasley and regularly sits with Granger at the library. Even Pansy, on the rare occasions where she sees him eating lunch by himself, would casually ask where his ‘golden boyfriend’ is, a question to which Draco’s only response is:
“Kreacher? No bloody way!” The dark-haired boy huffs out a laugh. “He still hates me, always complaining to his old mistress in the portrait.”
“You have more questions.”
“That you’re dating Harry Potter.”
“You don’t understand, sir.” Draco shakes his head, “We’re not like that.”
And indeed, it’s a luxurious dark green cashmere scarf, made by a wizarding fashion boutique in Paris he vaguely recognizes the name of. Draco wraps it around his neck and buries his nose in the plush wool, breathing in the familiar scent of his mother’s daffodil perfume.
“Is that what keeps you up, too?” He probes cautiously, like he’s trying his best not to offend.
“I wouldn’t be so sure —”
Potter’s silent all of a sudden, looking like he’s scrambling for an answer but can seem to find a plausible one. He opens his mouth, hesitates, and closes it again. And as if his heart has just been dropped from high above the clouds, Draco’s suddenly hit with an all too familiar sharp twinge in his chest. He shakes his head in mockery and ill-disguised disappointment, hating himself for his stupid, ridiculous
“Yeah, I think his death was prophesied?” Harry pulls a face at that. “Must say I’m not a huge fan of that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco just shoots him a flat look. “For research on mending the Room, Potter.”
“Of course not, idiot.”
“Because Camelot persecuted magic.”
Christmas is an important time for the Merlin fandom, so I thought I’d use it as is. If you know, you know.
Draco must admit he’s a little stunned at that. Those young Ravenclaws seem to cower a little, too. After all, no one thought Lovegood could sound genuinely furious with that soft, dreamy voice.
But none of these is the most dreaded kind. That, by far, is the one closest to reality, the one where he makes it out of the fire and walks on solid ground, only to witness his savior lying pale and motionless, in the half-giant’s arms.
Then he flips open the book and begins to read.
Harry following him everywhere, it would be a hard one to dispel. Harry doesn’t seem to mind, however, which is bizarre since he normally hates all the lies Skeeter likes to spew about him. Surprisingly, Granger and Weasley have said nothing of it, either.
It’s the last thing Draco sees before he startles awake, drenched in cold sweat. The clock on his bedside table tells him it’s three in the morning. He lies there and inhales deeply, filling his lungs with the familiar air that now smells vaguely of pines and holly from the newly installed Christmas decorations. After a few moments, his breathing finally slows. Even in dreams, the heat makes him feel as if he’s suffocating.
They don’t talk about it when they pass each other by in the Great Hall, when their eyes meet from across the room; They don’t talk about it when they run into each other in the Common Room, where Potter’s curled up alone in the red armchair by the fire doing schoolwork, giving his best friends some space; They don’t talk about it in Potions, when Draco’s grinding up dried knotgrass in a mortar and Potter’s slowly stirring the purple liquid bubbling in their shared caldron, the tension in the thick air between them palpable.
Draco takes another gulp of Firewhisky, but doesn’t tear his gaze off of him. Potter stops his humming then and opens his eyes, a dark, hazy green, smoldering with something that resembles longing. They hold each other’s gaze, while the song keeps playing.
In the common room, there’s a lone figure sitting in an armchair by the fireplace, reading a heavy tome. Harry pauses. It’s not typical of her to stay up this late by herself these days.
“I thought you were advocating for not thinking about the things that can’t be changed?” Draco raises an amused eyebrow, doing his best to ignore the sharp twist of regret in his stomach.
“To be fair, it
“Oh.” The other boy seems a little taken aback, “What were you listening to?”
Pansy’s at his door, her arms crossed over her chest, wand in hand, glaring at him in anger and disbelief.
tell me Muggles have terrible music.”
He doesn’t even need to check the byline to know who could come up with such a disgustingly sensational title.
“Right, then. Goodnight, boys. Don’t stay up too late.” she says mildly.
“Perhaps he went to visit someone for Christmas.” Draco sighs, resigned. “Portraits do that, right?”
He’s pouring himself a cup of coffee at the Slytherin table when his owl swoops down and drops a parcel on his lap gracefully. There’s a letter attached to it, and from the looks of the expensive monogrammed parchment envelope, it’s from his mother. He sighs. It’s about time she heard.
“Oh, Draco? Tell Mr. Potter to stop poking at the wall with his wand.”
“Yes, of course I — what?” He blinks, suddenly alert at the sight of Merlin’s mischievous smile. “How did you—?”
“The war wasn’t your fault, either.”
“Uh, right.” Draco looks just as bewildered next to him. “Goodnight, Granger.”
“Mhmm, maybe.”
“Story about what?”
.” He sighs, setting his mug back down on the table with a frustrated thud. The wizard in the portrait doesn’t even bother feigning surprise at his answer.
. To be quite honest, it just slipped out like that, easy as breathing. He shrugs.
, you think Godric — no. I can see how the colors are misleading, though.”
. “It felt like even if the world crumbles in the next moment, I couldn’t care less.”
Draco flips through his journal and finds the note he had jot down and underlined weeks ago. He had feared that said “original form” would constitute an empty hallway or a broom closet half burned down, which would make his attempt at restoring the room to its full capacity rather difficult, but nothing could’ve prepared him for
He knows that whatever this is, it’s probably going to end in disaster. But what can he do? He’s never had any semblance of self-control when it came to Harry Potter, after all.
And lets out a gasp at the sight of the admittedly extensive collection.
“You heard me,” Potter mutters, his jaws tightening, and Draco’s not entirely sure if he wants to punch it or trace his finger over it.
, this is bad.
“C’mon, nobody should be by themselves on Christmas.”
Draco narrowly ducks out of the way of the first curse, but the second one hits him right on the chest. He loses his balance and staggers back a few steps.
— that clings all too tightly to his legs, his hair slightly tousled now that he’s stopped putting so much gel in it. He’s cradling a hefty stack of books and journals in one arm, undoubtedly his research on Transfiguration.
The fact that Harry noticed so quickly is doing strange things to him.
“Huh.” Pansy looked at him for another second, as if searching for something. “I believe you,” she concludes eventually.
. He was convinced that seven years of animosity and hatred was a weight that could never be lifted, but the way Potter’s lips curled upwards seems to suggest otherwise.
“I’m talking about this, you prat.” Potter turns to him then and their eyes lock, the fog in those the deep pools of green parts to reveal unwavering resolve. He straightens his back and holds out his hand.
“Just to make sure it’s nothing serious. You never know what the kids might be up to these days, right, Harry?” Lovegood looks at Potter expectantly, who appears utterly puzzled for a second before a blush creeps onto his cheeks.
Before he could even start processing what’s been said, Potter rushes past him up the stairwell, and with a rather loud slam of the door disappears into his room in a whirlwind. Draco leans back against the wall and stares blankly at Potter’s door, unable to quiet the chaotic voices in his head.
“Good work you’ve done there, these past few weeks. Draco Malfoy, is that right?”
“More often then not, we choose our friends and our enemies.”
“It’s mostly ancient magic. Some of this stuff is definitely not legal.” Draco remarks, sounding amazed. “This could be good.”
about it. Also, Potter wouldn’t even confirm or deny it with Andromeda? It’s absolutely bonkers.
Still a mostly Drarry chapter, but Merlin-related plot development is coming up soon.
“Hmm, indeed.” Draco hums pensively. “Anything else in that prophecy?”
Draco trails off at the sudden realization.
, the great
They do, however, form some sort of mutual understanding. Potter keeps following him, and Draco stops asking why because he has nothing to hide. Thankfully, Potter usually stays in the hallway minding his own business while Draco works inside. He doesn’t ask him what he’s doing or how far he’s gotten, and never makes mention of wanting to come in. He simply walks with Draco back to their dormitory every time, occasionally making polite small talk before bidding him goodnight, like he’s waiting for Draco to start a real conversation, which Draco fails to do every time. They’re civil with each other for the first in seven years, and it feels so foreign and strange, but also long overdue.
“This is one of those stories obliterated by history.” The young wizard in the portrait smiles wistfully, “Or romanticized, depending on where you stand.”
“Alright, alright.” Harry chuckles, and tears off the wrapping paper like the uncivilized brute that he is, revealing a leather case underneath. The logo branded on the leather looks vaguely familiar to Draco. Harry unclasps the brass closure and flips the box open, pulling out a pair of glasses — its style similar to the ones he’s wearing, though the quality is evidently much, much better.
But Potter doesn’t. Instead, he sits up and leans back against a bedpost, before running a hand absentmindedly through the bird's nest on his head, making it even worse than it was. Draco does his best to stifle a smile.
“Don’t you see, Draco?” Merlin glances down at the cape draped over the arm of his chair and splays his fingers gently over the embroidered dragon, caressing it like one would a lover’s cheek. “I wish I had told him sooner. I wish there were fewer secrets between us. I wish I had said all the things I wanted to say. I wish we had more time. And now, I don’t want to see you make the same mistake.”
“That’s — good. Brilliant, actually.”
“So it did scar.”
“But you had broom polish delivered three days ago.” Draco blurts out without thinking, then promptly snaps his mouth shut. He needs some coffee, and perhaps a hangover potion.
“Pleasure’s all mine.”
“You’ve always been quite brilliant at fixing things, if I recall correctly.” It’s a compliment from one of the greatest wizards of all time, but it makes Draco flinch as t. The memories of sixth year floods back to him.
Harry Potter is his nemesis, but when he reaches out for Draco’s left arm and tentatively rolls the sleeve back up, his expression more hurt than shocked like he’d been
He squeezes the hand. Draco? It feels like Draco.
“Oh Merlin, me too.” Draco laughs. “And the backs of my knees. I hate being touched there.”
“Have a good nap?” Draco’s eyes are laughing at him.
Harry waves a hand at the door to the lab. He waits to hear the door click shut and lock, then buries his face in Draco’s neck. Draco smells like home. Arms hold him tightly and he takes a moment just to breathe.
“This parchment has been approved and charmed by the Ministry of Magic. It has already been signed by your father and me. When you sign your name, it will be the last time you sign as Scorpius Malfoy. You will henceforth be Scorpius Potter.”
Draco kisses him, hard and quick. “I love you. I’ll be back as soon as I can.”
Draco rises from his stool and slips it back beneath the counter. “I would like that very much. Lead the way.”
“We’re engaged.” Harry’s voice comes out an awed whisper, much thicker than he’d intended.
“The view isn’t bad from here, either, but I can think of something better.” Draco’s hand skates lightly across Harry’s back and to the hip furthest from Draco. The touch sends a brilliant warmth through Harry’s body. He can’t hide the contented sigh at Draco’s touch, and he hears a pleased noise from Draco in response. Tugging gently on Harry’s hip, Draco urges Harry to roll against him. Harry willingly moves, putting his back against Draco’s chest as Draco’s arm snakes around his waist. “There,” Draco says in a satisfied voice.
They sit in comfortable silence as they eat and enjoy the lights and the skyline and just being close. When Harry’s had his fill, he stretches out on the blanket, lying prone and pillowing his head on his arms, face towards Draco.
A few hours later, Harry is lying on a hard table, line in his arm slowly pumping medications to relax him. He’s already taken the core binding potion and not feeling his magic thrumming through his body is unsettling. He squeezes Draco’s hand.
“I am, Al. It’s been a long time since I’ve had a romantic partner. It’s nice to have someone to share my life with again.”
“I’m not sure I can do this for two more hours!”
“Mr Malfoy!”
“So, about James’ letter…” Draco’s voice interrupts his thoughts.
“Do you know,” Draco’s voice is gravelly in his ear, “how incredibly sexy you look carrying our son?”
He braces himself for the reply. Al, as anticipated, immediately springs to being defensive.
“This is where it all started, one year ago.” Draco kisses his temple.
“Don’t laugh,” Draco warns, “but pizza and garlic bread from the Muggle place you took me to for lunch last week sounds amazing.”
Draco chokes on his wine. “You’re kidding.”
make his arse look good — and the jumper is just fitted enough to show off the tone he’s worked to keep on the backyard pitch.
“No fever.” Draco casts a gentle cleaning spell on Harry’s mouth, ridding him of that awful taste that lingers after throwing up.
Draco procures a phial from the dresser and helps Harry to swallow the contents. Draco sighs softly before climbing back into bed.
“He is. Come here.”
Harry kisses Draco gently. “I’m sorry. But we really do need to shower and get on with it.”
He feels the bed shift as Draco sits up, but he can’t even bring himself to look over at his husband. He just rocks, slowly, and tries to think about anything other than the constant discomfort he’s feeling.
“Can’t you use the London pitch in the wizarding section of Hyde Park?” Harry inquires.
“Did I hurt you?” Draco looks mortified.
“I just wish people would mind their own business,” Harry shrugs. “Want to help me pick out something to wear that puts this one on display, then? Might as well leave no room for doubt.”
Minerva blinks rapidly. “Are you to tell me in eleven years’ time, Hogwarts will be host to a Potter-Malfoy child?”
“Hello again, Bernice!” Harry greets her.
“It is. You’ve been working hard; you didn’t even notice when I came in. Making progress on the potion?”
“Perfect. Nursery?”
“That’s always been the going opinion.” Harry laughs. “Seems that’s not what people expect out of a bi guy.”
Draco’s hand cups his cheek gently, and Harry’s tears spill over again.
“So she just expects you to break things off with me because of her sense of family…honour?” Harry knows Draco doesn’t ascribe to pure-blood ideals at all anymore, but the fact that this ever would have been an expectation is mind-boggling.
“What brought that on?” Harry is a little confused, as Al had been adamant that no one else knew.
James’ eyes widen. “I knew Aunt Hermione was wicked smart, but I didn’t realise you were, too. No offence!”
“I just wasn’t sure if you returned the affection, or if you were even ready for that kind of relationship right now.” Draco seems hesitant again. “I didn’t want to be pushy.”
Harry shakes his head.
“I never imagined life could even look like this.” Harry looks down at their son again. “I never thought I could be this in love, or get pregnant and have a son with my wonderful husband. I’m happier than I’ve ever been. It was a long road to get here, but I wouldn’t trade our life for the world, Draco. This last year has had trials, but it’s been wonderful. I love you so much.”
Harry sucks Draco back down and deep. He’s so turned on he can barely think straight and all there is in the world is his mouth and Draco’s cock; hollowed cheeks, and rough tongue, and moaning against hard flesh, and writhing hips, and Harry’s name falling from perfect pink lips.
Harry fidgets, wringing his hands. “I…I…yeah…yeah, I’m fine. I just…don’t know where to go from here.”
“Do people actually like that?” Draco sounds slightly aghast.
“We probably need to put his mobile on our plan, as well. I’m not sure if his parents will cancel it in anger.”
“It seems like so much longer and just yesterday, all at the same time.”
“We could take all the kids out to dinner one night, perhaps?”
“Not at the moment. I’m just getting some pain from starting to carry the weight out front. Just part of being pregnant.” Harry shrugs. “What’s on your mind?”
Draco begins writhing beneath him as Harry takes him deeper, hollows his cheeks, increases the pace. Suddenly there's a hand in his hair gripping his wild curls, and Harry moans around Draco's cock, moving even faster.
Harry waves his hand to bring up the lights as Draco reaches for his jumper, preparing to put it on. Suddenly, the indecision Harry had been battling vanishes, and he knows what he wants. He reaches over and pulls Draco’s hand away from his jumper. A confused look crosses Draco’s face and Harry cups his cheek gently and kisses him.
“Me, too.” Draco kisses the top of Harry’s head. “I love you. Let’s get some sleep.”
Harry finally turns himself around in Draco’s arms. Still laughing, he looks at Draco’s red face and sparkling eyes and worms his arm up between them, holding the fluttering Snitch tightly in his hand.
Harry shoots him a look and they both laugh. “Is there anything I can do for the pain and discomfort?”
“Of myself, I freely give.”
Harry is sitting on Draco’s couch tapping out a text to Hermione when he hears Draco come down the stairs. Looking up, he takes a moment to rake his eyes over Draco’s handsome form. He’s dressed impeccably as always, in charcoal tailored trousers and a cornflower blue dress shirt.
“Tonight. They said I’m not—“ He dissolves into sobs again, and it takes several moments before he can form words. “— not welcome here.”
“Popcorn. Maybe some fruit. Matthew likes sweet stuff more than salty. Do we have any pretzels?”
“Did you…cook?” Harry can’t keep the surprise from his voice. Draco
And while he is in no hurry to become a grandparent, he, too, hopes James and Matthew can find the same happiness he and Draco have found — someday, together or with someone else.
“Yes.”
as they want you to be.”
“There you go. It’ll open to your touch now.” Harry watches Draco reach for the handle and open his locker. “I didn’t realise you supported Puddlemere.”
“I know.” Harry turns his mouth against Draco’s ear. “I can’t believe your son is growing inside me.”
“Eight! Seven!”
“That sounds perfect.” Harry kisses Draco quickly and heads for the stairs.
“All right, what’s going on?” Draco looks sceptically at his son, who turns immediately red. “Out with it.”
“How are things going?”
Once the dishes are cleared from their meal, Harry looks steadily at all five kids.
Harry smiles. “We certainly would have planned this better if we had known.”
!” Harry’s thankful for Draco’s supporting hand as Hermione nearly knocks him backwards with another, much tighter hug. He chuckles and eases back.
Nonsense begins falling from Draco’s mouth, and his swelling cock is brushing against Harry’s arm.
“What happened?”
Hermione looks quite astonished as she digests that bit of information. “That certainly sounds like he might be interested.”
Harry removes the rolled message and feeds Pyxis several treats before she makes her way to the owl perch. “Waiting for an answer, are you?” Harry leans over the kitchen table, spreading the parchment to read.
“Still ok?”
“I’ll be fine in about another six and a half months.” Harry can’t help but smile at Draco, anticipating the baby that will arrive then.
Harry loses his composure completely at that and what escapes can’t be called anything but a fit of the giggles.
wrong?” The terror in Al’s voice rips at Harry’s heart. Harry makes a mental note to talk to Draco about finding a Mind Healer for Albus. His anxiety is getting worse, not better, and Harry loathes to think his son feels like this all the time.
Harry nods. “You go on, and I’ll be along in a few minutes.” He kisses Draco quickly. “Love you.”
“That’s really not enough time to plan a wedding.”
“As have I.” Draco’s voice sounds reassuring.
“Are you quite comfortable?” Draco teases, finishing his apple. His lips are damp with the juice, and Harry would very much enjoy kissing it off.
“Harry?” Draco squeezes his hip. “Are you even listening to me?”
“I told you it wasn’t an emergency, James.”
consent to something, you are allowed to change your mind at
with Draco, for the rest of his days.
“I’m not sure that I am, but let’s see it anyway,” Draco sighs.
Draco laughs softly. “Absolutely nothing we’ve done in the bedroom…or, er, anywhere else…has been bad from my end. Merlin, especially that morning on the kitchen table. That was fantastic.”
“Mr Potter, how are you feeling?”
Draco’s eyes say so much and Harry is getting better at interpreting their silvery depths. Tonight, he sees contentment and affection, but also desire. Harry’s own desire pools low in his belly as he approaches Draco. And then he’s wrapped in those familiar arms and twining his own against a muscular back and they’re moving gently to the music. It’s not quite dancing, more just holding each other close and swaying slightly, but Harry finds he likes it very much.
“Sometimes it just doesn’t feel right.” Hermione is trying to keep her voice matter-of-fact, but Harry hears the underlying pang of sadness. Harry’s heart aches for the woman who’s like a sister to him.
“When??”
“It’s all right, Harry.” Draco strokes Harry slowly, bringing him to full hardness. “I know you’re tired. I’ll take care of both of us.”
“Fair enough.”
“Of course.” Draco kisses his forehead softly. “I’m going to go get the kids ready and we’ll all come in before we go, okay?”
Draco withdraws obligingly, for a moment leaving Harry achingly empty again. Harry whimpers at the loss, shivering as he feels the wide, blunt head of the dildo prodding at his entrance.
“Yeah?”
“Yes.” Harry wants him to stay tonight and any night after. He doesn’t know exactly what that means, yet… But at least he can have Draco tonight.
Harry feels Draco’s cool hand on his neck. He’s finally able to calm his stomach enough to slump against the seat, and he groans softly. He’s still just as nauseous as he was when he was jolted awake by the intense need to vomit.
Harry laughs. “Yeah. Let’s rinse off? I don’t really want to have this chat in the shower.” Harry takes in the uncertain look in Draco’s face.
Draco kisses Harry softly. “Six weeks today. I still can’t believe I’m lucky enough to have a baby with you.”
. Done properly, you should feel it wash through you. It makes your body a hostile environment for conception. It lasts for about four hours.”
Harry winces as he opens his eyes sometime later to see James perched on the edge of the tub.
“Tomorrow night?”
“I think so. Do you want to Floo the Headmistress?”
Harry is certain his heart will burst from the affection he feels for Draco in this moment. He’s sure he’s never loved anyone the way he loves Draco, even Ginny.
“Me, too.” Draco lips twist into a satisfied smile.
“Absolutely,” Harry nods. “We’re very open about pretty much everything in this family, so if James wants to learn, that’s fine.”
Draco silences Harry with a quick peck on the lips.
“Harry?” Draco’s voice is dripping with desire. Harry bites back a moan so he can answer.
“Look. I’m part of a team studying the long-term effects of childhood Dark Magic exposure. One of our findings is spontaneous haemorrhage of the magical core when it’s under strain as an adult.” Harry watches Powell’s eyebrows raise into his hairline.
“Hopefully not overly so.” Harry is hoping the news goes over well with the kids. Press be damned; nothing ever goes over well with them. “How is your daughter getting by at Hogwarts?”
“Hello, Gemma,” Draco greets the young witch sitting at the receptionist desk. “I have Mr Potter here to meet with Mr Mason.” Gemma looks up at Harry and he suddenly feels very exposed with the way she is looking at him. It’s not unfriendly, just very scrutinising. Gemma looks back up to his face and smiles.
“You’re not. I’m very much attracted to you, as well.”
“Mr Potter! Are you pregnant?”
Before he can regain some control of his gut, he hears footsteps return. Harry hears, rather than sees, Draco settle on the bathroom floor beside him.
“Do you suppose we should just wait for her to notice the rings?” Draco muses as they pull on some clothes.
“Sorry. That just hit me sort of hard.”
Plates filled, the kids sprawl in the living room and opt to watch a movie while they eat. Harry is thankful the kids all seem to be rolling with the changes that keep coming at them. There’s still a lot to figure out, but for him and for Draco, there was never any other option than to take care of Matthew the best they can. The question is what, exactly, that’s going to look like.
“I love you, too.”
Harry’s skin lights on fire as Draco eases him onto his back and trails a hand down his chest and to the front of his pants. Draco dips a finger into the waistband and looks into Harry’s eyes.
“Phew. Ok.” Lily pauses, fidgeting. Harry looks down at her face, mouth twisted in a contemplative expression, and can tell she has more she wants to ask.
Just as he’s about to push himself out of bed, the door swings open. Draco, looking just a bit traumatised, closes the door and leans against it.
Harry feels his throat tighten and he takes a shuddering breath. His legs feel like lead and his stride falters. He is aware he’s falling behind Draco but his voice is stuck somewhere in his throat and he can’t say anything.
Harry takes a mental inventory of the people gathering around them. He doesn’t want a crowd to gather before they get a chance to sit down. He’d like to at least enjoy brunch before people decide to become obtrusive.
“Harry?” Draco’s voice is thick with sleep. “What time is it?”
“It could be. Is the pressure more towards the front or the back of your pelvis?”
“Someplace upscale, then.” Draco sighs contemptuously. “You’d think wealthy people have more to do than gossip, but they can never get enough of it.”
Draco offers his arm and Harry takes it. Together they walk to the doors and pause.
“Nope. It’s in my jacket pocket, on silent.” Harry pats his jacket pocket.
Slowly, Harry sucks Draco down until he can’t take any more before pressing his tongue against Draco’s underside and slowly pulling back off. He allows the tip to pop from his mouth and he looks back up to watch the other man’s expression; Draco’s head is thrown back and he’s bunching the sheets in his fists.
Harry sits at a table tucked in the corner of a Muggle coffee shop just outside King’s Cross. He can’t understand what on earth had possessed Draco Malfoy to invite him for tea, nor can he discern what had made him think accepting the invitation was a good idea. But here he is. In a Muggle coffee shop. Waiting for Draco Malfoy.
Healer Powell continues to look confused. Harry heaves an impatient sigh. If he’s right, the increased nausea and fatigue are signs his own core is not going to hold out much longer.
“Will you stay tonight? Please?”
If Harry thought he was tired Friday, he was completely mistaken. By lunch on Sunday, Friday looks positively energetic. He chalks it up to a very emotionally taxing weekend and, unfortunately, it’s not over yet. He looks at Albus who is settled at the end of Harry and Draco’s bed while Harry leans against the headboard. Talking to Al about his anxiety almost always ends up with an emotional outburst.
“Of myself, I freely give.”
Scorpius is saved from further interrogation by the return of a red-eyed James.
“Okay,” Healer Carr moves beside Harry’s hips. “We’ll do some imaging to take measurements and check your birth canal development today. Do you have a preference for which first?”
“Did you see a Healer?”
“Are you all right?” Draco appears nearly instantly at the door.
. I haven’t seen any of these.” Flipping them over, Draco begins to read the backs.
Draco’s body is strung tight as a drum and the filthy sounds he’s making…Harry’s pretty sure he will never hear anything more erotic than what is currently coming out of Draco’s mouth. Harry twists his wrist at the top of his next tug on Draco’s cock and then Draco’s cumming all over the table in thick ropes. Draco collapses onto the table, panting.
Draco clears his throat and looks away from Harry. “So,” he says with a bright tone that sounds just a little forced, “what movie are we going to watch?”
“Well, you’re happy now, and I plan to make sure you stay that way. You can’t go back and fix the past, but we can make sure things are better moving forward.”
“Just after ten.” Harry feels Draco shift and then there’s a hand carding through his hair. “I figured since it’s the start of our 4-day weekend, you could finally get some of that sleep you need.”
“This is white gold. It can also be done in platinum or yellow gold.”
sound like something that would appeal to me.” Harry exhales heavily. “It just seems to have a more personal meaning, as well.”
At least it’s an easy one to start with.
want this to go well, you know?”
“I know exactly what you two get up to, but I could have done without the visual.”
He rocks softly back and forth in an attempt to distract himself from the frustration of it all.
Fingers slide out and Harry gladly lowers his knee.
! Thank you for letting me stay!”
“What’s after that, then?” James asks.
Shock springs to Malfoy’s features. “I apologise if that wasn’t appropriate to ask,” he stammers quickly. “I just assumed…”
“Well, I’m not as nervous, but now I’ve got a different problem.”
closeted then, but as soon as I got away from the Noseless Bastard and my parents, I was able to freely be who I am.” Malfoy pauses, taking a sip of tea and regarding Harry with a bit of trepidation. “Do you have a problem with homosexuality, Potter?”
“I’m sure we can figure that out,” Hermione says almost dismissively. “How was the movie?”
James heaves a big sigh.
“Orgasms are safe, provided they’re given in a manner that coincides with the other guidelines. The male womb doesn’t contract as the uterus does with the hormones associated with climax.”
A knock at the bedroom door startles them both, but a quick glance at the clock tells Harry that his afternoon has gone quicker than he realised. James had come to keep him company while he laid down, and it had turned into a study session.
“Dad?” James’ voice comes through the door.
“Help yourself. Would you like pumpkin juice?” Harry asks, taking a seat across from her.
“Where do you want to go for dinner?” Draco shifts the subject gently, sensing correctly that Harry would rather not dwell on the job situation. “We should probably try to Floo for a table.”
“The first time I reacquaint myself with Granger as your partner should probably not be in flagrante.”
“Yes, Dad,” James smiles. “We’re not having sex, you know.”
Harry takes a deep breath and waves his wand hand, cleaning himself and then adding a freshening charm for good measure.
Harry feels the cool metal of the platinum band slide onto his finger, but he has eyes only for the man placing it there.
“I hate seeing you like this.”
name, then.”
He feels the bed shift and he’s being pulled in close to Draco’s chest. Draco kisses the top of his head.
“Yeah. I was up late,” Scorpius shrugs. Albus giggles.
“Could you?” Draco replies eagerly.
“I’ve had a few partners since Astoria left. No one in the last several years, and certainly no one serious enough to introduce to Scorpius.” Draco’s hand skates across Harry’s skin affectionately as he speaks. “He is aware that I’m gay, but he’s never known me to be in a relationship. So it’s been quite a while since I’ve had a partner, as well.”
Slow, slick, and maddening, Draco’s finger slides in deeper, exploring his insides, and as the finger crooks, Harry cries out.
Draco obliges and, as he steps around the door, Harry sees what he’s holding. Draco offers three roses to Harry; one orange, one lavender, and one white, tied together with a simple silver bow.
“Harry, you can’t just do that when I’m about to beat you to the Snitch!”
“It’s been on my mind, and I thought that urge would go away, but instead it just keeps getting stronger.” He kisses those perfect pink lips softly. “I love you. I want to be bonded to you before Regulus is born. I want to be your husband when I birth our son.”
“Of course.” Harry listens to the rhythm of Draco’s heart as he gathers his thoughts for a moment. “Ok. I enjoy kisses and cuddling pretty much any time. Even in public, I don’t mind appropriate open affection. It’s also great in the bedroom. With as few clothes as possible, usually.” Harry feels Draco laugh beneath his head.
alarm.
They pull apart, not looking away from each other until they both turn to Hermione and nod. She throws her arms around each of them in turn.
The absolute sarcasm dripping from Draco’s voice makes Harry laugh darkly.
Draco moans softly in reply. “Do you want to go over to the bed?”
“You do have to understand that neither of these methods is perfect.” Draco is emphatic. “You still run the risk of getting pregnant if you’re having penetrative sex.”
Draco releases his hand and Harry turns and follows Gemma down the hall, heart racing, but no longer from nerves.
His exasperated tone clearly has no impact, because Hermione’s eyes are dancing with mirth. “For someone so open about…well…everything, you’re acting awfully shy about this. It’s amusing!”
“Yes, son?”
“You deserve it. You really do.” Draco leans his head forward and rests his chin on Harry’s shoulder, mouth by Harry’s ear. “I had to work so hard to get to where I am, to make up for all the horrible things I did as a teenager and to dull the awful stain my father put on our name. I
“It is.” Harry wonders if Draco can feel the absolute love and contentment radiating through him. “I thought maybe I’d never have
“Ok, so I was really worried,” Al concedes, “but things are good now.”
Harry’s pouring through takeaway menus at the kitchen counter when the Floo chimes, announcing Hermione’s imminent arrival.
“Help your dad down, would you? It really wouldn’t do to have him stumble right now.”
“I have no idea where I would have picked up a bug, but clearly I’ve gotten something.”
Matthew nods slowly, seeming to understand. “It’s just not what I’m used to from parents.”
Draco helps him from the tub and he dresses in a long nightgown with nothing underneath. It’s yet another thing that makes him feel ridiculous, but all his books recommend such attire for labour when, as one book put it, ’it feels like someone wants to stick a finger in every five minutes.’ Together, they make their way downstairs.
“What happened?”
“I want nothing more than to climb into bed with you, but I desperately need a real shower.”
“I will never turn down good pizza. And FlooFood even delivers from there.”
Lily’s words hit Harry like a punch to the gut. Had he really been that unhappy before? He made a mental note to ask Hermione later. He hadn’t meant to worry the kids, but there's no denying he’s much happier with Draco than he's been in a long time.
“I’m scared.”
One eye opens and suddenly Draco is suppressing a laugh. Harry fleetingly wonders what he finds funny as he rolls his hips experimentally. When he feels a rush of pleasure and no pain, he nods.
Harry pulls out his mobile and debates sending Draco a text. Deciding to unwind a bit first, he heaves himself off the couch and heads up to change out of his work clothes. He pulls out soft black joggers and a T-shirt before stripping out of his dress shirt and trousers. He’s just debating having a wank while thinking about Draco — his new favourite way to cum — when his mobile buzzes on the bed.
Harry swirls his tongue around the head and Draco moans again. Wrapping one hand around the base, Harry licks the tip before placing his lips right over Draco’s slit and slowly sucking the head into his mouth.
“Fuck, Draco.”
He’s not sure how much time has passed before he opens his eyes and sees terrified silver eyes wet with tears staring back.
James immediately rounds on his dad. “That was
“The two best Curse-Breakers at the Center for Rare Magical Maladies. As well as my notes on cases like this, and a core-binding potion that will allow them to bind my core to lift the curses.”
“How should we tell the kids?” Harry asks, smiling in anticipation of their reactions.
“Yes. Both my biological sons are carriers.” Harry stumbles over his words as he tries to process what he’s being told. “We were told it came from the Weasley side of their genetics. Almost all of the males in the family are carriers.”
“Yeah,” Matthew hiccups.
He lets his mind wander to what he can remember of the dream he’d suddenly been pulled from. He and Draco, in bed, naked and sweaty. Draco’s hand wrapped around him. Draco’s fingers…
“I’m pregnant, Lil. Draco and I are having a baby.”
Healer Carr waves her wand and packs up her medical bag.
“Our children are exhausting. I don’t remember the last time I was this exhausted.”
“No!”
“I won’t know until they let me see the fucking imaging.” Harry turns back to the Healer. “I work with core imaging. Specifically, cores of people exposed to Dark Magic as children and the long-term effects.”
Draco’s hand squeezes his hip gently, and he snuggles into his husband’s side.
. He lays a hand over his swollen belly and feels it again. It feels very much like a tiny fish is flopping about.
“Draco, I don’t understand.” Lily’s brow is furrowed as her eleven-year-old brain tries to process this information.
“Oh Harry, you look wonderful. Let me send James up to help you down the stairs.” Hermione turns and calls for James, who appears in his own dress robes at the bottom of the stairs.
His womb appears in the bubble and his whole body goes limp as the last of his anxiety abates. There, bouncing around, is their baby. Tiny arms and legs are moving. Harry feels a bit ridiculous as tears fall, but when he pulls his eyes away from that beautiful image to look at Draco, he finds he’s not the only one crying.
As Draco draws Harry’s shirt up, Harry’s arms raise automatically. He eases the neckline over Harry’s glasses, off his arms, and lets it fall gently to the floor. His soft hands run down the hard planes of Harry’s chest and over his stomach before he leans in and kisses him tenderly.
“I’m fine.” Harry can’t help but smile and roll his eyes. “But would you spell the knife to cut the onions for me? I’m afraid the smell would do me in if I was in the room.”
“That’s what I don’t know,” Harry says, wincing when he’s unable to hide the weariness in his voice. “I wish I knew. It’s all I’ve thought about since last night and—
“Merlin, I’m glad I’m straight.”
Harry pauses as Lily’s other observation comes to the forefront of his memory. It must be obvious on his face because Draco looks concerned.
“Yes. Much, actually. The idea you had about strengthening the lighter magic with extra lacewing while simultaneously suppressing the malevolent made a big difference. It’s not a solution but it was a step forward.” Draco steps into the Apparition area and offers his arm to Harry. “Side-Along?”
“There’s a gigantic owl down here and it won’t let any of us take the letter. It’s mean! It bit James and he’s bleeding!”
Bernice heads in the direction of the service counter and Harry turns his head to kiss Draco swiftly.
positively terrified.” Draco’s eyes hold a sadness Harry doesn’t recognise. But he’s never been rejected for his sexuality the way Draco has and the way Matthew fears, so he knows he can’t possibly truly understand.
“You can also do plenty of things beforehand. We talked about fingers for stretching when we talked about sex before.” Harry waits for James to nod in acknowledgement. “You can also use toys specially made for anal penetration.” James looks mortified at the mention of penetration.
He lowers the phone and presses the speaker button. The sound of sobbing fills the kitchen and Harry wraps an arm around his son, who has joined his boyfriend in crying.
“I was content, though,” Draco continued, “with Scorpius and me. I did date a little, but it was when Scorpius was young and I was still closely associated with my father in the wizarding world, so it was only Muggles I met at the pub or elsewhere in town. There was never going to be anything serious there, and I really thought I was ok with it.”
“Yeah.” James looks at Harry’s stomach and then back to his face. “How does it feel to be pregnant?”
The return of control reaches his lips.
“I’m right here, love, I won’t leave you alone even for a moment.” Draco immediately drops his leg and pulls Harry into his chest.
“They’d never believe it,” Harry says, far more huskily than he intends. He lets his vision linger on Draco, hesitant to break this moment that he doesn’t quite know how to interpret.
“I’d like to.” Harry does want to tell Hermione, but he also doesn’t want to make Draco uncomfortable. “She already knows we’re dating. She’ll ask how it’s going. And I can trust her.”
“I’d rather we get you what you want and need so we know it’s from somewhere reputable and safe, James,” Harry explains carefully. “Or at the very least, help you buy things your first few times so you can learn. I don’t need to know what you do with them and when. I’m
