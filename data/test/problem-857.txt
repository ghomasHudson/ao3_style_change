“These look good on you,” Harry says, stroking the Gryffindor crest, voice thick with affection. “My protector.”
“We will.” Draco’s stomach growled. “Starting with you making me some lunch. I’m famished. I’ll have you know I’m eating for four now!”
Draco feels bile rising in his throat. "For the so-called sin of acting on a mutual attraction, they deserved to die, or be locked up for life?"
, he thought. He loved Draco, he really did. But it honestly felt as though he couldn't put a foot right since the moment he'd arrived. And Draco hadn't helped things, siding with that uppity kettle and sneering at poor Mrs Potts.
ridiculous.”
Despite Harry's best intentions to apologise and smooth the waters, Draco's lack of concern for Mrs Potts sent the whole thing bubbling over again; both of them spitting insults at each other and their treasured tea-making equipment.
He cautiously addressed the shimmering whippet, “I need you to bring a message to Harry Potter,” and the dog stopped spinning in circles and padded over to him, nudging his nose at Draco’s hand, and then looking up at him expectantly.
"Sorry to interrupt, Pans," Draco said. He wasn't sorry, not at all. He couldn't bear the thought of a horde of people coming over and cooing at his tummy. "I'd better see who this is from."
So, given this, it was most perplexing that they had now, by Harry's count, gone a whole four hours without speaking one civil word to one another, and he was finding himself secretly plotting ways to dispose of one of Draco's most beloved possessions. And all only two days after he'd moved in.
Draco thinks.
the aftereffects of the curse, but Draco can't make sense of it now. It's impossible to hear his brain work above the primal roar of his body.
At the next antenatal class Draco arrived early and sidled right up to Potter, who was chatting to Jericho and Laurence . He was feeling on top of the world, and actually enjoyed chit-chatting, finding Jericho's story about his past partner really moving and even having to blink away a tear. Potter was brilliant, and so understanding and soft with Jericho, and Draco had a little realisation, right there in the classroom, while Fordus was dinging his triangle, and people were moving to take their seats, that he properly liked Potter now. A lot. And that for the first time in eight long months he was daring to think about a future that might
“It’s a surprise,” Draco said. Harry scrunched his nose up at that, and Draco kissed it lightly. He couldn’t have Harry accidentally blasting the awning off a stall in annoyance. “We have an anniversary coming up next week, or have you forgotten? Two years.”
But, year by year, Harry began to gradually come around. He would come home from his trip to Godric’s Hollow and put his costume on, with the requisite grumbling as Draco did the final fitting and adjustments. In fact, Harry almost seemed to enjoy dressing up as the Mad Hatter that one year, even twirling Draco to the music at Blaise and Charlie's afternoon party, complimenting him on his long March Hare ears and teeth and whiskers, and Teddy in his Cheshire cat costume smiled extra wide to see it. But Harry's smiles that evening never reached his eyes, and Draco could see the pain still lingered.
. It's nothing to be embarrassed about. We're both men and we know the, ahm, libido works in mysterious ways. Your body is relaxing, possibly for the first time in a while, and it's allowing blood to flow freely wherever it wants to go. If you don't wish to continue, I understand, though I feel there's more benefit to be gained in continuing. The loosening of your muscles in this short time is palpable. It certainly seems some time since you've had proper stimulation, so..."
, as the potion’s effects started to hit harder, the idea that Malfoy was someone he had hated made him feel sick; it was of utmost importance that Malfoy should know he was loved, so loved, that he was forgiven.
There was a stutter of a moment where the masseur's breath went a little odd, and then he was squeezing the meat of Harry's thighs, a little harshly Harry thought. Harry bit back a bone-deep groan, and tried his damnedest to keep his back from arching, and then the man's hands were retreating. Harry took another breath. He heard the clink of glass, and after a moment he felt freshly-oiled hands slippery on his calves, and he was almost dizzy with how good it felt. The scents of the oils combined with the the sliding pressure along his legs was intoxicating and undeniably arousing, and if he was honest the masseur's voice was sort of sexy too—

"Nice right hook, mate." Potter says and then whistles. "And it seems our friend didn't count on the anti-Apparition wards you cast. Good move on your part, I have to say."
"Nothing, Potter. Forget about it."
And speaking of touching, Draco thinks, as he trails his fingers over Potter's thigh, "You know, I almost miss the little electric shocks. They were quite... exciting."
"Ahh," smiled Harry. "I think I know the one you mean. The Wizard of Oz!"
“Didn’t want to have to take the stairs,” Draco replied, returning her smile. “Otherwise I’d have to collapse on a plastic chair in reception, too feeble to tackle the walk home.”
? Would they adopt, foster, or maybe, suggested Draco, they could talk to a Healer about getting tested for male pregnancy.  He’d never forget the look on Harry’s face at that revelation. They really ought to have been taught those things at Hogwarts.
“Sure do,” he said, giving Draco a big and frankly beautiful smile.
Harry couldn't think like that though. Malfoy would sneer and ridicule him if he knew what was running through Harry's mind.
Not only that, Potter had slammed a door in his face when Draco went out of his way to go to the fancy villa complex where he was staying—it was the only one on this side of Denpasar with

The process was lengthy and unpleasant, but eventually drew to a close as Miriam and Finian departed. Finally alone, he and Potter ducked behind a drystone wall and fell into a feverish embrace, both eager for the sweet bliss and relief of skin on skin. After several minutes of sighing into each other's hair, Draco realised he was crouching in sheep droppings, and Potter began grumbling about sitting in a gorse bush, so they bid each other farewell and Apparated home for a weekend of discomfort.

Draco was certain Potter would change his mind once Pansy talked to him. His friend was an expert at persuading people to do what she asked of them; only last week she'd convinced prim Lorena Pertwhistle at number eleven to get an undercut (which rather suited her), and somehow exhorted Frank O'Mara from Azalea Drive to wire her house up with Muggle electricity for free.
"Harry!"
he did; but when Potter coughed softly and smiled at him across the table, he wasn't so sure. Perhaps Potter actually wanted to know, to listen to what Draco had to say—the imploring look on the man's face was damn near irresistible.
Harry grasped Draco's jaw and pressed his mouth against Draco’s lips, and Draco was unable to continue whatever nonsense he was saying.

it'd be the first thing he'd look for. Eight decades of serving Blacks and I'm finally duped by a teapot... Oh, very well, I'll do it."
"I suppose we could hug now and again," Potter offered. "That part wasn't so bad."
“I’ve got you. I’ve got you. Oh honey, are you okay? Come here.” He hoisted Draco back up to standing and helped him into the sitting room and onto the sofa. He was gentle and careful, and Draco felt like a shit telling him to get off and leave him alone. Especially when Gabe said "Shush," and "You're okay," and "I love you, babe," and cradled him like a mother osprey would a wayward chick.

“...and when I went out the back with my cuppa for a spot of morning sun, I noticed it had grown to three times its size. I went for a closer look, and that’s when it lunged at me. I don’t remember much more except for the sound of my favourite Harpies mug smashing on the patio tiles. Bloody loved that mug.”
“Come in,” Draco said, and he called to his team that he’d see them tomorrow. They knew that was their cue to leave. Pineneedle’s eyes were wide when he saw ‘Epicure’ by Draco’s side as he collected his own robes and headed off.
Harry groaned, fixing his glasses.
Draco took as deep a breath as he could and resolved not to let a clearly grumpy Potter ruin his happy mood.
"If the quality of your water is anything like your temperament, I think you'll find—"
"Oh shit. Devil's Snare? He could’ve been..." Draco trailed off, unable to say the word.
, Harry had to keep reminding Draco with a pinch; it was so unbelievable—Draco began making him Halloween costumes. The very first time he spent a whole week in secret making Teddy's costume. On Halloween morning he proudly dressed Teddy up in a new and very much improved version of the Gilbert the Griffin costume he’d adored as a child—the needlework on the wings was certainly better than his childhood attempt—and Draco got so choked up he could barely call out to Harry to
Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry. "And you call my kettle snooty? These teabags are imported from the mountain regions of Tanzania and cost two Galleons a box!"
. But then you’ve read canon, so this will come as no surprise.
“I don’t know. I wanted it to be a surprise.”
"Look at my kitchen!" Draco wailed, "And my hair; it's starting to curl in all this steam! I've had quite enough of both of you. This is ridiculous and childish behaviour! I'm making tea now and you both better behave."
For as long as they'd been together, the public and the press had commented on their relationship using words like ‘unexpected’, or ‘baffling’, or just plain ‘peculiar’. Add to that the fact that they both had 'gifts' that made them stand out as strange or different—Draco's seer ability and Harry's wild magic—and it made them the supreme odd couple.
And he did look incredible. It wasn't the sexy pirate shirt. Or the knee-high heeled boots. Or the velvet and brocade coat. Although all those things were hot as Hades on him. It was the big, genuine smile on his face and the green gleam in his eye. Harry was happy.
he decided on and began mentally chanting the list,
Mrs Potts let out mournful wail. "My beautiful lid is chipped!"
Draco entered the Purge and Dowse shopfront and was greeted by the antiseptic smell of St Mungo’s. He cancelled his glamour charm, and the receptionist directed him to a bright room at the end of a long corridor on the third floor. Inside, there were posters on the walls with pictures of babies, cross-sections of anatomy, and a row of pamphlets hovering near the door with titles like ‘Mer-birthing’ and ‘Baby Legilimency’. Chairs, exercise balls, and large bean bags were arranged in a haphazard semicircle, and in the centre stood a tiny old man with a white beard and even whiter hair that flowed all the way down to his arse. A few other men with baby bumps of varying sizes stood around looking sheepish and uncertain. All were flanked by their partners, some with fingers linked together in solidarity, some with hands placed protectively on shoulders. Draco froze, his heart speeding up for a few moments, before he was distracted by a soft chime.

, I'll give you that. But I'm not sure what's so hilarious about it."
Harry cleared his throat. "Well, it's lovely to meet you! It's actually sort of a coincidence, because..."
"Why is Mrs Potts crying on the dining table?" a curious voice asked.
“So what happened?” Potter asked.
"What are you looking for, Harry?" Draco had paused mid-way through spreading jam on a scone. "You can't honestly tell me you can't find something to eat. There's enough food here to feed a Quidditch team. We'll be eating it for weeks, unless you take it to work, or—"
"Here," he said.
Draco nodded. “It’s fine. Harry and I are having a nice time, but we don’t want you to leave.” Draco reached for Harry’s hand and ran his fingers over Harry’s knuckles. Harry could scarcely believe this was the same Draco Malfoy he'd fought with in school. And it was almost as if Draco could read Harry's mind, because the next thing he said was, “And, incidentally, I quite want to tell you that I regret so much of how I was at Hogwarts. Towards you all.”
Harry recalled that date clearly. Draco had never been to the pictures before, and the adorable cinema on Regent Street was having a technicolour nostalgia night. It was the perfect opportunity to share a secret part of his childhood—something small and personal, something the tell-all books wouldn't know, something just for Draco to know about him and no one else. He'd told Draco how he loved the fantasy of being swept away from his monochrome life to a crazy, colourful world, where it was okay to be a bit different, to be
“Not to worry. Please just… I just need Harry and,”—Draco lowered his voice to a whisper—”
Draco twirls, the blush on his cheeks matching the deep red of the robes. “I’m your protector.”
“No, it’s fine. It's a bit complicated. We just… well, the thing is...” Draco lowered his voice. “Potter walked in on me and my ex having an argument. It was nothing, but he got the wrong idea and thinks we’re getting back together, and he won’t talk to me or let me explain. I think I've bollocksed everything up with him now… and oh Merlin, I’m sorry to offload this on you.”

Harry hadn’t realised he’d been gnawing at his lip until he tasted blood.
He thrashed again, fighting against the invisible restraints binding him. Needle sharp sensations jabbed his armpits, his ribs, his belly, relentless and unforgiving. He was vaguely aware of a discordant clinking, rhythmic and hellish.
“No, I couldn't ask you to do that.”
“Rude. But accurate.”

Draco was in complete shock. Was it the scallops? He knew some people were allergic, and they
There was no drive to outdo each other with wit and one-upmanship; the conversations were to-the-point, with little hesitation or affectation. Harry had never experienced anything like it. The openness and compassion he felt towards his friends. Their simple, clear acceptance of him exactly as he was.

“Let's just get on with it," Draco said, adjusting his position on the large green exercise ball he was sitting on. They'd been short on normal chairs this week, and though Draco found sitting on a large ball rather humiliating, he couldn't deny they were extremely comfortable. He just had to keep alert so he didn't roll off the thing.
Draco was devastated.
Draco told Harry about his parents—about a visit to his father in Azkaban, about his mother's descent into mental ill health and his dilemma and subsequent guilt about having her committed to St Mungo's. He ran through each event and his personal reactions to it unselfconsciously, without any humiliation or awkwardness. Harry felt privileged to listen.

like home.
Draco puts the book down and takes a sip of whisky. As the smooth heat of it warms his throat, he recalls their tea break earlier in the day. Potter had returned to their shared desk with two cups of tea—black for Draco, and milk with three sugars for himself—and biscuits. But not just any biscuits,

"Yeah?" Potter answers.

Potter howls with laughter. Draco is delighted. Not only because he's the one to make this glorious man laugh, but because he's finally within touching distance of getting something he's wanted for a very, very long time.
"We're just trying to exhaust every possible avenue of investigation," Draco says in his best lighthearted voice. "Gather as much evidence as possible for the upcoming trial. You know what the Wizengamot's like; if there's any hole in the case, they'll poke their wands right into it." His chuckle is met by narrow eyes and an obsequious smile.

, and had seemed a good destination to stop for a while. "I like the Australians," he said emphatically. "They're much less interested in 'who I am' and 'how I got here'." He didn't miss Potter's reaction to that statement. Draco hadn't meant it as a dig, but it worked rather well as one, which he was fine about. "As long as I was serving the Aussie tourists alcohol they were happy, and that suited me quite well."
"Yeah," Potter says, a bit shyly, and he draws his knees up to his chest, hugging them. "Actually, have done for a while. Ever since the day we got partnered together, and you brought me a cup of tea just the way I like it. And then sat at our new shared desk and did that stiff awkward apology." He laughs. "You were so prim and starched and buttoned up, and your boots were as shiny as your new badge, and you couldn't look me in the eye. Merlin, I was a smitten idiot. Maybe it even started before that," he muses, "but actually that mainly consisted of drooling over your fit body in training, so it didn't

Teddy was uncharacteristically nervous, but managed to stammer out, “Um. I w-wish you were still alive. And I wish my mum and dad were too, the… the ones that made me. But you’re not and they’re not, and my dads are so amazing, and you should be proud of them.” He looked to Harry for approval, and Harry nodded at him. They both smiled.
from each of them, Draco says, "This way, Potter."
The soft solidity of Draco’s shoulder was nice against his arm, but it made Harry want more, made him want to capture the sunshiny feeling that came from his touches. To touch and feel until he went numb.
"Wait, Potter!" Draco stood.
"Language, dad!" Al chided, covering Harry's mouth with his hand.
They stepped through the barrier, which felt a little like a thin film of oil, and Harry shuddered at the slimy feeling, but then... then he was through, and the unpleasantness evaporated and not only that, he felt lighter and warmer and somehow more... comfortable? It was a familiar feeling that he tried to place but it seemed just beyond the reach of his memory.
Minutes went by and there was no response. A tap dripped rhythmically and he focused on the sounds outside the room to distract himself, identifying which voices were patients and which were Healers. How long should he wait? He couldn't stay in the loos all day. And though he was sort of sure Harry's Patronus would find him if he moved locations, he was worried about risking it.
“Oh, thank you so
Draco felt his feet being gently lifted from their resting place, and opened his eyes a crack, getting a brief glimpse of his swollen toes over his big round belly, before Potter sat himself on the pouffe, nestled Draco’s feet onto his lap and softly started rubbing soothing circles into the aching pads of Draco’s soles. Merlin, it was heavenly.
“Brilliant,” Potter beamed. “I was thinking about—”
Potter eyes crinkled up. “Oh man, where have you been the last five years?”
"Well,
Draco swallowed dryly. 'I've never…'
Draco stood up. “Fine. I think I will.”
"Just… just look after him." She looked close to tears. "Ron and I have been so worried."
"You're Harry Potter," Gabriel said stupidly. "Draco’s wanged on about you enough over the years, ‘that scar, those green eyes, that scruffy hair’. He never mentioned you were fucking-well up the duff too. What the hell?"
"I don't— I can't— I don't know what you want!" Harry racked his brains again trying to remember his movements up to this point.
“Bloody hell, yeah. I felt it. You’ve got a champion dueller in there, I’d say.”
He did glance at Potter momentarily though, and his face heated in shame as he saw sympathy there. Draco grit his teeth to stop the tears of frustration from springing to his eyes. A hand squeezed his forearm—Potter. Draco supposed it was meant as a comforting gesture, but Draco hated it,
rather taken aback at our hostile reception."
Because, in that one instant, his whole world had turned inside out and upside down. He honestly didn't even give a monkey's about the fact that Potter had been as hard as an iron Bludger (though there was a small part of him that was immensely pleased about that), it was just such a solid-gold bolt from the blue to see him. Everything that Draco had carefully bottled up and stoppered tight had rushed up all at once to choke him.

"Gilbert the Griffin's wings, mama, so I may dress up as him!" Gilbert was Draco's favourite storybook character, and Draco was his biggest fan.
. I called him 'Mike' so many times in our first session, and he took such pains to correct me each time, saying his name was 'Michael', and I honestly didn't realise—"
a specific counter-spell is required.
"Harry!" they said, in unison.
He knows all too well how corrosive and dangerous it is—he brewed it himself, after all—but it doesn't stop him greedily bringing his nose to the vial and sucking in deep.
"Let's get started, shall we?" Potter chirped. "Then have a cuppa. I know I tend to just sit and chat and do fuck-all useful if I come in and have tea straight away, so best to leave that ‘til after."
By the time Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby has solved the case, they’ve both slumped a bit more on the sofa and Potter's fingertips are now touching Draco's hair, just lightly enough that Draco's not sure Potter even realises. But when he feels Potter's fingers moving slowly, stroking his hair gently, he knows it's intentional. They

and slowly, carefully moved the body towards the kitchens. “Potter, can you get the door for me?”
"Alright, fine. Give me a second." And of course he stands then and turns, and Draco is treated to a fine view of Potter's crack and the swell of his balls as he bends to retrieve his underwear. Draco's on the back foot now, his eyes zooming in on the dark pucker of Potter, and entirely forgetting what in the name of Merlin and Morgana he was even fire-calling about.

“Er, no, it’s fine, I just haven't been here before.” He began looking across the crowd for Luna and Ginny.
," said Lily. "The Wizard. Of. OZ!" punctuating her words with shakes of her tambourine.
The use of his first name by Potter barely registered with Draco as he summoned the capacity to continue. He couldn't let his emotions best him. He took a sip from his drink and then a fortifying breath.
Harry spluttered incoherently, getting tea down his shirt, and Draco's knife clattered noisily to the table. Mrs Potts let a whistle of glee out of her airhole, and her lid rattled merrily. A croaky laugh from the other side of the table told him Kreacher was rather enjoying Hestia's suggestion too.

“Right, yeah.” Potter let go of his hand, and clutched his elbow instead, directing him to a comfy chair. “Probably the exertion. Sit here and I’ll get some tea on.”
“Actually, I have a set of dragon cufflinks that almost match it exactly. I could lend them to you.”
Malfoy had reviewed Hermione's itinerary and folder and culled it significantly, gleefully putting red lines through all her 'tourist trap nonsense' with a red biro, cross-referencing it with his own recommendations and setting out some loose plans at 'a much more relaxed pace'.
“What you mean?”
Draco watched Harry's face crumple even further, and then Harry got up from his seat and gathered James up in his arms.
The Magister raises an eyebrow and ponders a moment. "Transferred to both of you? How interesting. The curse should only affect those who are already highly attracted to one another." This elicits another gasp from Jeffrey.
De-stress.
“Your skin. It’s sort of dewy, and... oh fuck off!” Draco scowled at Potter’s amused reaction.
The day Teddy and Mr Gnome came to live with them permanently was the day Harry confessed to Draco that he'd always wanted kids. They'd only been together for a little less than a year, but it felt right, and they began having whispered discussions right away about
Then he puts a hand on Potter's wrist. There's no zap or tingle but it feels good all the same to touch his warm skin, feel the bones and muscle shift as Potter relaxes his grip on his wand. "Give me a hand with

“Well, yes. I’ve read the stories. There was mention of… a cupboard? That was an exaggeration by Rita Skeeter, though, surely.”
"A lovable nightmare?" Harry ventured.
Harry decided to take a chance, and reach out with his thumb to roll it over Malfoy's bottom lip. He wanted to know how soft they were. "I- I really want to kiss you."
Draco leapt on that, eager for Harry to forget the mysterious gift he'd stowed in his pocket. But even as he teased Harry for clues, in the back of his mind Draco was busy planning the perfect way—something unexpected, different,

You know the type. The ones that hold regular village fêtes involving homemade marmalade stalls, a hoopla and a coconut shy, and events such as pumpkin-tossing, flobberworm-racing and broom rides for little kids. And of course, yards and yards of pastel-coloured floral bunting. The sort of village with a tight-knit community where everyone knows your business, and if they don't you'll be regarded with high suspicion. The type of place with a strong pride in its local small businesses, and where if you can't buy a thing in Abbott's Ironmongers, well, it just isn't a thing worth having.

Draco hadn't even realised the drinks had arrived, he'd been so lost in thought.
"Potter!" Malfoy's voice cut in, sharp and haughty, just like he'd been at Hogwarts, and Harry wondered how in Godric's name he hadn't instantly known it was Malfoy. He was definitely losing his touch; his so-called 'skills' seemed to have fled once the plane touched down (or perhaps it was due to an entirely different sort of

“‘Going crazy’ implies you weren’t already crazy to begin with,” Potter said. “Listen Malfoy, I’m not taking a day off to take care of a few shrubs and a lawn. The only reason it’s bothering you so much is because you’re obsessed with winning this ridiculous contest, and I just don’t think that’s healthy. Look at you.”
Magister Placid looks perplexed but nods. Draco approaches the framed painting of the Maiden, Mother and Crone, and delicately removes it from its hook.
He loved the darkness. Embraced it. Always chasing the high of the final battle in the dirtiest of alleys, the dingiest of parties and the arms of the coldest strangers.

curious to see where the Golden Boy of the wizarding world lived. He imagined it would be a cross between student digs and the Gryffindor common room.
And the sudden painful shock felt like a heart attack.
Harry hissed under the cool touch of firm, oily hands on his skin. A sweet and woody fragrance drifted into his nostrils and filled his lungs. Vaguely familiar, calming, relaxing, and Harry exhaled a long breath as skilful hands worked a gentle figure-of-eight pattern—from his spine upward and out to the tip of his shoulder and back under to repeat on the other side.

"You have a right to fuck-all when it comes to me. You left! I told you I was having your baby and you left. So I'm sorry, but you do not get to swan in months later and have me back.” Draco was shaking, but managed to walk to the hall. Gabriel followed. “I shall inform you when the baby is born, and we can make arrangements for visits and all that. But I neither want nor need you around."

They question her about the curse, and she looks terrified. "It wasn't me!" she insists. "It was... it affected both Trista and me. We... we..." She lets out a loud sob and puts her face in her hands.

time Harry spent hunched over paperwork at his desk. Harry held his breath when the masseur's fingers pushed slowly through a knot and let it out heavily when his slick, warm hands stroked down Harry's flanks to his waist.
Some time later, Pineneedle walked back into the kitchen, a huge grin on his face. “Epicure ordered the steak, medium rare. His partner ordered the risotto.”
” he said, clear as a bell, and opened his eyes. He looked at Potter, who had a bright false smile on his face.
Harry felt good, so good, and he wanted to tell Draco, but what came out of his mouth surprised even him. "Unngh, Draco, I think I could come just from you rubbing my back."
"Well..." Potter waves his arms around. "It doesn't matter if I am. It doesn't make a blind bit of difference. Because
Upset, she threw them on the ground, but Harry crouched down to her level, picked them all up and said to her, “It’s alright, love,” whispering, “

Harry chanced a look at Draco, who scowled back at him and sipped his tea aggressively.

He was so in awe of the fact that he’d managed it, and so transfixed watching it scamper about playfully, that he almost forgot what he was doing it for.
“It’s not stupid! I just want us to win, and you’re keeping me from doing that with your garden looking like a pixie’s nest,” Draco said, at the end of his patience. “That fucking tosser Goldstein managed to get on the judging panel again—Merlin knows how!—and I will not have him casting aspersions upon our… our…”
“Shit. It’s okay Draco. I get it.” Harry grimaces.
Taking a deep breath, he called up a third memory—a gorgeous day in Diagon Alley, sweeping from shop to shop, Mother buying him only the best. He'd been certain he'd be the most popular boy in Hogwarts, and spent the day picking out all sorts of beautiful items as befitted such a princely status, from high-quality quills, ink and parchment, to a copper cauldron and weighing scales, to robes in the most luxurious fabric with built-in cleaning charms. The afternoon had ended splendidly too, with a triple fudge sundae at Fortescue’s, with the chocolate sauce on the side, of course, just as he liked it.
“She’d been training all day with the Harpies, it was a pretty warm day. And after, she got changed at the club and came straight to the restaurant. A glass of wine and she was feeling a bit dizzy, so she went to splash her face in the loos. She said she felt a bit better, but after another few sips of wine she just collapsed.” Potter removed his hand from Draco’s shoulder and waved it about. “The Healers said it was extreme dehydration and something about electrolytes. A good dose of rehydrating potion and some rest, and she was right as rain again.”
"Have a good night, honey," Ismaya called back to him. "Try to have fun without me!" he added, blowing a kiss. He was a flirty lad, always calling Draco 'honey' or 'sexy,' but Draco knew it was just friendly familiarity and that there was certainly nothing in it. He'd heard him saying the same to all the patrons young and old, be they man, woman or otherwise.
“Quite… quite alright, thanks.”

Harry’s voice lowered to a whisper. "But we'll all be good to each other, okay?"
He let Potter in, and Draco hadn’t even managed to lead him to the kitchen before Potter was apologising and insisting that Draco was right to say what he thought, and that he actually appreciated Draco’s honesty, and that he
Draco rushed to the bedside and grasped Harry’s limp hand. He struggled to form thoughts and turned to the matron. “W-what happened? Is he… Will he wake up? What about the baby?”
Draco was left to stare at him open-mouthed. Potter was not Epicure? How was that even possible? Pineneedle had been so sure.
pushing energy through his fingers as he did so. The case made a clicking noise, and when Harry tried the zip it opened easily. Thank fuck.
"I'm sorry!" Harry rushed to say, and turned to face Draco. But Draco didn't look horrified. Anything but. His hooded eyes and parted lips told a different story.

he can still call him Draco. As he zips up his bomber jacket, he just hopes Draco wasn’t having him on.
The idea hangs in the air for a second or two. Something's burning and stinging that isn't Draco's skin. He thinks it might be his eyes. "Yes," he says. "But not that food van again. It gave me terrible wind."
"I c-can't—," he stammers, but he’s nodding.
“I… well, I wish for my child to have a different upbringing than I had. I want them to be free to do the things they want to do and be the person they want to be. ”
They lie there, sated, content, as their breaths even out and their heart rates attempt to normalise. The solid weight of Potter's body on top of him is grounding.
“I get irritated sometimes with all this parenting advice,” came a voice from Draco’s right. Potter, of course. He could never leave well alone. “At the weekend Neville and Hannah told me how you learn

“No catch. Weren’t you listening, Potter? They’re self-affixing.”
Maybe Potter was trying to trick him.
But if it weren’t for you—
“Oh yeah, of course, he’s a celeb. Although, I’m sure I saw him there a few times.”
"Oh I'm sure you do," Potter winked. “Aubergine’s my favourite. Can’t wait to get my mouth around it.”
Potter slowly slid a hand further up Draco's thigh, almost to the apex. His other hand stroked and up and down Draco’s swollen hip. Potter cocked an eyebrow, "Are you sure you’re okay with me doing this?"
"Is that an offer, Malfoy?" Potter was smirking again. Draco realised he was still holding Potter's wrist.
There are so many good things about being flatmates with Potter.

"If it is, I'll gladly take it," Potter said.
Potter's eyes opened wide. "That sounds… interesting."

"Something's going on outside," Draco said. "There's a table in the garden. I really think we ought to go take a look."
The night before his departure, Harry was beyond ready for this break. Not because he'd had an epiphany of agreement with Healer Rotchburns' recommendation. Not because he'd managed to catch up on the outstanding case reports and notes cluttering his mind and his desk. But because he'd grown sick of the insufferable nuisance that was the '

“Shit.” Harry was breathing heavily, and he stood up, palming his bulge. “If I wasn’t so bloody ungainly I’d have wanked us both at the same time. Wait, I know, put your hand here.” He took Draco’s hand and placed it, palm open, against his crotch. Draco marvelled at how hard he was, and how big, and gave an appreciative squeeze. Harry groaned, and moved forward so that the back of Draco’s hand was against the sofa next to his hip, trapped between maroon upholstery and Harry’s hard-on. Then Harry began grinding into Draco’s palm, and all Draco had to do was squeeze a bit and rub a bit and lock eyes with Harry, incredible Harry, as he gave in to his own pleasure, rocking into Draco’s hand again and again and again and never breaking eye contact until he finally threw his head back and darkened his grey joggers with come right there in front of Draco.
“On your knees,
"You're not confused, you're just nosy, like you've always been." Draco took a sip of his drink. It was just as gorgeous as he remembered.
“What happened here?” he asked. “I know I got a part of the flower beds and the lawn done yesterday before you stopped me, but I’m quite sure I didn’t finish the whole thing. Unless I sleepwalked in the middle of the night with a bag of compost and my secateurs.”
"Anti-Apparition wards?" Draco repeats. He hadn't even realised the Magister had been attempting to Apparate. "But I didn't..."
Malfoy pouted. "Do you really

whatever he had to say. I was able to see and understand his actions from a totally neutral place, even though those actions caused me pain, caused others pain." Draco puts his cup down. He's hardly drunk any. "I'm sorry, Harry, I'm blathering on again."
"This?" Potter stopped scratching and laughed.
“Yes, very dashing, you should definitely wear it to the Ball.”
"I assure you, sir, that the benefits of treating the entire body are well worth whatever misgivings you may have—"
Harry laughed. "He'll get over it. They've been at me for ages—him and Rotchburns—trying to find the

He knew his friends were worried. Hermione, particularly,

Harry sank down heavily to the floor, his back against the door and bare legs on the cold floorboards—the whole room was blessedly cool, in fact, thanks to the Muggle air-conditioning. As he sucked in a couple of fortifying breaths, he took in his surroundings for the first time, and the breaths he was trying to take left him. Hermione had really outdone herself selecting this place. Soft furnishings in purest white contrasted with the dark walnut wood of the flooring and pitched ceiling. Fluttering gauzy curtains drew his eye towards the floor-to-ceiling windows that looked out onto an unspoiled view of Lombok Strait and the Nusa Islands far in the distance.
"Mr Potter?" Kirana called again.
And so they sat down. Potter and Malfoy, having a drink together, in a tropical paradise, at sunset. Nothing ridiculously absurd about that in the slightest, thought Draco, slightly deliriously. Maybe he'd had one Banana Hammock too many.
"Which is precisely why he
The potion.
"Please, Potter." Draco's voice comes out all husky. He looks into Potter's green, green eyes and says again, "
“Potter! Nice earring! Got a purse to match?”
“You can all choose a flower from the garden and pick five of each,” called Harry, “and make sure the stems are long so we can make a nice bunch for holding.”
Draco lifted his arm and let Potter take it, and after Potter hissed briefly and grit his teeth, he hummed and turned Draco's arm this way and that, and where his fingers pressed into Draco's skin it was like a cool balm on the prickly irritated skin.
"Unhand me at once! What in the name of old Perseus Black do you think you're doing?"
"No!" She sits up straighter. "No, then he'd have known what we were doing. We had to keep quiet."
Draco would have found the whole thing quite amusing, on reflection. If only it hadn't turned out to be Harry fucking Potter.
Draco looks at Potter. Potter looks at Draco. They both look back at Robards.
"I'm just so very protective of Master Draco. He's had a difficult time since the war ended and..." Hestia trailed off. There was no need to dredge all that up. Discretion concerning the personal life of one's master or mistress was another element of a loyal kettle's ambit.
“Yeah.” Draco looked at Harry’s lifeless form. “Better off.” Then something struck him. “Wait. Earlier. Did you say ‘she’? Is… Is it a girl?”
“Yes,” Draco said, a bit too sharply, “I suppose so,” while thinking,
When the next track began, quieter and melodic, Harry saw the neon-haloed man again, his hair flickering between green and pink now. The music seemed to pulse through the man’s long limbs and move him of its own accord as he danced fluidly with eyes closed. He was thin, almost painfully so, every contour of his body visible through the flimsy t-shirt he wore—the hem of it jagged with stray threads—and the jeans that clung to him obscenely.
Poisoning? Cold dread seeped into Draco’s chest and his mind whirled with what could have possibly happened. What he did know, however, was that Harry was here in the building. He made his way as quickly as possible to reception, arriving sweaty and flustered and very fucking stressed, and demanded directions to the Poisoning department from the poor Welcome wizard on duty.
Biting cold air rushed over him, and the hair on his arms, legs and scalp rose up in protest. He felt stripped bare. Exposed. A fierce shiver tore through him, an icy chill that seeped into his blood and bones. He thought of his family, hoped desperately they were safe.
. "If the... the gentleman can leave his contact details, I'll—"
All his friends appeared to have moved on, made their peace with the horrors they'd lived through. They went out, they talked about happiness and forgiveness and love and Nando's like it was all just that easy. Harry wanted to reconnect with that innocent, joyful part of himself, too. To be like them. He did. But he couldn't figure out how. He suspected

, and he was unduly tickled by it. "Why, I am a queen, dear," Harry said in his very poshest voice. “Refined!”
“Oh. Nothing really. Just remembered Allison commenting that it wouldn’t be long before I had persuaded you round for tea and biccies, and she was right. She seems to be trying to pair us up.”
They exchanged a worried look.
“No, I mean maybe I’ll be able to feel the magic, and uh, deduce what’s going on?”
Draco did Owl Potter later that day, when he'd collected himself enough to think straight. He'd sat there on the oriental runner in the hall for almost an hour, too shaken to stand, running over the conversation with Gabe, again and again. It had been a blow to see him again. Sure he'd seen him in magazines over the months, but being face to face again had been kind of … shocking. The man looked bloody good—fuck, he always looked good, that’s why he was paid to model clothes—and it never failed to spark desire in Draco, but the feeling of betrayal and hurt won out, and Draco was weak with relief that he'd managed to stand his ground.
Sheepish, he takes my hand. "Sorry darling." He looks sideways at me. "Won't happen again?"
He stared into clever grey eyes. Draco did know, Harry could see it. Relief spread through him. He felt like he could cry, but knew with certainty that he wouldn’t, so he just put his head down on Draco’s shoulder so that his nose touched Draco’s neck. Draco hummed at the touch. Harry’s jaw still ached a bit, but tiredness took over. He closed his eyes and focused on the sound of Draco’s breathing and the birds singing their morning song.

“Right. Really channel that feeling. And cast. Firm and clear.”
‘Time’ is a few days, a week, maybe two! Not eight months!”
“That’s what you’re supposed to look like when you’re heavily pregnant. That’s what we all look like in here. Ugh, well except for that bloke Sam.” Draco narrowed his eyes. “
The Magister leads them to the room, and as they step over the brass threshold, Draco feels the jolt of electricity again. He glances at Potter who's clearly felt it too.
"I can't... we weren't supposed to..."
Draco peeled off his marigolds and rushed out of his house. He met Pansy at his garden gate and waited for her to give him the good news.
The vociferousness of Robards' voice was horribly distorted by the cheapo Port-A-Floo in Draco's flat. They could scarcely understand each other, the international connection was so poor. But, fuelled by the memory of Draco's kisses (there had been several more once they'd got in the door, which Harry'd had to put a halt to lest Robards be the second person this week to be treated to a view of Harry's tented shorts), Harry persevered, explaining that he was extending his stay in Bali for an additional fortnight to 'reap the full therapeutic benefits of the place'—Draco had fed him that line.

And that was that. Until the following year. When Teddy wanted both his dads to dress up for Halloween. He was into Disney ever since they got a Muggle DVD player and television installed, and he begged as only a four year old can for his dads to be Baloo and King Louie to his Mowgli. But Harry resisted, and walked out the door and vanished from the front step with a pop.
"Ah, that'd be, erm, that 'all work-related hexes, curses, injuries or ailments,
"You didn't just run, Potter, you
"Not so fast!" Potter's shout brings his focus back to the present. Placid's wand flies in front of his face and across the room into Potter's hand. The Magister bellows in fury and lurches at Draco. Reacting purely on instinct, Draco's fist connects with Placid's cheekbone, hard. It bloody hurts his knuckles, and Draco is momentarily shocked by how darkly satisfying it feels. Conjured cords swoop and encircle the Magister's free hand, binding it to the other behind his back. He falls to the side, thrashing wildly.
"I'm happy to continue if it's helping," the man assured. "You can wait a few moments, take some deep breaths and see if that, ah, helps, or you can go ahead and turn over now and just lay your t-shirt across your lap?"
The song blaring on the speakers proclaimed
The rest of the morning was spent taking a tour of the labour wards. Draco made sure to keep a distance from Potter, focusing instead on the rather spartan beds and the scary-looking equipment and the chief Midwix’s talk about the order of events once you arrived in hospital.
After Ginny and Luna left to go dance and snog, Harry talked further with Draco. Words came easily, without the halting uncertainty that Harry often noticed in himself when he attempted to talk to others about his upbringing, about what Hogwarts meant to him, about the war, about what he’d had to do on that dark, dark day, about walking to face his own death. And as he spoke, penetrating insights about the events of his life seemed to flow through him, like he was walking through beaded curtains into each memory and seeing it all from a new angle.
exercise of writing up his birth plan on the handy template Fordus had provided, without Potter’s running commentary on things, which he’d noted was generally flippant or dismissive or just downright negative. If he didn’t know better, he’d think Potter didn’t even want to have the baby.
“Of course,” Draco said icily. “How could I forget?
He sighed with relief when the man took hold of his ankle and began pressing his fingers into the flat of Harry's foot, and then the other, stretching and rolling out the muscles there, rhythmic and insistent. That felt pretty amazing too.

"What are you on about, you berk?" Potter pulled on Draco's arm. "Come on, there's a free table now." Draco looked towards the decking outside the Big Bamboo, and sure enough, a young couple was standing up, about to depart.

about what he and some bloke called Cyril had got up to, not to mention his reference to the amount of 'waxing his own broom-handle' he'd had to make do with since.
"I reckon you almost let something slip, there, Malfoy," Potter joked, though his expression was kind.
“Don't worry, you trollop, you can keep snogging your girlfriend,” And then to everyone’s shock he sang,

The cellar space was everything that Harry had expected it to be: cold, musty and badly lit, filled with all manner of furniture and boxes and various items covered with cloth. He decided within minutes that it must have been expanded with Wizard Space because he lost sight of Draco completely, only occasionally hearing a faraway call out for Hestia. He supposed he too should have been shouting for Mrs Potts.
Bloody hell, Harry thought. How did every bloody person who met him figure out how sad a sex life he had?

"Incoming, Potter!" Pansy shouted triumphantly, launching herself onto his back. Harry stumbled slightly at the impact, laughing as her lithe frame clambered to sit on his shoulders. "Much better, I can see so much further now!"
He shook his head. "Yeah," Harry added, "and what's with all this?" He gestured at the beautifully laid out table with plates and cake stands piled high with the most tempting-looking (and smelling) food. Tiered trays of dainty finger sandwiches, savoury tartlets and scotch eggs beckoned him. A plate piled high with plump scones sat beside pots of jam, lemon curd and clotted cream. Stacks of toasted crumpets shining with melted butter accompanied a collection of light golden madeleines shimmering with icing sugar, miniature, fluffy Victoria sponges and fruit-filled pavlovas. To Harry's amazement, there was even a plate of Cocoa Glaciers—Draco's very favourite. Harry's mouth watered; he knew that if Kreacher had a hand in this, everything would taste just as delicious as it looked.

Minutes yawned and stretched out, and glary light poured itself over the morning. Draco unfolded his limbs and the robe fell from them. "Want to stay out here for a bit longer?" he asked.
"No," Malfoy whispers. "No. You won. We won. It's over."
Draco knew where Harry was heading out to. First stop, the house in Godric's Hollow, to have a small sit and a medium-sized mope and a big think, and then he'd pick flowers from the ones he and Neville had planted in the garden and bring them to the little cemetery for a little bit more thinking and quite a deal more moping. Draco
And that wasn't the only strange thing. The minute they'd set foot in the blood-spattered room, they'd both startled, and Draco felt a light zap and tingle over his skin. Potter had looked spooked too, and seemed sweaty and uncomfortable for several minutes afterwards.
"Don't feel you need to tell me," Harry assures. "Though I can't deny I'm curious."
Harry laughed. "Well, yeah. So,
Draco wasn’t really sure how he was supposed to answer. Potter had actually acted really friendly, almost as if he was glad to see him. That didn’t mean they were out of the dragon's nest yet. This could all be some ploy on Potter’s part to get them to fuck up, so Draco needed to be extremely careful.
“And your papa,” said Harry, and Draco could see his eyes were shining in the way they did when there were too many emotions brimming. “He was brave too; it took so much courage for him to stand up for himself and do what was right in the end. He had so much more than me to lose. And well, I admire and love your papa so very, very much."
“I don’t think
Draco thinks he might have a little crush. And by little, he means he’s properly in love.
Well, not every part of him.
Harry groaned into the towel and squeezed his eyes shut. "Yes."
“Fuck, that was wicked,” Harry laughed, “But I could go for a nap now.”
“It’s alright, Gin,” said Harry.
"Salazar," Draco whispered, tears springing to his eyes. His skin prickled all over. They could have
"Fuck it, Draco." His voice is strained. "I still need- I feel like I need to touch you. Maybe the curse takes a while to fully lift. Maybe it just fades slowly."
. Draco has inherited a few Black traits from his mother. He will survive. He will endure.
Back in the classroom he focused on his mother's face, proud and domineering as she instructed Madam Malkin as to what fabrics to use, vicuña wool for winter robes and mulberry silk for summer; they all looked lush and brilliant, and Draco had felt just as brilliant and awfully proud as he was measured up for them.
Draco understood why Pineneedle was so pleased. The Aberdeen angus steak was Floyd’s signature dish, and one that he could do in his sleep. Draco was going to have no problem impressing Potter, and he was no expert in Divination but he was absolutely certain that a good review was in his future—if Potter could find it in himself to overlook their shaky past.
Draco wants to die. His heart is racing though so he probably won't anytime soon. "I… I didn't mean to say it. I'm sorry. Please, we're friends. We're comfortable, we have routines.  I don't want to mess that up. I... I like our life. I mean, my life, not

Draco raised his hand to Potter in a salute and the man froze. Then he seemed to sag a bit, before waving back, setting his drink down and starting towards him.
He had a part of Gabriel inside him. Just as Potter had a part of some other man inside him.

“Please, everyone,” Draco said in his most authoritative tone, “stand back and give us some room,” and then he uttered “

“Yes. Well... I certainly won’t make him any worse, I can promise you that.”
“What? Just ask. Bloody hell, Malfoy.”

"Right," Harry said, over-loud. " Right, well I'll leave you to that. Goodbye, Malfoy."
with just that little bit of aggressive emphasis, but he pushed that thought away. “Well, I’ll be going by 'Father', so that won’t apply…”
“Can I?” Potter whispers. Draco can feel the frantic pulse in Potter’s fingertips on his mouth, and his lips throb in anticipation.
two days off work lounging at home in his ratty jogging bottoms and ordering takeaway like the last time.
"Now hang on," Hestia protested, feeling her temper boil up, "it's not as if you were innocent in all this. I seem to remember you taking great issue with Master Draco's tea-bags!"
Draco was pinning quite a significant number of hopes on one of his employees figuring out who the critic actually was. Not that any of his diners ever had a bad experience, or worse, bad food, but it would make life a lot easier if he knew who to focus his very best skills and magic on.
“I am. But I’m more interested to know what you think.”
Draco sighed in response. Then fumbled in his pockets for a minute. He wrote his address on a Rizla pack with a tiny fat black pencil and slid it across the table.
“What is it?”
He senses Potter turning his head to look at him. "Neither do I," he says. Draco stays looking at the ceiling. Potter moves his leg so it's touching Draco's. "We should go for dinner... tonight."
"Well," Draco declared, "This is quite the surprise. I must say I

Draco's follow-up question around work-related travel garnered a mirthless laugh that made his heart ache. Potter explained that he'd stayed in various forms of accommodation, but nowhere that was particularly
His remarks earned him a raised eyebrow from Draco. "Who?"
“Dear Salazar.” Draco found he quite liked the way Potter had said
of nails on skin, and it was so unbearable he swatted Potter's hand away and smoothed over the red-raw skin with his own palm. There was a small static shock, but Potter was right, they could manage it for another day or so.
“Actually, I don’t have a—
He roused Harry as gently as he could.
"It wasn't a request, Auror Potter. Out.
As he walked, he made a mental note to inform Hermione that an International Portkey, while still unpleasant and rather like a butcher's hook to the navel, was an infinitely better travel option than trains, planes and automobiles.
We wake up sweating and panting, clutching each other, lungs clawing for air. He kisses me, quietening my whimpers, his breath whispering warm on my face, his voice familiar and beautiful as the sun.
Potter's fingers begin gently threading their way through his hair, and Draco closes his eyes again. Waves of irresistible sleepiness swell and break through his body with each circling movement through his hair. It feels divine.
This was war.
Harry laughed. “That’s your parental instincts kicking in already.”
Draco hands stilled, and Harry heard him say, "Fucking hell, Harry."
Potter's eyes widened before he called back, "Yeah, just a bit itchy. Think that lady at the B&B used some aggressive dry-cleaning charms on our robes." Potter was always good at thinking on his feet.
"I see. So you didn't report the curse to Magister Placid?"
"Remember mate, that Cyril bloke, the one who worked in Gringotts. That was last summer, can you
“Whatever, bloody hell. You’ve got to help me. Cho just keeled over as we were tucking into our food. Is there a Floo here I can use to get her to St Mungo's?”
Draco looked around again as Potter cleared up some unwashed plates and cutlery from the table. Then he realised what it was. There were no indications whatsoever that Potter was about to have a baby in a matter of weeks. Not a buggy, not a babygro, not a cuddly stuffed gnome or dragon to be seen. And it made him wonder. Potter had chosen to have this baby, but he didn't seem overly invested in the classes. He grumbled a lot, and he didn't seem to have a house fit for raising a child. It was puzzling.
“Merlin. What I wouldn’t give for a foot rub,” Draco groaned.

“Keep still, Lily, love.” It was tricky to talk with two pins sticking out of his mouth, and it sounded more like
Draco was reasonably confident that he could trust Pineneedle to do a marvellous schmooze job—he was young and charming and eager to please—and all Draco would have to worry about was preparing the food perfectly. After all, a good and efficient service would certainly get them bonus points, but it was the food that truly mattered in the end. And Draco had trained for years under renowned
"Tunnock's teacake?" Draco asked.
Before he could change his mind, he tipped the liquid into his mouth. It tasted unpleasantly bitter on his tongue, and it was a relief to wash it down with a gulp of beer.
And he did. A gentle press of lips and a soft exhale. Harry leaned in for more, cupping Malfoy's cheek and running his tongue along his lower lip, tasting sea salt and banana-mango and warmth and softness.
"Shit! Sorry!" Draco gasped.
Everyone says Draco is beautiful, but to Harry, Draco is simply… home. And that’s the most beautiful thing he can imagine.
, pointing to a page in one of the brochures, showing a red-orange sunset and the silhouette of a ripped bloke with a surfboard under his arm.
They walked carefully towards the quivering layer of air obstructing their vision, and Harry prodded it with his wand. It wobbled and shimmered but his wand went straight through without any fizzing or sparks.
Draco clearly indicated on the form what sort of birth environment he favoured, which pain relief he was happy to use, and which he wasn’t, what his preferred birthing positions were, and his preferences for cutting the cord. He overheard Potter at one point mumbling to someone, and when he snuck a glance he was able to just about hear him scoffing to Langston about mood lighting and aromatherapy. Draco grit his teeth. He was even more glad Potter wasn’t sitting next to him; he wasn’t in the mood to have to defend his choices of citrus blossom and clary sage candles (though Draco knew the very real uses and benefits of both inside out). When he got to the part asking who his birthing partner was going to be, he paused. He hadn’t really thought about who would accompany him. Well, that wasn’t strictly true, he’d more avoided thinking about it. Not Gabriel,
Draco looked at Granger who was hesitating, her mouth open as if to say something. Then she nodded and said, “Yes. Draco and I are both here together… for Harry.”
And it was right when he was feeling rubbish and wondering how everything had gone to shit, and just resting his forehead against Gabe's chest, just for a moment, that Draco heard a solemn "Oh" and looked up to see Potter standing there, very much at sixes and sevens, face like a kicked crup, and holding an eight-pack of chocolate frogs.
Potter smiled. A big bright thing, if a little lopsided, but that just added to the excitement that Draco felt building in him.
That year had held so many horrors, but none so terrifying as having a Dark Lord and his henchmen bed-and-breakfasting with him in his childhood home, sprawling themselves over their good chaise longues and tapping billywig cigarette ash over the card table where Mother did her needlework.
"Potter."
these days; it had tipped over from a craving to a dependency at this point—and a warm bath infused with a few drops of mood-lifting geranium and wild orange oils, Draco changed into his comfiest pyjamas, made himself a cup of lemon balm tea, and sat in an armchair ready to practice.

not just a beer belly." Draco pointed with his half-eaten biscuit.
"Thank you, Kreacher, you've really outdone yourself here." Harry smiled as the elf bowed low in reply. As he took a chair at the table, a plate, teacup and saucer levitated their way toward him. "But, how did you know we needed your help?"
“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have assumed—”
that one time they'd had a drunken heated conversation in the Fwooper and Firkin at Slughorn's 80th birthday bash, which ended with Potter shoving Draco against a wall and some significantly laboured breathing on both their parts, before Pomona Sprout walked by and they sprang apart panting, red-faced and scowling, but he was positive Potter had forgotten all about that. At any rate, it hadn't seemed to sour their subsequent interactions.
Potter grinned. "I'm in." One of the bar staff approached them and Potter announced, "Two Puckered Pink Peaches, please!"
On the first of August, the day after a most subdued birthday party for Harry, Phoenix Malfoy and Holly Potter both decided it was time to enter the world, at five minutes to nine in the morning and twenty past one in the afternoon, respectively. Pansy did a sterling job as birth partner for Draco, only fainting twice, and not minding in the least when Draco swore blue murder at her.
"You kinky bastard. I can certainly arrange a few stinging hexes the next time we..." Potter trails off and the pink of his cheeks turns crimson.
"I see." Draco pushed Harry back down onto the bed. Harry liked where this was going.
"Yes!" she squealed excitedly. "Right to the stage, and the bar tents, and to the food stalls. And is that Blaise and Longbottom queued for the Magi-loo? Oh, Draco you've got to let Gin on your shoulders, she'll be ever so—"
“Draco,” Pansy whined, “I don't feel very secure up here on your spindly legs.”
He was glad—of course he was—that Chang would get the medical attention she needed, but he was left very unsure over the fate of his restaurant. And if he was honest, seeing Potter again had stirred up a lot of those old secret feelings about his erstwhile rival. Feelings he’d thought had long gone.  He sighed and turned his attention to the restaurant service. There were still customers out there that needed their food cooked. Pining for a spoken-for (and clearly straight) Potter was as pointless now as it was back then.
After a cheese and pickle sandwich, and two chocolate frogs—Potter had dropped the pack on the hallway table on his way out, and Draco had felt rather guilty opening it but the baby's need for chocolate was simply too great—Draco wrote a letter to Potter. And then he read back over it, decided it was too overwrought, cast a swift
"What?"
and of course,
But Potter threw his head back and laughed, and it only got louder when he noticed the bewilderment on Draco’s face, in fact it was so raucous that he had to put his hand on Draco’s shoulder to steady himself.
Merlin, this was the last bloody thing he needed.
Posted: 15 May 2021
Even Potter's friends are a bonus, Draco's come round to thinking. Longbottom calls around once a week so their place always smells of gardenias or freesias or peonies, depending on the season. And somehow, the little garden on their balcony is thriving too. Draco wonders if everything around Potter grows better and stronger in his presence. He’s struck up an unlikely friendship with Granger too, whether it’s here in the flat debating the merits of cleaning spells over Cillit Bang, or at work where they can nerd out over Love Potion consent legislation and double-bubble core theory.
“I did.” Draco took Harry’s hand. “I know it's quick, but I think we'd do a good enough job. Let’s do this together.”
. There appear to be various types depending on what one's goal is. Draco hums. Not 'Conflict Resolution'. Not 'Subservience'. Definitely not 'Parenting a Wayward Child'. Not—
Something about the whole case didn't make sense. There was just no motive whatsoever. And apparently Goodsister Joanna was refusing to talk. Draco was wondering if they might just have to wait for the Wizengamot to administer Veritaserum before they were enlightened as to what really transpired. But he really didn't want it to come to that.
Harry knew that Draco was far too besotted with him to ever disobey him, but he liked the added security.
Sitting on his queen-size bed with the sheer bed-hangings pulled back, Harry dug into his fragrant Nasi Goreng with gusto. And as he did, his thoughts turned once again to a certain blond with skilful hands.
“Draco, I-” Harry doesn’t know whether to say what he wants to say. If it will hurt Draco.
Potter accompanied Chang through the Floo, sparing Draco a small worried glance right before he disappeared into the flames. Draco stood there watching the smoke curling out of the grate with mixed emotions.
“That is perfectly reasonable,” said Draco. “What is not reasonable, however, is that scare you gave me this morning.”
The baby shifted around inside him, and he pressed his fingers into the small protrusion that appeared just left of his belly button. There was an answering nudge back. A tiny foot, or maybe an elbow.
, never stops, does it?"
and it rankled.
Potter slid a hand up Draco’s calf. “Perhaps you’d like me to rub something else, then?”
can spell disaster for the success of the union."
Harry Potter, renowned for making the impossible possible (apart from taming his hair), and didn’t he teach that group of fifth years how to cast the spell, even Weasley and Longbottom who were usually hopeless at Charms? By the end of class Draco decided it had to be worth a try, and that he’d swallow his pride and take Potter up on his offer.
“Yeah, alright." Potter sat up a bit straighter and ran a hand through his dark curls. "So, er, what… what sort of parent do you want to be? What do you want for your kid?”
“No, Malfoy, hang on, I wasn’t laughing at
"Merlin, I wish you had. I'm leaving tomorrow morning. Fuck, I really wish I wasn't."
“Thing is,” Potter leaned in to whisper, and Draco gasped as the side of Potter's bump pressed into Draco’s, warm and firm, “just between us, well, and my close friends obviously, I’m not actually a hundred per cent sure who the other dad is.”
"Fuck me, these

Harry had no idea how he'd recover it, other than retracing his steps. And he really did

Draco didn’t want to get ahead of himself, but he was fairly certain—no, make that
scruffy eager-eyed boy entered his memory and he faltered on the last syllable. In his memory his heart had leapt at the sight of the boy, but here, now, in this room, his heart dropped with the weight of knowledge that his younger self had been innocent of. How badly he’d fucked up their first interactions… and all that had followed thereafter.
"You left so bloody fast you didn't even realise you dropped your wand. Do you know the arsing thing fired off a spell too, in what I can only assume was some magical manifestation of panic, causing several sun-loungers to flip over spontaneously. It's a good job the locals aren't inclined to ask too many questions."
It was after closing time, so of course Wattlepot wasn’t about to let him enter. Draco knew there must be some purpose to Potter’s visit, and it wasn’t likely to be auspicious—especially if he was coming so late in the day—however, despite the temptation to bar him entry, he gesticulated to Wattlepot to let Potter in.
“Almost there,” Potter whispered when, after several minutes, Draco choked out low moans and soft murmurs of
“No, not anymore." Neither of them needed to elaborate. Of the three Malfoys left bearing that name, one was incarcerated for life, one was in the Janus Thickey ward and would be for some time, and one was sitting in front of him, looking pale and vulnerable even as he sparkled under the lights. The Malfoys no longer wielded the power and influence they once did. The remaining scion looked at Harry uncertainly with big dark eyes through a fall of inky lashes.
Which was something Harry was having a very hard time getting his head around.
it with a knife. What a mess. Maybe the villa would have a phone he could use to call Hermione, and he could sort the charges out later.
But now. Now it was of vital importance to Draco. A knot of worry rose in his chest; he had five weeks before the baby was due, so he would just have to practice, practice, practice. He’d read all the theory that existed on the subject, even spending a day in the Manor library searching for inspiration. And he’d tried so many memories, from his childhood, from Hogwarts, but nothing worked. More than once he'd wondered if it was just impossible for a Death Eater, even a reformed one, to cast the spell properly. Whatever the reason was, he was now determined to find a way.
Harry follows Draco into a hallway and down a small set of stairs into a modest-sized kitchen, all sage-green walls and dark grey wood. It’s a bit more cluttered in here, with photos and knick-knacks and little china ornaments, and there’s a pile of folded laundry on the kitchen table. But there’s a lovely lived-in feeling too, and it smells like the mint Harry can see in a pot on the windowsill.
Harry shivered in the preternatural cold of the morning. He felt it creep up his spine and his jaw locked. His movements were careful and deliberate as they walked across the quiet, sober street into St Matthew’s Peace Park.
Harry chuckled to himself as Draco attempted to dismantle the final enchantment at the doorway to the cellar. He seemed uncharacteristically flustered for someone who ordinarily had very few issues with spellwork. Perhaps it was the stinging zap that the lock gave him when he inserted the wrong key; or the outlandish belch of foul smoke that clouded them briefly as they walked down the stairwell; or perhaps it was Harry's own presence that was unnerving him so. In any case, Harry supposed it
“I’d really like it to be your business.” He took a step forward and took Potter’s hand. The sleeve of his jumper was a bit too long and Draco shoved it up his wrist and linked his fingers with Potter’s. “I know we never decided what we were. But I’d like us to still be
just scalded me!"
"You're unreal," Potter snorted. "You are one hundred percent as nosy as me, you just don't want to admit it."
Draco was used to going for drinks with men he'd just met, but this was different. A lot different. They knew so much about each other already. And yet, there were so many questions. What was Potter doing out here, all by himself? Why had he been lurking at a bar, staring at Draco, and then claiming to have been looking for him?
“Thanks… ah…?” replied Potter. His brow was shining with sweat, and his hands shook a little. Draco had never seen him look so distressed.
When the flames caught properly, the sour ash coated my throat. I swallowed it down gladly. I was obsessed with him. His face, eyes wild, sharp teeth grinning white through the smoke. I didn't know how to look away from him. I never had.
"You know what,
“Nothing new for you, I'll wager," Draco snips, but there's no prickle in it, so Harry sticks his tongue out. "Yes…" Draco hums. "That’s definitely part of it, a reduction in the intensity of fear and threat perception. And that’s why I think it could be so useful."
Potter swallowed his biscuit down. “Right, me neither. Not sure if you know but Allison is actually a trans woman. So she's biologically the mum. As in...”
He was never sure if Dean had even noticed the small emblem until Harry Potter brought it up. The Great Hall was still full of choking spellsmoke and the ferrous tang of blood, and Potter had just brought down fucking-well Lord Voldemort with a first year spell, and there he was, striding over to Draco, where he was standing... where he was
“Yes, well, there’s a thought.” Draco wondered the same sometimes, whether he’d ever find love again. “I hear it’s troublesome enough getting back into any kind of a normal sex life when you have a new baby
“What in the name of Merlin and all the Founders is wrong with you? Leave my garden alone!”
“Cool it, Potter. I
“Not ‘want to know why’, just... thought I’d offer help if you needed it or wanted it, but I understand if you don’t. Like I said, people offering unwanted help and advice is something I can relate to.”
They took a break after that and Draco tried to avoid talking to anyone, eschewing the selection of rice cakes on offer and opting to take his cup of tea to the window and look out over the city. He could easily spot the iconic structures of the Gherkin and Tower Bridge and, looking across the river, the strikingly raw and industrial Tate Modern building. He could see too quite a few green spaces breaking up the grey and silver of the city and began to think about how nice it would be be going for walks with the pram through the various parks dotted around the place, strolling around Stepney Green, and Haggerston, and maybe feeding the ducks in Mile End park. Hopefully they’d get a good summer; it’d been a pretty rainy June.
And he's right. So Draco turns to Placid, who's given up shouting against the Silencing charm and appears to be saying some sort of silent prayer or incantation. Draco grabs the Magister roughly by his tunic and hauls him to a seated position. He ends the Silencing Charm and crouches down, holding his wand casually against the loose crepey skin of the Magister's throat. "You're going to lift the curse," Draco demands.
it about Langston?” she said. “He’s got such an air of authority. He’s kind of…”
A third round of cocktails was ordered, and Potter began confessing an entirely more personal storyline—about his lovelife, or the lack thereof. Draco, of course, had read some of the numerous speculative articles about Potter's sexuality prior to leaving London. He listened intently and without comment, nodding along as though he was quite indifferent about it all; inside, of course, he was desperate to hear the true story straight from the mouth of the Chosen One himself.
"Mr Potter!" Kirana called again.

before I do it for you."
“No way,” said Draco. “I refuse to… I simply can’t... ” He didn’t finish the sentence. He was too horrified. Draco did not want to share with anyone, and especially not Potter, the fact that since becoming pregnant, he'd been randier than a centaur with Mars in Capricorn.
a thing. He came around trying to start things back up,
The doorbell went a good five minutes before the allotted time, and Draco dropped his wand in surprise. Once he'd completed the laborious task of picking it back up again, he gave himself a once-over in the hallway mirror. He was wearing a comfy wrap top made of a soft jersey material with a grey sash that tied at the side just above his waist, accentuating his curving abdomen. He’d tried baggy loose tops when he was first starting to show, but now that he was gargantuan there was no point hiding it, so he’d decided he might as well just flaunt it. His hair was looking decent enough too, and he quickly swapped his fluffy slippers for a pair of slip-on Vans.
"Master Draco," a voice called out, and there she was, Draco's copper kettle, proudly sitting atop a raised silver tray on the table, alongside none other than a smiling Mrs Potts. Relief washed over Harry like a balm.
Draco couldn’t speak. He knew that Harry loved him but he'd never had it laid out like that, in front of their children. And it loosened an aching lump inside of him, the one that got in the way whenever Harry shut him out of his Halloween mourning.
" he said, as he ushered Harry through the doorway with an outstretched hand.
, as if your whole life and everything in it was suddenly in jeopardy."
, who knew intimately the horrors of the war, and could imagine what things had been like for him in its wake. Even if that person had thought he deserved it, thought he'd got off easy.
Harry guffawed, colour returning to his cheeks. "Where's Ron, then?" Harry asked, squinting around. Granger passed him his glasses. "Too busy apprehending criminals to come running when his best mate keels over for the zillionth time."
"Hestia!" Draco cried, at the same time as Harry laughed, "Mrs Potts!"
Tonight, it's Potter’s choice, and he's seated on the sofa, one leg tucked underneath himself and an elbow propped on the arm of it with the remote in hand. He's in a cobalt blue t-shirt that clings, stretching temptingly across his chest and upper arms, and black joggers, his glasses perched gently atop his nose, and his hair looks soft and fluffy.
"Get out," Draco hissed. "Just get the fuck out."
his memories were tainted with something unhappy: the party that Gabe threw him… the same Gabe who dumped him; and that the memory of catching the Snitch… because… because it wasn’t against Gryffindor at all, was it? It was Hufflepuff. He’d never won against Gryffindor, never beaten Harry Potter.

“Perhaps we can just keep within a certain close-ish distance on the night?”
When it came to the contest all that mattered, however, was how the front of the house looked, and that included the garden. A well-manicured lawn was essential for a good appearance, and the judges always paid close attention too to how the shrubs and hedges were maintained and, of course, how pretty the flower beds looked. Potter’s garden was a

"Perhaps a massage?" a deep, velvety voice offered from behind him. "By the state of those shoulders, I'll wager you work a desk job and put in far too many hours."
What the fuck was Malfoy doing here at all? Come to think of it, Harry hadn't heard a thing about Malfoy in years. The last time he'd seen him was at that awful Ministerial memorial, marking a year after the end of the war. Harry had admired his bravery in even attending. Amid jeers and obvious whispers, Malfoy had carried his thin, pallid form as elegantly as only he could and laid a simple wreath of rosemary studded with deep crimson roses at the feet of the elf figure on the restored Fountain of Magical Brethren. He'd thrown a handful of coins into the water and left the Atrium without a word. That was years ago now; so where had Malfoy been? Why was he out here giving massages on the Muggle beaches of Denpasar? And when did he get so good at it?
He’d messed it up. Before it had even had a chance to start. The thought seeped through him, cold and glutinous, that he could have had something with the man that had—let’s face it—been his fascination for so many years, and true to form, he’d managed to let it slip through his fingers.
Victory and loss.
"I only ever— Yes." Draco eyed him with curiosity. "I do only take one. But I need the sugar now. In fact, I recommend it."
, unless I'm very much mistaken,"—he screws up his face in mock-contemplation—"this clever little spell implies that you love me too...
"We're encouraged to, smartarse! And I think I've seen enough of this particular one. Four times is more than enough. It's clear what it does."
"And I shall accompany Madame," Blaise announced, Vanishing the smeared and blackened roach from his spliff as well as the ash that had fallen onto his baggy trousers.
His hands clamp onto Potter's hips, grind them down sinuously into his own, and with a litany of garbled swear words, Draco hurtles off the edge in an orgasm that keeps him thrashing on the bed for what feels like minutes.
Draco wanted to argue. He wanted to stay and finish what he started but he knew he couldn’t do that without Potter’s say-so. “Fine, I’ll go, but just know Zacharias Smith will win because of you and your shitty garden, and he’s the biggest homophobic shitstain I’ve ever had the displeasure of meeting so I hope you’re happy. He certainly will be delighted to have been victorious against the ‘poofters’, as he calls us.”
...three grinning faces. James, Albus, and Scorpius,
“Ahh,” Draco winces. “Can’t… can’t say. I’m… I am a trainee. At the Ministry. A Ministry trainee.”
Draco put his cup down and looked at Potter in disbelief. “I’d have thought that was perfectly obvious,” he said, gesturing at his stomach.
to know.”
groaned.
, but Harry hadn't been listening. He was swimming in the peacefulness of his mind and moving with the bump of the bass.
By half past nine, Draco was getting worried. With every minute that ticked by the magic in him was rising and rising. He could feel it crackling in his nerve endings, surging through his arteries, and he was struggling to concentrate on what was being said around him. At exactly nine forty-two Draco clenched his fist around his wand and something—a lamp?—shattered in the room, causing Eoin to yelp beside him. Draco excused himself to the loo. He needed to find out if Harry was okay.
"I just..." he began and trailed off. His teeth began to chatter.
“Uh, thanks, Ernest,” Potter said absently, and then he turned to Draco. “I’ll take it from here… um, Marco.”
He feels claimed, taken, and maybe...
“Oh god,” said Potter.
kettle."
After that Potter took a long drink from his glass, seemingly finished with his confessions for now. He leaned back in his chair and looked out at the ocean while Draco idly tapped his fingers on the tabletop along with the beat of the music and they sat in a not-entirely-uncomfortable silence, the warblings of Amber (
“Quite.” Draco narrowed his eyes. “As with kettles who have been sworn at and manhandled.”
"When what?" Draco presses, though he thinks he knows the answer.
"I don't think I'll keep my hand transfigured as a hook, Draco," Harry was saying, examining the curved silver hook protruding from his left arm. "It feels weird, and I don't want to hurt the kids accidentally." He took his wand out and began casting the reversal charm.
themselves at midnight each night.
“What did you buy?” Harry asked when the woman handed Draco his change.
He covered Harry’s eyes as they walked in and then took his hand away and said, “Ta-dahh!”
Once off the plane, he collected his bags, waited half an eternity in line at border control, and then found the chauffeur, managing a wry chuckle at the sign the short-statured man was holding. He figured "HAREY PORTER" was close enough, and what did it matter; it had done the job.
"A sentient kettle!" Harry exclaimed. "That

And so they drank tea, and ate their teacakes, and smoothed out the foil into perfect squares, and then, after they cleared up, Potter stood behind Draco, arm around his middle, grounding him, while Draco cast, using the memory of the kiss they'd just shared. A silvery wispy plume issued from his wand, dissipating after a few seconds, but Draco was ecstatic, and they practised and practised until Draco was able to hold and direct the shimmering gas.
So Harry did what any reasonable, sane, and totally rational grown-up would do.
involve him and his little bundle all alone, together against the world. That it might involve Potter in some way, and a Potter baby, and Draco felt those tears surfacing again as he sat down, and a whoosh of apprehensive joy as Potter squeezed his hand and silently asked with his eyes—green as shiny laurel leaves, beneath long dark lashes—if Draco was okay, and Draco nodded and squeezed back. "Hormones, eh," Potter whispered and rolled his eyes.
Harry complied, and Draco began sliding his hands up Harry's sides over the fabric of his t-shirt and up his back. Over his shoulders, down his arms, thumbs and fingers applying pressure in all the right places. He felt he'd turned to water under Draco’s touch, fluid and rippling. Harry had never experienced this much pleasure from a simple massage. It felt like Draco had twelve hands.

problem, and not a Death Eater problem.
of you knew what to do at the very least." Robards sighs exaggeratedly and raises his eyes to the ceiling, and Draco wants to sink into a hole in the ground. "What I'm struggling with here, gentlemen, so please help me out if you could, is why in the name of Helga's sweet bosoms you decided to keep this to yourself for
I never wanted to see your sharp, sneery face ever again.
“Thanks, Mal— I mean, Chef Marco,” Potter said, throwing Draco a wink. The type of wink he’d only seen used in seedy bars as a come-on. It had Draco’s whole face and neck heating up.
Harry whinnies in disbelief.
"Right," he gruffs. "Well, I've heard it all now. I'm warning you, though. No more canoodling while you're on duty! Or I'll have you for misconduct."
The low commotion of pre-dawn London made its way in, a simple melody in its chaos. The cars and buses as they drove past the park, a couple of drunk lovers giggling and stumbling along the path, their heads pressed together as they supported each other towards a park bench and landed heavily on it.  A brief blare of music and shouting as somewhere up the street emptied out and it almost, almost drowned out the low
"Hestie the Kettle?" Kreacher exclaimed. "Is Mrs Potts meaning Hestie Black, the Noble and Most Ancient Kettle of Black?”
“I could do it,” Draco said. “I have a little sewing kit, you know, for emergencies just like this one. I could try to mend Mr Gnome.”
"Mr Potter, sir! Please open the door. This gentleman says he knows you and that he needs to speak to you urgently—"
"Mother of Merlin." Robards is shaking his head and pinching the bridge of his nose. "Tell me, Auror Potter, what do you learn in
“Oi. It's 'clap your hands' not ‘slap Harry's bum if you believe in fairies’,” Harry laughed.
Later, after Draco had to sit down in elated exhaustion, and Potter had go for a piss for the third time, and Draco heaved himself up and made more tea, Potter mumbled around a second Tunnock’s teacake that he'd really liked kissing Draco, and that he'd like to do it a bit more if that was okay.
Harry liked knowing that if Draco ever wanted release, he would have to wait until Harry let him out.
Draco allowed himself to fall into the comforting rhythm of Potter’s hands. And it was okay, just for this little slice of time, for it to be all about him, and not the baby. To acknowledge that his body had been doing so much extra work, and that it needed release. He could simply focus on physical pleasure. And let Potter take care of him.
"So," Draco said, sitting next to Harry on the bed, "you're still getting those nightmares, then?". He looked worried. And in fairness to him, Harry did used to get the most horrific nightmares, but they'd not been so bad the last year or so. Harry put an arm around Draco's slender waist and pulled him closer, running his nose along the soft skin under his ear. He loved this man so much.
sort of hot, in a way.”
They were so happy most of the time. It wasn't easy, of course it wasn't, with three high-spirited children, and Draco was determined to make this year the best ever. Lily was three now and she was starting to understand what dressing up was, and she picked out the theme based on the pantomime they'd been to over Christmas (and the movie that she'd now watched at least seventeen times).
Harry had been good to her, and even though she agreed to serve in his household, she missed the warmth and familial air of the Burrow now more than ever.
“What? I’m not a child, I don’t need my hand held.”
A crack signals Janky's arrival. Draco looks up from the novel that he wasn't reading, and the Firewhisky that he's barely touched, his mind still playing the previous day's events on repeat.
He's gorgeous, Harry thought, fascinated with Malfoy’s face—his skin sticky with sweat, his dark, dark eyes, pupils blown and the whites bloodshot, mascara-black eyelashes—and the way the lights flicked between colours and each time revealed anew his perfect bone structure, again and again and again, and his hips, oh god how his hips moved as he danced. A faraway voice whispered that Harry shouldn't be thinking about all this, but he found it easy to ignore. He felt nothing but awe and compassion and possibly actually a bit of longing for Malfoy, and that, that was what made sense in Harry’s head right now. All the rest didn’t matter.
Draco takes a big gulp of tea then, and Harry notices his ears have gone quite pink. "Anyway, whatever." Draco coughs. "I suppose you could say it was all rather liberating.”
"They sinned!" Magister Placid retorts. "They took a vow when they joined. And yes I tried to stop it, and even then, they kept on sinning."
It was the beginning of a long night of feeling uncharacteristically undefensive and just
“She’s absolutely fine!” Potter was actually chuckling, and Draco could only goggle at his levity, though relief was starting to wash over him. “It was nothing to do with what she ate. More to do with what she drank, or what she didn’t drink.”
Emerging from the house into the walled garden of the cottage, Harry blinked in the cold-bright of the afternoon sun, dazzled for a moment. But as his vision became clear, so did the source of the din.

"Make it stop!" he managed to cry, though his skin was prickling and crawling and his limbs were wracked with spasms.
"Me too, much safer for the baby than Disillusionment." Draco stroked a hand over his abdomen as the baby shifted position. "But lots of people must know... everyone in our class for starters. Your trainees at the… whatever it’s called, Auror camp. How has it not leaked to the
Which was the last thing a continuously aroused Draco needed to hear. But he settled for kissing Harry so extremely thoroughly that he was unable to open his eyes for a few seconds afterwards, a strange joy having taken root in his heart, and tentatively stretched its green stems and buds out through his whole body. And then Draco hoarsely whispered, “Goodnight, Harry,” before he rolled his big self over and let sleep claim him.
"You'll both burn for this! Filthy sinn—"
“I hate him, Daddy, and I'm glad you killed him. But… But I never got to meet them, and it’s not fair!”
"I don't believe I did."
Draco conjures magical cords and ties Placid's ankles and wrists together, and then casually casts a Silencing Charm at the man to to put a stop to the blue murder that's being sworn at him.
He decided he’d speak to Pansy during the weekend and broach the idea.
On Friday morning the sun shone brightly, birds sang, and despite his pudgy ankles, Draco had a skip in his step arriving to class. But when nine o’clock came and went and there was no sign of Harry, Draco felt nervy. Fordus said he hadn’t had a message or heard from Harry. It didn't make sense. They’d talked earlier in the week about this being the last class for them both and that they’d go for a smoothie afterwards to celebrate. So where was he?
Potter's face relaxes, and a slow smile brightens his face. "I'll tell you what I think. That's a bloody clever little spell."
Back at the B&B afterwards, Draco broached the topic of their 'touching predicament' again. His skin had itched and burned all day, and the brief finger brushes and hands knocking into each other accidentally-on-purpose hadn't been enough succour for either of them.
Kreacher nodded as if encouraging them both.
"...as well as exploring and processing all your hopes, fears and worries, and of course, helping you to connect with the energy of the life force growing inside of you.”

"I don't know either," Potter says a bit more calmly, lifting himself off Draco, and there's a rather revolting noise when they separate, on account of the tacky come that's still wet in places and already drying up a bit in other places and fusing them together. And that sets Potter off again.
Gabriel glowered at him for several seconds. "You're bloody lucky I'm in the public eye. Last thing I need is 'Muggle Model Gabriel Whittaker throws pregnant boyfriend out on the street' in tomorrow's issue of Witch Weekly."
Draco lifted baby Hugo into his arms. He was warm and soft and smelled like love.
"That says more about your capability at brewing than the quality of my water," Hestia bit back.
Harry soon found himself at home in Malfoy's company, something that came so effortlessly he hardly realised it had happened.
“Assume you’re referring to that whole saving the wizarding world from evil thing? Rude of him really. I felt very neglected.”
The familiarity of that voice and that touch weakened Draco. He could have this comfort. He could take Gabe back. It would be so easy. But, he reminded himself, Gabe had hurt him, fucked off with that bleached-blonde clothes-horse, right when Draco had needed him the most.
"I love you, Draco Malfoy," Potter says, soft and clear. And Draco shakes his head, because this can't be fucking real. Potter chuckles. "Feels so weird to get to say that now. And you. Love. Me."
“You’re starting to sound like a Mind Healer now,” Draco said as they reached the door of the apartment block.

“But what happened? How did he get poisoned?”
That shade of violet on his eyelids that makes the silver in his eyes pop. That pale almost nude lip with a hint of shimmer. It's so on trend this winter, Pansy tells him, over the noise of shutters furiously clicking.
after trying various other 'relaxation methods', including the aforementioned joggers-lounging, thrice weekly yoga, and a disastrous aromatherapy candle meditation affair where he set his curtains on fire, Harry was advised to go on a 'sun holiday'. Harry suspected Healer Rotchburns just wanted a few weeks off from him.
"I didn't have anything specific planned for today, so, if you're interested, I happen to know a very good masseur." Draco smirked, and opened a cabinet containing an array of bottles and vials. "I'm sure that call with Robards was very
“What’s so funny?”
"Er…" was all he could come up with.
"That I can arrange," Draco smirked. "Later tonight," and he lifted Harry’s coat and gave his pert behind a sharp pat.
almost there, Merlin, he was; two more strokes and he was spurting hot and messy over Harry’s hand. He made a noise he wasn't aware he could make, husky and raw, as he came. He could feel it everywhere, the euphoria, the relief. In his legs, in the muscles of his back. In his belly, finally, blessedly quiet. Harry leaned forward awkwardly and kissed Draco through his release, still stroking him carefully, and Draco clumsily returned the kiss until the haze of his orgasm had dimmed.

Truthfully, they saw eye-to-eye on most things. Which surprised everyone, not least Harry and Draco themselves. It was crazy, but they fit together well.

“I’ve got you,” Potter croons, and he shifts Draco into position. Every movement makes him hyper-aware of Potter's fat cock in his arse and his own muscles stretched taut around it.

“To do up your garden,” he said desperately. “You said work doesn’t leave you with enough time to take care of it. So, you take a day off work to fix the garden, and I’ll pay you for that day. Even if you just cut the grass, and plant a few flowers… geraniums, nasturtiums, whatever. At this stage that will have to do.”
himself in the shower most mornings). There was plenty to do, and so many things to see. And importantly, lots of other tourists to mingle amongst so he wouldn't be too lonely.
He was afraid though, to be like them, loving and light-hearted and foolishly affectionate with what seemed to be anything or anyone.
Potter folded his arms and rested them on his bump. “Same.”
"Two? You only ever took one at Hogwarts."

Mrs Potts' sobs abated with a sniffle, and she stared at Kreacher, “Why... yes. Hesti-
“We’re about to be parents, Harry.” Harry gave him a look he couldn't decipher. "What is it?"
Excitement built as he studied the ring. The emeralds were stunning, and though they matched the hue of Harry's eyes perfectly, it was the unusual metal that was perfect for him, for
"Oh for fuck's—"
On questioning, it turned out Harry had been delivered a large potted Flitterbloom a few days earlier with a note saying it was an early birthday gift. Or at least he'd thought it was a Flitterbloom. Harry said he put the pot plant in the garden next to his Busy Lizzies and spiderflowers and thought no more of it—he often got weird and wonderful gifts from his, inverted commas, fans, he said, and he actually mimed the inverted commas.
“Teddy learned in Hogwarts. He owled me. You saved everyone from a bad wizard.”
Draco matched Potter's strides and within seconds they met on the beach, and Potter was straight in with, "Malfoy, I've been looking for you," which was very fucking rich seeing as Draco had been within spitting distance of Potter's villa for the past two days.
By the time they got back to their B&B in Thorney Hill, a little red-brick place with a thatched roof on the outskirts of the forest, they were both eager to wash their hands of all they'd heard, and in their shared bathroom, doing just that, was where they'd first felt it.
In the chillout area Malfoy sat a little too close to Harry, shoulder to shoulder on a low bench and passed him a bottle of water. Harry revelled in how good his arm felt pressed against Malfoy’s.
Potter takes a step towards Draco, and then huffs and turns towards the bathroom door. He goes in and closes the door behind him, and Draco whispers '
Now, I hide the lighters and the matches, even though Draco has Incendio anyway. I see him eyeing the unlit candles on Luna's sideboard, see his fingers twitch when Pansy lights a cigarette.
And then Potter swoops and crashes his lips and body against Draco's, and everything seems to explode into pure sensation and hot-cold magic and perhaps little cherubs and angels singing, though Draco's probably made that part up. Because no, there's only Draco and Potter in the room, and everything is right and everything is good and everything is perfectly as it should be.
For several wondrous minutes, the man's hands moved over him, circling up the muscles alongside his spine, and even up into his hair which had Harry feeling like his scalp had goosebumps, and then raking down his neck and vanishing any tension he had even thought of holding in his muscles. Harry's breathing slowed and deepened. He felt like he was floating. Every sharp press of the man's fingers into his lower back, every slick slide across his trapezius, every accidental brush of the heel of his palm against the swell of Harry's arse, feeding into a loop of pleasure-pain-pleasure and just utter brilliance.
It was a few days before Halloween that Harry and Draco noticed James sitting eating breakfast with a dark scowl.
in a Malfoy collection.
But it was sitting in a cosy corner of The Spicy Coconut cafe having a smoothie, on the day before Harry was to fly home, that Malfoy finally kissed him. Harry had merely been talking (again) about how brilliant Malfoy's massage had been and had mused that if he ever returned to England he could make a fortune, and that actually he wasn't even sure if there were any massage places in Wizarding London, and someone with Malfoy's obvious talents would be in high demand, and when he looked up from the straw he'd been swirling through his drink he realised Malfoy was staring at him with an odd expression.

Potter chuckled to himself. "Look at us. Old school rivals, both heavily preggers, and somehow fancying each other, after all that’s happened.”
Potter’s hand moved lower and he found and loosened the tie of Draco’s top. It fell away easily, exposing his pale skin, and Potter spread his palms across the expanse of Draco’s belly. Potter pulled back a step to look at him, eyes dark.
The following year Teddy begged for two straight months for them all to dress up, and so Harry finally agreed to it one evening when he was in his family feels after he’d played the whole afternoon with Teddy and James and the toy broom. Though Draco knew Harry wasn't

Draco spelled a dozen small, neat stitches along the tear, his brow furrowed in very serious concentration as Teddy watched his every move.
As Mrs Potts and Hestia served their tea—a perfectly hot, fragrant Assam that had Harry closing his eyes and sighing—Kreacher began explaining how he had found Mrs Potts in distress, and how he had remembered Hestia from many years prior. It turned out she had served the Black family at Grimmauld Place long ago, before being gifted to Mistress 'Cissa on her wedding day by the noble Black matriarch, Walburga. As Kreacher was labouring the countless and varied virtues of Mistress Walburga—the portrait of whom Harry strongly suspected had been surreptitiously secreted in Kreacher's own quarters—Harry's eyes roved over the positively lavish spread before him, searching. There had to be
After that the pregnancy went fairly smoothly, and the main worry for Draco—aside from Teddy starting Hogwarts; neither he nor Harry could believe how fast time had flown—was whether he'd be showing by October and what size costume he'd need to make for himself. But, as Harry kept reminding him, he was a dab hand at alteration charms, so there was no need to fret. But fret Draco did. He wanted it all to be perfect.
They moved together to the thump of the music. Harry felt like all the lights were revolving around just them, two figures in the centre of the floor, and all he was aware of was the giddy happiness moving through him, filling him up.
A series of tiny green stones were set in a swirling pattern on a gun-metal grey band whose faceted edge caught the light with a glimmer as dark as the night sky.
“Well, now I’m not in the mood.” He steps into his pants, covering up that stupid, perfect arse. “They’ll just need to wait for the next prompt.”

"What?" Draco was having trouble remembering what they were talking about, drunk as he was on vodka and sweet liqueur and the dark emerald of Potter's eyes.
Potter stood in the foyer and removed his wet cloak. His dripping face wasn’t giving anything away.
Draco’s pulse sped up. Merlin, anything got him hot these days, so his cock was already twitching just from Potter’s words. He felt mortified. He hadn't meant to hint at…

“Good work, you two. The Plimpies look cooked to perfection." They both beamed at him. He added, "A little grating of lemon zest over the top—use the microplane—and you can call service.”
They share a glance, and Draco knows they are both agreed that there is something extremely fishy going on. They do their best to calm Joanna down, her hiccups eventually subsiding entirely.
“Good evening, Potter,” he called, crossing the road. Draco needed to go about this carefully; remain polite and avoid confrontation. “The annual Tidy Streets contest is coming up in a few days. I was wondering if you knew about it?”
Which tracked. Clearly Potter still couldn't stand the sight of him, even after all this time. Why would
"Of course I did."
“Er… Not how I ever imagined you? I dunno.” Potter shrugged. Draco was sure there was an insult in there, though he felt a little zip of satisfaction that Potter had been imagining him at all. Potter poured himself some rooibos tea, then cleared his throat. "So, when are you due?"
"Right, kids!" Harry said decisively. "If you all go check those animals aren't eating our breakfast, we'll be down in two shakes of a Niffler's tail, and we'll find that remote. Then we can all watch The Wizard of Oz together...
"Very." Potter grinned and bit into a rice cake. It looked dry.

happy. Gabe had organised a party and invited Greg and Pansy and Blaise (and thankfully none of his own 'high fashion' friends), and they’d had the best time eating cake and drinking Pimm’s on the rooftop patio and bitching about work. He had fussed over Draco all evening, topping up his drink, touching his wrist, tucking wayward strands of hair behind his ear.
"We've already searched the kitchen from top to bottom and used Summoning charms to try to find them," Harry said, exasperated. "What real good will looking around the rest of the house do?"
"Oh, he's my Mind Healer," Harry replied, standing. "Michael Rotchburns."
"You look gorgeous too, Draco. My very own Peter Pan. You better not run off with Wendy though.”
“Wow. Look at the place!” Harry said, only just noticing. “You did all this? It’s brilliant.” He strode over to Draco and embraced him, angling his face upward toward Draco’s, asking silently for a kiss. Draco didn't deny him. They lingered together, cupping each other’s faces and kissing and smiling and rubbing noses. Then Draco asked again, “What was I right about?”
"And to think," Harry laughed, "you were mental enough to take on three more, just because you love me." The waistband of Harry's pants slapped loudly against his hip and he yelped.
To Draco's astonishment, Potter reached across the table and placed a hand over his, the dry warmth and firm grip so profoundly amicable and comforting, Draco could hardly breathe. He looked up and met Potter's eyes, which didn't help the not-breathing situation, as he was met with an intensity he wasn't expecting.
When he finally found the correct ward, a Mediwix with a large badge stating ‘Duty Matron: Madam Chlora Kite' blocked his entry, informing him visiting hours were strictly 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., and Draco took no shame in shoving his sizable bump at her and announcing that he was Harry Potter's emergency contact. She seemed highly displeased and had the cheek to ask “Who,

Teddy tentatively handed the stuffed gnome over, and Draco cradled it in his hands delicately, as if he was a sick infant. Then he laid the gnome down carefully on the blanket and withdrew his mokeskin pouch. Teddy’s eyes widened as he pulled various items out of the tiny bag.

I haven’t really had one of those since school, since Ginny, and that went cold very quickly after the war." He was still holding Draco’s hand, but he was straightening his fingers and relaxing them over and over. "I’ve just… Well, I went through a lonely, angry period a few years back.

“They do sound nice. But what’s the catch?”
Draco visited Harry during the week, bringing takeaway pizza and non-alcoholic fizz, and they kissed in the hall, and ate the pizza in the kitchen, and listened to nineties grunge in the sitting room, and talked for hours lying on the bed in Harry’s room. And despite kissing a good deal more between Harry’s sheets, all they ended up doing there was sleep.
Instead, he carefully untangles himself from Potter, and slips into the bathroom, already mourning the loss of skin on skin. The hot spray from the shower helps a little, as does his hand sliding smoothly over his cock, and by the time he's come—legs shaking and lips hissing Potter's name—and dried off and got dressed, Potter's up and wandering about the room in his bare feet and unbuttoned Auror uniform.
Eoin was up next, and he had difficulty keeping his Patronus non-corporeal. It seemed to want to stubbornly remain as a boa constrictor, which had everyone sucking their teeth in concern. When it began wrapping itself tightly around the babe, Fordus stepped in with a diplomatic "Excellent work, Eoin, though could benefit from some slight finessing." Draco exchanged a glance with Potter, who was snickering behind his hand.
"Then tell me. How
It was all a moot point in the end, because no sooner were they dressed when they got an emergency Patronus from Deputy Head Auror Fumblewit informing them they were needed as back-up on a raid. Some scumbag Dark Lord wannabe was practising Necromancy and trying to raise an army of Inferi. They barely had time to grab croissants from the breakfast buffet and stuff them in their robes.
And that's what does it: Potter's breathy, worshipful utterance of Draco's given name. Not to mention the beads of perspiration dripping from Potter's forehead, dripping onto Draco's cheek, sliding down to soak their joined lips in salty sweat. Draco feels the pleasure rising, rushing molten towards that point where they're rubbing together, scratching that beautiful itch that's been building all week—longer, if he's honest. A lot longer.
Potter groaned. “Oh Merlin. Do I have to talk about this?”
He liked knowing that Draco couldn't come without him, that even alone in his room, his pleasure was locked away.
A suitcase that, without his wand, he was very unlikely to be able to get into—Hermione had insisted on charming it closed. He stood up and tried the zip, and sure enough it was stuck fast.
A switch flipped in Harry.
