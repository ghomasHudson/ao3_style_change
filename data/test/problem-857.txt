“Well, let's get to it. And Ron, we'll eat when we get to the other place. Try not to focus on your stomach," I said. We headed around the arcade; Pansy and Draco following me over to the hunting game in the corner, Theo headed towards the racing game, and Ron and Hermione headed towards the pinball machine.
I didn't answer, just continued to drink my tea as the silence settled around us. Suddenly, he looked down at his watch and stood up. “Alright, we need to get going," he said.
“I shouldn't tell you this, and Dean will probably be angry at me for saying anything, but you should know that Draco's been in St. Mungo's for the last week."
“Oh, is your mother coming for a visit? Darling, you know I don't like it when you spring surprises on me like this," I said, playing along with his ploy. Ron's face was turning red when he realized what we were doing; he was trying hard not to laugh. I turned my head to look at Draco.
I followed his magic, until I found him sitting in the highest level of bleachers, facing in a southwest direction, magic billowing around him. I took a deep breath and cautiously moved towards him. He turned his head at my approach, his magic slowing as he tried to rein it in. I slowly sat down about six inches away from him, and I reached out my hand. When I made contact with his knee, he sucked in a breath and his magic settled as my touch calmed him.
Green flames roared to life as Draco emerged from the fireplace. “Oh, Harry," he said. He dropped to his knees beside me, one hand snaking around my waist to rest his palm against my stomach through my shirt. After a moment, he quickly tugged my shirt free from my waistband and slipped his hand under my shirt, now resting his palm against my bare skin.
I quickly pasted a smile on my lips. “Looked like you two were having fun out there. Glad to see that your both enjoying yourselves," I said when they reached us.
“She got home a few days ago. She even helped me finish up your room. Although why you want your own room is a mystery to me," I said, with a slight pout on my face. He chuckled for a moment, then started looking for his glasses.
“Yes, I'm well, thank you for asking. By the way, call me Kingsley. Now are we all ready? It's just about time," he said glancing around the room.
The chicken was just about done, so with a flick of my wand, I set the table. The salad bowls flew out from the fridge, and the two candles on the table came to life, producing a soft, romantic glow in the kitchen. The bottle of wine that was sitting in the ice bucket beside the table, rose up and poured into the two wine glasses. I turned back to the stove.
I wasn't sure how long I sat there staring at the floor, but suddenly I heard a knock on the door. “Harry? Harry let me in please," Ron's voice came through the door. I was shocked, but I got up and pulled the door open.
I sat and watched as the candles burned down. They had started out nice and long, and now they were about halfway gone, the melted wax in white puddles on the table. I took another drink from my wine. I picked up my silverware and began to eat. I heard the sound of someone apperating into the apartment. I glanced up at the clock one more time. 8:23 p.m.
I picked up my pack and pulled a cigarette from it. I lit it with a small flick of my lighter. After releasing the smoke from my throat, I spoke up. “Now, Harry must still be somewhere on the Manor grounds. The wards haven't given me the feeling that someone has left. Did you try his room?"
He met my gaze, his pupils blown wide with lust. “I'm only just getting started," he whispered to me. He rose above me and kissed me. We kissed for several moments before Harry snapped his fingers and summoned the bottle of lubricant. He caught it in his hand and squirted a large dollop on his fingers. He waved his hand and my legs became unbound; unfortunately for me, my arms were still fastened to the headboard. He pushed my legs open. “Bend your knees," he said, rubbing the lube around his fingers
I broke away from the kiss when I felt a stinging sensation across my back. I turned my head to see Blaise with his wand in his hand, staring in our direction with a scowl on his face. When he caught me looking, he turned on his heel and stormed out into the hallway.
I nodded and turned my attention to the fireplace. Harry stepped towards the fireplace and took some floo powder from the pot. He threw it down in the hearth and called out, “Ministry of Magic, Minister's office." He disappeared in a swirl of green flames.
That got his attention. Harry slowly pulled the sheet down and sat up. “Your mother is home from St. Mungo's?" He asked.
We were halfway through our third game, and it was Draco's turn, when I decided to get us all something to eat and drink. I took everyone's Muggle identification cards that Hermione had taken them to get a couple weeks ago, got everyone's drink order, and made my way to the bar. After ordering the drinks, I ordered two large pizzas from the bowling alley's kitchen to be delivered to our table. I thanked the bartender, then I picked up the tray of drinks and headed back to the others.
Without a word, I set the bucket aside and stood up. I quickly pulled the robes over my head, then I unbuttoned my shirt and pulled it off. I sat back down and lowered myself until I was laying on the exam bed. Dean gently touched his wand to my abdomen, then moved it in counter-clockwise motion, chanting softly in Latin. When he had made a complete circle, my abdomen glowed with a soft blue light. He did it again, and got the same result.
“Not necessarily. How about this; I'll move out of the Manor for now so that we can work on becoming friends. If, and when, we decide to get back together, I'll move back in," Harry suggested.
“A Royal Waterfall? No body has ordered a Royal Waterfall in weeks. I don't even know how to make a Royal Waterfall," Krista said.
I hesitated, before I slid one finger into him slowly. He hissed slightly at the intrusion. I paused, fearing that I was hurting him. “Am I hurting you?" I asked desperately.
“Magical exhaustion. When I lost control of my temper and my magic went haywire, that took a lot of energy from me. I'll be fine, but I need rest," he said, before his body went limp in my arms. “Man, I haven't felt like this in a long time," he groaned.
“Now that's something that I never thought would come out of Draco's mouth," came a voice. I turned my head. My jaw dropped in surprise;Theodore Nott, whom I hadn't seen since my disastrous birthday, was standing at the end of the table.
A pure white light spread from the palms of Dean's hands. The light flowed over Harry's body, small tendrils disappearing into his ears. The harder Dean concentrated, the brighter the light shown. Harry let out a soft sound as the light intensified around him. Slowly, one by one, the wounds that weren't really there began to disappear from Harry's body.
Hermione let out a soft sigh, which brought my attention back to her. “Harry, I don't want you to feel bad about it. I understand how you feel, but you're doing what he wants and that's a good thing. Let's just put it out of our minds. Today is supposed to be a fun day."
Ginny brings Ron to Harry's and Charlie's place in an effort to make Harry and Ron talk to each other.
Harry stood from his chair and followed Dempsey from the room. I sighed as I watched him leave. I turned my attention back to my breakfast.
“Sleeping in the bed with me isn't the same thing. And the last couple of nights you've slept in the guest room." The tears started to spill down my cheeks.
“I got it. I start my training on Monday. I'll be working in the children's ward," I exclaimed excitedly.
He twisted to disapparate, but nothing happened. He tried again, with the same result. He stepped into the green flames that were still burning. “The Burrow!" He shouted. Again, nothing happened.
“My bedroom," I answered. I put my hands on the serpents and pushed the doors to my room open. I stepped to the side and allowed him to enter.
Without a word, Draco came over to the couch and began to gather up the boxes. He began to stack them into the empty fireplace. When he had four or five boxes stacked, he drew his wand and preformed a sticking charm to keep the boxes together. He took a pinch of floo powder from the pot on the mantle and threw it in. “The Serpent's Den," he called, naming his bedroom. He stepped into the green flames and disappeared with the boxes.
“No matter what the consequences are for my actions tonight, I don't want to walk away," he said. He used his grip on my hand to pull me against him.
“So, you know he did that on purpose?" I asked. I stepped over to the sink and leaned against the wall next to him.
“Well, since even I haven't heard anything from Harry since your party, I was thinking we could start at Rainforest Falls and see if anyone there knows something."
I quickly relayed the message, then watched as the Tahoe put its blinker on and pulled over to the side of the road. Harry drove past them and then Hermione pulled in behind us. Harry turned a corner, then he continued down the road.
I reached over and grabbed half of Draco's sandwich. I brought it to my plate and set it down. I picked up half of my sandwich and placed it on his plate. Draco smiled at me. Ron rolled his eyes at us.
I leaned forward and pressed my lips to his. “Make me forget him, Draco. Help me forget the events of the last forty five minutes," I whispered against his lips. He wrapped his arms around me and deepened the kiss. I shifted the way I was sitting, so that I was straddling his hips. We kissed for several moments before I was aware of Draco sliding down on the sofa until he was flat on his back and I was laying on top of him.
“I feel great. There's no more pain and I bet that if I looked down right now, I wouldn't even see where it was. Thank you Draco."
The familiar sickening swirl of color surrounded me as my head spun through the flames. When the spinning stopped, I found myself staring into the office of Kingsley Shacklebolt. He was sitting at his desk, his quill scribbling away on the parchment in front of him. He had turned his head at the sound of the flames bursting to life in his fireplace. “Harry my boy. Good to see you again," he said, putting his quill down. He slid from his chair to kneel in front of the fireplace.
“I'm awake. Can we talk for a minute, just you and I?" The words came out hesitantly before the stag faded away.
“Are you cheating on me Charlie?" I asked, looking down at the floor. His silverware clattered against his plate.
“This whole situation, he's only doing it to make you happy. He told you he was fine, because he knew that's what you wanted him to say. Before he left, he left me a note. He said seeing you with Chase felt like his heart had been ripped out."
He tightened his arm around me. “Yes, I'm aware of what I said. Does it bother you that I used that word?"
He held up my cigarette pack, still laughing his head off. He took a few deep breaths to gain control of himself. “Well, want to know what made me laugh? You and I smoke the exact same brand," he laughed.
“The books on the bookcase, the items on the mantle, and some clothing items that are still in the wardrobe," Charlie said just as Draco reappeared again.
“I think that's kinda sweet," Hermione said. I noticed that neither Draco nor I had mentioned exactly what Narcissa had said when we talked to her.
“Draco is NOT a Death Eater! Unlike you, he couldn't do Voldemort's wishes; it made him sick to his stomach! I won't tolerate hearing another word about him like that, especially from you! You're his Fucking Father!" Harry yelled. He took a deep breath, trying to control his rising temper.
“We can go to my room. It's just down the hall so you'll be close if Harry needs you," I said. I stood up and led them from the room. We traveled down the hall towards my room, but I changed direction at the last moment and opened the door across from mine. This room was smaller than mine, but it would accommodate the five of us nicely. Stepping through the door, Hermione quickly cast a cleaning charm on the room. She waved her wand and a few chairs appeared next to the sofa near the fireplace.
I looked down, unable to meet his gaze. Harry and I were silent for a moment. I was still holding his hand, gently rubbing my thumb across his knuckles. “So, what happens now? Where do we go from here? Is there still an ´us'?" Harry asked.
“Well if your not having sex with me, what am I supposed to think? I just want an answer," I screamed. I brushed away the tears still streaming down my cheeks.
“That's a lie!" I snapped. I yanked on the buttons of my shirt and two of them snapped off. I quickly fixed them with my wand.
He turned his head to look at me. “I thought you were different, Dray. I was stupid to think that things have changed since Hogwarts," he said. With that he twisted on the spot and disapparated.
“All the good looking ones are either gay, taken, or both," she said. I recognized her voice as the one that had spoken when we had entered.
“How could you do this to me? Does the last two months mean nothing to you? Does this morning mean nothing?" He asked, before waving his hand and summoning his clothes from the wardrobe.
. I tilted my head, looking up at the underside of his strong chin. I pressed a kiss to the column of his throat, before I pushed myself slightly away from his embrace.
With that, he stood up and picked up his guitar. He headed towards the house as I sat there, watching him walk away. He paused when he reached the door, then he glanced at me over his shoulder.  “I still want to hear how things go with your interview at St. Mungo's," he said, before he disappeared inside.
Draco glanced at me over his shoulder. “You need to sign in, Harry. This floor is one where they use a lot of strong magic. Visitors must sign in, just in case something happens." He held the quill out to me.
I wasn't sure who made the first move, but suddenly, our lips were pressed together, one of his hands buried in my hair, the other wrapped around my waist. My arms wrapped around his neck as he deepened the kiss, his tongue sliding across my lower lip, begging for entrance.
Concerned, I released my Healer's energy and let it surround him. Besides the trembling in his hands, his body was tense, his breathing shaky. I recognized those symptoms. “Harry, I didn't know you smoked," I said.
His body relaxed and he seemed to drift off to sleep. The light from Dean's hands slowly began to fade from around Harry's body. When the light was gone, Dean slowly opened his eyes and sat up. Dean raised his wand and the chains binding Harry fell away. Harry promptly rolled over and snuggled deeper into his bedding. Dean breathed out a soft sigh.
I didn't answer. We sat there in silence, the only sound to be heard was the crackling of the fire. Charlie rubbed his hand up and down my back, offering what comfort he could.
“Are you going to fill us in on what we're actually doing today, or are you just going to leave us in the dark?" Pansy asked, sliding onto the bench next to Harry. I slid onto the bench next to Ron, Hermione on his other side. I absent mindedly noticed that we were all dressed in denim shorts and tank tops. I had thought about hiding my Dark Mark when Hermione had told us how to dress, but she said the Muggle world would just think it was a cool tattoo, whatever that was. I turned my focus back to the conversation going on around me.
“You told us that Ron saw him kissing Blaise, but did you actually talk to Draco about the kiss? Did you stop to think that maybe he didn't want to kiss Blaise?" Seamus asked walking over to a box of books and sitting down on it.
“As much as I'm enjoying that Harry, we really don't have the time luv. You know we have to head to Dad's birthday party," he said. I stared at him for a moment, then went back to placing kisses on his body, getting dangerously close to his erection. He let out a soft chuckle before his hands caught my arms and pulled me up his body. When I was across his chest, he pulled me down into a deep kiss, his tongue sliding between my lips ever so softly. I sighed and relaxed against him.
She stuck her hand in the flames and grabbed something. She pulled. A moment later, Ron stumbled out. He rounded on Ginny in an instant. “I told you, I didn't want to come here! Why can't you mind your own business?" He screamed.
I let out a sigh of my own, before I unbuckled my seatbelt and opened the door. “There's no need to wait for me. I'll floo home from here."
“From George. He didn't know what I was up to. I just asked him if he had good pictures of Fred." I answered. George blushed slightly.
He looked at me for a moment, then he nodded. I motioned for him to move over to the wall. He shut the tap off and leaned against the wall. I turned him so that his back was braced against it. I took a step closer.
I nodded and led Draco through the bar. Once out the back door of the bar, I practically had to drag him to the car. He slumped in my arms, trying to shuffle forward to get to the car. Thankfully, I made it to the car without him falling over. I pulled open the door and pushed him into the seat. I snapped my fingers and his legs pulled themselves up into the car. With another snap of my fingers, his seatbelt fastened itself.
“Your name is Draco, which does mean dragon. I remember that time Ron and Hermione came to visit and you were sleeping on the sofa in the sunroom. Ron got the bright idea to tickle you. You became slightly violent when you woke," he answered. He reached out and traced the dragon's wing with his finger.
He must have noticed my silence. He turned around and I let my eyes travel around his throat. There was another one on the right side of his neck.
I had just finished placing the blanket over my lap when Kreacher reappeared, holding a tray with my breakfast. He looked at the blanket for a moment, eying it like he had the first time he had ever seen it, shaking his head at the way it was wrinkled. He balanced the tray in one hand, before running his free hand over the blanket to smooth out the wrinkles. He then placed the tray over my lap. He bowed again, then disappeared with another pop. I picked up a piece of toast and nibbled on the edge of it, watching the flames dance in the fireplace.
I twisted on the spot and apparated in front of the bedroom doors. I took a deep breath before pushing the doors open. Harry was standing at the bed, throwing things into his trunk and suitcases. He glared at me when he noticed me. He pulled open the drawer of his nightstand and threw a couple more things into his trunk.
“ You're lying, Charlie! If you had brought him here because he was drunk, your bottle of lubricant wouldn't be on the floor!" I yelled. I pointed to the side of the bed. His eyes traveled in the direction that I pointed and he let out a soft curse.
I looked around at the building we had landed in; the bare stone walls and floor of the place sent a shiver down my spine. At least it wasn't crawling with Dementors anymore. Kingsley motioned us forward. We followed him through the door and into a brightly lit room. This room was much more friendlier and warmer than the one we had entered through. A witch sat at a desk in the middle of the room, looking up at us as we entered. There was a door to the left of the desk and a door to the right.
“Are you referring to when I said I had something special planned for your birthday?" When I nodded, he chuckled and continued, “Part of it. Now sit up. I want to give you your present."
He looked up at me. “Draco, you may think that this Mark is what made you a Death Eater. That's not true. What makes a Death Eater is your heart. You joined Voldemort in an effort to protect your family, not for power like the rest of them." He pressed his lips against it again, before rising back up over me. He leaned down.
“Who works here?" I asked, looking through the glass. I followed his gaze and my eyes landed on a young man with honey brown hair. He was talking to people seated at a table.
Before I could respond, Draco caught my hand and shoved me into the fireplace with my boxes. He threw some floo powder down and shouted ´The Serpent's Den'. Everything vanished in a swirl of color.
“You're right, I shouldn't be focusing on the negative aspect of this. What I should focus on, is how Draco will react when we get to the bowling alley," I replied just as a large cheer went up; Pansy had made a mistake on the dance, thereby allowing Draco to win. I watched as Ron begrudgingly handed a few coins to Theo.
With a lump in my throat, I dropped my hand away and turned my back to the mantle. “Charlie, I can't take any of them. The memories they bring back hurt too much." My voice was a little husky.
“I can change that, but I don't think you're ready for it," Harry said. He pulled the car into the parking lot behind the bar. When he shut off the engine, he seemed to notice that a group of guys stood by the back of the building. He stared at them for a moment, before he turned back to me.
My feet touched the ground, my cloak blowing around me from the wind and I heard the angry clucking from the chickens as they scrambled out of my way. I opened my eyes and there in front of me was the Burrow. The seven story house all lopsided and everything stood up in all its glory. I smiled and began to make my way to the door. Before I reached it, the door was flung open and I found myself staring at Bill, the eldest Weasley brother. He looked the same as the last time I saw him. The scars across his face from getting attacked by the werewolf, Fenrir Greyback. His long hair was pulled back in his usual ponytail and he still wore an earring with a snake fang hanging from his left ear.
“Thought about it. Unfortunately, that would make things even more uncomfortable between me and my ex. You see, my most recent ex-boyfriend is Ron's older brother Charlie."
“I came to visit Mother. She's been having bad nightmares lately. What about you? I mean, this is an odd place to run into you."
I emerged from my closet with the robe draped over my arm. There was a soft knock on my door. “Enter, Poppy," I called. The doors opened and three house elves came in. Poppy was carrying the tray with the tea. The two male house elves behind her were carrying a larger tray loaded with covered dishes. I directed them to carry the trays to the end of my bed, next to Harry's clothes. I noticed that they were careful not to look at him. The three of them bowed before me and left the room, Poppy closing the doors behind her.
“Oh, God, Draco. Fuck, that feels good," Harry moaned. I began to move my hand slowly up and down his shaft, as I took him a little deeper into my mouth. He tangled his fingers through my hair, thrusting up his hips.
“Harry, he told us that he broke up with you because you slept with Malfoy. Although how you could do that is beyond me," Ginny said from her place by the bed.
“Harry, that sounds great. Now, we have to get clearance from Minister Shacklebolt, so we won't be able to go for a couple of days," he said, looking down.
“Well look at that; the Savior loves a Death Eater. There's a nice headline for the Prophet. Now, why don't you run along and find that gay person that dares to call himself my son and get out of here? Merlin knows that I won't miss him when your gone," Father sneered.
Suddenly, the sound of flames bursting to life echoed through the apartment and we looked towards the living room. I could see a green glow. We both stood and made our way into the living room, Charlie's wand in his hand. We entered the living room just as Ginny emerged from the fireplace.
Before I could answer, he turned around and went over to the desk. He grabbed the jacket from the chair, then picked up a wallet and his wand from the desk. He slid the wallet into his pocket and flicked his wand at the bed. From where I was standing, I watched as the comforter straightened up as the bed made itself. As he stepped out the door, he slid the jacket over his shoulders, and tucked his wand into a pocket inside his jacket. He closed the door behind him.
Before I could protest about him not kissing me, he raised his head from my neck and pressed his lips to mine in a hungry kiss. He slid his tongue against my lips. I opened my mouth and his tongue slid in easily. As our tongues danced against each other, Harry's hand came up and cupped the side of my face, angling my head to deepen the kiss.
Harry's grin widened. “Steve, Anton, Randy, and Carlos, this is my boyfriend, Draco Malfoy. Draco, this is Steve Evans," Steve inclined his head, “Anton Dewitt," the brunette closest to the door waved, “Randy Thomas," the other brunette smiled, "and Carlos Madole," Harry finished.
“I came to see you. Your mother told me about what happened," she said, her eyes still on my wrist. “Why would you do this to yourself?" She asked me.
," I said. Flames burst into existence, filling my room with heat and a soft glow. I snapped my fingers, summoning a soft red lap blanket from the foot of my bed. Narcissa had given me the blanket shortly after I had moved in.
“Not sure. We were downstairs when he started screaming. I apparated in here, and found him like this. Now, this is going to sound crazy, but those wounds don't appear to be real, but he cries out if their touched," I said. My heart was pounding, as I tried to think of a way to help him.
He took a deep breath before turning to face me. “He shouldn't talk about you like that. You're his only son."
Jolene rolled her eyes but didn't respond to her sister. I noticed her cheeks were slightly pink and I caught myself wondering if she knew what they were up to.
“Bill and Jason are watching her today. We asked your mum, but she's visiting your dad, Hermione's parents live in Australia, and my parents are in Romania," he answered.
I had the strangest urge to kiss him; and it wasn't the first time during the night that feeling had come over me
“Mother! I'm going to be twenty seven on Saturday. Do you still have to throw me a party every year?" I asked, exasperatedly. Harry snickered from where he was laying next to me on the sofa, his legs across my lap.
Harry and everyone else in the room began singing ´Happy Birthday', Harry holding my hand the entire time. I felt my face heat up as a blush spread across my cheeks. When they were done singing, I leaned forward and blew the candles. I flicked my wand and both cakes were perfectly sliced. Harry grabbed a plate and put a slice of each cake on it. He grabbed two forks and led me away from the table as everyone else converged on it.
“I have every right to be defensive! My boyfriend of almost seven months is accusing me of cheating on him!" He yelled. I flinched and turned away.
Charlie has been coming home late and Harry accuses him of cheating. A heated argument then sends Charlie away and Harry heads out to a bar.
“You know what happened at his party. I explained what happened to you and Dean when I asked if I could stay. He betrayed me and kissed Blaise. I won't stay with someone who can't be faithful," I said, shoving my glasses back on my face.
“Oh come on, Draco. If you were being honest with me, and, yourself, you would have already told me about the date you went on with that guy from the bowling alley. What, are you trying to pretend it didn't happen?"
I dragged the back of my hand across my mouth, wiping off my lips. “You're right. There must be something wrong. Give me about fifteen minutes to get ready, then you can take me there," I said.
I glanced over at him before turning my attention back to the road. I was driving back to Malfoy Manor. We had spent the last three hours with Ron and Hermione. Draco had kissed me several times while we had been there; deep, lingering kisses, and now I was half hard in my jeans.
We stepped out of my room and I closed the door behind me. We made our way down the stairs. “So, Harry, why do you stay here? Why don't you stay at Grimmauld Place?"
Our night had gotten pretty heated after I was in his room. One thing stuck in my memory; Harry closing the door with magic, but not with his wand. Our lips had been locked together and Harry had tumbled us onto his bed, with him landing on top of me. He had broken our kiss and had turned his attention to my neck, biting gently, and kissing his way to my ear. I had turned my head to give him more access to my skin, and saw that the door was wide open. I had whispered to him about the door, and he raised his hand and the door swung shut and I heard the lock click. Last night had lasted longer than our first night had.
“Well, if you want to drink that, you don't have much of an option. I highly doubt that you seen another place to sit," he said, pointing.
“No. I know the spell to activate it. Ever since I became a Healer, I work here on occasion," Draco answered. He waved his wand and the lift shot upwards.
I felt a surge of magic from his hand. In seconds, my stomach settled and I was able to breathe properly without gagging. I leaned back into his embrace, resting my head against his shoulder. He wrapped his other arm around me and stood up, pulling me off the floor with him. He took a few steps, and sat down on his sofa, pulling me onto his lap. He raised his wand and flames burst to life in the fireplace, producing a soft light.
I rested my head against his chest. Behind me, I heard the dishes pile into the dish rack to dry and I also heard the water drain from the sink. I felt relief that he still wanted me; even after I cheated on him.
I watched them standing there, just talking excitedly like they had been friends forever. Without meaning to, I let my eyes flicker over the ride as it was spinning around. Watching the spinning machine as it became a little faster, my stomach twisted again and I lost my battle with my nausea. Making my way to the nearest rubbish bin, I spewed the contents of my stomach into it.
He suddenly turned his head in my direction. He noticed the direction of my gaze and looked down. “It's not what you think Draco. I told you that I fell against a table."
“What happened, Harry?" He asked. He stepped closer to me and placed his hands on my shoulders. In answer, I unzipped my jacket and pulled the collar of my shirt to the side, exposing Draco's hickeys that marked my neck. I was careful not to show the ones that formed a “D" on the left side of my collarbone.
Harry began to kiss his way down my body. He gently traced each scar with his tongue, before moving farther down to my belly button. He dipped his tongue into it, before tracing around the edge with just the tip of his tongue. He moved lower and caught the waistband of my pajama pants and my boxers with his fingers. He pulled them down just enough to free my erection.
I felt Harry smile, before he took one of my balls into his mouth. I groaned softly and arched upwards. Harry kept at it for some time, going back and forth between my balls. Suddenly, his hands were on my hips, and he was rolling me onto my stomach. When he got me in the position he wanted, he pulled me up until I was on my knees on the bed, with my arse up in the air, and my head pillowed on my arms. Before I could question him, I felt his magic as he cast a silent cleansing charm on my arse. My body tingled with expectation.
I made my way towards the sunroom, feeling my gut tighten with every step. I paused outside the door, catching the familiar whiff of tobacco. I pushed open the door and stepped inside, closing the door behind me. Draco looked up from the heavy book in his hands, a cigarette dangling from his lips. He took the cigarette from his mouth and flicked the ashes off the end.
He glanced down at me. “Well, let me put it this way. The more powerful a witch or wizard is, the easier it is to do magic without a wand. My power is a lot greater than it used to be, and the more wandless magic I use, the stronger I become. Let me demonstrate," he said. He raised his free hand and waved it at the hedge to the left. Flowers erupted in a small section of the hedge. Harry waved his hand again and the flowers flew into his hand in a neat bouquet.
Harry leaned closer and briefly wrapped his arms around me. I returned the hug before leaning away. Harry dropped his arms and let out a soft sigh. “I guess we should head inside and explain everything to your mother. Will she be disappointed in my decision?" He asked.
“Open your eyes, Draco," he whispered. I dragged my eyes open to find him kneeling on the bed, rubbing the lube around his shaft. I moaned as I watched his large, tan hand sliding along his shaft. I tugged on my bonds one more time. When they still didn't budge, I once again gave up and just watched the sight in front of me. Harry released his shaft and moved between my legs. I wrapped my legs around his waist as he positioned his dick at my entrance.
“That's the issue. While he didn't cause the wounds directly, he knows that you harmed yourself because of his leaving. Seeing that those are still relatively new, his magic responded," Dean said.
“Harry, if your ex wants to stare at us, let's give him a reason to stare," I said, before I leaned closer and pressed my lips to his. His hand came up to cup the back of my head as he deepened the kiss. His tongue slid across my lips and I opened to him. As our tongues slid against each other, I became lost in the kiss, completely forgetting we were in a restaurant
As he slowly continued to thrust his tongue inside of me, he slowly began to work his fingers into me as well. I groaned when I felt two fingers alongside his tongue, the fingers slowly scissoring apart, stretching me open. Before long, his mouth was completely gone and only his fingers remained inside me, as Harry planted kisses along my spine. He now had three fingers in me, but it wasn't enough for me. “Harry, please," I begged.
I kissed my way down his chest, but stopped when I reached his waistband. I pulled myself away and climbed off the bed. He rose up to watch me as I undid my jeans and shoved them and my boxers down my legs. Still laying on the bed, Draco removed the rest of his clothes as well. I climbed back on the bed and kissing my way along his body.
Ron crawled across the floor and examined the ring that she had spit out. He picked it up gingerly. “'Mione, its your engagement ring."
“That day at your house, about a week after his birthday party, " I answered honestly. I sat up slowly so I wouldn't trigger the nausea.
I stepped from the fireplace, brushing soot from my robes. I glanced around the room to see Harry being released from the Minister's embrace. He turned around and smiled at me. The minister and both of the Aurors in the room turned to look at me.
“It's good to see you Steve, but can you tell me if Carlos is working today?" Hermione asked him. I noticed her hand was in her pocket. I assumed that her fingers were wrapped around her wand.
“Yes, you are. You told me about two hours ago that you are in love with him. Jealousy is natural for those whom we love," Hermione said.
“Arthur, Molly, would you mind if I took my breakfast into the living room? I feel bad that Hermione is all alone out there," I said, suddenly wanting to get away from the table as quickly as I could. I still felt weird about calling them by their names.
“So, do you have any idea where we're going?" I asked Hermione. We had left St. Mungo's about ten minutes, and Hermione still hadn't told me her plan. She had visited me often over the past five days and we had become closer as a result of it.
“Oh dear," Mrs. Weasley said. We quickly headed back into the living room and paused at the sight before us. Bill, Charlie, and Percy were all on their feet. Bill was standing between his younger brothers, arms outstretched to keep them apart. Charlie's hands were balled into fists and Percy was holding a hand to his cheek.
On Jolene's other side, Percy was “whispering" to her about all the things I had accomplished in my life. Sure, his voice was low-pitched, but he was still loud enough that I'm sure most of the table could still hear him. Jolene's face was getting redder, and she just stared at her food.
I shook my head, trying to clear those thoughts out, but with no such luck. Another glance at the clock; 8:01 p.m. I took a bigger gulp from my wine. I pulled my glasses off my face and cleaned them with the bottom of my shirt. I put them back on my face.
“If you really want the truth, Potter, you're asking the wrong person. We both know that Charlie won't tell you the truth, because if he told the truth, we wouldn't be in this situation."
“Yes. I've been wanting to talk to you. Come, sit," Narcissa said. She gestured to the chair next to her bed. I moved forward and sat down. Draco sat down in the chair on the other side of the bed. He placed his hands in his lap and watched us.
With those words, he pulled me into a brief hug. I held onto him for as long as I could. When he started to step back, I reluctantly dropped my arms from around him. Harry stepped away and Disapparated with a small pop. I left Mother alone and headed to the library.
“Draco told me about what happened yesterday. He also told me about how you two are going to try to become friends before you take your relationship further. I think my memories will help you understand him. And I think they'll help you get over your guilt," she answered.
“Well, I completed all my training, but I never took the exam. I guess my heart just wasn't really into it." He still carried the bouquet of flowers he had made appear. I glanced up just as we stepped onto the front steps. The doors of the Manor swung wide open, and there stood Mother.
“I have some in my room. Try not to fall asleep until I get back. I'm gonna go tell Hermione, Ron, and the two Healers from St. Mungo's that you're going to go to sleep." I said. I made my way to the doors, glancing over my shoulder at him. He was relaxed back against the pillows, his eyes watching me carefully.
Mr. Weasley raised his wand and produced several more chairs and two more couches so everyone would have a place to sit while he opened all our gifts. I moved over to one of the other couches and sat down. Charlie was instantly by my side and sitting down right next to me. Percy didn't look to happy about it.
“When I caught a glimpse of him, he was running towards the Quidditch pitch. He might still be somewhere outside," Mother said. She turned back to the parchment in front of her.
I turned around. “Look, Potter, I may dislike you, but even I have a heart. You look like you've been crying and I was curious if you're okay. I don't really like to see people upset."
I thought to myself. I reached out my hands and I began to tickle him. Harry tried not to laugh as he squirmed against the leather of the sofa. His book fell from his hands as I increased my tickling. His laughter broke through; deep belly laughs that filled the room as I continued to tickle him.
She sighed. “I would have done so if I could have. In pureblood families, only the Head of the family has any say whatsoever. If I had left, Lucius could have had me thrown in Azkaban for leaving without his permission. Same thing with divorce; purebloods can only divorce if the Patriarch wants it. Now my family didn't abide by that, but Lucius' did." Shock flowed through me, but before I could comment, the memory solidified, showing a different moment from the past.
“So, you want honesty from me, but you don't seem to want to be honest with me," he said, not looking at me.
“Well, look what the wind blew in," said one of the three hostesses that were standing by the podium. One of them left the podium and threw her arms around Harry. He reluctantly released my hand and returned her embrace.
I pulled my hand away from his. “I'm not jealous, Draco. I just have something on my mind." I said. I forced myself to relax.
Seamus ran his hand through his hair and looked  over at me. “I'm only going to tell you what Dean told me about it...Draco was admitted to St. Mungo's early last Sunday morning with both of his wrists badly bleeding. After examining the wounds, they discovered that the wounds were self inflicted. I don't know the whole story, but Dean overheard Mrs. Malfoy saying to a healer that Draco's boyfriend had broken up with him. Don't you see, he didn't want your relationship with him to be over. You need to talk to him."
“I honestly don't know. I haven't looked at what the house elves brought. It all smells delicious though." I lifted off the lids that were on the dishes. I uncovered eggs, toast, sausage and sweet roles. With a wave of my wand, I divided the food onto two plates. Harry reached for a plate and pulled it closer to him.
“Alright dear. Now, you four, into the kitchen," Mrs. Weasley said, waving her hands towards the kitchen. Without a word, we all headed into the kitchen. As we entered, I finally noticed the Expanding Charm around the room. Not counting Bill's wedding, the last time the Weasley family had all gathered at the house had been when Mr. Weasley had gotten tickets to the Quidditch World Cup. Back then, we ate on tables outside in the backyard. Now, everyone could sit around the table comfortably.
He glanced at me over his shoulder as he tugged the jeans over his hips. He fastened the snap on his jeans before he turned to face me. “Yeah, I got a hold of my boss and he needs me to come in tonight. Actually, he sounded sorta desperate for me to come in," he said as he reached for the belt laying across his bed. He threaded it through his belt loops, never taking his eyes away from me.
He let out a soft groan as my magic began to take effect. I began to move my hand slowly around the bruise. He let out a little moan and I opened my eyes. His eyes were closed and his head was thrown back against the wall.
“She said she hasn't seen him since he ran from her study earlier. Ron and I are headed to his parents house for the evening and we just wanted to tell Harry goodbye."
I smiled. They had told me when they first found out that Hermione was pregnant that they wanted me to be the godfather to their baby. Their baby was now my second godchild. I was also the godfather to Professor Lupin's son, Teddy, who was being raised by his grandmother, Andromeda.
As Harry and I stepped from the fireplace, Harry practically collapsed in my arms. “Harry are you alright? What's going on with you?" I asked.
“You followed him everywhere and when you couldn't follow him in person, you tracked his every move with the Map. And let's not forget that you visited him every night in the hospital wing after the bathroom incident. Doesn't that sound like an obsession to you?"
Before Draco could respond, Ron tapped him on the should and pointed to the lane. Draco sighed, before he rose from the table to go take his turn. Ron waited until Draco was up at the lane before he turned to me. “That's bullocks Harry. Saying you're not jealous. You just got pissed off because some other guy was flirting with him. Don't you think that is jealousy?"
“You don't have to say it. I'm a Legilimens. If I open myself up, I can find out on my own what you can't bring yourself to say." He looked at me, waiting for my response.
“Hermione, I was not obsessed with Draco. I was merely trying to prove that he was up to something. And I was right after all," I said, turning to face her.
“I know what their trying to do. Their trying to set us up together. You seem like a nice girl and everything, but your not really my type," I said. I looked down, not wanting to see disappointment on her face. I dug into my food.
“Harmless flirting? Draco, you have at least three hickeys forming on your neck," I accused, pointing.
When he reached the top of my thigh, he paused for a moment, then began kissing his way down my other leg. My erection was getting painfully tight, but Harry seemed in no hurry to get near it. Instead, he seemed to be teasing me and we both were enjoying it. He kissed his way back up my leg and across my lower stomach. Finally,
Harry raised his head, breathing heavily as he looked down at me. “If you really want me to stop, push me away. I can't resist you anymore, and I'm not even going to try," he said.
Charlie glanced at Draco for a moment, then looked down at the boxes. “Yeah, I thought it would be easier for you. There are still things around the bedroom and here in the living room that I wasn't sure you would want, so I left them." He looked back at me.
“If you don't believe him, Harry, let him show you," Hermione said. She reached out and gently patted his hand. He raised his eyes and gave her a watery smile.
“I think Blaise just hit me with a stinging hex. I'm gonna go talk to him. He's been acting weird lately," I said. I slid off his lap and followed Blaise out the door. I made my way down the corridor and found him in the entryway, staring out the open doors at the grounds.
“Well, to tell you the truth Harry, with the right spells and potions in place, and if I find the right person that I want to father my child, I can sufficiently give birth to my own kid. I learned that at St. Mungo's," I said, blushing.
We made our way to the exit, Harry's arms draped across mine and Pansy's shoulders like he didn't have a care in the world. I tried not to focus on how good it felt to have his arm around me, but I couldn't help the little tingle I felt in my stomach. After we were outside the gates, Harry dropped his arm from my shoulders and led Pansy in the direction of the vehicles. The two of them were whispering to each other before Harry threw his head back and laughed. They climbed into the Lamborghini and the rest of us climbed into the Tahoe. In just minutes, we were pulling out of the parking lot.
“Be right there Harry," came his response from the bedroom. I let my eyes travel over the living room and I noticed the stack of boxes piled up next to the couch. I stepped over to them. The top box was full of my pictures that had been around the apartment. I closed the lid on the box.
He pulled away from the kiss and looked down at me, both of us panting slightly. He glanced at the lubricant bottle in my hand. A small grin formed on his face. “Well, Harry. You want to be on Top or Bottom?" He asked me.
Harry choked on the chip in his mouth. He quickly swallowed some water. “You want me to move into your house?"
“Harry wouldn't let me explain. He believed what he saw through Legilimency of Ron's and Blaise's minds. He saw the kiss, but didn't see that I wasn't a willing participant in that kiss."
“If you are not cheating on me, where did those hickeys come from?" I asked, pointing to his neck. He raised his hand up to it.
I loaded my plate, my bowl of oatmeal, and my cup of tea onto the tray. I stood from my seat. Charlie glanced at me briefly, before quickly looking away again. I grabbed the tray and made my way to the living room.
“You know, the bruise on your collarbone doesn't even touch the one on your neck, Charlie! If it came from the dragon's tail, it would be consistent."
Ron had his wand in his hand when I looked over at him. “Ron, wait. This isn't what it looks like," I said as I shoved Blaise away from me. I fell silent as Ron pointed his wand at me.
“Harry, you are moving into Malfoy Manor this morning, and Mother does not tolerate tardiness of any kind."
I glanced at Draco when he let out a deep sigh. There was a far away look in his eyes that I had seen several times at the bar. “Draco, is everything ok?"
He broke the kiss and pushed me away. I opened my eyes and looked at him. His eyes had darkened more, his cheeks were flushed. We were both breathing heavily. Without a word, he pulled up the edge of his boxers and pulled up his jeans and re-fastened them. Without looking at me, he moved over to the sink and turned the tap back on.
As I tugged on my black jeans, I heard the sound of the bathroom door closing. I sighed. Charlie and I have been together for six months now and the rest of the Weasley family still didn't know. They knew I was gay; something the Daily Prophet couldn't resist posting when they had caught me coming out of the Three Broomsticks with my last boyfriend, Ernie Macmillan. Ron had taken it kinda hard that I never told him the truth, but him and the rest of the family still accepted me. Well, maybe not all; I hadn't seen Percy since the news broke out that I was gay, and I'm still not sure how he thinks. I sighed again as I pulled on a red t-shirt with a large black dragon on the front. Ron had given it to me after the Tri-Wizard Tournament to remind me of the dragon I had faced in the first task.
Percy's ears turned as red as his hair and his eyes narrowed. He sat down abruptly on the other couch. Bill quickly stood up and moved to one of the chairs. Penelope shot him a dirty look before taking the seat next to Percy.
He pulled me down on top of him. Instead of kissing his mouth, I kissed the underside of his jaw and made my way to his neck. I bit him hard in the delicate skin between his neck and shoulder. He groaned as I sucked on the spot, running my tongue over it in a soothing gesture. I bit him a couple more times before I made my way further down his body. I kissed his belly button and dipped my tongue into it. I slipped my fingers under the waistband of his jeans and looked up at him questionably.
“You know what, Draco? I didn't want to push you away. I was ready to drag you to the floor and I don't think you would have stopped me if I had."
The lift came to a halt and the door opened. I stared at him for a moment, then stepped out of the lift. He followed me. Before we got away from the lift, I caught his arm. “I don't believe that, Draco. You're not a Death Eater. You may have gotten the Dark Mark, but you never had the strength to do what they did."
Regret washed over me as I trailed my fingers higher up his chest, gently touching each of the four scars, the largest one extending from the left side of his collarbone down to the bottom of his right ribcage; that was where the full strength of the curse had struck him. I buried my face deeper into his neck as I fought back the urge to cry, knowing that I was the one responsible for the permanent damage to his skin.
After showering, I dressed in jeans and a pale green t-shirt. As I emerged from the bathroom, rubbing a towel against my hair, I was greeted by the sight of an old, wizened house elf making my bed. My personal house elf; Kreacher. I had inherited him when I had inherited Grimmauld Place after Sirius' death. He had worked at Hogwarts until I had moved into the Manor. When he had found out that I was living in the house of Narcissa Black Malfoy, he readily came to the Manor, vowing only to serve me. His bat-like ears curved towards his back with tufts of grey hair sticking out of them. His long nose pointed towards his chin and it looked like there was a permanent scowl on his face. For clothes,  though he was technically a free house elf, he insisted on wearing a blood red pillowcase embroidered with the Black family crest. He had used gold colored thread and had sown my initials into the bottom corner.
“Harry, do you actually realize that you called me your boyfriend back there?" I asked, feeling self-consious. I turned to look up at him.
I froze in my tracks and slowly turned to look at him. He was sitting on the bed, green eyes now smoldering behind his glasses that were now on his face. “What did you say?" I asked timidly.
Carlos let his eyes travel over me briefly, before turning his attention back to Harry. “Well, he's a lot better looking than that red head that you were dating," he said before crushing out his cigarette, and heading back into the bar.
“Oh for Merlin's sake!" He snapped. His hands moved to the snap of his jeans. He undid the button and the zipper. He eased the jeans down slightly and pulled down the edge of his boxers. “Does that really look like someone hit me?"
“But to use an Unforgivable Curse on a twelve year old boy? Was that something his father did to Lucius?"
He rolled off of me and we both just laid there panting, trying to get ourselves under control. Harry snapped his fingers and my arms were released from the headboard. I slowly lowered my arms, glad to ease the stiffened muscles.
“Fine. I couldn't admit at that time that I was in love with Dean. But I have him now and that's whats important to me. You had the man you loved and you pushed him away," Seamus snapped.
His hand grabbed my arm and he spun me around to face him. I yanked my arm from his grasp and folded my arms across my chest. “What do you want Charlie?" I snapped.
By the time the pizzas were delivered to the table, Chase had come back, and now he didn't seem in any hurry to leave. He straddled the chair next to Draco's, where they sat at a second table. I tried to squash my feelings every time I glanced in their direction, but it was getting harder and harder with every glance I spared them.
I was about to drop the subject, when I noticed a faint bruise peaking out from the top of his collar. It was on the back of his neck, and it looked very much like a hickey. I knew it hadn't come from me; I usually leave hickeys on his chest not his neck.
“Here's what I'm sure of: I want you and I know you want me. Now here's what I'm gonna do; I'm gonna walk out of this bar. Next move is up to you."
“I'll have you know that I've rebuilt the Malfoy reputation after what you did. We fell from grace in the wizarding world, and now, because of what I did, Mother and I can show ourselves to the wizarding world without fear."
“Seriously, Ron? Can't you ever stop thinking about food?" I asked as Harry dropped his arms and grabbed my hand instead. Ron shook his head as Harry led me over to the table where the two cakes sat. On the icing of the vanilla cake, a green serpent was slithering around the words ´Happy birthday Draco'. As I approached the table, the 27 candles on the banana cake burst into life, one flame at a time.
I didn't get a chance to respond, for Harry withdrew from me, before thrusting back in quickly. I moaned loudly. He did it again, striking my prostate easily. My eyes threatened to roll back into my head at the pleasure that rolled through me. Harry set up a rhythm, going slow and steady, but that pace didn't last long. As I started thrusting my hips backwards into him, Harry started thrusting into me harder and faster. It wasn't long before he was reaching under me and wrapping his hand around my shaft. He moved his hand in rhythm to his thrusts. I shuddered at the contact as Harry used his thumb to spread the precum leaking from my tip.
“Did you even mean what you said in the kitchen a little bit ago?" I asked him, the tears still streaming down my cheeks.
He didn't answer, just reached out and rubbed his hand across my back. I pulled away from him. I reached for my fallen wand and summoned the two suitcases from under the bed. With a flick of my wand, I began to pack my things.
“Okay, fine. My point is, he's wanted to be with me since third year and I've wanted to be with him for a while, and now this. What angers me about it, though, is that we talked the other day and he asked if I would be okay if he was dating other people while we work on our friendship."
I wanted to walk away. But the pain radiating from him kept me in place. I watched him as he shifted in his seat, the side of his face that I could see, twisting in pain at his movement. When a fresh wave of pain pulsed through my own hip, I knew my Healers instincts would not let me just walk away.
I thought to myself, letting my eyes travel over his sleeping form. My eyes lingered on the hickeys that marked his skin. I smiled, knowing that I had once again marked him with my little “D" shaped hickey, and I could see it on the side of his neck.
I walked back towards the bedroom. I flicked my wand and the bed made itself and the dirty clothes flew into the hamper. I smiled, pleased with my work. I slipped my wand into my pocket before walking over to the wardrobe. I pulled a cloak from inside the wardrobe, shut the door, and pulled the cloak around my shoulders. I walked back into the living room and glanced at the clock again. It was time. I pulled the cloak tighter around me and closed my eyes. I thought about the grassy field outside of the Burrow and and twisted on the spot. I disapparated with a small pop.
“No, that wasn't the reason, although that's what he told his family. I broke up with him because I found out he had been sleeping with Marcus Flint for close to three months."
It felt like someone had just slapped me across the face. Ron's words hung in the air, ringing through my ears. I choked back a sob as my eyes filled with tears. I turned on my heel and made my way to the bedroom.  I closed the door behind me and walked over to sit on my side of the bed. The tears threatened to fall, but I brushed them away angrily.
Almost two hours later, the wards triggered, telling Mother and I that someone had left the Manor grounds. I took a deep breath and willed myself not to cry, knowing that Harry was gone.
We stood there staring into the window for a moment. “Harry, are you telling me that you dated a Muggle?" I asked, turning to look at him.
Harry was silent for a moment as he followed behind the Tahoe that Hermione was driving. “Well, when we visited Lucius in Azkaban, you told me before that he turned violent because you told him you're gay. But according to the memories your mother showed me, you told him back when you were sixteen. I guess my question is, why did you have to tell him again? Shouldn't he have already known?"
Harry crawled out of bed and began to search around the room as best as he could. With a muttered oath, Harry sat down on the floor. He snapped his fingers and suddenly, his glasses flew out from under the bed and into his hand. As he slipped them onto his face, I realized that he had used magic without a wand, again.
“No, because at that time, they were more concerned about the fact that my godfather had been the first person to break out of Azkaban."
“You've been coming home later than normal, and sometimes when you come home, you head straight for the shower. We never cuddle anymore. We haven't really been intimate for almost two weeks," I could taste bile in my throat and I felt like I would throw up any minute, but I needed to know.
Draco's hands caught my shirt and lifted it. I broke the kiss so I could remove it. I grabbed his shirt and removed it as well. I began to place kisses along his chest. I raised my head when I noticed the faint scars that marked his chest. I began to trace one of the scars with the edge of my tongue. He moaned and threaded his fingers through my hair.
He dropped his arms from around my neck. He waved his wand again and the lift began to move again. He gently stepped out of my embrace. I stared at him, my heart pounding against my ribs. “You..you.. ah hell, do you want to go to lunch sometime?" I stammered.
Ten minutes after leaving his house, Neville and I sat in an exam room at St. Mungo's, waiting for Dean or Shawnna to come in. I sat on the exam bed holding a bucket in my lap. I was nauseous, but I hadn't puked yet. Neville got up and began pacing the floor in front of me. The door opened and Dean walked into the room.
“Because I remembered your reaction to finding out that he was gay," Charlie's voice said from the door. Ron and I both turned to look at him. He was leaning against the door frame. “Admit it Ron, you were upset when you found out that he was gay. You even admitted that you wanted him to get back together with Ginny,"
Harry reached over and grabbed for a chip. The cheese was melted just right and as he pulled away a chip, the cheese stretched out with it. He laughed and pulled until the cheese finally broke away. Blaise began laughing at the sight of the cheese falling off Harry's chip.
“No, Harry. I want you to see the actual memory, the whole thing, not just the kiss. Don't you have a Pensieve?" Hermione asked.
“Don't be stupid. I was downstairs with you when he screamed, remember? Besides, I don't know how, but these wounds aren't real," I said. I pressed my hand against his chest for a moment, then lifted it to show that there was no blood on my hand. Harry still screamed.
I sighed. I gently pulled his hand up to my lips. “Well, if your that scared of going, I can come with you," I said.
“That's because he cut himself so many times, that he made himself immune to his Healer's magic. Eventually, he may be able to heal his own injuries again," said Dean's voice.
With another wave of her wand, small little plates and forks flew in our direction. Suddenly loud voices could be heard from the other room. “Just let it go, Percy!" Charlie yelled.
I chuckled at him. I continued to follow behind Ron's car, Draco and I making little jokes about how Hermione would react to our relationship.
“Then he must not want to be my friend. A real friend would be happy to see me meet new people that seem to like me."
“I've been sick the past five days," I answered, clutching the bucket a little tighter to my stomach.
I placed my hand on the door handle. I took a breath before I pushed the door open. As I stepped outside, there was no sign of Harry in any direction. I stood there for a moment, looking in all directions. Suddenly, I felt Harry's wild magic brush against me, coming from the left. I followed the trail of his magic to find him standing on the edge of a small cliff, his magic blowing around him.
I fought back a blush as I remembered the last time that Harry and I had gone to the movies; we hadn't watched the movie. “So, this is a magic free day?" I asked.
Harry must have noticed that Kyle was just standing there. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him turn his head in the young man's direction. He sighed and turned to me. “Draco, this is my ex-boyfriend, Kyle Webster. Kyle, this is my date, Draco Malfoy."
Before she could answer, a familiar male voice called out to us. “Hey Draco, hey there Hermione, long time no see."
“Too many painful memories. You have to remember all those who we've lost who stayed in that house...Sirius, Lupin, Tonks, Fred. Every time I go there, I have nightmares about them. I don't think I'll ever be able to live there again."
“Well, after my break up with Charlie,  I was a mess. I would get angry at the customers, and things would go wrong. My boss ordered me to take some time off work."
“Yeah, Mr. Potter got Firewhisky spilled on him and I was trying to help him. As for my friends, we had an argument and I told them that they better not be at this table when I came back."
It had been about a week and a half since Harry had moved out of the Manor, and true to his word, he had answered every message and phone call from me. He was following my rules about only hanging out if others were around. He was truly trying to be my friend. I swallowed the lump in my throat when I thought about how much I missed him.
Harry had moved into my bedroom about a week after we had gone to visit Father in Azkaban. The Gryffindor inspired bedroom I had given him when he had moved in was now used by Ron and Hermione when they came to visit. I actually enjoyed having them around, discovering that Hermione had the same taste in books that I did. Mother enjoyed it when they brought Rose with them. She absolutely loved babies.
Kyle choose that moment to appear with our food. I went to pull my hand away, but Harry flipped his hand over and grabbed mine, stopping my retreat. Kyle glared at our hands for a moment, then placed the food on the table between us. “Is there anything else I can get for you?" He asked. He sounded desperate.
The crackling magic around the room began to intensify as Harry's eyes narrowed further. “Kingsley, can I have a moment alone with Mr Malfoy?" He asked, his voice getting deeper with his anger. He released my hand.
I glanced over my shoulder at him. He had stood up from the couch and was watching me slightly. I nodded briefly. “So, what things do I need to sort through?" I asked him.
After laying there for a couple hours and not even getting close to falling asleep, I gave up and climbed out of bed. I wrapped my house robe around my shoulders and belted it around my waist as I headed for my bedroom door. The stone floor was cold beneath my bare feet as I stepped into the hallway. I made my way back to Harry's room and slipped quietly inside.
“Well, it started out with the Healers asking me questions about how I had healed your hip and how I stopped Rose's choking. Then they asked how good I was at healing wounds, even though I can't heal my own anymore," I said.
After about ten minutes, everyone had a bowling ball that was just right for them. Hermione explained the rules, pointing out the foul line on the floor, then she rolled the first ball, knocking over four pins. She then rolled her second ball, but it rolled into the gutter. I took my turn, bowling a strike on the first toss. After a couple of rounds, the others caught on and it soon was Gryffindors versus Slytherins, the six of us competing against each other like old times.
“Harry, I think you were crushing on him before you even realized that you're gay, if your obsession with him in sixth year is anything to go by."
“Forgive you? Charlie, how can you ask me to forgive you? If it only happened once, then I could get over it. But this has been going on for months. I can't just look the other way."
I emerged from the fireplace into a small, slightly dark room. A medi-wizard came over to me. He looked me over to make sure that I hadn't gotten hurt from the fireplace, then with a flick of his wand, the ash and soot were completely cleaned from my robes. He motioned me to the door on the other side of the room. I left through the door and found Ron waiting on the other side.
I sat him down on the bed, then helped him lie down against his pillows. I undid his belt and pulled it free from his trousers. A soft snore reached my ears and I glanced up at Harry's face. He had fallen asleep as soon as his head hit the pillows. I sighed, before slipping my wand from my pocket and transforming his trousers into pajama pants. I removed his glasses from his face and placed them on his nightstand.
“Get in line, Ronald," Draco said. “If anyone is going to kill him, you can guarantee that I'll be the first to do so."
“Good night, Draco," I said. Shortly afterwards, his breathing became slow and deep. His body around me became heavier as he drifted off to sleep. I pressed a kiss to the top of his head, before I let myself drift off to join him in sleep.
“So, umm, I..I heard about you and Charlie breaking up," Ron said. I paused in the middle of pulling on my shirt and glanced at him over my shoulder. He was looking at the floor.
“Alright I need some help in the kitchen. And Arthur, don't touch that cake yet," Mrs. Weasley said. Mr. Weasley dropped his hand away from the frosting on his birthday cake.
“I'm perfectly fine right where I am," he answered. I could hear the first hints of anger in his voice.
Harry hesitated for a moment, then his arms wrapped around my waist, pulling me even closer to him. I closed my eyes, enjoying the sensation of our bodies pressed against each other. One of his hands slid up my back and his fingers tangled in my hair. He tilted my head back a little, and deepened the kiss. I felt his tongue slide across my lips. I parted them, and he slid right in. He explored my mouth, swirling his tongue against my cheeks. I boldly slid my tongue into his mouth and repeated his actions.
Harry pressed open mouth kisses all over my length, starting at the bottom of my shaft before working his way up to the head. He licked the slit, then dragged his tongue around the head. He began licking back and forth along the head of my dick. I moaned loudly, thrusting up my hips to get him to take me into his mouth. Instead of engulfing my shaft in his wet mouth, he pulled away. I let out a frustrated groan and raised my head to look down at him. “Harry, what's wrong? Don't you want me?" I asked.
I sighed happily and rose to my feet. I walked over to the bed and gently shook his shoulder. He grumbled and rolled away from me. He caught the sheet in his hand and pulled it up to his shoulder. He snuggled deeper into his pillow. “Come on Harry, it's time to get up," I said, catching the sheet in my hand and tugging on it. His grip tightened on the sheet as he tried to hide under it. He managed to pull it up over his head.
I made no effort to remove my hand from his hip. I was still trailing my fingers on his bare skin. His skin was so smooth, it felt like silk. I could feel heat between my legs and looked down. A small tent was forming in my trousers.
I sat there for a while before I finally picked myself up and made my way back to the house. I stepped into the kitchen, made my way to the living room and the fireplace in the corner. I took a small pinch of floo powder from the pot on the mantle and threw it down. I called out the floo address for my room at Malfoy Manor and I stepped into the green flames.
“Young Master Malfoy. Haven't seen you since the last time you visited your father. You seem to be well," Shacklebolt said.
He stepped closer to the bed and finally raised his head. His grey eyes were slightly red rimmed, like he had been crying. My heart went out to him, but I stubbornly refused to let it show on my face. “Harry, I want you to know that I didn't plan that kiss with Blaise. I was very happy with you, and he ruined it."
We all nodded our heads. Kingsley turned towards his desk. With a flick of his wand, the portkey appeared on his desk. The portkey was nothing special; a porcelain teapot with a large crack down the side, a chip in the spout, and a broken off handle. I remembered that portkeys were made out of stuff Muggles would think was junk so they wouldn't pick them up by accident.
As soon as the gates came into view, Draco pulled out his wand. He aimed it at the gates and they swung open easily. I pulled through the gates and up the pathway. “Follow the pathway around the Manor. There's actually an underground garage around the back," Draco said when the front doors came into view.
“No, I won't say no to sex, but sex isn't the only thing that I want from you. I want to know the real you," Harry replied. He ran a hand up my back.
“Harry, I'm sorry. I know that you are in a relationship with someone, but I couldn't help myself. For some reason, I've wanted to do that all night." I blurted out. He didn't answer, just continued to rinse out his shirt.
Harry and I sat down on a couple of chairs, both declining Sanders offer for a drink. She left us alone in the small room, walking out the door and closing it gently behind her. I glanced around the room and shuddered slightly as I remembered when I had been brought to this room while I had waited for my trial after the war. I looked down at the table as the memory assaulted me.
“Dean, I don't get it. Harry has seen the scars on Draco's chest before. He's never had this problem before now," Hermione said.
I drove in silence, the only sound was Draco's snoring. When the gates of the Manor came into view, I drove closer to them, surprised when they opened. I pulled through them and followed the pathway around the Manor. I pulled into the underground garage and shut the engine off. I slid out of the car, rounded the hood, and opened Draco's door. With a snap of my fingers, his seatbelt became undone. I cast a silent feather light charm, and picked Draco up into my arms.
“I don't know Harry. We actually could have used your help the last few days. You are the best bartender that I've ever hired. I've even had customers stop coming because you weren't here. From now on, I'll write up the schedules and I'll make sure you're on it."
“Well, the Manor has plenty of space and then you wouldn't have to pay rent. You would have your own room with its own bathroom, house elves to bring your food to your room if you want it there. I'm sure Mother wouldn't mind." I reached over and placed my hand over his on the table.
“That was so much fun. Never in a million years would I have thought that," Pansy said, flopping down in the empty chair next to me.
I swallowed hard, before I pulled my wand from my pocket. I took a breath and lifted the glamour off my wrists. My arms were shaking as I held them towards Harry.  Harry gently caught my hands in his and turned my arms over, exposing the scars to his gaze. He stared at them for a moment, then he released my right hand and gently ran his fingers over the scar on my left wrist. Before I could pull my hand away, Harry leaned down and gently pressed his lips to the scar.
I served the food onto the plates, casting heating charms over everything and carried the plates to the table. Then I sat down to wait for him. I fiddled with the stem of my wine glass. I glanced at the clock again. 7:40 p.m. I took a sip from my wine. I ran my fingers through my unruly black hair, trying to make it lay flat.
She came to a halt next to me and flipped her dark curls over her shoulder. “It's good exercise to walk," she said. Her eyes glanced at me briefly, before shifting to Harry. “Well, hey there stranger. Long time no see."
“Yeah, your going to have to give me a moment longer," I said. Draco chuckled and snagged the blanket off the back of the chair. He draped it over my lap as he stood up.
I changed the subject by mentioning the Triwizard Tournament. Everyone of them jumped on the subject and that brought about a round of arguing between Harry and Pansy.
Without a word, he crossed the room over to me. He kicked off his shoes as he walked. He stepped between my knees and bent down and pressed his lips to mine in a seemingly desperate kiss. I ran my hands up his chest until I reached the top of the zipper on his coat. I pulled the zipper down and pushed the coat off his shoulders. It landed on the floor with a plop. His hands came up to hold onto my face as he deepened the kiss. I caught his arm and pulled him down to sit next to me on the bed. I broke the kiss and stood up.
," said my voice from behind me. I turned around, my shirt falling to the floor. My reflection was standing there, arms folded across his chest. It wasn't really my reflection now; the spell had captured my image, so now I was officially talking to myself. The me in the mirror was still wearing his shirt, but he could move and talk; almost like talking to a portrait of myself.
“Well, by the time you got a hold of me, I had already been asked to come by Harry. He thought it would be funny to surprise you when I told you no, then showed up anyway," Theo laughed. He sat down on Harry's other side.
Draco runs into Harry at a bar. After Harry gets Firewhisky spilled on him, he goes to the bathroom to clean himself up. Draco follows him and things quickly turn heated.
“Someone has a goofy looking smile on his face," Harry said as he wrapped his arms around me from behind. He pressed a kiss to my cheek.
“Hangover potions. Drink two before consuming alcohol and you won't have any side effects," he said. Pansy was nodding her head with every word. Her smile was smug.
Charlie stepped into the room behind me, but stopped short when I raised my wand that was still clenched in my hand. “Back off Charlie!" I growled. He took a step back and stared at me.
My heart cracked as I looked at his back. I slowly crushed out my half finished cigarette and stood up, my legs trembling. I slowly walked out the door, closing it behind me. In a fog, I made my way up the different flights of stairs. When I reached the fourth floor, I made my way to my room, not even glancing at the doors to his room as I passed them. I walked into my room, closing and locking the doors behind me. I threw myself down on the bed, burying my face in the pillows, as I fought back tears.
“Okay, so that we don't arrive at the same time, I'll floo over first. Give it about ten minutes, and apparate to the Burrow. Is that okay with you?" Charlie asked. I nodded. He bent slightly and placed a kiss to my cheek. He straightened up and turned towards the fireplace. He took a pinch of floo powder from the pot on the mantle and threw it into the empty fireplace. Green flames erupted instantly. Charlie stepped into the flames and shouted ´the Burrow'. He was gone in the blink of an eye.
We walked together, hand in hand, without saying anything. When we got to The Leaky Cauldron, I led him through the bar and straight up the two flights of stairs and down the hall to his room. Outside his door, I stopped. We turned to face each other, and I wrapped my arms around his neck as he wrapped his arms around my waist. Our lips met in a slow kiss, neither of us willing to part too quickly.
“Draco, if you don't wear these bowling shoes, you can't play. These shoes are designed to prevent you from sliding on the floor," I replied, heading over to a table. I sat down and began to remove my own shoes.
I smiled. “I may dislike the idea of you moving out, but I can't fault your reasoning behind the decision. I told you yesterday that I've wanted us to be together since third year. If you think moving out is the right choice for now, I can respect that."
“I figured you would like some company," I said. She smiled at me. She shifted her legs against the couch to make room for me to sit down next to her.
He was all alone in a booth in the corner by a window. He wasn't looking in my direction, but there was no mistaking that it was him. That messy black hair that never seems to lay flat, and from my angle, I could see the edge of his glasses. I took a small step closer to him and the throbbing of my hip intensified.
We walked for about ten minutes, talking about anything that came to mind; the weather, what we had been doing since we graduated from Hogwarts. He talked briefly about Weasley and Granger's baby that he had met yesterday. His face lit up when he talked about the little girl.
He nodded then reached out and grabbed my hand. He threaded his fingers through mine. We turned and walked down the path away from the cliff, back towards the door. Harry pulled open the door and we entered Azkaban, making our way down the short corridor to where Kingsley and the Aurors were waiting next to the portkey.
I was halfway to the table, seeing Theo was about to take his turn, before I noticed the other guy that was standing at the table. He was tall and well muscled, as though he spent a lot of time lifting weights. He had chestnut colored hair that hung just past his shoulders and was tied back in a neat ponytail. But it wasn't his appearance at our table that stopped me in my tracks; it was the fact that his hand was resting on Draco's cheek. Draco laughed at something the man said, and the guy raised his hand and brushed Draco's hair away from his face, then trailed his fingers down Draco's neck. Draco blushed and tilted his head, giving the man better access.
“Draco, everything will be fine. We'll be with Kingsley and a couple of Aurors. He won't be able to hurt you. I promise," Harry said. He stepped up next to me and wrapped his arms around me. I returned the hug, gently squeezing him.
“What he wanted to hear; that I'd be okay with it. I don't know if I'll be able to handle it though. I don't know if I'll be able to handle watching him be happy with someone besides me. I think I'm in love with him."
He kissed his way down my body towards my trousers. When he reached my waistband, he paused and looked up at me. “Yes," I said. He undid my belt. He hesitated for a moment, then he undid my trousers and began to tug them down my legs. I raised my hips and he pulled them off. He hooked his thumbs in the waistband of my boxers and slid them down as I moved up on my bed until I rested on my pillows. Harry knelt on the bed,  leaned over me and began kissing his way up from my ankle. He ran his tongue around the bend in my knee, biting his way gently up my thigh.
Without pausing to think, I twisted on the spot and apparated straight into Harry's room. He was thrashing back and forth across the bed, screaming like he was suffering the Cruciatus Curse. A pillow was on the floor, as though he had been holding it when he fell asleep. I darted forward, only to come up short at the sight of blood on his wrists. Stealing my nerves, I moved to the bed. I pulled my wand from my pocket and tried to close the wounds. Nothing happened. I caught one of his arms as he flailed about helplessly and ran my fingers over his wrist. He cried out in pain, but when I pulled my hand away, the wound was still there, and there was no blood on my hand.
Harry finally turned to look at me. “No. He was always asking me to do magic for him. One day, he got mad because I could preform magic and he couldn't."
I turned my back to the mirror, refusing to believe myself. I knew that the words my reflection was saying were completely true. I raised my hand and played with the dragon around my neck. “How can you say that? We don't know what love is," I growled, before turning around to face the mirror again.
“Sure thing, Harry," she said. She held out her arm to me. I glanced at Harry for a moment, before I slid my arm through hers. Before she could lead me away, Harry raised his hand and caught my chin. He leaned down and kissed me, earning a few whistles from the guys. He pulled away with a grin.
Narcissa slowly nodded and motioned me closer. I stepped up to the desk, swallowing down my nervous tension. I reached the desk and looked down at the Pensieve, watching her memories swirl around. Narcissa came around the desk and held her arm out to me. I slid my arm through hers, feeling a small trickle of nervousness in my stomach. Narcissa lowered her face to the surface of the Pensieve, took a breath, then stuck her face into her memories. I felt like the floor was falling away from my feet as we tumbled through the past.
Before Harry or I could answer her, another voice was heard. “Joanna, stop stealing my tables! You've been doing that all day!" Harry stiffened at the sound of that voice.
“Actually, you should have noticed it first during our first night together. If you remember, after we were done, my wand was suddenly in my hand. But, you also used wandless magic on that night."
He rolled over so that he was laying beside me on the bed. We laid there, not saying anything, letting our breathing return to normal. I turned to look at him, and I couldn't help but smile. He laid on his side facing me, his hair was even more of a mess than normal, and his glasses now rested a little lopsided across his nose.
“There you two are. I was beginning to wonder if I had gotten the wrong time of your arrival, Harry."
I laughed and returned his embrace. Charlie smiled, before calling out to Ginny that Ron and I were friends again. We headed back into the living room. Charlie made hot chocolate for all of us and Ron and I began to play Wizards Chess. After a spectacular loss on my part, Ginny challenged Ron to a game. Charlie and I sat on the couch and watched them. I smiled to myself, glad that Ron was talking to me again.
Using my grip on his hand, I tugged him over to a chair in the corner of the room. I pushed him down on the chair and perched myself on his lap. I took one of the forks from him, stabbing it into a piece of cake. I raised the bite to Harry's lips. He smiled, before dutifully opening his mouth and allowing me to put the cake in his mouth.
“No problem Harry. Although, I doubt that there's too many people who would tell you no for something you want. Tell Narcissa that I said hello," Kingsley said.
“You really think that I'm the embarrassment here, Mr. Potter? My so called son won't last long when the whole wizarding world knows that he's dating the
(Personal note: This chapter might be the longest one that I've done so far. It certainly will have a lot of sections, but it will all be done in Draco's point of view.)
Kingsley looked like I just announced that Voldemort had come back from the dead. “Are you serious? You're dating Lucius Malfoy's son? Merlin Harry, what are you thinking?" He asked.
Hope you're enjoying my work so far. Please feel free to leave me a comment. Thanks for reading and the next chapter will be ready as soon as possible
“He does, and I didn't need Legilimency to know that," Harry said. He reached out and picked up a tortilla chip. He dipped it into the queso. He brought the chip to his mouth and bit down. I watched as his tongue slipped out to catch a drip of cheese that clung to his bottom lip. I took a sip from my lemonade, my mouth going dry.
“Well, Harry's told us before that his father was an unregistered Animagus. Does that count?" Hermione asked.
I pulled my glasses off and rubbed my eyes. I didn't like hiding from Hermione and Ron, but I couldn't face them after how friendly they had gotten with Draco. After seeing Draco get out of her car, I knew she was still friends with him and now I couldn't find it in my heart to want to talk to her.
He nodded and pulled his trunk and suitcases from his pocket. He set them on the bed and waved his hand. They enlarged to the normal size they had been. Harry glanced down at his watch. “I'll put these away later. I want to go get my things."
Suddenly, my phone buzzed slightly in my pocket. I pulled it out. “Ron says Hermione's forgotten which direction she's supposed to be going," I said, reading the message Ron had sent.
I moved away from the window as a wave of grief threatened to bring me to my knees. I grabbed my cup of tea and moved towards the living room. I sat down on the couch and tucked my legs underneath me. With a wave of my wand, I cast a warming charm on my tea. I held it in my hands and let the warmth seep through me.
He grabbed my hand and gently tugged me out the doors. He snapped his fingers and the doors swung shut behind us. Still holding my hand, he began to make his way down the hall. When we reached my room, I released his hand and disappeared into my room to grab my jacket. As I came back out, I found Harry leaning against the wall next to my doors. He smiled at me and reached for my hand again. When I threaded my fingers through his, he tugged me into his arms. He dropped a soft kiss to my lips and apparated us into the garage.
He must have heard the desperation in my tone, for he removed his fingers. I heard him whisper the lubrication charm, and then he spread my cheeks again and slid into my hole slowly. I moaned at the sheer sensation of him sliding in; I could feel him more than normal from this position. When he was buried in me to the hilt, he paused, holding himself completely still. “Fuck, Draco. You feel so good. You're so tight around me," he said.
I landed us outside the gates around the Manor, which swung open almost at once. Harry and I stepped through the gates, and began the long walk to the doors. The gates swung shut behind us. A loud squawk above us drew our attention upwards. One of Father's white peacocks was strutting along one of the hedges, fluffing out his feathers. The peacock stared down at us for a moment, squawked again, then turned around and marched along the hedge.
“I don't really have a uniform. My boss just requires that the bartenders wear black shirts, but that's really the only thing."
“Harry, I'm sorry for everything that has been going on this past week. I honestly didn't know you would take it so hard if I was with someone else."
“Alright, come out of there or I'll blast the door from its hinges!" I yelled. I kept my wand trained on the door. It opened slowly. A man stepped out, dressed in a pair of Charlie's pajama pants. I knew him as soon as I looked up at him. He had short black hair, crooked teeth and dark grey-black eyes. There was a Slytherin tattoo on his left shoulder.  “Flint!" I growled.
“Well, I did tell him I was gay back when I was sixteen. You saw that he used the Cruciatus Curse on me for it. When I visited him in Azkaban for the first time, he was insistent that I was going to marry a pureblood witch. I had to set him straight," I said, shrugging.
“I haven't actually hated you since third year. That was when I figured out that I'm gay. You haunted my dreams a lot that year. And the years that followed.And then you kinda crushed my fantasies when you dated Cho Chang, and then again when you got with Weasley's little sister."
“Excuse me Draco," Harry said. I slid out of the booth and Harry slid out as well. Without a word, he made his way to the men's room. I noticed his slight limp and the throbbing in my hip started all over again.
“Krista, calm down. I have a bartender on the way. Actually he should have been here by now, but until he gets here, you'll have to handle things."
He kissed my cheek gently, then stood up. “I guess I should return to the Leaky Cauldron before it gets too dark around here," he said.
“I didn't know that. I've been here several times and I've never picked up on his magical signature," I said.
“Merlin, I've missed that sound. So, what did you want to talk to me about?" I asked him as I fastened my seatbelt.
We sat there in an uncomfortable silence for a moment. I suddenly remembered the food at the end of my bed. “Enough of these haunting memories. I have breakfast over there." I pointed to the foot of my bed. I held out the robe that was still draped over my arm. He took it from me and swung it over his shoulders. “Bathroom is the door on the left if you need it," I said.
We headed down the hall towards a large opening. We stepped into a large reception area. He led me over to the desk in the center of the room. “What department do you need?" Asked the medi-witch behind the desk. She didn't pay attention to us, just continued to scribble on the parchment in front of her.
“Like you really care about that. You're just worried that I might have harmed one of your precious Aurors," Father growled softly. He turned his attention back to me. “So, it isn't enough for you to embarrass me to the wizarding world by being gay. Now you're involving yourself with the
I turned my head in the direction of Hermione's voice, seeing her waving at Pansy and I from where she was sitting at a picnic table outside of Florean Fortescue's Ice-Cream Parlour with Ron and Harry. I nudged Pansy's shoulder, and steered her in the direction of the three Gryffindors. Harry looked up from his phone when Pansy and I reached the end of the table.
“Well, we have rode quite a few, and I'm guessing that there's several more. I want to ride them all," Ron said, his eyes lighting up at the thought.
“That was amazing," he said, rolling off of me to sprawl out on the bed beside me. I rolled over and tucked myself against his side, resting my head against his shoulder. We laid there for a while, just holding each other.
I thought to myself. I twisted quickly and apparated into the living room. I turned and ran down the hall to the bedroom.
“Draco, look, the reason that I'm angry right now, is that I know what it's like to be abused by the people who are supposed to take care of you."
“Well that might just mean he fell asleep. Or he could be in the library. He does like to read," I said.
“Harry, are you alright?" Mother's voice asked, pulling me away from my book. I glanced up and turned my head in his direction. He was sitting in an armchair near the window, there was a scowl on his face and his fingers were trembling against the book in his hands. It was early afternoon and we were sitting in the sun room, all three of us just kinda relaxing around.
I groaned, dropping my head back against the sofa. “Fine. I want a banana cake with chocolate frosting and strawberry filling," I said raising my head to look at her, waiting for her to tell me I couldn't have that kind of cake.
“I would blame him being drunk, but he's not that good an actor," he said. He looked down at his shirt and continued to trace his wand over it.
“You could have warned me," he said at last, as he stepped closer to me and set the box down with the others.
“Apparation charms. You can apparate from room to room, but no one can apparate directly into the Manor. You can even apparate out of the Manor," I said. I dropped my arms from around him and stepped up to the gates. I pulled out my wand and tapped it against the iron bars.
Hermione took the phone from me and added her number into the phone. She handed the phone back to me. I slid it back under my pillow. “Okay Draco. I've added my number to your phone. Just give me a call when you are released from this hospital, and I'll come get you. I think together, we can do something about your relationship."
I placed the tray across my knees and turned to look at her. I reached out my hand and placed it against her belly. “Morning sickness gone yet?" I asked.
“Well, we always had family staying over. Now, these days it's just me and Draco and the house elves. That's why I'm glad that you decided to move in, Harry. Makes it seem less empty," Mother said as we climbed up the stairs. When we reached the fourth floor, we moved down the hallway. Harry paused as we passed my bedroom doors.
“Well, after a lengthy conversation with Narcissa, Draco and I left. I had the strangest urge to ask him out, and I did."
“Come on, Sleeping Beauty. It's time to go home," I said to him. He grumbled under his breath and slid off his chair. He stumbled, catching himself on the bar. I slid my arm around his waist to help steady him. He leaned into my embrace as I led him away from the bartop.
“You didn't have to do that," Potter said. I shrugged. “By the way, I'm not lying about what happened."
“I love it. Thank you," I said. I leaned over and took his lips in a soft kiss. He pulled away gently.
“Oh, yes. Yes," I moaned thrusting my hips up again, feeling the familiar tightening of my groin. I gasped as I released all over my stomach and his hand. He thrust into me a couple more times before I felt him releasing his cum deep inside of me. He collapsed against me, both of us breathing heavily. Harry raised his head and pressed a kiss to my cheek.
The mirror exploded, glass flying in every direction. A small shard of glass hit my cheek as it flew past. The brief bite of pain that rippled through my skin sent a shot of adrenaline throughout my body. I raised my hand to my stinging cheek, letting the wound close. Without giving myself time to tell myself that this was wrong, I grabbed a large piece of glass, placed it to my wrist and pulled sharply. I cried out as the glass ripped through my skin, but I enjoyed the pain as well. I watched my blood drip into the sink. Within seconds, the blood stopped as my Healer's magic closed the wound. I placed the glass on the other wrist and repeated the action. I sucked in a sharp breath at the bite of pain.
He pulled his phone from his pocket and walked towards me. He began touching the screen of his phone, then he shoved it into my hand. My voice rose from it. “Personally, I don't care if he wants to kill himself. I'm done with him and I could care less if he decided to get married to Blaise right now. If you'll excuse me, I have other things to be doing than having this conversation."
“Harry, are you sure you want to come with me?" I asked. We were preparing to head to the Ministry of Magic.
I sighed as I opened the stove to check on the chicken I was making. This dinner was supposed to be special; it was about a week before our seven month anniversary.
“Hey, Harry?" He turned his head to look at me. “I know you said that you don't work as an Auror, but can I ask if you have a job?"
“Well, actually Harry, I want to watch you play that hunting game again. I want to see if you can beat your own high score," Pansy said.
“That's okay, so am I," he whispered. In seconds, his body arched up and he was spilling his seed over my hand and his stomach. His muscles clenched around me and I followed him over the edge of release. I spilled myself inside his body. I thrust a couple more times before I collapsed against him. We were both breathing heavily.
“It's not a hickey. One of the young female dragons lashed out with her tail because her mate was hurt. I just happened to be the one in her way," Charlie said. He grabbed the collar of his shirt and pulled it aside. There was a large bruise along his collarbone, but it didn't even touch the one on his neck. My blood boiled with the feeling he was lying to me.
“I didn't want you to regret your decision about moving in here. I wanted you to be able to call this place home," I said. I waved my hand towards the desk. “That bookcase holds some books that I thought would be of interest to you. Books on Quidditch, books on animagus forms, things like that."
“I can't believe you're encouraging her. You're dating ME; you're supposed to be on MY side," I said, looking down at him. He didn't look up from his book, but I saw a grin forming on his face.
I glanced over to where he was sitting on the edge of the fountain, then I turned my gaze towards the Manor. “I don't get it either. He wanted me to move back in, we shared the bedroom for about three days, then he made me move back into the Gryffindor bedroom. He's turned cold towards me. I feel like an unwanted guest here, much like I felt with the Dursley's," I said. I buried my face in my hands.
Alan sighed. “Mr. Webster, collect your things, and turn in your apron. This is not the first time a customer has complained about sexual harassment from you, but it will be the last. Apparently, being suspended for two weeks did nothing. Wait for me in the office."
The gates swung open without a sound. I turned back to Harry and held out my hand to him. He took my hand and linked his fingers through mine. I led him up the pathway between the two rows of hedges that towered over us. The gates swung shut behind us with a boom. The walk to the front door was long, but we were comfortable without saying anything.
Ron's eyes briefly slid down his menu. “I'll have the turkey club on rye, with a side of cheesy bacon soup," he said.
“Draco, I did permanent damage to you. How could you just forgive me so easily? You have to live with those scars ruining your body. It's my fault," I whispered. I turned my head away from him. He cupped my chin again and turned my head back. He leaned down and gently kissed me.
“The wizarding world will never to cease to amaze me. So, you're saying that you could get pregnant if you wanted to?"
“What kind of job did you have?" I asked, stubbing out my cigarette in the silver-lined, glass ashtray next to me.
“Harry, please! More, I want more," I begged. He began to pick up his pace, sliding his mouth up and down my shaft a little faster. He also began to suck just a bit harder. One of his hands left my hip and fondled my balls. I began to writhe beneath him, my orgasm approaching.
“Works for me," I said. Pansy reluctantly agreed. The six of us rose from the table and began walking towards Gringotts.
“What brings you here? Especially you Hermione; haven't seen you since you got pregnant," Steve said as he dropped his arms.
“Thank you," I said to her. I headed down the hallway she had directed me towards. I was about halfway down the hall, looking at my feet and lost in my thoughts, when I plowed right into someone. I about fell over, but whomever I had ran into grabbed my arm and steadied me.
He released my mother and turned to face me. “You're not going to ignore me this time, are you?" I asked.
Harry wakes up in Draco's bed. He doesn't want his time with Draco to end, but knows that he's betrayed Charlie. He goes home to talk to Charlie and beg for his forgiveness, but when he arrives, he gets an unwanted surprise.
“Draco, don't say that. You and I both know how that curse feels," I said. It was something that neither one of us had ever discussed; how we had both been tortured by Lord Voldemort with one of the three unforgivable curses known to the wizarding world. I still remembered the way my blood felt like it was on fire, as the curse ripped through me. I banished the thought from my mind, and instead, I turned my attention to the comfort of his body underneath me on the sofa.
“Hi Harry. Been wondering when you would show up," Hermione said. She sat up slightly. I moved over to the couch and bent down to give her a hug.
I nodded slowly, not taking my eyes from the little decorations that lined the mantle. I swallowed hard, remembering each purchase. I trailed my fingers gently over the first little figurine; it was shaped like a star, and it was the first one Charlie and I had bought after I had moved in. My fingers trailed over the next one; this one was shaped like a bear with its cubs.
“Please, don't think I'm following you because I want to. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for them," Jolene said, jerking her thumb over her shoulder. She moved over to one of the chairs next to the fireplace and sat down. She picked up her fork and began to eat.
Jolene smiled and sat back down in the chair next to the fireplace. Without a word, the rest of the family settled in the chairs. We were now in a circle around Mr. Weasley and the large pile of presents. I could see my gift for him; the gold colored wrapping paper and the dark red ribbon stuck out like a sore thumb.
I groaned softly before waving my wand to make the numbers disappear. I waved my hand and levitated my wand back to the nightstand. I turned towards Draco and pulled him closer to me. He snuggled deeper into my side as I wrapped my arms around him. I let out a soft sigh as I closed my eyes, and drifted back off to sleep.
“Harry, that's how it's always been in pureblood circles. The Head of the Family can basically do whatever they want to everyone else. Look, I'm touched that you wish to defend my honor, but its not necessary."
Harry chuckled and turned to face me. He reached out and pulled me against him. We laid there as our breathing quieted down. I felt myself getting rather sleepy. I snuggled against him and let my eyes close. I let myself drift off to sleep, my head snuggled against his chest.
As I woke from the deep sleep I had been wrapped in, I became aware of two things...one, there was a strong arm wrapped around my waist and two, my cheek was pressed against a firm surface. I opened my eyes and discovered that I was resting on Charlie's chest.
“No, I won't ignore you. I'll answer any text, any call, or even any letter. I'll do anything I can to help us become friends. Maybe if we ever resume our relationship, things will be better than before. But, for now, I guess this is goodbye."
Charlie stepped towards me and bent down to press a kiss to my lips. He stepped away and sat down in his chair. “This looks amazing by the way," he said, picking up his silverware.
“Sorry, I wasn't looking where I was going," I mumbled. My eyes were still looking down, and I realized I was looking at a pair of shiny black dress shoes. I slowly raised my head and found myself looking down into a pair of cloud grey eyes and platinum blonde hair.
“Have a good night, Draco. See you tomorrow." He pressed another quick kiss to my lips, then he turned around and disappeared into his room. It took all of my strength to stop myself from following him. I took a step back and twisted on the spot, making my way home.
“That was amazing, even if I never did that before," I whispered to him. I slowly pulled myself out of him and rolled over to lay next to him.
I grabbed my house robe that hung from one of my bed posts. I tugged it on and belted it around my waist. I padded barefoot over to my door. I unlocked the door and stepped out into the hall. I gently pulled the door shut behind me. “Poppy," I said. With a small pop, a house elf appeared in front of me. Her hair was almost as blonde as mine, her large chocolate brown eyes stared up at me, and she wore an old t-shirt as a dress.
I felt him smile slightly against the skin of my chest, before he snuggled in deeper. “Love you too," I thought I heard as I drifted off to sleep.
Shame hit me like a brick; shame and regret for the pain I had caused Draco over the last week. Tears welled up in my eyes as I glanced over my shoulder towards the bed. Draco was sitting there, crying softly against Hermione's shoulder. I turned around and took a step forward. As soon as I did, Draco raised his head and looked over at me. He rose to his feet, watching me carefully. He took a small step towards me and opened his arms.  With a sob, I practically ran to him and allowed him to wrap his arms around me.
“You would seriously cheat? Just because he's pushing you away for a couple of weeks, it shouldn't come to throwing away a relationship that's lasted almost seven months. Harry, think this through," I said. I wanted him to understand what would happen if we went through with this.
I glanced up from my cellphone, where I had been re-reading the message from Ron. “Sorry," I said, slipping my phone back into my pocket. We were sitting at a table in a Muggle cafe, waiting for Ron to show up. Hermione wouldn't be with him; she was home with Rose. Draco sat next to me and there were two empty chairs across the table. The cafe was filled with happy voices of different families, but it wasn't really busy.
“It wasn't real though Harry. It was all in your head." I quickly explained what Dean had said in the other room. I reached out and took his hand, holding it gently. “I know you saw me hurting you during the nightmare, giving you the same wounds you gave me. That won't happen, ever. I could never do that to someone."
I ignored her and dragged the broken glass across my wrist again. I cried out as my skin ripped open once again. I had long since lost count of how many times I had already cut both of my wrists, only to have my Healer's magic close each wound. The physical pain seemed to lessen the emotional pain. The physical pain made me forget; if only for a little while.
I choked on my eggs. After quickly swallowing down some tea, I glanced back up at her. She was still looking down at her food.
I began moving both fingers in and out of him, twisting my wrist as I did. Harry moaned, his head thrashing back and forth on the pillows. I leaned forward and pressed a kiss against his collarbone He growled softly, his hand still slowly spreading lube around my shaft.
“What's going on here?" A voice asked. I turned my head and saw a man standing there. He was tall and well muscled. His name tag said Alan, and the word manager was underneath it.
“Don't worry about it, Harry. The mirror and the door can easily be repaired. I was happy to see someone put Lucius in his place like that. No offense, Draco," he said, flashing me a guilty look.
Ron sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “Look, Draco. If Harry loves you like I'm sure he does, then yes he'll be able to forgive you. Just don't expect it to happen right away."
I turned my head and saw Dean standing inside the hidden doorway behind me. He had pushed aside the bookcase and stood at the base of the stairs that led up to the apartment. “So, Harry, how does it feel knowing that you caused Draco as much pain as you caused back when we were sixteen?" Seamus questioned.
Just as I felt my body tense with the approach of my orgasm, Harry pulled his mouth away and slowly kissed his way back up my body. When he got to my chest, he began to place tender, loving kisses to the scars that marked my skin. He started with the longest one that began under my collarbone. I groaned as he gently ran his tongue over each scar before he shifted his mouth and latched onto my left nipple. My back arched as he sucked on my nipple as though his life depended on it.
(Personal note: This chapter takes a weird turn. I hope this satisfies my readers who thought Harry got off too easily for how things turned out between him and Draco.)
“´Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus'. Latin for, ´Never tickle a sleeping dragon'," I answered. I glanced over at him. “How did that inspire you with this necklace?" I asked him.
“I knew he was up to something. He was a little too willing to join us at the table," he said. He turned on the tap and held his shirt underneath it. Suddenly he leaned forward, bracing his hands on the edges of the sink, and sucked in a sharp breath. His face twisted in pain again.
“The fault is mine, Narcissa. I refused to get out of bed," Harry laughed. I dropped his hand as Mother opened her arms. I stepped into her embrace, feeling the way her hand smoothed over my hair, like she has always done.
I raised my hand and gently ran it through his slightly damp hair. “Harry, it was stupid of me to even ask that of you the first time. I promise that while we continue to work on our relationship, friendship, whatever you want to call it, I will not be with another guy again."
“Oh, that's okay Harry. I really wasn't sure if you would want them or not, so I thought I'd give you that option."
I took the quill from him and signed my name under his. I laid the quill down. Draco led me over to a door on the left side of the desk. He reached for the door handle, but before he touched it, the door opened. Narcissa's voice came out as a medi-witch came out in a rush. “You better not come back in this room or I will see you fired!"
I felt him sprawl over my back as he leaned down and whispered in my ear, “Cum for me, Draco. I know you're close."

“Because I'm in a relationship with someone. I need to go home and try to fix it." He stood and walked over to my bed where his clothes were piled. I turned my head to watch him, a feeling of rejection sliding down my spine. I watched him pull his boxers up his legs before he removed my robe from his body. He sat on the bed to slide his legs into his jeans.
“Your not getting away that easily, little brother. Anti-Apparation charms are in place and and there is now a shield around the perimeter. No one leaves until you two fix this," he said, looking at Ron as though daring him to try again.
