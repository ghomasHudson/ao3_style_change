Draco hurriedly slurped up the rest of the hot chocolate before chucking the plastic cup in the bin outside of the seemingly empty household. It seemed that they had seemed to take the bait after all. Potter was right after all.
He took in a long breathe before placing one foot on the wall and pulling himself upwards. Draco just hoped there weren't any noisy neighbors watching from there windows or they would be in much more trouble than he had signed up for.
Harry wiped a tear from his face. "Yes. You do."
The three of them start to slow down and whisper among themselves when they spot him. Draco's conflicted on what to do: ignore them or keep up appearances? They had an unspoken agreement to keep whatever they had between themselves and wouldn't not doing anything be suspicious? Just as he thought in Severus' office, it was easier to be something when they already made an assumption on him. It would be easier to keep playing that part for both of them.
"I didn't say that it did! None of this would have happened if he didn't force my hand!"
What was he even doing? He was breaking down in front of Harry Potter of all people. He felt pathetic. He couldn't even do one of the simplest things asked of him. Even crying he was
"Harry."
They began getting ready for bed. Harry was gathering his clothes to take a shower when Ron told him to wait. He looked nervously back at their other dorm mates on the other side of the room who were once again passed out. The tips of his ears were gradually turning pink.
“Yes, I was. And if you don’t mind me, I think I’ll take this as my leave.”
He closed his eyes quickly and thought of a wish. It wasn't hard, really. The real problem was picking only one to act on.
Book forgotten, he pushed his face in his hands to hide his increasingly blotching face. He just wanted to crawl in a hole and die from embarrassment and shame. He also just wanted to scream until his throat went raw. He hated himself so much. He shouldn't be here. He shouldn't be alive. He should be someplace suffering for everything he's done. He deserved so much more pain; he should be welcoming everything happening to him. Yet some greedy part of him just wished for it all to go away and become the same ignorant twelve-year old he once was. If only he could just smother it to death.
Draco moved some books so the two of them could sit on the divan together. Harry spots a book named 'The Influences on Wizarding Tradition' and picks it up, flipping through it. "What's all this?"
"Yea. It feels like you just froze all my insides though."
you bloody idiot. I mean
Harry's eyes quirked upwards. "Cocoa is more powdery. All you do is add it to hot milk. That's weird and gross.
Well this was fast-
"Maybe you should listen to them. I would rather you not have a heart attack hundreds of meters in the air. I've invested far too much time in you."
Draco took a deep breath with his eyes closed and tried to remember Brambles words. This could be his chance to switch everything around. He wasn't dense. He could see an opportunity when he was one. The only question was though, was he too much of a coward to take it?
Harry frantically started to button up his uniform and slip on his robes that he thankful already had on. By the time he slipped on his robes, Draco had already unlocked his trunk using Harry's wand on the seat.
"And except me to suffocate to death? No thanks."
"As you wish. I always knew I'll have admirers one day," Yatin said with another smirk. Draco internally beat his head against a desk. The boy was a narcissist at his very core.
Not looking away from the redhead, Draco sensed Harry had taken a surprise step backward. Draco purposefully doesn't look at him, afraid of what his reaction would be.
He watched as dark storm clouds blow in and cover the sky. His mouth formed a frown. He had made sure to read the paper beforehand. It wasn't supposed to rain for nearly two more days.
"Aren't you supposed to be in the prefects carriage with Ron and Hermione?"
Harry raises an eyebrow. "Oh don't pretend to be high-all-mighty. You would have been eaten alive in first-year hadn't it been for Crabbe and Goyle at your side twenty-four-seven."
And so he does. He recognizes the taste of the Pepper-up and Corporis potion immediately. He could have laughed when Remus hands him a steaming mug of hot chocolate to wash them down with had it not been for the tension in the air.
"The other wizards at the inn I mean." Harry lies quickly, hoping he doesn't pick up on the lie with his wolf instincts. Remus gave him a look that lasted a beat too long in his opinion before looking back over his shoulder where now crowds of last minute students were climbing aboard. The Hogwart Express horn went off twice telling others to hurry up.
Harry's lips twitched into a frown. "Maybe that's not it's real name?"
"I don't know." Draco hissed. Blaise helped him back in his chair gently. The three scanned the room for suspects. No one had seemed to notice Draco's slip-up being too absorbed in their work.
He tore the greenish-blue shirt from off his back before leaning back into the pillows with a satisfied sighed. He would have passed out right then had it not been for Draco's sharp curses.
Draco gives one last hard glower at Harry's two best friends before turning his back once again. He hears them do the same with mutterings coming from Ronald. He casts a wordless
"Yeah...yeah, let's go."
Potter raised an eyebrow. "...
fucked up. His stomach felt like it was being stretched and let go like an elastic band.
Harry threw back his head in laughter at Ron's face. The exploding snap cards they'd been playing with had exploded directly in his face. His hair was blown back and his face was comically covered in soot.
Just then, his elbowed jerked again and knocked over the inkpot. It spilled over the text and over the table, causing Pansy to shriek and jump back. A couple students stopped to look at them.
"And satisfaction brought it back."
. You don't have a choice."
Harry made a face. "Only because someone decided to kick me off the team for a week. I was rusty-"
"No no, it's not that," Harry wipes his nose with his shirt sleeve. "I'm fine with it. Really. Just took me by surprise is all."
"Really? What was it?"
"Don't know what you're referring to exactly."
"It's.... harder." He replies. They were only half a month into school and Harry could already feel the drain his N.E.W.T. classes were having on him. He was just glad he didn't have to take potions this year. (Yes, he would never become an auror now but what was the point when he was destined to die so soon after school anyway?) Hermione said Professor Slughorn was particularly ambitious on 'collecting' students for his slugclub, something he couldn't be less interested in. He voiced the thoughts to the man who agreed with him.
"I'm rubbish only because of rubbish teachers. Besides," he pulled out the paper from the letter and handed it to Harry, "I know her handwriting when I see it."
"You're lying," says Draco. It comes out before he could stop it.
It was as if his heart had suddenly stopped beating and all the blood had run down into his shoes. He swayed for just a moment, grabbing onto the table, before Draco noticed. His eyes winded for a millisecond and then moved swiftly, catching him and lowering him back into the chair.
Have you looked into a mirror recently? Because I think you’re the one who needs to keep their trap shut. Your whole family at that.”
Both of them turned and gave him a searching look. Draco hadn't told them about that. He saw no point.
He didn't even notice Potter leave the room and come back with a blanket. Harry wrapped the warmth around his shoulders and shoved a steaming mug into his hands. He only looks up when Harry is sitting right next to him on a stool that wasn't there moments earlier.
Malfoy sneered back at him. "Then shut up about things you don't understand."
Draco looks up at the large builds of Vincent and Gregory. They both had the stupid grins on they still hadn't grown out of that showed they were up to something. An ugly sneer that disfigured their already disfigured faces and a taunting raise of eyebrows that showed more confidence in their magic than near-squibs should. He almost made a smartass remark about it before remembering that harming him with magic probably wasn't the intent.
"Your broom?" He questions with a furrow.
"Y-yeah. I got cut from the Quidditch team until I 'get better'. It didn't matter that I was the captain."
Harry being 'sad' sounds so childish, like something flimsy, something one should be able to cast off with a happy reflection or the smile of a friend. But 'sad' is nothing of the sort. The ache from Sirius's death sits inside him in a seed of depression, just waiting for the right conditions to grow, to send out roots to choke the hope out of his heart. And right now it seemed to be flourishing under the heavy ache Remus's words left inside him.
Harry nodded grimly but truthfully he was kind of glad to be partnered with the Slytherin. They hadn't talked since the moment in the hallway days ago. They both knew an encounter like it would be unavoidable but it hurt, no unnerved him, seeing Malfoy on the ground. It was stupid but his conscious was yelling at him for not doing
"Oh hello! I was about to start studying up on my charms theory for next year. It's a little advanced but Flitwick always did tell me I was bright for my age."
"You can get caught."

"Need help?"
The Standard Book of Spell, Grade 6? Check.
"Never in all my years-" Pomfrey starts. She grabs a collection of potion bottles from his bedside table and shoves them in his hands. "Drink Mr. Potter. I'll conjure them in your stomach myself if I have to."
"That's not the point! It doesn't matter if you
"Not everything is black and white," he hisses pathetically. "You can't just look at one side of the mirror and decide which side is right. Stop talking like you know me. You don't. Now just-" he wiped his face lazily and waved at the door, "leave me the bloody hell alone."
It didn't take long for the two boys to quickly change clothes and head downstairs. Bramble met them and sent them off with an embarrassing kiss on the cheek and a hug. Even Harry who barely knew him. By the time she was done he was blushing like mad.
"Yeah, sure." Harry mumbles before looking out the window moodily. Draco frowned.
"Potter," He says. He frowns when he doesn't get a reaction. "Potter," He repeats a little louder. He places a hand on the boy's shoulder to get him to snap out of it. Harry suddenly pulls back as though he was burned.
Draco fixed himself with a growl. "Shove off."
Harry stumbled out of the room with Draco's help, and with each step his stomach tightened and ached all the more. The wave of nausea that hit Harry was so intense that he hardly made it to the toilet bowl before he emptied his stomach. Ashen faced, he clung to it as a life raft. His stomach felt like the bag in a set of bag-pipes being vigorously squeezed. With a heaving lurch of his stomach another small mouthful of bile dribbled from his quivering lips into the waiting pool of rancid vomit.
Harry made a face to show his disgust. "What do you mean
Within the span of four days he finally escaped the Dursely's, manged to be on the run from the Ministry, get attacked by deatheaters, get on a first name basis with Draco-Fucking-Malfoy, and get hit by whatever dark magic was eating at him at aching like a bludger to the stomach. Not to mention they still had no idea how any of this started in the first place.
"Um-"
"No."
"It was secret for a reason. Don't blame yourself for not figuring it out."
have understood what was going on inside his head. He had no idea.
‘Kill the spare.’
Draco's grip on it tightened, crinkling the edges of the paper. His rare grin didn't even flicker. Harry was momentarily startled on striking the image was. The way his lips lifted upward. The way his one dimple crinkled. The way his teeth are perfectly aligned. The warm glow his happiness gives. A stand of loses blonde hair fall in front of his face, reflecting on the vivid oranges of the sky behind him. His large grey eyes held such intelligence and twinkle at that moment that he couldn't help but pause and stare.
The boys start scrambling up to grab their wands and run away. Draco thought that was at least one thing they had right. No one wanted to be on the receiving end of the girl's vicious jinxes.
"That would be great, thank you."
"I'm not a child. I can deal with it myself." Harry mutters with defiance clear in his voice.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco rips his arm free and quickly, but casually, reaches for the wand in his robes. He learned that trick from his father disgustingly. Never let them know your actual emotions or intent was. Intimidate them, but don't let them know you're doing that purposely. If there was one thing he could do it was that. Hiding his fear came naturally to him.
"Then what did happen to her?" Draco asks, pulling down his sleeve again when his godfather is finally done. The swelling had gone down greatly in seconds. "Do you know who did it?"
Draco shoves him. "
"A car?"
The back of his nose burned from the emotion that was wracking through his body. He was lucky to have soundproof walls in his room. If he didn't, his father would most likely use the Cruciatus curse on him again for causing a scene. So he used this to advantage. He picked up the nearest item and threw it at the wall. Luckily, it was only a pillow.
Harry winced at the name. In the past two years the pain had become more of a dull throb. He hasn't thought much of relationships since and he was fine with that. He had more important things going on, didn't he? He had the weight of the entire wizarding world on his shoulders. Besides, he doesn't want it to admit it to himself but the idea of dating someone else still felt too much like stabbing Cedric in the back.
Draco tilted his head upwards, the way he did when he wanted to sound more confident about something. "Perfectly."
“The boy looked familiar. Would his parents happen to work in Diagon Alley?”
"Do you want to be in a car full of muggles for hours?"
Draco's trolley squeaked next to Harry's as they made their way towards the loading dock. He was fitted with the same glamour  as a few days before to not bring attention to himself just in case there were death eaters on prowl. Harry wanted to point out if there really were death eaters he would probably already know and that their main focus would be on the Boy-Who-Lived, not the blonde. Then he realized that probably made him sound ignorant - that Draco was fine and had perfect reason to be worried- and he should keep his mouth shut before he started sounding like Professor Snape.
"Ow! Hey, I didn't mean to leave you there! I was in a rush, you know how it is... Besides, you found me anyway, right? Just like you always do."
It was almost eight hours later and Potter hadn't come back into the room. Never in a thousand years would he admit to being worried but rubbed in the wrong way. He could already tell the house wasn't that big from looking out the small window and seeing the identical, lined up houses across the street so it couldn't possibly take this long.
The door swings open.
"How's school?"
But Harry would still have to go back to that wretched house to get his trunk and wand. The thought alone sent shivers down his spine alone. Going back so soon would be signing his death warrant. The Durselys might have even snapped everything in half already, it wouldn't be new of them...
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry was staring up at it nervously. He was cradling his right arm as if old memories were resurfacing. Draco went to place his hand on the boy's shoulder to get his attention but stopped himself. Maybe that wasn't the best option right now.
Harry looks back at the door. He hadn't even notice Draco leave. A flicker of guilt seated itself inside him.
Harry bites his lip with uncertainty. "I just thought you'd want someone-"
Harry glares at him and makes a gesture suggesting a very violent action if he didn't give it back within the next half-second.
"Everyone's staring at you," Draco whispered snidely to the left of him. He was doing a horrible job of being inconspicuous for someone who was supposed to be a Slytherin. Harry suggested that he should act like he didn't know him but Malfoy had waved the comment off dismissively saying something about hiding in plain sight.
Blaise's words came back to him. Would that be true? Pansy and Blasie were the only other people who had seen him fuck up and explode like he just had. They were the only people he could ever consider friends, even if he knew they might just being using him to gain superiority in whatever pureblood rank nonsense that had been fed into all of them. Would they even care? Would they agree with him?
Trigger warning for the later part of the chapter
Maybe I am," Potter resorts.
Granger shrieks, breaking the silence. "Why on
Harry instantly deflates in shock. His brain stutters for a moment and his eyes take in more light than he expected, every part of him goes on pause while his thoughts catch up. He genuinely doesn't know what to say.
?" Harry fumed. His hand went instinctively for his wand in his robes only for him to remember they were still on the floor. He reached for them quickly and Malfoy's cold fingers grabbed him by the shoulder and pushed him back down into the seat.
"Could you be any gentler?" Draco whispered yelled. "There's no space up here so stop shoving me- ow!"
"You don't have too. Can see it in your eyes."
Beside him, Pansy made a face of pure disbelief. "You? He accepted you? You're- well you. What the hell do you have to offer? You're a half-blood! You're not even of age!" She whispered yelled. Her fists were clenched at her sides. "What do you have-"
Harry takes another step forward, not hearing the sharp edge in his voice. Draco bit back his tongue and clenched his hand on his thigh hard enough to leave bruises from under the desk. Draco was already teetering on the edge of a mental breakdown when he came in. If he didn't leave soon he would either start crying or screaming. Or both. It wasn't an order, it was a warning.
There was a gate of rough wood as big as a cow and ivy cascaded over the fence, growing tendrils in every direction. The stone path was punctuated with weeds after every stone. The dishevelled, un-manicured lawn was more moss than grass and was overshadowed by huge weeping willow flowing down onto the dank and squishy ground. Clusters of defiant daffodils reared their golden heads amidst the gloom and there were smatters of fuchsia alongside the scarlet and saffron hued primroses.
The guilt is ice in his guts. It could be a hundred degrees out and he'd still be frozen on the inside. Harry can't melt it with the way the man was looking at him. He can't even get a word out. It's as if his lungs were frozen and rapidly spreading it to the rest of him as well.
shut up?
“If you’re blessed enough to see it, you get a miracle. All the lost souls get one.”
He'd wanted to hate him just like his father did for long but could never bring himself to do so. Something about him just radiated warmth.
Kinda boring chapter again sorry lads. Have some self-destructive Draco Malfoy as a filter because how else do I cope other than project myself on my favorite characters?? His thought process is probably confusing af for other people but it’s exactly how I think so??? Next chapter is when things start picking up again.
"What now, Malfoy?"
Draco didn't wait up for his friends who called after him. He snatched up his bag by his table and showed his work inside quickly. His rigid form exuded an animosity that was like acid - burning, slicing, potent. None of them understood - and they only would when it was too late. They didn't see people dying on their dinner table. They didn't have to hear tortured screams in their childhood home. It was a joke, a game, to them. That angered him to no extent.
"And?"
"Hermione." He answered simply. Without her he wouldn't be standing where he was right now. Thinking about her only made him feel guilty. What would her reaction be if he told her that he'd been hanging around Draco this entire time? Salazar forbid Ron ever found out. He would have a field day. He still had multiple unopened letters sitting on top of his trunk just for that reason. He couldn't bring himself to lie to them even with everything happening.
"I don't know much about your home life Malfoy but I know he's wrong. Truce or not. People like that...I don't think they have much humanity left in them to realize what they're doing. They're blinded by hate."
He was hooked up to quite a lot of muggle devices: A permanent needle in his arm fed him some liquids and perhaps food, that part was unclear, while tubes took care of waste. There was also something called electrodes, mostly on his chest and neck, but they were removed after a few days. There was something around his arm that sometimes made a wooshing noise before clenching his arm hard and gradually releasing it, and a soft clamp on his finger, apparently the muggle version of some diagnostic spells. A clever workaround, to be sure, but it certainly showed how exhausting muggle life was. And here he was, among muggles for the next several years.
“But you don’t know anything useful about it, so clearly that is inadequate…”
“Okay, strawberries. What else?”
Later they heated the soup Kenny had left them in the microwave. Draco looked for the tiny waves heating his food as he saw it through the glass door, spinning slowly, but they were apparently invisible – or Harry had misunderstood the entire thing, perhaps. Draco heated both bowls of soup under Harry’s supervision, and once he figured out it didn’t need to boil, like the water had, it went quite well. It was certainly a perfectly good soup, a milky soup with bits of cauliflower floating around in it.
She looked like she wanted to say more, but Kenny showed up with their ice cream cones, and the lady looked terrified and left with a nervous “bye then”. Oh, yes, people were scared of punks, for some reason. How would that work in a hospital setting, then? Kenny would wear a uniform, and probably keep his hair down, but he would still look unconventional, wouldn’t he? But Draco was too overwhelmed to ask, or to hold a proper conversation at all. Kenny handed him his ice cream, and then he leaned on the railing, and Draco leaned back in his chair, and even though he realised there was no way this muggle ice cream was as good as Florian’s in Diagon, it couldn’t possibly be, it was the best ice cream he had ever eaten.
“What my mother did was despicable, and it was just luck that let a good marriage grow from it. I have told her so often enough, but she can’t see it. A good thing that I don’t have sisters, that’s what I tell her, because if she had two daughters to marry off, chances are the other one would not end so well. But she has no power over me now. And the children have godparents that are ready to take them if anything should happen to me and Marcus. She will never get to make decisions for them.”
“Look, Draco, like I said, I understand that this has been difficult for you. Hell, it was difficult enough for me, and I didn’t have that element of culture crash, you know, or, not much, anyway. Just, being alone so much all the time was hard enough. Still is, though it’s better. I remember the stage you’re at, though, and it sucked a lot, being so isolated.”
“Oh, more, definitely.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“We were going to get married. She was going to be the mother of my children! I’ve known that since I was just a child, and there was never any reason to doubt it, and now… she probably has children by now. With HIM. I can’t say I know how to deal with that, but I need to talk to her. I just miss her… so much.” His voice broke.
“And neither were your teachers, probably,” Kenny answered dryly. “That’s not just your posh school, you know, that’s the entire school system. It’s basically all ‘the nazis were evil, they tried to take over the world,’, not ‘the nazis were evil, let’s analyse how that evil worked and what evil is’. I mean, then they would have to look at our own colonial past, wouldn’t they, or at least make some obvious parallels. They never say shit about how we tried to take over the world too, pretty much managed it, even, and how evil was used to do that.”
Someone shook him awake, but somehow Draco was still in the dream, losing Vincent, again and again, smoke filling his lungs, filling them forever. The someone got him up into a sitting position, but Draco still did not feel like he could breathe, he just sat there, rigid, gasping, trying to hold on to the real world, trying to get the dream to leave his body.
“Thank you,” Draco said, and meant it. “And speaking of not dying, thank you for saving my life before.”
Draco stopped, spoon of soup halfway too his mouth.
“Off to bed, then,” the man said, breaking through Draco’s stalemate of indecision. Draco nodded and rolled out, Kenny behind him. Kenny watched Draco get into bed before refilling his water carafe and placing a single pill on the table. “If you have trouble falling asleep, take this, even though you’ve already had one today. But probably you won’t need it, most likely you’ll be asleep in five minutes. I’ll see you tomorrow. If you’re not up by nine I’ll wake you. Sounds good?”
Draco and Pansy had amended their vow at nine – they would not have sex when they married, because eww, and besides, they could just magic the stuff directly where it needed to go, anyway, and weren’t they lucky to have someone who also understood just how gross the whole sex thing was and didn’t want to, ugh,
Kenny woke him the next morning, and they moved through Draco’s morning routine together, a little clumsily. The porridge tasted a little different than Mary made it, but it had more jam on it, and Draco didn’t mind. Kenny had to spend some time looking for a clean pyjama, because Draco had no idea where they were stored, and that wasn’t written down in any of the papers Kenny had found in the office after Draco had gone to bed. But eventually Draco had a clean face and mouth and was wearing his clean pyjama. Daywear was still beyond him, but he now changed pyjamas every other day, oh, sweet progress, sweet hygiene! Over that he was wearing a dressing gown in dark blue silk – he liked that one so much he had asked Mary to get him one several in different colours, all dark, so he always had a clean one to wear. Spills, after all, was a fact of life now, as was the lack of cleaning spells, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t do his part to look appropriate.
“You don’t even know. Me at eight would be so happy with that.”
"Get me out of here," he wishes. "Please." Whether that was for the roof he was under currently, or something else entirely, he didn't know.
Draco's digging through his school bag for something so he has to look up to see what he's talking about. "Research."
Harry gawks at him silently. He opens and closes his mouth not knowing what to say. He hadn't expected Ron to go off on him like that. "But-"
"They won't even notice I'm gone."
"Madame Leverett did. I asked her to shrink them too."
Draco decided not to press for answers despite his worry. He had already pushed more boundaries than most likely get in weeks.
"Isn't it obvious?"
If acted on his impulse it'll only come back to haunt him. Draco was like Icarus, he flew too close to the sun. He would think himself invincible until the wax melted from his wings. He would be too busy enjoying his flight to even notice. He supposed pride did that, it blinds you to your own demise. Before he would know it he would be crashing down toward the angry sea.
"I'm fine. Really."
Tears racked the boy's small body as his back slid down the wall and to the floor. He was no longer the pristine boy he pretended to be and he knew it. Everything he ever did was to please him, never himself. Yet it was still never enough. No matter how cold or crude he became to be, his father would still have something to criticize.
Harry seems to take the sudden silence as a victory and smirks with satisfaction as he finishes putting the rest of his clothes.
"What happened?"
"I thought you were just scared as I was! Apparently fucking not. And you're not even worried! You probably planned it all out, didn't you! I should have guessed. Can't I just have
Published: 4/10/19
"What about your friends?"
None of them moved.
." Harry winces heavily, resting his head on the table and holding his stomach. Waves of heat coursed through his blood as cold sweat glistened in his gaunt features. It felt as if someone was injecting fire straight into his veins
"You didn't send a note."
Remus sighed and gave him a smile.
"You already know why I brought you here."
"Please."
"Is nothing I can't handle. I'm fine. Get out."
Harry leaned against the headboard to listen but winced loudly when his back hit the wall. Malfoy suddenly stops his one-sided discussion and looks over. It was clear he was concerned but trying not to show it.
I frown at him. "You realize that's nearly an hour drive, let alone a walk, right?"
"There you are," said Hermione. "Practice ended aged ago, where were you?"
Flesh-Eating Trees of the World? Check.
Draco tilted back his chair a little and his head fell back in a short laugh. "Probably. Those idiots don't even know how to cast a simple locking charm."
"So you're in the black and white and your father isn't? You have to be on something, Malfoy." He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath with a slightly pained expression. "We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are. And I think you can change."
"I couldn't believe it. It showed up dinner last night. Blaise thought I was about to go into cardiac arrest." Draco flung up his hands at the ceiling. He decided he could shove his doubts away for the time being. He'd never seen him so happy before.
Lmao sorry y'all. I gotta find a way to end chapters in ways other than cliffhangers. Also! I'm back in school again plus robotics every day after school so updates might get even funkier.  Sorrrry D:
Draco flicks his wand next to him with a quickly cleaning charm. Harry slumps back, dazed in pain. The worst part seemed to be over and the rest seemed to be fading fast after it. It still hurt like arse though. He tried to pull himself up with the sink only for his legs to give out halfway and his knee's to bang loudly on the bathroom tile.
Ron grabbed his bicep absentmindedly to steer him toward wherever they were meeting him which caused Harry to instinctively pull back roughly. If the other noticed he didn't say anything. They knew Harry was always a little jumpy at the start of every term and Harry always had to put it down as his cousin's cruel behavior. They had no idea what really went down in Privet Drive and Harry was hoping to keep it that way.
He looked over Hermione's shoulder where Ron was pushing both of their trolleys. He seemed to be just as excited and worried as Hermione because his face broke into a grin as soon as he saw Harry's face peaking out.
"Merlin, you really are dense, aren't you?" He rubs his forehead. "He's using you as a pawn in whatever twisted war games are going up inside his head. He's disfigured you like clay and turned you into a toy soldier. He left you there so you'll be moldable. And you- you don't even care! He has you wrapped around his pretty little finger."
Draco's heart clenched. How could someone hate someone so..so...
Harry looked between the paper and the boy in front of him. Draco said to trust him about the authenticity. He hoped for his sake it as true. He couldn't bare if Draco walked himself in a trap. He remembered thinking the same thing after his 'father' conjured a patronus when he was thirteen.
"He mentioned the death eater attack before term started. He wouldn't elaborate on what happened. He was very closed off about the entire thing..."
"Do you? Or do you just want revenge?"
"Cut the shit, Bhagat. What do you want?" It was Pansy who spoke first. If Draco didn't know any better he would have said her loyalty would have rivaled a Hufflepuff. It might have been a redeeming quality had it not been misplaced in a pure-blood hierarchy as well.
That lightens the mood quite a bit. Harry cracked a crooked grin at the redhead and she smiled back. She had always been able to lighten the mood when Hermione and Ron failed to. That was one thing he'd admired about her.
Harry's head snaps towards him. "What?"
Harry decided not to question the odd wizarding phrase. He had enough headaches as it was.
Harry huffed but otherwise stayed silent as Draco took the rope from his hands. He analyzed how far it was up. He didn't have much arm strength himself but if he stood from the top of the stepstool he just might be able to make it.
Draco didn't bother to elaborate. Harry figured as much. Sharing a house with death eaters and a dark lord wasn't exactly a kid's birthday party. Harry had just hoped for the best.
"Remind me P- Harry just how many times you have been attacked while inside that castle's walls?"
"Bullshit. You caught the snitch every time! You just wanted to play another match. I had to wait out with you to make sure you didn't fall on your arse again."
for much longer. Ms. Figg should get back from her work trip tomorrow morning."
he might be wrong about that though. Draco knew what he was doing was wrong. He didn't want to watch people be tortured in front of him, or murder muggles, or serve as the Dark Lord's right-hand man. His father did and lost his sanity a long time ago because of it. Harry's words come swimming back to him.
“I’m sorry too,” Draco said. “I have been learning, and I really think that’s a good thing, but I didn’t realise how much I needed to move beyond that. It’s like you said, I thought it was enough, or, I didn’t think, I just assumed, I guess. And I should have let you know, I just… didn’t realize. But it’s your business too. Not as much as Harry’s, but still. I’m really sorry I got to know you under false pretenses. I hope you know that wasn’t on purpose.”
“Alright there?” Kenny asked, coming up to the side of his chair.
“It felt like war at times,” he says instead. “I followed a man who wanted war.”
The first thing he was aware of was a sharp, unpleasant taste in his mouth. Unfamiliar, disturbing. The smell, too, was unfamiliar. Not just like the presence of a smell, but like something was missing, something that should be there but just wasn’t.
“Okay, just. If you want to talk about gay history, you should ask Kenny. No one will expect you to know a lot about it, most people don’t, including gay people, actually, except for the basics. Oh wait, don’t talk to him until I have explained AIDS. Which I’m not doing today, fuck, not ready for that right now. Okay, so, being gay. It was illegal, and then it wasn’t, stuff like that. Basically what happened was that people got scared of gay people. At first just gay men, then women too.”
“What? Hermione has a telephone?”
And then he was out there in the sunlight, and there were people walking along the sea front, and all the faces completely overwhelmed him. There were so many people he didn’t know – it was a bit much, and he stopped, staring. A child, clear-eyed and eager, pulling on her father’s hand, urging him to go faster. The father, tall, laughing, exasperated. Their faces were faces he would never see again, would not learn. Every face around him was like that. It felt too intimate, too overwhelming. He turned away, seeing an old lady, looking angry about something, muttering to herself. No, too much. Everyone were so beautiful, and too overwhelming, and he just could not take it.
“MOTHER! Hello!”
“Alright, very good. Now I know what to do for you. I will be frank with you: It will be extremely unpleasant, but it does give you a fair chance of survival, a fair chance indeed! I will leave you a folder of information for you to peruse when you feel up to reading, but that will be some time off yet. The recovery will take time. You will have a nurse to take care of you. Just listen to her, she will know what to do. Let me say that again, you are to listen to her and follow her instructions, that is extremely important. And don’t break the statute of secrecy, that’s very important too, obviously. Best of luck, Draco!”
And then the door dinged again. Harry opened it, and there was Mary, in a wheelchair pushed by her sister. Draco shouted in surprise, and then tried to navigate his own chair up to her side and hug her. That was even more difficult than the Harry hug had been, but just… Mary. Mary, Mary, Mary.
“Yeah, my sister has a good CD burner, so if I can borrow some CDs from you, then she can copy them for me. I can play them on my disc-man. It won’t harm your CDs, and I’ll be careful. I know how much you care about your music collection.”
He had been woken up by Kenny singing “happy birthday to you” very loudly. He explained, after, that this was a tradition from his family, and that he hoped Draco didn’t mind that he brought that here for him. After the initial confusion, Draco did not mind at all – it felt lovely, and he imagined being a little boy growing up with this tradition would feel very exciting.
“I’m so glad to think about you outside! Oh, to see you waste away in that bed – but that’s all over now. What is it like there, are there any gardens, any nature at all, or is it just houses and pavement?”
Usually they would have a cup of tea in hand – Draco would have his decaf, trusting Mary and Kenny who said stimulants were not good for him at this stage, but Harry didn’t care for “tea that didn’t work”, “tea with all the joy sucked out”, “swill that tastes like this fucking illness, I swear”, “no better than herbal”. Harry would have his builder’s tea, or else a cup of cocoa.
“We will take a break now. Just rest, Draco.”
“That certainly sounds like a much nicer way to go about it. But did you bring your muggle things from before?” He knew he did not have the option of bringing any comfort items, but perhaps Harry had some things that had not been as contaminated with magic.
“That was me, and it was very wrong of me. For whatever it’s worth I would never do that now, but...”
“Hermione, Draco is as homosexual as the day is long. We wouldn’t even have had sex for baby reasons, there are other ways to go about that. And we were best friends, just the very thought of kissing him on the mouth feels rather incestous to me, frankly. No offense to you and your husband, obviously that is different.”
“You know about that? But that’s not how it happened at all. I just froze. I just couldn’t do it.”
Granted, there had still been the little matter of Voldemort living in his house. His mother had accepted that too, to some degree. He didn’t know if she had any real way to resist it, but he found he was angry with her too.
Blink. Blink.
Teach me, wise masters.
“The headmaster,” Harry was choking. “He would… oh God, I can’t even imagine that talk. He would be all ‘Sometimes, Harry, our hearts makes decisions we cannot support with our whole selves…’ Oh no, I can imagine it, I really can…”
“No, that’s logical, but also… kind of stupid. Sorry, Draco, I’m done laughing, I just… it’s just a bit absurd. Spending that amount of money on chocolate. It would be like a dream to do that for me at, say, eight. I would spend all the chocolate money at a supermarket, though, to get more value out of it, not at the fancy place. Oh god, that would be a whole lot of chocolate.”
Blink.
That invitation could certainly have been delivered better, but Harry looked pleased enough.
“Certainly. And are there any prefered types of chocolate, for you or for the baskets?”
“And I figure that either you boys can pick one out for her and send it by muggle mail to me and I will charm it up for her, or I can just swing by a store and get it tomorrow, which would be faster, but then you don’t have as much a say in what type and all, what would be easier for her to use, unless you already know.”
She understood that he was distressed, though, and that getting rid of the beard was important to him. Even though nothing could change the fact that it had been there, getting it removed was a relief. His headache had gone from mild to throbbing within the hour, the muscle pain intensifying and Mary clucking over something the machines told her, but still, it had been worth it. A week later he had caught up to where he used to be. Mary said that the distress had probably done him more harm than the shaving itself, and sometimes life gave us dilemmas like that, and wasn’t he looking forward to getting better so there would be a bit fewer of those? He was. He absolutely was.
Mary also pointed out that in principle he had a lot of power over her as her employer, but that in practice he did not use it. Still, knowing it was there of course affected everything – for her. She was also on her hand very aware of her power over him as a nurse to her patient. There was a lot of power in knowledge, especially the state-sanctioned knowledge of a formal education, she said, which made sense. She talked about how nursing school also taught students not to use that power, mostly, but that it was hard to listen sometimes. Simply abstaining wasn’t possible, as sometimes you needed what she called soft paternalism – sometimes you actually needed to tell the patient what was best for them and steer them in a certain direction. Doing it when necessary and not doing it when it wasn’t was the most difficult part of her job, she said, and she had been in nursing for almost thirty years.
“Kenny,” Harry shouted as the other man reached the door, “we’re talking more about this later, you know we are!” He took a deep breath. “Okay, so. Draco. Do you want to do this? We don’t have to, you know. I know you were a child. I know you just did what you were raised to do.”
“Not false pretenses, really” Kenny answered, long after the natural time to answer had gone by. “You’re still you, aren’t you? I’m just having some trouble reconciling the you I know with Harry’s stories. Not that he’s telling those anymore, or have since we’ve known you, really.”
“Yeah, those are ugly things. But enough of kids grow up with hate and disgust of other groups in some form or another, and not enough of them shed it. I’m glad you did, man, really glad. Good for you, good for the world.”
“A what?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Okay, the thing indeed looked like a telephone, like he thought, and he’d seen pictures of those, and of people using them, too – lift it up to your ear and mouth and then push buttons, right? “Reception, press 0 and wait” said a little shiny text on the side of the thing. He did. For a long, terrible while, nothing happened, and then he heard a shouted “hello” very, very far away. He shouted back across the enormous distance: “Hello, hello, HELP, PLEASE HELP!” His voice was so broken, so fearful – and the voice far, far away said something, but he couldn’t hear what. “This is Draco Malfoy”, he shouted, “please help, please come to my flat and help, right away!”, hoping he was talking loudly enough to be heard by the other person. How odd, the way his voice came out, all squeaky, childlike. He couldn’t remember that happening before, back when things were worse.
Blink.
“And you’ve taken the opportunity it gave you, I can see that. You clearly have.”
“Exactly! And there are other food places that do that too, but pizza is practical because pretty much everyone likes some version of it, and there’s also variety, so it’s a good food to share. And it’s really good, I bet you’ll like it. Now, I’ll just call the pizza people, and you should have a think about which things your nurse usually does for you in a day, and what you do yourself. Because that’s one of the things Kenny will want to know, so he’ll know what to help you with.”
“I think I need to just… go be angry at him for a bit,” he got out.
Odd to have this stranger call him by his first name. Odd. Something not. Supposed to. Be like. That.
After lunch Kenny went out to buy things at some store where apparently they had a big variety of electronic stuff. He came back with a microwave, and said they’d be sending not just the mini fridge they’d agreed on, but also a big chest freezer. Draco didn’t know what a chest freezer was, but presumably there were no plans to freeze his chest, so he supposed it was best not to get in the way of Kenny doing what he thought best.
“Okay, so. Your carer situation. It’s not good – you really need to find someone to do some things for you, and fast, or you will lose a lot of progress, even if you could handle things yourself, which I’m not sure you can. I don’t know exactly how much help you need each day or week or whatever, but you said your nurse does basically everything and still has more free time than she used to, so probably it’s less than full-time, yes?”
“You’ve got it, mate. You just roll over there where it’s a bit more quiet, and I will get us an ice cream each? Just place yourself the way you want to sit. Any preferences?”
“Oh, fuck off, Ken, I get to decide myself who I help!” Harry exploded. “This shit happened to me, I am the one who experienced it, and will I decide exactly how to deal with that myself, thankyouverymuch! And I’m not making excuses for him either, okay? What Draco did was shit, he was a cruel little shit, yeah? And yes, he followed a guy that made my life hell on earth, and who wanted to make a lot more people’s lives hell, and of course I’m pissed about that, but I get to decide what to do with that! And I say it matters more what he does as an adult than what he did when he was just a snotty little kid! He was brought up to this shit, get it? He was pushed full of this propaganda ever since he was a child! Fuck, he was still a child! A FUCKING CHILD!”
“Thanks! It takes less time per CD than it take to play, so if I bring a few over when I see her next, I’ll bring them right back with me the same day. Man, I better get the lasagna in the oven, it’s happier when it’s done on low heat suuuuper slowly, though it works to just stick it in for half an hour too. So expect food in about four hours.”
“I shan’t, your rules are BULLSHIT!”
“So apparently your carer is still unconscious, but likely to wake up soon. They hadn’t told her sister much more than that. You’re not thinking of going to the hospital, are you? You look knackered, to be honest, and you probably can’t do much good there, so I don’t think you should, if you want my opinion at all.”
“Alright, blood pressure will have to wait, pulse at 87, oxygen at 97, hmmm” the someone said, a woman. A muggle, he reminded himself, presumably, anyway. He knew the words, pulse, oxygen, but that didn’t mean anything out of context. The numbers were all nonsense, of course. He heard a click. “Draco, can you hear me?” He felt his eyelids twitch as if commanded somehow, so he opened his eyes.
Draco felt strangely parented by all this, in a good way. “Sure, yes, that would be nice.”
It was, Draco thought as he drifted off, a very nice day this far, all in all. He was worried for Mary, though. Harry had received a text message from Vicky on Friday – “Please tell Drayco she will probably live”– which had been reassuring when he had assumed more messages would be forthcoming, but now, when no more messages had come, was quite the opposite. At the same time he didn’t want to disturb Vicky when it wasn’t necessary. Draco’s own situation was fine, after all, except for the worry gnawing in his stomach. He was fine.
“If anything, we were more nemeses than anything. I thought he was the absolute worst, and I behaved… well, really badly, actually.”
He had never heard his mother so scattered, jumping from topic to topic like that. He hoped it was just the telephone making her nervous, or the emotional impact of speaking together after so long. But at the same time, the relief of her voice felt like a poultice soaked with healing potion on his heart.
Her face looked a little slack somehow, and clearly she couldn’t walk very well if she needed the wheelchair, but she looked nowhere near as unwell as he had feared. He could see traces of what he had seen in her face the day she collapsed – like her face was less symmetrical than it used to be. She was beaming at him too.
What he wasn’t told was, for some reason, about the muggle disease he had. She only said the disease he had was rare, but she had dealt with a case just like his, which was why she had been asked to care for him. She had also had several patients with a much less rare disease which had the same underlaying “basic mechanism”. Even muggle diseases worked mechanically, Draco thought sourly, or else the muggles were obsessed with mechanical metaphors. He supposed he would find out which, in time.
“But it’s not like that! Everyone in the magical world is not surrounded by animagi or using the animagi spells or being animagi all the time without understanding even the basics about how it works! That’s why we have the animagus register. Your analogy doesn’t work!”
“Oh, that’s too bad. But maybe you could let me know what sort of books are good for the muggle OWLs, and I can get Kenny to get me some? People in the books always know chemistry and physics. They need it for things like the hyperspacedrive.”
We, he said. Harry still included himself in the muggles. Draco hadn’t realised that before now. Still, that was a terrible argument.
“Have you ever had intimate relations with a house elf?”
“No, stop that, there will be time enough for all that later. Look, I promised Ron I would have a weeknight without meetings every week, and he’s basically jealous as a dragon about my time on those days off, so let’s just get to it. So. Your mother needs a telephone.”
“What,” Harry said. “You look like you’ve just seen a ghost. Which is a muggle expression, because muggles don’t, you know. It wasn’t a joke because Binns is one, gah, I mean, it could have been, but it wasn’t. What I mean to say is, what’s going on?”
“You could have prioritised getting yourself and your friends out of there. Instead you chose to do the heroic thing, again.”
“And besides, what was I supposed to do but try to save you? There was fire everywhere. It wasn’t a situation with a lot of good choices.” Harry shifts uncomfortably. Oh, yes, heroics, he didn’t like those, Draco remembers. He used to think that was just a clumsy attempt to charm people, but it’s apparently honest enough. Still, Draco can’t resist poking it a little.
He had tried to have another ice cream at the café table, but that had turned out to be way too much – people making noises, people bumping into his chair, jolting him. They had to give up and retreat to the fence where they had the first ice cream. Kenny suggested they tried again on a greyer day, or off the season, but those weren’t the best days for ice cream, so it wasn’t as tempting.
“You ordered 120 pounds worth of super posh chocolate for each of us. And then you ordered more, for you. That’s like… you probably spent more than 400 pounds on chocolate. What the fuck, Draco. What is wrong with you. Oh, my stomach.”
“They married her off to Marcus Flint,” Draco croaked. “When I was sick, when I wasn’t getting better.” How did that pain always feel so fresh?
“You okay?” Harry said. Draco waved him off. He could do this.
Draco grabbed the glass from Kenny with both hands and drank deeply, hands unsteady.
“Yes,” he said. It came out a croak. He tried again. “Yes. I was.” He wanted to defend himself, but there wasn’t a defense, was it? There just wasn’t.
“Nothing is the matter with me,” he defended himself. “I simply used logic in the face of incomplete information.”
After a while he found it in himself to straighten, and look into Harry’s eyes, green and worried.
“I’m so sorry about your friend,” Kenny said gently.
Blink. Blink. Presumably she had indicated the same.
“Oh. How. Umh. I. You weren’t?”
“That is lovely, I would love to experience some of what have entertained you while you have been recovering. What is it like where you live? I requested the nurse find an apartment with a sea view when I heard you would be near the sea, if at all possible – did she find one?”
Kenny just laughed at that. But he seemed happy with the chocolates. He went down and checked when Mohammed was next working (that night), and Harry would get his the next day.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s interesting!” He defended himself, and his beloved sci-fi. “And very instructive! It is a very interesting way to learn about the muggle relationship with technology, which – ”
Early that winter, he got into classical science-fiction. It was wonderful – a real look into the relationship between muggles and technology. That relationship was so different than he would have thought. Some of it was just an excuse to place an action story in space, of course, but a lot of it was more about the implications of technology: If this, then what? If you could install useful hardware into the brains of newborns, and give every child the right to this equipment, then would society not finally become truly equal? If in-body pregnancy was no longer necessary, then how might that change the relationship between the sexes over time? If hard work for survival was obsolete, how would that change the culture?
“I am sorry, I just realised that Binns was the only history teacher you had access to. Most of the muggleborns, really. And that leaves some really big holes in your education. If Binns is still there, he needs to go,” Draco decided, in a rare rush of channeling his father on a political mission. Although if Lucius had seen the implications of this, he would have fought on the rest of the school board to keep Binns, of course. He might have without seeing the implications too, come to think. Harry was looking strangely at Draco now, so he explained in a rush:
He had Kenny, through pure dumb luck, because Harry had happened to walk in behind Mohammed that day. He would be fine, he felt certain about that. But he felt a lot less certain that Mary would be fine, and the nagging worry followed him into his nap.
Well, that was a generous way of putting it. Ridiculous, but generous. He had done what he had done, and Harry had somehow found his inner Hufflepuff and decided to be nice about it, even if that was also a bit stupid. But wait...
“...you’ve been isolated from your family this entire time?” Harry finished. “You don’t know how they are, they don’t know how you’re doing? You haven’t been able to talk to anyone for years? Nothing?”
Well, he knew that last part. Mary had explained that to him – how trying to do too much too fast would just slow down the progress further, or even reverse it. He would much rather have used his self discipline to push further, faster, but no, recovery would be slow, it would take years. This was what Mary had told him, and the letter gave her the right of it.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said awkwardly, an odd look on his face.“I feel like… shit, I WANT to have this conversation, and I know I started it, but I also am not really ready for it. Shall we, ummmmh, go test out the microwave?”
He still rested a lot, about five hours of every day went to some form of rest, but he felt so much stronger than he had, even while resting. It got even more boring, though, it always felt like he had energy to use that he couldn’t. This, Mary said, was often the tricky part for many people. The more he rested, the more of his non-resting time he could use to improve, to use his body. The rest supported all that. She wasn’t just talking about the stretching exercises and using the walker, but also things like leaning forward over the puzzle, leaning backwards in the sun on the veranda, stretching a hand out for his cup of tea. All of that was supported by the rest, she assured him. Just the right balance between activity and rest was the way, as it had been all this time, just that now that activity was more normal. He craved normalcy so much – so he rested.
Crying in front of Harry Potter again was out of the question. He clamped down, hard. He had gotten so used to loneliness that he didn’t always remember just how lonely he had become. And with that it was suddenly clear to him that it meant a lot, Harry being here, and that he wanted him to keep coming back.
“The receiver goes the other way,” Potter said nonsensically, as Mohammed pushed past into the kitchen.
Oh no, he sounded like a petulant child. Harry had stopped laughing, though.
Apparently that was it, because she gently patted his hand and moved out of his line of sight. He closed his eyes, exasperated. He wanted to protest that a few sentences didn’t cover everything he wanted to know and there was nothing wrong with his thinking just because his body was weak, but of course there was, he could feel it. Just like he had when he had fallen ill.
“Yeah, I mean, to know a reformed fascist, I guess. To see that there’s a way out of it. Because he keeps talking about their disgusting strategies to find lonely young men and recruit them, but then he has absolutely no sympathy for those same men once they’re in, and that sort of leaves them no way out, see?”
Speaking of which, he would have to keep these papers locked up somehow, they were dangerous if muggles got their hands on them. Did muggles have lockboxes? Of course, Mary had had every opportunity to read this for a year, and if she hadn’t by now, she probably wouldn’t either. But there were other muggles. A cleaning woman who came by on Wednesdays. Mary’s sister, who sometimes brought groceries. No, he needed to find a lockbox of some sort.
He might not feel up to history books, but he was reading more and more in that last period before he would get to leave his bed. Resting took up most of his time, but light reading was a close second.
Time ran on.
That made sense. Sense enough, anyway. He used to be smarter. Used to be smart. Long time ago now, years. Brain doesn’t do what it should. Body doesn’t either. So many Healers, but no answers. Until now. Muggle disease. Die among muggles. Except he wouldn’t, he somehow felt, he wouldn’t die. He would live. Live.
“Yes, I. Just a bit. Much.”
“She’s certainly very good at arguing for bending the rules when it suits her.” Pansy’s voice was a lot more indulgent now that the child was gone.
Well, that explained the absence of his mother, at least. That was a relief – no reason to think the muggles had caught her trying to masquerade as one of them. Knowing he would not get to see her, or anyone, for his entire recovery hurt, but at least now there was no reason to think she might not be safe. Oh, but how worried she must be for him! “Left to die among muggles” made a lot more sense now, even as sending him here had been the only reasonable thing to do. No part of this new information had changed that – if anything, it made even more sense now. He was glad his mother was a reasonable woman, even in her grief over him.
The elevator dinged, and Mohammed from the reception strode out. He was a young man with curly hair and a sweet smile, whom Draco had seen before because he sometimes helped Mary with groceries. He was slightly wild-eyed now, and certainly not smiling. And behind him followed, of all people, Harry Potter. That registered as vaguely strange, but there was no time to wonder about it.
“What I don’t see is why you got so mad at Kenny.”
Well, perhaps, but Draco was the one whose fault it actually was, so he failed to see how that helped. Seeing Greg without Vincent had also been so strange. Greg had come to visit at the Manor when Draco got sick, for as long as Draco was well enough to receive him. Every time he came, Draco was struck by the lack of Vince by his side. Greg was his own person, of course, he always had been, but he had also been part of a pair, more than Draco and Pansy, even. Malindra Goyle and Viola Crabbe were cousins and best friends, and their sons had been raised spending more time together than apart, and kept that up for as long as Vincent had lived. And now it was just Gregory. Now he had to deal with the world as just one person, not as part of a pair. If Draco missed Vincent, well, that could be nothing to what Greg felt.
Kenny nodded, thoughtfully. It was the truth, even if Draco had to twist it a little – leave out the muggle bit. The truth, and more importantly, the true story.
He was not in hospital, he was in his own apartment, which apparently had been bought for him, in a town called Hastings, which he vaguely recalled as being on the south coast of England, but which was a largely irrelevant place because there weren’t any wizarding society there for the last thousand years.
“Don’t be sorry, he deserved it. He never thought his shit would catch up with him. He thought consequences were for other people. Lesser people.”
But he couldn’t have explained that to Mary even if he had been able to speak, so just like he pretended to understand about the electrodes and wheelchair and elevator and what-not, he didn’t explain to her about the beard. He would have to keep the statute of secrecy, and Mary was a muggle. It was as simple as that, really. He couldn’t ask too many questions, even later, or betray his ignorance, or he would be discovered, and quite possibly burned at the stake.
“And your logic was ‘I want chocolate plus I want to gift chocolate equals buy such much chocolate’. Oh god, this is amazing and also a little terrifying.”
“I’m glad. That is sad, though, that she still can’t see it. So. You’re all over Draco, then? Harry said he was really distraught over losing you, still.”
Nothing had changed, and everything had changed. Some of it made sense, and some of it was more puzzling. Wizards adopting muggle fashion was something he could not have predicted.
“Oh,” Kenny said. “I’m sorry.”
The proposed cure for this illness was a total and complete avoidance of magic, and allowing plenty of time for recovery. The patient should not only avoid using magic himself, or using any sort of magical items, there would be no proximity to magic in any form – no magical items, people or creatures who used magic, or even items that had been around magic for any considerable stretches of time.
Draco nodded again. Harry seemed nervous. Talked too much, too fast. Then again, he sort of always did, back in school. And he was right that Draco’s situation without a carer was very bad indeed. For a worried moment there he had thought maybe Harry was planning to offer himself to help. Now that would have been a recipe for disaster. No, he needed whatever Harry had cooked up, and it was unlikely to be a ploy.
“Excellent. Can you confirm for me that everything you answered yesterday was true?”
“Fair enough. So, what do you want your day to look like?”
Muggle music was varied and lovely. He enjoyed most of it, both the process of exploration and the ones who found their way into regular rotation. He would lay flat with his eyes closed, listening to a whole record at a time. He would read the booklet first – not the lyrics, that was for later, for records he especially enjoyed, but the name of the songs, the names of the people who had written the lyrics, the music, who played which instruments. Usually he would do a new unheard record after his morning rest (listening to music was, apparently, to be considered a light activity at his current functioning level, but for some reason Mary still didn’t count classical music).
Draco drove his own chair over the threshold with the joystick, slowly in case of any bumps, but the floor aligned nicely with the street. Mary had said she had picked this building in part because it would be so easy to get out – he would not have to deal with ramps, which she had assured him was such a bother, though of course very helpful when needed. Oh, Mary should see him now.
“You came to my flat straight after a long day at work. Thursday could have gone so very wrong if it had not been for the three of you,” Draco told him, perhaps a bit more forcefully than necessary. “If just one of you three had not been there, my life would be in shambles right now. Imagine if I had to tell my mother I didn’t show my gratitude with a gift, she would be shocked.”
“No, just a varied selection, please. I’m sure it will all be lovely.”
Blink. Somehow that felt more insulting than the intrusive questions yesterday.
He wanted to talk with his mother about all this when he came back. The chocolate taste in his mouth turned bitter at the thought. Thankfully he had years to prepare for that conversation.
Draco frowned. He had nice and comfortable enough clothes – the ones he actually used, which were night clothes with a dressing gown, and a set of proper clothes, for when the time came to go out. He missed his wand, but he had as many remote controls in his life as he thought he was likely to have any use for. But…
“I know, I know, sorry.”
At first Draco thought all this must mean that in this, at least, the wizarding world was superior. But the pressure in the wizarding world, and especially among the purebloods, was to contribute to the magical gene pool, or else. And it should be done within the sanctity of marriage, because that was the traditional way. And wizards didn’t have sperm banks (they could have, though! They could! It would be easier with magic! We have the technology!). But oh, the implications… Draco had read enough science fiction to know that when technology changed, the culture would follow, with some delay, but it would usually not look nearly as tidy as one expected. He was not sure he wanted to explode the pureblood marriage by making it redundant.
Harry hung up and turned to Draco.
“I guess I am, yeah. I mean, I feel pretty sure he will stick around. And it will probably be good for him, too.”
The papers in the folder were confusing, to say the least, but there was a letter that gave some sort of overview of the situation, all “he” and “mr. Malfoy”, not “you”s or sensible language. Well, Draco was good at complicated language, it was what his brain ran on on its own accord, even while sick. While the papers had some words he didn’t know how to make sense of, the sum total was pretty clear: He had been completely wrong about his disease.
Draco experienced the outside for the first time in years about early in June. He was in his wheelchair, and he had done a test run down to the reception the week before with Kenny. Still, it was all new: The elevator ride felt exciting this time too, and very much like science fiction – a silvery, square capsule moving through an invisible shaft to get him to his destination, yes, but also the hissing sound, the feeling of utter newness of experience. He was already a bit high on it when he reached the ground floor and rolled into the reception.
“Oh, this and that. Gardening, quite a bit of reading, visitors for tea, that sort of thing. A spot of politics, now and then…”
Blink. Blink. He had it when he was four. It had been nothing like this.
“I don’t know how it is,” Draco admitted, “I’ve never done this before. But I do feel very tired, maybe bed is a good idea.”
“Bye, be good, or so help me god,” shouted Kenny, door slamming behind him.
“Nah, not on you. But Draco, I find this is all hard to deal with. I don’t know how I can… I mean, it changes the way I see you, you know. I hate people like you. Sorry, but it’s true, I do.”
“You do that,” Kenny said, starting to clean the table as Draco rolled into his room. He moved over into a soft chair and leaned against the headrest. How had he not known until today how angry he was? It seemed impossible, and yet he was sure it was true. Still, here it was, burning, and he was still somehow who he had been then, trying to make his father proud, his father who had dangled continued fatherly love in front of him as bait.
This summer he could probably venture outside, Mary had said. He would be using a wheelchair, and if that went well, eventually he could walk out to the little sidewalk café and sit there having a cup of tea. 137 steps each way, Mary had counted, but of course the real challenge was all the sights and sounds. Anyway, if it turned out to be too much, she could always retrieve his wheelchair to help him back. But on a good day he could already walk that amount inside. It wasn’t a lot, granted, but it was a lot more than nothing. He was getting there.
As he was able to talk more, he found himself missing Pansy intensely. He missed her input, and the feeling of it being them against the world. It had always been the two of them, ever since their solemn vow at five that they would marry each other. The adults had been delighted, and confirmed the engagement, instead of discourage them, which Draco only later realised they hadn’t had to do.
The muggle music machine was big, taking up most of a whole shelf in his room. Each recording of music, called a CD, was organised by theme – most often the theme was who had composed or performed the music, but there were others, like instrument. By reading the music magasines he also learned that a selection of music that the musician or band had created since the last time they published a recording was also a popular theme of organisation, or what had come out by various artists that many people had liked. The music machine had a remote control, of course it did. He was getting used to the machines to control other machines now, and it was certainly very useful for him, stuck in bed as he still was.
“I know, I… only just realised I was angry with him. Just as we were talking.”
“And she seems very knowledgeable too, that surely helps as well.”
“I see, but… in a hurry to get you in here? Why the hurry?”
Kenny did wake up before lunch, and looked quite a bit more rested, too. He made them bread with some scrambled eggs that were also full of vegetables – tomatoes, peppers, greens, squash. Draco had never seen eggs served like that before, but he found it quite enjoyable. And the dinner was already made, the famous lasagna that was supposed to be as good as the one they had enjoyed on Friday. If it was, Draco was excited for that meal as well.
“Just rest,” the man repeated. “Don’t even try to think. Mrs. Malfoy, if you will join me in removing some things from this room? Just that one, and this portrait for now, and then I will explain later. No, not by wand, by hand only, please. Ourselves, no house elves. Okay, that’s good.”
“But I read this book last year,” Draco said this Tuesday, too, “this muggle book – ” Harry laughed, fondly, as if he was saying that of course you did, Draco, of course you did, but also, probably, because by now it was expected, a small joke between them. Draco forged ahead. “And it’s from the early 1800s, and it really seems marriage customs were a lot more similar to wizarding ones than today’s muggle marriage customs are.”
He had dreamed about the tubes. About in the beginning, being stuck in bed, tied to machines, not even understanding what they did, having only foggy ideas. Tubes into his body, delivering the incomprehensible medicines of a people he had been taught his whole life to hate and fear.
Harry must have seen that he had lost Draco to somewhere dark, and charged on, dragging him out of there.
“Happy birthday,” Mary said, with some difficulty.
“Hah, as if my family would ever tell me stuff like that, even if they knew. Which I can assure you they didn’t, they weren’t really interested in the world around them, not like that. But even if they wanted to… see, what you don’t seem to get through your head is that there’s a LOT of muggle technology. NO ONE keeps up with it all, it would basically be a full-time job. No, a lot of full-time jobs, really. Even knowing everything about just microwaves probably would.”
Harry gave Kenny the finger, then looked around to check Mary wasn’t looking their way. Draco had heard them argue about this before, and knew he would enjoy both of their selections. They were both excellent people to talk music with – separately. Any conversation about music that involved them both seemed to end up in a skirmish over the boundaries of punk.
Blink.
Harry took a little bow from his position in the sofa. “Thank you, thank you, I’m here all week.”
“Oh, fuck, I’m sorry, you what?”
“Very lucky,” he managed to answer. Then, “I started by finding things in Rolling Stone Magazine. Mary would buy whatever I found that sounded interesting. And then more stuff by the bands and artists I liked, and then sometimes the shop manager would recommend things, once Mary started coming in and buying stuff once a week. I am actually rather looking forward to meet that shop manager myself, once I get well enough to go there in person.”
“A selection sounds good. So you... call a pizza place and ask them to make the pizza and bring it to your flat, right?” Harry looked happy about that.
They didn’t talk about her marriage. They didn’t even talk about her children. He appreciated that she was holding back, for now.
“Okay, what the fuck?”
“Oh. I am really sorry, Draco, I didn’t realise. Wait, so. You just stayed in the wizarding world until you were dying, and only then did you get desperate enough to accept muggle help and move here?”
She was clearly curious, but didn’t quite want to ask. Well, that was nice, he supposed, Harry had told him to be prepared for a barrage of intrusive questions, it happened a lot when out and about in a wheelchair, but this lady had at least kept a rein on her curiosity. He appreciated that.
“Hmmmm. Perhaps I will need to ask Ms Granger for tea again.”
Having someone poke his arm with something sharp, almost feeling like it broke the skin, even, but being helpless to stop it.
“Oh, no. Oh my God. Harry thought Draco was pining for you. We had this long talk about it, actually, and… Romantically pining, I mean. And Harry, Harry still thinks… wait, is that phone still on? Hello? Hello!? Draco?”
“Copy?” Draco looked at him, confused. He knew there was a thing called a photo copier, but he’d never heard of copying music.
There were snatches of memory.
“SO WERE YOU!” Draco found himself shouting, and now he was sobbing too, fuck. “You were too! Just a! Child! And they did not care about that, they didn’t give a shit! But you were just a little child, and they took that from you! After they had already taken your parents!”
There was, apparently, in town, a club for gay men, where they could meet, and presumably form connections. It was, puzzlingly, called O’hoi Sailor. Kenny went there sometimes, he said, though of course he hadn’t been as much when he was in a committed relationship. Harry went there too.
“And how is it that ‘most people’ have decided not to dislike these two genres specifically? That sounds like being prejudiced to me. And believe me, I have been prejudiced about a lot of things in my life.”
“Are you sure? He seems like the quintessential Gryffindor to me.”
“We can start off by boiling water in it, as a test. Or, even better, for tea! I could do with a cuppa.”
“There was a fire,” he said instead. “I haven’t dreamed about it in a long time, but. My friend, Vincent, he died. And I nearly died. And my other friend, too. Harry saved us. We didn’t deserve – it was our fault, the fire. My fault. My fault, mine. I was so stupid, so stupid, so…” He succumbed to dry sobs, half amazed that his voice had carried so many words before giving in. He must have screamed a whole lot before waking up, because his throat felt so sore, like it had the day after, like smoke.
“Nice,” she repeated again, economical with words and syllables in a way she had never had to bee before. But Draco knew her, he knew she would have used more words, would have said something like “Yes, haven’t I always said that Mohammed is a very nice young man.” And probably she would have added something about how clever he was, too, always reading his advanced math books behind the reception counter when there was nothing to do, and how clever it was to get a job like that as a student, if you could handle the interruptions. And possibly she would add something about the stroke, but of course, that was new, so he didn’t know what she would say there.
Draco and Harry got hold of Mary’s sister in the afternoon, after resting and having dinner. She said she had meant to call, but she had just been so overwhelmed with everything going on, and Draco seemed to be in good hands for the time being. Mary was awake and would be okay, but coming back to work wasn’t going to happen for a while, if ever. She would be in the hospital for a while, and then recovering, which she could do at Vicky’s place.
“No, you…” He did not want Harry to leave. Harry seemed determined to help, but the thing was, he might disappear, right? Mary had disappeared. And Draco wasn’t well enough for this to happen. He blinked at Harry, brain slowly catching up. “It’s okay, please stay. And yes, I think I do need a nap. Umh.” He wasn’t in a good place, that was for sure. His thoughts seemed to be swimming in and out of focus. He hadn’t felt like this for quite some time, and he didn’t care for it – in fact, the tiny reminder of how bad it could be, how bad it HAD been, felt like more than he could stand.
He didn’t know if Harry felt convinced by his logic or amused by him somehow – a quiet smile as he flipped through the thin, yellow pages had Draco suspect the last of them.
“I have. I wanted to, before, you know, when I was so ill. There’s a lot that I missed when I was in school. I wasn’t a bad student, but I wasn’t exactly equally interested in everything.” He hadn’t taken muggle studies, he thought.
“Stop mocking me, if you please. How was I supposed to know how much chocolate costs, or that I would have to deal with the cost before the bill came? I knew the roses and chocolates together were 73 pounds, but I had no way of telling how much of that was the flowers and how much was the chocolate, or how much chocolate Mary would be getting. Or whether the baskets was a large additional cost. So I added a reasonable buffer so as not to make the chocolate lady suspicious, or otherwise make a fool of myself. But I think I did rather well, in the circumstances.”
“It’s not like that, Pansy.”
Why hadn’t he told Kenny, though? Draco knew today was the first of June, vaguely, but still. The closeness to his birthday hadn’t really registered.
“No, I. I am sorry. I am not really hungry yet, but we can look at the microwave if you want.” Draco wanted the last word in this strange dance of apologies, and he had it now, he was fairly certain, by squeezing in one last apology. Harry caved.
“What on earth have you been reading, Draco?”
“Very well. Was this within the last five years?”
And then there were other things to do. Careful stretching exercises. Learning to eat again, first porridge, and then other soft things. There was sitting up straight, not semi-reclined, but still supported. There was rest, eternal, annoying hours of rest. One day soon, though, Mary promised, he would be able to sit in one of the two chairs. He was excited for it, the thought of moving there, and sitting there, feeling his body supported by something that wasn’t this bed. The thought of progress kept him going.
Draco obediently went for his phone. He had not used it much yet, but he had it on him when Kenny went shopping, and him and Harry were practicing sending text messages. Could it really connect him to someone in the wizarding world, though? Could it bridge that gap?
“And it’s not up to Kenny to forgive you. It’s up to the people you have harmed. I have forgiven you, by the way. And so has Hermione. I don’t really know about anyone else.”
“Oh no, oh FUCK, oh NO,” they heard Mohammed shout from in there. Harry ran after him, and Draco dropped the part of the phone he had been holding onto and followed on his wheels, as fast as he dared to go without risking heelclipping the other man with the foot rest of his wheelchair.
Most muggle music, it turned out, did have lyrics, just like wizarding music did. It was only the classical that didn’t, and the occasional record or track. But the music itself still played a much greater role than he was used to. Much of it was far better, which was infuriating, because wizarding musicians had magic and could have applied that properly to make even better music. They hadn’t, though, or at least not as far as Draco knew. They had just used magic to make background noise, in support of singing, which was for the most part not very good either. It annoyed him, but he still wasn’t about to miss out on exploring, because music was rapidly becoming his main joy in life.
“Certainly, love, we can do that for you. So, are you thinking gift baskets, or…?” she let the words hang in the air. He was used to magically concealing the presents, but he supposed muggles might hide them in baskets. The gift Mary had gotten for his birthday had been wrapped in shiny paper, but a basket sounded like a sensible way of doing it too.
The improvement of that first year was both frustratingly slow and exhilaratingly fast. Draco made visible progress from week to week, and yet there was always so much he still couldn’t do. He tried to focus on what he could, though: He learned to drink water, first dripped into his mouth by Mary, then sucked from a soft tip fastened to the side of his pillow whenever he wanted it, and eventually through a straw as he was half-sitting up.
Kenny did. “Okay, it’s not impossible to make good country music,” he judged. “This is really good. And I didn’t think country would be about that – you know, homelessness, air pollution.”
The thought of skipping oral hygiene was absurd, but so was trying to work this man into the steady routine he and Mary had for this sort of thing. Somehow either option seemed perfectly impossible, and he found himself just staring back at Kenny, wide-eyed.
“I have arranged everything with Gringotts”
He was not supposed to move yet, because even that would be beyond his limits. Just breathing consciously, and blinking when information needed to be exchanged, was enough, and there would be time enough for everything else later.
He talked to Pansy at length later that night, not letting on that he had been present to her surprising array into friendship with Hermione. Pansy had plenty to say about what people had been up to.
A loud, long beep in his ear interrupted his thoughts. He jumped. Oh, the ringing, there was supposed to be a ringing tone, and while he wouldn’t call this ringing, necessarily, it had to be that.
Blink.
And so they did. It wasn’t the same, but it was still pleasant enough. After Harry left, Draco couldn’t stop thinking about it, both how Harry had claimed to be there when he tried to kill Dumbledore, and that he insisted Draco had been overruled by himself, his moral, his character, and that was why he couldn’t cast that Avada. That it was not cowardice. He still thought it was nonsense, of course, but even so – the guilt of being a coward seemed to have shrunken a little. That guilt and the guilt over being on the wrong side had never seemed to balance each other out, opposite as they were. They still didn’t, but they felt a little closer to an equilibrium now.
“Not letting you have pizza for lunch, you’re as bad as Harry,” Kenny grumbled, but he did go back to bed and stayed there for a while. Draco thought he might want to buy headphones like Harry had – that way he could have listened to music while Kenny slept. Surely this wasn’t the first time he would be up when Kenny was sleeping after work. Yes, he wanted headphones. He would have to ask Harry about it.
After Draco’s nap they made a plan for the weekend and the next week. Harry would come over the next day, Saturday, and Sunday. “Harry needs rest too,” Kenny told him. “So don’t you two go all school day nostalgic and talk so much you forget to rest, okay? He can use my bed, I don’t mind.” Draco didn’t tell Kenny that school day nostalgia would not be an easy place to go for the two of them, and that it was probably better avoided, too. No point in trying to explain that. That could be Harry’s job, Draco decided. Harry had made them seem like friends, almost, or friendly acquaintances, so it was Harry’s problem. “School mate, like,” he had explained their relationship over the phone. If Kenny were to know that “school nemesis, like” would have been a much more accurate description, that would have to be Harry’s responsibility.
Lucius had made a soldier out of Draco. Oh, Draco had gone along with it, and been mighty proud of it, too. It hadn’t been a hard decision. It was his own fault as much as anyone, but his father had been a weight on the wrong scale.
“Fair enough, it’s a rough sketch and I promise to take it as such. Now tell.”
“Hi, Harry. Hi, Draco, I’m so sorry about this phone situation you’re in, we’ll fix it, I promise.”
“I told you I was sorry,” Hermione’s voice came through, weaker, far away.
“You are right, she would not have taken that well. And you’re right that it’s true. I have few qualms about lying when something is as important as protecting the statute, really, but it gets in the way of relationships, and I don’t like that at all. Oh, by the way, I recently learned muggles are very unlikely to burn witches at the stake these days.”
She wasn’t the only gift. She and Vicky had brought him two lovely notebooks, and Harry and Kenny presented him with headphones. Oh, so that was why Kenny had been so insistent that there wasn’t time to help him buy headphones until next week, and that it would just have to wait. Sneaky, for a Hufflepuff and a Gryffindor. He should have noticed. There was also a CD from each of them, both with handwriting on instead of a print.
“They are. And it feels like I understand that whole thing people were saying about Leonard Cohen – that his music is influenced by country music. No, this is actually something. Can I borrow it to copy?”
“That does not help at all, as Longbottom’s sorting has always been an utter mystery to me. Well, except for the snake thing, maybe. It’s odd, though, isn’t it, knowing Kenny, a man our age, and talking about him like this. Normally everyone I know WAS sorted, and we know where, too. I only ever experienced that with the Durmstrang boys before. Apart from that, everyone in my life went to Hogwarts, everyone.”
And then he grabbed a carrot and rolled off, because he didn’t feel quite ready to see Kenny’s reaction to that.
I'm at the stage of writing where several things should happen first, and I am trying to wrangle the next few chapters into a good structure. At least I am learning a lot about structure?
On the kitchen floor was Mary, laying very still and looking very, very wrong in the face. He called out her name. She didn’t react. He swallowed back the bile rising in his throat, forcing it down. He couldn’t force back the feeling that a part of him wanted him to freeze in place and never move again, though, or the images of from the war which were flooding his field of vision uninvited. So much death, so much blood – but the worst were the parade of dead bodies that had no blood on them at all. Mister Goyle, Greg’s father, face strangely purple. Professor Lupin, so pale. Aunt Bella, with her head doing something it shouldn’t be able to do. Strangers and known faces, laid out after. After.
Apparently the bed and remote control was a new technology, and Mary was excited about being able to test it for the first time, because it would give her patients more independence, and wasn’t that nice? It was nice. The remote control reminded him a little bit of having his wand, actually. He really missed his wand, the lack of it felt stronger the better he got.
“Just because your father has a mouth on him doesn’t mean you should grow one too, and you clearly don’t know what you’re saying. You know perfectly well you are not allowed to swear – ”
“I think flowers is the traditional thing, but also chocolate, I think, and sure, cards. I usually order Hermione flowers for her birthday, you can just call a local flowershop and have them deliver it. We could do that.” Well, that sounded handy.
“Thanks. Okay, let’s figure out the money thing, then.”
“Oh, you startled me, I was in music land. You look more rested, good. Okay, so, I have an idea, and I think… shit, sorry. Do you want some tea or something first?”
“Well, shit. So you’re not well enough to go out yet. That’s all the more reason to fix you up with a carer of some sort, then. I have a thought, but seriously, you look exhausted. Do you… umh, need a nap? I can just sit here and wait. Or if you’re not comfortable sleeping knowing I’m in your apartment, I could go to that café just outside, have a coffee or something, and come back later. It’s no trouble.”
“Do that, I am sure you will have a lot to talk about. But tell me, what have you been doing with your time? With both me and father… away?” His father would never get out of Azkaban, they both knew, but this wasn’t the time to talk about that.
“My father would have… I don’t know what he would have, but it would certainly not have have been nice.”
Getting mad
“Why history, though?”
Blink. Everything was syrup. Blink.
All Draco could do was nod and squeeze his eyes shut. He wasn’t about to cry again. He wasn’t.
(See the end of the chapter for
After, he cried violently for several minutes, and then suddenly stopped, clear-headed, clear-hearted. He had his mother back. Next time they talked, he determined, he would thank her properly for sending him here. And ask her about the war. And tell her about the nazis.
“Oh, wait, so you two are not exes?” Kenny said. “I’m sorry, I just kind of assumed you were school sweethearts or something.”
“No, I do. Just not that part. I keep thinking, though – don’t you think it’s weird how we’re talking as if I’m the only one in the group you hated, while Kenny is the actual muggle here? But he thinks it’s just a race thing, and I mean, we can’t tell him.”
“Vincent…” he started with a croak, but his voice gave out again. At least he was calmer. He felt himself being deftly manouvered back on down the pillow. “It’s okay,” Kenny whispered, “you can go back to sleep.” And somehow, he did.
Now that he had been outdoors, it felt like everything was possible, though of course he understood it would still be slow going. For now, he and Kenny went outside every Wednesday, but they never ventured far. Draco had rolled up and down the street, a short distance each time. He had even crossed a busy street, which had been terrifying – Kenny had assumed Draco knew the traffic rules, whereas Draco didn’t know anything about that but what he had surmised from seeing what little traffic he could see from his balcony. Kenny kept reassuring him to behave as a pedestrian – Draco, you count as a pedestrian even though you’re on wheels, no, you’re not a bike, argh, Draco, just act as if you’re walking wherever that’s possible. On the plus side, all of Draco’s confusion was chalked up to the wheelchair, so that, at least, was something.
“Yes, exactly,” Draco cut him off harshly. “Oh, nobody used that word, but you know perfectly well that does not matter. It was the same thing. It was… fascism and racial supremacy. That’s what it was.”
“That makes sense. Can’t say I know a lot of the wizarding history either. Binns wasn’t the most engaging teacher.”
“You’re good at cooking,” he commented.
“Hello, Hermione. Thank you for helping with this. And let me just say that I am so sorry about...”
“Exactly, exactly. And in our case, Draco being how he is –”
Bach was his favorite composer, and most days he would just have a single record in the player and play it repeatedly, but at other times he liked other things. There was a series of four Mozart records, which had singing in it, a whole story of singing, and with muggle notions of magic in it. It was in German, and sometimes he enjoyed that one too, although he didn’t speak much German. Mostly, though, he liked listening to new music. He started moving beyond the classical, too.
Kenny had double day shifts both Saturday and Sunday, and after that he had a “more sane” schedule. Taking it easy on Monday was probably best, though, getting some rest in, with luck a few hours of work here would be enough that day, Kenny said. The lasagna in the oven had a brother already in the fridge that they would eat that day, so Kenny wouldn’t have to cook. They would attempt a partly assisted shower if Draco was feeling up for it, though. He really wanted one, he normally had one on Friday, but showering was definitely a heavy activity, so it really shouldn’t be attempted until Monday. Tuesday, arrival of the freezer and small fridge, and then grocery shopping and batch cooking, and maybe a chat to see how things are working out for us both so far, yeah? Wednesday, well, hopefully a calm day and then the evening shift.”
But the door closed, and the healer was gone.
“I don’t care that you’re sorry! You assumed he had me practically locked up! And your ‘apology’ was terrible – ‘bla bla, I assumed he was bad because I thought he was bad’ – not worth the time it took to say it, certainly.” Pansy’s voice was getting rather further away too, even as her volume had clearly gone up quite a bit.
“Mary Gauthier. She’s lovely. Morose, but lovely. Very good lyrics, very good interplay between lyrics and melody. Oh, and her voice! But I feel certain you’ll like the lyrics.”
“That makes sense,” Kenny conceded, sounding a bit more relaxed now. “What’s next, then?”
He blinked. He could do that.
“I am glad to –”
He wished he could add wizard versus muggle to the conversation of their differences, but of course he could not. Instead they talked about how his family had the power to buy her services, even as most people with the exact same needs as Draco would not have that option. They might have to be cared for by a rotation of carers who came in to do only the most necessary things and then left, or by an already overworked family, or, fairly frequently, not at all. He had not even considered his access to a nurse as a luxury, just as a tedious need. The idea of that same need, but unfulfilled, was deeply disturbing.
“Normally at the dining table, but maybe the kitchen table with a nice table cloth on it? It’s not that tall, I think I can probably sit there for half an hour or so.”
They left, the door closing behind them, the sounds of his mother and the healer removing things echoing painfully in his head. Sleep took him fast, but he could hear them in the distance, removing several more things from his room. Voices drifted in and out of his sleep, his mother and the healer, words that didn’t make sense.
“Forget it,” Harry said, looking wary. Draco shut his mouth, ready to listen to whatever warning implied in that wariness, but Kenny clearly was not interested in doing any such thing.
“Not exactly,” Harry protested.
“It’s a good place to start, I think. And it makes sense to have a solid understanding of things. I see you’ve been reading history lately too.” Kenny threw all the carrot tops in one of the pots, for stock, and started on chopping the rest of them into small, even pieces.
This was starting to feel a lot like that day in May when Harry had stepped in and solved things. Figuring stuff out that Draco couldn’t, calling people Draco didn’t know to call – the ambulance, Vicky, Kenny. That had worked out, hadn’t it? He had been saved from a very difficult situation back then. And he felt a flutter of hope in his chest. Was this possible? Could it be? Could he talk to his mother? Could he talk to Pansy? Greg, perhaps? But oh, his mother especially. He could let her know he was okay. Hear her voice. Know how she was doing, alone in the Manor.
He just lay for a while, quietly enjoying the feeling of possible, before he even took advantage of it, before real thoughts started forming. They had taken him away, hadn’t they. Away. To die among muggles, his mother had said, after the healer tried to save him. Except he was alive. He had a chance to live, the healer had been very insistent on that point. So perhaps he hadn’t failed. That was it, then, that must have been it, yes. So. The healer had figured it out, he’d told Draco. And now he was among the muggles, that must be why everything smelled wrong. Why would they send him to muggles? Muggle medicine better? No, his mother would not have believed that, even if the healer somehow did. So. Because of the rare disease, that’s why. Because... it was a muggle disease? That only the muggles knew how to cure?
(See the end of the chapter for
He waits impatiently at the edge of the fence as Harry digs around inside the tiny building for Salazar know what.  He had to bite his tongue in order to snap at the boy for taking so long.
. The Manor library was huge and he prided himself on having read nearly every medical book there was. Being a Healer was his secret passion. Just another thing he could never act on.
Harry grit his teeth as the man sat behind the desk that separated the two of them. "Yes."
Harry ignores him as he picks himself off the floor. Dudley was just wanting to provoke him so he could get in trouble, Harry knew that much by now, but it didn't stop him from wanting to sock him right there. This seemed to bug Dudley even more, pushing him to continue.
It just now occurred to me that you guys don't understand the chapter titles- I originally started to write this on Wattpad and there I can music in front of the chapters. So the titles are based off songs, oops-

"A what now?"
"...thanks. You seem...much happier."
For the first time in the past couple of days, Draco is at peace. There's no buzzing where there usually would be stress eating him alive. No one was right next to him glorifying murder or spitting insults right into his ear. Everything had just turned off for a little bit and it was nice.
"You could replace your brain with a carrot Dudley, and I can assure you, no one will even notice."
"If you must, get one of your relatives to drive you. I'm not staying in this dirty muggle house any longer than I need too."
"If I wanted you dead you'll be on the floor already."
"Ron got a lecture about improper uses of curses by Hermione if it makes you feel any better. And she threatened not to help him on his homework for a week."
There was also the issue of the curse. It had spread up to his sternum a couple days ago after Hermione had wrongfully thought she had finally found a counter-curse. Harry doesn't think he had ever thrown up so much afterward, not even when his uncle had forced him to eat year -expired soup.
Maybe... just
"That's because you silenced me!"
"Mr. Potter! What were you thinking! A dark curse and you never once sought to tell anyone? You're lucky if I ever let you leave this room again-"

How could his father's treatment have gotten out? Their fathers worked along with his but-
"Did you hear about Millicent and Goyle?" Pansy suddenly interjects. "They were caught snogging in one of the abandoned broom closets by Peeves after the feast. Quite the couple they make, actually. all brawn and little brain. I tried to get Millicent to spill but she only grunted in response. Her loss, really."
He flicked his wand causing the curtains to be pulled down. "Please. It's going to be the same thing as last year. 'Be nice to the eleven-year gremlins, don't go pushing them down stairs, show them to their common room, yadda yadda.'"
Hagrid pulled Harry aside after he finished reading off the list. Ron and Hermione gave him a sympathetic glance. "Sorry abou' this Harry. Have ter keep an eye on 'im, yeh know? Can' afford ter have the ministry on me back again. . . Dumbledore needs me. I can' be leaving jus yet."
Remus stared at him not quite getting what he was saying.
Harry let out a slow controlled breath at the slight tremors that started to take control of his hands.  "You're gay?" His voice is more shakey than he would have liked. His throat felt as if someone had a hand wrapped around his neck. The panic that surged through him at the thought was astronomical.
what you're doing. You had a part and you failed to uphold it. Responsibility and choice don't walk hand and hand and certainly not in the breeze you've been hiding your arrogance away in."
He stands up as fast as he can, chair falling behind him, and makes for the door. He slams it shut with as much force as he can manage before practically running down the steps. It was pathetic and he knew that, but didn't stop the urgency to get as far away from Potter as humanly possible.
"That's a complicated question. I think both of us knew when we were sixteen but never did anything serious. I think we were both too scared to act upon it. There were a couple of times I thought... Sirius hated himself for it for a long time. Even if he hated his family some ideas they had imprinted on him. It took a long time to work him out of it. After he went to Azkaban I thought I had moved on, but obviously, that was wrong because when he showed up again we..."
know how to shut your mouth."
"This is a muggle neighborhood, Malfoy. Someone will see us."
"Potter," Draco whispers softly, his words echoing throughout the quiet neighborhood.  "We need to hurry if you want to get done before they get back."
She gasped. “That poor thing! If I had known-” she pauses mid-word and her eyes widen. “Is he?"
"What the bloody hell am I supposed to do in here? It's practically a death sentence sitting in here alone. Die of boredom? "
Draco pushed the mug away and looked at the wall. How did so much change so fast?
Luna hums some off-tune song down at her homework. "I don't think so. He was rather upset. I think you should steer clear of him. Gulping Plimpies are contagious. They can make you say do things you don't mean."
He rubbed his arm self-consciously, suddenly feeling out of place. He had almost managed to not think about his godfather this entire summer but now seeing his old professor standing in front of him was making it all come back. He gulped nervously and clenched the edge of the loose muggle jumper he was wearing.
Harry opens the candy box with a raised eyebrow. The figure jumps out and almost lands on the blonde's face had he not leaped for it first. "You've been acting like a kicked puppy all week."
Harry nods. "The stars, uh, help."
Slowly he sat up and wandered over to the green and silver window seat. He needed to see it again. To make sure it was real and not some twisted nightmare.
"Who fixed my clothes?" He asks through the door.
It was Ron. His eyes captured Draco's own and he seemed just as panicked as he was. He hadn't accounted for Ron's low attention span and need to annoy Hermione. A part of him almost wanted to laugh in payback.
"You don't understand." Remus looked stricken.
just in case one of them gets the idea to hex him again.
"And risk not overhearing you and Weasley's precious conversation. Not a chance!"
“Well...you’re correct."
"I bet he's lying about having the mark!"
"Uhg," Draco rubs his forehead, "You're hero complex is acting up again. Mind if I vomit?"
(See the end of the chapter for
His knowing he deserved it was the only barrier between the two and it was thin. He didn't know if that scared or relieved him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Bitter tears fell onto his lips when he laughed to himself. 'Too late for that now.'
"How about we give them some payback?"
He didn't even know it was possible. Dread starts to fill him. The entire memory of that night was blurry to him and Draco had refused to elaborate on what happened. Did he somehow kill his aunt with his magic? The idea seemed ridiculous but the more he thought about it-
Ron looks embarrassed at her actions as the witch the ridicules him. "He was strutting around like he owned the place!"

Draco caught up to him on the stairs. He looked to be in a better mood than he did yesterday. Harry wanted to put it up to the 'Halloween cheer' but he doubted it. Whatever it was, he was grateful.
"I guess."
The watch on Draco's wrist starts to buzz, capturing both their attentions. The Halloween feast was about to begin. Draco was supposed to use the time to go send off the potions ingredients at the owlery when everyone was gone.
Harry looked down. He was still mad but he begrudgingly had to accept the fact Draco was actually right in this scenario.
"Are you okay?"
"Its okay, Harry. I don't care. Neither would Sirius. Or your parents. They

Harry huffs. "Fine. But you didn't have to embarrass me like that."
He didn't take a moment to gauge Harry's reaction. He turned and stormed down the corridor.
Draco takes out his wand and touches the very tip on Harry's abdomen. Weeks ago the action would have caused a duel ending with both of them ending up in the hospital wing. Now Harry found himself closing his eyes and waiting for the icy sensation to flow over him.
"Oh, I don't? Tell me then. I clearly don't know a

Harry's best friend barged in barely waiting for Harry to finish speaking. His face lit up at the large bag on the seat."Sweet! You got some Honeydukes!" He says, not wasting a moment to dig in and bring out a chocolate frog
Without warning, Draco's fist slams onto the table with a bang, startling the brunet.

you."
Harry looked down at the hand. It was a strangely affectionate gesture they left him feeling... uncomfortable. Sure, Ginny was pretty and all that but he could never see her that way. She was like a sister to him. Besides, the only people who had ever done that before was Cedric. He felt horrible comparing the two.
(See the end of the chapter for
The thought led him to subconsciously scratching at the mark. He looked around the library to see if anyone had noticed. There was only Pansy sitting across from him. If his anxiety for it wasn't bad before Severus' lecture, it was now. He'd taken to disillusioning it every couple hours for good measure.
"Cedric Diggory?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Get off the floor, boy. You're ruining the carpet."
"Brillant," says Harry. It lacked the normal buzz to it. Draco is too caught up in his euphoria to notice.
Harry looked over his shoulder to where a Ravenclaw he'd forgotten the name of was staring at them oddly. Harry didn't want to end the conversation so quick as it was the most they've gotten to talk in almost a week. Nonetheless, Harry went back to his scrubbing but not without giving Draco one last look-over.
in any of the books about it? I'm a pure-blood wizard for Mercy's sake. I should have learned
On September the first the platform was a seething mass of humanity. Every wizard in England seemed to be shoulder to shoulder, in each other's faces, no personal space, no exceptions. There were parents giving their children goodbye hugs, wiping tears from their faces, making sure they had everything they needed before leaving for the next four months. Other parents, mostly ones from long lineages of pureblood aristocratic families, thought they were above such shows of affection and instead settled for solemn faces and belittling attitudes towards the side.
Remus raised an eyebrow but didn't comment. "Not at the moment, no. Would cocoa suffice?"
Draco huffed as he placed the last stack of textbooks on his bedside table. It was nearly eight at night and they only had just finished their shopping. Most of their time was spent either commuting back and forth from the inn or in various clothing shops. To say the least, he has exhausted. But he knew the biggest part of the day was yet to come.
All of his musical instruments had been dragged up as well. There was a piano in the corner covered in sheet music followed by an elegant black and gold violin sitting propped up on its leg. The bow for it was in desperate need to be rehaired. He had refused to even touch it since his fourth year and was going through his identity crisis. He never even wanted to learn it; his father had forced him into lessons when he was six. He'd had a tantrum for hours because of it. The piano lessons were different because although it
Harry raised an eyebrow. "You're also rubbish at defense."
Finally, the door shut with a small thud, and Draco turned around to Harry with a smirk, sweets pilled in his arms.
Remember that you are important. You matter. You are loved and valued. Do not forget that. There are people who love and accept you for you.
"Oh," Ron says. "I guess that makes sense. And canis major-"
"Does it really matter?"
Remus nodded and busied himself in the small kitchen that connected to the sitting room. Harry watched awkwardly and sat down on one of the patched armchairs right to the fireplace. It was odd. He never had imagined in the days contemplating whether or not he should come what Remus' home looked like. He just assumed the man still lived in Grimmland place, though now that he thought about it, it was quite a stupid idea. The place had to hold more bad memories for him than it did Harry.
"I'm sorry mate. I had to tell them what happened. They made me." Ron blurts before Harry can be lectured again.
"You remind me of a goldfish Dudley. It can fight but it won't have enough IQ points to remember it ten seconds later," he smirks.
"...you?"
Harry rubs his face with his hands and sighs. "It's not as easy as that. I have to do it whether I want to or not."
He stood from his seat to grab the mug in annoyance when he suddenly felt light-headed.
He just wanted everything to stop. It seemed as if every thought inside his brain had turn against each other is war. Not a single one agreed with each other. To achieve one thing conflicted with the other. He wanted to be the perfect son, yet he also wanted to burn in whatever afterlife was waiting for him.
"How are you?"
"Well I've already called dibs, haven't I?" He swings an arm around Harry's shoulder and helps him the rest of the way. When they got to the top the glass walls circled around them in a stunning picture. There was a sunset in the sky, as bold as one of Molly Weasley's tangerine jellies. It sat within the sky, that autumn-fruit hued throne, as if it looked over the earth, stretching out with sepia tones to everyone below.
She pats Draco's knee. 'Love pats' she used to call them when he was little. “That’s fine my dear. Do you want to quickly Floo your mother to tell your mother where you are? I bet she's worried sick.”
Harry gave him the bucket filled with the chunks of meat and started to feed it. To his surprise, the creature took an odd liking to the blonde. It bowed it's head to Draco in an act of respect, much like a hippogriff, then pushed it's snout up against his pale hand. It even neighed in comfort. Harry watched the exchanged very carefully as he started to groom the miss-shapen horse.
There was a curse in Remus' direction. "Dark magic. I knew it. Do you think Dumbledore would know what it is?"
He was hesitant to tell Draco this information. Draco guessed he felt odd about sharing such personal information to a person he would be normally glaring daggers at. He couldn't blame him.
"Have another option? No? Then shut your bloody mouth and help get my trunk down."
"Who the hell-"
Lucius Malfoy was missing. And he didn't care. It felt enthralling.
(See the end of the chapter for
Pansy stomped on his foot under the table. "Why in Salazar's name would I be interested in some mudblood?"
Draco scoffs. "Of course it
Draco stared at her as if she'd grown a secound head. She out of all people must know taking your own life couldn't be beautiful? "That's... horrid. And disgusting. Taking your own life like that isn't beautiful... It's cowardly. How can you romanticize something like that?"
“Good gracious, I’m quite the klutz. Hold on.” She grabs her wand and mutters a quick reparo, repairing the cup but not the hot liquid of the floor. She grabs a towel off her cluttered table and wipes the floor clean. She whispers under her breath he couldn't hear.
Draco finally meets Harry's eyes with a glare that said
And yet, Harry-fucking-Potter seemed to be an exception of the rules once again. It had been nearly two weeks since he'd almost kissed the other at the top of the tower right before the Halloween feast. Now it seemed all he could think about. It was infuriating.
"Exactly. It's not exactly the same when your father is a highly-valued member of the ministry who can get almost anything he wants. He can just ask nicely and I'll be handed right over to him on a silver platter."
Harry shrugs. "I don't know? Same rule maybe. I'm only guessing..."

It was distant to him. He wanted so badly to be a part of it. How could you miss something you never truly had?
Suddenly the man was there, his grubby hands reaching out. They clasp over his mouth; an equally ghostly hypodermic of adrenaline pierces his heart, unloading in an instant. He feels his ribs heaving as if bound by ropes, straining to inflate his lungs. His head is a carousel of fears and

"Yes, your mother saved you once again."
"You don't even know what I was going to say."
"It's not like I had anything else better to do," he spits. "I'm still trying to figure out how I woke up here." He walks around to the other side of the bed while he continues to talk. "You obviously didn't do this as much as I want to believe that. That would be to Ravenclaw-"
Draco reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small potion vial. It was a dark red with chunks of who knows what inside. "I dug this out of Blasie's trunk when he wasn't looking. Drink it before he notices it's gone."
Draco rolls his eyes before entering fully and shutting the door behind him. His glamour from the platform had run off now and his hair was once back to being slicked down. Harry guessed he probably stole some hair gel from one of the other Slytherin's. Harry had surprisingly almost gotten used to it being loose and oddly found himself missing it.
to make sure he was punished because of it. That's where he and his father separated. He would do anything to avoid getting what he deserved like the coward he was, or because he simply thought he did not deserve it (which made his stomach turn). It was kind of a fucked up way to look at it, but the logicality of it was clearer than anything else lately.
Draco cleared his throat to focus. "Yes, well, I'll have to go ask Bramble for some bandages and whatnot. Try not to put too much pressure on anything while I'm gone. We don't need the Boy-Who-Lived dying on us..."
She nods.
"Harry-"
When he was sure no one was listening in, Harry spoke up. "Are you okay?"
"Harry!" A voice breaks through the chaos. Harry whips around just in time to see a mass of bushy brown hair tunneling towards him.
The moment Harry realized he'd misinterpreted his actions, his words, his expressions for so many years... as if he'd been speaking a language he couldn't understand, it felt like the picture in the puzzle he'd been solving for years suddenly switched.
"You'll get it back once you give me a chance to speak. Crowley, you Gryffindors really
"Well yea. "I'm not a saint as you'd like to believe," Harry smirks. "I've thought about it more than once. Acted on it actually. Almost killed your aunt. In the end I always figured there's not much point in it, is there? There's already been enough bloodshed. If me holding back if what is going to help Voldemort die then so be it. Better me than anyone else."
Ron sputters next to him before Harry can think to. His mind is still frozen from the topic of Draco. "B-but that can take forever! What about lessons?! And quidditch?!"
Draco throws the book he was reading back into his school bag, only faintly cringing at the sound of parchment crumbling underneath it. It was a long shot but perhaps Harry was feeling the same way. He could only hope that he would show up at the broom cupboard they had reserved.
Harry sets the plate down next to him and stares at him expectantly. Draco takes one glance before turning back to his book. He could hardly pay attention to what it was saying.
Harry couldn't respond. It was when the first wave of nausea hit when he knew he had
He was on his way to Charms when a loud laugh caught his ear. He knew without that it was Harry's from their late-nights spent together. Up ahead the three Gryffindors turned into the otherwise abandoned hallway. It was just the four of them. It spelled out for trouble.
Merry Crisis :) I tried to make this chapter a little longer. Sorry if it sucks ://
"A couple survivors and bystanders said they saw Lucius Malfoy's son there as well. Draco Malfoy. The order suspects that he's following in his father's footsteps to become a death eater, that is if he isn't one already. Do you remember seeing him there? Is he the one that cursed you?"
Draco caught up to him easily seeing as he was taller. He had been expecting the boy to stop when he got under his bedroom window, but no. He had continued to the gate leading to the yard behind the house.
Draco sighed exasperatedly . "How did you ever manage to survive up until this point, Potter?"
He's pulled into a bone crushing hug once again. The back of his eyes burned slightly in response and he squeezed them shut. It was kind of awkward considering the height difference and Harry's sore stomach but he didn't dare speak that.
Silence. Remus shakes his head just barely with a disconsolate smile.
Draco is silent. He didn't even know how to respond. Did he make his emotions that obvious?
The world turned into a blur, and so did all the sounds. The taste. The smell. The small, false sense of ground underneath him slipped. He paused trying to hold back the strange feelings rumbling inside him but he couldn't. A tear started to trace down his cheek despite his best efforts, and just like that, the floodgates opened. So many tears burst forth like water from a dam, spilling down his face. Draco's chin trembled as if he was a small child.

In the end, Harry shook his head. "Nope, not much. You?"
Harry rolled his eyes. "Nevermind."
“Well, where was I? Oh yes. My favorite holiday. As you know, when I was younger we didn’t have much money so both my parents were always out working. So every year on August twenty-first, I would look outside my window and look outside my window and hope to see a shooting star.”
He squeezes some of the salve on his hand. "This is going to hurt."
"Maybe you should give Voldemort some hints then. He could use the help."
I posted this chapter yesterday but I realized it only posted half of it! My apologies.
"I...did he know? Sirius?"

Maybe if you somebody else, but Harry
So originally I had much more planned for this chapter my bad. I decided to just split it in half! That means hopefully the next chapter will come out pretty soon. Also, thoughts on Pansy so far?
"Why do you care so much?" His bright, emerald eyes were filled with so much emotion it was impossible to tell exactly what he was feeling. Draco stopped what he was doing to look down at the boy.
The last photo was one of just Sirius and Remus. Remus was nursing a bottle of firewhisky up to his mouth with Sirius's chin on top of his head, an awkward position as Remus was taller, making wild faces at the camera. Sirius poked and prodded at him until he looked up, causing Remus to playfully push him onto the floor and the brunet to bust out in laughter. At the bottom of the picture, there were words scribbled.
"I'm not meeting anyone," says Harry. "I'm going on walks. They help. With the nightmares."
"Then we can take one of those muggle things. What are they called?"
“But not just any shooting star...Cassowary’s comet. The brightest one in the sky.”
Then he remembered.
you. If Hogwarts was safe he could have never let you out of the grounds."
"What good does that do," He sighs. "If you must, get one of your relatives to drive you. I'm not staying in this dirty muggle house any longer than I need too."
kept it all bottled up inside despite the relief it had given him. He hadn't even broken down because of the gay part, though it wasn't like he has going to tell him what really happened either. He'll probably be thrown at the nearest shrink possible.
Harry scratches the back of his neck and continues on. "I- I didn't understand and...I apologize. You're right, I don't know you. This entire thing could be an illusion I've made up inside my head just because of the truce. You could be faking and I could be walking right into a trap really. The thing is...I don't believe that could be possible.
"We only have three more days."
The clattering of a saucer being sat down in front of him startled him out of his thoughts. Remus was sitting on the chair across from him and was saying something.
"Do you want some tea?"
Harry sighed begrudgingly and made his way toward the kitchen. Dudley sneered in delight behind him then jabbed a finger into the brunet's already bruised ribs.
Harry slammed the door in alarm and ran as best as he could toward the window. Dudley was making his way toward the door with Petunia behind him. Panic arose in his empty stomach. It was only eight in the morning and they weren't due back until tonight. He cursed under his breath. Of course, this would be his luck. What would the Boy-Who-Lived be without a life full of trouble?
"What?"
"When you get your mind out of the gutter then."
"You still shouldn't go after Bellatrix. It's not healthy. You said I didn't understand, well I do. I wish I didn't, but I do."
"You won't believe it if I tell you."
What were the words again? Imposter syndrome? Draco felt his entire life revolved around it.
Given up his plans for the night, he decided to go back to bed when something caught his eye. A streak of silver flew past his window and into the midnight abyss. A catching star, Harry thought.
"In the muggle world, you have to seventeen or older to drive."
He felt sick to his stomach for the second time today. If she ever found out, she would never welcome him inside her home ever again. She would hate him beyond wits. He would truly be alone then. The thought made the back of his eyes burn.
I think I'm going to continue most of this story from Draco's third-person limited P.O.V guys. I find it much more intriguing to write in. Also, pleaseee spam me with comments. They make my day :)
Draco felt déjà vu wash over him. "Yes. Me. You're still weak. If something goes wrong, I need you in your best condition when we run away."
"I can't help it. I haven't had sweets in months. I'm suffering from withdrawal."
Draco thought,
Ron snorted. "He probably realized he can't bully first-years after he graduates."
Draco hummed. "Fine then. But you have to believe me. I've done nearly every detection spell possible on this."
“Did you ever see one?”
“Do you want to tell me what got you so upset? Is it that boy?”

"Let me down you dimwitted twit!"
Out of nowhere, Snape slammed a bottle onto the desk. He hadn't even seen where it had come from. "Believe it or not, your safety is in my hands. I'm not going to let you wander around giving anyone a second glance at your behavior a free ticket to get you into Azkaban. Especially not with the little stunt you played. Everyone will already think of you capable of Bell's incident the other day. I say you should suffer with that as a penalty for your actions seeing as words don't seem to make it into that dense skull of yours, but the Dark Lord still has use of you." Snape ridicules. "What are waiting for? Give me your arm!"
"I had detention."
Malfoy looked up and met the emerald green eyes blazing down on him. It sent daggers to his stomach.
"Are you sure?"
Harry throws Hermione's hairbrush at him.
"Get off him you toesuckers!" A voice suddenly yells out.
Harry scoffs. "Well, you shouldn't be

He nods timidly before continuing. He didn't know how much he should leave out. Where did he draw the line?
Harry didn't take time to notice how he had used their proper names before firing back. "I don't know, okay? Rejoice? Cry? Why do you care, anyway? This is what you wanted all along, isn't it? See spoiled little Potter get exactly what he deserves..."
He closed the book that was left in the closet and falls down back into the bed. Draco found muggle culture quite interesting unknown to popular belief. Their imaginations and creativity were intriguing when it came to things like television or phones. They were useful and he didn't see why wizards refused to use them. Not that he would ever mention that to his father.
"Explain," demanded Pansy rather harshly.
"Don't speak. You'll make yourself worse." Remus ignored him. He grabbed Harry by the arm and helped him up the stairs. Harry tried to wiggle out of it at the uncomfortable closeness. The shame of it all added to the pounding in his skull.
[I Found]
Heyo- I know this is quick but I'm trying to apologize for my two weeks of not updating this month. I also wanted to have a certain number of chapters posted a month so I crammed a sneaky one in today, o0ps. AND I wanna hurry up and get to the kiss scene ;)
Remus rubbed his back and said some things that Harry guessed were supposed to be comforting if they didn't go in one ear and out the other. He knew the cycle by now. The headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, then exhaustion. He cursed his stupidity for not realizing sooner and leaving Hogwarts without thinking about the consequences.
Crabbe goes for his shirt sleeve and Draco panics. He begins thrashes around wildly, like a toddler having a tantrum. Sporadic attacks; his last option. They
She is here. The chapter you've all been waiting for. It has only been 120k words and forty-three chapters! But it's here! I apologies :) Just kidding, no I don't, but you can imagine I do. I should say I wasn't going to have them kiss this chapter, but the next on Christmas Eve night by the lake. But I have no impulse control whatsoever and figured this was probably cuter SO-
Harry had gotten a note, an origami crane like before, last night while he was getting ready for bed. Draco wanted to talk to him in the tower before the feast seeing as it was the one night in the next couple of weeks he wouldn't be gone for detention.
Malfoy huffed. "For your information, I was thinking about how to fix our situation. Now, if you would stop being such a
"-has been after my head since I was a baby and I'm fine right?"
"I was being stupid," Harry confessed which wasn't a total lie. He's the one who idiotically decided to talk back to his uncle that evening causing the entire sequence of events after that. "I wasn't thinking straight. With...with everything and I...." Harry took a deep breath. His fingers dug into his pocket where the sharp piece of glass was and wrapped his fingers around it to steady himself from breaking down in the middle of public. He was supposed to be a Gryffindor right? So why was this so hard? "I just missed him. I couldn't stand being there anymore. I was so irritated. Mad
"I didn't know."
Blaise arched an eyebrow. "I'm not going to let you borrow my homework if that's what you're thinking."
My heart shrank a little more at her words. He could hardly believe this was the woman who was protecting him. Seeming to do more harm than good, wasn't it? At least she never purposely hit him like the others. That had to count for something.
And he looked away.
Draco covered his mouth with his hand to hold back a sob. Right on his forearm was the one thing in his arm he despised the most. The black ink danced on his ghost-like skin. It was a sore thumb to the rest of him and would be for the rest of his life.
Harry deserved, and needed, to be helped and the responsibility just so happened to land on him. It wasn't Harry's fault he got hit, nor was it that the spells took so much energy and magic out of the caster. He had unknowingly helped him out of his cult of a home only to repay him by abandoning when he needed it most.
. Harry had no idea. And if he did, he probably wouldn't be sitting where he was right now.
"Are you alright?"
"Have you forgotten already that if you go back as well the ministry will snap your wand? You'll be back with your relatives in a click of your finger."
"How long?" Harry asked, a little unsure.
OK SO. I T H O U G H T I POSTED THIS CHAPTER BUT IT DIDN'T APPARENTLY AND I ENDED UP POSTING THE NEXT CHAPTER BEFORE THIS ONE AND I'm so sorry I have brain damage. I'm so sorry for everyone who was confused. yikes. Thanks to xmaude_maryx and YourBubblegumPrince for helping me realize my Big Dumb move.
. He doesn't think there was ever a time in his life since Voldemort walked in that the answer to that was a definite yes. But that wasn't really what he was asking though, was it? It was just another form of greeting used when they wanted it to sound like they cared, maybe sometimes people did, but never actually wanted to stay long enough for an answer other than 'good'. Besides, he had just killed his best friend. He shouldn't be causing him more grief than he already had.
. You can't just leave everyone in the dark like that. I was worried sick."
Harry immediately takes notice of the dozens of books covering every piece of furniture. They were scattered all over the place like a tornado had ripped a library and tossed the remnants here.
Yatin tilted his head. "I just figured you would want to hear the good news."
Sirius and not just the way Harry had. They were partners. They were...

"Jumpy, are we? I told you not to eat all that sugar. If I ate like you my mother would have a fit!"
Harry nervously let out a low laugh. "No way. You should know that. She's like a sister. She's your sister. That's... No. No way. Besides, if Ginny heard you just now she would probably be sneezing bats for a week."
A hand, a
Draco recoiled slightly at his words. Did Potter really mean that? Did he really think he deserved that? He couldn't help but feel as he was shot with the killing curse. It was partially his fault that the raven-haired boy in front of him felt that way. Once again, Draco hated who he had become. Or, who his

of all people. And people are going to
"Yes, ma'am."
"Work?"
"That's only a month and a half!""
"It wasn't," he mumbled tiredly. "It didn't"
Smart.
Harry spits out his tea. "What?"
Draco's gut plummeted as soon as he got back to his room. He knew it was to happen eventually, but not so soon. Couldn't they have at least waited until he was out of school? Or when he was an adult even? He gripped his blonde hair and let out a choked sob. He wouldn't-, No he couldn't do this. It was crazy. He was only sixteen for Merlin's sake.
Harry sat and ranted to his feathery friend for a minute before Malfoy came walking back in the room looking much more solemn than before. Harry bit his tongue to prevent himself from saying anything.
Harry raises an eyebrow. "That's a first."
“Harry Potter?”
"Have a good term, Harry. Set up a few pranks for me, will you?"
“....That's a

His face grows red. "Do not!"
He took a deep breath.
Draco lets out a frustrated groan and rubs his eyes until stars swarm his vision. He couldn't take it anymore. Everything inside his head was too much and too little.
Draco stares at him as though he just stabbed him through the chest. He looks back down at his book as if he is contemplating something. "I don't understand how you can be so selfless after everything. You've never had a break. Don't you ever want to hold on to something? Give people who've wronged you a taste of their own medicine?"
"I left. I went to Diagon Alley. He must have had spies or something cause a couple death eaters attacked-" he felt his grip tighten on his shoulder, "- but it was only a couple scratches. See? I'm perfectly fine."
"You slapped me in the face!"
"Bloody hell 'Mione, let him breathe!"
"I have...chores."
Draco seemed to be causing more harm than good.
Harry shrugs and pushes himself back up into a sitting position. "I don't know- it's just a nagging feeling I have I guess. You're not like your father is what I'm trying to get out."
She ran up to him at lightning speed and pulled Harry closer to her, wrapping her arms around him. Her embrace was warm and her welcoming arms were very protective when wrapped around Harry's frail body.
Draco looked up from his book and threw back the rest of his hot chocolate. (He was addicted. Harry tried to voice these thoughts but only was glared at and told to pour another glass). He looked just as exhausted as Harry felt.
He was pulled out of his thoughts by a small tapping on the window. Harry's mood did a 180 when he saw Hedwig dancing in front of the glass to be let in. The owl hooted gratefully when he opened the panel. Harry went to pet her but she nipped roughly at his finger.
"You're going to be late. Go to Dumbledore's Office after the feast. I'll be waiting there for you, okay?"
"What?" Draco asked, voice barely above a whisper.
"Sorry to burst your bubble Potter, but this is me. A cold, manipulative git. Nothing more and nothing less." The words come out harsher than he thought. Cold and impersonal.
Draco rolled his eyes and looked at the wall but opted to stay silent. Two weeks' detention was already bad enough. He doubted he would be able to see Harry at all with everything he would drown in.
Hermione was right. Maybe he was a little reckless at times.
"I have more photos in the album on the shelf if you'd like, Harry. They're on top. They were Sirius' before. I found them in his vault."
"I'm serious though! You would be safe at Hogwarts. You don't have to go to the headmaster I suppose, but you have to think about it. Do you want to be on the run the rest of your life with no more than a 5th year education against Voldemort's merciless army or do you want to help get rid of him once and for all?"
young man are not to leave this wing until we find exactly what is happening to you."
"Draco, I get it. You dislike Dumbledore. He's shady, I know. But either way he's going to be the one to help me end this war. I don't really have much of a choice but to trust him."
"Nothing."
"Please don't tell Dumbledore." Is all that he can say. Remus tilts his head in confusion.
“No thank you,” He answers a little too quickly. “I owled her earlier.”
Draco let out out a sigh of relief when he left the smooth surface of a light switch on the wall. He quickly flipped it on and turned around to make sure no one was watching him. Of course, just as he thought, nothing. It didn't help the sinking feeling in his stomach though.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Tea or coffee?"
"Enough of this Remus. Harry can answer questions for the Order later. Right now he needs rest and some food in him." Pomfrey breaks them up. Remus backs away looking slightly guilty. "And
Harry dismissed the thoughts away. There was no point in thinking about it now. He had to focus on getting his wand back. He felt vulnerable without it. And now that he was out of the Dursely's house, the chance of being attacked had doubled.
he would have said.  Harry could have laughed. It dreadful catch-22. He couldn't breathe because he was panicking about not being able to breathe. Choking was his uncle's favorite and Harry's fear by default.
Draco truthfully didn't know what to make of the new information. One upon a time, the beginning of the school even (it was only about two months but it seemed like a lifetime ago with all the changes), he might have felt upset or guilty. He used to break into cycles of where he hated himself from not loving his father. He would rationalize the man would be trying his best for him and he simply was not grateful enough. Draco hadn't realized it until that very second that he hadn't felt that way in a long time. Looking back at it, he even cringed. It made him realize he changed quite a bit within the past couple of months without realizing it. Harry had been there. His heart throbbed in emotion for the boy.
Harry clings to him.
Pansy looks between him and Yatin. She wouldn't normally be caught dead being caught in indecision but the boy's words seemed to be enough to send her stumbling.
He gave Harry a quick one-over to make sure he was okay before giving his best friend a brief hug -- not nearly as strong or extravagant as Hermione's -- with a pat on the back. Out of the corner of his vision he saw Malfoy awkwardly stare at them before sinking away into the crowd.
HARRY
Harry wanted to feel mad at the boy but he couldn't stop himself from smiling at how much the blond prat looked like a pouting six-year-old who just got told off for being up past their bedtime.
"Whadda you looking at?"
Draco wanted to yell; throw a fit. How did everything he did make him so selfish? His father just wanted him close and to follow in his footsteps. It was his fault he couldn't be a good son. And how did he repay him? Nearly killing him. Spitting at his feet and rejecting him. His mother and Bramble too. Now it was Harry, who just wanted to make sure he didn't starve to death despite hating him, only to remind him of his horrid uncle.
"You're point?"
"I take it back. I call dibs on killing you first." Harry grins at him and Draco rolls his eyes.
?! I've been worried sick! You could have been hurt!
"Fine, professor."
“Long day?”
"I was waiting to see how long it took for the ketchup in your eyebrow to fall into your eye."
"I"m fi-" he gagged again, putting a hand to his mouth. "-fine."
"Why not? They looked dreadful in their state. They still do. Who wears brown with maroon?"
There was a shuffling followed by a scraping of chairs. "I... since term started. But he didn't tell us till last week! He made us promise not to tell anybody!"
"I was going to say that you don't have to worry your pretty little hide anymore over the Dark Lord. He's finally realized you're not worth it. Never were. He's finally realized he had more... valuable people on his side." Yatin's fingers danced over his sleeved left-forearm when he talked.
Ron's face turned beet red as he pulled his pajamas closer to his chest. "Right. I thought so. Blokes and all..."
"Harry!"
- It'll be a disaster. Harry was failing most of their expectations of him, especially with last year's catastrophe, but to see their disappointed faces in him would make it so much clearer. Harry supposed the only reason why Draco knowing was different was because he never really had high expectations of him in the first place and vise versa. But that was changing rapidly as time grew on and he was gaining more and more respect for the other, so could he even say that was what it was truly?
"Shut UP!"
"What are you doing? I thought we had a plan!"
He ignores the insult. "I have to go do some chores and that's... going to take some time. Under no circumstances, at
He grabbed the nearest pillow to take his frustration out on. He hated being like this. It wasn't like him to get violent. It scared him at times.
She looks taken aback for a moment. “I don’t know. Maybe its the idea of loving someone so passionately you feel nothing without them. It dangerous falling that deep when there's no one on the other side to catch you.”
Harry's ears picked up at the mention of Draco's father. He had mentioned once his concerns about his parents' silence. Even if his father was a dick, he didn't enjoy the thought of breaking the news.
"Worried, that's all."
. There is a price on your head and you will be conscious of it."
"...chores?"
Draco decided he needed to get out of there as soon as possible. Harry had told him where his trunk was, so if he could hurry up and grab it, there wouldn't be any need to stay longer than needed.
." She smirks. "I've been itching to do this since first year. Unfortunately, I think Draco here reserves that right."
"Well...my ankle mostly. And my back. There's also my chest. It hurts to breathe."
There's a silence Harry can't decipher. Harry stares transfixed at his hands as if they're the most interesting thing he'd ever seen. Suddenly there was an arm around his shoulders that pulled him close, gently rubbing his arm.
She huffed but looked down at him with a raise of her eyebrow that dared him to protest. Harry stared between the two adults anxiously. They wouldn't possibly understand why he didn't want to tell anybody. No one ever did and it was kind of annoying. There was no point in telling someone if they were just going to deny all his reasons before he could even get them all out.
The brunet curled himself up in a ball under the thick green comforter with a contented sigh. The morning light from the open window shone through the curtains followed by the sounds of birds singing and kids laughing.
Draco didn't have the heart to tell her he probably wouldn't be coming back if all went to plan. He was going straight to the Manor after he was done. He was a deadman as it was already. He didn't want to drag on his punishment more than he had too.
He frowns in confusion when he sees Harry. "What happened to your face, Potter? My mistake, it must be permanent."
"I don't care what he made you promise, this is a matter of life-or-death. You should have alerted me as soon as you found out. Now, did he tell you how he got it?"
"Alohomora," he whispers at the golden nob beneath his hand. The gears inside turn and come lose with a small click.  He tries the nob again and smiles slightly when it opens.
Draco looked up from his book. Harry was standing in the library doorway with a plate of food looking slightly out of place. Draco cursed under his breath. Did none of the locks work in this place? Harry's presence was the last thing he needed right now.
"Yes, I know. What I did was bloody stupid. I know. I'm sorry,
He was just so angry. Why didn't his mother help him? Perhaps she wanted this as well. The thought tore him to pieces. He couldn't confide in anyone for this. He was utterly alone. But maybe that was for the best.
"Fine, I'll think about it."
"You were though. And avoiding me. I'm surprised you even wanted me here."
Harry blinked. His mind had gone blank in shocked confusion. It felt as if there was a loading symbol in his head from one of his cousin's old video games. Then all of a sudden he started laughing. He blamed the sleep deprivation. "Ginny? You think I'm..."
"So be it, Potter. Just let me go home."
, I was wrong. I wasn't thinking straight."
"So you're expecting me to bend to your every whim and spell you with exhausting magic every couple hours? As much as I'm flattered in your idolization in me, not even a professional healer could do such. All I'm doing is stopping the spread before it gets worse."
There was a collective groan. Everyone knew partnering the two rivals would only result in a fight. No one would be getting work done if they so much as even looked at each other funny.
Across the library was Yatin Bhagat, his signature crude smirk playing on his lips as he played with Draco for his amusement. He could read him like the cover of a book. The smile - callous - he was eager to prove his superiority to them. Draco hated feeling played with, especially by people as boot-licking as the fifth year was.
"I'm fine, Potter." He spits. "I'm not some foolish Gryffindor that needs to run crying over every mishap."
Finally, Harry pushes himself away and lets his head fall pathetically into his hands.
Harry bit down on his lip and tried to focus attention back to rubbing down the animal. Harry knew Draco had his own life apart from Harry, but somehow the words didn't sit right with him. It was obvious he was lying. Draco was too punctual, to poise, to allow himself to fall behind on a task.
"Oh! Yes. Right. My bad." Draco scratches the back of his neck. He didn't know why honestly. Perhaps it was just the awkwardness of the situation.
"Have a stronger grip then."
"I guess. She's fancied you forever and I went off on a whim... It was pretty stupid, wasn't it? And Cedric."
Getting on his knees, he examines the cupboard Harry had described. It was usually small with golden vent gates. He could barely make out a child's handwriting that had been painted over.   He quickly tried the handle to find it locked. He cursed. Of course the blasted muggles had to go and make things difficult for him.  It was one of those rare moments he appreciated his father's countless lessons on wandless magic as a child.
"Where is it written? Where is it written you
Snape slams down his wand on his desk. Draco doesn't even blink at the man's calm but collected anger. Instead, he takes the option of looking up at bookshelves surrounding them in the candlelit office.
"When?"
Harry sat alone on the thin window seal in his room and looked up at the faint stars. He knew if he was caught being up so late again Vernon would have a fit worse than last time. He couldn't help it though. Tonight was the full moon and he had been waiting all month for it. Since being locked up so often this summer, he had recently found a new habit of looking up at the stars.
Draco glared at him. "If you would stop being such a
“You still sound like the ten years from six years ago,” She chuckles again. “What did he say?”
Snape shook his head. "Are you able to even look past that self-centered hole you call logic? The world doesn't revolve around you. You weren't forced into anything. It was all you."
Standing back up, he wipes himself off and looks back out the window to see Harry waiting for him expectantly. The boy gives him a little thumbs up and he can't help but chuckle a little bit.
"That's what I thought. And besides, they would have no idea where to cross at. You would need me. It's just easier if we ask the neighbor tomorrow. If you can survive until then," he sneers.
The chill is like a drip of freezing water running off his stomach, jangling his nerves, setting his teeth on edge and marching it's way from his stomach to his arms and legs.
Harry whipped around to see the professor walking down the empty corridor scoring bright green robes. The feast had just ended he supposed. He had left early due to his stomach still in the process of stretching itself back to size after the summer. He had eaten more than he should have under Hermione's watchful eye and ended up being sick.
"Dumbledore told you that, did he? Well, it's rubbish." Harry can hear the traces of Draco in his voice. They had spent a lot of time talking about the headmaster and only now it became clear hearing the words come out of Remus's mouth how much the Slytherin might actually be right about things. "Dumbledore doesn't know the value of people so don't let him tell him where your emotions should go. War is important but there is no point in destroying yourself when it can be avoided. You can't chase after Bellatrix just like you told me I couldn't."
Harry is about to leave when he shouts. "Wait."
He was sitting on top of his tower, an unusual addition to the architecture of Hogwarts. He had discovered it by accident in his second year when trying a way to escape his goons to take a breather. Draco genuinely had no idea how the spot wasn't already taken by dozens of students. It was well hidden (you had to pull a brick in the wall on the third floor behind the tapestry of Sir Elwin) but not enough that it would escape the notice of centuries of Hogwarts students. The magic had to be insanely complex because the tower easily had to be one of the tallest in all of the grounds but was invisible if trying to find it from the outside. It was small though; roughly only four meters in diameter all around and took countless flights of stairs to get all the way to the top. It was peaked with large white granite pillars, each inscribed with elegant runes, that held up a domed glass roof. Draco had since then made the very peak of it practically his second room at Hogwarts. There were boobytraps, hexes, and wards he set every year so if anyone else suddenly got the wrong idea they would whimper away with their tails between their legs.
Draco spotted an open pathway towards the door and hurriedly grabbed Harry's hand to pull him through. The brunet gave a surprised yelp at first but calmed when he saw who it was.
Harry set down the stool and was now holding the rope, staring above where a hook you would usually see holding a flag empty. Draco admitted the boy had this much more planned out than he thought. Or maybe he had done this before, he thought sadly.
"Hm, let me think.
"Did you see who it was? The portkey you sent with the death eaters had us worried. The order has Lucius Malfoy and Antonin Dolohov captured. If it was one of them we might be able to question them before sending them off to the ministry."
Harry jumped up and scanned the compartment hopelessly for any type of escape route to shove Draco through. When his eyes landed on his trunk above them and he could practically feel the lightbulb form above his head.
"I was busy."
Draco flinches slightly and pulls the blanket tighter around his shoulders. He could practically feel the dark ink on his forearm moving with a mind of its own. Merlin, he was disgusting.
He rolls his eyes. "
Harry looked down at his feet and hands, not leaving but contemplating something. Draco's fingers twitched in annoyance and humiliation.
Sighing, Harry bends over to dig in the bag filled with acid-pops and Draco smacks his hand away. "Back off before I take your voice away for good. Those have to last me until the first Hogsmede trip."
Yatin shrugged. "Suit it yourself then. Didn't enjoy being treated like a ragdoll, I see? I wouldn't know how that would feel."
The door to the empty compartment flew open giving Harry a third rate heart attack.
Here is this chapter... again. sorry folks. I'm gonna be honest, I'm kinda dumb.
Harry gasps in pain when the other's fist slams across his jaw. He does it again but to his stomach. He guessed it was warranted since he provoked him. That didn't stop it from hurting though.
"Fine," Harry groans. He honestly was getting anxious about that. Last year they were only there for about thirty minutes. Surely they'll be back any minute now?
1) ok I should let you know this quote isn't mine lol. some of you may have recognized it. It's from Looking for Alaska by John Green but I just changed it up a little bit. I had an impulse to put it in and I couldn't control it. It's one of my favorite quotes of all time and it shows falling in love in such an untouchable way that beautiful.
Harry was glad that even though the building looked to be falling apart, there was still hot water beading down on him from the showerhead. The warmth was comforting after the frigid temperature outside.
The two wandered back to the front of the house where Harry's window was. The bushes they had jumped into the previous night to cushion their fall were still flattened from their landings. Draco had to stifle a laugh looking at their failed attempt to cover it up.
Harry knew he was being slightly dramatic, but again, he couldn’t control it as well he used too. He was quick to temper and hard to calm down ever since fourth year. He hated it, snapping people he cared about over the smallest things.
Harry was halfway with cooking when a loud thump came from above him causing him to accidentally drop some pancake batter onto the floor. He frowned and put down the spatula. Dudley was in the sitting room at the moment so he didn't hear or cause the noise. That only meant him one thing.
Harry decided to ignore the fact that he used a muggle candybar as a password and followed him up the steps. The last time he'd been in the room he'd been told of his destiny that was sealed with the lightning scar on his forehead. The feeling still brought unease to his already aching stomach.
"I don't want to be a
"You're getting off track," Harry points out. "You're right. Dumbledore may be using me but what other option do I have? He's playing his cards right. He wouldn't let them snap my wand. If you asked he could probably help you too."
"Why?"
"The Sirius star. I know."
"Show me where you're hurt and maybe I can fix it." Was the best he was able to do at the moment.
"Please. You may have a sharp mind but you lack the skill. You could have never pulled off such a clever trick."
He wonders over to the door behind me and I throw my arm out before he can open it.
For everyone dealing with oppressive family members this season, that's anything from having to hide your gender identity to dealing with toxicity in general, I want you to know you 100% aren't alone! There are thousands going through the same thing you are right now and It's okay to be upset over that! You do not deserve that ever and I am here for you. I'll adopt you for the holidays if have to.
"Lemon Drop?"
"Let's go Malfoy."
"Yes.
Blaise snorts next to him. "Your only future prospects are a couple self-pleasuring spells that will remain unnamed for the sake of Draco's innocent ears."
He stumbled out of the room using the wall as support, each step his stomach tightening and aching all the more. He kept swallowing, and his throat kept clenching, but no matter what he could not stop the warm feeling rising through his chest. Then Harry could taste it at the back of his mouth.
He truly did. He could barely keep his eyes open let along keep his thoughts in line. Why was he keeping him awake anyways? Quite rude of him.
Harry nodded awkwardly with a smile but slunk away from the touch as discreetly as possible. Ginny seemed to understand nonetheless and took a step back without hesitation. She instead starting going off about the quidditch game tomorrow to distract both of them from the discomfort.
Harry thinks back to all the times Remus had stopped everything at the hint of Sirius' name in his third year. The way Sirius sat so close to him during Order meetings and the looks they shared when they thought no one was looking. Merlin, how could he have been so
He was suddenly reminded of his painful reality. She knew nothing of the darkmark on his skin or that father was secretly hoarding Voldemort and the rest of his evil cronies in his house. As far as she knew, he was just as innocent as her in this war.
"Nice shot, Weasley. Didn't know you had it in you. How about a one-on-one? I can keep my back turned if it's easier for you," said Draco. His eyes met Harry's for a brief second before he tore them away harshly. The words weren't nearly as sharp as some other words that had boiled up inside him he could have chosen. He would have shoved the whirlpool of emotions someplace where he could have disposed of the property later on, but he supposed if he didn't say something it would be more suspicious than not. Instead would harness them. It wasn't

There were only three more days until the start of term and not nearly enough time to figure out whatever the bloody hell was happening.
I want to thank everyone for all the sweet comments you've been sending me (‘-’*) They're literally so kind you don't understand how happy them make me!
He picked up Potter's finished dinner plate from the table as he made his way to the door. Draco couldn't help but look back at Harry. The boy was perfection in coffee hues; his hair was the color of dark roasted beans but his skin was all latte. He had that shy look about him teens often get when they've grown too much too fast, like they aren't really sure about being a man just yet. He was skinny, but the way his clothes hung gave away the muscle beneath, likely from his years of playing Quidditch.
Harry smirks at him. "You're welcome to finish my transfiguration homework in the dresser."
"Yeah. Yeah, okay."
Harry shrugs awkwardly and looks up at him with a sheepish smile. Draco wondered how he was talking so casually. "Not the first time I've been told that. I'm serious though. You're wrong. I don't know you. I thought I did, but I don't think that was ever you."
Dumbledore and the Order-"
His face went red. Draco couldn't help compare him to the fresh newts they used in Potions.
With the skills of a professional quidditch player, he threw the looped side of the rope around it in his first try. Draco had seen him play countless times but they didn't stop him getting impressed. Throwing wasn't even a seeker skill.
“Are you even listening to me?”
"Fat chance," Draco snorts. "You're playing with fire, you know. How do you know it won't kill you before then?"
"Pigs dance with whoever is muddiest," Blasie responds without even blinking an eye.
Harry wanted to tell him it wasn't his fault. Dumbledore always got his way no matter what and it was futile  to go against him. He didn't want him to carry any guilt; he just didn't deserve it.
"Oh, dear. You sure have a sweet tooth, don't you?"
He pushed the palms of his shaky hands into his eyes and looked up at the fading sky. Either one of them might be next to be pushed into the dark lords crutches and it would be his fault.
Against his will, he turned and leaned his head on Remus to catch his breath as he was the closest source of heat. It was returned with a tight hug and a tissue which he accepted graciously. Harry knew he would faint when his stomach gave out. It felt like his innards were being replaced by some kind of black hole. And yet, it was still oddly unnerving when the nausea crept from his abdomen to his head causing the world to go black.
"Have you ever gone to a dentist?"
Ron nodded understandingly, looking down at his hands. "Then... who are you going to? If you are, I mean."
"It was just a fly. I don't the issue."
"I've never tasted a difference myself actually."
Also, this is the longest thing I've ever written? Its a HEFTY chapter.
“Bramble...”
he glares at the blonde, "should you leave."
Hedwig hooted again and flew toward a plate of food he had just realized was there. His stomach rumbled at the thought of a hot meal. Harry stood up, wincing as his foot made contact with the ground, and walked over to it. The plate was filled with sausage, bacon, fried eggs, toast, and even some treacle tart. His mouth watered at the sight of it.
Draco looked around the room to evade meeting her eyes. “His parents are dead. You-Know-Who killed them when he was a baby.”
"Silencio. A Slytherin's best friend."
He finished the food quickly, careful not to burn it, and shut the burner off. The clock on the wall told him he had already left the blonde git by himself for nearly thirty minutes. What plenty of damage he could do by that time.
Harry could hardly stand the idea of being expelled from Hogwarts. It was his
"No- wait, we?"
Harry's stomach does an unpleasant twist. He hadn't seen or heard from Remus since the incident at the Ministry last term. He hadn't even responded to his letter from the inn explaining everything. A darker part of him couldn't blame him- it was his fault his last living best friend had been murdered in cold blood.
Draco was bottling up his emotions and he didn't want that. He also didn't want to destroy Draco's good mood. Perhaps it was selfish but he missed talking to Draco about random things, even if it was only a couple days. He didn't want to scare that away now it seemed like he had it back.
Yooo sorry this took so long :/ Also, Thank you guys SO much for all the kind comments??? Like what the hell they actually made my day. All of them.
The truth was that he couldn't exactly get to it at the moment. It was locked downstairs like everything else but that wasn't necessary information he was willing to share. Besides, it wasn't like it was a lie either. He didn't want a repeat of last summer.
For a sliver of a moment he had thought Harry
Ron shuts up with a huff but doesn't move to put his wand up.
"What the bloody hell was that?" Draco demands. "You almost just collapsed out of nowhere!"
Snape watched him and smirked. "Enjoying your prize now, are we? You wouldn't have run off without some sort of souvenir."
fighting back." He says the word as if it's poison against his tastebuds. Draco wished he would hex the man right then and there. He hated sitting here and doing nothing as his pride was mocked time and time again. Yet he would. His father had cursed it into him more than enough for him to keep his mouth shut.
... He needed to talk to Dumbledore. He was the only person who could sort all of this out. He voiced his thoughts to the blonde who shrugged. "Fine, talk to the crazy bastard if you insist. Use an anti-tracking charm on your owl. I don't want anyone to find us after we just escaped. Also-" he lifts up his mug with a pout that resembled a kicked puppy. "More please?"
"Blimey! Knock would you?"
"I sent you a letter though- right before we were attacked. You didn't get it?" Harry frowned. Harry knew random owls were being checked but Hedwig had always been able to avoid being caught before.
He was absolutely crazy and he very well knew it. Four days was way too fast for a hatred to evaporate into thin air, let alone become fond.
Picture Yatin as Nathan Young from Misfits ;)
One look at Harry and torn face told him he wasn't going to be able to do that.
Harry lets the information mull over in his head. A part of him was frustrated at his words. Remus had chastised him for going after the woman and was now doing it himself?
"It's fine, Ron. You should go to class."
"Are they superficial or internal?" Harry scrunched up his nose in confusion. Draco sighed. "I mean does it hurt on the outside or on the inside."
"Prat."
"Ginny!" Ron exclaims.
"Scarhead."
“Yes, I told you about it this earlier. Why?”
He jumped up from his seat and moved to give Harry a hug but hesitated. Harry gave him a sheepish smile back. "...good morning."
Ron threw a pillow at him which he blocked with his own. On the other side of the dorm Dean cursed and pulled his pillow over his head. "Could you two please shut up?"
"If you had enough sense you would know that's not the case," Severus scowls. "You're dismissed. Meet me here at 6:30 sharp after dinner tomorrow for your detention."
Harry was as red as a Bubotuber and radiated heat like a hot pan. You could have cooked a three-course meal on his face. No-one, not even the innocent trolley lady, could have missed it. He wanted the earth to open up and swallow him whole. Harry never wanted to slap Draco so bad. He was getting a kick out of this, watching Harry squirm in embarrassment. He was purposely trying to take as long as he could and he just knew it.
Draco froze for a second. The word 'Halloween' seemed to catch him off guard. "Fine. Go back to grooming. People are noticing. Talk later."
"It's fine," he grunts, his face twisting in pain as he tried to sit up again. "Go on."
"Come off it please. I'm tired."
PS guys I usually have chapters posted a couple of days on Wattpad before putting it on here
Draco nods slightly, causing her to chuckle. “I’ve been there too. How do you think I got all these white hairs?”
"From you?"
so like I didn't *originally* decide to leave this on a cliffhanger then realized it would be hilarious if I did and I am not a human of restraint so here.
"For hours at a time?"
"Aren't you going to bring it to me?"
"You know fair well I can't do that," Harry mutters pointedly. Madam Pomfrey would go off her rockers if he found out. She'll tell Dumbledore, who'll tell Lupin, who'll tell his
“Okay….why is it called Cassowary’s comet then?”
Draco wasn't as blind as he was making himself out to be. Potter's torso was incredibly thin and his clothes were absolutely dreadful. Holes and dirt covered the rags and not to mention they were nearly seven sizes too big on him. He had already commented on the bruises on his face but it was clear he didn't want to talk about it.
Draco rolled his eyes. The boy was overdramatic and petty over something that had happened years ago. Had Draco acted that way his father would have already cut off his head. He also supposed this would have been exactly he had turned out had he not woken up sooner. "Get over it. Triviality doesn't suit the green on your robes."
He thought back to that night and shivers went down his spine. The day he didn't even put up a fight in getting the dark mark. When his cowardness shown through.

Harry sighs. "We do, Malfoy. But how do you expect us to get up there?  We have to this the muggle way. Here it is- hold on." Harry crept around the house and led them to a small wooden shed in the backyard.  Draco winces loudly when a loud shriek from the rusted hinges sound through the night air as Harry pulls the door open.
Merry Christmas babes! If you celebrate, that is. And if this is posted then,,, I have very bad impulse control. Anyways, what's the tea? Two cliffhangers? Merlin, I really am a garbage fire of a human being.

"It was just Dudley and I home. I said some things and he tried to attack me. Some accidental magic happened and he got a little scuffed up. So I took my trunk and left. A couple days later death eaters attacked the inn I stayed at. I was trying to help people get out when I got hit."
Snape sneered at him. "Of course you don't know. Your choices don't matter until they affect you personally, do they? Your father is indisposed. He hasn't been seen since your stunt in knockturn alley. No doubt caused by your... shall we say
He looks around the room, just now realizing how clean it was compared to its usual state. "Did you clean all of this?"
Draco doesn't think he's ever been happier to see that bob cut of black hair. Pansy's running down the hall fuming like hell itself. Her wand ks pointed directly at the two idiots on the floor and Draco had no doubt she was probably constraining herself from doing something she'll regret.
"Think Potter. I have a horde of death eaters who want me dead, a father who will stop at nothing to get to me, and by default know too much and have a prize on my head by the Dark Lord. Take your pick."
