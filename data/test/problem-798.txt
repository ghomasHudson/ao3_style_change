The garden looks different in the day—more normal, as if it’s waiting for night to come alive. Or maybe, as if it’s waiting for Draco.
But after Robards left down the hall, Harry peeked through the window of Jenkins’s room. She was sitting up, staring out the window. Sunlight illuminated the scars on her face. He didn’t go in.
“I dunno…” Harry trailed off, gently brushing the hair on Rose’s head with his fingertips. “I—It’s like something in me really wanted to be here.”
“Maybe he apparated,” Ron offered, but both Harry and Hermione shook their heads.
“I haven’t.” Draco felt himself flush. He’d had his fair share of food adventures since moving into a muggle flat five years ago, including an ungodly amount of Thai thanks to Pansy, but this was new.
Pansy climbed up onto the bed and snatched it from his hand. “Let me see that.” She glanced down at it, looking over at him with a perplexed expression.
The rest of the dinner went by in a blur. Draco barely registered the subject moving towards Goldstein’s job, which happened to be helping Granger—Granger-Weasley now, apparently—draft reconstruction legislation to ease the prejudices that contributed to the war. Though it was admirable work, Draco could barely bring himself to contribute anything insightful, so full his mind was of Potter nearly dying, Potter being a werewolf, Potter at the manor with his mother, Potter, Potter, Potter.
“—and he just showed up, out of the blue.”
Senalat poked her side. “You should come more often, you’re getting too skinny.”
Harry does. Little multicoloured lights flicker in different shades from within the berries, lending an effect similar to Christmas fairy lights.
?” she screeched. “My undies!”
“Malfoy,” Harry said. Ron groaned.
Narcissa glanced at him out of the corner of her eye. “Do you?” she said, the corner of her mouth twitching.
“So,” Narcissa began. “Tell me about this wireless program of yours.”
) and muttering, “I think that’s my cue. See you, Narcissa.” Then he scurried out of the drawing room and out into the hall, the bang of the front door echoing behind him. His mother watched him go with a disturbingly fond expression on her face.
“I make it,” he says when Harry looks at him, confused. “Trust me, it works wonders.”
“Berries,” Harry is saying, but Draco is rolling him onto his back, coming up onto their elbows to hover above him. Slender fingers trail from his hairline through his hair. They are still looking, looking.
,” she said, a scandalized expression on her face.
Draco smiles. “The night before you fell asleep in herbology. It doesn’t take a genius.”
He does. The spindles have opened more now, and in the center is a deep well. Inside is a clear liquid, but when he looks closer, he sees it.
Harry looks up, and for a moment thinks he’s dreaming. Malfoy is glaring down at him.
and opened the door. A little bell jingled from where it was floating above the doorway.
Robards must have seen the devastation in his face, because he said, “I’m sorry son. Best to wait it out.”
She barely remembered anything from during the war, but in eighth year, she’d told him that when she was a prisoner in his cellar, Malfoy had smuggled her dittany and what he could take from the kitchen. It was one of the things that softened Harry to him, but it was not enough to mend her struggling mind. It had been at the mercy of Bellatrix for far too long.
Draco was quick to say his pleasantries and be off, his eyelids drooping as he walked numbly to the flat he shared with Pansy. He stumbled through the doorway and had barely taken his shoes off before he was in his bed, dead to the world.
“You’re welcome,” he murmured. They looked at each other, both seeming to agree to lay down their arms, at least for a little while.
Harry is proven right when Malfoy says, “Yes, she’s along for the ride. Hold on.” Then he reaches a slender hand to the space above Harry’s head and his mind goes blank.
a long time ago. There was no reason his fleeting teenage memories should be taking up this much space in his head.
As the final cacophony of “Space Oddity” came to a close, Draco sat up in his seat, yawning as he gradually turned the volume on the record player to zero. Merlin, but he was tired.
Fuck. Onto the coffee table.
“—Research, we know,” said Ron. “But love, you barely get enough sleep as it is, yeah?” He elbowed her gently. “Harry’s an adult. Nothing bad happened, he says he knows what he’s doing, so I say we put this on the back burner for a bit.”
“Right here,” someone said from behind Draco, and he turned to see one of the most gorgeous humans he’d ever had the privilege to set eyes upon. Goldstein’s wavy blond hair was brushed back artfully from his face, and he wore a crisp burgundy shirt just slightly open at the collar, revealing a golden amulet in the hollow of his throat. Draco caught a whiff of cologne as Goldstein slipped into the booth next to him, and it washed over him in a haze. He looked over surreptitiously at Pansy, who was smirking in his direction.
“What do you do, Draco?” Goldstein asked.
He turned to his mother and raised his eyebrows.
After the slightly chaotic events of last month, Ron and Hermione had decided to stay the night at Grimmauld Place. Nothing Harry said could persuade them otherwise.
Just as Harry was dismantling the last of the threads, a clatter of footsteps sounded behind him and Jenkins came into view along with a few other aurors, a thunderous expression on her face.
“Shield Charms!” came Robard’s voice. “Whatever you do,
Jasmine laughed. She ripped a piece of the bread. “This is injera,” she said, using the piece to scoop up some of the lentils. “Do it like this.”
Draco looks far too guilty, like he’s afraid Harry is going to fall into pieces right there in the hall.
“…Though I do feel for the poor animal, as their new minder seems quite scatterbrained. In fact they asked me to air an ad, but unfortunately neglected to send it to me. Anyone with a spare brain to donate is welcome to contact the station.”
He sighed contentedly as the song faded into the air, the now familiar warm feeling growing as Elio’s voice emerged.
“So I just read this?” he sighed. “Any time in particular?”
Suddenly, he found himself in familiar woods. He slowed and hobbled forwards until a looming dark manor with sharp turrets came into view. A figure in green robes was rushing towards him, and he braced himself for more spells, swaying on his feet. But as he collapsed, just before he lost consciousness, he could have sworn he saw a curtain of light hair and a pair of worried grey eyes.
“I think you’d be surprised,” Goldstein said. “Look, Draco—can I call you that?”
. It’s 10 p.m.” A few jazzy piano notes played through the speaker. “Ever spent a day questioning your life choices? Me too.”
“I may bring it to Madam Pomfrey, or give it to someone when the time is right. It’s not meant to be unused forever. Hoarding it out of greed renders it about as effective as sugar water.”
Then one who must have been under six years old let out a harrowing cry, her young body arching in pain.
“With my hands?” Draco asked, feeling very out of his element. His mother would probably faint if she were here.
At his hesitation, they say, “We don’t have to.”
“Explosive material,” Harry said, smirking.
Ron glanced at him, before murmuring to Hermione, “Why don’t you go get the baby?”
“I know,” Harry says. “You are.”
But Draco’s smile seems to fall just a bit—enough to leave his face open, a flicker of something showing through.
Hermione shrugged. “I’m an expert in legislation, not magical creatures. Maybe you ought to talk to Luna about it. Ron, can you pass the pepper?”
At Harry’s puzzled expression, she added, “It’s when you need a deep connection with someone in order to have romantic feelings for them.”
That’s miles away!”
“Would you like some tea?” she asked, stepping back out into the living room. Harry followed and watched as she moved a teetering pile of books off of one end of the couch and onto the rapidly dwindling floor space, gesturing for Harry to sit.
“—help me hold them off,” Jenkins was yelling as she ducked beneath a purple flash of light. “Davis—upstairs. Take the kids somewhere safe—”
There was still the matter of the gala. Harry’s leave of absence from the Aurors was to be kept under wraps, and evidently whoever ran the auror PR committee suggested that to maintain the facade, Harry should attend. Harry, who had never been to a Ministry gala in his life, thought this would actually look
Harry couldn’t breathe. Even Hermione started laughing.
Draco sighed, shrugging her off. “I… I don’t—” he broke off, resting an elbow on the armrest of the sofa, head heavy in his palm, his fingers threaded into his hair. There was nothing he could say that wouldn’t make him sound utterly pathetic.
“You understand, you can’t say a word about this to anyone,” Goldstein said.
Jasmine laughed. “What do you think this is? Now you have to come back—she won’t take no for an answer.”
No, what draws Harry in is the way their eyelids flutter as they try to stay awake, the way they sometimes braid their hair in intricate designs that Harry can’t help but want to trace with his fingers. The way they no longer look at Harry anymore, which oddly makes him wildly desperate for just a glance.
“…‘Enough to have thought tonight, nothing finishes it. What you are, will have no certainty, or end.’” Draco cleared his throat and continued, “That you will stay, where you are, a human gentle wisp of life. Ah…’”
The tapestry bursts into flame.
Harry sighed, shivering with the cold, the damp soaking his worn boots. Jenkins was taking her damned time.
Narcissa’s chest was shaking with laughter, which gradually bubbled up from her throat and out into the room. Soon Harry was laughing too, because really, wasn’t it absurd? He watched as her head fell backwards onto the chair, one hand coming to rest on her chest in mirth. The shawl slipped from one shoulder, pooling in her lap.
“You know, an advertisement?” Lee grinned. “Don’t tell me you haven’t heard of them.”
“Delicious,” Draco said, moving to collect another bite. “Do you think Senalat would adopt me too?”
Draco’s looking at him so intently, he feels as though there must be something on his face. He resists the urge to wipe it with his hand.
Lee had just laughed, running long fingers through his thin locs. “I hope not,” he said. “Hardly anyone listens, so just come up with something.”
“Now,” she said, resting her head on his shoulder. “Tell me everything.”
Either Pansy didn’t notice the ire in his voice, or simply didn’t care. “Be nice, Terry,” she said sweetly. “Where’s Goldstein, anyway?”
“Why not?” Luna said. “You were such good friends before.”
“Thank
“It’s a fair question, considering my past—”
“Sorry!” he said, before realizing she wasn’t looking at him at all.
Still, with morbid fascination perhaps, or a healthy dose of masochism, he practices it too often—in transfiguration where it earns him a gentle “Potter?” from Professor McGonagall that jolts him out of his trance and into feeling like a disappointment, and in the Great Hall when he’d like his vegetables a little extra crispy, among other times.
“Oh.” Draco said. “Well, since we’re telling secrets and all… I host the nighttime programme on the WWN. You probably haven’t heard of it.”
“Nothing?” Goldstein raised his perfect eyebrows. Fuck, Draco was making an absolute fool of himself.
“Alright,” Hermione said, tapping her knee with an index finger. “This calls for—”
“They’d be better off chucking their galleons in the Thames,” Draco muttered. Looking up at Lee, he said, “It’s
He settles for stealing glances of his own, in between half hearted note-taking and even less enthusiastic casting, the droning of professors and the monotony of essay writing.
Lee raised an eyebrow. “You can respect me just fine by calling me Lee.”
Harry looks down. His body is still invisible—a small protection against the brilliance of that expression.
“—I’m afraid telling us the best parts beforehand would ruin the element of surprise, would it not?”
Hermione gestured sharply towards Harry. Ron just laughed. “The other baby, love. I’ve got this one.”
“‘Practices silence, the way of wind bursting its early lull. Cold morning to night, we go so slowly, without thought to ourselves…’”
“Uh huh” Draco replies from where they lie sprawling on the ground, staring up at the sky, eyes wide.
The plants are still so colourful they hurt his eyes. He squints at them, like looking at a red sun as it’s rising. “Why the…” he trails off, forgetting what he means to say.
Harry flicks his finger to extinguish the flame and turns around, hands trembling as he walks away. He doesn’t look back—he can’t bear to see whatever Draco’s face is doing right now.
She glanced at it. “Oooh, a love letter!”
He sees Draco lying on the ground and wonders when that happened. They are glowing a bright purple that’s nearly violet, a violet that’s nearly blue. It’s beautiful.
“And...” she continued hesitantly, “I think maybe—oh, how do I say this? Maybe your wolf instincts are telling you that we’re part of your… pack?”
So grateful to fools_errand for the help and encouragement on this chapter. Aiming to update weekly.
In Professor Olarinmoye’s class, Harry learns he has an affinity for fire. It sparkles on the tips of his fingers, but when he gets it wrong, he only makes smoke. Of course, everyone can master each of the forms, but somehow this makes him feel destructive, dangerous. He hates it.
“No problem, mate,” Ron said, standing up to collect their dishes.
“It’s not discrimination,” Boot argued. “There’s a reason—”
“No, of course not,” Harry says, weak with relief, reaching out to lightly curl an arm around Draco’s waist.
That night, after Harry returned to Grimmauld with a small bottle of wolfsbane in the inside pocket of his cloak, he dreamt of a forest not unlike the Forest of Borth, the howling of wolves, and the blood of young children staining the snow, seeping into the ground.
“I have to say, between you and me, either the dog is a werewolf or the couple are, or there’s some sort of kinky moon sex situation going on, in which case, well. Best not to ask too many questions,” the voice laughed lightly. “On the plus side, your life is likely to get a lot more interesting.”
The feeling of passing though wards like water set Harry immediately on edge. At the very least he’d expected them to resist his presence, however feebly.
“Draco?” he says. “I—what?”
“Oh, Ron—his face!” She took a deep breath, then succumbed to laughter again.
She pulled back and poked him as well, saying “You too. Yasmin, why haven’t you brought him here before?”
,” Hermione said meaningfully.
But he can feel the calming trembling of their magic in the air, and the way they love Malfoy. As if this person is their god and they themselves are Adam.
Their shoes made a light
“Oh!” Harry said, “I love this one.”
Draco turns to look at him, slowly. Then they smile. “Hair potions.”
“Any updates on the case?” Harry said. His mandatory leave had cut him off from being in the know and the Ministry was being tight-lipped as usual about it if the dull news in the Prophet was anything to go by, leaving him to scavenge for scraps of news that Ron offered him. It wasn’t much, since he had been on parental leave up until a few weeks ago.
Jasmine rolled her eyes, muttering “
They summon a vial from inside their robes, and siphon the essence of the spindly flower into it. The flame dances inside. Then they tuck the vial into their robes once more, setting the flower down carefully in the center of the garden.
He jumped as the door burst open. Pansy strode in, twirling off her coat.
They work until dawn, when Harry’s hands are a little less clumsy and inexperienced, though significantly more cracked. Draco wordlessly hands him a small jar of hand cream.
He can tell it frustrates Draco, even when she doesn’t say anything.
“What are the plants for?” Harry asks.
Ron grinned. “Now, now, ” he said lightly, setting the eggs cooking on a low flame. “But really, I actually like it a lot.”
“I’ll go,” came Golstein’s voice, though it sounded quieter the closer Draco got to the door.
“Nasty curse, that one. Selvage reckons the only reason he survived was because he was t—”
It was not to be. “Draco, would you mind staying after for a couple minutes?” Lee called. Fuck. He was going to get fired after less than a week on the job because he couldn’t manage to keep his thoughts inside his head, where they belonged. He resisted the urge to smack the smug expression right off Ernie’s face.
, appeared on the band.
The wall behind her exploded, and the blue light of a shield charm rose in an instant. “Thanks Greengrass!” she called, eyes trained on Greyback, whose hood had slipped off, face transforming as he stared her down, baring pointy yellow teeth.
“Alright,” he said, hoping to Merlin he wouldn’t come to regret it.
“Yes, sir.”
A doe scampered away from the path as Harry walked. The air warmed slightly as he neared the small stone cottage where Luna and Neville lived. Inside the wards, plants grew green and lush, a stark contrast with the sparse landscape outside. The aconite had full, deep purple blooms here. Harry looked around in wonder; Neville must have finally managed the climate charm.
“Still have no idea why you’re friends with her,” Ron said.
“For the last time, I was not—”
Draco fingered the tablecloth. He wished for a moment that he was a regular person, with a regular life. It would be much easier to hope for things.
” Greyback thrashed against the bindings, slashing at them with razor-sharp claws.
Draco really ought to name it by now, seeing as they were becoming frenemies. Perhaps he’d call it Icarus, but maybe it was a bit too cruel to attribute such a terrible fate to the bumbling little bird. It was tapping at the window, wings erratically bumping into the glass, shaking raindrops from its head.
In the back of Harry’s mind, he knew it would happen. But it’s worse than he imagined now it has. The horrible smell of burning silk rises in the air, and Harry has to leave
Jenkins turned, her eyes widening at the sight. “Fucking hell,” she whispered. The rows of children disappeared in the darkness—there were too many of them to count despite Harry’s rough estimate, and they were all about to transform by the looks of it.
The voice sounded different through human ears. It was the kind of voice that could have belonged to everyone and no one, Harry thought. It was a bit like listening to a close friend, one he’d never met.
“Get to the point,” Jasmine muttered next to him. Draco fought the urge to laugh.
“Excuse me,
Jasmine twirled her wedding band with her thumb. “He’s doing good,” she said softly.
Flickering slowly within the nectar, it burns perpetually and not at all, suspended in space, carefully tucked away within this growing life form for all this time.
Suddenly seized with worry, he said, “Please don’t tell anyone—I doubt they’d listen if they knew it was me.”
“I’d better go,” he said. “Thanks for cooking, Ron.”
Harry turned towards the window. The source of the tapping was a disgruntled-looking speckled owl that Harry had never seen before, large wings flapping as it hovered outside. He let it in and it swooped past him, landing on the back of the sofa, ruffling its feathers. It held a cream-coloured envelope in its beak.
Harry looked up from the letter at Ron and Hermione’s expectant faces.
“It’s an ad.” Lee said.
” Malfoy says, and strides out of the library’s double doors.
Draco made a futile attempt to snatch it back, before she caught it in her other hand, holding it away from him.
, and from the increasing effort he needs to put in every time Draco’s arm or hand or elbow brushes his skin.
Harry moved to grab the envelope, but it hopped backwards, ear tufts flattening.
“Oh for Merlin’s sake,” Draco said. “This is a muggle flat,” he told the owl.
“I second this,” Harry said from his seat at the kitchen table, crossing his legs and uncrossing them again once he realized how much of his leg was on display. They ached with the movement, though the feeling was rapidly fading.
The owl was a hungry cannibal, it seemed. He relinquished his hold on fate and shoved the takeout container towards it, skimming the letter. Oddly, it was written in red ink.
Harry sighed. “He always was a bit dramatic.”
All he can do is watch and wonder and sit in the garden, unseen and strangely lonely, wishing he didn’t have to be invisible here.
“Not to worry, I will,” he says quietly. “Come here.” He points his wand at Harry’s head, and for a second he thinks he must be mad, giving him access to his eyes, his throat, his major arteries.
“Have you been seeing anyone lately?” Narcissa was a mere shadow in the gloom now.
It’s a long time until they move from this embrace, long enough for the colours to fade completely, and for the sun to peek its yellow light through the trees instead.
It was embarrassing enough that Draco was indulging himself in this little nostalgic trip down memory lane, getting caught up in things he’d thought he’d laid to rest a long time ago. And that’s the thing, wasn’t it? It
He sat up, propping his elbows on the bedspread. “But doesn’t it look like his handwriting?”
It’s long and gleaming, falling like water down his back, except for the tendrils gently woven together at the top, making a tiny little cup. The bowtruckle is dipping the ends of it in the corner of Malfoy’s parted mouth, wetting the strands slightly before threading them together. Harry thinks Malfoy might have a conniption when he wakes.
But if anything, Lee looked more amused. “No need for all that, you can call me Lee,” he said.
“Respect the bubble,” she said pointedly. “You’re such a
“So What” dissolved into “Freddie Freeloader”, a transition so subtle Draco almost missed it, lost in his thoughts as he was. He let it play, relishing in a little break from the talking. Something Draco loved about the night shift, much to his chagrin, was his complete control over the material. When the job was turned over to him, the night program frankly could not have been worse. He’d listened to about twenty minutes of the last employee’s pithy attempts at wit and a good music taste, until he literally couldn’t withstand any more of it.
There are some descriptions of violence in first part of the chapter, so read with caution (more details in the end notes).
“Wolf feelings?” Hermione raised her eyebrows.
The last thing he saw before transforming was a jet of green light strike the small body against his chest.
“I don’t see how,” Harry started, but she held up a finger.
“Tell me what?” she asked, rising from her seat. “Shall we go check on the potion?”
Draco couldn’t bring himself to answer the letter, though it sat weighty in his pocket. He’d taken to fingering it absentmindedly. Which, even to Draco, seemed like an odd thing to do to a letter that could very well have been written by a perfect stranger.
Draco rested his forehead against the shelf, closing his eyes.
“Essentially, a third person to join a couple for a threesome.” she said. “Sometimes polyamorous, but not always, and they’re supposed to be really hard to find—that’s why they’re called unicorns—well, anyway. It’s a muggle thing.” She resumed the light clacking of her needles, which were sporting an unfinished light blue baby blanket.
Harry was struck by the memory of a small bundle of fur going limp in his arms. He pushed back from the table, unsure if the ache in his chest was from the memory or his coming transformation. He didn’t want to take any chances.
“Draco, all it says is, ‘Very funny’.”
He sat and watched the rain through the gap between yellow flowery curtains. There was a fire crackling in the hearth. On the mantle sat a framed picture of Neville and Luna that Harry had taken one spring in the Sanctuary, along with several long speckled feathers in a vase.
Harry thinks to the plant.
There are slightly unripe fruits on the ends of delicate limbs, some thorny, others smooth. Harry pricks his finger and watches a drop of blood soak into the soil, diluted by the rain, which is forming puddles on the ground. He sucks on it to stem the bleeding.
“Both, maybe,” Goldstein said. Draco resisted the urge to sigh. Irony was lost on this man.
Senalat gasped. “Now you just wait, and I’ll bring something out for you two.” She winked and disappeared into the kitchen.
“I’m not sure it’s such a good idea,” he said slowly. “I’m not exactly winning
“Wait, there’s no—” Draco said, but Senalat was already disappearing into the kitchen, “—silverware,” he finished lamely.
Smiling fondly down at Rose, she gently maneuvered the baby into Harry’s arms. “Careful, I just fed her, so…” she gestured towards his shoulder. “Watch out.”
would not. It seems fitting, a forest animal finding a temporary home here, despite being made of light. Why he finds himself thinking of Malfoy’s nest of hair, he can’t really say.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Honestly, have you
“Should we really be discussing this?” Pansy interjected, a desperate edge to her voice that immediately made Draco suspicious. Pansy was rarely shaken from her even temper.
“That bad, huh?” Ron said.
Harry smiled back down at her. “She’s family,” was all he could think of to say.
“I still think they knew we were coming,” Harry said, shaking his head. “Either that, or touching the kids triggered some sort of alarm.”
“They only glow once they mature,” they say. “See the colours?”
Narcissa stood and strode towards an old ornate wireless decorated with finely carved wood, the grain shining from beneath gleaming polish. “I’ll go with you,” she said, looking down at it, before turning to face him again, “Someone has to make sure you don’t make a fool of yourself. Do you mind?” She pointed her wand at the wireless. “There’s a programme I rather enjoy.”
There’s a ripple of something, and Harry knows it’s Malfoy. How he knows it’s them and not Luna slipping across the landscape, winding through the shadows and disappearing into the trees, Harry doesn’t know.
“Cut the shit, Draco.” she narrowed her eyes. “You haven’t listened to this record since—”
Was this a joke? Draco blinked. “Of course… I just thought—I mean, it’s a sign of respect?”
“I thought your mum still lived in Ethiopia?”
Harry shrugged. “I walked.”
On the first of December, Harry’s walking through the seventh floor corridor on the way to the DAHM classroom, when he’s pulled behind a tapestry. It takes a minute to catch his breath and ease himself of the tunnel vision.
Resignedly, he let the bird in, where it ruffled its feathers, spraying their sofa and nearby houseplants with a shower of rain water. Miraculously, the envelope was dry.
“Oi,” Harry interjected, spotting the warning signs of PDA early. “Pretty sure I was getting told off, here.”
“You’re forgetting I met you three weeks ago, Draco.”
Harry remembered. In a way, that made the whole thing worse. “It’s…complicated.”
“Again,” she said, rolling her eyes. “How should I know? You were the one who was obsessed with him in school.”
“I am,” Harry said, but even he wasn’t convinced.
“We’re everywhere…and nowhere,” Harry says.
at 5:58 a.m., and could have cried in relief when he saw the studio door opening to admit Lee, who would be in charge of the 6 a.m. national news segment. Draco watched as Lee slipped into Jasmine’s observation room, smiling fondly at the conjured orange sofa. He bent down and gently nudged her shoulder, murmuring something in her ear. When her eyes opened, she smiled up at him.
“Doing what?” Harry said, turning towards the stairs, the letter still clutched in his hand.
“Why would we want one?” Ron said, his brows furrowed in confusion. “Does it look like there’s a forest ‘round here?”
“It feels shaken,” Luna said, taking a seat in a patched armchair, a burgundy shawl wrapped around her shoulders.
In which Ron and Hermione have a good time, and Draco has a bit of a day.
, he wrote.
The plants almost seem to reach out to Malfoy as they pass by, and in turn they reach out to them, as if the plants themselves are God and Malfoy is Adam.
This morning, though, he was cranky and irritable, and had only managed to snatch three hours of sleep before he was called in. While usually he would attempt to appear as invisible as possible, he made no such effort today.
“That last one was from
Harry pats the now much shorter hair on the top of his head and can’t help but frown a little. “Can you grow it back?”
But though he’d always gotten a feeling of contentment from being at Ron and Hermione’s, last night was like that times a hundred. It was a feeling he couldn’t ignore—he felt it welling up inside him again as he looked down at Rose. Warm and full and lovely. He brought his face closer to her, inhaling the slightly sour scent. He was so close his hair must have accidentally brushed her face, because her fingers came up to grasp it in an iron grip. Then she smiled.
“Potter!”
“To be honest, it sounds exactly like the sort of thing he would do,” Hermione said.
“Yes.” Harry’s heart is thudding, sending vibrations into the ground.
It becomes a bit of a routine, the addition of this thing to the gardening. It’s harvest time, later than muggle crops since it’s mid November now, and they’ll pick the berries without eating them, curiosity having been satisfied. Draco shows him how to ask the plants for permission to take their leaves, their flowers, and their roots. She explains that they are rare ingredients for healing potions, although they do work wonders on her hair. But by beauty, she says, she means the way they exist and emit magic—the way they’re alive. Harry still thinks Draco is the source of all this beauty anyway.
“Robards seems to think the kidnappings have stopped, so that’s good,” Ron said. “But no one’s seen Greyback or Rowle since the raid, so we’re back to square one on that front.”
She glared at him, lightly swatting his arm with the back of her hand. “You’re such an arse.”
, and leaned back in his chair, hands clasped behind his head. “So What” streamed into the room and vibrated outwards in waves, invisibly. Draco imagined them swimming to the homes and wireless devices of wixen all over London, awake in their beds, nursing a cup of tea, or on a nighttime wander through deadened streets.
Harry turned around in recognition, and found several pairs of eyes looking at him with sheer terror. He whimpered, the sudden surge of energy giving way to sharp pain in his leg, and collapsed into the snow. They were advancing on him, he realized, panicked. Gathering his last bit of energy, he stood and bounded into the forest.
Draco’s mouth hung open. “But the night show
Draco’s fingers are like little squids in the air beside his head, miming puffs of hair growing sideways. “You look like a grandpa.”
It was a glistening tear, falling slowly down her face.
Her eyebrows shot up. “Rose wakes us up around then. You said it’s nice? Quiet?”
She chewed thoughtfully. “Not really. The way I see it, there are a couple options. Either your wolf somehow feels that you know him personally, perhaps from listening so frequently, or you do know Elio, you just don’t know that you know him.”
She fingered the material for a while, before quietly saying, “Thank you, Draco.”
“I think it’s good,” said Harry, as Hermione added, “No, I just like a lot of pepper I think.”
Harry ignored them, continuing to read.
“Exactly. You don’t know how horrible I was…” he trailed off as she narrowed her eyes.
“You know perfectly well you could visit me anytime you like.” Draco said coldly.
As it was, the moon shone in a bright beam through dusty windows, illuminating the worn and scratched wood floors of Regulus’s old room, faded green wallpaper dissolving into the darkness of the night.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry clumsily rises to his feet, suddenly feeling like an intruder. “I—I should go,” he stutters.
They smile, “I didn’t finish.”
Sure enough, the familiar voice emerged, though it sounded richer and somehow more melodic through quality speakers.
Lee chuckled. “Somebody paid good money for this ad, so I’m sure they expect it to be aired, yes.”
So he turned on the wireless.
“What’s that?” she said, pointing to the letter still in Draco’s hand, now slightly crumpled from the scuffle. “
“Yes,” Harry said, newly determined. The empty manor with its shadows and spiderwebs and dark magic was the wrong setting for her. It was a malignant force, one he knew all too well was seeping the life from her delicate frame. She belonged where her charm shone best—in the glittering world of polite society. “Would you like to go?”
His breath formed small grey puffs in the air as he walked. He never apparated directly onto the Manor grounds anymore, instead relying on the time and exercise to work up the nerve to go inside. It didn’t hurt that Wiltshire was beautiful, even in winter with a storm on the horizon. Still, his steps seemed to get heavier as he approached his childhood home. It rose menacingly as he approached, dark turrets stately and imposing, black iron gates stretching into the sky, a stark contrast to the silver frost littering the frozen garden just outside. No one could mistake it for anything but the home of generations of Slytherins.
He begins to laugh, overcome with an overwhelming sense of joy as more sparks flow down his fingers into the growing bonfire. Finally, the tension is breaking in his body, giving way to unbelievable relief. The fire is reaching upwards now, nearly as tall as the trees themselves, swirling into the darkening sky. Through the flames, Draco is illuminated against the backdrop of the forest. The magical colors of the garden flash among it, reflecting in Draco’s hair, shining onto his face. The light is flickering in his eyes and Harry loves him.
It was Pansy’s turn to roll her eyes. “So what’s got you in such a state?” she said, patting his head.
“Fine. No need to trouble yourself with an explanation on my account.” he said instead, taking Potter’s recently vacated seat.
Harry looked at the grandfather clock stuffed in the corner of the room. 3:24, it said.
Harry grinned. When he’d told her how he’d almost been sorted there, she had laughed for about five minutes straight, only stopping to gasp, “Draco, he—” before dissolving into laughter again.
Harry opens his eyes, gaze flicking to the garden. Draco’s are trained steadily on his. No, no, he can’t. This is something Draco
His limbs ached as he jogged down the stairs. That was one thing he’d discovered about being a werewolf—in many ways it was exactly like being a teenager. The stabbing pain in his legs and back felt like growing pains, and as a wolf he grew reckless, emotional and unreasonably needy.
“Ow!”
“We don’t know these people!”
Then he’s bringing a hand over his mouth as if he’s surprised at the sound. “I didn’t notice,” he says, smiling. “It always looks that way.”
“We have a baby!”
Soon, she brought out a mug with a floaty blue glaze, and handed it to him. The sweet smell of chamomile rose in the air.
“…there’s a sadness that wasn’t there before.” She sighed.
Draco felt his stomach drop. One of these days he was going to have words with his mother for not telling him things.
They rest their head next to his and drape their arm over him, gently pinning him in place, a set of fingers twirling the small curls in his hair.
Sighing in relief, Draco made to leave, eager to slip out the door before anyone could catch up to him.
“—Or worse, expelled.” Ron finished, pulling at one of Harry’s pink sleeves as he got up to relieve Hermione of the eggs, which looked unusually frothy.
Draco is looking back.
“I thought—”
“You’re very sure in your opinion,” Draco said, glancing at him shrewdly. He took a sip, deciding to attribute the warming in his face to the whisky and not the way Goldstein’s leg pressed briefly against his thigh.
The owl widened its eyes. Draco didn’t think that was even possible.
They kiss and kiss and kiss, Draco winding a hand around his hip as Harry pulls their chest to his, hands splaying across their shoulder blades. They kiss until Draco pulls away with a gasp, the side of their face brushing Harry’s, lips hovering near his ear. Harry blows a bit of hair out of his mouth.
“Then again, what’s a night without a little existential crisis?” Elio said. “Here’s another one, dedicated to all you married folks out there.” There was a muffled sound in the background. The sound crackled, and then—a funk rhythm bubbled out of the wireless. “‘Once in a Lifetime’ by Talking Heads.”
Harry settled himself in front of Ron and Hermione’s house. Curled up on the mat, he listened once more to the grainy noise of the wireless. The voice he liked so much was speaking again.
He raised his voice, turning around dramatically and belting out, “So it’s my job as new father and
Not that Draco wanted him to, or anything. Because that would be embarrassing.
Hands trembling, Harry calls the sparks to his fingertips. They feel lively, itching to get out. He lets one fall to the edge of the plot, and watches as it thaws the frozen stem, slowly making its way upwards to set the small white flower alight. The flames leap from flower to flower, gradually setting the garden ablaze. The heat begins to warm Harry’s skin.
Draco shrugs. “I don’t mind, to be honest. This is a sanctuary for all kinds of things. Weird stalker boys included.”
“Up here!” Harry yelled, already closing the door to Regulus’s room, where he’d been doing some deep cleaning. He’d also purchased a couple large fuzzy dog beds as well as a rib and a chew toy, in the hopes that it would keep him distracted and prevent him from winding up naked in front of all his friends. Ron and Hermione were more than enough, thank you very much.
“I don’t get it,” Ron said. “Where are they finding all these unicorns?”
“I’m not…” Harry says, but the effect is ruined by the fact that he can’t tear his eyes away.
Harry waded through the cursed, ill, and generally inconvenienced population of St. Mungo’s. There was a woman waddling around with duck feet. He jumped when she opened her mouth and quacked at him.
“Also, I’ve been asked to announce that the dog-sitter position advertised last Friday has been filled. It seems the lovely couple will get to enjoy their moonlit adventures uninterrupted…”
Once Harry had escaped that entirely useless conversation and extracted his head from the fire, he was struck with inspiration. Hurrying over to the study, he rummaged in an ancient writing desk for a spare parchment and a quill, accioed a vial of red ink, and began to scribble a note.
They lead him to a small grassy clearing a few steps away from the garden. Harry opens his eyes fully, and immediately breaks out in goose pimples.
It came back to him in a rush, leaving his head light and dizzy, like hurtling mid-fall from a great height.
Harry shrugs. “Nothing, so far.”
She stops and turns, a hand clutching the strap of her bag. One side of her face is in shadow.
Most of the questions Elio had asked Harry had no idea how to answer without giving himself away, except maybe the bit about being up at night. Nightmares were common enough among wizarding folk, especially the ones who’d lived through the war. The fact that these days Harry’s were about more recent events wasn’t necessary to mention.
Draco’s mouth is coming down onto his, the hand on his cheek is burning, and all the colours of their magic are converging.
Draco never asks why Harry keeps coming back to the garden, and though Harry feels oddly compelled to tell her, he never says. Perhaps because the real reason is too revealing, or because he doesn’t really know why himself.
“Because,” she continued, “the person I know is kind, and fair, and definitely not a bigot.”
“Er, I think I’d know if I apparated though, right?”
“Then what is it?” he says desperately. “Why are you hiding this part of yourse—”
“I wasn’t expecting to meet you here,” a voice called after him. Despite his better judgement, he turned around. Goldstein was walking briskly towards him, cloak falling gracefully from his shoulders, curls fluttering in the breeze.
His gaze was drawn back to the letter, if you could call it that. The handwriting was atrocious; there were dark red ink splotches everywhere that if Draco didn’t know better he’d assume was blood, and several words were scratched out. At the same time it seemed familiar, in the way you’d imagine a penguin if you’ve never seen a picture of one.
“They’re magic,” Draco says, though Harry thinks that’s pretty evident.
“Why didn’t you say anything?”
“Is this…?” Narcissa looked at Harry, who could no longer keep from laughing.
He smiled. “I won’t be able to, but I know how you might find someone,” he said. “Do you ever listen to the wireless?”
, right?” he said. “So you’re Elio?”
Harry feels his face heat.
“I think we can work something out,” she said smugly.
Hermione stood, catching hold of Harry’s arm. “We’ll be down here if you need anything, okay?”
With the window of time before moonrise closing, Harry’d had no choice but to replace the broken record player beneath the bed, and drag himself into the spare bedroom. But the urge to listen to something hadn’t gone away, so he’d chosen the next closest thing—the old beaten wireless out of which Romulus’s voice had once emerged on Potterwatch.
“Yes.” Draco holds out a hand, and Harry places the flower in their palm.
“Likewise,” Draco said, feeling oddly off balance.
The Sanctuary was in Wales, and encompassed the ancient Forest of Borth along the coast, as well as vast stretches of heather moors further inland. Before Luna and Neville took over it had fallen into a state of abandonment, its previous caretaker having been a muggleborn murdered by the Death Eaters.
“—playing with him, and giving him treats may contact the station and we’ll relay your interest.”
“It’s really only when Elio’s on.” Harry sighed. “I know, it sounds weird.”
He flops on the ground next to Draco, giggling at the purple blob of magic around their head. He reaches out to touch it, but accidentally boops Draco in the nose. They jerk their head back five seconds too late.
“They’ll be listening in a few months, and I think you have a good chance of winning the nighttime category.”
“Pleasure to meet you,” Draco said, extending a hand. Senalat laughed, and moved to hug him too. After a moment of shock, he gingerly returned it. For such a small woman, she had a significant presence. Her hugs were fantastic.
Was he asking or assuming? “If you must.”
“Not this again,” she said.
Luna twirled a strand of hair around a finger. “I believe Neville might. My thoughts keep me occupied, usually.”
Their breath is coming out in gentle little clouds, mingling and then vanishing.
“I thought—isn’t everyone like that?”
He laughed to himself as he bounded up, taking them two at a time, seeking the solitude of Regulus’s room to read it again. On the way up, he flipped the letter over.
She laughed. “In this case, yes. Come on,” she led him to a small restaurant with a faded sign that said
popularity contests, am I?”
Sifting through the rubble and hearing the faint screaming of Walburga Black four floors below (who’d evidently been woken and was now shrieking profanities at the top of her lungs), Harry managed to extract the little wireless with a claw, batting it towards the center of the room where it landed on the rug. By now, the song was over, and a smooth voice was saying, “…and that last one was “Ashes to Ashes”, by legend and bi icon David Bowie. Actually, the song references an earlier era in the rockstar’s life…”
“Er, I was wondering… ” Harry gestures towards the top of his head. He can feel a little tingling on his scalp, as if from the pressure of very tiny leaf-feet.
“You know, Hermione said the same thing,” Goldstein said. “She took the class and found it riddled with inaccuracies. Their history is interesting, but it’s definitely not a practical guide for living among them.”
He followed his wand in a winding path through the barren, grey trees, eerie silence betraying a malignant presence that the peaceful blanket of snow did not.
Harry falls asleep in herbology. A bowtruckle makes a nest in his hair.
“I meant for tonight,” she said, and only then did Harry notice Rose sleeping in a little carrier Hermione had set on the sofa. He made a beeline towards her, but was careful not to wake her up as he peered down at her tiny face.
He ran and ran and ran, panting breaths loud in the deafening quiet, heart pounding in his ears. He sprinted through the trees, and in his moments of lucidity the only thought echoing in his head was,
After a lengthy pause, Draco offered, “You also seem like not an absolute prick. Unlike your friend in there.” He nodded his head towards the restaurant.
Harry laughed. “Why? I’ve got you two.”
“Give that back,” Draco leaned over her, but she elbowed him in the face. “Ow!”
Draco steps away, and says, “The thing about this plant is, it needs a particular nutrient to grow. Without it, it will never produce another flower.” They’re walking briskly to the other side of the garden. “Burn it, Harry,” they call.
He pitched his voice soft and low, a sound he’d crafted both for the sake of anonymity and for ease of listening, and continued, “But I hope at least some of you have taken some comfort and respite from the endless silence of being awake many-a-night…believe me, I know.” He laughed softly.  “And on that happy note, it’s 3 a.m., I'm Elio Durand, and you’re listening to Hey Moon, the Wizarding Wireless Network’s night show.” He pressed a button on the console, which played a few seconds of a little piano interlude Draco had chosen to replace the gaudy electronic one periodically showcased during the day.
“I know babe, but it’d be fun, wouldn’t it?”
also.
“Potter,” Robards said, rubbing the space between his thick eyebrows with a weathered knuckle. “You are a safety risk.”
Harry slumped against the couch. “I dunno,” he said. “We didn’t really talk.”
“No,” Harry shook his head. “Better not.” He shuddered to imagine what Tipsy Harry would be like as a wolf, on top of his already unpredictable personality. Wolfsbane made him more docile; rather than displaying protectiveness to the point of violence, he merely felt a strong urge to be with his pack. Which right now, was Rose, Ron, and Hermione.
Harry slowly pushed open the gate. It let out a long, low squeal.
Memories of his teaching threatened to envelop Harry, which had prompted him to search Grimmauld Place high and low for a record player, reminiscent of the one he’d known Remus to play in DADA. Harry had found one eventually, a nondescript black box covered in dust, shoved beneath Sirius’s old bed. He’d opened the lid, heart sinking once he noticed the state of the thing. Well beyond his reparative capabilities for such a finicky muggle object. Remus would have been able to fix it, he was sure.
Now a very different sound was emerging from it, a voice marred with the crackling of radiowaves and magic, a strange wobbling music that prompted Harry to nudge it with his nose in a misguided attempt at improving the signal. After merely succeeding at sliding it further down the table, frustrated, Harry lifted his paws to lean on it. Underestimating his weight, the whole thing, including a pile of old tomes, several Slytherin themed paperweights, and a very disgruntled looking portrait came crashing down onto the floor. He yelped. Bollocks.
“WWA?” Draco asked.
He swiftly changed the record to Miles Davis’s
He gritted his teeth. “Well if you’ve finished singing Potter’s praises, it so happens that I am here now, and I brought you something.” He reached into his pocket, pulling out the soft shrunken wool. Waving his wand, he returned it to its original size.
It was making Draco miserable, but he was well-acquainted with misery. Worse, it was making him distracted. He’d been in another hole-in-the-wall record shop in muggle London, perusing music to play on the show, when he’d found himself listening to nearly every Beatles record, trying to find the song Granger had played in the common room so long ago, that Potter seemed to love so much.
Another trick question. They rounded a corner into a quieter alley, with subtly moving logos on the shop signs the only indication they were in the wizarding quarter now.
his brain was chanting.
Right. So this was why Pansy had insisted on him coming. So much for her needing a buffer from the amorous attentions of one Terry Boot. He didn’t know whether he wanted to yell at her or prostrate himself at her feet.
“To Devon?” Hermione hissed. “
“Of course I have!”
“You locked yourself out,” Hermione said faintly, as Ron asked, “But how did you get here?”
They’d scoped out the area beforehand—the forest was public wizarding land now, but had once been the site of dark rituals since ancient times. Ruins lay buried beneath the earth, but that wasn’t what they’d come for.
“Like phoenix tears,” Harry says quietly. He glances at his forearm, where there is no puncture scar.
“Potter?” Draco said, looking up from his drink. Pansy put her face in her hands, black hair fanning out over her fingers.
“Mother,” he called. “I’ve come bearing—
“Oh piss off,” says Harry, grinning.
“Okay,” Harry said. “So the family thing—being my pack or whatever, you think that’s why I decided to show up here?”
“Give it here,” Harry said, feeling a jolt of excitement. By now, he hadn’t really expected Elio to respond to his letters—there’d been three of them, including the ad he’d sent in for Luna the other day, or with no response.
But just as Draco was setting the needle on the album, an unfamiliar owl flew in through the open window, promptly getting caught in the curtain and tumbling to the floor. It ruffled its feathers, hopped along the edge of the rug, one claw still pulling on the curtain, and promptly shat on the floor.
But he simply laughs, and says, “You’re right. But I’ve known you were following me since that first night.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Agony ripped through Harry as he stumbled, a searing pain spreading from where the curse had hit his leg. Rowle laughed maniacally.
They knew he was good—that’s why they’d hired him. Draco had a way with speaking, something instilled in him since childhood, of making everything he said sound interesting and important, and letting people be at ease with it. It was a dangerous ability, as his father had handily demonstrated, but nowadays Draco only wanted to use it to connect to people without being spat at.
“Wow,” Hermione said. “The last time I listened to the WWN at night I thought I was going to have an aneurysm.”
“Well who doesn’t?” Harry wiggled his eyebrows.
“Wait, yes,” Harry says, taking the berry. Their fingers brush. Harry puts it in his mouth.
“Right,” he said seriously.
When Pansy said nothing, Boot shrugged, sipping his beer. “Anyhow, we’ve still got some of them under stasis, but it’s not looking good. The aurors are all imbeciles—I mean really, stunning five year olds? What were they thinking?”
Draco felt dizzy with relief. He took the parchment, unrolling it. Near the top it said, “MOON-GAZING COUPLE IN SEARCH OF DOG-SITTER.” He looked up at Lee in confusion. “What is this?”
He wondered what sort of regrets Elio was holding onto, what things he’d done that made him feel so undeserving of redemption. He wondered why, even though they were strangers, the words felt like he’d heard them a million times before. Unbidden, an image of Draco in the eighth year common room in the middle of the night, firelight flickering over his face, rose in his mind.
He sighed. “I still think it’s not a good idea—”
Now suddenly they were getting yanked out at random moments and strewn about—he’d turn on the hob and remember his slippery hand in Potter’s, the acrid scent of smoke and fear and death, and Draco, sick and trembling with relief, pressing his forehead between Potter’s shoulder blades as fiendfyre swirled around them; he’d pour himself tea and be transported to late nights in the eighth year common room, talking quietly to while away the most nightmarish hours; a sip of whiskey would tug him back to the taste of Potter’s mouth, and it wasn’t even the same kind.
“I apologize for my behavior today,” Draco said stiffly. “I meant no disrespect to you… or Ernie…” he trailed off.
Senalat tsked. “That boy works too much. Every day, on the wireless. I think I hear him more than I see him these days!”
“What’s not just muggles?” Hermione said as she entered the kitchen, gently bouncing a very tiny Rose. Privately, Harry rather thought she looked like one. Deep red and a bit wrinkly and utterly beautiful.
He’d looked so striking that day, confidently sweeping into the room, robes floating around him, windswept hair falling into his eyes, which burned into Harry’s in the moments before he’d looked away. At the sight of him, a flicker of something Harry hadn’t felt for years passed through his chest, which was absurd.
Boot shot her an odd glance. “Tony knows what happened, though,” he said.
After Draco had dodged several hexes in between trying to explain that no, he hadn’t technically eaten her leftovers, Pansy stretched out onto the sofa still in her green healer’s robes. She’d spelled them a paler shade than the usual lime green, which both flattered her and made her stick out like a sore thumb among the other St. Mungo’s staff. But Pansy was competent, and intimidating, and was never forced to change them back. At least that’s how she told it, anyway. You never knew with Pansy.
“I only just met him, Ema,” she said with a laugh. “He works with Lee.”
Rose, with impeccable timing, spit up all over the dressing gown. Hermione laughed at Harry’s indignant expression and took pity on him, vanishing the mess and turning to sit at the table.
“What’s going on?” Ron said, stepping into the living room.
Draco’s eyes snapped up. “
“Sounds riveting,” Draco said.
Harry’s ears pricked. The voice sounded oddly familiar, and it brought him a strange comfort. He circled the wireless and lay curled around it, snout tucked into his side, the wireless snug next to his belly. As he listened to the voice rising and falling in a soothing rhythm, he found his breath evening out, gently fanning his fur. The itch to run wild seemed to quiet within him.
Instead, he said, “Difficult, at first. There was a steep learning curve, especially because I knew next to nothing about muggles.”
It overwhelms him so much he gazes straight into the blaze, right where the spindly flower used to grow. But Harry can’t keep his eyes away for long.
Nothing but the buzzing of magic growing steadily stronger gave away the cellar when Harry found it. He cast a melting charm, which revealed a smooth wooden trapdoor. Someone had been here recently. He sent the coordinates on the band.
Hermione looked at him in warning. “Ronald, we are not—”
Draco raised his hand. The glares magnified exponentially, which might have made him laugh if it weren’t so damn depressing.
Tall trees grew on either side of the path, skeletons reaching out of the frozen soil towards the sky. Along the edge grew a muted green plant with long spindly leaves and stalks that nearly reached Harry’s shoulders. He was familiar with it by now—after all, he’d need to drink it every month for the rest of his life.
“You know,” she said, patting his leg. “We need to find you some new friends.”
, he charmed on the metal band fastened to his wrist.
Two hours came and went, and soon enough it was the end of Draco’s shift. He lifted the needle from
Harry moved towards an unconscious boy, whose hands were beginning to sprout tufts of light grey fur. Scooping him up, he turned to run up the stairs when the crack of apparition sounded through the room.
“What else could I do? He was there to see Narcissa, not me. He acted like I wasn’t even there.”
“Magic relies on intent. Consent is part of that,” they explain. “For healing magic especially, consent determines whether it works. It’s why stealing a Unicorn’s blood is such a vile act.”
, came the response.
“If you find me so fucking offensive, just ignore me. It’s really not that hard—everyone else seems to manage it,” Malfoy says bitterly, moving to leave.
“Okay, fine!” he said, getting up. “But for the record—”
Normally, he didn’t mind it. Some of those dates had ended in a varying range of sexual experiences; there were no inhibitions for him in that department. But he never stayed until the morning. He never wanted to.
“Really?” she mused. “Going from loving someone to hating them doesn’t seem that simple to me.”
on the cobblestones. He sniffed. “I suppose you’re the authority on the matter.”
Harry replied.
He slipped past the now-snoring portrait of Walburga, praying the wireless wouldn’t wake her, and after several embarrassing attempts to open the front door which may or may not have involved him falling over (twice!), the door swung inward and Harry just managed to snatch his tail outside before it closed with a final thud. Immediately, a strong wind ruffled his fur, and it felt so good Harry couldn’t help but leap down the steps—all at once—and take off running down the street.
“Bloody nightmare,” Boot said sourly. “Most of the kids have been discharged by now, but nearly all of them were turned—”
Across the cellar floor, in utter squalor, lay what had to be more than fifty children, restricted by chains and what Harry recognized as magical barriers preventing them from moving around the room. They were in varying levels of consciousness, some passed out and bleeding, others watching him with deadened eyes.
gets ads.”
“—and yes, I do take requests, but I’ll only play them if they’re good. ‘Killer Queen’, everybody.” There was a light click, then the sound of fingers snapping.
Smiling despite himself, Harry chucked the floo powder into the flames, yelling “Granger-Weasley residence!” He stuck his head in the flames.
Quietly, he opened the door to Regulus’s room, which was much emptier than it had been last month. The crammed bookshelves and chest of drawers had been cleared out, leaving only the ornate bed, on it an old patchwork quilt he’d found in the attic, along with the dog things he’d bought. The last vestiges of the sun shone through curtains and clean windows, and on the side table sat the red wireless he always listened to in the evenings. He switched it on, but turned it off again when an unfamiliar voice came on.
Harry felt strangely unbothered by this new information. It made perfect sense. Ron and Hermione, and now Rose, were probably the people he loved most in the world. Lately, though, it had been hard, with the new baby and his two friends being such a close unit. It left him feeling bereft in a way he would never ever tell them about.
The question caught him so off-guard he found himself saying, “Nothing.”
Hermione looked at him. “I thought you were…you know. Over it by now.” she said, her voice soft.
“Don’t worry, it’s on me tonight,” he murmured.
“It’s not a pretty sight,” he said finally. “What if I scare Rose?”
Draco reaches a hand upwards. “Look,” they say.
“Well I live with Draco in a Muggle flat, and I work at St. Mungo’s,” Pansy said coolly. “In some cases it’s just practical when faced with housing and hiring discrimination among wizards.”
Narcissa rolled her eyes. “Boys,” she muttered. Still, she was smiling, still looking at the ornate wireless with a fond expression Harry didn’t quite think it deserved. The song faded into the quiet of the room.
They smile enigmatically. “Many things. It’s one of the most powerful healing essences known to magic.”
“Hey Hermione,” he said, making his way back to the table, where Ron had dished up roast with carrots and potatoes, giving Harry an extra large portion of meat. “Is it possible for someone you’ve never met to be in your pack?”
They are gracefully walking among the plants, trailing a hand lovingly across their leaves, bending to smell a large spindly flower, hair braided simply and falling down their back. A wisp of it falls in their face, which is illuminated by the tendrils of light emerging from the little swaying flowers.
They reach the edge of the forest just as the sun is dipping behind the castle. It casts a long shadow over them as they make their way to the garden. When they get there, it’s still achingly beautiful. The grass surrounding it is frozen and silvery, and some of the frost is resting on the flowers. Harry moves closer and realizes they’re nearly frozen, gradually shriveling up from the cold. Draco leads him to the center of the garden, to the spindly flower. They murmur something Harry can’t hear, then with a sharp movement of their wand, slice it clean off the vine.
The door opened before he even reached the top step. Luna beckoned him inside, her hair half up in a small bun, wisps floating around her face.
“Nothing, really,” Harry said. “I left.”
“I worked in the muggle world for a while…” he said, looking down at his plate. It was too bad he was no longer hungry—the food really was delicious.
“Beauty,” Draco says.
“What is your problem?” she says, black painted nails drumming on the table in the library.
“Yes,” Ron leered, “but I’m your arse,” he said to Hermione, ignoring Harry completely. Harry watched as her eye twitched, face contorted in an expression conflicted between amusement and annoyance.
Legs nearly numb from dozing on the floor, Harry gingerly rolled to his feet. Shaking his fur, he peered out the window onto the empty street. Surely it wouldn’t hurt to just take a quick peek outside? Turning back to the wireless, he bent down to gently pick it up in his mouth, and bounded towards the door. After a quick scrabble with the door handle, it swung open silently, and Harry padded his way down four flights of dark stairs, jazz floating in the air around him.
He waits a bit. Then suddenly, he feels it. It’s like nothing that can be described in words.
“You brought
Draco felt himself flush, unsure how to respond. He looked down at the parchment, skimming it. He blinked in confusion, then read it again more thoroughly. What the fuck?
“You saved his,” Draco pointed out.
At Draco’s confusion, Goldstein leaned towards him, pointing at his menu. “I’m partial to a good firewhisky myself,” he said pleasantly, tapping it with his wand. A crystal glass tumbler with smoking amber liquid appeared on the table. “See what you think.”
“We only see each other in the garden!” he explodes.
Draco cleared his throat and averted his gaze, because no, he did not have the emotional bandwidth to process a not-not-hot Potter looking like an adorable lost puppy in his mother’s house. Not when the last time they’d spoken, he’d made a complete fool of himself.
She glanced at Potter, who was looking back at her. “One of these days, Draco,” she sighed dramatically. “Death comes for all of us.” Was Draco insane or did Potter just snort? What was going on?
Draco elbowed Goldstein again, more firmly this time, trying to keep his breathing under control. “Sorry,” he said quietly, and slipped out of the booth, Draco right behind him.
Against the wishes of his screaming mind, he looks again. Malfoy is dutifully taking notes, green peacock feather dancing near his earlobe, through which there is a small golden hoop. It’s as if Harry isn’t sitting only two rows away.
But Harry trusts Draco, and all of a sudden he finds himself immensely curious. What would magic even look like? The essence of their world, distilled into a visible wavelength. How would it feel to see it?
“Yes, sir.” Harry swallowed around the burning in his throat.
“Yasmin, it’s been too long!” came a booming voice from inside the restaurant, before Jasmine was enveloped in a tight hug.
The condition of his employment was that along with the new voice he’d crafted for the wireless, he would have a different persona on air—Elio Durand. He’d made the choice with a healthy dose of irony—eternal sun on the night shift, how about that?—but he found it suited him nevertheless. He’d long ago accepted the fact that his real name was worth less than two knuts rubbed together, and would in fact be a liability to anyone charitable enough to hire him.
He lifted the door, glancing around once more, noticing the clouds giving way to a starry sky, before treading lightly down the stone steps into the darkness below. Slowly, his eyes adjusted, flickering wall sconces dimly illuminating the horrific sight before him.
“Hello, Harry,” she said, stepping aside to let him in. He followed her as she wove between stacks of books and floors nearly covered with potted plants, past dishes washing themselves in the sink and candles floating in the air. A few drops of rain began to splatter against the lattice window.
“Hello to you too,” Draco said, looking up from the letter. “Nice day?”
Harry laughed. “No, you’ll see.”
“What? No!” Harry knocks over his inkwell in his haste to stand up. “You’re not. Not at all.”
“What is gunpowder?”
“…Ask?”
“If you say so,” Draco said, and grinned.
“Fuck, is that
Ernie Macmillan, a man whose personality and general demeanour resembled a pufferfish, was monologuing about his morning talk show. “I—er, that is to say. I was hoping we might—”
She shook her head fondly. “I couldn’t possibly,” she said. “Your reputation—”
Ron and Hermione, predictably, were lounging in the living room, listening to the wireless. Upon seeing Harry’s head in the fire, they dissolved into laughter, Hermione weakly grabbing onto Ron’s arm for support, shoulders shaking.
“Where will it go?”
“I was listening to it,” Harry said absently, still staring at Rose. She was staring back. “Couldn’t sleep… was nice. There was jazz.”
Because after eighth year, the man had disappeared into thin air. After a while, Harry had given up looking for him. He knew the signs of someone who didn’t want to be found.
The door opens for him, silently.
“Then why—”
Harry laughed under his breath.
Harry doesn’t believe that for a second. Draco never approaches him inside, except that once in the library. Harry’s always thought he was uncomfortable with that, so he doesn’t usually go up to him either, no matter how many lingering glances they share in class. “No, what is it?” he asks, now getting worried. Maybe Draco is tired of this, of him. Most people are, Harry especially.
Ron nodded somberly. “Some of them, yeah. The ones that made it.”
“Yeah well, I’m gonna be selfish and from now on, you don’t need supervision. I think we’ve satisfied the higher-ups, don’t you?” He winked.
“Urgh, my brain!” Harry cringed, uncomfortably reminded of the many times he’d accidentally flooed in on them and wanted to gouge his eyes out.
Draco felt faint. So Potter was a werewolf, but that didn’t necessarily mean anything. The person writing him could be anyone, and there was no indication he might be right about the werewolf thing, except Potter’s—someone’s—implication that he was. More importantly, he thought as he glared across the table, Pansy had known, and she hadn’t told him.
Jasmine was watching him with eyebrows raised, an amused expression on her face.
“Malfoy,” he said smoothly, extending a hand. Draco looked at it in dismay until Pansy kicked him under the table, the sharp toe of her shoe making his eyes water. He shook it firmly, and Goldstein smiled at him slightly, before slipping his hand out of his grasp.
“Nothing!” Harry says. It’s not entirely true, but the only problems Harry has these days are with himself.
“Oh… not much,” Harry said vaguely. Somehow, the contents of the letter felt like a secret that shouldn’t be spoken aloud.
“Yes, we’ve established that,” she said from across the room.
“Because he was what?” Draco said, heart beating erratically in his chest.
“And that explains why I’ve never seen him there before, does it?”
It’s late October now, and the cool breeze lifts his hair as he steps outside. Various shades of the darkness spread out in front of him: dark greys of the grounds, shadowless from the new moon; the long thin black shape on the horizon to his left where the forbidden forest sleeps; midnight blues of sky littered with stars that seem cold and distant.
Harry nodded.
Ron scoffed. “A bit?” he leaned forward, resting freckled elbows on his knees, loosely clasping his hands. “So what’d he say?”
Harry’s gaze snapped up in delight. Ron and Hermione were looking at Rose with identical shocked expressions.
Draped in his hands was now a finely knit sage green shawl he’d found in a muggle boutique. It had cost half his first paycheck from Lee, but it was worth it. He’d gotten Pansy to help him weave warming and calming charms into it, imbuing the garment with a sense of peace he imagined didn’t often come easily within this mausoleum of a house.
“Does she need her nest?” Harry says.
“Draco, what the
,” Lee replied. “Jasmine tells me it’s going well.”
He handed it to her and helped her situate it around her shoulders.
“Malfoy,” he says. Malfoy is wearing a light grey scarf. It looks so soft Harry is tempted to touch it. He turns around, surprise written all over his face.
It was like this gaping hole in his chest where romantic feelings were supposed to go.
Despite himself, Draco felt a flutter of excitement. As a child he’d often imagined dressing in fancy robes as he’d watched his parents do, speaking with important people, spreading his influence around. He very much doubted he had much of that anymore.
Draco stands and makes her way over to Harry, kissing him gently. Lips barely a centimeter away, she whispers, “Burn it.”
“Just think.”
“Oh for Salazar’s sake, turn that thing off.” Pansy waved her wand at the record player, sending it to a screeching halt. “I heard enough of it in eighth year to make my ears bleed,” she mumbled.
He’s taken to eyeing Malfoy in the classes they share, which happens to be nearly all of them, with the eighth year cohort so small. It’s not because of the gender thing, although Harry has noticed that too—the way Malfoy seems happier in herself, in her body. The way she quietly embraces her own expansiveness. The freedom suits her.
It feels
For what purpose, Harry thought as his stomach twisted in disgust, they could only guess.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat. Oh fuck, had he really forgotten? He felt his face heat in mortification but was soon distracted by a soft sound coming from his right.
Draco felt his chest turn cold as he tucked his shaking hands under the table. Suddenly, he needed to leave. He nudged Goldstein, who was staring at Boot, a perturbed expression on his face.
It’s anticlimactic really, the
“I’m not sure why. Usually in winter I can barely feel the energy at all, it’s so deep underground. But now…” she trailed off, gazing out the window. The rain was pelting it now and streaming down the diamond-shaped glass panes.
Draco stared in shock. “Yeah,” he said weakly.
Harry’s footsteps were silent in the snow, disappearing behind him with a flick of his wand. Harry was under the cloak, invisible except for the clouds that escaped into the cold air with every breath he took. His wand lay obediently in the palm of his hand, pointing him towards the cellar he knew was hidden beneath the deceptively calm forest floor.
Ernie cheeks puffed in indignation. “What’s that supposed to m—”
“I am not—”
The hand comes down again, and with it a small laughing bowtruckle, maybe a young one, though Harry can’t really tell. Malfoy tickles her with the first finger of his other hand. “There you are,” he whispers. Harry is struck with the realization that he can’t possibly be just
, Harry sent, his heart thumping erratically.
“Feels so good.” Harry can still feel the tingling, can imagine the streaks of magic they’ve left there. The warmth of Draco is above him, and the cold frozen ground is pressing into his back except where Draco is cradling his head with one hand.
“You trust Luna,” Hermione said, “and we trust you. Well, and the fact you wouldn’t hurt members of your own pack.”
But Harry couldn’t leave—he found himself rooted to the spot as the girl trembled, curled up on the stone floor.
“What the bloody hell—” she hissed, grabbing his shoulder.
Draco huffed a laugh. Of course Potter would worm his way into Draco’s life, even in the middle of being asked out by someone else. He felt a pang of something—sadness, maybe, or regret. But here was an unexpected chance to be seen as something other than a former Death Eater, and this time perhaps he could be someone people actually liked.
Point being, the WWN couldn’t turn him down, but no one wanted to work with him either. So he’d been shunted to the night shift by a somewhat apologetic Lee Jordan, who now ran the network. But Draco was grateful—he harbored no illusion that he would have ever gotten the job without the influence of Lee’s fair judgement.
He awoke with a start. Sweat was plastered to his forehead. His harsh breaths cut through the silence. His body was beginning to ache, the full moon only a few days away. He flicked his wand.
“Nope, but I’d go for the beginning. Get it out of the way.” Lee stood, and Draco followed suit.
The white lace was splattered with sauce. Draco prepared himself for oblivion, and in a weak attempt to shift the blame, pointed towards the culprit.
“I thought so too,” Harry said, sitting down to eat. “It’s just—you know the wireless programme I listen to? I get… wolf feelings.”
” someone shouted, blasting a hole in the roof of the cellar. Bright moonlight shone inside, and the howls of the young wolves grew deafening.
“Thanks,” he murmured, taking a sip. “How’s the Sanctuary?” Luna and Neville maintained hundreds of acres of wilderness, one of the last few ancient forests not deforested by muggles since it was hidden by Morgana in the twelfth century. Brocéliande was another, Luna had explained to him, and was located in France.
“Darling, forgive me for saying so, but you don’t exactly have a sunny disposition.” She hummed, looking at it again. “Okay then, who’s Moony?”
is going on here?” Draco exploded. “Are you
Harry paused, waiting for Jenkins to reply. His ears strained for sounds of movement, anything other than the forest’s deadly calm. His head whipped around as a starling took flight overhead, setting his heart racing. The band heated.
(See the end of the chapter for
She smiled viciously. “Are you questioning my judgement?”
She tutted. “Don’t be ridiculous.”
Harry kisses him. It’s familiar, but at the same time completely new. He’s not suffocating the fire.
The one thing they knew very well was that there were upwards of twenty magical children hidden here, under the snow. For what purpose, Harry thought as his stomach twisted in disgust, they could only guess.
Harry bends to pick it up, only catching a glimpse of Draco’s smirk before he turns around.
“Want to try it?” Draco whispers, from way too close. Harry’s already starting to get heart palpitations.
“For all you insomniacs still awake at this hour,” he intoned, “my condolences.” In the other room, Jasmine rolled her eyes. She’d been assigned to keep an eye on him his first week on shift, but was more of a welcome distraction from the long night shift than an enforcement of the network’s standards. Perhaps this was because she was the only person Lee could think of at the WWN who didn’t seem to hate Draco’s guts.
“Smells good,” Harry said, moving past him to get plates down from the cupboard.
She looked at him, considering. “I need help picking the moonflowers before the next freeze.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “You’re not dying, mother.”
“Yes, but I get the feeling you don’t want to be our unicorn,” Ron said, nudging him with a shoulder.
Harry’s shoulders slumped. They needed to be harvested by the light of the full moon. Luna knew he was a werewolf, but ever since her time in the manor, she would occasionally…forget. Usually it was something small; telling a story she’d already told him the previous week, coming by to visit when he’d told her he would be on a mission.
Harry turned around abruptly and saw it among the cobblestones. He leapt towards it and took it in his mouth once more, the vibrations tickling his mouth, giving him the odd urge to sneeze. Suddenly gripped with exhaustion, he padded up the steps of Grimmauld Place. He tried weakly to open the door, but it wouldn’t budge. Just fucking great.
Ron lifted the bottle towards Harry. “I’d offer you one, but…”
Spine arching, vertebrae crackling one by one, Harry closed his eyes against the pain, allowing a small whimper—or was it a whine?—to escape from his elongating mouth. His teeth ached, their sharpness tender even as they drew blood from his lips. The ends of his fingers felt as though the nails were ripped out of their beds, replaced by claws curling, embedding themselves unwillingly into the faded Persian rug.
“Of course!” Harry said, sitting upright. It was obvious, really. “You could come.”
Draco didn’t understand why he needed to be here. Normally, the WWN were happy to let him skive off the meetings—he had no collaborations, and no one in the room save Jasmine and Lee were willing to come within six feet of him. He was tempted to announce very politely that the ex-Death Eater plague wasn’t catching, for Merlin’s sake. As it was, he was the recipient of several dark looks every time he so much as shifted in his chair. Over the years since the war, he’d come to learn that people didn’t tend to appreciate reminders of his existence.
She clasped her hands on the table. “Anyway, I wanted to tell you about the WWA.”
Something tight and wiggly lodges itself in Harry’s chest, and he can’t help but carefully step between the plants on the tiny curved paths Malfoy has walked, is walking. He smells the spindly flower because Malfoy is somewhere else now, partially obscured by the immense leaves of a creeping vine, suspended in midair. It smells sweet, like just after a rain shower or how nectar might taste to a hummingbird.
“How can I help yo—oh,” he says, mouth suddenly twitching in amusement. It’s not quite a smile, but Harry will take what he can get.
Lee waved a hand. “No need to worry about that.”
Harry inhaled sharply. He realized his hands were trembling and gripped the arm of the sofa to steady them.
“For a living?” Boot asked, incredulously.
“I am perfectly fine with that,” Draco said, around a mouth full of lentils.
Because there in the drawing room of the manor, on a centuries-old chaise, sat Harry Potter, his elbows resting on his knees, head in his hands. Potter’s head jerked up at Draco’s entrance, eyes widening in surprise. Draco felt the breath get knocked out of him a little.
“Oh, Draco!” Luna smiled. “I haven’t seen him in a few years—I’ll have to write him soon. How is he doing?”
“Thanks,” Harry said. He was well used to Luna’s creative approach to potion-making, which was enough to make Hermione flatly refuse her concoctions. Harry, on the other hand, had enough experience with her hangover cures to give him full confidence in the safety of her brews. Wolfsbane was a temperamental potion at best, but Luna had an intuition that worked well on most occasions. Harry vividly remembered one bottle of shampoo that had dyed his hair pink for weeks. Though now that he thought about it, that might have actually been the intended effect.
Draco sighed and crossed his arms, then felt ridiculous because they were walking down the street. He looked over at her suspiciously. “Is that a trick question?” he asked, uncrossing his arms.
“Elio—he’s the host of the nighttime programme—well, he airs ads sometimes. I can send one to him for you if you like.”
As the song faded into nothing, Elio’s voice came through again. “Speaking of life choices, I’ve been asked to announce a job opportunity. A lovely couple who enjoy moon gazing, also apparently known as mooning, are in search of a dog-sitter.”
Harry grinned. He wondered whether Hermione and Ron were listening.
Draco nearly dropped the parchment. Really, he shouldn’t have been so surprised, but he was. Someone was listening. Actually listening. He bit back a squeal.
“Is in more danger from other things than my association with you, as you well know. Besides,” he said. “I know nothing about galas. You’d be doing me a favor.” Few people were aware of this, but Narcissa was extremely generous once she deemed a person worthy of it. She also couldn’t resist a chance to be owed a favour.
He’d changed since then, anyway. Draco had been young, and stupid, and uncharacteristically optimistic—he had not yet learned that good things wouldn’t just come to him anymore, he’d have to crawl towards them, scrabbling for purchase on ever-shifting ground. It was embarrassing enough that he’d once considered Potter one of those good things.
“Yes,” Harry says. “To everything.”
“Now it does,” Lee said, and winked. “You must be doing something right.”
“Oh, that!” he said. “Well, you might be a smidge more tactful next time, but it’s nothing we weren’t all thinking,” he said warmly. “No, I need you for something else. Here, ” he said, passing Draco the parchment.
“The reason is that you’re an arsehole!” Pansy was yelling. “Draco, wait—”
Draco gets a letter.
He did love Queen. It wouldn’t be too much trouble to slip some in. He continued to read.
“Evidently the…dog…is quite naughty and has a tendency to wander the streets of London if left unsupervised. Unfortunately the pair will be…” there was the sound of a voice clearing, “
As for Harry, his directions were simple in theory, but incredibly tricky in practice. Find the children without alerting Rowle, Greyback, or any of the others. The aurors still knew very little about how well protected the place would be—it was Harry’s task to ascertain that also. The one thing they knew very well was that there were upwards of twenty magical children hidden here, under the snow.
as it swung from the strap between his teeth. Before long, he found himself aimlessly meandering through the streets of London, passing rats scurrying into the gutters, bits of trash blowing across the street, darkened windows, the eerie yellow light of streetlamps leaving reflections in day-old puddles. Eventually the houses began to look familiar again. Many had little potted plants on their porches, illuminated by the moon, which by now was barely visible over the roofs of the buildings.
Harry sat back against the settee, watching the last ray of sunlight disappear beneath the grand windowsill. Flames flickered, casting shadows around the darkening room. Soft orange light reflected onto Narcissa’s hair and illuminated her face. She really was a beautiful woman, Harry thought. That must have been where Malfoy got it from.
“Go ahead,” Harry gestured awkwardly towards it, suddenly extremely curious.
He took a step towards the girl, but was repelled by the wall of magic. Lifting his wand, he began unraveling the threads of the barrier between them. By now, several others—the ones who were conscious, at least—were crying out, though he could see no signs of a transformation yet. If he worked quickly there would be enough time.
Harry made his way over to Rose, feeling a little thrill as she opened her eyes to gaze up at him. “Would you like to hold her?” Hermione murmured, her braids slipping out from beneath her silk headscarf. Harry thought she looked good. Tired, but really really good. He nodded. “Yeah,” he said softly.
He trudged through the snow, feeling the warming and drying charms Jenkins had cast on him before his departure, her eyebrows raised in amusement, slipping away. Harry had never quite gotten the hang of spells designed to offer small comforts—a vestige of being unused to them for most of his life, he supposed.
Elio’s voice gently lilted, rose and fell, the crackle of the wireless the only indication he wasn’t whispering into Harry’s ear. Something in Harry’s chest curled up contentedly at the sound. He let the voice lull him, finally, into dreamless sleep.
They made their way to the back room where a small cauldron was hovering over a blue flame, steam rising above it in slow swirls.
Ernie bristled. “I don’t need your approval, Malfoy,” he spat.
For the people wondering,
He looks up through the flames.
A little while later, Rose was passed to Ron for a bit while Harry and Hermione saw to the dishes and brewed tea for each of them.
“Yes, I owe you, now get going,” she said, smiling as she shut the door in his face.
“Thanks, Draco,” Harry says.
“Had I the heavens’ embroidered cloths,” Elio was reciting, “Enwrought with golden and silver light…”
“Just about,” both Harry and Ron said, then laughed.
“Visit?” Robards barked. “You’re on mandatory leave!”
He is staring back.
Ron opened the fridge. “Okay, mate.” he said, pulling out a pack of sausages. “Here’s the deal. ‘Mione and I are running on about four hours of sleep between the two of us, so we’re gonna handle this like adults. You just tell us what happened, and we can figure out where to go from there, sound good?” With a jab of his wand, flames rose under the pan with the sausages, which shortly began to sizzle. He shot Harry a grin, grabbing several more eggs and cracking them into the bowl along with Hermione’s very whisked eggs. “But first, breakfast!” He summoned the whisk.
Goldstein smiled. “No, I think that honour lies perpetually with Harry,” he said.
And if that wasn’t the nicest thing anyone had said to him in years, he’d eat his umbrella.
“He was turned,” Goldstein said quietly. “But this is very confidential information—I only know because I work for Hermione, and I was there when she got the call.”
“Do you think Potter is a werewolf?” Draco said, staring up at the letter from his prone position on Pansy’s bed.
In December, there was an odd hush in the forest, tree trunks bare, leaves slick with ice. Murky clouds obscured the setting sun, the dimming light the only sign of the passage of time.
On a cloudy day, muted light filtering into the DAHM classroom, Harry chances a glance at Malfoy again.
“Woah,” he says.
“Wizarding Wireless Awards. They award programmes that are innovative, popular, or just have some sort of special niche.”
With a sinking feeling, he realized that not only was she bringing him along as some sort of personal cockblocker, she hadn’t told Boot he was coming. Pansy really bloody owed him.
Oh, Pansy was going to murder him. He looked around anxiously at all the lingerie before hurriedly snatching the letter enclosed in its beak. The owl looked up at him imploringly.
“Well, yes, but—”
Dark figures swept into the cellar, but in the chaos that ensued Harry couldn’t see their faces. He heard Jenkins shout a few metres away and narrowly dodged a streak of yellow light as he ran up the stairs, casting a hurried warming charm before setting the boy in the snow and turning back into the cellar.
CW: blood, injured children, face injury, imprisonment, death.
Harry breathed a sigh of relief.
Would you be interested in a Spotify playlist with all the songs in this fic? Let me know in the comments!
“Is this…” Draco whispers.
“Don’t you know how much worse that could have been?” Hermione was saying, viciously beating a pair of unfortunate eggs. “You could have been hurt! Or seen—by the press, I mean, since all our neighbours
Harry’s first transformation was lonely. If it weren’t so excruciating, he’d even consider it to be strangely peaceful.
“The muggle Queen is on the wireless?” Narcissa said.
“I was visiting Narcissa—”
“Were they reunited with their families?” Hermione asked.
“That much is obvious,” Draco said, annoyed. Well, so much for damage control. He could see Jasmine’s shoulders shaking out of the corner of his eye and suppressed a smirk.
Cries rose through the room as more children were waking up, both at the noise and the pain. “Contain them!” Harry heard a cloaked figure yell, but several were already bounding wildly across the room, crashing into aurors and enemy alike.
Harry starts from near sleep, the hood of his invisibility cloak slipping from his head. Draco is staring at him, looking distinctly unimpressed.
“Alright,” he grumbled, making his way to the kitchen. “Let’s see if we can find something in here that won’t kill you.” Wine was out of the question. Perhaps a bit of leftover pad thai?
“Not to me,” Harry says.
Malfoy’s jaw twitches. “I said,
It’s not like he was still clinging onto memories from school for Merlin’s sake; if anything it was a feeling—wanting to be close to someone, to mean something to them in a way not entirely covered by friendship, to be constantly and inexplicably amazed by them. He’d tried, in the years since, to find it with someone else, but every dinner, every walk in the park left him missing something.
Harry groaned. “In that case, he probably hates me.”
Molly always lamented that since Ron learned, he hadn’t come to Sunday dinners at the Burrow as often as he used to. Harry pretty much went where Ron and Hermione went, so he hadn’t been in a while either. To be fair, the events of the last few months hadn’t really put him in a sociable mood.
“Well, she is his mother,” Hermione said, reasonably.
But before he could say anything, Potter stood, gently kissing the back of his mother’s hand (
Rising on shaky legs, Harry moved to follow her, his thoughts whirring. Luna might be forgetful when it came to personal details, but her mind was sharp as ever when it came to brewing.
Luna smiled. “That would be lovely.” She sipped her tea and drew the shawl tighter around her shoulders. “And how are you, Harry? You seem quiet.”
They’d come for the children. Harry just needed to find them.
“It’s not that, exactly,” Harry said, fidgeting slightly. The truth was, he didn’t really want them to see him as a wolf. It was one thing for his friends to know he was one and another to see it firsthand.
If you'd like to read the poem as it was originally written, here it is:
“I invited him,” she said obtusely. It made Draco want to scream.
When he reaches the forest, he hesitates before going in. Peering in through the trees, it’s nearly pitch black.
“Look,” Harry said.
The poem is by W.B. Yeats, and you can find it
Something must have shown on his face, though, because Hermione set down the baby blanket and beckoned over to the space on the couch between her and Ron.
Harry sighed and settled in to listen.
It’s a gradual catharsis of a kind, even while something else winds itself up tighter, like a music box preparing to play for a long time.
She clasped her fingers over her knee and looked at him pointedly. “So you’ve finally come to visit your dying mother. I thought you’d forgotten all about me.”
“—so top off your tea, say a wish and a spell and a ‘Dear merlin thank you for Miles Davis’ and we’ll pop right on with it, shall we? Alright. Onto side two.”
Pansy, who had been rummaging in a drawer, paused and pulled out a silky green slip dress. “How should I know?” she said, chucking it on the bed where it landed on Draco’s face. “Whoops, sorry.”
They listened for a while. Narcissa was tapping her index finger on her knee, to Harry’s quiet amusement.
He closed the book, letting the silence linger on the air. He wondered if anyone was listening.
He approaches it invisibly, whispering a silencing spell so as not to disturb what is taking place. He almost can’t believe his eyes.
“Who like breakfast,” Ron said, sliding eggs and sausages onto three plates and sending them sailing through the air to land with a light bump on the table.
Something in Harry withered at that. Jenkins was the best partner he’d ever had—he looked up to her in a way he rarely did to anyone. But she had every right to hate him now. He was the reason she was here.
Draco opened his mouth in indignation. “I am perfectly capable of paying for myself,” he whispered, feeling Pansy’s eyes on him from across the table.
Draco’s shoulders slump, and well, Harry can’t have that. He moves to take another berry from the vine when Draco says, “Wait. Ask first.”
Draco smiles. “Yeah. You can take it now.”
“You want to spend time with me? Outside of work?”
He gingerly ripped some of the injera from the edge and grabbed some lamb stew with it. Sauce dripped down his fingers. He put it in his mouth, and moaned.
Soon, the patronus is no longer the only light filtering through the trees, and he lowers his wand. Out of the gloom, wisps of light seem to be swirling upwards in a small clearing. With a jolt, Harry recognizes which clearing it is.
He’s jittery now, though—he’s gotten what he wanted but only wants more of it.
Draco laughed. “She’s asleep half the time. But it’s fun to have her around.”
He said as much to Narcissa, who regarded him thoughtfully. Today her hair was loose, falling in smooth waves around her frail shoulders, which were wrapped in a lovely green shawl. She fingered it absentmindedly.
“Why come here then?” Ron said. “Our front step doesn’t seem all that comfortable.”
“Of course, Jor—sir.” Draco amended, suddenly unsure. He slowly sat back down in the swivel chair next to Lee’s, hands shaking with dread.
, he sent back.
“Well what do you suggest?” Hermione sniffed. “I could use the distraction, and it’s not like we can watch him every full moon…” she trailed off, a funny sort of smile on her face.
Draco turned to him with a sardonic smile. “Who am I going to tell? No one would believe me anyway.”
Fury rose up in him as a volley of spells made contact with other wolves nearby, and they collapsed to the ground. He deposited the injured pups on the ground, and whirled around, bounding across the snow to leap onto the woman responsible, her wand raised in defiance before they both toppled to the ground. Claws unsheathed, he ripped the side of her face.
,” he says, the brightness of the stag lighting the way forward in a way a simple
“Why would it be?” Boot said. “The only reason witches or wizards would need to live in their world is if they got themselves exiled from ours.”
Harry shifted his weight. “I just thought I’d visit—”
Harry spluttered. “It’s been six years!” He slumped in his seat, running a hand over his face. “I can’t believe he’s still putting that much effort into it.”
“We’ve already gotten at least ten offers,” she said exasperated, “which is frankly astounding since we could be anyone!”
There are some nights when he’s so exhausted there’s nothing he can do but sleep, but when he wakes in the dark his only thought is whether Draco is sleeping too, or out there alone.
It was only when he had told Hermione about it that she’d said simply, “Maybe you’re demiromantic.”
He’s walking the familiar path he’s traced with his eyes many times before, imagining the steps Malfoy might have taken minutes, maybe hours earlier. All the while he’s wondering alternately what they are doing in the forest, and what he’s doing following them in. It’s the place of his death, and yet something about them overcomes the dread and acute sorrow of the place.
Goldstein laughed, and it somehow made him look more attractive than he already was. “There’s a Ministry gala,” he said. “It’s dead boring, but lots of important people will be there.”
The gates dissolved to admit him; the wind calmed once he was inside the wards. He fixed his hair, brushing a bit of it to the side with his fingers. With his other hand, he fingered the soft wool shrunk in his pocket. The ebony double doors towered over him, creaking as they slowly opened.
“Oh,” Ron said. “Wait—ten?” He looked at her, a sly smile growing on his face.
Inside, all it said was:
Goldstein looked at him then with a fondness Draco didn’t understand. “Alright,” he said, sitting back against the booth.
Draco apparated onto the road to the manor, January wind buffeting his face. Grey clouds moved quickly and low overhead. He looked into the distance—really, it was less of a road and more a path, since muggles rarely ventured here with their automobiles. Though it was midday, there was still a dusting of frost on the ground. It crunched beneath Draco’s shoes as he walked on the tufts of frozen grass, hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched against the cold. He needed to buy warmer robes, but he knew he couldn’t afford them.
Hermione wrapped a gentle arm around him, and he tucked his nose into her hair. She didn’t seem to mind. He just sat, and breathed, and stared at nothing in particular for a long time.
“I don’t think so, why?” she said, spearing a carrot with her fork. “As far as I’m aware, a pack is just an extension of your existing social bonds.”
That’s—” He was about to say ‘ridiculous’, then paused. No one knew who Elio really was. As long as he was careful to protect the secret, he could be judged on his own merit. After years of his job applications being mysteriously “lost” in wizarding establishments, it was a strange feeling.
Seeing Potter again broke a dam in Draco’s mind, which pissed him off, as it had been very meticulously constructed. Over the last six years, he’d subconsciously tucked all his thoughts on the man carefully away like old clothes gently folded, never to be worn again.
Draco took a moment to look around. The restaurant was homey, with photos of people he presumed were family on the orange walls, as well as one he could see of a younger Senalat. They smiled and waved from inside their frames. A few other patrons were scattered around the room, some sitting on cushions near low tables while others sat in chairs, talking quietly.
see—which frankly would have been a disaster, or hit by a car—”
The door opened. “Oh, bloody hell,” Ron said, before bursting into laughter.
“Accio,” Hermione said, flicking her wand, and the letter soared into her hand. “Moony?” she said, glancing at the envelope. “Isn’t that the name we—”
So Draco was the only one in the dark. He scowled at Pansy, who was avoiding his eyes. She took a sip from her glass of wine, which definitely hadn’t been there two seconds ago.
“How did you know I was here?” Harry rubs the back of his neck sheepishly. It’s aching now, after falling in a strange position against a tree.
Discovering he was demi had shed a lot of light on his past romantic disasters. In school he’d been too busy trying not to die to figure out who he liked in that way. In retrospect, it was pretty clear that he’d had no romantic feelings for Cho. With Ginny, it was only once she’d become his friend that he’d started to feel something else. But even then, the looming spectre of the war clouded over his memory.
Inside it was surprisingly warm. Draco swept his outer robes off his shoulders, hanging them on the hook, and strode towards the drawing room.
It wasn’t even that funny, really, but suddenly Harry couldn’t stop. It was as if all the moments of his life were revealed to be side acts in the stupidest play ever written. Narcissa was incapacitated with it now, shrieking with laughter, looking freer than he’d ever seen her. Something sparkled in the low light.
For the second time in five minutes, Draco resisted the urge to scream in frustration. The last time his mother had visited the flat, she’d looked down her nose at everything in his life until, out of sheer irritation, he’d asked her to leave.
“Oh, Harry,” she said, sighing. “I know he’s not. But if he is, he’s really missing out, you know that?”
Goldstein rolled his eyes. “He’s a tough one sometimes, but his heart is in the right place. He really does like Pansy, though.”
“Well? What did he say?” Hermione prompted.
“So,” Goldstein said, looking at Boot, who was scowling at the table. “How’s the situation at the hospital?”
Hermione frowned, tilting her head. “Do you hear that?”
Then when they are done tending to the plants, under the soft blanket of a warming charm, they tend to each other in the dark. Harry’s holding back though, made-up visions of flames engulfing the little white flowers enough to make him wary of letting go of too much of himself. He’s been in his own mind—he knows he’s overwhelming.
Harry opens his mouth in outrage. “I do not—”
Jenkins was usually happy enough to offer them, and today was no different, apart from the unusually somber atmosphere in the department. Hardly anyone said a word as they went about silently brewing tea, shrugging on their winter robes, the most junior aurors whispering practiced spells to themselves. Jenkins, who usually lightened up the room before a raid, only sent Harry a weak smile in response to his thanks.
The wireless. He paused, ears drooping in grief. The days leading up to his transformation had been full of memories of Remus. His thoughts had wandered more than usual to the year when they had first met—Harry only thirteen when Remus taught him to conjure the patronus that had once saved Sirius’s life.
“Haven’t you ever heard of babysi—”
“I see,” she said. She twirled her wand between her fingers. “Perhaps—”
“True enough,” said Boot. “I mean, look at what happened to Potter—”
Harry smiled, wishing for not the first time that he didn’t have to transform tonight.
“And you’ll let me know if you need anything?” Lee said, extending a hand.
Everything is glowing—each species of plant in the garden has its own shade, or sometimes multiple. Even the trees around them are emitting a faint red glow. The spindly flower on the floating vine is so bright Harry sees spots for a while after looking at it. Flashes of color move between the trees in the distance, little dots of light scurry around the tree leaves above. Suddenly the world is moving around him and he gingerly lowers himself to the ground before he has the chance to fall over.
“An… ad?” Draco said, brows furrowing.
She turned to him, smirking. “Who’s Elio?”
, Jenkins said.
She laughed lightly, a sound that seemed to warm the room by several degrees. “Not quite who I had in mind,” she said. “Was that an invitation?” She raised a light brow.
Harry’s hand reaches out before he can stop himself. “What are you doing?” he cries.
He paused, taking a deep breath. This part always seemed to touch him in a raw place. “Practices loneliness, as a virtue. A single specious need to keep what you have never really had.”
Draco laughed. Doubtful.
“Please sir. Just to apologize.” He pushed his glasses up his nose.
She leaned towards him, and said in her quiet voice, “Some things are less complicated than we imagine them to be. Often the simplest explanation is the right one.”
Draco sighed, moving it to the side. “I don’t know,” he said. “This letter… I get the feeling it’s from him.”
It’s the most peaceful place he’s ever been, he thinks. More than the white train station in the vision where he’d chosen to live, more than his parent’s graves in Godric Hollow, where he visited nearly every day in the summer until he got sick of wishing for things that would never happen. More than the feeling of submerging himself in the prefect’s bath, soap bubbles rising above him as he contemplates whether he’d like to come back up again. Out of the warm water and into the cold.
Harry looks up, and his heart stutters when he can’t see Malfoy—but there they are, bent over next to a fresh patch of earth. Their wand is pointed at the soil, moving in gentle swirling motions. Soon enough, three tiny green sprouts emerge. The smile on Malfoy’s face nearly makes Harry forget about the garden altogether.
It’s a flame.
“So,” Lee said, pulling a roll of parchment out of his bag. Were those termination papers? Fuckity fuck.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What about this do you not understand? Jenkins doesn’t want to see you.”
The only sound in the room is ink dripping onto the floor. There is an unreadable expression on her face.
“Potter’s already here, darling.” Narcissa said, blinking. Potter smiled and gave a jaunty little wave.
“I think Hermione would appreciate your perspective, and… well. I’d like to see you again.”
“Is there anything I can do?” Harry asked. He was getting a bit stir-crazy being inside Grimmauld Place so much.
Draco shook it. “Of course,” he said. “Thanks.”
“A unicorn, Harry? Really?” Hermione paused her knitting.
“No one will be suspicious,” she said.
For once Draco was glad for the cold, because it never failed to turn his face pink. The sudden onslaught of compliments made no difference to the state of it.
Elio was still speaking. “We’ve received a request for Queen—” Harry’s stomach swooped.
But as he turned to the stairs once again, his eyes met Rowle’s in the darkness. As if in slow motion, Harry saw his wand raise and in a split second, turned to shield the girl with his body from a black streak of light heading straight towards them.
“It’s almost done,” Luna said. “I’ve added a bit of willow extract to help with the pain.”
“Only beginning?” Hermione teased.
“He’d need a wand,” she pointed out. Ron shrugged and said, “This wouldn’t be the first time Harry’s done something impossible, would it?”
“And he is being appropriately thankful for it, especially considering I only did it for you. At least he visits me.”
Harry gritted his teeth and tried to stand, but stumbled to the ground once again. The wolf in his arms yelped, and as Harry felt the tendrils of unconsciousness creep in, there was a weak bite on his hand, barely breaking the skin.
, he thinks.
“Nest?” Draco says, looking up at him. They look at each other for a second too long, before his eyes flick upward and he actually laughs.
It was embarrassing enough that he found the fucking song.
He stands in the rain, watching as droplets pool in the flowers that are white in the dim light of day, and thinks about the world in which he’d chosen differently, and he’s not here to see them.
“You could have taken muggle studies,” Boot said coldly.
Harry looks up at the moon. It’s almost full. It looks close enough to touch; he thinks he can see Draco’s face in it. He looks down. The magic of the invisibility cloak is itself invisible. His body, partially covered by the cloak, ripples in the darkness.
“Darling, I’m hooo—” Pansy sang, but stopped dead at the sight of him. The record spun on the shelf.
“...neighbours called...something about a naked man on our doorstep?”
“I can hear you, you know,” Harry sang, picking lightly at the lace trim on the dressing gown, begrudgingly enjoying the feel of the satin on his skin. He smiled as Hermione rolled her eyes, drawing her robe more tightly around her as she stalked out of the room.
There was no way Goldstein looked like this in school, or Draco would have noticed, no matter how obsessed Pansy thought he’d been with Potter.
“What are you doing here?”
“How could I not?” Draco says incredulously. “You snore like a hippogriff.”
Harry shrugged. “I saw Malfoy,” he said.
“…loved that album since I first heard it. To me it’s perfect for a wintry night, or at least a rainy one. With only a few minutes left in the hour, I’d like to read a poem for you by Amiri Baraka. It’s called ‘As a possible lover’.
“What a pleasant surprise,” she said, not at all pleasantly. “I haven’t seen you in weeks.” Draco flushed. Yes, that was technically true, but he’d been busy doing… things.
“It’s the plants,” they say, taking hold of his hand again. The world is buzzing around them. “Come on.”
Harry laughed.
“He saved your life,” she said reproachfully. “Shouldn’t you be more grateful?”
Draco felt his face heat in mortification. “Do you,” he said stiffly, and the table dissolved into an awkward silence.
“No—Ron,” she said through giggles, “not actual unicorns. People.”
is your problem?”
“Harry,” he said quietly, suddenly serious. “Are you alright? You know, after—”
Narcissa simply smiled. “Now would be the perfect opportunity to make their debut.”
It was getting chilly out in the wind, and Harry decided he couldn’t just stay here. He walked down the street, wireless still playing the last of
The sofa beckoned him, and he slowly moved to sit on one end, breaking the seal on the envelope, his peripheral vision still trained on the owl which was now hopping towards him, and—
She fixed him with a concerned look, which morphed to outrage as it slipped to the nearly empty takeout container on the coffee table, noodles strewn everywhere. Draco winced.
Harry smiled, letting himself get lost in the repetitive, almost meditative quality of the music.
Harry stood, making his way to lean against the counter. “Need any help?” he asked, peering at the sausages.
Ron gestured towards him, flapping a hand. “Then why is your face doing… that?”
suspicious, but knew better than to say so.
“No,” she had said fondly. “We’re not.”
“Harry!” Hermione exclaimed, quickly moving to cover her eyes.
Then, another slip of paper fell out, and when Draco read it, he couldn’t help but smile.
“You said it yourself back then, mate, maybe he’s avoiding you.”
“Sure,” Harry said. “I fell asleep at one point, even.” He turned his gaze back to Rose, whose tongue poked out of her mouth.
He glanced through the glass into the other room, and saw that Jasmine had conjured a plush orange velvet sofa, upon which she was softly snoring. Trust Miles Davis to lull her to sleep. Draco on the other hand couldn’t sleep to music—it was too interesting. It occupied his mind too much to permit the tendrils of sleep to slip in.
“Ah,” Senalat said, ushering them to a table. “And how is that man of yours?”
“Pretty sure it’s not just muggles, Ron.” Harry shook his head lightly. Ron sidled up to him, bumping their shoulders together.
Draco’s glow is still vaguely purple, but not so much that when they turn their face towards him in apology, Harry can’t see the way they’re looking at him still. Silent and burning.
“How come?” Harry asked, troubled. Luna always described the forest as sentient, but she’d had no cause for concern since it first passed into her hands.
“Sorry?” is all he can think of to say. All he can notice is that her eyelashes seem longer than usual.
Wait, what?
Harry feels his face heat, but he has to check. “Which one?”
Just as Harry puts the second berry on his tongue, the first one hits. Colours filter in from the corner of his vision until he’s squinting at the brightness. Draco seems to be undergoing the same predicament.
“What if he is?” Harry whispered, resting his head on her shoulder.
“If,” she said, smirking, “you appear to have an entirely different reason for attending.”
“I need you to read it during your shift. They asked for it to air at night, specifically. Apparently it’s an overnight job, and they need someone awake for it.”
“You are being unreasonably stupid,” they say as they pull him by the elbow across the grounds, “even for you.”
Harry can’t bring himself to look away. No one else seems to notice. He looks down. His bowtruckle is nowhere to be seen.
“I’ve been thinking,” Hermione said, sitting down on the sofa next to Ron. Harry situated himself in a cosy armchair he’d helped Hermione pick out from an estate sale. Helping, in this case, had involved Harry trying on about thirty ridiculous hats with various feather arrangements while Hermione occasionally asked him for his opinion on the furniture.
Hermione was already at the dining table, setting some silverware at their usual places. “Hi Harry,” she said, giving him a quick peck on the cheek as he set the plates down. “Everything ready?”
Harry huffed a laugh and closed his eyes. He could make out muffled footsteps and the soft sound of voices from inside.
“There you go, honey,” she said, grasping his shoulder with a smile. “Enjoy.”
Draco’s shaking his head now. “Is that what you want?”
“I’m well aware, thank you.” he said tersely.
“Would you like to go? With me, I mean.” Goldstein shifted his weight, the only indication he wasn’t completely at ease.
?” Boot said in a harsh whisper as she sat next to him. Draco took the empty side across from them, suddenly dreading the next hour and a half.
. I’m sure my regulars have heard me say so far too many times, so if you have suggestions for how to change it up feel free to send them my way.
Everything after that was a blur of light and pain and unbridled rage. Snatches of human-like lucidity fought with the wolf inside him as he knocked Rowle to the ground, before gently lifting the pup in his mouth and dragging her body outside. By now, wolves were streaming out of the ceiling of the cellar into the snow, chains hanging uselessly from the pups who snapped at anyone within reach, some still bleeding profusely.
