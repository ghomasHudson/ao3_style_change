“Draco.” Harry met his eyes and held them, knowing, somehow, that whatever it was Malfoy wanted to say was infinitely important.
“When did you have the time to transfigure yourself into a snail, Malfoy?” Potter quipped, with no bite behind it. “Keep up.”
Harry smiled, winding his arms around Draco’s waist and rising up to pull Draco in, holding him close. He could feel Draco relaxing into him, their chests pressing together, Draco’s arms slowly moving to hold him back.
him, as if he’d already thought this all through and decided it wasn’t worth it. How could it not be worth it? It was his
something,” Malfoy said forcefully, “It’s impossible. It’s one of those crazy cures like eating a dragon heart. It might work, but I can’t actually–”
Of course Harry understood. It was what Dumbledore had said to him all those years ago– the difference between being forced to fight someone and walking in there willingly with your head held high, the difference between letting something take you somewhere and choosing to go there yourself.
“Okay,” Harry agreed immediately, feeling extremely selfish for the little spark of happiness this kindled in his heart. How one-track-minded could he be? He had no place thinking about himself right now, not when they were thinking about Malfoy’s
“Draco.” He reached for Draco’s hand, pulling it away from Draco’s face. He thought his heart might burst out of his chest, it was so big. “I do. Merlin, I do. I love you–” saying the words themselves left him breathless and strange-feeling inside. He said it again. “I love you.”
Harry drew back and looked at him– his pale chest, now with normal coloured veins, unhealthily thin; his scraggly blond hair and red-rimmed grey eyes, the tired, jerky way he moved to sit back against the wall. His wrist had faded.
Harry located the little bag, pulling open the drawstring loop and then dumping the entire contents onto the floor, a ticking clock pounding in his chest as Malfoy’s eyes fluttered shut again. It turned out to be a veritable
“What, do you think that there will be a cure? That you won’t be the last Death Eater, the last Eaten?” He flung a Cruciatus Curse that he barely missed. “The only cure is something that you’ll never have! No one could ever love you, Draco Malfoy! No one!”
His perfect mouth dropped open at Draco’s words. “Do you seriously think I care about that?” Potter demanded.
The thought of true love, something the other Eaten had never taunted him with, slowed him down. It was small, by a fraction, but it obviously meant something.
“No,” Malfoy said, sitting straighter and reaching for the buttons on his shirt, “but the look on your face was.”
Draco recognized the two as Dolohov and Yates, and he scowled. Of course they would be the last ones. They had been very loyal followers of Voldemort.
A disturbing look crossed Malfoy’s face, a strange hybrid of disappointment and horror. “I’m alive?” He said this so faintly, Harry had to strain to hear it. “I was hoping…”
“Hi,” Harry whispered, his chest tight, “You’re okay. You’re safe, I’ve got you.” He ran a hand through Malfoy’s hair, pushing it off his forehead, suppressing the urge to kiss him there, lightly.
His legs ached as he walked, and Draco mentally prepared himself for the battle that would ensue when they found the Eaten. It would tire his already exhausted body out. It took a lot out of him to keep himself from turning into one of the Eaten, and he had gotten more and more ill over the last few months. It was impressive that he could still walk. “Who would you even settle down with? You broke up with Weasley.”
It took barely a moment to set the tent, scooping Malfoy up in his arms and carrying him in. His heart cracked as he felt the cold of Malfoy’s skin, the light weight of his body, so frail and weak, fighting so desperately against the curse of a soul not his, against a kind of dark magic they’d never seen before– not even Harry, though he’d lived with Voldemort’s soul in him for his entire life up until a year ago that seemed a lifetime away.
He laughed, a quick sound that was over before it even started. It was still a beautiful sound. “Maybe. I don’t know. I think I’m tired of fighting. Maybe I’ll settle down.”
Malfoy. Malfoy laughing at Harry, Malfoy hexing Hermione, Malfoy's sneering face, Malfoy on the astronomy tower pointing his wand at Dumbledore. Harry cried out quietly and opened his eyes again just to find that his eyes started to fill with water. How would he ever explain this to Malfoy? Harry liked Malfoy, but how could he
"I thought tomorrow we could go to Flourish and Blotts, I would like to buy a few new books." Hermione suggested as Ron's Rook got destroyed.
"Of course I care! Why do you think I slept in front of the bloody hospital doors two nights in a row just to be the first see him? Why do you think did I brought food up there in case he will wake up? Ah, right! I'm Draco Malfoy, I have no feelings and things as love and friendship are nkt in my vocabulary! But should I tell you something? You lot are not better! You don't know me! You know nothing about me! So leave me alone! And if you would really love your best friend, accept his love for me, you stupid bastard!", Draco shouted and turned around to leave.
That seemed to twist something inside the Hufflepuff. She looked up at Harry with big eyes. "But you have a family?"
Harry didn't resist as Draco twisted Harry's hands behind his back, crossing his wrists together and holding them tightly.
Malfoy pulled away and they both stared at each other. Suddenly, Harry's heart was hammering against his chest and he had a really strange feeling about all this. They both hushed into their beds. Harry stared against the ceiling.
"You know, Potter, I came up here to visit you. It's short after midnight and were kissing on your hospital bed. I think there could be a bit more grovelling from you, because I'm freezing a lot.", Draco said.
. From the minute they had entered the pub to the minute Potter let Draco take off with his leather jacket. Draco sighed. He couldn't quite wrap his head around what had happened in the diner and why. Why had Potter been so nice? Why hadn't Draco stormed off? He guessed it was the slight intoxication of both of them. And to be honest, Draco was too tired to figure it out.
He pulled out a pack of cigarettes, lit one with his wand and put the pack back in his pocket. Harry watched Malfoy's lips sucking at the cigarette and saw that Malfoy's hands were trembling. At a closer look Harry could see that Malfoy's whole body was trembling. No wonder he was cold, he only wore a T-shirt. So Harry took off his leather jacket and held it towards Malfoy who looked at it, then at Harry. Harry rolled his eyes.
"Potter!" Draco shouted when he walked outside to the greenhouses, where they were going to have herbology in a few minutes. "Potter!" Draco shouted again, hoping Potter was actually there. Otherwise he would be only another idiot looking for the fantastic Harry Potter.
"He wasn't a murderer. You need to know, my parents were good friends with him, so they made him my godfather. And then there was Peter Pettigrew. I think you know him."
Draco lay in bed staring at the light coming from his window. Pansy had left only a few hours ago and Draco hoped she wouldn't come back any time soon.He needed to talk to Theo and he was going to do it tomorrow. Today he was too tired to do anything.
"Hey.", Harry said. Draco looked up, then back down without saying a word. Harry nodded and pulled off his shirt.
Harry smiled and sneaked away from the door. The kitchen was filled with chattering and squealing girls, talking all over each other. Harry put a finger in each of his ears and walked outside again. No one was there. The tents were empty, no one was visible in the darkness. Harry furrowed his brow. When he went back inside to ask the girls in the kitchen, he stopped. The chatter had disappeared, the kitchen was empty. Harry looked around and hurried upstairs. Without knocking, he stormed into the room Draco and Teddy have been in just a minute ago but it, too, was empty. Panic filled Harry up as he ran downstairs. He checked the clock in the living room. Ten minutes until midnight. This was like a nightmare. Where was everyone?
They were followed by Dean and Neville and ran up the spiral staircase to the boy's dormitory and stopped in the doorframe. Harry had to look at this room for one last time, next year none of them would sleep in here anymore. He took in every detail of the room, so the memory would live in his head for years and years to come. Then finally, the boys jumped on each of their beds and whipped out their wands. Harry carefully carved in his full name -
Longbottom checked the clock in the common room and nodded. "At this time it would be very unusual for them to not be having breakfast."
"Harry, just forget it, okay? I mean, let's just have a nice last day before we leave, please.", Hermione begged. Harry sighed defeated.
He sat down on the couch in the living room and saw that Theo was cooking dinner - with magic of course. Blaise and Theo sat down each next to Draco.
"As if you haven't got enough to worry about at the time, Potter.", he said with a roll of his eyes.
At the table where Harry always sat, sat the one person Harry had been looking for. And now when he wanted to be alone, he found him. Malfoy looked up.
At first Draco had thought it would have been the alcohol inside of them speaking, but when he had written that letter to Potter if they would meet again, he'd been quite sober. And Draco thought about how hurt Potter had looked when Draco had told him he only wanted to give him back his jacket even though he
Cradling Teddy in his arms, Harry made his way back downstairs into the living room, where his friends sat. They asked Harry about what had happened in hushed whispers and Harry told them.
Draco smiled as Potter keeled down next to one elf and talked to him. He looked up and found Draco's gaze. Draco looked away and blushed.
Draco looked up. He knew Theo just said that to provoke him, but - Draco had to admit - it worked. He shot Theo a questioning look.
It would be the easiest if Draco would just stay away from them until their coming-out cooled down a bit.
"I don't know. I was bored and I didn't know what Malfoy had in mind when he asked me to follow him."
"I... I'm sorry.", Harry said. He felt shame rising up inside him because he hadn't taken that much of time. Draco let out a small laugh.
Harry and Ron had stopped by McGonagall before they had left the castle and went down to the train in the dark. The Hogwarts Express drove back to London only for them - that was the benefit of being the savior of the Wizarding World. The two boys have fallen asleep during the ride and woke up just before they arrived at platform 9¾. The rest of the drive home was a silent one - only the radio was playing, but neither Harry nor Ron were in the mood to talk. They went straight to bed as they arrived at home, but Harry didn't fall asleep until about two hours later.
"Yeah, they may hate you a little, but I swear to Merlin, they would pull themselves together for me."
"I can't believe he wants to fight you," Hermione said. Well, Hermione probably wasn't really thinking about if this was a lie or not, Harry suspected she was blinded by her worry about Harry.
He didn't need to apologise or anything. He just walked away. Blaise has known Draco long enough to know that Draco would never apologise for anything and if he did, something was terribly wrong.
"We'll see you!", Hermione said loudly as they stepped out in the darkness. Harry and Draco waved after them- mostly it was Harry who waved- and then closed the door.
It was quiet for a long time and Harry really, really wanted to sleep, but something was bothering him.
It was the only place in the castle he knew he could be sleeping at. And you had entertainment. But even with this whole equipment stuff, Draco felt somehow not completed.
"What?", he snapped at the red haired boy who came running towards him. As Weasley came to a halt next to him, he stemmed his hands on his knees and breathed heavily.
When Harry pulled back, he had to take a deep breath so he wouldn't hyperventilate. Malfoy smiled. It was a real, big smile that lay on his lips. Harry couldn't resist and kissed the bloke again.
"What do you think about that?", she asked and cut Harry out of his dreams about his roommate. Harry looked at her.
"I know, right!" None other than Draco Malfoy said and caught for air, "He looked like he was going to drop dead!"
Harry felt something burning up inside him. He wasn't sure if it was anger or sadness but surely, the tears rolled down his face and Harry gasped for air. He was so frustrated, Harry had to scream. He screamed, breathed in and screamed more, breathed in and cried. When his throat was sore, Harry stopped screaming and coughed, but the tears kept coming.
Harry walked slower and then, he came to a halt. Malfoy sat on the edge of the lake, levitating small pebbles into the nearly frozen water. He had his back turned at Harry, but Harry knew Malfoy wasn't smiling. Malfoy's hair was shining slightly in the dim moonlight. He hadn't noticed Harry yet, so Harry silently walked closer. Just behind Malfoy, he took the cloak off and sat down next to the Slytherin. Malfoy looked at Harry.
The train would leave in ten minutes. Potter had promised his friends that he was going to bring them to the station.
Harry noticed that Ron and Hermione shared a weird look and Harry guessed it was because of Malfoy. Sure, it was kind of weird having Malfoy sitting here and having breakfast with them, but he didn't do anything wrong right now, he didn't even say
"What table do you like then?", he asked. Draco looked around and pointed on a table made out of dark wood. Its legs were thin and the surface was smooth. High-quality.
Draco took the last step then, and tipped his head so their lips met softly, lightly. Harry then suddenly pushed Draco against the mattress and closed the distance between them quickly, hungrily now, as they both felt that need swell in their chests, a void begging to be filled.
They used the Floo network straight to Malfoy Manor where Draco's mother was already waiting for them. To Draco she looked as beautiful as ever, despite her tired eyes. Her hair was up in a tight bun and she wore shimmering black robes. Draco appreciated the familiar cold air in the Manor.
Malfoy made a step back and hit the wall. Harry's heart started hammering against his ribs, he wouldn't be surprised if Malfoy heard it beating. He was going to say no. Of course. Harry had known it! Why was he even stupid enough to ask him?
They were now very close but not that close that they were in each other's space. Harry watched Malfoy's rapidly rising and falling chest and wondered why his own breathing wasn't as fast.
"My good friend Neville, you might have seen him around, lives with his grandmother as well. In fact, he has lived with her ever since I've known him." Harry said, "And I am sure you will be able live with them for just as long, if not longer. Some day you will be all grown up and stronger and you will be able to live on your own, however you want to live."
After Draco had finished, he noticed that he forgot his pyjama outside. Well or badly he had to go out there with only a towel on.
Ron didn't wait for anyone to say something, he just stormed out of the library. Hermione jumped from her chair and followed him. Harry and Neville glanced at the left-behind boy. He seemed appropriately scared as Harry and his friend stepped closer to the table he sat at.
Harry nodded wordlessly. This was neither the time nor the place to discuss this, so he decided not to say anything at all. Malfoy nodded too, but still looked suspicious. Harry tried not to think about anything until they touched the ground again. He didn't say a word as they walked back to the terrace, where Narcissa didn't sit anymore. He also didn't say a word as they walked upstairs or as Draco showed him where the bathroom was, so he could take a shower. In the shower, Harry wondered if he should tell Draco about his thoughts and his dreams.
It was the first time they kissed in front of people other than their closest friends. Everyone got up and cheered and clapped, what made Harry smile against Draco's lips. They were now husbands and it was the most wonderful feeling he has ever felt. Hermione handed Harry his godson and he and Draco held him together as they posed for a picture that Colin's little brother Dennis Creevey took. Harry and Draco left the Great Hall hand in hand. Excitement rushed through Harry. He didn't know he held his breath until the doors closed behind them.
"Then I think it's good. The most important thing is that you're happy.", she continued and forced a smile.
"Um, Harry, I think you should go there.", Ron said, pointing towards Draco, who was shouting at Parkinson.
Harry's face reddened and George and Ron laughed. It was good to see that Draco could joke about this. They have somehow convinced George that he did need help and spent the day helping out in the shop.
"I don't know, Harry. Do you really think it's a good idea to be with his father when he learns that his son is dating his former enemy?", Ron asked and furrowed his brow.
"Listen. None of us are perfect and we all have our doubts sometimes. But Harry loves you, I know it. I see the way he looks at you - it's how I would have wished for him to look at my daughter." Mrs Weasley said.
Harry smiled and left. He wasn't actually tired, he just had enough of not enjoying a night out with his friends. And frankly he'd been there for long enough.
Harry nodded. They were both right and they still were back at the beginning. Harry still didn't know if he should go and Malfoy would be coming back in four days, so he had to decide quickly.
Everyone cheered and clapped and Harry figured that must have been enough, but as he turned around he saw McGonagall  shaking her head. Harry sighed. If he was going to do this, he was going to do this right.
The girls groaned annoyed and left. Harry looked at Ginny gratefully and she smiled. This was the moment Harry decided that he would definitely invite her to his birthday.
At the peak of the party - when everyone was just the right amount of drunk - they played songs so loud the neighbors must have heard it through the silencing charms all around the building. Harry talked to a lot of the people at the party - drunk people seemed to be getting along better than sober people. Harry and Draco danced to the music and somewhat around that time, they stood in the corner making out. Malfoy tasted like firewhisky, but Harry loved it. The first time they had kissed in front of the people at the party, a lot of them cheered and clapped and Malfoy smiled into the kiss, what made Harry feel tingly.
"Tell me about those Muggles.", Malfoy said quietly. Harry froze. From where did he know about the Dursleys? As though Malfoy could read his mind, he said:
"Shut it, Potter. I pulled myself together all evening." Malfoy answered and lit the cigarette between his lips.
As the girls had seen who they had actually hit, they ran away. Potter lay on the floor, his eyes closed and he was shaking slightly. Draco's heart beat loudly.
"Now, your money.", he said and the others put their hands in their pockets and pulled out coins. Harry looked at them quizzical.
But Draco rolled back on top of Harry and kissed him. Harry smiled against Draco's lips and put his arms around Draco's torso, pulling him closer. Draco grinned.
Several women were in the store, some were employees and some were shopping. A very beautiful Asian employee came towards them, swinging her long black hair. Her smile made Ron blush.
"You heard me right, Potter. I said I'll come.", he answered and before Harry asked why, Draco added: "Always time for you, darling."
"Your hair looks nice, Draco.", he said. Draco turned around and faced Harry. Their noses almost touched.
"Why did you never tell me you could paint?", Harry asked and sat down next to Draco on the couch, showing him the pictures.
When Hermione saw that everyone else was engaged in an activity, she asked Harry if he would sit down with her, but Harry watched Malfoy slowly leaving the common room.
"You know how I was raised." Draco finally said after what felt like hours, "My parents were strict, my aunt was at Azkaban. Let's just say I didn't have a very easy childhood, I guess kind of like you. That's maybe also why I was such a jerk, I needed this to make myself feel superior."
"You... she leaned in and you laughed and you were happy without me!" Draco sounded angry, but Harry was sure he was sad also.
"What was going on out there?" Malfoy asked, "I heard you shout." He put away his Quidditch magazine.
Harry shook his head. And now Draco was vanished. Just gone. No one had seen him and Harry had no idea where he was.
They sat and drank and talked for hours. At around eleven, something coming from Potter was ringing really annoyingly.
"Man, it's so great you're here!" Theo said, his words as unclear as Harry's and he clapped Harry on the shoulder.
Draco went to the bathroom, where he took a shower while Harry picked up his fresh clothes. He stepped in the shower the moment Draco came out.
. He had actually told him. And what he had told him... Harry couldn't believe it. He had never known Malfoy felt like this. He had thought Malfoy was just an angry little boy. But now he actually showed Harry who he really was: sad and misunderstood and raised wrong. Harry felt sad and wanted Malfoy to feel better. He didn't deserve to feel like this, he didn't deserve to be treated like shit. Harry knew that now and he suddenly regretted everything he had ever done to Malfoy. Okay maybe not everything, but a lot. Because Malfoy never meant anything by it, he just didn't know it was wrong what he was saying or doing. Harry reflected everything Malfoy had said against muggle born and against the Weasleys and against Dean and Seamus. How could he have never seen this? Harry knew Malfoy's father was a prick and Harry knew Malfoy's mother wasn't pleasant either. How could he have been so blind?
"You can't do anything against it." Malfoy said and Harry could have killed him, but instead he said:
"I couldn't talk to her, she wasn't conscious. So not great." Malfoy answered and Harry already heard the cold tone in his voice.
He'd just kissed Harry Potter! This was madness, absolute madness! Draco felt horrible - like he'd betrayed the trust of his father. Draco felt like he just ignored and besmirched everything he had ever been taught. Draco looked at the floor and his eyes fell on the socks he was wearing.
Draco Malfoy might have lost his confidence for a moment while Voldemort had been there, but it definitely was back at all strength now. He knew what he wanted and he wasn't too afraid to show Harry. Being pulled close by Malfoy, everything inside Harry felt upside down. He started sweating but didn't want to catch his breath, too afraid he would have to let go of Malfoy's lips.
Potter's grip on Draco's arse intensified, his hands pulling Draco close enough he could feel that Potter's cock wasn't immune to Draco's ministrations.
"If you have to choose between life and death, you would choose life, even if you have to do horrible things. But you want to protect yourself and your family." Draco said and Harry noticed that his hands were shaking under the table, "And I wanted to protect my family."
"So...", Granger said and rubbed her palms together. Draco saw that she was pretty uncomfortable with the situation and he smirked. Mission accomplished.
Harry smiled and had a strange feeling in his stomach. Narcissa turned the page again. In one picture, Draco stood at platform 9 3/4 and looked very proud. Harry smiled again.
Draco stood up and fixed his wand at the wall. He could feel Potter's warm breath in his neck and a shiver went down his spine. Draco smiled and closed his eyes.
magazine again. He looked through it again and as he still didn't find anything interesting, he stopped at a quiz on what colour suits you the most. Harry rolled his eyes, but bored as he was, he took the quiz. A few minutes later he found out that apparently dark red and dark blue would suit him the most. He sighed and put the magazine away.
On this Sunday, Draco didn't even bother to get up. He woke up around half past ten, but lay in bed until it was lunchtime. He then walked down into the Great Hall. On his way there, many people turned around and gasped shocked when they saw him slurping through the halls. Draco didn't know what he looked like and he didn't care. When he walked into the Hall, he noticed Potter's friends sitting at their usual table. Draco ignored them. He grabbed some food and then left again.
"It is our duty, as best men and best friends, to tell you some embarrassing stories about the two husbands here." Ron had a wide grin on his face, "And I have to tell you that our dear Harry had nothing better to do in sixth year than to follow Mal- Draco's every step wherever he went."
"Has he been here?", Harry asked after McGonnagal nodded understanding and offered Harry a biscuit. McGonnagal shook her head.
"It's not logic! Not at all! Why the fuck did you forbid him to go to Hogwarts? You would've been rid of him for a
It was no surprise that everyone looked at them and whispered hysterically. Three Prophets lay on the table, one on the couch, five people were reading it, one girl held it in her hand and two boys threw it back on the table. Harry tried as good as possible to ignore them, but he felt, that Draco couldn't do it as good as Harry. Harry was used to be subject No.1, Draco wasn't. He pressed Harry's hand and gritted his teeth.
"I'm sorry that I stormed in and kind of kidnapped you.", Draco said after they sat there for a long time not talking. Potter snorted.
"Draco. I really like you, but you have to face it already. You and Potter don't belong together. That's nothing but gross and unnatural.", he said with a disgusted look.
And Malfoy was punctual. At exactly half past eleven he stood in front of Harry and the cauldron of not-yet-finished potion. Harry smiled.
And he hurried out of the hospital wing, over the field to the lake. It was early February and no wonder that no one was down there.
"Besides" Hermione continued while levitating the pot outside, "I think it's better for you two to have some privacy."
and Potter said they had to watch this one because it was a classic. Of course Draco didn't know that it was a classic and he didn't know what exactly made this one a classic, but he saw how happy Potter looked and so he just went with it.
"Uh, yes." Harry answered a bit startled by the sudden conversation, "Draco Malfoy is visiting his mother."
"And you. You looked hotter than ever.", he said grinning. Draco laughed and kissed him. Potter smiled and blushed heavily.
"Yes?", Potter answered and Draco could hear surprise in his voice, even though he felt like Potter had waited for him to say something.
"Yes, Potter, I have seen you and Mr. Malfoy talk in my classroom this morning," she said, "And since neither of you shouted or cursed, I suspect-"
"Don't." He said loudly, his hand raised, "I don't need your pity. As I said, you don't know how I feel! You don't have a mother to worry about! Your mother is dead!"
They sat in the common room for a long time and talked and played games and talked a little more. Hermione hadn't picked up her book once, because she now realized that this was the last time she was going to see Harry and Ron until Christmas. The sun was hidden behind the hills and the common room was almost completely deserted when Harry and Ron got up to leave with a heavy heart.
"I am. You remember Draco Malfoy, don't you?" Harry grinned at her disbelieving expression, "And I'm sure if
"That's one of the four houses of Hogwarts. In Slytherin are the cunning and ambitious ones.", Harry explained.
"Stay here for the night. I'll write Draco back tomorrow." Harry said and opened Bond's cage to take out the small water bowl. He had to talk about this with Ron and Hermione first before he answered Malfoy.
"Nothing. It's just that you and Harry will be there and everyone will celebrate you while I am amidst the students wearing my Gryffindor robes being unnoticeable."
Hermione smiled and raised her eyebrows at Harry, who grinned and couldn't help but feel happy and excited. They finished eating and everyone helped cleaning up. Afterwards, Harry vanished into his room to write Malfoy an answer and then joined Hermione and Ron on the couch to watch TV.
Harry hated thinking like that. He didn't want Malfoy to hate him, but he did and Harry couldn't change it. And Harry had to keep pretending he hated him as well because otherwise there would be too much drama and Harry had enough of drama.
The witch flung her arms around his neck and pulled his head close, but Draco held it back. His neck started to hurt as she pulled his head in her direction and he tried to force it in the other.
"Also, I would like you to welcome our guests Ronald Weasley-" the pupils broke out in cheers, "and Harry Potter!" The cheers and screams intensified at the sound of Harry's name.
Draco stood in front of his enormous closet but had absolutely no idea what to wear. He didn't want to overdo it, but he also didn't want to look like he didn't care. Draco sighed frustrated and threw the black pullover he was holding back into the closet.
And Hermione was right. Pansy stood in front of them not ten seconds later. She hugged Draco and shook Harry's hand.
"We have classes.", Harry said nervously. Draco growled into Harry's neck, kisses getting harder, more intense, down Harry's neck. He was breathing hard, but apparently intent on not giving Harry any time to catch his breath.
Harry grinned. He noticed Lydia smiled at Draco, of course she couldn't know Harry was interested in Draco rather than her.
Even though Draco thought he would go insane if he would have to spend another hour crammed up in their dorm room, after this day he was really looking forward to getting back and having a calm and quiet room. This was until Draco opened the door and the room was filled with Potter's friends. Draco sighed.
Potter stopped in the middle of the sentence when Draco stepped into sight. He didn't wear a shirt and small drops of water were still visible on his toned shoulders and chest.
"Maybe we should get dressed," Draco suggested. Potter agreed and they got up as quietly as possible. His stupid friends knocked once again.
"Do you want to kill me?" He said loudly, but Potter only smiled and pulled out his wand. The tree stopped moving and beating, so Potter showed Draco the way into the Shrieking Shack.
"Mr Malfoy, I could give you a thousand reasons.", he answered, "First, we already are dating. We don't need your permission. And Draco loves me as much as I love him. It would break his heart if you wouldn't accept us. And if that is not enough for you, Draco seems much more free since he first talked to me about his past. He's calmer and feels safe. He's not afraid anymore. If it calms you, it seems like Draco will never me friends with Ron Weasley or Hermione Granger,
- there was something very intimate about it and they wouldn't dare calling each other by their first names in front of other people. Draco gently put one hand on Harry's shoulder.
A lot of students came out. Then Matt came outside. "You waited for me?" He asked excited when he saw Harry, but Harry didn't answer. He walked past Matt and towards Malfoy.
Ron clapped in his hands as loud as possible with his hand-knitted gloves and as every member of their snowball fight looked at him, he laughed.
Harry looked away from the window and back at the boy sitting opposite of him. Malfoy had laid down his fork and knife and put his hands in his lap.
. They were silent for a while. Harry watched Malfoy's long slim finger run up and down the glass of water and Malfoy sighed quietly, what made Harry look up at him.
Ginny and Dean nodded courtly and left them. Hermione and Ron slid closer to Harry and Hermione asked:
"I think my friends have left the party a long time ago. With other people. Off doing dirty things."
Hermione didn't look up from her books when she told him she wasn't learning for school, she was learning for herself. Ron groaned and left her alone. He and Harry spent the rainy day playing games and talking about the coming day.
"No," Harrt said and shook his head, "Don't you start like this. You have no idea how angry and hurt I was. I am."
She felt ashamed because she wanted Harry and the git of a Malfoy to make out and probably thought it didn't work out when the two of them had vanished from the party. Maybe she thought Harry and Malfoy had a fight. If they actually had one, Harry couldn't remember.
Harry had thought about going back to Hogwarts all the time and he still did. He was looking forward for his first day just like he did when he had been an eleven year old little boy. And every time he thought about his first day next year, a certain name pops into his head.
Harry hadn’t mentioned what had happened to anybody, and he didn’t talk about it to Draco. Draco seemed equally as reluctant to talk, so they pretended it hadn’t happened. Harry was walking to his next class, laden with homework, when he heard a panicked sob from the bathroom. Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. Harry was too intrigued not to go investigate, so he walked in. Draco was on the floor, his head in his hands. Quiet sobs could be heard, echoing through the bathroom. When he looked up, Harry was startled to see tears in his eyes. Noticing someone had seen his moment of weakness, Draco put his indifferent face on. “What do you want, Potter?” He hissed, but lacking his usual malice. “What’s wrong?” Harry asked lamely, hoping he didn’t seem as awkward as he sounded. “None of your concern.” Harry stepped forward, but Draco backed away like a caged animal. “Malfoy...” “Nothing’s wrong! I don’t need you here, of all people.” Draco said angrily. “Tell me what’s wrong!” Harry shouted. “Why do you care!” Draco shouted back angrily, before realizing he had made himself vulnerable. “Tell me what’s wrong,” Harry said, quieter now. “We can go back to hating each other when you tell me what’s wrong.” Draco seemed to crack. “I never hated you,” Draco said in a whisper, so softly Harry could barely hear him. “I’m a Death Eater. I know people hate me and I hate what I did.” “You’re a good person,” Harry said, trying to sympathize with him. “You don’t understand! I killed him!” Draco said, angry again. “I’m a murderer!” Draco’s eyes narrowed. He obviously said something he wasn’t supposed to say. “Listen, Malfoy. I was there, on the Astronomy tower,” Draco’s eyes widened. “I saw you didn’t want to kill him.” “But I may as well have!” Draco said furiously. He didn’t mean to, but tears trickled down his cheeks. He furiously swiped away his tears. “Leave me alone, Potter.” Harry didn’t want to, but he left the bathroom.
A wave of magic rose to his skin, the sheer feel of its power drowning out the unwanted word and rushing through him so forcefully it hurt.
“How could you ever think it was impossible?” He could see the black veins creeping away from Draco’s heart on Draco’s back, fading away. Rolling back, receding as if retreating from a force infinitely more powerful. Love. “Of course I love you. How could I not?”
The Eaten had said something about a cure. Harry remembered, suddenly, and the memory pierced through his thoughts, a ray of light straight to his heart.
“He said there was a cure. Dolohov, he mentioned–” He faltered when Malfoy shut his eyes, a pained look crossing his face, something so aching that Harry’s heart cried out in harmony. “You know what it is.”
She was even younger than he was. They had put the Body-Bind curse on her, and she looked bloody terrified.
Harry gave up trying to be gentle. He ran his hands down Draco’s chest, relishing the sounds that elicited, savouring the feel of Draco’s smooth skin and his warm mouth, his soft lips and his hands gripping Harry’s hair as if to prevent Harry from leaving. As if Harry would ever leave.
If only Draco’s sixteen-year-old self could see him now. On the way to kill the Eaten with Harry bloody Potter, working for the Ministry with him. He could barely recognize his life.
“You’re not a Death Eater anymore. You haven’t been since you decided not to be.” He kissed Draco’s blank wrist. “And you’re always beautiful.”
of bottled potions, many of them glowing in the dim magical lighting of their tent, which had a nice, small chandelier, courtesy of Malfoy’s high wizarding-tent standards.
“Sod off. Just  . . . I don’t know. We’ve gotten closer. And after this, we might never see each other again. I feel like we should enjoy the time we have left.”
Harry’s heart ached in his chest, so strong he could barely speak around it. He found Malfoy’s cold hand and held it so tightly he thought he might break it. “It’s not nothing.” He could almost
Malfoy didn’t seem worried about himself, and that alone was worrying enough to nearly break Harry in itself, but Malfoy opened his mouth, and Harry, with a shaking hand, poured the syrupy blue liquid into Malfoy’s mouth, holding the cold bottle steady with both hands.
He reached for Harry, his hands clutching– frail, bony, and tight as a noose– at Harry’s own. “Tell me you understand.”
Malfoy’s eyes opened, slowly, the swirling, magnetic grey that Harry saw in his dreams. His hand fluttered weakly in Harry’s.
“I’m going to put up the tent and fix you up.” He didn’t know why he felt compelled to talk to unconscious Malfoy, but it gave him clarity of mind over the swirling relief that Malfoy wasn’t dead and the everpresent terror that he might, at any moment, die or cross the point of no return.
One day, Draco would become one of those. He had fought it for a year, but there was no cure, and that day grew closer by the second. The day he would turn into a monster.
He could feel Draco breath against him, the warmth of his breath on Harry’s neck, the rise of his chest pushing against Harry’s own.
He looked around– this was hardly the place to put up a tent, but he’d have to find a place close by, so he could Levitate Malfoy that far, or carry him, if he could find a place really close. It felt safer to carry Malfoy, simply because of the control of it, because of the palpable weight of Malfoy’s solid body in Harry’s arms, a reminder that the boy Harry couldn’t help but ache for was not yet lost.
Draco could understand why he said that now. Just in case he died, his dream wouldn’t go down with him.
“You’re making it seem like we’re going to die or something,” he said. If Draco had his way, one of them would.
They had been monsters before, in heart and soul and mind, but now their bodies had transformed into something monstrous as well. It was the Dark Marks that did it, that changed them into creatures wizards called the Eaten.
When Voldemort died, everyone thought the War was over. They celebrated, laughed and danced, thanking Harry Potter for saving the Wizarding World. He had gotten ready for trial.
“Just tell me what it is. And if it’s impossible…” Harry trailed off. He didn’t know what to say– he wouldn’t promise he wouldn’t try, not when if there was even the slightest chance, he knew he’d go for it. Even if there wasn’t the slightest chance, he’d go for it. Draco Malfoy could not die. Harry couldn’t live with it.
,” he shouted, almost without thinking, lashing out with his wand every which way towards the Eaten still standing, but they ducked, laughing loudly.
He waited behind the tree anxiously as the two Eaten talked about what they would do to her, what parts they would eat, how much they worshipped Voldemort. His empty stomach rolled. How could he have ever thought they were right? How could he have ever befriended them?
“It’s…” Malfoy looked at him, and then away again. “It’s True Love.” He opened his mouth to take a shaky breath, staring at his hands as Harry waited, his heartbeat pounding in his throat, hope rising in his chest like the sun. “Love has always been… a counteraction to Dark Magic. The myth– it’s, it’s only a myth– but the myth is that if you know that your True Love loves you… it’s like a panacea. A bezoar stone, but for soul magic.” He laughed mirthlessly. “It’s nothing.”
“I’m gay,” Malfoy said, his voice grating and almost amused, like it was a painful inside joke to himself that Harry had no chance of understanding.
Black, cold, roiling dread rushed through Harry like a whip-quick rope, tightening around him like a noose.
He crept through the trees, trying not to make any noise, before he was directly behind the two Eaten. They were building the bonfire, laughing and crowing in a way that was definitely not human.
His breathing scratched raggedly in his throat as he ran to Malfoy’s side– Malfoy’s hair was streaked with black– dirt or ash Harry couldn’t tell– and blood trickled from a cut on the side of his head, staining his blond hair. Harry’s hands flew to the source of the blood automatically; it seemed shallow, and an irrationally strong wave of relief threatened to make him go boneless.
.” He pulled open his shirt further, off of his shoulders, so it slipped off of his arms and pooled around his waist, showing the terrible, winding black veins all the way up left arm, spilling like spiderwebs over his shoulder, reaching their long, dark fingers towards his heart. It was so terribly, wrongly
“It must’ve been the Stunner,” he whispered, his throat tight, his chest empty and hollow. He couldn’t breathe. “The Eaten are
Draco’s smile softened. “I… er.” He closed his eyes, his blond lashes fanning against his cheeks. “I feel… that way about you too. And the other thing you said. That too.”
, Draco,” he heard himself whisper, dull with relief. “Oh, Merlin.” He whispered a thank you to anyone who was listening, to anything, for saving this beautiful, inconceivably strong boy this one time.
Draco didn't need to answer that question, because a guy, not taller than Harry or Draco pushed himself towards them. Harry didn't know him, but he immediately hated him from the first look he got. Harry gritted his teeth.
"You kept it this long from me? Are you crazy? This is something huge!" Ron said angrily and stood up.
"Would you excuse me?" He said, didn't even wait for an answer and stormed out of the room. Draco sat down in the armchair in the common room and ripped open the letter.
When he opened the door to their flat, Harry felt like his shirt was soaked. He hoped his ice wouldn't already be liquid, so he slipped out of his shoes and hurried into the kitchen.
"So. You spent five hundred Galleons on a kitchen table?", Ron asked. Harry laughed. He was still not over it.
He walked up to the new tower and through the common room to the corridor where his dorm room was. He entered and his eyes immediately fell on the boy laying in the bed opposite Harry's - asleep. Harry had to smile. He walked up to Malfoy's bed and leaned over him. Malfoy looked so peaceful when he was asleep, Harry almost didn't want to wake him.
Draco flinched as he first saw the long table in the giant dining room. When he had visited his mother before, they had always decided to sit in the living room, avoiding the dining room, but today Narcissa wanted it to be formal because they had guests.
It seemed to cost Ron all his courage to say this and Harry was endlessly grateful for it. He smiled and was even more relieved, when the corner of Ron's mouth twitched up a bit.
"Mister Weasley, I need to ask you to leave now. Mister Potter needs rest.", Madame Pomfrey said sternly. Ron nodded at her and stood up.
"I don't know what you mean.", Potter answered. Draco shot him a thanking look and Potter nodded smiling. Draco stood up and walked towards the door. He noticed Potter's questioning look and mouthed:
"Yeah, that's a shame. Would have been so nice to...", as the girl who spoke saw Draco shuffling by, she stopped in mid-sentence and nodded with her head in his direction.
Draco sighed and rolled his eyes. This was ridiculous. He didn't want to go there. He didn't want to see Potter, not after their last embarrassing encounter. But he also really didn't want Pansy to be whining for the rest of the day.
Harry's cock twitched determinedly to life at the sight of Draco next to him, but he stayed still with his eyes closed, enjoying the pressure of Draco's bare leg thrust in between his, and the steady sound of his breathing.
"Yeah.", he said. His throat was dry and he thought he couldn't speak, but he forced the words out anyways.
Harry was glad that Ron and Hermione got back together, he was really happy about that. Really. But their relationship only got stronger because of the fight and now Harry felt somehow left out and alone. Whenever they hung out together, the two of them were snogging and whispering and giggling - something they didn't even do when the were a new couple - and Harry sat next to them in silence.
"Expecto Patronum.", he said and waved his wand. A silvery animal came out of the tip of his wand - a stag. Malfoy watched the stag galloping though the room and vanishing in the air.
He pushed his hand away and stormed towards Matt. In one motion, Draco pulled out his wand, flicked it and the boy opposite of him flinched with pain.
“Alright then,” the man stood up straight. “It’s going to take me a bit. Do you want to look around for a while while I get the brooms ready?”
Carter called for the Knight bus, still looking furious. Harry knew his cousin had hoped for some sort of emotion from his parents besides hate.
"I just overheard something. Vernon was talking to Petunia about having us clean the attic out this summer. Petunia said we couldn't, because 'the stuff from James and Lily is up there'," Carter made air quotes with his fingers. "There is stuff from your parents up there!"
Adrian suddenly stood from his position behind Alexander and the girl. He walked slowly, until he was standing in front of all the first years.
After nearly a half hour Harry lost control, "Oh just shut up," he finally snapped. "If you're so great, prove it. Until I see it, I'm not going to believe it. Bragging will get you nowhere, you have to
Carter was also thriving in Gryffindor. Most of the other students were suspicious of him, but Carter didn't care. He was having the time of his life with Neville and Ron. They were constantly sneaking out at night, and pranking the Gryffindors they didn't like.
Blaise's eyes flickered between the three of them. "Two dark wizards from traditionally light families, and one dark muggleborn. You guys are quite the strange group, aren't you?"
"It's so weird you know," Carter huffed. "Being one of the only dark wizards in Gryffindor. Angelina doesn't even look in our direction. It's like we don't exist."
"Boy you better shut up right this instant!" Vernon grumbled. Harry could hear his uncle's loud footsteps getting closer. He felt a wave of panic, but he was also beginning to feel the strong pull of sleep.
"The good news is they currently have no way to know when someone is practicing dark magic. They have to catch you in the act in order to prosecute you. My mother wrote me a letter this morning. She thinks it's only going to get worse from here." Blaise sighed. "Dumbledore will continue to push for more regulations."
Something clicked inside Harry's mind. The parchment from the bank said 'Magic Classification: Amber'. Did his new eye color have something to do with that?
Neville hesitated, “I don’t know guys. She would be furious. Plus she always said Knockturn was dangerous because it was full of dark wizards.”
Eventually, after reading the letter multiple times, Snape folded the letter and handed it back to him.
She noticed them and walked over to inspect them. She adjusted Harry's jumper, "Yes very good. A perfect fit. The red really brings out the amber in your eyes."
They had been practicing new dark spells for the past few hours, and Carter was having a hard time holding an earth elemental shield spell.
Neville spent the next 20 minutes explaining the rules of quidditch and how Hogwarts had quidditch matches between the different houses.
They were the last two students to enter the potions classroom. Harry frowned when he saw Draco Malfoy standing in front of Snape's desk, whispering furiously.
Harry found his name three doors down from the base of the stairs. He grimaced when he saw Draco Malfoys name right above his.
Blaise looked just afraid as he felt. Without speaking another word Blaise took down the ward and they returned to the Slytherin common room.
A girl stepped forward, also wearing one of the silver pendants, “My name is Gemma Farley, I'm a 4th year Ravenclaw. Keep in mind, out of everyone in this room, only 10 of you will become members of the order, and only one of you will join the court."
Eventually it announced, "Gryffindor!" Harry gave a sign of relief. At least Carter would have a friend in Gryffindor.
They walked up to the door. Harry pointed his wand at the door handle and whispered, “I am Harry Potter, son of Lily and James potter.” The door handle clicked open. According to the parchment, the wards on the apartment would only open for someone who was a direct descendent of the Potters. Harry then pointed his wand at Carter, “I, Harry James Potter hereby give Carter Aslan Dursley permission to access 113 Diagon Alley, London.”
His parents loved him, and they left him their fortune. He glanced down at his oversized t-shirt and poked a finger through one of the many holes.
She pointed to the black and gold robed older students standing behind her, "We make up the current court. The court governs the order, and is responsible for voting on events, ect. The court has seven members, one member from each year, including the king or queen. The king or queen is elected by all members of the order, and serves until they graduate.”
"The one on the left goes down to the boys dorms, and the one on the right goes up to the girls dorms. Find the door with your name on it. Each of you will be sharing with one other person."
Carter and Harry stumbled off the bus, wanting to escape the death trap as quickly as possible. They nodded to each other just before entering the bar. This was it.
Rowan gestured to the tables. “First you must select the wood for the wand. Walk around and pick the one that speaks to you.”
"Would you boys each like to put on one of your new outfits?" Madam Malkin asked with a smile. They both nodded quickly, and she showed them to two private changing rooms. Harry pulled on a red wool jumper and a pair of black trousers, with a pair of black socks, and his new black shoes. He never could have imagined how good it would feel just to wear socks and shoes that actually fit him.
They were on the edge of their seats the entire time, watching as both teams scored over and over. It was a very close match, with the falcons only a few points ahead of the bats.
“My mother said the last Crimson War never really stopped. After Lord Voldemort was captured and taken to Crowmark, the battles were fought in the courtroom rather than on the battlefield.”
And beside the other bed on the right side of the room was a door, which Harry quickly realized was a small bathroom when he pushed the door open.
He couldn't see most of the professor's eyes to tell if they were light or dark, but he spotted Dumbledore immediately.
So Carter is Dudley's twin brother, but because he has magic, the Dursleys treat him the same way they treat Harry. I thought it would be interesting if Harry had a friend for once!
Harry patted his pocket to make sure his trunk was still there. He had checked almost a hundred times that morning, not wanting to forget it. They carefully carried their owl cages through the crowds. Amon brooded silently in his cage, and Harry could tell he wasn’t happy. Harry felt guilty about his treatment, but promised him he would let him out as soon as they reached Hogwarts.
Harry waited anxiously in the library. He was afraid Draco wouldn’t come. Harry had never seen Draco completely fall apart like that before. In the bathroom, at least he still had some composure, but now... The boggart had shocked him to his core. Harry still remembered Boggart-Harry yelling at Draco. I COULD NEVER LOVE FILTH LIKE YOU! DEATHEATER! MURDERER! YOU’LL BE JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER! Just like your father... Harry knew now how much Draco wanted to be different, better than his father. Draco walked into the library. His mask was back on, his walls up, once again guarded and indifferent. Harry never realized how good Draco was about hiding emotion, but now that he had seen the look in Draco’s eye after the boggart, he could see a trace of an unreadable emotion behind his eyes. Draco walked stiffly over to Harry. “What do you want, Potter?” His usual snide voice was back, and even though Harry hated Draco’s malicious words, he was relieved to see Draco hadn’t spent the whole time curled up in the corner of Maybridge’s classroom, broken. Harry spread out his books and parchment. “Sit down.” Draco did, but not without a glare. Harry decided to get to the point. “Why did the boggart turn into me?” They both heard the unspoken question. Why did the boggart say that it could never love you? Draco hesitated. “Maybe it was a jinxed boggart and it turns into someone you hate.” Harry knew, and he knew Draco did too, that that was an empty excuse, but he let it slide. He opened up his book bag and took out his homework. Draco lingered awkwardly. “You can go, but we will talk more in depth about it when nobody can listen.” Draco turned on his heel and left. Harry worked on his homework with his back leaning against the library’s bookshelf. He had left at least two essays until the last minute. Harry didn’t remember falling asleep, but he must have, because the next day he woke up in the library. The first thing he noticed when he woke up was he wasn’t sitting up, and his neck didn’t have a cramp in it. The second thing he noticed was he wasn’t cold, and his glasses weren’t on his face. He opened his eyes, and reached out a hand next to him and fumbled for his glasses. Thankfully, they were there, and he pulled them on and sat up. He looked down. He was lying on an assortment of Slytherin pillows, and a robe had been thrown over him. With a jolt of shock and panic, he checked his watch and saw he had ten minutes until his class. He felt a sinking feeling in his stomach when he realized that he hadn’t finished his essays. He picked them up, hoping against hope that he could quickly scribble down enough to get him a decent enough mark. He picked up his paper and realized with a shock that someone had finished the rest of his essay with a jagged, spiky handwriting Harry had never seen before. Draco. He had to be the one to do this. Harry felt a rush of affection for Draco. He picked up his wand, and with a flick, made the handwriting resemble his own. He packed up his stuff, pushing the Slytherin pillows into his book bag hoping that he didn’t get ink on them, and hurried to his class.
Harry had fallen asleep on Draco’s bed when they went up to the dorm to talk and so had Draco. Harry woke with the sun streaming through the drapery, although he pretended not to be awake when Draco woke. Draco looked around with a start, as if awakening from a nightmare. He looked down at Harry and his gaze softened. He looked at Harry’s sleeping face for a moment. “I don’t know what I did to deserve you,” he whispered quietly. Harry knew Draco would kill him if he found Harry had heard what he said, so he kept silent. Draco got up and got ready as usual, stuffing his stuff into his book bag as he went. When he got ready, he shook Harry, and Harry pretended to be drowsy and barely awake. “Get up! If someone finds you here...” Harry got up, but not without complaint. Harry sat on the bed and looked at Draco. “I don’t have any of my stuff.” Draco paused in cleaning up his stuff to narrow his eyes at Harry. “Not my problem.” Harry pretended to be offended, but he knew Draco wouldn’t help. Harry got up and wrapped his arms around Draco. Draco stiffened, not used to being hugged. “I love you,” Harry said, remembering how Draco thought he didn’t deserve him. Harry pulled away and walked out of the common room. Luckily, nobody was there. When he made it to Gryffindor tower and swung open the portrait hole, he was greeted by Hermione, a frown on her face. “Where were you all night?” “Probably with Malfoy!” An angry voice yelled from up the stairs- Ginny. “Were you?” Hermione asked, scrutinizing him. “No! I mean yes, but I just fell asleep, that’s all!” Hermione looked like she didn’t believe him, but she let it slide. Harry ran to his dorm and gathered up his stuff, then left for the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione. When they got to the entrance of the Great Hall, Harry saw Draco a few feet away. He forced himself not to turn Draco’s way and sat down at the Gryffindor table. “Hogwarts Eighth Year Students,” McGonagall started. “This year has already started with peace, and you’ll do well to keep it that way. Students may not discriminate against houses or people that may have been part of the other side of the war.” At this, many Gryffindors and Ravenclaws glared at the Slytherin table, especially at Draco. “I want to use this time today to inform you that if you need therapy for your time in the war, Madame Pomfrey is in the hospital wing. I would like the people who played a big part in ending the war to step forward. Harry Potter,” at this, many first years craned their heads to see Harry. They had been told about Harry Potter by their parents. When Harry stepped up, he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall on him. “Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood, Ginny Weasley, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, Cho Chang, Terry Boot...” As the rest of the DA stepped up, the whole Hall was whispering; the older students telling the first years about the war and how he, Harry, had stopped Voldemort. “I would also like to applaud the students who fought in the war and lost loved ones,” McGonagall continued. “Thats all for today. Enjoy your breakfast!” There was a clanking of utensils as the Hall resumed eating and talking. Some Gryffindor first years near them started talking about the Slytherins. “I heard one of them is a Death Eater.” “No way, really?” “Which one is he- I lost a couple family members and I have a few choice hexes to use on him.” The older Gryffindors joined them. “I heard it’s Malfoy- the pompous prat.” Harry cut in angrily. “Nobody will be hexing Draco.” The Gryffindors stared at him in surprise. “Harry, I thought you’d be the first in line,” Terry Boot said. “He’s a good person.” They all were completely thrown by this. “Harry, since when was Malfoy a good person?” Ginny, sulkily sitting beside Ron, said, “Since he started snogging him.” Harry looked at Ginny in frustration, as half the Gryffindors nearly fell out of their seats. “No, he is a good person because he didn’t kill anyone, and he was supposed to kill Dumbledore but didn’t.” “But is it true?” A brave little first year piped up. “Is what true?” Harry asked. “Are you snogging him?” Harry’s face grew red. “What I do in my personal time is none of your business.” He grew even redder as all the Gryffindor’s eyes gravitated towards him. “Do you actually...” Katie bell trailed off as she noticed Draco across the room, staring at Harry. Draco noticed her watching and narrowed his eyes. “I lost friends in that war,” began Terry Boot steadily. “And Malfoy let the death eaters in. He let them in. I don’t care if he’s a death eater or not, he’s responsible for their deaths.” Before Harry could stop her, she stood up, and cast a spell at Draco. “Expelliarmus!” She shrieked so he couldn’t cast a spell, and started running towards him. “Cruci-” “Petrificus Totalus!” Harry yelled, and there was a bang and a flash of red light and Terry Boot fell to the floor, stiff as a board. The entire hall was frozen, rooted to their seats. McGonagall unfroze first, calling teachers to get Terry out of the Great Hall. Through the commotion and running around, Draco retrieved his wand and walked over to Harry, white as a sheet. “Thank you,” he said stiffly. “Let’s get out of here,” Harry said. They slipped out of the Great Hall amid the chaos and walked to the Courtyard. “Draco?” Harry asked tentatively. “Yes.” “This situation reminded me of what happened sixth year- did- did it scar?” Draco knew Harry was talking about Sectumsempra. Draco lifted his shirt, and Harry saw scars resembling long, spidery cracks branching out from a single point on his stomach. Harry inhaled sharply. “I- did that to you-”
"But Harry, if you don't want to, you shouldn't. We all know you and Malfoy can easily lash out." Luna said seriously.
So they would sit and drink and Hermione and her mother would laugh together and talk. Harry smiled and nodded.
Harry tried not to think of Ron, he concentrated hardly not to trip. Draco smiled nervously and grabbed Harry's hand. The house tables have vanished, instead there were about a hundred smaller, lantern-lit ones, each seating about a dozen people.
"No, you don't have to. I can stand that little pain in the neck. She's like vermin, you know.", Draco said and Potter raised one eyebrow.
"Well yes. You were on the dance floor and two girls were around you and I got so angry somehow and I ordered another drink." Malfoy said shyly.
"April 29th." He read "Dear Narcissa. In case I will die in this battle, open this letter and read it. Also tell Draco about everything I'm telling you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for pulling you into this, for making our lives horrible, just because I'm such a fool. I didn't want this. I never did. I didn't want war. I didn't want to be his follower for ages. I was young and hated the mudbloods, now I'm grown up but have to hate them all along."
Harry had hardly stopped thinking about Draco the entire day. Now, they were standing outside in the darkness, facing the lake by a lone tree. Harry had snuck out with his invisibility cloak. He knew it was taking a risk, but he couldn’t resist going to see Draco. “I think they’re starting to suspect something’s going on with me.” “It’s not like they’re wrong. You’ve been secretly going out with the most handsome boy in Hogwarts.” Harry scoffed. “You are not the most handsome boy in Hogwarts.” “Oh really,” Draco said, suddenly grabbing Harry’s waist and pulling himself to him so their chests were touching. “And what if I do this?” Harry’s heart was racing, and he was sure his cheeks were flushed, but he said, “Still no.” Draco smirked at Harry’s expression, like he was trying not to fall for Draco’s trick, but still being mesmerized by Draco so close to him. “You sure?” Draco whispered into Harry’s ear, his breath hot against Harry’s face, and his lips brushing Harry’s ear. Harry couldn’t stop himself any longer, and with a sound of resignation he pulled Draco’s mouth to his. Draco kissed him passionately, and with so much fire Harry nearly fell over. Harry kissed him back desperately. Harry pulled away from Draco, keeping their foreheads together. “I love you,” Harry breathed. There was a short pause, and Harry wondered if he went too far. Then, “Well, I am perfect...” “Draco.” Even annoyed, Draco loved Harry saying his name. “Fine. I love your annoying arse too, Potter.” Draco felt Harry smiling, even in the darkness. Harry leaned forward, and Draco captured his lips with a kiss. “Not everyone is as privileged to date me, Potter. Consider yourself lucky,” Draco said snidely. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and pulled himself to Draco. “I am,” Harry murmured against Draco’s lips.
Harry had managed to get some time alone with Draco in the Slytherin common room while everyone was in class. They were spread out of the sofa, and Harry’s head was on Draco’s lap and Draco’s fingers were playing with his hair. “Draco?” Harry asked. “What is it now, Potter?” Draco said waspishly. “Now that we’re boyfriends, how long have you liked me?” He didn’t get an answer. “Draco?” “It doesn’t matter,” came the response. Harry frowned. Why was he refusing to answer? Harry sat up and kissed him. “Tell me, please.” Draco’s face was slightly pink as he answered, “I don’t have to tell you.” Harry looked up at him pleadingly, the green eyes piercing the pale grey ones. Draco’s eyes narrowed, but he gave in. “During our fourth year, when I saw you fighting a bloody dragon, I realized how the thought of you dying terrified me.” Harry smiled up at him, and Draco couldn’t help but smile back. They talked well into the night, telling each other things they had never told anyone else before.
Harry couldn’t focus on any of his classes. Every time that he tried to think of something school related, all he could think about was the feel of Draco, and the strong, unbreakable urge to stay wrapped up in him forever. At the end of classes, Harry found Draco, and much to the amusement of his friends, pulled him away. Harry pressed himself against Draco and kissed him. As usual, Draco took control of the kiss, pressing them even closer together so that all they could feel was each other. “I’ve been waiting for this all day,” Harry said breathlessly. Draco’s smug expression was not lost on Harry, but he couldn’t bring himself to care about anything but Draco. Draco pulled away. “You also haven’t explained when you were in the Slytherin common room for the first time.” Harry laughed. “You were getting all upset because everyone thought I was the heir of Slytherin. We thought you might be upset because you were actually the heir.” “I’m flattered,” Draco drawled. “Do go on.” Harry made a face at him, and then continued. “Hermione brewed Polyjuice Potion and-“ “Wait,” Draco interrupted. He actually sounded kind of impressed. “Granger could make Polyjuice Potion in first year?” Harry smiled widely. “Yes. Well, when you went in, we asked you a couple of questions, unfortunately not telling us you were the heir. You also mentioned a certain secret chamber underneath the drawing room-” Draco glared at him. “So that’s who gave that anonymous tip! Where was Granger all this time?” “Oh. She- erm- got turned into a cat.” “What?” Asked Draco incredulously. “Millicent Bullstrode has a cat, and when Hermione got a hair-“ Draco was laughing silently now, his shoulders rising and falling. When he stopped, he looked up and Harry was staring at him. “What?” “You look so gorgeous when you smile.” Draco scowled, but his ears were pink. “Sod off, you great big sap.” Harry smiled, and wrapped his arms around Draco. Draco was stiff and unresponding. Harry pouted at Draco, and the blond narrowed his eyes at him, but wrapped his arms around Harry. Draco was still tense and on edge, obviously not used to being hugged. Harry tilted his head up to kiss Draco, and Draco gladly obliged. Harry’s fingers once again carded through Draco’s silver-bond hair, to which Draco pulled away with a frown. “Why always the hair, you twat? This took forever to get ready!” Harry merely laughed and brought Draco’s lips to his again.
Harry wanted to tell the school, and although nervous, Draco agreed. In the middle of breakfast, Draco stood on top of the Slytherin table. Harry made his way over to the Slytherin table, so he was standing right beside it. To a bystander, Harry was going to see what was going on. “Mr. Malfoy!” Professor McGonnagall said in a scandalized voice. When Harry glanced at Dumbledore, his blue eyes were twinkling. Draco’s chin lifted and he said, “If I could have your attention, you degenerates.” “You’re not going to-” Draco smirked. “I am.” His fingers grazed Harry’s cheek as he leaned down, pale fingers gripping Harry’s neck for balance, and kissed him. Suddenly the Hall went so quiet you could hear a pin drop, half the students waiting for Harry to push Draco away, and the other half either fainting or cheering him on. The entire hall erupted into gasps and cheers as Harry’s fingers flew up and hooked on Draco’s collar as he kissed him back. When they pulled away, Harry was dimly aware that the Slytherin table had burst into catcalls and wolf whistling. Draco glared at them. “Say one word and I’ll hex your mouths off,” Draco said in a malicious voice. “You’re dating a Gryffindor and we can’t say anything? The chosen one?” Harry flushed at this, and Draco narrowed his eyes even further. “A Death Eater dating the chosen one?” “We all get the irony,” Draco hissed in a warning tone. To the Hall’s surprise, he hopped off the table and made his way gracefully to the Gryffindor table with Harry by his side, choosing two seats between Ron and Hermione. Draco held himself up regally, and whenever someone tried to send a disgusted glance towards him or Harry, he stared them down with icy grey eyes until they backed down. Harry felt Draco’s fingers entwine with his beneath the table, and he couldn’t help but smile. Hermione chanced a look at them, and noted how happy Harry seemed.
Ron and Hermione were confused. Harry had been there at night, he had went to bed, and now he was nowhere to be found. Ron had borrowed Harry’s invisibility cloak, and none of them had seen him leave. They were both extremely worried. Hermione grimaced. Ron sent her a questioning look. “We’re going to have to go to the Slytherin dorms.” On the way there, they coerced a Slytherin into giving them the password. They marched in, then stopped. The Slytherins stared at them with matching disgusted expressions. “You have to leave now,” one of the older Slytherins said, looking down his nose at them. “But-“ “Only one Gryffindor is allowed here, and that’s Potter. The rest of you can’t come in.” “But Harry- he could be in danger-“ Hermione said before putting a hand over her mouth. She supported Harry, and she knew Draco looked like he was in love with Harry, but she had her doubts. Draco had never given her reason to trust him, and she didn’t. But maybe that wasn’t a wise decision to say to a group of Slytherins. “What did you just say?” Zabini said sikily, with an undertone of a threat. “Are you insinuating that the Slytherin Prince would hurt Potter in any way?” Hermione looked down, ashamed. “I- I just don’t know, and I’m worried for him- what if he has bad intentions? I have no reason to trust him-“ “And you won’t take Harry’s word for it. My, how very trusting of you.” Hermione turned red. “How do you know that he won’t hurt Harry?” Ron said heatedly. “How do we know that Potter won’t hurt him?” “Because- because we know he wouldn’t-“ “And we know that Draco wouldn’t do anything of the sort.” Hermione let out a long breath. “At least show us what they are doing in there.” Zabini smirked. “I bet you’d like to know.” Hermione flushed an even brighter red than before when she got his meaning. Ron had gone deathly pale. “A- are they?” Zabini shrugged. “I actually don’t know. What Draco gets up to with Potter is none of my concern, and, quite frankly, it’s none of yours.” Ron shifted from foot to foot as Hermione sighed. “We’re worried about him! Could you at least use some sort of spell to see what they’re doing, and if it’s anything...” Here she paused and looked pointedly at everything but Ron. “Bad, then we’ll leave them alone. But if he’s hurting Harry, we have permission to break the door down. “What’s in it for us?” Zabini questioned, raising an eyebrow. “If he’s doing anything bad, then you can have dirt on him.” Hermione decided she didn’t quite like the malicious glint that shone in Zabini’s eyes. “Deal.” Hermione and Ron waited with baited breath. “Wait!” Hermione said quickly. “Can you... leave the room when you do it?” Zabini sent her a look. “This is our common room, Granger.” “Well, yes,” Hermione began, “But of Harry’s in a... compromising position, as his friends we don’t want you to see that.” Zabini rolled his eyes, but ushered the Slytherins into their dormitories, with a cough that sounded oddly like “Prudish Gryffindors.” With a quick explanation of how to do the spell, he left as well. Ron looked like he was being choked, and his skin was a pale shade of green. “I think I’m going to... leave as well.” He quickly left the common room and started on his way back up to Gryffindor tower. Hermione rolled up her sleeves, and cast the charm. In front of her was a circle with a blurry image in it, but the longer she looked, the sharper the image became. Hermione looked in shock to see an image of Harry and Draco Malfoy, wrapped in each other’s arms. As she watched, Draco stirred and lifted a hand up to tenderly brush away a jet-black hair away from Harry’s face. Harry smiled, and let his hand curl around Draco once more. During this, Hermione’s heart nearly burst watching this exchange between Harry and Draco,  and she quickly extinguished the spell to leave them to their own privacy. She quickly set up a protective spell, and called for Zabini to come back in. His face was full of evil eagerness. “What did you see?” Hermione pretended to look disappointed. “They cast a protective spell that wards against it.” Zabini’s eyes hardened. “Then get out of my common room, and don’t bother coming here again, Mudblood.”
