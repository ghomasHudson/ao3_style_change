The three of them share a smile, remembering Blaise’s persistent courting of Ginny back in their last year at school.
“But I-” he glances at Harry nervously before continuing, “I have plans to become a Potions Master. I don’t think I could do that and teach at the same time.”
“Yes, God, yes.” Harry pushes his hips back desperately, wanting to feel more, needing that friction. For a second he wonders if Draco’s forgotten-
So far Draco hasn’t said whether any of them have and Harry hasn’t asked. He should, especially with the school year practically being over already, but a part of him is almost scared of what the answer will be.
He actually gets a laugh at that. “Don’t, please. You put just as much stock into all that as I do.”
“There’s nothing between me and Draco, alright?” Harry says loudly to her so she cuts off suddenly. “Nothing. We hated each other growing up and you know what? We had the right idea. Trying to be friends didn’t work, we found that out pretty quickly, so if everyone could just stop going on about it that would be great.”
"Fine." He says and he does his best to sneer, to adopt the mask he'd worn for seven years once more. "Even if I wasn't, it wouldn't be any of your business now would it?"
He flushes a bit, remembering how he’d made a right arse of himself while the two of them had looked at a picture of Teddy and Andromeda. The little boy had been grinning and changing the shape of his nose while Andromeda held him and looked on fondly.
"And let people like Pansy Parkinson and Malfoy out into the world without it?" Hermione asks logically. "Hardly."
Harry frowns, shifting underneath Draco to get more comfortable and making both of them hiss in a breath. He wants to laugh at the absurdity of the situation, at him asking that after kissing Harry senseless and making him feel as hard as a broom handle.
Then he’s working to get Draco’s pants off and Draco quickly returns the favour. Soon it’s not just their heavy breathing filling the air, but also panting cut-off moans that Draco blushes to make and Harry grins wickedly at. The bed’s covers are rucked down to the foot of the mattress and the draperies around the four poster are wide open, letting in the dull greenish glow of the dorm so Draco can see everything, can see his pale skin against the darker shade of Harry’s. He can see the swollen redness of Harry’s lips and trace the shapes of them with his tongue while his hand wanders down to grab playfully at his arse and then hold tightly at the back of his thigh just below it so they can rut against one another.
“Oh, fine.” Molly smiles brightly at them both. “Complaining a bit about her dress being tight but Hermione said it was fine and she was exaggerating.” She meets Blaise’s eyes. “She looks absolutely beautiful.”
Her gaze is intent and it bores into him, making it impossible for Harry to look away. “Before this second war I had beliefs that are probably entirely contradictory to yours. Beliefs harmful to those you love. I will not deny it. Not only because it would be foolish and impossible to do so, but because I am strong enough to own up to my mistakes. Strong enough to realize they
Unexpectedly, Draco is touched by that. He has just assumed that in any argument Hermione would automatically be on Harry’s side. Ron, Ginny and the rest of the Gryffindors too. Apparently that’s not the case, and Draco feels himself warm at the fact, some of his bad mood disappearing.
“I wish things had been different.” He says softly, and he’s said it before but it’s all he has really. Apologies are nothing if they’re repeated endlessly, and Harry knows how sorry he is already. He can’t fix the past.
In the end, the trial is over in a day. By far the shortest hearing, and Harry isn’t sure whether that is because it’s Draco or because he had been the first to speak.
The words ring out through the Great Hall and everyone is sitting and staring at Harry who’s looking at the pile of letters in front of him with a disgusted expression on his face.
No, it’s the flush on his cheeks and the brilliant happiness in his eyes that has Harry staring at him. Even while Draco carefully puts his wrapped present on the table and turns to face him, Harry’s eyes are still roving over the blonde, taking in every detail he can as quickly as he can.
In the end there’s only so long Draco can look at a chair and he’s forced to turn back to Harry just as Harry begins to say, “look, Draco-”
Miraculously their ridiculous plan seems to work. Things settle between them until Draco would go so far as to say they really are friend again, albeit with lots of topics that are clearly off limits between them.
“You made me break up with him!” Draco says, too loudly for the small amount of space between them given they’re the only two in the room. “You and Father- because of you both I- and ever since Hogwarts we’ve been-”
Still, Draco knows why she hasn’t said anything to anyone else, especially not Blaise. Partly because she’s afraid, though she’ll never admit it, but mostly because rejection would crush her. And they both know she wouldn’t take it as well as Blaise had.
Harry nods and she smiles. “See? Connections. All of us, our whole lives. It’s interesting to see how we all made it here.”
"The first time we met." Harry answers him, knowing Malfoy won't let it go. "I'd only just learned I was a wizard the night before and you were the first kid my age I ever spoke to like me. The first Hogwarts student. Hagrid was the first wizard I ever met.” He wonders if he should be embarrassed about that but then realizes no. He shouldn’t. "Hagrid was the first person in my life who was patient with me, and nice. And that day in
“It comes from a place of love.” Draco says before taking another drink and wiping his lip before growing serious. Harry tracks his movement. “Sorry. I’m nervous.”
Their arrival helps him move past the way he’s just been bombarded, and when he glances back he sees Levi
“Please,” he whispers against the shell of Harry’s ear and he feels Harry’s entire body shiver above him.
Harry's stomach sours and he seriously thinks he might be sick. The last thing he wants to see is Draco Malfoy getting off for everybody to see with some random fucking bloke just outside the reception.
“I mean I am known for my kind and giving nature,” Draco goes on, ignoring Harry’s snort pointedly. “Could practically be Father Christmas, I could.”
It’s a bit surreal, when he thinks about it. This time last year he and Hermione were struggling to survive, and now his biggest worry is whether he’s properly remembered the title of the book Draco had told him to buy Blaise. He’s bought the bloke a few chocolates as well, just in case.
“Some do.” Draco admits. “But usually you can just pretend you’re so-and-so’s spouse and they’ll never know.”
"Oh don't worry," Harry says, moving forward to replace his hand with his lips on Draco's chest. Draco releases a shaky breath and falls back against the sheets as Harry's tongue swirls around a nipple. "I definitely won't let you do anything like that again. Not unless you mean it that time."
One of his hand lifts, shaky, and he wipes Harry’s fringe from his forehead, careful to not touch the skin. His thumb hovers, holding it back, and his eyes are on the scar intently.
“Nice try but I’m not saying anything either.” Her expression turns disappointed. “But you’re not in the middle of anything. We’ll be fine.”
“Sweetheart.” Shock makes her set aside her book entirely as she gets up to stand in front of him, taking his hands in her own. Hers are cold, as usual, but Draco finds comfort in them just like always all the same. “Draco. Where is this coming from?”
Ron looks like he’s about to pass out from exhaustion but he nods and stands in his chair before gently helping a giggly Hermione up and out of hers as well.
A short and sweet chapter today! I may post two chapters next week because I'd like to finish this up before my school semester starts.
Draco resists the urge to tell her that Potter has no qualms about refusing to shake someone's hand in front of others, the memory of that first train ride always a bitter one. He bites down on his tongue to stop himself.
Harry’s sad to go in the end but the thought of seeing Hermione and the Weasleys helps. The younger students wave them off at the bottom of the staircase before Harry and Draco head to McGonagall’s office to meet her.
“And I understand. Or at least I think I do. But you say you loved me all that time while saying all of those things to me and- they way we
Though he can't resist looking up and seeing a brunette man kissing down his partner's neck. And then stopping short at the sight of shockingly white-blond hair, almost hidden with the way the owner of it has his head thrown back in obvious pleasure.
“So all this talk about what we’ve done to each other and the past… let’s just forget it, alright? We know what we’ve done to each other. We’ve lived that part of our lives. I’d much rather move on and live the rest now if you all don’t mind.”
Draco swallows thickly. He can’t look away from them. Harry’s discomfort is obvious. Romilda seems less upbeat than before but she doesn’t look too upset either.
Harry nods again. “If you could believe it, she actually gave that one away. We’d never have known if she hadn’t acted like that.”
“We didn’t exactly get that far.” Harry chimes in unhelpfully and Draco finally looks up at him to glare. “Come on. It’s fine, she didn’t see a thing. Can we go see Teddy now?”
“Probably.” Harry agrees, feeling a sense of connection between them, the familiarity that comes from years of memories only the two of them are party to encircling them. Harry can practically smell the familiar smell of the Hogwarts library, feel the Potions textbook beneath his fingers, see-
“Will you run away if I do?” Harry wheels around to stare at him, catching the tail-end of Draco’s flinch.
Parvati and Hannah both drink. So does Blaise, Theo, Dean, Seamus and Neville. The rest of the girls don’t and Harry sees Pansy shoot Hermione a wink.
How should he act though, Harry wonders to himself. Should he play it cool? It isn’t like he wants everybody to know they’d snogged last night. For one, Harry is sick of everybody knowing his business, and secondly, he isn’t going to go and draw more attention to himself than he already has, especially when everything is still so uncertain.
Harry blushes darker. He hadn’t considered that anyone was still awake when he’d gotten back and desperately tries to remember whether or not he’d cast a
Harry feels like it's hard to speak again. "Ron, I- it's Draco. I love him. Still." He rubs a tired hand over his face, half-heartedly wiping away tears. "And he doesn't love me back."
But this time it wasn’t accusing or worried. It was Hermione smiling up at him saying, “I’m really happy you and Draco are friends now Harry.”
They finish showering quickly after that. Draco is no longer interested in looking at Potter’s chest, or arms, or back or arse. Instead he dresses quickly, putting his shirt on first and making sure his arm is completely covered.
“Not even her Blaise. I mean it. You two aren’t together yet, you don’t owe her this. It’s not your secret to tell.” Draco looks at him. “Make me an Unbreakable Vow.”
the letter onto the blank parchment and readies both of them to be sent. He makes his way to the Owlery and drops his letter off to the Auror from Christmas, Keller, with a grimace. He doesn’t know what exactly the Aurors do to check their letters. Do they read them or merely cast spells to somehow see if there’s anything nefarious in them?
Something almost like sympathy sweeps across Narcissa’s face at that. “Of course. I can’t imagine- losing a child like that.” She glances at Draco and then clears her throat, eyes landing back on Harry. “They have our condolences.”
Draco tries not to panic but does a bad job. “So, um, I’ll see you in Potions later?” He asks stupidly and this time he blushes.
If the Headmistress is surprised she doesn’t show it. “Well that’s fine then.” Again her eyes go to the portraits and Dumbledore winks at her. When she turns back she is decidedly less stern looking as she abruptly asks. “Would either of you like a biscuit?”
“You owe me for this, Weasley,” is all he says before grabbing his cup of tea ungraciously. “Now finish telling me about this case.”
“Oh, you two are too funny!” She teases. “It’s a wonder no one else has found out you know. From what I hear you aren’t exactly subtle, what with your flirting and your touching.”
“Right. See you, Potter.” Draco draws himself up and nods, but Harry steps after him as he moves away, one hand reaching out to stop him.
“I can come with you-” Ron begins but Harry shakes his head. He needs to sort out his thoughts, and as much as he wishes he could do that with Ron, he knows he can’t. Not if he’s going to keep this secret.
Draco collapses against the desk and doesn't move for several minutes, staring blankly ahead while he cautiously feels his swollen lips with his fingers. His entire body feels numb and he can only sit in his frozen state, unable to process the last hour.
“Did you show up here so early because like me you wanted to stake the place out and mentally prepare for seeing each other again?”
“What, an orgasm was all I needed to do it successfully? Sorry to burst your bubble Potter but I’ve been giving myself those for years already.” Draco turns to lie on his side and face Harry too.
Harry stops to stand at the side and Draco takes a deep breath before moving past him to lie down. He watches Harry as he gets himself comfortable and in sudden inspiration sweeps his robes off to throw them away.
Draco’s been up here since then, of course. Many times in Seventh Year, when he’d needed time alone to think, when he’d been particularly maudlin or scared. He isn’t sure whether he’d done it as punishment to himself or not, but eventually this tower had become… not exactly welcoming or comforting, but not something to be avoided anymore either.
“You didn’t?” Draco asks but doesn’t wait for a reply. “You would have had to kill me before I’d admitted it, but yeah. Despite him being a Hufflepuff.”
“A bit much with all the red,” Draco finally declares, moving over to Harry’s bed, seeming to somehow, inexplicably know it’s his. “But not bad. I suppose there are worse places to sleep.”
Circe. He stops for a second at the sight of Harry turning around from looking outside his office window. The wizard’s clothes are wrinkled, his skin is still flushed and his
He looks up and meets Draco's eyes. "I owe Draco Malfoy no debt," he says, and Draco's mouth thins. "Just like he doesn't owe me one. We're square."
“Huh.” Harry frowns again as if sorting several things out before shaking his head a bit. Draco’s eyes are drawn to his messy hair and he can’t seem to make them look away even if he wished it. “Anyway, that’s not really my question.”
Ron blows out a long breath. “That’ll go over well. I don’t think he’s forgiven her for what happened in our Sixth Year.”
He hopes the overwhelming gratitude and love he feels is clear in his tone. Draco hopes that whatever is on his face is enough to show Harry just how much this gesture, tiny as it may seem to anybody else, means to him.
Draco squeezes his eyes closed and when he speaks his voice is a whispering tremble. “That was- you couldn’t have, we’d only just- it hadn’t even been a month since we’d first admitted that we might fancy each other.”
Lynne is grinning wickedly. Harry shoots her a pointed look but it doesn’t ease the way she seems like the cat who caught the canary.
She giggles. “Who do you think you’re talking to? I thought I proved to you years ago that I can keep a secret. If it’s important.”
Draco swallows, something that's suddenly very hard to do. He imagines facing Hermione and Ron the next time they show up with the others, seeing the judgement on their faces- or worse, losing their friendship altogether. He can just picture Luna finally looking at him with the hatred he's long deserved from her. Draco can see the confused worry from Pansy, and even the scoffs that he's a bloody idiot from Millie and Theo.
Harry huffs. "Like you said, I did grow up with Muggles. I'm sure I can pass Third Year Muggle Studies without too much help from Hermione."
He knows he’s taking too long to answer. The uncertainty that creeps into Draco’s expression is plain to see and the nerves Draco is obviously feeling makes his voice shake as he asks.
“You forget, Narcissa, that I taught you and your sisters at school. I know better than to be particularly charitable.”
But they’ve always been foolish too. Things had never worked between them, no matter how hard they’d tried. One of them always ended up hurting the other.
.” Draco says forcefully. He is not enough, he knows he’s not enough. Not forever. Not for Harry. “There has to be something else.”
“Do you really think so?” Blaise asks her. “You can just… put it behind you, rationalize it all, just like that?”
“A’right ye great beast, I hear ye! Down now, Fang, down! Honestly.” Hagrid’s great bearded face appears behind the open door and he looks down at them in surprise. “Hello, you two. Had we arranged a visit?”
Harry, whom it seems has not looked away from Draco once. Harry, whose eyes are lit with something dangerous that Draco wants to bottle and keep forever, a moment of joy for him to have and take out whenever he needs.
Draco blushing is quickly becoming one of Harry’s favourite things to see, and the blonde pointedly begins climbing again, leading the way now. “Don’t be ridiculous.”
It's nothing he hasn't heard before. Over the summer the Malfoys had received some spectacularly worded letters at the Manor, none of which had been very pleasant.
He ignores the slight falter in Draco’s step, only slowing his pace slightly until the blonde falls into step beside him once more. They’re quiet and Draco fidgets as they stand on Hagrid’s step and Harry knocks on the door, both of them listening to Fang bark from inside.
Harry laughs again and hits him good-naturedly, but for the rest of the day he seems lighter, and when they eventually leave Godric’s Hollow later Draco can’t help the small smile playing at the corners of his lips.
Harry doesn't say anything. He stands there, seeing Draco breathe in deeply as if in pain, and then he nods shakily, stumbling away and towards the fireplace.
“And I would appreciate it if you could take this seriously, instead of just laughing at how inept I am in this area. Believe me, it is humiliating enough without you rubbing it in.”
Draco nods and goes and puts his study notes away, wondering how on earth he’s going to talk to Harry about all of this.
There’s still a nervousness there, even now, and Draco feels his heart twist with guilt and anger directed at himself for putting it there.
Knowing Draco he’d probably already cast one on the way in here, Harry thinks. Stupid, prepared prat.
The words are spit harshly and Harry rears back from them a bit before his eyes narrow. “Look I get why you’re pissed with me but I’m trying to help in the only way I know how, alright? I know what this feels like, believe me. I know it sucks but I’m trying to help.”
“Uh, okay.” He swallows more tea than he’d meant to, burning his tongue. His eyes water and he resists the urge to cough.
More gasps and whispers surround them until Kingsley silences everybody. The woman beside him continues. "How do you know this, Mr. Potter?"
And maybe others would say it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks, at least not strangers; and they’d have a point.
There’s no sound in the bathroom for at least a minute until Myrtle speaks. “Did he kiss you back last night?”
That’s a Muggle sport reference. Draco doesn’t entirely understand it, but spending enough time with Harry, Hermione, Seamus and the others have at least made him comfortable enough to know he’s used it correctly, even if it’s only in the safety of his own mind.
He’s finished in the bathroom and slipping under the covers when Draco finally comes in, closing the door behind him and waving a hand to light the lamp on the table beside his side of the bed.
“Yeah. Mostly them. We both knew that it would be a big topic in the press, that Draco was already under enough scrutiny and fire, and after what happened when it came out that we were just friends… well neither of us really wants a repeat of that. And it’ll be a thousand times worse when people find out we’re seeing each other.”
Things don’t calm down much after that. Narcissa also testifies on behalf of her son and, apart from her hands shaking, it is quite an intimidating testimony.
“I asked a lot of people.” Draco says. “Hagrid was the biggest help. And Molly Weasley and McGonagall.”
“Maybe.” Draco crosses his arms, the blush getting darker, before immediately straightening them again. “I wanted to see you before you left for Hogsmeade with the others.
“I…” Harry trails off, not sure what he’s thinking except for one thing. “I just really want to kiss you. You look… really great.”
Draco draws up short and Harry sees the shutters come down in his eyes. He visibly watches Draco tense and sees his defenses coming out. It’s so obvious to him, the way Draco puts up walls.
Harry grits his teeth, spinning the bottle forcefully, feeling torn between wanting it to land on Draco and wanting it to land on anybody else.
Draco rattles off the details and Harry thanks him before committing them to memory. Then Teddy is coming over to grab his hand and pull him over to the door so they can greet the kids set to arrive any minute, and Harry looks back at Draco to see him already smiling at them.
An air blankets them both, wrapping around the two of them as they take in the stonework. Draco wonders if the statue is carved from a picture. The faces of Harry’s parents seem eerily accurate, the expressions on their faces are soft and loving despite the rigidity of the stone.
Friendship with Draco Malfoy might have explained why Harry went up to Smith the next day and told the wizard that if he aimed another spell at Malfoy he’d have more than the Slytherins to watch out for. It would explain the nights he and Draco spend at the library, poring over books that normally would make Harry want to rip his hair from his skull. And it would be a good clarification for why the next day Harry had sat beside Malfoy in Potions and started talking about Quidditch, immediately letting the moment from the night before remaining unspoken. Blossoming friendship with Malfoy might even be a good reason Harry suffered questions and talks from Ron, Hermione, Ginny and basically all of the Gryffindor Common Room.
The look on Harry’s face is pain, it’s the only way Draco can describe it, and as their eyes hold he knows his is the same. His heart pounding is the only thing he can feel, and Harry is the only thing he sees in this tent full of people.
“Oh I will,” he scoops her up with an exaggerated groan and with one last kiss to Harry’s cheek carries her upstairs. “But I think your brother has been left alone for too long. If the two of us bother him he’s bound to come out of that room of his, what do you think?”
But had he really? He’d gone into this entire thing skeptical and unwilling while being unable to say no. And he’d kept on ignoring Harry until they’d suddenly been doing the complete opposite and, it seems to Draco at least, spending every spare moment together. As much as possible if he is being honest.
Draco pulls his hand away. “My parents are nothing like his were. If I’m better than him, if I’m different- then it’s only because my parents were there and they love me. Otherwise I could have ended up just the same. Look at Aunt Bella.”
They stumble over to Draco’s bed and he has to groan at the sight of Harry laying back on his emerald covers, fulfilling a lot of recent daydreams he’s had. When Draco straddles him Harry lets out a sigh, relishing the contact of their clothes sliding against one another, their hard cocks grinding against each other through layers of clothing.
Harry gives a wide-eyed look of panic to Draco who just waits until she’s done. He knows Myrtle, maybe better than any of the other students. All she really wants is somebody to listen to her.
“Mate what world are you living in?” Ron sounds insulted. “In no universe are owls a better companion animal than cats.”
“Who knows anymore,” Pansy says before downing her sixth drink. “I’ve given up trying to understand them.”
Blaise had braved asking him while they’d both been sitting in the Gryffindor Common Room. Harry had been doing some reading from Potions and feeling like he’d rather fight another dragon and Blaise had been waiting for Ginny to come down so the two of them could spend the morning together.
Ginny's eyes close wearily before she moves over to the couch to wrap an arm around his shoulder and bring him to her, holding him while he shakes.
But Malfoy just stares at him, looking down at the blank parchment on the desk and then back up to him.
Potter shrugs. "We have a test coming up soon," he says and Draco internally panics again because, yes, alright, he is not ready for this Muggle Studies test coming up on Wednesday at all. "I just thought maybe I could help you study for it and you could help me with Potions again. I still don't remember the seven different phoenix ash properties, and I’m completely lost when it comes to asphodel root."
Something in Harry’s gut twists and he hates it, tries to push it down, because he feels horrible about it. Really. He hates that he’s started to avoid his best friends and that sometimes he’d rather be alone than with them because he gets jealous.
As always, when he tries to imagine telling his parents, his mind hits a blank. He can’t picture it. Can’t even begin to imagine the faces they’ll make or the words they’ll say.
The second thing that made Harry aware of his new crush on Draco was the fact that in the changing room after their games of Quidditch, Harry had turned around, seen Malfoy’s bare arse, and immediately thought of what it would be like to bend Malfoy over the bench in the room and have him every way Harry could think of.
Grey eyes meet his once more. “I,” Draco stops, swallows audibly and then collects himself before seeming to think better of whatever he’d been about to say. “Thank fuck it wasn’t a ferret.”
"Oh?" Blaise asks while walking in a little further. "Big things happening in the world of potions?"
“I know.” He says gently. His plans for the two weeks are simple. He’ll stay at Hogwarts for the first part of it and then go to the Burrow around midday on Christmas and stay there for the rest of the holidays.
“Well it’s obvious you’ve made an effort.” His best friend smiles. “I like what you’ve done with your hair. Making it look messy on purpose.”
When Ron comes back minutes later he’s holding two cups of tea and is met with a glaring Draco and no Harry.
Draco butters another slice of bread and reaches for the jam casually. “Anything interesting?” He asks, feigning innocence as he nods to the offending item, and Blaise folds the paper and places it back on the table, purposely hiding the front of it.
that Draco hides away in Malfoy Manor now that he’s back in England, or that he rarely answers their friend's letters, fire messages and Floo calls. It doesn't phase him when he learns that Draco's working on a potion to help regulate people's magic, something that could greatly help hospital patients in controlling themselves in emotional and stressful situations. And when he accidentally hears Pansy whispering to Millie that she'd found not one but two men leaving Draco's room one morning, he walks right past, pretending he hadn't heard a thing instead of throwing something at the wall like he'd wanted to do.
Luckily it’s a decent day outside, despite being January, and Seamus and Dean are out playing Quidditch. Neville is off working on an independent Herbology project with Professor Sprout. And since Ron is down with the others that gives Harry the dorm to himself.
“This is the cheap version,” Hermione explains. “Others had a replica of Harry’s wand, glasses, a wig… everything except Polyjuice basically.”
It is tidy though. A couple of small bookshelves are full, and a small staircase leads to what Draco suspects are sleeping quarters. The walls are mostly covered in portraits and a feeling of ice washes through Draco as he is unable to stop his eyes from wandering when they all sit down.
Draco huffs out a laugh. “What am I ever mad about? The fact that your side is seen as flawless when you’re not. They
Pansy’s still right though. If he runs again then nothing will change. Maybe this is what they need, maybe Harry’s right. If Draco works with him maybe he’ll finally be able to convince himself that what they had is gone for good and never coming back. Maybe he can move on.
Harry notices. “I told you, it’s not a gift. Or I guess, it would be more of one to me than you. But back in Fifth Year, when we had Dumbledore’s Army going, it was one of the spells I taught the others. It was something… I’ve never had that feeling except when I was teaching them all. I was really, really proud of it. And so were the others once they’d done it. I guess I just… wanted to share that with you.”
Draco holds out a hand and Harry looks at it for only a second before downing his drink and taking it. The other wizard grins and squeezes his hand lightly, finishing his own drink and
As they’re leaving the Great Hall to head up to the Gryffindor Common Room for a game of chess the four of them pass two younger year witches talking to one another.
For one, half of the blokes there are already well on their way to drunk and it’s only 10 o’clock. When Harry and Ron walk into the dark club there’s lights bouncing off the walls, strobe lights flashing on and off seemingly at random, and Harry can barely make out anyone’s face unless he’s within a couple of feet of them.
It takes barely a minute and the boys drop their hands immediately after. Draco actually slumps in relief.
"Harry is very passionate," Ginny says. "But he has a hard time showing it. With you though... it was always obvious, right from the start. You got under each other's skin in a way nobody else could."
“And here I thought you were past being a git.” Harry chides before pulling away. He’s wearing a brilliant smile on his face. “Fuck my gift is going to be shite compared to yours.”
He doesn’t even give an excuse to the others, he just leaves, heading to the dorms and hoping that someone will think to gather his books for him. Truthfully those are the least of his worries right now, what with everything he’s just realized weighing heavily on his mind.
“Obviously. That was the aim, you see, to leave it undiscovered.” Draco feels the blush on his face. “I shouldn’t have told you.”
Draco doesn’t kid himself. It’s different because it’s Harry, and for years Draco has been dreaming of a moment like this for more than half of his life.
“Fucking finally.” Harry says and then he’s pulling his fingers out, stroking himself with them once, twice, and lining up his cock with Malfoy before pushing in slowly.
And Draco sighs. He knows what’s going to come next. Usually it’s when he’s taking off his clothes and forgets to hide the Dark Mark that people figure out exactly who he is and run, but tonight nothing seems to be going his way. “Yeah.”
Draco doesn’t let his attention linger. He watches Harry avidly, taking in every bob of his Adam’s apple, every twitch of his fingers. The fire is making him warm, which isn’t helping his damp palms. “We should.”
Ron must sense the rising tension in the room because he inches towards the door. “Think I’ll grab a cuppa. Want anything, Draco? Harry?”
"No," Draco says evenly. "I do. It's everybody else. They would talk. He would be shunned. Despised. Slandered. And eventually he would have gotten sick of it. Of the looks sent our way, the remarks and the discrimination. And if not then he still would have been an outcast. Life wouldn't be a walk in the park. He would blame me and if not then I would blame myself and I couldn't live with that, I couldn't, it would have wrecked me to make him so miserable."
“Maybe,” he agrees. “I really am sorry though. About everything. You deserved a lot better from me.”
Harry gulps, mind racing, trying to think of something, anything, that he could get Draco to do. Something that won’t make Harry have to readjust his robes. "Um, finish that bottle of Firewhiskey."
“Sure.” Draco says to him before finally giving in to his own excitement and turning to the others while waving with a huge smile. “Goodbye you lot. See you soon.”
Lydia nods. “My best friend is in Hufflepuff you know. She’s at home for Christmas but she’s really nice.” Her mouth turns down at the corners. “She was nervous around me at first. Everyone said at the start of the year we couldn’t be friends because of our Houses. But now it’s okay, isn’t it?”
Draco doesn't turn around, all excitement for his friend vanishing. "I don't want to talk about becoming friends with Potter, Blaise. If that's what you came here to do then-"
But there is still that part of him that wants to go the distance and really impress Draco. To do something subtle that says, yes, this is for you. Do you see? Do you like it?
So he’s definitely physically attracted to Draco, but it’s more than that. He gets that jealous monster in his chest now around Draco, like he used to with Ginny and Dean. But this time there’s not really anything to be jealous of apart from the fact that Draco is single and anybody who gets their head out of their arse and realizes what a triumph dating him would be has the chance to do so.
We're almost done you guys, I can't believe it. I have the sequel finished and it will be ready to post in its entirety the week after I finish posting this story. Thanks for sticking with me so far, I hope you enjoy!
“It wasn’t something I expected you to do. It wasn’t something I would have expected anyone to do for me. And it made me think that maybe you didn’t hate me like I thought you did.”
“Here.” He hands the cloak to Draco, pushing away the tendril of nervousness he feels at giving it away. “It’s an invisibility cloak. The best one there is. No one will find you if you have it.”
By the end of the meal it’s combination of eating too much and laughing too hard that has Harry’s stomach hurting pleasantly but he doesn’t mind. He’s finished his cider and is just finishing his hot chocolate and sticky toffee pudding when Ron finally pushes his own plate away with a groan.
Her eyes are wide and excited behind her glasses as she glides to hover a bit in front of him. “You’ve been busy, I hear.” Her expression turns sly. “Girls love to gossip in bathrooms.”
It's what he wonders when Millie comes by with Theo in tow, both ignoring the state of his life and his house and doing their best to take him out with the others.
Since then he’s been taking things one step at a time. First getting through the summer and recovering from the war, then the school year. Then he got all these new friends and Draco, and it’s been easy for him to stay distracted and focus on the present.
“It’s mostly come about with you being friends with Potter, Draco, if you’ll believe it,” she says one night a few days after he’s arrived. “You’re my son, the heir to the Malfoy name. You’re choosing what direction our family takes now, and personally I’ve come to see that you’re on the right path. Especially now that you have Potter’s ear. Your father was never sure where we stood with the Dark Lord, nobody ever was. He could change his mood at the flip of a coin. But Potter- that boy is loyal beyond anything else. If you have him on your side it will be hard to lose that.”
"It's the only secret he's ever kept from me, and he looks so sad, Harry, anytime I've ever mentioned it." She sips out of her glass and he studiously ignores her gaze, instead looking at her new wedding ring. Plain but expensive, that's obvious enough. Very tasteful. Very Ginny. "And you've never told us either." Harry opens his mouth but Ginny just shakes her head and keeps talking. "We've always wondered, you know. Because that kind of thing... I've never seen people go from being child-hood enemies, to friends who were practically inseparable and then become... totally ignorant like you two have. There's always been something between you, everybody knows that, whether it was hatred or the friendship you had. But since Hogwarts you've both just been..."
He nods, hoping to help, and definitely not wanting Ron to change. “She’s right.” He says before he grins again, unable to help himself.
“Oh and what is he meant to do? Telling her that his secret boyfriend wouldn’t like the two of them talking so she better bugger off? Come on.”
“Roses.” Harry finishes for him, spinning to take in the sea of white, red and pink. “I can see that.”
Draco looks back down and flips a page in his textbook. "There was a sudden lack of people in our train compartment on the way here."
“Oh, I’m sorry, were you wanting me to get yours for you?” Pansy feigns ignorance and goes on talking loudly in that high-pitched voice that is making Draco want to hide under his pillow to drown it out.
"I agree with what Harry said earlier." Luna finishes. "Draco is not evil and he shouldn't be put in Azkaban. He did what he had to and he did the best he could. In his place I'm sure many of us would not have been so kind. He was in a much more difficult position than I was in the war because his family had already picked his side for him. Draco was just never able to tell them it wasn't the side he wanted."
He’s all for people acknowledging and making up for his mistakes but Draco’s done all that, hasn’t he? He’s done all he can and Harry’s tired of watching him feel guilty over the past when everyone else has forgiven him ages ago.
Draco watches them closely, more surprised than he can ever remember being. For Pansy that apology had been practically begging.
Everyone seems to have decided to get absolutely plastered so when Harry and Draco get there (a bit late, but nobody really notices) they’re well behind in the drinking category. It doesn’t stop Draco from getting them each a cup of
, is the hunger being held at bay between them. There is an oceans worth of lust here being held back by a dam that only lets it flow out steadily in a small trickle. To let it all go at once would consume them immediately.
She shrugs. “No. I don’t like him personally, but like I said before. The two of you… well. You’re alike, in a lot of ways.”
"And this summer you were so busy with everything, the trials, all those funerals, we barely saw each other. Even now, sometimes, you're so lost in your head you don't realize that we're here." She smiles at him. "You need someone to bring you out of your thoughts, Harry, to keep you present. And that's not me."
She shakes her head. “They need to start slowing down. Honestly, every weekend they’re inviting Ron and I out, and every Monday Dean comes to work and tells us those stories… well you know, you work with him.”
Hermione frowns again but Draco changes the subject before she can say anything. “Excited for Hogsmeade you two?”
She shrugs. "Well, yes, Harry, and please don't be upset. We never told anybody else. It's just we thought you both ended it since the school year was over and Draco was leaving for France. Neither of us realized you two were still in love."
The Slytherin has already released several new potions that has helped Healers across the world, and many of them are helpful with uncontrollable magic. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to ask him to come in and consult on the case. Harry can always get Ron to pose the question.
"Right then," his best friend mutters. "Tea- I- Mum always said- tea sounds- I'll go and put the kettle on, shall I?"
But that will all be sorted out later. Right now Draco is content to let Harry sleep, letting his own eyes drift shut again and moving infinitesimally closer to the other boy until they’re just barely touching.
Snowflakes have begun to fall softly and he looks up, bags gripped tightly in his black finger-glove clad hands. The moisture is cold and wet once it melts but he can’t help but stop and take in the moment.
“You saved the world.” Laleh counters and Harry shifts uncomfortably, meeting Draco’s eyes, slightly desperate.
The trials haven't been his only public appearances since the end of the war either. McGonagall had asked him to come the first day the reconstruction of Hogwarts had started, something Harry would have done anyway, to raise awareness. Kingsley had asked him to visit the Ministry a couple of times so the press could get pictures of Harry Potter showing his support for the new government. Even though they'd just spent the time drinking tea, eating biscuits and talking about pretty much anything except the current political situation, it hadn't stopped Harry from feeling slightly used.
“Surprise.” Draco grins and steps back to let them all trail in, one after the other. First it’s Theo who is shooting him glares, mind obviously working to figure out what is going on. Millie follows, head cocked at Draco who winks at her, unable to hold back a smile.
“And what? You think she’ll give a damn? You think anybody would?” Keller shakes his head. “You and your family are finished. You’re nothing. It’s time you learned your new place in the world. Nobody cares about your lot anymore.”
He has been to the Manor a couple of times before. Once had been an experience Harry never ever wants to repeat. The other… it had been nice.
He ducks his head, arms holding Harry protectively and wondering if he’s helping at all. Hoping he is.
Draco's breath leaves him and he suddenly looks so shaken Harry wants to reach out in comfort when it take him a few seconds to compose himself. "I already told you, Harry." He seems to struggle to speak. "Back that day in Hogwarts, I told you-"
“Look,” he makes an effort to soften, to reach out and touch her elbow lightly, “I’ll speak to him. Today, later, whatever. We’ll sort it out.”
The natural result of all of this is the Eighth Years having parties in the Room of Requirement almost every weekend. The week after Halloween they have one as a belated Bonfire Night celebration, even though Hermione and Harry are the only ones who actually know who Guy Fawkes was. The next week they gather with the excuse of Remembrance Day, and this time it’s just Draco who doesn’t know what that day is for.
“You’re sleeping better now than you were in Sixth Year though,” Harry interrupts his thoughts, and Draco blinks.
Draco flinches. "What do you want from me?" He whispers. "You want me to hurt you so badly you break, Potter? You're feeling particularly self-destructive today? I’ve already told you it’s over."
“Harry.” Draco’s voice is a silky caress against his ear and when Harry feels Draco’s lips brush against the sensitive flesh he can’t help but let his eyes flutter close.
“No, let me say this.” She searches his face. “I know we raised you to prioritize social standing and politics, and I don’t think you should entirely forget that. If you manage to carve a comfortable space for yourself in both of those areas then it will make life much, much easier for you Draco, which is all your father and I want for you. An easy life.” She breathes out deeply. “But I fear we were so worried about that, given who we served under, that we’ve forgotten to show you it’s okay to value anything else.”
“Yes!” He cries, pulling up and waiting a few seconds for Harry to do the same. They are both almost vertical in the air, Draco gripping the small ball strongly, eyes locked on Harry’s. “I did it,” the Slytherin says, eyes wide. “I got it.”
And there's the fan mail, the hate mail, the critics and the theorists who think he's interested in what they have to say. He's heard that some people think he's still got the dragon from Gringotts chained up as a pet in his backyard; then there was that one bloke that had even said he'd hired Voldemort to elevate himself to fame.
“Of course, I was.” Draco replies, his voice brittle. “I was only home for Christmas and Easter holidays.”
Harry knows he can't keep going, not the way he is. Soon somebody will try and slap some sense into him.
“He’s dangerous for you, Draco.” She’d said while squeezing his hand gently. “You forget to think when Harry Potter is involved.”
“I will not have wet snow tracked all over this kitchen, thank you very much. Now where’s Ron got to with that ham?”
Draco turns back to the fire and thinks over everything. But ten minutes later his mind is at ease and whatever had upset him before is gone, blow away like petals in wind.
“Fuck you, Potter.” Draco actually has the nerve to sound hurt. “Of course that’s what I said down there around the rest of them but don’t be stupid. You were supposed to say no!”
"Nothing." Harry stabs his sausage and ignores the burning in his eyes. His throat feels like it's closing up and he swallows to get rid of the feeling. "Nothing at all. Pass the jam would you, Ron?"
Because later, when it had been just them, Draco is sure Harry had been waiting for him to kiss him again.
“I thought I was the one getting you off?” Draco murmurs against his lips and Harry smiles, tracing Draco’s cheek lightly with his clean hand.
He and Draco walk hand-in-hand down the road to the town’s center, a square lined with a few businesses including a post office, a few stores and a church. The church is small and unobtrusive but beautiful in its simplicity. Draco sees the beginnings of the cemetery behind it but quickly looks back in front of them when Harry stops.
Narcissa sits on one side of it. Draco waits, looking at Harry, so Harry slowly takes the love seat, hoping this isn’t some sort of test. Draco hesitates again, glancing between them both, before sitting on the other end of the sofa his mother is on.
Harry would have done the same but as his team scores goal after goal in rapid succession he’s pretty sure he doesn’t need to.
So with that little nugget of faith things come to a head at a party one week before Christmas break.
“That’s alcohol for you darling.” Their eyes had met and she’d grinned, though it still lacked her usual bite. Seconds later her expression had sobered and there had only been concern on her face. “You’re alright though, aren’t you? Being friends with him is enough?”
“Actually I’m quite comfortable,” Harry says conversationally as his hand slowly rubs back and forth. Draco continues to harden embarrassingly quickly, or at least it would be if he hadn’t felt the beginning of Harry’s erection all the way back in the bathroom.
The tenseness in Harry’s posture disappears and he lets his shoulders drop, managing a genuine smile. “You’re welcome.”
Harry feels a great swell of discomfort and resolutely does not think of Dobby, or Sirius and Lupin, or his parents.
“You did that wandlessly before,” Harry murmurs as they lie back against Draco’s sheets and Draco frowns, trying to remember.
“We’re doing Secret Santa now,” Luna says, handing out shots to everybody. “Drink these and at the bottom there will be a sweet. Suck on it until it dissolves and the piece of paper left over is who you buy for. Does that sound alright?”
Which is ridiculous, if you think about it. But Draco’s tired of thinking about it and overanalyzing everything. He was ready to ignore Harry or avoid him today to side-step any awkward or hurtful conversations about last nights party, but Harry just came right over and sat with him at breakfast.
Draco blinks, feeling tears in his eyes, and looks over to the fire to try and hide them. A futile move, because Mother undoubtedly sees them, but she allows him that.
“I mean it,” he whispers, eyes searching Harry’s for an answer Harry doesn’t know how to give. “You deserve all the love in the world.”
Harry feels the need to fill the pause. “Erm, but the house is fine. I’m cleaning it up some more. Sirius tried-”
They’re here now, aren't they? Isn't that enough? They’re friends and- and maybe building towards more than that, can’t that be all they need? Why do they have to rehash everything? It makes Harry's stomach twist even though seconds ago he’d also been thinking of the things he needed to get off his chest and that the two of them needed some time.
He misses all of them, but he can’t lie to himself and pretend that not talking to Harry doesn’t bother him most.
By the time the others find them they’re in heated discussion that is halting simply because the two of them cannot stop laughing.
Draco doesn’t blame Harry really, but of course he doesn’t say that. It’s not like he’d been any better in Seventh Year after all.
Blaise’s face goes serious in a moment before he makes his expression carefully neutral and hands over a drink. “No, I suppose not. Though being on the other side isn’t any more fun, I can promise you that.”
“We’re going to do a Secret Santa too.” Neville joins their conversation. “Since tomorrow’s a Hogsmeade weekend we’ll all buy the presents then. Limit is 20 galleons I think.”
Draco laughs and spreads his arms slightly. His metallic gold robes shimmer in the dim lighting somehow, and with his arms raised Harry sees the illusion of fluttering wings. “No, Potter, I’m-”
Even that isn’t enough now. Everyone is talking about what they’re going to do with their futures. Hermione is taking a year off to work on some magical creatures charities before joining the ranks of the Ministry. Harry’s heard rumours of Kingsley sending her owls, but whenever he asks Hermione she just blushes and changes the subject.
Ron stops as soon as he realizes Harry is watching him. "Well, I don't disagree with him there, Harry."
Her pointed nose still sticks out to him, and her lips are pressed into such a thin line he wonders if she isn’t already finding him lacking. Like he’s the bad smell under her nose now.
He stops beside his bed, takes one look at Draco and the haphazardly packed trunk and raises an eyebrow. "You're being an idiot."
He gets up every morning (well, usually in the morning, he’s had his bad days in the past) and lives his life. He has a routine and he sticks to that routine. It's something that's helped him to be so successful. Draco stays in regular contact with his superior, has good relationships with his parents, and sees his friends at least twice a month. He’s only just gotten home from his six month stay in France a week ago, and since then he’s been too busy to pay much attention to anything.
Blaise sounds tired and a bit nervous when he speaks and Draco stops to crouch down by the bed. “Yeah?”
“It might.” Harry knows to keep his voice calm when Draco gets like this and works to ignore the frustration coming back from earlier. “At least it will be something different, right? A new way of looking at things. Maybe that’s all you need, a step back, give you a better sense of what you’re doing.”
“That was nice of her. Defending Severus.” Draco feels a bit awkward, not sure what to say. He feels like this is all very important, this information, but to be honest he’s not very surprised. He also thinks he would have hated James Potter in school. He sounded like everything Draco had always thought Harry to be.
“Yes.” Draco’s mouth twitches. “Hagrid helped me get quite a few and then said I should ask McGonagall for some of Dumbledore since he only had the one of the two of them for me to copy. And I suppose she must have asked a few other teachers to see if there were any others you might like. This was the only one she got, I think, but I figured I might as well put it in there.” He flips a few pages. “That one of Moody was from an old
Ron shrugs, chewing on a chocolate frog. "They probably wouldn't want to make too much of a scene though, don't you think? My dad said Lucius barely batted an eye when they came for him, it looks like they're trying to be..." He frowns and nudges Hermione sitting beside him. "What's that word you used?"
“I’m so in love with you,” Harry sighs and slumps into his mattress, going entirely limp. Drunkenly he whispers, “I’m sorry. I wish I wasn’t.”
Draco supposes that’s what comes from growing up without parents all your life. He suddenly feels absurdly protective of Harry and makes a fist when the urge to reach out and touch him briefly fills him.
“Alright, calm down.” Theo says to them before turning to Blaise and pointing at him accusingly. “You fucker, how many times did I tell you I thought they were shagging? And every time you convinced me I was making things up.”
Draco looks down and swirls the remaining alcohol in the glass tumbler. "Just... forget it, alright? There's no point telling them now when everything's done and over."
But Ginny breathes out a little sigh of relief and Blaise definitely relaxes a bit once the words leave the red-haired wizard. Ron looks between them in astonishment.
“It’s in the Room of Requirement, at nightfall, on Halloween. Of course.” She smiles, takes his hand, gives it a squeeze. “It’ll be fun. You can invite whoever you like.”
Draco hesitates, glancing quickly at the portraits one last time before meeting the headmistress’ eyes. “Thank you, Professor.”
“Perfect.” Pansy says with a smile while Ginny gives Blaise a smug look. “Rules are we spend around 10 galleons but no more than 20, because come on, we don’t really like each other that much.” She winks at Neville who sputters, making everyone else chuckle. “No telling who you have to anybody, no asking for hints, that kind of thing. Tomorrow’s a Hogsmeade day so you can buy something there, or order it or make it, whatever. No one cares, just come up with something for our Christmas party next Friday. Got it?”
A long low whistle meets that answer. “So what then? He’s such a good fuck you’ll protect him like this?” Draco says nothing. “Or…”
"And I think I just- I got so used to missing you, to not having you here, that I forgot what it was like. To have you here. I forgot what we were like when things were okay and after the war it just- nothing feels the same." She looks up at him nervously. "Does that make sense?"
But he can't help the question that comes from his lips. "That's it for you and the Weaslette then?"
“No, it’s a bit different.” Draco corrects. “You’ve… mussed it all up on purpose now. Or something.”
“It seemed like that for me too.” Harry confides. “From the second my parents died adults all around me shaped my life. Voldemort. Even Snape. And Dumbledore. I understand why he made a lot of the decisions he did, I just wish… I wish some of them could have been different. His first choice to send me to my relatives totally changed my life. Those are years I’ll never get back and experiences and memories I’ll never have a chance to make.”
Harry shakes his head, the energy from before still rushing through him. He can’t sit in a classroom right now because his magic will explode out of him if he doesn’t do something. Something physical.
The headmistress sighs, but she still looks fond. “I would remind you again Albus that I’m running the school now.”
Harry blushes and Draco stops beside him, feeling unsure. Their eyes meet, each other them searching the other until Harry nods and Draco smiles reassuringly.
With one boy too proud to forget and another too overwhelmed to stop- or even realize- what he's started.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione’s tone was so happy Harry had blinked in surprise. “Of course they’re not. Or- I mean they are. Important I mean.” She’d smiled and Ron leant forward to clap his back. “And we’ll try, Harry, we decided we’ll try to get along with him. If you want. If you want him to- to spend time with us, with all of us, I mean, well… we’ll try.”
What the fuck? He asks himself, inwardly praying the bartender will finally call on him so he can escape his embarrassment. Hey? After everything, all this time,
Harry glances back at Draco. "He didn't have a choice, just like a lot of us didn't in the war. He did what he had to so that he would survive but- but he didn't kill Dumbledore. And yeah, okay, he took the Dark Mark but does the kid in front of you look like a Death Eater? Really?"
Ron groaned as Harry laughed before asking Hermione for her notes from classes earlier. And as she pulled them from her pocket, ready and neatly copied, Harry knew he’d never, ever find better friends.
His nose is touching Draco’s now and their lips are so close to meeting Harry feels every nerve ending in them, tingling from the wait.
“That’s the one, Harry!” Draco agrees, not even bothering to his laughter now. “Good man, how did you manage to remember it so well?”
With the son of Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy already there, being the first Hogwarts student and wizard his age that the famous Harry Potter ever meets.
“I won’t tell you not to try,” he says, watching his friend’s face as Blaise focuses on him, obviously on tenterhooks while waiting for what Draco is about to say. “You should do what makes you happy, any one of us will tell you the same. And I can actually imagine the two of you together without it ending in a flaming disaster, which is more than I could say for you and anybody else.”
It feels like Harry moves as slow as a snail when he pulls himself away to stand straight. The brilliance of his proud smile makes Draco’s heart beat painfully.
“Well you weren’t saying anything!” He defends himself before Draco can speak. “You’ve been friends with him longer.”
They start with Potter trying to explain electricity. Draco does not understand it at all and Potter begins laughing at him when he asks whether petrol makes telephones work like it does automobiles.
Harry’s heart is beating quickly where Draco’s pressed against him, and he’s whispering disjointed fragments of sentences that Draco half-hears so they don’t make any sense. “…do, you know… this year’s been mental but…Merlin, how do you not
For the first time since this conversation began Draco meets his stare. His face is still blank. “Do whatever you like, you always have before. It’s not as if I can stop you.”
He wakes up to the green curtains of his four-poster, surrounded by his duvet cover, and feeling nice and comfortable and warm. His heart is beating fast and when his brain finally kicks into gear and the memories of last night come back to him he turns to lie on his back, staring up at the bottom of Blaise’s bed.
“Pansy, I’m sorry for last night.” He breaks in, cutting her off. “I was an arse. But I told you all after Hogwarts, I want nothing to do with him. Alright?”
“I know.” He takes a deep breath. “And I do want to learn how to cast one. It was a brilliant idea for a gift.”
Harry takes him in standing there, half behind the door, tone slightly hopeful, mostly apologetic, and somehow all of his anger and pent up emotion from the day leaches out of him steadily to be replaced with calm.
Harry is sitting there in stunned disbelief. He’s following the conversation, but it all seems surreal.
“No.” The word falls between them like a wall. “I never,” Draco cringes, as if the words have escaped without him wanting them to. “I never even thought to.”
“A party. For Halloween.” Potter looks almost embarrassed as he avoids Draco’s stare, resolutely hiking up the hill to the school with his broom over one shoulder. “Luna told me about it. She said I could invite whoever I wanted and-”
“Draco.” Snape’s voice makes him look over at the old Headmaster, though he hesitates. Snape looks the same as ever in his painting and a small part of Draco settles as he gathers the courage to get up and walk a bit closer, checking to see that Harry and McGonagall are still lost in conversation.
They get to the Manor and Draco is leading Blaise to the spare bedroom when his friend suddenly asks, “Did you have a good night?”
Hermione murmurs something that sounds assenting, but she speaks too quietly, and Harry is too far away to hear her clearly.
“I want to kiss you.” Harry admits and Draco’s embarrassment ebbs a bit. “But this is where I first kissed Cho and somehow that seems a bit awkward.”
“I know, sweetheart. I didn’t mean it like that, I just meant- if we can’t be here for you when you need help then who is, Harry?” Harry stares back, the words obviously having an impact. “I know you struggle sometimes. There are nightmares, and the whole world watching you, and the weight of our futures… I know it gets to you, I see it on your face, in the way you hold yourself. And I want you to know I’m here for you when it comes to all of that.” He swallows. The last time he and Harry had closeness like that was around Christmas, at the Potters’ graves when Harry broke down. He and Harry haven’t shared a bed since and so he doesn’t know if Harry’s nightmares are better or not. “It would be a beautiful privilege for you to allow me to help you. To have you show the world you need other people sometimes too.”
He clears his throat, forcing himself to look away from Draco for a second, breaking eye contact as he stares at a point near his shoulder, and then unable to help himself as he looks back into the grey. “How are you?”
“Right, gotcha now.” Hagrid nods consolingly. “It’s a bit difficult ain’t it, knowing they’re in there, but it’s not really them.”
“You love her,” Harry retorts automatically while still smiling like a lunatic. “Really? Everything?”
“Absolutely.” Blaise says. “Potter here was just asking what it was about Hagrid that made him so much more interesting than all of us milling around in here, and you know, I didn’t have an answer. What
“Yeah.” Draco eyes him again, this time in consideration rather than concern. “Where’s this come from Blaise?”
Draco just presses his face into the crook of Harry’s neck and breathes in deeply, feeling the silent tears fall down his own face.
The other boy is telling him the story of how he and Ron stole Arthur Weasley’s car to fly to Hogwarts in second year when Pansy’s shout draws their attention to the other side of the courtyard.
It pierces Draco how worried Harry had been about it. It hurts him a little bit and makes him feel guilty for the stupid stuff he’s done in the past, but mostly it makes him angry at everyone and everything that’s ever made Harry feel like he wasn’t worth being with despite all the headlines and rumours.
The Slytherin had looked thoroughly unconvinced and thrown a rolled up piece of parchment at him before they’d finally gotten down to studying. Miraculously Harry is actually starting to understand the Potions reading without needing to ask for help and Slughorn has given him several happy looks. Nowhere near Sixth Year level, but close enough for Harry to be happy. He might have been doing even better than Ron.
She raises an eyebrow. “Anyway. We should go in, we’ll be late.” Once she sees he’s not moving to follow her she turns around. “Coming?”
“Oh no.” Ron groans and drops his face into his hands as Harry and Hermione begin to smile widely. “You git, don’t say it. You didn’t.”
doesn’t matter that it had felt like Harry had stared at Draco for most of last night. They’re friends. That’s what mattered.
She frowns a bit. “Yes, that must seem confusing, mustn’t it? But you know what it was like back then. The Dark Lord was back and living in our home no less. There wasn’t a chance we were going to expose you to him in that way. And if we’d won then I’m ashamed to admit it now dear, but you likely wouldn’t have had a choice. Not from the Dark Lord or from your father and I.”
Thinking that this is the first year he's gone to Hogwarts without his father to send him off by his mother's side.
“And secondly, I’m not attracted to any of the ponces here in this dorm, and Salazar forbid I propose having it on with someone outside of Slytherin.” Draco gives Harry a silencing look but it isn’t necessary since Harry doesn’t accuse him of anything. In fact his expression doesn’t change from one of simple curiosity. “Not to mention none of the other blokes in the dorm are gay. And that brings me to my third point,” Draco swallows at the sudden nerves he feels. “No one knows I am.”
He doesn’t say anything but he does move back further so their sides are pressed together and she can lean on him ever so slightly. Her resting her head on his shoulder isn’t out of the ordinary, they’ve casually sat in far closer positions before.
“And the Dark- Voldemort himself showed up to try too.” Draco murmurs. He remembers hearing his father’s frantic whispers to take care of his mother as they’d hugged quickly before the guards had dragged him away when Draco had gone to visit him before he’d been sent to prison for the first time. Remembers hearing his mother crying occasionally when he’d taken it into his head to go sit with her awhile. He’d cried himself to sleep that school break, more than a few times. “I hated you that summer, you know.”
Something warms inside of Draco but he doesn’t say anything. Instead he takes a last drink of orange juice. “When do you want to ask McGonagall?”
The elation disappears from Harry’s face and he takes in Draco, eyes searching and seeing everything in his expression. In usual Potter fashion he cuts right to the heart of the problem. “Your parents?”
"Well I hope you haven't been worrying about this all day," he says, aiming for teasing. "When honestly there's nothing to even worry about. Blaise wouldn't be too happy I'm sure."
“Um,” that hadn’t been what he’d tried to do at all but if it looks alright then he supposes it’s fine. Honestly he hadn’t noticed much of a pay off from his attempts at fiddling with his hair, not enough for anybody else to pick up on, but he supposes Hermione is just observant like that. “Thanks. I feel a bit ridiculous to be honest.”
Harry’s fingers twitch restlessly. He’d never told Draco about being one of the reasons Slughorn had come back. It hadn’t seemed particularly interesting or important after Sixth year and besides, it probably would have been another part of Harry’s fame that made Draco wrinkle his nose in distaste.
“Another Christmas present?” Harry teases, nerves in his stomach and Draco’s lips twitch up into an unplanned smile.
“I don’t know.” Harry replies, still at a bit of a loss. “I didn’t have a chance to think of it before you mentioned it. Now I guess I’ll think so because you said.”
He wants to tell him why Harry coming back was stupid and that he was fine being in the castle alone all day. He wants to pull Harry close and kiss him breathless and whisper thank yous against his skin because it’s been a long time since someone cared so much about his happiness- it’s been a long time since somebody’s happiness was so entwined with Draco’s own. Draco wants to name this growing feeling inside of himself but finds he’s too scared to do it, so all he can hope for is that Harry just knows, that Harry can just understand him like he’s always seemed to know Draco. If Harry can just figure him out without Draco ever having to say the words it will make everything so much easier.
“Who needs help?” Harry asks smugly from where he is straddling Draco on the bed. “You’re the one lying there helpless-”
Even through all of that Draco had known he’d had a crush on the Boy Who Lived. It’s his biggest secret, the thing Draco has ignored about himself for years and worked tirelessly to hide from everyone else.
Blaise’s eyes shoot up to the top floor of the leaning Weasley house and Draco nudges him. “Don’t even think about it. I’m not letting anything mess this day up, not even a Muggle superstition about seeing her before the wedding.”
Draco's bare skin jumps under Harry's palm. "Never let me be that stupid again. Merlin, I don't know what I was thinking."
Obviously Draco, he wants to roll his eyes at himself. Harry has been having nightmares for years, way longer than him. Of course he would have tried sleeping potions already.
“Why are you so sure I am?” Draco presses. “I thought you knew what this was. We tried the relationship thing years ago and it didn’t work. Give it up. I don’t want to be with you and you sure as fuck aren’t making yourself seem any more desirable by panting after me every time we see each other.”
Draco is watching Ron closely and once Hermione finishes he speaks, voice low. “It will be a hard Christmas for everybody, I think. Perhaps even worse than last year.”
He clears his throat and delicately picks the paper up by the corner, staring at the picture and trying not to give anything away with his facial expression. He expects he fails.
“It’s not about that,” Harry says in frustration. “It’s about- about who you are. You think I’m with you because of your cock?”
They certainly look happy enough together, Draco notes, despite what Potter had told him a month ago. He wonders if Ginevra has turned out to be the girl that can get Potter unstuck out of his own head after all.
His friends used to bring Draco up sometimes, since his friends are now Draco's friends, and the two of them used to be the core of their merged group. Hermione would tentatively mention the new potions the other wizard was working on, Ron would talk about Draco’s flat in France and Ginny would tell him stories of nights out he had with her and Blaise. Pansy would drop one liners here and there and Theo would always, always, without fail when they would go out, ask if he should invite Draco along with them too.
"Oh, perfect," Malfoy grumbles under his breath and Harry resists the urge to nod and agree. He doesn’t want to give Malfoy the satisfaction.
Draco only laughs and mounts his broom. The Quaffle is already tucked securely under Lynne’s arm and Cory flies off to hover in front of his side’s goal hoops.
Harry sucks in a breath and looks at Blaise, who is watching his wife closely now and definitely not looking at Harry. "Is it really?"
His eyes can’t help but be drawn back to Harry and he manages to catch a sight of the unruly hair and find him clapping harder than anyone around him. He’s grinning and this time he definitely notices Draco looking because his face grows into a wide and bright smile that makes Draco’s nerves disappear.
“I suppose that’s our cue.” He says and she gives him a knowing look but doesn’t call him out on cutting the conversation short.
She pulls her hand away and scratches at her wrist, frustrated, and Harry finally meets her eyes. They look sorry, but not necessarily sad. He wonders why that doesn’t bother him.
By then Harry has outstayed the time he is allowed for a break, also typical, and gone up to make them both cups of tea. When he comes back Draco is muttering to himself unhappily, holding his wand over some of his notes with a frown.
Lynne is watching Draco. “You fought on the other side, though. I remember seeing you around school last year. With the Carrows.” She tilts her head. “My parents know yours, from before. Through my dad’s work at the Ministry. They were friends.”
He doesn't reply to the letter he'd gotten from Blaise the day after he'd arrived home. It had only been two lines, but Draco had cast an
“And I love you too.” Harry continues stubbornly. “I know what we feel, this is as real as ever. Why are you still running from this?”
"Right." Ron says, bringing Harry back where he sees his best friend eyeing Luna shrewdly. "So, you two, you're friends then?"
“But you want us to keep doing it anyway. I can walk beside you in the hallways but not too close right? And we can share a seat in a Common Room but I can’t sit on your lap. I can’t run my fingers through your hair, or kiss you, or even hold your hand.”
Still, he doesn’t get the chance to tease him about it as they leave breakfast with Ron and Blaise. Blaise had come back from Hogsmeade looking particularly pleased, and though neither he or Ginny have said anything to any of them, Draco is willing to bet his family’s last Galleon that something happened between them, even if they still aren’t officially together.
“I’ll be spending my Christmas at St. Mungo’s for a bit, with my parents and Nan.” Neville says making Harry look over. “And then we’re both going to Luna’s.”
“What do you mean?” Draco feels as if he’s been thrown off his feet. “I told you. There’s someone I want to be with, if he’ll have me. I won’t pretend for you and Father any longer.”
He’d immediately tensed and tried to pull his hand away, but her grip had tightened enough to be painful and kept her hold. “Why wouldn’t I?”
The two wizards exchange a look but before Draco can refuse or do anything the bartender is placing the two glasses in front of Harry and looking at the blonde expectantly.
need to do that now and somehow they end up spending their nights together. Whatever nervousness Harry had felt about it had disappeared when they’d stayed up half the first night together talking in the dark and laughing until they couldn’t keep their eyes open anymore.
Harry swallows once more. "Right." Again, he chances a glance at Malfoy only to find him staring at Harry with helpless realization across his face. "Malfoy-"
Laleh raises a hand timidly. She is the Slytherin from Fourth Year. “I’m alright with Draco and Harry being team captains.”
He sees Draco swallow. “Yes, there is. I’m done lying to you, Harry. I mean it. I know it’s a lot to ask for but if you believe anything from tonight please believe that.”
It’s a good thing that it’s the week before N.E.W.T.S. because otherwise Harry isn’t sure how he and Draco could have pulled their behaviour off convincingly.
“You would.” Harry says firmly and everyone looks at him in surprise, maybe at the vehemence of his tone. “You would. Or you wouldn’t have had the chance because we’d all have been dead. None of us would have stopped fighting, ever. Death is all that could have waited for us. But all of you,” he looks around, “you might have made choices you- all of us- regret, but in the end you made the right one. And we know that can’t be easy. Us sitting here with you is just as surreal to me. But the way I see it, I’m tired of fighting. I don’t want to do it anymore, especially not with any of you. In the past we hated each other. Fine. But it doesn’t have to be like that now. Both sides have to be willing to forgive each other, not just one or the other, because that’s not how we get peace.”
“I was coming right back,” he defends himself and then holds out the mountain of clothing in his arms to Harry. “Take your pick.”
Crabbe’s death had hit Goyle the hardest. Everybody had known that. Only Crabbe had been unable to see that Goyle was in love with him all this time.
“Because your dad’s in Azkaban.” Harry says quietly, ready for the question, and Draco falls silent. He’s been thinking about this a lot, the unspoken things between them, the words that need to be said. The air between them is thick. “And I helped put him there. Because your mother gets death threats every day and can’t leave the Manor. Because Aurors have to screen your mail and you’re not allowed to finish your school year without people trying to attack you in the halls.”
Before, back in First Year, Draco had thought he had Potter figured out. Thought that the wizard was just a spoiled celebrity who’d let the fame go to his head. He’d assumed that Potter had thought he was too good for Draco, for Slytherin, for everything in the magic world.
“It is a bit.” Draco laughs but he sounds nervous. “I haven’t met him yet but I think over Christmas he and Aunt Andromeda are coming to the Manor.”
Draco stops taking the piss long enough to consider it. But the idea is so daunting he can’t think about it for long.
Still, he won’t bring it up if Harry doesn’t first. Maybe the other wizard has forgotten? Or thought about it and realized it’s too much too fast. Especially since Harry hadn’t gone so far with Ginny and they’d been together much longer.
He’d turned around and walked right back out, never mentioning it to Draco and hoping the blonde hadn’t heard the door close behind him. If Harry had been more snappish and irritated than usual that day nobody else had known why.
“Me too. Or- I feel the same. About being around you again.” Draco stands abruptly, leaving his cup on the desk as he hurriedly steps out from behind it. Harry is too surprised to move but his hand does let go of his own teacup and lets it settle gently down on the wooden surface. Draco’s eyes are roving over Harry’s face as if desperate and the air between them changes.
Which isn’t strictly a lie, but it makes Harry grin and shake his head at him when nobody else is looking.
“Harry!” Hermione comes over and wraps him in a hug, flushed from dancing. Her light blue dress reminds him a bit of the one she wore to the Yule Ball and her hair is braided in a fancy updo that highlights her face. She’s grinning in a way that lets Harry know she’s at least tipsy. “What are you doing over here? Oh, hello Mr. Chester.”
The angle of their hips changes as their lips meet and Harry jerks in surprise, making both of them gasp. But it’s good; whatever Harry just did felt really fucking good.
But this feels different, what Harry’s just done. It feels big, like a permanent shift has happened between them and there’s no going back now. Not only has Harry just proved by coming out after Draco to the entire school that the
Draco nods, feeling thoughtful, distracted with the new information. “That does seem to make the most sense.”
"Draco." Pansy just looks at him and he tries to stare back but- well anybody going up against Pansy in a staring contest is a right fool. She's impossible to intimidate.
“No way am I snogging you, Potter.” He says and Draco glares back at him as he steps forward after regaining his balance and straightening his robes, stopping to kneel slowly in front of Harry and coming back to where he’d been two minutes ago.
“None of that, Weasley,” Draco tosses another slice of apple in his mouth. That’s his second one now, Harry notes. “Maybe before the war you had money as an excuse, but I happen to know for a fact that since then you and your family have been bombarded with interviews, book deals and merchandise plans. Not to mention Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes is killing it with income. You’re almost as rich as I am at this point.”
Harry kissed him- enthusiastically, one may say. He grabbed Draco’s arse. Maybe it was to make the others stop laughing at him about being a prude like he’d said, it was possible. But maybe not.
There are a few times the two of them get close to slipping. Once when Draco is working on a potion and Harry walks in, unannounced like usual, only to see Draco bending over the cauldron to check the smell.
It’s still early but his tears are finally gone and a bit of hope simmers inside of him. Grabbing it and trying to hold onto his earlier bravery he makes his way up the stairs to the top floor of the Manor and knocks on the door leading to his parents’ bedroom.
“Lovely.” Hagrid fills and puts the kettle on. “Right then, what have you lot been up to? I saw a trail of ye making yer ways down to the Quidditch Pitch.”
He swallows and blinks. “But Draco… he’s scared. And I’ve been thinking about why. Just because I love him doesn’t mean things will work out. His parents,” Harry grimaces, “I don’t know them like Draco, or like you either, probably, but what I do know…”
“Oh did you?” Draco replies, moving forward. Lily appears in the door behind him and Harry winks at her quickly which makes Draco smile briefly. “Why am I not surprised?”
“She did, in Fourth Year. But in Fifth Year…” Harry trails off, looking unhappy. Draco can’t help but admire his persistence and simultaneously feel a bit at ease from knowing that while he’d jealously been thinking that Harry had been getting the attention of every witch he’d wanted, he’d really spent most of Fourth and Fifth Years pining after Cho Chang.
He skips his father’s abandoned study- a room more recently used by Voldemort than Lucius anyway- and they’ve already seen the living room, the greeting parlour and the hallway that runs straight through the main level. He points out the few bathrooms on the floor, waiting while Harry uses one, before finally pulling him outside to show him the gardens.
Draco pulls away, to breathe or to say something about the water- which is closer to scalding than merely hot- but Harry stops him by quickly working to pull those boxers down, struggling through it even though they’re quickly growing soaked and beginning to stick to Draco’s skin.
Blaise is the only one who never mentions Draco around Harry, and it's funny because Blaise is the only one who Harry wants to hear news about Draco from. Blaise would know what Harry really wants to ask, about how he's really doing, but Harry gets nothing. He'd cling to any piece of information from Blaise he'd hear, but Zabini never says a word about the Malfoy heir.
His face feels hot and his blood is roaring. Draco knows that they’ve gotten away from what they were actually talking about and this has devolved into something else, but that doesn’t make these things any less true. Just because the propaganda he was taught was wrong doesn’t mean he’s the only one who’s been a victim of it. The idea of a purer and holier-than-thou Dumbledore is pure shite. Black and white thinking is bollocks, and Draco wishes that people could realize that sometimes. To realize and understand that he’s
Strangeness? Maybe, he supposes. Harry can’t say he’s ever thought about it. But when he searches himself he honestly finds the idea of Ginny dating doesn’t inspire much more than friendly curiosity in him.
Then again, McGonagall had always had a different sense of style and décor than Dumbledore. Anyone could have told Draco that.
Challenge flares in Harry’s belly along with want, and he surges forward, catching Draco’s face between his hands, pressing their mouths together and shoving his tongue into the other boy’s mouth, searching and searching for something Harry didn’t know he wanted. Draco lets out a deep sound and his arms move up to Harry’s shoulders, resting there, gripping them for balance. Harry pulls Draco in closer, grinning at the startled sound it produces, and now instead of silence there are only cheers and laughter from the group around them.
“Yes.” Draco’s voice is a bit stiff now. Because he’s anticipating a negative reaction from Harry or something else, Harry doesn’t know. “He didn’t get a lot of time off from the Ministry. And sometimes it was the only time I went home during the school year.”
“Well when you two snuck off barely an hour into last nights party the only rational explanation we could come up with was that you’d gone off to shag.” Blaise speaks bluntly while Theo grins wickedly and looks down at his nails. “Nearly gave Ron a conniption.”
I am so sorry, I thought the Harry/Manor visit was this chapter but it is next chapter and this is a quick little conversation between Draco and Narcissa instead!
“You if you don’t say yes.” Harry pecks his cheek and backs away slowly, arms out to hold Draco up from stumbling. “You did already agree to this.”
“Hmm.” Draco falls back into silence and Harry looks back up, lost in his own thoughts as he stares up at the stars.
His heart is hammering and Harry decides that he hadn’t been lying after all. He could use a nap. Last night he had stayed up late sneaking around with Draco, and while he doesn’t regret it, it means he’s more tired than usual.
“You wish!” Harry calls after him as Draco speeds away to search the other side of the pitch. He can’t stop grinning and his eyes stay on Draco for longer than they should have really, considering he’s in the middle of a game.
In fact, he’s almost reached his breaking point and decided to just throw it all to hell and talk to Draco and to fix things when Blaise interferes.
Draco shakes his head. "So tonight we're all going out for drinks, I assume? To celebrate?" He moves to go back to his letter, dipping the quill in the ink pot before beginning to write again.
“No,” Draco says with a small tremble in his voice. “But we came up here for a reason. You’ll have to leave for Hogsmeade soon.”
They leave quietly, heading to the Slytherin dorms by silent mutual agreement. They should be empty, Draco assumes, hoping that he’s right.
Luckily his family had connections in other countries in Europe and certain options have been waiting for him all his life. Before it would have been expected for him to do something in the Ministry- maybe even an Auror too, or as an aide to the Minister, or for him to be an Unspeakable. With everything that’s happened those aspirations are gone, but he still has his talent and passion in Potions to fall back on. He’s more than his family’s name and money- there is a smart head on his shoulders too.
Draco feels it like a blow. Unable to say anything he just leans forward to kiss Harry slowly, lingering, trying to memorize it in case- in case-
Ron looks surprised. “We always thought that too.” Harry nods with the others. “Us Gryffindors felt like we had to step up for people to accept us. Prove ourselves, that kind of thing.”
“Yes it is. I believe only two letters were forged but as they were of an extremely personal matter to Draco. I would like to know who is responsible.”
Draco nods and moves towards the fireplace, grabbing the green powder with determination before stopping. He turns around to meet Harry’s eyes.
There is only about a foot of space between them. Twelve careful inches that Harry could reach through and break with barely a thought.
“Of course.” He says and then heads to the door. “I’ll let Ron know you’re in. He’ll finish debriefing you and show you the workroom we’ve set up. Again, if you need anything…”
"Why did you apologize to Potter yesterday?" The question is out before he can stop it, but Pansy just shrugs.
He’d caught himself but Harry had looked curious and rolled over to take Draco in, head propped up by a hand. “Want what?”
“What, Harry?” Draco eventually asks, voice defensive. “Merlin, you’d think I’d spat in Hagrid’s shoes from the way you’re watching me. I thought you liked that I was getting along with him now.”
“Yeah.” Harry scuffs a shoe against the rug in Draco’s room. Draco wonders if he thought the snake design on the edge of it was too much. He’d never thought so until now with Harry standing in his room. “The Death Eaters were chasing me at the beginning of last summer. She got caught in the crossfire.”
“I suppose this is goodbye.” Harry says and if Draco isn’t mistaken he looks unhappier than he had a few seconds ago. “You’ll let me know about visiting the Manor?”
He trails off, still avoiding the weight of her gaze. “And even during the war, he didn’t let me die, Molly. He saved my life. More than once.”
Draco turns back around to Pansy, inwardly cringing at the look she is wearing as she glances back and forth between the two of them.
"I realized how much of a shithole this school is." Draco snaps. "Our House Elf could teach me more than these old bags."
Harry's face is burning. "I just didn't want to talk to him was all." He says, and he wishes it was the truth. Merlin, how he wishes it. He glances over at Draco again to see him talking to Ron and Hermione- probably because for once today Harry isn't at their sides- and the clawing in his stomach pierces him deeper. "Our friendship," his mouth twists on the word and he wonders what his face must look like right now because he's never been very good at hiding his emotions, "didn't end well."
“Hmm.” Draco casts his thoughts back. “So Voldemort picking you over Neville was just his arrogance then?”
Something hurts, in the center of his chest, and Draco takes a deep breath before looking up and meeting Potter's eyes.
"Oh, Harry." Hermione's voice is so sad Harry squeezes his eyes shut harder, trying to block it out.
He thinks but that’s about it. Probably stupid saying all of that anyway, of course Hermione would make sure Harry was okay. “No. Thank you. Good night. I’ll see you at the wedding next weekend.”
“No.” Draco shakes his head and grins suddenly. “To tell you the truth, she probably just wanted to make you feel bad a little.”
Draco pauses, keenly aware of the many eyes from pictures on the walls that are watching him. He glances back over at Harry and sees him stroking Fawkes’ head, unable to help relaxing and smiling a bit as he looks back up. “I’m good. Really good.”
Fifteen minutes later he knocks on Draco’s door while telling himself that his willpower is the most pathetic one in existence. He is disappointed in himself both as the leader of this investigation and as a man.
“Oh Draco.” She looks so sad. “Don’t be daft. Like I said, I’m happy for you. Both of you. Merlin knows how I didn’t put it together before.”
Blaise’s expression clears into a happy smile. “Ah, that’s alright then. Keep talking me up, Mil, I do appreciate it.”
Sympathy hits Draco hard and he reaches out to take Harry’s hand, uncaring of what witches and wizards might have been watching. He has the
The surprise comes from something else, an unknown source, and it makes him sit rooted in his chair, staring at the paper before him.
That particular morning Pansy isn’t speaking to Blaise or Theo, which means she is only talking to Draco and Millie. Which means she’s making a very pointed effort to talk loudly, quickly and nonstop to Draco and Millie so that the boys will notice she’s not talking to them.
at another man without remembering moments from Eighth Year. It could be that Draco's been doing so well lately at forgetting about Potter- he manages to go about half a day at a time now, occasionally, without being reminded of the Saviour- that this sudden reappearance of him in Draco's life (not even in his life, really, just indirectly there, at the edges of it, always) sends him reeling back to cling at stolen touches and moments. There's the possibility that it's even something Draco ate for lunch just an hour ago that's causing this discomfort. That’s making him feel sick.
But Draco has never asked him to. All Draco has ever asked for from Harry is forgiveness for himself, never his family.
When Draco had finally been unable to bear any more of Potter’s hatred he had run to Pansy so that they would both be able to leave. The relief he’d felt at seeing her standing in the entrance way to the tent had been overwhelming.
He thinks of roaring fire, flames and heat licking at his back, making him sweat through his clothes. He thinks of pressing right against Harry on that broom, barely making it out of the door as the fire chased them.
Even then he can’t quite seem to focus and be totally present. They all must notice his distraction but apart from Ron’s knowing look nobody gives any indication of it.
“Finally.” Ron is grinning widely with a flush on his cheeks and Harry suspects his liquor cabinet has been invaded a bit by his best friend. “Thought you’d gotten lost up there.”
Harry shoots her a smile. She is more than capable of checking the time herself but Harry has always allowed Lily small indulgences.
"What do you mean an extreme case?" Harry breaks in, asking Hermione before she can reply to Ron. "About me and Malfoy."
"She’s the one who ended it." Potter says, surprising him. "But I'm... not upset. Not really." He takes in a breath, looking at him quickly before going back to fiddling with his quill. "I know I should be, but it doesn't seem to matter. After everything that's happened."
The defense wizard clears his throat. "Yes, we would like to call Harry James Potter to be our first witness."
“And I’ve noticed the influence the two of you have had over the attitudes here. Not just the attitudes of you and your fellow students, but the staff and some parents as well.”
“I know, Draco. Like I said, you’re actually doing better than I thought. And you’re learning it awfully quickly. It took me ages to get used to wizard stuff.”
Harry, who Draco notes has not been reading his book for several minutes now but instead has been staring at a point on Draco’s face near his chin, shoots his eyes up to meet Draco’s gaze. “Huh?”
“I mean it.” He says simply, looking up to catch Harry’s eyes. “I like them. My first Muggle clothes. Now I can insult you in front of Muggles too. Widen my audience.”
“Come on, let’s tell Molly that Harry’s here.” Hermione grabs her boyfriend’s elbow. “Coming you two?”
"For goodness sakes, Ron," she says and Harry pulls away slightly to blink wetly at them. "Sit down."
“Morning Harry,” she greets warmly, blinking at him a bit sleepily. “Kettle’s just boiled if you want some.”
Harry Potter is left frozen and staring, surprised at the last dig. What the hell does he mean, better than what Harry's doing? How would Draco have any idea on how Harry's doing when-
A few more seconds tick by with Draco not knowing what to say. From the looks on everyone else’s faces they feel the same way.
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you in daylight before.” He says, scrambling for a way to bring up his problems without seeming like a complete liar. “You look nice.”
“Yes, well, no need to tell the world,” Draco shifts uncomfortably in his seat which makes Hagrid laugh.
It doesn’t stop her from reacting to Draco’s presence with clear dislike however, so he’s studiously looking at his Muggle Studies textbook, trying to take in the words on the page and hoping she doesn’t stop by him.
Harry can’t really say the decorations appear any different than last year to him but he’s too busy looking at Draco to join their conversation.
Maybe some of what he’s thinking comes through at that because Blaise softens slightly. “Alright. I suppose I shouldn’t be pressuring you. It’s just that I hate to see you like this when you could so easily be happy.”
“Wait.” Harry ignores her last sentence. “You’re saying that the letters Draco thought he got from you both… they were fake?”
Draco decides the only way the two of them are going to get through this is with several more large drinks.
Harry immediately tenses and he knows Draco notices because his eyes open and he looks at Harry curiously.
Draco presses against her more strongly for a moment and doesn’t say anything. He hears the lie in her voice.
It’s a few more seconds before whispers break out and Draco looks back towards the Gryffindor table to see Potter, his two sidekicks and the Weaslette bent over hissing furiously to one another.
The other wizard’s gaze is heavy on him but Harry doesn’t look up. “I see. So you’d be willing to carry on as you have been then?”
This is his chance to get all of that. He can have everything back, all of the good from Hogwarts, and gain everything that is new and exciting from since then as well.
But there's an all-consuming tightening in his stomach that twinges painfully at the sight of the picture, so he knows, if he's being honest to himself, that that's not right.
He wanders the room and socializes for a while, spending a good part of the night catching up with Thelonius Karlton, his old mentor. After gaining his Masters in Potions Draco hadn’t had a reason to stay in as close of contact with him and before Draco knows it they’re falling back into their familiar age- old debate of whether harpy talon or centaur hoof is the better ingredient for
He shoves his notes in the space between them. "Well, you'll want them," he snaps, sounding condescending to his own ears. "Given that in the questionnaire we all took yesterday you failed every single one relating to phoenix ash."
Malfoy doesn’t seem to mind Harry’s wet cheeks either, because after a moment of hesitation he’s leaning in to enthusiastically kiss Harry back. Before Harry knows it Draco has pulled his hand away from Harry’s only to bring both of his up to cup Harry’s cheeks and gently swipe away the remnants of his tears.
“I don’t know if Ron’s been, but I was down yesterday.” Harry confides and then looks over at Draco who appears more than happy to stay out of the conversation. “And Draco has apparently been visiting most of the week.”
“Go, Harry.” Draco looks down at the floor and snatches up his trousers, tugging them on before he turns away as if he can’t bear to even look at him. “Please.”
home, he knows. The wind is picking up a bit and there’s a chill in the air. A blanket of grey clouds hide the sun in the sky and he casts a
"You're breaking up with me because of- because of the press?" Harry's voice cracks but Draco stares at him stone faced.
Draco cringes internally, wondering how he could have been so stupid. It is obvious from Harry’s tone and face that the memory is uncomfortable but Draco had pushed anyway. Because, well, he’d never thought Voldemort and the others would go after Harry’s
“Say Potter, nothing’s happened between you and Draco has it? Only he’s been in a right mope lately.”
“That’s right.” Ron says, purposely ignoring the teasing. “Now go on and tell me what you lot have ever done.”
It’s sharp and insulting and Draco regrets the question immediately. Harry’s eyes narrow and a familiar set comes back to his shoulders that automatically has Draco reacting in kind.
Right, Draco thinks as she moves to stand beside Harry, the two of them falling into conversation. Harry had told him about being rescued by Dumbledore’s phoenix. After he’d killed the Basilisk that was slowly rotting away beneath them in the school to this day.
“If the world doesn’t know then we’ll just keep getting more of today.” Harry waves a hand to encompass his meaning. “You standing on the sidelines having to watch me come up with excuses and say no every single time someone asks me on a date. When it come down between being together or not… I don’t care. I don’t
“I just… I want to be allowed to be proud and love my family for the good things. Nobody’s born completely corrupt, not even Father. And I just hate to see my parents labelled the way they are because it’s not- that’s
It takes until the early hours of the morning but by the time they fall asleep Draco knows all about Harry’s Seventh Year. He knows about the horcruxes and Harry even mentions the Deathly Hallows, something Draco had always thought was a kids story. His father had heard things about them being real, and he’d heard Harry’s words during his duel with Voldemort, but Draco had still always dismissed it as lies.
Maybe, Draco thinks. This year is loaded with pain and bad memories but there is also forgiveness. The knowledge that he is working to be better and that he has a group of people who believe he can be.
And though Draco knows he’s being foolish he doesn’t care. Later when they’re ready, the two of them clean themselves and get dressed to go to the Gryffindor Common Room, where the others are likely gathered. When Harry is distracted Draco swipes his Gryffindor tie and shoves it under his pillows.
He and Harry had kissed for nearly an hour in the Room of Requirement before they’d gone back to their respective dorms. It really had been just kissing, but Draco still feels like everything he knows has come under question. The most daring thing they’d done was move from the armchair they’d been on to one of the couches and Circe, having Harry Potter underneath and then on top of Draco had almost been enough to make the night very embarrassing for Draco and his sadly neglected cock.
Draco moves forward quickly, and before Harry can even close his eyes, he feels a hand gently cover his cheek, feels a thumb stroke away a strand of his hair, and then Draco pulls him in and Harry feels his lips, soft and warm, hesitantly cover his own.
Then dessert is cleared and someone is up on stage announcing the award and his mother is beaming at him. His stomach is twisting a bit in anticipation, but mostly he’s going over his speech again and again in his head, trying to make a mental list of everybody he has to thank.
His own cock is twitching again but Draco ignores it. Harry is what’s important now, and more pressing than anything is the look on Harry’s face. His breathing is heavy and his muscles tense before his eyes fly open again wildly and Draco feels and watches as he orgasms, watching his mouth falling open in bliss.
“Well that’s alright then,” Draco says as Harry’s hands slip under the waistband of his trousers, making him moan.
Hermione will be busy with Kingsley, Harry knows. And Seamus and Dean are on holiday for two weeks in Spain. Parvati and Padma are likely busy down in the Department of Mysteries doing whatever it is those two do. They’ve never been allowed to tell him and Harry honestly hadn’t bothered to really ask before.
Harry hopes he isn’t blushing harder. “How can you tell? You and Hermione, you both have eagle eyes, I swear.”
“Yes,” Draco sighs and he pushes up against Harry, too strung out to wait another second. “I want you now. Please.”
Harry blinks in surprise at having it laid out so neatly. “I guess. He just made me realize how big of a risk it would be for him. But that’s always been the case.”
Which reminds him. In frustration Draco moves his feet against one another to scrunch his socks down first one and then the second, leaving them somewhere on the sheets but too far gone to care at this point.
“Did you not think to trace the magical signature yourself?” McGonagall looks over in amusement. “It would have taken a spell to copy your handwriting, and your husband’s.”
“It’s just water,” he says in half-apology and Draco seems to agree because he hurriedly kicks the sopping pile of cloth behind him and moves to kiss Harry again.
And just like that the dam seems to break. Everything hits him, the smiles, laughter and touching from the Ministry party and the way he and Harry had gone around the room together, just like they would do if they were a couple.
Harry kisses down Draco’s neck, debating whether or not he should leave a mark before deciding fuck it, Draco can heal it if he cares that much about it in the morning.
“Yes!” Pansy exclaims, seeming completely genuine. “What could be more interesting than talking about all of our sex experience? Best times, worst times…”
.” Draco taps a finger to the side of his face questioningly. “What was the question? Could it have been the one where Luna asked what cause you would support with your newfound fame?”
Harry looks around, not drinking. Draco watches him and then leaves their shared drink sitting on his knee, a surprised glint in his eyes.
He’s also heard rumours that Kingsley’s personal aide, a lovely wizard named Herman, is retiring sometime in the next few years.
“I’m sorry. For what happened.” Draco forces himself to meet Harry’s eyes so he sees as his expression shutters into blankness. “And I came to promise that from now on I’ll be completely professional. You don’t need to worry.”
“You know.” Ron waves a hand absently, watching Harry with close eyes. Suspicion begins to fill him because Ron never looks at him like that. Ever. “You ever liked a bloke like that?”
Harry tries to see what Draco’s thinking but can’t. “I won’t kiss you again until I know you want me to.”
His team all nod, determination clear in each of their faces, and Harry releases the Snitch from the case, watching as it goes up and flutters away.
So far there’s no concrete evidence for Draco to point back to and prove Harry might not feel only friendship for him. There has been no grand declarations or gossip to suggest anything.
“I would say so.” Millie agrees pleasantly, taking a sip of her drink. When Harry gives her a surprised look she waves him off. “They said we couldn’t get sloshed and I know how to hold my drink. Just because the rest of you lot are bloody light-weights doesn’t mean I need to limit myself unnecessarily.”
The silver image of a fully formed bird flies up before turning to face them and hovering in the air, beating its marvelous wings to stay up.
He agrees, but then his eyes catch on Harry again as he is making his way over to them, leading the rest of the pack.
Something heavy fills his stomach and he looks back as Harry scrapes his chair back, his foot leaving Draco’s leg- obviously he’s had time to slip it back into his trainer- to get up and follow her.
Draco’s purses his mouth. “I’m fine.” He takes in their faces, noticing a bit of a tan on each. Where was it Hermione’s parents stayed again? Australia now, was it? “How were your holidays?”
“Thank you, Harry.” She says warmly, taking his arm and squeezing it gently. “You look nice too. I hope Ginny said something.”
“I don’t know where I fall. Nature against nurture.” Draco furrows his brows. “Probably a mixture of the two?”
Draco nods, imagining that night in the graveyard for only moments before memories of Diggory being chosen from the Goblet of Fire, defeating his dragon and winning the second Triwizard Tournament challenge overpower his imagination.
Draco tries not to wonder what that response means. Instead he just keeps speaking. “Father had this garden built for her a few years ago.”
“God, I want you,” Harry pants, and his voice sounds marveling and completely awestruck. Draco seems close to wrecked and Harry pushes his finger in, ever so slightly, making both of them let out quiet sounds of appreciation.
He rolls his eyes at Harry but listens as he talks away, listing the homework he has to do. It’s not much. Reading a couple of pages for Sprout, a few more for Flitwick. Draco only has the essay to finish but he’ll sit with Harry while he works. Maybe he’ll read.
“Oh I know what interview you’re talking about Draco,” Harry jumps in happily, holding back a laugh as Hermione looks at them both in exasperation, even though he sees a smile beginning on her face too. “The question where Ron said his first cause to support would be, and I quote, ‘updating the
“Nothing about war is rational.” Ginny says heatedly in reply, never looking away from him. “And once you’re stuck on one side that’s it. You don’t get any more choices. Or at least it didn’t feel like it then- maybe it’s different for the adults. But we were all made to decide as children. We fought when we were children. Nothing about that is rational.”
“I had a boring summer and had to read something to occupy myself. Subscriptions to magazines and newspapers were the easiest way to keep up with the outside world and I read quite a few interviews of yours.” Draco grins. “Don’t worry Ron, you sounded completely heroic in every single one. My particular favourite-”
Draco immediately moves closer as they walk a few paces behind her. “I’m so sorry- she knew you were coming, obviously, but I hadn’t planned on us spending time with her until Andromeda got here with Teddy.”
Besides he wants to go, mostly. He misses Draco, even though it has only been a few days, and it will be nice to see him. He’s curious too, to actually go there as an invited guest and just see how the Malfoy’s normally live.
“Ah, yes, the holidays are filled with so many difficult memories for being such a happy time. My family is buried at Godric’s Hollow as well, you know.”
Now they are lying on said bed, Draco taking in every detail as Harry watches. He sees as Draco’s eyes go from the Quidditch posters to the fireplace. Finally his eyes fall onto Harry’s dresser and he frowns, murmuring a
Hermione had done that thing with her hair again, making it straight and smooth so it would fall around her face without being bushy like usual. She seems to be wearing some makeup and Harry is struck by her eyes, never noticing quite how brown they were before. Her skin practically glows and the blue dress she wears is simple but elegant, hanging off her shoulder carefully and displaying her upper back while ending just above her knees.
“Well I don’t see you stepping up to the challenge, Weasley.” Blaise shoots back to him. “Unless you’re hoping Harry and your sister will see the error in their ways and change their minds?”
Draco nods. “Just Slytherin House, of course.” He stops. “I think most of them had a good time. Seemed like they wanted to do this again. With… everybody.”
The jealousy trickles away to be replaced by something almost like nervousness. There’s a fluttering excitement in his veins and Harry wonders if this is going to end up the biggest mistake he’s made since coming back to Hogwarts.
Soon it’s Blaise and Ginny, who have moved to sit together on the couch deserted by Pansy and the other Slytherins, and Harry and Draco who are still squished together on the armchair even though there’s more than enough room to spread out now.
. Something of Harry that he can hold on to and take comfort from while waiting for all of these pieces of their life to settle in place.
Draco's quiet for a couple of seconds before asking, quietly, "Why didn't you shake my hand that day on the train?"
“Fine.” Harry says easily, stopping for a second to check his own appearance. He doesn’t exactly relish the idea of Andromeda or Narcissa working things out because his hair is more of a mess than usual or his trousers aren’t done up right.
“I’m pretty sure you did.” Harry says. “Always waiting to ambush me in the halls, jumping out of trees, following my friends and I around after dark…”
Draco’s lips twitch but he is already smiling. Even so Harry sees him make a purposeful effort to frown and look stern as he pronounces while sounding deadly serious, “my arse hurts.”
“Oh, Potter.” Draco says, and for some reason Harry’s stomach tightens at the words. “You are so on.”
“No. Well, maybe, actually. It’s just… I guess I feel like maybe this was the point of it all. All those years of the two of us, the similarities, it was all to get us here.”
“Work it out!” Ron orders before closing the door behind them with what seems like an unnecessarily loud slam.
“Umm, didn’t she skip a step?” Neville asks and Millie nods, her cat ears bobbing with the movement.
It feels significant, somehow, Harry saying his name in that way in this moment and Draco closes his eyes briefly. But his courage is there and he won’t let it leave without using it.
“Bye guys,” Neville waves and then opens the door to slip inside. Draco waits until he hears the lock click before turning to Ron.
“I know.” Draco looks desperate. “Believe me, Harry, I know. I’ve been… the most horrible, heinous human being. I’ve tried to lie and push you away and it hasn’t been fair on either of us, but most of all you. I hurt you and I hate myself for it, honestly I do. I never meant for this to happen, I wanted a clean break because I thought you’d be okay but- but I never stopped loving you, ever.”
“Look mate,” Ron shifts uncomfortably where he sits on the couch beside Hermione, arm draped over her shoulders. “You’re free to do what you like, but not even the Minister himself could get me to step foot back in that place.”
She had stared at him for a while but he had watched her back. He was worried about her, had been ever since she started sleeping with Theo to distract herself from her feelings for Blaise. It was dangerous, what she was doing, not only for the boys, but mostly for herself.
The next morning when Draco wakes up in his four poster in his Slytherin dormitory he is torn between allowing the huge smile that’s making the corners of his mouth twitch or suffocating himself with his pillow.
“Perfect, thank you!” Teddy dutifully gets up to hug them both and say thank you and Ron claps him on the back.
“Either that or you’re both losing your hearing, which is concerning given you’re barely half my age.”
Harry isn't sure he likes what Hermione is meaning. "I wouldn't say- what does that have to do with anything?"
“I see what you’re saying about them being more comfortable, but Muggle clothing has so much more range! Have you seen their suits? Circe’s tits, I considered buying one for Theo just to have him walk around beside me every day in it. They’re
There’s a bit of anger in his eyes, but mostly something else, something Draco can’t read, and that makes him nervous.
“Potter came back sullen as anything, snapping at Weasley and Granger when they tried to ask what was wrong. He went upstairs to sulk not five minutes later.”
“Like Potter could handle me anyway.” Draco scoffs, breaking the tension and getting a few wary chuckles. “Okay, let’s move on. What time is it?”
“Oh.” Understanding makes him feel unbelievably stupid. And self-centered. “Ron, is this about you? Do you want to tell me something? To, um. Talk it out?”
“Stop.” Harry mutters eventually and Draco sighs but releases him. “I can’t last, not if we keep doing that.”
He steps back just as rigid and when he makes it to the door his hand fumbles to grip the handle which is something he hadn’t thought was really possible unless one was supremely drunk. Even as he does he’s beginning to blink quickly, feeling that familiar burn at the back of his eyes and the rawness creeping up his throat from his stomach. Distantly he hears footsteps behind him.
Of course. The tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy trying to teach the trolls hangs on the opposite wall of where they stand in the left corridor of the seventh floor.
Harry doesn’t seem to notice, only nodding in reply. “Yeah. Dumbledore actually gave it to me for Christmas my first year of Hogwarts.”
He waits and Harry glances over before turning to take a few steps closer to the lake and sinking down to sit closer to the water’s edge. Blaise follows suit and settles beside him a moment later.
“Draco?” Harry looks between him and the quickly retreating others in confusion. “Why aren’t you going with them?”
“He’s been visiting Hagrid.” Harry tells her and Draco shoots him a betrayed look. “Though nobody seems to know why.”
He tries to look unconcerned but thinks it comes out as more of a grimace. Either way he makes it work. “Me? I’m sure you sprinted out of the room.”
She cups her hand and the Ridgeback crawls into it easily, sniffing along her wrist before letting out a happy sound.
Harry Potter comes out to the wizarding world as bisexual the way Harry Potter does everything- with not a thought for the press and in a way that no witch or wizard will miss, including Draco Malfoy.
“No one has to pick sides,” he says firmly. “Come on, you, Harry and Ron have had fights in the past haven’t you? Friends make up. It will be fine.”
Any passing students give the bathroom and the puddle around it a wide berth but Draco ignores them as he opens the door and goes in, feeling Harry follow close behind before he shuts the door for them.
“Even if you hadn’t stayed, I’ve always wanted to spend my last Christmas break at Hogwarts. Now that I’m here it’s so…”
“Just thought I’d see how you were doing after last night.” She turns around to smile at him knowingly and hands over a Hangover Potion. “I heard you might be needing it.”
Draco begins to grind against his hand in earnest and Harry decides he’s brought Draco just far enough before he withdraws his hand.
“I’m dead.” Myrtle says bluntly. “I don’t have to be fair. But you’re alive and you have this chance that two years ago you could have only dreamed of.” She searches his eyes. “Your family is still alive. The right side won. Harry Potter is probably falling head over heels for you. Don’t make excuses to not be happy.”
Draco’s studying in the library when Harry plops down into the seat beside him and makes him jump and let out a curse. Both of them instinctively look over anxiously, worried about Madame Pince appearing to scold them as she likes to do, but a few seconds pass in silence and they relax.
“Hey!” Harry says but both of the Slytherins shoot him identical looks and he decides to give up before he starts. He’s learned to pick his battles and apparently his poor choice in clothing is acknowledged by all of his new friends. “Okay, okay.”
It’s Pansy’s voice and she sounds concerned but he doesn’t even look up. “Shh.” He hisses, eyes quickly scanning the news article.
(Truthfully he knows they do more than talk but he definitely does not need to think about that. Thankfully Hermione has Ginny and the others to share with now, and Ron seems content to keep his updates as simple as possible.)
Ron mutters something under his breath that sounds suspiciously like, "well Dumbledore did," but Harry ignores him.
Harry looks stunned. Blood has drained from his face, leaving it a sickly pale, and realization has replaced the concern he featured before.
“Was he?” Again Narcissa doesn’t say it cruelly, but her honest curiosity is almost worse in a way. “Perhaps he changed in Azkaban then, because the boy at school I remember had more Black in him than he would have likely ever admitted.”
Funny. Draco’s always been desperate for attention like that. Even if it only came from association, he’d always used his connection to Harry (limited though it may have been as just a classmate) to get his time in the limelight.
“I’m an Auror pal. I can talk to you however I want. Now get going unless you want these letters to be held up a day or two.”
Harry has been a lost cause since school but he’s rational enough to not expect loving caresses and gentle handling.
“Hello Hagrid!” Hermione smiles widely. “I’m sorry I didn’t have a chance to visit but I’ll make sure to drop by first thing when we get back.”
Harry glares. “Just because I’m willing to defend you to him doesn’t mean you get to insult him. It works both ways.”
Draco rolls his eyes and glances at the end of the table to see his friends all hissing furiously to one another. He watches them whisper intensely, noticing distantly that McGonagall has stopped talking and the food has appeared.
“I was eleven!” Draco protests. “Besides, after sixth year you can hardly talk. I couldn’t go two steps without you shadowing me.”
Grey eyes shoot up to meet his and he sees Draco put his walls back up. The Slytherin swallows visibly before speaking. “Get dressed, Harry.”
“Okay, I’m sorry.” Potter says, the corners of his mouth still twitching. “I shouldn’t have laughed for so long, you’re right, it wasn’t that funny.”
Hagrid blushes. “Ah, well, no need to go that far. Just doing my part, ya ken. Gotta look out for the animals when I can. They got nobody else, ya see.”
Now Harry rolls his eyes but moves towards him. The mood between them shifts. “Time for you to stop thinking.”
“I can’t keep doing this.” Harry says and the look that crosses the other man’s face breaks his heart. “We’re done, Draco. For good. I’m done. I meant what I said last night, when I asked you to tell me how you felt. I’m not chasing you anymore or hoping that you’ll change your mind. I deserve better than that. And I think you do too.
He thinks Draco must see his hidden smile anyway, because he smiles gently at Harry from where he sits beside him and then they both look away, Harry buttering his toast while Draco takes a bite of green apple.
They both lose it, groaning unashamedly and Draco actually pounds a hand against the wall as Harry’s hips press flush against his arse’s cheeks and he bottoms out.
“Well this is great, isn’t it?” Ron asks after Harry has updated them on what Draco had said. “He loves you, you love him. Everything’s sorted, yeah?”
He turns and makes his way down to the dungeons, ignoring the other Slytherins who are going the same way and shooting him looks. He doesn’t duck away, his shoulders aren’t hunched and he doesn’t avoid eye contact. Instead he feels absurdly happy and walks with his head high and back straight right over to the stairs.
“You have.” Harry assures him. “I just… everyone likes chocolate, don’t they? Figured it was a safe bet.”
“You don’t like this anymore?” Harry asks before licking him again, slightly deeper this time and making Draco mewl.
Draco is still extremely proud of that bit of charmwork. No one had managed to change those badges back, not even the professors who had confiscated them.
Blaise's eyes are shining brightly, excited. "I was scared she was going to say no for a second there," he murmurs. "She was so surprised and then she just started laughing before going and getting the ring she had for me. Practically ruined my trousers waiting on her to come back."
With the son of Lily and James Potter vowing to love and cherish the son of Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy until the end of their days. With Draco Malfoy promising to do the same in front of their friends and family.
“Oh no thank you.” Draco replies, taking a delicate sip of tea. “And I’m just fine. Just a lot of memories coming up today.”
They’re facing a war memorial in the shape of an obelisk. Draco reads the names on it, local names he supposes, and then in the span of a blink it changes to form the shape of three carved figures.
But then Draco realizes as Harry’s expression turns embarrassed that he hasn’t said anything stupid in quite a while and hurries to speak.
Draco swallows. “How do you know? When- if none of you spoke about it, if you tried to hide it away all those years with the Dark Lord, how could you know what he felt?”
Draco watched (watches) Potter, probably closer than anybody else, even the Saviour’s worried friends or Dumbledore. He watched him and vied for his attention and that was why, when Potter said Voldemort was back after the Triwizard Tournament all those years ago, Draco had believed him, would have believed him, even without knowing about it from his father later that night. He knew what Potter looked like when he lied, and Draco had known, with absolute certainty, that he hadn’t been lying then.
“What?” Draco snaps finally. “What’s the problem? We’re only in Eighth Year, why do I need to decide this all now?”
Blaise looks around at their friends before he meets Draco’s eyes calmly. “I’m sorry, is that something we were just never going to talk about?”
He’s happy. Happier than he can remember being before. For once it feels like everything is going right for him.
“Yes of course.” That smile from before is plastered back on her face, only slightly forced. “Is he still resting?”
“Yeah.” Harry shrugs. “It’s small, don’t expect much. Nothing like yours. When you mentioned me coming to the Manor I figured I could just give it to you then, make it closer to Christmas, you know…” He trails off and Draco watches him rub the back of his neck. “Anyway.”
“Well not just you.” Potter says easily, like Draco’s being thick. “Ron, Hermione, some of my other friends. They’ll all be there too. And other students from other Houses. Not just Gryffindors.”
“It’s Halloween, Harry.” Hermione says, smiling fondly. “Of course in the dark. And apparently McGonagall set up some spells on the Third Floor, making it haunted. The ghosts and Peeves are helping her out. So I expect most of the others are all out doing that instead of staying in here. There are some people sleeping of course, mostly younger years who aren’t supposed to be out too late. But McGonagall pushed back curfew because tomorrow’s Saturday.”
It’s impossible to look at Draco and forget everything between them. Years of knowing someone doesn’t just vanish when you don’t see them everyday anymore. Harry looks at Draco and he remembers more than their breakup, he remembers months of friendship, of knowing each other intimately, and the want, the need, that led to them dating in the first place.
“Look, I can figure that out later,” Harry says seeming impatient. Draco just sits there and watches him, mind racing. If he and Ginevra never had sex… he wonders just how far they
“It doesn’t.” Draco interrupts before he knows what he’s doing. “It doesn’t.” He reassures him in a quieter voice. “But I think we might be giving the entire school an aneurysm with the revelation that we’re friends now, so maybe we should just grab some food and take it elsewhere. Feel like a walk?”
"Oh, there's Luna and Neville!" Hermione exclaims as they disembark off the train. Harry’s holding Ginny’s hand as they follow the other couple. "If we hurry we can catch the same carriage as them."
Draco nods when it becomes apparent Blaise is too distracted to do so and Arthur shoots him a small smile. “I have to say I never imagined Ginny would be the next to get married, but hey ho. It seems fitting in a way.”
Instead she’s just decided her pining is worth keeping their friendships the way they are. And while Draco understands, really, he does think things might have been different between them all if she’d only been honest back in Sixth Year.
“Would we have been rival teachers, Heads of Slytherin and Gryffindor?” Draco raises an eyebrow, apparently trying to picture it too. “Or ended up gossiping in the teacher’s tower about all of the hopeless students?”
It seems that’s just the way it is now. Harry always seems to be the one Draco wants support from when he’s upset. Maybe the reason won’t change that, even in their worst moments.
And maybe that’s what this has been about all along, Draco thinks as he allows his eyes to fall closed and grips his mother tightly, clinging to her like they had only allowed once when Voldemort was living with them. Desperate for the support, for the reassurance that neither of them were alone, that they had someone who would protect them. Who would care if things went wrong and one of them made a fatal mistake.
Draco frowned because he had noticed that too. Blaise was known for never really showing interest in anybody, but the way he’d kissed Ginny compared to the way he’d kissed, say, Padma, had been different enough to make Draco stow it away for further reflection later.
“Don’t leave because of us.” Hannah breaks in but Harry waves her off as Parvati gives an unsubtle look to the girl beside her.
“You look nice, by the way.” Millie says to Harry. “If I was attracted to men I’m sure I’d be wanting to jump your bones.”
A blushing McGonagall is something Harry had truly never thought he would see. “I saw her last night.”
Draco blinks and for a few seconds he looks caught as Harry meets his eyes for the first time in almost two years. “
Harry’s heart pounds a bit but he turns the doorknob and takes a few steps in anyway, carefully closing the door behind him.
Something pangs in Harry as he steps away again. He doesn’t want to wait another week to see him again. “Bye Draco.”
They make it to the others and Draco’s chest tightens at seeing them all gathered together, Harry standing in front of the fire and facing them all. He meets Draco’s eyes, not looking nervous at all, only happy, and he feels himself relax.
“She had a picture of Mum and Snape.” Harry’s finger hovers over the picture of the two of them at the train. “How did that happen?”
Draco moves down to peel off Harry’s damp socks, throwing them off the bed after and making the Gryffindor smile. He quickly chucks away his own and then it’s just him in his pajama bottoms and Harry in his boxers as they lay side by side, mouths hungry against one another.
He’s being foolish he knows, and he thinks it again later as they breathe deeply and hold onto one another in the bed, murmuring quiet terms of endearment and whispered secrets for just the two of them. Half of it doesn’t even make sense, just a string of words that are felt more than understood, but neither of them care.
There are no catcalls or wolf whistles now, only a shocked silence. Harry realizes that his lips are moving, moving desperately against Draco’s, and that he is getting hot underneath his robes as his hands move from the floor to Draco’s shoulders. He pulls him closer before opening his mouth a bit and letting Draco’s tongue move now, warm and wet and oh,
Hagrid smiles widely at them. “That’s nice ter see, that is. All of you getting along.” He laughs. “’Specially you two. Never thought I’d see the day.”
“He’s coming.” Theo says knowingly to Pansy before looking at Draco. “You’re coming. Don’t be an idiot.”
He looks so sad that Draco picks his words out carefully. “So you want people to tell you about the mistakes they made?”
Her silence had been loud and when he glanced over she looked more like her usual self. All the worry and pain locked tightly away behind an air of false arrogance. “Look at us being miserable. Anyone who walked in on us would be depressed within seconds.”
Funnily enough somehow Harry hadn’t realized that this game meant he was going to have to watch Draco get kissed and snogged and groped by other people. This fact had completely escaped his attention, and only now that he is about to watch Blaise kiss Draco does Harry realize that is something he definitely does not want to see.
He grabs the blonde’s wrist and pulls him away from the mass of bodies, ignoring everything except the eager steps of Draco behind him and his own pounding heart beat and throbbing cock.
