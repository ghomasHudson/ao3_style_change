Harry must have looked blank, because Malfoy’s mouth tightened in the smallest of smiles. “For tomorrow?”
Potter lifted off for as long as it took him to shove his joggers, underwear and all, down to his ankles, and pulled them free of his ankles and trainers in one go. He then hoisted Draco by the hips and pulled his pyjamas down to his knees, and dropped him back onto the settee, and climbed onto his lap again. “This is going to be fast,” Potter warned, Conjuring a handful of almond oil, and wrapping his palm around both their cocks. Draco hissed with pleasure, and dragged his face back down to his lips, and they moved together, breathing together, hips snapping up in tandem into the tight circle of Potter’s long fingers. Draco couldn’t take his hands from Potter’s face, tracing his jaw, his cheeks, the shell of his ear, trailing his fingers up and down his throat and sinking them again and again into the soft heat of his curls.
“Can’t win them all,” Draco said. He pushed a thick document across the desk. “The good news is, your valiant sacrifice today wasn’t for nothing, and I was able to get the Quodpot contracts sorted on time, as well as complete my evaluation of the proposed updates to the Quidditch League regulations. The bad news is, now you have to go through them as well. My notes are in green.” Potter looked at the regulations forlornly. “Oh, enough with the pathetic face. It’s after five, we can worry about it tomorrow. Besides,” Draco said casually. “I believe there was some discussion about a special reward.”
Draco looked at his aunt guiltily, and then away again before her shrewd eyes picked up anything he didn’t want her to know. “Uncle Harry is the boss in a different area. We’re both Aurors, but I’m in the Potions Division, remember?” Ted just looked at him, unhappily. “Uncle Harry and Uncle Ron will still be there, and all the Weasley’s. Mum will come too, and I’ll get her to wear the scarf, what do you think?”
Potter didn’t say anything in response, but moved behind Draco until his chest was just touching Draco’s back, and brought his arms around to loosely clasp Draco’s wrists. It took everything he had not to shudder. “A little more relaxed — that’s it. Open your stance slightly more. Perfect, Draco.” And this time he couldn’t entirely suppress a shiver. Potter was all but whispering into his ear. “You know, this is a very skimpy vest.”
Draco grinned, a cock-hardening sight on any normal occasion, but especially so on
It was truly surreal, to be standing in his laboratory with this fingers knuckle-deep in a synthetic pussy, gently fucking it, with Draco Malfoy standing close beside him making small sounds of encouragement. The lube slurped obscenely, loud in the quiet of the lab. Malfoy picked up the King Dong, and coated his hand in lube before he began to palm it in quick, efficient strokes. Harry hardly knew where to look; he could almost
Oh, marvellous. “Then I have no idea why you’d think anything was salvageable.”
“So what does that leave us? Mischief? Psychopathy? Someone wanting to do a major crime, something with Gringotts?”
He knew his face was getting red. “You’re not going to believe it. And if you believe it, I’m not sure you’re going to like it.”
He nodded. “M’fine. The tenderness is nearly all gone, and I had a potion for my head. Still definitely experiencing the truth compulsion though. I never would have told you all that without a year of therapy and most of a bottle of vodka in me.”
“Rubbish,” Draco lied. “You’re paranoid.” Potter’s fingers were so hard on his hips, he was going to leave marks. Draco’s cock was thick in his jeans. “I just changed rotation. Not everything is about you.”
“Penet-” Harry closed his eyes and tried not to blush any further. He could see the Latin root to the name, but Malfoy was clearly going for maximum titillation. “What does it do, exactly?”
“Neville told me you’re traditional. I want to know what that means.”
“I do trust you, completely.” He put his chin on Draco’s shoulder, going up onto the balls of his feet to reach. “I’ve been listening to what you’ve said these last two days. I know when I get like this it can make you feel like I don’t. I do, though.”
“Granger,” Draco said dismissively. “Harry, listen. I love you, alright? All of you, from the brilliant to the incredibly stupid. All your trauma, all your resilience, every messy, wonderful bit of you. I want to marry you. Even a bag of hair and scabs wouldn’t stop me.” He cupped Harry’s face in both hands. “But if I don’t get my engagement party, I will murder you with my own two hands, are we clear?”
Draco was already at the door. “Yes.”
That left...what? Perhaps Potter was just a little drunk and flirty. That was certainly plausible, as Potter had been making impressive progress through the open bar.
“Auror Malfoy.”
“Nevermind that, why do
Dick. “So you do work for the Ministry.”
“I’m having a breakdown, and I need a phone as soon as, because I need to get some information from Longbottom about photos of me he sent to Potter.”
"I mean queer as in soft in the head, not queer as in…you know, the other kind. Seven days of your huffing and puffing will give a person the idea you don't
Fuck, that wasn't what he meant at all.
"It's quiet," Draco observed. Potter nodded.
“Have you ever finished a full cup of tea in your life?”
Draco swallowed, and made a decision. He was going to have to make up with Potter, for Ted’s sake. Obviously, they were never going to sleep together again, not after all that had happened to date, but they couldn’t fight anymore, either. He’d told Granger he would be there for Teddy, and he meant that, and being there for his cousin meant being on good terms with his godfather. There was too much at stake to fuck up just because of some hurt feelings on his part. The child had suffered more than his share, and Draco’s mother and aunt had put a lot of work into repairing more than twenty years of estrangement. He wouldn’t be the undoing of all of that. He said he was trying to make better choices, and be a better man, and this was one of those times.
“I’m in love with you,” Harry gasped it into Draco’s mouth. Somehow he’d got his fingers in Draco’s hair. Somehow he’d got his glasses off.
“I’m meant to be on leave,” Draco said, already knowing all the fight had gone out of him. Weak as piss. “Right now, the itinerary should have me in the middle of a very long bath.”
“Next week?” Harry said distractedly. Oh. Next week. “Just the normal, I suppose. Handy that my birthday’s on a Friday this year. Can get pissed, and not have to front work with a hangover. I guess I’ll send out a couple of owls, and get the gang around mine for a few ciders.”
“Sadly, this is true.”
I don’t want to talk about or to Potter if I can reasonably help it. Did he do something? No. He did nothing, absolutely nothing, and that’s basically the issue. If his ego’s bruised from his first taste of rejection, then I guess he’ll just have to suck it up. It wasn’t meant to last, anyway.” He stared angrily across the stands at the top of Potter’s head. “So now it’s done, and we’ll both make nice at work and in front of Teddy, and he can move on to his perfect match. That enough for you, Rita?”
“Thank goodness you’re here to clarify that, Potter. If you would, perhaps you can also explain to me just what I’m supposed to do on my unexpected day off?”
Harry shoved his hand in his hair, forgetting for a moment that he was holding his quill and spent the next several seconds untangling it from the knotty mess of his fringe. He cleared his throat. He suspected he had ink on his forehead, now. “Yeah, um. Nev said it’s in good shape, and if you work on it in the greenhouse over the next six months or so, it should be big enough to divide the bulbs, so you can try getting it to take in the Manor woods.”
“This is forking insane.” Harry picked up a polished walnut case and flicked the latch with his thumb. “What are these ones?”
In hindsight, Harry wished he’d been more careful with his phrasing. He didn’t have any proof, but sometimes it seemed that all you needed to do to manifest a thing, was to name it, and the bad choices started as soon as the second round had reached the table.
“I don’t know why you’ve suddenly decided to wind him up,” Weasley said with amusement, hefting his copy of the report as the rest of the team filed out. “But you should know he’s swiftly reaching the point where he’s going to really blow his stack.”
Ron frowned at them. “You’re not going to be humping each other all over the flat, are you? That’s not good housemate etiquette.”
“Can’t, it’s mine. Minerva can get nicked.”
When Draco had eventually accepted they were serious - a good six months in, he was so
. Every morning was a reminder that they were separated. Every dutiful mouthful of slop he spooned up from his tin plate an empty parody of their morning ritual together. No matter what happened during the rest of the day, the hours they would be apart while Harry was at work and Draco was holed up in his study-cum-office investing here, and vice-presidenting there, the inevitable squabbles over what to watch on telly or who forgot the dry cleaning, breakfast was their time together. Breakfast was sacred.
“Oh.” Realisation and a fresh blush bloomed on Potter’s face. “It’s called the wallpaper. You choose a picture to stick there so you always see it.”
Draco twisted both halves of the orange cream until it came apart, and dipped the side without the buttercream into his tea. “What makes you say that?”
“Don’t bother going there Potter, not until we’ve checked. The Cum Den is revolting, it’s a real- Lester! How are you, old man? Oh, well enough, you know how it is. Look I wouldn’t bother you, but I’ve just had a customer drop in trying to return a Sensual Lover dildo, and I didn’t sell one so I thought maybe it might have been one of yours? Yeah, I have the serial number actually, would you mind?”
,” Draco couldn’t finish. Panic was a tight band around his chest, squeezing harder by the moment, crawling up this throat like a burning hand. He put the phone down on the coffee table, too hard. He wanted a sip of water, but his hands were shaking too much.
Draco heaved what felt like his millionth sigh, and hopped off the stool. “You might as well come and look at it. I could do with a second opinion anyway.”
The blinding rage was back again.
. Draco pushed open the kitchen door and slid inside, stupidly close to the wall as if he could somehow hide himself in the pale, shabby wallpaper.
“He was bringing me several Muggle dildos.”
“That looks pretty sore. Do you need a hand with a Healing charm?”
“The dragonhide boots from Sirius.”
.” Draco could only stare at Potter. Speaking was out of the question; firstly, what would he say, and secondly, he was fairly certain his blush was nearing combustible proportions, and it was very important to concentrate on
“That’s right,” Potter appeared beside them. “Fifth year. Draco made up a song about it, didn’t you, Draco?” Potter raised an eyebrow at him. “Give us a few lines, won’t you?”
“Ron, you might want to turn around for a minute.”
“I will, I will,” Potter soothed, moving one hand to his own cock, dragging it up and down Draco’s crevice. “But I like to hear you beg for it first.”
“Stop pretending we’re not friends, Malfoy. You’re such a git.”
“I’m sure it’ll be there mate. Just call them later.”
and Harry found it a little bit offensive that they thought he couldn’t tell the difference after all these years.
come in handy. I’ve never told you Malfoy, but I have a hidden talent. I can guilt people into donating money to charities. It’s kind of amazing, actually.”
“There’s an obvious way around that, isn’t there?” Ron pointed the tongs at Harry. “Just order the artificial arsehole.”
“We all made mistakes, mate. I only went and left you two in the forest, didn't I, and you forgave me.”
Malfoy’s words echoed in his head. Malfoy was sexy. Malfoy was basically sex personified. And Malfoy had awoken something in Harry, the moment he’d encountered him at the shop in Knockturn.
“Harry, if you’re not seeing anyone there’s a certain massage therapist working for a certain Quidditch team which shall for the time being remain nameless, who has dropped a number of not so subtle hints that he is single and interested. I could set you up, just say the word.”
Ginny seems terribly pleased about something. “I was just going to get myself a little something sweet, as it happens, so you can have my seat, Malfoy.” She stands, and takes Harry’s face in her hands. For an alarming minute, Harry thinks she’s actually going to kiss him, and then she does, planting a peck on top of his head. “Be good, Harrybob Potterpants.”
“What am I smelling, Harry?”
“That means their rooms will be on the third, with Granger and Ron. The kids can bunk in with Teddy, I assumed, but Ron will have front row seats to Merlin knows what between his sister and Pans.”
“Draco, I didn’t know,” Potter said again. Draco raised his eyebrows.
Harry closed his eyes and visualised his spell analysis report, which in his mind’s eye was obscured by layer upon layer of translucent, aggressively wobbling dongs. He took a deep breath through his nose, inhaling the comforting scent of the tea, now balanced atop a stack of reference texts beside the divan; he tasted the chocolate from the biscuits on his tongue; slowly, firmly, he blew out his breath and imagined himself holding a broom, which he used to sweep away the piles and piles of cocks, until he could see the report clearly once again.
“Imagine how good it’ll feel in your mouth,” Malfoy said on a hitched breath, and rolled over and pushed his way between Harry’s thighs.
They decided on only a smallish number of balloons, because Harry admitted that balloons and birthdays were basically inseparable in his mind, but the fairy lights were so wonderful that he didn’t want too many, as they might get in the way. Malfoy Conjured them in a riot of colours, and sent them floating up to the plaster medallions with long, silver ribbons, to bob around beside the little gold dots of light.
“What did it feel like?” Teddy’s hair was electric blue and pulsing along with the waves in the video.
Harry blinked, surprised. “I am?”
Draco turned his head just enough to look over his shoulder, and winced when his whole left side cramped in objection. “How’s Ron?”
“I’m sorry,” Draco burst out, rubbing his hands over his eyes. “I don’t know how to do this, alright? I’ve never had to do this before. Never wanted to.”
Draco’s head was starting to hurt. “Do you need a dictionary? Because I’m sure there are other people who could help you with that. Like a librarian.”
He shouldn’t be awake. It wasn’t part of the itinerary. At 7.45am today he was scheduled to be asleep, and to remain so for several hours yet, sleeping off a champagne hangover from last night at Pansy’s (tick), before a light breakfast (fruit, a pastry, and a latte, ready and under stasis in his kitchen), a soak (no longer than ninety minutes in duration, coconut oil, organic goat milk, and a sprinkling of rose petals), and an international Portkey (precisely 2pm) to a Greek resort where he would linger, marinating in coconut-scented suntan oil, for two glorious weeks.
Malfoy remained stiff-backed and stubborn for long, silent minutes. Harry waited.
Malfoy had received…
“Give me a kiss, sweetheart.” Harry nuzzled into Draco’s neck and tried to keep stirring without knocking the pan off the stove. “You’ve never told me that before.” Draco didn’t reply, but turned his face and allowed himself to be kissed as thoroughly as one could be when one’s fiance was still cooking one’s favourite risotto. “Do you want to know when I knew?”
Harry let himself be led back into his office, Malfoy guiding him with a warm, sure hand on the small of his back, and he sat down on his creaky divan without saying his usual prayer to ward off it’s imminent collapse.
A small bell jingled above the door on the way in. Harry was struck immediately by how...well, how little it looked like he expected a sex shop would. It was bright, for a start, a very clean, sterile white sort of lighting, and there was some kind of nondescript music piping softly through the place, the kind you might expect to hear in a suburban Tesco. Actually, the whole effect was very much like a supermarket; a faint scent of bleach, bright white tiled floors and walls, and neat aisles filled with all manner of toys.
His fingers slid through the soap at his neck, and thoughts of Malfoy drifted slowly forward. Malfoy’s lips on Harry’s throat, his thumbs stroking gently against Harry’s hip bones. He was hard again, and sensible enough not to bother resisting the blossoming fantasy of Malfoy pressed up behind him, mouthing at his neck and nipping his earlobe with sharp little bites.
“Potter, what are your plans next week?”
“You’re in a panic spiral,” Draco told him. “Take five deep breaths.” Harry did as he was told. “Good. Now, don’t think, just tell me what’s worrying you about this.”
“So. Can I ask you something, Malfoy?”
“So something did happen.”
So Potter had been telling his friends about it. Maybe about them. Draco’s stomach ached. Granger obviously knew, but she was frighteningly perceptive, so that wasn’t necessarily an indicator that she’d officially been
Malfoy had shed his Auror robes back at the office, and had rolled up the cuffs of his shirt, which was white, and had lots of fussy little holes in it. Malfoy had laughed, when Harry had mentioned it earlier, and told him it was something called
“Look, I know you guys have some kind of tangled history, that I honestly couldn't be more interested in, because it sounds
His smile was sharp and unfriendly. “Firecrotch.”
“Yep.” Weasley leaned back on his chair, and swore quietly as his back cracked and popped for his effort. “The side that I heard goes, Harry admitted he has feelings for you, then you nearly keeled over about it, and then he left the room for a minute and somehow you found a picture of yourself on his phone.” Ron quirked his lips. “I mean, even I thought that would be a weird thing to see, and I live with a woman who will illegally place surveillance charms on friends and family on a semi-regular basis without a shred of guilt.”
“Happy birthday, Potter. May I come in?”
“Good one, mate,” Ron said supportively. “Anyone we know?”
“Go home, you both look exhausted. Thank you for coming, boys. You did a wonderful job of distracting him.”
“ENOUGH! I don’t have time for this crap from either of you! We’re about forty minutes from being buried to our necks in pigeon shit, WizPost is non functional, there aren’t enough elves or other birds for hire no matter how much money we throw at the problem, and we’re on the cusp of a full blown crisis if Mungo’s can’t receive or send potions orders, not to mention the Wizengamot. I’ve got every Auror on duty to keep the peace, right down to the first year trainees. I need my best men on
He tried to focus on his breathing, which was shallow again, and his pulse was rapid in his throat. He looked at his eyes, heavy lidded and dark green with arousal, and he laughed, a low, hoarse sound that he hadn't heard himself make in a long time. Impossible that he could still be this turned on, but he was; thirty-two and behaving like he was a teen again. “You can’t spend all day bringing yourself off,” he told his reflection, sternly. But that’s exactly what Malfoy had suggested he should do, wasn't it.
Harry snorted. “No! Like - like I can imagine how they’d feel... wrapped around my neck when I…”
The lift juddered as it rose. “The Owl Keepers should be quick. I’d say we’ll be done by the time the Ward Room permits are ready. How long do you think you’ll need in there?”
It was 11.58pm, and he lay in bed, staring at the shadows, thinking about Malfoy, and waiting for his new year to begin.
Draco smiled thinly. “Yes. Just like Uncle Harry, except he was a Seeker, and you’re a Keeper.”
Shacklebolt entered the office with what seemed like a single stride, and leaned both hands on Harry’s desk. Harry resisted the urge to lean backward with some difficulty. “Do you have any idea how many times the Chief Warlock has personally visited my office to bother me about this case, Potter?” Harry opened his mouth, but Shacklebolt did not wait for his answer. “The answer is ‘too many’, Potter. I had thought I had impressed upon our Head Auror the urgency with which I would prefer this case to be investigated, and he had assured me that he had communicated this to you. Perhaps I was not sufficiently clear.” Harry swallowed, and Shacklebolt loomed over him. “Sort it out. Reassign whatever you have to, and take care of this personally, and immediately.”
like, such as having engagement parties. He sometimes wondered whether it was genetic, perhaps a Potter thing, that he’d inherited from his Dad. He could imagine his Dad being useless at this sort of thing, and his Mum probably the one who kept them all on track. It would have been nice to know for sure, but there was nobody left to ask, aside from Petunia, and there was no chance he’d be reaching out to
Harry forked an obnoxiously large clump of salad and chips into his mouth with a smug expression.
“I told you he was pissed off.” Harry took a sip of tea. “You better watch yourself, mate.”
“Office politics,” Potter sighed, rubbing his neck. Draco nodded.
“What for,” Draco said stupidly, and Potter smiled down at him.
“Vote!”
“Where - who?”
“The person who last took a shit goes next,” Harry said. “And before you ask, no, it’s not honesty based - there’s a spell.”
“Oh my
the Chief Warlock’s cocks were of the lifelike style, and the King Dong barely looks like a cock at all.” He tapped the list and a large, full colour image of a purple, translucent dick expanded on the page. Harry cleared his throat and nodded in agreement. The image of the Sensual Lover dildo was a precise match for the shrub full of dicks in Harry’s lab. “Well, it wasn’t me who sold your dildo, but I can put in a discreet call to the others if you like – who else is on your list of stockists?”
Malfoy squeezed him, gently. “So what I’m hearing is, casual sex is not for you. You want to be intimate with someone who knows you.”
She smiled and murmured her thanks, and they were alone again. The piano was soft, and rubbish. Draco hated everything about this fucking place. There was absolutely no chance of running into Potter here. “Yes, I heard you’ve changed your rotation. And your workout. You’re not even doing your usual run, is that right?” She took a slow sip. “Not even coming to Junior Quidditch tournaments for the sake of young men who look up to you.”
“Can’t say.”
“Doesn’t she always.”
“Good boy,” Draco said against his lips, and he bit down gently on Harry’s mouth. “Now. Let’s get you out of these pyjamas.”
“Thanks,” Ron grinned. “And you have a gift for acting like a fucking helmet.” He put his elbows on the table, and leaned forward. “Now, stop changing the pissing subject, and get back on what you’re going to do about the fact that you like him, and he likes you, and you both want to go out with each other?”
“Give me a proper kiss, you fool.”
“If you could try and smooth things over with the Ambassador?” Potter nodded. Two of the burlier waiters were hauling Scrivener out of the tank by the underarms. He was getting shouty.
"No, I was just distracted and forgot it. No no, don't trouble yourself, I'll get it - accio milk!"
“It’s what Teddy thinks,” she said. Her voice was neutral. “It’s what he told Harry. He actually got Andromeda to phone Harry so he could see if Harry could get you out of work that weekend. Harry’s furious, by the way. I’ve never seen him like this.”
There must be twenty items in the box, now sorted neatly across his duvet by category and size, at least where Harry could figure out what they were actually for. Far too many to use on himself in one afternoon, especially after indulging himself so thoroughly much earlier in the morning. Some Harry discounted immediately. Too much, too soon. He would definitely need to work his way up to some of them, and he only had so many hours left of his Sunday as it was. The largest dildos and plugs went right back in the box, along with a life-size rubber hand and forearm - for fisting - fuck no, too much. What was Malfoy thinking! Jesus.
Devlin held the phial up to the light and watched the substance move thickly within. “It’s still warm.” He closed his fingers around the glass and nodded. “Right away, Mr Potter. Are the others...?”
He gave Harry another look, another smile, and withdrew a business card from his trousers. “If you decide you’re ready for more than a look,” Orange Singlet Paul pushed the card into the front pocket of Harry’s jeans, and leaned in close again. “Give me a call.” He grinned cheekily and gave Harry a brief peck on the cheek. “It was a pleasure to meet you, Harry Gorgeous.”
Including by Draco Malfoy, at Hogwarts School, Scotland.
Draco turned around from his task at the kitchen counter. His
“Thanks,” Draco said, glum. “I think I might just go home.”
“So, he didn’t tell you about the photo?”
Hannah, Hannah from Sports.”
Peering into his cup, Harry stared for a long moment at his reflection in the dark brown tea. “Hermione thinks - that I’m hiding behind my job so I don’t have to deal with stuff. Life stuff. Relationships.” Merlin’s arse, it felt weird to say that aloud, weird enough that he was saying it to Malfoy, a man he’d barely spoken to for a decade - but it also felt a bit like relief. “And this case, well, it leads to a lot of banter about sex, doesn't it? And once that sort of chat is going on, then it’s never too long before I start getting harassed about my love life, and how unhealthy my coping mechanisms are.” Harry sighed again, and it felt like it was coming from the pit of his stomach.
“You’d never, you like me too much.”
Draco’s task for Friday, therefore, was to prepare an exhaustive report on the event including recommendations for safety improvements at future fundraisers, confirm the final tally of donations, and revise the Summer Swim program budget in order to present it all to Scrivener on Monday while still leaving enough time to be chastised again for as long as Scrivener felt like it. Draco sighed, and the sound echoed through the corridor, along with the clip of his heels on the hard floor. He really did wonder, sometimes, what he was doing in this department, working for such an extraordinarily incompetent fuckwit after so many years. He’d had offers. He could have had a nice little career in the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Nobody had a problem with hard ‘k’ sounds there, to the best of his knowledge.
, on Saturdays - so many little routines Draco had become accustomed to, took comfort in. Draco remembered the first time he'd worked out how to read the television guide, and had seen the name there and remembered Pansy, and hurt. He must have whispered the name, because Potter took the paper from his hands, and asked in a low voice whether Draco would like to watch it. It wasn't what he'd expected - he wasn't sure
"Sounds perfect, love. Just perfect."
The sleeve felt...fine. It was snug, and while it didn’t quite feel like someone else was touching him, the grooves inside were a nice change from the familiar notches of his own hands. It was good. Fine. Harry had sort of expected more from his very first sex toy (unless you counted the harness Ginny used to peg him with, which, he probably should). It felt nice. Very nice. Nice enough.
“I love you,” Harry said, casting Lumos as powerfully as he could in the dim eaves of the house. “Just try to remember that, alright?”
"I'm sorry," he choked, his throat still bone dry, and trapping the words half-spoken, "I didn't mean-"
“Legs,” Harry said, his eyes getting caught on Malfoy’s pale thighs. “What?”
Draco stared at him. Obviously, Weasley was referring to Potter, and yes, perhaps Draco had been staring at him a bit while thinking about his ruined holiday, but that was purely an accident.
ed the owls.”
“Yep,” Harry adjusted his squat, his legs starting to cramp. “My dad’s too. And he was my godfather, like I’m yours.”
“Yep,” Potter gestured for Draco to alight the lift first. “If we’re lucky, that wind will be something, and if not, we can rule that out and look through the rest after.”
Hand delivered, then. Harry nodded, realised that was daft as Malfoy couldn’t bloody well
, and
“God, Harry,” Draco clutched at his waist hard enough to leave marks. “Get your fucking trousers off.”
Ted shook his blue hair and shrugged. “I don’t even know what vulgar
“What’s the use of being married to the Chief Warlock if you’re not willing to abuse the privilege from time to time?” Draco smirked. “So,
Malfoy set down his tea, and counted off on his fingers. “You’re not a virgin, nor have you taken religious orders. But you’re also seemingly celibate, and you clearly found our business in the lab completely overwhelming. By your own description, you do absolutely nothing but work, visit your childhood friends, and wash your knickers. Now, as much as fifteen year old me would have found this wildly entertaining, I’m not him anymore, and you have a garden full of cocks you need to sort out. So why don’t you come out with me on Saturday night, have a bit of a drink and a dance, see if someone might snog you, and break the ice a little?”
, if you’re not careful.”
“Don’t call her Jesus, Malfoy, she’ll only get a big head.” Ron squeezed past Draco to get to a seat on the other side of his sister. “The way she’s going, the Harpies will have to bench her, ‘cos she won’t be able to keep her broom in the air.” He looked at Draco, and then his sister, and shoved his hand into the box of Pepper Imps. “You know, because of the weight of her giant head.”
He still felt pretty seedy, though his body didn’t ache the same way it had, which was a relief. He’d been absolutely battered like a cod by that hex, or perhaps it’d been several hexes, he couldn't rightly remember. There was Pepper-Up under the sink, and he gulped down as much as he could stand, and then his stomach growled so loudly that he decided the next order of business needed to be food.
“Leave me alone so I can finish this paperwork. I want to get home as soon as. I have a holiday to re-start tomorrow.”
, and butter sauce.”
“Authorised personnel only in the Hub, Potter. I’ll get someone to escort you out. Golsby!”
“If you’d just talk to Malfoy, you might not be such a sad boy.” Ginny lifted her shoulders. “I’m just saying.”
On Sunday, Harry made a pasta salad, and brought it around to Ron and Hermione’s for dinner.
“I promised Lawlor we would address the cake issue, and I let Mona Cordwell down gently about the allocation of Department of Magical Law Enforcement resources to missing stationery. She took it well.” Potter reached for another biscuit, and drained his tea. “I didn’t know what to say to Parker, other than to apologise and promise to note it down so he wouldn’t have to move desks again. Wedderburn is now in possession of a concealment spell that he’s quite pleased with, which should take care of the soy milk issue. And Gardner…” Potter winced apologetically. “Well, I might have lost my patience with him a bit.”
. His legs were wrapped high around Harry’s waist, heels pressed into the divots at the base of Harry’s spine. Harry fucked him, it was always fucking because it was always so raw, melting hot, brain-cell destroying pleasure, but it was love, too, in every thrust and stroke, drop of sweat, soft curse, hard bite. Draco had asked him the other morning, why it was never enough, and Harry hoped it would always be like this, simple, desperate need for each other, satisfaction, then the slow build of want all over again. Draco had his hand on his cock, jerking himself with his strong, graceful fingers. Harrys hands were underneath him, splayed across the small of his back, and the top of his spine, holding him to his chest as if perhaps this time they might actually merge into one.
it’s more than that,” Harry said defensively. “I know that. It’s just really hard for me to let go of things, especially things people have given me. Apparently growing up in a cupboard with nothing for the first third of your life can have psychological consequences.”
“I pity the life you’ve led, Longbottom, if you’ve not had a reason to say ‘penis’ before breakfast.”
Harry sighed loudly and swore for several minutes without pause, and stuffed his wand into his pocket with nearly enough force to tear a hole in his robes.
Weasley clapped a warm hand on Draco’s shoulder. “I know you’ll make me pay for this for — well, the rest of my life, but thank you again Malfoy. I’ve already had HR re-credit your leave balance, and you’re on paid exemption for the next fortnight.”
“Darling,” Draco said calmly, which was a sure sign that he was probably about to explode. “What exactly the fuck am I looking at, here?”
Harry kissed around Draco’s thighs, and cock, and moved up to lay beside him, his middle finger still petting Draco gently between the curve of his arse, his balls warm against Harry’s palm. Draco’s mouth was soft, but greedy, hot and wet, and they kissed slowly, slowly, and Harry rubbed Draco just as slowly, in no hurry.
It was, of course, a perfectly practical solution, which did not resolve the real problem which was that Harry had absolutely no desire to be of service to Balter Throttlebottom in any capacity. Throttlebottom was a bully and a bigot, despite what his Order of Merlin might suggest, and Harry had butted heads with him repeatedly over the years in his capacity as Auror. He was particularly enthusiastic about imposing unduly heavy sentences for minor offences, when those offences had been committed by defendants from certain ‘undesirable’ backgrounds. No, it would be infinitely more satisfying to leave his harvest of dicks just where it was, in full view of all Throttlebottom’s friends and neighbours and the world at large.
"Mmpfh…I know…but I missed you…wanked a lot…"
Harry leaned his forehead to Draco’s. “Yes, sweetheart.”
There was a hamper full of tshirts with their tags on them. None of them fit, but Harry had never taken them back. There were several rice cookers, brand new in box, because he kept forgetting he’d already bought one that he never used anyway, and a tower of CDs and DVDs still with the plastic on. There was a machine to grind your own mince meat, and another one to fry your own doughnuts, and another to make ice cream. A bucket hat with an owl on the front. There was a lot of Tupperware -
She squinted at her cards. “What was the last bid?”
Malfoy wore a fitted black shirt, something that looked both soft and crisp at once, and which was rolled up at the sleeves to the elbow and unbuttoned to somewhere down the middle of his chest. Over the top was a grey waistcoat which just skimmed his hips, the first two buttons also unfastened. There was a heavy silver-coloured watch at one wrist which looked expensive. His trousers were also grey and slim cut, tight around the thigh where Malfoy’s foot was resting against a narrow ledge of brick in the wall behind him. Even his boots looked incredible, butterscotch-coloured and satin polished.
“Hi,” Harry said, breathlessly, as Malfoy stepped out gracefully and with hardly a spot of ash on him.
“It’s your choice,” Hermione said again firmly, and Harry loved her, very much. “Daft, but entirely yours. You tell me if you need anything, if I can do anything.”
Agatha sighed, and held out the parchment pointedly. “He’s literally specified. ‘Deputy Head Potter, Field Division, requests Senior Officer Malfoy personally undertake analysis of the runespoor poisons case and provide a report at his earliest convenience.’ He’s actually underlined your name, twice.”
That wasn’t why he couldn’t sleep, although the sugar alone made him feel like he was buzzing slightly, and he was definitely feeling quite squiffy. And knowing Draco was in the house definitely didn’t help. There was something about knowing he was here, laying down in bed, even if it wasn’t Harry’s bed. He’d taken off his clothes at some point, Harry assumed, and that made him feel extra wobbly when he thought about it. Harry didn’t know, and would never ask, what Draco wore to bed. Had he been nude at any point under Harry’s roof, tonight? Probably had, since Harry’d given him towels, and showed him where the bathroom was. Draco had been nude in his house. Draco had definitely touched his naked cock, in some shape or form, in Harry’s house.
Harry frowned at the glass. “Right-o. Well, what have you got to say about my hair, then? Terrible, litter of badgers nesting in it, looks like I was dragged through a bush backwards?” He pulled open the drawer under the sink, and grabbed the jar of Sleekeazy’s Hair Cement with great resentment. He’d never quite got the hang of using it - Hermione had managed to wrestle his hair into a reasonably respectable configuration once or twice in the past, but Harry hadn't had the same success. It had always turned out like a bit of a thick, black, hairy helmet.
“I’ll just…” Draco gestured to the compactus behind him, but stood still looking slightly stupidly at Potter instead of going to get the files he’d requested.
“I can appreciate that things may change between consenting adults. Maybe Harry’s not a good shag, maybe you’re just sick of him. There’s lots to be annoyed by, with our Harry. But don’t fuck Teddy over, Draco.”
“I’ll get us a drink,” he said tightly, letting go of Draco’s arm.
“I suppose you know why I’m here.”
He looked confused. “What’s come?”
Harry felt the blush from head to toe. “Oh, I don’t know, I mean. Yes, I’m Harry, but I don't know that I’m Draco’s-”
Malfoy drops the spoon and it ricochets off the high chair tray and onto the tiles, where the lump of pumpkin splats. “Shit!”
It had been a month, now. Every morning, Draco woke at seven, and lay in bed, or sometimes sat in the bath, for another hour, thinking. At just on eight, he would hear Potter rising, and at half eight he would venture out of his own room and head to the kitchen. Potter would have a pot of tea ready, and porridge on the stove, and would probably be wearing his scruffy robe with bare feet. Draco always wore his slippers. The floors were cold, and there was something strangely intimate about seeing another persons' naked foot. As a consequence, he found himself looking at Potter's rather too often.
“Oh,” Draco panted and wiped his face with the hem of his tshirt to buy himself some time, and Potter's eyes had been hot and lingering on the briefly bared skin of his belly. “Training for a half marathon.”
Draco sat on the sofa as calmly as he could manage. “Six hours, give or take.”
“Harry.” Malfoy had both elbows on the bar and one foot cocked on the polished rail near the floor. Naturally, his trousers were pulling tight across his backside again. Malfoy was smiling his liquid smile. “Harry and I are old school friends. We haven’t seen each other in a very long time, and I thought I’d take him out for a bit of fun.”
Draco
He lay with his face pressed to Draco’s throat, as his heartbeat hammered and gradually slowed. Draco’s hands rested tiredly on his flanks, one hand sticky, and their bellies wet with sweat and come. “If you keep fucking me like that, I’m going to get the idea that you like me, Malfoy.”
The tables were cold glass, the floor polished concrete, and the lighting was a frosty blue-white.  In these surrounds, Draco looked like he’d just Apparated in from one of the Nine Worlds of Norse mythology, hopefully one of the ones where he could have a cool gimmick like a hammer or something, but probably one of the ones where he was an evil blue demon, knowing his luck.
Draco sighed, and pinched the bridge of his nose. “I want to see everyone in Meeting Room 4 immediately. You too, Pinhead,” Draco pointed a finger at Potter, who was already wandering off in the opposite direction. “You’re part of this department. If we’re doomed, you’re doomed.” Potter grinned, and what would ordinarily have been a charming, toothy white smile was instead distinctly pumpkin-coloured.
you sometimes.”
Longbottom had his phone out, trying to film the waves, Draco presumed. He waded back through the shallow water toward him and their gear, blue sparks racing out where he kicked past the waves. His jeans were plastered to him, nearly dragging right off his hips, and his nipples felt like they could cut glass. His hair was a salty tangle, and he tried to push it back from his face, still worrying at the tender bit of his lip with his teeth.
Potter's chair scraped back, and he was suddenly right
Draco chewed his lip briefly. Potter’s eyes were dark, and watched him. “I suppose it was an invitation.”
He didn’t really have an end to that sentence, but it didn’t matter anyway, as Potter had pressed him hard against the office door and seemed to be attempting to kiss the words right out of his mouth, and Draco felt the smile still persisting, and he wondered whether there would be any Thai food or cricket for either of them tonight.
“What’s the problem, Malfoy? I fancy you, you fancy me, we’re consenting adults...”
There was an audible hum in Draco’s office, caused chiefly by the swarm of memos circling the air space above Draco’s desk like a flock of noisy birds. He almost didn’t notice it anymore, thanks in part to the Shield charm which had become a necessity to prevent each anxious missive from swooping down and pecking Draco’s head. He was absolutely swamped with work; for every memo he plucked from the fleet above, it seemed another three would arrive.
how long it’d been since Harry last pulled, if there was some kind of tell he wasn’t aware of. “Since you quit the Auror’s,” Malfoy continued after a moment, raising an eyebrow questioningly. “So it’s not like you’re saving the world all the time anymore. Definitely saving a few arses and noses from biting objects, but that’s hardly warrior stuff, is it?”
“What are you doing here getting spangled all by yourself on a Saturday night, Malfoy?”
. “It was just before we started Auror training. I was at the Weasley’s and the owls delivered both our uniforms, for Ron and me. Everyone wanted to see us try them on, so I went up to Ginny’s room, and she came in with me, and I had the parcel open.” He swallowed hard. Malfoy was teasing his neck now, the gentlest brush of his lips along the tendons on Harry’s throat. “She was watching me as I started to get undressed. Her eyes - she looked like she wanted to eat me alive.”
“He’s a fireman?”
Half-nine in the Department of Magical Games and Sport had never been so quiet. Draco had agonised over the decision to hold the gala on a Thursday night, but in the end the unusually heavy schedule of fundraisers, festivals and balls that month made the decision for him. As a result, Draco had given the department staff the following day off – there was a high probability of absenteeism due to hangovers anyway, and anyone who did show up would probably have wasted most of the day with gala-related gossip. At least this way, he could score a few points with his people, and minimise discussion of any impromptu swimming by senior staff, and certainly no scuttlebutt about any other department managers who may or may not have been almost holding hands. Plus, Scrivener was almost guaranteed to call in sick anyway, so there was really no reason for anybody to make an appearance on Friday.
Draco was up to his neck in hot water, heavy with coconut oil and organic goat milk, and a liberal sprinkle of dusky rose petals, when Bog appeared in the steam of his bathroom.
Draco cut a piece of lamb and chewed it. Potter watched him, and looked as if he wanted to say something else, but didn't know how.
“Mmmhmm.”
Weasley snorted softly. “Right. So, Nev said something at the pub the other night about birthday drinks. Do you think you’ll come?”
“He’s alright, Harry,” Malfoy said, his voice calm and reassuring. He grabbed a handful of powder, and opened the Floo to St Mungo’s. Not completely alright, then. Fuck, Ted. “He’s alright,” Malfoy said again, and wrapped his long, warm fingers around Harry’s wrist, squeezing. “Come on, I’ve got you.”
“I barely saw him, for like five seconds the year before we -” Draco coughed. “I can’t remember. But fine, we can get rid of those. Absolutely no sentimental value there. I can hardly remember him actually. What’s his name again?” Harry backed Draco against the gilded chair. “Stop that. Harry no, it's dusty. Mmmph. What did I tell you, we can’t shag every time we have a disagreement!”
Harry tilted his hips, fucking sharply in, and Draco made a noise of pure, sticky pleasure. “I’m willing to test that theory.”
“Like what?”
“Hands off, that one’s an heirloom. And yes, God exists in the wizarding world too, Potter. Do you think we were just celebrating Easter and Christmas at school with no idea who Jesus was?”
Harry stared at the toy. Where to start?
“You going to eat that?” Freckled fingers reached for the toast, and Harry cast a mild Stinging jinx under his breath without reaching for his wand, or indeed looking up from an advert for an extra large cauldron for sale, slightly used. Ron made a yowling noise that Harry was pretty sure he’d picked up from Crookshanks. “I’m Head Auror, you know. I could have you in Azkaban for that.”
Someone was knocking on his door. Draco was hard pressed to think of how things could get any worse, as he levered himself out of the bath and into a towel, and stomped, dripping and almost nude, to answer the door.
Harry sighed, and squatted down until his backside met the next-to-last visible patch of flooring in the area. “God. Look. Technically, it’s called hoarding. I was seeing someone about it for a little while, like right after school. But I sort of stopped, therapy that is, not the hoarding, obviously, and the clutter got worse, and, well…”
An Ostrich leather box for twelve pens, with twelve seriously expensive pens inside.
Draco froze. “Me?”
“She was telling me about Veela wings,” Teddy mumbled. The tears had stopped, but his cheeks were still wet, and his lashes were spiky. “I didn’t think it through very well.”
“What sort of favour?” It didn’t actually matter, because Harry would definitely do it, whatever ‘it’ turned out to be. He’d follow Malfoy directly off a cliff if it came to that.
Malfoy was a good two hours away, but Harry's mind kept turning back to his imminent arrival, and the item he would be bringing with him, and what he'd then have to
Out of bed, wand located (under the mound of duvet), sheets and pillow slips stripped from the bed and Banished to the washing hamper. Pile of clothing following swiftly behind. New linen on, duvet shaken briskly and re-laid neatly over the fresh sheets, everything tucked away with tidy hospital corners - a silent moment of thanks to Molly Weasley who had taught all her boys the necessary housekeeping spells, and well - pillows vigorously fluffed and arranged in the correct order. Cup restored back to being 50p, and coins sent marching downstairs to be relocated in the designated jar with their fellows on the front hall stand. Curtains opened a little wider to let the cool air better circulate, and to finally chase the bewitching dim gold of the night before away with the fresh, white sunshine of an autumn morning.
“Oh, I don’t know. Reckon there might be someone out at Sourton who wouldn’t mind being here instead just now.”
"Why would you bother? There's little point to it. If the Ministry were reasonable, I'd never have been convicted. I lied for you, for fucks sake! I lost my whole family, I lost my home, I lost every solid reminder of my past. All I have left are my memories and two blocks of marble with my parents' names on them. If the Ministry couldn't appreciate that at trial, what the hell good do you think you're going to do."
,” Draco repeated.
“Yours will be along soon, too, I’m sure.”
There was a hand on his shoulder, turning him around - Potter had gotten up and was standing before him, his eyes glittering again, not with tiny images of celebrities and white-haired smiling men; with all kinds of feelings, what of, Draco didn't know, but he wanted desperately to ask Potter to close them and just back away, just a little. But Potter came closer, looking earnest, and Draco had a wild thought, that maybe there was only one way of showing what it had meant, to have someone like Potter forgive someone like
“Get going, tart, you’re wasting vital seduction time. And be gentle,” he called after her. “Don’t break all my friends.” Merlin knows, it wasn’t like he could just Conjure up more.
“Hey,” Harry said as they reached the topmost step. He caught Malfoy’s elbow and pulled him to a stop. “I wanted to say thanks. For tonight. I had a good time, even though I sort of didn’t want to come, and - and also, thanks for being so...understanding. For being so kind to me. I didn’t expect it.” Malfoy raised an eyebrow and Harry quickly realised how that might have come off. “Uh - no, that sounded horrible. Sorry. I mean to say, it’s not exactly how we’ve behaved in the past, with each other. This was - you’re - erm.” So much for the control over the flush.
“Fantastic,” Harry said, looking forward to this being over. Hosford started to pack up his bag, and Harry re-buttoned his shirt. “So, is it common for Healers to make house calls?”
“Why?”
“No. I’m not -” Harry cleared his throat and stepped slightly closer. “This is hard for me, Malfoy. I find it hard to let go. To be, uh...vulnerable, I suppose.” That was possibly the most honest thing Harry had told anyone in a long time, and perhaps it was weird that it was in the middle of a Muggle nightclub, to Malfoy, but it was about time he gave the issue air. He
“Dartmoor.” Potter stood, dusted off his knees, and re-folded the map. The magic sample he capped in a small glass phial, and placed in his pocket. “Side-Along okay?”
Except Draco. The Undersecretary had been in top form the previous evening, dripping wet and hopping mad, and yelling at Draco at the very top of his lungs for having the carelessness and lack of foresight not to install a safety fence around the perimeter of the Mermish Ambassador’s tank so that innocent guests like himself would not have to suffer the indignity of falling in and nearly drowning. There was no point in using logic to respond; Draco simply nodded, and accepted it. A fence would have effectively isolated the Ambassador of course, and no other guests had been
Her mouth twisted, and she said with great amusement. “A very big bird. Cranky one. Keeps its nest right on top of its head.”
Devlin blinked, and looked from his delivery to Harry, and back again. “Oh – yes, good one, Mr Potter. Mr Weasley sent for me urgently, and asked me to bring these samples over as a priority. From the Throttlebottom case.”
Potter must have heard something in his voice. He looked at Draco over his shoulder as he pulled the joggers up over his hips. “Unless - did you want to shower first, or?”
Potter shifted up Draco’s thighs onto Draco’s lap, and he half sat to meet Potter’s mouth in a bruising kiss. His mouth was warm and savoury from the beer and gravy, his lips hard against Draco’s, devouring each other, their fingers in each other’s hair - Potter’s a curly wreck of silky tangles that felt like heaven under Draco’s hands.
“Potter,” Malfoy’s eyes practically glowed with fury. “What am I hearing?”
Shacklebolt was not pleased that the case was still open, and the cock-bush still flowering, but at least he seemed satisfied that Harry was doing his utmost to get to the root of the problem, so to speak. Throttlebottom was apoplectic. The dicks had now flourished and multiplied to the point that it was no longer possible to reach the front door of his cottage without liberal use of a slashing hex, and the
She turned and picked a slender bottle of amber-coloured liquid from the shelves, and poured a measure into each glass. The alcohol looked thick and smelled like honey. “This is mead from a little village in Poland called Stara Wieś. Absolutely lush but it’ll also knock you right on your arse, so pace yourselves.” Clementine placed the bottle on the countertop alongside the glasses. “Now, I want you to take these and find yourselves a nice cozy spot to get reacquainted, and I’ll check in on you every now and then to make sure you don’t need any provisions.”
“You smell fine,” Malfoy said, his voice low.
“Absolutely not,” Draco said, with such venom that Harry nearly expected to see fangs emerge from between his thinned lips. “I don’t want any more of your former lovers in our house.”
. I’ve never heard a breath of scandal. There’s never once been a leaked naughty photo, or an exposé from a former lover.” Malfoy’s eyes felt like they were looking straight through him. “What’s that about?”
Ron looked thoughtful as he chewed. “I’m secure in my heterosexuality, but I’d try anal, at least once, see what all the fuss is about.” He waved his chopsticks in Harry’s face. “The anus is full of very sensitive nerve endings, you know, Harry.”
“Mmmm,” Draco closed his eyes happily, and turned the water off. “That’s going to go straight to my hips.”
“I should have had you with me, Blaise! Then perhaps I wouldn’t have spent ￡800 on a single scarf.” Harry chuckled indulgently. “Then again, perhaps I would have spent even more.”
Potter's posture stiffened immediately. "Do - do you not want to live here anymore?"
His mouth twisted in a smile. “Bit different, Ron, but thanks. I guess I’m saying that a lot of time has passed and a lot has changed, and I would definitely need to talk about it with him before anything else happens, but I think I can put it behind me. He’d have some things he’d need to be able to move past too.”
“Yes,” Ron said, entirely seriously. “You’ve never given me extra sausage.”
Malfoy pursed his lips, and slid the card away again. “Is Her Majesty here tonight?”
“Blaise really knows his shit,” Draco said, impressed. He recounted the instructions Theo had given, enabled the editing function, zoomed in a little then cropped the picture at his shoulders, taking the phone away. It meant you couldn’t see his hair anymore, which was a shame, but the rest of it left absolutely nothing to the imagination. There would be no way Potter would mistake this backside with anyone else’s.
Sleeping with Potter had been a mistake. The box was breaking, maybe it was already broken, but he couldn’t live feeling like this. It felt like dying. And Draco was a coward, after all.
“I’m not a
“Mate, here’s the thing. You were super intense about Malfoy for like, the whole of school,” Ron started.
“I had no idea you even knew how to use it,” Harry said, amazed. “Who taught you about the Sky box?”
“Barely. Her name was Tiina. And that bathroom was almost more traumatising than the cheese.” Draco looked at him, his face pink and soft. “That was so early. We’d only been seeing each other a little while.” Draco’s mouth turned down. “And you saw every undignified moment through those fucking bathroom walls,
“You don’t know that,” Draco sulked.
“Yessss,” Draco moaned. “I mean, no! God, Harry, you know what I want,” Draco’s breath stuttered as Potter’s fingers skimmed his prick. “Just give it to me.”
The words stung, and Malfoy knew they did. Harry could tell by the angry flush crawling up his neck, and the way that he made his outburst without ever looking Harry in the face. He'd spent enough time in close quarters with Malfoy after the war, to know the telltale signs of his humiliation. Among other things.
“Ginevra.” Draco took his bag from his pocket before he sat, and enlarged it again, fussing around with his bottle of water and a bag of wine gums. “I didn’t know you were such a fan of organised childrens sport.”
Hermione, who had been typing intently on her mobile, looked up curiously. “What three things?”
Malfoy smiled at him. Devastating.
“What do you need the food handling license for?” Harry asked without meaning to.
“It was a bit much to take in,” Draco said. “It’s hard to believe you might have feelings for me, when it seems like you don’t know me at all.”
stupid thing to do, darling, honestly.”
He took a mouthful of his drink. “I’ve been around. Just around different places. Different times.”
“I’d shag you, Weasley, of course.” The table erupted into whistles, and Harry hid behind a big gulp of beer. “I’ve looked in the change rooms, I won’t deny it. Despite your personality, you’ve got a tidy little situation going on there - well, perhaps not so little.” More hoots and whistles. “And you can’t say anything to annoy me if your mouth is full.”
. I still love her now, she’s one of my best friends. But, erm.” His glass was hopelessly smudged now with sweaty fingerprints. “I started to realise somewhere along the line that I also sort of wanted to…” Harry cleared his throat again.
“So what about Saturday?”
Harry said nothing, but he didn’t really need to, because Malfoy shuffled out of Harry’s bedroom looking rumpled, well rested, and rather delicious. He went brick red when he caught sight of Harry and Ron, who both raised their mugs of tea in greeting, and stomped off to his own room, slamming the door.
Harry shrugged. “Well, it could still be something like that, but it’s not clear yet whether this thing is just intended as a nuisance, or if there’s something more harmful lurking under there. Digging the garden up has done nothing to stop these things growing back, nor has removing the original cursed object,” Harry gestured towards the dildo, lying prone on a tray on the bench between them. “The fact that the cuttings wouldn’t grow here in the lab is perplexing. I had two planted in soil samples from the Throttlebottom’s garden, and one in fresh soil as a control, and it grew in none of the test pots. I even buried the original and nothing happened, which indicates that there is something very specific about that garden or those people that is directly related to the activation of the curse. I’d be very hesitant to use any sort of magic to get rid of them until we know it won’t backfire and cause even more cock-related disasters. Which means Throttlebottom is probably going to pay the Minister another visit soon, which means the Minister is probably going to pay
They kissed, open-mouthed, slow, lingering. “Roll over a bit - let me fix your back,” Potter murmured into his mouth after long, heady minutes. Draco did as told, and Potter’s healing magic washed over him for the second time that day, the stinging lines of Potter’s scratches gone as quickly as they’d been made. Potter smoothed his hands over Draco’s shoulders, up and down his spine, dug his thumbs into his muscles. Draco was loose, dazed. Drunk on it. Drunk on pleasure, drunk on his feelings. Potter had never doted on him like this. It felt like something was changing between them.
“Fuck off, you prick,” Harry laughed, but only because his neighbours were old and mostly deaf. “Thank you for coming ‘round.”
Muggle trend deserved to be eaten slowly by angry voles.
“Uhhh, marry and kill Robards. Marry him so I can get close enough to kill him, you know? How else will I get his job, the fucker’s never going to retire.”
The wine was beginning to make him feel sick. Laughter lifted above the roar of the pub, and Draco
“You’re my best friend, too,” Harry said, his voice a little thick. He looked away, down the length of the dark wood of the bartop, sticky rings of wet and puddles of drink glittering in the light, and the knocks and notches of a hundred years of use, or more. “Don’t tell Ron, though, he’s barely accepted Ginny’s position in the hierarchy and it's been ten years.”
Draco looked up from his report, distracted. Potter leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed over his chest and a smile twitched at one corner of his lips. Around Draco was a graveyard of partly drunk, stone cold cups of tea, some nearly full, others further along. Some, disconcertingly, had formed a light scum on the surface, which was revolting, and unbecoming of a Malfoy.
“Malfoy,” Potter leaned back in his chair again and replaced his glasses. There were fingerprints on the left lens, and Draco tried not to fixate on it. His fingertips felt itchy. “You have to stop judging me by what my seventeen-year-old self might have done. It’s been a long time since I was that kid. I’ve moved on. I’m thirty-one, although I understand why my youthful good looks might have confused you.”
There was a knock at Draco’s office door. Marjorie Pierce stuck her head in, an odd expression on her face.
Ted’s eyes lit up. “The whole tournament?”
and your fucking pranks to punish me. They’ll split us up, Potter, or haven’t you thought that far ahead?” Malfoy laughed, and that was cold too. “Of course you haven’t. Or you have, and you don’t care. Maybe you want another partner. Great opportunity to get rid of Malfoy once and for all.”
“What are you drinking? Hemlock?”
he was coming, oh sweet fuck, he was fucking coming.
Harry did as he was told, and tried his best to express his appreciation for all Draco’s other bits as well.
Draco looked at him. “You have file codes, I presume?”
Harry drew in a fortifying breath. "Listen, Malfoy. In relation to my investigation. I’m at the point where I need to do some practical tests with the specimens. I need to test the cursed objects during their usual function."
, right? And that-” Harry repeated the process with a purplish wave, positioning it on a new row right below the blue. “-that’s the
Draco shook his head. “No, Harry. You hear, but you don’t listen.” Draco levitated the cake away, and moved closer. “What did you wish for?”
“Nope,” Ron said with a grin, and scooped several salted macadamia nuts from the dish in front of Draco, throwing them into his mouth and chewing. His grin soon turned into a grimace. “Wow, that did not taste like what I expected. Sort of a weird texture, innit?”
“Yeah,” Harry breathed, swaying into Malfoy. “I guess that’s it. I want someone to know me before they get to know my body. I could let down my guard for someone like that.”
"One thanks. Oh, are we out of milk?"
Potter’s fingers pressed into Draco’s shoulder, and Potter grinned at him in a way that made his throat immediately dry. Draco took a quick swig of his drink, which was getting distressingly low. “None that I can demonstrate in public, but I’d be happy to show you privately a bit later?” Draco choked on a mouthful of bubbles, and Potter grinned even more, and guided him by the shoulder toward a cluster of nearby guests. “These old farts look like they have a few galleons to spare,” Potter murmured directly into Draco’s ear. Draco, for his part, was completely unable to reply. “Ladies, gentlemen; thank you so much for coming tonight. Have you all met Draco Malfoy?” Draco applied his most genuine smile, and set about shaking hands and murmuring ‘hello’ as if a reel of completely inappropriate visions of Potter and his potentially hidden talents were not playing at high speed in his head. “Draco is responsible for this wonderful evening,” Potter gestured around them, and the old witches cooed. “I dare say, he’ll make a terrific Undersecretary when Mr Scrivener retires. I certainly wouldn’t object to being under Draco.” Potter turned to Draco with an enormous grin. “Of course, there’s always a chance he may end up under
“Consulting? On what? How to be rich and idle?”
“Greatest strength?”
“That’s not everything, though, is it Draco?” Theo rubbed his face tiredly.
“Good,” he said, pink. “You look very nice, did I say?”
Harry’s pulse lurched again as he greedily read the reply.
“I don't think that’s quite the deterrent you intend it to be,” Harry said, feeling his pulse quicken at the thought of Malfoy baring Harry’s arse and taking his hand to it. And since when had
“Something funny?” Potter’s voice sounded strained, and he drew back from Draco, almost to the very edge, before driving back in with a grunt.
It was a large clock, entirely made of crystal with a gold face. It was horrible, tacky, heavy, and apparently of no sentimental value.
Ron scoffed. “You had hair. Hairiest bloke in our dorm. You were a right hairy bastard from a young age, made me feel bloody inadequate.” Harry stared at him. “What? Are you saying you never looked in the showers? Everyone looks. I bet you could pick my penis out of a line up.”
fair. Malfoy growing up hot was unfair. Harry growing up to be a workaholic with no sex life was most certainly un-fucking-fair. Sodding Balter Throttlebottom bossing him about was right up there, too. All he’d wanted was
“That was a nice touch, by the way,” Potter gestured toward the enormous hourglass filled with glittering gemstones in the very centre of the ballroom. As donors dropped donation pledges written on squares of white card into the collection box in front of the hourglass, a corresponding shower of gems fell into the lower bulb. “Just like Hogwarts.”
Draco let out a small moan. “Seriously, can’t a man have a moment's peace?”
“How dare you,” Draco said, finally finding his voice, and he found Potter’s fingers with his own and wound them together.
“Like them - Harry, this stuff, it's incredible.” He held a Fendi satchel in his hands. “I’m fucking furious with you!”
or something. I think he’s just half asleep.”
Draco ground his back teeth. “Ten more minutes. Finish your pint.”
Harry barked a surprised laugh. “I can confirm I haven’t forgotten, thanks Malfoy.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, clearing his throat. “Yes, that would be very helpful, thanks Malfoy.” He waved his wand in a sharp motion, and both the King Dong and Amy glowed faintly purple. “When you’re ready.”
“Gossiping,” Ginny said. “Malicious slander.”
Harry was feeling far less indulgent by hour four, when they got to the chests of forks.
“I know you all think me an idiot,” Harry said, viciously crushing a Twiglet with the butt of his glass. “But I’m well aware you all know I fancy Malfoy.” It was inaccurate to say it had started that night after the pub, because it had really been going on for some time, just all one-sided. Harry’s side, specifically.
Some sweaty, heady minutes later, Draco pulled away with a gasp. “Brute. Let me up for a minute.” Harry rumbled a protest, about how Draco had only just said that brutishness was what he wanted, and Draco hummed in agreement, forgetting to be difficult for just a moment. “Harry...mmmf, just one minute, my love.” He briefly tightened his arms around Harry before he was allowed to roll away to the edge of the bed to pull on his pants. Harry watched him pad quietly into the ensuite with bare feet - he loved any opportunity to watch the bunch and stretch of Draco’s tight little arse and long thighs, he could just take a
Draco was just veering sharply towards a particularly bushy fern, when Potter did it. He prised the plastic lid from the take away cup, pulled out what was clearly a very soggy tea bag, considered it for a moment, and then put it in his mouth. The sharp, sucking noise was loud in the otherwise silent corridor, and Potter closed his eyes and made a happy sound, looking very much like a cat who had caught a mouse, the bedraggled cotton string of the tea bag hanging from one corner of Potter’s mouth like a skinny white tail. Draco felt the smile break across his face.
“Morning, Malfoy. You alright?”
“What about Tuesday?” Malfoy sipped his tea.
“Everything was written all over it. This is serious. Way past casual. How have you kept this from us for so long?” Theo shook his head in amazement. “I can’t believe you’ve been shagging hot Potter for half a year, and fell in love with him and everything, and you managed to keep it a secret!”
, so Harry should be able to do the same. Malfoy hadn’t noticed, as he was tapping the next phone number into his mobile.
“Potter,” Draco murmured into his ear. “We’ve barely sat down. We can’t leave this early, nobody would let us live it down.”
Harry winced.
The kitchen was cold and quiet. Harry made toast, and after a moment of hesitation, smushed some cold, leftover risotto over the top. He supposed he might have heated it on the stove without magic, but he was far too hungry to wait that long, and he had no idea where the matches might be. Draco’s notebook -
“Stop crying, Ronald.”
Draco pushed his hair out of his face. It was still sticky from Ted’s hands, and knotty. Which meant it had probably been standing on end while he was at Potter’s,
“Sorry,” Potter looked stunned. “Did you say ‘Summoned’?” Verity nodded miserably.
Breakfast. God, but he loved breakfast. Harry supposed it hearkened back to their school days, at Hogwarts. Big, hot breakfasts, mountainous piles of bacon, and toast, and eggs, and pancakes. It was kind of a nostalgic thing, in many ways. A daily reminder of the good old days of long wooden benches, boys and girls jostling, and giggling, and pinching, and kicking, and burping the alphabet and the Hogwarts song. A reminder of some of the best talks he'd ever had with Ron, and Hermione, and some of the best essays he'd ever written in the very last minutes before they were due, decorated with crumbs and splashes of pumpkin juice and spots of ink.
“Yes,” she said unhappily. “But I think I was a bit excited, and I ended up
Hermione squeezed his forearm and smiled at him. “My poor, sad boy.”
“It’s not the beer.” It was, somewhat. He snatched it back. “Wanker.”
Nineteen silver finger bowls.
“Scared,” Draco countered. “You know I wasn’t seeing anybody else though, between your birthday and then?”
Malfoy’s smile was liquid. “You look good, Potter. Scruffy suits you. Never managed to pull it off, myself.” Harry immediately had at least fourteen simultaneous fantasies of Malfoy pulling himself off and bit down on his lower lip, hard. “I suppose I was always a bit jealous of you in school for that. The effortless sex appeal, just-jumped-off-a-broom thing. It was magnetic.”
There was still silence, as they stared at each other for several moments - there was always so much silence between them, too much, but Draco had a feeling it wouldn't always be that way.
Harry looked around them. Water pooled between the cushions on the couch. There was a portrait of Draco's mother over the mantle which looked decidedly soggy and pissed off. The thick green pile of the carpet looked more like an under-sea landscape than the tasteful floor covering in Draco's study.
“You just said fuck in front of the baby, too.” He elbows her back, but she somehow manages to deflect him, and instead he just smashes his elbow into
“The name’s Du-”
Harry grasped for his glasses, eyes weary and dry. Once on, he became properly aware of the sheer debauched state of his bedroom. Last night's outfit was piled on the floor in front of the full length mirror, which was spattered with come, no less, and there was a greasy handprint (probably lube) on the glass as well, and quite a bit more of both on the sheets of his bed. The duvet was a mound on the floor. He was nude in his bed, which was not how he normally preferred to sleep - if there was an emergency in the night he had to be ready to leap into action without his bits flying around all over the place and getting in the way. No - he always wore pants, at the very least, and had pyjamas at hand. Sleeping nude felt naughty, especially the sort of nude he was right now. Sticky, and a bit red in places that didn’t bear thinking about. God, if there
Clementine raised her eyebrows. “Lucky boy.”
He turned away from the lewd display now spread on his duvet and quickly searched for the number for Throb on his mobile. Darling, the door bitch (that’s what Malfoy’d called her, Harry thought guiltily) answered sweetly even though it was only three in the afternoon.
"It's brilliant."
“Oh, have a bloody day off, Malfoy!” Potter was laughing out loud now, and didn’t seem embarrassed at all. “That smirk of yours.”
He wasn’t sure if he nodded, or said yes, or if Malfoy just decided to come in regardless. He carried a cake plate, and on top sat two, fat little cupcakes, one with a candle in it.
hot, how have I not noticed this?” Theo shook himself, then pointed an accusing finger at Draco. “And
Draco smirked and checked his nails. “That's not how I’d pronounce it, but you might be onto something Potter. Seriously though, what do they pay you for?”
He and Ron were the only ones currently in the communal kitchen. Nev was already out for a run, Malfoy hadn’t yet emerged from the room he shared with Seamus, and Ron was rooming with Foley, who seemed to have gone off on his own as well. They were barely two days into this training rotation, four weeks of rooming together in tight quarters in this Academy flat, and they’d already reached the stage of death threats for loud urination.
Potter, to his credit, looked him in the eye. “Good. Very pleased to be alive, thanks to you. I think you’ll be getting Christmas shortbread and Easter buns from Molly for a couple of years or so, after this.”
“I see,” Draco said. “Your references look excellent. Tell me, Mr Potter…what would you say your biggest weakness is?”
“I think it was more morbid curiosity than fantasy,” Harry picks a piece of beetroot from the bowl and lifts it to Teddy’s mouth. He chomps with enthusiasm. There are little bits of feta sprinkled in, he can see now. Ted loves a bit of feta. “Anyway, she’s moved on. Shagging someone else, in fact.”
Past Harry's eyes widened and he nodded seriously.
“Can’t.”
“If I remember correctly, you don’t have anything on tomorrow, is that right?” Malfoy slipped a small, rectangular object out of his waistcoat pocket, something the size and shape of a matchbox. “Just the gym in the evening?”
The witch to his left was in a full-body Bubble Charm. “The owls, sir. They’ve disappeared.”
“Don’t start,” Ron said warningly. “I already have, and it just made him miserable.”
happens to me in - this department.” He caught Malfoy’s climbing eyebrows. “I don't mean that I’m a virgin, I told you that already.” Malfoy sipped his drink in silence, and looked back at him with large eyes. Waiting for Harry to say his piece.
“Yeah...but how long could I keep something up with someone like him? I could never tell him the truth about magic, and we could never talk about some of the most important things in my life - like work, and what happened to my parents, or why I have  so many scars. I don’t think it would work with me and a Muggle.”
Fivepennies caught his eye, and Draco nodded stiffly at her. It was hard to be grateful to the person who had caused this whole fucking mess in the first place.
“Plans for the weekend?”
He wobbled, and Draco held him tighter by the knees. “You did very well out there. Everyone’s very proud of you. Mother even wore the special scarf. At the rate you’re going, you’ll be on your House team in first year.”
Malfoy snorted. “There wasn’t much to memorise. Take this,” Harry obediently held out his hand to receive the little object. “I have homework for you. I want you to spend the day in bed, tomorrow. Spend time with yourself. Touch yourself. Think about what you like. Get to know what turns you on so you can tell someone else how you want to be touched. Unshrink this before you start - I think you’ll find it inspiring.”
Etchells went next, but Harry had no idea what she said, because he was staring fixedly into his lager with ringing ears, and thinking about a world in which he was married to Malfoy. Surely it wouldn’t all be nagging and sexlessness. If Harry were married to Malfoy, he didn’t think he’d be able to stop himself pestering him for sex virtually all the time. Maybe that was where the nagging came in, after all.
