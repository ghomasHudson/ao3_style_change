Harry backed away from the edge. The angle was severe enough that he ended up planting his feet securely and helping Draco up. He had rolled his sleeves up and Harry could see the blurry indistinctness that was once a Dark Mark. So, there had been a war here.
“Can’t it be both?” Harry said from experience. He noted Draco’s use of we. It seemed some things stayed constant. There was no Mark on Draco’s forearm at all. Huh.
He supposed it didn’t matter what he wore, but he still opted for a black t-shirt and black joggers and sat in the kitchen for a few moments, before taking out the Firebird and looking at it.
The break is actually simple for this one, and St Mungo's does it in five minutes, and discharges them with a note for both of them to go home and sleep.
“There was something strange about Greg’s visit though. He made it sound like he was planning something big,” Draco said.
It was to date, the first time he thought Draco had ever said his name. Probably a habit from too many lives Draco had jumped through. Harry could tell his Firebird was still hot as Draco gripped it. Harry reached for him.
Harry felt guilty about his irregular visits, but he pushed through his discomfort to ask Andromeda if he could come for lunch.
"If I understand this would also reduce secondary infections?" Harry interjected when he was done. His expression was so attentive. Draco was aware he practiced most of his speeches on Harry but he never expected Harry to read academic Healer journals.
He had kept a single photo of them on his dresser, taken sometime around his fifth year at Hogwarts at some function. His father straightened Draco’s dress robes and smiled at him.
There was so much relief when he saw Draco. This Harry practically bowled Harry over with the strength of his feelings. It must be exhausting to feel this much all the time. He would have thought a continuing War would make him the opposite—more reserved, more disciplined.
Harry and Draco’s friendship began as a careful thing, played out in neutral territory over years. It was a relationship constrained to a casual nod in Diagon Alley, a polite inquiry in passing at Andromeda’s, and a detente at the explosion of engagements, birthdays, weddings, store openings, baby showers, semesters abroad, and welcome back dinners. And though Harry had grown up expecting his social life to be carefully limited to the small circle of friends at Hogwarts, he was pleasantly surprised by how widely he could share that joy now.
With this information, they issued warrants for a blitz of more low-level operatives to try to confirm what they’ve guessed. Most wouldn’t speak, but a few key people cracked and made a deal to stop themselves from going to Azkaban for decades.
“Beautiful. You look lovely, as always,” Draco said. He was still getting over the fact everyone looked older, although it made sense. They were barely out of their teens when he last saw most of them, and now everyone was in their mid-twenties.
Once in seventh year in a party at Room of Requirement. The gathering had been the kind of thing that was unofficially tolerated by professors. Something about cohort unity across houses. It was a tradition that was established after the Fall of Voldemort that had never gone away.
They spot the same shadowy movements in a smudged and cracked window from the ground below. Even before the building had been half-engulfed in flames, it was a flimsy thing, made of a stack of shoddily Transfigured shipping containers in this forsaken industrial park in Manchester. Harry is looking at him with a question, and despite his recklessness Draco knows Harry won’t go ahead without him.
Harry was in a beautiful lush green forest. A tiny red cardinal alighted on a branch. When Harry went to reach out, bright green vines had bound his hands, thinner than Devil’s Snare. They tightened painfully around his ankles, thighs, wrists and biceps. Harry thrashed, and they only burned more. The vines brushed away his tears and tightened again. The bird watched him now. It spread its wing wide and swooped. Harry woke up in a cold sweat and clapped his hands over his eyes as if they might be in danger of getting pecked out.
Draco swallowed hard. If pressed, he knew he’d be obligated to name the few people that had approached him in his first days back. But Harry waved a hand dismissively.
Harry did not call a mind healer out of any sense of professional preservation, though he should have.
There was a moment where Draco paused, shuddered, and looked at him like a stranger. Harry looked at his Firebird by chance and it glowed red. He looked back at Draco and there was a looping silver chain disappearing into his robes.
Twice a week Draco answered incredibly invasive questions from mind healer Melinda Bar de Houck. She was a witch, but one who seemed perfectly at ease with the Muggle world. She was in her mid-forties, spoke English with a slight German burr and had a collection of cardigans and pins that Draco, despite himself, liked. Her office was a brisk 40-minute walk  from the bookshop in a small plaza.
“First, they came for coffee shops, now they’re turning every pub in this country into a microbrewery calibrated to the tastes of a medieval peasant,” Draco said.
The final time is different. They are, unsurprisingly, hit by a bonding curse. But this one can't be stabilized and doesn't require touch. What it does is link their thoughts.
“You must be very good friends if the curse bound you that tightly,” a mediwizard says on their second day. Draco doesn’t say anything, doesn’t look at Harry.
Since he wasn’t to touch anything, Harry studied Draco's back. His shoulders were definitely broader than they had been in school, arms corded with lean muscle. He hadn’t thought a bookshop required athletic commitment. His posture, even now, was ramrod straight. Harry was finally close enough to see that Draco had an undercut, short at the nape where Draco rubbed it absentmindedly as he paced around in his socks.
Every day he walked the half hour from his flat to the bookshop because he was honestly frightened of all the people he saw milling into the Underground station. He hadn’t realized how many of them there were.
The antechamber was unassuming. Stepping into the larger structure, Harry turned slowly in a circle to take it all in. It looked like someone had built it just yesterday, smooth clay brick, detailed carvings and intact gold inlay tiles. The structure itself was impressive enough, but Harry had never seen a pyramid so well preserved.
“It’s been such a mess. I feel like I have to do everything. There are such wonderful, terrible things in the world to study. But sometimes I think I've inherited the department that attracts the smartest people because they are the most desperate.”
“Thank you for coming,” His mother said. She seemed a little overcome, and Draco steadied her with a hand on her back.
“The time is almost equivalent, give or take a few milliseconds. No matter how many times you jump, you would have three months,” Hermione said. “Tomorrow come in for a test run, then you can start.”
"Look at me. You'll find someone. You will," Draco said with the painful sincerity of someone who had been drinking since early evening. Draco cupped one hand on his cheek.
He had dropped into a ramshackle house. The walls leaned on each other at odd angles like they, too, were tired. The building was mostly empty except for piles of broken concrete, rubble and stray rubbish. Anything that might have made this recognizable as a home had long since been broken or taken. Someone had plastered the front windows with layers of wanted posters. Harry carefully pulled off a poster, and he stared back at himself.
It was drizzling heavily as Harry made his way through Edmonton Green, ducking from shop to shop. He had forgotten his umbrella and raincoat. The streets were crowded enough on a Tuesday afternoon that he couldn’t just Apparate out of there. His toes squelched horribly in his trainers and he idly fantasized about throwing them out to walk barefoot.
Even Harry's glasses were different,  a more rectangular shape with tortoiseshell frames. It suited him. What right did Harry have to go around looking like that in public while Draco was trying to have a breakdown?
“Draco, dearest.” And then she broke all of her rules and hauled him to her, though he was taller than her. She took a deep, shaky breath. She was thinner than he remembered, but when was the last time they held each other like this? Probably as he was arrested and before that, the night Voldemort died.
“Thank you for bringing him back, Gabe. I appreciate it,” His mother said warmly. They must know each other. Had she been checking on him? He turned to her with a question, but she merely beamed at Gabriel.
“The item he took is called a Firebird. It’s an experimental magical device that allows you to jump to alternate universes. When we tested you last year, we had made several prototypes for study. He's taken one. We need someone to look for him,” Hermione said.
“At least that boy didn’t take after Lucius,” His mum said in a slightly disapproving tone. Subtler than Molly Weasley, but there nonetheless. It was surreal to have any insight into her personality. His parents could be something other than a collection of other people’s memories. His throat closed. He wanted to stay. He wanted to stay so badly.
“I can try to get closer,” Zacharias whispered. The charm made it sound like he was speaking directly in Harry’s ear and he hated it.
Harry was not sure what to do with either thought. That alone represented a revelation, and this was a hell of a time for an existential crisis.
Would it have to be so different if they were actually together? But that thought was interrupted by a donor at his elbow.
“Hitwizard Gabriel Warbeck, at your service.” His tone seemed playful, gently mocking Draco for staring, but that didn’t stop him from doing it or stop the slow heat crawling up the back of his neck. He had not
"I just can't imagine, like, ever trying all of that again with someone other than Ginny," Harry confessed. “Like, I can’t imagine even kissing someone else at this point.” Then in their kitchen, Draco had leaned in and kissed him, soft and slow and before Harry's brain could catch up, it was over.
“What, did they starve you as a child?” Draco had meant it as a dark joke, but the ensuing silence was answer enough. Gods, no wonder no one liked him.
They both walked through Diagon Alley, getting pointed stares from passing wizards and witches. Some offered smiles to Harry then their gazes slid to Draco and they frowned. Lavender Brown saw him from outside the Leaky and spat at his feet. It landed nowhere near him, but the sentiment was clear. No wonder his mother still refused to go out in public. Harry didn't react but he didn't greet Lavender either. Draco could feel her eyes on them.
“I can’t believe the British Ministry has convinced the French Ministry not to give me my wand after all these years,” Draco said. He said it without any heat. As if it was exactly what he expected and therefore terribly boring.
Harry couldn't help but gasp. The pyramid was beautiful, throwing off beams of light from glittering limestone. Harry took a swig from his flask as they passed into its shadow.
Draco takes off his shoes at the door. He doesn’t try to catch a glimpse of himself in the mirror as Harry does. He doesn’t even ask what bed is Harry’s. He just locks eyes with Harry and strips to his pants while Harry stands next to the radiator.
“Putting yourself down. I don’t—we don’t think about you like that. You have other interests.” It was almost touching how hard Draco was trying.
There was a universe where apparently he had threesomes with Draco and Hermione. He was uncertain what to make of that. Hermione wrinkled her nose. Neither did she from the way she avoided his gaze.
First Draco went to the end of the Manor with the drawing room. It looked ordinary, and a thick layer of dust and grime had settled over everything. The rug was threadbare and worth nothing. The chairs were in decent condition but needed reupholstery. Nothing was of any actual value and they had moved all personal items out when their unwanted guest of honour had moved in.
Harry got to Grimmauld, showered, and ate an apple (and a sleeve of biscuits). He fell asleep before he even got into bed and slept face down on top of his duvet before jerking awake.
It was just more convenient for Draco to have Harry than another date at these galas, even when it pissed off people they were dating. Harry knew what to say without prompting, he held his liquor well and he was charming. Donors loved him.
“Trainee Malfoy, you’ll do well to remember very few people would disagree with her. Get out of my sight.”
“You’ve never met Fleur and Maddy isn’t here,” Harry told him. Draco’s eyes widened a touch and then his face shuttered.
“You used to say you regretted introducing us again,” Draco said. He said it with a light laugh. Harry opted not to answer that for a moment by taking a large swig of champagne.
Harry didn’t expect anyone to be around when he came by early to finish reports. The master bedroom was closed and he could hear Athena and Kingsley arguing. Not like how everyone argued with one another, but it was startling and loud. It seemed personal. Harry was trying to figure out how to make himself known.
Harry was standing at the main Apparition point in Diagon. A small sticky note in his hand had an address off Knockturn Alley. Harry decided to make his way there. Imagine if all his other selves wrote things down. It would have made this much easier.
Harry thought he finally understood what the word lascivious meant by the way Draco looked at Hermione like she was something to eat and he was starving. She smiled, but Harry could see the panic in her eyes.
Patience Shacklebolt was a whirlwind of a woman. As a muggleborn, Kingsley had sent her off in an illegal international portkey during the war. Harry had spent little time around Patience aside from the occasional Department function, but he liked her.
Draco was stretched above him lit by the moonlight from Harry's window. He was even paler than Harry had imagined.  And he had in great detail. Now he knew exactly how he looked, from the dip of his hip, to a sprinkling of freckles and light blond hair on his chest and exactly what few childhood scars Draco had left after having erased most of the rest of the war from his body. The black solid band wrapped around his left forearm in contrast.
“I’ll be sure to get you vinegar someone’s pissed in so you can both have something you’ll enjoy,” Draco shot back, shrugging their hands off.
A black hood was placed over his head as they arrived with a drawstring a touch too tight around his neck. He saw a flash of spring leaves, rolling hills, and a few sheep dotted on the horizon. It was colder too. So they must be North somewhere. An international portkey was unlikely.
Draco’s personnel file came in, through his closed fireplace. It hadn’t turned green, just shot from an empty grate onto his kitchen table, smoking slightly.
Curiosity plays over Draco’s features. Draco’s eyes flick to his mouth and then up. Harry would bet all the gold in his vault that Draco is wondering the same thing he is. Is this part as good as Harry remembers or had he allowed their attraction to become overblown with nostalgia?
Draco smiles back and taps his coaster on the table. All at once Harry can see Draco at eighteen with the Draco now superimposed over him. Draco in dress robes, sneering, back rigid. Draco who sits languid in the booth, smiling in a way he never would have let himself before.
And Merlin, Draco’s hands were everywhere. They pulled at his hair, took off his jacket and slid up his back. It was Harry who broke their kiss to mouth around Draco’s jaw, to taste the salt on his skin. Harry allowed himself a few precious seconds longer so he wouldn’t startle Draco and then pulled away to find out where he was. He felt guilty that he had let himself get carried away.
“Were they poor?” Draco asked gently. It was probably the closest they had come to personal topics recently and apparently Draco had led them straight to Childhood Trauma.
Even if they’d looked nothing like him, he would have known those were his children. His heart swelled a little at the sight. There were a few more of their friends, and it surprised him to see one of his sons pressed cheek to cheek with a blond boy who was the spitting image of Draco if he were a rather round preschooler. He would bet Galleons it was his kid blowing bubbles at the camera on a loop.
“Or half a street in Port Talbot. The Department took ten weeks to tell me they weren’t certain if it was possible,” Harry said.
He did not read the rest of the letter. He could not read the rest of the letter. He held his mother while she sobbed until his robes were wet with tears and her voice was almost gone.
“Half of them still think I’m spying for the French,” Malfoy chuckled as they entered the balcony. “The French paid better than our own country, to be perfectly honest. If I’d known that’s all I’d be accused of for the next decade, I might have been tempted.”
"Maybe this is the beginning of my budding career as an equestrian," Harry says, and this time Draco actually laughs.
He found a crowbar in Sirius' bedroom one evening that hadn’t been there last he looked. He circled around the house, looking at all the dark wood panelling downstairs. He pried one board off. Underneath there was crumbly grey painted plaster. As Harry used his weight to break it off entirely, the board splintered and the house seemed to shiver.  After the first dozen boards, Harry got the hang of it.
“You’ll come back then?” Harry still worried sometimes, with Draco working on the Firebirds. Their relationship was new enough that Harry worried if this was enough to compete with all that was out there and everything he studied. “You won’t stay too long?”
When Draco finally moved away, Harry pulled him down for one more kiss before letting him stumble backwards.
The first house Pansy shows them in Godric's Hollow looks like a haunted fairytale cottage. Ivy creeps along the eaves, and the shape is vaguely reminiscent of a farmhouse. There are two small circular dark windows deep set in the one story house like eyes. When they step inside, the entire colour scheme is muted, drab greys, greens and browns.
On the wireless at work one day, he heard a pundit say: “I’m sorry but it seems that magic society has become weak. No one is allowed to have any opinions anymore. We’re not to say anything true. What about the fact there are legitimate questions about how muggleborns acquire magic? Is no one allowed to say that without being accused of being a Death Eater?”
The best because he was so happy to see everyone: Margaret from Paediatrics, Jim from Intake, most of his year in Spell Damage, some of his unit, all his childhood friends.
“Dean was so drunk when Ron did this to him that he cried over the ‘84 Quidditch championship,” Ginny confessed.
“You don’t know how? Weren’t you raised by—” Draco abruptly cut himself off. Harry was embarrassed, but the Dursleys never bothered allowing Harry out enough for him to learn about the Underground.
Harry reached around his neck and took off his Firebird and put it on the desk. He also showed Draco his empty wand holster, rolling up his sleeves. Harry took off his glasses too; Draco must know by now he couldn’t see much without them.
They still lost on Saturday, but from then on asked him to fly and join them for all the drills. Sometimes they would laugh at him as he struggled through the harder bits; after all, he wasn’t thirteen anymore. Gryffindor played well enough and took a reasonable second in the House Quidditch rankings for the year. All his students passed. Most of the seventh years got an O or E on their NEWTs.
They went much, much slower after that as if Draco’s words had tamped down the urgency but left behind the tenderness. There was nothing as sweet as watching Draco close his eyes as he came apart underneath his hands. Or afterward, when Draco turned his attention to him, all his slyness put to good use when Draco pulled Harry to the edge of the bed and sank to his knees.
Harry hadn’t known that. He had thought it had just been a random place his parents had picked and happened to die. Harry knew by now that Draco wasn’t interested in straying too far from their timeline. Godric’s Hollow’s significance could be different in his world, but it never occurred to him to ask. He realized again that he’d been denied so much knowledge.
“I don’t need your charity. And I already know you’re behind the Ministry ordering from my shop,” Draco accused. Harry didn’t deny it. Sounded like something he’d do.
“It’s okay. You can tell me whatever they are calling you, and you won’t get in trouble for bad words,” Harry reassured him.
“I knew that. I should go read,” Draco said, taking his food and orange juice on a tray. Harry didn’t stop him. He left him alone in the Black family library all day.
“Some of the muggles at school call me names,” Teddy admitted. He looked more like himself now and less of a miniature Harry with his customary blue. He wasn’t old enough to always be in full control of his abilities when he was emotional.
“May I?” Narcissa asked. But she didn’t wait for the healer’s answer and threw her arms around him. They stayed like that for a few brief moments and Harry watched. He was aching desperately to hold him too, but this was important and he could wait. For all he knew, Draco was about to be furious with him.
After a year, he took her up on a single potion to try. He wanted to sleep uninterrupted. He wanted to make some progress. He wanted to be a better person, or at least one who wouldn’t have put himself here. But it was difficult to say he wasn’t sure he deserved it.
“They were mistaken. I’ll sit with them,” Harry said. Damn him, he was curious. He wanted to know this version of them both.
Draco rubbed the bridge of his nose with annoyance. Nothing had changed in five years on the Ministry incompetence front. He could see how he could be useful. And although he wanted to act like it meant nothing to him, the idea of being barred from being a Healer cut him deeply. If Draco couldn’t manage it with seven NEWTs and a letter from Harry Potter himself, then at least he would know it would never be possible.
goes unspoken but Harry feels it in Draco’s heated sigh, the shivering of his body, the warmth of his breath when they stop kissing but still have things to share.
“Who cares where he goes? Let him run. Merlin knows he’s probably looking for his dead parents,” Harry said emphatically.
“No, you don’t understand. I’m not talking about arithmancy." Harry hesitated then decided to go ahead.
Harry tapped twice and suddenly it was colour-coded: green for cashflow, yellow for research, red for operations, blue for trading.
“You could come to Zurich to visit. I’d like that,” Draco says quickly. Harry feels a cautious hope spread.
“That sounds good for you. I didn’t think the Aurors would have been a good fit,” Draco says. That's a more delicate way of putting it than Draco had put it back then, which was something like, “I think it speaks poorly of the institution that a third of the Aurors went to Azkaban for war crimes and another half joined a vigilante group to stop them, but what do I know? I’m a Death Eater.”
The Chief Warlock was Griselda Marchbanks, and he didn’t even have to look up to recognize her gravelly voice.
“How am I to keep up with all this new language? I changed the important one about blood status, so I think I’ve done quite well for myself,” Pansy sniffed.
Draco has some defenses. Harry has none. In Auror training when everyone picked a specialty course, Harry had said tersely ‘none of that' to Draco and avoided Legilimency altogether. Draco went to defensive mind magic; Harry had done a course in advanced weaponry.
She ordered a glittering chocolate torte for the table. Maybe Draco should slip Harry a few Galleons. Harry had never dined with the likes of Pansy Josephine Parkinson before he agreed to pay for the bill.
"I thought it was illegal to own this?" Draco asked, pointing to one of the photographs of a cursed and very hideous medieval breastplate that had crushed at least three owners to death. Harry shrugged.
“No,” He repeated it every time she mentioned the potions. The ones for sleep. Another when he mentioned being scared of dark, enclosed spaces so he always ran up from the basement of the shop.
Once, he manages to corner Draco after a department-wide briefing but as he approaches, Draco shakes his head subtly. Harry feels hurt but he changes directions and goes back to his desk by a long, circuitous route.
"Harry. I'm Draco's date. Pleased to meet you." Harry looked like he had shaken hands just this side of too hard.
“Harry. It’s been a while,” Hermione said. Her tone was unmistakably icy. How could it have been a while since he saw his best friend?
Harry noticed that Draco stuck his tongue out slightly when he was concentrating and it made it harder to think.
"I know. I know. But Robards suspected something with the medical clearances. And if we wanted to keep clear of the fraternization rules, it can't look like this started while we were partners.”
“I didn’t love him when we first married. We knew each other but not terribly well and he didn’t open up to me. I didn’t open up to him either. I didn’t really know how. I had never been taught to be vulnerable in any significant way,” his mother confessed. Despite himself, he was curious.
“No one could come when Ted died. I didn’t think even you deserved that,” Andromeda said. A chill crept into her voice and his mother looked chastened. It was so strange to witness. After all these years estranged they still sounded alike.
“Forgive me, I forgot your approach is probably the same for both,” Draco said. “Too fast and without pacing yourself.”
Penny was somewhere to his left. Zacharias shifted in the water somewhere behind him and Harry fought the urge to kick him. Even a muffling spell might tip off someone that they were there so he needed to stop moving.
Funny enough, it was that sentence that shocked Harry into reflecting despite the lovely meal and stroll, he was here for a reason. Florean in his universe had died. Draco knew what ice cream flavours his children liked. Here was Harry, licking a chai ice cream cone like none of it mattered. Draco handed him the bag as they finished.
“Don’t know why you and Draco had to rent a flat in London. Godric’s Hollow is important,” his father said.
The pyramid loomed in the distance, appearing suddenly when they passed through some invisible barrier. Harry couldn’t tell if it had been five minutes or an hour they had been walking since the heat had a way of distorting time.
“They said I’m like you,” Teddy said, barely above a whisper. Harry was confused, what about him would strange muggle children know? Then it hit him.
“Tea? Coffee? Maybe a book?” Draco said, drawing it out. Draco wanted to hear him say what he was thinking.
The kiss had been a dare and Draco had kissed him easy as anything, playing it up for the crowd until Pansy told them to knock it off. Suddenly confronted with a lap full of Draco Malfoy, Harry froze and let him sit there for an hour all the while knowing he was doing something wrong. Ginny had kissed Michael Corner too, but it wasn't the same. She wasn't Michael's friend in that way. Harry spent half his time outside class studying with Draco, or arguing with Draco or sometimes even napping with him.
“You’re Michael’s friend, Harry, aren’t you?” a woman asks. Harry nods. She's very pretty and around his age. She has thick, dark curly hair, and wears a pristine blue sundress with cheap black flip flops. Harry finds the contrast interesting.
Each door has remained closed as far as he knows. Draco pushes them open by hand, only to encounter the same. Brief darkness, then the steady flickering of a candle which reveals another decaying room. A grand piano warped by rainwater, bloated and cracking along the seams. Moth-eaten silk curtains. Signs someone has fled with the silverware and gold-edged pink china sets. Broken windows in several rooms, smashed inward and outward.
Harry looked at them all as if they were speaking Swedish. It must seem strange to him, but that Theo even mentioned his mum meant he was firmly one of theirs now.
“I don’t live far,” Draco says, apropos of nothing. Harry thinks it might be an invitation. Harry licks his lips.
“It’s clearly a Dark object, but it wouldn’t naturally hold that much power,” Draco said, as if it was extremely obvious.
“What are they calling you?” Harry said. He knew better than most how cruel children could be when they sensed something different. But Teddy shook his head.
Harry went back to one universe a day schedule afterwards. He could not keep his head clear enough without it. He took a day to rest. He shaved his beard which was unruly with neglect. It had been so long he had to do a trim first with scissors. He had taken a shower remembering the grime of the last universe. He had flossed, and changed his sheets instead of spelling them clean.
There were other things to occupy him anyway: Harry's apprenticeship with Ollivander, trying to get his parents to believe that he was actually bisexual and not just too shy to tell them he was gay despite their acquaintance with one Remus Lupin, whether Puddlemere would take the Cup, why Draco always finished the milk but never went to Tesco on his way home, whether Neville was actually okay or just faking it, and when he would feel like a real adult.
He went for his wand but Greg was faster. Greg punched Draco in the face so hard he felt a sickening crack and fell back. Within his own walls, if Greg tried to curse him the rebuilt wards would have rebounded it. Blood poured from his nose. Draco rolled onto his knees to make sure he wouldn’t choke on it and fumbled for his wand. Greg appeared to absorb his three stunners in a row. Draco had never seen anything like it.
“But I wouldn’t want to be running from you,” Draco said. He winked and Harry could feel himself blush.
Draco puzzled over his National Art Pass and why on earth something like that would be in his package when a wizard walked in. He was tall, taller than Draco even, deep tawny skin, short curly hair, hazel eyes and...handsome he realized belatedly, in a way that made Draco uncomfortable because it was so foreign to him. His mouth went dry. The wizard looked familiar, Draco just couldn’t place him.
“Look, didn’t he pick the worlds? It sounds like he picked all these places where he was the best possible version of himself,” Ron said.
“No,” Harry admits. “I never ended up joining. I went to uni. And now I mostly teach and do some research at Lexham U. Still Defense,” Harry says. The more they speak, the more Draco’s accent slides back closer to Harry’s.
“You don’t pay me to talk, Harry,” Draco said. He had draped himself in a sheer emerald green silk robe that only reached mid-thigh. His legs were so long. There was so much skin. Harry felt his cheeks heat and looked away.
“Eh?” Draco said distractedly. Harry was about to repeat himself when Draco answered belatedly. “No, by the time you get to any of the other shops, I’ll be done.”
“Valerie, come tell Fatima about the trip,” someone calls from inside the flat. She leaves them facing each other.
So far they had been in a relationship, a general and his spy, coworkers and actual friends. But something as simple as “Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were bound closely by fate” sounded too much like rubbish to consider seriously. Maybe there was something he had that Draco wanted. Draco would not be the first person who had learned Harry had touched the Hallows. And he wouldn’t be the first desperate person to think Harry could bring someone back.
“I won’t apologize to him. We all know it’s true. They should have never let him in. My cousin died in the—”
“Does being a Death Eater come with a pension this time around?” Draco asked between bites. Undercooked and burnt groats with no sugar. What a treat.
“Let’s go,” Draco said. Even though Draco wasn’t that much taller, he walked fast, leaving Harry scrambling to catch up. His borrowed umbrella was heavy. Draco wove expertly through the crowd, only slowing to allow Harry to catch up once every few blocks.
“You’re very good together,” Theo remarked later, as they were walking through Wizarding London. Pansy was talking Harry’s ear off about something up ahead and he was nodding. The hair potion had worn off, so Harry’s hair was starting to get messy again.
“Yes, I think we’ve met before,” Draco says smoothly. He has to lean forward to be heard over the music.
Draco refused to be hurried along with Harry’s  kisses. He wanted to take Harry apart slowly with his lips, tongue, teeth, fingers and cock. He wanted to be inside him and have him inside. He wanted to taste him. So he did.
Often he overheard snippets of their lives and conversations. “If you’re being naughty, we won’t go to the park later,” a mother told her young toddler, who threw himself on the ground and wailed.
Harry followed him out in a daze, and they strolled Diagon. A few stares were directed at them, but they mostly passed over Draco and looked at Harry. Harry would never stop feeling that mix of shame and embarrassment when people paid him any attention at all, even if people had stopped approaching him. Draco placed a hand on his arm and bent over.
“It’s so fucking hot in there,” Harry complained. Belatedly, he realized that generals probably didn’t swear and if they did it probably wasn’t in front of disgraced men they had a questionable acquaintance with.
“It’s still gorgeous,” Harry breathed. Only years of training stopped him from running his fingers along the stone walls. The magic here pressed insistently, like a firm hand on his temple.
“Let me do the counter-curse this time,” Draco said. Harry wasn’t going to argue, and he gestured to Draco to go ahead. Draco turned around.
They found Theodore Nott some months later. Harry didn’t understand the details at all because it was both way beyond his scholarly inclinations and above his security clearance.
Harry could feel the Firebird still hot against his chest, independent of the heat blazing overhead. He wasn’t sure whether it was the proximity charm or something else, but pretty much the only serious warning Hermione had given him was not to jump when it was hot.
Kingsley wrote him that they would be working out of a safehouse from here on out and he only managed to memorize the address before the note disintegrated in his hands in a puff of purple smoke. He was more comfortable in Muggle clothes, and wore a pair of jeans, Nikes and a plain black t-shirt to blend in with the crowds.
“I have to go find my friend!” Harry shouted over the music. The man he was dancing with shrugged and danced off in another direction. The thick press of people’s bodies against his was sweaty and hot.
“But we were told it used to be a literal death wish. A gift from a Gaunt a century back to her mother-in-law,” Harry said.
Harry already knew Draco. He liked it all. He liked it when Draco was funny, even if it tipped a little into meanness. He enjoyed his silence, too. It felt real. He had never required Draco to become a gentle, tameable thing. He just wanted to be allowed to express how much he’d grown to like him without pretending everything that had come before never happened.
“This is an estate, not a house. And it's too expensive.” That's not really a problem for Harry despite cycling through new careers every few years. He shrugs.
Draco put his wand away and held up his hands. “It would be good to do a physical examination too, if I may be permitted?”
"How did we get assigned to evidence archives? Isn't that why we have Ministry archivists?" Harry says, temporarily distracted from the truly remarkable depths of his one-sided crush by Draco's scowling.
“They said your Firebird is malfunctioning. You could get stuck.You can come home!” Harry explained, frantic.
Harry decided to stay through the entire party, talking to everyone. He had never been such an interested conversationalist. It wasn’t strictly necessary to figure out what was going on, but he listened, intent.
The scrape of the kitchen chair was deafening. Harry barely stepped under the spray of the shower before closing his eyes and imagining Draco joining him. He didn’t get much beyond more kissing in his fantasy before he came with one hand braced on shower’s tile wall.
“I didn’t say that you couldn’t do anything,” Draco said. He sounded a little disappointed as if he’d expected Harry to bring himself off in front of him. Harry had some self-control, but not a lot. There was a line of thought that would go nowhere helpful.
No one seems to want to talk about the invocation of self in defensive magic or why some magic can only be shown and not written. Harry has interesting things to say about that. He’s presenting a paper on it this weekend and everything.
Going back to Hogwarts had stirred up a few feelings that he should probably talk to Melinda about next month. He had made three cups of french press coffee and drank it at 6 am. Now closer to mid-morning, he wished his mother had made him eat more than half a scone with jam and an orange as his stomach roiled.
There were groups of students sitting in their uniforms sprawled across the lawn chasing the first bit of consistent sunshine. They looked so young to him that he almost couldn’t believe he had been that small once. None of them seemed to take any interest in him, dismissing him almost immediately as an adult and therefore unworthy of attention.
“Don’t mistake this for something it’s not,” Andromeda snapped in a low, hurt voice. Instead of cutting through the room the way she came, she exited the door to the garden.
“They’ve closed the apparition point,” Draco said, ignoring Harry’s comment. He sounded indifferent to this, but perhaps it was that it was irrelevant to him. He pointed to a triangular symbol faintly glowing red. It had been open when he got there an hour ago.
So maybe he was in training, and he was behind all his peers as far as a career. Most pureblood children didn’t even move out until marriage.
Draco returned, narrow eyed, took one good look at the guy and said, "Fuck off." And because he was Draco Malfoy even with glitter on his face he hadn't come in with, the man listened and shuffled away into the crowd.
“Hold that thought and we’ll be right back!” Hermione grabbed Harry’s hand and walked them to the hallway where the loos were.
Truth was, it wasn’t entirely without basis. With time to examine his life, Harry was starting to re-evaluate.
“We’ve called St Xanthus in Bonn, but it will take at least a day to hear back from the expert there. She’s on maternity leave.”
“Time for you to answer some questions,” one of them said. They pulled the hood halfway up his face, forced his mouth open and dropped something on his tongue. Draco tried to spit, but they covered his nose until he swallowed.
“Will the command centre give us orders to proceed? ” Athena whispered. She sounded impatient, a little growl underlying her tone. Harry could barely see the shimmer he thought was her ahead.
“I wasn’t going to let you all go without me,” Athena said. She glared at him as if expecting him to bring up that she had walked off the investigation.
Draco launched into an extremely thorough evisceration of the incompetence of the Ministry and its bureaucracy until their food came. Draco only paused long enough for Harry to realize that the lamb ragu was what he would have ordered for himself. He was eyeing Draco’s short rib gnocchi while Draco launched into part two of why the whole concept of the Government Legal Department was a crock before winding down.
Harry was still afraid Draco might decide he could never be happy here and leave in the night with the Firebirds. Harry had left them on the kitchen table, all three tangled together. It was almost a defiant thing, leaving it out in the open. But Harry was not Draco’s jailer, and he could leave at any time. Either with a Firebird or by walking straight out the front door.
“No, Teddy. I don’t have my broom with me,” Harry said. Teddy smiled at him with the openness of a five-year-old. If Harry was not a trained Auror, maybe Teddy would have been able to snatch the wand he had left on Andromeda’s living room table. A spray of harmless green sparks went off as soon as Teddy’s hand brushed it.
Draco traces Harry’s lightning scar, across his jawline, the wetness of his full bottom lip. Draco smiles when Harry tries to catch Draco’s thumb with his teeth. Draco traces down his chest with a brief pause to brush his thumb in the hollow where the Horcrux locket had burned long ago. It feels good. It feels so good. So many people Harry has slept with either avoided the scars or paid them too much mind. Harry feels himself drawn to his hands.
“You can find a Cursebreaker apprenticeship wherever you’d like. I cannot. Save us both trouble and go back to camp before you ruin my prospects,” Draco said. Curiously, this sounded like a conversation they had had dozens of times.
George was here. Fred was beside him. Harry found himself staring. In all his travels he had never felt the strangled hope in his chest as he had in this moment. They were together.
“This way,” Harry said. Draco begrudgingly followed. He had not realized that Harry’s hair curled along the nape of his neck when long enough. He tore his eyes away.
Their flat was a rental despite Draco’s complaints it wasn’t cost-effective; Harry had the money and could have forty homes if he wished. It wasn’t like there was a shortage of wizarding homes when you could live in Stornoway and Floo into London for work if you wanted.
“Harry Potter is no doubt shilling hair potion for Witch Weekly and attending ribbon cuttings. I don’t know why he had to walk into my shop to gloat on top of it all.”
“Actually, I’ve spoken to her supervisor and the Department Head.” Here, at least, Kingsley had the modesty to look a little guilty over using his privilege that way.
“I learned this one in New Zealand,” Pansy declared then led Draco in a complicated twirling dance. Draco finally got the hang of it about a half hour later.
“Adora’s all in a tizzy, because she said the Parkinsons accepting the marriage makes her look like a bad person for disowning me,” Theo said, chuckling.
Harry hated it when people made sense. And doubly so when that meant the Minister for Magic was asking him for favours. He couldn’t care less about the devices, but he still had a hard time knowing anyone was in danger. That was why he had left the Auror Department. Someone was always in need of rescue and it weighed on him, whether or not it was his case.
Draco got to the stairs and decided to Apparate to the top rather than climb them. He could rally around for sex, he supposed. But it wasn’t until his tempus charm went off the next morning that he realized Harry had deliberately led him to sleep. Draco silenced his spell and took a few minutes to enjoy being wrapped in Harry’s warmth and grey linen.
Harry had never been close enough to see the starburst pattern in the grey of his eyes. He found it disconcerting somehow.
Harry had a far more charmed life in comparison, but did Harry admire Draco in some small way because he wanted to be him? Or was it because Draco was devastatingly good-looking and he was a tiny bit attracted to him?
There had been things he had been doing for no reason at all, like continuing a relationship with Ginny past its natural end, staying up too late to keep his Auror schedule even though he wasn’t going in and drinking too much. There were things he had avoided doing like cooking in his own kitchen, doing anything about the remaining renovations at Grimmauld or even figuring what he wanted out of his life.
It’s crowded and getting too loud. Harry excuses himself to cut to the balcony on the second floor. He can be social, but he always feels like people can sense he made his first friend at eleven. Even now Harry finds it hard to make acquaintances if people don’t approach him first, especially if it’s not about work. Harry peels the label off his beer for something to do with his hands while he leans on the balcony and looks down the road at the rusty gated park and its blue sign.
“I am the only Potions master certified on this continent to brew twelve Ministry restricted potions. I have fifty exclusive worldwide patents. Tell me, Harry, should I cook?” She said.
All right, fine, Draco wasn't doing so well on the not touching part. It was so much easier to redirect Harry's attention with a touch of the knee, a hand at the small of his back, fingers splayed on his forearm.
Sometimes Harry got it in his head to ask questions though he could tell they pained Draco to answer. But it was a way to fill the morning, afternoons and evenings besides long walks in Muggle London. There was both too much time with nothing to do, and too little as the clock ticked closer and closer to August 15.
“Hi,” Harry said when he felt the change in the air that meant Draco had emerged from the back room. He waited an extra beat before turning around.
Honestly, what the fuck did Theo do at the Department of Mysteries all day that gave him insights like that?
When Harry’s weird choked laughter turned into tears, Draco put an arm on his. When Draco fell asleep, Harry transfigured a couch and laid there until morning, watching him sleep.
Sometimes the house would shift the way Wizarding buildings did. It would seem to take and hold a breath, with the shutters flung open and the hallways bright. And Harry would wonder if he was dreaming then, too. It made him feel like the entire house was only anchored to this universe but for the grace of Merlin. Nothing felt real anymore.
“They sent you?” Draco asked. He stood up straight. All the languorousness of Parisian Draco had left his body entirely.
Theo examined the paintings on the wall in Draco’s bedroom while he and Pansy sat on his settee. Draco would have offended Pansy if he asked her to sit in one of the public rooms, and he wanted something that felt normal.
Since Hogwarts, Draco has learned there are a great many types of magical beings in the world who were not covered in his textbooks and do not particularly care for being found out. The one they had chased out of the crime scene recovery turned on them.
They had it good before all of this. They worked well together, went out to the pub every once in a while, they knew each other’s friends and families. They were friends, Harry thought.
Much of the time he had no context for why he was doing what he did. It was typical for a newbie, but it bothered him that Harry sometimes wouldn’t know until months later who they were tracking or why it was urgent to decommission an object. Sometimes he never found out.
Harry was also trying to figure out how to rally his Quidditch team. Gryffindor seemed to have given up on winning a single match all year. They tried, and they tried hard, but they didn’t work well together. He found himself in the November rain setting them drills so they might bond over how hard they worked. Instead, they seemed more and more defeated.
“We’re not seventy-five years old, we’re not doing a bus tour,” Michael Corner says firmly, tossing the flashing conference pamphlet advertising just that into the tiny plastic bin under the desk of their shared hotel room.
“At the same time the shipping container at Greenwich was bombed, the Muggleborn Resource Centre was bombed by Prima. Five of the Muggle information booths in Central London were also bombed. There were no casualties. We are incredibly lucky this time. It will get worse.” Kingsley was barely speaking above a whisper.
"I never said," Draco agrees mildly. Draco seems to read the exact moment Harry gives in. They do not have three days to catch the kind of people who would plant Dark objects in playgrounds. Harry turns to Healer Ahmed. "Can we be discharged?"
“Listen to this. ‘An eye-popping display from our saviour.’ Then they zoom in on his crotch before saying he’s a ‘noted openly bisexual wizard’. He’s not special, we’re everywhere. I can’t tell if the tabloids are breathlessly horny or they despise him. ”
“You keep telling me you're not together, but that seems pretty together,” Hermione said. Harry had completely forgotten she was here.
“Do you want to have a quick drink?” Harry says, instead of the goodbye that had been on the tip of his tongue.
“Yes,” Harry said. He resumed kissing but angled his hips away, kept his mouth soft and undemanding. Surprise took him when Draco was the one to lick into his mouth until he gasped. So, this would be complicated too.
They were standing in front of the block of flats where Harry had left him every single time before.
Harry nodded again and raised his shirt. Draco pressed firmly on his abdomen and torso with the tips of his fingers. The warmth of his hands made him shiver but it was all very professional to his vague disappointment.
“Maybe if we had both survived the first War but...it was never like that. We were too young. She was like family,” Kingsley said.
Draco stood in the ballroom with his mother in deep black robes an hour later, receiving people he hadn’t seen in decades. People he’d rather not see at all. But they were all bound by the same customs. At least, no one would ask him questions or make remarks where he could hear it. They all offered their condolences, and their respect.
There was shifting in the benches, as if they thought he would have tried his father’s gambit and lied that he had been under an Imperius the entire time. Draco didn’t have the energy and didn’t see the point. No one was buying it, and if they were, all the assets he could use to find a better lawyer to suggest it were impounded somewhere in a special vault. This time, they knew better than to allow Malfoy money to influence things.
“I shouldn’t be telling you anything,” Hermione muttered, her voice flinty. “If I’d known you’d be so bloody obsessed with him—”
“It’s better for me when I make steady plans. What about Tuesdays? I can come for lunch or dinner depending on my schedule,” Harry offered. Andromeda brightened.
“I want to stay there,” Draco said. He was resolute. No sign of the Draco who had knelt in front of him and wept remained.
Of course floos worked both ways, but when did Harry ever come looking for him in the Manor? Lady of the fucking Lake, his face hurt. He would never be annoyed with anyone who came into A&E complaining about something being broken ever again. He could taste the coppery brightness of his own blood down the back of his throat.
"Will you be alright at home alone?" Harry says. His expression is so sweetly concerned. Draco can deal with that. He can't deal with Harry rubbing his thumb on Draco's wrist in a public hallway where anyone could see. He looks the way he did before Draco kissed him in the Ministry basement. Expectant and shockingly open.
There had been incredibly close calls and people had been hurt but no one had died yet. Why had no one died yet? Why did they keep finding all these Dark objects?
There had been a time Harry had been obsessed with nothing but other lives he could live. But to settle into this one, he had given up other possibilities.
“You’ve spent an awful lot of time imagining how I fuck, have you?” Harry asked. Harry had forgotten what a simple pleasure this could be, flirting badly with no consequences.
When they replaced his food with greying beef and some limp carrots about a month later, he knew he was right. It was illegal for that kind of magic to be in your system before the courts. Draco couldn’t possibly tell what difference it was supposed to make. The robes they gave him were serviceably warm but worn and off-black.
Harry gave him a long, considering look. He had tried at least to make this on Draco’s terms and not his. So Harry had seen him every weekend for three months and gave him a chaste kiss on his doorstep. He waited for Draco to tell Harry he could get close again or to even come into his building past the main door. He had given him time and space when both were making him feel ridiculous because he already knew.
"No." Harry let the swooping in his stomach settle watching Draco handle the poesy ring with such delicateness.
The next morning didn’t reassure him in the slightest. He drank half a coffee, stared into space, and realized he was running late. He had apparently forgotten his Floo fee because the network shut his Floo with an extremely pissy note that said his account was in arrears once again. He sprinted to the Apparition point and Hermione said nothing about him arriving twenty-two minutes late and out of breath.
Though his mother sold potion ingredients and small charms, it was a cottage industry meant more for pocket change than a steady salary. With his name, he’d be lucky to have any application to the Ministry make it past the bin. Draco could not afford to run a shop anywhere acceptable anymore.
"You don't look at me like you want to tenderly dry hump my leg," Hermione said primly. "Or Ron. Or Luna. Or Neville."
“The birthday boy is fine. Potter, catch up,” Blaise said. He lined up three shots of whiskey. There was that famous Gryffindor courage, because Harry winked at him and took all three in a row. Blaise clapped him on the back and leaned in to tell Harry something.
“Two,” Draco says. His eyes flutter shut, and the blotchy redness of his blush has spread everywhere. He looks gorgeous on his back like this, giving himself over to Harry’s care and attention. Harry obeys, easing two fingers in as Draco’s legs fall open wider.
Harry nodded. That made sense. According to the mantle it was three pm and the incident had happened at one. Two hours was a long time. Too short to get a trace, but he was worried about what would be done in that time.
“I think you’ll find that with one notable exception you get what you want from me,” Draco says dryly. Harry doesn’t know what to say. What Harry wanted was a mess of contradictions. He searches for steadier ground.
Draco turned to Florean. “Can I have one lemon ice, one chai ice cream, and four pints to go? One mint chocolate, one vanilla, one pistachio, one cinnamon toast. Those are your children’s regular orders, right?”
Draco still found him attractive. He should really get Melinda to explain this to him. Again. His hair, even now, was messy in a way that made him want to pull it, in a distinctly inappropriate fashion.
Oliver’s arm was slung around Percy. Percy flushed with happiness, and maybe the liquor too. Oliver kissed Percy on the tip of his nose, which made his face turn even redder, but he didn’t move away.
Had he ever heard Draco tell a story before? Was he always this unfocused or was this courtesy of this world?
"At worst, on paper, you’re currently guilty of not filing some reports and mild insubordination. No one knows,” Hermione said.
“We opened an investigation on Theodore because I found a clue when I was away,” Draco said. It startled Harry.
“Come here,” Harry muttered. Harry pulled Draco into his lap and looked up at him, waiting for permission. Harry wasn’t shy about kissing so it wasn’t kissing he wanted.
“You’ll make yourself ill when it wears off,” Draco snapped. Harry thought of casting anyway but decided he didn’t want to collapse of heat exhaustion. It felt unfair to do that to a borrowed body.
Draco’s skin was cool and dry in contrast with Harry’s warm and clammy hands. Draco stood at the top and swore a few times as he spotted the rune.
Having a boyfriend who worked jointly with St Mungo’s and the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes resulted in Harry seeing Draco far less often than he would have liked. And Draco was downright territorial over his sleep even when they were together.
“That’s what my colleague said,” Harry admitted reluctantly. “It’s not going to reactivate and behead someone is it?”
Harry didn’t say that it wouldn’t have mattered who taught him. He had taught Hermione after all. He wanted to keep that part to himself. A small sign some of this had been real elsewhere and meant something.
Draco moved from Harry’s side and started looking at some shelves behind the cash register. Harry followed, trying to be careful not to get water on the books. It was a tidy and small but packed bookshop. It looked so mundane that he almost wanted to check again that this was the Draco Malfoy he knew.
“Gobstones?” Pansy offered to Draco. She hadn’t bothered repeating all the sentimental nonsense Draco had heard all day and he loved her for it.
It was later that night Harry awoke to hear a strangled noise coming from Draco. His head tossed from side to side. Harry poked him to no effect, so he leaned over Draco and shook him gently. He felt feverish. Draco’s eyes were wild and unseeing when they opened.
This Draco was adept at reading Harry's expressions. He could detect his fading distress. He knew what he had needed. Harry wasn’t sure he liked that.
“I saw him last night,” Harry said. He was thinking about how Draco looked when he really threw his head back and laughed. He was thinking of the cool grey of his eyes when assessing something. He was thinking whether he’d ever see either again. Harry put his face in his hands.
Draco woke Harry  in the middle of the night with a shake on the shoulder. Harry started for his wand before flexing his hand and putting it back under the blanket. They both noticed.
Harry was a few inches taller than both of his parents, taller than he was at home. His father looked like him aside from the thinning grey hair, but some differences wouldn’t show up in a memory or photograph. Like the fact that the sheepish smile on his father’s face looked exactly like his own. He’d assumed his kids in the other universe had their freckles from Ginny, but it could have easily been from his mum.
“Wait! Don’t jump, it’s already unstable!” But Draco pulled the wing back and went blank behind the eyes.
He closes the window when enough air has rushed in to make it feel less stuffy. His trunk and closet should be empty, but he checks both, just in case he missed something.
“Where are you taking me?” Draco asks. No harm in trying. One of them punched him in a kidney for his trouble. Draco fell to his knees and almost toppled over without his hands to balance him.
His Floo activated and Ron came out first, followed by Hermione. Ron reached out to let her steady. Hermione looked a little off-colour. She was larger every time he saw her and he was surprised there was a whole month to go before she gave birth.
“Hi,” Draco said. The quality of his voice was slower, less polished. Harry thought he might’ve been able to tell that this was not his Draco. His Draco? What a phrase.
"Sounds like he will, George. Something refined for our pedestrian tastes," Fred said, mirroring George.
“Ah, I thought we would eventually get to this portion of the evening, but you never did dance around something, did you?” Draco’s naked fondness is too much for a public place. Harry thinks it feels like something you’d see in a place of worship or hear when someone was promising you something life-changing.
“And would that be a problem if she was?” Draco asked. He was very afraid of her answer. They were purebloods, after all and prevailing attitudes were somewhere between "keep it to yourself" and "as long as I don't have to see it and you produce heirs."
“I’ll show you something wonderful. Everyone will be jealous that I sold a house to Harry Potter. I’ll keep my job. Everyone wins!” Pansy says when they approach her about it at a Sunday lunch.
“Okay. Rotate in one direction, then back.” Hermione demonstrated without touching the Firebird. Her fingers ghosted over the device lightly.
“You have to teach me these things, Theo. Draco and I are disgraced aristocrats and now you’re a man of the people,” Pansy said. Theo snorted.
"Let's dance," Draco said. Harry should have protested. He had spent the entire Yule Ball standing on the wall in dress robes his mum bought him, laughing with Ron about how they had ended up with no dates. He had last danced at Sirius and Remus' wedding with one of his distant relatives when he was thirteen.
The idea of trying to remove people’s gallbladders every single day made him vaguely ill. The first time he helped with an appendectomy a month ago Draco waited until after his shift, vomited in the staff toilets, and seriously considered becoming a vegetarian.
“At least then I was useful. I know how to do the work. I did the training. One more year and I would have at least been able to pick some of my assignments. Now I’ll have no standing for another year if I return,” Harry said, frustrated.
“Because the amount of magic you imbue an object is limited by the magical properties of its materials. You can make an ordinary thing dangerous but not powerful. Even a wandtree doesn’t have this much magic.”
The card was still sitting on Harry’s kitchen table at Grimmauld and it had been at least a month. If Kreacher had been alive, it would have been filed away at least. Instead it gathered dust.
“Not unless you want Zabini to come out of the kitchen to kill us both,” Draco said like he had no opinion either way. “We do tip extravagantly though.”
“I guess Bill was right about both of us going,” Draco said. Before Harry could decipher that remark Draco disappeared into his tent. Harry entered his own tent, which was cool, cooler than he might have expected.
"Do you know how I met Patience, Harry?" Kingsley said, as Harry reached the door of the master bedroom.
Once a week Gabriel would come over and inspect his flat for contraband. Gabe did him the courtesy of at least pretending he was checking how things were coming along although he did genuinely seem delighted to find out Draco had learned how to use the phone.
“They’ve let me know that may not be possible with my record,” Draco said flatly after a long moment.
Harry kissed him again, but this time more hungrily. He had a hazy plan forming. First, he was going to taste Draco’s mouth until he’d memorized it. Then he would kiss every part of his body he could reach. They would do nothing else until Draco was panting. The emotional part of this was hard to untangle, but lust Harry could solve.
He should be worried or scared, but the last two years had burned both emotions out of his blood entirely. All Draco felt was vaguely sick to his stomach and numb. He didn’t look up as they walked him into court but stared at the stone floor.
and nearly blinded himself. Draco had not yet got used to the wand before the Ministry took it and his control was completely off. Fuck.
He would pick up a glass of water and think about whether he had split the universe with such a tiny choice.
Theo looked happy enough at this celebration dinner for the engagement though. It was only the four of them. Harry cleared his throat.
Draco turned into a whirlwind any time he left the house. He was absent-minded at the best of times and under pressure when he was called in for an emergency, he flapped around the house convinced he had forgotten something.
dangerous. But I’ll be back soon. It’s not a search and rescue, we know exactly where he is.” The Ministry bell clanged once again. “Yes, yes, I’m coming!”
“No,” Harry said honestly. He was not especially given to wonder. He was a twenty-eight year old Hogwarts professor. The time for adventure had passed him by, and that was a wonderful thing a decade down the line from everything he’d gone through.
“Your valet won’t thank you for that,” Draco said. Draco reached out and straightened his cravat. A tingle passed through him.
This was not the first time he had lain on the floor of the solar. During Christmas break of the War, he had confessed to his father that he wanted to run away. His father had struck him, once and hard. While plenty of pureblood families believed in corporal punishment, his parents had never raised a hand to him. He was doted on as a child.  Draco had sobbed on the floor of the solar and his father had cried too. The worst parts of the War were moments like that, when nothing could be relied on except misery.
“He couldn’t admit he was wrong,” Draco said. “He never once said he was sorry for what I went through.”
“Are they ever going to leave Longbottom alone?” Draco held up the Prophet. MORE LIKE THE MAN WHO LIVED: LONGBOTTOM TOPLESS IN CORFU see page 3 for more details. Harry snorted. His Neville would hate that.
“We’re talking about parallel universes. Don’t you want to know if you could travel to one?” Hermione asked. Her eyes shone brightly. Even in the swirling black robes of an Unspeakable, she looked great, brown skin shimmering in the dank atmosphere of the Ministry. She seemed at home here, surrounded by books and experiments.
Harry’s voice was a little more unsteady, a little more shrill than he’d like. His heart started hammering so hard, he could practically hear it in the hushed silence of the room. He could feel it. Both of them said nothing.
He had run a few scans with his wands, poked at it with his magic, checked its properties and removed some of the protective spells. The whole thing made him queasy until he was certain it was a dud. The necklace was a hideous, heavy thing made of goblin wrought silver, crystal and genuine giant sapphires the size of a knut. There were similar pieces of jewelry the Malfoys had in their vault but nothing that was so tasteless. Without a doubt, it had been chosen to look expensive rather than nice.
Draco went into his prepared spiel about preventable deaths and overall healthcare savings, but he kept on eye on Harry who made sure to politely nod while Draco spoke.
“So can I go home while this is going on?” He knew the answer before he asked. A minimally warded Muggle summer cottage in the Outer Hebrides was probably a no-go.
Hermione agreed. Harry could manage a pain-free test that required him to get a finger prick and wait five minutes. Hermione fussed with a smoking cauldron and dropped his blood in there. The memory of the last time someone did that was uncomfortable for a moment, bright in his mind. Harry rolled the beads on his wrist to remind himself he was here and not there.
Harry finally looked at Draco. At his almost imperceptible trembling. He was scared. Harry shifted so he stood slightly in front of him. Her wand was drawn and by her side. Harry’s wand was in the holster in his waistband, but if he had to reach for it, Harry was still quicker on the draw.
“Do you mean to tell me that despite having universes worth of evidence that I’m never brave, you’ve been waiting for me to make the first move?”
“Take responsibility. But remember that you went through things yourself and you also have to deal with that,” she would tell him. “You know, you can take a potion for the sleep issues. They are not habit forming, and I think it would help you function better. If you ever want to try.”
“Not everyone is you, Harry,” Draco said. Curious that he switched to his first name. That felt intimate but correct.
Draco looked much cleaner than he did. The Death Eater insignia pinned on his black cloak was brightly polished. His hair was pulled back tightly, his eyes were a flat slate grey, his boots were shiny. He looked like a soldier. So this time who would be the General and who was the spy?
“But it didn’t sound like nonsense. I mean, he’s changed but Greg was never...Greg was a pretty literal thinker when I knew him. He doesn’t have flights of fancy. If he says it, he believes it. And he didn’t strike me as delusional.”
His mother looked like the old her, and Draco found it unsettling. Her white hair was set in cascading curls, her lipstick was fire engine red and she had used all the glamours she’d once favoured. She had no laugh lines or freckles. Her long nails matched her lipstick, far from the short plain and neat style she favoured these days because she spent most of her time gardening.
They arrive at a tidy brown brick triplex with loud instrumental music. Everyone is sprawled on the rooftop terrace, and Michael and Harry join them. In the corner stands an oscillating fan that isn’t doing much to circulate air. Too many people are here already but more keep arriving with bottles of wine and excuses.
"Did you accidentally vanish my work robes? I pay for those," Draco complained. Harry was pleased that he sounded short of breath too.
Harry rolls his eyes. They do too much fieldwork for Senior Aurors and they both know it, but he didn't particularly want to solve that by spending a week in the dusty depths of the Ministry's sub-basement. Their assigned section is through three vault doors.The lanterns light one small portion of this cavernous mass of shelving at a time. The sound is muffled and time seems slower down there.
As far as Harry was concerned, the Ministry could go to blazes. Harry didn’t give a damn about their property and he’d just as soon destroy the Firebirds the same as give them back. He could admit he’d gone looking for Draco.
"Sip your water, Potter.” Draco hadn’t even turned around. “If you sick up on the floor and set off a trap, I’ll kill you.”
“They go to an in-between place. We can’t study it because no one remembers being there. Like a dream,” Hermione said. Harry frowned slightly.
“Can you believe that Frances told me the other day, that he considered himself very progressive for allowing this?” Pansy said. Pansy rolled her eyes.
Harry woke up some hours later, clean, tucked in his bedsheets and alone. It really wasn’t until a month later that he identified the inexplicable grief he had been carrying around. Somewhere along the line Harry had fallen in love with him and hadn’t noticed. But if Draco hadn't written then maybe it had been one-sided. Harry made promises to himself about never looking back once he lived through the heartbreak. So he lived through it, and until now, he had kept that promise.
“You know the standard Time Turner rules, and I already told you not to get killed,” Hermione said. Sometimes Harry hated the wry sense of humour she’d developed coping with her job. He raised an eyebrow. She grabbed her Firebird back.
“Um, it was chocolate. Pink icing. Green writing. Hagrid made it for me when he came to give me my Hogwarts letter.”
“Just imagine you lived all these lives with someone. You saw so many possibilities of how you could be together and they were looking for you, and you were looking for them. And they rejected all of that.”
They wake up in the middle of the night and fuck again, so quiet most of what Harry hears is their bodies and the sheets sliding against themselves.
“Fred, it sounds like Draco has volunteered to bring the liquor next week,” George said, clapping Draco on the shoulder.
Harry had never thought to wonder how he met his wife. Harry vaguely recalled she had gone to uni in Spain before coming to England for her Potions Mastery.
It was already eight am. Harry swung his feet down to the floor, went to his case journal and wrote. He took most of the morning to write his memories in case the common thread became more obvious later on.
The Draco he'd seen around the Ministry was quiet and kept to himself. He ate in the Ministry canteen. No one ate in the canteen. Harry hardly saw him in Wizarding London except for work and formal events. He gave off the same unsettling aura as the other Unspeakables, but even Harry didn’t think he’d been biding his time to do something nefarious. He was probably still a right bastard, but Harry had looked evil in the face plenty enough to know the difference.
Harry handed over the three Firebirds, chains tangled together. Draco’s malfunctioning one was dented, light flickering at its core erratically. It made Harry nervous to look at. Draco could have so easily been trapped in one of the worse universes with no way to get home.
“He could destabilize the magic in several worlds until there’s no magic and we all die a painful death as the structure of reality collapses,” Kingsley said, deadpan.
“It’s only me. Come in,” Harry said. He opened the door wider to let Draco step in. He looked around the house cautiously. The burnt carbon scent of apparition clung to Draco. His shoes were unlaced when he toed them off in the entryway.
They tried to give him a little time with the public defender and his mother. He waved both off and sat alone with a Magical Law Enforcement officer in a side room in the dungeons of the Ministry. She was a short but sturdy woman, who seemed to be constantly muttering under her breath but thankfully, didn’t seem to want to talk to him any more than he wanted to talk to her.
Harry was the one who set aside their careful distance and reached for Draco for the first kiss and the second and all the rest, until the sun had risen, and Draco was underneath him, looking as lovely as it had felt to whirl under the stars.
Harry hadn't exactly had time to go for a haircut, and he let Draco wrap a curl around his index finger while they sat on the couch.
Draco searched his robes for a sheaf of papers. Something that should have been long dead under the circumstances enjoyed just watching Draco reach into a hidden pocket.
Today was marked, but it still surprised him when he showed up to the restaurant in Diagon Alley and Draco stood there in front of the restaurant. His Firebird was cool with a faint pinkish glow; Draco had been here recently, but he wasn’t here now. It was still worth it to find out more though.
If Harry squinted, he could see the movement of light that meant Zacharias was almost at the shipping container.
“Have you ever known me to bake?” Pansy answered archly. Theo and Draco looked at each other knowingly and drank from their flutes rather than challenge that suspiciously non-specific denial.
Harry looked in the fridge. Lettuce, eggs, olives, tomatoes, green beans...he should definitely roast that aubergine tomorrow, and do something with the parsley. He looked in the pantry and he did have tinned tuna.
Draco apparated into the building with that awful Death Eater billow of black smoke, wand pointed. Harry couldn’t even defend himself if he wanted.
Harry didn’t bother denying the charge. He had given up on pretending he wasn’t fixated on Draco Malfoy and should have long ago. It was freeing. Harry Potter, the Boy Who Knew Draco Malfoy Was Up To Something.
“Luna would like me if I were a shrub,” Draco said. Harry shrugged. He wasn’t wrong. They apparated the edge of the property Ron and Hermione had bought. They were hosting a small housewarming party there, even though they wouldn’t be moving in for another month.
It felt like if Draco turned around at exactly the right moment, he could spot himself and Pansy wearing the minimum amount of uniform they could get away with and complaining about homework. Draco shook his head.
To make it worse, Head Auror Kingsley Shacklebolt had summoned Harry to his office the following Monday. Harry was presented with a letter that approved his non-existent request for paid administrative leave.
Harry almost couldn’t meet her eyes. She hadn’t talked about it like most of her work, but she had taken Theodore Nott’s loss hard a few months back. The rumour had been that he had vanished into thin air, but no one outside of Mysteries knew for certain.
“Let me stay here. I’ll do anything,” Draco said. The pain woven into Draco’s voice was almost unbearable. Harry used his thumb to brush away some of the tears, but they kept coming. “I’m not alone here. I don’t want to leave.”
“I wasn’t as moral as you,” Draco said finally. He added his Firebird to the pile. It took Harry off-guard. He expected negotiations, pleas, and perhaps a hex.
“Why the fuck does it hurt when we aren’t touching?” Harry says groggily. Draco might have said that more politely. He likes Tadenik most of the time.
“He will be, okay? We’re running tests about what kind of magical damage Draco might have done and on what happened to his magic. Any other details, he will tell you himself if he wants to.”
It was late October before he got a note back with a time and place at dinner. The note wasn’t even signed. Harry thought about binning it and refusing to go. He thought about conjuring the ghost of all the anger and hurt and letting it harden him.
“If it’s not prescribed by a Healer, don’t take it. It’ll ruin your life. Trust me, I would know,” Draco said. Harry didn’t know whether he meant from work or personal experience.
“Believe me, enjoying nightclubs is the least of our potential problems,” Hermione said. “You should see what I’ve seen myself get up to.”
“James, I told you to untack the bleeding carpet from the stairs! Harry’s nearly fallen,” she called, using a wandless Sonorus charm.
fail your psychological profile in your yearly review as it stands. I believe in your ability to do this job, but you will not endanger yourself under my watch. You are not well. We can agree or we can disagree, but you will walk out of here without your badge today either way,” Kingsley said.
“What are you working on?” He’d asked one little girl. He tried to be kind when he could. She looked around five or six. Harry always went alone when there had been multiple visits; after the initial shock of an incident wore off more than one Auror in the home made people nervous.
They left the island in a rowboat. Draco glimpsed himself in the water. He looked haunted to his own eyes. There were dark under-eye circles and chapped lips. He looked more like Lucius than he ever had before, which he did not expect at all.
“Her aunt Dorcas was my first partner,” Kingsley explained. “She was my best friend. When she died, I went to pieces.”
“I’m not a baby,” Teddy said. He very much looked like one to Harry, but he refrained from saying so. He was tall for his age and tried to eat Andromeda out of house and home, but Harry could lift him one-handed which was probably his best measure for a child being big.
“His father told him to cast me aside and find another pureblood woman who could bear him children. At the time, Lucius would have had the right to break our marriage contract. Abraxas even told him to take a mistress if he insisted on keeping me in the house. That would have been acceptable too,” she said.
Her eyes flashed. Hermione did not like that tone of voice at all. Harry was out of practice anyway, as most of his interrogations these days involved fifth years misusing empty classrooms and silly pranks.
“I hope you know that you’re still a part of this family and you will always be welcome here,” Arthur said.
“Death Eater scum,” Trainee Forrester said as she passed. It wasn’t particularly inventive but he couldn’t say he didn’t deserve it.
He spent the rest of the weekend alternately drinking some gin he had found in Sirius’ wardrobe and playing terrible pop music on the wireless that kind of reminded him of being in pubs right after the War.
The last thing he remembers really well is the pattern of grey tile in Draco's sitting room. He has never been here before and he’s surprised it looks so minimalist. The palette is muted, Draco has just one stiff backed couch for two, and everything is neat but dusty. Draco manoeuvres him against a wall. Harry wants to ask if they can at least do this in a bedroom.
“No, if you stun a troll it bounces off their hide,” Draco said. “On that thought, I’ve never seen any protective spells that absorb spells. They mostly reflect them. There’s too many spells to cover otherwise.”
“Fuck,” Harry says. Draco scrabbles blindly, and as soon as his hand touches Harry’s arm, the pain subsides immediately.
They landed in the middle of a nightclub with throbbing bass and strobe lights. Harry looked down at himself. He was on the slender side here, wearing what appeared to be a leather vest, small tight black shorts....or underpants, with sandals and glitter everywhere. He was dancing hip to hip with a strange brunette man who licked a stripe up Harry’s neck.
“There’s nothing to be nervous about,” Harry reassured Draco. Harry could see him fussing and retying his bowtie for the third time.
The answer came as Draco swept Harry into his arms, tucking Harry’s head underneath his chin. Harry wouldn’t have expected this. And if he did, he definitely wouldn’t have expected how tenderly he was being held, as if he was a precious, breakable thing. His hands tangled in Harry’s hair.
Hermione and Draco spoke privately in the front room for a long hour. When Hermione left, Draco seemed to have realized something. His face was stony, remote.
Harry finally slept well. No more half-jumbled, too-vivid dreams. When he awoke, Draco was gone. Harry’s heart raced until he heard the clanging of pots and pans downstairs.
“I’m out. Do you know any potions that aren’t controlled substances?” Draco’s lips were twitching minutely like he was trying not to smile.
, all grace and easy athleticism, but he had kept to himself as an adult. They were both alone a lot. Maybe Draco had always been alone, and he was new to all of this.
“You’ve done the right thing and still they treat you poorly. It’s not fair,” Harry said, indignant. He almost forgot he was playing a part.
It took Harry less than a day to shut up the cottage properly. He wasn’t there most of the year, anyway. It was a matter of gathering a few clothes, shutting the Floo, changing the wards again, and taking everything Wizarding out. The cottage was remote, and from the outside looked like nothing more than a stonewashed hut, but he never knew if someone might stumble upon it by accident.
“You and your obsession with fairness. Because of my father, I’ll forever be a traitor’s son, no matter how many medals they send. It’s only because King William deigned to give me the title instead of stripping it from my father that I’m even allowed in polite company,” Draco said carefully. “I try to remember how many of them lost family in the War.”
The loudest noise Harry had ever heard boomed from the shipping container and the yellow metal went to pieces like a child blowing confetti. Harry had cast a shield charm out of pure instinct and dropped into the water grabbing at Penny and Athena roughly. He could feel the crackle of his earpiece but he couldn’t hear a damned thing. He could see nothing but bright spots in his vision. Shrapnel rained overhead but Harry kept his face in the water for several long minutes. Penny rolled away and leapt up.
"I'll make this good for you," Harry says. His voice is low, and sweet. When he gazes at Draco through his lashes it makes it seem like Harry wants this and that's wishful thinking on Draco's part. So Draco closes his eyes, gives himself over to Harry's mouth and comes an embarrassingly short time later.
"Not like that, like this," Draco said. And suddenly there was no space between them at all, and Draco wound his arms around Harry's neck. His face was buried in Harry's shoulder. Their dancing reminded Harry of sex in the point and counterpoint of it, although what they were doing was relatively sedate swaying. Even in this sensory mess of other people's cologne, body heat and third hand cigarette smoke, Harry could still pick out the sharp clean scent of him. He recognized it anywhere, it permeated their flat.
It was only a split second where Harry saw the outline of Zacharias with his wand raised as he rested one hand on the corner of the shipping container. Why could Harry see Zacharias at all? Shouldn’t there be—
The fruit trees he wanted to plant would wait another year. All the gardening he needed to do he asked Neville to check in on.
Despite the entrance requirements, it really didn’t take the most brilliant person to be a Healer. It didn’t require great study habits, although it helped. What it took was a solid disposition and more dedication than Draco thought. To be a Healer, one committed wholeheartedly and exclusively.
A chorus of titters went up around him in the break room. Well, he wasn’t very popular, he reminded himself. He was self-conscious as he went up to look at the chart. He studied it for a few seconds.
This wasn’t Harry’s best idea. It might, in fact, be one of the worst ideas he had concerning Draco Malfoy. But the shop bell tinkled, and Harry pushed open the door before he could change his mind.
The minute he catches sight of him, Harry knows it wouldn’t have mattered how long it was. It was always going to feel just like this, overwhelming and breathless and too much. Harry has almost forgotten the shape of his name, it takes so long to come up. There is a Draco in his head who is still eighteen and here is this man, who is clearly not the same person. Draco is just as stunned to see him.
“You said you might like something traditional?” Pansy asks. She sounds tentative, so Harry swallows his remark about living in the house from Babbitty Rabbitty as they survey the inside. He lets her continue before them in her tight grey skirt suit and wobbling in her court shoes. He looks over to make meaningful eye contact with Draco, but Draco is entranced by the house.
In the end he had taken NEWTs for Transfiguration, Potions, Herbology, Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Arithmancy and Ancient Runes. After a week straight of exams he slept for fourteen hours.
“You two make enough money to stop drinking this fucking swill,” Draco said to the twins. Draco shook his head, making a face.
But people still treated him so carefully, even people who had known him before he became the “Saviour” twice over.
“She’s not very happy about the werewolf rights legislation. She was sending threats to the Minister a couple years ago. We had to threaten to charge her before she stopped. She’s been running with an interesting crowd since,” Zacharias said.
“She slept with Parvati,” Draco murmurs in explanation for why she suddenly had to do her job at Padma’s brokerage. Harry gives a low whistle.
“Okay, I promise,” Draco laughed because Pansy had always had a dramatic streak. “What’s this about?”
Harry went to do the same and his hand brushed against a familiar chain against the back of Draco’s neck. He paused. Draco had half unbuttoned Harry’s shirt, and he was looking at Harry’s chest.
He called because he’d looked at Draco Malfoy in a Muggle bookshop and realized for the first time that there were questions about himself that he could not answer. What were the odds of their meeting? What did it mean? Why did it feel like Harry had stayed the same and Draco changed? Why did everyone seem to change but Harry?
“After everything you went through, I should have insisted on addressing your mental health before you finished training. I made an exception for you, assuming that because you were fine right after that you would always be fine. That was poor judgement on my part.”
Harry, despite himself, sat up by the fireplace and waited. Harry would have sworn he stayed awake but he drifted between sleep and wakefulness until he startled. He was being levitated back to the bedroom, against Draco’s chest. When Draco noticed Harry had awoken, he smiled and pressed a soft kiss to his forehead.
“I heard your mum thunder in and I was eating pretzels with no shirt on. Fucking booked it to the other room.” Draco complained.
“You can have a little to drink, babes. Maddy will be just fine with mum,” a pink-haired Tonks told Remus. They both looked older, but they were here too.
Maybe it should have given him more pause, caused him more grief. Harry wanted to know more. But if what Harry had done counted, then that Harry was part of their history of interactions too. He had searched for Draco because he had wanted him.
“What do you want then?” Draco began thinking of what hadn’t been sold, decommissioned or Vanished. “There are a few artefacts in the family library that are worth something. I have jewellery.”
“You won’t be debauching me on a sawdust covered floor in any case,” Draco said smoothly, rolling to stand. Harry always gave him room as if he knew he didn’t like feeling trapped. Harry stood up himself and offered a hand up.
If his mother noticed a man had asked him out, she said nothing. Nor did she say anything about Draco’s haircut when her eyes had flicked upwards, although Draco had clearly gone to a Muggle barber and said 'give me the gayest haircut you have' and the barber obliged.
"I don't know what I saw," Draco lies neatly. In any case that was a fantasy. Draco knows he doesn't look like that in real life. "That's not why."
“Trainee Forrester. Let’s say we are out of blood replenishing potions. Name me three treatments that we can use for the patient with this chart.” Healer Cummins gave a chart to a mousy brunette Draco vaguely recognized from first year Anatomy.
The ground was pockmarked and hilly and awful. Harry was suddenly grateful for all those runs, because they had taught him to stay steady. He ducked and held up the Portkey and felt someone grab onto his trouser leg. He tried to kick them off but they held on steady when they arrived at gates at Malfoy Manor. The sudden weight made them all fall, and Harry saved his cushioning charm for Draco while he crashed to the driveway so hard his teeth rattled.
“How did you do it? I didn’t even think it was you,” Harry said when Draco reluctantly brought out his. It flickered oddly, casting eerie shadows around their bedroom. His Firebird looked rougher, with a tiny dial like a fine tuner on a violin. For the most part he was surprised, but a tiny hurt bloomed too.
“You should meet my other friend actually, I think he just got here. He’s also from London.” She wanders back inside and brings someone back around.
He walks up behind Harry and lets himself lean just a little, the side of his face resting on Harry’s shoulder blade.
“It is utterly devoid of colour," Draco says. He hops up to sit on the marble counter in the kitchen—“one slab of veined marble imported from Italy by the previous owner as a gift to his ex-wife.” Harry goes to him, puts one gentle hand on the sliver of ankle exposed by his trousers. Sometimes it feels ridiculous that after everything, there's them. Draco's been working a lot, and maybe just one stolen kiss is okay. Once he realizes Pansy won’t be back anytime soon, he follows up with a second kiss.
Harry climbed the stairs to the bedroom and thought he might have to go wandering in Diagon before he spotted a bound notebook. He flipped it open. It was a copy of the calendar but on Harry’s weeks there were at least two times marked ‘Draco Malfoy Greengrass - Nero, Diagon’. He flipped back. Same place for two years.
The floor had opened in the middle and tilted like Tower Bridge. Harry edged towards the middle where he could see nothing but a dark hole of indeterminate depth. Harry kicked a pebble over the edge. It was longer than he liked before he heard it hit the ground. Then he spotted something out of the corner of his eye.
“Just call me Gabe.” Gabriel put a hand on his shoulder as a friendly gesture. A shiver passed through Draco, but if Gabriel noticed he didn't react. “Ravenclaw, but I think I’m four or five years older than you. Shall we?”
He repeated it with the parlour. He had to float out some furniture from the dining room first but he did that room too. By the time he was done, ten rooms had disappeared.
“I forgot my mug in the break room,” Draco said. Greg entered his house anyway and looked around. Fuck, he knew he should have got around to rekeying the wards.
Harry immediately sat and read through. Some sections were blacked out, but it gave him a vague sense of things he had been uncertain about. An unsmiling Draco blinked up at him.
“Yes. For one, I came back regularly. Two, because you know I avoided intimacy with them, even if it would have made sense.” Here Harry leaned in and kissed Draco’s throat. Draco let out a little huffy breath.
“I prefer to think of it as a celebration of life.” There’s a touch of sarcasm, but it goes down easy. Not bitter like before.
“Can you keep talking?” Harry said. His heart was still racing a little and he couldn’t name why. It was disconcerting to have the physical symptoms of an anxiety attack without the thoughts that usually underpinned them.
Bad enough that he sometimes thinks of the way Draco’s pinky had curled around his. Worse still, that there is a very stupid part of him that enjoys the weight of Draco’s hand in his once more, even if it’s forced.
It was quiet when Harry slipped on a mossy rock and found himself laughing at the shock of cold water up the back of his thighs.
Not having access to any magic or unfiltered news had bothered him the most, actually. Muggles seemed, on the whole, alright. They were no more inclined to evil or ignorance or weakness than any wizard. It didn’t seem like the sort of conversation he could have with Greg. Greg smirked again, and Draco realized he really did not like that expression.
“If McGonagall would write you a letter then you’d be an excellent Healer,” Harry said. Draco rolled his eyes. What a softhearted bastard. For all he knew, Draco would fail. But he wasn't in a position to refuse even a misplaced offer of assistance
Face messy with saliva and jaw sore, Harry had sat Draco on the stairs, summoned lube, and fucked himself on his fingers while Draco watched. Harry stopped every time Draco reached forward, until he understood. Harry had waited for a bed for the rest though. Put Draco on his back and waited until Draco had been about to say something before he sank onto him.
His working theory, considering the last universe, was that Draco didn’t want to stay out there or he would have stopped jumping at the first halfway decent universe and tossed his Firebird off a cliff or under a bus. Harry would have never found him.
“Yes.” Harry didn’t know how else to answer. He was dripping on the grey-green carpet of a bookshop.
“Clearly they are experimenting with Dark objects and it’s something to do with muggleborns. Clearly they are escalating if they’ve attacked you outright. But to what end no one can figure out,” Athena said.
He returned to Hogwarts and threw himself into work. He sponsored the Duelling Club, started tryouts early, and tried to fly more often. He cut his hair short. He slept badly. He would fall asleep in the middle of his bed and wake up curled on his side. He had slept alone most of his adult life, and a few weeks had him grasping at empty sheets in the middle of the night.
“Wonderful. Please go home. I am formally suspending you for the week. You will make it up in overtime. If you gossip about it, I’ll remove you from the program for undermining my practicum,” Healer Cummins said. Trainee Forrester left in tears.
“I love you, Mum,” Harry said. This was the only time he would ever get to say it. “Tell Dad I love him too.”
This time the jolt was immediate because he saw Draco right away. Face to face. They were in an old-fashioned setting in a ballroom. Harry could see dozens of tails, cravats and gem coloured ball gowns. And Harry was glad his muscle memory was apparently engaged because Draco was leading them in some dance?
“Maddy is nothing like Teddy. Went straight from sitting to walking as if she thought all that crawling business was undignified,” Tonks said.
Harry nodded vigorously. He would comply with any conditions if it meant they wouldn’t leave him behind.
“I’m going to drive home. I can drop you at your hotel, Harry.” Harry didn’t even notice Draco had come up beside him. Draco says his goodbyes and jogs for a tiny burgundy Honda Civic. Harry follows. Rain slicks Draco’s hair back and his shirt is almost translucent in the time it takes him to unlock the door. Harry is soaked through. He flicks the rain off both of them with a neat spell and buckles his seat belt.
“Ma’am!” Draco calls. The woman—definitely a suspect now as she cradles three vials to her chest—startles and Apparates with a loud crack and before Draco can signal Harry to do the same, they both go crashing through the floor.
“The bombings last month were fueled by Dark objects. Someone has found a way to convert their magical energy from its intended purpose to pure destruction.”
Draco was studying for one of his mid-term exams for this year in the solar, when the owl came from the Ministry directly to his mother. She was taking afternoon tea with him before going back out to the garden. As the brown Ministry owl swooped in through the open window, Draco had thought for a second Harry might have written him from work instead of using his owl Gideon. But then his mother read the letter first and sat right back down in her chair. Draco grabbed it from her hands and began scanning:
Even in the Muggle world there were supposed to be social programmes to prevent that sort of treatment. To do that deliberately to a child at all was a cruelty even he couldn’t imagine. To do it so often that years later Harry forgot to eat, well, anything Draco was thinking was a firm violation of his Healer’s Oath.
Draco is hard against Harry's hip but makes no move other than to shift closer. He even smells different now, like something wholesome and sweet, like oats. But there’s an undercurrent of coppery sweat.
Draco led him into the garden and took the washcloth from Fleur and pressed against the back of Harry’s neck. The cloth was just this side of freezing. He felt himself calm a little. He touched a hand to his forehead. It was a close universe, but the edge of his scar meant this wasn’t one of those strange ones where there had been no Voldemort.
“Would you like to hold her instead?” Draco asked Molly. Harry knew it would be a hard sell for Molly to like him even if she tolerated him for Harry’s sake.
If Harry was going to tire of this sordid affair eventually, he wanted everything he could get in the meantime. He had never been a fixation before and he wasn’t sure he liked it, but he would take Harry however he could have him.
“Absolutely not. Haven’t been back,” Draco says. Harry knew that already. “I read the Prophet sometimes, but I’m not really keeping up much.”
If Harry didn’t know him better, Draco looked to be perfectly at ease, composed and professional. A more casual acquaintance would have missed Draco's bloodless fist clenched hard on the front display case, and his gaze was distinctly frosty.
“They never told me anything. Harry Potter. Dunno the rest. ” He slurred. They must have given him three times the dose needed.
"Harry," Draco says, sounding a little helpless. His name in Draco's mouth feels so right. Harry is fucked and he knows it but Draco is asking for more so Harry slings Draco's leg higher and presses deeper until Draco chants his name over and over. Draco reaches for his neglected cock, heavy and hard against his stomach. Harry pushes his hands away and wraps his hand around Draco's cock.
“Similar mechanics though,” Harry said. His workshop reminded him of Molly’s kitchen during a holiday meal, the more he looked. But presumably, it was always like this.
“Do you know how to build a mental wall?” Draco tries to help Harry by talking him through basic Occlumency exercises but he can feel when Harry’s attention wavers. Harry is taking shallow breaths, too shallow for Draco’s liking.
