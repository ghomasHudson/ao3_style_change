“My love, there was no protection in her blood, because she had no magic. Your parents’ sacrifice protected you from being killed that night, because their love and magic protected you in that specific moment. There was so much untethered, powerful magic in the air, with the intent of protecting you, that you survived.”
May I say it’s a pleasure? Before you discard this letter, it’s about Draco.
"Wait right here, and don't touch anything," she said, and the display case quickly shut on its own. She breezed behind the counter and went down to the far end, unlocking the case and lifting a necklace from it. Draco leaned over to try to get a good look at it, but she was quickly turning around and striding back towards him. “This should do.”
“I’m sorry. I won’t take out my wand again.” The dragon continued to stare at Harry, its piercing gaze rooting Harry to the spot.
“I won’t hear of it,” she told him, fixing him with a stern look. Okay. Right then. Long hair it was. She was so firm on it, he was a bit surprised.
"U-um, I'd really like to find him and make sure he's safe, Mrs. Malfoy--"
“I think Ron was disappointed that we weren’t going to be Aurors together like he wanted us to be, but I think I’m glad. I like taking care of animals like you, you know. You’re a lot less complicated than people.” Alright, he had the collar, now he just had to put it on.
Gods above, now I'm doing all the teasing work for you, you infuriatingly sexy git!
“Harry, dear. Right on time.” Narcissa was there to receive him, smiling at him, though he saw the brittle heartbreak beneath it. “I suspect, since Draco isn’t at your side, that you didn’t have much luck in finding him?”
Harry moved to take a step back from the dragon. Now that he had managed to apply the healing salve, there was no need for him to be quite so close,and most injured animals preferred to be left alone.
So please think it over and vote in the comments below!
“Wynter, what are you doing here?” Taking the letter from her leg, he stared for a moment. His mother. He had been expecting a letter from her, now.
A blond man with his father's jaw sat beside Sapphire, and Draco guessed this must be Gwendolyn's last son. "My older brother Alistair, and his wife Storm over there with all the plates."
Softness is weakness, plain and simple. Though you should have her tell the story of my first bit of accidental magic. I feel as though you would find it incredibly humorous.
"That, ah… That'd be two now, ma'am." The sigh she let out was long and silently spoke of suffering from idiots like him for far too long. She summoned a freshly picked leaf from the potions stores and handed it over.
He laughed and shook his head, looping his arm with hers. "You haven't aged since our third year. Besides, Draco would kill me if we had such a spectacular party without him." Besides, Harry desperately needed to see Draco in Baroque era dress, and definitely wouldn't know where to start with planning a party of that size. Narcissa laughed again, and the two entered the room into her bedroom- Oh, she seemed to have a fairly good handle on the pixies, seeing as quite a few were already immobilized.
Softness is weakness, plain and simple. Though you should have her tell the story of my first bit of accidental magic. I feel as though you would find it incredibly humorous.
“Oh, Sleekeasy’s, dear. Easily the best hair-taming potion on the market, though seeing your hair, I understand why.”
Draco found himself laughing with him. “I think that sounds lovely.” They continued their meal in silence for a bit, enjoying the early spring sunlight and watching the people go by. Draco was on his second glass of chilled Pinot gris when Sapphire cleared her throat and caught his attention.
Draco
Not giving up on you yet, Malfoy, don't forget that.
The healer nodded, looking down at her clipboard. “She was contacted just before we checked on him this morning, though she was informed our visiting ours aren’t for another few hours. We haven’t told her yet of his absence.”
“Perhaps she ought to sample other bottles, if you get my meaning. Plenty of lovely men and women in Paris, you know.”
However… I might also be taking this fic, once its completed, and reworking it to fit options 1 and 2. (Keep in mind, the plot and ending would not change… it would mostly be specific scenes and various details, and obviously would involve less magic.)
Sirius had run away to. In his mind, it was less a physical place and more the idea of warmth, love, and safety. "...I don't know. I'm sure they had one… maybe there's still a house, but I don't know where it is."
“Thank you. I’d prefer to take my meals in my room for the day.”
Draco
“Likewise,” he told her, his gaze slowly travelling back to the breakfast that had been set in front of him. It did look scrumptious… Valerie smirked as Gwen put a steaming mug of tea down on the table.
"He's just said there's not much information on them… they weren't necessarily Marked in the war, but they supported Voldemort. It's really strange. They didn't have anyone go through Hogwarts in the last 15 years, either, so it seems like they weren't much involved at all."
“I’m certain we can find one in this house, with all the secrets my aunt had hidden here.”
Ron is brilliant...
Draco Malfoy's task had been an impossible one and his father knew it to be another punishment for failing Voldemort last year… And now, Lucius stood in Dumbledore's office, in front of the man his son was tasked to kill, with his son lying dead in his wife's arms. He could not summon the energy for fury.
"It is not something that comes naturally to most. Someone who is particularly sensitive to magic might catch a whiff or two, if they have not honed in on the skill."
Harry watched him, and saw how he kept rolling his shoulders, like his shoulders were in pain, or… Or the point where his wing connected to his back. “Hey, are you okay? You were hurt earlier-” Harry had started to walk towards Draco, hands out towards him to try to help, but Draco snapped around to glare viciously at him, and Harry was scared he may still get hit with a fireball.
“Draco Malfoy, I’ve called you eight times! Sebastien is free for the day, he and Valerie are ready to take you out!”
Neville lovingly held the leaf before clipping it with a sharp, clean pair of shears. Harry jumped as the Mandrake-- Georgina-- shuddered and let out a short shriek. “No, shh, shh,” Neville immediately hushed. “It’s alright, it’s okay, see? All done.” He held up the leaf for her to see. “That’s it.” She settled, and the plant beside her-- Alfred-- seemed to lean over to comfort her. She seemed to look at the leaf, and then Neville, and nod just a bit.
“Tan France went to Hogwarts?!” Ron screeched, his hands going to his hair.
A pale, blond man.
The Room of Lost Things… It was just as chaotic and cluttered as Harry remembered. It would take months to properly sort through everything-- and a flash of silver caught his eye.
Harry took the letter and his tea through to his office and settled himself down at his desk before opening the letter.
"I- Well, I don't know. I don't know much about any of them… I think my great grandfather was in politics? But that's about all I know-"
He took of his glasses and rubbed his hands over his eyes, already tired. "Okay. Alright, fine. Tonight. Does it say how many people we're expected to bring in… or take down?"
When the dragon didn’t respond, due to it being a dragon and not an actual conversation partner, Harry continued.
Harry was so deep in thought as he walked into his kitchen in search of a cup of tea that he almost didn’t notice the large, stern looking owl sat on his kitchen table. He immediately recognised the owl as belonging to the Ministry; somehow all of their owls managed to adopt the exact same officious and self-important look that graced the faces of many senior ministry officials.
The last time he had been in Paris, it was just after his trial, where he'd been cleared of his charges due to his age and Harry's statement. He'd been in such a dark place for so long that Paris had seemed like heaven in comparison. His mother had taken him shopping and his favorite set of dress robes had resulted from the trip: gorgeous shades of blue in wool and silk. (He'd had them tailored to fit as he grew a bit more and put on some muscle from Auror work.)
Give me a week to set my affairs here in order, and I’ll be back home. I promise.
*****
He nodded again. “I see,” he said faintly. “My apologies. I was unaware he had a sister.”
“Oh, not that story again, Derrick!”
He felt a bit bad about the Animagus training, because he’d tried to get ahead and had accidentally swallowed the leaf Neville had given him. It was bitter and made him salivate a lot, and he’d nearly choked on the thing… he’d go ask Neville for another before his lesson with McGonagall. He’d make sure to be a lot more careful with this one, too. Neville probably wouldn’t be too happy to have to be giving him another one. Georgina definitely wouldn’t be pleased, giving up another leaf. He hoped it would only be the one more.
Something peculiar was happening in the 6th floor toilets… The doors had sealed themselves from the inside, not letting anyone inside. Coldness was seeping out from beneath the wooden doors, leeching through the stone walls of the castle itself.
“Oh, Harry darling…” At least she was smiling? That had to count for something. “Draco was right about one thing, I’ll tell you that,” she said like this was all some great joke. “You are absolutely oblivious.”
When you get this, I’d like you to make yourself come. Get yourself high up on your bed, spread your legs wide, and spell your toy to fuck your sweet hole like you did for the pictures until you ruin your sheets. Fuck yourself like you want me to when you come home.
And, coincidentally, he was
Draco Malfoy turned round to face Harry, a hard look in his eyes daring Harry to say anything about what had just happened.
Merry Christmas, my darlings!
“Of course, dear. Now, are you staying for tea?”
“Well, they put me with the Dursleys because there was some kind of protection in her blood because she gave herself up for me.” But… How could there be any kind of blood magic protection if the Dursleys weren’t magic?
And, well… I think second sexiest. I would be willing to try for a teaching position at Hogwarts in Potions… On one condition. I’ll let you guess.
I flirt with him all the time, Gwen, you have to believe me. I bring him lunch most days, and bring him tea and coffee every day we have work. I call him pet names, like dear and honey and sweetheart, and he threatens to report me to our boss. Honestly I’m surprised he talks of me fondly, all he does is complain when he’s here… so pardon me if I don’t necessarily believe you.
He watched Charlie think it over, shaking his head. “No breed I’ve seen before. Hope no one’s crossbreeding again, hate fixing those messes. Four legs, huge wings, a tail probably four metres long.” Alright, at least it wasn’t a wyrm or a wyvern, then. “It was silvery white, almost
carefully when I got it? Mine practically leapt to attention from the first few words in, and I had an amazing wank session. I was practically seeing stars by the end of it. You’d better make word on every promise you made in that letter, Harry James Potter, or may Merlin help your soul.
A heavy key appeared on the bar in front of Harry. He seemed to have passed the test. “Two galleons gets you your bed, supper tonight, and a bite in the morning ‘fore y'head off. Good?”
“I understand, dear. I trust you’ll do what you can to bring him home again.”
But Ron and Ginny? They shared a favorite that seemed unusual for the pair of them and their normal tastes.  There was a certain show that had them both hooked, a reboot of a similar show from when they were children… but this new version was so much better.
“I’m willing, I just… don’t want you to think badly of Remus, or of Draco, because of it. Draco will never forget his wolfsbane, so his shifts would never be like this…” He spoke as she led him into the room that had the Pensieve in it.
“Oh, Harry. Everything you’ve been through, but you still refuse to open your mind.” Open his… That sounded like something Trelawney would have said.
“These shoes, star child, just in black.” Draco looked down and hummed. Bas had on a pair of red canvas shoes, black and blue spotted socks disappearing up into his cuffed jeans. Huh… “They don’t cover your ankle, but the high top Converse do.” Valerie appeared with three boxes stacked atop each other.
Oh, what a nice little cafe. And a magical one, at that. It was a clear day, and Draco decided that having his lunch outdoors would be a nice treat. The café appeared to be a self-seating place, so Draco chose a table and sat down facing the street. It was a relatively nice day, for it being the end of winter. He decided he rather liked this cafe, and he'd have to visit it more often. Seeing a waiter come near him, Draco smiled and let the French roll off his tongue easily. "Hello, a pleasure."
How could Draco be happy with chicken wraps from the Ministry café when he had food like this at home.
It was Ginny and Ron's doing, really.
“Do you… do you still have this memory, Harry? Could I possibly… view it?”
“No.”
“But it’s different than bonding jewelry, right? You don’t just get your sweetheart bonding jewelry like ‘
Potions
“But you still find excuses not to visit, don’t you? So, come on, out with it, what’s on your mind? Just like Ronald, you are.” He blushed and bit his lip.
Gin says the wager is set at 50 Galleons, to be collected immediately after the Harpies win. I think I'm going to stay out if this one, love, I know how competitive you get, especially with Ginny. (Not that I'm also not competitive as hell, but that's not the point.) What shall we do when you win?
Hello, darling Harry Potter and Queer Eye fans!
"--so we're keeping it hush-hush. No problem, Harry," she assured him with a salacious wink and a grin. "Not a word out of me. But do have a good time, have a fancy little umbrella drink for me, will you?" She collected the forms from Harry and they filed themselves accordingly.
Narcissa paused only briefly after 20 minutes to reread the letter, which only fired her up again. Oh, at least she switched topics. He didn’t think she’d be able to keep going just on the one subject. Now she was talking about how stubborn and pigheaded Draco was and how he had a sort of heroic fantasy of being a martyr. He would’ve laughed to hear that one.
I would love to make up for those things, yes. I heard the rumors about your childhood… Not so good, I take it?
baby. That’s Felix.” Felix, in question, seemed to give a gurgle, not much caring for any of the adult conversation. He had a few locks of honey blond wisps atop his head, but other than that… Not incredibly remarkable. Then again, what baby was?
“It’s the best one I knew of in the area.” She just shook her head disapprovingly and led him up the stairs.
That was absolutely ridiculous. Even Draco knew that this wasn't about one boy wizard-- it was about literally every person, and everyone had the choice to fight.
If Harry thought Draco was manipulative, apparently that was
“Same way I did. A terrible accident that ended up having a happy outcome.” She gestured over to Tristan. “I can’t imagine life without him.”
“Yes, I’ve noticed…” He looked over all the different pieces with a smile. He did wonder what Harry would gift him, if they were to genuinely court. Or… or what he might pick for Draco's bonding piece. The thought made a touch of color appear on his face.
McGonagall seemed to think this over for a moment, nodding slightly. "Perhaps it is a reservoir of
Charlie only seemed mildly surprised, looking up at Harry as the nurse set the tray in his lap. “Harry, didn’t you come visit with the rest of the family yesterday?”
“I understand, darling. I’ll just pop it through, shall I?” A gorgeous tray of food appeared on his desk. Steak, eggs, mushrooms, and a sliced green apple. He could cry, it all smelled so good.
Harry love,
It had hit him, a few years ago, on his 22nd birthday, when he realized that his parents had never made it to that age, and how young they were when everything happened. They had become parents at 20 years old… Harry definitely couldn't imagine himself getting married when he was 20. It was unreal. In his hands was proof that his father deeply loved his friends and would go to great lengths to make sure they were loved and cared for.
A low growling drew Harry’s attention from the window, and he turned towards the source. The wizard Draco had been dueling had staggered back and dropped his wand. In an instant, a huge salt and pepper wolf took his place. Although Harry was dueling three wizards of his own, he saw the moment the werewolf leaped at Draco.
He nodded as he started to wash out the pan he needed. “I did, yeah. Mostly when I was in primary.”
you’ve got it all wrong, right now-”
Neville looked up from where it looked like he was replanting some devil’s snare. “Harry, what’re you doing here?”
better if you were sprawled out on the Chesterfield, watching me work a toy into myself. Maybe when you’re too worn out from teaching or brewing or the moon, you can lay back and boss me about, hm? Make me get myself off for your entertainment? And afterwards, I’ll crawl over and suck your cock so well you’ll see stars.
Both Remy and Sapphire were silent, processing everything. "...well, my love… It doesn't seem like you were ready. And that's alright, just-"
Two, there was something very wrong with the diadem. Draco detested being near it. It was obviously Dark Magic, though he did not know what kind. Prolonged exposure had him feeling at his worst and lowest point. It felt similar to being in the Manor when the Dark Lord had come to stay. Draco suspected that He had poisoned it-- turned the tiara itself evil, if one could corrupt non-magical objects in such a way…
Harry,
Hundreds of miles away, in Blaise Zabini's posh London bachelor pad, the kitchen goes eerily quiet for a few moments. Then a gorgeous, expensive, and high quality bottle of French red
Professor Draco Malfoy-Potter
Luckily (or unluckily), both men greeted him with a smile and a warm handshake. They were kind, courteous, and a decade older than him, but Draco decided that, for the moment at least, Gabriel and his husband were his favorite cousins. "You… took your husband's name?" They could do that? He wasn't surprised this family didn't disapprove of the fact he had a husband, but the fact he gave up his name…
Harry had spluttered a bit, but took his seat, watching as Euthymia continued tapping her wand to the chisel.
The file was relatively short on details, providing Harry with only the bare bones of the case, and it soon became clear that the first step in his investigation would involve speaking to Charlie. As an experienced dragonologist, Charlie would be able to provide Harry with specific information about the dragon that would hopefully speed up the early stages of his investigation. Harry decided to give Charlie a little more time to recover from the attack before bombarding him with questions, but resolved to head back to the hospital in the morning.
Though it was only a few agonizing moments, it felt like hours to Draco. When the change was finally complete, he was already so tired. So tired,
“That? Oh no, dear, that’s Bella.” Harry choked a little bit and cleared his throat.
“Says that they expect there to be five people at this little ‘meeting.’ We’ve dealt with worse.”
Nearly every breakfast/dinner they shared saw Draco eating some kind of deli sandwich and Harry packing away a full English breakfast, minus the baked beans. He had to keep his strength and stamina up for his long and exciting shifts as a healer.
Harry plucked the diadem from the mannequin-- from Draco's head-- and hissed as the now-familiar dark magic of Voldemort's soul tried to affect his mind. Harry-- and indeed Draco as well-- had been too distracted with the tiara to realize that he had been followed.
Curious, Harry flicked through the file attached to the letter, picking out the main facts of the case. Clearly, Charlie’s attack was the incident described in the letter, the details in the file expanding on what Charlie had said in the hospital. Harry would have been very interested in the case even without the personal connection, but the fact that the dragon had attacked someone close to him made him even keener to work on the case.
Neville sighed. “You’re lucky you’re a friend, Harry. Come on.” He followed Neville from the strawberry patch like a little puppy, thanking Neville for helping him, and subsequently inviting him to tea at Grimmauld sometime in thanks. (He was picking up pureblood customs faster than he’d realized.)
I miss you too. I hope you'll come home to me soon.
“No, no! I need a room to contain the fire-- I need a room to contain the fire!” He called out at the top of his voice, looking out over the ramshackle terrain. He saw Potter find an outdated broomstick and frantically fly for the door, dodging the fire and random spells from Crabbe and Goyle.
“Indeed. That’s probably why it worked.” She cracked half a smile at him before schooling her face back to her usual stern expression. “As usual, though, I believe you might be a special case. Filius and I have had multiple discussions about you and your magic since we found out
-Harry
Harry hurried down the hill, trying to keep himself on his toes. It wouldn’t be easy for a dragon to sneak up on him, especially in a forest full of branches to crack and leaves to rustle, but stranger things had happened in his life. Hearing a low, crooning sound, he froze and looked over his shoulder. Nothing that he could see. In fact, it sounded like it came from in front of him, just behind the cropping of bushes. Taking his wand out, he pointed it at the bushes and cast, “
"Whoa--" He put up his hands, almost in a 'slow down' gesture. "I don't-- a courting gift-?"
Fucking Merlin, you’ve got a mouth on you, don’t you? Well, hand in this case. I’d much rather it were on me, right now. How about this. Once you get this letter, go back to your bed, go on and strip. You want to be good for me, don’t you? Go on, tease yourself a bit. Twist your nipple. Pretend it’s me doing it. I’d drag a hand down your side, then just barely let my fingertips brush your cock. Only barely, though, can’t be too quick about it, after all. It’s always so much better when we draw it out, isn’t it?
“Wow… And— alright, I’ve always wondered this. Why ‘Draco’? Why not, like, Geminus?”
“Well I can't right well assassinate Dumbledore if I'm a gh- If I'm dead, can I, Myrtle?” It was hard for him to talk about his spectral state, as it felt somewhat similar to being alive… just less warm, more detached.
Harry’s eyes widened. “Oh. That’s… That’s a lot.” A core and a half. How much magic did normal cores normally have in them? Hm. That might be a Draco kind of question… He wondered how much magic Draco had. He was typically sensitive to magic, did he know about Harry’s core, too? This was… not really something to ask over pen and paper. That was a face to face conversation.
I want to come home. I can’t, this just proves I can’t.
Gwen held up her hands. "Okay, you two, enough. Don't fight over this…" Valerie just huffed and turned away, applying a bright pink polish to her nails. It was obvious she was going to ignore Draco now. Well, that was completely fine by him. Gwen sighed and rubbed their shoulders. "Come now, don't pout… Draco, I'm glad you have friends that are writing to you. I won't tease you anymore about him. And Valerie… you know that the right people will love you for who you are, regardless of magical ability."
“For a crime he did not commit, and you know this. Becoming a child’s godparent is a huge honor, and a big responsibility. It requires a ritual similar to a bonding ceremony, and there is blood magic involved. You would’ve been safe in Sirius’ care, because he was your father, for all intents and purposes, after your own parents were killed. In the eyes of your magic, anyways.”
"...it's really not as bad as he makes it seem. I do eat, you know." Mimsy placed the bowl of golden soup in front of Harry and he almost immediately began to drool.
Just before he was ready to leave, his eyes widened as Wynter came flying in the window.
"That's more than fine, Mrs. Malfoy, really."
First year again.
“Well, the way that the old traditions go, you get them a piece of jewelry. Something symbolic, typically that would remind them of the first day you met. If not jewelry, maybe new robes, or shoes, but it’s something they can wear so that people can see that they’re being courted.”
Harry… I
Rarely was one seen around the shop without the other closeby, which is why Euthymia is surprised when each man separately brings her the same sketch of a golden snitch, expressing interest in getting it tattooed. It was obviously a couple's tattoo, as the pair had both been seekers in school… she just didn't know why they wouldn't come in together.
He stepped forward into a clearing and couldn’t help but to gasp. Just as they’d said, there was a dragon that was frankly, fairly huge. It could easily throw Harry aside with one swipe of its tail. Silvery scales that seemed to shimmer with rainbows whenever the sunlight managed to catch on them, wide wings that could probably lift it in into the air in a single beat—long spiralled horns, too. Hell, it was gorgeous. And it was… running into trees on purpose? That was what it looked like, at least. Stepping further in, Harry looked around—Ah, perfect.
Derrick tipped his head back and laughed, shaking his head so his curls bounced a bit. “Not often, but it has been mentioned. After the Triwizard Tournament, I got a few comments. But, ah, my eyes are different, no glasses. And no scar.”
Narcissa smiled at him. “It’s really quite simple. You’ve mostly just got to decide you’re going to do what you need to without a care towards what anyone else has got to say.”
Angst all around.
If only that had been the end of it. Bas and Val had taken him into shop after shop, and some of them they left empty-handed, but others, such as this one… “I look ridiculous.” He stood in front of the mirror, alone in his little dressing room, new Converse on his feet, light blue denim clinging to his long legs, and a dark “Hawaiian shirt” on his upper half. Bas had told him to cuff his jeans, and to keep the two top buttons of his shirt undone. Draco sighed. They were waiting to see how foolish he looked. Stepping out of the dressing room, he raised his arms at his side before tucking his thumbs back into the pockets.
is because Vernon feared your magic, as did Petunia. They punished you for doing magic, but I believe they punished you for a number of other things, so you did not come to believe that your magic was bad or evil and should be suppressed.”
“But if he chose a different career path?” Harry shrugged, leaning back in his chair.
“If I put you in a fitted grey waistcoat, you could go work the front counter for Remy and Sapphire,” she said, coming over and fondly combing her hand through his hair. “Go on, let Valerie and Sebastien take you shopping, hm?”
Teddy has mentioned quite a number of colors he would like his room painted, since you've asked. His favorites are a deep plum purple, a buttery sunshine yellow, an apple green, and a turquoise that he wears in his hair most often. (Hermione has alerted me that this is 'Tiffany Blue' in the muggle world. High end jewelry, diamonds, and the like. Do you know it?) My guess is, he'd like each wall painted one of these colors. He's very excited for you to come home, by the way. He plans on giving you the 'biggest hug', so be prepared.
“Erm, I did, yeah,” Harry said, confused as he moved so Draco could see the moving ink. “Why-?”
Like hell I'm leaving you alone! This is as much my fault as anything. I was stupid, and leapt without looking, as per fucking usual. I didn't protect you like I should've and now you've run off to France of all places! I don't bloody want a new partner, I want you back. You're practically the only one that can handle me…
"So that's why they want us." Harry was well known for, well, often leaping before he looked. If you were in a rush… you called Potter.
I appreciate your concern. Please tell my mother I am currently in France. Perhaps the Parisians have kinder laws towards those afflicted. I suppose you'll have to find yourself a new partner. Now, for once in your life, please. Leave me alone and fuck off.
I'm glad the moon went well for you. Your best one yet, was it? That's good news for when you come home. Hopefully, it will be even easier for you then. Teddy was fine, just a bit achy and tired on the day of the moon. It was a bit hard for him to fall asleep until I curled up with him in his bed. (Wolves apparently make great body pillows for toddlers.) I doubt that he'll eventually shift himself, so it looks like he'll just have a bit of pain potion if he needs it. Maybe you two can cuddle for hours the morning after the full.
"Keep your pants on, Harry. I wasn't going to ask. The werewolf laws are all a load. I don't think this is the right choice for him to make, but it
Draco sighed softly, pulling on a sweater. These nights were still freezing. And they may have thought he had some tragic story, that was all well and good, but they certainly wouldn’t appreciate a Dark Mark at the dinner table. He checked the address again and sighed to himself. He had been completely coerced into having dinner with a stranger and his family… even if he
I find myself oddly excited for your return, because then I can shift down and smell you. The shirt you sent back was
“Alright.” Why couldn’t they just Apparate? This family was just confusing sometimes. The only reason they couldn’t Apparate would be…
After the two of them were sat down to breakfast, a familiar owl was flying in, with two letters attached. It seemed that Draco had decided to write Harry and Narcissa at the same time, to save everyone time.
“I’m fine.” Draco said shortly. He wasn’t looking at Harry anymore; his eyes were lowered to the ground and he was shuffling his feet awkwardly, so unlike the confident Draco Harry knew.
"No, bless him," she said, leaning into her husband and sighing sweetly. "Only three, but he got to everything else pretty quickly after that. That's how it usually goes… very slowly, and then all at once." She looked over at Draco. "Ten years? You poor dear."
talk with plants. “Good, that’s good… Listen, Alfred. I need a very big favor, okay?” There was more grumbling and Harry swore the little plant-man glanced over in his direction. “Yeah, another one. I know, I told him so.”
A man who was unbearably familiar to Harry.
“It means, husband mine, that Harry won't have to hide or lie about anything. He can admit to his war trauma without them asking ‘what war?’ and they'll be able to see and enter Grimmauld Place and we wouldn't have to hide Teddy's abilities around them.” She smirks as the two Weasleys nod along, understanding how fortuitous the situation is.
You’re such an utter sap. I’m rolling my eyes at you. Can you feel me rolling my eyes at you from that far away? I hope you can. Because it’s entirely deserved. Though I suppose I could be convinced to send just one more picture or two.
Harry shifted in his seat and reached for his tea-- herbal this time instead of his usual strong black tea: oh yes, that hadn't escaped Draco's notice either. He looked uncomfortable under his husband's concerned silvery gaze, drinking his tea to avoid answering his husband.
Harry paused, unsure of what to say. The cottage his parents had died in wasn't a Potter property, it was Dumbledore's. Come to think of it… he hadn't thought much about
"A pleasure to meet you too, nephew." Well, cousin, but still. "Maman has talked about you for years, I am glad you're finally here with us."
tradition, but I think it’s much simpler than anything else.” He hummed, finally looking away from the ring.
even though I’ve told him numerous times to stop, he just won’t! I told him, the next time he did, I’d go straight to Robards.”
“Well, yeah…” He cocked his head a little. “I couldn’t go back to the Auror corps without him, they’d partner me with someone else, and probably make me take him in and register him… And I won’t do that to him.”
“You think he would be a good… teacher? To children?” Harry paused and thought about it.
Any excuse to flee the Manor was a good one. Since his catastrophic failure in the Department of Mysteries-- failure to acquire and deliver the prophecy to the Dark Lord-- life had not been kind to Lucius Malfoy, nor to his wife and child.
Harry had gotten his done first, the fluttering snitch now taking up a few inches on the front of his right forearm. Euthymia said nothing, then, about Draco's upcoming appointment for the same ink.
“I… Yes. I believe I did,” he finally decided upon after a moment of thought. She seemed pleased by this and nodded.
It was a tactic that had worked well for him before. It seemed as though dragons found his voice soothing, and at times he’d even had the feeling that they could understand him.
"The context is kind of a long story…" The two of them sat down, and Harry proceeded to tell her what had happened in the last month, give or take a few days.
Both of his cousins gasped and grinned at him. “You look great! Those jeans— your legs look so good!” Valerie clapped a little bit and Bas gave him a little wolf whistle.
Thank you for your concern, however I am capable of protecting myself. You don’t always need to be a Savior. I should have seen it coming a mile off, but I didn’t, so now I’m paying for it. And we only have the best case statistics because half the time you’re put on cases that would otherwise be suicide attempts, but alas, nothing is capable of stopping a stubborn Boy Who Lived ten
-Completely muggle/no-maj au, no magic
Sirius, right?”
Don’t let Granger know that you’ve been helping fund it, though. I trust you’ve been doing it all anonymously? You know how she’ll react if she finds out it’s from you. She and Weasley are meant for each other, truly. Neither can accept any kind of charity, can they? You know, when I noticed that he was coming in with worn down robes, I
“I… Yeah. Yes. Absolutely. Magical cores. Love them.” The atmosphere was thick with tension as McGonagall realized he was bluffing.
“Yeah. We all got busy. I know. What about you, with Auror business?” Right, could not really talk about that, could he?
"I'm attempting to complete an Animagus transformation, and I know you need a Mandrake leaf for that… can you help?"
“You’ll have to let me know when a good time is.”
“Yes. I think I’d like that.” Bas patted him on the shoulder and headed back out to find him a pair. Valerie handed him the next item of clothing, which was a soft tshirt with grey sleeves and a heathered blue torso. Draco held the fabric in his hands gently. “Oh.” It was very soft fabric, though not quite as soft as Harry’s maroon shirt. It would only get softer with wear and washes.  Valerie forcibly spun him and pushed him back into the changing room.
They were a few feet away from the scene and Harry saw himself-- his young, overly-thin, scared 13-year-old self-- near Hermione, tiny in comparison to her cloud of hair, and Ron, twiggy and towering over them both. All of them stared at Lupin, and at Sirius, who was trying to keep the man under control. Lupin was changing before their eyes, and… When he was young, it had seemed so slow, and torturous, but now, looking back on it, it was much quicker than he’d first thought.
Your full name? Really? That's what's getting you off, right now? I've got to ask, then. What doesn't get you off? Do you even have limits? I do, before you ask, I'm just wondering how far you'll take this.
“Just window shopping today, I suppose. What have you got?” She raised a sculpted eyebrow at him and smirked.
They both frowned at him as Ron started to serve them. "What? Why?"
“Does it count if I say I’ve been trying?” She smiled at him.
Knowing that the dragon wouldn’t answer, Harry took the wing and bent it carefully. It was more than big enough to engulf him entirely. He watched the dragon’s reactions, and as he tugged it forward, the dragon winced. “Yeah, right at that joint, huh? I’m gonna press down on it, try not to land me in St. Mungo’s too, alright? That wouldn’t be too good for you, I think. They’d send the more serious handlers. Trust me, you like me a lot more than you’d like them. When I say serious, I mean in just about every way.” He leaned forward and gently pressed down on the point where the wing connected to the torso, and the dragon roared and hissed, his claws digging into the ground. But he
Draco narrowed his eyes, taking in his husband for a moment. His hair was curlier than usual, nice and shiny and healthy. His olive skin was clear, almost glowing. “Well, you look amazing. I suppose Healer Màvros had the right idea. Was it stress?”
Light of my life, my moon and stars,
A cousin on each side of him, they left the shop after Bas’ client had settled up. “Okay, first things first, Val. Start from the bottom, or the top?” Bas arched an eyebrow and fully took in his cousin. “You have good taste, but… this is something you’d wear on a date.”
This chapter is being uploaded in honor of Dan Rad's birthday today! Yippee!
“Oh— Of course! I apologize, I’ve overwhelmed you. I will be back, take your time.” There… There were other Malfoys. In France. Alright, then. That was certainly not what he’d been expecting when he went out to lunch… Now he
It was quite easy to change the wards to allow Narcissa to Floo directly into the first floor parlour. They were both dressed more casually than the night before, though she still wore a floor length dress with long sleeves. Harry greeted her with a smile and actually pressed a kiss to her hand. “Mrs. Malfoy, thanks again for coming. Have you been here before?” He knew that Sirius had grown up here, but guessed that Narcissa had not.
Something peculiar is happening in the 6th floor toilets...
“That’s good, I’m glad. Now, let’s get you a room, shall we? We’ll get your things from that dreadful hotel in the morning.”
Your Harry
(See the end of the chapter for

Harry,
“Ron, you know Draco and I work very well together. You know he balances me out for a lot of things. I’m pretty sure you haven’t thought he was evil or plotting anything for years… Why is this a bad idea?”
Draco just scoffed quietly. “Why not, though I doubt there’s much conversation to be held.”
I will tell you one thing. It wasn’t nearly as good as the real thing. Though I would love to put your cock-sucking skills to the test. Based on how the teachers at school adored you, I hope they’re on par with you arse-kissing skills. I’d of course make you give me a little show of it.
“I will. And… Draco or no, would you like to have dinner? I understand if you’ll be busy-”
the daring Gryffindor of the two of us. Quite the bit of turnaround, there. Ah, well, if that’s what tickles your fancy, who am I to say no?
"Because he seems to be as reluctant as she is. That, or my poor nephew has terrible luck in finding good men. Or good men without commitment issues."
Harry couldn't help but frown. It seemed all the Malfoys liked to tease or insult him, though the latter was mainly Lucius. "What do you-- we were kissing on the sofa at Grimmauld a year ago and
The letter came in the afternoon of the day after full moon, and Harry was, honestly, a bit terrified to read it. But he had to. Draco couldn’t go through this alone.
“M… etro?” He… He thought he had an idea of what that meant, but…
I am glad that Teddy seems enthusiastic about staying with us, though. However, I do require one condition. I get final say on what colors his room is painted. If I have to look at the walls of that room every day, I will
“Malfoy? You come here, too?”
“Trust me, I’ve no need for spoiling. This truly is a break. I’m not hunting malicious wizards at the moment, nor am I pushing papers and writing reports.”
“It does get old, I would tell him that,” Remy said, leaning over to kiss Sapphire’s cheek. ”But a pair! Very ambitious, that Zabini. I can’t even handle one wife,” He stage-whispered, grinning when Sapphire smacked his shoulder.
“I hadn’t known he ran, but it makes sense, of course.” Harry let her out of the hug and took his seat again, snuggling himself into the squashed teal armchair he’d claimed as his own. He picked up his mug of tea and held it close.
Narcissa nodded, waving her hand. "Mimsy, if you would- Thank you." A house elf appeared with a tray of tea and biscuits, setting it down before bowing to Narcissa and snapping itself away. "It is possible that Draco went to either of the two of them. He trusts them entirely."

“Of course! October, my love, pass me his glass.”
I understand he may have new doubts of himself due to his afflicted Lycanthropy, but I highly doubt that these are brand new. He loves you so, so why does he seem to believe you two must keep each other at arms’ distance? Please, darling. Help an old woman understand the heartache her little nephew is going through.
I’ve sent along my resignation, as well, as well as a bit of an apology note towards Robards. I do feel regretful for leaving so suddenly, but not for leaving, if that makes any sense? I think this was what I needed most.
“You look like a foreign businessman. I’m kind of afraid you’ll be pickpocketed or mugged,” Val mentioned from his other side. “Hmm. Shoes first?”
“When you say ‘mate’, you don’t mean a friend, do you.”
“Oh, darling.” That was a little nice, he guessed. She was rubbing at his arm, apparently trying to comfort him? He didn’t really think he needed comforting, but the thought was nice.
“Oh.” An actual squib. The Malfoys had a squib in the family. How could someone, in a world of magic,
“My tragic— I’m sorry, you were
I’ll have you know that I didn’t kiss arse at school, especially not with the teachers. They either loved or hated me for their own reasons. (Also, in case you haven’t realized, I’m pretty handy with a wand, even if I can’t necessarily duel creatively.) Not to toot my own horn, but my magic is strong… and I know that’s part of the reason why you’re attracted to me.
Tell me honestly. Has mother been trying to corner you and teach you about courting traditions?
Ron crossed his arms right back at him. “That’s different. They’re not rich brats.”
She took his hand and squeezed it. “I think that’d be perfect then. But I didn’t know that you were already planning so far ahead. You must be sure he’s going to accept.”
He felt… stiff. Aching. It was like an itch he couldn't scratch. Already he detested the physical symptoms of his lycanthropic affliction. He already hated it. He gently massaged his aching hands as he looked out his small, third floor window. Paris was lit up, warm yellow lights contrasting nicely against the inky blue-black of the night sky. The moon was waning, Draco could feel it in his bones.
“Master and Mistress! Here much earlier than-- oh! Oh! Young master-!” The poor French elf had just noticed Draco, its huge eyes quickly filling with tears. “Oh terrible day! Wretched day!” It wailed, wringing its wrinkled hands as it shook on its bare feet. “Wh-what can Leesy do f-for Master and Mistress?” The elf seemed to remember itself, even amongst the shock.
"Draco? He's at St. Mungo's, isn't he? I was waiting for visiting hours to see him—"
"You'll be seeing quite a bit of me in the future, Longbottom, you can count on it!"
“I hear his father pulled him and had him transferred to Silovikizba**,” a Ravenclaw hissed to their friend group. “With the amount of Dark Arts their family is involved in, it wouldn't surprise me.”
“Hey, be nice! I was taking care of a sick toddler, and then caught his fever! I normally don’t look like that, Draco.” She rolled her eyes at him and picked up her purse. “We’re rescuing Bas from work, come on.”
In the second photo, Harry has shifted up on his knees and is working himself down on the toy, riding it. Neither photo shows an orgasm, but they do promise a good time]]
Felix stirred and Brigitte stood, scooping up her son and moving out of the room to put him to bed for the night. October topped off everyone's glasses, switching out red for white, and settled again beside Draco. That sounded incredibly familiar. "You… You mean charmed muggle artifacts?" The same department as Arthur Weasley?
“The…” Right. Best not to question it. “Right. Let’s see it.” She led him up to the third floor, and for a moment, Harry thought she would lead him to his own bedroom. She stopped just before Harry’s door, however, and grinned at him.
“Hey, Val. Looking for Bas?” The woman only glanced at Valerie for a moment before going back to… whatever it was. Was that how tattoos were applied? What sort of machine was it?
As the usual, Blaise's letter had him cackling with glee. That man and his sense of humor. Oh, Draco wouldn't be the one to tell Blaise that he was in love with both Dean and Seamus, he'd get laughed out of his invitation to lunch. But still, anyone with bloody
"He's been… Draco's been turned?" He watched her expression turn to shock and horror at the thought. Having been around Molly enough, he knew what a mother looked like when her heart was breaking for her children. "Have you asked Blaiziel or Pancella?"
“Heh, yeah. Most of the time, my aunt just didn’t want to cook, so she taught me to cook when I was little, except if something big was happening. Then she would just make sure I stayed out of the way.”
Harry groaned, putting his face in his hands for a moment. “Okay. Okay! This is fine—” He looked up into Narcissa’s anxious face and sighed. “I brought him there last night. Our raid went horribly wrong, and he was hurt. I stayed the night in their waiting room… and they woke me up about 15 minutes ago to tell me that he disappeared. He escaped.”
He pushed through the morning crowds, keeping his focus on Malfoy's quickly retreating back. Something ugly twisted in his chest-- something angry and bitter, black with fury at Malfoy and all he stood for. He followed him up to the 6th floor bathroom and watched for a handful of moments as Malfoy gripped the edge of the sink, hunched over the porcelain. He was as pale as his dress shirt, and he was sobbing; choked off, gut-wrenching sobs, the kind that would eventually make one sick. The ugliness inside of Harry reared its head at seeing Malfoy so weak-- and it broke through the surface.
Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way.
I've passed your sentiments on to your mother, like you asked. (She's been round for tea at Grimmauld twice this week already. I think she'd hoped I had you hidden away in one of my spare bedrooms… I could do, you know. Plenty of room, and it's practically half yours anyway…) If she manages to track you down in France, don't be too surprised. I figure she'd walk the ends of the Earth to find you and make sure you're safe and call you a right idiot for running off. And so would I., Fuck you're such a prat for running away, Malfoy.
"He what?" Narcissa seemed to stare at him another minute before ushering him inside. "Come in, darling, please. What happened to him?"
[[Enclosed are two more pictures. One is from behind Draco with a bedsheet wrapped haphazardly around him as he stands in front of a large window, looking out over Paris, the lights silhouetting his figure. When it moves it’s simply changing from Draco looking at the camera to look back at the view. His sheet slips down his shoulder before he shrugs it back up. In the second picture, he lets the bedsheet slip entirely, revealing his naked figure, though there isn’t much to be seen in the dim lighting.]]
He played with his hands in his lap for a moment. "...I'm not sure if they'll allow Draco back… and I don't want anyone else watching my back on missions… so I'm pretty sure our Auror careers are done. We're using up all our rolled-over vacation days now."
Draco was suddenly reminded of his embarrassing crush on Bill Weasley in 4th year.
I am so excited for this fic! I hope you are too! That being said, please continue to send me your thoughts and support in the comments. I will be trying my hardest to keep all HP characters and Queer Eye gentlemen as true to themselves as I possibly can.

“Mhm, with one of those little gilded dessert spoons, star child.”
The Holyhead Harpies haven’t been doing poorly this year, though I can’t wait to see how they fare against the Quaffle Punchers. They’ve been having a spectacular season, you know. I am surprised that you never went professional. The call and allure of crime-stopping and Dark wizard-chasing was too much for you, was it?
Neville looked Harry over, and for a long, terrifying moment, he thought he was going to say no- “Come on, Mandrakes are in greenhouse six.” Harry let out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding and followed Neville down towards the correct greenhouse.
“My name isn’t Dray.”
Draco gave himself a few moments, and once he was certain his cheeks were no longer splotchy and his eyes no longer red, he strode back out to the main room- “Sorry, sorry, I know I’m late, Floo networks were all backed… up…”
"Looking for a husband of your own, then? Is that another reason why you've come to Paris?"
The next day at work, he acted like nothing happened. I was a bit hungover, and didn’t want to cause a fight that would cost what relationship I already had with him. So I didn’t bring it up.
“I got his next letter just before your Floo call came through.” He half stood up, to take the letter from his back pocket. He handed it to her, across the table. “He’s got an off-the-shelf Wolfsbane potion for his first full.”
Werewolf? I may as well sign my own death warrant.
“You were lost in your own head.”
Harry reached into his pack and started to pull out a nice healing salve that he’d brought with him. It healed just about anything, above or below the surface. He didn’t see much wrong on the surface, so maybe the poor thing just twisted a wing. “Normally, he’s constantly working. I heard there’s been a bet going around recently of what his longest shift’s been. Highest number so far is 78 hours, the lowest is 15. Tells you what we all think of him, doesn’t it?”
"I'd rather not, thank you," he said with distaste. Who celebrated not having a partner?
Narcissa laughed, but it didn’t seem like she was laughing
She sat him down on the couch across from her. “I’m well, dear, but as I said, it’s been very quiet. The kind of life you live, raising seven little ones, you’re not accustomed to the quiet, even if it has been a few years.”
Option Number 2:
“...I’m sorry, say again?”
Now that the students have left for the summer, Draco fully allowed himself to wander the halls, to float more than a few inches off the floor and get used to his new baseline for normal. Myrtle wasn't much for roaming the halls-- she much prefered to travel via pipe, which Draco couldn't bring himself to try-- so he wandered alone.
"I'm certain that Draco will appreciate that. Thank you for going to such great lengths for him." She smiled and set her cup down to instead lean over and wrap him up in a hug.
"I see," she said primly at the end of it all. "And are you, then, asking for training to achieve an animagus form?"
Harry pulled back the curtain and blanched at the half-naked Draco lounging on Euthymia’s table, arms tucked under his pale head, half a dragon sketched out on his back.
“I see. Hopefully we will be more careful, then.” She put her letter aside and folded her hands atop the desk. “Well, Potter, as I’m sure you’ve read, arguably the most important part of the Animagus process is finding the animal that resides inside you, that resonates with your soul and your magical core.”
Valerie smiled at him and got up to get herself some food. She started chopping an apple for her son and glanced over her shoulder at her cousin. “So, Draco… any plans for the rest of the week?”
Curled up on the floor, sitting in the moonlight that streamed in from the window, there was a longing pain that Draco couldn’t identify. It was like it came from his core, from his very soul. He— and his wolf— were so crushingly lonely that all he could do was whine and sometimes howl, when he had the energy. There was a rattling sound that had him looking up towards the door. What was it? What was going on? The door creaked open and he watched his Auntie Gwen step into the room. “Oh, darling…” She entered the room and closed the door behind her.
It didn’t take much for Neville to get Harry a new leaf. He told him sternly not to lose it again, and Harry agreed, eager to head to his lessons with the Headmistress. He made it up to her office just before noon, as they’d agreed, a touch out of breath from the number of stairs. “Come in, Mr. Potter.” How did headpeople do that?! It was all part of the magic and mystery, he supposed, as he pushed the door open. He smiled as he saw her behind her desk, finishing up a letter to someone.
“Alright, then. You can sit with Gramma if you eat your lunch.” Gwen pulled him up to sit on her lap, and Draco smiled, feeling a warm, pleasantness gently curl in his chest before it quickly turned to a cold dread. Was… Was this… No, it couldn’t be.
“What, ‘Silver Prince’?” Draco's face twisted up slightly, as if he were tasting the name itself and trying to decide if he liked it. “I suppose there are worse names…”
"That's-- thank you. That'll keep me motivated. I was hoping you'd help me with it, where you could."
And if you want to wear your collar out in public, who am I to stop you? But I'd like it just as much if it was kept just between us. Regardless, you deserve something well made and comfortable.
I’d very much like it if we spoiled and took care of each other. Making up for childhoods and lost time, we’ll say, right? We’re each other’s trophy husband. (Er, trophy fiancé? Trophy-husbands-to-be? Unimportant.)
They had just finished the “Make Ted Great Again” episode and, amongst the anguish of running out of new episodes, Ronald Billius Weasley had a genius idea. He’d turned to his younger sister, who had gotten up and taken the empty popcorn bowl with her.
“That’s what I thought. I remember the wedding announcement in the papers.” She paused to take a sip of her wine, and met his gaze again. “I went to school with a number of Blacks, too.”
“Right.” They seemed to appraise each other for another minute. Sebastien took off his jacket— my, that was a lot of tattoos. “What’s for dinner, then?”
but you smell amazing Draco. I just want to sniff and lick you, wolf form or no. As a thank you… and an incentive to write back quickly, I’ve also sent you a present.
“There was a Yule Ball, in our fourth year, and… He’s always the type to never put much thought into his hair, or his clothes, but… Watching him dance in his dress robes with that smile… It made me see him differently.” Draco had been struck speechless at the sight of Harry in his emerald dress robes, standing on the dance floor, surrounded by the wintry paradise that the Great Hall had become, faux snowflakes finding a place of rest in his dark curls. Even now, the memory made him blush and smile. “Of course, I’m fairly certain he hardly even noticed me. He was far too focused on some floozie a year above us.”
“No no-- they sent him to Durmstrang-- Karkaroff was a Death Eater too. Probably got special treatment--”
[[The letter was attached to a light blue sweater, definitely softer than anything Harry’s got in his wardrobe, and absolutely drenched in Draco’s scent. Like he was wearing it for

“I can,” he said softly. “Yes.”
“--and I was trying to plan a cute way to tell you and I just blurt it out like a--”

basic, but they made it clear I’d need a lot more training to be on the same level.” Alright, he had his bag, he just needed to reach in and grab the collar. That would be easy. Reaching slowly into his bag, he kept talking.
“Besides,” the nurse continued, “Charlie Weasley just woke up, so why don’t you go talk to him while he eats his breakfast?”
brought the collar up to the correct size and a locking charm fastened it quickly and securely.
“He sounds lovely, Harry. Well then, most likely, I would get him a pair of robes.” Harry hummed and nodded, thinking back to what Draco was getting fitted for… midnight blue velvet. On an 11 year old. Wow. Rich
“I’m sorry, Harry. You’re right, about most things, and my goal was not to start a fight with you. Though, I must commend you for not backing down.” She turned him so that he’d face her. “You are so very
“I have to go.”
“Very good!” She bounced the baby on her knee a bit and looked him over. “Mmm, you do look very much like my brother did, I can see it clearly. But your eyes, they’re different. From your mother’s side of the family?” She spoke as if they were old friends, just getting caught up, and not an estranged great-aunt and great-nephew.
I'd like it if you wanted to… push me around a bit, tell me what to do… take care of me. And of course, I want to do that for you. I'd do nearly anything you asked of me, love. If you wanted me on my knees in the shower, sucking you off while you tug on my hair, I'd do it in a heartbeat. If you wanted me on our bed, face down and arse up towards the Floo, waiting for you--

And so, Harry went around plucking immobilized pixies out of the air and nudging them into the ever expanding cage. Of course, the moment that she opened the wardrobe, more pixies were flooding out. “
She gasped and her eyes sparkled with mischief behind her lenses. Her hot pink acrylic nails
No, I haven’t finished ‘A Picture of Dorian Grey’ yet. I’m working on it.
“And where you’re staying, you feel safe?”
“No worries, I will give you the address—” His pen wrote on its own, scribbling the address on his little notepad, which ripped the page off itself. October snatched the paper out of the air and handed it to Draco, grinning. “Maman will be so pleased, I cannot wait to tell her!”
"Request granted, let her through."
If you do achieve the transformation, I’d appreciate a picture.
“Euthymia? If you’re busy, I can come back—”
Unless Harry was crazy, the dragon’s ear turned more towards him, and he was glancing at Harry more. Was this dragon trying to play coy with him? This was too weird. “What, you like hearing about Malfoy more than you like hearing about Charlie? You’re about as weird as me, you know that?”
“But the last letter he sent, Luna, you could tell he was so sad and scared and hurt—”
The rest of the family all glanced at each other and October cleared his throat. “Well, my boy, you might be in for a bit of a shock. Quite a few of us have married non-magies— er, muggles.”
Really, Harry, don’t worry so much. Yes, it is quiet, but… I think I needed time to myself. Time without you, or mother, or Blaise or Pansy, or anyone else. Time to reflect.
Draco read over the letter that had come in and had to take more than one calming breath. Something in him ached
"A few more, I'll tell you when, don't worry. We're getting off at Opéra, remember? Madeleine is the last one before we get off the train."
Pouring the batter into the pan, Harry stared down at it. “There were lots of days I wished I didn’t come back.”
She took hold of his hand and pulled him up into the train. "Hey, it's alright. Just surprised Derrick didn't also mention that I didn't have it, too." She squeezed his hand. "I'm okay, really." The train sped out of the station, and Draco lurched to catch his footing.
And yes, you are a loon, and now it is my misfortune to say that you’re my loon. Oh, how the cards of fate have dealt themselves, and I must consider whether I play on, or fold my hand.
“Well, yeah, honestly,” he admitted, looking a bit closer. Ah, now he could tell… It was something about her eyebrows, or maybe how her nose was slimmer.
Tonight is the night of the full moon. I feel more confident about this one, particularly because I’ve managed to brew and take a dose of my own potion. It doesn’t ever end up tasting much better, but knowing that I made it myself, I feel much more at ease. Hopefully by the time you get this there’s still time before daylight. It’s silly, I know, but… I would prefer if I knew that you were going to be transformed as well, during the moon. It would comfort me.
Draco! Thinking about this, and about you, definitely set me up to take the pictures I've sent along with this letter.
Narcissa leaned back in her chair. “But do you think he would want to teach?” She had him there. Draco never seemed to be overly fond, whenever they had to work with kids for any reason. Harry hesitated before sighing.
Harry was grateful when the Floo let him through and he stepped out, right in front of McGonagall. "Mr. Potter. What an unexpected surprise."
I went weak at the knees with your shower talk. Circe's tits, Draco;
Harry gave her a nod. “Yeah, I’ve heard of that once or twice. But we haven’t had one in years, right?”

You shouldn’t have to go through it, either. And I know my mother is firm, but I still want to protect her. She certainly doesn’t deserve any of this.
Draco scoffed, rolling his eyes. “As you so love to prove, there’s a first time for everything.” He proceeded to drop no less than 10 sugars into his large drink, keeping eye contact with Harry the entire time.
Thinking back to previous scared animals that he’d helped, Harry sat himself down at the edge of the clearing, just inside the tree line. The dragon needed to get used to him, to realise that he wasn’t a threat. Harry placed his wand on the ground beside him, just slightly too far away to be able to grab it quickly, a clear sign of peaceful intent that the dragon should be able to interpret.
Valerie let out a squeal of happiness and Bas— he looked proud. “Perfect.”
“I won’t argue that he played the long game, because that is precisely what he did. However, the
I agree that it's a bit too early to think of babies, at least too early for seriously considering it. Teddy is spending the next full with me, so I'll watch for any wolf-like signs that I wouldn't normally see. Maybe the next time I'm at the Burrow, I'll ask Luna and Ginny if they'd consider us for surrogate fathers when they're ready. Gin is still mostly focused on Quidditch and Luna is… doing what she wants, I suppose. And honestly darling, I think if Teddy is only sensitive to the moon, and doesn't completely shift, I think any babies of ours would be fine. That's why you'll research a bit, right?
-Harry
“Hey, all jokes aside, you do look really good. How does everything feel?”
“Right. Of- Of course.” ‘Aunty Gwen?’ This couldn’t possibly be a relative of his father, or grandfather. It was always full and proper titles, even when he was very young. Formalities made the Malfoys who they were… didn’t they?
“I haven’t seen him around for a while actually… I wonder if he’s on holiday? I hope he’s okay…” Harry continued as he walked over to the dragon, now focused far more on the dragon’s reactions than on what he was saying.
She spoke against his hair, Harry acutely aware of the brush of her lips against the top of his head and the warmth she seemed to radiate. "What did he do to deserve you?" That finally choked Harry up, and he took off his glasses to cover his face with his hand.  "No matter what happens between the two of you, there will always be a place for you at the Manor." Harry finally broke down and pulled Narcissa into a full hug before hiding his face in her neck, trying not to let his tears drip onto her dress. She held him there, only quietly hushing him, and saying “I know, I know.”
Harry always had been one to take risks though.
His eyes widened at seeing the pendant. “Oh, no, I couldn’t-” A pear-shape emerald sat comfortably beside yellow and rose gold leaves, with delicate white gold vines connecting them to each other and the chain. At first glance, there was a serpent-like dragon hidden in the pattern.
Good. Now you can let your hand start to wrap around it. But go slow. Not too fast, now. Oh, I can imagine your face. Wanna know what makes it even better? Get that new toy of yours, and use your magic to get it going. Now really start pumping your shaft. That feels good, doesn’t it? You like that. You’re going to come any second now. Go on, then. Do it. Cum for me.
“I bloody know it's supposed to be oatmeal, Harry. Allow me to rephrase the question. Why in Merlin's name are you eating a bowl of that paste with berries instead of your full English?”
“Well, I already know that Sirius was my goddad, but seeing as he was in Azkaban-”
He had a feeling that this was going to be a very long day.
The waiter seemed to pause, raising an eyebrow and looking him up and down. He seemed to realize himself and blinked rapidly a few times. "Ah, good day. My apologies, you just look
know?”
his own gender, more like.”
“You only plan on accepting her offer so long as Draco accepts?”
The rumor mills of Hogwarts produced a number of theories, their metaphorical wheels working at a startling pace. It began, as one would think, in the Slytherin common room. After all, prominent students didn’t just up and vanish every day. That really was more of a Gryffindor trait, in their eyes. But that didn't change the fact that Draco Malfoy had vanished from Hogwarts and, after a few days, people were doing more than just wondering why.
“It seems so, yes. Do you know where he would Apparate?”
Draco had no idea where Potter was, no one did. No one paid Draco any attention, as they were all fighting for their lives. There, in the courtyard, he could spy a handful of redheads-- the Weasleys. Though he did not know what compelled him, he quickly moved towards them.
"Oi, that's a bit inaccurate, I think. I think of myself as a 'knight in swirling robes', as should you," he joked, referencing a common phrase in Teddy's story books. And if anyone looked like a prince, it was definitely Draco. And faerie prince, at that.
your intentions, exactly, towards Draco?” Harry had never known true fear until that moment. He'd stared down multiple international criminals, dueled Death Eaters, and killed one of the worst wizards of all time… and it all paled in comparison to this little question. He's lucky he didn't choke on his ravioli.
Harry,
Harry,
“So… what does this mean? For nominating Harry?”
“Wow,” Harry murmured, nearly breathless. “That’s beautiful. That’s what his magic looks like..?”
“Such a sweet boy, you. We’ll give Bas a call, see if he’s busy, shall we? Gives me some time with my Tristan,” she mused, heading out of his room. Draco looked down at his lap. Did he really seem so uptight and stuffy? He thought he'd loosened a fair amount in recent years.
“Well, no, of course not.” Why would he?
“Well, at first he gave me a very nice pair of black shoes, but I didn’t quite realize that was what he was trying to say, so after the shoes, he got me a silver necklace, with a pendant of a black shoe.” Harry tossed his head back and laughed, because that was adorable, and totally something a younger Arthur would do. Completely on-brand.
What sort of world did these people
Draco Malfoy-Potter
Headmistress McGonagall
“Ah. I’m afraid I can’t help him there. I have the same luck.”
“Oh… Oh Draco…” She gingerly perched herself on the edge of the Victorian fainting couch, the tips of her fingers barely brushing her lips. “Stubborn thing— you
“Contact the Malfoys immediately, Minerva. Tell them only that I must speak with them about Draco, and that it must be today. Please.” With that, Albus and Draco were alone in his office. He stepped closer to the body and a quick flourish of his wand unbuttoned the cuffs and sleeves of the dress shirt.
"...so having Heads of House that are on good terms would promote better attitudes and relationships?" Damn. He had to hand it to her, she'd thought things through.
I know the raid
“I definitely have the motivation and the magic. It’s just the focus and finding the animal inside me, I suppose.” He caught her gaze. “Do you think I’ll be able to?”
"And how extraordinary will
“Non. A break is you sit down and let me feed you chocolate and strawberry crêpes.” She grinned at him and pulled out his chair. “Let me spoil you, just a little.”
He shook his head. “Yes and no. I hardly know them, though-”
“...Sebastien Frey…” He made quick eye contact with his parents. “...I didn’t have a twin separated at birth, did I?”
"I didn't say none of that! I didn't say it's got to do with magic! Just that Harry's gonna make him an even worse brat!"
Sapphire held up her hands. “Alright, alright. I’ll admit, I don’t know everything, and I have been wrong before. I apologize for overstepping, Draco. I did not mean to upset you.” Draco scoffed, rolling his eyes as he only turned back towards his food. He didn’t come here to get interrogated and inspected. He came because… because October hadn’t left him a choice. He was being held hostage by hospitality and niceties. The fiends.
Harry,
Wednesday morning came far too soon, and Draco took his wolfsbane potion when he awoke. He felt it, like he felt someone watching him, or like he felt his own magic. He felt the shift clawing at him. It felt like the wolf was lurking right under the surface of his skin, and it just added to his sense of unease.
“No, even better. It’s Harry Potter.”
“Oh. Is that so? You… You think
weird, even by Harry’s standards. He nodded slowly, taking another step closer. “Okay. Alright. I can take it off.” The look that Draco shot him was somewhere between hopeful and so distrusting. That dragon had really been him the whole time? Draco didn’t turn around, he remained facing Harry, which meant Harry would have to put his arms around Draco’s neck to get the collar off of him. Right.
"Which room is Mimsy be putting Mistress' things?"
Yours,
“It’s perfectly alright, Harry. You two weren’t right for each other. She told me so. She decided she loved you more as a brother.” A small smile formed, and Harry nodded. That sounded a lot more realistic, a better description of their relationship.
Bloody hell, Draco, we're partners! We're supposed to have each other's backs. What the hell am I supposed to say to Robards? You disappeared with a fresh werewolf gash, and St. Mungo's hasn't reported that you've been in… Yes, I specifically asked them to. I’ve been in contact with your mother, too, and you haven’t been to see her either.
As everyone looked towards him, the conversation seemed to pause before everyone seemed to talk at once and his eyes widened as he leaned away. What… exactly
Harry took a few steps towards the dragon, which took only one step back, wings spread to look big and menacing. It was growling, its sharp teeth on full display and smoke tendrils rising from its nose. It was textbook defensive behavior… but Harry had to get the collar on.
“A little of both, I suppose. They’re… incredibly crass.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, surprised. “Why didn't you tell me?”
Thankfully, it seemed Draco didn’t much have to worry about meeting many other ‘family’ as they seemed to be out of town. Of course, dinner and dessert didn’t let Gwen forget what she’d told him earlier. Cake and dessert wine all consumed, Draco suddenly realized that he wouldn’t be leaving with everyone else that night. He’d return to the hotel in the morning to gather his things and check out… to move into his great-aunt’s spare room. Unable to help it, Draco found himself fidgeting, hearing his father’s voice in his head telling him it was most undignified, but not finding it within himself to care much. This was all a bit much. That, and imagining his father made him think of what he’d do if he ever found out about his rogue, casual army of cousins. Maybe he’d die of a heart attack. Or a stroke. “Draco, dear? Are you alright?”
Harry mine,
“I do, yes.” Luna spoke with that same cool, serene tone and fuck if that didn't creep him out. Harry gaped like a fish for a solid two seconds before he spluttered and squeezed her shoulders.
“I simply wanted to know why you attacked my friend, Charlie.” At the sound of Charlie’s name, the dragon snorted, and Harry was once again taken aback. The expression on the dragon’s face was just so human. “He’s a pretty nice guy, ya know?”
"I know, dear. Draco has always had an inclination for elaborate and fanciful exaggeration." He did, didn't he? It seemed like Draco just loved to blow everything out of proportion. He had to wonder why that was.
At the sight of his only son lying dead on the cot, Lucius Malfoy went cold. He fell to his knees as his wife-- his lovely wife-- screamed and ran to the body. She clutched him close, laying over his body, cradling her son's pale face in her hands. She sobbed, every inch the broken woman she had become over the past year… but this was the last straw.
She nodded. "Very well. Have you already begun with the mandrake leaf?" He presented her with the leaf, a sheepish look on his face.
before he sent it.]]
“It is, a bit. She knows he’d come to Grimmauld first, when he eventually comes back, so she wanted to be there too. And I guess… we’re both a bit lonely without him. And I don’t like the thought of her alone in that huge house. Besides, we get on pretty well.”
"Right, okay," he said, fingering the leaf gently. "What do I need to know?"
Albus Dumbledore does what he does best, which is control his precious chess pieces.
"Then it's yours," she told him, before walking back to lock the case she'd gotten it from.
Above everything, Draco just wanted to go home.
It sounded like a beast out of a faerie tale. It sounded even more ferocious than the nesting Horntail he'd faced as a teenager.
him. “That just means it was working.”
“No. Dramatic bastard that he is, he’s fled the bloody country,” Harry raged, hands curling into fists. “He’s terrified we’re going to track him down and force him to register and everything he’s worked for will be for nothing.”
And about limits and things… I don't want to hurt you. Like, spanking is one thing, but actually causing you harm, I wouldn't like that. And I wouldn't like you to hurt me either, if you know what I mean? Um… no darkness, so no blindfolds, and probably no ropes… That's all I can think of right now. I wonder if Hermione has any books on BDSM. I wouldn't put it past her.
What did she know, this- This little-
Yours,
“First year.
-Harry J Potter is a graduate of Hogwarts, a boarding school in Scotland
“Wait, no, don’t do that— you might hurt yourself”— But the dragon silenced him with a blast of hot air from his snout and a growl that originated in his belly, as if to say
He had work to do.
"If you're sure this is what you want, Harry, we'll stand with you."
You plan to have me wear one every day, then? Take me around town and show it off around my neck so everyone knows who I belong to? That’s what you’re looking for? Color me intrigued.
"Talk to him, hm? He probably felt like he pushed you too far, or that he read your signals wrong." Remy offered him a kind smile.
We will be going with option 3, as that seemed to be the fan favorite.
"He might not be here in August, Val--"
Have you ever thought about how none of the professors ever seemed to have children of their own?
Keeping Up With the Malfoys returns!
"Yeah um, it's been a bit of a long time coming, hasn't it?" He shrugged a bit. "Anyways, Neville… can I ask you for a favor?"
The corridors were all blessedly empty, the students all in their afternoon classes. Minerva lead them to the Headmaster's office. The stone gryphon leapt away from the entryway, but Minerva stopped them.
“Exactly, dear. Why should anyone suspect the matron?”
It’s adorable.
“And where are you off to?”
“You know, I always have to pick up the slack for him? He
to say of his mother. Harry bit back a rather rude reply and sighed.
I can definitely feel you rolling your eyes at me. It's such a familiar gesture of yours, I'm surprised those gorgeous eyes haven't rolled right out of your head! And I'll definitely be pleased with another photo or 20. I'll endeavor to be less of a tease… it only seems to bite me in the ass in the long run. (But if you'd like to bite me, I wouldn't turn you down, love.)
All that, and there was an owl at his window, trying to wake him to be let inside. Draco groaned, stretching his limbs out as he fumbled with the latch, allowing the thing inside. “Alright, then, hand it over. It stuck its leg out towards him and hooted softly. With the letter freed, the bird hopped over to where Draco had set out some water and owl treats. That's when he recognized the owl and the handwriting as Blaise's.
-also he's bi as hell
He thought of bringing a bottle of wine, but decided against it. He checked his pocket watch and approached his fireplace for a bit of Floo powder. He tossed it into the fire and spoke clearly-- "Malfoy Manor"-- before he stepped through. He arrived in the entrance hall just as the grandfather clock rang for seven pm.
"Weird," Neville commented as he stood. "Visiting, or do you need something?"
"We have Sundays at mine, darling. Feel free to dress comfortably, it isn't anything out of the ordinary. Yule, however, now
“She is a touch infamous, yes. Exceedingly beautiful, astonishingly wealthy—“
by ‘she knew everything?’ Did she know…? Did she know about the ill-fated almost-date a year and a half ago..?
He was probably going to have to lie to the Ministry and tell them that he hadn’t been able to find the dragon. He needed to go back to that town and ask more about that myth. But most important right now, he needed to take care of Draco. Reaching around him, his fingers slid against the clasp and, with a small amount of difficulty, he released it and held the collar in his hands, bringing it away from Draco’s neck. “Stand back,” Draco told him, his voice soft as the very air around him seemed to ripple.
They had the locket now. Though they had escaped the cave and the army of infiri relatively unharmed, Harry was shaken. The potion, the pale hands, the freezing water-- Dumbledore Apperated them back to the top of the Astronomy Tower, and they were safe. Dumbledore ordered Harry to head to bed but once the boy was downstairs and in the shadows, he found himself frozen, unable to move or make a sound. Dumbledore cast a quick Notice-Me-Not spell over Harry as thundering footsteps rang out from the staircase.
I am curious, do you think your animagus form may, itself, be a wolf? There seems some strange sort of irony in that. Though I must say — I do like the idea of that. All of me likes that idea.
It seemed like a relatively simple process. Every book, journal, or leaflet always started the same way: a Mandrake leaf, kept in one's mouth, for a full month. There were some differences, of course. Some argued that the leaf must be kept under the tongue, while others said just in one's mouth is fine. Others debated on the time frame-- how long? Did the moon cycle have anything to do with it? 28 days or 31? And what age of Mandrake needed to provide the leaf?
All that being said, it isn’t my fault that we aren’t together…
He found himself exiting Luna's Floo and entering in through the Burrow's. He wondered if it was just Molly and Arthur in the house. He didn't need anyone else getting nosy. Molly’s voice came from round the corner. “Yes? Who is it?”
With the letter, Draco had also been sent two bars of Honeydukes Reserve 90% Dark Chocolate. Yes, he’d gotten himself chocolate earlier that day, but… But it hadn’t been chocolate from home. The dark purple and bronze foil Honeydukes packaging brought back quite a few happy Hogwarts memories, and the pureness of the cocoa would better aid his magic and soothe the wolf.
The Crowlins didn't have a huge manor house like the Malfoys did, though it did seem like a large country house. There were no Muggles for miles, another thing to be glad of. Draco made sure no one but he and Harry could Apparate from the grounds, to prevent any escapes, and Harry got a sense of the surrounding area.
I can’t believe you’re saying that the improved hearing was the best part of it all. I have to disagree completely, that was probably the worst part of it all. It felt like everything was scraping against my ears, or droning into my skull. But… I do like the improved sense of smell. Unfortunately, around the new moon, my senses are most ‘human’ as well. I do understand, though. It’s hard to explain it, isn’t it? It feels like it’s something much more… primal. Like we shouldn’t be able to explain it in any human terms. Like it just is.
“In the kitchen, Harry!” Ah, how was he not surprised? The two of them spent more time in the kitchen nowadays than any other room in the house, Harry suspected. They were both still in pajamas and bathrobes, tea and the beginnings of a glorious brunch spread out over the table. Hermione sighed, looking to him. “Tell Ronald he’s being ridiculous and that I don’t have to eat if I don’t feel hungry.”
The dragon caught sight of the collar, and the second he did, he was leaping and bounding away as best he could. Hell, this was going to be like Hermione trying to give Crookshanks a bath, wasn’t it? “Hey,” Harry said as firmly as he could, holding the collar out. “I need to get this collar on you, alright? The Ministry is going to start worrying. You’re an untagged dragon that no one knows anything about, don’t you think that’s a little too dangerous for people to just let you run around unchecked? Didn’t you see the poor trees you murdered on your landing in here?”
A scheme is hatched...
“Mmm, yes, Draco mentioned you lived with your aunt and uncle.” Her tone had changed, back to the hard and cold way he’d heard her talk when they’d first met several years ago. “What was Dumbledore's excuse for putting you with them, again?”
me. He just started attacking. I didn’t have a chance. Surprised he didn’t kill me, though. He definitely had the chance.”
magic. I could be wrong."
Teddy's seen me transform, now, and at first thought I was a huge, huge puppy. Your mum and Andy had a big laugh over that one. I'm glad he's not frightened of me, I was startled the first time I saw Padfoot. I thought he was a Grim. Plans have been set for Teddy to stay with us at Grimmauld for the moon. (I assume this will be the last moon you and I spend apart.) I've asked him if he'd like to stay at Grimmauld with us, and he's agreed, on the condition that we paint his room 'fun colors'. I haven't asked him to specify yet.
Having a baby. A baby. Baby. Their baby. He was going to be a father? They were going to be parents? Thinking this, he'd accidentally tuned Harry out
“Since always, I think. But I found out in primary when this girl offered me one. Yeah, I get all… blotchy and red? And my mouth itches and my tongue swells. Spent the rest of the day in the nurse’s office, after she gave me a few epinephrine pills. Not had a strawberry since.”
Draco knew three things.
Oh, his mother… Draco tucked the letter close, sitting it in his breast pocket. She was, of course, far too good for him. Still, he couldn’t force his suffering on her. He would have to mail her after dinner.
Harry hugged her back, and now he was definitely crying. Again. Why did she keep doing this to him? “Thanks.” She pressed a kiss to the top of his head and he had to close his eyes for a minute. He’d been emotional Ike this since she’d arrived in his Floo that morning a few weeks ago. He definitely knew why Draco was such a mummy’s boy, first hand. It did make Harry wonder, if he and his parents had all lived in the regular Wizarding World, if he would have been the same.
“But I’m gonna have to deal with Harry talking about him more than he already does, and he’ll probably start bringing him round for dinner with the family-”
-also he's bi as hell
If you were here, Draco… I'd take care to get your collar on you, make sure it fits nicely but doesn't choke you. I'd make sure the desk wouldn't hurt your knees, and I'd have you kneel on top of it. If you were good, I'd reward you. And if you were naughty, I'd spank you until your arse glows pink. I'd take my time, because you're a gift meant to be savoured. I'd touch you all over, slow and steady. You'd call me a tease, and that would get you another little spank. I can imagine your little gasps already, baby.
Sitting on his bed, Auntie Gwen continued to smooth his fur back. “It’s alright, dear. I’ll stay until the morning, if you’ll have me.” He nuzzled more into her hands and whined softly. The ache inside was still there, but at least he wasn’t alone anymore. He could survive the night like this.
Harry,
Draco rose an eyebrow, taking a curious sip before looking like he was trying not to spit it back out. “You don’t happen to have any sugar, by chance, do you?”
"Keeping my focus, mostly. You're quite good at that." Harry took a few small sips of his tea, looking at her over the rim of the cup. "Having focus and accomplishing things."
Meanwhile, I have to add that Minerva is thrilled we're seriously considering her offer. She might've mentioned the positive potential of the heads of Gryffindor and Slytherin in a romantic relationship. How she figured us out, I'll never know. She's also requested you start to think of her as Minerva as well. (I think she's already decided we'll soon be part of the staff. That's fine by me, I hope it is with you!)
"Shit-!" A handful had reached him and tangled their little hands up in his hair before Narcissa froze them once more, and Harry grumbled to himself as he tried to detangle them.
time away?” How long do I have to go without his voice in my ear and his company? “He doesn’t say where in France, does he?”
