His last order from the dark lord was to get close to Dumbledore, and his master had never once revealed or even hinted he was possessing Quirrell at all the entire year to him.

There was an intensity behind that question that Harry failed to get, but at least he was familiar with that term now. The boy was… weird, but getting his robes and definitely his age so he was probably going to be a classmate. Harry had never really talked to kids his age as they all hated him because of Dudley so… in the spirit of how well this day had been going he decided, what could a conversation hurt?
So he woke up late, whatever.
Apparently, it also didn’t work like a debit card either: it copied the memory of the muggle salesperson holding it, recording the price of whatever Harry was buying, and stored it. It’d be sent to Gringotts who would make note of the memory to determine the location of the store and the number of galleons needing to be transferred into muggle money, and apparently they had

be doing in this class. Transfiguration was apparently second to only Potions in being the most dangerous magical subject to learn, and a few graphic horror stories later Harry was pretty convinced. When one could turn the air in your lungs into needles, or the blood in your veins to ink, you learned to be careful.

“If anyone deserves it, Harry, it would be you.” Kingsley picks up the folder again and holds it out. “Ask Hermione or Ron. They would say the same; anyone would say the same.”
“Ron doesn’t quite understand why, but… he’s not as opposed as he was before.”
“It’s probably Nixon,” he says, taking the letter and sitting down beside her. When he doesn’t go to open it, she looks away.
He wakes up at daybreak, panting in his sweat encrusted sheets with a vibration just beneath his skin. It crawls in his bones like a burrowing terminate; he twitches, body jolting up into an arch from his magic pulling him forward.
He ends up letting them dangle by his sides at her murderous look.
Why did they need his presence for a bloody marriage law? Harry freezes, toast in fact falling from his teeth at the horror mounting his heart.
Harry thinks he might just throw up.
Ron sees him come in and waves him over using his wooden mug. “Didn’t know if you’d make it.” Harry nods and perches on a stool placed in front of the other. “Hope you don’t mind.”
“I just don’t understand, Harry,” Hermione had said, her face pinched through the Floo system. She hadn’t been able to meet him in person, yet he never received a reason as to why.
his friends. Aching for reasons he didn’t know why and trying to stop the churning in his stomach.
They could take away Malfoy's money, Harry thought, staring at the desolate boy, but they shouldn’t take away his existence. It was too harsh, in spite his ties to Voldemort’s rising, because Harry had seen his hysteria in that bathroom and he had ripped it apart.
Never had he recalled seeing his flowers and shrubs the summer after; he’d filled his memory with the Mirror of Erised and Ron and Hermione and Hogwarts. He couldn’t remember the garden, the beautiful garden of Delphiniums and Sweet Peas, all of it replaced by artificial hydrangeas and fake roses.
“Firewhiskey,” Ron sips his own alcohol without trouble. “Figured we’d need it.”
wanted to apologize for my actions. I was—hurt,” she corrected. “I’m sorry, Harry. I was hurt and angry that you’d chosen—that it felt that you had chosen Malfoy over us.”
Someday they’d do something Harry knew and Malfoy didn’t, and he’d be excited. There were a narrow number of things that Malfoy wasn’t confident in, and Harry needed to outright take advantage of them.
“She told you then?” he sighs, setting down his utensils and giving them his full attention.
Harry decides that Ministry paper burns the best out of every paper—better than the interview letters, better than his friend’s jittery handwriting, the fan mail, the Prophet.
he thinks, looking to the fireplace mantle where a picture featuring him, Ron, and Hermione stays.
“Shit, shit,” he added for good measure. He was certain that he made quite the sight sliding down the corridors in his shiny pointed leather shoes.
There was no point in putting the tent up, as the clouds were gone and the sun was out. It was a blessing, coming from the howling storms and the murky grey clouds to this.
“But someone should be allowed to do the dares no one wants to do,” Turpin argues, persistent in her ability to make Malfoy take off her short blue mini skirt or her white three hour shirt.
Headaches were inevitable.
“And you think we should go?” Harry questioned. The bread rolls were just as fluffy; a buttery goodness that hadn’t known he’d missed.
“Quidditch is my life, and if I can’t even play it, then what’s the point?” She bites her lip, looking off into the distance at the sight of Mrs. Weasley sobbing into her husband's chest.
“If you cannot uphold the courts rules, you are hereby dismissed.” He flicked his wand, and bodies went tumbling out the door. Harry was pulled forward just as the door slammed shut.
“Yes, Granger, drinking games,” Parkinson’s red nails reflected on the Room of Requirements conjured lights when she tapped them on the table. The lights glimmered like a burning fire, though there was one near that lit up the multicolored chairs and seats. Parkinson’s was a black leather, Harry’s a soft, cushiony red, etc. It was comfortable enough—especially with the pale white walls and the dark brown rugs.
He couldn’t feel comfortable in the Burrow. It didn’t seem like home anymore; he hadn’t missed this sorrow.
Biting his lips, he shifts. “Have you seen Ron and Hermione?” Moments pass until she decides to reply to him.
Today, it seemed, he was making a trip to the Ministry.
He nearly missed the chamber—
“I don’t think he wants to talk to me,” He responds, after he stares at him, imploring him to change his mind. “There’s no… regret, Hermione. I don’t regret what I did, but I still feel so horrible about it.”
“I’m certain whatever you pick will be fine,” she soothes, informing him like a mother that needed to calm her child down. “But, remember, you don’t have to play if you don’t want to.” Harry begins to feel the hard weight of the game on him. It was entertaining, truly, it was, but it was also there to learn everything about everyone.
want you to take it.”
There were cameras flashing and a quiet murmur slipping from the double doorway cracks. He doubted his face wouldn’t be in every magazine or newspaper for the coming days.
His eyes pierce her forehead. She continues pouring in the batch, slapping the pudding-like substance with a wooden spoon. “‘Sides. I’ll be incredibly sad if you don’t. My feelings would be hurt. I would—!”
“I didn’t think you could even put Malfoy and shy in a sentence!” It’s sad that Seamus looks awed and mystified.
Ron whips around mid-yell to look at him. “Wha..?”
Harry takes it, and says, “Thank you.” He notices a commotion of whispering and yelling coming from outside. At the shop doors, workers are pushing reporters away, but their tenacious and armed with quills and cameras.
Trulock diffused the Memory Room, and, while he and the Wizenmagot scurried off to discuss Malfoy’s circumstances, they were placed back into the stuffy chambers. Stuffy, because there were heated glares warming his neck.
She doesn’t respond, instead shrugging her shoulders and leaning her head on his. Ginny closes her eyes. “You should still read the letter. I don’t trust Nixon as far as I can throw him.”
The clouds overtake the sun, a dark shade of black falling over their faces. Ginny holds her hands over her head, awaiting the furious pelts of rain that were about to spill from the sky. Hermione’s wand hand moves at a rapid pace, and just as the first rain—
“We apologize for the inconvenience—!”
Blaise as his? He filed the thought away for later discussion and smiled contentedly when he found his dinner under a stasis charm on the kitchen table.
Harry keened as he was pulled closer, his own hands moving up to Blaise’s shoulders to push the soft cotton of his shirt off his shoulders, letting it drop to the floor. He could hear Draco’s gasp when his hands trailed down Blaise’s chest but tried to keep his focus solely on Blaise. He’d take care of Draco after.
“I suppose I am,” he replied.
Finally, Harry was fully seated on Blaise’s cock, his jaw dropped in ecstasy and his eyes glassy from what Draco could see. Blaise moaned and his hips twitched, thrusting up the tiniest bit and Draco’s hips involuntarily did the same, thrusting up in thin air as his erection rubbed against the rough fabric of his trousers. He bit back a moan as he watched how Harry started to move. At first it was just circling his hips, but from the way Blaise’s mouth produced only gasps and moans and small encouragements, Draco was quite sure it felt good. Before long, he leaned forward on his hands, pushing his hips up and letting himself drop down again. From where Draco sat, he could see Blaise’s cock slide in and out of Harry’s arse, and he could imagine perfectly how Harry’s rim would flutter around it with every move.
Harry sighed and let himself fall on the bed next to Draco, twisting his head to look at him.
“Fuck, Harry, I’m -” croaked Blaise, his words cut off by a deep, long moan when Harry emphasised his movements.
His eyes were trained on Harry’s arse when he sat up on his knees and shuffled backwards, hand coming up behind him to grab Blaise’s cock. He could hear their combined gasps when he moved down, the head breaching his entrance and couldn’t help moaning along with them. Harry didn’t even notice, he seemed to be completely out of it, but Blaise threw him a quick glance, smirking at how affected he was. He didn’t get much time to think about it though, because Harry sank further down over his cock and Draco guessed all his attention was needed to prevent a premature ending of their adventure. His time to smirk. Harry moved up and down in small increments, moving down a little further every time after pulling up a tiny bit. Draco knew how that felt, knew how Harry would be clenching down on Blaise’s cock, how his hands would press into his chest as his breathing quickened. He knew it felt awesome, and right now he was discovering that it looked just as good.
Harry chuckled. “We had some last month when you were in New York, and Draco said it reminded him of us. You’d be the chocolate, he’s the vanilla and I’m the peanut butter,” he explained, rolling his eyes at the memory of Draco’s elaborate musings over too much whiskey and a pint of ice cream. “So no, there’s definitely not a girl missing in this one if you ask me.”
“Draco,” Harry said, a little irritated now.
It took another minute or so before Blaise’s first finger was completely inside, and then he quickly followed it up with a second finger. He went faster on this one, Draco also adjusting quicker now that he was more relaxed and soon enough Blaise was scissoring his fingers, stretching Draco easily.
Harry gaped at him.
“Yes you are,” Draco chimed in as he walked in from the sitting room. “Which is why I will find a pint of Ben & Jerry's when I open the freezer door.”
“Come here,” he said. He waited until Harry pulled off and then shuffled backwards, reaching his hand out for Harry to take and follow him onto the bed.
Lifting the charm, he inhaled the scent of Blaise’s Italian ragout. His mouth watered at the thought of getting to eat it soon while he hummed as he put away the groceries he’d bought on his way home.
Draco stirred a few minutes later, pulling a face when Harry slipped out of him and turned around, apparently having fallen asleep.
He sent the piles up to their bedroom with a quick flick of his wrist and fished his phone out of his pocket. Blaise had even managed to convince Draco of the convenience of muggle phones, which was quite an accomplishment. He pulled up their WhatsAppgroup and thought for a second before typing out a message.
Harry’s eyes widened and he could feel a flush rising to his cheeks. He had a tendency to blush, but his dark skin usually hid it pretty well. Draco always noticed, but only because he was skilled at it after 7 years together.
“Should I prep you?” Draco heard Blaise ask but Harry shook his head and murmured a wandless preparation and lubrication spell, shivering when they took effect. Usually Harry liked being fingered open, slowly and thoroughly, but tonight he was obviously too impatient to take that road. Draco could relate.
He pressed the heel of his hand into his hard-on straining against the zipper of his jeans and felt his arse clench around thin air.
"You should fuck Blaise," he said then, right when Harry's movements stilled and his jaw dropped as his climax surged through him.
Harry looked down at his plaid shirt and rolled his eyes before looking at Draco again.
Harry couldn’t keep up his serious face as he looked at Blaise who was supposedly playing helpless boyfriend. “Well, pretty boy, your boyfriend looks a bit like a big, tall tree, doesn’t he? Have you gotten confused?”
“He forgot their anniversary?” Draco asked, looking up from the paper. “Tsssk, rookie mistake.”
“Yeah, me too,” Harry breathed, and Draco could tell he was almost there. If he managed to stave off his orgasm until Blaise came, it would be his come shooting against his walls that pushed him over the edge. “It’s okay,” he added.
Blaise laid back as he watched the interaction between Draco and Harry, smiling in what he hoped was a seductive or at least comforting way when Draco glanced over at him. Whatever his smile looked like, it appeared to work, because Draco pushed himself up out of the armchair, adjusted himself in his trousers and ran a hand through his hair. As Draco approached the bed, Blaise twisted his body upright and joined the other two men.
He’d had a perfect view of Harry’s blowjob earlier, but this part promised to be even better. Blaise laid back onto the millions of pillows Harry always insisted they kept on their bed and pulled Harry along until he straddled his hips. Draco could see how Harry’s tongue flicked out when he leaned down to kiss Blaise, and how Blaise met it with his own. Their moans filled the room and honestly Draco wasn’t so sure about his promise not to touch himself. At this rate he would explode before either of them came.
Draco glared at him, and Harry had only just enough time to turn off the fire and put the risotto under a stasis charm before bolting towards the hallway door and upstairs to their bedroom, Draco hot on his heels. Blaise followed after them at a more languid pace, ready to help them kiss and make up, balancing them out more perfectly than Harry could've ever dreamed of.
"Ah! Yes!" Draco moaned, gripping his knees to pull them up a tiny bit higher as Harry moved his hips again, thrusting deep into him.
He could see how Harry swallowed and smiled dirtily.
Harry nodded and attempted a smile as he let out a deep breath. “Yeah, just… just nervous.”
“How was your day?” Blaise murmured, gently starting to massage Harry’s shoulders while he ate.
Harry had almost forgotten about it all when Draco brought it up again. It had been two months since that conversation and honestly Harry had already mentally filed it with Draco’s other crazy plans.
Harry grinned guiltily as he turned around, hiding the evidence behind the freezer door. “Yes, but blame Draco. He texted me the shopping list while he knew I’d be working late.”
Blaise gave a single pointed upwards thrust with his hips and groaned when he came, his abs flexing underneath Harry.
Harry shrugged and sat down behind his plate. “I knew this would be waiting for me at home,” he smiled, leaning his head back when Blaise put his hands on his shoulders and leaned down for a kiss.
Harry took a deep breath as the doorknob to the kitchen turned, squeezing his eyes shut for a second as he tried to suppress the butterflies in his stomach.
“Good, because that means you know the area around here, and me and my boyfriend here, lost our way in this big, big forest. All the trees look the same, could you help us, sir?”
“I hate you,” Harry grumbled, but his smile betrayed him. “At least get three spoons so we can share.” He got up, cleaning his plate and sending it back into the top cabinet with a flick of his hand, smirking when he saw how Blaise’s eyes darkened at his display of wandless magic.
Harry looked up through his eyelashes as he pulled off with a slurp, a string of saliva connecting his lips with Blaise’s erection.
Draco shifted in his seat, smiling when he saw the exact moment that Harry realised he was still wearing his trousers and pants, and then biting his lip when he got rid of them.
Blaise followed soon after, the sight combined with the sensation too much to withstand.
“Leave that to me,” Draco winked, moving his body down the bed and putting Harry’s knees over his shoulders. “I’ll take care of you.”
“Hey,” Draco said, suddenly crowding him against the edge of their kitchen table. “You alright?”
“Yeah, c’mon, I’m ready,” Draco slurred finally, wiggling his hips. Blaise pulled out and allowed Harry to shift himself into position to push into Draco. His leg came up over Draco’s hip and Blaise gripped the back of his thigh, pulling the three of them even closer together, and judging from Draco’s loud moan, it had been a good idea. Laying his head down to face Draco, he leaned in for a kiss, feeling him move with every single one of Harry’s thrusts.
Blaise gasped when he finally closed his lips around the head, pushing the foreskin back so he could suck properly on the head. He relaxed his jaw before taking more of his cock into his mouth and moaned again when Blaise’s fists tightened in his hair, earning him a groan and a twitch of his hips.
Harry snickered as he turned down the heat under the risotto and walked closer to Blaise, wrapping his arms around his neck and leaning his head back for a kiss. “No, you’re a big, tall man, but we still like to climb you,” he joked, throwing him a wink.
Draco moved back slowly so that Harry could get up again, and they all maneuvered themselves into the middle of the bed. Draco was in the middle, Harry plastered to his back and Blaise moulded to his front as he kissed Harry over Draco’s shoulder. Draco’s hips moved back and forth, apparently unable to decide if he wanted to feel Harry’s erection against his arse or the friction of his and Blaise’s cock against each other.
“We should take this upstairs,” he told Blaise with a small smirk. “Or Draco is going to be pissed.”
Lemons had taken residence inside Hermione’s clenched lips, her displeasure visible but pointless at Mrs. Weasley’s insistence.
The wands continued to rise at an overwhelming mass, and the woman tapped her wand onto a wrinkled book. “Those not in favor of Draco Malfoy receiving the Dementor’s Kiss please raise your wands.”
He shifted up so that he could reach for the box sitting in the middle of their half-assed circle. “Dare.”
Two: He was bloody late.
He showed up with a disreputable purple bruise on his cheek the next day. Vernon told him that it was real art, and his teacher never mentioned it again. Nonetheless, up until Hogwarts, his cupboard was littered by the very drawings he‘d been forbidden to draw.
“Party games,” Dean corrected, earning an excited look from Seamus who’d failed at expressing his thoughts.
The scribbles in the second sentence weren’t as hurried and sloppy as the first, and was, without a doubt, the delicate scribble of Hermione’s handwriting. Harry had no clue as to what Ron was talking about though.
“I don’t,” she whispers. “I don’t think I’m capable of doing this, Harry. I know—I know that you’re afraid, but so am I. You cannot lock yourself out from the world when I’m a part of it.”
Hermione shakes her head. “
Shuffling. “The Wizamagot wishes to speak with you, sir.”
He wished they’d let him talk to her about this, but the idea was vetoed at the thought that he’d crumble from looking at her.
He hadn’t been expecting the company, if he were being honest. In his mind, Hermione and Ron’s absence meant that, in a non-confrontational way, they didn’t want his friendship anymore. He was trying not to mind, and it wouldn’t work
Even if his eyes were closed, he could see the envious eyes, the sad eyes; the green glowing eyes that haunted his mirrors.
“It has its risks, of course,” she rushes to continue when he begins shaking his head ‘no’. “But all plans aren’t full proof, and—!”
Trulock’s hand swayed, and the courtroom disappeared. “We are now inside the Memory Room.”
He does end up having to spit out his cake from how close he was to choking on it.
“D'you think that’s why they pushed back the age deadline?” Ron mused, “It only passed Gin’s birthday by the skin of its teeth.”
“Yes, I’m quite sure he did, dear,” she brushed her fingers against her apron, watching him flounder for words in jovial bemusement. “Is there a reason why you’re taking up space in my kitchen? Make no mistake, I’m happy for the company,” she includes. “However unexpected it may be.”
Her lips twitched, not acknowledging him with a verbal response, but he practically preened at the response.
Which wasn’t so bad. Leaving out the bit where seventeen—
Later, when Trulock had spelled all prior residents outside because their commotion refused to stop, they heard the full extent to Malfoy’s charges. His magic would be stripped from him for a year, and he would remain in the Auror’s jails until he paid his bail and his fine.
“No,” she sunk back into the sofa, a frazzled look in her eye.
Whenever he asked her about it, she’d recount how her parents sent it to her after her short trip to Australia and nothing more.
Harry closes the door behind him, and Kingsley whirls his wand to move a few stacks of papers over so they are visible to one another. “Why did you call me here, Kingsley?”
“Then why?” He looked down at the papers; she shook her head and sighed. “Was it because—?”
He thinks Malfoy has caught on at this point because stiffens, defensive sneer melting away into subtle bafflement when Parkinson says her Never Have I Ever. Harry’s in the middle of unwrapping his candy with several others, and Malfoy, when he sees him lean over and whisper something in her ear. They’re having a heated conversation, but Harry’s attention is snatched when Ron nudges him with a laugh.
“They’ve no right to just order you about!” His jaw ticked, and she carried on, raging through the pages of the Ministry’s annual volumes that featured their laws and protocols. “It’s not right!”
Acken gets a disgusted expression on his face. “What’re you, then, a pervert or something?”
Harry then understood at that moment why everyone had taken the minute to laugh at him. His sense of libido hadn’t caught up with the situation—everyone else’s had. He was making nice with the game instead of dirtying it.

Hermione nods, “And you did. She won’t have to be married—she'll never have to have carried a child by the end of her schooling.” She looked him in the eye. “But
“Did what, Weasley?” She tilts her head, a picture of innocence. “You shouldn’t hold up the game—Neville’s got an interesting one planned for us after Harry’s turn.”
Another pause while Ron focuses on his food, spoon scraping on his bare plate in high-pitched squeals. A blaring stamp sounds through the room, giving way to Ron’s rough inhale and garbled agreement.
Harry’s grip on the paper tightened—why were they deciding Ginny’s fate without her permission or... or even her presence? It shouldn’t have been possible, because they were allowed to find their own partners.
“I was called here to speak with you?” When they stayed silent, his frustration increased.

Draco scoffed, “He never fucked me.” If Harry weren’t near-shaking, he could only imagine the eye roll Draco would’ve gotten from him. “And I thought it’d be rather obvious—you’ve even said it yourself.”
It makes a large part of him gratified with horror.
“You will,” she tells him, pouring the batch into the buttered down oven pan Harry had taken the time to pull out. “I went to muggle Tesci’s to get this cake mix.”
The lift shot through the building, forgetting Harry’s stomach and colon in its haste to arrive at its destination in less than five seconds. How Author and Percy did this daily, he would never know.
He ends up telling Hermione about his encounter. She doesn’t find the story as funny as he does, but she seems amused by his amusement.
There’s a kind of fondness that Harry can’t transfer back in Hermione’s expression. It crumbles when Ron’s loud voice sounds over her shoulders. “Sex, Harry! It means sex!” His face colours faster than the speed at which Hermione clips Ron in the chest.
The frown on his face darkened, and he threw himself onto the bed tucked neatly in the corner of the room. He wondered if Mrs. Weasley would still speak to him if he hadn’t chosen Ginny.
It was still noon, he yawned to himself. It wasn’t a problem. He wasn’t receiving any guests.
A woman seated by the crowd holding an empty position vial in her left and an ice pack to her head in her right sneered in their direction.
Harry blanches. “There’s no way I’m eating this, Gin.”
“There is one thing I couldn’t quite understand,” he hums, reaching for the bronze dessert platter that a begrudged Kreacher had to bring out. He could hear him in the corner with his mutterings of ‘mudblood’ and ‘blood traitors’. “Why was he glowing?”
“They’ve set back the age requirement,” she said. “It was the 17th, but then they knocked it down the 10th this morning right under our bloody noses.”
He thumbed the crumpled paper.
“Then what are you saying?” The dusty clock on the dining room wall ticks away the seconds it takes them to respond. At their silence, he leans back and sighs long and hard. “I just wanted to help her.”
“Naturally, the papers were a simple symbol of your dispensation and
Harry’s heart stops. “No, no, I have a godson!”
Harry then attempted to floo directly into Kingsley’s private office, but was spat back out into the Auror Department.
Majority of the time, though, he had his face in Harry’s neck. Harry, in his personal opinion, thought that if he was touch-deprived, then Malfoy had to be the complete opposite. Always touching; feeling; grabbing.
“...accused of several accounts of alleged first degree murder, aiding and abetting terroristic acts, and Death Eater affiliation.” The Deputy Warlock halted in his reading to glance up over his square framed glasses and stare at Harry.
Hermione’s ecstatic to hear about his and Ron’s apparent reconciliation. It’s a feat she’s been trying to force since the day their fall out happened.
, but he didn’t want to see headlines screaming about his secret love child tomorrow morning.
She throws the books into her bag, and when a crash sounds from the inside, she curses—in her own Hermione way—while reaching so far into the bag it swallows torso. He swallows his own laugh, watching as she struggles to fix the problem lying about inside her bag.
Her shoulders slump. She nods, “Right.”
, I think they’re trying to coerce you into marrying Ginny.”
are the literal exemption,” she points the end of her wand at him, emphasizing the ‘you.’
“This… this is insanity!” Hermione throws down the papers, while Ginny continues to read hers in tight clenched hands. “This can’t be legal!”
edit: just a warning that the next chapter will cover A LOT so it might be a bit bigger than the usual chapter size. it’s coming through much faster than expected now that i’ve taken the time to set an update schedule (amongst other things)
He keeps doing this to her—keeps dragging her down with him in whatever pity party or suicide mission he finds himself running into. She’ll get tired of it one day, he knows this, and there will be no one but himself to blame.
They were sprouts—tips of green hadn’t touched over the soil despite weeks of care. He placed the pot by the window, underneath the light from the lamp he left powered on.
Sometimes Harry hated how puffed up Draco could get, even at times like these. “Because I’m the one who’s fucking him.”
Consus Cockburn, the male, teetered at the insult, leaning up, body hung up onto the tips of his toes to reach her neck and whisper, albeit a poor whisper, “Good one, Lucina.”
Kingsley goes quiet. “They were denied.”
Not in Malfoy’s bed though; not with a warm arm wound around his stomach. Warm, and oh-so (not) pleasurable.
“Malfoy?” It’s horrifying how someone as posh as Malfoy falls so low. Very much horrifying, so much that he’s not allowing himself find it within him to pity him.
In his fifth year, Dumbledore had glided into the chambers and handled the matter at hand in less than an hour. Yet Dumbledore wasn’t here, and he wasn't in his fifth year.
The Atrium was an oddity at the moment too. There were no wizards or witches filling every nook and cranny of the floor. There were no magical creatures mixed in the magical crowd of witches and wizards. There were no politicians, no Auror’s, nothing.
Her hand massages her forearm, and she sighs once more. “He’s not my favourite person, Harry,” she tells him, her voice small and weary. “But that doesn’t mean he deserves to die.”
He tells her he doesn’t know what she’s talking about.
Paris Nixon waited a moment before turning away from them. “You are excused.” Both of them scurried out the door, letting the chambers slam shut and encase them both inside alone.
She jerked her chin up, and, as it came down, a paper flew into her fingers. Then she paused. With twitching lips, her eyes darted to look as Harry as the paper turned to dust on her fingertips.
“Well, too bad Parkinson! Harry’s not gonna..” Ron splutters, his head whirling from the bottle pointing at Harry to Parkinson. He points at her with accusing eyes. “You did that didn’t you!”
The court reporter clears his throat. “The accused is being tried for several accounts of alleged first degree murder, aiding and abetting terroristic acts, and Death Eater affiliation.”
The humming echoes coming from the sleepy streets had lulled him into a half-decent night's rest.
“You can’t know that.” She won’t look at him.
, will you? As of now, Harry and Ginny are considered one of the most influential couples in England.” Ron and Harry looked away from each other in their awkwardness to speed up the conversation.
Nixon hissed, causing Harry to flinch back from the ferocity behind his words. “And you should never do as much as touch the property of another individual who’s blood is superior to yours.”
Hermione opens her mouth to say something, but she’s rushed over. “The School Board has been gracious enough to give you another chance, and I won’t have you wasting it away on some Auror priming.”
Malfoy was not all that accommodating. “Funnily enough, I find myself too inclined to disagree with you, Turpin.” Harry resisted the urge to smile triumphant at the inflated brunette. Yet his resistance meant nothing, the rebellion continuing even with Malfoy’s verbal contrast.
He waits for her finish.
“The letter.” Hermione slid an open notebook in front of him, still staring at him like a puzzle she couldn’t figure out. “The problem is that it all seems legal.”
“That’s right, Teddy. They lived happily ever after…”
He turned to Kingsley’s letter in his other hand.
Teddy got his toy, at least.
Gin throws her shoe at him from the sitting room. “Don’t get all cocky because you’re the Chosen One and all that!”
His feet dragged on the glossy cobblestone street path, quiet without the bustling buyers and locals that lived there. Most of them were doing their best to assist in the physical damage done to the castle.
“On the condition that you accept my terms, it will be mandatory under a magical contract that you follow the Blood Act and give a public announcement of your involvement,” Nixon’s clarifies, his voice, now lifeless and unconcerned, telling him what Hermione had told him beforehand.
At times, however, logic should be thrown out the window so that the heart can take control.
She kicks his hand away with a scowl. “I see this is where appreciation gets me.” Ginny bats away the finger reaching to pinch her. “Nowhere.”
she said. They wanted him to dismantle a three hundred year old bond.
It was like when a tide rose and rose, until it splashed down taking everything with it. To Harry, it was a green monster whipping it’s head and hissing at him, compelling him to take what he wanted and to fuck all of the consequences. He just wanted to grab Malfoy and take
Sometimes, when his knees were to Malfoy’s ribs and his thighs were sliding against his hip bones, Harry felt shy. Sometimes, when Malfoy kissed his neck or slowly rolled his hips, Harry felt shy. Sometimes, when Malfoy told him he loved him to his thighs or to his chest or to his eyes, Harry felt shy.
She shrugged. “I like my cakes moist, not dry.”
case, the Wizenmagot rules the accused clear of the Dementor’s Kiss.”
“You—!”
Parkinson, who looked at the redhead in mirth, a vicious smile proud upon her face. “Well, he could always take a dare from the last player.”
“Never Have I Ever slept with Draco Malfoy,” Parkinson called out, her face pinched and pink and she looked as though she had nothing to lose. “Never Have I Ever been intimate with Draco Malfoy! Never Have I Ever snuck out of my dormitory to see Draco Malfoy! Never Have I Ever—!”
“It’s sensible to consider you the Prime Wizard after having defeated the man to be regarded as the most powerful wizard.” At his sour face, she rushes, “
He disappears as soon as comes, slinking back to whatever corners of Grimmauld he entertains himself at. Harry doesn’t even get the time to thank him like he knows Hermiome would demand he should.
“Kingsley says I don’t need my N.E.W.T.s to start Auror Training,” he tells them. There’s no pause between his words and the sound of Mrs. Weasley’s hands slapping against the table.
Twice had he failed to destroy the disturbance; this had been his third try. Nixon looked disgusted at him, flicking his hand out and shooing him away. “You are discharged.”
He’d started coming inside on the third.
When he saw him looking, his lips twitched as if contemplating on whether to forfeit the smugness and just smile (or sneer—he never knew with this man).
His stomach churned—they would call again soon, she said.
“Harry, I’ve done all of the research that I can do; there’s nothing that can be done,” Hermione remarks, her gaze falling from his face to her hands. “We’ve all accepted that we don’t have much of a chance, and now it’s time for us to accept that you’ve been given a way out of this.”
He opened his mouth, to apologize, to ask her to leave with him, to—
“Alright then,” he agreed, flipping open Harry’s file and pulling out the few papers wedged inside. He didn’t have the time to be surprised at Nixon’s swift willingness before those papers were held out to him.
“No,” Ginny cries, pulling the bowl towards her chest in a protective grip. “We’re baking it. And you’re gonna eat it no matter what it looks like!”
“That still doesn’t make it alright,” Harry’s voice is quiet, the passion behind Nixon’s rivaling his own brimming temper. “You’re treating people like livestock; you’re… you’re breeding them like
Quidditch was a fast-paced sport, far too dangerous for anyone in their pregnancy or postpartum stages. Ginny would never be able to play even if they did get her a spot, because then there would be a child thrown into the situation.
Her glee is shut down by Zabini’s amused murmur. “A simple bell will do, Granger.”
He tried to reason with himself with the fact that Malfoy would never even ‘waste his time with such plebeians’ as he said in close frequents. He knew that although he sat quiet and still—like a good-boy who
Because, Merlin, even when he bloody hated the prick he still would never be able to get his horrible kisses off his mind.
Harry considered,
The seal was darker than any storm that could have been.
“He’s doing alright, Harry. You should…” she hesitates, her frazzled appearance turning anxious in a four lettered sentence. “You should talk to him.”
The leftover courtroom looked over at Harry as one, and everything proved to be just what Harry expected it to be.
She knew, and she hated it. She knew, and every time she saw the two of them together her nostrils would flare. Because Draco didn’t know that she knew.
Nobody finds out until it’s splashed across the Prophet.
Ron was essentially a combusted and confused boy. If Harry listened close, he could hear a stream of, “What the fuck. What bloody fuck is this? Oh, bloody hell.” However, Harry wasn’t listening. His heart was in his ears, and all he could hear was the unsteady thump of his beating heart while Malfoy inched closer.
Consus Cockburn makes a near vote, but when he turns to see Lucina Manning’s wand still settled in her lap he jerks it back down. His eyes race to find Nixon, wondering how he made his choice, but, in the end, he can’t find the man.
Harry caved into the urge by crumbling the papers underneath his fingers. Nixon watch unfazed when Harry threw the balls onto the floor. “Her being a pureblood shouldn’t dictate what choices she has and doesn’t have.”
Suffolk wasn't a place that Harry was familiar with, but the growing wildlife was something that he could take a liking to. His black dress shoes crunched along the dirt path—it was charmed, that he was sure of, to keep the soil on the ground and not on the person.
Harry thought about their exit is how stressful it would be if everyone in Hogwarts were to know what had occurred tonight.
Draco
but he hadn’t accounted for how much Draco and Seamus liked quidditch.
it was as a cloak. It felt like heavy air had settled over his pjs and was neither warm nor cold—it didn't even block airflow so really it was totally useless.
Like,
… so why did he feel like his pride was stinging something awful?
“Are you going to sit with her at breakfast?” Neville wondered, and Harry felt a little bad that after everything Neville had done for him last night and this morning, he

“I think that covers it… but I had some other names I didn’t recognize that you might—does Longsgate or the Eileen Prince Foundation sound familiar?”
Who, was looking very unsurprised to see them, Harry noted. In fact he almost looked gleeful, which was honestly a creepy look on him, more so than usual.

“This is the headmaster’s office. Touch nothing and speak softly—don’t wake the paintings. You must be back in three hours so the Headmaster will not know you were gone.” Snape commanded in a near-silent hiss, almost to the point Harry wondered if he was hearing parseltongue instead, but as he was saying it mostly to Draco and the blond nodded dutifully, he figured not.

trust what was going to come out of his mouth for a second.
Doing whatever the hell he wanted was one thing, accepting the consequences of his actions regardless of what they were was another, and it was honorable.
“I guess.”
Both seemed entirely blank in return, but Mr. Malfoy nodded once curtly while his wife greeted him politely. “Mr. Potter. My understanding is that you would like to shop with Draco; I have other business to attend to so we will meet again here at three.” She explained curtly, getting right to the point with no room for questions in her tone.
“I mean… I suppose I could try. I still don’t know what it is you’re looking for.” Neville seemed totally out of his depth, but Harry leaned into his shoulder playfully and just elbowed his side.
Eventually he calmed down and the droning of Binns’ voice was boring enough to dull his thrill of messing with his underclassmen, the quiet classroom and the lazy scratching of halfhearted note taking around him lulling him into a dreary haze that only History of Magic could put him under.
Harry could only gape at him in shock, before turning to Neville and getting met with an equally out of depth blue gaze.

He felt like a bird noticing itself in a reflection of a lake for the first time, but it was one of life’s simple pleasures, so he just enjoyed himself for a moment.
He was
"I met a couple of his brothers and they were very nice. Ron is… ugh, forget about him, but the whole family doesn't seem that bad to me." He mused delicately, hoping Draco would get the hint.
He was already running before he even realized what his feet were doing, and Draco didn’t really like touching people but he wasn’t exactly paying attention as he looked at something in a shop window—his
He swallowed as quickly as possible and tried not to choke as he wiped his mouth with a napkin.
“Have either of you seen a toad? Neville’s lost one.” The girl announced a bit too loudly, and the boy’s lip quivered.
Draco’s sudden lack of enthusiasm was kind of obvious; now it wasn’t just them wandering the school grounds with the occasional odd look tossed their way from some stray student also exploring the grounds. Weekdays meant the Great Hall was full at mealtimes and the hallways jam packed between classes as people bustled about to get to their next session. Not even mentioning classes themselves where depending on the crowd you were essentially just stuck in a room with people looking at you—and judgmentally or not, it got on your nerves quickly.

He felt even more vain when he realized he had all the time in the world before any of his sleeping roommates would even think about waking up and therefore
Hope was not something he’d had since he was a child. Not since before Lily had been sorted into Gryffindor.
“Neville… dude this is a problem.” They turned at Seamus’ voice behind them, both he and Dean smiling wryly—with a white-clouded Remembrall in his hand.
“Wow, sounds like a charming gal.” Harry raised his brows pointedly.
at the ceiling for all it was worth.

There was no way he could put that into words in a way she’d actually believe or be able to understand why.
Theo thought it was likely because he was openly talking about it to anyone who asked. Rumors got bad when people started making shit up and with no one being able to confirm anything one way or another they tended to spiral—especially amongst children who had poor understandings of what was possible or not in the real world and still had a bit of childhood imagination in them making things worse. With pretty much the entire football club and all second and first years being able to say

the school to know about his ability, he just knew that it eventually would and wanted to get on top of it, and the tall Slytherin had actually done a great job breaking the news as Harry had requested it be done. If Blaise had his own agenda while he was doing this, although it was probably against his better judgement, Harry let it slide.
“Maybe you should come breathe it too, Malfoy. It’ll do you some good to see what a real man breathes like, since, you know, you’re shy in bed.”
He can’t though, and Harry finds he can’t read his paper anymore. The words blur into black lines and blobs, like someone’s gone and snatched his glasses off alongside the reveal of the news.
“Why didn’t you talk to us first?” she ends her speech with her own sigh, dropping into the chair beside him. Kreacher grumbles, but goes to serve them their own plates as well at Harry’s pointed look.
“I have evidence that Malfoy didn’t commit first degree murder,” he says instead. It wasn’t a well-thought out plan, allowing them into his mind, that is. Still, he’d read—skimmed—through Hermione’s Law Enforcement heavy tombs—
The look itself made him want to hide somewhere else in fear of being swallowed up. Because at some point along the line of their relationship, he’d allowed himself to be consumed again He didn’t think he’d ever stop letting Malfoy devour him.
The response is slower this time, because no one in the Wizengamot is as excited to vote for a Death Eater’s survival then they are for their murder. But the first wand raises, and Nixon stares down at Harry with a nod.
“You’re taking your N.E.W.T.s, Ronald,” she orders, pointing her finger at him and taking a no nonsense tone. “And I don’t want to hear another word from your mouth about it!”
Everything he did was futile, because when the night was over, when he limped home with dried come on his back or in between his thighs, he was still feeling. He gave them anything they wanted just to remember something else for one night; even if it was pain or empty pleasure.
Auror’s stopped him wondering when he was going to start his Auror training, it was the definite lesser evil.
“Our newest hatchling is the most beautiful thing—
“Mr. Potter, we had no idea—!”
“Wednesday,” he smiles.
He doesn’t find Ron and Hermione, not in their room or the kitchen or the entire house for that matter.
With her lips pursed, Parkinson glanced at the girl with narrowed eyes. “I’m afraid that such a thing doesn’t go along with the rules, Turpin.”
It had suffocated him then, and each time he’d go circles around the obvious. It hadn’t been his friend that had driven him away, yet it had been a valid factor. It had been the air—the asphyxiation of grief and heartache.
“Harry,” Hermione exhales, the papers of her notebook rustling against her fidgeting hands. “You promised you’d talk.”
An old wizard with a faded brown goatee preached, uplifting the crowd's spirit. Four more voices joined into his chants.
He pocketed his wand, turning away from the vibrating parasite that had attached itself in the heart of the Ministry. Below The Fountain of Magical Brethren was an ever growing magical mass, overtaking the seventh level by the hour.
Parkinson’s dumb party games had a morbid cleverness to them, and Harry was half-anxious and half-disturbed when he thought about it. Anxious because her final goal wasn’t to have a good time: it was to ruin him.
“What, so, you’re fucking Malfoy?” Ron wasn’t staring at him, but his lips were quivering up into a nasty smile. And it wasn’t a smile either, it just seemed to sit there. Like it didn’t belong there but was forced upon his face by the situational shock it’s owner had to endure. His hands were rough in his hair. “Merlin, this is fucked up.”
“Fine. I'll eat the cake if you stop doing whatever you’re doing.” he shakes his head. “Just know that somewhere a Tesco employee is crying and not knowing why. It should be a crime for you to enter there.”
Charlie, when he scans up from his weeds, is setting up the tables and chairs out front beside Ron. Their tiny forms were hauling the first half of the rectangular table they’d be sitting at. The lumpy hilltop he strolled on had quite the height advantage on the swaying Burrow.
Parkinson clapped her hands together when they were all compiled into one big circle. “Here are the rules: Draw from the box once you’ve chosen truth or dare and pick a paper. If you refuse to do your truth or dare once you’ve chosen, the last person who went will be able to create one for you.”
Well, no one was to be found, really.
Fingers pinch his thigh, and he hisses away from the pain. She laughs, “Don’t come crying to me when he’s making you pose for his weird campaigns.” He goes forward to pinch her arms in revenge, but she blocks him with her elbows.
Now, the bottle rolled and rolled, taking everyone’s inhaled breaths with it. The bottle stopped, taking everyone’s exhales with them, because it’s nose was snubbing Draco Malfoy.
She held up her hand,
because they
Not that doing illegal activities had bothered them before but still. It was the thought that counted.
His heart stutters, “I know—!”
Harry shakes his head. “Is.. is there a way to get the Weasley’s immunity as well? Hermione?”
He sighs, standing up and triggering the slight tremors in his paper towers. His hands clamp down on Harry’s shoulders, offering words he can’t hear and then he’s alone.
He wobbled out the lift, holding his hand to his gut in a way to reassure himself that the thick layer of skin holding all of his organs together wouldn’t snap. It wouldn’t look good for Malfoy if Harry appointed himself as his witness with his entrails hanging about.
Ron claps him on the shoulder, “Thought you were gonna punch him right in his smug face for a minute.” Harry’s hands pause in their attempt to put his crooked glasses back on.
Harry doesn’t say anything so she continues on, “Ron’s mouth is loose, Harry, you honestly should take what he says lightly. He can be a brute, but he doesn’t mean anything he says.”
“No,” he tells her, feeling a guilty ache tinge his chest when she deflates. “I’m sorry, but I can’t. What would they do if we were caught? You, me…” he stutters over the next name. “Ron; Gin. My name doesn’t hold any power in the Unification Community, and Ron and Gin are purebloods. They’d pair them off without question.”
She, taller than him, nodded and threw a brief frown in his direction. “Is there a particular reason you’ve called for this session or do you plan to sit there like a decapitated flobberworm.”
Malfoy breaks his rules. “Merlin, it’s like you breathe ignorance.”
“It’s not your fault.”
There were many things the racist, minted bully deserved; the Kiss wasn’t one of them. No matter how much Ron grumbled about it at the kitchen table, Harry wouldn’t be a bystander to murder.
Harry burned—his skin inflamed, his dick burning. He was ignited. His breathing was warm against the bed sheets; the tree wood, the floor, the sky. The skin-to-skin contact was a powerful narcotic to him, and he couldn’t quite call himself an addict.
Hermione’s words shoved their way through his head, becoming a postponed headache awaiting its release.
He had five minutes before he was due at the Burrow, because Mrs. Weasley was meant to be helping him prepare for the Ball. When he’d shown her the dress robes he had intended to wear—his spell-lengthened fourth year robes that he’d begged Hermione to refit—she tutted and told him to be inside Burrow at five pm. Sharp.
“Never Have I Ever been in a serious relationship,” Zabini announced, a satisfied smile on his face as Ron, Harry, Hermione, Dean, and Malfoy start in on their candy. “Who tied you down, Draco? Was it you, Parkinson?” He nudges Malfoy, and a surge of anger rises at the implication. “You were busy getting tied down, eh?”
The dead eyes, the sad eyes, and the worst of all the faraway eyes. He’d rather it be him then them.
Mr. Weasley was tweaking at a muggle toaster. Bill was speaking to Percy about Fleur’s recent promotion at Gringotts. Charlie and Ron were no were to be seen.
Harry scrapped his mind for anything useful. “He helped me escape when I was captured by Voldemort… oh! He gave me his wand, as well—!”
There’s a thump in the room, and Ginny’s shrieking into the couch’s coverings.
He owed the court 4,368 hours of house arrest, and he would be required to visit his probation officer once a month to be evaluated. There was a murmuring between the Wizengamot, and then Trulock announced that Malfoy was required to finish his schooling as well.
There weren’t too many occasions where Harry had been in a court and knew what he was meant to be doing. Hell, the court shows Petunia put on in the dining room during her Wednesday afternoon book clubs now felt useless compared to the real thing.
“Potter?” A voice to his left called, and Harry gives a low swear. He circles around, blue giraffe rattle still in his hand. Auror Ackern gives him an icy once over. “Didn’t know you shopped here.”
He forces a laugh, always in the position to nod along.
Harry cackles, throwing his head back in a laugh and near choking on his cake.
She did not budge in her stern expression.
“So there are only seven Ancient and Noble houses but I take it there are a ton of Ancient
“This is it… this is how I save Draco from associating with me!”
“I hope to see you around at Hogwarts, Draco.” He smiled like it didn’t bother him and turned to head back to Madam Malkin’s to wait for Hagrid, when a cold touch wrapped around his wrist. He startled and jumped back a little, whipping around to see Draco on his feet and leaning back as if remembering himself, his cheeks darkening noticeably.

with his best friend’s parents. He’d already talked plenty with Mrs. Malfoy and had seriously regretted it, so it set him right on edge. Of all the things he’d been planning for today, small talk had
“I’d rather hear Harry say it.”
"Guys!"
McGonagall would at least let Harry go. And that’s what’s important—I just want to go too.” He demanded.
“Not particularly, why? Is that how it is in the muggle world?”
Hagrid seemed to notice about five seconds too late that he’d just interrupted something, and it took him another full two seconds to realize
“Right…”
And then he proved once again that
“Harry!”
the words went unspoken but he felt it harshly in his stomach that was exactly what her wide eyes were trying to silently communicate to him.
She’d told Albus that when he’d asked many years later, if she ever regretted turning down that offer.
Harry just grinned and went along for the ride, feeling a distinct relief in how light he suddenly was.
didn’t care didn’t mean that it wouldn’t be meaningful to someone in that dead family whose ghost might be happy their name got to live on alongside the name Potter.
“That is what I want to determine.” She stood before him, arms folded behind her back and nodded to the buttons. “I’ve seen you preform the switching spell previously; can you perform it now please.”
, Potter. I’m still going to tell everyone but how exactly did you want to do this.”
Okay, that dampened his mood a little bit, but he steadfastly ignored it for the time being. McGonagall's implication that flying was dangerous probably meant he should keep his wits about him for this.
Which, Harry did not immediately do. He went and took a shower, ate as much breakfast as he could, and started to empty out his bottomless bag of all his worldly possessions. He was… not thrilled with how much had incidentally been ruined by his carelessly rummaging through it with his bloody hands, but he simply sorted out what needed to be tossed and what he would keep—he half thought he’d have outgrown some of his clothes and they’d need to be replaced, but found that ultimately not necessary. He hadn’t grown tall enough in the last year to outgrow a single piece and in fact most of it was now a bit baggier than it’d once been.
be back tomorrow to talk about this, don’t think this is over!” He warned, but the giant man waved him off, either not really hearing him or just not caring.
Even her apologies annoyed him, but he couldn’t exactly do anything but sit here and do nothing while he waited for her to finish her work.
“And you sound like Albus when you say that.” She snapped rather unkindly. “I’m starting to think no one actually understands
… he couldn’t help but imagine it for a brief moment here and there and was… conflicted, about what his assumptions were telling him. Potter had
“Wouldn’t you like to know,” Blaise pushed himself into the conversation just to annoy her, and it seemed to work as she shot him a venomous glare.
What did…?
Be it the wand in his face or the glare he was being pinned down with, Ron took two steps back quickly.
is my point!” Draco exploded again, instantly riled. “Someone tried to kill you and you don’t even care!”
And even with pain reduction potions, it was also flatly impossible to fix the cruciatus nerve damage without triggering ghost pains of the curse itself, and for that Harry was totally fine with being kept unconscious for days if it meant he didn’t have to come near that kind of pain ever again.
but because he was the son of people Hagrid once cared about. For some reason that didn’t bother him nearly as much as he thought maybe it should.
“What do you say, Ron? Wanna play a bit?” Seamus brought the conversation back eagerly.
"We need to get him to Madam Pomfrey, now!" someone said, and Harry had already forgotten them by the time they finished speaking.
Only, he didn’t get very far before the compartment door slid open. Harry glanced up quickly, half hoping/expecting to see a silver blond waiting on him, and was a little surprised but not unhappy when there was a red headed boy shifting awkwardly in the door instead. He probably belonged to the family the twins were from—the Weasleys they’d said.
“Yeah…?”

so rightfully arrogant to leave him with his wand.
He tried not to think too hard on anything but his dreams of being anywhere but here as he slipped out of the shed in the early morning light and made his way into the main house, being as quiet as possible as he entered the kitchen and began assembling what he needed for the Dursley’s breakfast and for once not feeling like he wanted to skim any of the food off the top for himself. He hadn’t really been hungry since getting back to Private Drive, although he did eat when he knew he should. He only quickly downed his required two potions on Pomfrey’s orders, saving his calming draught for later in the day—if today followed the patterns of the last couple weeks, he’d be on house chores all morning and knew he’d need it after Petunia wore him down with her sharp comments and then kicked him outside to do yard work in the blistering heat of the summer.
He finished up by moving briskly towards the Gryffindor table—being clapped on the back by some ecstatic Weasley twins out of nowhere and several people trying to shake his hand while Neville scooched over to make room for him by his side. He thought of Draco but knew the blond would be fine on his own for now, and that this wouldn’t change anything. He was a Gryffindor now, and took the opportunity to look around and greet his housemates properly.
Harry didn’t have to go far to know where he got that idea, even if Dean

Harry very much wanted to ask how the hat worked but refrained from doing so. He sensed the hat was amused by this thought and thankfully didn’t comment on it.

"That means its eight and eight—I can stay over here and talk rules and basics, while everyone else who wants to play a pick-up game."
“Severus isn’t trying to kill you!” Draco insisted more emphatically this time, and Harry rolled his eyes.
No, the twins said she was loyal to Dumbledore… she was by far his favorite teacher and he
Cedric was an upper year Hufflepuff that Hannah had a not-so-subtle infatuation with and she was the type of girl who would actually swoon if someone wrote her poetry. The guy wasn’t that much older than them but he had a jawline cut from marble and suave coolness to him that Harry found entertaining—mostly because he’d heard Hannah go on about him for quite some time and given how it visibly annoyed Susan he would never not find that funny. He took extreme joy in asking Hannah to tell him more about Cedric’s freckles just to see Susan’s blood pressure rise and it was totally worth it.

“Really though, it’s good to see you awake. You gave everyone a right heart attack, when we heard what happened.” Lu huffed, settling down some when it was clear Blaise had done a great job of getting on every last one of his nerves in a very short amount of time.
He couldn’t touch them.
Until… he felt hairs on the back of his neck stand up a bit, like someone was watching him. He blinked, glancing around the shop slightly so he didn’t throw off the assistant’s work as she was doing something with fabric down by his feet now, and realized with a start the boy beside him was staring right at him.

“Very good, Mr. Potter, I’ll see about fixing those things sometime today. Where would you like your mail directed?”
“And you even had more noble reasons for sending us off than we’d ever had.” The other twin chimed in, equally as unimpressed with Harry’s attempt to make amends.
Harry felt something in his temple twitch.
Whether they were going to talk politics some more or move topics, Draco’s stomach took that moment to growl loud enough that they both heard. Looking at the blond though he was staring at the ceiling, ears deep pink in embarrassment.
“Sometimes those with weaker magical cores can suffer health problems if they’re not careful. As if your magic is a reservoir that can only do so many things at once—if they use it to cast spells then it’s

"They do that all the time, ignore it." Draco waved it off distractedly, tapping the table near him in a silent command for Harry to settle down and focus now.
That’s right… he hadn’t told Draco about Sirius.
"And you kind of caught Neville which proves

“Mr. Potter kindly refrain from whatever it is you think you’re doing right now.” A sharp voice froze him in his tracks, and he automatically slumped back from his attempts, blinking widely to see where that warning had come from but not being able to move his head much to see.
He tried very, very hard not to outright hate the cupboard as he knew there was no escaping it until he was physically too big to fit into it anymore, and even then he could only imagine what the Dursleys would do. Probably just kick him into the un-air-conditioned, un-heated shed out back, and he knew older-him would not enjoy that either so just tried to keep breathing steadily and deal with the cupboard while he had it. He couldn’t hate it or he’d go insane, but controlling his emotions this way was turning out to be quite the learning experience; he was not an inherently patient person but he knew he
Such care into one aspect of his appearance he never even showed anyone spilled over until he was trying to take care of himself in other ways. For example Vernon and Petunia never once forced Dudley to brush his teeth if he didn't want to but Harry took it up religiously--twice a day in the morning and at night (he used tiny portions of Petunia and Vernon's toothpaste so they wouldn't notice; if Dudley's suddenly

Grown men and women cannot handle the cruciatus curse, and as a healer I frankly think they shouldn’t have to.” She sighed, weary, and Harry wondered how many people she’d treated for this curse. She was old enough to have been a mediwitch during the last war so… probably a lot. “The after effects… you might not even realize they’re still there, and they
“I can’t deny that I think he’s… interesting,” Harry mumbled. “But why are you suggesting that I fuck him?”
Blaise snorted and lifted an eyebrow as he walked closer. “You could have ordered some take away, you know. I’ve heard there's decent delivery coverage in London.”
“Hi,” Blaise said softly, his deep voice reverberating in Harry’s chest as his hands slid over Harry’s forearms, gripping his fingers in the sudsy water. Harry instinctively leaned back against Blaise’s firm chest, watching as Blaise pulled their hands out of the water. He dried them with a wandless, wordless spell and smiled gently as he heard Blaise’s breath hitch when his magic swooped over him.
Draco buried a hand in Harry’s curls and tugged them softly before letting it slide down to his cheek. His thumb rubbed over Harry’s stubble as he kissed him again, deeper and slower this time. “I love you.”
"What?" Harry managed. His face screwed up even more with confusion while his hips stuttered against Draco's arse.
Harry’s cock was pressed between their stomachs now and Draco could see the precome smearing across their skin. He wanted to taste it, suck Harry off while he was fucked into oblivion by Blaise, but he’d promised… promised to just sit here and watch, so he did just that.
It appeared to be the last straw, because Harry gave a strangled cry and his hips caught an irregular rhythm, pushing deep inside Draco as he came undone for the second time that evening.
When Draco had asked him about tonight, he had been eager enough to agree. Draco wasn’t wrong about Blaise eyeing Harry in that way for a while now, and while they were dating, Ginny had told him enough stories about Harry to be curious. Getting Draco on top of it was more than a nice bonus. He’d had sex with Draco before. Just once, near the end of eigth year when they were both sloshed after a rowdy common room party, and from what he remembered of it, it was good enough. Especially for a drunk romp.
Harry didn’t mind being alone in the house. He liked cooking if he could take his time for it, and especially if he knew it would be appreciated. Apart from cooking, he took it upon himself to decorate the house for Christmas and worked on his lesson plans. Theo wouldn’t be back for a month or two after the break as their baby would soon be born, so he also needed to look into the lesson plans for the oldest class to be able to help out the substitute when the Ministry finally deigned themselves worthy of sending one.
“Sorry, sorry, I’ll keep still,” the other man quickly apologised, anchoring himself with one hand on Harry’s shoulder now.
Blaise rolled his eyes at their antics but still grabbed Harry’s arse to prevent him from tumbling to the floor when he leaned his head back to lick into Draco’s mouth for another dirty kiss. “Draco can get whatever he wants,” he commented. “As he likes it.”
“Sweet Merlin, look at you,” Blaise whispered, moaning when Harry took him back into his mouth, deeper this time, until the head bumped against the back of his throat. He sucked hard when he pulled off, his tongue pressing against the underside, and didn’t pause before taking him back in. He bobbed his head a couple of times, alternating between licking, sucking and humming until Blaise squeezed his shoulder.
Harry’s jaw dropped. Had he really been so out of it that he had missed them discussing Blaise moving in and the three of them being
Blaise raised an eyebrow and Draco rolled his eyes. "He does that sometimes," he shrugged. "He'll probably wake up to wash up in a little while."
Blaise didn’t waste another moment before he bent down to kiss Harry again, his hands moving down to Harry’s arse.
Harry snorted. “No, he didn’t actually. Hermione was a month early. Pregnancy brain, she claims.” He turned off the heat under the bacon and turned around, leaning against the furnace as he watched Draco. “Why? Did you have plans?”
"Hmm, yes." Draco nodded. He grabbed his wand to fix the wet spot on the sheets and haphazardly threw it back on the side table before he turned over to face Harry. "I think the two of you should fuck."
“Fine, sorry.” Draco rolled his eyes and then turned to face Harry, hand moving to play with his unruly hair. “I’ve told you about that fantasy of mine, haven’t I? Where I watch you having sex with someone else.”
On Monday, Harry tried his hardest to stay busy. He cleaned the house from top to bottom, changed the sheets in the master bedroom as well as in every guest bedroom (there were three, for some reason) and when all that was done and it still wasn’t time to start on their dinner, he took the tube, got out at a random stop and walked around muggle London for two hours before going back.
“You would be craving some anyway, so you could as well bring the rest of the groceries,” Draco grinned, kissing Harry on the lips as he leaned in to Blaise’s side, pint of ice cream in hand.
Instead, he reached down to fist Draco’s cock, gripping it tightly as he moved back and forth. His fingers were still slippery with lube and there was enough precome gathered on Draco to make up for what had dried up.
Blaise chuckled. "Uhm, I guess I should get going then," he said.
"What was that?" Harry asked, his arm flopping over his forehead. "About Blaise," he explained as he saw Draco's confused look.
Blaise reached down to grab Draco’s knee, pulling it up over his hip as he let his hand slip between his legs. Exchanging a look with Harry, he waited until the latter mumbled a lubrication spell pointed at both Blaise’s fingers and Draco’s arse. It smelled citrusy and felt fresh and tingly on his hand. He could only imagine what it would feel like for Draco. He fumbled at little at first, bumping against Harry’s balls but then his finger found Draco’s hole, the muscle clenching against his finger as he started to push inside. He went slow, inserting just the tip at first, pulling back out and not going in any further until he felt Draco relax around his finger. Then, he pushed in a little further, just up until his first knuckle and gave a few thrusts again, watching how Harry was licking and sucking at Draco’s neck. The blond man’s eyes were closed and his jaw relaxed. His breath was slightly laboured but apart from that and the tiny increments of his hips, he looked perfectly at peace.
He turned the spigot off and seemed to take a breath.

The fact they were pretending for his sake meant everything.

like the floo network much. It was a whirlwind and not in a fun way riding a broom was, but simply just dizzying and he got a huge amount of soot up his nose. Thankfully his contacts being fire-resistant also seemed to include ash and dust-resistance so he could see almost unnaturally clearly, but that only meant he could see the spinning, dizzying colors in such a sharp contrast it made him sick. He squeeze his eyes shut and clung to Draco for dear life as they spun—and then suddenly it was over and it was only Draco’s hands on his arms holding him upright that prevented him from taking a spinning fall onto the glassy marble surface below them.

He seemed to be talking mostly to himself, but Harry made a point to remember that two separate people had mentioned this Snape guy and his less-than-stellar character. Hagrid was one thing, but this guy worked at a potions’ shop so one would assume he saw quite a bit of a potions
“What’s Saturday?” A new voice chimed in and Harry perked up as Daphne slid into the bench across from him—right next to Blaise who instantly looked ready to dump his tea on her.
“Sounds like you beat a lot of people out though.” He noted, if both Tracy and Pucey had gone out it wasn’t just up for the taking then.
