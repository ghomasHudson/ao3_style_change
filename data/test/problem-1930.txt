"No the one example I can think of is a child trapped beneath a car when its mother was able to find the strength to actually lift it and reach the kid," Granger explained.
"Yes he did pass, but if father and I come to see him you would need to gift him with something for he seems to have presented due to the Black family," Luna said moving closer now that Draco's scent was holding hers at bay.
"Pre-lesson?" Harrison asked. "I did not have any pre-lessons I was picked up by Hagrid on my eleventh birthday and we went to Diagon Alley to get my supplies before I was brought home. Besides learning I was Magical from him when he came to get me the only stuff I learned before riding the Hogwart's Express was what little I was able to read from my course books."
Dumbles had to use a firecracker to make the students pay attention to them telling them that due to a possible show of favoritism he might have shown Professor Umbridge now that their relationship was known she had been replaced by an Auror known as Kingsley Shacklebolt before he sat down. Those with heightened senses and near to the head table began to spread the real story. It seems Fudge had been furious about their relationship and would have fired the woman if he had an actual cause so rather she was being transferred back to her office at the Ministry as someone he could actually trust was to take over teaching D.A.D.A and watching over the school.
Understanding what Harry was saying Draco hugged him harder.  "Then don't go back there," Draco said burying his face into Harry's messy hair and taking a deep sniff of the Omega's pleasant scent.
Harry could not help but wince thinking of something that belonged to an Alpha his Omega had latched onto but thankfully it was Hermione who spoke up, "Ron that is someone's property I will not let you destroy it,"
At the very least, Harry no longer had to deal with the Daily Prophet. After the Malfoy’s purchased the company from the current owner—for a much larger sum than it was worth—Harry hired an editor that would make sure no more scathing articles about his life, or the lives of his friends, would be printed.
Now alone, Harry was free to moan as loudly as he wanted, and he did, the sound echoing in the quiet house as Draco bit his lip.
Draco growled as he took him in, and he straightened, pulling Harry to stand and ripping their shirts from their arms. Now bare-chested, their naked skin flush against one another set Harry’s stomach fluttering as he was pulled into a searing kiss.
With a flourish, Draco signed his name, handed his mother the quill and contract, and leant back in his seat to stare out the nearby window. The sudden shift in his demeanour was a bit off-putting, but Harry paid that no mind.
Draco hissed in pleasure as Harry moved his hand up and down experimentally. His dreams certainly never prepared him for
; Draco hadn’t been lying earlier when he said he was immense. Licking his lips, he leant over to wrap them around the head of Draco’s pale cock.
“If you want to be fucked that bad, Potter, then I’ll make sure no-one will ever measure up to what I can give you.”
“I’m sure you’re wondering why you’re here. So firstly, I must thank you for agreeing to come. We were concerned you would not.”
“He has.” Narcissa’s lips turned upward with another smile. “He wants us to purchase the Daily Prophet.”
Harry could feel his face flush at his admission, and he quickly tried to rebury his face in the soft tuxedo jacket.
“You know,” Draco mumbled, shifting his hips and thrusting deeper. “I expected you to be some type of romantic. Needing candles and flowers and all that type of shite in order to be fucked.”
“Harry, as you know, our stance in the War was... misguided and wrong,” the witch shifted in her seat, the uneasiness of her words evident on her features. “We regret the side we chose, and have since paid dearly for it, though not as bad as we could have. We appreciate your testimony at our trials, especially Draco’s.”
“You’ll be whimpering for an entirely different reason soon,” Draco retorted, mumbling another lubrication charm and rubbing the head of his cock against Harry’s stretched hole.
“I hope you’re well, Harry. I must say we’ve been following your career closely and are very impressed,” Narcissa said, leading them to a room off to the left of the foyer.
Draco settled next to his mother, leaning one elbow against the arm of the settee and the other across the back. His legs splayed open, the black pants rumpled as though he had been curled up somewhere. The rest of his attire was in a similar state of unruliness, and Harry could spy dark circles under his eyes as they stared at him discerningly. It was so unlike Draco that it was a bit startling—even his usually impeccable hair was in disarray, the strands ruffled and messy.
Draco’s pace was relentless as he pounded into Harry, and he was sure that bruises would litter his hips tomorrow from the unyielding fingers. Lifting his hips higher, arching to provide Draco with a smoother movement, Harry listened to Draco’s murmured incoherency as he chased his own release. It didn’t take long for the deep moan to come, for Draco to bury himself as far as he could go as he spilt inside Harry’s arse.
Harry let out an audible growl at the words, standing tall to pull him into a heated kiss. He needed to taste Draco—
Harry felt his face heat, and he carefully sat down next to Draco, ignoring the delight that filled him as the pain still lingered in his arse. Taking one large hand in his, Harry replied, “I did too.”
“Of course. You wouldn’t be here if he didn’t. He was the one who suggested I meet with you in private first. And I must insist that you call him Draco if you agree to this.”
Narcissa set her cup down again and called for Tivy, and the house-elf popped into view a moment later. “Have Lord Malfoy and Draco come meet us in here.”
Harry sighed as he watched Draco flit from socialite to socialite, the all-black tuxedo stark against the pale dress robes of the wizards and witches around him. Even at a Winter Ball, he insisted on dressing in dark colours. Not that Harry complained too much, he admired the way the black fabric hugged his broad shoulders and long legs.
Draco broke their kiss but kept Harry hidden from view, his jaw flexing as his teeth clenched together. His eyes searched Harry’s, and with a quick gaze to his mouth, he whispered, “Let’s get out of here.”
Harry took in the woman before him with wary eyes, and an uncomfortable sensation settled over him. The matron stood at the entrance to the Malfoy Manor just behind their house-elf, a small smile gracing her face.
Pulled from his musings, Harry watched as Narcissa waved her hand, and a rolled-up length of parchment floated into view.
Harry contemplated for a moment as he stared at the contract. What was something he wanted? He had his parents fortune, plus Sirius’s, and the money given to him from the Ministry at the end of the war—his Hero Reward, as they called it. He donated so much of it to reparations, and yet he had more than he knew what to do with. No, he didn’t want anything material. But there was something even better that came to mind.
Harry looked up at him from behind his spectacles, aware of the picture he must make—thick cock still in his mouth, and hand around his own.
Harry glared and pushed his glasses up from where they had slid down the bridge of his nose from the forceful spank. “No.”
Harry arched his back, goosebumps breaking over his skin in anticipation. He had dreamt of his moment for so long, in so many instances, and now it was finally happening.
Later, as they lay wrapped together and satiated for the final time—that night—Harry didn’t mind that he dreamt of Draco-
Draco took him deep into his mouth, and Harry watched transfixed as he repeated the actions. The feel of his tongue pressing firmly against the underside of his cock as he bobbed his head was heaven, and just as Harry felt himself climb higher towards the tipping point, Draco pulled away with a wet
Harry chucked his wand to the table and stepped back, kneeling to pull Draco’s trousers down. A surprised laugh escaped his lips at the sight of the pants beneath them.
But that smirk, that damned smirk that mockingly curled his lips when he finally looked at Harry was all Draco.
Harry moaned at his words, one hand gripping Draco’s thigh, the other wrapping itself around his own cock. Desperate for some type of release, he began to pump himself in time with the movement of his head.
Lucius, however, looked as he always did; full of contempt and as though he owned the world, and he looked relatively healthier than the last time Harry saw him at his trial. Two years ago, Lucius was gaunt and sickly, as if all the energy and life had been zapped from him. But now he looked quite the opposite.
“Please, call me Narcissa. Come in.” She stepped further into the Manor, and Harry followed, blinking in surprise at the interior. It had completely changed since the War two years ago. The floors, once dark and caked with the blood of his friends, were now a white marble so bright Harry had to squint his eyes from the reflecting sun.
Draco trailed kisses down Harry’s chest and stomach, teeth grazing the soft flesh. Harry’s stomach fluttered at the sight of the Slytherin on his knees before him, and when Draco pulled back to look up at Harry, he very nearly came in his pants right then and there.
Harry couldn’t even form a retort as he wrapped his hand around the length. Draco was so vast that his fingertips didn’t even touch—Harry’s mouth watered. He’d only ever been with one man before, and he certainly did
Harry nodded mutely, unease coursing through him as he was led farther into the Manor. Taking a deep breath, he gently patted the pocket of his trousers to ensure his wand was still there. He was an Auror, damn it. He could take down dark witches and wizards with ease, but the thought of tea with Narcissa Malfoy made his blood turn ice cold.
“Are you getting hard already?” Draco asked, amusement evident in his tone. “Do you still want to go back to that party to find someone else to shag?”
The chilled night air hit his skin as he walked out the doors, moving towards the edge of the terrace, and Harry leant against the railing, taking in the vast gardens below. As the smell of the blooming gardenia filled his nose, he heard the sound of the door behind him open and close.
Hermione had known of his preferences since they hunted Horcruxes; Harry had confided in her when Ron left. The guilt of breaking up with Ginny the first time ate away at him, the locket doubling his feelings. Ron, however, was much harder to tell. He only knew a day before Harry broke up with Ginny the second, and last, time. Ron had told Harry that, though he was angry over Harry leading Ginny on, they were still best mates—nothing could ever change that. Harry was thankful for Ron; he had helped take the blow of outrage from Molly and the rest of the Weasley Clan over the last month.
They were the only words Draco uttered as his fingertips gently traced over the faint scar given to Harry by that cursed quill in their fifth year. Swallowing the lump that formed in his throat, Harry watched Draco’s pointer finger move over the letters.
“I knew it wasn’t going to work,” she had said to him while they drank tea. “Pretending to be each other’s boyfriend’s was a ludicrous idea. Your feelings were bound to get muddled.”
Draco burst with a sudden laugh, the sound echoing in the small room. He sat up and leant forward, resting his elbows on his knees as he regarded Harry with a feral grin. Harry had never noticed the surreal mixture of silver and blue that swirled in his irises; it was as if he stared into liquid pools of mercury. Harry realised with a start that he had grown into quite a handsome man.
“I have to die, though, because I did die and only came back to defeat Voldemort. Colin Creevey’s dad had it right when he punched me at the funeral and said it should have been me. All of those deaths are because of me.”
Dean and Ron had threatened to quit because Draco was on the team, and Harry had just told them to go ahead. He proceeded to say that Draco was one of the best fliers that tried-out for the position of chaser, and if they cared more about house rivalries, then he didn’t need them on the team. Dean and Ron shot Harry a very nasty look, but Ron stayed while Dean walked out. Harry then told Sue Li that she would be the third chaser.
“How could you?” she whispered menacingly. “You don’t deserve him. We all saw this blow up coming, we warned you, and told you to lessen the load. But you didn’t listen! Then you went and spoiled the best relationship you will ever have, Draco Malfoy. All over a bad grade, that was probably grade unfairly in the first place! Don’t talk to any of us until you’ve nearly made this right!”
Draco knew this was going to happen, but he had not wanted the moment to come so soon. Zabini, Pansy, Draco, and two girls, Greengrass and Roper, were the ones who stood up from the Slytherin table. There were about 8 from Hufflepuff, and 9 from Ravenclaw; Gryffindor had Potter, Weasley, Granger, Longbottom, and four others he didn’t recognize from a distance. Draco sat down at the end of the table closest to the Slytherin table with Zabini and Pansy, the rest of the students sat as far away from the Slytherins as possible, with Greengrass and Roper in between the two groups. Draco loaded food onto his plate and ignored the sneers thrown at him, but no one dared to pull out their wand with Snape right there.
Harry Potter walked to the gates of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and looked up at the castle. He had just finished his fifth year of teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts a week prior, and was still loving being a professor. He was confused, and slightly anxious, as to why Headmaster Snape wanted to have a meeting with him just one week after the term ended, but Harry knew Severus wouldn’t tell him until he was ready. Harry walked up to the Headmaster’s office and knocked; the door opened immediately revealing Severus sitting at his desk.
Truthfully he didn’t know why Draco came with him to each tutoring session, but he was grateful for the blonde boy’s presence. He was kind to the kids who came in, and helped Harry answer questions or read over homework that was handed to him. Draco helped Harry come up with a timetable to fit in his classes, study/homework time, Quidditch, and these tutoring sessions with every year having a potential time. Harry was anxious to start sessions with any more years, though, due to a fear they only wanted to come because he was the Boy-Who-Lived. Draco had told him twice that it was unfair to only tutor the first years, when Hartley was an awful professor that each year had to deal with. Harry had ignored the comment both times, and Draco let the subject drop.
“His story is that Death was pissed about being robbed of a soul, and warned him to never reveal his charm that stopped the killing curse. He then told us that he had to hide my parents so his charm would never be suspected. He also said that he had to leave me here because I was the ‘Chosen One’.”
About an hour after he arrived, a few more guests started showing up to the dinner; Neville was the first and talked to Harry about his excitement to go back to Hogwarts and his hope that Professor Sprout would let him plant something in the greenhouses. Next came the Lovegoods, which Luna speared him with a stare; she came up to him, and the usual dreamy tone to her voice was gone when she stated that he should stop. Harry was taken aback by her tone, and the fact he wasn’t sure what she meant. He had a very strong suspicion, but didn’t know how she could tell. The dreamy tone came back, when she started telling him about the newest fictional creature her father was obsessed with.
Harry looked up at Hermione startled, he didn’t realize that there were girls in their year that shared a room with Hermione who cared about blood status; he had been to Sally Smith’s funeral because he remembered Zacharias casting a curse at him, but he didn’t know they were in the same year and house. Lily was sitting by herself, looking blankly into the fire. Hermione spoke up again, “Her father was a Death Eater, but she didn’t go to trial since she fought for Hogwarts. Not many people have connected them, so she doesn’t have to constantly be vigilant for hexes and curses. She still believes in blood purity, though, just not enough to kill over it.”
After that time, Harry had attempted a couple more times when he had ordered Kreacher to do something, but Kreacher seemed to always know when Harry’s wand had cut, and rushed to save him. The last time he had sent Kreacher to the market and tried to take his own life, but, as luck would have it, Hermione had decided to check on him. She barely saved him in time. Harry had been unconscious for three days after that attempt, and Hermione didn’t leave his side the whole time. He had expected her to yell at him, call him selfish, say he was a terrible friend, and turn her back on him, but she didn’t. She had looked at him with a concerned look on her face and begged him to see a Mind Healer; it wasn’t until she had started crying that he agreed to look into it.
Harry looked at the sign-up sheet posted in the eighth year’s common room and was surprised that it was already time for the headcount of who was staying at Hogwarts for the winter break. He had been so busy between the tutoring, Quidditch, and classes that the last month had flown by. He could hardly believe that the first term would be ending in a couple of weeks. He felt someone walk up behind him and could smell Draco’s recognizable cologne.
She had narrowed her eyes at the pair of them, and made her way to the stove. It was while she was cooking him lunch that she had announced the birthday celebration. She had plated his lunch when she finished telling him about the birthday plans. Harry ate a couple of bites and told her thanks, but it was unnecessary; then he asked her about Ron when she started worrying over his health.
After they went through the normal first years, the three Wallers were left. They were going to be temporarily placed for the year, and would have the normal Hogwarts experience. Harry wondered where they would go.
“Well, yeah, but it’s my fault for asking for so much.” Draco’s eyes finally found his and Harry nearly flinched from the way they burned.
However, Harry needed to keep his chin up as none of his friends, except Draco and Hermione, knew about his parents being alive. He kept the mantra of this being his family going through his mind over and over, so he could try and keep a sunny outlook. He believed that he was succeeding and his friends were none the wiser.
“Zacharias asked me to pass along his apology for cursing you at Sally’s funeral a month ago. He and Sally were twins, sorted into different houses; he basically disowned her for not being in Hufflepuff. When he discovered that Sally had fought and died in the battle that he ran away from, he attacked pretty much anyone who spoke to him; it wasn’t the best way for him to deal with his grief, but the prick is finally starting to become a better person. I wasn’t going to tell you because I was angry with you, so don’t make me regret it Potter.”
The tears that were building finally slipped out, and Harry was sobbing. He could barely catch his breath from his mad dash from the seventh floor to here, and now the sobbing was making it almost impossible. He drew out his wand, ready to end himself since he was only going to cause pain to everyone he loved. He hesitated and thought of the younger students that he unconsciously found a purpose with; he suddenly realized that he truly went from merely surviving to living when he started tutoring, really teaching since Hartley was rubbish. Then he reasoned with himself that in the long run Hartley would certainly punish them, ensuring that he did more harm than good. Stiffening his resolve, Harry started to cast the curse that would open his veins, but stopped when he thought of Ida who was so very brave and the possibility that she might find him since this was a girl’s bathroom.
“Not exactly, but I always thought I was the only one who could protect what was at risk those first few years. After my fifth year, Voldemort was too powerful to stop.”
Draco looked at Pansy incredulously, but as he thought about her words, he knew she was right. Zabini looked uneasy too, but also nodded in agreement. The trio spent the rest of the train ride coming up with their plan to avoid blame. Draco felt some undetermined emotion over the fact they were discussing protecting themselves instead of helping Potter, but he swallowed it down. Slytherins considered their own interests first, and then worried about other people.
He felt Hermione look at him, and then look at the parchment in his hands. “Draco, it’s not that bad; you still passed. An “Acceptable” on one essay does not mean the end of an exemplary grade.”
“He won’t be alone, and I’m fairly sufficient in hexes.” Sue Li had taken a place next to Longbottom.
They ate, did what they needed to wrap up the details of their last year at Hogwarts, and then rode the boats across the lake. Harry turned around to stare at the castle and remembered the first trip across; he was still dazzled by the castle. Harry did not think he would ever be able to accurately describe what Hogwarts meant to him, but it was his first true home and held memories that would continue to shape him forever. He faced back the right way, and felt excited to look forward to seeing what his future held.
James looked around, but didn’t recognize either of them. Harry stood up and walked over to the man. His hands were sweaty, and he nearly stumbled.
The table broke out into laughter at the conclusion of Blaise’s story, but Harry had to force his laughter. It had been difficult seeing his parents, and now knowing that he would be seeing quite a bit of them throughout the term. It was downright torturous to know that he would be teaching his siblings this term, while they would never know of him as anything other than their professor.
Everyone thank you for the comments, and love. I've been a bit overwhelmed these last couple of weeks, but I swear I've been reading them. I'll respond when I get the chance. Thanks for reading!
The month between Harry’s birthday and the day they went to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters was one of the longest months of Harry’s life. When he woke, almost a week after his latest suicide attempt, Harry was so distressed that he had failed yet again; didn’t the Universe realize how it would be better with Harry dead? He wasn’t awake long before Hermione came into his room and hugged him, then Ron told him quietly the scene they found was one of the worst he had ever seen. Harry felt a bit guilty over this, but he wouldn’t apologize.
Lily was breathing hard while finishing her tale, and when she finished saying her piece, she broke down into tears.
Ron watched as Harry’s face paled, and tried to pull his best mate out of earshot. There was no use, even with Hermione helping. After Ginny declared she wasn’t keen on forgiving Harry, Harry started shaking. He didn’t think Harry knew his magic burned Ron’s hand that was gripping Harry’s arm, but Ron had no choice to let go. Harry bolted outside, and Ron, Hermione, Charlie, Mum, and Dad all yelled for him. Ron watched Bill ask what was happening. Harry fell into the grass, and Ron put his hand on Harry’s back. Harry stood up quickly and disappeared with a loud crack.
“Until the mind is properly adjusted. If you rush it, then the mind will begin producing vicious defenses that will only harm the Potter’s.”
Draco looked up as he heard movement in the common room, but there was nobody there. Then the common room door opened without anyone walking in; cursing Draco cast a disillusionment charm on himself and used the
Draco sat down for breakfast, but Zabini and Pansy weren’t there yet; since school started again a little over a week ago, Draco usually came down for breakfast before most people were awake, so he could leave before the hall became crowded. He had discovered that most people thought he was a great target to launch their food at; although his family had been knocked off their pedestal, Draco was not going to go to class with filthy robes. Longbottom started coming to breakfast with Draco, as he liked to go to the greenhouses before class, which inevitably left a streak of dirt on his face in some way. This morning Longbottom was sitting next to Draco while eating breakfast, neither of them spoke to each other though.
Harry could hear her voice breaking, and knew she was going to start crying. Despair at making his friend cry warred with the desire to just wilt away. Hermione doesn’t deserve this, you git, pull yourself together. With that thought, Harry felt the cloudiness lift away from his brain a bit and sighed. He pushed himself up slightly, and had to breathe through the nausea and lightheadedness. It had been too long since he ate, and his body was angry at him for it.
"Well, all three people I invited over have agreed they will come over so now we just need to decide when to have the party. Um, I invited the twins," Harridan said not sure how Draco would respond with all the bad blood between the two families.
"That is it I feel it I am finally whole again as he hugs Narcissa tucking his head under her chin as she pats his back while Draco helps Harridan out of the room to follow the Goblin to the main cleansing.
"Well the property listed as gray unfortunately would be considered condemned, yellow would be the properties that you own that no longer has Houses Elves in them, the red while having House Elves need to have their Wards worked on. The ones that are listed in black ink are the properties that contain House Elves and are in good order. Also if you press your finger to any property it will give you some statistics on it such as how many Elves living in it, size, conditions of the Wards, and even some background on the property itself," Bonecrusher explained. Not sure how good Charity or Professor Baddling at Wards, or even if they had any talent in them at all Harrison began only to check out the black properties. Not wanting to live in a castle with so few people he skipped over them getting to some properties which were listed as Manors, but even they were too large in his opinion. He still pressed his finger on them just in case finding out that most that were listed as manors had no less than ten bedrooms, several bathrooms, kitchens, library, and other specialized rooms. The manors also tended to have somewhere from ten to twenty House Elves. Seeing the number of Houses Elves also made Harrison hesitate to choose the properties due to what Dobby had done to him. Granted he knew it was wrong to judge them all from only having met Dobby.
"What do you want? Whatever your selling I am not buying," a large beefy man said answering the door.
As he finished speaking the there was the sound of people Apparating in as the old bylaw forced the members of the board to appear unless they were sick or going to the bathroom bringing them in even though the normal Anti-Apparition Wards around the castle. The two other Heads of House and the six parents that made up the school board looked shocked to find themselves standing in the hallway outside the Transfiguration classroom. Drake Vansel, the current leader of the board was the first to collect himself to ask what was going on. " I am sorry for calling you all in but I think we need to discuss the expulsion of a student," Severus told them all.
"It is not your fault Ron she is part Veela like you had guessed," Harry said placing a comforting hand on his best friend's shoulder.
"What do you mean you are dead Harry?" Draco said as without even thinking about it pulled the brunette onto his lap.
As Harry came to his meeting with Draco he had hidden the blonde's cloak in an inside pocket which had helped him block out any bad scents even when it was nowhere near his nose. Finding his way to the stack set aside for the bibliographies he found a table that looked so dusty his aunt would never have let it in the house. But as he got closer he saw the table had an actual Glamor attached to it, shocking him a little. "Oh don't look so surprised Harry this is a special place where Slytherins go to make deals and arrangements with members of other Houses. And since no one usually comes back here we will undisturbed," Draco's voice said from behind him.
"I don't actually know," Charity said with a slight blush.  "Um, Madam Goblin can you answer that question for us?"
"Something we had already guessed the test would show. It was Percy's results that shocked everyone."
As Draco needed to start getting ready for the day, and his dormmates had to finish up, rather than have Harry wait in the hallway or leave without him, Draco had Harry just sit and wait on his bed. As Draco let everyone back in Harry lifted the hood of Draco's cloak over his head so he would not see the others getting dressed for the day. As Draco slipped on his own clothing for the day he also heard Harry humming a tune to himself, making him guess the new Omega was blocking out any conversation that they may or may not be having about him. Draco almost let out a chuckle being the only one close enough to hear the upbeat, but unknown to him, tune Harry was humming.
After Bonecrusher returned from taking Harry to perform the ritual he came back to his office to talk to Charity and Bathseda about housing for Harry. "As I told Madam Baddling earlier I can not give too much away without breaking my vows of privacy for my client I must stress upon you that Heir Potter should not live at Hogwarts Castle when school is not in session," Bonecrusher informed them as he sat down behind his desk.
"No Nev I was informed that he was my Godfather, another lie, and had actually been after Ron's rat who was Peter Pettigrew," Harridan stated.
Harrison's eyes goggled at the results of the test though wondering about all the asterisks beside some articles. They made him think of some of his old Muggle textbooks which marked an item from having a footnote but there was no further explanation on the page. He was also shocked to see that somehow his mother was part of the Hufflepuff line and he somehow owned three-fourths of Hogwarts. "I don't get it how is can my mom be connected to Hufflepuff I thought she was a Muggleborn?" he asked looking up at the Goblin on the other side of the desk.
"There might be a way," Lupin said but before he could say anything more Professor Dumbledore showed up letting him know his carriage had arrived. Lupin offered a quick apology saying he wanted to get out of school lest he damaged the reputation of the place by just being there once the students let their parents know about him being a werewolf.
"But I thought you had to get some of my blood?" Harry asked confused turning his left palm towards him and seeing it looked like it normally did.
"Go ahead my dear," Lucius said running his left hand over Tom's cheek who leaned into the touch with a slight purr.
"Well they sent a copy of their results to their Fathers' earlier with no problem, but I think if they try to message them now the message might be intercepted thanks to the crime report from this morning's paper," Blaise said pulling the now taller males to his side.
"It was when I had helped you stir your Potion when I had my arms wrapped around you to make sure you stirred it properly," Draco said causing Harry to blush now a little two.
"The challenge has been issued Albus it must be answered as stated in the Hogwarts charter," Professor McGonagall said back to him.
On the day after his Second Cousin had been captured yet escaped once again, he had been surprised to find an unfamiliar and pleasant scent in the castle. He had first smelled the new scent in the Great Hall, but it had been hard to pin down with the scents of the other students. Though there was no mistaking the new and utterly fascinating scent within the hall. Draco had been surprised to find a trace of the scent right there in the Entrance Hall right after breakfast. Draco found himself following the scent up to the library but did not see any students that had a birthday anywhere close to today. Granted he had no idea when Granger's Birthday was but the scent could be coming from her since she was a Mudblood.
Hearing that the man who had tried to kill him at least four times so far was the father of Draco, Harry pushed the other boy away his cobalt wings wrap protectively around his body. "Blue Jay, Harry it is alright," Draco said reaching forward making Harry flinch back from him as his green eyes kept shooting back and forth between Draco and the Dark Lord.
"Of for the love of," Draco said after nearly twenty minutes of non-stop giggling as he summoned some Calming Drafts for the pair. Seeing they would most likely not even be able to drink the Potions Draco Magiced them right into the twins' stomach calming them down at once. "Alright enough is enough what has got you both in such a good mood. It can't be that you were clean of any spells for I doubt that would be a reason for such overwhelming joy."
Rather than leave the room Severus and Minerva waited in the room for her response thinking it would be just as fast. What they had not expected was the woman to let herself arrive alongside Leia vie an Elf lead Apparition. "Is there something wrong with Susan's results?" Amelia asked waiting no time for pleasantries. Most people would be shocked to see the woman in such a state but when it came to her family, and most specifically Susan, she would actually show fear for them. Severus gave her an understanding look knowing that he was still having a hard time getting used to the fact that Harridan was his son and all the stuff the boy had been through, but it had to be worse for Amelia since she had gotten Susan after the girl's parents and four older siblings had died due to the last war,
"Fine whatever, you seemed to have made up your mind, but what was that flash when I touched Potter?" Draco asked.
"Well it was rather dangerous but you know I was faking it right and if you had made a serious mistake I would have rushed in to fix it," Draco said rubbing the back of his neck.
As they waited for the Elf to return Harry was reminded to eat his breakfast. Harry had basically eaten only three bits before the Elf returned with his trunk. "Heir Potter, can you please removed the Wards from your trunk?" Mr. Malfoy asked turning to him.
"Of course I do, I did not gain the title of Slytherins Queen of gossip by just watching everyone. I just like to sit back and watch every once and a while as it help inspires me," Pansy explained. Luna nodded before without warning plucking Pansy's notebook from her hands. "Hey give that back," Pansy said as the blonde girl began to flip through the book.
Once Draco had walked out the door Snape used his wand to close it and Ward it so no one could listen in. "Alright, you three from what your scrolls showed I think each of you needs to undertake a full cleansing. However, that is easier said than done for they can only be done at St. Mungos or the Bank and at the moment all fireplaces are being watched and the school's Wards under Professor Umbridge with the authority of High Inquisitor now track anytime anyone tries to leave and Apparate out of here," Snape said seeing a look of shock on all three faces at how he was trying to help them. "That just means we are going to have to be very clever and dare I say Slytherin. I know not something you Lions like to think about but it is needed," he said gesturing the three of them to the back wall of the classroom where a hidden doorway lead to his office. "I am going to give you a Portkey that will take you right to Gringotts. I will send the activation for it after I have distracted both the Headmaster and Professor Umbridge."
"About forty years ago Dumbledore still riding high on his defeat of Grindelwald, a decade before, having been placed as not only the Headmaster of Hogwarts, but the Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederacy of Magicals as well as Chief Warlock of the British Wizengamot started to pass laws against those who possessed Dark Cores. Using the claim that they would turn evil like Grindelwald. This did not go over well even with his popularity especially in the Wizengamot who is made up of three parties each one based on a person's core," Lucius said taking one of the chairs nearby and summoning some drinks with a snap of his fingers. "Seeing that he did not yet have the right amount of support Dumbledore started to go after creatures instead saying that even the "so-called" light ones were dangerous."
"Yes my son it seems was under several Potions and enchantments, and since we are currently bringing charges against the guilty parties," Severus said glaring at Albus "I can not and will not say anything more about it."
"Well since our relationship is now in the open we wanted to make sure it was clear that Professor Snape was not showing me any favoritism," Harridan said munching on the Ginger Newt.
"What part?" Harry asked unable to think of anything happy or joyous in their last meeting which had just been Harry working with Draco on some spells followed by Draco directing Harry on ways to prepare Potion Stocks and then helping him stir his mixture better.
"Dear Merlin," Professor McGonagall said as Sprout but a hand to her mouth seeing the man's second face.
"It is alright," Harry said not wanting to make a fuse of it though he was actually slightly proud with what they had said about a possible skill in potions that he possessed. Draco gave him a smile as unaware to Harrison the joy he felt at the news had caused him to unleash some pleased pheromones.
"Well, there would be the House Elves attached to your family.  Me if you would have me.  But if you wand some adults around I am sure I could get in contact with one of my Aunts to come over every once and while or we could invite my Uncle and his daughter," Draco said thinking about his Aunt Andy or Uncle Xeno who unlike his Father were not supporters of the Dark Lord.
Hearing the door open the entire Dursley family turned to look. "That Boy if he had just gotten himself expelled we are not keeping him," Vernon Dursley said lifting himself out of his armchair. But as he watched the woman he had just turned away from their home walk down the stairs with a wand out his clenched his beefy fist. "What do you think you are doing in my house?" Vernon asked getting ready to hit the intruder. woman or not.
"See right here you were following the assignment you got some things wrong which along with your hard-to-read handwriting lead to your point lost. But see here you start messing up more giving information which while might be right was about the wrong item. Take this for example," Draco said pulling out an essay he had turned in about moonstones. "You write about the properties, not of moonstones but moon leaf, and here rather than talk write about Athelas you go on a tangent about Whisperweed. I may not have much respect for you Potty but this is just sad."
"No that was just the story that leads to the inquiry," Lucius cut in. "Here look at this two students in a Sixth-Year Care of Magical Creatures class are working with a Hippogriff when something goes wrong as it clawed both of them. The Gryffindor student gets a simple healing potion and blood replenishers, while his friend from Slytherin is told that there could be poison on the creature's talons so was given a numbing potion as she closed his wound before putting a cast on their arm. Now how can two students get the same injury but get different diagnoses and treatments?"
"That ... is a rather troubling statement," the Goblin said stroking his beard for a moment. "Now I do not know what has brought you into the bank this day Master Potter but to sent my mind at ease I wish to ask you to go through both an Inheritance Test as well as an Audit of your vaults."
"How would I know which Elf to call?" Harrison asked still a little wary of House Elves. He did like Celia and Jeffory not only for them being rather kind but seeing neither had hesitation or embarrassment in how they dressed.
During the time he had spent with Hermione in the library the books had not become free, Madam Pince informed him that due to him using them that morning he would have to wait until no one needed them so that they were used by multiple students rather than come to him after the first one had been done with them. At least by spending the time with Hermione he had not worried about being assaulted by horrid scents, though he had also not detected the one that made him think of Sirius either after the first time.
Before Arthur performed the Weasley Blood Adoption Void ritual he canceled all but the contract between Ron and Hermione since it was the one that did not really involve his true family. With the illegal contracts stopped Arthur began the ritual to stop the Blood Adoptions between Molly and his children as well as him and the bitch's brats. To make sure they would not be disturbed the ritual was being performed at Grimmauld Place. With a quick Summoning Charm, Arthur and Remus brought the Magical Clock that had been hanging in the Burrow. Removing the clock hands that depicted Molly and her brats and placing them before him, Arthur began to chant the spell as he used his wand to create a cut in his hand letting the blood drop onto the hands of the invaders to his family. As the magic took hold the names and small profile pictures on the clock hands vanish leaving them bare for a moment. The clock hands were bare for just a moment before they began to change as the hand that had once been used by Molly shifted to Remus making the pair of them smile. Ron and Ginny's old hands began to glow signifying they would change as soon as they were put back onto the clock. With Molly and her kids gone, from the Weasley family clock, it was simplicity itself to finish removing the trio from having any access to his family magic.
"Oh, Harry," Draco said wrapping his arms tightly around Harry's body as he released a calming Alpha scent.
Molly woke with a screech that really showed off her Banshee heritage, breaking all the glass and mirrors in the place as she was expelled from the Burrow with nothing but the clothes on her back. And considering that she had been on her way to bed left her in nothing but her plaid nightgown and without her wand. With a growl, Molly lifted her hand in hopes of summing her wand to it but she found she could get past the Wards around the place. Though it pained her to leave her wand behind after half an hour of trying to get past the wards even using a full-powered Banshee yell that could shatter the foundation of a castle, lead her to fully call upon her creature side for the first time in years as she Apparated away to a lesser-used Magical Alley to pick up a replacement wand.
Since they were still underage they were accompanied by Severus who had wanted to spend some time with his son.  Rather than having to go through a magical shop this Magical street entrance looked like an alleyway but had Repealing Magic for anyone who did not have creature blood.  Harridan looks around at this new alley which had more specialty shops and a stranger-looking crowd as some let their creature attributes come out that were usually frowned upon, such as Severus who had let both out his large bat wings out.  The pair lead Harridan to a clothing store known as Creature Comforts where Harridan subjected himself to get measured letting Draco pick put the clothes for him as the only thing he ever wanted in clothes was that they were comfortable.  Placing their order of nearly ten separate outfits, though no sleep clothes, as Harridan refused to look for something other than Draco's old sleep clothes to wear.  As the order was going to take a while to complete the group headed out to the local book store, Tail's Tale, as Harridan picked up some books on both Veela and Vampires since he was a hybrid of both as well as some books on the Wizengamot as pertained to Creatures.  Still, having some time before his clothes were done Harridan was treated to lunch from his Dominant while Severus had him try a delicacy that was well-liked by Vampires.
“That first year I was disturbed that Granger constantly outperformed all of us Purebloods, and I despised how much attention you constantly stole from the rest of us. We were basically invisible! Then the years progressed, Granger still came out on top, you still garnered all the attention, but I saw everyone turn against you multiple times over misunderstandings and jealousy. I stopped being jealous of you after the Triwizard Tournament final task conclusion, when I realized that your life wasn’t your own, but was being controlled by both sides of the war. However, I still never liked you or Dumbledore, and Sally felt the same. When seventh year rolled around, and the Dark Lord was murdering people for being Muggle-borns, I finally made my decision on which side I was. I still believed that Muggle-borns were beneath pure-bloods, but any drop of magical blood spilled is a waste; so I turned away from my father’s teachings, that constantly spilt precious magical blood.”
“Severus Snape? Blimey, that name sounds familiar. I think I remember going to school with you, and being a bit of a prat. Sorry about that. I wish I could remember why I was awful to you so I can properly apologize. I swear that’s the truth, and I’m not just saying it because I’m after the temporary professor job.”
Harry woke up and stared at the canopy of his bed for longer than normal, not entirely believing that this was his last day as a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry felt both happy and sad about it, Hermione or Draco would know the word for how he was feeling. Although he would no longer be a student, he was desperately hoping to come back the next year as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, but for that to happen he would need at least three N.E.W.T.S. He swallowed the feeling of anxiety over the thought of the N.E.W.T.S. He believed he did well on them, but he was admittedly distracted by one thing or another all year and did not study as much as Hermione or Draco.
“Mr. Harry, sir? My friend said you were the one who fought in a war last year, is he right?” Harry blinked at this tiny blonde girl before slowly nodding. “Oh good, I thought he tricked me again. My parents don’t have magic, so I don’t really know a lot of things and the kids keep making fun of me for it.” She looked down at her shoes with tears in her eyes, but then took a calming breath. “Professor Hartley makes fun of me more than the rest of the class too, so I’m scared to ask him for help. So I thought you might be able to help me, because I’m having a really hard time understanding werewolf bites, and it’s only the first thing we’ve learnt. Can you help me, please?”
“Thanks, Draco.” Draco looked at Potter. It was the first time the tan boy had called Draco by first name. They were starting to be friendly, sure; it was hard not to when Draco spent hours around the boy. Potter seemed to realize this too, and blushed.
Harry was furious, and sick by the betrayal. He wanted to yell, break things, and cry. He knew that wouldn’t help right now, and he still had unanswered questions.
“It’s been working so far. Also we should really start pushing for inter-house unity.” Harry had interjected, and Zabini raised his eyebrows and scoffed. The war had caused the Slytherin to stop being as arrogant and smug, but he still had traits that made him come across as an arsehole. Harry shot an angry look at Zabini, and the boy raised his hands instead of retaliating.
“He helped look for you, but when we received word of where you were, he left. We don’t know where he went.” Harry nodded quietly, but on the inside he was screaming.
“To eventually be the Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Once she learns that you are from the States, she’ll probably try to become your favourite student.”
Two days later, after Teddy had been dropped at Andy’s around noon, Harry looked at his pile which consisted of ten applicants and growled. It should be easy to cull two, but all ten of them had already passed a multitude of tests. An hour later, Harry finally only had eight applicants. It was time to start calling, and that would be wonderful if it wasn’t two in the afternoon on a Friday. He would probably need to call some of these people tomorrow, and he sincerely hoped they wouldn’t be upset over receiving a call on a Saturday.
“I needed to cover my tracks since a few people already believed James and Lily to be dead. So I cast a potent memory charm on James and Lily, set them up with a flat and money in the United States, and placed more charms to keep them from wanting to come back here. The charms were never supposed to fail, even with my death, so I don’t understand why the charms are failing now.”
Harry’s roommates went to bed earlier tonight than they had, so Harry slipped out of bed for the seventh night in a row a little earlier, and put on his cloak, hissing as it brushed against fresh cuts from earlier that evening. He walked down to the common room and looked around for Malfoy; when he didn’t see the boy, Harry silently rejoiced. Finally, Malfoy had decided to go to bed early or expected Harry to leave at midnight, and Harry rushed through the door. He made his way to the fifth floor and into the abandoned classroom, and went to pull off his cloak. He drew his wand out and said the incantation for the cutting curse. He watched the blood start to drip down his arm and slightly smiled.
James chuckled, and Severus looked at Dumbledore’s portrait. The former headmaster looked sorrowful, and Harry felt his anger start to rise.
“Are you serious? Why are you being so nice to him? He kept Death Eaters out of Azkaban!” Harry heard George saying this with so much venom, that Harry almost thought it wasn’t George. Ron instantly paled, and tried to drag Harry out of hearing range; Harry felt cold as he realized the venomous words were about him.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harry ran down the corridor feeling tears cascade down his face, a lump in his throat that made it difficult for him to catch his breath, and his heart continuously shattering from the argument he had with Draco. His thoughts were racing around his mind wildly, making it difficult for him to focus on one. He ran without direction, without seeing his surroundings, without care for his fellow students that were surely around him. He ran and ran.
“She can look at them too. I’m sure between the five of us we can find a way to unravel Dumbledore’s charms.”
Three weeks after the Hogwarts letters were distributed, Harry sat outside the Burrow. It was the day before his birthday, but Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had an event the next day and they wanted to celebrate Harry’s birthday. A week and a half ago, Mrs. Weasley marched into Harry’s house and demanded he come to his birthday celebration dinner the day before his birthday, which Harry instantly protested. Harry tried to convince Mrs. Weasley not to cook a dinner and celebrate, but she just clucked her tongue and ignored him. Then she started on him about being too skinny and looking unhealthy, and Harry quickly changed the subject.
“My mother expects me back at the Manor, but I do not wish to spend my holiday break there. I wish she would sell the place and move to somewhere habitable.”
“Harry splinched himself, but Hermione healed him. It looks dreadful up there, and he would hate for you to see it, Mum. He’s going to be fine, though. Probably will sleep for a bit, so it wouldn’t do any good going up there.”
Harry watched the fourth year chuckle over the conversation he was having with the hat, and the hat shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”
Harry was surprised by Snape’s question, and had to think of his answer. “I’m not entirely sure, sir, but I do not believe I want to be an auror. I have spent enough time chasing dark wizards as it is.” Snape raised his eyebrow, and Harry cringed a bit that his joke fell flat.
He slipped into the bed by Draco, who rolled over and brushed his bangs away from his face. Harry grabbed his husband’s hand and thought of telling him about the phone call. Draco had seen Harry at his lowest, and always wanted to help him before another plummet. Harry kissed his husband’s hand, and let it fall. There was no reason to bother Draco with this, as it was unlikely to cause further issues.
The night after Hermione got her results almost every single Pureblood or Halfblood student sent an owl to their folks most telling their families about the hidden relationship between Dumbles and the toad. With a few exceptions as Fred wrote to Arthur and George wrote to Remus telling the two to go to Gringotts to take an Inheritance Test and possible cleansing. As well as a congratulation message to Percy for getting mated to Oliver Wood as they shared their courting to Blaise and a copy of the results of their potion. Draco meanwhile shared a copy of both the twin's results, with their permission, as well as Hermione's to his parents knowing his father would share the connection between the headmaster and Umbridge to the Minister.
"There is nothing to worry about Susan," Minerva said giving the young Hufflepuff girl a smile. "No student's magic affected the wards at all we did that to make sure all the students got tested by the Goblins."
Seeing shadow come from the underbrush and lower its head to the unicorn's neck to drink from the wound Draco could not help but let out a terrified scream. Turning on his heel Draco took off after Fang. "What the hell was that Potter?" Draco asked turning from the great boarhound retreating backside to look at Potter, only to see that the other boy was not there. "Oh hell, don't tell me," Draco said casting a look over his shoulder expecting to see the Gryffindor trying to battle against the shadow. Once more the blonde found himself to be mistaken as he sees Harry curled up before the approaching shadowy figure, his hands clutching his head as if in pain. While Draco hated that Harry had spurned his friendship in favor of the Blood Traitor Weasely, he could not let the shadow reach the B0y-Who-Lived. "Alright Draco, it is no big deal just some random dark shadow who had killed a Unicorn and is about to reach Potter," Draco said trying to psych himself up. "Probably going to die or get hurt, assuredly get dirty, but people will know I did it to save Potter after he was abandoned by that bloody groundskeeper."
"I want to look up information on how to transform into my Animagus form," Harridan said leaning further into Draco's body.
"Steady there Potter," Lucius said as prevented Harry from falling on his face as the sound of running feet could be heard.
"For what?: the woman asked in an innocent voice that reminded Harry of the voice his cousin would use at school when he got caught bullying others.
"What type of magic is that?" Draco asked semi rhetorical not really expecting an answer from the oaf.
"Unfortunately, no I was not allowed," the young woman who had been introduced to him as Quistis Heartilly.
"Very well let's just get this over with," Draco said as he allowed Granger to help him after the oaf of a gamekeeper. He knew that he would have been fine if he had gone to the Slytherin dorms for his injury would have been read by the special Charms Professor Snape cast at the start of the year to register if any of member of the House got hurt outside of class or Quidditch. The Charm was in place due to thanks to Dumbledore's very anti-Slytherin views some members of the other Hogwarts Houses bullied Slytherins if they left the dorms by themselves. Though as he thought about it there might not actually be help waiting in the dorms for him due to the lateness of the hour the report of his injury might not yet be noticed.
Harry took his seat between his new Guardians as Elmblossom passed over the ring that had arrived during the ritual. The pair of Goblins had a quick conversation in their native language as the ring was passed over. "Well Heir Potter, Elmblossom tells me it was a good thing we summoned your stolen property through the ritual which has an automatic cleansing involved for it appeared that the Gaunt Lordship ring had a very nasty enchantment which if you had collected it in person would have killed you if you had put it on," Bonecrusher said. "It is perfectly safe to wear now as are all of your other Rings. All you have to do is to put them on one at a time where it will test your Magic among other things. If the Ring accepts you it will adjust to your finger otherwise it will slide right off. When you come of age your Heirship Rings will automatically shift into their Lordship counterparts. When that happens all you have to do is to move them to the finger where you decided your Lordship rings will be worn on. Now while you are firstly a member of the Potter family which would usually mean that is the first Ring you would try out since your test listed you as gaining the Slytherin and Gaunt line through Rite of Conquest they will test you first," Bonecrusher said pushed over the two Rings with the symbol of Ouroboros on them one emerald green the other one black. Almost as soon as Harry placed them on the ring finger of his left hand they adjusted themselves showing they had accepted him. The Potter family ring, Harry saw, was made of solid gold with a symbol of a lion on it, while Gryffindor which Harry thought would have the lion symbol had a sword etched into the silver surface of the ring. The Peverell ring was a pure black metal that Harry could not identify and had a symbol that made him think of the Muggle depiction of Death with its hood up. Once more the Rings accepted him as to Harry's surprised when the last Ring settled into place the two sets of rings merged into a single Heirship and Lordship Ring. Unknown to Harry, or anyone with the possible exception of Bonecrusher, as soon as Harry's had merged and settled into place a spark of magic was released.
"In our First-Year he challenged Harry," she began only for everyone around her apart from Dumbles and the Fletchers correct her with "Harridan." She just ignored them as she continued, "To a Duel yet he never showed up."
"Well, there are some people in all cores the believe that their core, in particular, is the right core and try to either outlaw or place limits of people with core other than their own."
"As you are still an Heir and not Lord of your family lines yet I can assume that the vault you have gone to so far is the Potter Heir Vaults.  Your man family vaults hold a lot more money and items in them and you are actually connected and in line to inherit, more than just the Potters.  That is another reason for the test so I can find out which vaults you have access to.  Now as you have already undergone a Medical report we can skip that part of the test but I think it is best to add as much information as we can for everything else we can find out," Bonecrusher said as he pulled out a silver goblet which contained specks of Gold and some red material inlaid in it, as well as a short blade.  "Now I am aware we just fixed you up as best we could so this might seem a little strange but I am going to need you to make a small cut in your wand hand and let four drops of blood fall into the goblet," the Goblin said pushing over the goblet and blade.  Harry was not so sure but saw Charity giving him a small nod to show it was alright.  Finding himself trusting her for what she had done to get him away from the Dursleys, he lifted the blade to his right palm and made a small cut.  He was a little surprised when he did not feel any pain as he held his sliced palm over the cup and let the four drops of blood fall into it.  Almost as soon as the last drop landed there was a flash of purple-ish light and his palm looked like it had done before he had cut it.  Harry marveled at this bit of magic wondering if he could learn it so he did not see what actually was done to produce the results of his test until he felt something tap against his right elbow.  Looking up he saw Bonecrusher holding out a roll of parchment to him with another smile.  Gulping Harry took the roll of parchment and began to read it.
"You may not have love as if looking to become boyfriend or something or maybe even friends but you care for him," Granger said.
"Oh, that it was a Muggle jiggle called "I Wish I Was An Oscar Meyer Weiner," Harry whispered back with a slight blush.
"Wait you are the Heir so it was you who kicked everyone out of Grimmauld Place," Fred said only for his eyes to widen as he realized he had given the name of the place.
"Dear Merlin," Professor McGonagall said as Sprout but a hand to her mouth seeing the man's second face.
As he started to put the items he was keeping back into his trunk he thought of Luna's word of warning about Ron and Ginny again as he recalled Ginny having dug through his trunk last year to find Riddle's diary. Feeling thankful that he was still at Hogwarts Harry used his wand to add a hidden compartment in the lid of his trunk before stashing both his Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder's Map inside before he sealed it up. Thinking it might be a good idea to have a way to open the compartment back up through some Muggle means Harrison created a small almost invisible catch on the bottom of the false lid that he could adjust to gain access to the hidden area. He managed to do it just in time for as soon as he locked the new compartment back up the door opened and Ron entered grumbling letting Harrison hear him complaining about Hermione browbeating him to pack up. Ron proved Luna's assessment of his was right as he pulled out his wand and just magiced everything into his trunk all higgeldy-piggeldy before plopping down onto his bed and reading a comic book. Harrison ignored the semi-nasty looks Ron was sending him over the comic as Harrison spent time actually organize everything in his trunk filing the books away by subject, year, and alphabetically for easy access when he would use them during his summer homework.
"Are you really going to eat all that?" Harry asked as two large full plates of food appeared before the blonde.
"I second that," Filius said wondering if that was why some of his students were having trouble in the last couple of years. He wondered if Harry had found out about a missing text, which could explain his improvement over the last couple of weeks.
"I just don't get it why would you be interested in me, if your creature is not leading you to me?" Pansy asked.
Harry did see that unlike what he recalled both Alpha and Omegas had Scent Glands which would only really emerge when they found their partner, and they would always appear on a Magicals neck so even if he had somehow gained Scent Glands he could not use their presence to determine if he was an Alpha or Omega. A hint of how he could determine his role came in the next chapter when the book talked about finding a partner. It stated that an Omega would always be drawn to a person that to their nose was able to detect a smell that reminded them of home. The book also pointed out that if there were multiple Omegas smelling the same person each of them would detect a different scent from the first one. While not a clue to his role the book also went on to explained that both Alphas and Omegas would only get pleasant scents from the gender that they were attracted to. Reading this Harry bite his lip seeing that at least was correct for given the choice he would rather end up dating a male than a female, and apart from Hermione, who he saw as a friend and the two members of staff he had come across all females he smelled had made him almost sick. The book had even helped explain this saying that in most Institutions and workplaces it was mandatory for people in positions of power to cast spells that no matter how attractive an Omega or Alpha found their gender the scent would be as close to neutral as it could be. Unfortunately, the book did not list the spell so Harry was unable to cast it on something that he could use to block out unwelcome scents.
As he moved away from Draco, Harry wrapped the borrowed cloak tightly around himself, not only for Draco's scent it was giving off but also to make the Slytherin Crest that was inside a fold of the item. "Early morning, Harry?" Hermione asked as he took a seat beside her.
Harry was shocked at the question not only for its own sake but for it was the second time Snape had stated his mother's name. "No, I would rather just be left alone yet each year something seems to happen that forces me to act."
"Very well, do you mind if I call Elves away from their normal assignments to watch out for him, as I see you plan to live at this property?" the elder Elf asked.
"I am, not mistaken Lord Prince for while your mother was cast out of the Prince family for her marrying to your father. Your Grandfather Eli made you his Heir shortly before he passed. I know you once knew this as we have records of you taking up the Lordship rings before your marriage," Bonecrusher said looking to other Goblin for confirmation.
"If one actually looked into when this place was built they would actually find that it was created just shortly after the "ghouls and sprites" moved in which would be against all their natures since those types of creatures prefer buildings that have been inhabited for a while before they move in," George said taking Blaise's hand and leading him further into the abandoned house.
"So does that mean since I am Heir to seven lines I would be a member of the Wizengamot when I get older?" Harry asked.
"He does not," Lucius said making Harry start as he had been only focusing on Draco and his wings he had forgotten that anyone else was in the room.
"I think I am ready to tell you about myself," Harry said who had been thinking about the trust Draco has shown him with the story about the curse that had affected his mother.
"I would like to point out that if you had turned in your original draft you would have gotten a mid-ranked EE," Draco said. "I am surprised Professor Snape did not see this when you are in your specialty lessons with him."
"Well, Mr. Malfoy was it Professor Quirrell who had been hurting the Unicorns?" the Headmaster asked as he and the four Heads of House turning to him.
"What is all this then?" a new voice said as someone else entered the room making Harry gasp in pain as he reached up and touched his scar. That was the only way he could tell the newcomer was Voldemort as the man no longer resembled the snake-like man he had met in the Graveyard at the end of last year. Rather the man before him had dark brown hair that had been pulled up into a ponytail with eyes that were no longer slits though they still had the red irises and his nose was still there. Gulping in fear Harry buried his face into Draco's robes hoping if the end came it would at least be quick. "Draco?" Voldemort said in a questioning tone.
"Well anyway unlike when he went after people with different cores people actually started to vote against people with creature blood forcing some creatures like Vampires, Werewolves, and Draks to go into hiding," Lucius said. "Now it is around this time that Tom enters the Wizengamont representing the Houses of Gaunt but also Slytherin and begins to work against Dumbles in his campaign against creatures and those with Dark Cores since the man had been slipping in some of his bills into some that he knew would not be voted against. Tom almost single-handed puts a stop to it which led to Dumbledore starting a smear campaign against him. Stating some cock and bull story about how his time working for Borgan and Burks he had been responsible for killing one Hepzibah Smith a decedent of Helga Hufflepuff even though there was a lot of proof that the woman's old House Elf had accidentally put a dash of nutmeg in her tea, which the woman was deathly allergic to. He also claimed that Tom was in league with a werewolf by the name of Shagrat Vanteh and had planned several Werewolf attacks that had turned people. I can tell you for a fact that this is not true the one werewolf that Tom has ever been in league with was and is Fenrir Grayback who had been a part of Shagrat's pack and having seen what a horrible being Shagrat was had moved to overthrow him."
"No doubt, poncy prick," Ron said in agreement. Harry forced himself to laugh along with his friend while being unable to look at the Slytherin table and finding Draco eat his breakfast. Almost as if the blonde Alpha could sense him looking turned to look catching Harry's eye and lifting his morning drink as if toasting him causing Harry to blush a little.
"Yup we found out both of us had been under various spells and Potions so were both purged over the summer," he said.
"By order of the House Prewett if you try to break the Dueling Contract that had been set forth you shall be cast out of the Prewett line and cut off from the family's magic," the twins said in unison before turning on their heels and leaving the platform to spend the rest of the day with Blaise.
* Hermione's third parent had no part in her birth so does not get listed as family titles but her magic helped ground Hermione during her birth just like Severus did for Lily as she gave birth to Harry and Tom did for Narcissa with Draco.
"If I was to guess he did not approve of my third parents," Harridan stated stopping the wolf in his tracks.
"Good use it and I will let you see.... well the truth," Snape said finding strength as he lifted himself out of the chair and pointed his wand at Harry. Doing what the man had asked him to do Harry cast Protego and found himself seeming to zoom into the Potion Master's mind.
grade for his paper, but as he was putting it away he heard Hermione let out an annoyed grunt. Looking over at her, Harry easily saw that her homework had been marked with an
On the day of the Hogsmead visit Harridan and Draco only visited the Magical Village to provide a distraction so Fred, George, and Blaise could meet up with the twin's parents to travel to Gringotts. Not wanting Ronald, Ginevra, and Hermione to ruin their entire day so after the group of mates had sent them a signal they used the crowds at Honeydukes to make a break for it. Harridan was rather glad that while he had once told his former friends that there was a passage between the sweet shop and Hogwarts he had never given them the specifics of its location allowing Draco and him to get away.
"What is so funny Blue Jay?' Draco asked, hoping to get Harry to come out of his wings a little more.
"Apparate?" Harry asked in confusion as Mr. Malfoy took out a pouch from his robes and threw some dust into the fireplace within Madam Pomfrey's office.
"It could be a reason you came here," Draco said making Harry look up at the blonde as for the first time in his memory did not have a condescending smirk on his face.
"Well due to how young you both are not at the moment but as you grow older you may find you can share some surface thoughts and feelings with each other, as well as possibly finding the same person or type of people attractive," Bonecrusher said. Both Harry and Draco blushed a little at this thinking that they did not see that happening though neither wanting to share that they preferred men to the other boy.
"Um sure. I would also check to see if Granger is doing that in any other classes you have with her," Draco suggested.
"I did nothing Ms. Granger," Professor Snape said reaching for her scroll and reading from it. "It seems that you had a Multi-layered Glamor which changed both your looks but also your voice and was cast by." Rather than saying the name out loud, he arched an eyebrow at the scroll that listed the change that had come from the girl's own mother, Dolores Umbridge.
Draco woke up the next morning from his sound sleep to the sound of a shout from his roommates.  As his body woke up fully he became aware of something really snuggled up to his chest.  Blinking the sleep out of his eyes Draco looked down only to see Harry Bloody Potter asleep curled up against him.  Though the scent he had been smelling was coming off his messy-haired rival Draco could not stop himself from calling out, "Bloody Hell Potter what are you doing here?  While Harry had not shown signs of being awake before that moment hearing Draco's voice caused his eyes to shot open in alarm.  Harry immediately pulled away from his face to take on a startled look as he fell off the edge of the bed.  Draco could not help but wince as he heard the other crash to the floor, but to his shock made no sound of pain from it.
There was no changing it now, though, as they had taken the exams the week prior. The results would come in the middle of July, and he would go from there. Pushing himself up and out of bed with that thought, Harry stood staring at the dorm room he had shared with Blaise and Michael Corner all year. They all had packed the night before, so the room was empty. Harry briefly wondered what would happen with the eighth year rooms after this year, and then thought Snape probably had an idea of what he was going to do with them. The new headmaster was trying to repair faith in the school, and Harry thought that Snape would probably succeed in whatever he did for the repairs. He had told Harry of a couple of his ideas for better inter-house unity, and they were brilliant.
Zabini sounded exasperated, but that was probably due to his inability to charm Granger; he had always been able to charm any girl or boy he wished in the past. Draco had not been making progress in talking to Thomas, the Gryffindor boy he had thought would be easiest to overcome their rivalry; the boy just sneered at him each time Draco walked towards him.
Harry snorted, and highly doubted that even the threat of Azkaban would keep Snape from being a bully or showing favoritism. However, Harry thought it would be a little fun to watch and see the year play out.
“Potter, if you’re going to stare at me, please don’t think so loudly. It’s distracting.” Harry blushed and looked down quickly, which made Draco laugh. Harry looked up at him and glared, but Draco didn’t notice since he had buried his head in his homework again. Harry looked back down to his homework and wanted to sigh; Draco constantly being in the library meant that Harry no longer waited until the weekend to do all of his homework, but it was boring doing homework every day.
“Well you still need to be alive to accept the apprenticeship. Talk to Harry, quit one of the activities you’re doing for him; he won’t be upset.”
He was surprised to hear footsteps coming in shortly after Draco’s, and looked up to see Lily walk in. She waved at them, and was also already dressed for the day. She never woke up this late, as Ollivander required her to be at his shop before sunrise. She was enjoying her apprenticeship already, and Harry was happy for her. She took a seat at the table with the food Kreacher and Dobby had made. Shortly after her, Pansy walked down, and Harry was stunned. Pansy never woke up this early, and Harry started wracking his brain for the reason she was already up. Neville and Blaise walked in right behind Pansy, which made Draco raise his eyebrow at the pair; Neville predictably blushed and Blaise grinned.
After practice, Draco had a good idea of who his teammates were. There was Marcus Flint, of course, who was the captain and very aggressive chaser. Flint liked to cheat. A lot. Flint boasted that he was Hooch’s least favorite captain because she knew he was cheating at times but couldn’t bust him for it. Could she really be upset that he was just showing off his Slytherin traits? There was also Adrian Pucey, who was their second chaser. He liked to cheat just as much as Flint which is why there were best friends. He was an older brother which was why he liked to check in on Draco from time to time during their practice to make sure he was feeling alright.
That night, when the school was finally at ease now that the werewolf threat had been taken care of, Draco dreamed of the man he somehow knew was Fenrir Greyback. The wolf leered over him with a terrifying grin, threatening to tear Draco limb from limb, before Narcissa Malfoy appeared and whispered a spell that covered both of them in his bloody remains. When he woke up the next day, he had tears in his eyes and more questions than answers. How did he know who Fenrir Greyback was if he never met him before?
And then there was their third chaser, August Rowle. He was the only member that Draco didn’t get along with. He avoided Draco like the plague and Draco was all too happy to do the same. Miles Bletchley, their keeper, talked to Draco a bit and instructed him on the signal that he would send to him to catch the snitch. The two of them got along well enough. He was friendly. But Draco couldn’t help but side eye him from time to time because he was one of the few people close to Diggory. The last were two brothers, Hakim and Hamid Shafiq, who were brothers and their beaters. They had plenty of muscle and their constant back and forth reminded him of the Weasley twins he met on the train. They were oddly fun to be around.
“Blimey, there really won’t be a dull moment with you three around.” Blaise shook his head and chuckled, focusing on his textbook. Theo rolled his eyes and did the same.
The moment the bludger was released, things quickly got intense. A flurry of different colors raced around the pitch as they all scrambled to get points. Draco did his best to hold in a laugh seeing Flint pretend he was going to slam into the chasers to throw them off their game, managing to gain them some points with a perfect hit to one of the goals.
Draco closed his eyes and focused as well, doing his best to think about it. If it wasn’t money they were hiding, then what was it? He supposes that not just money has to be in a vault at Gringotts. A variety of family heirlooms of jewelry could be stored there if requested. And the article didn’t specifically mention money from what he read. Just that someone broke in. Maybe they weren’t aiming for money but for something else. But what?
Draco snorted as the half-giant sputtered in surprise, carefully placing down his teacup on the table. “Why are yeh lot snooping around there? McGonagall told yeh not to.”
“Oh, we went to the third-floor corridor by accident and almost mauled by a giant three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor. Happens to everyone, I imagine.” Greg explained quickly before he focused back on his poster. The two boys looked at the three of them in shock. Daphne ducked her head, hiding a laugh, while Draco just focused back on his book.
Draco thought to himself. Draco did his best to get control of his broom but it wouldn’t move in any direction that he wanted. It almost seemed like it wanted to buck him off of it. He was sent zooming past Cedric and then Rowle who he could hear snarl at him despite the wind whipping past him. Bloody hell, he was going to die by a rogue broom. What a way to go.
Draco stopped and turned towards the sound of the voice that called his name. And at that very moment, his heart stuttered at the sight of a boy. He wasn’t all that much older than Draco, probably a second or third year, but he was still very handsome. His brown hair looked like it had been recently windswept; his Hufflepuff yellow tie was loosened just a bit as it rested outside of his uniform instead of tucked inside. “You walk quickly, you know.” He said with a teasing smile.
A warm feeling fluttered in his stomach when he looked towards the table where the staff usually ate. McGonagall sat there, a rare sight since she was usually in her office, and gave him a gentle smile before she raised her goblet to him. Draco mouthed a quick thank you before he looked back to Greg and Daphne. They were smiling brightly, an aura of proudness coming off of them. Blaise had drifted closer to them then, inspecting the broom himself while Nott did his best not to look interested.
When everyone was gathered in the Great Hall for breakfast, Draco sat with Greg and Daphne away from the other Slytherins as they discussed last night’s events. The three of them occasionally shot glares at Potter from their spot away from him but he didn’t seem to be aware of them looking at him. It was taking everything in Draco’s willpower not to go over there and throttle him.
“You lot,” Black grunted. “Fifty points from Slytherin for separating from the group during an emergency. Now get out of here before I deduct more.”
“Oh, Hagrid, we know about that dog in the third-floor corridor.” He said innocently. “Can you tell us what that’s about it?”
“Can’t believe this is the last thing I’m going to be doing with myself,” Zabini mumbled. “I haven’t even reached my prime.”
“Poor Brown,” Daphne, who was partnered with him, said as she leaned in to get a bit of a closer look. “Nott didn’t need to embarrass her like that.”
“She’ll be fine. She’s a witch, isn’t she? She doesn’t need to be babysat by someone who is too poor to afford new robes.” Nott said before he walked away, his nose high in the air. Draco snorted, earning a hard elbow to the ribs by Daphne before they all left for the Great Hall.
Draco quickly followed after him, imagining the feeling of how nice it must feel to fly in a Quidditch uniform.
“Thank goodness,” Theo leaned back in his seat as he stretched. “Let’s hope they give him the Dementor’s Kiss.”
As November began, whispers spread throughout Hogwarts about the Hallowe’en Werewolf Incident. Only the five Slytherins (and one Lavender Brown) knew what happened that night but they promised to never tell. The answer as to how Greyback got into the castle was not known but he had been arrested and was awaiting trial to be sent to Azkaban.
“But what is he doing here?” Daphne wondered. “Who could have let a known Death Eater in the school?”
“Alright, Draco, you remember the signal?” Flint asked. “Keep your eye on Bletchley as much as you can. A nod of the head and a wink. And only go after it if Diggory has spotted it, alright?”
Draco swallowed and nodded, pushing down the urge to vomit all over the handsome boy who didn’t seem to hate him at all. “That’s true. I was on my way to practice now, actually.”
But just then, Professor Black came into the bathroom with his wand drawn. He looked at the concerning scene that was a group of first years surrounded by a (hopefully) dying werewolf. His eyes immediately landed on Draco.
Students immediately began mumbling. Sirius Black stood up. “Students, calm down! Prefects, please lead your students to their dormitories! Look after your first years” He yelled. Fawley and Rosier quickly stood up and began ushering all of them up out of their seats so they could leave.
“You are getting so many dates after this. Save some for the rest of us, eh?” And that couldn’t be anyone else but Blaise.
“Don’t bugger it up for us, Malfoy.” Rowle sneered before he purposely bumped into Draco, walking off to do god knows what.
“Hey, let’s focus!” Daphne snapped her fingers in front of Draco’s face, drawing his attention back to the group. “You’re the one who wanted to speculate about what was under that trapdoor. So let’s speculate!”
“All teams, gather in the center, and get ready to mount your brooms.” Jordan’s voice echoed throughout the pitch over the crowd. The Slytherins walked in a unit, their captain upfront as they came face to face with the Hufflepuffs. Draco leaned to the side from his position in the back to get a good look at Cedric, who noticed him and waved. Draco pushed down those butterflies in his stomach and looked at the two captains instead.
“Be safe, Draco. Keep an eye out for jinxes,” Daphne hugged him tightly, strands of her dirty blonde hair tickling his cheek. When she pulled back and Greg got closer, she shot the lumbering boy a glare. “Oh, no you don’t. We aren’t going with him.
Draco tipped his broom down and raced towards it, his hand outstretched and ready to take it into his hand.
“No thank you. As much as I’d love to, my friends would kill me if I left them here while I had the time of my life.”
They all eventually come to a stop in front of the girls’ bathroom. Draco took a deep breath and pushed open the door, all five of them coming face to face with the towering figure of a creature that seemed oddly familiar to him.
“I was enjoying the tea. Thanks a lot, you three.” Theo huffed. But they ignored him as one question filled their minds.
The two boys ran past Greyback and stood in front of her, their wands drawn. Greyback got on his haunches and swiped at Draco who rolled out of the way just in time.
The Slytherins walked over and Draco suddenly felt like the shortest guy there. Actually, wait, he was the shortest guy there. Were all Slytherins unnaturally big or was he just missing a growth spurt? Greg was taller than him but he was bigger than Draco in many different ways. The only Slytherin he knew that was shorter than him was Daphne. Oh Merlin, he really did need to start drinking more milk like Regulus suggested. He doesn’t know how he would be able to cope if he ended up somehow being shorter than even Potter who he currently had about an inch or two over.
As usual, Draco ripped up the letter but his mood significantly was soured. He was hoping that he would be able to invite Daphne and Greg over for the holidays. They could officially meet Regulus, be shocked that he was alive, and then they could enjoy Christmas together. Maybe he wouldn’t even have to go all out for Daphne’s gift. Her hounding Regulus with questions would surely make her Christmas an amazing one.
He shared the chocolates at breakfast with Greg, Daphne, and Blaise. Nott was welcome to have some too but the boy seemed to be determined to separate himself from Draco. The day proceeded without much fanfare, the occasional student jumping out to scare a couple of first years to get into the Hallowe’en spirit. Charms class proved to be as awful as Draco expected. Draco hated Wingardium Leviosa. He was so close to completing it but it seemed, no matter what, he could not lift the feather all the way up off the ground. Was it his wand? Was it him?
Back at it again with a new chapter. Thank you so much for the positive comments on the last chapter!
All of a sudden, his broom came to a sudden stop nearly sending Draco off of it. The entire crowd gasped and held their breath. Draco held his breath too, his eyes shut tight before he slowed opened them. And that is when he saw the fluttering golden ball that held his team’s victory. The Golden Snitch.
“Complete and utter accident, we promise,” Draco spoke up before Daphne could expose their late night duel attempt. “Sorry to spring this on you, Hagrid, but we really want to have answers. It’s important.”
“Don’t mention it, Malfoy. I just thought it would be a shame if you died. You do owe me a life debt for this, you know,” And then, Nott smiled. Nott actually smiled. He never thought he’d see the day that Nott smiled at him. “And, by the way, you can call me Theo. If you want.”
Cedric held out his hand for Draco which Draco accepted, getting up on his feet before being bombarded by his friends.
A dog-like yelp was heard as Greyback was sent sideways. The werewolf clutched his side as the water turned red with blood, whining in pain. Draco looked towards the voice that shouted, surprised to see Theodore Nott with his wand pointed at the beast with a terrified look on his face. The two of them stared at each other, both of them sharing a look. He still can’t believe that Theodore Nott just saved his life without expecting anything in return.
“If you say so, Draco. But I will be keeping a close eye on him.” Daphne huffed. “I don’t like the way he treats you.”
“Boys, shake hands to show sportsmanship. I want a clean game.” Madam Hooch said. The two captains shook hands before they walked away to opposite sides of the field, mounting their brooms. Draco followed the rest of the team’s lead and did the same, flying high into the air. It was a different feeling being high in the air with the stands full, people cheering for the chosen house they’re supporting. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, reeling in his nerves. He would absolutely not bugger things up. He would bring the team to victory and shove it in Rowle’s stupid face.
“Hey, I know!” Greg sang. “Why don’t we ask Hagrid about that dog thing we saw in the corridor? Greyback was most likely after whatever is down there.”
After class, Brown ran out of the classroom in tears. Weasley glared at Nott, claiming that it was his fault while Potter glared at Draco as if he’s responsible for Nott’s actions.
Oohs echoed with the rest of the team as Bletchley came back to this, red in the face. Diggory seemed amused. He waved goodbye to Bletchley and then Draco before he took his leave. “C’mon, you little house traitor. We need you in your best shape. The goals can’t Keep themselves.” Flint said, throwing his arm around Bletchley.
He listened to him talk and talk and talk. He almost felt like he could look at him all day. He was completely entranced. He hadn’t even realized that they arrived at the Quidditch pitch until Diggory came to a stop. “Here we are,” He then waved his arms, getting the attention of one of Flint. “I’ve got your seeker!” He announced.
“I’m a Nott. If I didn’t know a spell that could kill a man, could I really call myself a pureblood?” He shrugged.
“That’s right. I hear the Slytherins are going to be using the pitch for more time than usual since the change in positions was so sudden.” Diggory ran a hand through his hair. “D’you mind if I walk with you? I actually have a friend in Slytherin that I need to talk to anyways.”
The Greyback ice sculpture broke as the wolf freed himself, his harsh glare going towards Draco. He pounces. Draco can already see his own blood on wolf claws. The wizarding world would be without a Chosen One simply because he decided that he had to save Lavender Brown. Draco closed his eyes tightly, not wanting to stare down the jaws of the beast that was going to kill him.
“A werewolf in the bloody castle?” Greg groaned, taking one last handful of candy to take with him. “Are you kidding me? What a way to spend Hallowe’en.”
“I’m just glad to be alive. You guys were brilliant there, you know? Yelling out spells and stuff. I kind of just sat there the entire time.” He threw his arm around Daphne who rolled her eyes. “I’m glad to be friends with such amazing people who will protect me. Just don’t try and drag me into danger anymore.”
They didn’t have to be told twice. They all quickly filed out of the bathroom like their lives depended on it. Once they were far enough away, they all began talking at once.
“Oh, leave him alone. There are more pressing matters to worry about,” Daphne closed her book. “Does anyone else find Professor Black to be very suspicious?”
“Slytherin scores with a perfect tactic from Flint! Ohoho, but Madam Hooch is giving him a serious stink eye…”
Draco wordlessly nodded his head before he continued his journey to the Quidditch pitch, this time with the handsome Hufflepuff right by his side. Diggory talked on and on about how much he liked Quidditch but was quite nervous when he first started playing. Draco also learned that he was a third year and had plans on becoming a professional player for whichever team took him. Diggory apparently loved the Chudley Cannons and, surprisingly, that wasn’t something that threw Draco off immediately.
Harry glanced at the group of first years waiting for him in the classroom on the fifth floor which they had been using every Monday evening for the past three sessions of Defense Against the Dark Arts tutoring. That first Monday session Ida had showed up with five other classmates instead of two, and now there was a group of over twenty first years here. Apparently Ida had made signs for each of the common rooms because multiple second years, third years, fourth years, and fifth years had all approached Harry about setting up a study session for their year. Draco had been next to him during each of these requests and kept repeating “It’s just one meeting” while laughing.
spell, gently corrected a Slytherin girl named Tiffany’s homework, and explained what an Imp was more times than he could count. Draco was doing the same, but when the questions had started easing towards a more manageable level, he started doing his own homework. After an hour of tutoring, the first years started leaving the classroom, and only Tiffany was left. She looked like she wanted to say something, but was too scared to.
“I saw that, and if we start with this one, we should be able to remove the frayed one within four sessions. How long should we wait between sessions?”
Ron knew he hadn’t convinced his mom, but she reluctantly nodded. Then she talked about cleaning up the house, and cooking food for Harry while he was injured. Fleur and Mom left, but Dad, Charlie, and Bill stayed. They looked at him for a bit. Dad told Charlie and Bill to go home and help their mom; they hesitated a few seconds, but walked to the fireplace. His dad waited until he heard the floo roar twice, and then narrowed his eyes on Ron.
“Whatever happened last year is not Slytherin’s fault; it was all the action of one man, and his house stopped mattering once he left Hogwarts. Slytherins have just as much of a right to be here as everyone else; your house isn’t what makes you good or bad, it’s your actions.The hate between houses needs to stop, so maybe you and your classmates can be the start of Hogwarts wide inter-house unity.”
Ron couldn’t believe that Harry had just apparated being so emotional. He cursed and looked at his family. They were all shocked and pale, and Ron was sure he looked like that too. He summoned a blood replenishing potion, sure that his best mate had splinched himself. Then he apparated to number 12 Grimmauld Place, with Hermione following close behind him.
Harry and Draco both looked at each other, and Harry saw excitement in the blonde boy’s eyes. However, Harry might have been projecting his own feelings onto his friend; for the first time in months Harry was excited, and he wanted to start right away. He then realized that he enjoyed tutoring and helping others learn, but it was different from the feeling he had gotten after a DA session. Harry and Draco both looked back at Snape and nodded; Harry must have been imagining it because he thought he saw a ghost of a smile on the Headmaster’s lips.
The man continued talking, but Harry was no longer paying attention. His gut was full of ice, and his head was swimming. The only thought racing through his mind was,
“Do you believe it is a good idea, Ronald. Last time he was there did not end well.” Hermione shot a nervous look towards Harry, probably afraid that he would be sent into another bout of depression. Harry hoped she was wrong, but afraid she might be spot on in her worrying.
He walked into the eighth year common room and smiled when he saw Draco, sitting in front of the fire with Blaise and Pansy. He went over to his boyfriend and kissed him on the cheek; Draco looked over and smiled at him before kissing him lightly on the lips. “Morning, love,” Harry whispered. Draco smiled at Harry before kissing him again.
“I figured out the first strand that could begin unraveling the complicated spellwork. I want to ask the old coot though, before telling the Waller’s about it.”
“Well, I hope you’re not going to assume I want to share a compartment with a known Death Eater, Malfoy.” Draco felt his back straighten, and considered how he should proceed. Zabini had every right to not let Draco sit in this cabin once the Prefect meeting was done, but Draco knew that Zabini would probably be the only one who would even let him in their compartment.
After the interaction with Luna, Harry was shaken. He was sure his misery wasn’t too obvious, and he didn’t want to make this birthday celebration awkward after the Weasley’s had put so much effort into it. He couldn’t make his cloudiness disappear, but he was trying to hide it. However, hiding it was exhausting, and after only two hours, Harry was ready to sleep and hide again. He went upstairs and hid in Ron’s room until the dinner started, hoping Mrs. Weasley wouldn’t think he was being too rude.
She stood up and walked out of the compartment. He closed the doors behind her with a flick of his wand and used the second that gave him to bury his anger.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“That’s why I fear accepting the Hogwarts Healer position with Severus as the headmaster. He does not accept less than the best, and will never settle.” Draco crossed into the room and rubbed Harry’s tense shoulders. “Don’t forget that Teddy is coming over for a sleepover tomorrow, and Aunt Andromeda will probably drop him off in the morning.” Harry groaned; he had forgotten. “I’ll be at Mundo’s for the majority of the day, but I can bring dinner.”
He looked up as he heard someone call his name and sent his boyfriend a small smile trying desperately to hide the stress he was feeling. Harry smiled back and looked around the common room for anyone else before leaning down to kiss Draco. They hadn’t wanted to tell anyone about their relationship yet due to the tense atmosphere still surrounding the Slytherins.
Potter spoke up with that horribly raspy voice that probably hadn’t been used much lately, “I don’t want it.” Draco felt surprise at Potter being so bold, and wondered how Snape would react. Predictably his face clouded with fury as he narrowed his eyes at the boy.
He felt a hand between his shoulders and jerked out of their grasp; he wasn’t worthy of comfort, he was just a dirty freak who couldn’t even die right. The hand placed itself on Harry’s shoulder this time and pulled him into a hug, and Harry clung onto this person comforting him. Harry couldn’t tell how long it took him to stop crying, but the hand stroking up and down his back never stopped. Once his sobs quieted down enough, he heard soft whispers of “Harry, it’s going to be ok” and “That’s right, just let it out, Harry”.
Also, all of the N.E.W.T.S. and O.W.L.S. from last year were marked unqualified since Hogwarts was not teaching much last year. You will need as many N.E.W.T.S. as possible to find a job in the magical world, with your background, so I would advise you to go and ignore Slughorn and the rest of the haters. Prove you belong.
Draco had his Muggle Studies book in front of him at the table to study the subject while eating his breakfast; it was by far the subject he had the most difficulty in, followed by Transfiguration. He had a full schedule with Muggle Studies, Transfiguration, Arithmancy, Herbology, Charms, Defense Against the Dark Arts, History of Magic, Astronomy, and Potions coupled with his Prefect duties and six hour community service commitment, but Draco vowed to not allow his grades to drop. His sixth year performance was abysmal, and he had quite a bit of studying to do to ensure he received an O in each of the subjects. He had drafted a study chart the first day after he received his time table, and to accurately study he would be up until 1 in the morning every night. He was used to not sleeping, so he was glad to be using the time wisely.
“Well the git was hexing second years because of their house. There was no reason for that. If it had been fourth years or above, well who cares, they could defend themselves.” Longbottom looked slightly upset at that sentiment, but didn’t respond. Draco heard a female voice softly say, “Oh, Ronald.” Potter looked back into the compartment, then walked away. Longbottom watched Potter leave, and Draco heard a chorus asking where Potter was going. Longbottom looked back at the Slytherins and kindly said to the girl who had ran into the compartment, “Do you want me to walk you back to your friends? I’m heading for the lunch trolley, so it would be no bother.”
Sorry for all the comments I haven't responded to, but I promise I will. I love any comments. Thanks for reading!
“He grew up here, apparently. He fled to the States during the First Wizarding War with his wife, Lily.” Severus looked up sharply.
“Mr. Harry, sir. It’s me, Ida.” Harry jumped and looked at the tiny, blonde first year he had helped with her Defense homework a month ago. She was blushing again, and looked nervous. Harry smiled at her to reassure her. She took a deep breath and said, “I don’t understand my Defense homework again, and Professor Hartley isn’t any nicer to me.”
“That’s not healthy. You need to eat at least once a day, especially if you’re going to be playing Quidditch. I’ve read articles detailing the importance of eating, I’ll share them with you.” Draco reached into his bag and pulled out the Muggle health magazine he subscribes to. “There is actually a fascinating article about it in this issue.”
“My throat,” was all he could manage to get out. She raised her eyebrows at him and ushered him to a bed, where she ran a medical diagnosis on him. She took a sharp breath and looked at him, which made him look out a window. She then performed a quick wand movement and the soreness of throat and body disappeared; she walked away and came back with a blood-replenishing potion.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Draco glanced at Harry in shock, but quickly looked away. “That sounds lovely Harry. I will ask my mother if I can invite you to our Christmas Dinner; she will probably agree since her sister and your godson will be there. Mother reached out a month ago to mend the burned bridges there.” Then Draco looked down at their connected hands and turned bright red. Harry squeezed his hand again, and then let go. He walked to the doorway and looked over at Draco.
“I’ll try my best.” He hesitated before saying his next sentence, “You’re the second Lily to save my life.”
Harry celebrates his birthday with the Weasley's feeling better than he has in awhile. Then it all comes crashing down.
He locked the door and started sobbing. He drew out his wand and cast the curse to cut his wrist, knowing Kreacher wouldn’t know he was back before it was too late. Unfortunately, his sobbing made his hand shake and he wasn’t sure if he cut the vein. He cast the curse again, and again. Looking at the three bleeding cuts through the tears, Harry was finally satisfied that he had accomplished it. He passed out a few seconds later, with a slight smile on his face because he had finally set the universe right.
Harry chuckled with him, slightly uncomfortable as this was his second time alone face-to-face with his father. Harry was about to make an excuse to leave, but James beat him to talking.
Harry looked over at Draco, and thought that they wouldn’t agree on this point. He did understand where Draco was coming from, but he couldn’t believe that was the right decision. What if the Waller’s had children? Harry shook that thought away; it was too painful to imagine potential siblings that were raised by his parents.
Harry had to be imagining it, but he could have sworn Snape’s lips twisted up into amusement without the usual cruelty, “Indeed. I did not help inter-house unity as a Professor, but I am trying to redeem myself. I appreciate your pledge to help inter-house unity, Mr. Potter. There is one last matter I wish to discuss with you, which is your reluctance to join the school in the Great Hall. It might be beneficial for the school, and your classmates, to see you sitting next to Mr. Malfoy, however I believe your absence stems from a deeper issue. I know that Mr. Malfoy regularly asks Dobby to bring you food three times a day, but I also know you do not always eat.”
“Well, it seems like the Dark Lord’s goal will finally be completed by Potter’s mind and emotions.” Zabini said this softly. Draco and Pansy looked at him with confusion on their faces. He scoffed at them, and said, “Neither of you noticed the incredibly recent and angry looking scars on Potter’s wrist? Nor the fact that he acts half-dead already?”
“I’ll miss you, Harry. Thanks for the help this year.” She smiled up at him, and Harry grinned back at her.
“Severus. It’s good to see you again. It’s been so long that I have forgotten your face. Lily wanted to ask you around for dinner tomorrow night. We found a flat for her in London, but we were hoping for some recommendations for a spot to eat at in London. Mr. Potter, you are more than welcome to come too.”
“Hermione, snap out of it, and help me save him before he bleeds to death!” Ron felt guilty talking to his girlfriend so harshly, but he didn’t know what to do and she was in shock. Luckily she snapped out of it and rushed to Harry’s side. She casted a counter-curse to the wounds, but nothing happened. Hermione let out a small sound of distress again, then took a few breaths. She cast the counter-curse, with more confidence in her voice this time, and the cuts finally stopped bleeding.
Harry blushed. Of course Draco had noticed, Harry didn’t know why he had expected anything different. It was a bit humiliating how open of a book Harry was.
It wasn’t very noticable, but it made Harry consider his intentions more in depth. Harry suddenly realized that if he died, at least these three people would be upset. He didn’t want to upset anyone, but he also knew he didn’t deserve to live after so many people died because of him. Conflicted by his thoughts, Harry didn’t realize his emotions were showing on his face until Ron poked his side.
James chuckled again, and Severus hummed. Harry realized that he was subtly probing to see how much James remembered of his past.
She looked uncomfortable, but answered, “I ask Myrtle every week if there are any new ghosts from the Battle; it’s silly to think Sally would be afraid of what’s beyond, but I want to thank her.”
The child had the audacity to roll her eyes at him, and Harry very nearly took points from Gryffindor which would make the house start the year off in the red. He might still do it if she continued to have an attitude with him.
One last thing, you will all be required to add Muggle Studies to your coursework, as will the rest of the school; this a requirement from the Ministry of Magic. Your classes will only be taken with your year as well, you will not be joining the seventh years.”
Taking one last look at himself, he apparated to St. Mungo’s to collect Draco; when he and Severus had accepted the dinner invitation, Harry asked if he could bring Draco along as well. He walked up to the office Draco shared with two other healers, and was surprised to see his husband choosing a tie.
Draco looked at Zabini to see if the wizard was joking, but he looked incredibly serious. Pansy shared looks with both of them. Draco thought back and realized that Potter was acting incredibly strange, but Draco would not have attributed it to what Zabini was implying.
For the first time since he had received his Hogwarts letter, Ron considered going back for his N.E.W.T.S. Robards had already hinted heavily that he thought Ron should; Ron had to admit it wasn’t as great at being an Auror as he thought it would be. Ron didn’t think that he would be able to spend the rest of his life being an Auror, and not having any N.E.W.T.S. or graduating would definitely limit his options. Plus Hermione would need help with Harry this year, since she would be stretched thin already from the N.E.W.T.S. and her Prefect duties. Ron fell asleep while thinking about what to do.
He finished breakfast and heard more people start to fill the hall, but he waited for Longbottom to finish, though he would claim it was to finish his paragraph. On the first night, Draco had woken in the middle of the night to the Hufflepuff Hopkins and Longbottom shouting; it had not taken long to realize that Hopkins had wanted to curse Draco in his sleep and Longbottom stopped him. Draco knew he wouldn’t be popular, but he hadn’t expected a Hufflepuff to hex him while he slept. Since that night, Draco strived to be kinder to Longbottom.
Dr. Johnson was quiet for a few moments and took her glasses off. “The first step to being able to do all of those things is to want to. I’m not going to be able to snap my fingers and make the pain go away, but I will listen, offer advice, and help any way I can.”
Harry’s head acknowledging that didn’t make it easier to force his heart to do the same. Harry sighed over the situation, and Severus arched his eyebrow at him. Harry blushed, muttered some excuse, and went back to his paperwork.
Draco was silent for a few long moments before speaking. “I was overwhelmed, upset over something that doesn’t even really matter, and took it out on you, very harshly. I very much regret what happened, and want to do nothing more than apologize. However, I know that I don’t deserve your forgiveness or to ever talk to you again, but I’m extremely sorry for what happened. I want nothing more than to take it back.”
“Filling in Minerva’s position for the year; all of these people have expressed interest in being a temporary Transfiguration professor for the year. I expect your top four by this time next Monday. We will decide a time for a final interview together with the applicant.” Harry nodded, but he felt nervous. He had never been interviewed for a job before, and he did not know how to go about narrowing down this pile to eight people. Severus handed him a sheet with questions, and Harry relaxed; this would help him narrow down the applicants.
“Well that makes the thoughts I have about you extremely awkward, Neville.” Pansy lost it, and even Harry let out a small chuckle at the banter.
“His wand is being checked by the Ministry, he wouldn’t have used the Imperius Curse,” said a Ravenclaw girl.
Draco winced. They ate in silence until Lily came home, and they quickly tried to cover the somber mood. She was smarter than that, though, but she didn’t ask what was going on. Harry knew no matter what happened concerning his parents, he would always have this family made up of his spouse and friends. He would never be alone with just the Dursleys again.
Draco considered for a moment and Potter wilted, but he kept his hand out. Draco shook his hand with a vague sense of satisfaction and happiness that stemmed from someone noticing his efforts to change. Draco was pleased that at least one person wasn’t judging him from the mark on his arm, or his last name. He never would have thought that person would be Potter, but he also didn’t expect quite a few things about Potter.
“We won’t be able to find him quickly, would you know where he went to Draco?” Hermione asked in a neutral voice, obviously upset but probably seeing the fall-out coming a long time ago.
Potter was staring at Draco like he was the most fascinating thing in the room. Then he cleared his throat and looked away. Without looking at Draco, Potter said, “Luna said you saved her life while she was imprisoned at Malfoy Manour, but wouldn’t say how.” He was obviously prompting, and Draco decided to tell him.
Harry couldn’t help but appreciate that Severus rarely wasted time. James took a seat in the middle of the room, and the rest of the group surrounded him.
“No, but I know it to be true, Malfoy,” Potter said angrily. “Now leave me alone, so I can do what I came here to do.” Draco raised his eyebrow at Potter, surely he wasn’t dumb enough to think that Draco would listen.
Harry looked thoughtful instead of hurt, and Draco let out a silent sigh of relief. He had been afraid the statement would hurt Harry or curb his excitement. Draco noticed Granger staring at the pair of them and tried to ignore her. After a minute Harry nodded slowly.
The next day Draco sat beside Harry in their Defense Against the Dark Arts class. Hartley was being as nasty as usual, but Draco had become used to the cutting remarks and ignored them. He often thought this is what any house other than Slytherin felt in Snape’s class, but Harry had assured him that Hartley was nastier than Snape. Before the bell rang, Hartley handed back essays from the weekend; when Draco received his, he felt the air rush out of his lungs.
I'm just going to say, that I am not at all happy with my sorting hat's song. I'm not great at that kind of thing, to be honest.
Finally the morning post came, and there were three owls dropping off mail. That was extremely strange, and explained the delay in the post. One dropped off the Daily Prophet to his mother, but the other two had letters for Draco. He untied the letters from each of the owls, fed them each a bit of bacon, and they all flew off. One was from Hogwarts and one was from the Minister of Magic. He cut open the letter from Hogwarts first, his heart beating in his throat.
“That is good news as I would not have found a suitable replacement for Minerva in the short amount of time you would have given me if you had declined.”
“Draco, my darling son, please don’t start trouble this year. So much is riding on your N.E.W.T.S., and everyone is waiting for you to misstep. Do not give them a reason to place you back in Azkaban with your father, please.”
Harry tried not to let his anxiousness show, but knew he had failed when Draco put his hand on Harry’s leg. Filius was talking with Hermione, Severus was pacing in front of his desk, and Harry just wanted his parents to have already been there. Finally the floo roared to life and his parents stepped into the headmaster’s office. Harry desperately tried to erase the telling ticks of his nervousness.
Harry was glad that the conversation was back on ground he felt comfortable with. Soon they were leaving the Great Hall with a list of people who wanted to help that more than covered all the spots. Harry couldn’t believe the tutoring sessions were kicking off so quickly, he still had the small voice saying that they were only volunteering because it was Harry’s thing. Then he realized that as long as they contributed, what did their motives matter? The eighth years of the group hurried to Muggle Studies, and went about the rest of their day. Harry did not go into the Great Hall for lunch or dinner, but he realized that night he had not thought about the war after he sat down at the table in the Great Hall. He also noticed that Draco had smiled at him a lot more throughout the day and even whispered a “I’m proud of you.”
Harry smiled at Draco and leaned over to kiss his boyfriend. They weren’t a perfect couple without any issues, but Harry hoped their relationship could come out stronger after this bump in the road and any future hiccups. Harry pulled back and smiled; he felt ready to burst from happiness both from making up with Draco and the potential to actually teach next year.
Draco looked at the other people in the compartment uneasily, as he realized Zabini was right. Then Pansy spoke up, “Well, we’ll have to befriend Potter’s gang this year, and hope he doesn’t plan to do it as soon as we get back.”
Harry looked back at Ida who looked more terrified than she did when she walked over to him. “Don’t worry Ida, Draco wasn’t trying to be mean to you. He’s just a bit grumpy because
Harry watched the entrance of Three Broomsticks, and tried to tune out Severus’s fingers tapping on the table. Finally he looked over at the brooding man, and Severus raised his eyebrow. Harry rolled his eyes at the both of them. If this was how they were going to act, then James would not want the job.
“It would be dangerous, and the risks could outweigh finding a cure. Oh Harry, I’m so sorry. How are you handling this?”
“He really should have stayed out of it because his testimony ensured that justice wasn’t properly served.” Now Percy’s voice added his opinion. Mr. Weasley and Charlie were laughing about something, but stopped when they realized what was happening.
Harry had often wondered why she had not tried to get in his good graces with her future plans to be in the Ministry of Magic. He had quite a bit of influence still after the whole defeating Voldemort thing. Maybe she didn’t want to gain her connections in such an obvious way. It was refreshing, honestly, as most of the students tried their best to get in his good graces just because of his pull with the Ministry. If she didn’t have such a bad attitude, Harry thought he would quite enjoy having her as a student.
“Oh shut it, you absolute fool! Who’s he going to strike for? The person attached to his hip is Harry Potter.” This came from Terry Boot, but he had not moved from his chair in the corner of the room. The members of the room had started murmuring about Boot’s comment. A few looked disgusted but most nodded in agreement.
“Yes, she was. Thinking about it, it seems to me that you two talked a little bit in school, but it’s really fuzzy; sometimes I get a headache when I try to remember too much, but I try to remember as much as possible.”
In truth, Mrs. Weasley was absolutely right that Harry was too skinny and not healthy. The day Mrs. Weasley came to visit was the first time Harry had left his bed in four days, and he did not eat anything that entire time. The only reason he had gotten up that day was because Kreacher started punishing himself for his master wasting away. Harry was arguing with Kreacher about punishing himself, when Mrs. Weasley had stepped out of his floo.
“Let us discuss it in my office. I know what the professors are reporting concerning grades and I’ve talked to a few students who participate, but I would like to know how you feel like the tutoring program is going.”
Harry sat in a chair on the opposite side of the desk from Seveus and smiled at the man. “Hello, Sev. How are you?” Some days Harry could barely believe that he and Severus were on a first name basis, and other days it seemed weird. This man was the same age as his parents, which made him around forty-five; Harry realized how young his parents were when they had him after his own twentieth birthday, the age they were when they had him. Then he hit a rough patch after his twenty-first birthday, making him the same age they were when they died.
” “That’s her, her office is on the sixth floor. The Apparition Wards will drop in an hour and ten minutes and will be down for five minutes.” After saying that, Snape spun on his heel and walked out of the building.
“I’ll only schedule practice once a week, but it’ll be for three hours. I’ll expect you at all of them, though.”
Shaking the thoughts away, Harry unraveled the note which said, “Potter, I know you don’t deign the Great Hall worthy of your presence during lunch, and the rest of the day is a free period for Eighth Years. Come to my office as soon as you have eaten. - Headmaster Severus Snape.” Groaning, Harry walked around the castle for a bit to make it seem like he had eaten something. Then Harry walked to the Headmaster’s office and looked at the gargoyle; knowing Snape would never give Harry the password to his office, Harry spoke to the gargoyle, “The Headmaster wanted to see me.” After a few moments of just standing there, the gargoyle leapt aside and the staircase was revealed. Harry stepped onto the stairs and let them take him up to Snape’s office.
