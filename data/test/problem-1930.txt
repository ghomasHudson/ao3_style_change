“Yeah, it was,” Draco said, nuzzling into the crook of Harry’s neck. Suddenly he started giggling, his breath tickling Harry.
“Or… or leaves I think,” Harry adds tentatively.
“I… I took it from the kitchen,” he says, blushing lightly, looking ashamed. “Before I left. I know it’s wrong to —”
Harry groans. He knows he’s pushing too far, but Draco is being fucking ridiculous, and maybe it’s out of habit that Harry has to prod him. “But I could stay the night?”
“Honestly, Pansy, the only reason why I called you was because you should have some knowledge on this,” Draco snaps. “The
The days go by in a frantic mess, a tornado of desire, of guilt, of Harry’s body so close to yours, of getting to know each intimate part of him. Of a thousand prayers at night to make it stop, of stolen moments in the greenhouse, the library, the different store rooms. Your breath in Harry’s ear begging him to
“No,” Draco sighs. He tries to remind himself that while he himself has had time to get used to the idea of his impending death, this is all new to Pansy and she’s still in the “Trying To Fix This” stage. “Because you’d want to know who, and then try to make him love me. And it doesn’t matter because I know he doesn’t and I know he never will.”
Draco looked over his shoulder to acknowledge he’d noticed his new companion, and Potter gave him a tentative smile as he gracefully climbed up on the rock to sit cross legged beside him.
He sighs, letting his hand drop down to your chest. “You’re regretting it, aren’t you?”
But something’s wrong. The dull ache in his chest somehow transforms the chuckle into a cough, and suddenly he can feel something growing inside him, from that spot close to his ribs: moving, forcing its way up. It tickles and burns and irritates his throat, he needs to clear it, and that’s when it happens: as if in slow motion, a tiny flower falls out of his mouth, onto Potter’s bottom lip, then down onto the white sheets. Draco stares at it moving through the air, stares at it lying there on his bed. Innocently rounded white leaves formed like a soft star, with greenish stamens. It looks like the essence of purity, except for the blood stains splattered around it.
“Oh! Well, yes, it’s like a Muggle psychiatrist,” Draco said, relieved to have a reasonable explanation for the word. “And like a Muggle psychiatrist, I help patients by going through difficult things that have happened to them and then giving them tools to cope with these traumas in a healthy way.”
I think I’m getting the hang of this guitar playing thing. I’ve almost learned an entire song (that I didn’t write myself). I played it for Draco, and I think he liked it, even though he’d never admit something like that. But I noticed that when I sang,
He opened the kitchen cupboard to fetch himself a plate, only to find it empty. Thinking that he would give the git the benefit of the doubt, he started searching the other cabinets as well, but he only found pots and a grimy cup that was missing its handle. There wasn’t a single plate or even a whiff of a bowl anywhere. Of course. Of bloody course.
You don’t know how long you’ve been sitting there when you suddenly hear someone approaching, thundering through the thick undergrowth. Not an animal, someone human. You don’t dare to hope, but you look up anyway: a small ball of fire is weaving its way between the tree trunks, and behind it is:
He can hear Pansy starting to move, but he doesn’t look up. “Draco, don’t—” she says, but Draco cuts her off.
”Harry.”
“I’m… I’m sorry I didn’t go with you that night, I needed… I needed some time to myself. To contemplate it all. But —” you say, somehow not looking at him makes it easier for you to speak the truth. “I know now, I love you too, Harry. And that, at least, is not a sin.”
And then he bumps into Cho. Or rather, a few weeks after Harry called it off with Draco, she walks into his shop, wanting to repair her broom. He’s been following her career distantly over the years, not least since Ginny’s been complaining loudly every time she’s had to meet Cho in a match. Apparently she’s still an excellent Seeker, and she’s still very pretty, Harry thinks when she greets him with a warm smile.
Potter stilled, and after what seemed a lifetime and a half, he cleared his throat. His voice was soft but a bit unsteady when he spoke.
Well, all except one, he thought. Draco hadn’t been able to get out of his work shift, and Harry refused to admit how disappointed he’d been when he’d found out about that, because it wasn’t reasonable for him to be. It wasn’t as if he expected Draco to be around all the time now just because they were sort of friends, or at least hung out in the same friend circles. But still, it wasn’t every day you turned 25 and wanted to celebrate with the people you cared most about.
“The bond,” Draco said with a tone of forced patience. “Remember they put us under a temporary bond when we got here? It must have begun to solidify when you saved me.”
“Oh, kindly shut the fuck up.”
“Pray tell, Granger, did Potter here” (he still managed to spit out Harry’s name like it was something nasty) “leave his bodily residues all over the place when he was living with you as well?”
“Thanks,” Harry mumbled, looking down and shuffling his feet. “I owe some of it to the other git who lives here, though.”
Hermione waved faintly. “We wanted to see how Harry was settling in, since it’s his first time looking after himself.”
“So,” Draco said, his voice a higher pitch than usual and he cleared his throat. “Sorry. Strutty’s missing, and I’m guessing you want us to help you search for him?”
of my shampoo?”
“Why did you need to go out on a pilgrimage?”
“Could I not what?” he said innocently, pushing back into the downward dog. “Mmm, that feels good.”
A boy in the third row raised his hand and Draco nodded to him. “Are you allowed to use Legilimency on a patient?”
Suddenly Draco couldn’t stop staring.
Draco nods, his eyes stinging as if he were about to shed tears, but none come. “Thank you,” he whispers, too tired to try and keep up any sort of facade in front of her anymore.
But you can’t deny that he very much interests you, and you realise you want to learn everything there is to know about him.
“The lightning,” he chokes out, his voice trembling.
“Draco? Draco! Are you awake?” Harry heard Neville call from the other side. “Draco! Wake up!”
hand around my cock, that was… different. In a good way, I think. His was a bit longer than mine but mine is bigger in girth I think.
“Is this because he waited for so long to seek help?” Pansy says, and he can’t fucking
Neville looked relieved and grateful, then he snorted as he looked at the two of them. “Well, I don’t expect that to happen anytime soon,” he said with a cheeky grin.
Right. So, I… don’t really know what to say. Or write. I’ve never kept a journal. This was all Hermione’s suggestion, to help me keep the days apart during this Ministry mandated lockdown because of the Crup Flu magidemic. I don’t know, maybe it’s a good idea, all the days are starting to blend together, so. I think this is… day 12 of lockdown. Maybe I should add that to the top? Right okay I did that. Good. Great.
“I… excuse me?! I’m not some sort of peeping Tom!”
“Will do,” Harry said, “tell Robards we’ll brief him when we get back.”
So after slowly eating what Harry brought him, Draco lies back against the pillows again, Harry curling up beside him. But when Harry begins snoring softly in his ear, Draco still has trouble sleeping. He’s drowsy from the food and the late hour, but his brain can’t settle down. He’s still afraid, terrified of losing this, of making himself vulnerable only to be let down. Is it really worth it?
When Harry shoved Draco so forcefully that he lost his balance, she heaved a deep sigh and turned so she wouldn’t have to see the retaliation she knew would come. Usually she would stand on the porch until everyone was out of sight, but this time she went into the house to pour herself a very stiff drink. No one else in the history of mankind had deserved it more than she.
Rooming with Potter meant that they made up one of the cooking teams as well, and now Draco was standing in the kitchen, at a loss for what to do.
“But…” he starts, hesitating, “can I say that… I’d like to —”
“Morning, Alan.
,” Harry whispers, “we’re really doing this then?”
“Yes to what?”
, making the game fly towards Luna, who caught it with an expression of curiosity as she twisted it in her hands.
Harry regards her for a moment before he concedes and gets up, mumbling “sorry” on his way.
The words go straight to the very core of Harry, pooling deep in his belly, making him screw his eyes shut so tightly he’s seeing stars, and then he’s coming as well, louder than ever before, while Draco keeps whispering encouragement into his ear, his hand firm on Harry’s cock, slowly milking every drop out of him.
Harry laughed softly, his mouth so close to Draco’s now, and he tilted his head, and if Draco just leaned a little bit forward—
“You’re ridiculous. Terrible—a terrible human being—never mind
. But their frantic snogging came to an abrupt halt when they suddenly realised they weren’t alone anymore.
Harry’s lying next to him, his arm slung over Draco’s chest, palm resting over Draco’s heart beating, beating, beating. Harry’s own heart feels like a constant grounding presence thumping against Draco’s ribs, his slow and steady breathing pleasantly comforting. Draco only needs to angle his head slightly to bury his nose in Harry’s thick curls, smelling of wood and broom polish and warmth.
in love.
“You should be acting like a man who can’t keep his hands off of the object of his desires.” Harry’s breath tickled the back of Draco’s neck, and the shiver went straight to his cock. Harry’s hand traced its way around the side of Draco’s back and came to rest on his hip, gripping it tight through the layers of fabric.
Draco struggles to draw another breath as he feels a new attack coming.
“I wasn’t —” he starts, but stops when he looks at you. “Yes, I was, I was listening because I knew it had to have something to do with us. And I heard my name, and —”
“Potter, I swear to Merlin that if I find your
The plan had been to trick one of the resort workers into thinking we were distracted and then track them down when they were unaware. For someone who often jumped the gun and said fuck it to the Ministry more times than he could count, Draco thought Harry was being evasive. In fact, if Draco had to guess, Harry would have generally strayed from the plan—
The next morning, Harry had signed up for a yoga class, and he was prepared. When Malfoy strolled in, again in those low slung joggers with apparently nothing else under them, Harry knew he would take the place beside Harry’s yoga mat, even though the room was practically empty with only two other participants and the instructor. And sure enough, with his signature faux innocent look, Malfoy crouched down beside Harry to roll out his mat. Harry did not notice how the fabric of Malfoy’s joggers stretched across his arse as he bent forwards, or the graceful way he folded his legs underneath him to sit down in the lotus position. Malfoy turned to Harry, blinking serenely.
“And there’s no sofa in the cabin?”
they wouldn’t, because it’s a
Fixed that broken door to the kitchen cabinet. And I started sorting through my photos to put in an album.
“Yes, Potter, I believe that is the definition of sharing a room.”
“Mine,” he growls, but it doesn’t sound possessive, it’s like he needs to repeat it to himself, like he can’t believe it’s really true, that Harry is really his. But Harry is, he hasn’t been this gone for anyone, ever in his life. So when Draco stands them both up and starts backing towards his bedroom, pulling Harry by the scruff of his neck to follow him, he obeys without resistance, his mouth still searching out Draco’s again and again. Draco’s hands are dancing all over his body, tugging at his clothes to remove them on their way. Harry’s shirt catches on his glasses when Draco tries to pull it off, and he removes them and tosses them carelessly to the side.
“Thank you,” Harry said, smiling at them all. “Now, as you all know, we have Mindhealer Draco Malfoy with us today to tell us about his work. I want you all to behave and
Harry startled at Ebba’s voice, and when he turned to her, he realised she must’ve been trying to get his attention for some time.
Harry is running up the stairs, taking them two at a time. His muscles are sore and he curses the fact that it’s virtually impossible to apparate into the fourth floor of a Muggle building. The entire day has felt like wading through treacle and he can almost swear that someone hexed the clock in his classroom to go slower. Or maybe it’s just the fact that he’s been desperate to go home since he arrived at uni this morning. Because he knows that Draco’s waiting for him at home. And he is painfully aware of what Draco is wearing.
“I’d say,” Ebba snickered with a sideways glance at Draco, and now Harry was the one blushing. “I was just wondering if you’d like to accompany Draco and me for a late night walk while Saga cleans up, and I can tell you about the superstitions regarding the midsummer night.”
“Well. I’ve reached the conclusion that it’s the chastity curse.”
that you push into him.
Harry obliges at once, and when he’s on his back, the sight of Draco makes him gasp. He looks almost wild, hair messy and tousled, cheeks flushed and chest covered in splotches of red. And the look he gives Harry is almost too much to handle, he looks at him like he’s the most precious thing in the world, and Harry has to close his eyes on the pretence that he needs to adjust his position.
, you know,
When he couldn’t see the house anymore he walked down to the beach. During their stay here, he’d found the ever moving waves rolling in over the sand soothing for his mind, and for the first time in a few hours he felt his shoulders drop and he could breathe freely. He stopped when he reached the water, stooping down to roll up his linen trousers to let the waves lap at his ankles. Letting his head fall back, he drew a deep breath, flexing his fingers.
“Well as nice as it would be to have someone helping us around here, it would be difficult to hide how much I love you, so I think it was the right decision.”
“There’s some wood here,” he says. “If only we had something to light it with.”
Yeah, no, I can’t write that. I feel like I’m a lovesick thirteen year old girl. Sorry, diary, the greeting has to go. Maybe I could call you something instead? Or I guess I’m writing to myself, so maybe no greeting is needed? I should’ve asked Hermione how one does this.
“What? This?! But it’s tiny!”
He doesn’t bother putting on his coat when he leaves, only picks it up in a bundle and trots through Harry’s door. And if Harry spends the next ten minutes dealing with his frustration by slamming his fist against the wall until his knuckles are sore? Well, no one needs to hear about that, since he’s worked exceedingly well on his silencing charms.
Hands on her hips, she watched the two idiots take their places on opposite sides of the circle of runners. If she’d known how much toil it would be to have them both here, she’d never have accepted Blondie’s (Draco!) late application for this training camp. No matter how much extra he’d paid, this simply wasn’t worth it.
Pansy smiles at him like the cat that got the cream. “That’s what you get for being a nosy bastard.”
Tentatively, as if nearing a wild animal, you reach out and place your hand on his shoulder.
“Let’s go to sleep now, my love,” Harry says, interrupting your thoughts. “We have a long day ahead of us.”
You tip your head back to hide your self consciousness, and Harry doesn’t waste a second to cover the expanse of your throat with kisses, his stubble rasping over the delicate skin, working his way up to your ear.
“It needs to be romantic love, you know this. He doesn’t feel that way about me.”
“No, I just need to remove my glasses first, or they’ll get caught in the neck.”
“Yes…?”
The flat is quiet, but Draco is usually home at this time, so Harry wastes no time in kicking off his shoes and trotting in. He’s painfully hard, has been for at least half an hour now. Or, if he’s truly honest, all day. It didn’t even help that he had a desperate wank after lunch, because five minutes later he was hard again, only able to think about Draco wearing those pants with the matching top, and he’s been entirely unfit to concentrate on anything any of his teachers or classmates have said to him all day. He was supposed to participate in a group assignment but he had to feign nausea so he could finally go home. Never in a million years would he have thought that he’d be crazy about Draco fucking Malfoy, but here he is, unable to stop thinking about the git and what he has planned to do.
“Oh dear lord, are we really having this conversation now?”
“But I do have to thank you, love. What you did made me realise that you weren’t the only one too stubborn for his own good. Witches and Wizards throughout Britain were stubbornly refusing to accept the help and care of intelligent, sophisticated pureblooded individuals such as myself. Can you believe it? Wizards just like me, all over the country being rejected by people too stupid to understand what they were being offered. It’s because of you my love, that I developed this little program, as a means to help guide them into true happiness.”
“Well, as much as I hate to suggest it, I guess the obvious solution is for the two of you to get married,” Ron says.
“Anywhere. Take me anywhere.”
Draco barely sees anything on his way home, it’s Pansy who’s leading the way, steering him in the right direction through the crowds of Muggle London. It’s too painful for Draco to Apparate and the Floo is suffocating enough even if you don’t have a veritable greenhouse situated in your respiratory system.
We’re just friends. And I’d like it to stay that way.
“Mate, are you okay?” Ron’s hand lands on Harry’s shoulder, and Harry has to take a deep breath to keep from sobbing.
But Harry really wants to know what it feels like to have someone fucking him, to have
I wrote a song instead. Or, well, maybe “wrote a song” is making it sound like more than it really is. It was more like, strumming various chords  (out of the three I’ve learned) and coming up with words as I was playing. I think it went a bit like
“Ow! Why’d you do that?” Harry yelps as his shin starts hurting and he can feel a bruise blooming on it.
. But I won’t rest easy until you’re well again, Draco.”
Harry immediately tenses and now he’s wide awake. “No,” he says firmly, hugging Draco tighter to him.
don’t know how to act around him. He’s started to come out of his room more, and even if he doesn't really seek me out, now we’re spending more time together again. I’m so afraid I’ll blurt out something really stupid and to avoid that I keep entirely quiet. I know he notices because I’ve seen him glancing at me more and more, looking like he’s trying to read my mind.
I was horny and you were away at some charity event or whatever. And she was there. It didn’t mean anything.”
You feel like you’re on fire, there are flames consuming you and he won’t even look at you.
“What...spells?”
“I remember someone calling me ‘brilliant, witty and fascinating’.”
It was so beautiful, and even though it had a happy ending the tune was a bit sad and I could somehow
“I don’t mind,” Potter said with a shrug before bringing his hand up to run through his hair, a gesture so familiar to Draco he’d be able to spot it in the dark. Draco had to avert his gaze to avoid staring at the way Potter’s shirt rode up to expose his treasure trail. “I can take the couch though if you’re that uncomfortable.”
“Yeah, I only have one cabin left, but there’s still a ‘Do not disturb’ sign hanging here.”
Dear Diary,
love, he thinks as he slides his fingers through Draco’s soft hair, tugging a little the way he knows Draco likes. It’s just Harry and his foolish heart wanting more than Draco is willing to give him. Because he knows Draco doesn’t do “
“Does it —?”
“This is first class.”
“You’re in love with me?”
Harry squeezes his hand placed on Draco’s thigh and brushes his lips to Draco’s forehead. “I am too.”
“Well as nice as that sounds, I still have to go to work,” Harry pipes up, and immediately hides his face between Draco’s shoulder blades at Pansy’s withering stare.
Harry’s not even sure if he’s the one that’s done the watching, he thinks as he takes a sip from his pint of beer, or if it’s Malfoy that has constantly managed to throw himself in the line of Harry’s sight. Either way, it feels magnetic, the constant pull towards him. Only this time, unlike the rest of the night, Harry doesn’t look away, but keeps his gaze, silently daring Malfoy to make a move.
“I’m not sure that’s doable, Daphne’s cunt was pretty memorable,” he pants, already turned on beyond belief.
“Is he always like this?” she said, nodding in Draco’s direction.
“I honestly don’t care that you used to — oh wow, what
“Ah, hello, Mr Potter. I’m Draco’s Healer, Sadie Goodwin. I’m afraid I have to ask you to leave this bed while I run some tests and diagnostic spells.”
fuck him already. Only then does Draco enter him, with a throwaway “Who’s memorable now?”
I tried to teach Draco how to play Backgammon today, but he kept getting annoyed that I kept winning, even though I tried my hardest not to. He’s such a sore loser. He tried to blame it on the pieces not being sentient, but, yeah no, he’s just a sore loser.
Ron straightened up and threw her a sharp look. “Hey! The ferret and I have a very trusting and mature friendship!”
“I wasn’t aware that we were exclusively casual, but I’m fine with that if you want us to be. I mean, Daphne is alright, but there are some things she lacks, anatomically speaking,” Harry says, swirling his tongue around Draco’s cock again. He deliberately leaves out how having sex with Daphne couldn’t compare to having sex with Draco in a million years, that she didn’t leave him entirely breathless like Draco does. He doesn’t need to be more smug than he already is.
“Right,” Harry said with a tight smile, not mentioning that he knew damn well where his old set was (buried deep in a box in his attic because he was sick of losing to Ron all the time). “Thanks,” he managed to grind out, hoping it sounded sincere.
“Your first treatment is ready. Please bring Mr Potter to room two.”
“Come on,
The restaurant was slowly filling as per the schedule they’d seen over the last few days. One couple would make their way in and chat loudly, enjoying the privacy of an empty restaurant for as long as possible. Then a few more would come in, some bathers from the pool heading directly for the bar attached to the outside veranda, shielding them from the blast of the air conditioning. More would flow in and out in a variety of ways that made Harry’s head hurt from trying to keep tabs on everyone. His neck would send him to St. Mungo’s after this for sure.
Draco turned towards Harry to find that he was dizzyingly close to him. He finally looked at Harry to see the earnestness in his eyes. “You could… try it again? See what happens this time?”
“Are you doing yoga or are you practicing some kind of… live show?” Malfoy said as they got into the warrior position again, wobbling slightly on his back foot.
“Oh, are we trying to be civilised now?” Malfoy said. “I distinctly remember someone failing to do the
you’re not going to do anything about it?”
“So, the same way I got worse when he was around, but in reverse?”
There, that was better, making them invested by including them in conversation. Good one, Draco. A few hands were already raised, and he pointed to a girl in the front left. “Yes, let’s start with you,” he said with a more genuine smile, “miss…?”
She gets up to go to their library, but not before she’s cast a spell to dry up the wet floor, giving Ron a smug smirk. Ron rolls his eyes at her but then looks at her leaving with a fond expression on his face, and Harry wishes he could have this, this easy playfulness and casual displays of love and affection.
“Yes, I recall. And it was tough for a little while there, but then I realized something. Some people just don’t know what's good for them. I was only trying to help you, Draco, keep you safe. You didn’t need a job! Between us, we had plenty of money and all that work!  Day in, day out, with people who might want to hurt you or take you away from me? Don’t get me started on your friends, that Blaise asshole definitely wanted to get into your pants, and Pansy, she hated me, always telling you not to listen to me. I know what’s best for you, what foods you should eat to keep you nice and trim for me, what you look best in, and you have to admit, my taste in decorating and entertainment is just better than yours darling. I was only doing what was best.” He spoke so sweetly as if what he said should be obvious to any child...or pet.
“Ugh, these socks are killing me.”
“I don’t usually share my clothes, but I’ll make an exception if it’ll increase my chances of getting this room to myself.”
“What’s so fascinating about these?” Draco’s words are laced with amusement, but Harry also hears he’s genuinely curious about the effect they clearly have on him. “Why do you love them so much?”
The room fell quiet and it took a few seconds for Ron’s words to process in Harry’s brain. He snapped his eyes up, looking sharply at Ron, whose ears had gone bright red.
You shake your head, you know your voice won’t carry if you were to attempt to speak.
loud part) has him convinced it’s not that bad. As long as he keeps it to himself.
You used to think that the Heavenly Father is the only one who really sees you, the only one who loves you. But thinking about Harry fills you with warmth, and you realise he’s the only one on this earth who knows you inside and out and still wants to be with you.
Harry folded his arms across his chest, glaring at Malfoy. “ Well, I didn’t realise it was story time. Why don’t you tell me all about Little Red Riding Hood as well?”
Out of the corner of your eye you see Matthew nod. “I’ve been hearing — You’ve been calling his name in your sleep since he left.”
idea. As if he could ever feel comfortable around Potter.
“Draco,” he whispers, his mouth just between you shoulder blades, the words a caress against your skin. “Draco I’m — I’m going to —” and you feel his thrusts becoming quicker, more frantic, more erratic until he pushes himself deep inside once, twice, three times. Then, with a groan spilling from his lips, you feel him throbbing inside you, the sensation of it overwhelming, and you’re following him in this whirlwind of heat, a silent scream of bliss tearing out of you as you follow him over the edge. Completely spent, you both collapse on the hard surface underneath you.
It feels really strange writing this,
“Which is why,” Harry said, with a dreading realization, “this is the perfect place to kidnap someone and hold them hostage.”
(Starting now. Because I might have said something snippy about her during the latest
I don’t really know what went wrong with Ginny and me. I mean, we were happy, sort of. We liked each other’s company, she always knew how to make me laugh, and the sex was great. But there was always this feeling that there was something missing, apart from the things I mentioned yesterday, and I still haven’t figured out what that was.
Ron leaned forward and patted him on his hand. “There there, I’m sure it’s just a phase or something. Soon you’ll be reminded of what a git he is, and then you’ll snap out of it.”
had been her plan all along. How could he have been so foolish as to think that she worked in those simple ways?
“It’s the first time you’ve called me Harry.”
“Malfoy! What the —” Harry spluttered, bits of toothpaste foam coating the mirror.
“You know… We may not even need to share a room.”
“If it doesn’t help, I also have pain relief remedies, but I only make those in small quantities and distribute them one dose at a time since they are highly dangerous if taken in too large amounts. But if you want any I can send one dose with you now.”
Harry would rather eat one of Hagrid’s rock cakes than confront Malfoy about what he’d heard and ask him to tone it down. The morning after had been embarrassing enough, with Malfoy smirking knowingly at Harry when he caught him blushing.
Draco snorted. “Yeah, her style is quite… unique.” He shuddered at the thought of Luna’s paintings of radishes with auras and some sort of blown up… lice?
The parchment then recorded only one set of footfalls moving hurriedly away from their door. Apparently, Harry had been right about lurkers checking in on them and that made Draco eternally grateful they had ignored their inhibitions and gave in to their desire for each other.
“You know, Draco, if I didn’t know any better, I’d say you were jealous,” he says with a slow smile.
“Strutty, your ostrich?” Harry asked, remembering he was still basically naked when Draco looked at him with a raised eyebrow and Neville gave him an amused smile even though he was clearly distressed by his pet’s disappearance. “I, er… Draco, do you have something I could…?”
“Should I be worried the first thing I’m thinking about after having sex is whether or not our stalker has noticed we’re tracking them?”
Well there's a thousand things I shouldn't do
Draco is surprised he’s able to stand up when the ground has opened underneath him. His mouth is dry and the only sound he can hear is his own heart beating rapidly, pulsing against the vines around it. And underneath that, like a stream, the roots growing longer, thicker, invading him further.
“I’m sure,” he repeats, softer this time, closing the distance to let his lips brush over Draco’s temple. “I’m really sure. I want you inside me, Draco.”
“I was… There was this man, in my village. We used to… I used to help him take care of his animals, feed the chickens and the sheep and so on. And we became friends.”
“Alex? What…?”
Draco smirks, uncrossing his legs. “Why don’t you come over here and find out for yourself?”
“If anything, you should be thankful for him,” Harry continues. “He… What we did was the reason I left to expiate my sins by going on a pilgrimage. And if I hadn’t done that I never would have met you.”
But really, I realise I should’ve done this sooner. The time leading up to this quarantine has been very strange, and a bit stressful with all the uncertainty. And writing is a great way to sort out my thoughts and stuff. Imagine if I had done this during the war. It would’ve been impossible though, because of safety, should anyone find my dairy and see the things Ron, Hermione and I got up to. And also, I wasn’t the most mature human being at the time and would’ve probably considered it to be “too girly”. Well, past-Harry, there’s nothing wrong with things for girls, or things that girls like for that matter (actually, as long as people do what makes them happy anyone can do what they want. The concept of things being for girls and boys only is a bit ridiculous. Like keeping a diary).
“Well, they never mentioned I’d be cooped up with anyone when they checked me in.”
“Well, you have to confront him about it then,” Hermione said, shaking Harry out of his thoughts. “He should at least have the decency to throw up some privacy charms; even a
Draco was wearing that tie dye t-shirt I made the other week, even though he claims to hate it. I haven’t told him he looks absolutely ridiculous in it, because I think it’s kind of nice that he’s using something I made and gave to him. (Also haven’t told him that I made it for Luna originally but that when I tried giving it to her she told me the colours would attract the wrackspurts. And anyway Draco could probably use some wrackspurts.)
Harry nods silently, looking terrified, while Draco has to fight hard to keep from snickering. “Yes, Healer Goodwin,” they say as one.
” Harry laughed, “Can’t do
He hates it.
“Harry,” you say, softly, like a prayer. “Harry please talk to me.”
“But don’t look at me while I’m changing!”
Draco gracefully got up, and Harry forgot how to breathe when he watched him slipping a green silk dressing gown on as he moved to the bedroom door and disappeared into the other room.
it really was getting hot in the room.
Draco slumped, fidgeting with the hem of his shirt. “Shit, I should’ve taken the bait and laughed it off as a drunken mistake,” he mumbled, almost inaudibly. Then he straightened up. “No. You know what, Harry? Okay, I’ll admit I’m still a bit drunk. But not much. Only enough to get rid of my inhibitions. Only enough to go after what I want.” He looked straight into Harry’s eyes, his chin tilted up in defiance.
“Er, yeah,” Harry said, feeling his face heat.
And yet, there’s something there. That weird pull they’ve always had towards each other has been growing steadily, and tonight it feels like something needs to happen. Maybe it’s a need to satisfy his curiosity. Harry doesn’t know, and he’s not really sure he wants to find out, but it’s like an itch that he can’t keep from scratching.
you six months ago not to tell me how it felt to have Malfoy fuck you. But did you listen?” Ron answers his own question by shuddering.
The other man spoke, “Thanks for bringing him here.” he smiled. “I don’t know how you managed to slip ‘The Great Harry Potter’ potions, but I’d never have been able to manage it... God,” he said looking down at Harry and trailing his fingers down the side of his face. “He’s just so bloody perfect, aren’t you, sweetheart?”
You’re still incapable of forming words, so instead you crash your lips together again, his tongue slipping inside your mouth. He moans loudly, his hips bucking frantically and then you feel it, the length of him twitching, his release spilling over his hand and onto your stomach, and this sensation is entirely new to you, it’s shocking and it’s glorious and you want it to last forever, his hand on you, around you. It’s so much smoother now, and there’s less friction now between you and him and it’s better than what can be strictly allowed, and you cry out helplessly as ecstasy fills every part of your body and you come against him, his name spilling from your lips.
“No, nothing’s wrong,” Malfoy said, taking a swig from his water bottle. “Is that… Is that what you’re wearing?”
“Well, I’m sure this must’ve happened before, and I’m sure there are some records of someone managing to get unstuck. I’ll do my best to look it up,” Pansy says, her tone clipped and leaving no room for argument. “Weasley, you’ll tell all of this to Granger and help her with the research as well. Blaise, you—Well you can make sure these love birds are fed and watered.”
His eyes are dark, the irises a tiny sliver of green around his wide pupils, his breath coming in short bursts. You swallow, your eyes never leaving his.
Draco didn’t know how it felt. He didn’t know how invasive it was for someone to just stay inside your head without an end in sight, and how suddenly Harry had felt nothing. He had fought Voldemort in his head countless times, pushed away Imperio over and over again, it always left a void. He had been standing three feet away from Draco and Harry hadn’t been able to do a thing—
Harry gaze softened and he stoked Draco’s cheek. “Tomorrow, love. I don’t think I can wait anymore to finally have you in my arms.”
“Have you never seen cashmere before, Potter?”
“Did you seriously use up
Draco hummed, squinting with one eye as he pretended to think hard, which had the added benefit of allowing him to look properly at Harry. When he finally spoke, his lips brushed against Harry’s, sending sparks of happiness through him. “Yeah? Well Pansy can fucking wait.”
“I’m happy to hear it,” she says, and she sounds like she genuinely cares. But her gentle face turns serious as she goes on. “We’ve also analysed the contents of your lungs, and… I’m very sorry to say, but… the Hanahaki Disease is obviously in its final stages. Some of the flowers we see now are asters and orpines. Autumn flowers. Which is a sign that there’s not much time left.”
“Well, I can’t deny that that
“Potter! Back already?”
“Sorry for repeating myself. I’d just hate to ruin such an amazing agreement with
And, well I feel really stupid now. When she told me that I’m probably at least bisexual, and probably always have been, so many things fell into place, and when I look back at them now I’m shaking my head at how stupid I was. It started with her reminding me of Cedric, and how Draco and I used to
Soft hands come to tangle in Harry’s hair again, and with a sigh Draco says, “I just didn’t know we were having sex with other people.”
“Fun?
“I know I can’t do anything about this, but
You’re out in the garden shed the first time it happens. It’s innocent enough: you’re stowing away rakes and shovels after the day’s work, the worn down wood smooth against your blistered hand, and you can feel how it’s still warm from his hand holding it. Then, when you step up on a stool to hang up the spades, you lose your balance and you tumble backwards, arms flailing to try to hold onto something to keep from falling. And then he’s there, his strong arms catching you, and your stomach drops out for entirely different reasons. You don’t dare turn around, you know your eyes would betray you if you did, and yet, he’s still holding you, even though you’ve planted your feet on the ground and you’re no longer in any danger of falling.
“Undress me,” Draco whispers, grabbing Harry’s wrists and putting his hands on his chest.
“Could you not?” Malfoy said, sounding pained.
If she could have scoffed, she would have. Instead, she uncoiled her body and slowly slithered over the table towards the other man, who startled and said something to Potter, that sounded like he was asking what was happening. He drew himself backwards on his chair, a tinge of panic mixing with the general scent of him. Nüwa stopped with a distance near enough to smell him, but far enough to calm him down, but he was still tense and glanced over to Potter.
“Yes?”
“Are you alright, Malfoy?”
I told him that if my first efforts at learning to play were so awful, maybe he could do it better. And of course he already knew how to play, because why the hell not? He played an old traditional wizarding song, some sort of ballad about a maiden who was so beautiful she was pestered by all the men in the village and had to take refuge in the woods. Eventually her parents sent another girl to her to chaperone, and to help with householding and such. And in the end they realised they had fallen in love with each other, and they lived happily ever after in the woods.
— can you, now?”
“Pertinger. Shirley Pertinger,” the girl answered, batting her eyelashes. “My mum told me you see a Mindhealer to… deal with trauma and… stuff,” she mumbled, blushing furiously.
As he watched Draco dig into them, Harry was rather proud he didn’t have to say anything to Draco regarding the matter. With a pointed glance from the charcuterie board and rapidly disappearing oyster spread to his partner, he was happy to say he’d reduced Draco to near-Hogwarts-levels of frustration.
“What was that? I can’t hear you.”
“Well I’ve already got my cabin, so, no.”
“So, when are you going to tell him?” Luna presses, but gently so.
be the one to finish last.”
Harry sighs and returns to kissing Draco’s body, because he loves the feel of Draco’s skin under his lips, and he doesn’t have the patience for his nonsense right now. He reaches the waistband of Draco’s boxers and slides them down. “Yeah? Well here’s another thing that came up and I think I’d like to focus on that instead.”
“I’m… I’m not sure. They just… come. Sometimes. From here,” Draco says, wheezes, pointing to his chest.
, Ronald, since we’re talking about the gayest wizard in the entirety of Britain, and his boyfriend. It’s an expression.”
“Yeah,” Draco sighed, leaning back, away from Harry’s personal space. “But I guess I’m not nearly drunk enough, because that rejection really stung.”
“Are you really comfortable like that?” She nods to Draco’s arm trapped underneath Harry’s head.
“You know, you should focus on breathing slowly and calmly,” he said, furrowing his brows to a look of concern. “Soothe your mind.” He turned to the front again and folded himself forwards, palms against the floor, and as planned, his shorts rode up a little bit, exposing the bottom part of his buttocks. Malfoy made a strangled sound beside him and Harry bit back a snort.
“Well, well, well, if this isn’t my lucky day,” an all too familiar voice said right in his ear, and Harry snapped out of his mindfulness. “First I get to spend a week with the
“I’m sorry. I’ll stop, I promise,” he says, trying to smile in a reassuring way. “I don’t think I’ll be able to do it anymore soon, anyway.”
Still haven’t talked to him. Partly because I’m nervous about it, but mostly because I barely even see him. He’s been out of his room once today, to have his book club with Astoria, and he gave me a very pointed look that told me to keep out of his way, so I did. Went out for a run, and when I came back he was in his room again.
You try not to notice how his voice trembles, how tightly he’s holding his knees, and you turn and leave him on the brink.
“Mother?” he asks, voice dry and weak again. He doesn’t ask about his father because he’s not sure that he’d even want him there, or if Lucius would dignify Draco with a visit, if he were even allowed a furlough from Azkaban.
“Partly. It’s—You should know these things as well, Weasley! In the olden days you weren’t supposed to…
Harry hums around Draco’s cock, enjoying the pleasurable pain in his scalp as Draco tugs his hair a little harder, almost lifting Harry off him. He dives in again, taking it a little deeper this time, enjoying the pressure of it against his tongue, how it nudges his palate every time he takes it in further. He loves sucking cock, and especially Draco’s. There’s something extremely satisfying about having Draco Malfoy, king of snark and sassy comebacks, rendered into a blubbering boneless mess with a few well chosen movements of his tongue and lips.
“You’re both dismissed,” Robards said. “I want a written report by tomorrow, but be sure to make it short. Now please get out of my sight.”
Harry couldn’t stop staring. It wasn’t an extravagant gift, money-wise, but the thoughtfulness and the effort it must have taken Draco to find this for him was astounding. The game was almost mint condition. Draco must’ve gone back to the store to get a better look, and then found it in another store, because the one they’d seen had been old and battered. The gift made something stir in Harry, something he hadn’t allowed himself to think about before, and he wasn’t sure he was ready for even now.
“Yeah. Yeah, you’re probably right,” Harry said, feeling relieved. But when he glanced over at Hermione she didn’t look entirely convinced.
If I’m honest, just thinking about that, Draco getting together back with Astoria, makes me kind of jealous. Only because I don’t have anyone waiting for me like he has. Sure, there are probably hoards of girls wanting to be with me, but only because of what I did and not… not for
And at the other end of the pub, Malfoy catches Harry’s eye once again, his mouth quirking up at one corner in a smirk. As if he’s noticed that Harry’s been watching him all night.
“Oh, Potter, you’re up already.”
he harbours.
“Show me. Show me how much I’m yours, Harry.”
so damn funny?” Harry asked her.
It’s a beautiful spring day when your life is turned upside down. The March sun is peeking up over the monastery walls, thawing the patches of snow still covering parts of the ground, and you’re in the greenhouse, sowing the early crop of herbs, when the Prior comes looking for you. He tells you a new pilgrim has just arrived, he’s dehydrated and has cuts and injuries that need to be tended to.
“Come here.” Draco has that smug smile on his face, the one that only a few months ago would have made Harry furious, but now combined with his hooded eyes, makes Harry even crazier with want.
Malfoy sighed, dropping his hand towards the floor. “There might be one or two under the bed.”
. I mean I’m happy for Draco, of course I am, he deserves to be with someone, and if that someone is as awesome as Astoria, even better.
This threw Draco off, and his anger and resentment was instantly replaced with sheer astonishment. “You haven’t?”
Two days ago we were watching One Tree Hill and we started talking about how hot Chad Michael Murray is, because hello, he is, anyone can see that, straight or not. (Draco didn’t agree though, he thought that James Lafferty, who plays the brother, was way hotter, which is completely wrong, but to each their own I guess.)
“Oh, bravo, Weasel, ten points to Gryffindor.” Pansy inclined her head in Ron’s direction and clapped her hands in mock applause. “And then you chose this moment to spill the beans, very clever. I’ll have you know that
Unfortunately for Draco, this meant that it was his job to transfigure something and/or move them aside so they could get to whatever hellish trapdoor awaited them.
In truth, Harry didn’t think he could handle drinking. It would have been nice to think they could drink the Bond issue away, but years of therapy and training had taught him it wouldn’t be a wise choice.
of him. And to have this intimate moment with Draco, to know that, despite their past, he’s happy that Draco’s the first one to be this close to him. It’s so arousing to Harry that he finds himself hurtling towards his third orgasm for the day. Draco shudders over him, hips jerking in tiny movements and he takes Harry’s cock in his hand, stroking it slowly but firmly.
Things really start to go to shit after Potter’s rejection. Draco feels like he’s been thrown off a cliff, free falling towards the inevitable end. Thoughts about how people will react keep coming, along with shame when he thinks about what they’ll say about him for being this weak.
Draco frowns and blinks a few times, clearing his throat.
There was a loud bang and everyone fell silent. Harry was standing in front of his desk in full duelling pose, wand in hand and so much power radiating from him that it stole Draco’s breath from his lungs. Judging by the stillness in the classroom, as if the students were collectively holding their breath, he wasn’t the only one affected by Harry’s authority. But in an instant, Harry’s stern countenance was replaced by a friendly smile, everyone relaxed back into their seats, and Draco felt his own shoulders drop a fraction.
It’s almost violent, the way you kiss him. When you finally let go, you’re not holding back. You catch his bottom lip between your teeth and you grab his hair, running your fingers through the damp strands, angling his head so you can go deeper. He moans, and he seizes you around the waist, pressing your bodies flush together, and you feel what you haven’t dared to see: that he’s already hard, and now his erection slides against yours, making you gasp, making you feel like you’re falling through the skies for eternity.
Harry chuckled, feeling giddy but still surprised that this was finally happening. “Make me,” he whispered, tilting his head to the side and parting his lips, heart pounding violently against his ribcage. When Draco brought his hand into Harry’s hair and his mouth found Harry’s, Harry was seriously afraid that his heart would beat out of his chest.
With a tentative glance at Harry, Draco drags himself out the tiniest bit and drives back in again, and Harry almost loses his mind at how amazing he feels, how inexplicably good it feels to be stretched around Draco’s cock like this. It’s better than any toy he’s ever used, so much softer but rougher at the same time. Draco does it again, a little bit further this time, a little bit faster, and Harry can’t help but let out a moan, which makes Draco smirk in a highly pleased way. Then, he starts fucking Harry, still slow and measured, restrained, and Harry loses himself in the sensation of Draco’s cock sliding in and out of him, of his hands holding onto Harry’s hips to guide his thrusts.
Digging into the rest of the meal was worth it, even if the outfit he’d picked earlier felt tight afterwards.
“Well, it’s a good thing it’s him then, isn’t it?”
Draco reluctantly sat down as well, crossing his legs and trying once again to catch Pansy’s eye, to no avail.
Draco drew his feet up from the water, putting them on the rock to rest his chin on his knees. “Why do
“Mr Malfoy? Please, do come in.”
Goodwin nods. “Any more of that? Coughing up leaves?”
Harry smiled sweetly and nodded, “Only for you, darling,” and pushed himself close against the man, kissing him.
“Have you done this before?” you ask, because surely he must have some experience? This cannot feel this good if it’s his first time.
Stretching your hand out, you carefully graze the dried silvery green leaves with your fingertips, imagining you’re touching him instead, before you quickly extinguish that thought from your mind.
He purses his lips disbelievingly and tilts his head, giving you a sharp look. You feel like shielding yourself from his gaze, it’s far too invasive.
You sigh, closing your eyes, taking in the sound of the stream, seeing the little white flowers all around you in your mind’s eye. You want to save this moment, wrap it up and lock it away from prying eyes, and only take it out when you need to remember how good it can feel to be alive.
“Wanker,” Potter says before he catches Draco’s lips with his own. Draco chuckles, enjoying the soft slide of Potter’s mouth.
“Hrm, thanks for your concern, I’m quite alright.”
A knock came at the door.
“Happi
Your face heats at his words, but you’re too gone now to really be embarrassed, aren’t you? You’ve gone this far, you’re naked and alone with him, and you’re letting him touch parts of your body that no one else has touched, ever.
“You can start by chopping the onions,” Potter said, a weary expression on his face.
I decided to owl Hermione and she agreed to meet with me and take a walk and talk about things. I hope she can help me sort this out.
“Yes?” he breathes, closing his eyes.
A week later, Harry was accompanied by Ron and Hermione to the Marathon, as well as loads of reporters who wanted to document every single step of the way, a “perk” he had to endure since he was the defending champion of the race. Ron tried to calm him down by making jokes at the expense of the nosiest reporters, while Hermione took the lead and wove her way through the crowd to where Harry’s group was supposed to start. Reluctantly, Harry waved them off when they got there, but luckily, the reporters weren’t allowed in here either, and Harry took the opportunity to close his eyes and try to find his focus, to try to conjure a mental image of running with calm, deliberate steps and measured breathing.
It was quiet in the room for a long time and Draco didn’t have the nerve to turn around and see what Harry was doing if he had somehow worked himself up again. Draco didn’t know how he’d be able to reign in Harry’s anger, and a part of him wished he didn’t have to. Harry was right. But being right wouldn’t bring all the victims justice.
It feels strange to have Potter in his home without there being some sort of agreement beforehand on what they’re about to do. They usually come here in an urgent frenzy, practically wrestling their clothes off, or after a late night Floo call or owl. And on the few occasions that Potter has showed up unannounced, he’s always had that sly crooked smile that has let Draco know exactly what he’s come for. But this time, Potter just steps in and carefully closes the door, keeping his distance, avoiding eye contact.
“It’s not dangerous, Harry. I know it’s unnerving, but we only need to find some shelter,” you say, thinking hard. And then you remember: “The Hermit’s hut.”
It’s such a ridiculous thought that Potter would ever say something like this to him, he still expects to be on the receiving end of Potter’s contempt, not his praise. Draco has to laugh, he’s still a little bit out of breath, and that’s probably what the tickling in his chest comes from, a subtle scratching deep down. “Yeah, I know.”
Harry laughed again, and then he caught Draco’s bottom lip between his own. “Yeah you’re right,” he said before kissing Draco again. “Pansy can fucking wait.”
“...oh.”
The tracking spells only lasted so long, so if Draco had to place the blame on someone it would be the Ministry—but that was another conversation entirely.
“And—and you?” Draco managed to get out just before Harry’s other hand pressed against his neck and turned his head so their eyes met.
The second time it happens you’re out in the forest, harvesting new plants. The hepatica and the wind-flowers are blossoming and you want to pick them when they are just right. It’s Harry’s first time out and he seems to enjoy the openness of the woods, as opposed to the never ending stone brick walls of the monastery.
And you know that it’s not going to be easy, having to hide who you are from the rest of the world, having to hide how much you love Harry. And perhaps you will be punished in the afterlife for this, for loving another person so much you can hardly breathe sometimes, simply because you were both born as men.
Alex snapped his fingers and a blonde wizard similar to Alex in height and build entered with Harry by his side.
Anyway, then I started joking about how I’m so horny all the time that I’d even be willing to have sex with Chad Michael Murray, and gladly so because that’s how hot he is and that’s how horny I am. Draco thought I was super funny, and he said he’s also extremely horny all the time, that even yesterday when I was touching myself was distracting to him, even though he’s straight as well.
Draco thought, but right now he didn’t care, he just needed to get out, needed to escape. His feet hit cool sand and he realised that he’d forgot to put his shoes on in his haste to leave the others. He paused for a second, scoffing to himself, before picking up speed again. Of course, it’d been
It’s late in the evening, they're all out at their regular pub
“So, how do we do this?”
“No, I—” he starts, but then coughs, and when he continues his voice sounds strained. “I’m not really in the mood. Or I— I remembered I have someplace to be, I need to—”
Dinner is pleasant, it really is. Harry finds himself being able to forget Draco and his own broken heart for a few brief moments, but those thoughts keep coming back to him every time. So after he walks Cho back to her hotel and they say goodbye, and after she gives him a shy smile from under her fringe, he can’t do anything more than kiss her on the cheek, thank her for a lovely evening and say how nice it was to see her again. It wouldn’t be fair to her to lead her on, he thinks when he notices her disappointment. He’s still too hung up on Draco, and even if it wouldn’t lead to anything, and even if it wouldn’t be like cheating, it feels wrong to kiss her.
Because in a twisted, debauched sort of way it feels so good, it always does. It feels incredible
“Shoes. Off.”
“I don’t. Tell me.”
“I’ll show you casual, Potter,” Draco sneers behind him. “I’ll fuck you so un-casually that you’ll forget that tart ever existed.”
“All right, gentlemen,” the clerk (apparently named Steven) said, “you’re all checked in now. Here are the keys to your room, and here’s a list of all the activities we have available. The pottery class is especially popular and will fill up quickly so if you want that one, don’t wait too long to book it. We also have couples treatments, such as massages or facials, and of course, the main thing here is the couples counselling. Please fill out this form together, and it will automatically match you with the most suitable counsellor for your needs and your personalities. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if something is unclear.” Steven upped the brightness of his smile even more, now resembling a light bulb more than a human being.
.” Potter’s cheeks went a little darker at her words. “
“Yeah,” he coughs. “Brilliant. Thanks.”
It takes a while for Harry to come down from his rush, to have the world outside of his and Draco’s bodies return to his consciousness. Draco has at some point slid out of him, and he’s lying beside Harry, one leg slung over his hips, his face buried in the crook of Harry’s neck, still panting hotly against his skin. Harry’s arse is sore, and his muscles are aching, but he’s never felt this relaxed in his entire life. He heaves a deep sigh and strokes Draco’s thigh in slow circles, turning his head slightly to be able to draw in Draco’s scent. He’s just about to tell Draco how wonderful he feels when Draco breaks the silence.
“For what it’s worth, Harry, the only person you need to seek the approval of is the Lord himself. And I believe He loves you.”
“Just think about what I said, Harry.”
Draco straightens up slowly, twitchy, and then falls to the floor on his back, slinging an arm over his eyes. He’s still panting, his chest heaving with the effort of breathing, and Harry doesn’t dare to move. He wants to comfort Draco, cradle him, stroke his cheek and make sure he’s not in pain anymore. But that’s not the kind of relationship they have, that would be far too intimate in Draco’s opinion, Harry knows that much. Because not only does Draco not do love, he doesn’t do weakness either.
He even grabbed my hair, which stung a bit, but I liked it, I think. Or I wouldn’t mind if he did it again, or if he did it harder, or if he used it to hold me still and fuck into my mouth.
need to hear the answer to Pansy’s question? You were there as well.”
“Can I?” Potter motions for Draco’s hand lying on his stomach, and when Draco nods he takes it to put between his own hands. They’re warm and a bit calloused from all the work on the brooms, and the contact makes Draco relax back into his pillows again. He’s had those hands all over his body, he thinks, they’ve caressed his back and his thighs, they’ve been wrapped around his cock and opened him up on multiple occasions, but none of it has ever made him feel this vulnerable. This naked.
“Hmm, and here I was, thinking I was the early bird, but I guess you beat me to that as well, didn’t you?”
Draco nods, grabbing Harry’s biceps and spinning them into darkness. Surprisingly they land outside Harry’s flat, and Harry wonders fleetingly if it means something, wants to ask why Draco brought them here this time. But Draco is standing so close behind him, undulating his hips slowly against Harry’s arse, and all other thoughts disappear. It even takes a while before Harry manages to open the door, because he’s so turned on that his hands are trembling.
Until you hear footsteps behind you, and you both break apart quickly. You grab the nearest item you can find - a rake - and Harry takes the watering pot and goes to fill it up. When Brother Matthew rounds the corner you’re both well apart from each other, but you feel like anyone looking at you could tell what just happened, could tell by the way you keep glancing over at where Harry’s standing, with butterflies and maggots filling your stomach.
“Oh, fuck, Draco. Yeah, like that,
“I think you do,” Harry said, turning fully towards Malfoy and taking one step closer.
Draco is quiet for so long that Harry starts to suspect that he didn’t hear the question, but then he sighs. “I didn’t ask you to stop because… Because I didn’t want you to. I wanted to…” he clears his throat awkwardly. “I wanted… to
The only time you’re truly happy.
“Hmm. How so?” Harry says, bringing his arms around your waist, pressing you closer.
Dear Diary,
“Because,” he sighs, letting his hands fall into his lap. It hurts. “Because I knew you’d be worried, and that you’d try to convince me to seek help, and… I didn’t want that. I know what’s to come, I know the cure and I know I won’t get it.”
“We’re going to get them. We just need to rethink our strategy a bit and,” Draco leaned in and pressed his forehead to Harry’s, “Keep them convinced we are what we say we are.”
You realise he’s genuinely worried about finding a body here, so you turn around, smiling gently and comfortingly at him. “He did. But he wasn’t alone, and the monks that lived in the monastery at the time buried him in the graveyard after.”
“Harry.” Draco’s voice is firm but kind. “If you really want me to fuck you, you need to stop doing that or I’ll come before I get the chance.”
But somehow, Harry’s warm body next to his and his calm breathing lulls Draco into sleep, because the next thing he sees is a nurse smiling brightly at him as she reads his chart, telling him that he can go home whenever he wishes to. Harry helps him pack up, his clothes wrinkled and his hair mussed, but his eyes bright whenever Draco meets his gaze.
“You mean you’ve nev—” Pansy starts, but Draco interrupts her by speaking loudly.
It’s not fair, he thinks. It’s not fair that he survived having Lord fucking Voldemort living in his home, that he survived defying him, survived a room filled with Fiendfyre that killed one of his friends, survived the final battle of Hogwarts, and now
When you go to bed that night, you have trouble sleeping. You shut your eyes firmly, trying with all your might to concentrate on breathing calmly, but there’s a restlessness in your body, and you only see him in your mind. You toss and turn and sigh, and you desperately try to ignore the reaction your body has, but it won’t do. You clench your fists so tightly your nails prick your palms, and you chant through seven Ave Marias and three Pater Nosters before you’re finally able to fall into a fitful sleep.
Draco snapped to look at Harry who was leaning against the wall, swaying slightly.
Potter chuckled, shuffling closer, and Draco’s palms suddenly felt extremely sweaty. He tried to wipe them as discreetly as he could on his trousers.
Potter’s taken aback at the sight of him, the hand rubbing his neck falling to his side when he looks at Draco.
Draco was standing in front of him again, and this time both of his arms were on Harry, holding onto him firmly.
. He was grabbing Harry around the waist, while Harry’s hands were on Malfoy’s shoulders, and they were so, so close. Malfoy had his face turned upwards, and if Harry just tilted his head a little bit their lips would —
The initial amusement of Draco conjuring up flowers had been replaced with fear when Harry realised they came from his body rather than him creating them with magic. The attack Draco had the other day scared him half senseless, and now Harry’s starting to suspect that something is very
“I’m sorry if I got a little carried away, it’s just… I find it hard to control myself because you always make it feel so good.” Shit, that wasn’t revealing too much, was it?
“Oh, you mean this?” Malfoy gestured over his bare chest, making Harry, quite involuntarily, look at it again. Malfoy’s grin grew even wider, but then he quickly schooled his features to a look of innocence. “I’m so sorry, Potter, is this distracting to you?”
“Right. Your passport fell out of your hand and
A warm feeling which has nothing to do with the searing pain in his side fills Harry’s chest. It’s still strange to think that he and Draco, despite their shared history, actually ended up here.
“Malfoy!” he shouted, stomping out of the kitchen. “Malfoy! Where the fuck are all the plates?”
She lets go of him and turns to lean back against the chair, slumping a bit. “Okay, fine, be like that. I just wish you would’ve told me sooner so they could’ve operated on you.”
Draco blinked, confused, and turned his head towards Potter. He was so close that it would’ve been hard for Draco to focus on him even if he’d been sober. Which he wasn't. And neither was Potter, apparently. Very much apparently. Because why in Merlin and Morgana’s name would he be standing here, basically
You know he’s teasing, but you cringe at his words, sharp like needles against you. His face softens when he notices your reaction, even though he’s taken off his glasses, and he steps closer, and you can see that his eyes have gone a little wider, his breathing a little shallower. You swallow, but you don’t break the eye contact, and neither does he. He steps closer still, reaching out a hand, and you hold your breath. He’s so close that you can see all the tiny details of his face: the fine lines around his eyes, the flecks of gold in his green eyes, framed by thick dark lashes. Your entire body is tense like a harp string, and you’re entranced by those eyes, his presence, the sound of the rain against the roof. He’s still looking at you as he opens your belt and drops it on the floor. He’s still looking at you as he grabs the hem of your tunic, and he doesn’t even need to ask you, you lift your arms in invitation, helping him drag your clothes over your head. He’s still looking at you when you’re finally standing in front of him, as naked as the day you were born, shivering slightly in the damp air that isn’t fully heated by the fire yet.
“All right class, settle down. Settle down, please!”
It’s getting increasingly hard to breathe now, he can feel the vines tightening around his chest, his lungs, his heart, and he needs to struggle for every scrap of air. He flops down on the floor as well, sitting opposite Pansy, his head in his hands.
“I didn’t say that,” Harry mumbled.
“But why now? I thought —”
Healer Goodwin just inclines her head once, curtly, and turns to leave, but stops in front of the door since someone is blocking it. “I’m sorry, visiting hours are over.”
I have to say it feels a bit weird to write into the void, but I’m getting used to it. It’s also comforting in a way I guess, to write to no one in particular. So once again, Hermione was right. I’ll never tell her though, she doesn’t need to get more smug than she already is.
The waiter then came over and deposited their starters in front of them.
famously good at talking to people about feelings.
He turned around and bolted for the door, but with the reflexes of a seeker, Harry apparated into the hallway, right in front of the stairs.
He pushes himself off of Harry and nudges him to turn around on his front, to which Harry obliges without protest, moaning as Draco doesn’t waste a second to part his arse cheeks and lick a broad stripe along the whole length of his crack. Harry gasps and flings his hand back to grab Draco’s hair, his other hand clutching the sheets as Draco licks again, pausing at his entrance and flicking the tip of his tongue at Harry’s rim. Forehead pressed to the mattress, Harry lets it swallow his moans as Draco continues to lick and suck and leave biting kisses along his hole. Draco tugs at his hips to get him up on all fours, and then slowly works one finger in while he kisses the small of Harry’s back. He’s really excelling at this, Harry fleetingly registers, he’s clearly enjoying how much Harry enjoys it.
You laugh fondly against his lips. “There’s barely any light in here. And you don’t even have your glasses on.”
We started watching One Tree Hill. It’s pretty good, there are some hot girls in it. Which isn’t really helping with the horniness, but oh well.
this is the first time I hear about this!” Pansy snapped. “And to think that Draco confided in
“Fuck work, I’m sleepy,” Potter mumbles, his lips tickling Draco’s chest. “I’m so comfortable here.”
“You’ve —“
“I think Mr Stems is referring to the Muggle word meaning psychiatrist, your Muggle equivalent, Mr Malfoy,” Harry supplied beside him, just as the peacock in Draco’s mental image swung its enormous tail against the manor roof.
Since many of the students were away for the Easter holidays, he and Draco had been with Neville to The Three Broomsticks, intending to have a quick drink of Rosmerta’s mulled mead, but had ended up staying for hours, talking and laughing together. Somewhere on the way back, after dropping Neville off by the greenhouses, they had started talking about Quidditch, and like with everything else, they couldn’t agree on anything, especially not which team was the best. But unlike when they went to school, nowadays these fights felt more… friendly. Like bickering.
You tip your head back, allowing him to continue further down. “She did offer payment for it but I didn’t accept it.”
The staff on duty had tried to get Harry to leave Draco’s bed but he’d staunchly refused, arguing that he was the very thing Draco needed to recover, and once the Healers had confirmed that Draco was in fact recovering, and rapidly so, they gave up and left them alone. Although one nurse insisted that Draco needed more space and had transfigured the bed into a double. Which hasn’t really made any difference since Harry’s been plastered to Draco’s body ever since, only leaving once to go to the bathroom, during which Draco missed his presence more than he’d ever be willing to admit.
“Okay everyone, great work!” Ms Allen clapped her hands to get the group’s attention. “Let’s head back to the house.” As she walked past Harry she gave him a disapproving look. “Don’t forget to stretch when we get back.”
Stay inside so the virus can
Pansy’s voice is like a whip through the air and it makes him turn around to face her. Her mouth is a thin line, her arms crossed.
“Kingsley. We need to contact Kingsley.”
After what feels like a lifetime, Draco’s breathing evens out and arduously he starts to sit up, like he’s old and fragile, finally leaning back against Harry’s vacated armchair.
Draco had known it would be a bad idea to go on holiday with Harry Potter and the rest of his Gryffindor cohort. He’d known that he’d be deeply uncomfortable most of the time, known that he’d feel entirely out of his comfort zone to be spending two weeks in a cottage by the beach in Cornwall. And yet, he’d agreed to go anyway. Because Pansy had only been dating Luna for two months and was still unsure about how well she fit with Luna’s friends, and Draco loved Pansy more than anyone in the world. So when she’d asked him to come with for moral support (“Please, Draco, I can’t be the only Slytherin among the war heroes! Please please pleeeeeaaaaase!”), he couldn’t turn her down.
“So, how’s living with Malfoy going?” Ron asked, while making sure his carrots were being chopped correctly and flicking his wand at the stove to light the fire.
Draco removes his fingers and shifts a bit on the bed, murmuring a lubrication spell, and then Harry feels it; the soft hardness of Draco’s cock nudging at his entrance. Draco’s brows are furrowed in concentration as he’s lining himself up and then slowly pushing himself inside Harry, and Harry hisses at the intrusion, at the sting of it, but somehow it also feels so
He made it to the door when, suddenly, behind him, he heard, “Thank you. I know you’ve got my back, I don’t think I could have done that without you.”  His heart swelled and he turned to look into clear green eyes.
“Yeah,” Harry whispers with a teary smile.
Harry tries to think straight, but it’s difficult while looking into mercury eyes again, and the only thing present in his mind is how he wouldn’t be opposed to watching Malfoy dance.
Suddenly a cold wind sweeps across your face, you look up at the sky as the first drops of rain start to fall, and then there’s a deafening crash as lightning strikes.
She laughs at him and swats him lightly on his shoulder, batting her eyelids. “No worries, Harry. Here’s your change.”
“How can you come in here for less than twenty minutes, eat only appetizers, and then leave for the night? I don’t think I’ve seen that couple come in for breakfast either.”
“You know, Harry, I think sometimes I underestimate you.”
“I can’t believe— “ He cuts himself off, pulling in even closer to Harry, and Harry knows it’s out of embarrassment. Regular Draco is the opposite of an open book, always guarded and keen on keeping his feelings a secret. But post orgasmic Draco is always more talkative and free-spoken, and Harry knows that if he’s still flustered it must mean it’s something he’s embarrassed about.
someone so I could —”
friends after all. I
Beside him, Pansy makes a sound somewhere between a sob and a scream, and Draco bites back the line he has about feeling relieved that he won’t have to put up with customers all day. “Worse? How?”
“I… I think that’s something that should remain between Harry and me.”
? He scowled at Pansy, the absolute traitor, but she merely shrugged and put her arm around Luna’s waist, whispering something in her ear to make her blush and giggle.
Draco decided to chime in, since he was the only one not in a couple and eager to get out of playing. “I agree. I mean, we’re not in school anymore, are we?”
Harry sits in Ron and Hermione’s kitchen. Ron is standing by the sink peeling potatoes and Hermione’s trying to put a bib onto a struggling Rose, sitting in her high chair.
“Sorry,” Potter whispers, and Draco snorts.
“Right,” Potter sighed, “I think it’ll be too risky to have you use a charm for chopping onions, I can show you how to do it the Muggle way.”
“Not necessarily in love, but it’s someone you’ve had strong feelings towards, and with time, they’ve developed into romantic ones.”
“Oh dear, what’s wrong with him?” Pansy stage-whispered to Hermione.
“Tell me to stop if — I don’t want to hurt you.”
“My lips are cold, too,” Draco said, batting his eyelashes at Harry.
“What's he going to do? Beat up the Savior of the Wizarding world? Uhn, stop that, it tickles.” Harry still had his mouth next to Draco’s ear, puffing warm breaths against it every time he spoke. Harry chuckled and backed away just enough to keep an eye on Draco’s ex, who seemed to still be watching them very intently with a tight grip on his pint. Harry barely registered the whine that left Draco’s lips before he gripped the back of his head and brought him in for a kiss. Draco squeaked and gripped Harry’s shoulders in surprise before giving in and melting into the touch. The kiss deepened, tongues intertwined and the ex was forgotten; at least until they heard a crash and broke apart to see where it came from. They watched the ex throw a couple of coins on the bar and stalk off. They turned towards each other and the tension ratcheted up instantly. Harry blushed and Draco huffed out an awkward laugh.
I didn’t bring it up. I didn’t know how to put it into words without sounding weird. And Draco is too valuable as a friend to complicate things with sex that won’t lead anywhere. But he did mention that he slept exceptionally well that night, and I couldn’t help but feel a little proud of that. I know he’s been having trouble sleeping lately, so it felt nice to be able to help him out with that.
And you fuck him rougher than you’ve ever done with anyone else.
“Truth or Dare? The bottle landed on you.”
Potter tosses on his shirt and gesticulates over his body, as if he’s a child who wants to show he was able to dress himself. “There, all done! You’ll be rid of me now.” His somewhat weary expression turns smug when Draco looks him up and down appreciatively. “See you later?”
“The Lord made me this way, Draco,” Harry says eventually. “I know that now. I tried, I tried so hard to be different, to be
He shifts behind you, grabbing the bottle of oil and pouring more of it into his hand.
He stops himself again, grabbing you by the wrists.
“It’s bad enough to be trapped in your own mind under these circumstances. But to be trapped in plain sight, it’s no wonder this wasn’t uncovered sooner.”
“I don’t need a bloody potion to want Draco Malfoy, you fucking moron. He’s brilliant, and witty, and fascinating as hell. Maybe you missed all that when you were trying to own him for his pretty face and gorgeous arse, but I suppose that’s your loss because he will NEVER be yours.”
Harry blinks at Draco, who looks composed now as he vanishes the mess on the floor and the spots on his shirt, stroking a stray strand of hair from his face with a hand that is not quite steady.
” an angry voice suddenly barked out behind Harry, and both he and Malfoy froze. Harry slowly turned around, and was not at all surprised to see Ms Allen standing in the doorway to the yoga studio, hands on her hips and a scowl on her face. “What the fuck do you think you’re doing? Do either of you think this is appropriate behaviour
“You need to tell me what’s going on.”
Sheila watched with eyebrows drawn down as the group left, bags slung over their shoulders. Harry and Draco were jostling each other as they went and she was happy to see the back of them. Thank goodness this week was finally coming to an end, she couldn’t stand a minute longer in the presence of those damn idiots and their fucking bullshit.
“But if anyone asks, it was during a very romantic dinner underneath the stars and you were down on one knee.”
And yet, as you come inside him, leaving panting breaths like kisses on his skin;
He slinks away, and Goodwin turns to Draco again. “He seems dedicated, that’s for sure.” She winks at him again, and Draco chuckles. “I’d never admit it to him, since he basically broke every rule and restriction this hospital has, but he was actually doing the right thing by staying so close to you.”
It was Potter.
He exhales shakily, kissing you slowly, tenderly. “Wait here,” he says, rising from the bed and walking over to the table to get something. You stay on the bed, missing the warmth of his body but enjoying the view he offers you. When he returns he’s holding a little bottle of oil.
“What, Harry?” Luna straightened up a bit to try and get a look.
Harry’s unceremoniously pushed down onto his stomach, grunting a bit as his chest hits the mattress and the air is temporarily knocked out of him.
“There is literally nothing between Harry and you,” Ron says.
Harry laughed, kissing along Draco’s spine down to the curve of his arse, continuing to open him up and finally pressing inside. Draco’s voice was soft as he egged Harry on, telling him to fuck him faster, deeper,
“There’s something I have to ask you,” you say when you break apart. “How did you find me?”
“Everybody! Hey, everybody, settle down! It’s time for Harry to open his presents!”
With an exaggerated clearing of her throat, Healer Goodwin sets up a Dicta-Quill and starts casting, ignoring Harry standing a few feet away from her with his arms crossed over his chest, and instead focusing on the lights and patterns that her spells are causing. “So, Draco, how are you feeling?”
“Uh, yeah, thanks Malfoy, I appreciate it,” he mumbled, glancing up when Malfoy sauntered off towards his room, the twin dimples above his arse moving tantalisingly as he went.
Pansy stands behind him, still in the doorway. It’s the first thing she’s said to him since they left St Mungo’s. She didn’t even tell him off when he was almost run over by a bus and she had to pull him away to save him. Draco closes his eyes, tears stinging behind the lids.
“Do you know how many times I wished that I could shut you up like this at school?” he’d murmured before he’d crashed their lips together again.
You look at him, trying to overcome your embarrassment at stating your wish so clearly. “I am. I’m really sure.”
“I…” Harry halts, closing his eyes again. It’s hard for him to state what he wants, to be so open with someone, to ask for something just for his own pleasure. But he’s thought about this a lot lately and he’s more than ready, and during the time they’ve been together Draco hasn’t made him feel anything but safe, seen, taken care of. He swallows.
Pansy bites her lip, looking almost fond, which is a strange thing to see on her face, Harry thinks. And then the truth of it all sinks in. He tenses up at the realisation, and he notices Draco does as well a second later.
“Of course Harry.” He gave a slight smile and headed down the hall.
“You do that, Malfoy.”
So, I probably won’t be writing as much now, because I’m a bit occupied at the moment, and I don’t really mind right now if every day looks the same, because as long as it involves being with Draco, I think I’m okay with that.
“You were being driven up the wall by Professor Potter,” a boy said behind his hand and the class dissolved once more.
Lilies. Fucking lilies again. If he didn’t hurt so much he’d scoff at them, because the symbolism is honestly getting a little tiresome.
“And no extra beds are available?”
“Sorry, I thought you had eyes to see me approaching.”
). Draco’s hands around his wrists, pinning him to the bed while he fucks him in deep, quick strokes, Harry’s back arching of its own will to get a better angle, Draco’s stuttering hips as he’s nearing his orgasm, his whispers turning into incoherent moans as he comes deep inside Harry, and there’s the ever present heat, heat,
“I suppose it doesn’t.”
“As best we can, love.” He intertwined their fingers and kissed the back of Draco’s hand before they entered the Head Auror’s office.
He wants to tell her it won’t, it won’t be fine, because he’s finally admitting to himself what he’s tried to block from his consciousness for weeks now: that he’s not worthy of love, not from Potter at least. And no matter how hard he’s tried to keep himself safe from being hurt, he’s been dragged kicking and screaming into this mess, into this chaos of emotions. And he’s finally admitting that he’s nearing the end, and there’s still so much he wants to do. And there’s still so much he wants to see. And he still has this awful,
You walk carefully in the dark for a while, feeling your way ahead, not daring to light the torch you’ve brought for fear that someone will see it from the monastery. It takes you longer than usual to reach the spot where you know you’re not in the line of sight anymore, but when you finally do you take out your firestriker and start hitting it against the stone you brought. The flame of the torch is a comfort: as long as you have it you’ll know where you are and where you’re heading, and you’ll be able to scare off wild animals. At least you hope you will.
Potter just laughed, his eyes crinkling at the corners, and if Draco hadn’t already been gone for the git he’d certainly be in danger now.
“Good. You may leave.”
“I… what?”
Carefully, Harry opened the box to see if the content really matched the exterior, and when he’d made sure it really did, he had to pause again to blink repeatedly against the sting in his eyes. Then he picked up the black plastic box, twisting it in his hands. The room was silent, probably because few of them knew what this was.
“Draco…” he starts, and everything around you both has faded away. There’s only you and him now in the world, only his eyes on you and his lips forming your name and you want to stop time and be in this moment forever, want to pretend that this is something you could do.
“I want to,” you choke out. “Please Harry, I want to.”
“Draco. And I’m not an angel.” Not even close, you think to yourself.
So he still refuses to tell anyone. He avoids meeting his friends during the day, opting for the more dimly lit pubs and nightclubs they frequent. He evades their concerned questions about his health with white lies about how he barely sleeps because he’s so busy with work and having fun, and that must be why he’s so pale. The thing is, he’s exhausted because he needs to get up so early every morning since everything takes so much longer. Because not only does he have to account for throwing up flowers all the time, they seem to be taking their energy from his magical core, and he’s noticing how even the simplest spells are harder for him to perform.
“Was that a compliment? Malfoy, I’m so very touched.”
Harry groaned. “It’s worse than I anticipated. He’s always complaining about how I leave stuff all over the flat, but he’s way worse than me.”
late by the time we made it into the kitchen again.
notice the way his arse perked out, or how his shirt rode up to expose his stomach, because his brain was occupied with the unexpected closeness, and not at all wondering if there were other parts of Malfoy’s body that smelled like that if one were to bury one’s nose against his skin. Finally, Malfoy apparently found what he was looking for, and he let out a contented little sigh as he came down on his feet, shaking his hair out of his eyes. He turned to Harry, and his eyes widened exaggeratedly into a look of faux surprise.
“Yeah, well, you know how it is. I’ve been here for so long I’ve seen most of it. I mean the lad’s been through enough, he could do with letting off some steam.”
He tries to suppress it, tries to hold back the constant flow of flowers, but it only makes it worse when they do come out. Some nights he doesn’t sleep at all because he’s dreading the moment he’ll wake up to a new wave of petals pouring out of him. Somehow it’s easier to be awake and wait for them, rather than wake up in a panic because he can’t breathe.
“You said you want me,” Draco said softly.
“Oh, but you like it,” Draco said, and there was a rasp in his voice that Harry hadn’t picked up on before, and it sent shivers down his spine.
Draco whined at Harry’s declaration and latched his hands onto his hips. A loud groan left him as Harry descended upon his neck with bruising bites and kisses. Draco pushed down on Harry’s hips, grinding his hardness into the answering one he found there. The vibrations from Harry’s growls against his neck had Draco melting into the couch. He was pliant and warm and didn’t want it to stop, but there was a slight prickling at his conscience that made him lift his hands to push at Harry’s shoulders.
“So we… hrm… We have no other option than spending this entire trip in the same cabin?”
Harry swallowed. “Can’t wait.”
“You know…” Harry said, thinking about Draco and his antics, from his obnoxiousness to his thoughtfulness. He thought about how Draco always seemed to know when Harry was down and needed a pick me up, or when he instead needed to be left alone to brood until he’d snapped out of it. He thought about how, despite their initial fears that it would all go to shit when they were teamed up as Unspeakables, they worked together well now, because they had become so good at reading each other. He smiled again, more genuine now. “He has his virtues.”
“Granger, Weasley, I was unaware you had graced us with your presence,” Malfoy said, quickly regaining his usual haughty tones.
“That’s a bit dark.”
, or, if he thinks about it, he’s not sure he’s ever heard Draco laugh like this at all, like he’s got no care in the world.
“Yeah. I’m ready,” he says, taking Harry’s hand. “Let’s go home.”
“Draco,” he mumbles, his voice so affectionate it makes your heart ache.
He appreciates the way she’s straight to the point and not trying to sugar coat the message, while still being kind and not sounding like she wants to spit on him and his Dark Mark. And still he wants to hex her into next week.
Malfoy stared at them all, then he closed his eyes, drawing in a deep breath. When he exhaled, Harry thought he heard words like “get used to being surrounded by Gryffindors,” but he wasn’t sure. Then, Malfoy opened his eyes again, fixing them with his deadliest glare.
Harry’s eyes were wide as he stared at Draco, who began to squirm as the silence lengthened between them again. He looked down at his hands, fingers twisting each other tightly making his skin turn red with the pressure.
Draco’s mind goes cold and clear. It’s like he’s a vessel that only takes in all the impressions around him, the soft humming of the atmospheric charms, the harsh light above him, Pansy trying not to collapse beside him. And at the same time, none of these really register, there’s only the movement of Healer Goodwin’s mouth and the words she’s uttering.
“Harry?” you ask, feeling your own breath on your skin.
with this information!” Pansy said, crossing her arms over her chest.
“It… It got hit with a scurrying away charm?”
“Well, obviously you didn’t learn anything, because it’s happening again, isn’t it?” you say, surprised to feel tears prickling in your eyes.
“I’m glad,” he murmurs, closer now, his breath tickling your ear, and you bite your lip to keep in another gasp threatening to escape out of you. Then, he leans in closer, the tip of his nose pressed just behind your ear, his lips brushing the tendons of your neck, and you feel your body respond immediately, every sensation running through you, collecting below your midriff.
, is that clear?”
Harry nods, unable to speak around the lump of affection in his throat, and then he gasps as Draco’s finger, slick with lube, circles his hole.
“It was kind of cool, though, maybe you can teach me how someday? If I promise not to tell anyone?”
Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Draco blink a few times.
Draco’s looking at himself pumping inside Harry, trembling, and Harry realises he’s still restraining himself to make it easier on Harry, but he doesn’t want him to hold back, and he wants him nearer, so he brings one foot to nudge Draco’s arse.
You stand still, and watch him, watch the way he moves, so familiar to you by now. You’re not entirely certain he did forgive you, but at least you got to say what you needed to. Even now, you’re not sure if you were right to try to make amends, perhaps it would be for the better to have Harry keep his distance, but you find it impossible to stay away from him, unbearable to have him so close and not be able to talk to him. You close your eyes and take a deep breath, silently asking God what to do. You need a sign, something, anything, about what to do, about what’s right.
Draco choked back a swell of emotion that threatened to surface and met Harry halfway for a sweet, slow kiss that built-in urgency. The tension and heat from earlier roared back into the room, threatening to strangle the occupants with need. Draco slid down the back of the couch to lie on his back, Harry following and straddling his hips. Harry sat up, grinding down on Draco’s lap, wrenching a strained moan out of him. He placed a hand on Draco's chest to keep him in place and pulled his wand out of his pocket. He muttered a few spells then threw it on the coffee table before attacking the buttons of Draco's shirt.
“ … “
Ron clears his throat, awkwardly shuffling his feet. “Right. I’ll just… I’m going as well.”
“Okay, so why haven’t we?”
“Look, Potter, can’t you just go down there and work your charm and get us out of this mess?”
more than necessary.”
“Oh, nothing, if your goal is to pass as a member of the cleaning crew.”
But he’s not, he thinks, looking at the stunning mess in the basin. He hasn’t been for weeks now, though he’s been able to hide his predicament from everyone long enough. Except, of course, from Potter. But he can’t think about Potter, because every time he does he feels a new stab of pain in his chest, a new set of seeds taking root, growing and breaking out of him.
curse. The
Harry let Draco order for him, hand flexing under his as he squeezed it in front of the waiter, a flashy smile and cheesy line thrown for cover. He ignored the worried glances from Draco and took stock of their surroundings.
muttered “bloody thick Gryffindors.”
“What do you mean?”
the suite!”
“Why didn’t you tell me?” she says, hurt punctuating every syllable, making him flinch in shame.
“You know… It could be that I was the one asking.”
“ … “
Draco shrugged one shoulder, biting his lip. “As far as I knew, you and Ginny were still together.” He didn’t dare to admit that the real reason he’d thought Harry was playing a joke at his expense, was that some part of him thought he deserved it.
And this thing they have, even without the emotional intimacy, is still amazing, Harry thinks as Draco caresses his clothes off, kissing every inch of his skin. It’s like they know instinctively how the other wants it, they’re so in tune with each other in a way that Harry has never experienced.
“You really love this, don’t you?” he says with fond amusement.
“But— But—” It’s so strange that those knickers could have this effect on him, Harry can’t even voice how the loss of them makes him feel so bereft.
Pansy tilted her head and smiled sweetly at him. “What
“I heard what the Prior told you,” he says sharply. “About us. That he knows.”
You notice there’s a bitterness to his voice, and you want to say something to make it go away, but your mind has stopped working upon seeing the hairs forming a path from his navel and disappearing under the sheet you’ve draped over him for privacy. His stomach is moving up and down as he breathes and speaks, and you’re hypnotised by it, and a part of you wishes that the fabric would slip down further. You have to shake yourself.
“Yeah. Later.”
“If we’re going through the details,
With the reassurance of finally knowing what to do, you finally fall asleep.
caught on fire surprisingly well. I sort of panicked and just wanted to get rid of it so I threw it away and of course it landed on the kitchen table. Which wouldn’t be so terrible in itself, if it weren’t for the stack of newspapers that it landed on. So, well it was a disaster, really. I got so frantic I forgot the
Harry chuckles and leans closer to start trailing kisses along Draco’s neck, which makes him arch his back towards Harry.
Malfoy yanked up his pants and trousers and pulled the handle to flush the loo. “If you don’t want company, you know there’s a lock on the door,” he said without so much as looking at Harry. “Scoot over, I need to wash my hands.”
The door shut closed and Harry was unable to move.
He sighs deeply, looking like he’s trying to remember something. “I really thought this was heaven. I thought I’d go there if I tried to do penance for…” he starts, but trails off.
“Brilliant,” Draco smiles, glancing at Harry, whose face lights up.
Draco’s present!” With a spark of satisfaction he heard Blaise mutter “Ow!” when the box undoubtedly smacked into his head as it zoomed towards Harry’s outstretched hand.
“Well,
Because it wasn’t Pansy.
Harry grunts in frustration, because obviously Draco is not letting this go. “What’s the problem? It was
“So… why didn’t you ask me to stop?” he asks eventually.
Draco sighed exaggeratedly and cast a cushioning charm for Potter’s bum. He was rewarded with an endearing little squeak, followed by a soft laugh. Draco kept his gaze out over the water, but in his mind’s eye he could vividly see the way Potter looked anyway: unruly hair falling into his face, bottom lip caught between his teeth in uncertainty. Draco sighed again.
Harry spit out his toothpaste. “Malfoy. What. The. Fuck. Are you doing here?”
Shit, I’m getting hard just thinking about this. I should stop. I can’t even say how it felt to have
Harry takes the little package but hands it back immediately.
After Draco collapses at Pansy’s he’s rushed to St Mungo’s, and it only takes one look at him and the bloody flowery mess on his clothes and a few questions from the Healer on site for them to diagnose him with the Hanahaki Disease. They send him home with some potions to relieve the pain and open up his airways, something that looks and smells similar to the herbicide his mother would use at the Manor. It helps a little bit initially, but then it gets even worse, so he stops taking them. Better to ride this out than try to suppress it, he should’ve thought of that. He knows that there are no shortcuts in this.
