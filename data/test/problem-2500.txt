“Thanks--
Malfoy’s eyes widened slightly. Anyone else would have gawked, or babbled, but the Malfoy mask was impeccably intact.  “Indeed. Well, wonders never cease. Did she also tell you how it all began?”
“You’re almost ready for me to fuck that tight pink hole. Is that what you want?” Malfoy asked huskily, licking another long stripe. “If it is, I need you to ask.”
“And? Where is he?” Harry’s nerves jangled as he asked. If Pansy wouldn’t tell him the truth, he didn’t know what he’d do.
“No, he’s got a point, ‘Mione,” Ron argued, peering over Harry’s shoulder to finish reading the letter. “Merlin, it’s sappy. Maybe Malfoy was supposed to be a Hufflepuff after all.”
“Yeah, ‘s nice.”
Draco mouthed Harry’s cock through his pants, and the sensation of his warm mouth was almost too much to bear. He helped Harry shimmy off his pants and jeans, and Harry was fully naked.
"Yes, but--"
And appear he did. After that day, Harry seemed to run into Malfoy wherever he went. It started small, with Malfoy happening to take the same routes to class as Harry did. Malfoy would happen to be in the library if Harry had dropped by to study, or would already be ensconced in the common room when Harry stepped through the portrait hole. If he’d decided to pop by Hogsmeade of an evening, Malfoy would come striding down the path behind him, saying that he fancied a drink or needed a new quill. If he hadn’t known better, Harry would have thought Malfoy had a Marauder’s Map too, for he seemed to know exactly where Harry was at all times.
Despite his confusion, Harry was still angry. (It felt rather like fifth year all over again.) “Malfoy. Come to stick your tongue down my throat again, then?”
“Right. Best get on with it, then.” Harry told himself in a businesslike tone. His day off wouldn’t last forever, and it would be good to get things over with.
“Stop, stop, stop,” she commanded, rubbing her eyes before she remembered that would cause wrinkles. She smoothed down her (scandalously short) miniskirt instead. “You’re all awful at this. We need something more fun.”
Potter,
“Oof. You know, this isn’t terribly dignified.” Draco looked almost cute for once, with his half-done tie slung around his neck and tow-like hair drying in odd directions. Not dignified at all, but terribly lovable.
“I must say, this museum may not have been the best one with which to begin,” Draco drawled, following Potter around as he stared up at the art. “There seems to be very little organization or flow between the different galleries. And I have no clue what this piece is meant to represent.”
and incredibly distracting.
Judging by past experience, Harry did know, but he still laughed as he walked away. His suspicion of Malfoy’s soft side was confirmed when the man returned with a literal flower crown. Deep green leaves surrounded lemony yellow blossoms, and it all smelled heady and sweet.
So Harry had taken to sitting with Seamus in most classes. His phoenix inheritance gave off too much warmth for other students to be comfortable, but Harry craved it. History of Magic was as boring as ever, but at least Harry could be warm for once. In one particularly boring class, Harry became so comfortable he didn’t even notice as his head nodded closer and closer to the fire wreathing Seamus’s wrists. Until his hair caught on fire.
Harry leaped to his feet. “You just apologized for that!”
“I’ll convince you to crack eventually, Draco. And I always get what I want.”
at my mate, I’ll incinerate you where you stand.”  He smiled tightly, malice concealed behind his teeth. “Good night, then.”
Draco raked a hand through his own hair and started pacing in the small clearing. A branch snapped loudly under his foot, making Harry jump. “--I thought we were doing okay, I thought you were happy--”
, it can wait,” Draco grumbled, fighting the urge to
“Hmm. Maybe you’re right.” Harry fell back against the cushions, heavy with food and thought. Could he really just be whoever he wanted now, instead of being the Boy Who Lived? Why hadn’t he ever realized that before? A world of new possibilities seemed to unfold before him. He could be Just Harry, with Just Draco. Doing whatever he liked, instead of what everyone expected. That didn’t sound too bad at all.
“If you insist.” Malfoy sniffed. “Would you like to visit Hogsmeade this weekend?”
Harry snickered. “Yeah, the last one was awful. Hey, what’s a macaron?”
tray. “Oh look, you finished the whole spidey! I’m thrilled. It’s perfectly safe to eat, I’m sure I don't know what all the fuss was about. We’ll be allowed to stay open then, yes?”
as delightful as I find this to be, can we resume this shortly? I’m developing a crick in my neck.”
Harry then stumbled down seemingly every staircase in the castle, trying his best to dawdle at interesting tapestries and breathe deeply. He tripped on countless little tufts of tangled grass on his way to the lake’s shore, and almost turned his ankle in a niffler’s hole. Somehow, Malfoy arrived only a few moments after he did.
“Malfoy, wh--” A very confused Harry tried to interrupt, but Malfoy’s thumb stroked roughly across his lips. Practically a caress, if a very dominant one. Apparently no arguing back would be allowed.
“It’s adequate,” Draco murmured. “Not as striking as wizarding art, but this piece is quite nice.”
Harry thought sadly. His heart felt more icy and closed-off than ever as he considered how their entire friendship had been a lie.
Truth was, he was disappointed even if he knew. When it suddenly became real and hit him. Ron had actually given up on him... Then there was no more gladness nor relief. Just sadness. And he started hating himself a bit more, for being such a mess that he even drove his best friend away.
Harry is looking for some quiet loneliness again. But why does Malfoy seem to be everywhere ?
But something else was wrong. The way he was looking at his son... His face was icy, eyes devoid of light. He even looked... scornful. Harry felt lost, why was his dad looking at him like that ? Why wasn't he full of love and joy to see him ?
He promised, he was determined. He was begging for a clue, he would fight with his fist, let dementors steal all his happy memories to get it. The mission already intoxicating his mind, he stopped fidgeting, let his arms drop to his side, looking at Sirius with his eyes burning from resolution. He would never abandon him here, no matter the cost.
Harry spat out with despise, adamant, fidgeting under the blond to try to free himself, hands pressing painfully on the boy's wrists. But Malfoy only clenched harder, bending a bit more to get his face, twisted with anger, closer to the Gryffindor's.
He corrected in a whisper. And he could feel her tense up at those words. Annoyed by the negativity in him that she couldn't seem to erase.
A voice brought him out of his morbid thoughts. Maybe he had actually dozed off a bit. A hand on his shoulder, Hermione was shaking him gently before taking a step back when he opened his eyes.
Suddenly, harry shrugged as he got out of his own head, getting his attention back to the blond. His brows still burrowed.
Harry mumbled rolling his eyes then looking away. But it was actually, better. Like Malfoy would say, it was more familiar. And familiar was comfortable. It had become rare, and so also precious. And it made Harry want to smile again. But he didn't, or only faintly.
He shouted as he suddenly grabbed Malfoy's collar to shake him, pointing towards the stone with his other hand.
He could see a curled up silhouette against the back wall. Almost just a shadow, so miserable it barely looked human. Again, pushed by an inner voice, Harry knew he had to go see that man. Or maybe it was a woman, he couldn't tell. So he walked to the bars, trying to take a better look at the prisoner, indeed a man. He was rocking back and forth, mumbling something that made no sense, clearly out of his mind. He didn't even seem to notice Harry's presence.
He started with a smirk but stopped himself when he realized what he was about to say.
Ron said, rolling his eyes then looking at Harry who seemed determined to keep his hood down to his nose. At first, he wanted to hide under his invisibility cloak, but Hermione had managed to convince him to leave it in his trunk.
He spluttered in confusion, he felt like he was a child again, like he hadn't learn how to think or how to speak yet. With distress he took a few step back then dropped on his knees because the heaviness of the emotions was crushing him. And all the sudden, his dad was able to get up. Walking slowly to his son who was now panting on all fours and struggling with tears, he kneeled before him.
The voice became a bit more clear as he could feel himself dying in his dream.
The girl sighed, placing her fingers on her forehead as if she had a headache. Closing her eyes, she took an annoyed deep breath.
Again, she refused to let her determination yield. Strong eyes locking in the emerald gaze that got blurry with tears. Harry shivered, trying to contain them. He felt something warm flow in him, relief and love. The words hit him even harder after his argument with Ron. The redhead had made it clear that he wanted none of the new Harry. But Hermione, on the contrary, she was willing to embrace it and make her peace with the idea that he would probably never be the same again. She was accepting him and this was the most beautiful thing he had heard in ages.
It was enough to make him stand up again, on alert. He looked around him, he had to get out of here and help them. But there was only one door in the room, the one he had came through. His only solution then was the windows, and he rushed to try to open them. But there was no handle, they seemed sealed. So he tried to be brave, acted without thinking and took a few step back before running right into the window to break the glass. But he was brutally thrown back, like he had been hit by an invisible wall, a force field. There was no way for him to go outside it seemed...
Harry said, acknowledging his lack of efforts towards the blond. Why would he have made some anyways ? At the time, things seemed so well established between them. Deadly enemies, two perfect opposites. Now all of this seemed to have lost its meaning.
(Yep I'm craving for you feedbacks ._. )
He turned his head to look at his friends. Ron was already at the door and Hermione was waiting in front of him. he could feel her repressed desire to reach out to him, he saw it in the way she was twitching her fingers. Their eyes were begging him. They were both afraid to see Harry disappear at any second. To fail so close to their goal.
The Slytherin protested. Turning around to face Harry with eyes wide from dismay. Seemingly tired and discouraged by how stiff the Gryffindor was in convincing himself he was still the asshole he had been, or pretended to be.
He breathed letting his back fall against the wall, his lips twitching from a faint smile. Letting his eyes drop on the floor then around him, almost shy from the tingly feeling he had in his heart. It was only a vague and thin happiness, but to him that was already overwhelming, because it had been so long since he had felt any of it. There was something peaceful in the air now and he took a deep breath to take it all in.
Harry's walk became more and more wobbly with each steps he was taking, as he was allowing the emotions to overwhelm him once more. Tears finally dropping, falling heavy on his cheeks. He was already sobbing when he got to the end of the long bridge. Stopping himself to look at the sky as if he could find meaning or salvation in it. But it was just a grey ceiling, filled with clouds. It was probably going to rain again.
Eyes on the black sky above him, he finally saw a silhouette appear on the edge. Platinum blond hair looking down at him. And for the first time in his dream, Malfoy was a symbol of hope. He could feel life flowing trough his veins again. Struggling on the corpses, Harry tried to get up one more time, holding himself on the wall of dirt to desperately reach a hand out to the Slytherin.
She softly said with a laugh, pressing a hand on Harry's shoulder as she moved passed him to head to class. The boy brushed her hand with his as she did. Thankful that she was understanding and was letting him miss charms without lecturing him or trying to go.
He only went back in time for the fourth class, after a quick shower to remove the sweat and clear his head. He spent the rest of the day siting in the back. But getting lost in thoughts too easily, he was unable to follow any of the lessons. Malfoy didn't bother him with notes anymore though.
Harry's eyes widened, had it already been 20 minutes ? Guess Malfoy was right then, he was indeed lost... Yet, it shouldn't concern him. The Gryffindor didn't care to confess his thoughts to the Slytherin. It was even uncomfortable to have him asking about his well being.
She asked with an inquisitive tone. As if she was scandalized that he stayed in the back of the room. A bit of disappointment also in her voice, her gaze already moralizing. And as she questioned, the answer materialized when Ron walked past them with obvious annoyance. Without even glancing at Harry. Face angry, looking straight in front of him and his pace hasty. The raven haired boy winced. He wanted to sneer, it was so pathetic to see the redhead act that way. So openly mad it looked theatrical.
The blond scrunched his nose with a disgusted look. Waving a hand to discard the smoke that was coming his way.
Harry is ready to face the memorial. But he wasn't expecting to face Malfoy... again !
The Slytherin sighed, realizing the true meaning of the original question. He took his time to think of an answer, passing a hand in his hair, strangely unkempt. He shrugged.
Harry now spent his days sprawled on the sofa from the second floor, contemplating the void, lulled by the silence. He was losing himself in thoughts, constantly replaying the war in his head. Trying to go back in time to understand, to look for a flaw somewhere. As if to justify his guilt, a need to find a moment in past where he had made a mistake and let all this misfortune come out of it. So far, he had gone back to the graveyard, focused on the scene to analyze every details of it contained in his memory.
James suddenly said, with a cold tone filled with bitterness. And harry could feel the words hit his heart like a curse, gripping it and enclosing it tightly. Painfully. He couldn't even breathe. His mouth gapped in shock, eyes so wide his eyeballs could have just dropped out of their socket.
Then the ground started to shake, and the delicate wallpaper was now dripping with blood coming out of it. The air became suffocating and hot as the room was starting to fill with smoke.
Ron protested vividly and Harry understood a bit better what the blond told him at the lake. The Slytherin was not welcome here, and in a way, the Gryffindor found himself feeling a bit of admiration towards him. Because, he did come back, even knowing he would have to face the hate. He could have stayed hidden at the manor, but he didn't. That takes courage. He who had always thought the boy was nothing more than a coward found himself surprised. Thinking that he, himself, almost didn't come back although he was more than welcome...
Harry hadn't stepped outside a single time since the war. Locked in his godfather's gloomy house, his nose stuffed with dust and his skin that used to be so tan now turned milky due to the lack of sunlight. Under his eyes you could now find dark circles, betraying his many nights of insomnia. Hollowed cheeks from his lost of appetite. His old good look all gone. The glorious boy who had lived was only a mere shadow of himself. And he could see the concern grow in his friends's eyes every time they came for an imposed visit.
Hermione stated, being the comprehensive one. She was always trying to reassure him but Harry wondered if she wasn't losing hope herself. Maybe she was just better at pretending than her boyfriend. He felt bad at that thought, knowing his depression was just hurting his friends. But there was nothing he could do about it, otherwise he would have done it... Sometimes he was finding himself thinking he'd better leave them, break up their friendship so they could be free of him. Not having to care anymore. He was just a weight on their shoulders and they'd probably be better without him.
But the redhead, on the contrary, was impatient. He could no longer stand to see his best friend erasing himself, he forced and jostled in the hope to find the one he once knew again. But Harry wasn't sure that could happen. The one he once was died along with his enemy. Literally died... Thinking of it, Harry believed he may have actually left a part of him behind. That, maybe, he didn't come back whole.
Draco was at least a tad less bored now. Even the
doing this. I’ve got to go.” Harry said, shouldering his heavy bag again.
“Hermione, I think you’ve been in the library for too long. We would’ve noticed Malfoy being a dragon,” Harry remarked shakily.
, how did Malfoy always manage to look so good? He’d always been rather aristocratically pointy, but he’d grown into it, looking less like a ferret and more like a marble statue. The morning sunlight bounced off his skin and made him glow. Of course Malfoy had to be more elegant and willowy than ever. Harry was painfully aware of his untidy hair and old jeans. But the man looked like he’d just left a health spa or a runway, anyone would feel messy next to him.
Harry carefully folded the letter, his mind whirling with thoughts. The angry schoolboy and the volatile dragon he had known would both have responded with fiery anger or barbed threats. This mature attitude and well-wishing was completely unexpected. How did Draco always manage to be so unpredictable?
Harry shoved him playfully. “You absolute prick, you know that’s not what I meant. D’you think a dance is what the room wants?”
Hermione huffed and rolled her eyes.
"well, I don't know what made you think you were welcome here, but you aren't!"
“Yes, I know what a special is. I just-don’t know what they are for today. If you’ll excuse me for a moment, I can ask-” the blonde started, and was already walking backwards towards the counter when the guy yelled out again.
I don't own any of the characters or fancy spells. Rowling does. Enjoy!
“I did as you asked, Draco. Even though bastard Potter doesn’t deserve it.” the elf squeaked when he apparated into Draco’s room half an hour later, then muttered to himself, “Accusing you of such horrible crimes when you’ve been nothing but kind to him.”
"umm.. Yeah. If that's what you want."
It was only then that he heard the bathroom door slam and lock. Harry slowly fell to the floor and crawled over, then leaned his back against the door sobbing his eyes out. He would've been frantic and busted it down had he not continued to hear Draco's horrible thoughts and feel his emotions. At least that way he knew his ex-lover was still alive and hadn't taken another blade to his wrists. Draco was still alive. Barely.....
Draco only seemed to stare at him for a second before nodding slowly.
“Who cares what you bloody want? I don’t want to stay!” Draco yelled, wanting these eyes to stop looking at him. Harry was too sad. The blonde wanted nothing more than to give in, to stay with the brunette and their children, to have this life, his family, but he couldn’t. It wouldn’t be fair to them.
And it's all Harry can do to keep himself from ravishing the blonde right there.
"You said us being lovers would make you feel bad." he started slowly and Draco nodded, "what if we were just friends, then? Would that be alright?"
No money.
He needed to see Harry every week, even if he could never show his face to his ex-lover again. He just needed to reassure himself that Harry was alright. But Harry wasn't alright. He was pining after a murderer. He needed to stop.
Instantly, boxes of basically everything that Harry liked to eat appeared around them without Draco doing anything, and Harry beamed at him for the thought, but still had no appetite.
If possible, draco seemed to pale even more at the question and looked as if he wished for the world to swallow him whole. He wouldn't get away that easy, not again.
I... Not him. Not draco. Draco never asked Harry to leave him. Jashua did and Draco was afraid of him.
"It's always been you, Harry. Always."
Harry smiled despite himself. At least that thought wasn't a hundred percent horrible. Drcao remembers happiness. Remembers a time when he didn't feel this way. His time with Harry had actually helped him. Harry just needs to get him back to that, to make sure he never goes back to the drugs again. Then everything will be alright. Except...
Harry smiled widely as the idea came to him. Hermione would find a way to solve this. She always found a way. In fact, the young witch was known for her determination when it came to the ‘mystery medical field’. Of course, those mystery cases almost always turned out to be some kind of curse that the patient hadn’t been aware of, but, surely, Hermione could also find out how to cure whatever disease Draco had as well.
Harry couldn't hear his own screaming pleas or how violently his hands were yanking his hair. He couldn't feel the tears running down his cheek or even the potion Pomfrey forced into his system.
He grabbed the box, determined not to eat even one of the delicious treats and raced to their bathroom, where the blonde, as promised, was waiting, but hidden underneath the sinks, chatting with Myrtle excitedly about something and gesturing to a paper in his hand, then clutching it tightly to his chest as a content sigh left his lips.
"where are you going to go?" he had asked, frustrated, pulling at his hair to find something to do with his hands that didn't involve reaching out to touch Draco, whose life had just shattered and who was looking calmly at Harry, as if it were any other day.
Harry knew draco hadn't left his apartment since that day. It might have been self-centered to think draco was avoiding him, but he couldn't help it. He used to go to the market every Monday. Why wasn't he leaving? Is he ill? Did something happen? No. If he was dead the locator spell would've broken not remained at his home.
"It's alright." Harry murmured, not trusting himself to say much else. He embraced Draco who wriggled out of his touch and left the room without another word.
"want me to show you?" Harry asked, and started hissing upon Draco's hesitant nod. As the sinks started moving, Draco jumped back, terrified, but Harry caught him.
He's not being possessive . He's not. If this had happened to Hermione or Ron, he wouldn't have reacted so greatly. Sure, he'd be concerned, but he wouldn't count it as a personal failure. No. He'd only do that with Draco, who he had promised to protect no matter what when he found out about Lucius's abuse. Of course, he couldn't protect Draco back then, but he had another chance at the trials and let him walk away.
No. He couldn't go there. He couldn't. Draco has to be alright. He has to! Harry won't rest until he is, no matter how little he understood of why draco was feeling this way.
"There must be another way!" Harry continued, ignoring Draco's statement.
“I don’t want to talk about this anymore.” he mumbled and prayed to Merlin that his friend would leave it alone.
Suddenly, the blonde's fingers tightened around it and he looked up at Harry with a strange expression on his face.
Before he could think about it too long, Draco was suddenly yanked into one of the waiting rooms, only to realize it wasn’t a waiting room at all; it was Harry’s room. The brunette was there, unconscious on the bed, with a red-eyed Ron sitting next to him with a guilty look on his face, and Hermione standing next to Draco with her hand still on his arm, gazing at him with a sympathetic look.
“And ruin their childhood?! I- I want them to go to the park and make friends and go to nurseries. I want to be friends with the other mothers and have breakfast with them while we talk about how our babies kept us up all night. I w-want to have a job eventually so I am not burdening you. I want to be able to protect them from people who might bully or hurt them, but I can’t! Merlin, I can’t even think about doing any of that, about being around other people. It’s all too much! I can’t. I can’t even teach them spells. When they see me using your wand and ask me why I don’t have one, what am I supposed to say, then, huh? What excuse can I give?”
He didn't ask draco, only watched as his eyes glazed over and became absorbed in the memories Harry was so concentrated on showing him.
“Do it!”
" what do you mean, Harry?"
"I-I"
Draco wants to tell him that he tried to stop it, that he tried to tell Harry to go away, but he knows it will be no use. He should've never returned to the market when there was a chance he would see him there again.
It didn't work out. Privacy was another luxury he no longer had. After surviving two weeks on muggle streets, not bothering to look for any sustenance, he finally found it: that shard of glass. He still has it. He needs it. No matter how much time goes by, he always will. Draco ducked behind some dumpsters next to a hospital, hoping they could use his organs after he was gone. At least that would be one thing he could do for someone before he leaves the world. That's where Jashua found him, bleeding and unconscious. He brought him in and treated him, then insisted on taking care of him further. Draco still don't know why he didn't try to do it again. Maybe having a person who knew nothing of his past helped. Jashua didn't judge him. He loved him unconditionally. He took care of him and refused to let him even think about leaving his home after correctly assuming Draco had nowhere else to go. Of course, that was all a lie. Draco discovered a few months later that Jashua knew everything. He was a wizard and he was a muggleborn and he sometimes speaks of the horrors of the war and the death eaters without giving thought to how much it hurt Draco to be reminded of his actions. Draco didn't mind. He liked it. At least Jashua was being honest, not too gentle and coodling like Harry. He didn't give Draco what he wanted or needed. He gave him what he deserves.
"do those words look like they belong to someone who ever cared for you?" he had asked softly, pushing the letter towards the blonde. He  shoved it away violently, not wanting to see anymore of it, then a terrifying thought occured to Draco.
Draco doesn't respond for a bit and Harry casts that same awful spell just to *know*, but to his surprise, draco is thinking about his recipe for treacle tart and how he wants to make it for Harry like he used to in the hogwarts kitchens.
"If that's all you want, then it's easy, Draco. What do you need? Me knowing what you need will please me."
I know the tags say 'angst with a happy ending'. This isn't the end of the story, only the end of the first part. I've turned it into a series and, fair warning, the second part won't be published anytime soon. Thank you all for sticking with the story so far. I hope you enjoyed the first part!
Draco looked so frightened, so small, so panicked, that Harry knew he had to tell him the truth. The blonde couldn't get away without a wand, so Harry could just cast a locking charm on the bathroom if needed and get Pomfrey to collect Draco from there. An image of doctors having to drag Draco out of the room forcefully and him withering and panicking, trying to get away from them before inevitably collapsing in their hold, assaulted Harry's mind and he had to bite back a sob at the thought of doing this to his angel, but a frightened, upset Draco was better than a dead Draco.
The blonde paled at Harry's words and let go of his hands completely, wrapping his arms around himself.
"What's wrong with eating out?!" Harry snapped, not knowing what he did to cause Draco to climb back into his shell. Draco mumbled something inaudible.
“I said it’s forty galleons per potion. They should be applied directly onto the skin or any thin clothing. I brought you two as you asked for in the paper, but they shouldn’t be used within a week of each other.”
He hadn't even noticed Harry rutting against him, grabbing both their erections into a loose fist and stroking them back and forth. He wanted to be good for Harry. He wanted to be fine. He wanted Harry to take away all the bad memories and replace them with a good one. He wanted their last day together to be perfect. And what was more perfect than giving Harry morning sex?
He tried to will himself to stop crying and be fine just so draco's thoughts would stop, until it occured to him that that's exactly what Draco has been doing as well. He's trying to be normal so Harry won't hate him apparently. But Harry could never hate him. Even when his wand was pointed at Dumbledore, he still loved draco and knew there had to be an explanation for that.
Finally, he took a deep breath, let it out slowly, and left his room, intending on having a more civil conversation with the brunette. Though he hated to admit it, Harry was right from the very start when the brunette kept raving about how “communication is the key to good relationships.” Harry was nowhere in sight when the blonde arrived in the sitting room, though. He had gone to work. Draco waited. The brunette didn’t come back at midnight or the next morning. The blonde was starting to feel uneasy, starting to have ridiculous thoughts about the brunette and the she-weasley running away together and ignoring the blonde’s presence forever.
Harry knew, then , that even if his draco was in love with this other man, that Harry would still need him in his life. He  could just be a friend, even if the thought of that has his stomach in knots.
He remembers thinking it would be a consolation to update Harry's parents, tell them what a perfect man Harry had grown up to be, but who was he kidding? His afterlife would never be spent at the same place as the two people who birthed his beautiful Harry. No. He would wind up in a place much darker, much hotter. He wound wind up with his father, who would still look at him like the world's greatest disappointment, but that is what he is, after all. It's what he deserves.
Harry nodded quickly, stopping himself from requesting they meet sooner. He was already getting more than he thought he would given Draco's current state. With a wide smile, Draco turned and left the alley. Harry immediately apparated back to Grimmauld place, put up the most powerful of all silencing spells and let out the loudest of high-pitched screams. His throat hurt and he knew he was crying, but he couldn't stop. He was exhausted and he knew it would only get worse before his Draco starts to get better. That's how Hermione found him when she dropped by hours later unannounced. Unable to get an answer out of him, she simply forced a dream less sleep potion down his throat and put him to bed.
"oohhh dracoooo. You shouldn't scare me like that!" exclaimed the ghost, then saw the panicked look on her friend's face and rushed over to him. "What's wrong?"
Many apologies for not posting yesterday. My life has been all over the place. I'll try to keep up with the 'one chapter a day' thing from now on. Here's the chapter we've all been waiting for (Draco starts getting better). I am used to writing Angsty endings and Angst in general so please bear with me through what I hope will be non-cliche fluff. And please if Draco's progress or Harry's responses seem a bit unrealistic, let me know. I am always open to changing chapters, sometimes entirely. Enjoy!
"notebook" he gritted out. Myrtle rolled her eyes.
A tiny bit of fluff in the middle, but just a warning: it's all downhill from here and onto the next part.
“This isn’t going to be easy, Harry. Doing any one of those things in the wrong manner can result in another episode. If you’re sure, get a pen and paper and write down every single thing I say. And, yes, the details are important. We’re going to need to convince Draco’s subconscious that he’s the best person in the world in your eyes.”
"It was just a small potion to loosen you up. You've seemed so tense after that encounter with the saviour. I added a little something else, but we'll find out soon enough." Jashua told him, placing a hand on his stomach and using the other to undo Draco's belt, then remove his trousers.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Y-you're w-worse than them, you know?" he shouted, "Y-you- at least they were being honest about hating me! And - and at least Ron is trying to make me feel better, even if he’s doing it in the crappiest way possible! But you h-have t-to play all these m-mind games with m-me and g-get me to l-like you so it would h-hurt worse when you-you betray me!"
Harry was shouting by the end of his speech and he turned to see the satisfied look on Draco's face at the idea of his attacker getting put through hell, only to find that the blonde wasn't there and that there was a small pool of blood where he had been seated only a minute ago. Harry panicked, looking at the door, cursing under his breath and calling himself an idiot for scaring his Draco. His Draco hated to have decisions made on his behalf, and so did Harry, so why had he gone on like that?
So, he skipped the alley, wanting to hold Harry's hand for just a bit longer before he is forced to let it go forever. He besrly contained the tears when they came back to the alley. Draco needed to be strong. He needed to let Harry go, but Harry seemed so sad and Draco hated himself for doing that to his perfect Harry. He hid in the shadows, knowing that Harry would be back eitherway. It was clear the brunette wouldn't let this go anytime soon.
"H-how did I get here? Are we in the Wizarding world?" he screamed, seeming less and less at ease.
“Er...no?” he said, then continued when Harry started chuckling. “I just can’t believe I can do this. I never thought I’d hold a wand again. Thank you, Harry.”
And it was perfect...until harry's hand moved towards Draco's pyjama pants, teasing the wasteline. Draco was assaulted with memories of Jashua touching him, taking off his pants, shoving inside him, while Draco laid there, unable to do anything more than cry. And he was crying again, without meaning to. He kept it silent, though, let the tears flow out of his eyes freely to keep his breathe from hitching and his throat from constricting. Draco was fine. He was Jashua's boyfriend, so Jashua had every right to want sex and take it. Why was Draco acting like such a baby? Everything was fine... Except it wasn't.
"W-what?" he asked, not looking up.
“Harry…” the blonde started, not sure where he was going with the sentence. He just wanted to say the brunette’s name. Not one second after the word was out of his mouth, Harry stuck his tongue in and crashed his lips upon Draco’s. The blonde moaned as he was finally given what he wanted, casting any thoughts of reasons why they shouldn’t do this aside.
"What's wrong?" he asked, feigning innocence. The blonde exploded with fury. Why was Harry doing this? Draco had told him all the reasons and Harry couldn't even pose an argument. Why was Harry digging his own grave this way?
Draco was screeching by the end of it and Harry instantly moved to comfort Draco with a hug, when Scruffie suddenly jumped on Draco, frightening the sobbing boy. He yelped and Scruffie just shook his tail and began licking away his tears. Harry was afraid of Draco's reaction, given the past presence of werewolves in his home at full moons and the scars he saw on Draco's body that resembled a wolf's scratches. But, to his surprise, Draco started to giggle and began to pet Scruffie as soon as the dog laid down between them on the couch. Harry had meant to teach him to stop doing that, but the dog was just so damn cute and his puppy eyes didn't help Harry say no.
Please don't hate Harry too much. Just. Put yourself in his shoes, yeah? This is the third time he's almost lost Draco and this time Draco was completely aware of Harry's feelings and didn't care enough to take care of himself, unlike other times when he just thought Harry hated him. (That's Harry's pov, of course.) this attitude and the scene is what will start Draco's recovery, so you guys can look forward to that, even if it will be a bit angsty at first.
"I am quite aware. I was in the courtroom as well, you know?" he said, then quietly mumbled "I suppose it doesn't matter anymore. Nothing matters."
“I don’t want to do that.” the brunette murmured, still staring at the floor.
He had beamed at Jashua for a second before the dark-haired man spoke again quickly.
The sleep-walking.
"when are you going to admit defeat draco? You're powerless. You're just a sad little boy without his magic wand or his mommy and daddy to protect him. My father was the leading witness in their cases. He sealed those monsters' fates, he did. I watched them get the soul sucked out of them. It was beautiful. They got what they deserved and so will you. You're already broken. No money. No prospects. No friends. Nothing. You're nothing, Draco. You're worse than nothing. You're the reason many are dead. You're the reason the great Harry Potter is dead. You did that to him. You're just my toy now. How does that feel? The great Draco Malfoy reduced to someone's bitch. You have no idea how much it turns me on to see you like this.. No control."
Hermione's eyes watered a bit and she shook her head vividly.
The blond stared at the Gryffindor without flinching during his whole speech. Frozen and surprised by his loss of control, wide-eyed. Harry was excepting to see him smile but the Slytherin showed no satisfaction. On the contrary, he seemed uncomfortable and Harry could see him swallows with difficulty, as if he was trying to swallow the words he just took straight in his face with ferocity.
He didn't even shout, his tone was low but filled with a vile satisfaction. Profoundly cruel. Malfoy looked proud and pleased has Harry felt his body being lacerated. Blood flowing profusely from each cuts. His vision became blurry in only a few seconds, he could feel the life being poured out of him as he weakened. Dropping on his knees.
The Gryffindor asked and it made Malfoy turn away from the window to look at him. Grey eyes full of hurt and disappointment.
However, has Harry desperately yelled and still tried to catch her, like lightning she had vanished. Dust that flew in a wind the boy couldn't even feel. Dispersing into the air. Leaving nothing but an empty chair and a shaking son, tears filling his eyes. But he had no time to collapse, his dad was still there, and he rushed to his side. But this time, he was careful not to touch him.
He sounded sure of himself, of the idea that they could somehow match together. Willing to built something with his old enemy, their now broken soul as a base for something new. Harry brought his gaze back to him. He had not a single trace of pride left on his face and it was really astonishing. He couldn't get used to it, seeing Malfoy bare of the cold mask he had always wore before, kept even when he had found him crying in the toilets during the sixth year. Now he was offering himself completely, plain honest with desperate and begging eyes. It was so troubling Harry still had a hard time believing it was true. He could trust that Malfoy was never really evil, never wanted the life that was forced on him. But him looking for what seemed to be friendship ? It was just too weird.
Is my writing okay ? Do I make sense or is my english fucked up ? Please tell me :')
Malfoy questioned again and Harry let out a heavy sigh. Not so annoyed by his insistence, but rather by his inability to answer without losing his dignity. He didn't want to admit that he freaked out so much he ran away and ended up crying like a weak and fragile thing, curled up on the castle's cold floor.
He stammered as an excuse, but she was not fooled. He had always been so bad a lying and she knew him too well. She rolled her eyes but didn't scolded him.
The Weasleys were all there too. Standing in a row in front of him, their feet resting on nothing concrete. Between him and them, Ron was sitting in the void, leaning on his brother's body. He was holding Fred on his leg, hugging his corpse as he cried. Then his gaze came up to meet Harry's as he got back up on his feet, and the redhead face twisted in anger at his sight. Eyes full of rage and despise. Harry couldn't breath anymore. He was shaking again. Shaking his head in denial. Guilt burning him inside.
Harry shouted, powerless. Dropping on his knees, sobbing like a baby once more. He screamed until he could feel his lungs burn. The burning from the memory he was reminded of. How his stupidity killed the last of his family. Because yes, he had been naive. And it was all his fault, and his fault only. The price of failure, of thinking wrongly he knew better than all of them. Because he was the chosen one, the one they had to follow. Follow to their death...
: 26.08.2019
Let me know what you think of it :)
Coughing salty water, he was weak on his arms as he tried to push his body from the ground. Shaking and dripping wet. He had to catch his breath before he could look around.
Frowning, he carefully questioned, suspicious of what a Lovegood family secret might be, and she laughed a bit.
He muttered in disbelief. How could Harry not understand ? He had just wanted to help him, seeing how distressed he looked in his sleep. He could have just left him there, sleeping on the sofa, struggling with his nightmare. But he had fucking chose to help him get out of it, and all he got for it was that aggressive reaction from the raven-haired boy. The sudden suspicion, for no valid reasons.
He whispered like he was on delay. Like he hadn't heard the last of what Harry had said. But finally remembering his godson. Stretching a hand trough the bars, he softly stroked a dirty hand on the boy's cheek. And Harry pushed his face in the touch a bit more. Feeling tears escaping his eyes again. The palm was cold and smelly, but he couldn't care less. His godfather was here again, he could feel him and it's all he wanted. Putting his hand on his, he pressed.
Dropping his quill, he decided to try and focus on the class. But he was so lost in the lesson, not having listened to a single word of it, that he quickly gave up. Back to staring his page still blank. Knowing, it was going to be a long toilsome year...
Faithful to his new habits, he was once again lost in the retrospective of his past. Focused on a precise moment. He was seeing Cedric's body again, and his own while he was restrained to the statue. The blood on his arm, the one that allowed Voldemort to come back to life. How could he not feel guilty when it was his own blood that brought back the greatest terror of the magical world ?
They both stayed silent after that. Staring gently and amused at each other for a long time, until it was too much and became uncomfortable to the point where Harry could feel himself blush a bit. And he could see Malfoy's pale cheeks turn a soft pink too. But it was just a blush out of awkwardness, nothing more, for sure. They had been staring for so long it was turning into a strange analyse of one another, that's all it was.
She said, not even looking back, before turning the corner of the hallway, leaving him alone once more.
Making him rise his eyes towards him after what must have been an hour of silence. Malfoy met his gaze and Harry was once again startled by the lack of animosity in his eyes. Like this, he almost seemed likable. Stunned to notice he was finding in them more comprehension than in his, now former, best friend's.
And finally, his godfather got up. Weakly, holding himself to the wall. Under his shaggy prison clothes, all Harry could see was a bag of bones. He dragged himself to the bars. Seeing him in such a state was devastating.
The blond stated before nodding to say goodbye, leaving the room in a hurry, as if he was suddenly embarrassed.
Cedric's growling voice reached Harry as he was walking closer. Now able to see his face, lit by the glowing cup. His skin seemed blue from the light. His eyes were locked on it.
The blond whispered obediently, pushing himself away from the railing to go sit on one of the two curved steps inside. Rummaging into his bag to pick up a book, keeping quiet, he simply started to read while Harry stayed a bit longer leaning on the railing. His cigarette all smoked up, he made it vanish. Watching the tip consumed into thin air, turning into ashes that got captured by the strong wind. He followed them, hypnotized, until he couldn't see them anymore in the darkness. They flew away and all that was left was the smell tainting his hoodie.
Harry growled. And to that, the blond started to laugh. The raven haired boy could only open his eyes wide in surprise to his reaction. And to the sound of his laughter, a sound he had never heard before. It was a soft and joyful giggle, and he couldn't help but think that even his fucking laugh was elegant. The way he was politely but unnecessarily hiding his smiling mouth with a hand, a revealing of how rigid his education must have been. He was the incarnation of high class. His back always so straight, his chin kept high and his clothes neat. His black turtleneck making his neck looked even thinner and graceful.
Harry said in a low voice once he was alone, looking at the last flames, small and dying in the fireplace. He also felt kind of embarrassed, now that he thought of that long gaze... And how soothing it was. How, for the first time, he didn't dislike having company. Confused to see how easy it seemed to talk to Malfoy... Much more easier than to anyone else lately. Things had changed for sure...
(Also, if someone is interested in becoming my beta... I wouldn't say no :') )
He said anyway before disappearing in the staircase. Harry didn't answer. He stayed for a while longer in the sofa, chewing the inside of his cheeks nervously. Body aching from being so tensed. But, eventually, he extinguished the last fo the fire in the fireplace and went up to the Gryffindor's room. Walking blindly in the room filled with snores before crashing in his bed.
Hermione shouted, startling the boy who then raised his head only to find his two friends already rushing towards him. The girl jumped to his neck, embracing him strongly.
Malfoy started with a provoking tone, but his voice dropped in an obvious struggle as he kept talking. Filled with pain and rage. Rage against himself. The self blame making him break a little. He tried to keep composure, started gesturing and fidgeting as it was clear he wanted to scream but was too afraid it would only end up making him cry. Pointing an accusing finger towards himself. Harry could see he was shaking too.
He choked out with sarcasm.
He growled with a tight jaw. But under the rage there was a plea. And Harry scoffed coldly at it, brain clouded by fury.
On the cold floor, he curled up into a small ball, body jerking from all the tears. His fist clenched.
But the ladder didn't reach back. He kept looking, with a wicked smile now forming on his lips. Behind his shoulder came Lucius. He whispered in his son's ear but oddly Harry could hear.
Slowly sitting in his bed, his hand wandered on his nightstand to find his wand in the dark. Casting a silent tempus spell, he discovered it was only 5 a.m. He could still sleep for at least two or three hours, but he felt too awake now to even try. Or actually, maybe he was just too scared to be plunged in the nightmare once more. Getting out of the covers, he got up and chose to leave the room, guiding himself to the door with a soft lumos at the end of his wand. Careful not to wake anyone, too scared that he would have to face them. Be seen, and have to talk.
An unpleasant shiver ran down his spine when he heard the blond sneer at his vehemence. His jaw clenched as he watched him rise to his feet to turn to him again. Against his wand, Harry felt his fingers tighten, he even started to slowly pull it out of his pocket when the Slytherin was bold enough to approach.
They briefly shook hands before letting go. Staring at each other, finally in an understanding.
Without a word, Harry followed him and also went to sit, in the opposite sofa. Facing the blond, eyes never letting go of him, still wary. The silence became heavy but, in it, the angry tension weirdly eased. Malfoy could feel the Gryffindor getting more calm even though he was still a bit agitated, fingers strumming on the armrest. But he seemed more willing to listen, his wand no longer in his hand but resting on his lap. And the blond hoped that he was now more open to reason.
Sirius smiled with blackened teeth and giggled. Like this he looked properly crazy. Removing his hand from Harry, he stepped back.
He asked in a low voice. He felt sleepy but knew he still probably wouldn’t get any sleep anyway. He actually just wanted to be alone. Pretend with his eyes closed so nobody would bother him.
He bragged a bit. It was nice to be the one in that position for once, like a little harmless payback for all the times Malfoy had bragged about all the nice things his father had bought him or his quidditch team.
He whispered with compassion, then taking his hand in his, he gently squeezed it. Harry allowed the touch this time. Because he desperately needed it. He turned his attention to his best friend, saw that his gaze had become almost as broken as his. He too suffered at the sight of the memorial. After all, his brother's name was on it. Lost somewhere in the sea of fallen. And for a moment, Harry felt less lonely in the battle with his demons. He let his forehead fall upon the shoulder of the redhead who then gently patted on his back.
He hesitated a few seconds on turning back to simply avoid the annoying presence of the blond and his unsettling examination. Yet, strangely, his feet did not move and he even ended up opening his mouth to answer.
Harry took the box and looked at it. It was obviously a muggle box made for lunch. He remembered that Dudley had one as a kid, a beautiful one with some superheroes characters from a cartoon on it. He got to take it to school every day. Harry was so jealous of him back then. Obviously he himself didn't have one...And he liked the cartoon that was represented on the box. He could sometimes watch it if he was hiding well enough. From afar, popping his head a bit trough the hallway door... It was small and blurry from there, but it was enough for him to escape reality just a bit.
had a troubling echo in the blond's voice. For sure, it was better than insults, but still.
When he came back to the kitchen, his hair still wet dripping on his fresh clothes, Hermione had finished making tea. He found beside his mug a plate filled with two toasts spread with jam. He looked at the breakfast prepared for him without much conviction. He didn't remember his last meal, yet he didn't feel hungry at all. The girl had already resumed to her studies, her nose in her book, a quill scratching a sheet of paper next to it. Her eyes swiftly moved to Harry, then to the plate.
Walking towards the castle, his eyes turned to the ground and, lost in his thoughts, he didn't even see his best friends at the door. Even though they were having a loud and animated conversation.
Crawling under the bed sheets with his clothes still on, he felt like the weakest thing on earth.
He knew he shouldn't, but he wrote draco a letter anyways, too deeply hurt and betrayed to feel bad about breaking his promise. Draco had broken his as well, right? With a frustrated grunt, he tied it to the owls leg and sent it off, not that it made him feel any better. He layed awake at night cuddling a pensieve, living through every single moment in that market again, hoping against hope that he would be given some clue as to why Draco was treating him so horribly. Only one answer came to mind as he left for work the next day, the same three words Draco had written him every month for the past two years:
" I won't say a word." she assured him, then grabbed a chair and sat next to him, looking him in the eye.
"You'll have your wand on you at all times, yeah?" the blonde suddenly asked, quietly.
"Yes, notebook."
He finally discovered draco in the living room, sitting in an all-too-familiar position.
"I-I U-Under-stand" he stuttered out, then gets up to leave. Only then dod Harry cast locking and silencing charms all over the house.
The ghost looked at the blonde as if he had just slapped her, which only angered him further.
"but could you promise me not to believe a word Jashua says about me? The guy doesn't even know me and I am certain he is filling your head with all kinds of lies."
"You really want me to eat this, don't you?"
Harry didn't think before acting quickly, tightening his hold on the blonde, then slamming him on the nearest wall to keep him upright so he can be fed. Draco was disappearing and dying right in front of Harry. Harry had to do something about it right now or Draco might slip into another coma and never wake up this time.
The blonde narrowed his eyes at Harry then asked in a quivering voice "W-what tournament?"
He snorted and Harry had to fight the urge to punch him. Nothing about this was funny...
" Harry, are you alright?"
When kreacher showed up with two plates, Draco shot an accusing look at Harry, who beamed at the first emotion Draco had displayed that day that wasnt entirely negative.
Enjoy!
Draco shakingly nodded without removing his hands and let out a trembling sigh.
"Do you think I'm crazy?" he whispered.
Lucius took one casual look at Draco, then, seemingly unaffected, approached Pomfrey.
The blonde felt at a twinge at the insinuation that he wasn't important enough for his mate to tell him that he'd leave him early. But that didn't really matter. He was more worried about where his mate was and whether he was alright.
Harry was at loss as to what to say. So, he waits for Draco to speak, the ticking on the black family clock very loud in his ears, reminding him that every second that passes is another one in which Draco is in pain and he is not helping.
"any chance you could do it without knowing?" he asked quietly.
"Yes, myrtle! Now leave." he continued to shout.
Harry awakened from his dream to find that draco wasn't beside him. He ran out of the room, frantically searching everywhere and hoping that draco hadn't left. Of course, he remembered that he had wards and that he locked the doors and windows and that draco wasn't stupid enough to wander into the Wizarding world alone. But, none of the logic was welcomed into his mind as he fed off the panic that the spell radiated onto him for hours the day before.
"P-please?" he wailed, "I-I have no one else. Maybe I don't des-deserve anyone else, but I-it's done N-nothing wrong. It's not its fault I am s-so broken. Please. I b-beg of you. H-help me, harry."
"Um...Draco?" Harry asked after a few minutes of trying and failing to get Draco hard again.
"H-harry?" the blonde asked when he saw Harry give no sign of having heard the request. "Are-are you alright? Are you hurt?"
Once again, harry saw red in face of the clear rejection coming from Draco.
“I should be the one thanking
He found Draco in the sitting room observing the vial that had had the abortion potion. A sickening thought went through Harry's mind.
" I wasn't lying." the blonde murmured and Harry exploded.
Draco didn’t expect everything to happen so soon. He didn’t think Hermione would owl him a muggle ID the very next day, saying he could use her muggle address since her house was not under a charm and was vacant. Harry had been just as nervous as him, but he hid it behind a slight smile and encouraging statements. Draco left the house chanting the same seven words in his head to calm himself down.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It came off as a lame question, but draco seemed satisfied. The thoughts didn't stop there, however.
“Do you mind if we stay for a bit longer so you could finish eating? I am sure Robards won’t mind,” he asked softly.
Harry decided he couldn't hold back anymore. There would be no more fake smiles and light conversations. This was truth time. He spoke from the heart.
"Why did you say you weren't hungry when you clearly are?" he asks slowly.
"Fine. I won't call it that. But you say you've taken a life. Let me ask you, Draco, what kind of life have you taken? Cause I saw what living with your father did to you and let me tell you, there were times when I thought you'd be better off dead than have to endure one more second of that kind of horrible life!" Harry yelled. His eyes widened upon realizing what he had just said and he started fighting against the potion to take it back, but Draco interrupted him.
He had meant it to be hurtful, to push Harry away, but all he felt from Harry was a sudden sense of understanding.
“You tolerating my presence shouldn’t be described as us getting closer!” the blonde gritted out, though he knew that’s not what Harry meant. He and the brunette had been having many moments, but the blonde would rather pretend they didn’t just to avoid any unnecessary stress from their already painful situation.
"No!" Draco screamed, shaking his head, tears falling down his cheeks, "Please don't do this, Harry. I told you I would eat and I did! I wasn't lying to you. I want to get better, but not th-there not with anyone forcing me to. I'll get better on my own. Please-"
Draco knows it was a mistake the moment a dark shadow crossed Harry's eyes. He instantly kicked himself mentally for thinking he could get away that easily. No. Harry needed to make sure that Draco was saved and fine. Well.. He can pretend for two more days if that's what it takes to get Harry to leave him alone.
With that, the red-head, soon-to-be Harry’s brother-in-law, came forward and adjusted Harry’s tie using a spell, then winked at the brunette and told him to hurry. Harry sighed, forced another smile, and made his way down the stairs, ignoring the increasing feeling of tightness around his heart. That was normal, right? Everything would be alright. He could freak out all he wanted later. He didn’t have time now. Everyone was waiting for him. Ginny was waiting for him. His new family was waiting for him. He couldn’t lose his nerve. He couldn’t do anything wrong today.
"It wasn't about pity or a sense of saving people?"
Harry smiled widely, thinking Draco had read his loving letters and was about to break up with that arse Jashua, who kept them from Draco. But when Draco looked up, he had tears in his eyes.
"Y-you sounded so alone, all the time, wanting me to come home."
Both Harry and Pomfrey stood completely still, narrowing their eyes at Lucius, astonished by his cold tone and insult.
Draco walked over to the bed and towered over Harry, finding that he didn't have the words to express himself for the first time in forever. Harry started to chuckle through tears.
"Fine." he sighed, "meet me outside this store at 2 am. Now please leave."
He often stayed up thinking about it, about what could've happened to Draco. But, he would never know. His owls were never delivered for the first few weeks. The first returned had his heart leaping in his chest. It only held three words that he would keep seeing after every subsequent letter: 'leave me alone'. Any further attempt he made to find Draco was in vain, until today.
"I thought you would never abandon me, Draco. It hurts a little more everytime. I thought what we had meant everything to you." Harry murmured loud enough for Draco to hear. He wasn't manipulating Draco, though. Right? This was the closest thing to the truth that Harry had shared with Draco since finding the blonde the first time.
She took a deep breath, then continued.
"I don't know!" Draco yelled back, then the entire room suddenly went silent with the implication of his words.
"No!" he screamed, tears filling his eyes as he rushed towards the letter, grabbed it carefully, then held it out to Harry. "Why would you do that, Harry?! Please, fix it! Please!"
"Well, I am quite alright as you can see. So, leave now!" younger draco shouted.
Draco attempted and failed to hide a blush and faint smile, then looked about ready to agree when his eyes suddenly filled with sadness and he gave that damned smile again.
"I don't want to talk about this anymore." the blonde whispered and Harry understood.
By the end of the week, Draco was cursing his failing magic for the millionth time. Had he been able to cast a simple charm on the book to prevent others from finding or reading it, this wouldn't have happened to him.
"You… you're laughing at me." he said in a small voice, then shrank back within himself. "You-you know how terrified I am over losing you and you're still laughing about it."
He sprinted up the stairs and was panting by the time he was in front of the room. Harry had the door closed. The brunette lifted his head from his arms the moment Draco walked in, then smiled tearfully at him. He had his knees against his chest and his head resting on the arms wrapped around his legs. He looked so small, so sad, so unbelieving of what he was seeing. Draco felt a momentary pang of guilt for doing this to his perfect Harry but willed it away. Harry had told him it was fine. Harry had extended the last branch. The past was past and they were together again. It would be fine. In this moment, everything would be fine.
The bitterness in Ron's voice at the last three words told Harry he was crossing some sort of line into rage territory. He faked a laugh to fill in the awkward silence, then murmured "right. Was just wondering" and went back to the notebook. The next page was tear-stained and Harry's suspicions were immediately confirmed.
"It's alright. I like it when you're honest. I thought Jashua was honest for so long... It doesn't make sense."
"But, Harry, no matter the reason, it is very rare for patients to come out of this type of coma-"
Draco nodded slowly, then got off the bed and started heading towards the door.
When the blonde came back, Harry threw on a wide smile and shoved the jar towards him. Draco pulled out a random paper.
I would like to thank nightskywithrainbows (or JJ) for their amazing work and help beta(ing) this chapter and the ones after that. You really motivate me to write better and more. Thank you so much!
The world was opening up to him. And it was all because of that beautiful, green-eyed man who had saved Draco from everything. He could still be a father. He could still bake and read and go out to eat and enjoy it. His life was no longer over. His dreams weren't dead anymore. Harry did all that. It was all him. Suddenly, Draco felt a kind of overwhelming, intense love for Harry, the kind he hadn't felt in such a long time.
With a deep breathe, Draco started arranging his things. He supposed he had too many of everything. He didn't need so much. Why does mother keep insisting on sending him all of this? It just makes the other students feel bad and hate Draco. Draco would've given anything to be liked by any of them, especially that green-eyed git.
Draco watched in horror as a bout of accidental magic from the clearly distressed Harry Potter shattered the entire box of potions, along with the two potions on the counter, sending most of their content onto Potter and the remaining onto him.
"Hey! I can read."
Harry tried his best to look interested in some books in front of him, glancing at Draco through the corner of his eye. The blonde didn't beam at the books and start demanding that the employees educate themselves better on proper literature. Neither did he even glance at the classics section, which Harry knew was Draco's favorite. Instead, he started to rearrange the books that were out of place and crossed his arms on front of his chest as he looked at the shelves and deemed them fixed, then he turned and sat on the reading couch in the middle of the room, waiting, presumably, for Harry.
That was all Draco remembered before he passed out, sure that Jashua would feed him the potion anyways, but determined to fight until the end nonetheless, even if it was useless. But, of course, Jashua wouldn't leave it at that. He cast a spell to keep Draco awake through the whole ordeal. The blonde tried to fight, but it was clear Jashua had fed him more than the fertility potion when he passed out. He couldn't move a single inch and had to lay there, crying and taking everything Jashua forced upon him until the larger man was done. Jashua spat on Draco's face, then left without another word.
Harry immediately gasped as he was assaulted with what seemed like thousands of horrible thoughts and feelings all at once. Some from letters, some Draco's own, some in a voice he did not recognize. But they were all hateful, further destroyed and burying his draco. He felt cold and depressed and tired and restless and panicked and mortified and a thousand more, yet he could make out the thoughts as clear as day, though they didn't make him feel any better.
Harry starts pulling at his hair once again, a tactic he adopted after starting his relationship with Draco during third year. The blonde git sure could be frustrating at times, but he was never this broken and bloody confusing! Harry has no idea what to do or say, so he goes with his gut, hoping Draco gives him any kind of answer to the questions running through his head. He starts with the most obvious.
He hadn't even thought anything all the way through. He only remembered finding the fertility potion that Jashua had slipped into the blonde's drink before he took him that day harry ran into them, then taking a muggle pregnancy test, which work for males as well, and freaking one. He only knew that he had to get rid of it, but he didn't think about the process and the promise he made to Harry in return for the potion.
No fear.
There. He hadn't lied exactly and had achieved his desired effects. Draco beamed at the dog and had that look on his face that he used to have whenever coming across one of Hagrid's creatures. Though he used to deny it, Harry knew Draco loved any and all creatures that weren't human and Harry couldn't say he blamed him. Harry, himself, wasn't a big fan of humans, muggle or magical, at the moment.
"Could I, at least, throw that away?" he asked, already reaching out to take the empty vial from Draco.
The potion he chose is supposed to kill the feotus and remove it entirely from his body without any blood, so Harry shouldn't have had any reason to be this worried. Through it all, Draco remains in the sitting room, kneeling on the couch with an arm around his stomach and the other covering his eyes.
Draco looked panicked and Harry's heart sank as he realized the blonde was onto him already.
"I won't buy you anything! Never. I won't do anything you don't want to do. And I definitely won't come on to you. It's your life, Draco. You should have full control of it."
Harry pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes as he felt tears threatening to escape. He knew Ron meant well, but he just
That's how Harry justified the second decision he wasn't really proud of. That's when he cast another wordless, wandless spell at his broken ex-lover, allowing Harry to hear his thoughts and feel his emotions, because he simply couldn't read his Draco anymore. His draco had been destroyed.
"Draco?" he whispered into the blonde's shoulder, who suddenly jerked and pulled Harry away to look at his face, then pulled him in for a kiss, that had Harry gasping. Draco stopped then pulled Harry to his chest again.
“That sounds great! Tell me everything,” the brunette said, smiling widely. Hermione sighed.
"was it just me or did I see Harry Potter walking out of the store just now?" he asked quietly. Draco didn't know whether he was looking at him. He still faced the wall, trying to avoid any eye contact. Perhaps if he kept doing that, the entire day would go away.
He turned to leave without answering Harry's question about meeting again. Harry started running behind him, catching upto the blonde easily and looking him in the eye.
“Mate, is everything alright?” Harry heard Ron ask from the doorway. He turned around and plastered a wide smile on, hoping that his eyes didn’t give away how panicked he was at the moment.
"...Unfortunate..."
" His father doesn't necessarily approve of our friendship-" he started, trailing off.
Draco shook his head, suddenly angry at the brunette.
There it was. His confession. Harry pitied draco. Harry never loved him. Harry had spent all this time with him out of discomfort at the thought of telling him he wanted to break up. Harry was humiliated by him.
The blonde gave the red-head a grateful look, then instantly raced to Harry’s side once Ron left the room.
"what if he doesn't mean it?" he had once asked after receiving yet another of harry's fateful letters. "he really did love me in school. Would you let me arrange to meet him? With you there, of course."
"Alright. I'll keep it out here. At least you know it's not a fake wand now." he told the blonde softly. "As for the potion, can I give it to you? You'd recognize the smell anywhere. you were brilliant at potions."
Harry’s thoughts came to a stop there. Why couldn’t he remember what had happened that day? He was in the apothecary and he purchased some potions, but then he somehow left without them and woke up the next day in Grimmauld place, not remembering how he got there. Had Malfoy obliviated him?! That bastard! What the hell had he done to Harry?
He couldn't tell Harry anything. Not about where he had been or what he was planning. It would devastate his Harry and the brunette deserved better than to spend his life trying to make Draco happy.
"Even my immortal friend can't be bothered to waste her time of my nonsense."
It was a terrifying and evil thought, one he thought he would never have, but there it was. It's not like he wanted Draco to die, but him suffering like this...death is a more peaceful solution. And suddenly Harry understood why draco walked away after the trial, why he walked away after the bathroom incident. He felt Harry wouldn't understand and he was one hundred percent right.
"M'so dizzy" the blonde murmured and Harry had to put extra effort into holding him up. "hurts, Harry. Hurts..."
Harry started to cry. He didn't even know it was happening until he started to gasp for breaths and draco's arms were around his shoulder pulling him towards his own bedroom. He faintly heard some distant clapping noises and he was confused at first until he realized they were coming from inside draco's mind.
“What happened?” he choked out, still looking at the brunette, whose face was covered in cuts. Hermione came up behind him and explained, somehow calm about everything that was going on.
Harry sighed, leaned against the wall, then sunk down to the ground and pulled his knees up to his chest. At that time, he felt a pang at the back of his head, telling him Draco had been hurt, but not badly hurt, not enough to die. As much as he wanted to, he couldn't stomp over and take the blonde back. He was again without hope and didn't have any sense of direction in regards to what to do.
Draco quickly shook his head.
"I am sure I don't know what you mean." he said calmly, then tried again to leave the aisle, only to be held back by harry's hand tightening around his arm. He winced, but covered it with a cough. Harry didn't miss a thing.
"I missed you so much." Harry breathed out without thinking it through. Draco blushed furiously and Harry had to stomp down that same jittery feeling in his chest that he got whenever he thought of Draco. He got up to hug Draco but the blonde moved away, looking all red and furious, yet somehow small, as a child would before they stomp their feet.
"W-will you promise to s-stay here for three days after? And not h-harm yourself? I-if we get the potion?"
"Would you like some tea, Harry?"
Dont own any of the characters. Rowling does. Enjoy!
"Dig in. Everything looks amazing." Harry said when the waitress brought over their meals, licking his lips. Draco stared at the plate. He had been eating out of dumpsters for weeks and the plate contained more than he had eaten in the past four days. He closed his eyes against the intoxicating smell, willing his stomach not to growl in hunger. He repeated Jashua's words in his head.
"So, you never sent back replies to my letters asking me to leave you alone over and over until I stopped sending you any??"
The blonde whimpered and held himself tighter, his eyes closed. After two minutes of Harry standing there in agony, unable to say or do anything to help the situation, Draco finally nodded and Harry immediately cast the finite, sighing in relief when the blood started circulating once more through his Draco's body. Harry would have to convince Draco to report Jashua. He had to!
"draco..."
"My notebook!" he told her loudly then saw her smile at him.
" yes."
"Did you see my father, Harry? Oh it was wonderful! He was so proud of me. He left me a letter in the hospital wing-" Draco stopped, letter in hand, the other hand gesturing towards it. He had finally noticed how pissed Harry was.
"Even when I am like this?" he gestured to himself. Harry couldn't help but smile as draco's insecurity FINALLY made him resemble his Draco.
"I assure you, potter. This is only a one time thing. I had a bad day. It won't happen again."
Harry's eyes flashed with something. Was it determination? Anger? More hurt? Draco can't tell.
He looked away, eyes wet, and whispered "You're pitying me."
Harry knew he couldn't say any of that and he knew if Draco does do anything to himself, Harry could heal him within seconds. He needed to prove to the blonde that he was himself. He summoned his wand and a vial of vertiserum. Draco and him hadn't used the potion in three weeks and he was beginning to think Draco was starting to trust him fully. Trust Jashua to ruin everything!
"I am not lying!"
“I-It’s not that simple, Ron.” the brunette choked, trying to push away the painful memories of his childhood with those whales, “We’ll t-tell them that the money wasn’t to pay for my school, for example, but then they’ll ask where I went so they could prove it wasn’t there and - and I can’t just say ‘Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry’, can I?”
"No need to apologize. It's me, remember?"
Draco smiles in return. Not his sad smile, but a wide, genuine smile. He looks away for a moment and Harry fears that he might take off or worse, but then he looks back at Harry with a curious expression.
“Weasley, I know you’re with Potter, but the wards of St. Mungo’s just detected that someone with the dark mark has entered. I need you to investigate and bring that person in, whoever it is.”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Draco stared at him like he was crazy for a split-second, then blinked and leaned close to Harry, who sat on the table in front of the couch.
"Draco?" Harry asked slowly. Draco didn't  look up. "Are you an addict?"
Draco cleared his throat, then maneuvered backwards until his back rested against the tub, and his knees were up against his chest with his arms curling around himself.
Harry's thoughts are in bold italics and Draco's are in italics. If they suddenly follow each other and seem to relate, then the two are having a conversation through their mind link.
"if you don't want me to touch you, I could get a professional.."
No vengefullness.
Harry swiftly left the wing and raced to his room, where a box of cookies was already sitting on his bed.
"Alright, how about this?" Harry asked, conjuring a vial of vertiserum and downing it without thinking it through. He could fight the effects anyways but he hoped he wouldn't need to. "Ask me anything."
“Finally,” Draco hummed, already half-asleep as Harry pulled the four-poster’s curtains shut. His hair glowed silver pure white in a lone shaft of moonlight. Harry smiled at the sight.
that had him twitching with excitement all week.
The common room door slammed shut behind Harry, and a confused Ron turned to his smiling girlfriend. “What was that all about?” he asked.
“Not really, no,” Harry replied, dunking a biscuit in his tea. “I usually do it by myself. It’s rather nice to have company, I think.” Malfoy didn’t respond, but his cheeks pinked pleasantly.
They followed the signs to a market, and Harry was captivated. People from all over the world were casually strolling around, past racks of vintage clothing and cheap tchotkes. Piles of loose spices, a woman selling fresh crepes, intricate little gadgets, handmade muslin and linen billowing in the breeze. Even with all the wonders he’d seen in the wizarding world, Harry had never been to such a market. They ordered mugs of deep, rich chocolate and sat people-watching near the canal’s tired Christmas decorations. When it was too cold to shop anymore, they cut briskly through a park to get to the Victoria & Albert Museum. Unsurprisingly, there Draco was in his element. Harry loved the stained glass exhibit and could have stayed there for hours, just taking in the play of light and color. Draco was obscenely delighted or scandalized by every single object on display. Harry had to talk him out of absconding with a seventeenth century frog-shaped purse for Pansy Parkinson, finally reminding him that “look, she’d never appreciate it as much as the museum would. You’ve told me how she treats her shoes.”
“Indeed. I refuse to be seen with anyone else, of course,” Draco drawled.
Harry was immediately distracted by Ron keeling over and babbling incomprehensibly, right on the floor of the Great Hall. Neville at least had the presence of mind to take Ron to the hospital wing, while Seamus and Dean only hugged each other to keep from falling over and laughed until they cried.
Voldemort to death, you know.”
“I believe you have a visitor, my dear. I do not recognize that owl.”
Draco spared a moment for himself to cry or scream or whatever he needed to do. It was disgusting to be so effusive, but he refused to embarrass himself in front of Mother or, Salazar forbid, the
Harry shook his head, starting down Diagon Alley again with renewed pep in his step. “Merlin, I must be mad," he muttered. "A date it is, then. But I’m definitely not trying one of those fried spideys
There it was. What a prickly, sexy bastard. It was just like Draco to coax Harry into submission, to think he was about to be buttered up, and then to sting him with a barb about his ego. This would probably have infuriated Harry at any other time, but he was far too aroused to make room for any other emotion.
. It means soul. Harry, I think he thinks you’re his soulmate.”
“What is it? Did Malfoy do something after all? We’re not supposed to fight but I’ll--I’ll jinx his hair pink! Bastard…” Ron looked a bit odd trying to threaten someone with fluffy yellow wool wound around his hands, but Harry appreciated the sentiment.
good? But Harry had seen sparks fly from Malfoy’s mouth. Maybe it was a potion or a new Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes product? Harry filed that thought away to ask Hermione about; he knew he wouldn’t be able to figure that out on his own. He grimaced; she’d been right about needing the restricted section after all.
It really was a gorgeous day, probably one of the last they’d have before winter tightened its grip on Scotland. A slight breeze ruffled the surface of the water, and the Whomping Willow cast its branches about far more gently than usual. Strange creatures called out from the Forbidden Forest, and the Hufflepuff team was practicing on the Quidditch pitch. It was exactly what Harry had imagined when he’d wished for a normal school year, but he never would’ve guessed that the friend by his side would be Draco Malfoy.
--” Draco began, but he saw the warning look on Harry’s face and wisely composed himself. “Very well. I demand a kiss, though.”
Malfoy wilted for a moment before he collected himself, sneering at Harry with even more vigor than before. “Potter, do you really not believe me? Do you really believe I would sink all this capital, all this time and effort, into any business enterprise for a prank?”
“Thank you, Headmistress,” Malfoy said, an odd smirk curving about his mouth. His body was still bent over Harry’s, until Harry straightened and almost knocked Malfoy right in his pointy nose.
Harry watched in silence for a moment as Draco fussed with the feast spread out on the most opulent rug. His deft fingers fidgeted with the sandwiches, arranging trays of lusciously ripe fruit just so, until he heard Harry’s trainers scrape against the flagstones. “Harry! Come in,
“Oh,” Harry managed. An hesitant stroke made Draco shudder with delight. Merlin, he was sensitive. Harry added a twist at the end of the next one, and the man beside him thrust up, begging for more.
“Finished,” Malfoy announced with a smarmy smirk. “You look like a princess, Potter. Very pretty.”
“Very well, Mr. Malfoy.” She turned to the ancient phonograph beside her and placed the needle on the record. The song, something vaguely mournful with lots of violins, crackled to life. “Please begin whenever you’re ready.”
“Er, thanks, Malfoy,” Harry said, nudging Ron out of the way. “You’re probably right. See you in class.” Malfoy bowed briefly before striding back to the Slytherin table and a gawking Goyle.
A surprisingly bouncy beat came from the speakers as Harry stood onstage, fiddling with the microphone stand to get it to the right height. He finally gave up, wresting the mike from the stand. His foot tapped awkwardly and he stared at the back wall as the song began.
. If it is truly so insignificant, it can only take a moment,” Narcissa replied before taking a small bite of her finger sandwich.
it read in flowing copperplate script.
“Spideys? It’s, um...our specialty is deep-fried spiders.”
. You look well; rather more like yourself again. What has changed?” Narcissa asked quietly.
Ron scoffed. “What, that they’re poncy French gits? We already know that, ‘Mione. Bloody Malfoy won’t stop rubbing it in everyone’s faces, thinks he’s better than we are…” He trailed off, muttering darkly under his breath.
Malfoy’s face was still unusually solemn, but his mouth quirked in amusement. “I assure you that it’s not cursed or jinxed in any way. Please read it carefully. I would stay, but I ought to take my leave before I am chased off--that one looks rather hostile.”
“It does sound dumb,” Malfoy smirked. “But I’m afraid you’re correct.”
The smile Harry received was totally without guile or pretense. It was not at all Malfoy, but something entirely Draco. Almost like the carefree man in Harry’s dream. Despite the reservations that still tugged at his mind, Harry's heart felt distinctly gooey.
Knowing that group, they definitely would lie, especially if they thought it funny. “Unless they were taking the mick out of you,” Harry muttered under his breath.
Utter panic consumed Harry. He was supposed to be a Gryffindor, for Merlin’s sake. He had no idea where all his bravery had gone, but when he thought about speaking to Malfoy, it all crept away again.
The dinosaurs were impressive, but after following Draco around museums all morning, Harry was almost relieved to return to Diagon Alley and enter Twilfitt and Tattings. Draco had been bemoaning Harry’s wardrobe for so long and with such gusto that he went through the door and rifled through the racks like a flash.
Surprisingly, Malfoy kept his word and his distance from Harry for a solid week. They partnered in Potions again and greeted each other in the hallway, but there were no seeker’s games of Quidditch or long, flirty study sessions, or sneaking down to the kitchen under Harry’s invisibility cloak. (Eighth years had no curfew, but the air of secrecy made it more exciting.)
“Only heathens wear polyblends, Harry.”
Harry lingered in the darkened forest clearing, taking in great gusts of the night air and listening to the faraway sounds of the party. It felt good to be alone for once.
Dangerous silver markings flared around Draco’s eyes. “I see where your priorities lie. Well, if
Harry rolled his eyes good-naturedly, trying not to laugh at the vengeful look on Malfoy’s face as he considered destroying the karaoke machine. “‘M fine, thanks Malfoy.”
“Well, guess you do now. She’s right over there, but she figured you were worked up enough you wouldn’t want to be interrupted. Don’t think you realize how loudly you were yelling through the Floo, mate. She heard you from the other end of the house.” Ron jerked his head toward the bar and Harry turned to see the brunette leaning elegantly against it. Her features had softened in the years since Hogwarts, but Pansy Parkinson still had an aura of ruthless beauty, clad as she was in a chic black dress and lacy tights. And she was with Draco Malfoy, of course. His eyes scanned the room, but he occasionally stopped to share scathing comments about the crowd with Pansy. Ugh, had the man’s legs always been so bloody
“I’ve never been to this kind of art museum before, you know,” Potter said as they strolled into the next room. This one was round, and filled with bits of metallic fabric hanging from the ceiling in concentric circles. The walls and ceiling were painted a deep blue, so dark it was almost black, and the lights were kept low, barely reflecting off the blue tiled floor.
Draco’s brow creased in confusion. “You are my mate. The two concepts are one and the same.”
hadn’t known why Potter had chosen another path, despite speculating on it for weeks. “Why, if I may ask?”
, Harry. Now stop admiring my bedroom and start admiring me.” Harry chuckled, but was soon gasping as Draco’s mouth found his again, teasing his tongue and inflaming his senses. His clever fingers skated down Harry’s torso and began playing with the zipper on his trousers. His touch was feather-light, but Harry was already practically vibrating with want.
“Urgh. I think I’ve learned my lesson about mulled wine, Harry. Maybe we can have dinner together later.”
Harry whirled around so fast he nearly tripped on the polished tile floor. He could hear Draco cackling behind him, followed by other sounds. Shoes being kicked off, the metal tang of a zipper slowly pulled down, and a puddle of fabric hitting the floor. A small splash and a wanton moan.
“Yeah? What’s it smell like?” Harry grunted.
“Yes?” Draco asked, but his mouth kept tracing the long column of Harry’s neck, dispensing little nips and licks wherever he saw fit. It was
The man peered through the window of the new fast food joint. The menu board was too far away to read through the glass, but the blurry pictures looked pretty good. The orange and white wallpaper was appealing. The restaurant appeared deserted, which was usually a bad sign, but he was in a hurry...
“Draco--” Potter was standing there, illuminated under the nearest streetlight, staring directly at Draco and making no effort to reciprocate the handshake.
is here! He’s what I wanted to talk about.”
“What are you laughing at?” Malfoy asked suspiciously, swiping at his face and leaving a smear of flour on one cheekbone.
“If he won’t, I will!” Seamus hollered as Dean dragged him back down on the couch with a chuckle.
Yes, Draco Malfoy had been a right prat back in school. But the man Harry had seen today had been curious and excited, anxious for Harry’s approval. And
* * *
It was definitely time to leave, though. Harry paid their tab, tugged a lolling Draco out of the booth, and looped his arm around to drag his boyfriend back to Hogwarts.
When the kiss ended, Harry sighed and pressed his forehead against Malfoy’s. Even he needed a bit of extra courage for what he confessed next. “I did mean that, you know. Seeing you again made me really happy. I’ve been looking forward to seeing you again ever since I left.”
"I hope not," Harry grinned. It had been a surprisingly pleasant teatime, almost like talking to a friend. "What've you been up to, then?"
Harry was confused and too horny to think straight. “How would you even know that?”
Harry mused, choking down a sticky mouthful.
“You even read me that bit of poetry, talk about extra credit--”
Before the words had fully left his mouth, the low hum of a single note on a cello resonated through the space. Other instruments joined the cello one by one, until an entire invisible symphony had come into being around Harry and Malfoy. After they’d tuned themselves, the instruments began to play together. It was languid and blissful. The music was familiar, like something half-remembered from one’s favorite dream.
“Damn it! Potter, you can’t just--
Ron, who had visibly shivered at the phrase ‘Draco’s pants,’ collected himself and went on. “Really? I thought you’d want to, since you’re dating him and all? I’m sure as hell
“Pleasure,” Harry grunted, shoving his hands firmly into his pockets. He disliked shaking hands, and that wasn’t about to change for Malfoy’s flavor of the week.
“Of course not. You didn’t think I would let you slip away now, did you? No. Remember what I said,” Draco growled, twining his arms about Harry’s neck and nipping his ear affectionately. “I do not share. You’re mine, Harry. And I look after what’s mine.” He stared at Harry for a heated moment before stepping back, seemingly mollified by the surprise and acceptance he saw in his eyes. Draco nodded smugly and turned to walk down the hall, still fully nude.
Even Harry’s dreams were not safe from Malfoy. Harry would take hours to fall asleep every night, but once he was finished tossing restlessly in his creaky bed, Malfoy would be there for him. Always waiting so patiently, with cool hands and soft hair and welcoming arms. They would talk for hours, Harry’s head cradled in Malfoy’s lap, or they would explore a sun-streaked meadow that Harry had never seen.
Harry snickered. “Nah, nobody would want to eat spiders. But we received an official complaint, so we have to check it out. Come on, let’s get this over with.” He straightened his crimson Auror robes and reached for the door handle.
Apparently deciding Draco wouldn’t hex him into the ground if he picked the wrong song, Potter sighed, “Fine, hand me the bloody book then.” He frowned as he flicked through the choices, but his face brightened as he found the perfect song. He stepped on the small stage and cued up the machine before looking back at his friends with an unreadable face.
Draco was majestic, all lithe and lean in clothes that surely cost more than most houses. Symmetry gilded each line of his body where he stood at the banister. His ice blue robes seemed to absorb and refract all the light in the room, in the whole
“Draco, stop. I have to talk to you.”
Neither did Draco. He lazily flicked his wand, and the casement popped open. The owl entered and hopped over to the tea table, fluttering up to Draco’s lap and sticking out a scroll with his name on it. Unfortunately, Draco recognized the spiky handwriting as he reluctantly unfurled the parchment.
Hermione immediately smirked like the kneazle that got the cream. “Even better. I
. Draco feeds him pellucid grapes and tender fish from sun-warmed countries. He leaves Harry no need to fear. When Harry needs comforting, Draco gives it to him in abundance, without Harry ever having to ask. Draco takes him apart in bed, and puts him back together with great care. Draco’s bed holds him like a cloud, and Draco holds him like a man. He strokes his hair as Harry falls into sleep. It is a delicate, shivering flavor of joy, and Harry has never been happier.
Ronald, I am well aware.”
“In the flesh,” he drawled. “I couldn’t resist when I saw you here. I know what you saw in my shop. And I know that you liked it.”
floated across Harry’s mind.
“Very good, Mr. Malfoy,” Professor Vector nodded. “You are correct. We hope each of you will be reminded of the importance of new beginnings and the purity of true friendship as you share the next year together. What Headmistress McGonagall said about inter house unity doubly applies to each of you, as you are an example for the whole school. With that in mind, here are each of your roommates.” She began to read off a long list. Harry noticed that while there were quite a few inter-house pairings, there were none between Gryffindor and Slytherin. As optimistic as McGonagall seemed to be, she was obviously still a realist.
Unfortunately, Malfoy had followed after all. He stood uncomfortably close, and tension prickled along Harry’s bones. He had promised not to touch Harry, but he knew now he couldn’t trust Malfoy as far as he could throw him. Harry took a deep breath and turned around to face Malfoy, still glaring for all he was worth.
Harry, who was sitting practically on Malfoy’s lap at the other boy’s insistence, shrugged. “Yeah, I could always use more chocolate frogs. I bet Ron and Hermione would like to come too, we should ask them. Maybe even Parkinson? I should try to get to know your friends, too.”
Life with Draco is different, indisputably
Hogsmeade was some distance from the heavy iron gates of Hogwarts. The path ahead was dark, lit only by moonlight. Harry could see snatches of lit windows between the trees, but each twist and turn of the way took them away and revealed them again. Merlin, Draco was heavy. He could have used a feather-light charm, but the weight of Draco’s body against his own somehow made him feel safe, like nothing bad could ever happen to him again.
“Yes, it’s quite invested in my social connections.” Malfoy rolled his eyes, and the sofa he was sitting on almost bucked him off. “Out of the goodness of its heart, of course. But I digress. That brings us to now. Did you have any other questions, Potter?”
