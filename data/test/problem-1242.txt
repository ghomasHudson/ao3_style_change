“Wouldn’t dream of it.  I bet you’re furious, right now,” Harry replies calmly, stepping inside the room.
Harry was just as small as he’d been four years ago.  Draco easily carried him, bridal-style up the stairs and paused.  He didn’t know where his room was.  Everyone who lived here was, presumably, passed out or sicking up into a plant.  Well, Draco thought, there was a perfectly good couch in the sitting room.  He laid Harry out on the sofa and stopped to consider his next move. He could leave him here, of course, cover him with a blanket and get home and forget that this terrible night had ever happened.
“Harry,” he says, and I turn around again.  His eyes are a bit glassy, as though he’s seconds away from tears.  “Please.  If you care about me at all, just leave it alone.  Go back to not caring about them.”
“Alright.  I’ll send an owl with whatever he needs, and I’ll be back when I can.”  Weasley disappeared into the floo quickly, a bit desperately, if Draco were being honest, but at the last minute, he popped his head back into the room.  “Malfoy, do you even know how to look after a baby?”
“He and I have been enemies since I was eleven years old.  There have been times in my life where I truly despised him.”
And that’s what really makes my stomach sink.  That baby has a mother.  And clearly, they occupy separate bedrooms, but Draco didn’t tell me about the baby, so perhaps he’s been equally tight-lipped about his wife.  I’m filled with a hot terrible feeling that I was, unwittingly, the other party in a relationship.  I’m pretty sure that old me would never have condoned this, and new me isn’t that thrilled either.  It sounds messy, and complicated, and I can only imagine how pissed off Mrs. Malfoy’s going to be if she learns that I’ve been shagging her husband.
The first game arrived, and Draco battled nerves all afternoon.  Three hours before the game, after emerging from the toilet where he'd lost his lunch, wiping his mouth and casting a subtle freshening charm on his mouth, he found himself in the locker room.  It was way too early, but having nowhere else to be, he flopped down onto the bench, and closed his eyes.  He dreamt of Harry, and awakened when the equipment manager came in to ready the locker room.
“What,” said Draco.  Realizing that he hadn’t really communicated his point, he tried again.  “What just happened?”  This was closer, although still not really salient.
Draco did nothing for another week, in that, he thought constantly about Harry, but made no moves toward contacting him.  After waking on the morning of the seventh day, interrupting a dream that featured Harry’s bright eyes fixed on his, and his arms around his neck, he gave in, and sent an owl 'round to Hermione.
“True,” Harry concedes. “If only I’d been better.  Faster.” The guilt weighs heavily, some days, and Harry dreams of those they’ve lost nearly every night.
“I’m afraid so, Harry.  We need to appear above reproach.  There can be no hint of any affiliation with those who have practiced Dark Magic in past.”  Kingsley looks regretful, as though he realizes that he’s disappointed me.  I don’t think he truly has any idea.
Her gaze goes a little faraway, and it’s clear she’s thinking hard.  As she bites her lip, I immediately know a few things.  She knows a way to find Scorpius.  She’s hesitant, so it’s either risky or immoral.  And she’s going to tell us no matter what.  “What is it?” My voice is quiet as I ask, but she still jumps a mile.
“You quit your job?”  Mister Fortesque looks thunderstruck.  “But everyone says you’ll be the youngest Head Auror ever.”
“Ironic, isn’t it?” Ron mused.  “Harry can overthrow the Imperius.  He didn’t need the vaccination anyhow.”
matter.  Clothes had always been an armour of sorts, and Draco had never felt more in need of protection.  He considered a new set of robes that he’d ordered a few weeks ago.  Would robes simply underline his insistence on his traditions?  A Muggle suit, which he knew looked good, was his next consideration.  But who wore a suit to something like this?  Finally, he gave up in frustration, and struggled into a pair of skinny denims and a cashmere sweater.  It wasn’t something he ever felt comfortable in, but it wouldn’t do to appear as though he’d put too much thought into it.
Miriam continued, “You’re here today for two reasons.  Firstly, Harry thinks that it’s important for you to know what progress he’s made, which is considerable.  He’s worked very hard during his time here, and I know that he’s excited to share that with you.  Secondly, in the course of his treatment, Harry has uncovered a number of themes that he’s been struggling with, and he’s been working hard to name those themes, and identify what barriers they present for him.”
Scorpius wasn’t far behind.  His face was red with heat and exertion of dragging his trunk, and he was already pulling his Slytherin robes over his head. “Darlings,” Draco said, as he was immediately squeezed into a tight hug from his daughter, then his son.
“Traitor,” the woman hisses at Harry.  “Your parents would be mortified.  This is how you respect their sacrifice?  Shame on you!”
“Sure,” Harry said, feeling a bit awkward.  John was nice, really nice, but Harry just couldn’t muster up the interest.  John made his leave, with an invitation for Malfoy to contact him if Scorpius’ condition changed.
“Yeah, I guess that’s okay.”  Cass’ voice was cool, but Harry knew that she was excited.  She just wanted to punish him a little for his earlier refusal to let her worry about him.
She laughs.  “Hermione had an idea, and at first I thought it was terrible, but now I’m not so sure.”
, they’re so round.  I start to get a bit nervous, because maybe I’m not interpreting the signals right.  Maybe he wasn’t actually chatting me up?  Fuck.  I don’t fancy getting beaten up for being a creep.  “Sorry,” I say, removing my hands from his arse, and giving him some space.  “Was that too forward?”
“No,” she says.  She must see something in my face, because she says, “I’ve been a bit busy, Harry.  I do have a family, and a full-time job as well as helping you.”
“Dad!  Papa!”  As Draco heard the familiar voice, he looked through the crowd, and saw two distinctive heads of hair on their way towards them.  Cass was leading, the bright blue trim on her robes setting off her complexion beautifully.  She’d grown again, Draco noticed, and her face had taken on the countenance of a woman’s.
The shop was empty when they entered, a little gong sounding their arrival.  “One moment,” a melodious voice, heavily accented in French, called from the back room.
“When you ride a Muggle airplane, they always explain what to do in case of emergency.  For example, if the plane lost air pressure, masks fall from the ceiling, and the passengers are instructed to place them over their face, to help them breathe.  For those who are travelling with others, others who are unable to take care of themselves, the flight attendants insist that the person in charge affix their own mask first, before helping others.  Do you know why they do this?”  Draco shrugged, annoyed.  “It’s because, as the person in charge, you need to ensure that you
He’d told Hermione and Ron everything of course, and their reaction was better than he'd feared.  Ron had groused a lot, and the first time they’d all had dinner together had been tense, but all three of them had looked at Harry’s hopeful, happy face, and resolved to try.  And the ice had broken, and they’d become friendly…ish.
Luckily, he found that his best friends were in much improved humour, compared to his last visit.  He spent an entertaining hour with Rose, who was re-writing the story of Sleeping Beauty.  Apparently, the princess wasn’t ‘interesting enough’, and Rose fancied a story where the princess did her own saving.  Looking down at her earnest, beloved little face, Harry couldn’t dispel the ache in his chest.  He knew that he hadn’t really exorcised the ghosts of his past, that his work for DMAC was a transparent attempt to address the childhood that he hadn’t had.  He also knew that, if he ever listened to Hermione and went to see a Mind Healer, they’d have a field day picking through his unresolved issues.  Still, he couldn’t look at Rose, or Teddy, or Hugo without wondering how anyone could possibly look at the unbridled sweetness and
Now, it was the third day, and it was time to administer the next dose.  Draco was hopeful that five-year-old Harry would be a bit more communicative.  Speaking of, Hermione and Ron appeared through the floo, Rose bouncing in Ron’s arms.  “Hiya Harry!” Ron was cheerful, and Harry looked at him cautiously.  He had grown slightly more convinced of his relative safety, and less hesitant to respond to people, so long as the people were Draco, and Kreacher, and occasionally, Hermione.  When Ron spoke to him, Harry was inclined to hide his face behind his hands.  He ignored Rose completely.
As Draco walked to where his Mother sat, he heard his Father say, “You know, you have the look of a Black about you.”
“Families that were Dark-aligned aren’t all Death Eaters!” Hermione protests, and I give her a look.  Honestly, does she think she’s going to convince him?
“Good, good.  Scorpius, you’re fine to go home again, now.  You’ll need to stay in bed for the next three days, take your potions, and try to sleep as much as you can.  Mr. Malfoy, I’ve a healing salve for you for some of Scorpius’ lacerations.  If you apply it each night, there will be no scars.”
“Alright.  I’ll confirm soon, okay?  In the meantime, can I have a quick look at my desk?  I’d like to know more about the case I was working on, and who knows…maybe it will spark a memory of something.”
It takes more than a second.  He holds Scorpius tightly, and buries his nose into his little neck, and he cries, which freaks the baby out, so he cries too.  I stand, passively watching, uncomfortable with all the feelings, and I hope that it ends soon.  As it turns out, I don’t have to do anything, because that’s when Ron and Hermione show up.  Draco lets them through the wards, and I have an unbearable urge to just run out the front door, and keep running, down the stupidly long driveway, past the ridiculous peacocks that roam the grounds, through the ostentatious gates with the giant ‘M’ in stylized wrought iron, and just keep running down the country road until I find a place where none of this is a problem.  I have no idea if old Harry was any good at dealing with conflict, but the Harry I am now is shit at it.
thinking about Potter’s new romance.  The bell on the door goes, and Harry enters with all of his usual confidence, but there’s something different about his eyes.  A guarded hesitance, as though a realization is dawning slowly on him, and he doesn’t like what he’s learning.
His thoughts were racing, trying to figure out why Harry was doing this.  How was this helping Harry get closure?  Nevermind, he’d vowed to do what Harry wanted, and all this thinking was preventing him from enjoying the first kiss he’d had in four years.  Harry’s lips parted slightly, and his tongue delicately traced Draco’s lip, seeking entrance.  Draco’s mouth opened with a blissful sigh, and Harry’s tongue was there, gently sliding against his.  Before he had a chance to really process it, Harry had pulled away, and scrambled back onto his arse.  Draco blinked dumbly at him.
So that’s what they did.  Ollivander had some interesting theories on the Elder wand, and Harry’s affinity with Malfoy’s wand.  By the time that Harry checked his watch, several hours had gone by.
“Well, you manage the budget, and you attend Wizengamot, that’s our judicial system, meetings, you’d be the public face of the Aurors, and work with the press to communicate things.  You’d be responsible for ensuring that policies and procedures are followed by your team.  You’ll sign off on all arrest reports, and be responsible for tactical operations.”
I’m nearly through telling Luna about my fabricated experience raising goats in Ireland, the summer after fourth year, when an owl arrives and taps on the window.  Recognizing it as Draco’s, I can’t help the smile that spreads across my face, and I rush to let it in.  I untie the letter hastily, but my smile falters a bit as I read it.
Astoria had finished changing Scorpius into his robes, which were covered with lions.  “Like a Gryffindor,” he crowed.  “Just like Harry!”
“Azkaban, likely.  Because she’s on probation, she won’t receive a trial.  Her sentence is administered by her probation officer.”
“Thank you for coming in to see me,” he says.  He looks a bit uncomfortable, and, although I’m not sure why my instincts tell me to do so, I decide not to make this easy for him.  I nod, and wait.  “I want to start out by assuring you that this conversation is not an official discussion, just a friendly chat with someone who has always had your best interests at heart.”
“Point.”  I view the picture more closely.  It was clearly taken last night as Draco rescued me from the Leaky Cauldron.  I’m barely on my feet, and Draco’s half dragging, half carrying me towards the apparation point.  Worst of all is the way, just before the picture loops again, I look up at Draco.  Fuck.  Ron’s right.  I’m at very least smitten-adjacent.
“Oh.  That sounds sort of vile, if I’m being honest.  Do you suppose I could have a pint of something?”
“I know that with some types of organ donations, the donor has to maintain certain protocols after the donation is completed.  If Cass donates her bone marrow, will it affect her quality of life in the long term?”
“Sweetheart, I don’t know who told you that, but it isn’t how it works,” Harry said.  His instincts were
“Do you think you’ll sleep?”  She nodded, and so Draco tucked the blankets snugly around her.  “May I kiss you goodnight?”  Another nod.  Draco spelled the lights low, refreshed the glass of water by her bed, and left her to rest.
Astoria did exactly that, wrapping Cass into a tight hug and whispering into her ear.  Cass listened intently, nodding a bit, before she flung her arms around Astoria.  Harry’s eyes flicked to Scorpius, who was watching his mother and sister approvingly, and then to Draco.  Draco was watching his daughter with a look of wonder in his eyes.  Heart sinking, Harry understood what lurked beneath his gaze.  Draco had been worried about hoping too much.  He’d kept his distance, afraid that if he wanted it too much, that his hopes would come crashing down around him.  Now that he knew that Cass would be able to save his son, he could set his sights on his daughter.  Knowing from experience that Potters had next to no resistance to his charms, it was simply a matter of time before Cass was under his spell.
“It should be no problem, but I’ve never tested the combination of these two potions.  They’re both harmless on their own, but one can never be sure how one potion will interact with another.”
“Yes, I can understand that,” Harry soothed.  “Would it be possible for me to speak to her?  Maybe while Violet is at her lesson?  Sometimes it’s easier to get things out into the open without little ears listening in.”
“I’ll have to tell them, turn her in,” Hermione said, her voice empty.  “It’s the right thing to do.  Sometimes, even if it’s hard, you have to do the right thing.”
“I didn’t fancy going back to the office, and I remembered that today was your work-from-home day.  Can you do me a cup of coffee?”
Luna has brought him an injured snake.  Harry didn’t realize that he wanted a pet, but she claims that the snake is unable to tell her where it hurts, and it’s an ideal situation.  The snake is ill mannered and not overly inclined to conversation.  “You speak?” it asks, dismissively, as though Harry were sullying the noble language of the snake.
“Malfoy,” he growled, sitting up and reaching for his wand.  Draco’s heart sank.  Harry blinked a few times, and then said, “Draco?”  He seemed to be struggling to reconcile the Malfoy he knew when he was eleven with the Draco he’d spent the previous days with.
“Well, I was never going to marry her.  It was the one thing that I couldn’t give my parents.  I just couldn’t marry her.”
His pupils dilate, and he sinks to his knees, clumsy hands unbuckling my belt, opening my fly.  I’m not a blowjob expert, by any means, but this one’s mediocre at best.  Still, mouth on cock is hard to screw up too much, as I demonstrated the other night.  He pulls off.  “You can fuck my mouth, if you want.”  His voice is shy, his eyes cast submissively downward.  He has incredibly long eyelashes, which rest appealingly on his high cheekbones.  I grip him by the hair, thrust into his waiting mouth.  He moans.  It’s perfunctory.  A means to an end, but still, I come, and as I pull sharply on his hair when I spill down his throat, by the sounds of him, he does too.
I manage to gather my thoughts enough to say, “Yeah, I need to talk to Mill.  That stupid fucker Smith threatened me, and I think he’s going to send Pansy to Azkaban to punish me.  I wasn’t going to do anything, because I’m done fighting fucking wars, but it pissed me off, and I changed my mind.”
She stops walking abruptly, pulls her long hair back from her face and stares up into the sky for a moment.  Finally, she breathes out an enormous breath, and turns to face me.  “Not,” she says carefully, “by anything you’ve ever said.”
A week later, it was Christmas eve, and Draco had finally settled on a plan.  He’d spent the week making floo calls all over England, and in the end, it was Hagrid who had helped him find what he was looking for.  After travelling to Scarborough, and handing over a truly shocking number of galleons, he was now on his way to Devon, his nerves in no way lessening at the thought of what he was about to do.  He’d checked with Hermione, to make sure his plan wasn’t completely mad, and she’d been overwhelmingly enthusiastic.  Still though, this could go so wrong, and the chance for humiliation was so high.
for once.  This thing with the Slytherins was from before, but it doesn’t sit right that some slimy little shit can threaten me in a fucking storage room.”  I stalk across the room and stare out the window, trying to get my emotions under control.  I’m so bloody sick of not knowing what’s going on, and doing the wrong thing all the time.
His team was thrilled to have him back, and before he knew it, the season had started again, and he was practicing five days a week.  He returned to the condo each night, exhausted, barely managing to eat something before collapsing into bed.
a chicken?  Eventually, he’d given up on deciphering it, and had stuck it to one of his cupboard doors with Spellotape.  When he looked at it now, it made him smile, but he still didn’t know what had possessed Harry to send it.
“Please, oh Merlin, please, I think I’ll die if you don’t,” Harry whimpered.  Draco wasted no time getting his mouth onto Harry’s cock, and when he licked the precome that was already dripping from Harry’s slit, Draco himself nearly came.
“He did?”  Scorpius’ eyes were wide and his smile was enormous.  Astoria and Harry exchanged pleased little smiles.
“No!” Harry’s voice sounded alarmed.  “No, no, I want to stay.  It just seemed strange to get to stay with you.  Are we good friends, when I’m a grown up?”
As I emerge from the Ministry, and into the sun, I consider what I’ve just done.  None of quitting my job was about Draco, not really.  I know that this decision has been brewing since my first meeting with Kingsley, but I’m a bit shaken by the finality of it.  It’s clear that the old me didn’t have much of a life, outside work, and to me…current me, that just seems like a waste.  Why didn’t I just stay dead, if all I planned to do was work, and languish in a comfortable, but ultimately unfulfilling relationship?  Still though.  I might end up furious when I get my memories back.  Ultimately, since old me isn’t around to ask, I decide to make the most of my new found freedom, and go eat some ice cream.
Draco’s eyes were clouded as he looked steadily at Harry.  “He’s everything to me,” he said quietly.  “I know that I’ve done wrong in my life, Potter, I know that you have the power and the motivation to completely ruin my life.  But I know that you’re not the kind of man to play into petty revenge.  I would give up anything for Scorpius.  Please, Potter.
.  He wished he could hate him.  It would be so much easier if he could get mad at him, and call him a ferret, and make fun of his inferior seeking skills.   But they weren’t in school anymore, and for the first time in a long time, Harry knew he had no position to claim a moral high ground.  Harry had screwed up, and Draco was well within his rights.  It sucked.  It seemed that, all of the times in his life that Harry had proved himself fallible, weak, it had something to do with Draco.
“You haven’t, you know.  Done anything wrong, that is.  Kreacher wasn’t trying to hurt you.  He wanted to keep that nice sweater clean.  He was putting a napkin on you.”
“I miss you too.”  I don’t, not really, but there’s some reason why old me loved her like a sister, and my instincts tell me it’s worthwhile to find out.  She has very kind eyes, after all.  Besides, I do like Ron, and I won’t see him much if I’m fighting with his wife.  “But Hermione, I don’t want us to make up and find ourselves in the same situation in a week.  I appreciate your advice, but I do want to make my own decisions.”
“Cass is an instinctive thought reader.  When she’s close to someone, she can read their thoughts, usually if someone is feeling strong emotion.  I’ve done quite a bit of work with her, to give her the ability to control it, but sometimes she decides she isn’t getting enough information, and she invades my mind to find out what’s going on.”
But things changed.  For a while, they changed for the better, and Harry had wondered if it was all a dream.  And then things had changed for the worse.  And after that, Harry had decided to immigrate to Canada, and he’d had to start all over again.  Now, when he was happy in his new life, things were going to change, and he’d lose everything all over again.
“There is.  But we can also just be two old friends, having a drink, celebrating their healthy children.”
“Maybe don’t bother breaking the curse then,” I say, mostly joking, but a little bit not, and kiss him again.
Hermione laughed and laughed.  Her serious face completely transformed and Draco watched, entranced.  “Say what you will about Harry, but I don’t think that him being lucky is accurate, strictly speaking.”
“Nah, she’s likely to tell mum, and nobody wants that.  If you think Hermione nags…I’ll figure out a story that will satisfy them all.”
Harry begins to dream again, of the night in the forest.  He sees himself turning the stone, sees his parents, Sirius, Remus.  Instead of them walking him to his fate, they look at him curiously.  “Do I know you?” His Mother asks, thoughtfully.  “You look rather like a boy I once knew, but he was alive.”
“Oh, okay.”  Ginny thinks for a moment.  “Well, we both like Quidditch.  And I’ve had a crush on you since first year at Hogwarts.  And you’re quite handsome,” she says, and I raise my eyebrow at her.  That’s it?  That’s all she can come up with? “Yeah, alright, you put me on the spot,” she mutters.  “It’s hard to quantify, Harry, we’ve been together a long time.”
“Do they tell you that?”  Harry nodded.  “Harry, sometimes, do strange things happen to you?  Things you couldn’t explain?”  Another nod.  “That’s perfectly normal.  It’s just accidental magic, and it happens to young witches or wizards when they feel upset.  We all do it.  It doesn’t mean that there’s anything wrong with you.”
This was veering into territory that Harry didn’t feel was productive for an introduction to magical Britain, but once they started learning more about magic, they’d inevitably learn about Harry Potter.  “I was,” he said carefully, “but unfortunately, my parents died when I was very young, and I was raised by a non-magical aunt and uncle.”
He thought that maybe he saw a hint of Harry’s expression softening, but he continued.  “I won’t make any excuses, because it doesn’t matter why I didn’t tell you the truth.  I’ve lied to you before, and I promised I wouldn’t, and I broke that promise.  But something’s been bothering me, because I also promised that you’d be safe, that I would make sure of it, and I can’t do that when we aren’t speaking.  So…” His voice cracked and he swallowed hard, and continued, “so I brought you something, to keep you safe, and maybe to keep you company, and I’m not even sure if it’s something that you still want, so you don’t have to take it.  In fact, I think maybe this was a stupid idea, and maybe I’ll be going now.  I’m sorry to have disturbed you all.”
And they do.  And the month following, the whole bunch of them meet again, but this time, Pansy Parkinson arrives too.  Harry stills for a moment, as she raises her chin defensively, but, recalling his earlier words to Hermione, he smiles and said, “Good to see you Pansy.  I’m glad you could come.”  His welcome sets the tone, and within a few hours, they are merrily on their way to getting pissed.
To those of you who thought that Harry was a massive pushover who just needed to STAND UP FOR HIMSELF FOR ONCE IN HIS DAMNED LIFE, I hope that he manages to do just that for you.
“No, darling.  You aren’t like him.  Not by any stretch of the imagination.  I didn’t tell you, because I didn’t want you to be ashamed of something that you’re able to do.  The only reason I told you now is because I needed you to understand why it’s so upsetting for me.”
The room went quiet.  “It’s because everyone always forgets the Hufflepuffs,” Hannah said mildly.  “We’re quieter than the other houses, but we have value.  I just don’t like us being forgotten.”
“I tried really hard,” Harry confessed.  “I tried so hard to give Cass a childhood that was different from mine.  I wanted so much for her to feel like she had power over the decisions that impacted her, and to be a strong support when she needed it.  It was really important to me not to perpetuate the cycle.  It was so important that she felt safe to ask for what she needed, because…I’m not very experienced in asking for what I need.  At the time, I didn’t realize that I was taking all of the pain and rejection I felt from my own childhood and trying to be the opposite of it.  I didn’t see that I had starting defining myself as Cass’ Dad…as only Cass’ Dad, and when…”
“Yeah.”  I bite my lip.  Pansy’s abrupt release just makes things seem even more suspicious.  But, Draco asked me not to intervene, and Pansy’s out anyways, and even though I’m not certain that Hermione will manage to go a day, let alone the rest of our lives, without bossing me, maybe this is one of those things that a smart man would leave be.
The pensieve is an enormous basin, made of ancient-looking stone.  There are carved snakes along the outside, and it sits on a stand of weathered copper.  It’s in a room I’ve never been in before, and the stone walls dim the flickering torches.  I lift the vial, and admire the silvery strands within.  “Ready?”  Draco’s hand is a bit clammy as he takes mine.
Draco eyed the plate.  Three bites.  They’d been sitting there for nearly an hour, and his birdlike child had eaten precisely three bites of his pancake.  “Are you sure you can’t eat a little more?”
“Were you?” Draco asked, suddenly sad.  The first time a Wizard held a wand should be completely joyous.  He was disappointed that it wasn’t that way for Harry.
“I don’t know,” Ellen Fortesque says.  “Dear, you’re making a lot of hasty decisions, are you certain you won’t regret them?”
Pulling Harry closer, Draco kissed the spot, just behind his ear that turned Harry into liquid treacle.  “I have a few ideas,” he whispered.
“You picked a terrible best friend for that,” Draco remarked.  He was feeling more like himself than he had in years.  Who knew that it took the return of two-thirds of the Golden Trio to keep his mind off his problems.
Harry looked at Astoria gratefully.  He wanted to help her smooth things over, ease the way for Cass and Scorpius, but he knew that anything he said right now would incite Draco to further rage.  It was distracting, having Draco treat him the way he had in school, when Harry remembered them getting past it all. Cass, as usual, sensed his unease, and came over to climb into his lap.  As her fingers found the cuff of his button down, she said, “Astoria, can you tell me more about whether or not I can help Scorpius?”
A throat clearing at the door had both of them startling, and Ron grinned.  “I never thought I’d see the two biggest swots from Hogwarts, Gryffindor and Slytherin, heads bent over the same book and not bickering about it.  Look at all our personal growth!”
“Are you alright, Harry?” Hermione asked.  Harry didn’t seem to hear her at first, so firmly were his eyes locked with Draco’s.
Scorpius’ eyes widened. “See Papa, I told you that Cici was a Vampire,” he said, but he obediently presented an arm, and Dean quickly spelled six vials full.   As he left the room, Healer Cici Clarke ducked around him as she entered it.  She was in her mid-forties, and Muggleborn, with long dark hair that she wore in a braid, and sparkling blue eyes.  When Scorpius had been referred to her, Draco was unsure about her objectivity (there were still Muggleborn shopkeepers in Diagon Alley that refused to serve them), but Cici had been a gift from the Gods.  With joint Muggle and Wizarding degrees, she was the most knowledgable specialist available, and Draco and Astoria trusted her explicitly.  More importantly, Scorpius adored her.
“You look exceptionally fit, my darling.  Except…” she scrutinized his face, her expression sharpening.  “Whatever has happened to your nose?”
“Ginny?  Marlin, Draco, are you thick?  You know I’m gay.  Why in the name of Circe’s saggy left tit would I end up with Ginny?”
She let her head relax on his shoulder for a moment, and then put her hands on either side of his face and kissed his forehead.  “You are the best,” she said.  “Why haven’t you let me marry you again?”
“It doesn’t matter.  I’ll do it.” Draco casts a desperate look at me and then at Hermione.  “It’s my
“Not because I didn’t want to,” Draco says hurriedly.  “I tried so hard not to push you, though, and then you just looked so beautiful standing there, and you pushed me to tell you the person I’m mad about, and I just…slipped.”
I feel a bit sick.  Madam Marchbank patiently leads Smith through each of her charges, and the various punishments doled out for each violation.   She follows it with each and every one of the Slytherins from our year that I’ve been told about, as well as a bunch of names I’ve never heard before.  It paints a bleak picture.  Nobody escaped his wrath, except for Draco.  I wonder what exactly I said, at his trial and afterwards, to keep him free from this revenge.
After they leave, he settles Rosie in the rocker on his lap with Beetle the Bard.  The old stories comfort him, and he always reads ‘The Three Brothers’ first.  The little girl’s eyes eventually close, and Harry settles her in her cot, awash with love, and fighting the feeling of being on the outside looking in.
“What is it?” Weasley’s voice was, if possible, even more panic-stricken, and he was pointing a shaky finger at the floor of the shower room, where, sitting, bemused, on a fluffy towel was a baby.
Draco figured that this was as good a time as any to ask some questions of his own.  “Harry, what was it like with your Aunt and Uncle?”
“I’ll try, Cass,” he said, and sighed.  “The thing you need to know about Harry Potter, is that I have been fascinated by him for as long as I can remember. When I was small, every child in our World knew his name.  Whether he was a hero or a menace depended greatly on what side your parents fought on.  You know about Voldemort?”
“Actually,” Harry said, "because my home has quite a bit of ambient magic in it, it can sometimes interfere with the way electricity works.”  He looked around.  “Is Mrs. Powers joining us this morning?”
“Harry, dear, you haven’t called me Professor in years.  I know that you are surprised to hear me bring up a name from your past, and I’ll admit, I did consider that it might be kinder not to discuss this with you.  In the end, however, I decided that you have long past earned the right to make these sorts of decisions for yourself.”  Harry noticed Snape nodding approvingly, and it bolstered him a bit.
The next memory is of a showdown with someone who’s clearly Lord Voldemort.  I can’t really bring myself to listen to what the younger me, and the terrifying snake-man are saying, but it’s interesting to watch the spectators.  They’re looking at old Harry like he’s some sort of saviour.  He’s so young.  Why would people follow this child onto a battlefield?  Because it's clear from their expressions that they would…or
Ron did, and when they were sitting on the high stools at the counter of the lab with their cups, Ron said, “So the first idea is the one that won’t get me into any trouble, but it’s less likely to succeed.  If I can find any trace of the potions she’s been dosing Harry with, or if I can find someone who was selling them to her…”
“Good, I don’t think she knows much about the Hungarian Horntail.”  Scorpius wriggled down from his booster seat, and ran from the room to get his model Dragon.
“That’s true,” Draco said.  “If he aged two years from the first dose, he’ll be five by the weekend.  We’ll just have to tread carefully until then.  I’m going to see if I can get him to take a nutrition potion though.  It can’t hurt anything.”
And yet...His lovely, wonderful daughter.  Who had never been allowed to grow up with grandparents who adored her, with the stability of a family.  The only man he'd ever loved, who never knew about his own child?
The team they were playing was aggressive, skilled.  Draco found himself checked into the boards, and saw a familiar flash of green through the plexiglass.  It reminded him of something, but he shoved the thought to the back of his mind, and focused on trying to draw the opposing right winger into a hooking penalty.  Instead, the player mouthed off at him, and his temper gave way.  Gloves flew onto the ice, and before he really knew what was happening, he was shoving the guy, punching him.  The guy’s helmet went askew, and Draco punched him in the cheekbone.  The referee was there before he was able to inflict much damage, and Draco found himself in the penalty box.  He scanned the crowd again, and could swear he saw a familiar mop of unruly black hair.  Before he could look further, his penalty had ended, and he was back on the ice.
Breakfast goes smoothly, with Kreacher plying me with more food than I think I could consume in a week.  I learn that he doesn’t actually live here, and also that I apparently own another house.  Why I’m living in the most boring flat known to man while I own an entire house, I have no idea.  It’s bound to be more exciting than this one.
He snorts a laugh at that, and I grin over at him, before continuing, “So, yeah, you’re all caught up.  Ginny and I broke up with minimal fuss, because having a gay boyfriend isn’t good for anyone, unless that anyone is another gay man.  I’m cursed, and I don’t remember anything about you, other than how hard you made me when you were grinding on me at the club.  Nobody seems to give a fuck that I’m cursed, except me, and I’d like you to help me break it.”
“And then she said, since I wasn’t interested in doing things the easy way, we could do things the hard way.  She plugged my nose until I had to breathe through my mouth, and poured the potion down my throat.”
Kreacher chose this moment to pop back into the room, and if Draco had ever thought ill of the strange little elf, he took it all back now.  “Master Harry Potter is ready for his nap,” Kreacher said, and the baby all but leapt into the elf’s arms, gripping one of his batlike ears tightly.  Narcissa rose gracefully, and kissed the baby on his forehead before Kreacher disappeared with him.
“I didn’t mean to go back to Canada for good,” Harry said, as if he hadn’t heard Draco.  “Not at first.  I wanted to give you both some time, and I wanted to give myself some time, and then, when the hurt was a bit less raw, I could come back and give Cass some continuity.  But as the days went by, her emails were sounding like she was doing okay.  And I…wasn’t.  Okay.  And then…” Harry raised his hands in a hopeless gesture.  “And I told myself that this was my punishment.”
“And what about magic,” Astoria asked.  “Many children your age will soon start to show signs of accidental magic.  Has that happened to you?”
“Why would I do that?  If it’s something bad, who do you think they’ll blame?  I don’t want anything to do with this.”
Papa thought about this for a moment, and said, “I don’t see why not.  It’s Sunday, and I know that the family usually all gets together for Sunday dinner.  Would you like me to see if you could go?”
“Kreacher will be helping, then,” he says, as though it’s an enormous burden, but he’s prepared to face it.  Bit of a martyr, this one.
So, in order to avoid making those of you who have been commenting faithfully not have a freaking HEART FAILURE, I'm posting today, and I'll try to get the next chapter up over the weekend, and then one more early next week.  I can't bear to make you all wait too long for a resolution.
They were interrupted by the arrival of Astoria, Scorpius and Cass, who were followed onto the patio by Narcissa and Lucius.  Cass was practically vibrating with excitement, and, as she ran around, exclaiming over the decorations, and hugging her grandparents, Scorpius trailed after her, shouting his approval.  Lucius approached where Harry and Draco were sitting, and Draco tensed.  “James Potter, as I live and breathe!” Lucius exclaimed jovially.  “I never thought I’d see you here!”
I try desperately to think about how having a third of your magic taken away would feel.  Magic is a strange concept for me, having no context of experience.  I feel it, the deep, comforting humming through my veins, and the rush of power as it travels through my wand, but, like nearly everything else in my life, there’s no grounding for it.  Just like I’d be disappointed, but unbroken if Hermione, or Ron were no longer around, I wouldn’t exactly grieve the loss of my magic.
He wasn’t sure what to expect when he carefully dropped two precise drops of potion onto Harry’s neck, and cast the gentle Aguamenti, but Harry's tiny body going rigid and his eyes rolling backward wasn’t it.  “Jesus!  Jesus Fuck!” Draco cried, alarmed.
“I think we’ve talked enough,” Draco says.  Harry nods, and stands, and is about to turn towards the door.  Draco feels a grin stretch across his face, and says, “so you’d better hurry up and kiss me, you shameless flirt.”
He wishes that he had someone to talk to, someone who has more experience, who might understand how he feels.  He considers talking to Dumbledore, but immediately rejects the idea.  His feelings for Dumbledore, even years later, are too complicated for him ever to trust his once-mentor again.  Dumbledore, he realizes, despite his pretty words after Sirius disappeared through the Veil, was perfectly willing to sacrifice Harry for the greater good.  He finds himself thinking more about Tom Riddle, who’s life paralleled his own until they turned opposite ways at a crossroads.  He longs for someone who might help him sort through his complicated feelings, and then chides himself for wanting the very thing that he’d told Luna he
“Scorpius Amicus, if you don’t get dressed right this minute, you won’t be going to Diagon Alley with us,” Draco said.  He could feel his cheeks heating as his patience eroded.
“Really?” Harry asked.  “I always did.  I used to always have to roll the cuffs of my trousers up, but just before my birthday, I could always roll them a little less.”
I laugh.  “Forgive me, but having all of your memories wiped out makes you a bit less inclined to invite hostile strangers into your sitting room.  Who are you exactly?”
“That’s what I thought,” Harry says smugly, and he kisses Draco so soundly that he’s left gasping.  “You know, this isn’t helping me get ready any sooner.”
“Yes, several.  We’ve been lucky to prosper in the Alley for over a hundred years, and we’ve been lucky to be able to reopen after the recent troubles.  We were closed for three years, as we had to go into hiding during the War.  It was a terrible time for all of the businesses here.”
Draco frowned.  It could be any number of things and if the fact that Draco couldn’t narrow it down didn’t tell him everything about the impossibility of their relationship…He wasn’t at all sure how to explain things to Cass, but maybe he could put it off for a while longer.  Little girls deserved to be free of nightmares like the ones that Harry lived through, and clearly, Harry felt the same way, since he hadn’t told her anything.  “And what do you think that is?”
“But it was so long ago.  And dad said that a whole bunch of people helped to get rid of Lord Snakeface.  Why would people single him out?”
“Well,” I point out, “isn’t that telling you something?  How many people do you know who fight like that and don’t have
“Sometimes, people are too shy to speak up when they feel uncomfortable.  They don’t want to hurt someone’s feelings, or they’re frightened of making someone mad at them.   That’s rubbish!  There is one thing in this world that belongs to you and you alone, and that yourself.  You are in charge of your body and your mind.  You get to say whether someone touches you are not.  If someone else gets offended, that’s their problem, not yours.  I always want you to remember that.  And if someone is telling you any differently, then you go and tell someone you trust.  Okay?”
“I’ve worked very hard to repair the damage done to our family’s reputation, but, understandably, there are still many people who suffer the impacts of our actions.  I am hoping that I can avoid exposing Scorpius to the worst of it, especially while he’s so young.”
Harry sniffed.  He could smell the scent of a recently-smothered fire.  He looked beyond the enormous man, and noticed evidence of charred curtains on a window.  “I need to come in, please,” Harry said firmly.
Hermione responds by bursting into tears, which startles everyone, particularly Pansy, who looks at her as though she’s grown a set of antlers.  Ron produces a wrinkled handkerchief, and after Hermione mops up her face, she looks at me appealingly.  “I’m sorry,” she whispers.  “I didn’t mean…It all came out wrong.”
Draco watched the exchange suspiciously.  He couldn’t figure out what Potter was up to.  He sounded so sincere, as though he didn’t bear Draco any ill will at all.  Maybe he was telling Cass terrible things about Draco in private.  The child certainly looked at him critically enough.  And why was she so concerned with looking after him?  What was wrong with Harry, that his child needed to take care of him? It was irrational, Draco knew, but he couldn’t help feeling jealous of their closeness.  Harry and Cass didn’t seem to need anyone else.
A week passes, with no sign of my missing memories.  I’m beginning to be resolved to the idea that they’ll never return, but things are good, and maybe I’m better off without them.  The missing magic is, frankly, an enormous pain, but I’m making slow and steady progress through the spell books, and Hermione arranges for a mad witch named Luna to come and tutor me when I’m not working at the ice cream shop.  After a few days of spell lessons, I start to wonder if maybe Hermione’s still mad at me after all.  I’m warned ahead of time that Luna is proficient at spellcasting, but not to listen to her insane stories.  And they are.  Insane, that is.  I’m never certain if Luna’s being serious or not.  It seems that she’s quite interested in magical creatures, but I can never see the ones she points out, and if this is a prank, it’s a damned elaborate one.
“Listen, this is none of my business, and you’re welcome to tell me to stay out of it, but…I know that Louise wanted to go to University, but she’s needed here in the shop.  I’d like to change that.”
Harry regarded him for a moment, seeming to weigh up the look in Draco’s eyes.  Finally he sighed.  “My bedroom, I suppose.”  They tiptoed upstairs to a large room.  Posters of Muggle girls on motorbikes were plastered on the walls.  Draco raised an eyebrow.  “This was my godfather’s room.  I couldn’t stay in my room, after.  And then I couldn’t bear to take those down when I moved in here.”  For a moment, Harry’s eyes seemed to glisten with unshed tears before he blinked hard.  “Okay, Draco.  If you insist, you can tell me whatever you need to…but I can’t imagine that anything you say will make a difference.”
“Don’t be a prat.  You always go to bed at the same time as I do, and then keep me awake with your chattering!”
“It’s like a castle!  I’ve never felt anywhere so magical!”  Just then, a house elf popped into the floo lounge, and gave an astonished squeak when she saw them.  She popped out just as quickly, leaving Harry watching where she’d been with a bemused head tilt.
“Thank you.  I am aware that you and Draco have mended your relationship since your schooldays, and Minerva tells me that you’re not currently in contact with anyone outside the Castle.  I thought you might wish to know.”
“Draco, I’m not with Ginny anymore.  I’m gay.  Of course you wouldn’t have known that, and I can see how this would have seemed like some sort of elaborate setup, but it’s not.  I can’t tell you why I was so closeted before, but…I have no interest in hiding who I am.  Not anymore.  I just want a nice life.”
Draco paused for a moment, not certain where to begin.  How did one explain his greatest regret, especially to the product of that very relationship?
“Maybe,” he allowed.  “We never tested the magic levels in the rats before and after.  Is it possible that the potion just overwhelms them? Burns through the magic too quickly?”
“Oh spare me the dramatics, Wendell,” she snaps.  He gasps.  I’m not sure why, exactly.  Maybe he’s embarrassed that his name is so
“Yeah, I understand,” Harry said.  “I do.  I can tell you that you’re blameless all day, and that’s still not going to stop you from beating yourself up.  Daniel was…”. She went rigid at the name.  His throat closed for a moment, and swallowed hard.  “We’re always going to remember him, yeah?  And we’re going to use that memory to do our best with all the kids we meet going forward.  But you can’t burn yourself out, otherwise, who will be there for the next one?”
“Yes.” Draco looked uncharacteristically ill at ease.  “I was unprepared for your return, and the situation was exacerbated by my worry over Scorpius’ health.  I didn’t react well to learning about Cass.”
No, he had realized.  Harry was on his own, and he’d deal with this himself.  He couldn’t imagine having Draco look at him with pity, having moved on with his own life, and still tied to Harry by the burden of a child, a child born out of wedlock, to a man that Draco hadn't cared about.  It was unimaginable that this tiny little speck of a person be anything less than treasured.  If Harry had meant nothing to Draco, he might not even want to know Harry’s child.  Or worse, with his knowledge of Pureblood customs and Wizarding laws, could he take the baby away?
Harry liked Narcissa Malfoy very much, but he sometimes hated the knowing, subtle way she said things.  It left him feeling simple-minded and inadequate.  “I’ll try not to,” he replied, hoping that she wouldn’t press the issue.  “I should get back and check on Cass, though.  Thank you for the talk.”
he have done in Harry's place?  If he'd been rejected, alone?  He knew that Harry's relationship with the Weasleys had been strained after he and Ginny broke up, and Ron and Hermione hadn't exactly been supportive of him dating Draco.  And Harry had always been under public scrutiny.  Would Draco have been able to handle the speculations, the gossip, if he'd been in Harry's place?
So Draco did.  He folded his robes, and crawled into the bed in his boxers and a t-shirt.  Harry was already under the covers.  His arms wrapped around Draco and he stroked his hair.  “Just sleep, Draco.”
That pattern continues for another six months, until the seventh, when the scrap of parchment simply says,
I shrug.  “It helped me to understand the difference between how I was and how I am now.  But I don’t know if it’s worth it.”
“I don’t think you’re thick, Harry, honestly.  I just…You just see the good in people, and I don’t want you to be hurt.”
“I know,” she says miserably.  “I love you, Harry, I really do, but it can be really difficult.  If you ever just told me anything, even once…”. She trails off, her voice wobbling towards tears.  “You talk to Ron and Hermione, a bit, but never me.  And it makes me crazy.  I’m not this girl, you know?  I’m not this needy, weak, girl, desperate for whatever crumb she can get.”
“Do you think that’s a good idea?”  Again, the words weren’t unkind, exactly, just, cool.  Neville had lost all of the shy fearful composure that he carried at Hogwarts.  In its place was a quiet, confident man.
?”  She was his oldest friend.  Harry’s heart lurches.  If he falls out with Pansy, Draco will truly have nobody.  It doesn’t cross his mind that Draco's wife-to-be might prove to be a source of comfort.
“Oh spare me,” I say.  “I’m nobody’s hero.  We don’t even know who’s taken Scorpius, and we’re wasting time arguing about it.”  I feel helpless, and desperate to do something, but I haven’t the faintest idea where to start.
And for Hermione, it was that simple.  She summoned the vial of potion, and headed up the stairs.  Draco followed…at least, he meant to, but found that his feet refused to move.  Instead, he breathed, and counted, and tapped his fingers.  The time crawled by.  He wasn’t sure how long it had been, but it felt like an eternity.  Soon, though, the sound of slow steps on the stairs caught his attention, and Hermione was coming down the stairs, carefully holding the hands of a messy-haired little boy.
“Hullo,” I say.  “I’ve lost my memory, so I’m sorry in advance if we’re friends and I’m being rude.”
He sets a cupcake onto the counter in front of Draco, who curses the fact that he doesn’t have a work in progress to focus on.  He looks at the cupcake instead.  It’s, frankly, a beautiful piece of confectionary.  It’s topped with a generous swirl of thick silver icing, and there are little silver stars sprinkled throughout.  The wrapping is a dark luscious green.  “Slytherin colours,” Harry says unnecessarily.  “It made me think of you.”
.  And Draco was a shit to him.  Whatever happens, Draco can’t let Harry leave thinking that Draco believes the horrible things he’d said.  He turns wide eyes on Blaise.  “Lock the store up?”
“Oh yes.  I’ve taken over editorial duties for the Quibbler.  It’s very rewarding.  You’d be shocked how few people know about the dangers of Nargles.”
Draco gave Cass a look of pure incomprehension.  “I don’t know how that would even work.  We’ve never had a Muggle visit the house before.  We’d need to disillusion quite a few magical things.”
“Draco, it’s fine.  You don’t have to apologize.  I forgot.  Anyhow, we’ve made a breakthrough.  We should get some sleep, in the morning, we can calculate the exact ratio and timing.”
“I’m afraid,” he admitted.  “I hurt them when I left.  I didn’t say goodbye, just ran away.  I’m afraid that they won’t forgive me.”
“I’d like to have a party at Grand-Mère’s house.  With all of our friends and family.  Do you think we could?”
“Are you seeing someone?” Hermione asked.  “I sort of assumed that your parents would go the arranged marriage route, after the War ended.”
It’s only later, as the thoughts are still running through my mind, that I think about Hermione and cringe.  It’s not the same thing, not exactly; we fought because I resented her implication that I can’t make my own decisions, not because I was determined to help the Slytherins.  But I was taking a moral stand against someone who I know loves me.  And I did make her feel awkward by asking her to help with Parkinson.  Fuck.  I’m not totally in the right, and the realization annoys me.
During her explanation, Scorpius’ tears had abated some, and he was starting to listen to his sister’s story.  She smiled down at him, and he took her hand.  He sat up and whispered something in her ear.  Cass nodded, and said, “I can understand that.  It’s not me that you need to ask, though.  Are you ready to tell your mum what’s wrong?”
“George, I can explain,” Ron said hurriedly.  “It’s Gin.  We found out that she’s been dosing Harry with a love potion.”
“It is,” Peter agreed.  “I was wondering if I could thank you a bit more personally.  Could I take you for dinner?”
“My Dad’s not coming back.  Not right away.  Did you know?”  She didn’t know how else to start the conversation, so she just jumped in, like she would have done with her Dad.  She’d figure out how to talk to Papa later.
When Harry awakes the next morning, Draco is sitting on the edge of Harry’s bed, holding his socks, looking lost.  His eyes rise to meet Harry’s.
She stands and rounds the table until she’s standing next to me.  “You’re a blessing, Harry Potter,” she murmurs into my hair as she pulls me into a hug.  I feel a bit uncomfortable by the raw emotion, so I tell them that I’ll have a solicitor contact them about the investments, and we agree that I can come and help out whenever I’m free.  Their beaming faces usher me from the store, and I walk down the alley with a spring in my step.
“Oh?”  Draco was only half-listening, the conversation with Andromeda replaying itself over and over.
He should.  It’s store policy, and Draco’s margins aren’t good enough to make items on spec, not yet.  “No, that’s fine.”
“I’m sure you have lots of questions, and I’m ready to answer them.  I don’t know whether you want Scorpius to stay here with us, or go have hot chocolate with the house elves.”
If anything, Harry’s words made things worse.  Scorpius’ grey eyes widened, and his breathing became more erratic.  “It’s okay,” Harry soothed.  “I think you might feel a bit scared, so I’d like to start off by doing a little something to help you calm down.  Could you come and stand in front of me?”
He leads me to Courtroom ten, and, really, it’s a good thing I did agree to let him come along, since I’d have had no hope of finding it on my own.  There are fifty-odd witches and wizards sitting in the risers, resplendent in plum robes.  They all look decidedly pissed off, which fills me with satisfaction, since they bloody well should be.  Kingsley looks diminished, sitting, surprisingly meekly, in an armchair in the centre of the open floor.  Draco stiffens beside me, and I look up to see Hermione and Ron in the gallery seats.  I place a hand on his arm.  The time will come to sort that situation out, but not until we’ve solved the bigger issue.  Pansy has delivered (fucking) Wendell this morning, and he is strapped into a chair beside Kingsley’s.  I notice that Zach Smith and a few other sullen-looking wizards are being guarded by Aurors in another corner.  As we sit in the witness’ section, I notice Mill in an upper seat in the Galley, and she gifts me with one of her blooming smiles.
It didn’t take Harry long to get Scorpius’ home address sent to his Galleon.  He ensured that the Obliviation Squad had everything in hand, and let the Secretary know that he’d be taking Scorpius home.  She noted the information down, and sent them on their way, and, after finding a discrete spot, Harry side-alonged Scorpius to a loading dock behind a grocery store.  The walk from there was pleasant, as Scorpius’ neighbourhood was a nice one.
“Fuck you,” he whispers, and then he’s running, ignoring the way Hermione calls his name, and the fact that Teddy, always sensitive to the emotions of others, is crying.  He runs until he reaches his quarters, and he wards the doors behind him.  As he sinks to the floor just inside the door, he struggles to get his breathing under control.  His hands shake, and he clenches them, feels the way his fingernails bite into his palms.  He sits there for hours, unmoving.  He wishes he could cry, but the sense of betrayal is too raw for tears.
The pint had been followed by more, on other days, and then they met at a local Quidditch pitch for a seeker’s game.  Watching Harry’s joyful face as he flew made something unclench in Draco’s chest.  He’d always watched Harry, but now, as his past jealousies dwindled away, Draco felt attraction unfurl in his belly.  They landed, exhausted and lay catching their breath on the pitch.  Harry had won three games, Draco two. “One more.  Let me tie things up,” Draco begged, rolling onto his side to face Harry.
“Don’t we always?”  It’s true.  Gin and Muggle music have gotten them through several of the major crises in their lives.  When Hermione lost her first pregnancy.  When Harry dropped out of the Aurors, and then dropped out of society.  When Andromeda suggested that Harry might be a little too unstable to take an active role in Teddy Lupin’s life.  When Hermione had gotten into a screaming match with Molly Weasley over the way she ran her marriage.  Gin and Muggle music has become a staple.  “Where’s Ron?”
“I don’t think it would help anything.  I can’t change what’s happened.  I don’t expect that he would forgive me if he knew every detail.  Perhaps it is better for him to hate me than to realize that I had loved him, but not chosen him.”
After all, it's ludicrous that Harry would even consider actually dating Draco Malfoy, failed Death Eater, who no longer has a healthy fortune, a future seat on the Wizengamot, or a family name that prompts respect (or fear).  Determined that he won’t be caught as one of the lovesick fools who panted after Harry Potter, Draco responds to his silly advances with long-honed weapons: sarcasm and biting wit.  It seems to be working well, even if it does cause Draco’s heart to leap unnaturally every time Harry gets too close.
“That’s the thing,” he says with a shrug.  “My Father, no doubt, would have vowed revenge on Bright's entire family, and, the Ministry, and achieved it, no doubt, through underhanded means.  That’s not how I want to live my life, and I don’t want to set that sort of example for Scorpius.  It’s just….Bright will be locked away for the rest of his life, and there’s no sort of punishment that would restore what Scorpius has lost.  I’m grateful that he’s alive, even if I feel guilty that he suffered, simply because of his last name.”
“Of course.  We will also continue to allow communication from Gringott’s, and from the Ministry, although I know you don’t love receiving those either,” she says with a wry twist to her lips.  “We also have the ability to prevent those who are not expressly invited from visiting Hogwarts.”
A few moments later, Narcissa came in, her poised expression belying just a little of her own astonishment.  “Draco, and Harry!  What a wonderful surprise!”
“But the Ministry is boring, Scorpius.  Mama and Kattie will make cookies with you,” Astoria said entreatingly.
“I don’t know,” he’d said, a little frantically.  “I want to hide somewhere and have this baby, and keep it safe.  The media...and Draco...I just wish I could be safe.”
“I’m not really interested in doing things the normal way,” she’d said, tossing her head.  “I don’t mind producing one child, if that’s something that you want.  I will love him or her, and I’ll be involved, but I want a career more than anything.  If you want to discreetly divorce after the baby comes, I wouldn’t fight you for custody, just visitation when schedules allow.”
“Yes, I know.  He was a bit confused, mad really.  He thought that you were an enemy, someone who could defeat him.”
“Now.”  The tone brooked no argument, and Cass, white-faced, ran up to the spare room to gather her possessions.
Clean, still allowing his mind to tick through the calculations he’d noted, he climbed the stairs to find that Kreacher and Potter were in the sitting room.  Kreacher was levitating some priceless eighteenth century china cups in an elaborate ballet, to Potter’s riotous amusement.  The baby was laughing enormous belly laughs, and, despite his fear for the china, Draco found himself smiling.  Potter reached starfish hands towards Draco, and Kreacher, a little shamefaced, quickly directed the china back to its spot in the cabinet and bowed low.  “Master Harry Potter has been changed and dressed for dinner,” he said in his gravelly bullfrog voice.  Indeed, the baby had been dressed in very old-fashioned formal dining robes, which, while rather fetching, seemed a bit overdone for the occasion.
After their meals, the waiter brought coffee, and dessert, and Draco noticed that Harry was watching him carefully.  “I’d like to ask you for something,” he said finally.
Harry was laughing.  “Sorry, Draco, I don’t know where they put the brakes on these.”  His face was so close to Draco’s and Draco couldn’t stop staring into those laughing green eyes.  Again, Draco realized how stupid he’d been to leave Harry.  He’d regret it forever.  Harry’s laughter abruptly died as his gaze intensified.  Draco could see that Harry was staring at his lips.  In a different life, one where Draco hadn’t been so stupid, they’d be kissing right now, and laughing, and it would be something that Draco would remember. Except somehow Harry hadn’t gotten the message, and he was drawing closer.  Draco’s breath caught and for a moment he thought he’d die if Harry kissed him.  Then he thought he’d die if Harry didn’t.  Either way, he was completely fucked.  The touch of Harry’s lips to Draco’s was delicate and sweet.  Draco was terrified to move too quickly, lest he scare Harry away.
“And yet, nobody shouts at you and tells you that you’re wasting your life,” Harry says, and even he hears how bratty his tone is.
“That’s right,” Harry says.  “He’ll need to have people around him.  This is more important than my hurt feelings.”
I move a little closer, and the most delicious whimper escapes Draco’s slightly parted lips.  His eyes are wide, and riveted on mine.  “May I?” I repeat, and he nods slightly.  I start gently, just the slightest press of lips, my hand working its way into his hair.  His eyes fall closed, and I trace the seam of his mouth with my tongue.  As it opens for me, and I press my tongue inside, his arms wrap around my waist, pulling us closer.  He tastes delicious, and the friction of our tongues against one another is intoxicating.  I don’t notice time passing, but as his hands slip down to my arse, and he pulls us closer, I feel his cock, hard against mine.
