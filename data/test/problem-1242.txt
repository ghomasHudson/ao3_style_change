Draco knelt either side of shoulders. Harry went to bring his hand up but Draco swatted it away.
“This place being used as Order Headquarters? She would have been sickened...” Bellatrix didn’t seem particularly concerned with the scene in front of her and was instead staring round at what used to be a friendly place to her.
The bell rang through the school to declare lunch was over.
Harry hit him on the shoulder.
Draco sucked him hard, alternating between gulping his cock down and sucking at the tip.
“Turn, back, turn, towards me. Stupidity, Potter, is the word you’re looking for.”
“There you go.”
It wasn’t. Soon the rain was pounding on the tent.
Malfoy smirked at him, and Harry’s stomach flipped. Oh shit.
He moaned as Malfoy started to suck him off, bouncing his cock off the back of his throat, gulping, sucking, and generally putting Harry’s efforts to shame. And then the toy began to move inside him again. Harry grasped Malfoy’s shoulder. You shouldn’t be able to grin with a cock in your mouth, but Harry was sure Malfoy was managing it somehow. It fucked him slowly, still fairly small, but it felt divine, and it hit just the right place.
“That thing would eat you the second you turned your back on it.”
“Yes! Honestly, Harry. Do you ever pay attention in class?”
Harry gasped as Draco slid a slicked finger insider him.
“I’m watching you,” he said to Draco, then left the room again.
“Yeah, that’s it, Potter, come on…come nice and hard for me.”
“Oh yess....” he cried as Harry’s tight arse finally undid him, he waved his wand as a lazy afterthought.
They stilled for a moment and Draco ran his hand through Harry’s hair.
Harry’s lips twitched.
“Mmm,” Draco grinned and slowly let his weight drop down, groaning as Harry’s thick cock stretched him.
Draco just smirked at him.
Dracos erratic strokes as he came drew Harry’s orgasm out to the edge of his sanity.
He remembered Draco seeing him in the dungeon, turning a blind eye.
Harry did and Draco tied it tight, wrapping it round his neck twice, turning it into a leash.
Harry kicked off his jeans with a little more attitude than Draco would have liked and went on to push down his boxers. Draco walked around him, inspecting him closely. Harry squirmed, both need and embarrassment coursing through him.
Besides, what exactly was he supposed to do if Draco tried anything? And what exactly was he supposed to be trying? Harry knew Ron had his reservations about him being there, but he’d had ample opportunity to kill him already and really, what else could he be doing here that would be more of a threat?
Draco cupped his hand round Harry’s balls and Harry squealed.
“Ah,” he gasped.
“There’s a big step between a school bully and a Death Eater. A murderer.”
He couldn’t stop thinking about the pressure of Malfoy’s body against his own. About the goosebumps that had prickled down his neck as he’s whispered in his ear.
“You’re awfully quiet, Potter.”
“Yeah, sounds like the best idea.”
“I’ve got…something to do. I’ll see you later.”
“Yeah.”
Harry rolled his eyes and drew the curtains on him.
Draco nodded.
“I was more hoping you’d take him to see a teacher, Harry, so you could resolve this without violence?”
“You poor boy. Well. Let’s get you out of those Death Eater clothes, and get some nutrition in you.”
“Kind of want to keep it,” Malfoy mused.
“Expelliarmus! Petrificus Totalus!”
Draco gasped as Potter twisted the plug, moving his hand slowly on Draco’s prick. God. Draco could come like this. Potter’s hands on him, barely doing anything. He could come through bars of the cage, streams of it. He was sure. At least he had the spell to save his embarrassment, as infuriating as it was.
“What do you mean?”
“No, no boyfriend,” Draco said.
“Hello! Is it the Potters?”
Harry nodded reluctantly, wondering if he’d still be conscious if the pain continued for half an hour.
Harry resisted the urge to tell him that he didn’t give a flying fuck about the giants, and that the most beautiful man he thought he’d ever seen was currently slipping through his fingers.
They were in the library several weeks later when Hermione finally admitted defeat, closing shut the last book and emitting a cloud of dust that clung to her eyebrows.
His stomach turned. His heart hummed happily at the feel of Draco’s head on his chest. He kissed Draco’s soft hair. Draco squeezed him back and kissed his chest.
Draco muttered something about unnatural muggle electricity. Harry laughed and walked to the lift.
A groan from the bedroom caught Draco’s attention.
“They’re early,” he mused. “Get down, under there Harry, now, hide. Do as I say!”
Draco was babbling and Harry loved it. He bounced him on his cock a bit more, delighting at his squeals every time he dropped him, then whirled him round and bent him over the couch. He grabbed a bottle of olive oil of the side and poured it generously over Draco’s arse.
Harry was quiet.
“I’ll take my chances. I’d rather not drown.”
Draco reached up, and to Harry’s horror ran his hand through the wet mess on his face and smeared it through his hair. He laughed at the look on Harry’s face.
“Aren’t you going to ask me if I have one?” Harry asked.
“Partner?!”
Draco rolled his eyes.
“I brought you something...” Draco said and Harry instinctively moved back. Usually when he said that he’d brought him something that would hurt in a new and unusual way, and while Harry knew he’d enjoy it, scream and beg him for more, his initial instinct was always to back off.
“Don’t make it complicated, Potter. I can hear you making it complicated in your head.”
He cried out loud as Potter pushed inside him hard, fingernails digging into his hips.
“Sensitive, aren’t we Potter?”
“Oh, are you cooking breakfast Harry?”
He gasped as Draco spread a cold lotion on the soles of his feet, rubbing it in slow circles. Harry’s cock was beginning to twitch. He stared at the ceiling and thought of Umbridge.
Harry relented, pulling his fingers back and slowly pushing himself back inside Draco. Draco groaned, low and long.
He was still suspicious though, as when Malfoy yanked him sideways into a broom closet by his collar his first reaction was still to put his wand to his neck.
“Last night you said there was no way.”
“Absolutely.”
Harry sighed. “I don’t know.”
“Potter, don’t be so pathetic, stand up straight.”
“None of this is fair, Harry. I’m sure Dumbledore isn’t using you. And maybe he isn’t telling you everything, but maybe that’s because we
Draco nodded and walked down the several flights of stairs to the kitchens.
“I think she’s after Neville,” Hermione said.
Harry gasped.
Harry released the grip on Draco’s neck.
“You wanna fuck so bad? Let’s fuck.”
Harry glared harder.
“You would be amazed.”
“Please?”
“Damn, don’t you get any perks being the Minister of Magic?”
“I’ll take you to Maldives and spend the entire time shagging you on a sun lounger under a palm tree and feeding you cocktails.”
“Go for it.”
“I’ve got a disguise enchantment on.”
“God, Potter...you’re still so impossibly tight...so good, Potter...”
“Fuck. “ Draco grinned at Harry, his eyes sparkling. “How longs it been since you got laid, boy wonder?”
“I never knew you were such a cock slut.”
Harry was quite surprised when Draco did get out of bed and stood stark naked in front of him with his hands on his hips.
“Of course you were.”
The noise Draco made as Harry pushed his lips down his cock made Harry shudder.
Draco vanished into thin air.
“Fine. I guess I’ll just have to brew them myself then.”
“But the war...”
Ron pulled a face.
“I assume we won’t be telling Ron about this,” Hermione said quietly as they walked up to the common room.
“Yeah. Alright.”
Thankfully, Major already seemed to have thought of a comprehensive solution to the problem, and just wanted to run it by Harry before he went ahead. Harry gave his assent.
“Fuck. You feel enormous.”
“What makes you think you get the aisle seat?” Draco huffed.
“Sore.”
Lucius just raised an eyebrow at Draco.
Draco walked in shortly after him. Snape didn’t say a word, much to the disgruntled murmurings of the class. Anyone else would have been in detention for a week.
“Hell,” he cursed. It burnt. It burnt like the first time.
It was far too late to run now.
“Maybe he’s got someone in the house to do it. One of the first years.”
“So do you. I can wait till I stretch you enough to get my cock in that tight arse of yours. You’re not going to be able to sit down for days.”
“Ah that’s good. Yes, Potter, love your tight arse.” He slapped him on the thigh and Harry shuddered.
Harry took a deep breath. Spread his legs wide.
He pulled his thumbs apart and Harry writhed beneath him.
Harry groaned. No one had even touched his cock before and now. The heat, the suction, utter bliss.
“That’s so good. Potter. Fuck. Yes.” He gasped as their hips met. “Mmm, “ he shuffled his hips, making sure he was fully seated. “I like that.”
Draco smiled and helped himself to Harry’s shampoo.
Harry shuddered.
“What do you mean, surprisingly?”
Harry flipped and slammed Draco onto his back, his hands round his neck. Draco just smirked at him.
“Mr Malfoy was raised in a Death Eater household, was merely 16 when he was given the Dark Mark. You can’t even get married in most countries at that age. He was, no doubt, coerced, given no other option that taking the mark, and carrying out his father’s wishes. He did however, despite all this grooming, not kill Dumbledore when he was tasked with it. Dumbledore knew it, before he died, his last words were: “You’re no killer Draco.” He saved my life in the Malfoy Manor, pretending not to rescue me and allowing me to escape. Draco Malfoy has been given the Dark Mark, and yes, he was coerced and bullied as many were into aiding the Death Eaters and failed to fight against them. But he has never killed, kidnapped or tortured anyone – wizard, muggleborn or muggle. He does not deserve a life time in Azkaban.”
“I don’t usually…”
“Turn around. Put your hands on the door.”
“Hi!” Harry called, heading for the kitchen rather quickly, trying to make it apparent that he was happy for them to have some time alone whilst he got himself a drink. He flicked on the kitchen light and smiled as he looked around, finding that everything looked much the same as when he’d left it. The other Weasley’s had gone back to the Burrow for Christmas but since Harry and Hermione were away Ron had offered to stay there for them.
“Its nice! Promise! I’ve enchanted it just for you.”
“You just need to treat her better.”
Draco snapped his hips down fast and Harry gasped. Draco smirked rode him faster, the smile on his face widening as he got himself off. Harry’s body ached from tensing. So ready to spill over.
Draco squirmed, tightening his hands on the bars of the cage. Desperate for Potter’s touch. Anywhere.
“Do you know what you’re doing, Potter? Don’t do me any more damage.”
Draco ignored him.
Harry grinned and held his hips hard.
Draco’s invisible lips touched briefly on his own.
“Oh, Potter.”
He put his hands to Malfoy’s hips, moving him faster still, groaning as he did.
“Yeah? You like it?”
“Mmm.”
Harry didn’t need telling twice, he rocked and pumped his cock till he was sure he’d have come a hundred times, if it wasn’t for that damn spell.
“Yeah, yeah, fuck, Potter. I’m gonna cum in your arse, you want it?”
“Yes, fuck yes, make me come.”
He thought he might finally be released as he Potter pulled his fingers back.
She threw a brown liquid over Draco’s arm and Draco howled. She muttered a spell over his arm and the wound stopped spurting so enthusiastically.
Harry smirked to himself but refrained from further comment.
He leant down and kissed Draco’s neck, letting his body weight drop onto Draco, pinning him down on the table.
Draco laughed.
Harry picked up the towel to clean himself up.
“Ridiculous! There must be another way. The Horcruxes.”
“How about the sofa?”
“Harry.” She said eventually. Without judgement. Without anger.
“I’d let you. My answer is still the fucking same. Now, would you please step aside? I’d love to hex you to kingdom come, but father is rather keen that I complete my education, and I wouldn’t want to get expelled.”
Draco kissed his neck up to his ear and took his earlobe between his teeth.
“Desperate little thing, aren’t you?” Potter muttered in his ear. “Is it true they put spells on all you subs so you can’t come until a dom lets you?”
“I feel so angry. I... I feel angry that I’ll only get to kill Lucius once. It’s awful. I know it is. But its all I can think of.”
Draco grinned.
Draco sighed out and tipped his head back on the metal.
Draco was pumping his own cock now, his eyes shut and his mouth open as he moved back and forth against Harry’s hand.
“You’re so fucking stupid, Potter...” Draco laughed in his ear. “Don’t get me wrong now, you’re gorgeous and you’re amazing in bed...but you are so stupid.”
“Why?” Malfoy had wrapped his arms round his waist.
Harry cringed.
Draco kissed his neck, running his hands down his sides.
Harry wanted to scream for Draco not to go, to stay with him. They could protect him but...
Harry demolished the rest of the stew and dumplings in minutes. Hangovers always made him ravenous, and he hadn’t dared to try and have any breakfast when he first woke up in case he brought it all back up again.
“Maybe you are useful to have as a partner, boy wonder.”
“You feel. Insane.” Harry managed.
Harry mewled in protest, so close to the edge, so unwilling for this to be over. Draco kissed his side, light, butterfly kisses, and Harry shuddered.
“Oh my god. You look so good with my dick in you.”
Draco’s cheeks were flushed and he a sheen of sweat on his forehead.
He wondered if that was just what it was like to be a Slytherin.
Malfoy pulled his head back.
Harry opened his eyes to see Draco glaring at him.
They turned to go. There was a scrabbling from the floor as Lucius broke through the spell and grabbed hold of Draco’s ankle. Draco tripped and Lucius grabbed Draco’s wand. Pointed it to his neck.
“So?”
Draco surprised him by grabbing him by the back of his hair and pulling him down and kissing him. He kissed slower than Harry expected, deep sensual kisses that sent aftershocks of Harry’s orgasm shaking back through him.
Harry groaned but tried to do as he was told, sweat beading on his forehead and his chest as he flung himself back and forth, dragging Draco’s cock over his prostate.
It pushed back at the spot.
Harry rolled his eyes. As his heart rate slowed and his breathing settled he realised he felt clear headed for the first time in weeks.
“Yes! Hell yes that feels good.”
“Just a potion. One of my own actually.”
“Boohoo. Can’t be easy being powerful.”
Harry groaned and tangled his hand in Draco’s hair, pushing his head back down. For once Draco let him. Harry wondered if he actually felt bad about their fight and abandoning him after class.
Harry closed his eyes.
“Oh yeah.”
Harry lay down on the cold stone. Draco crawled on top of him, and he needed to be inside him more than he’d ever needed anything in his life.
“Some of us are going out for a few more drinks, Minister, if you fancy it?”
Moody cast a wary eye over Draco.
“Teenage romance is hard.”
“Mmm, Potter, that is impressive.”
“If you’ve quite finished feeling me up.”
Draco looked at him to see if he had any intention of moving. Harry did not. Draco nodded approvingly and relaxed back against the side of the bath.
Draco beamed at him.
“People will see you!”
“Clear,” he whispered and they crept around the chair. “You lead. You know the mansion. Get us out of here as quick as you can.”
“Loves Release.”
“It makes your hair sparkle?” Harry repeated.
Dumbledore wasn’t surprised to see him. Harry had a feeling Dumbledore had a map of his own. The door opened before he had chance to speak the password.
Draco grabbed his arse and rocked him back and forth. The friction nearly made Harry come all over his thigh.
Harry didn’t know where to start with the barrage of questions so instead lay silent as Draco poured the warm oil on his back and started rubbing it into his muscles. He stifled a groan. Draco was good at this.
“You hopeless romantic. Get on your back.”
“Me? Potter, do you honestly think I have nothing better to do?”
Draco laughed loud at this.
“It’s torture.”
This seemed to spur Draco on, and he moved his head faster. Harry’s legs shook with the effort of keeping him upright.
Harry just moaned louder, hoping that would be enough for Malfoy as he writhed on the sheets, curling his knees up to his chest.
He made himself a cup of tea and sat down at the table, but frowned as he heard a banging noise coming from what appeared to be the cellar. Helook around, sure that he must be hearing things. He decided that Ron must have put something down there...some cursed object that was bouncing off the walls, no doubt. He sighed as he heard the banging becoming more insistent and reluctantly put his cup of tea back on the table, walking over to the trapdoor leading to the cellar.
Harry’s mouth dropped open and Draco laughed at his expression.
Harry groaned but did as he was told, already missing Draco’s dick inside him. Draco ran his hands up the back of Harry’s thighs and Harry shivered. He wanted Draco inside him, right now, pounding him into the bed frame. Harry cock throbbed heavy in between his legs.
Harry blinked but nodded. He rode Draco’s cock hard, already close due to that stupid spell.
“Of course you do.”
“Are you crazy?” Harry laughed. “I’d be sacked.”
“God, he’s a good catch isn’t he?”
Malfoys eyes were glinting with delight.
Hermione ignored him. “How long?”
He tried looking down, at Draco’s abs tensing under his shirt, as he sucked, trying to avoid the reality of who’s cock he was sucking. But he wanted to look. He wanted to see the expression on Draco’s face. He needed to please him. Needed to know what he liked best. To burn the image of him with his lips parted, flushed and panting into his brain forever.
“Not yet sweetheart.”
“Want some of that Potter?” Draco said in his ear.
Draco laughed and pulled out his diary.
“Don’t give me that, Potter, your parents weren’t poor.”
“But we’re right here!” Harry insisted.
“Yes, there’s two of you, wandless. We don’t know who or what they have in there. You will not approach. I’ll send a team in in the morning.”
“Come in. Draco’s half dressed though.”
They were quiet for a moment.
“No, you don’t. I haven’t told you the whole story. Professor. I… we’ve. Become very close.”
“Sleep well?”
“Shit. We’ve got to go in there,” he was already half dressed.
“I want, like this I want…”
Draco smiled and looked back down at his paperwork.
“How did they find out about this place?” Hermione took back over the questioning as Harry seemed reluctant to continue.
“No. I don’t know.”
“Let’s get some light in here. Hang on, get off a sec.”
Harry nearly choked with laughter.
Harry rested his head against Draco’s shoulder, unable to keep it up any longer. Draco’s moved his hand slowly over Harry’s cock and slid his thumb over the head.
Draco chose the moment Harry realised this to reach in between them and wrap his hand round his cock. Harry cried out loud.
“Anything you can tell me you can tell Ron, surely!”
“We are,” Draco agreed.
“You’re just so...” Draco dripped something cold and slippery over his arse.
Draco conjured pink frothy shampoo but winced when he went to put it on his head.
Draco smirked.
“Lord I hope not.” Draco laughed. “I much prefer men dark and handsome.”
Draco slowly coaxed open Harry’s lips. Harry let him, let him ravage his mouth and bite his lip between his teeth, let him grind his hips down against his. He’d never been this hard. Ever. He was clinging desperately to Draco’s arse, the only thing he really had to hold onto, but all it did was push Draco’s crotch into his own, sending the sensations out of control. Draco rocked his hips and Harry had to stop him.
“Yeah...
Was he really going to do this?
“I know your suspicions about Mr Malfoy,” Dumbledore said in a tired voice.
He was instantly hard, though he’d been halfway there anyway
“Me too.”
Harry didn’t bother to try and deny it. He was fairly sure Draco knew everything from his sleeping to his bathroom habits. There’s no way he’d be able to sneak a boyfriend past him.
Malfoy raised himself up and pushed the tip of Harry’s cock into his arse. Harry gritted his teeth and tried not to grab Malfoy’s hips and pull him down hard onto his cock like he was dying too.
Harry did as he was told, feeling himself thrown hard against the invisible wall again at the feel of Draco’s arse stretching around his fingers.
“I haven’t told him anything, Hermione, I swear.”
“You think they’re real?” Her expression was pure horror.
Draco smiled wider.
“He says it’s not fair that we’re given these tasks. That we’re just kids. He thinks Dumbledore…he thinks he’s using me. Not telling me everything.”
“Is he alright?”
Draco grinned and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
Draco just laughed, far too sexily for Harry’s liking.
“Do you need me to accompany you, Minister?” Draco asked.
“Will you take me home after and fuck me into next week?”
“Yeah.”
“’s out of order’ he said without looking up.
This at least made Harry’s hands move, he’d done it once before when Harry had done something particularly bad, though he couldn’t remember what. It had been single most painful and pleasurable experience in his life and he had no desire to repeat it.
“Ticklish?”
“Hungry?” Draco asked.
“Are you okay, Potter?”
“Roast lamb, I was going to get you the venison but I thought you might find it a bit distasteful.”
“Oh, wait stop.”
Harry didn’t dare to ask why the one he’d just got didn’t count as a proper fucking. He looked around nervously.
He held Draco down tight by his neck as he kissed him, pumping their cocks together with his other hand.
Draco flicked his wand and wards sprung up around them.
“You need to be very careful Harry.”
“Yeah? You like that?”
“Thank you,” he said awkwardly.
“Yes, Potter, yes, gonna come inside your tight little arsehole.”
just kids. I’m sure he has his reasons. Don’t you trust him?”
“Well you’re nowhere near ready for that yet.”
“I give great foot rubs.”
Moody nodded curtly.
“Minister? Did you break your only-one-drink-at-parties rule?”
“Harry, why has he got your dressing gown on? Looks more like your bloody boyfriend than your prisoner...” he muttered.
He felt Draco’s cock get even harder against his thigh.
Harry shuddered and took a few gulps of water from the glass on his nightstand. He stared at the scarlet bed hangings and concentrated on the gold trim. He counted the strands of thread he could see. One, two, three, four. He forced the image of Malfoy out of his head with golden fibres. He looked in between his legs and gritted his teeth at the sight of his sheets tenting in front of him.
Draco grinned beneath him.
“You don’t know?” Draco rolled his eyes. “I’ve fancied you since I started getting erections, Saint Potter,” Draco whispered in his ear.
Harry spluttered.
“I want your dick in my mouth.”
Draco was leafing through the case file.
Draco dragged his teeth down Harry neck and reached to stroke Harry’s cock. Harry whimpered at the teasing light touch. The toy began to move with Draco’s strokes, slow and growing deeper as the toy grew inside him.
Harry pushed his fingers hard at the place he thought Draco meant.
Harry stood on jelly legs and followed Draco down the corridor to one of the treatment rooms.
He felt the tip of Draco’s hot cock on his arse, slick with lube. Harry’s breath caught in his throat.
“That’s it, baby, let me stretch you nice and wide for my cock.”
He grabbed a handful and Harry’s eyes went wide.
“I don’t think I’m ready for another round just yet.”
Hermione frowned. “I don’t think we have much choice. He can stay here, but not locked in the damn basement.” She glared at Ron. “One of us will have to stay with him at all times, though.”
“I should be going actually. I don’t want Snape snooping around after me,” Draco said.
The music stopped and Harry pulled away.
“Bloody cowardly thing to do...” Ron muttered.
Hermione pulled a face.
Draco’s lips twitched.
Draco accio-ed a towel from the bathroom, one of the fluffy ones that had been there when Harry had moved in. Harry couldn’t help the slight moan that escaped his lips.
Harry groaned. This would be the point. If this was all a joke and someone was going to come out with a camera, it would be now.
“Minister? A word?” It was one of his deputies. Major. He clearly had not been drinking, and had a serious look, one that Draco immediately clocked.
“Mmm,” Draco moaned “That’s good.”
“Have a seat.”
Harry walked away.
Harry groaned as Draco came in his mouth, yanking at Harry’s hair and cursing to hell and back. Draco pumped Harry’s cock hard, the toy began to swell further and Harry desperately grasped at Draco’s shoulders as it began to fuck him.
Potter ran his thumbs in between Draco’s arse cheeks and Draco groaned as he held them apart. He yelped as Potter buried his face in between them, licking and sucking at sensitive skin.
“It’ll leave a nasty scar, but it’ll heal. You’ll be fine, dear.”
“Enough! I don’t care if you are the Great Harry Potter or you’re the noble redeemed Death Eater Draco Malfoy. You will be civil to each other. Or you will
Draco followed him into the lift.
“If he doesn’t go completely off the deep end and kill us all himself.”
“Apart from snake charming?” Malfoy winked and Harry rolled his eyes at the crude joke.
He did as he was told.
“If you even fancy me like this. I feel like a skinny rat.”
He pushed open the door to the spa and walked in. The wind chime above the door jingled at him. Melancholy banshee ballads played from the stereo in the corner and several customers were lying back in recliners having their nails done.
“I’m considering it.”
“My god, you cook for yourself?”
“Yes,” Harry said, too relieved they had found the right place to correct him.
The sobbing came to a gasping stop and Harry realised he was alone with Malfoy in the bathroom. Malfoy whirled round and glared at him.
Harry shook his head.
“That’s really good,” he said.
“Yeah you like that baby? Do you like it nice and big inside you? Like my cocks gonna be?”
“You. Are a bloody nightmare.”
“You are fucking delicious.”
“No, Potter, come on, tell me how it feels...”
Draco took Harry’s hard cock and pushed himself down on it.
“Dumbledore should do it his fucking self then.”
“Oh.” Harry’s body went slack, surrendering to Draco’s incredible invasions.
Draco pulled back with a pop of his lips and stood back up. He kissed him again and Harry kissed him back eagerly, groaning as he felt Draco stroking their hard cocks together.
Draco did not look as well presented under the harsher lights of his office. Harry gave him a small smile.
“Is that a rolling pin?” He asked.
Harry smiled.
“Hello?” Harry called.
Harry nodded. Draco’s hair was ruffled, Harry was willing to bet he’d got up from his bed to make his way here.
“But you had another bed to go to.”
“Survive your Malfoy encounter?” Ron asked.
He closed his eyes to avoid his glaring eyes in the mirror and washed all traces of Draco off his skin.
One of the Aurors put his hand on Harry’s shoulder.
“I think I am drowning in you.”
“Potter, you could pour Veritaserum down my throat and I would give you the same answer.”
“Come on, Potter, I promise. It’ll be our little secret.”
“Jesus Christ, Malfoy, you’ve got a filthy mouth.”
“Thanks.” He took a mouthful. “This is delicious.”
Draco squealed, not expecting it.
Draco nodded silently and let Harry help him up the stairs.
“Kingsley!” Arthur came over to them. “Have a little sensitivity. He’s just a boy.”
Tonks winced. She’d been playing the part of Bellatrix.
“They’re pissed because the Ministry are restricting what they can take back and forth over the border.”
Potter whirled him round again onto his knees.
Surely it was not normal to be attracted to someone who sulked this much. It reminded him of his main objective.
“Twat. I bet he can play rugby too.”
“Okay. Don’t approach. We don’t know what they’ve got in there. Come back with the photos tomorrow. We’ll take it from there.”
“I don’t fucking know! God knows what he’s up to, maybe it’s what Voldemort asked him to do?”
Malfoy handed them to him and held out his wrists, smiling at him slightly.
“Maybe I’ll just take away the waterproofing above your head and you can get wet.”
“Make yourself at home why don’t you.”
“Yeah? What happened to her?”
“Why?”
“There are other ways of doing it, if you’re not fussy about your spells. You cast a silencing charm, right?”
The train ground to a halt. It was 4pm and Harry’s stomach grumbled.
“Tell me what you want?”
“More.”
He lit his wand and looked around. He was alone behind his curtains.
“Morning.” He forced a smile. “Thanks.”
“Don’t be so bloody ridiculous, how stupid do you think I am? That you’d come waltzing in here without a wand? That you somehow lit that chandelier without a wand? Jackson, search him.”
“What’s Malfoy plotting now?”
“Don’t set your hopes too high, Harry, you know there’s lots of combinations we’ll have to try.”
“You really do the washing up yourself, Potter?”
“Where’s that?”
Draco had a terrifying poker face. Harry had spent the entire night with his face buried in his pillow in humiliation at what he’d let Draco do to him. Facing the facts that there was no love potion. No reason for the heat the coursed through his veins whenever he saw Malfoy. Whenever he bloody breathed. Yet when Harry walked into the great hall Malfoy let his cool gaze slide over him and onto the next person without even a twitch of his lips.
Draco yanked Harry’s head to the side and ran his teeth down Harry’s neck. Harry thought he might ruin in his pants.
“Wait.” He dragged his eyes up and down him, biting his lips. “Fuck me boy wonder you don’t disappoint.”
“Yeah. Fuck yeah Potter do whatever you fucking like with me.”
Harry didn’t reply. Draco finished folding his clothes, zipped up his suitcase and walked back over to him.
The man grinned.
“Yeah? You like that idea?”
Harry clutched the headboard.
“Stop brooding in there, Potter, I’m getting cold!”
Harry cried out as it began to lengthen and widen inside him.
He knelt in front of Draco. The toy persisted inside him, pushing at all the right angles, buzzing in infuriating rhythms and still slightly stretching.
Dance classes with the Slytherins were never going to go well. It had been Neville’s fault, suggesting to one of the teachers that if the Yule Ball had been good for relations between the three schools, surely it could be good for strengthening relationships between the houses at ‘this challenging time’. Even the teachers knew Neville was just desperate to get his dancing shoes on again but they’d agreed anyway.
“Jesus. Yes. Turn over.” He groaned as Draco got onto his hands and knees before him.
Harry pulled a face at him.
A tear slid down Harry’s cheek. Hermione kept a tight hold on his hand. Ron stood tall next to him. His army waited beside him. How he had ever thought he could win this war on his own, Harry had no idea.
Harry gasped and came in his hand.
“Sorry about him,” Molly said.
“What’s going on?” Harry whispered.
“Finger me.”
“Yeah? How do you want it?”
“Cage. It’s…” Draco fiddled with the focus on the binoculars. “I think that’s a phoenix.”
“Apparently.”
Draco grinned.
“It’s not funny, Hermione! He’s a Death Eater!”
“Well, Potter. Aren’t you a sight?”
Last time pointed out that he could just do wandless to one of the seniors they had shushed him down and told him to keep quiet about it, especially with the rest of the squad. Harry hammered the peg into the cold hard soil.
Harry slid in next to Draco, grateful tears forming in his eyes that Draco was alive, that he’d managed to extract him safely. This was all he had thought and dreamed about since Draco had apparated away with his mother all those months ago.
Draco’s hand dropped. Harry relaxed. Too soon.
Harry pulled back again.
“I don’t charge, if that’s what you’re thinking. You’ve just got some time left on your treatment and I would really love a go on that.”
“Stop whining” he muttered under his breath and the congealed blood fell away. He flicked his wand and the skin started to knit itself back together.
Something seemed to be changing in him though, he never let himself think about Malfoy at school, never let him fantasise about him fucking him. He thought he was just so angry about the ugly truth of exactly how he felt about Malfoy, and how much of traitor he really felt it made him. It was Draco’s fault, couldn’t he just have stayed out of his life? He was really much happier without him.
He looked at the clock: lunch was in half an hour. There was barely time to panic. To decide whether or not to go. His stomach churned. His cock hardened at the thought of being in a room alone with Malfoy again, let alone any of the things he wanted to do to him. It was probably a trap. A mockery. Blaise had probably been peering over Malfoy’s shoulder when he wrote it. Well Harry hoped they had a bloody good laugh about it too. He gritted his teeth. His blood churned. He stared at the passage they were meant to be reading and didn’t read a word.
“Go!” Moody yelled.
He woke up feeling particularly warm and comfortable in his bed, until he realised quite why he was so comfortable. Draco had wrapped himself around him whilst he was asleep and was now quite happily fast asleep on his shoulder, his arms locked tight around his waist and his legs intertwined with his. Harry inwardly groaned, this was really the last thing he needed.
“There’s always a choice,” Harry scoffed.
He was sure he could keep a line between them in his head. The war. Malfoy. Hermione was right, what would Voldemort be thinking entrusting his plans to a 16 year old boy? And what could he be up to, that Dumbledore wouldn’t know about?
“How?!” Harry found himself blurting again. “We’re only 17!”
Harry still felt giddy from his orgasm and willed his heart to slow down.
Draco pulled off Harry’s boots. Harry felt oddly exposed, and also paranoid about when he last washed his socks.
“Are we just going to leave it empty?” Harry frowned.
“Are you sure about staying?”
“Come on now, Potter, you’re actually my prisoner now, just like you always dreamed in your sick little fantasies. They were my sick little fantasies too, of course, but...” Malfoy trailed off, grinning, clearly delighted that it had all worked out so well. He picked Harry up easily, apparently the spell made him weightless too, and carried him upstairs.
“Potter! What are you doing?”
Harry let Draco lead him around the room. Let him spin him back and forth. Harry reveled in being close to Draco again. It had been two days. It felt like months. Maybe Hermione was right.
Draco took the Death Eater’s wand cautiously.
“Maybe I’m trying to inspire you.”
Draco groaned in his ear.
Draco coughed and Harry watched as Draco proceeded to bring up a liquid that looked very much like a Veritaserum and spit it into the sink. He sighed as he realised that they were back to square one, that Draco could have been lying the entire time.
Harry closed his eyes.
“Aren’t you pleased to see me?”
It stung, it burnt, but fuck, it was delicious. He pushed his arse back against Draco’s hand and gasped again.
He pushed. Draco was slick, hot, and tight.
“You trying to make me beg or something?”
“I will.”
“I want you to fuck me. I want your dick in me. Please.”
“You speechless?”
“Fucking...”
Harry lay face down in the bedsheets, trying not to writhe against his mattress. It felt like before. When he was convinced Draco had drugged him. It had been three days. Harry couldn’t cope. He screwed his hands up in the sheets. It was always Draco that found him. How the hell was he supposed to propose a meeting and beg for forgiveness. It wasn’t like he could just send him on owl. He wondered what extra lessons the Slytherins got that made them all so savvy to sending secret messages like the one Draco had sent him before. He wouldn’t have the slightest idea where to start.
“Did you just pull that out your throat?”
“Where do they get off, sending us to do their work and fight their battles for them?”
Draco shrugged and cast a simple lumos.
Draco went to touch it but Harry slapped his wrist.
“Good for you too huh?”
“Well you’d better just stand behind me then.”
Draco put his fingers on the glass and gritted his teeth. Wanting nothing more than to go in there and throw boy wonder over the bed and fuck him till the house shook. He took a sip of his coffee.
Draco smirked at him.
“Yeah, yeah.”
Harry could barely breathe. Every time Draco moved it felt like he would come, but he couldn’t. He had never been so glad. Harry knuckles were white as he clutched the plastic coated mattress.
Harry felt his stomach somersault.
“Gillyweed preservation.”
Potter kept his hand in between Draco’s shoulder blades, holding him down on the stool as he fucked him. Potter fucked him fast, his hand coming down on his arse every now and again, catching him off guard.
“Well, you’ve already told me you loved me, I guess there isn’t that much more to say.”
“I want all of it.” Harry heard himself slur and cringed. Willing himself to sober up. He never wanted to forget this. Not ever.
Draco rubbed his feet and Harry nearly bit down on the couch.
“Are you going to miss me terribly, Potter?” Draco sighed dramatically as he walked over the closet and started to carefully fold some of his clothes into a bag he’d pulled out from under the bed.
Harry took out his wand and went to put it to Draco’s arm but Draco yanked it back and pulled down his sleeve.
She stared at him for a long time.
“Lie on your back.” Draco put his hands on his shoulders.
Every word felt like a slap round the face. Draco glared at Harry as he failed to reply.
“My delicious boy who lived.”
“No.” Harry sighed.
“For fucks sake.” Harry closed his eyes.
“Mmm. It smells like you.”
“I want... “ it came out as a hoarse whisper.
“Shut up, Potter. Don’t ruin it.”
“Draco.” Major nodded to him, apparently not at all surprised to see him there.
“Yeah, so you going to get on with it Potter or what?”
“No,” Harry blurted and groaned at himself. “I mean I…” Harry stumbled. He could not think with Draco’s hand on his dick.
“Mmm, suck it for me, Potter.”
“No, thank you. I think I’ve had a few too many already.”
“You can’t do this!”
“Did you take it?”
“What?”
“No one else?” Draco asked, though he was grinning and Harry stroked and sucked on his cock. He knew he answer.
“Mmm much better, Potter.”
Draco ignored Granger’s shrieking as she burst into the room.
Only then Harry noticed the rain thrashing at the window.
Harry sighed. “Fine, come on.”
“Suck me first.”
“Of course.”
He pushed Harry down into the mattress before he even had time to do it himself, pushed back into him and started fucking him hard and ruthless, how he wanted it. Harry was screaming again, Draco imagined the rough sheets on his hard cock weren’t doing his condition any favours.
Harry knelt down and offered Draco his hand. Sensible Harry. Adult Harry.
“Can I take you out for dinner?” Harry blurted. “Or a coffee? A drink? Do you like movies? Have you ever been to a muggle cinema?”
Harry couldn’t cope with Draco’s hands on him, he pushed him back.
“Fuck.”
“We’ll have to,” Hermione sighed, “we can’t risk it.”
Draco snorted.
“No,” Harry said, “it’s probably best if we don’t tell them.”
Harry’s breath caught in his chest, until he realised he was very much in the wrong position.
“Let me look.”
“I got to say Potter, I really didn’t think you had it in you.”
“Harry! Be careful!” Ron shouted down the stairs, before running down to join him at the bottom.
“There we go.”
“It is.”
“Well let’s hope she knew what she was doing.”
“I really, really will.”
“Faster?”
“Just with Dumbledore,” he whispered, trying to look serious.
“Yeah your right. We had better get on with it.”
“Yeah. Oh god. Fuck. Yes.” He was trembling underneath Draco.
“Uh…”
Harry stood up and something clattered by his feet. He jumped and stumbled back.
“You like that?”
Draco reached his hand out to tap his wand on the table. Harry felt an odd tingling sensation at the bottom of his cock.
Harry sighed and did as he was told, letting Draco massage the cream into his hair. Draco whispered something and Harry felt his scalp tingle.
Harry tried to resist the urge to strangle him and turned back to the door. It opened and he tried to act surprised to see the pair of them walk into the room, still in their pyjamas.
“And I’m the soppy twat?”
“I can’t face the stairs.”
“But you... You don’t have to hide. You were cleared.”
He squealed into Draco’s mouth as he pushed two slick fingers inside him.
“What’s rugby?”
Harry was alarmed at the suggestion.
“What do you want me to say?”
“What? Nothing!”
“You’re gonna make me come, stop!” Harry babbled.
Chapter 4
“I definitely haven’t got the energy to fight off a Death Eater army now.”
“Better?” Harry purred behind him.
“Go on, Draco.”
He held his breath as to what Draco’s response would be.
“Is it meant to hurt?”
“You are just…”
“I’ve got you in 11am. Have a seat, I’ll let Sam know you’re here.”
“They’d be much appreciated.”
Ron banged on the side of one of Harry’s bed posts.
The court was quiet.
They both went for the file at the same time but Harry was faster. Malfoy glowered at him.
“Brief?”
“Harder Potter fucksake don’t stop!”
“Open your mouth...”
“Spread you legs and fuck yourself, I’m going to watch and see if your inept hands have learnt any better...”
“Yes, damn it.”
“You mean you don’t think I just came here for a shag?”
“Sounds dangerous.”
“Faster.”
Draco just sat down and gave him a small patronising smile, as if he was following Harry’s orders purely out of politeness. Implying that if he wanted to, he could break out of his chains at any time. Harry was fairly sure that he could, which was why he was particularly suspicious of what he was really doing there.
“Oh, morning.”
He moved his hands down and opened his legs, pushing a finger inside himself. Draco came and sat opposite him on the bed, watching the pained look of mortification on Harry’s face that he was really doing this, and worse, that someone was watching.
Harry pulled back but Malfoy had a hard grip on his cloak.
Harry tried to breathe. To do something sensible.
Harry would have been concerned about putting Ron in danger but they were fairly sure that none of the Death Eaters, or anyone who wasn’t in the Order for that matter, had any idea about their hideout or it’s whereabouts.
“What time?”
“I love you.” It was out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop it. To his great relief Draco didn’t so much as tense.
There was more scandalised whispering from audience and Draco himself looked like he was about to tell Harry to go and fuck himself. But he kept his mouth shut, behaved, and kept his formal, silent pose.
Harry just looked up at him with the biggest eyes he could muster, hoping Draco would take some pity on him and let him be for a moment. As it was Draco just smirked at him.
“Beautiful, Potter.”
Draco whispered something under his breath then Harry felt his slick finger push inside him.
Draco smirked at him.
“Oh jesus fuck, Draco, ah!”
“Well you look like a giant dragged you through hell and back,” he chuckled.
Draco pushed on Harry’s shoulders. Harry met Draco’s challenging gaze but gritted his teeth and did as he was told, ignoring his own yearlong aching cock and kneeling down on the bare concrete of the basement. Draco raked his hand through Harry’s hair and guided his head towards his cock. Harry didn’t need the encouragement.
“Should have been faster.”
“You think we should go in there?”
“It almost sounds like you’re not looking forward to it.”
Draco grinned.
“Ah! Fuck. I’m hard.”
She reversed the spell and yanked open the curtains. Harry could do nothing but wince. Draco was lying on the covers.
“So, you have told him things?”
“Fuck you.”
“I brought you some clothes, before I came to fetch you. This wardrobe is yours.” He indicated the right one. He plucked out a green shirt and black trousers and hung them up for him.
Harry expected for the facade to drop as Draco closed the door behind him but it didn’t.
He had a mental block on sensible thoughts. He couldn’t begin to process his sexuality right now. He wanted Malfoy. Malfoy was a Death Eater. He hated Malfoy. This was all he had on the subject.
“I was always jealous of your hair in school.”
“See you in the morning, Potter.”
“I know. I am. I swear it’s just sex.”
“No, no...Draco please no...you can’t...not when you’ll be gone days...”
Draco laughed.
Draco could be walking to his death.
Dumbledore smiled knowingly.
“Jesus wept. As if things weren’t complicated enough.”
“You ignore pains and twinges and carry on working out?”
Draco slapped him on the leg and Harry cried out, coming hard with only a few drops to show for it.
Draco came and sat on the arm chair next to the sofa, handing Harry his coffee.
“You are the worst at lying.”
“Sorry. Don’t want a nasty infection.”
“What?” she whispered. “Why on earth would he do that?”
“Christ Malfoy.” Harry shook his head a Draco’s dirty mouth.
“’Where’s that’ Jesus Christ.”
Draco did and stared up at Potter as he came with a loud shout, his mouth open and his face turned up towards the heavens. Draco welcomed the warm liquid that fell on his face, seeming endless, until Potter finally gasped his breath back, let go of Draco’s hair and looked down on him with a smirk.
“Yessss,” Draco sighed.
“Missed
“You might want to pay attention, Potter, see how an expert rides.”
“Not a skinny ferret?”
Harry laced his hands through Draco’s silver hair, trying not to cling on for dear life.
“Ready, Potter?”
“They’re smuggling magical creatures using muggles under the imperius curse. We think. We’ve got pictures.”
“Make yourself enjoy it, touch where you want it...”
Harry pumped Draco’s cock and groaned as Draco came hard in his hand, swearing and squeezing round his cock, sending aftershocks shudder through Harry’s body.
“Hermione.” Arthur tried to her calm down. “Hasn’t Remus told you what this is all about?”
Draco hissed and Harry was suddenly aware of then dropping the few inches they’d been floating off the floor and his feet touching back down to the ground. Harry looked around quickly but no one seemed to have noticed.
“Close darling?”
Harry shook his head again.
He ignored Draco for the mean time and got into bed.
“Yep that’s it!” Harry nodded and stuffed his phone in his coat pocket.
“Okay, Potter, let’s see what you’ve got…” Draco pumped Harry’s cock hard and fast, his other hand still unrelenting on his neck.
“Are you though?” Draco teased.
Harry pursed his lips.
“Here we go. Get this down you.” Molly handed Draco a glass of dark green liquid.
Harry bit his tongue and heard Draco splutter.
Even given the seriousness of the situation he’d found himself pulled into, winding Granger up still made him feel better.
Draco turned off the shower. He transformed what rags he’d been using as blankets into a towel and dried them both off.
“Don’t talk, Potter.”
He collapsed on the floor, groaning as he went stomach first into the pearlescent sticky liquid.
“Yes,” Harry sighed, trying not to sound like a petulant child.
He looked at Draco in shock.
Harry began to ride him, finding the perfect rhythm, the perfect angle.
Draco moaned in his ear. Long and anguished. The most wonderful thing Harry had ever heard. Draco grabbed Harry’s ear lobe between his ear and pulled. Harry jumped. Every touch from Draco was making him shake, making his cock throb. He’d been wanting this for too long. Sat fantasising at his desk about it for far too many hours. Harry wriggled under Draco’s rocking, desperate to move but far too terrified to do so. Draco’s arse felt hard in his hands.
“They’re threatening to break the borders because we’re tightening security. They say no one is taking them seriously and unless you speak to them personally, they’re going to break the 50-year treaty and smash the border to pieces.”
“I think you can take another finger first, yeah?”
“Fuck me like this.”
The room came back to him, throbbing music, the shrieking, the laughing, the drink. He pushed back up of Malfoy quickly and resumed his place in the circle taking a generous drink of his beer.
“Oh look at that,” Draco said as Harry threw off his boxers and lay back down.
Draco washed his hair and Harry melted back against him, feeling like he might slip down the drain at any moment. They continued their silent shower, dried off, and walked back into the dorm room. Harry was still struggling with the concept of Draco being in the Gryffindor tower, let alone his dorm room. He was about to get dressed when Draco got back on the bed and put his arms out to Harry. Harry gave the door one more nervous look then joined him.
Harry was too out of breath to come up with a proper retort.
“You were obsessed with him before.”
“God your arse, Draco. Fuck!” Potter cried out loud as he pushed harder, deeper, and Draco just took it, moaned, pushed back. “So good. I could fuck you all night.”
“There’s a bit more to it than
Draco took his thumbs out and replaced them with three slick fingers.
Men were apparently just as confusing as he’d always found women.
“I never disagreed with you,” Draco said. “I just chose to ignore you...ah fuck.” He cursed as he stepped too heavily on his ankle.
He pulled Harry’s head round and kissed him lazily. Harry’s brain tipped upside down again.
“Ticklish?”
“A hundred wet teenage dreams,“ Draco mused and brushed his fingers through the dark hair on Harry’s chest. “Let’s see how true to life they were.”’
“Didn’t see. They were four of them there by the time we left. We were lucky.”
“These clothes just won’t do.” He waved his wand and they were gone. To Harry’s surprise Draco walked to his wardrobes instead of towards him.
“Whatever...” Draco was looking round the room distractedly, examining the various magical objects that were stacked on the shelves. Harry jumped as he heard two pairs of footsteps on the stairs.
“What a lovely arse you have. I can’t wait to get better acquainted.” He sunk his teeth into Harry’s left cheek and slapped his other.
Harry closed his eyes, trying to relax and ignore the fact that he’d definitely got a semi.
“Care to make a wager on that?”
“…Nothing. You’re just…”
“It can do a bit while I get these out. I can’t believe you’ve never been to someone before.”
Harry tried not to be too alarmed by the sight of Draco in the Death Eater robes. The other way he had feared he would go during the year where no one knew what had become of Draco Malfoy.
“Oh hell,” Harry gasped.
Adult Harry was apparently trying to reason with him, not learning from young Harry’s lessons.
Harry swallowed and felt bold.
Harry did, kissing Draco hard, groaning as he felt Draco spreading his legs.
Draco lowered his goggles and turned to glare at him.
Draco pulled back, cleaned them up with a flick of his wand then collapsed back on Harry’s chest.
To his indignation Draco just smirked at him.
Draco laughed as the potion began to ware off and Kingsley’s thick accent came back.
“You’re supposed to be relaxing. And I know what you’re thinking.”
“You like your present still?”
“Wanna go check out the prefect’s bathroom? I hear it’s something special.”
Harry shrugged and his stomach rumbled.
“No. I’d have preferred a muggle one.”
“There we go,” Draco soothed, starting to slowly pump Harry’s cock again.
“What do you mean what? Turn over. Its a full body massage not just a back massage, Potter.”
. There Potter.”
“If you’ve quite finished brooding Potter. Turn around and let me put some conditioner in your poor hair.”
Ron made a disbelieving noise but Hermione kicked him under the table. Malfoy’s forced attempts to be nice just made Harry believe him even less.
“That was just.” Harry stared at the ceiling and blinked. “Fuck.”
“And you do a terrifyingly good job at ‘pretending’ to be a sadist.”
Harry gulped and added another finger, groaning at how Draco’s arse tensed around the intrusion then relaxed.
“I see being stuck in a cellar hasn’t done anything for your temperament.”
“Wasn’t a fucking tiger,” Draco muttered under his breath.
“Oh my god,” he desperately clawed around with his hands for something to hold onto but only found Draco’s shoulders. He leant back on the wall and let himself drop into the blissful head of Draco’s mouth.
He grabbed hold of the bed frame to stop himself starting again. It was useless and he knew it. There was a crack and a full roast dinner appeared on the table in the corner with a glass of water. Harry’s stomach rumbled. He supposed there was no point in torturing himself further. He crossed the room in three paces and wolfed it down. Orgasms always made him ravenous. It was absolutely delicious. Probably the best he’d ever tasted next to Molly’s. He guessed they must have a new house elf in. Hermione would be so thrilled.
“What? I like it both ways.” He rocked his hips and grinned. The biggest grin Harry thought he’d ever seen on his face. “Oh yeah. That’s good.”
“Jesus Christ.” Harry jerked away suddenly.
He froze as he saw none other than Draco Malfoy walk through from the treatment rooms wearing a therapist’s uniform. He should bolt. He couldn’t. He was pinned to the chair in horror. Draco didn’t notice him at first and walked to the desk take Harry’s form from the receptionist.
“We’re up here,” Harry called. “Two Death Eaters, that one and one paralysed here. We haven’t found anyone else.”
“I had noticed, Potter.”
“Oh yeah, Molly, can you check the back of his head. I stitched it up but... You’d better check it.”
“Please...please...”
“I’m just trying to give you a chance here.”
“And you. Though I guess I was a less worried about our great hero,” Draco drawled.
“Ready to be fucked? Yes, definitely.”
“Oh that’s a little better.”
“He’d probably just be relieved.”
He put his hand out to Draco’s, his heart thudding in his ears at doing something so bold.
Harry’s respect of Dumbledore won out and he clambered down under the grate. He felt Dumbledore cast the paralysis spell on him and swore. He never should have listened to him. Now he really was helpless as the Death Eaters, and Draco, burst through the door. Draco led, ashen faced, with Bellatrix right behind him, a deranged smile on her face.
Draco didn’t bother to cover up his naked chest.
Harry put his hand on the wall to steady himself. He groaned as Draco wrapped his other hand round Harry’s cock, slowly stroking as he slowly fucked him with his fingers. Draco kissed and nipped at Harrys neck with his teeth.
“Oh shit. They were right,” she said, staring round at the animals.
“Stop whinging Potter. You’ll be thanking me when I’m riding you into oblivion.”
“You said you wanted to get coffee. I’m not letting you operate a coffee machine in that state.”
They sat in silence, staring and the book that lay in between then.
“Oh promises.”
“I’m going to go get a coffee,” he said. “Anyone want one?”
“Mmm, how do I feel Potter? You want to fuck me wide open?”
“Lying is a life skill. I don’t know how you’ve survived this long without it.”
The memory haunted Harry’s dreams now as it always had, but it wasn’t his old friend and headmaster falling to the ground that played on Harry’s mind the most. It was the expression on Draco’s face, torn, anguish, desperate to do what had been assigned to him, to make his family proud…his completely in ability to do so.
“Harry. The pain killers ready,” Hermione called through.
Draco’s lips twitched and he threw a locking spell at the door. He pulled himself up and wandered lazily in the direction of the showers. Harry gave the door another nervous look then followed him into the bathroom.
“Isn’t it?”
She rolled her eyes.
“Do we need protection?”
It brought Harry great relief to see, that Draco, and after a year, had been reluctantly accepted into the ministry. He stood now talking to the other PAs. Harry dreaded to think what they spoke about. Probably the nightmare of trying to organise people like him. A band played in the background. A far more reserved affair than the rock band they’d had at the Yule Ball. The memory made him cringe. At least he’d come a long way from sitting on a bench alone with his best friend.
The thought that Draco might let Harry fuck him made Harry’s mind spin further out of control.
Draco raked a hand through Harry’s hair and tossed Harry’s glasses onto the table. He looked at Harry thoughtfully. Harry kept still, scared if he said the wrong or moved in the wrong way that Draco would run.
“I told you. I know what you’ve done. I don’t know if it was a prank, or something Voldemort told you to do, but I need to know the reversal potion.”
Draco sighed out and turned to face Potter.
Harry shuddered, pulling Draco tight up against him, groaning as his now hard cock pushed against Draco’s thigh.
Harry groaned and Draco’s lips twitched.
Harry managed a few more seconds before he wretched. Draco took his spit dripping fingers and stroked them over his cock. Harry moved his mouth back to Draco’s cock but Draco grabbed the back of his head.
The group stood taller at the sight of him.
“Why are you doing this?”
Harry pulled a face.
“Uhuh.”
“Strip.”
Now Malfoy was pissed, he knew that voice well. Malfoy didn’t shout, he just spoke in a certain voice that told Harry he should be very careful.
“I might be a bit out of practice.”
“I know you don’t have one, Potter, I know what you do every second of your day. I’d know if you were seeing anyone.”
Harry was trying not to shake underneath him. He was harder than he’d ever been in his life and struggling to catch his breath.
“I’m close are you…”
“Those eyes won’t work on me, Potter.”
Harry started to scream as Draco released him. He felt his orgasm washing over him, one last hard stroke and a slap to the arse from Draco and Harry was done, crying out and shaking before he let himself fall down on the bed.
He skimmed it. Harry watched the double take as Draco registered the name on the form. He looked up and stared at Harry. There was no horror there though, his face in a perfect blank mask.
Malfoy ignored him and proved to Harry that he most definitely could, by taking his cock in his mouth. Harry groaned, finding his will power to stop Draco none existent. He closed his eyes, enjoying the bliss for the moment, thinking his life would be much better if every morning started like this one.
“Wouldn’t you rather I got on my knees and sucked you off?” Draco sucked on his neck pointedly. “Do you think I’m good? Have you imagined face fucking me with that righteous hero cock of yours? Do I choke on it? Swallow it down?”
Harry knew Draco was baiting him, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t going to work. Their childhood rivalry stepped in, marching past Harry’s shyness and kissing Draco square on the mouth. Draco grinned.
“A bit.”
Hermione went to pull away and carry on down the corridor. Harry took her arm.
Harry laid him down on the metal table. Molly flicked her wand at the lamp, it burst into light and swung round to shine on Draco’s arm.
“You’re so ungrateful. Come on.” Draco guided his head back into the water.
“I made your eyes water.” He kissed Harry’s temple lightly, brushing away a tear dripping from his eyelash.
Draco chuckled in his ear.
“Are you okay?”
“I won’t bite you, Potter...”
“Okay, you can. Just untie my hands...” Harry was far too cautious about Malfoy and why he’d really come here, to let him keep him restrained like this, as much as he might otherwise like it.
Two hours and five minutes later Harry was curled up in agony on the floor, cold stone tiles pressed up against his face.
“Harry?” She pulled on the curtains then huffed at the spell. Harry was trying to form words to stop what she was obviously about to do next. Draco was completely silent. Bastard.
