“Please, he’s just a boy,” the woman tries again.
Draco looks at Harold. Harold doesn’t have to ask, he can see in Draco’s eyes that it’s okay. That he wants to feel this. Draco is always jealous when Harold tells him about all the times he almost dies at the hands of his parents. And now he will get to experience the same feeling.
“Please, let my boy go. I’ll do whatever you want. Just don’t hurt my boy,” the woman begs.
“I love you too,” he says.
Dumbledore smiles at Harry. “Not if you don’t want to,” he tells him.
“I did,” Harold says. It was strange. He thought he was going to die and he like the thought. To die pleasuring his dad would be so amazing. It will prove how much he loves his dad. But he gets to live another day, and that is even better.
“So beautiful and talented,” the Dark Lord tells Draco. Draco leans against the Dark Lord’s chest and lets his body do all the talking. Potter still fights below him and the sight is beautiful. He struggles and slams his arms against the forest floor over and over again, unable to find anything else to hit against. One day everyone will be this afraid of Draco, one day soon. The Dark Lord is getting cockier by the day. He will make a mistake and Draco will make use of it. Draco will become the new Dark Lord, the one who killed the greatest wizard of this time without a scratch. The one that murdered his godfather without any remorse and the one that turned the Boy Who Lived into a crying shivering mess before he found his end. He deserves to be worshipped more than the Dark Lord.
Harold lets go of Draco’s hand and sits down next to him. Draco reaches for the roses again. He pushes his thump against a thorn until it breaks his skin. Harold knows it’s stupid to try and stop Draco. He will hurt himself for the fun of it. And Dobby will heal his wounds if they get too severe. The elf must be close by, he always is. Harold looks around but doesn’t spot him.
“What are you doing?” Draco whispers. Harold can feel his breath on his lips. His heart hammers in his chest and he wonders if his cheeks are red, like Draco’s are turning right now.
“Why don’t you kiss your dad’s cock,” Bellatrix tells Harold.
Dean knows he has to lie to get her to help Hermione. He hates lying to Ginny. She was once a great girlfriend and an amazing friend after the break-up. And she’s powerful. She will be able to save Hermione. Then at least Dean would have done one last good thing before he goes.
The muscles on Harry’s legs flexed as he moved to spread his thighs as wide as the position allowed. Draco couldn’t see his hole from where he was sitting, only the curve of his arse. But he knew exactly how he tasted there. His mouth watered.
The lights changed again and shined on Draco. Harry’s eyes raked his face, going down to his neck, to his chest, and lower still.
As usual, he had come here with Josh. Harry didn’t normally have any problems with whomever Josh handed him to. Quite the contrary. Inside the club, Josh was in charge of him, he took care of Harry’s pain and pleasure.
He walks over to you and straddles you.
You just stand there breathing, watching his conflicted expression change, reacting to your silence. His eyes go cold.
You pretend to pay attention to what Ron is saying, but he’s drunk anyway, so you give him some excuse about leaving and head for the door.
‘Go on then,’ Draco said, molding his tone to that of a bored Dom even if he was more aroused than he’d ever been in his life. But Harry knew. His tongue flicked at the head of Josh’s cock, then slowly down his shaft. Josh had a nice length and girth, and Harry knew that cock well, for his tongue was intently trailing down a path that had Josh panting and grabbing Harry’s hair in a painful grip.
getting someone else off. For some of them, he didn’t even need instruments or toys, he relied solely on his commanding voice that worked wonders. He felt confident of his power in those moments, quite aware of it, of its threads, of the sheer pull of the right word at the right time. And he loved the gift of submission, he truly did. But only Harry had managed to put him high up there, nearing the stars, and still leave him hanging low on his every breath.
‘That’s what she helped me understand. That all this time I wanted more. From you. With you. So, there’s that. I want a relationship. I would like to date you. Exclusively.’
‘Why so quiet, Malfoy?’ He asks now, lifting himself up.
Because, once you got a really good look at those eyes, well… You were lost.
You’re the type that never gives up. That’s what I don’t tell him.
(See the end of the chapter for
You laugh. Your nose brushes his neck. You inhale.
‘Why did you think it wouldn’t happen again?’ he asked.
‘But it’s the truth,’ Harry said. ‘I want you to be the one taking me home, fucking me on your bed. Or mine. I want to belong to you. Collared, owned, and yours. If you want to.’
You realise he’s finished when he vanishes the stub. He does it with a clever movement of his fingers. The flicker of magic makes the hairs on your arms stand on end.
Harry bit his lip, his eyes going dark with want. He was already under, just like that.
‘Yes, Draco, please.’ Harry looked otherworldly submissive, like something taken from Draco’s dreams.
Harry let his eyes roam freely, now that they could. As he had known, Malfoy was impeccably dressed. He wore a black suit, perfectly tailored to his body, all straight lines and nice cuts and of course it fitted him everywhere. His black shirt was open at the neck, something in between formal and mussed up, like he wanted other people to decide which version of him they wanted. Like an invitation. A provocation of sorts, as everything else in him was. Harry knew which version he liked best. Both. Both of them, this undefined state that was Malfoy, poised, seemingly collected but with spitting fire burning underneath. He looked down, feeling himself blush. He could see the bulge on Malfoy’s trousers, the long defined line of his cock. His mouth watered at the sight.
He opened his eyes briefly, Josh’s face swam into view.
In the end, it’s not a drop from the sky to you. It’s a wave and you feel it coming. He blinks up at you. His lips brush yours.
He chuckles against my hair. We get to his room and he drops me on the bed. I realise just how tired I am. I let him undress me, his hands gentle. I didn’t know how much I wanted him to undress me and not fuck me. It feels too good to be true. He moves away and I open one of my eyes to see him standing there holding a pair of red Gryffindor pyjamas.
You want him. You’ve been wanting him late at night and it must be quite obvious because he’s brought you here.
I can almost touch how much he hates me right now. Probably more than he ever did. Which is funny if you think about our history. Broken noses. Bleeding to death in a bathroom. And now this. It’s hilarious, come to think of it.
It’s the way he moves. I want to know what he thinks as he turns down another bloke with a smile and stalks away. I want to know how he feels like now, as he closes his eyes on the dance floor. He looks blissed out, there’s a softness to him that only shows up when he dances alone. His body is loose, moving to the beat, his hip bones jutting out. Free and careless, like he’s cut off from the past. Like he’s taken it and turned it on its head, made his life anew. I want that with a vengeance.
Enough for Draco to feel like he was at the edge of the abyss, ready to take the fall.
You realise you’re looking for him the minute you spot him.
He really laughs this time. A full, bright, belly laugh. I can’t seem to stop the smile spreading on my lips.
Another man was coming up to Josh. He refused this one too. This time, Josh did not even pretend to be considering the offer. It was as if he was waiting for something else. It didn’t make any sense. They were clearly putting on a show. A show designed for
Draco nodded. He stepped back and used the hand crank on the cross to tilt it back. Harry let his head fall back, breathing deeply, adjusting to the sensation of being nearly horizontal, after hours standing up.
‘Let me spell it out for you. He
I don’t look at him, I keep my hand on the table, I pretend it’s nothing. This is the reaction he wants from me. My inaction speaks volumes to him.
And Potter proved to be the farthest thing from a cup of tea. Better than any drink or recreational potion I’ve ever had. And believe me, I’ve had plenty.
Everything is different now.
In fact, it’s Granger-Parkinson, but I never got around to saying it out loud. Her smile bares a row of perfect white teeth.
Heat rises to my cheeks.
‘Well, you’re doing me. You started doing me almost six months ago. Half a year. You’re probably doing other people too, I know— I saw you leaving with that man and I—’
‘Oh. Do not provoke me.’
‘I don’t think I will.’
I have no script for the kind of talk we’re having.
The moon stands watch to the both of you, alone in the street. In the semi-darkness all your dreams can come true. Even him. You’re so close now, you can see the tiny drops of rain on his nose and on his hair. All the questions you had leave your mind at once.
A slick tongue trailed a path between his shoulders blades. Harry barely kept the moan in, his body arching off the leather. Fuck. Inside his mind, Malfoy was wearing the same smirk that used to crawl under his skin and that now seemed to crawl right down to his core, leaving nothing untouched. Harry lifted his arse as best as he could, offering it up for the crop.
This is our first kiss. His lips on my lips, a barely there touch that makes me burn so very slowly. He doesn’t pull me any closer. I think he’s afraid of scaring me away. Unsure of how I’ll react. I reach for his hands and drive them around me. They settle on the small of my back, mine climb up to his chest.
She’s assuming I’m able to do such things as let him. It’s more like I can’t stop him. Can’t say no to him, which in itself is a problem. Consent & all that shit. I know the drill & didn’t have any problems with the word
I take a step back and try to stop the shake in my hands, the feeling that I’m standing over an edge again and it’s all dark, dark and endless under. I have no idea when I’ll be seeing him again.
So of course one day I wake up, hungover & plastered on my sofa, to find my best friend standing in the middle of my living room, gazing down at me. I blink & try to get up. I only manage to curl awkwardly on the sofa. Again I question my decision of allowing Pansy to Apparate directly into my home. I guess it’s the sort of privilege that comes with the best friends package.
I laugh. I want to make him bleed, that’s what I want.
Harry’s eyes darkened even more, his whole face set with purpose. He crawled over to Josh. The leash was long enough for him to reach the other man’s parted knees, but he’d have to struggle a bit to bend his head forward and suck Josh’s cock.
The words hit their target.
‘Don’t. I’m not going.’
‘Fine,’ I say, as he starts climbing the stairs. All that Auror training clearly pays off. He doesn’t even break a sweat as we reach the first landing. I feel so safe, I even close my eyes.
You are filled with the need to please him. It’s all encompassing. You pull down his pants, freeing his cock. You take it in your hand. It’s a thing of beauty, you think, your hand tight around it. You know it’s going to fit the length of your mouth and throat so perfectly. His thumb brushes your lips. He’s still holding the cigarette, dangerously close to your face. He holds it so that you can take a drag. You do, your lips closing around the same spot his were, just seconds before. You exhale, in a daze. Your mouth forms the shape of an O over the head of his cock. You go down on him, just like that. His hips snap forward instantly, his cock sinking into your mouth. You suck him in the slowest way you can, wanting to feel him getting hard. You love that he’s still smoking, the cigarette on its way to his mouth. His other hand finds your hair. His fingers tighten there. His head drops against the wall. The sight of him, lost like this, the pressure of his cock, his hand in your head — it’s all too good.
It’s the three year anniversary of the end of the War. The annual party is a formal and unavoidable business — as usual, you’re the guest of honour. As usual, you feel like suffocating.
. And you never used that with all the others-’
Harry gave him a sort of smile.
‘Has it crossed your rather intoxicated, self-deprecating mind that he, in his own twisted way, might be feeling the same?’
A vision of my sleepless nights.
‘I don’t get why he’s here.’
We Slytherins are great at this staring thing.
‘Merlin, Harry, aren’t you a sight,’ Josh said as he got up and moved behind Harry, his cock hard and slick from Harry’s mouth. He finally took off his shirt, his chest shining with sweat. His hands trailed down Harry’s back.
‘You heard me.’
You kiss his neck. Then you whisper:
‘Potter… I asked you a question. Answer me.’
‘You will, for me. I know you will take it and take it, until you can’t anymore,’ the look on Draco’s face was vicious and proud, his cock unmoving inside Harry. ‘And then I’m going to make you come all over yourself, and you’ll scream so loud you'll make every fucking cock in this room harder.’
Your hands drop to his arse. He presses closer to you. He gestures to your glasses.
The order had barely left his mouth, and Harry’s dutiful fingers were on the bulge in Draco’s designer trousers. They were hesitant, but just as fast all hesitation was gone. Harry was in no way inexperienced. He knew exactly how to touch Draco, with enough pressure and maddening shyness. He cupped Draco through the fabric. His hand lay there for a moment, unmoving, warm, gentle. Draco felt himself harden under it.
He stares at me. I’m winning with my words, but he’s still winning with his body, his hands pressing down on my wrists. If he moves, all my words will vanish. One little grind of his hips & I’ll be gone. I’m breathing hard, waiting for it. For the moment where he doesn’t say anything, but wins by fucking me so hard everything else is rendered meaningless.
‘I’m sorry, Malfoy,’ his voice was hoarse. He sounded like he’d been fucked already. ‘Yes, I want to be so good for you. Use me, please,’ his dampened forehead dropped against the leather, as he tried to calm down his breathing.
‘You could start by sucking my cock, Draco. I bet you did that a lot during the War.’
Draco smiled.
‘To what do I owe the pleasure?’ I say in my best mock-nice tone. You know, the tone I always use when I am forced to talk to her, which, if you ask me, happens way more often than it should.
He’s so close I can see the veins under his tattoos, green, blue, something in between. I feel him watching me closely.
He laughs. It’s a bright, tight thing, like a tiny burst, soft and vivid and I want to drink it down. My trainer plays distractly with the tip of the cigarette.
I nod,  but don’t notice her leaving.
My nails scratch the stone. There’s only pain and his hard breath, his hands all over me, he’s going to- he’s going to- I elbow him as hard as I can, I don’t even see where it lands. He grunts, releases me for a second, I turn frantically, my hands grabbing the nearest chair. I throw it against him, run for my wand, grab it from the floor, scramble for the door, swing it open.
‘Come at me, Potter.’
‘Is there a point in that story?’ he asks in the calmest of voices, his heart beating so loudly he almost doesn’t get his own words.
He steps away from you. You wonder if you said anything wrong.
Content warning: mentions of an eating disorder; references to rape aftermath.
‘Yeah. Today was… hard.’
But he’s the dream. He’s the dream I didn’t know I was allowed to want.
‘Let me…’ his voice trailed off, his face rapt.
‘I’m up for anything within the rules we discussed the other night,’ Josh said. ‘You know Harry’s hard limits.’
for Draco Malfoy.
Draco had found that out the hard way, the week before. Unfortunately for his sanity, he had taken a very long, thorough,
‘I would wear it at work, under my robes. For you.’ Harry didn’t blush this time. ‘I could be waiting for you at home, only in this.’ His thumb brushed over the tip of Draco’s cock. Harry looked down at it, a hungry look in his eyes. ‘I’d get my hole ready for your cock…’ He looked up again.
my kink
Josh threw Harry chest-down on the bed and he went willingly, lifting his arse up.
Harry looked torn between arousal and disappointment. Draco ignored him. His eyes were on Josh.
Fuck. So, he hadn’t been imagining it. The way Malfoy looked at him when they crossed paths at the Ministry. The way those grey eyes followed him on those random pub nights. The way they were now watching him, a glint in them that Harry wanted to draw all out.
‘Three weeks. It’s been three weeks since—' You feel so fucking stupid saying it out loud. 'I’m — I can’t believe I counted it—’
Draco leant down, their faces so close it would only take a gentle slip of gravity for their lips to brush. If they did, he wouldn’t be able to stop. He needed to keep his head. And make Harry lose his.
- to ear.
Again I think he could at least have gone to the trouble of showering before meeting me. He always smells of sweat. I guess he takes great pride in being a Beater for the Ravenclaw Quidditch team. Too proud to care for the fact that he stinks. He’s tall, all muscle, his hair a light brown, his eyes blue — one of his best assets, if not the best. He’s always surrounded by girls. Unfortunately for them, he prefers dicks. I guess you could say he’s hot, if you like the type. Beaters were never really my thing, but he’ll do for now. At least, he doesn’t seem to have a problem with my last name, which is rare enough these days.
The first boy doesn’t end his life.
And he’d found it, quite literally, naked, bound, hard and kneeling beautifully on the floor.
I lift my hand to trace one of the carvings with my index finger.
It scares you.
But you land on a very different place, a spacious living room of soft white and soft grey.
He always had this way of glaring at me, like it’s impossible to know what he’s thinking. It’s what he’s doing right now, looking at me dead in the eye and I can't stand it. Thank Merlin I smuggled my pack of cigarettes here. I light one wandlessly and the minute I do, I know it’s a mistake.
Harry is standing in the garden, the sun shining on his hair.
The lake expects an offer of bones and breath. Instead it pays testimony to a kiss.
Potter gives him a faint smile.
My hand is shaking badly. I force it to stop, nausea rising up my throat. I take a deep breath. He’s stronger than me. He has my wand. And he also has another substantial advantage in all of this: he’s not a Malfoy. His father is not locked up in Azkaban, with a life sentence. He’s not a traitor. His word will beat mine any day. I know what I have to do.
” Rising from his spot at the table, Draco resumes his languid swaying side to side, padding barefoot across the cool tile under the yellow glow of the kitchen light. The threadbare pajama bottoms he nicked from Harry’s drawer hang awkwardly above his bony ankles and his baggy shirt is unbuttoned to reveal the sharp angles of his collarbones.
Unwilling to take sides, Hermione smiles and says, “Happy Christmas, you two. See you both tomorrow,” before tiptoeing down the dark hall towards the bedroom.
I let him sleep until morning.
All it takes is one look at Malfoy’s stupidly pointy but eerily hypnotizing face to make you throw all caution to the wind, just like old times. There’s always been a deep-seated need to be reckless around Malfoy, and even more now after a decade of watching over your shoulder and flinching at every snapped twig, every bird that looked a little too smart.
Harry rolls his eyes, already irritated at the line of questions. There’s a cruel irony in the fact that he’s been asked them hundreds more times than he even realizes. Draco can’t help his grin when he spots the tell-tale crease between Harry’s eyebrows.
Images smear as though staring out the window of a speeding train. The world stops, and they’re in Draco’s bed. In a mess of tangled limbs and bare skin, Draco hovers over Harry, dots kisses over his cheekbones. Harry groans, and Draco makes one final push, fully engulfed in Harry’s heat, drowning in the feeling of being wanted. That night, Draco said he loved him, though he knew it sooner. He remembers stammering the words as he sobbed into the crook of Harry’s neck, shuddering with the intensity of his release.
Hermione’s gaze is soft as she considers Draco’s confession. She twists her lips once before explaining, “I think it would’ve been strange if you didn’t have those moments. I’m actually impressed it only happened once. The point is that you stayed.”
A howl that isn’t quite a howl.
There are twenty-four steps in the staff stairwell between the second and fourth floor at St. Mungo’s.
“Promise me. Promise me, Draco,” Harry pleads as a tear rolls down his cheek.
“Nothing was ever guaranteed, Potter.”
“Draco?” Harry murmurs, mouth pressed against the pulse point at Draco’s neck.
“I’ve no idea, Potter.”
As exits pass on the motorway and the smell of salt air fills my lungs, I think to ask the questions that I should’ve asked this morning. I was too lost in Draco’s hands, pulled too far under his current, to care.
Draco’s bright hair nearly glows in the moonlight, mussed from sleep. His left arm extends uncomfortably from underneath him, his long, bony fingers curling gently, as though groping for Harry, even as he sleeps.
There are eighteen stepping stones from the paint-stripped front door to the beach. Every afternoon, Draco counts them as he and Harry take their walk along the shoreline.
As Draco leads Harry back to his room, he’s sure to walk along the edge of the fishbowl so he can pocket the vial of Dreamless Sleep that Odette leaves on the countertop for him each night.
“Nothing we can’t handle, hm?”
The water runs red, my back hot from the wash of blood.
“Where else would I even go?” I ask even though I know the answer is nowhere. “To the ends of the earth, remember?”
“But we—”
“Come here, Draco,” he whispers, gesturing for me to step out of the shower. “Come on, babe; I’ve got you.”
Hermione noticeably shifts away from Harry, before suggesting, “If you’re sick, maybe you should go to Madam Pomfrey?”
“Yeah,” Harry breathes, shoulders sagging with his exhale.
“Harry, are you all right?” Draco gasps, breathing heavy.
“Jam on your toast?” Harry asks as he pulls away, even though he already knows the answer.
Harry’s comforting and familiar scent fills his lungs as Draco walks to Tesco’s in search of another piece of treacle tart.
Draco frowns at his nonchalance and releases a frustrated sigh. “Fair enough. So, knowing this, you won’t be too surprised to hear that I’ve been visiting you every day since you’ve been hospitalized.” Draco places his feet on the floor and shifts in his seat, tapping his heel against the leg of the chair.
As Draco leans in to deepen the kiss, Harry abruptly huffs a laugh into Draco’s mouth. Draco pulls back, arching a brow in mock derision. Harry only laughs again before asking, “You know what I just remembered?”
His hand ran over Harry’s hair; it lingered there for some time. Sweet. Harry felt his head spinning. The slightest touch from Malfoy had the power to unhinge him.
Harry looked momentarily confused. His hands reached out for Draco’s. Their fingers twined, warm, slick from saliva and pre-come. Harry let his head fall down on the bed, his hair brushing Draco’s chest, his fingers tightening over Draco’s. Draco gave a curt nod.
‘Do you feel this?’ Malfoy asked, his tone soft.
I did everything you asked me too, and still you fucking broke up with me. I kept away, like you asked.’
It’s not a lifeline, you know. But it’s a possibility.
He glances at me. It’s all right there in his eyes, the thing we never talk about. This thing that’s been happening for almost a year now, this thing that doesn’t have a name, this thing, right here, right now-
I burst the door open and leave him standing there.
‘So if I were to…’ Draco took his hand away from Harry’s face, dropped the leash and his fingers went up Josh’s arm. ‘Touch someone else...’
I’m nervous, but I’m smiling. Now I do it all the time.
HUGE thanks to my two wonderful betas:
‘You’re fucking beautiful… Your arse is begging me for it, isn’t it?’, Malfoy’s hands spread on his arse cheeks, kneading, appreciating what they were touching. Harry felt himself blush and pushed back against those hands.
‘You get to use me here. Then you can...’ he hesitated, searching Draco’s face. Whatever he saw there made him decide.
‘He was one of the Ravenclaw’s Beaters? A seventh year?’ I know he knows exactly who I’m speaking of. ‘Everyone’s talking about it, it’s the biggest news since your breakup with Weasley made the cover of Witch Weekly months ago-’
The hand climbs up an inch; it’s on my leg. It’s warm and assured and still careful, like it doesn’t want to take too much too fast.
His lips twist up in a grimace.
I sit down next to him. Our shoulders bump, but he doesn’t put any distance between us. His leg is shaking, a nervous twitch of his. I resist the urge to put my hand there to quiet him. He seems lost in his thoughts. I think I might know why.
‘Yes, yes, yes,’ he was sobbing, going down, deep, with that voice telling him he wasn’t alone in what he was feeling. Malfoy was there, with him, on the other side of this, high up, pushing him down where he belonged and Harry wanted to be there, to be small, unimportant, to give himself up in Malfoy’s hands, to be nothing but a recipient for pain.
agrees with your “orgasms are overrated” theory,’ Harry said softly and Draco kissed the cheeky smile off his face.
‘He wanted to come over to mine,’ I say conversationally.
Years later, when he tells this story, he says it all started on the day he decided to die.
I want to cry and scream and laugh, all at the same time. I realise there’s no one. There’s no one in his bed. There probably never was, not in all this time. Only me. I don’t even know what that makes me feel, so I keep talking.
Draco wasn’t thinking clearly as he fell to his knees in front of Harry, and then his tongue traced over the come on Harry’s face. Harry gasped, his hands shooting up to grab Draco’s arms, his body melting against Draco and Draco kept at it, licking his jaw, his lips. He held the come inside his mouth and leant closer to Harry, pulling him by the collar. Harry opened his mouth, pliantly. Draco’s lips brushed his and he let his mouth fall open too, his heart beating loud on his throat. The come dripped from his mouth into Harry’s.
Content warning: mentions of suicide/suicidal thoughts.
‘Give me 5 minutes of your time, Draco. No alcohol. No fuckups.’
You’re watching his hands as you say this. They twist on his lap, the silver case falling on the couch. It’s the first time he’s sitting so close to you and you’re not fucking. You don’t even know what to do with your own hands.
Somehow those different times collapse into this one. There’s a tug of fire in my chest, a tug of war in my heart.
‘You should probably call me Harry, you know. Maybe save the Potter for bed-play.
I interrupt him in a rush.
‘Don’t… don’t you want me? I felt you looking… Josh handed me to you…’
And suddenly I remember what’s wrong with this scenario. My shoulders tense. I take my hand away again.
The single word rings in your head like a siren call. You didn’t know what you were expecting, but this was and was
His eyes flicked to Draco’s face.
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
First, it’s only a brush of lips that feels like everything I want. And then his hands climb up my back and he’s on top of me, and my mouth opens for his tongue, and everything slows down. He tastes like sugar inside my mouth. It melts against my tongue. My fingers tangle in his hair. His moan is a breathy, broken thing that feels like a dream.
‘Why am I here, Harry?’
I can’t quite describe the smile he gives me then. I can only say it makes me ache.
There was something incredibly arousing in knowing he was completely naked, bound and blinded and Malfoy was perfectly dressed, he had a crop and he called all the shots for the night.
His fingers closed around the collar Josh handed him. Plain black leather, with a steel O ring in the center, a buckle for the back, and a simple leash with a handle. It was a collar for plays, nothing special about it. Not like the one Draco had at home. He’d bought it years ago, but never used it on anyone. It was made of silver and steel. And it had an emerald green stone at the back. It sat in its beautiful velvety box, waiting. Waiting.
‘Draco?’
Even through the haze on his mind, Harry could sense that there was something Draco wasn’t telling him.
I don’t know precisely when it happened. I can only tell you that the War is behind us, but the ones we lost are always with us. I don’t know if minds heal, but I did try to heal mine. I accepted the help I needed.
Flannagan passes me in a rush of violence. He walks out of the Great Hall. I turn around and follow him out.
. He didn’t want to give him all that. He wanted to refuse, to have a last threshold where Malfoy could not go, since he already had him like this.
Without a word, he drops his coat off on a hanger on the other side of the room. You follow him in a sort of haze and hang yours too. His coat is dark grey, clearly expensive, all straight lines. Yours is an old favourite, light brown and showing way too many signs of use.
I usually leave when I’m one sip away from joining those blokes and try my luck with him. I draw my line there. Just because I have to draw it somewhere. I set the glass down. He watches me leave.
‘Why would you want that? You’re supposed to be at the Weasleys.’
He looks at me.
I’m standing up too.
Even without looking, I can feel his eyes on me.
The moon is colorless but for the trace of it on the lake.
‘Draco.’
‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’ He says.
‘You know… funny thing about this spell…’ his fingers skimmed over the head, teasing the slit. Draco whispered a little word. ‘It can change everything when you least expect it.’
‘I think this is the longest talk we’ve had since…’ I wave my hand.
. Now he’s the one in need of some saving. I go out after him.
‘Don’t think
‘Habit’ he says.
‘And how do you plan on doing that?’ I ask, cold seeping into my voice, my body. ‘You don’t even want to be seen with me.’
Right about now, I’m wondering why the precious Golden Boy didn’t get sorted into Slytherin House, cause he sure hits all the requirements. He knows exactly how to play me.
‘I don’t take them when I’m with you. I don’t need them as badly. But apparently, I need you.’
We’ve been sharing these silent moments. I thought he might be expecting me to thank him. I hate that now I not only owe him my life, but also mother's. He spoke for us at the trials. Father was convicted of course. I knew all along there would be no hope for him. But when it came to me and mother, it was Potter’s speech that turned the sentence around. I don’t even remember what he said, just that he went on and on about turning the other cheek or some sort of noble crap. All I know is that it won them over. Mother and I were formally pardoned, provided we keep funding War reparations and get reintegrated into society — whatever that means. In the end, it’s one more life debt piling up at his feet. I was supposed to be locked up for good. Instead, he decided I won’t be paying my dues.
Harry let out a soft gasp.
He looks at me. There’s an ease in the way he leans in closer. He hasn’t said yes. His lips press closed against mine.
I look up.
Draco’s fingers slipped out of Harry’s mouth and his hand went for the collar, tugging at it sharply. Harry and Josh both groaned in another deep stroke.
He’d had a crush on Potter since forever. He’d taken it and filed it away, tucked in a corner of his mind, only taking it out for the occasional burst of fantasy, or late night wank, or when picking partners for his scenes: dark-haired, muscled men with clear eyes. Fuck. That was not occasional at all, was it? Draco felt his throat go dry and no sound came out.
Harry nodded frantically. He would take what he could have. It would never be enough. He hitched his hips up, Draco driving into him, fast and hard, and the change in angle made everything better and all the more impossible. He bucked against Draco, using his thighs to bring his body closer to Draco’s, his cock dragging against Draco’s clothes. It was a torment, but so worthy, because Draco grunted loud on his ear, and he clenched his jaw. Then Draco lost it, his hips snapped, his mouth climbed up Harry’s throat, biting and kissing and moaning, and Harry felt devoured, his body wrecked, Draco pounding him.
Ministry dinners are the worse. Everyone wants a piece of you. The forced interactions leave you exhausted, but your eyes follow him around, waiting. By the time everyone is done with you, you’re worn thin. That’s when he gives you that look and he leaves discreetly. You don’t take long to follow him.
He notices Potter staring at him.
. I told her that I trust you. That I-’
His body tensed up in the effort to keep his orgasm at bay. He couldn’t come without permission. Wouldn’t.
I don’t notice her leaving. Draco is so close to me all I see is the way his mouth speaks the next word.
‘You can have anyone you want…’ Harry muttered. ‘A man like you…’
Oh he did. He fucking did. Harry glanced at Josh. Draco noticed how he looked Josh straight in the eye, but when he turned back to Draco his eyes kept level with Draco’s crotch. Lovely. So Harry knew who was in charge.
‘What did you say?’
‘What else?’
‘Baby, I loved it…’ Josh said, whispering in his ear, his hand brushing Harry’s hair back. ‘You were so, so good. So beautiful. God, you both were, you had the attention of everyone in this room. I bet next time there’ll be a line of men willing to spank you.’
I hear him grunting behind me, his heavy steps, and I blindly throw a
Truth is it started before.
I feel him smile and then he’s pushing me down against the mattress, and pulling the covers over us. We’re both hard against each other. But we do nothing about it. His breath quiets me down, gently, slowly. His hand drops to my waist. I fall asleep in his arms.
to be caught in the act of looking. He wanted to be found guilty of the crime, wanted those green eyes to look away from Josh and find him there, pinning him to that couch so he was unable to leave.
‘Me and Ginny, we’ve been over for a year.’ He takes a deep breath. I keep my expression impassive. ‘We were still... Sleeping together. But that’s over now. Months ago- before. You know- before we-’
Fucking sweet Merlin. Harry paused, looking unsure.
Every time the kiss ends, it begins anew.
After you came, you took some time to start breathing properly.
He’d gone through the negotiation with Josh entertaining the thought that he could have Harry, knowing in the end Potter would refuse it. But then, something else he hadn’t counted on had happened: Josh had allowed him to break one of his rules.
I should leave now. I could have anyone on that dance floor. And he knows it.
‘I don't know…’ the smirk was unavoidable. ‘Think you can make me come with only that pretty face of yours?’
‘I wish I was nothing.’
But he did make a sound when Draco kissed him.
‘Of course not.’ I say tersely. The mere idea is absurd.
‘Fuck your pretty blonde boys and leave Draco alone.’
I promise myself: I’m not going to see him again.
‘You kiss them, then you fuck them.’
‘Want to get out of here?’
Harry felt so hard, his cock was hurting against the leather of the cross. He wanted to forget everything, that was why he came here every week, why he was into this pain and pleasure game. And Malfoy…
‘I’d wear it all the time for you,’ his voice had a pleading ring to it.
Draco is making some new choices. And a new list :) Tell me what you thought of this one! Thank you for supporting this story.
I hate him touching me.
This is getting ridiculous. Playing the same script every night, but somehow it never gets boring. Rather, it sends my body into a frenzy. I fucking hate it.
Potter looks breathless. Draco has never felt more lost. Of all the things he’s imagined, this isn’t one of them.
‘Do you know it’s been like that since he saw you?’ Josh went on, addressing Draco. ‘What is it... two hours, coming on three?’
I grip his hand and pull him up, my arm around his waist. His whole body leans into mine, scared and willing all at the same time.
Harry could not breathe. Josh was always the one to decide if and when Harry came. He’d broken that rule, but why? Did Malfoy ask for it? Was it Josh’s idea? Harry was terrified. Exhilarated.
We kiss as we walk to the bedroom, clothes scattered on the floor. Draco is so beautiful. He’s under me on the bed, and there’s nothing like the warmth in his eyes. So helpless. So lost. He is in love with me. He’d never let anyone see him like this if he wasn’t.
‘Say it.’
‘I know the new improved you doesn’t give a single fuck about people's feelings. Maybe you're trying to even the scales out, because of that one time you played the fucking martyr, died for everyone and all that noble crap. Very commendable. But Draco's starting to look like collateral damage and that pisses me off.’
‘He’ll wait hours if need be,’ Josh added. ‘He’s a good pet as you know, but he’s been waiting for this all week. Do you really want to put him through it?’
It comes from very far away. Like someone speaking from above a well, when I'm all the way down here, echoes of my name.
What I mean is: don’t fucking break my heart.
He looks blankly at you.
‘Fuck you, Malfoy,’ he snapped, biting the words out, his defiance zinging through Draco in a bloody rush.
He kneeled there for a long time, mouth open - when Josh opened his mouth he wanted it like that until he ordered it closed - waiting, waiting… Josh’s hand tugged on his hair. He pushed Harry to his feet. He went instantly, holding himself up, arms behind his back, his arse burning from the earlier spanking, the pain on his scalp spreading downwards. Josh knew he loved to be dragged around, manhandled. Josh kissed him hard on the mouth.
Years later, you’ll still remember this kiss.
Draco was leaning down and pressing gentle kisses on his forehead, down his nose, cheeks, and neck and Harry’s eyes fluttered shut as he tried not to cry.
I lower my hand. We stare at each other in silence. There’s only the rain, and the yellow light around him. I mean to say something snarky; nothing comes out. The corridor where he stands sways in front of my eyes. I stumble inside and he catches me in his arms. There’s a rush of information short-circuiting my brain all at once. His hand on my hip, warm over my soaked jumper; the scent of strawberries and Firewhisky when my nose comes too close to his neck; his eyes like two pools of questions.
‘Yeah, I don’t get it either. Who wouldn’t want him?’ he chuckled and shook his head. ‘Point is: I’m fine with it. He wants you. We thought you’d make an offer again, but since you didn’t… There’s more to it, but that’s for him to tell you. So… what do you say?’
‘Do you have him hiding upstairs? Afraid of the crazy ex-fuck? Ex-lover? Can’t quite decide on the best term here, any suggestions?’
Harry realised he was supposed to say something, to answer Malfoy, but he couldn’t be reminded of a single word. He was too intensely aware of Malfoy’s body behind him, probably impeccably dressed (he imagined), of his voice, low, whispered on his ear, of his breath with a hint of whiskey in it, of his scent, something like polished wood, musk and something else he couldn’t identify, but which made him dizzy. He was vaguely aware that there were other people in the room, moans and cries reaching his years, the cackle of a flogger cutting through the heavy air. These sounds were generally soothing for him, driving him under, but now he was only dimly aware of them because Malfoy was there.
. If anything, it gave you something to hope for.’
She looks as pained by her own question as I feel.
‘You’re the farthest thing from cheap, Draco.’ He finally says, voice quiet & deep, each word drawn out clearly like a charm.
‘I’m going to indulge you a bit… what do you want Harry?’
‘Potter… It’s Malfoy. Do you still want this?’
‘I didn’t lie my way to killing Voldemort.’ He shrugs. ‘Lying wasn’t really a prerequisite.’
‘Do you like me on my knees for you, Draco?’ he asked, voice cracking.
I don’t dare to look at his face or I won’t be able to tell him everything.
You take a sit on your coffee table, in front of the couch, facing him.
‘You really don't get it do you?’ She asks. ‘Some people, my wife included, believe you have an actual brain.’
‘After my session, I went to this Muggle place. I wanted a change. I thought turquoise would go with my eyes. The hairdresser said it made the grey pop.’
Draco crosses his arms. That he could be part of anything Potter plans is quite beyond him. He awaits for whatever madness overtook Potter to be over, so he can go home.
I have to admire his attempt at nonchalance. He completely fails at it, but the fact that he tries is endearing.
‘Merlin, is that what you think? That I’m ashamed to be seen with you?’
‘Why am I here, Harry?’
‘Have me on your bed,’ Harry went on. ‘Or mine, anywhere you want.’
The kiss is small, but the lake, and the trees, and the leaves, and the dust, and the stars, and the moon, and the night bugs know it’s anything but.
The something that was twisting inside Harry stuttered at this, wanting to break free, to make itself visible. He wasn’t a sub at that moment, he was just Harry. He knew then that Draco wanted this as much as he did. He was about to be fucked by Draco Malfoy, and he did not see any of this coming, not in a million years.
He finally stands up. I have an inch on him, give or take. I never noticed this before, but I do now because he’s so close, leaning even closer. Seemingly realising the same thing,  he tilts his head up slightly & his lips brush my cheek. My breath catches. The shiver starts there, on the point of contact & runs me down. He is warm & too real.
Josh was coming up to Harry, only then pausing the flogging. Harry’s pain threshold and his physical resistance were, by far, the best Draco had ever witnessed on a submissive. Josh was lifting Harry’s face up, his hands tugging on the dark hair strands harshly, but Draco saw his pleased smile, noticed the way his other hand touched Harry’s cheek, gentle. The lights were treading on the beads of sweat crawling down Harry’s neck. Draco so wanted to drag his nails there, to watch the skin turn red. Then he wanted to lick those marks up Harry’s neck, and bite him, on that spot of skin close to his ear, until he’d draw blood and one of those delicious, helpless whimpers.
He was lost. The whole club was gone and they were alone. Just like that, Malfoy had driven him under. Harry was an experienced sub, he’d been with lots of different Doms. But those Doms didn’t ask him so bluntly what he wanted. They surely didn’t call him
‘Is it true?’ he asked.
You cross your arms, keep your mouth shut and wait as his eyes travel from the pictures hanging on your walls, to the bundled up blanket on your sofa. You know your house is messy, but it’s comfortable and it’s yours. You’re filled quite suddenly with a burning feeling. Let him judge you. Let him judge you and you’ll finally know what he thinks of you. Why
‘Do you remember your safeword?’
‘I know you’re not fucking anyone else either, Draco. I’ve known it since the first time. And it definitely isn’t for lack of options. Which means… you’ve been throwing them down.’
‘So you
This second bit is actually true. But I read it. I also have a copy of the issue safely hidden away in my trunk. I will obviously deny this until the end of my life.
‘Show me how good you take it, Harry…’ Draco said, ignoring his own cock, and the spell and everything in favour of this desperate feeling of want and want and want.
There was a pause like a heartbeat.
The cigarette drops from my hand. The tip shines brightly on the floor.
He owled me 3 days ago. I was about to
Harry whimpered and looked up at Draco.
The blow came fast and sharp. Harry did not have the time to take in the change in sensation. He gasped. Malfoy’s hands were lighter than Josh’s, but completely unpredictable, the long fingers trailing over the burning skin of his arse, then kneading, then crashing over his skin. Heat spread over his arse, sweat trickled down his back. Malfoy’s hands fitted over his arse like they were meant to be there, like they belonged... Stupid thought. He was Malfoy’s just for one night.
I shiver when his fingers unexpectedly brush against my cheek, catching a stubborn strand of my hair. He tucks it behind my ear, all sweet & too close. Yet, he says nothing at all.
. Draco broke the kiss, panting, looking suddenly lost.
I can’t stand it, I am unable to stand this look on his face, like he’s about to say something he won’t be able to take back. He’s about to drive us both over some line we’ve silently decided never to cross. I can’t let him. Can’t follow him beyond that line. His breath catches, he’s about to say it. I shut him up by kissing him desperately. It’s inevitable, the way my lips fall open, the way his eyes fall closed & everything he was going to say dissolves into my mouth. I allow myself the kiss I always wanted to give to him. Wide open, filled with a terrible, shameful need that I would never show to anyone else, something reserved only for him, taken from years & years of impossible yearning, maddening regret. I want him to take me & he does take. He takes everything, he tears me apart, his tongue fucking my mouth, his cock sliding against mine, his fingernails scratching over my back, finding purchase there. I am aching & open, pulling him in, my whole face wet with tears. We’re covered in sweat, both grunting & tearing each other apart. He grips my arse, rolls us both so that I’m standing on top of him.

‘Not many options other than Famous Harry Potter, slayer of Dark Lords and international Quidditch star? Yes, I see you were really scraping the barrel there, Draco.’
get off with someone today, it's been rather a while, hasn't it?'
'If you bite that lip any harder, darling, you're going to break the skin,' Pansy said, amused. 'How long's it
Draco woke, mouth dry and head thumping. The light streaming into his room was far too bright, so he pushed his head under the pillows and curled up closer to the unusual warmth at the other side of the bed, groaning pitifully.
,' he murmured.
,' Draco panted, as the tip of a tongue circled wetly around his hipbone.
Halfway to Nott Manor, while deciding Theo's carriage could do with a much better Extension Charm and trying to shift further away from the slick sounds coming from Millie and Greg in the back, Draco was hit by a moment of clarity.
~*~*~
Daphne frowned, blonde brows narrowing as she smoothed imaginary wrinkles from her pink bridesmaid’s dress. ‘Come on, Draco. You
The door to number fourteen opened with a creak and Potter's green eyes peered out. He grinned, when he saw Draco was alone, opening the door a little wider.
'Theo!' Luna called. 'Can you stop for a minute? Draco needs to get out.'
The door beside the reception desk-cum-bar opened again as Draco waited for their drinks and a man Draco vaguely recognised staggered through, his Paisley waistcoat loose over the belly straining against his shirt.
Draco waved a hand airily. 'Well, it's no surprise you're in need of educating when it comes to
'I, er, I
Sorted Slytherin.

Draco perked up a little. ‘I think I saw them heading to the cloakroom. Why don’t you go and fetch them, Blaise, while I find Pans?’
,' Blaise said, bracingly, neatly snatching Draco’s wand from his clenched fist before Theo could catch a hex to the face. ‘
It was as if the words unleashed something tucked in deep. Harry arched his back, Josh’s hands coming up to hold him, back against chest. Harry moaned then, raw and careless. His eyes dropped to Draco’s crotch and only then did Draco realise his hands had moved there, he was touching himself, unaware.
Outlaws of Love - Adam Lambert
‘She thinks you like me too. And then I thought… she’s always right, isn’t she? ‘Cause she’s quite sure of it.’
Harry nodded feverishly, his delicious broken whimpers making Draco feel higher than a fucking kite. The idea of making Harry spill like this, without even touching him, was nearly perfect. But not enough.
Josh was slipping out of him and coming around the bed to caress Harry’s cheek. He pressed a kiss on Harry’s forehead.
‘Just a little spell I learned… You’ll be good now, won’t you
There was inexplicable tenderness in his voice, and it tugged at Draco’s chest.
Naked and silent.
He waited for Malfoy’s mock laugh at his stupid infatuation. But Malfoy wasn’t laughing. If anything, he looked mesmerized. He hadn’t been expecting this. His eyes were a deeper shade of grey. His smirk was turning into something else, a slow smile, one Harry had never seen on him and had no idea what it meant. He was even more beautiful like this.
‘I was too busy,’ he said. ‘Besides, the whole thing is overrated.’
I send his wand flying, which is a first. The thrill of it drills hot in my blood. I don’t expect him to smile, but that is exactly what he does. I struggle to speak, my head ringing.
‘Will you? Will we?...’
‘Poor slut. Maybe I can help you... Do you mind a little of my magic on you?’
Malfoy’s voice came drifting over his dizzying mind.
Malfoy was cupping his face again, his scent strong and intoxicating, the full meaning of his words beyond Harry’s grasp.
This time the negotiation seemed to take longer. He became aware of the other man moving closer to him, and speaking to Josh in a low tone.  He felt increasingly curious, wondering what the man might be asking for, feeling his eyes on him through the black blindfold. He couldn’t get any of the words, though. Only his scent. It was maddening, even from a distance. It made Harry’s mouth water.
‘The first one is too sad and way too simple. Doesn’t fit,’ my hand falls on his knee.
He looks nervous, suddenly unsure, and that’s why he can’t stop talking. He thinks he needs to convince me of this. Like I would ever say no.
Draco understands the words, he really does. Knows what they mean. They just don’t make sense.
Then you feel the pull of magic and you both swirl away.
You’re shaking, trying to hold yourself up without touching him. He laughs. It’s a short, breathy thing, so unexpected. You want to listen to it again.
I never had Summers to plan. It was the Dursleys and then it was the War. I don’t know what a normal Summer even looks like.
I take some time to get the full meaning of his words. I don’t even notice the jumper falling to the floor again.
Josh pulled Harry up, the muscles on his legs shifting with the movement. Draco remembered those legs wrapped tightly around him. There was a path of dark, soft hair on his thighs. He also remembered touching Harry there. It had felt strangely intimate. He usually touched his subs with instruments. He’d surprised himself when his hands had gone for Harry’s thighs like that, with no other intent than teasing. Even if he didn’t know in the end who exactly was being teased. Potter never had made things simple for him.
He’s right. It’s only wood. The heel of his boot could easily crush it. Or his Beater’s hands. He could snap it in half without breaking a sweat. I still remember the ache of being deprived of my wand during the War. The idea of it being permanent… it’s as if I’m splitting apart. I realise what this means.
He looked at Draco, the grey eyes were so close. There was something welling up in them, some emotion.
Belatedly, you wonder if
He knows he’s being followed. He turns around, not at all surprised by the hand on his arm. His voice is a far away thing, he doesn’t know what he says but is aware it might be the truth this time.
‘I want you,’ he whispered.
I want and want with a hunger that rips my stomach, cuts through me and yanks me to the surface. I stand trembling on the edge of this feeling, his laugh ringing in my ears, his arms around me, his whole body warm and wanting. My fingers reach for his hair, tangle in there lightly.
Pans always comes with me. For her it’s not about the dance. Her coping mechanism is shagging. A different woman every night. Tonight it’s probably the cute girl with curly hair dancing so close to her there’s barely a hair’s breadth of space between them. Pans looks happy; she too changed a lot in a few months.
‘I said no fucking with blood or drinking involved.’
It feels good to admit it. The words travel the length of your body, shaking you.
That smile that took his breath away was back on Harry’s lips.
After every party you die.
When that yes had come out of the fucking blue and stayed unequivocal all through his strict questioning, Draco had felt thrown to the abyss. He had been so ready for a refusal. That precise feeling - of being so close to have what he wished for and having it yanked away, at the very last minute, by the man who had plagued his dreams and his life - that was what he was taking home with him that night. Or so he had thought.
His voice tugs at your chest. It’s the most personal thing he’s ever told you. For a while, you think he’s going to leave it at that.
‘God, that’s hot,’ Josh said and he had Harry on his hands and knees again, yanking his head up in place, so that Harry’s eyes were level with Draco’s cock. ‘He’s so fucking crazy about you, his hole is sucking me in.’
‘I’m leaving.’ Is what I tell him.
I feel about him? I don’t know what I feel. It’s something I never felt before.
After a while, I feel a warming spell washing over us. I stop shivering as his magic makes a kind of bubble for us, as his hand caresses my back. I lift my head up to look at him. And I can’t believe the sight of his eyes. They’re wet. His lips form a thin line. His jaw is tense. I can feel anger seeping through him, it’s almost something I can touch. He hates that I’m hurt. He hates what was done to me, he hates it so deeply. And still he holds me, he doesn’t let go.
Dear readers, please check the end notes for content warning (please do, this is heavy). This chapter was my absolute favourite to write. I hope it becomes yours too.
All the exhaustion you’ve been feeling settles on your shoulders. You decide on the spot that if he comes closer and tries to take off your clothes, you’re going to tell him to piss off and then you’re probably also gonna tell him everything else.
I can see in his face that he really believes what he’s saying. He believes I whored my way into the Death Eater ranks and then out of the War. It’s what he was expecting of me all this time.
‘Sometimes…’
Harry’s jaw went slack, his mouth taking him in deep, his throat accommodating, eyes closing in bliss.
He doesn’t answer, just turns me around, slants me against him, my back to his chest.
They stared at each other very seriously and then Harry burst out laughing.
Draco loved this shyness of his. It showed up as easily as it broke and turned to total shamelessness.
‘I was at a bar,’ I say. ‘Pansy made me.’
‘I was kinda hoping to be busy tonight, so…’ Potter looks expectantly at him.
He turned towards the sound of Draco’s voice.
‘Dance with me,’ I say.
Of course my first impulse was to blatantly ignore him. I had been doing that a lot and that plan was going just fine. By fine I mean I was about to lose what was left of my fucking mind. But his owl was quite stubborn (figures), staring hard at me while I scribbled all kinds of notes in answer, ending up with a piece of parchment that read only:
‘That's an original one,’ I say. ‘Come over and check my... books.’
They stared at each other silently.
He lifted his arse as high as he could, meeting the cane midway, pain ripping him apart until he was all heat and cries. It filled him up, made him reach farther and farther inside him, wanting desperately to be a perfect little slut for Malfoy.
You don’t think about what it all implies. You don’t think at all when his fingers close on your wrist. His hand is warm. It takes you by surprise.
He extends a cigarette, in a sort of greeting. You take it, your fingers brush. He lights the tip with wandless magic. The shiver begins in the pit of your stomach and spreads everywhere in your body. You’re starting to accept things you can’t control.
‘Get a therapist if you want advice, Potter. This is a threat. I will make the rest of your life a living hell. Leave Draco alone.’
Harry did not even nod, he seemed unable to, his lips simply parting open in a rush of breath.
Let me tell you how it starts.
He looks at me expectantly. I realise he’s probably thought about this ages ago and was just waiting for the right moment to ask me.
He wasn’t ready for the vision of Draco Malfoy down on his knees in front of him. He’d never be, but instead his words were:
‘Fuck me,’ he repeated, watching the bulge on Draco’s trousers. Malfoy shifted, adjusting his trousers just so. The cane twisted again on his nipple. Harry screamed.
This is real. And he’s sure it can’t be true. He gives a wry smile. It hurts his face.
Potter just laughs. The skin around his eyes crinkles with it.
‘Of course he did. He has nothing to hide.’
You won’t believe it
‘You can’t be into me,’ he says.
The green eyes drifted from his face to his crotch and then up again.
‘No. We’re not casual.’ I agree.
‘I really like it.’ I repeat. But in reality, I can’t believe he’s my boyfriend and he looks like this. Even if I’d dreamed him, it wouldn’t be this good.
‘Of course she does. What’s it to me?’
It’s all too much. The fixed smiles, the thousand handshakes, the formal attire, the glasses of fancy champagne, the too bright lights, the names of all of the fallen, which you repeat year after year in your speech, the memories, always the memories, the eager faces of the crowd looking up at you and you wondering: what are they looking at? It never ceases to make you sick to your stomach.
You can’t bring yourself to whisper Lumos. You stare at the darker shape of him. Standing there, in your room.
His hands slip over your thighs and you don’t need anything else. Already his arms are coming around your waist and you’re climbing on top of him.
Then, one night, you end up telling Ron about it and it surprises you that he already knows — and not because Hermione told him.
For a moment, Harry looked utterly lost. He opened his mouth, but the words died there. Draco leaned back against the couch, aware of how he looked with his back straight, his expensive shirt and designer trousers, the silver snake cuffs shining on his wrists, the contrast of the black clothing against his pale skin, the smirk on his face, his perfectly shaved jaw. He wanted Harry to see him exactly like this. Poised, controlled, fucking aroused.
‘He gets like that when he's impatient for cock,’ Josh said.
The cigarette drops to the floor. He looks up at me. I forget every fucking thing I meant to say. His eyes drift to my lips. I wonder if he likes my new piercing.
‘You know… he came up to us on the first day back. He actually apologized. For the bullying and for the things he did when he joined the Death Eaters. He said he was sorry about everything. He really meant it.’
Harry bit his lip hard when the next blow hit his back. Then, there came another, and another in quick succession. Josh fell into a practiced rhythm, hitting Harry’s back with steady strokes of the flogger, sending him reeling against the leather. Harry’s mouth was open in a scream that made no sound. It coursed through Draco still, burning a trail of fire under his skin.
She eyes me intently. For a moment, she kinda looks like Hermione. Seeing things I’m not. Apparently, marriage does that to people. She sits down again, looking exasperated.
‘Fuck me, but don’t fuck with me.’ I whisper.
They both laugh. I laugh too, my chest collapsing with the force of it. My hand falls over his. It stays there. Our fingers twine together. Parkinson smiles.
I run the tip of my finger over his wet lips. He’s trembling, his magic going haywire. He looks at me like I’m a dream.
‘What are you planning on doing this Summer?’
Up this close I notice that his eyes are still the same.
‘There are better ways to go, you know?’ I say, like I’m ready to show him one or two myself.
I almost expect him to deny, to evade the question. But what really strikes me is that he doesn’t.
I look up at the stretch of sky. A drop of water falls on my face. I haven’t felt rain on my skin since the War. We stand in the rain, and I will it to wash away my ghosts.
I sip my tea just to have something to do with my hands. When I set the cup on the saucer it clinks brightly between us.
Draco’s hands curled to fists, his hips lifting from the couch. He forced his voice to appear calm.
I love to hear what you thought/felt. Thank you for reading :)
‘So… monogamy?’ My eyebrows rise. I’m still smiling, though, and seemingly unable to stop. ‘Your fans will be deeply disappointed. Not to mention the press-’
The cigarette falls from his fingers, the bright tip shining on the way down to the floor. I watch his hands for signs of wandless magic, but there’s nothing there. His whole body tenses like a bow and then he drops his arms down, all the tension instantly gone from him. He tilts his head back. His lips part. He closes his eyes.
After a trip to the Hospital Wing, we’re assigned detention. Two whole weeks of it, after classes, which means I actually
For the first time in his life, Draco did not know what his face was showing, but it must have been quite obvious because Josh made an understanding sound.
Even as you say it, you realise how much it hurts you. For a while, there’s only silence and the clock on your wall ticking down the seconds. He’s looking at an empty spot on the wall when he answers.
‘You know what my take on PDA is, Potter.’ I say in my usual drawl.
‘I fucking want it,’ Harry said, and closed his eyes as Josh pressed deeper inside him, hitting that perfect spot quite suddenly. Harry fought to breathe, his cock hard and leaking.
He actually smirks at me and it sends a jolt to my nervous system. And other places too.
Most nights, you end up in his apartment. He has you on his couch, your back to his chest; once against the front door, in a frantic, uncontrolled fuck, in which you beg him to make you come; and that one time in his kitchen, your hands scrambling for purchase on the expensive marble of his counter, as he ate you out at his leisure. There were tears in your eyes as you came, biting on your own hand to keep from screaming.
It’s a downright lie. I’m the cheapest when it comes to him. In fact, I’m easy. Other blokes might chase me for weeks before I say yes to something more than a blow job. Andrew chased me for months, until I agreed to a date.
He follows you that night. Your steps on the stairs. His steps on the stairs. One year and one night and you never spoke to him. One year and one night and he never spoke to you.
A split second hesitation. Another shudder. This helpless defiance was everything.
I walk past the bloke still waiting for him. He does look like a two years younger version of me. Too innocent. The poor thing slants me a very satisfied look. He thinks he’s won. I’d pity him. But that would mean I think myself better than him, which I don’t. At least he has an excuse. He doesn’t know Potter like I do.
Harry walked him backwards towards the bed, divesting him of clothes. Draco stopped trying to make sense of any of it. He’d never let any of his submissives undress him, much less take him to bed. He knew he was going to let Harry do all that and more.
. Draco waited a beat, before he finally turned back to face Josh.
And in that pause, in that space where he says nothing at all, I hear it. Everything he’s not saying for fear of scaring me away. And it probably would, so I’m glad he doesn’t say it.
I quickly find out that he has nightmares too. Both about the War and about that awful night. The reason I know the difference is that when it’s about that night he wakes up screaming, drenched in sweat and he locks himself up in the bathroom. When he comes back, he just lies down next to me, curls up on one side, his arms and legs drawn up, his head bowed forward and then he pulls the covers over us both. He doesn’t say a thing. But his fingers find mine in the dark. I hold them like I’m holding an invisible string of a balloon, something I could lose with a slight rust of wind. It’s a feeling I can’t explain, but so strong it takes over me. When that happens, I can’t quite breathe.
She looks as impressed by this as she did that one time I saved the world. Which is: not in the least.
He opens his eyes, lets out a breath.
He rocks against me, slow, and I get him hard with my mouth, my hands, my fingers. He gets me hard with his body, his moans. I whimper when he turns us over, and I’m face down on the mattress, bucking back against him, his hands on my wrists. I love his hands. My whole body is screaming for him to fuck me, and he’s going to, he’s going to. I cry out when he does. His fingers are inside of me, twisting, curling, and I love them, I love him. I groan with his every movement inside me, and then I don’t stop. I’m crying out his name, Malfoy, Malfoy. Deliberate. I want him to remember it’s me. I’m the only one who calls him by this name in bed.
‘I don’t want to mess anything. Between you two.’
He doesn’t say
‘Stop,’ Draco snapped. His voice came out harsher than he meant to.
Not for the first time, I wonder if he’s real. If I didn’t get to see him in class I’d probably think him a product of my imagination. A consequence of war trauma, as my therapist would say. That is — if I ever mentioned these late night meetings to her. Which I won’t.
Have I mentioned that a bookish Draco makes me happy? Also, Ron and Hermione are here! Tell me what you think :)
‘Someone dropping out this late in the school year… it’s unheard of.’
‘Whatever we’re being.’ He finishes, eyeing me cautiously.
He needed to have Harry or leave. And he couldn’t have him just once more, if he did, he would have to take him home and have him again, until the curling need inside him would think itself appeased, even if he suspected it wouldn’t be, not ever.
Hi, there! So here's another chapter, Harry is dead set on a plan that might be even worse than having to kill Voldemort :D
Gorgeous.
‘Make me shut up. ‘Cause you know you can.’
I have every intention of keeping my mouth shut. He seems intent on the same thing. All he does is watch me and consume those Muggle lethal things.
‘What do you mean?’
A single thought takes over your mind. It’s a long, crazy shot, but you haven’t slept in two days. In for a penny, in for a pound.
His left hand is on the table, white against the tablecloth. Lean fingers, thin, his fingernails tracing invisible patterns on the fabric. My eyes travel with that motion.
I sit on the bed again. I don’t look at him.
Pansy sighs. She drops down on the sofa, reaches for the bottle of Firewhisky. The smell is enough to remind me of him. I wonder why I chose this exact drink to forget him. I watch in silence as my best friend Accioes a clean glass from the kitchen & fills her glass with two neat fingers of whisky. She takes a sip, looking pensieve.
‘Is this fine?’ he asks, his fingers dragging over your back.
Draco opened the bottle of lube and stood between Harry’s parted legs. He slickened his cock, his hand slow, purposeful, his lips parting. How could Malfoy be like this? How could he be the perfect torment and the perfect lover? How could he be everything Harry never even knew he’d wanted?
He sets his drink on the table with a definitive clink. Then he takes your glass and sets it aside too. With your hands empty, you become aware of the fact that there’s nothing standing between you and him.
Now you’re watching the darkness inside your eyelids, thinking this is it. That’s all there is to it. An otherworldly shag.
, the name lacked in creativity, but the place was fucking perfect. Harry was tightly bound to a St. Andrew’s Cross, his wrists and ankles spread and tied to the cross. He was completely naked except for a black blindfold. Standing behind him, barely an inch from his neck, was Draco Malfoy.
‘He had neat hair. And quite an arse,’ I say, remembering the feel of it in my hands when he kissed me. The arse was a nice distraction, since he wasn’t a great kisser. Not when my standard is Harry fucking Potter and his maddening mouth.
Draco released his neck, stepped back.
Draco tried to calm down his own breathing, to shut down the part of him that said all this closeness was dangerous, was too much. He should just wrap-up the scene, should clean Harry up and clothe him. They probably needed to talk. But he didn’t want to, not really.
‘Isn’t that my job?’
‘How do you feel about me?’ He asks me, point blank.
I’d always wondered what he did on Fridays.
. His hex hits the walls of my protective spell.
‘You always kinda seemed to be. An impossible dream.’
Harry tilted his head. That smile would be the death of him. Either that or he’d come because of it, he wasn’t sure which one anymore.
‘Has anyone told you how impossible you are?’
We stay silent. I don’t tell him about my coping mechanisms for those weeks. Maybe one day I will, but not right now. Instead I shift my gaze to his newest scar.
‘They’re not good enough,’ Harry said, and he blushed fiercely.
. I can’t stand it, or his face.
He looks right at me. I can see that he doesn’t give a single fuck. He stopped caring after the War. It shouldn’t be so hot, but it is. Because I’m the exception. All those blokes can throw themselves at his feet. He’ll turn them all down for another taste of me. And he’s had me before. He’s had me plenty.
‘Habit.’
‘Draco.’  I know this look. Set and angry — it’s the same look that won the War in the end. ‘Who did this? Did someone-’
‘Yes, Malfoy,’ it came out more like a moan.
Harry blushed fiercely. The truth was out before he could stop it.
In the semi-darkness, I get dressed. Jeans, sweater, trainers. I never got around to using the proper uniform again, and no one told me off. No one tells me off anymore. I grab my pack of cigarettes from where I’ve hidden it, under a pile of socks in the drawer, tuck my wand in my back pocket and leave silently. I know she’ll sleep through it. ‘Till morning.
I still have nightmares, though. Sometimes they’re even worse than before, like the less I think about it during the day, the more it all comes back to assault me at night. When I wake up he’s there. Sometimes he just helps me to calm my breathing down. Other times he touches me, his hands on my face, like that first night. His hands are warm. All of my spiralling thoughts stop at the sight of his eyes, solemn, on me. And even when I can’t go back to sleep afterwards, I listen to him breathing, feel him there, close enough that my fingers could brush the sleeve of his pyjamas. It’s reassuring in a way I can’t explain. I want to tell Mirna about this, but I don’t know where to start. How can I explain to her that we have all this fucked up history, that he was a bully, that he was horrible to my friends, that he once broke my nose, that I almost bled him to death in a bathroom. That I regret that more than anything else. How can I tell her that I don’t think he had a choice in the War, that he was a pawn, just like me,
The boy’s hair is so blond it’s white. He walks fast, dressed in dark, towards the lake, his grey eyes set on the surface like glass. A slice of a moon in the sky splits the surface in two uneven halves.
Draco felt his mouth go dry, his heart hammering.
Harry paused, cheeks tinged in red.
Potter comes up behind me, body a hard line right at my back. I tense, he exhales, breath warm on my neck. He extends his hand, fingers sliding alongside mine, holding the cigarette, lifting it up to his mouth. I turn in time to watch as his lips close over the place mine were barely a second ago.
He’s still coming when I realise it. I need to end it. Before it’s too late.
He was locked up in my bathroom for nearly two hours. At some point I thought I heard him sobbing, a desperate fragile sound underneath the running water of my shower, but then everything went quiet. Silencing spell, probably.
He should know better.
watching him.’
I swallow the last of my drink, allowing for it to fire down my throat, right as Potter laughs in my ear, light & easy, and signals the bartender with two fingers up. New glasses are set between us.
You don’t know how long you stand there, but when he finally turns to leave without a word, your hands are cold and you finished three more of his cigarettes. There’s a soft trace of vanilla on your tongue.
Draco stares at the hand. Strong, gentle. He can’t move. Potter drops it.
‘Hi,’ he says.
He cleans himself up, tucks himself in. In under a minute, he already looks all prim and proper.
I actually laugh in his face.
‘More than,’ Harry choked out. His throat felt so dry. He couldn’t take this closeness, this conversation that sounded too much like a confession.
‘I want you to tell me to stop if you need to,’ Malfoy said. ‘And I want to know if it hurts when it’s not supposed to,’ he swallowed. He looked gorgeous and unhinged, his hair falling over one of his eyes, his cheeks tinged a soft red. ‘Can you do that for me?’
‘I’m thinking… you deserve a nice treat. For your good behaviour.’
‘I… I don’t strut,’ he said feebly, too aware of Malfoy’s fingers around his cock, their pressure both not enough and just enough to make him desperate for more.
‘I’m going to break you, Harry.’
I might be a cheater, but after the War I learned my lesson: lying corrupts you to your core. I came clean to Andrew. Unsurprisingly, he called me a disgusting bastard + a waste of his precious time. I couldn’t exactly disagree with either of these notions. He took the ring back. I have never seen it or him ever since. Mother was rightfully distraught by the news, but at least I kept my status as a disappointing son (points for coherence?).
I'm at work too. Prick.
Then, you use your tongue. He curses as you take your fill of him. Whatever happens after this, you think wildly, there will be this file lodged in your brain containing things Malfoy likes in bed. How he likes to be fucked. How he tastes. How he takes it so good. It’s a stupid thought, but you feel insanely happy about it. Your tongue sinks into him, he’s incoherent, the taste of him makes your head swim, the bed seems to shift under you, the walls of the room fall away, everything is warm and slippery and he’s pushing against you harder, deeper.
His hand is still on the table. I lift my eyes from it to look at him.
stops breathing.
‘You’re gonna have to be more specific. What do you want from me...
‘I could have anyone.’
‘You want to be mine?’ Draco asked softly.
The order goes through your veins, a rush of adrenaline. Your hands tremble on your trousers but you manage to do it. You hesitate on the hem of your pants.
‘I like it. The hair, the tattoos, the eyeliner. Everything,’ I say.
He inhales, the bright tip of the cigarette pointing upwards. It occurs to you just then that some people turn smoking into an art form. You don’t know much about art, but you get it’s the sort of thing you can lose yourself in. A good book. A good film. Even a museum. The sort of place where you go to forget there’s a wide messy world around you, even as you dive deep into it.
‘I’m not. Impossible. Or a dream.’
‘Wait, Draco.’
‘There’s this girl,’ Parkinson says. Her eyes are bright on us.
for him. He never asks you to stay the night, so you usually leave around 4 am. You fall into your bed and sleep takes over you. You always think it will be the last time, but weeks turn to months. You are at his beck and call and you don’t mind, you just want whatever you can get.
‘Will you shut the fuck up?’ I snap.
‘You’re so fucking gorgeous like this,’ Draco said, his voice more tender than usual, the words coming to him in sudden clarity.
And then he was gone.
But he couldn’t ask, not really.
— your breaths going fast. You want him on a bed, you want —  you struggle on the buttons of his shirt, your hands traveling the length of him. He’s all edges and bite, but he’s also pliant, nearly sweet. He kisses you back and you don’t miss the way it feels so desperate. You palm him through his trousers. His cock fits in your hand so perfectly. His moans are something of a dream to you. Because you dreamt about this. You dreamt of this
Malfoy’s fingers twisted over the tip of his cock. Harry didn’t care for the whine out of his mouth. If the reward for telling the truth was this, he was ready to spill his heart out.
‘Malfoy…’
You take it.
I’m practically snorting with laughter at this point. A line shows up on his forehead. He stands up, his right hand balling into a fist.
Draco sent the glasses back to the table and leaned back on the couch.
I have his full attention now. His chest is heaving, the water boils, my fingers trail over the outline of my cock.
His eyes fall on the mess on the other side of the room. It’s as if a hurricane has passed over that desk. Chair pushed back, piles of paper everywhere, a confusion of parchments, a bottle of ink carelessly open, its content drying up in the air. His partner is like an atmospheric mishap. Nothing stays the same after he leaves. Like most of the Ministry employees he’d left hours ago, carrying a ton of colourful bags with him. Probably to spend Christmas surrounded by the whole array of redheads he calls family. Draco had thrown a Merry Christmas at his back. He doesn’t know if Potter heard him.
In fact, I haven’t kissed anyone since the War ended three months ago. Me and Ginny, we’re over. I don’t think we ever began, really. Everything is fucked up. Reconstruction is underway at Hogwarts, but I never went back, instead I’m here. I drink. I watch Malfoy dance. I drink some more. I watch him kiss a man. Then I watch him ditching the same man. I drink. This is what I’ve been doing with my newfound life with no Dark Lords on the horizon. Drinking my way to… not even Malfoy, really, ‘cause I haven’t said a word to him since the trials. I can’t explain it to Ron or Hermione, since I can’t even explain it to myself. Watching him is the only thing I look forward nowadays.
‘You like it…’
You both feel the pull of Apparition.
Fucking god, he was hungry, so fucking hungry for Malfoy. He wanted Malfoy to snap, to lose all his composure and just take Harry, brutally and completely.
I walk over to him. His pale hair falls on his face and I lift my hand to pull it back behind his ear. Once we touch, we’re unable to stop. His lips are on my palm, kissing me, and the ache spreads everywhere on my body. His hands go up to my hair, I press him against the door, his legs fall open to allow my thigh between them, and he’s the first to moan.
I can’t quite describe the smile he gives me then. I can only say it makes me ache.
He picks up his wand from the desk, puts on his jacket, then his gloves, ready to leave. He has no plans for the night. No one is waiting for him.
Nothing could have stopped Harry from staring - just an order from Draco and he was relieved he’d received no such order. His mouth fell open, as he watched Malfoy’s long fingers take out his cock and wrap around it. It was long, thick and beautiful, the tip wet.
‘You sure?’ she asks, and her eyes drift to me.
He wasn’t wearing his glasses so everything farther than Draco was blurry. There were figures watching them, and some people on the sofas farther back. Josh was one of them. Harry hoped he was enjoying himself, getting off on this. He saw Draco adjusting the straps on his hands again, checking his fingers’ response. Then he turned to the side table and came back with a bottle of lube. The grey eyes were suddenly unguarded.
He nods.
Malfoy’s touch on his skin was light, like a feather, then suddenly so hard, Harry gasped. Malfoy’s hand hit his right arsecheek, sure, hard, decisive. Harry’s body flared up. Malfoy’s hand was replaced by the crop. Harry clenched his teeth and took the pain in. He stopped being aware of anything else, his world narrowing down to Malfoy’s crop on his arse, the leather biting into his skin, fast, slow, then fast again. Every time Malfoy’s crop hit him, his body was sent reeling against the cross and his cock pressed against it. He’d never been so hard in his life, still he made no sound.
Harry lost it. His mouth opened to be taken over by Draco’s tongue and he felt he could die, he had never tasted something like that, the only reason he wasn’t falling in a heap on the floor was because he was impaled on Draco’s cock, his wrists still restrained, his body trapped under Draco’s, because he was on free fall inside that mouth. And Draco tasted like coming home and he didn’t know why. Harry moaned inside Draco’s mouth, lost to the world, panting loud, as Draco’s cock fucked into him and his mouth almost ate him alive.
‘That’s probably unhealthy as fuck.’ He says, finally.
Draco sucked his tongue in. Then Harry heard it. A gentle, desperate little moan. Not his,
This is what I tell myself as I make my way inside the little Muggle coffee shop Harry Potter chose for our first official date. You read that right.
‘You drive me mad,’ he whispered, and it was like a confession, really, meant only for Harry’s ears.
He’s gone. I stop moving, the music loud on my ears, my heart frantic. Pans catches my eye. She calls him my
If that voice had made some damage on his nerves when he couldn’t see Malfoy, now it was even worse. The voice was the perfect companion to that angular face, filled with stark contrasts. The hard lines, the unwavering eyes, that smile that could go so many different ways, that hint of unsureness so neatly hidden behind demanding words.
And suddenly he’s crossing the room in a heartbeat and he’s on me and I can’t react. He punches me on the jaw. The pain is exquisite, more real than anything that went before.
(See the end of the chapter for
They were inside the dungeon of his favorite Muggle BDSM club -
‘Unzip.’
Harry’s lips parted in a muted gasp. His pupils wide, the green in them unavoidable. Draco knew all these miniscule reactions had nothing to do with the flogger, the leather stripes curving, hitting Harry’s back at that precise moment. Even with the force of the impact, those eyes were on him, and only him, wide open and unrelenting.
‘That’s- what?’
Draco was up in the sky and he could take on the world.
He exhaled the smoke and, without looking at you, said: ‘I have an early morning.’
‘I mean with you. I sleep better with you. I feel better the next day. I hate the next night, back at my apartment. When I’m not —’ He stops, fights himself on the next word, but for a while nothing comes out.
Harry’s hands crawled over Josh’s thighs, going for the zipper.
There are spots of white in his vision. Beyond them, Potter smiles at him.
‘Hi,’ I say.
He stopped begging, he stopped wishing he could come, he just let Draco use him, drink him down, tease him beyond desperation. Draco controlled their pace, slow and maddening, his hands caressing Harry’s thighs, then his nails bit into his skin there and the pain mingled with the pleasure, sweetly. Draco was the perfect picture of someone who loved sucking cock and would gladly be at it for hours.
Harry tried to focus his eyes on Draco’s face. Draco knew this was hard to do. To bring someone from the depth of it.
Harry looked up at Josh, and from that angle Draco couldn’t see his expression. Only Josh’s. The Dom gave Harry a slight smile, followed by a curt nod. He then moved to release the restraints on Harry’s wrists. The change allowed Harry to hold himself up on his hands, over the bench, which he did, shaking, the muscles on his arms straining. This way, his cock was clearly visible, resting against the leather in what must be a painful friction. Potter was going to endure the flogging like this, but why would he want that?
The line 'I violently dislike you' is obviously taken from Buffy - she says it to Spike :D hope you enjoyed this one :)
He shrugs.
Harry realised he’d closed his eyes to better take it. He opened them. Draco looked completely wrecked, his hair plastered to his face, eyes dark-grey, sweat trickling on his forehead - he looked more beautiful than ever. Harry felt like he would burst the minute Draco moved inside him.
‘Someone’s been paying attention.’
I’m glad they’re still there.
‘It’s true.’ I add. ‘It’s about the only thing I like these days. And cigarettes.’
‘He sounds like a catch, Draco. Was he nice?’
The lights shifted and caught Draco’s side of the room. And that was when Harry saw him. Just a mere glimpse, but it was enough.
‘Quite persuasive,’ he conceded.
Your hands find the wall behind him. You keep your palms there for balance, relaxing your throat around him. You want him to fuck you and that much must be clear for he gives you a dark look and his hips snap forward with purpose. His hand goes back to your head and keeps you in place as he sinks into you. The feeling is glorious. You think that if he keeps this up, you might come in your pants again, untouched.
He looks down at our joined hands.
I know the name. It’s right there, under my tongue, but it’s so heavy, impossible, I can't say it. I'm shaking. I'm shaking so badly the ground is shattering, the dark is shattering. His face is haunted. Blurred.
Harry jerked at that final word. The spell kept his cock in a tight vice, gripping at his bollocks and making it impossible for him to come.
And then Malfoy was kissing his hole, his tongue licking over the rim of his arse, his hands careful on his skin. Harry thought he was dying. Malfoy’s tongue lapped over his hole, warm. Harry felt him press there, sinking into his arse slowly. He pressed back, wanting more of it, not believing he had Malfoy’s face buried in his arse.
I look up at him, the table between us. He looks devastated, on the other side of the world. There’s some part of me that delights in the fact that I was the one to put that look on his face. He hates the idea of anyone else having me. Problem is: I hate it too.
‘He’s almost ready,’ Josh said, sounding breathless.
He crosses the room. I think he’s about to tell me he’s leaving, but instead he sits on the bed beside me. He stares at his hands. I notice that one of his nails is broken, a trace of dark red blood on the tip of his finger. The bath wasn’t enough to make it go away. No bath is ever going to be enough, I realise.
‘Is that what you tell yourself when you need to go to sleep?’ I ask. ‘That you’re just addicted to fucking with people’s heads?’
‘Good boys always answer
The club is dark, noisy, too crowded & completely gone as he kisses me deep & desperate, backing me up against the counter. I realise, in the pit of my stomach, that I am going to fall for him. That in fact I already am —
. The most powerful intimate thing he’d ever begged for.
‘So you get off on being treated like shit?’ My laugh is something caught between surprise and shock. ‘That’s fucking healthy.’
Careful not to touch Harry in any way, he leaned over and removed the leash.
No one knows this but the night only starts when I see him.
You take him to your bed. He takes off your clothes. You help him out of his.
I bring myself down on him. His orgasm cuts through whatever he was going to say. He is the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen. And he’s not mine, he can never be mine.
White hair, white shirt, rolled up sleeves, a flash of white skin, a cloud of white smoke from the tip of a white cigarette. He could be a ghost, if not for the very real look he gives you, beyond the glass doors that separate the both of you. For a fleeting moment, his eyes are on you. You’re sure that no ghost is this invested in live matters.
‘Come here baby. Let’s take this thing off of you, so you can tell us what you want.’
Please take care of yourselves, be safe if you decide to read. Thank you all for the support and love for this story.
. I pretend to find it stupid, but that’s exactly who he is in my mind. I no longer need saving. But when I did need it, he was
It’s not like Draco hasn’t thought about this before. Well, not this
I pick up my glass, give it a little twirl.
‘And you don’t let people in easily. I don’t know why, but that gets me going like- Fuck. It’s not just sex for me.’
‘I want to see you… Please.’
Malfoy sighed, content.
‘She asked if there was anyone I could talk to. That I could trust.’ I’ve never seen him blushing this hard. But then again my pulse is going wild all of a sudden.
He heard Draco let out a long breath, his hand stilling over his thigh, warm. He forced himself to open his eyes.
‘Fuck my brains out, Harry. Here on this table. Fuck me until I forget neat hair and having good taste.’
The Forest looms right up ahead, distant, close. Every night, as I walk past it, I dream of going there to die. I dream of walking the whole length of it. Of finding what’s beyond it, of never coming back. Instead, I turn left and move along the castle’s walls. Further back, there’s a quiet spot I like. A place where there’s only the night, the stone, the trees. Hidden from sight.
