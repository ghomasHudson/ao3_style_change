“Who’s the first year Gryffindor you keep hurting yourself to save?” Potter asked, turning around to meet Draco's lingering gaze.
“Why does it matter, Potter, where I am and where you are? Don’t you get it? You’ve got a lightning bolt and I’ve got nothing but the—”
The sun caved under, then, falling behind a dark, thick layer of cloud. The first shocks came, one streak of lightning after another. Harry slid down to the floor, his back against his bed as rain pummeled heavily against the window in front of him.
Yet all Harry had ever known, trapped in the loneliest town of Carnation Grove, was that he wanted to hold Malfoy.
This meant much more than a single victory, more than just winning a game of Quidditch, because for the first time since Harry was born, he’d finally have his life to himself. He’d be free to make mistakes, to live, to learn, to be young. To get drunk on a Saturday night while not worrying about his picture being flashed on the front cover of the
Draco nodded his head, hands clasped behind his back, his eyes luminous and sparking with curiosity. “I’m quite talented at Quidditch, Father, and I’ve already started working through the curriculum of Arithmancy. I suspect to be top of the class come September. I’d like to become a Curse-Breaker.”
that Harry could see each thread of silver paint patterns within his irises. They were hypnotising; Harry was on fire.
The image flickered, and another one took its place. As Harry stared at it, enthralled, he felt something swoop in the depths of his stomach. Warm and stabilising, it coursed through him. It felt something like
Harry walked out of the conference room to a chorus of whispers, and a burning desire to throttle Malfoy until the ache in his chest disappeared.
Draco opened his eyes, tears cracking a path down the crevices on his cheeks. “I just wanted to live a normal life, Potter. That’s why I’m here. I thought that if I ran fast enough my past would disappear.”
Burning and caving into each other’s body as if this was the only place Harry belonged, he succumbed to darkness, moving on feeling and intuition alone. But as he discovered the familiarity of Draco’s mouth once more, his vision was alight with bursts of colour that sparked behind his eyelids.
He was left completely shirtless. Nipples out. Right in front of Malfoy, who stood too close and wouldn’t stop staring at him.
Draco had to close his eyes, because this backdrop of night was too similar to how they met that very first time.
The first time it happened, Draco thought he was so far gone there was no point arguing with himself about the logistics of the matter. So that’s why, when he saw Potter walk through the door of the Slytherin dormitory he said “Hello,” instead of “How the fuck are you here?”
they called it. Draco stayed silent. But once, in a fleet of utter desperation when he walked up and down the corridor on the seventh floor, no wooden door was revealed to him. It was fine, Draco told himself. But he never tried that again.
won’t have anything interesting to report about anymore, and then I can finally live my life like a normal adult. Doing
Harry leaned in, whispering in Malfoy’s ear. “This is what you wanted, isn’t it? For it to be only us. You and me. Harry and
“I can’t imagine you as the belly laughing sort. I feel you’d be more subdued to draw less attention to yourself. Am I right, Potter?”
When the lake lapped at the window of his dormitory, morning sun slipping through the deep blue, Draco wiped the sleep out of his tired eyes and reached underneath his pillow, cold fingers meeting smooth leather.
When he closed his eyes and the world was silent. When his thoughts would reel like an old film stuck on repeat. A flash of bottle-green eyes, a flicker of two candle flames alighting a midnight sky of ashy stars.
Malfoy waved his hand around. “Particulars,” he said. “Point being: Pot sucks cock.” Harry clenched his fists by his side, trying to stop himself from grinding his teeth. Malfoy only pursed his lips. “Right. A tasteless joke. My apologies.”
The Ministry conference room was spacious in a claustrophobic way, echoing walls painted in a too-bright white. A cacophony of voices yelled over each other, desperate to be heard like howling hound dogs against a thunderous night. Harry’s head pounded, a searing pain that travelled from his temples to the back of his eyelids. He felt nauseous with it, his insides a viscous ink that churned and oozed and dribbled throughout his body.
Like the thrill of liquor into absolute bliss and oblivion, as he sunk further, the edges of his mind blurred. His eyes became a liquid whirlpool.
He took another swig from his drink. Maybe if he was a bit more drunk he’d forget that thought had ever crossed his mind.
Malfoy dragged his eyes up and down his body with a dark expression of superiority, and Harry felt the slow appraisal shake his very bones.
Draco hated tattoos, a poison so dense they made his stomach churn. Since sixth year when the snake and the skull burned a bitter, black trail down his arm. His damaged nerves, crammed like spindles underneath the Mark, were so far removed from flesh that it had become his very own burial.
“This is not going to be that kind of photoshoot, Mr. Potter, but if that is what you want then I am more than happy to oblige.”
“Yeah? Well, what’s it got to do with?” Potter wrapped his fingers around Draco’s wrist and yanked him down next to him. Draco was lying on his back like he was ready for his coffin, eyes wide and arms stuck by his side. But he still had four months before he turned eighteen, he had time left. Not a lot, but time, nonetheless.
“Do you remember back then, when you asked me why I do this?” Potter held his hand out in front of him, grabbed Draco’s finger, and traced a slow line along the raised notches of his knuckles.
walked up, then, and Harry eyed Malfoy with a whirlpool of emotions that threatened to bubble over. Malfoy smirked at him in the way that he always did, and Harry seethed.
“You’re ashamed,” Malfoy repeated, and this time, his voice was choked as he sat back up against the headboard, his gaze piercing in the distance.
in a way the public haven’t... but it doesn’t—” Draco shrugged, his shoulders touching the ends of his tinted ears in an endearingly childish movement. “It’s you.”
“No, you heard,” he said, an infernal smirk on his face. And Harry was even more pissed off because he somehow made it look sophisticated instead of the
He drank up the crowd, swayed on his feet, and his body thrummed with an adrenaline rush he hadn’t had before. He could barely remember his own name.
Malfoy laughed, a low and strained sound that echoed off the bathroom walls. It sounded slightly deranged, as if Malfoy was holding a whirlwind of thoughts back with every bark of laughter. His eyes were blown wide, and Harry was startled into complete silence. “You’re a lot of things, Potter, but straight isn’t one of them.”
Death, though, was incarnated in every whipping slur that came out of the Carrows’ mouth. The foul stench trailed the ends of their black robes as if death itself was also afraid of the Carrows. Draco often found pleasure in the protection his last name gave him. But sometimes, as pools of first years lay squirming on the floor around him, holding their breaths to mask their pain, the guilt drowned Draco. It drowned him so much until he too, was among the fallen first years, withering under the hate of a
headquarters, he leaned over the wooden desk separating him from Skeeter’s secretary. His voice was low, and he held in every heaving breath to keep it level.
As the rain drowned every other sound except the singing bird, he couldn’t help but return its croon with the tune he had heard. And so he drummed his feet against the cobblestone, humming in tandem with the night; until he found himself beyond the riverbend at a small shop; lonely and hidden from sight.
He held his hands underneath the running spray, and perhaps, if the water was hot enough, it would wash away all he had just done. Cleanse himself from the thoughts that plagued his mind, drown out the noises until the memories were nothing but a hazy, bad dream. Lost to the shadows of the night.
But that wouldn’t happen again, for this time he would descend to the ground with the Snitch held tightly in his grasp and another win for
It didn’t. But maybe they could continue to pretend that none of it mattered. That they weren’t in a war, that this wasn’t a goodbye. And maybe someday they would believe it, too.
It was then, resting on the perch of his windowsill, the little bluebird began to sing that same old, familiar trill.
Harry nodded, but only really to placate her, because he wasn’t entirely sure of the meaning behind her rushed drivel.
The smooth rhythm of the Black Lake swelled to a crescendo as the waves crashed to the shore. Draco studied it’s movements with blurry eyes, his cheek resting on the cold glass. The way the water moved, and rippled, and pulled and swirled, inviting everything into its current, then pushing it all away.
This was bliss. It rendered him speechless, a startling sort of numbness that made his heart pump overdrive. Numb everywhere but in the taste and the heat of Draco’s mouth. As their tongues slotted together, he inhaled that familiar cocktail of citrus lemon. But here, in this moment, Harry was more aware, more sober than he had ever been before.
A pair of dark and angry silver eyes, ready to strike. A man he thought he had known for over a decade. That man—that
The following night when Draco saw Potter back at the end of his bed, he couldn’t help but ask the question that wouldn’t escape his mind. “Are you dead yet, Potter?”
of the Wizarding World if they thought he was queer? I thought you could fix things, that’s all. I didn’t want to drag you down with me. I never expected us to shag.”
Malfoy stood in the throes of bodies. They thrummed and pulsed against him as if they couldn’t get enough heat, as if they craved more. He moved like water, sinuous and silky in every caress, every look, every crash of the tide.
Before Harry even had time to blink, or swallow, or muffle any sort of sound, Malfoy’s hands had traced the line of buttons going down his shirt, and with long, practiced fingers, he began to unbutton them one by one.
He stood at the opposite end of the room, watching despite the disgust that coursed through his veins. He hated tattoos. The way they were a constant, cruel reminder of his weakness. His childish mistakes.
But that night, when he was just about to fall asleep, his eyes never left the space Potter had been in before he disappeared. And in those blurry seconds between slumber and consciousness, he could convince himself that everything he had seen was real. Even if those moments only lasted seconds, it eased the loneliness in his chest that withstood a lifetime.
Harry glanced at Malfoy, noticed the hard, drawn lines of his face. The way his stoic expression from before crumbled into one of anger, clear in the glare of his eyes. His fists were clenched tight over the arms of the chair, as if he were trying to hold himself back from jumping up and grabbing at his coach.
Harry cleared his throat, again, because apparently he was incapable of making any other sound. Or following simple instructions. He nodded his head even though no one had said anything, and Malfoy finally—
His angry scrawl from yesterday was still there; rough, sharp lines from the scratch of his quill nib, black ink bleeding and blurred around the edges.
for starters—” he counted off on his fingers, “—and two, I won’t have to see your ugly mug taking over the sports section every damn day. It's a win-win for all.”
He began to lift the jumper over his head, but only made it about half way before the material got caught over the frame of his glasses, his elbows stuck up in the air at a painful angle. He wiggled. The jumper would not budge from his nose.
His voice was a slow croon that filled Draco’s body like the silvery light of the moon. The world around him was eerily still, but with Potter’s words, he felt an avalanche crumble over him.
Malfoy said nothing, and Harry moved closer. Chests flush. Malfoy’s lips were nothing but a tease against his ear. He shivered.
The shattering of glass, breaking free from the weight that entrapped him to the shadows of his past.
He knew exactly what Malfoy had to do with this, but it wasn’t like he could tell that to his coach.
“Look,” he conceded, he reached across the table and intertwined their fingers together. “I know you mean well, but I have all of this under control. Malfoy’s a git, but he’s not wrong. If I do this, eventually the
He had a distant awe for the ocean; the sheer power it held in the very lengths of its fingertips. That power to give life to the desperate as they begged on aching knees for one drop of water in a drought. The sweet taste of renewal. In that context, it was nothing like fire who had no choice between destruction or healing. It was only ever raging or fervent or turbulent. Not calm. Serene.
“So do you,” he said as he moved a tiny bit closer; their chests almost touched. He felt Malfoy’s heat consume him, and he became heady with the scent of musky cologne, liquor, and sweat. He inhaled it, his eyes fluttered shut for a moment, and he slipped even further into oblivion.
Draco looked everywhere, turned the entire dormitory upside down. Pillows lined the floor, sheets upended around him, and Draco was knee deep in his extendable trunk, tearing through old robes that no longer fit and piles of chocolate wrappers his Mother would tell him off for if she knew.
Brilliant. Harry was too intelligent to have landed Gryffindor. But even so, he couldn’t quite see what Malfoy's problem was. All he wanted to do was grab the git by his iridescent shirt and rough him up a little—
Watching the morning dew on the first light of spring. Walking hand in hand along a snowy path on Christmas Eve. Flying together above cobblestone streets in the dead of night. Feeling satiated and spent on Sunday afternoons, wrapped in the pleasure of each other.
And this was what it was like to toy the fine line between life and death. In the spiralling descent to the ground, Harry felt its dissonance. The way his heart beat frantically in his chest as his mind grappled with the thought that this was the end. Wind, rain, and thunderous skies. How was it that in the moments before his death he felt the most alive?
Harry laughed in his face, a disbelieving, slightly neurotic laugh because he couldn’t believe what he had just heard coming out of Malfoy’s prissy mouth. What brain numbing potions had he been hooked on recently to really think he’d even consider his—what,
into the overflowing bin with a sharp shake of his head. Pages of old, torn up newspapers littered the floor of his office; he flicked his wand and vanished them all away. Deverill leaned back in his chair, then, and dusty brown eyes regarded Harry silently.
spews, you were never ashamed of being bent,” Malfoy said matter of factly, and the smile on his lips grew like a warning, awaiting for the very moment it could fire its final blow.
“They don’t, but you hold your entire life controlled by the one you own.” With a flick of Harry’s finger, a quill and an inkpot came careening out from his shop’s open window and into his waiting palm. “I think it’s time you let go.”
Before Harry could open his mouth to say anything, to stop Draco from walking away, his bedroom door shut closed with a rattle that trembled through Harry's beating heart.
A pitter-patter echoed off the walls after each footfall like the soft drizzle of rain underneath the very soles of his shoes. Draco found it rather fitting, for the pool of loneliness flooded the entire length of the Great Hall. He made his way across the room and stood in front of the High Table, and right there, before his eyes was a wooden stool. A battered hat. A time of innocence long forgotten, of wonderment masked by arrogance. It was the beginning of a journey, a life he had no idea would come to a staggering halt by his final year.
The soft flowing curves of a flower petal bloomed between the cracks and scars on his arm. Between the remnants of his Dark Mark: a red carnation, fragile in its penned creation. The way it flourished against his skin was a soft breath of spring after a burning draught.
“You have no right to speculate and intrude on my personal life like I’m not a human being. What I do, who I am, and what I like is
The last thing he heard as the bathroom door began to slowly close was the erratic splattering of water pounding against steel.
He turned the page and ran his hand down the blank expanse of parchment, feeling something itch at the back of his mind. Draco sat amidst the mess of the dormitory, back leaning against his four-poster bed, and began to write. The slow etch of the quill was the only sound breaking the hum of silence.
Insanity was a pageant. A cruel show of lies in every crooked smile. A flicker of hate in bright, sparkling eyes. A call for help on deaf ears. Loneliness. Draco knew about insanity because it showed its face in every one of his memories.
The moment had come. They reached their arms out at the same time, and Harry's fist clenched over something smooth. Malfoy's did the same.
Darkness swallows us, but through the crack in my glasses, all I can see is Malfoy. My senses drown with him. I haven’t had a lick of alcohol and yet I’m completely drunk. The dim lights in the club pulse with tension, and Malfoy’s body preens under it, glistening and wet.
Draco frowned, but there was a glint in his eyes that made Harry’s heart speed up—something open and inviting. Harry tapped his fingers along the wood of his Firebolt, a sporadic rhythm.
“The Quidditch Times,” Deverill barked, “the most famous Wizarding sport’s magazine since 1804, has dragged both
Harry said, but it sounded a bit like a question because he couldn’t quite remember what Malfoy had asked him. So, he thought the safest and smartest option was ‘yes’.
His gaze followed Malfoy on the other end of the pitch, who was flying around in an elegant loop. His robes billowed behind him, and the wind rustled through his hair. He looked dishevelled, in a strangely alluring way, and Harry bit down on his lips to halt the direction of his thoughts.
“I don’t think I’ll live past my eighteenth birthday,” he said aloud for the first time. The words tasted vile in his mouth, and when Potter’s fingers stopped moving across his skin, he wished he could have taken it all back.
he says. As if that matters. We’ve been on the precipice of slipping for years, a slow-growing waiting game. Falling is inevitable.
Draco opened his mouth to protest, feeling heat rise to his cheeks. But Pansy was looking at him with such solemn affection, that he felt he could … perhaps … admit it … out loud.
Harry wore his cloak back to Gryffindor tower; he didn’t want the attention that wearing pajamas midday might attract. He mentally tried to recap everything, to get it all straight. But Malfoy felt like an enigma.
When Harry popped out of Malfoy’s fireplace, he spotted him immediately: standing in the centre of a small living room with one hand on his hip, the other on his head, as he surveyed the room around himself and its state of cleanliness.
Ginny laughed. ‘Didn’t I tell you Blaise and I are dating? It’s new, but, it’s been fun. I get all the juicy Slytherin/Hufflepuff gossip too.’
'Brilliant,' Harry beamed, seemingly relieved Draco wasn't bothered by this. And of course Draco wasn't—it was Weasley and Granger. They were … well, a huge part of Harry Potter.
Potter sauntered off, leaving the room in silence once more. Draco sat still for a while. That had been nice of Potter. It was nice to be invited. The idea of stepping into that room, though, and seeing everyone’s face fall or twist into anger, hearing everyone’s conversations immediately stop—no thank you.
. There was no chance Potter would be anything but angry to see him. He’d always hated Draco. Always. From the very moment they’d met, at age eleven.
Astoria reached for his hand, and intertwined her fingers with his. “I want you to be happy, Draco. And I think … I think being with a man would make you happy.”
So he left the laptop on the table, tilted the screen upwards a bit, and pushed all the chairs to the side.
He kept glancing over at Draco, and Draco was doing the same. Every time they locked eyes, they smiled and looked away.
Harry straightened, and smiled at Draco like he was genuinely happy. It was … well. ‘Hey.’ He handed Draco a plastic cup with a straw. ‘Ready?’
, I’ll have you know that I dropped it before it could finish. And what I want, truly want—more than anything—is for you to stop working here, so I never have to see your ugly, annoying face again. Now if you will please ...
'Never mind that.' He cleared his throat, and straightened up. 'I did complete the "power point" for the senior leadership meeting. Can you check it over for me?'
“I’m sorry,” Harry said again. “I meant to send a proper response later, when my head was on right.”
Potter's thumb brushed against his knuckle. ‘I’m glad you told me, too. And I’m not sorry you’ve came to Ibiza.’ His head was still tilted down as he stared at their joined hands, but Draco noticed the edges of his mouth lifting. ‘You didn’t once try to convince me to go back. I appreciate that.’
He folded them, careful to not get fingerprints all over the glass, and set them on the night stand.
Miserably, Harry braced himself for Malfoy to be angry, to say he should never have trusted Harry. It’d been stupid of him to get excited about having a real, proper excuse to talk to Malfoy. Of course it wouldn’t go well. He looked down at his hands, gripping his own thighs. He’d fucked this all up. Malfoy had depended on him … and now Malfoy was just going to go back to despising him.
Malfoy didn’t say anything for a long time, but right as he opened his mouth to respond, Apolline's voice broke the moment. “Move, boys. One position is not a good
Harry’s breathing stuttered and he fought as the air escaped his lungs, his head dizzy and reeling. “You could at least take me to dinner before trying to have your way with me,” Harry breathed, as he chucked the Snitch curled between his palm over Draco’s head, where it whirled away somewhere across the pitch.
And three: his eyes pierced open, and in the last, death-defying seconds before either of them had a chance to hit the ground, he surged forward. He rolled into a Sloth Grip right underneath Malfoy’s falling body who hooked his legs around the front of the Firebolt. Their hair grazed the ground as they flew into the wind, and Malfoy clung on by the crook of his knees and one arm. Harry pushed upward—
“I have enough,” and his voice was eerily rough. But Harry didn’t really know what he meant, so he nodded his head as if he understood the words he said.
Harry licked his lips, and Malfoy’s eyes lapped up the movement as if he craved something sinful too.
You’re actually thinking of something.” Potter laughed, and it was loud and consuming and right from the belly. It was a jarring, obnoxious sound against the silence of the night, but Draco found himself leaning into it.
Now Malfoy was completely silent, and he stared at Harry with narrowed eyes and an ugly curl to his lips. His hands were clenched by his side, his posture pin-straight like an overstrung bow. He gritted his teeth. “Correct me if I’m wrong, Potter, but you already did that last week on the Quidditch pitch. In front of everyone.” Malfoy's gaze travelled down to Harry’s hand, where the remnants of his actions painted his knuckles purple and blue.
His new flat was the last building on the street. Third floor, above a small bookshop run by a lonely widow who lived in the flat right below his feet. He had to walk up a flight of stairs to get to his door, and when he finally managed to lodge the key into his lock, he stepped into the dim. The door shut closed; a solid, final sound that jolted him. There was a mismatch of emotions that carded through his bones. Of longing and mourning, a childlike giddiness, and a heavy weight that settled like the looming fate of the unknown.
Malfoy’s hand was still carding through Harry’s hair, fingernails rough and blunt against his scalp. Harry leaned into it, melting under Malfoy’s hands.
“Mr. Potter, sir, does this mean you’re confirming—” his hand shot up in the air, silencing the nameless reporter.
Colours. So many colours. Harry held Draco’s cheeks between his palms, tasting the sweet colour of delicious delirium on his lips.
“There’s a lot of things I could be doing that I’m not supposed to,” I say, and Malfoy licks the words along the sharp shape of his lips, tongue slow and teasing.
Harry’s fingers stopped their slow journey through Draco’s hair; his hand rested at the nape of his neck.
From the corner of his eye he saw a flash, a swirl of movement. Malfoy turned a sharp corner and began to climb the sky. Harry was hot on his trail, fire versus ice. With every exhale of breath, his broom closed the distance. His chest flat to the wood, his fingers were red and blistered from how tight he gripped the handle.
Malfoy was met with the sweet sound of silence, and for the first time since Harry walked into the joint, he basked in its sereneness. His migraine quieted almost to a standstill.
So, when Saturday finally rolled around, he painted the sky with his navy and yellow robes, determined to win.
Harry stood silently, hands crossed over his naked chest, he had no idea what had been said in French, or how Malfoy and this photographer seemed to know each other, but he could feel a spike of heat starting to pool at the base of his spine, and tried desperately not to think about the logistics of him being
Harry raised his eyes to the ceiling, glaring, as the back of his head bounced off the plastic of the too hard chair. “This’s got nothing to do with me having control over the rumours. You just wanna get
He inhaled; slow and right from the chest. He took in the smell of old oak and the sour musk of neglect. Home, he thought. This will do.
Harry cleared his throat, and the sound bounced ominously off the walls. He had probably just misheard her, so he muttered a small “Sorry?”
So Draco took it, and took it, and took it, until he couldn’t bear to take it anymore. The stars that flooded his vision brought him back to the Great Hall, and that wasn’t so bad, because with the Great Hall came memories of green eyes and a lopsided grin.
“I know I’ve been nothing but a shit to you, but just this once.” Malfoy’s eyes opened, and Harry was hit with an expression full of heat and fire and something else. Something
He caved into the magic of his ink like a whirlpool of quicksand beneath his feet. As if it somehow knew, the bluebird on his windowsill began to sing its sweet tune.
The sounds from the onlookers down below were a low vibration in the air; they seemed to follow him like the wind, urging him to focus and push forward, to follow the movements of the clouds and find the Snitch. He smiled. He couldn’t help it: this was Harry’s home, a freedom he couldn’t indulge in while on soil.
It was a reminder of the way things could change in an instant; a fragile feather slipping from the warmth of his hands and into a blistering storm. Holding Draco’s cheeks between his palms in one moment, and Draco walking away in the next.
means to you, but for me, when I was at my worst after Ron… You were just there, and it was nice to forget about everything for a while.”
Draco licked his lips, and helplessly gave in to the buckling need of Harry’s kiss. It was a slow desperation, a caving, relentless sensation, until the only thought that swirled in Draco’s mind was the taste of Harry.
In the reflection of the floor, Malfoy’s eyes narrowed at the woman, but she either didn’t notice the heavy awkwardness that blanketed the room, or she simply didn’t care because she continued to speak in her too-quick cadence, barely stopping to take a breath.
The glass of Butterbeer drops to the floor, shattered crystal and liquid gold pooling around our feet. Malfoy pushes against me, my back hits the wall, and finally we give in. His lips taste illicit and sweet, I feel him rush through my veins, blood pumping. Poison warm and silky.
“I just want you to know,” Harry said, as he watched Draco circle around him. His throat hurt from yelling, but he pushed forward, trying to catch the tail of Draco’s broom. “I don’t like how we left things on Saturday. I’m not ashamed of you, Draco. I’m not ashamed of the rumours about us. I’m not ashamed of everyone knowing how I feel about you.”
“A photoshoot, Potter. Do keep up.” They stood barely a whisper apart, and every time Harry breathed, he could feel their sides brush up against each other. Fire and ice.
meant much more than the situation they were currently in. He understood the meaning behind those words as he stared into the deep pools of Malfoy’s eyes. As he felt the trail of thin scars run up his torso, raised and cold against the calluses of Harry’s palm.
Deverill exhaled through his nose and stacked the Quidditch magazines into a neat pile on top of the desk, which looked an odd sight amongst the mess of loose paper and crumbled up balls of the
Their team walked up to the centre of the pitch: Oliver in front, Harry at his shoulder. The stadium erupted, and Harry felt the rhythm of stomping feet and the clapping of hands shoot straight through to his heart, resuscitating him and alighting every fibre in his bones. An unbridled smile broke his face in two as he stared at the sea of navy blue and yellow. He lived for this very feeling. He was greedy for it. He wanted more.
Winding, cobblestone streets stretched before him, and he inhaled the smell of midnight rain and moss. It was a small muggle town, bustling with strangers whose faces blurred together. Draco matched his breathing with the hum of life. Shoes as they clicked on stone, the pitter-patter of water falling on leaves. The clinking of glasses and the laughter that travelled with the breeze.
His eyes were trained on the fluttering of soft feathers, almost wrapped in the very palm of his hands. He could feel it brush against his fingers like a phantom, as if he were back in the final moments of their last game before they plummeted through the sky. Whipping words, broken noses, and broken Snitches.
Draco sat on the sofa and stared out at the far wall. He reached for the white box in front of him—opening it up to see what was there. Not a bad selection of French pastries. He munched on a croissant and brushed the crumbs unto the floor. Then he Scourgified the floor.
He squinted at what he wrote. It was getting a bit late, maybe he should’ve saved the reply for the morning, when he would be sharper.
Okay. Time to pause on the wallowing. He took another sip of coffee, and decided to open his presents.
Harry’s face lit up. “Okay, so, remember how you told me you love seeing what Muggles dream up about magic?”
And so they ate—and Harry’s vegetarian pizza was just as incredible as the pasta—and they drank their bottle of wine. Everything was delicious and the night air was lovely, and Malfoy looked relaxed and pleased.
Sighing, Pansy said, ‘Ugh, you are hopeless. He makes videos. Moving pictures with sound. On the internet.’ Groaning now, she added, ‘Just watch.’ Pansy pushed a few buttons, and aimed the screen at Draco.
Draco bit his lip to keep from smiling too much. He chanced a glance at his wife, who was looking back at him with amusement, and a lifted eyebrow.
Harry shrugged. ‘So, they think they love me, then. Isn’t too different from the weird fan mail I get from time to time.’
Malfoy nodded, and stepped further inside, walking straight across the sitting room to the kitchen. Ah, the empty frozen food boxes, the wrappers, the dishes. The overflow of pasta sauce on the range. The bits of cereal of the counter. Harry hadn’t bothered—he just didn’t care. What’s the point of cleaning, when it’s only for yourself? When it’s only going to get dirty again?
But he couldn’t stop thinking about it, about going. And he couldn’t stop thinking about Harry Potter.
Done with the onion and garlic, set in little piles on the cutting board, Harry fished out the frying pan, and set it on the range. Then he went to grab the butter, milk, and eggs from the refrigerator.
‘Er, thanks,’ Harry answered, tossing Hagrid a glance, but Hagrid was already resuming his conversation with Slughorn.
He didn’t know how long he’d been looking, before Madam Pomfrey came in with heels clacking. He fumbled around for his glasses on the nightstand, and put them on.
Blaise helped her onto her feet, and made to leave, but not before Pansy could lean towards Draco once more and hiss, “Loves you.”
‘Mm, oh …' Harry gasped at the now familiar feeling. ‘Aren’t you going to, um, use your cock though?’
Of course, his mind reminded him, he might be about to set fiendfyre to his life—and fuck it all up permanently. He sighed out loud.
The only sound was galloping horses on the screen, and Draco and Harry Potter were staring at each other.
Next Harry began working on the marinade for the chicken, and Draco settled back at the table with his wine and an opened box of chocolate biscuits in front of him. They fell into an easy, comfortable silence, broken up by a few light-hearted comments or questions. It was nice.
Harry snorted. “Don’t blame you … but I guess we best get back to it, before Robards chews us out again for ‘gossiping on the job’.”
It was a small and modest affair. Those who knew what Snape had contributed to the war effort attended, which meant a close group of students and teachers. Some ministry officials. Predictably, Snape hadn’t wanted a fuss. He was buried in Godric’s Hollow, not far from Harry’s parents.
So Draco allowed his legs to sink, to bring his ears above water. His feet lay flat on the pebbly sea floor, and only his shoulders were above water.
Dinner was served just as the sun began to set over the horizon—the sky erupting in soft pinks, yellows and purples as the string quartet played quietly. The food was lovely: a spicy, earthy squash soup; goat cheese and beet salad; seashell pasta that had some form of flower petal on it (Harry was initially a bit sceptical but it tasted really good); stuffed Cornish hens; And, finally, the lightest, most heavenly, chocolate mousse cake. Ginny’d had a whole number of comments on the snobbishness of the food. Harry largely tuned it out—since, well, he enjoyed it, and because he was trying not to think.
Draco’s eyebrows went up, and he finished what he was eating, before responding, ‘Fine. Well, a bit mad with you around.’
,’ said Hermione, gripping onto his arm now. ‘We were worried! You never leave without telling us where you’re going!’
Draco reached for Harry’s hand next to his, and interlaced their fingers. They lay in silence for a bit. Harry could hardly believe it … Draco fancied
Draco laughed. He should really stop laughing—this was supposed to be a sad story. 'Merlin, Harry. I don't know. I suppose so.' Not like he was any expert. 'Well, how was it?'
“I might … harbour a fantasy for him. But that’s all it can ever be … We’ve only ever argued, we’ve only ever
Ruben and Dimitri popped into the car, eyeing Harry with concern as they passed him, but saying nothing.
The slug did a few loops in the air, and then, for whatever reason, was lit on fire. The flames ate through it quickly, sending ashy dust down to the grass on the pitch, as fans went absolutely wild for it.
‘Actually … yes, I was stupid and brash today. And you know … I’m not really sorry about that—it felt good.’ Realisation was beginning to dawn on him. ‘I’ve been boring, lately.’ Draco furrowed his brow at that. ‘Like a knife left unused in a drawer for too long—I've gotten dull. I’m
Draco nodded, and didn’t remove his hands from his eyes. ‘I’m so sorry—for what I did to you.’ His voice cracked.
He turned it over in his hands—it was wrapped neatly in brown paper, and tied with string. There was no return address or sender’s name, just a carefully written: “Professor Harry Potter at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, care of International Owl Post Office, London, UK.” It was rather curious.
Draco narrowed his eyes, and mentally reviewed his day. He couldn’t recall feeling anything out of the ordinary … ‘I guess that’s true.’ He sighed. ‘Just tell me everything, Pans.’
They turned another right, and found themselves at a tiny pub, with a little Guinness sign hanging over the doorway.
Draco gently eased his finger out Harry's arse, and let his sensitive cock drop from his palm. 'Oh, Harry.'
He reluctantly looked over, to see Professor Vector wordlessly indicating that he should follow Malfoy out with a jerk of her head.
‘Oh hold on, I forgot the sound,’ said Pansy. She took the laptop back and clicked something. A blast of loud, throbbing, contemporary music played as she pointed it back in Draco’s direction.
‘You’re fine … and Draco’s my friend now too, so …' He glanced at Ron, who still seemed scandalised by the prospect. Harry took a breath. ‘Okay. I’m sorry, it should’ve occurred to me to tell you both.’
It was just morbid curiosity that they’d even shown up. Probably. They’d get to see first-hand what a Malfoy wedding would entail. They’d likely have a laugh about it—at its snobbish-ness, its Pureblooded-ness, its over-the-top-ness. It was bound to be downright garish in its extravagance. At least they’d get a nice free meal out of it, though.
Draco invited Harry over to his flat for their first weekend away from Hogwarts as boyfriends. They could snog the entire weekend. And maybe even, well, more than that, if they were ready.
So, with five teas and a plate of chocolate digestives on a tray, Harry entered the living room, setting it all down on the coffee table, before observing his crowd.
Hermione, bless her (again), seemed determined to let him speak when he was ready. In the mean time, she spent the time mumbling comments on the fixed menu—reading the paper very carefully. "Black garlic, how interesting ..."
Harry trailed after Draco and the rest of the Slytherins—walking Draco to the dungeons since he had Draco’s suitcase and Draco had the blasted, heavy pumpkin. They fell behind everyone, in less of a hurry to get to their dormitories than the others, apparently.
Draco took a breath to steel himself, and took off walking the aisles, careful not to touch anything, or look at anything too closely.
Without warning, Harry raised the camera up. Draco's eyes widened as Harry clicked a button on the thing, and a flash of light nearly blinded him. 'There. Now you'll always have the memory of your breakfast today.' Harry pushed a button on the back of the thing, and smiled down at it.
Malfoy climbed off of him to stand up. And right then Harry was definitely sure then that Malfoy was just as turned on as he was. “Fuck,” he uttered.
Draco pulled away first, with dilated pupils, and a flush high on his cheeks. He licked his lips, as he stared at Harry’s mouth. ‘Now that … was a proper kiss.’
The world sure was fucked up. Sweet little Harry Potter had been kept in a cupboard? Who the fuck does that? If he’d known—oh who was he trying to kid. He’d probably have been exactly the same, made all the same choices.
He hated the implication … he hated that Draco would think that he wanted … Whatever. It didn’t matter.
Harry looked over, and saw that that blush was back. ‘Maybe I do,’ he agreed, shooting Draco a smile—then biting at his bottom lip to cover it up.
‘Listen. Harry Potter plays a set every Friday night at some place called Sankeys. I found out on his Facebook.’
'Er,' Harry walked in with some hesitation, closing the door behind himself. He came closer to Draco’s bed, eyeing the telephone on the floor and stepping around it. 'It's half-eleven, did you know?'
Harry bit his lip to keep from grinning too big. ‘Ah. That sounds nice.’ Then, for good measure, he kissed Draco.
He was still looking at the little white briefs. Harry reached for the waistband, and lifted it up a few inches. A cockhead slipped out. Harry inhaled sharply. He pushed the waistband lower, revealing more length, a thick vein. He pulled the pants all the way down, and worked them off Malfoy’s legs altogether. Short, blond hairs. Bollocks. A hard, dripping cock waiting to be touched. Or tasted.
Draco turned around. Harry could see the toes of his shoes pointing towards him. ‘Harry,’ Draco said again, lower now. Softer. ‘Is that why you won’t tell me? You think whatever it is would jeopardise our friendship? Well I’ve got news for you …' He huffed a laugh at himself. ‘I’ve wanted to be your friend for seven years. Now that I finally have you, I’m not giving you up easy.’
Harry came out of the room to find Draco on the couch with the containers of takeaway arranged on the coffee table in front of himself, with the two glasses of red wine. He had one bare foot propped up on the table. Harry had to resist raking his eyes all over him.
It was enough. It was enough to have seen it with his own eyes. This was a goodbye, in its own way, goodbye to all the complicated feelings he’d discovered at fourteen. Feelings he’d struggled with, denied, and even gone so far as to harm Potter to cover them. His behaviour had been shameful. And Potter deserved so much better than that.
. The DVD player. Muggle things. ‘This is amazing. Incredible, really. Who would’ve actually thought?’ He was probably talking more to himself than to Malfoy.
“I wrote those stupid poems.” Draco pulled out the folded-up parchment containing his awful sonnet, and tossed it at Potter.
Harry’s heartbeat staggered. Malfoy was inviting him … to his flat. For a weekend. The flat from the fantasy. The fantasy in which Malfoy imagined himself bent over a table. No big deal, indeed. ‘Yeah.’
. “He discovered my secret. That I’m gay. Which—no surprise there—is deplorable to him. So he marked me up so hideously that no one would ever touch me.”
Harry smiled to himself, and went to grab his untouched glass of wine from the countertop. Then, he continued with his cooking.
Harry switched to his right hand again, and pumped fast. Stormy grey eyes, daring him to come, to come inside his arse. Draco’s arse.
The dock rocked under someone’s approaching feet. Draco moved to look behind himself, but stopped when he remembered he’d just sobbed like a child at the thought that Potter might find him ugly, and his face was likely a red, puffy mess. The footsteps got closer, and somebody lowered themselves to sit beside him.
Harry’s hands found their way to Draco’s hips, pulling Draco’s body against his, kneading at him in pulses. And a hand found its way around Draco’s back, snaking up the back of his shirt to feel smooth, warm bare skin under his fingertips.
He shook his head slowly, and couldn’t keep a smile from forming. Well, then. This was a very unexpected turn of events. Draco took a breath, and then released it. ‘Some would say we’ve waited long enough.’ He certainly might say so. Merlin. He’d had no idea … no hint nor clue …
But Harry was distracted by the raised bit of scar tissue running from one shoulder diagonally downwards. He reached out to touch the smooth, slippery skin there, as his heartrate sped up. Harry's semi immediately disappeared, as a cold sense of dread rose within him. 'Draco … did I do this?'
He looked sad. And blotchy from tears. But he was looking at Draco, and his eyes dropped to Draco's hands.
He scooted forward on his bum to the end of the bed to get a closer look at what Harry was doing. The television had a lot of different stations—sporting events, to colourful cartoons, to old men droning on about something, all flashed over the screen. Muggles were bloody something, weren't they? Somehow making television happen—
Draco didn't have to remind Harry he was the only one to survive Avada Kedavra—he was the outlier in his argument here. Draco exhaled slow. 'Yes, but try telling some wizards they're going to die one day.'
‘Oh …’ Harry tried to swallow the lump that’d just formed in his throat. He flipped through some of the pages, saw little notes in cursive to add a little more cumin here, a little less coconut there. It was … it was sort of like she could teach him … teach him to cook like her ...
The waiter came with their orders, setting the plates down in front of them. And Harry did not pull his hand away, not even when he looked up to thank the waiter.
Draco pulled Harry’s t-shirt over his head, and Harry fumbled with the buttons on Draco’s shirt, distracted by the sight of Draco’s cock
Rather than hearing him, Harry could read Malfoy’s lips, saying, “Excuse me,” to his friends, before carefully making his way over, closer to Harry.
Potter pulled his shorts clean off, stepping out of them. Draco looked away quickly, but not before accidentally catching a bit of Potter’s bare bum.
“Good luck, Harry,” Luna said, before she stood up and floated over to the stacks, with the thick skirt of her dress bobbing as she walked.
“Fine,” Harry said. Then he thought better of it, since he was talking to his best mate, after all. “Okay, a bit weird. We made polite small talk. He was very calm; he even smiled.”
“Yes. The man you used to stalk through the halls. The man you’d stare at and shout insults back and forth from
Neville turned the sphere in his hand, eyeing it from all angles. “Fascinating,” he said. “’Children,’ it’d said?”
Harry carefully tore at the pretty paper, to reveal a brown leather journal. An identical one to what was currently in Draco's hands.
After the ceremony, cocktails and hors d’oeuvres were served by well-dressed waiters and waitresses. Ginny complained that she was bored, and kept commenting on the other guest’s hairstyles and outfits. Harry sipped his gin and bergamot cocktail, humming his responses with a mind more preoccupied with anxiety stemming from his earlier thoughts.
His smile faltered a fraction, when he noticed one more item: a white envelope, with ‘HARRY’ written in Ginny’s handwriting. He hadn’t sent her anything … But, Harry wasn’t sure this would be a good gift from her anyway—he had a bad feeling about this.
Pansy paused to scrutinise him, and frowned. 'Don't you want to see them as soon as possible? Draco, are you still brooding? How much custard are you eating?'
Harry's cock slipped out of Draco's fingers as Harry moved to sit up. He removed his t-shirt and pyjama bottoms in two quick movements, then he reached for his wand on Draco's nightstand. A quick set of prep, protection, and lubrication spells got them ready in a flash. Harry tugged on Draco's slickened cock to get him fully erect in seconds.
Gripping the edge of the counter, he couldn’t decide if he felt like cooking, or if he should get takeaway. Turning to the refrigerator, his eye caught on Malfoy’s wedding invitation. He smiled, a little wistfully, and found himself taking the magnet off, and holding the paper in his hand.
And he still had Malfoy’s letters. Surely Malfoy needed them, right? Whether to read them or burn them or what-have-you.
He arrived at Hermione’s favourite restaurant (Ron hated it: too confusing) on time, and took a moment to let his eyes adjust. Luckily Ron hadn’t been bothered about Harry’s sudden lunch plans—he hadn't questioned it at all.
They pushed through the doors to the refreshingly cool Three Broomsticks. After Harry’s eyes adjusted to the darkened interior, Harry waved at Madam Rosmerta. She nodded back, but lifted a brow at Harry’s choice of company. He smiled in response as they approached to place their food and drink orders.
Malfoy blinked at him, and, slowly, said, “I see.” He cleared his throat. “Well, I’m sure there’s a Weasley bloke or two—”
‘Who’s there?’ The voice was a little louder this time, but the way it wavered betrayed nervousness. ‘Lumos.’
And Harry had stopped in his tracks and taken Draco’s cold cheeks in his mittened hands, pressing a hard kiss to Draco’s cold lips. And he’d pulled back with bright, open eyes, and said, “I love you too.”
They exited through the doors, rounded a corner, and stopped abruptly, turning towards each other. Harry'd been hoping for this, maybe they could snog again, since no one was around.
He stood up and began rummaging around, pulling boxes out and setting them onto the counter. He eventually found some chocolate digestives, and poured a bunch out onto a plate.
Harry joined him—with a laugh breathy and contented. They were laughing at themselves, then. At their own awkwardness, and their supposed long-held mutual attraction. Draco felt drunk with it, and he was quite sure it
Pansy frowned, then seemed to think. She shrugged and then plastered a grin on her face. ‘How would you say Potter looks today?’
A breathy laugh. 'Fuck, yeah.' Draco moved in closer, and ran his hand down Harry's wet lower back, and cupped his arse cheek. 'You've a fantastic arse,' he murmured, leaning in to kiss at Harry's jaw.
Harry froze. His journal-mate was probably right—there might be a few people with fantasies about him. He was the sodding “Saviour”, after all. It garnered some attention. But that didn’t keep his heart rate from speeding up. He wondered if staying anonymous was really the right thing to do now. But, at the same time, he just couldn’t reveal himself. It was selfish, perhaps. His journal-mate had to know, though, had to know there was a chance that the Gryffindor he was talking to could be Harry Potter. He’d taken that risk. So … it was okay. It had to be. Fuck, he wanted to know what the fantasy was.
After a few too many at the pub, Harry had fumbled his way home, launched himself into bed, and looked forward to a nice, well-deserved sleep-in.
He shrugged. 'Why not.' Could be interesting to see the sort of people Harry spends his time with here. And Draco didn't come here to be an inconvenience. If Harry feels he can't leave Draco to his own devises on a Saturday night, then, well, might as well try to compromise.
She knocked her knuckle against a box. “This one’s good.” She stared at him. Merlin, what a strange person.
Harry sighed. “I will. Privately.” He swivelled his chair back around to face his desk. “Over here.”
It wasn’t easy to secure a Portkey for Lashkar-Gah, Afghanistan. He’d had to push his name around, call in some old favours at the Ministry.
She patted his cheek, as the rest of the Weasley clan barrelled over to say their hello’s, sharing hugs, hugging Malfoy, even—to his shock and dismay.
The group of them were already making their way, winding through those garish metal things on wheels, towards a sizable log cabin building on the other end. Its façade featured horizontally-placed dark wooden logs, and tall windows near its centre—seemingly where the lobby was.
Harry looked down at his hands, at the green thing with white specks on its leaves. “Oh, right. It’s for you.”
Malfoy produced a piece of chalk from his pocket and kneeled down. He busied himself drawing complex shapes right onto the floor. He checked over his work, and then drew a large circle, more than encompassing the symbols. It was large enough to seat five people inside. “Sit beside me.” He patted a spot to his left.
‘Your life. Tell me about it.’ Draco took a bite of his dumpling, and leaned back in his chair, waiting.
Oh, Merlin. He could get Astoria a—he grimaced just thinking about it, and felt a blush rise up on his neck—a
Draco didn’t know what point Potter was trying to make at all. “Li Shang is just a drawing,” he reminded Potter.
Disclaimer: I have never been to Afghanistan. However, I did a lot of research regarding MSF work (reading interviews and articles) and I watched some VICE videos. But, I may've still got things wrong (actually, I'd say it's guaranteed). I think the only way I could be 100% accurate is if I contacted someone who worked for MSF in Afghanistan in 2009 ... but that'd be
A glance in the mirror gave him pause, again. The trials of his life showed harshly on his body, unmistakable and sickening in this bright light. His worst memories were written on his skin—Potter’s scars on his chest, the ugly faded Dark Mark on his arm, the scars on his face from the chandelier falling at home, and the curse scars that ran from his lower back to his thighs. From his punishment.
Dave rolled his eyes toward the ceiling. 'There will be a real art instructor. Not just me, pushing random buttons and making things explode.'
Harry blinked back at him. He’d personally never taken an airplane, and did not know what turbulence was. Nor who Julie or Julia were. ‘Well … that’s good.’
Potter smiled back, though tentatively, as he handed Draco the hair dryer. Draco took it. Potter did an awkward little hover, then cleared his throat, and left the bathroom.
Draco stepped closer, and as he did, Harry reached around behind himself and produced another red drink—holding it out for Draco.
‘Oh, yeah,’ Harry murmured. ‘Well …’ He licked his lips. ‘There are ways I could show that I truly want this.’
Draco let go of his hold on Harry's crotch, instead slipping his fingers underneath Harry's waistband. Fingers carded through pubic hair, and came to rest upon Harry's cock and balls again—bare skin on bare skin. Draco's fingertips brushed across Harry's cockhead. And Harry was becoming well on his way to hard.
Neville slumped against the wall, across from Harry, sinking to the floor. “What if she doesn’t? Then what? We have to break up?”
Draco turned to look at Harry, seeing him there—still standing, holding the package of mystery food.
He found the hotel, checked in without incident, and went up to his hotel room to put away his things.
Malfoy nodded, just looking back at Harry calmly, not seeming to be bored at all with their small talk. Just ... contented. In general. Harry supposed that’s just what happy grooms are like.
Harry edged closer, and brought his other hand, the one that wasn’t still holding the ends of Malfoy’s hair, up to the top of Malfoy’s head, smoothing it over the silky strands, ending up with it cradling the back of his head.
A booming voice made an announcement, causing the crowd to go wild around them—standing up, clapping, shouting with hands cupped around mouths.
She pinched her mouth when she saw Harry step inside, and beckoned wordlessly for him to sit. The only empty seat was beside Malfoy. Harry approached slowly, and then slunk down into the chair.
Harry ignored the hand altogether, pulling Draco in for a hug. It was one of those all-encompassing hugs. Warm. Solid. And it nearly knocked the wind out of Draco.
“Because I don’t think it’s wrong,” she said kindly. “And I understand why you felt you had to hide that part of you.” She exhaled slow. “And maybe, deep down, I may’ve known, even if I didn’t know I knew. You didn’t have an interest in anything remotely sexual with me, for one. And you’ve always been a bit … preoccupied with certain men.”
It went by in a blur. Literally and figuratively, on account of Harry being unable to see through his tears. Afterwards, Harry hugged Andromeda, with baby Teddy in her arms, with tears escaping onto her robes. She had nodded at Draco, then.
There was no ‘on’. There was a big red ‘power’ button, which sounded rather alarming. He didn’t want to blast the thing with extra power. What if it exploded? There were number buttons, and things for volume and channel. Whatever that meant. Could one increase the volume of a telly, like make it bigger or smaller? That seemed far too much like magic. He also knew what a channel was, but didn’t know how a body of water related to the telly either.
somewhere off in the distance. But it was nothing more than an unimportant ring at the back of his mind. Nothing compared to the low sound of Malfoy’s breaths, which were growing louder in the small space between them.
Just as he was about to slide the letter back into the envelope, Apolline’s owl—still sitting primly beside him—nipped the skin on top of Harry’s hand.
“Why do you do it?” Malfoy asked one night, sitting by the window watching the swells run along the riverside. His head was tipped back, his skin glittering under the light of the moon. And the thought hit Harry—what it would feel like to have his hand caressing the expanse of Malfoy’s milky skin, painting a world of colour over him.
He wandered with a purpose but no destination, only following lanterns on brick walls, and glowing street lamps on wet roads. In a life where he had been manhandled and manicured to live, and act, and be someone he wasn’t, it was nice to get away from it all. Even for a moment. A small reprieve, where he could walk the cobblestone streets wherever they took him.
At practice the morning after the article broke, his teammates had stared at him as he walked into the locker room to change into his kit. They stared at him like they didn’t know who he was. On any other day, he would’ve welcomed that feeling; but this time, as the stares followed and the whispers chased, he couldn’t help but feel pried open.
work, somehow. This sort of thing doesn’t happen, Draco, a chance to start again, and maybe this time is the right time.” He pulled out his hand in the space between them. Reaching out in an attempt to mend all those broken years. “So. Hello. My name’s Harry,” he whispered with a teasing smile.
“What do you want, then, Harry?” Draco’s voice was lower, now, but Harry heard every word reverberate in his mind as if they were communicating through Legilimency.
Sometimes, when he was stuck between the decaying walls of Grimmauld Place it was hard to remember that. He had toyed the line of life and death like it was a game, a gamble. The flick of a Galleon to determine his fate
Malfoy didn’t say anything, but he made no effort to move, and so Harry walked back to his chair, put on a new pair of gloves, and continued. The buzzing of the needle filled the static space between them, and Harry lost himself to his art, wrapped up in memories of flying amongst the stars. Wind rushed through his hair, heart a frantic beat as he plummeted and soared above the narrow, cobblestone streets.
Insanity was a pageant. A cruel show of lies in every crooked smile. A flicker of hate in bright, sparkling eyes. A call for help on deaf ears. Loneliness.
He froze, lifting his head to meet Potter’s intense stare. His stomach flipped, and he wanted more than what those bottle-green eyes were offering him. “I’m not even going to answer that.”
Harry closed his eyes, toes curling as his head bent towards the heat of Draco’s mouth. The kisses left him dizzy, made his breath stutter. He gasped, “I don’t want them to release the pictures from our photoshoot.”
whose name Harry didn’t bother to remember, and who had only opened his mouth to offer nasally grunts like some type of wild animal. Malfoy had been eerily silent since Harry walked into the office. From the corner of his eye, he saw the Malfoy he recognised: back pin-straight and rigid, hands clasped neatly over his lap. His expression was carefully masked, but Harry knew him well enough to notice the slight tension that cramped his jaw. The anger hidden in his eyes that spat every bit of vitriol he was trying desperately to hide.
And so Harry pulled the blonde man with no name closer. Chased a pair of lips that were too large, traced a smirk that was too sweet and unfamiliar. His eyes never left Malfoy’s, and Malfoy’s never left his. And perhaps that was why he could almost hear in the back of his mind the slow drawl of Malfoy’s voice whispering
Training had begun, and suddenly Li Shang took off his shirt. Draco had to clamp his mouth shut. He didn’t want to give Potter any more ammunition.
He untied the letter, and rummaged around for a treat in his bedside table. He tossed it, and the owl caught it in its mouth, crunched once, then turned and flew off in a huff.
The video pictures had little notes underneath with numbers of views and the dates uploaded—he'd never noticed that before.
With her fingertips idly brushing over the dirt near her feet, Hermione glanced from Draco to Harry, and back. ‘Malfoy … thank you for all that you did this year. Neville said you were a big help.’
'I don't!' Harry grinned, and dropped the pestle. He came round the kitchen island and bent down to kiss Draco on the mouth. 'I love the idea. Let's do it.'
Draco rolled his eyes, not dignifying that with a response, and pulled out his notebook and quill. He then shut the curtains around him, and opened up to a fresh page.
Er, damn … would he say that? He looked at her in surprise. Merlin, sometimes Harry could swear Hermione was better at Divination than she lets on.
The music shifted to something grand and good for marching, in Harry’s limited musical opinion. Heads turned to face back. So, Harry followed suit.
“Apparently so,” Harry said, blinking at the beautiful invitation. Greengrass? He remembered a Daphne, (a Slytherin?) in their year—must be a relative of hers.
“I’ve long ago accepted that my actions after sixteen made it impossible to have anything I wanted age fifteen and under. In the years since, I’ve had to adjust my … life expectations.”
“Uncle Harry!” She grinned up at him. Her brown hair had been tied up into two pigtail puffs of curls.
Harry’s breath hitched. So there could be a next time, then. He felt … he felt warm all over at the very thought.
Harry smiled to himself and looked around. It was nice up there. Quiet. There were a few couples sitting at identical tables nearby—but not
Sighing, he clicked onto his own friends page, and scrolled through all the photographs of chubby grandchildren and tables filled to the brim with plates of home-cooked food, and found one more relevant to his interests:
He nodded. He thought he understood. Still, he wished there had been another way—a gentler way—to bring them together.
A pit dropped in his stomach. He still couldn’t say the word ‘gay’, and Astoria avoided it too. For his comfort, presumably.
Harry hadn’t realised how much pressure he’d been putting on himself, and how much guilt he carried from being stagnant. He was supposed to have a path in life, a career. To be somebody. To fill the hole that was left over from already accomplishing what had always been his life’s goal: the triumph over Voldemort.
He huffed a dry laugh at himself, being pathetic like this. He stood up straighter and put toothpaste on his toothbrush. He was fine. He brushed his teeth, washed his face with cold water, then took off his clothes to change into the pyjamas.
Draco sent Harry letters. And Harry returned them all unopened. He hadn’t been interested in whatever Draco had to say. He was too sad, and Draco had been a reminder of everything that went
Draco glanced at her—and she smiled back at him, like she was amused by his behaviour. “Well, all right.”
He blearily forced his eyes open and looked around, with his face half-smooshed into the pillow. Awful sunlight had found itself into the room—it wasn't right, nothing should be so bright.
He glanced over all the heads between himself and Potter again—and Potter was biting his lip, shaking his head slow, side-to-side. Mouthing the words now.
That seemed abrupt. Harry felt a little disappointed. He hadn’t even gotten to comment on his journal-mate's advice about one day at a time, all he’d done was pester them about something very personal, about love. Reluctantly, he wrote:
Harry looked around as he waited. Draco had a ball of maroon-coloured yarn on his nightstand, attached to knitting needles with a few inches of completed rows. ‘Oh! Is that gonna be my blanket?’
‘Here,’ said Malfoy, as he lowered his lashes, pinching off a pink butterfly from his wrist and sticking it to the back of Harry’s hand. His fingers were cold where they brushed against Harry’s skin. Goosebumps travelled up his arm.
Draco’s calm expression didn’t change. “Sure. The reckless, brave, idiotic epitome of Gryffindor masculinity, with the fiery, quick-witted, defender of the downfallen epitome of Gryffindor femininity.”
But as the staircase he stood on began to move, Malfoy’s words came back to Harry in a flash. The ones from the bathroom, that he’d overheard spoken to Myrtle.
“I think I get it," Harry said, wincing. "Yeah, maybe it makes sense to wonder. We did sort of dive into this friendship quickly … so I get why you might think it weird. It
A movement caught his eye—but it was only Draco’s pale hand rubbing at his own thigh. He had such lovely hands—pale and narrow and long. Like straight from a Leonardo Da Vinci drawing.
Right. But … But Draco was there because he’d stalked Potter online, and travelled 1400 kilometres to show up at his place of business …
Absently scratching at his chest, he walked over to Hufflepuff table, and sat across from Draco. He had Pansy and Charlotte on either side of himself.
Class ended, and the First Years packed up their things and trickled out of the classroom. The ones that spotted Harry greeted him.
They ate and sipped wine. Astoria kept leaning her head on his shoulder, or laying a hand on his arm, rubbing her thumb gently against his skin. He appreciated the physical contact.
Draco shrugged. He didn't have an opinion. His family had generally gotten painted portraits done. He was sure his father wouldn't approve of cameras, let alone the Muggle kind. The thought made him smile. 'How do I …?'
He picked up speed, sucking Harry in and out, in and out, tentatively swirling his tongue, lapping at him, experimenting. And Harry just kept moaning, kept sucking him. The friction—perfect. Everything—perfect.
Draco had to will himself to relax. He watched the movie, but couldn’t help feeling... No, it didn’t matter what he felt.
Harry pulled up a fraction, and looked down into Malfoy’s sincere eyes. ‘Yeah. Yeah, okay.’ He licked his lips.
Malfoy sucked in his bottom lip, and when he released it, it shined a little with saliva. ‘No. All I want is for them to survive, to live through this.’
—when wizards had only managed a wireless as far as passive entertainment went. And they all still relied on owls and letters rather than these efficient mobile devises all the Muggles seemed to have.
He didn’t know why Malfoy always sat beside him at meals. They never talked. In fact, Malfoy never talked to anyone at the table. He was so bloody subdued—worlds different from the boy he’d been before the war. He rarely ever spoke to Harry at all, except to make occasional passive-aggressive remarks about his trainers, or to comment negatively on his hair. So … not
Draco looked up into his eyes, and saw them sparkle with warmth. Rendered speechless, Draco nodded slowly.
Hermione smiled. ‘It’s not that, Harry, not about forgetting. It’s been a long time, sure. But it’s more like, I can understand him better now. And I can forgive him.’
Harry popped off to one of the shops. The queue took ages, and there was a lot of pointing and mutually-puzzled looks when he tried to order. When Harry finally made his way back to the bins, he spotted Malfoy before Malfoy spotted him.
He laid them on the table, and Harry stared at the cake. It seemed too romantic a thing, for them to share after that conversation. Plus … Malfoy hadn’t actually specified it was for sharing, had he? It might be all for him.
He sat up fast in his bed. If it was lunch, that meant … wasn’t it Wednesday? Had he missed a morning of classes?
'Morning,' Draco said, making himself yawn again by speaking, as he stepped up to the counter, to see for himself what Harry was up to there.
He sort-of wanted to hear the truth from Malfoy’s own mouth, though. But breaching the topic was bound to be awkward, and not something Malfoy wanted to talk about.
Potter frowned over at him, squinting without his glasses and his hair a wild mess—well, wilder than usual. “For last night.”
Harry pulled himself up to his feet, and started off for the water—without waiting for Draco to follow.
Narcissa Malfoy stood quickly, from her chair overlooking the back garden, and rushed towards Draco in an instant. Draco dropped Harry’s hand, hurrying to meet his mum halfway.
Harry navigated under Draco's arm and through the sheets to find that soft space between Draco's legs. He gathered Draco's cock and balls in one hand through the fabric of Draco's nightshirt and lifted it a bit. He thumbed at Draco's head through the cotton.
“You’re right, it’s not.” Harry held his palms to Draco’s cheeks, staring intently at his glinting, silver eyes, still large and round despite the turning of the clock. “It’s a new memory, starting right now. One we’ll continue to create together.”
“Of course I already know that,” he snapped as he whirled around. Potter smiled at him, cruel and mocking, a mirror of Draco’s expression. “I’m tethering on the brink of desperation if I’m here, staring at you of all people.”
When Harry turned around again, Draco was already on the opposite side of the pitch, flying in elegant figure eights.
Harry watched Draco’s eyes drink him up greedily as Harry’s Quidditch robes began to desaturate, bleeding from sky blue into black and grey. The
The only space left between them was in the shape of their lips, and Draco wanted so desperately to connect them, to see exactly how the puzzle would fit, how their opposing worlds could collide into one.
It was the only thing that mattered. Right here, right now, at this moment. The front of his broom knocked into Malfoy’s side, sending him off kilter, just enough for Harry to climb an inch higher, closer, ever so closer to his destination. He and Malfoy were shoulder to shoulder, side by side. He could feel the man’s heavy presence next to him, hear every one of Malfoy’s heaving breaths mix with his own.
glad that you’re here. I thought—I didn’t want to think that you hadn’t made it past eighteen, and after the war, you just left, no one knew anything, and I started to think that maybe I had spent my chance.”
won’t have anything more to say about it, and there'll be no more rumours about you and I being together. The focus will be back on Quidditch games and we can forget any of this ever happened.”
Harry cleared his throat. “But isn’t this worse? It’s like it’s repeating all over again. With the photoshoot, and the articles.”
Blood gushed from his body like the sand from a broken hourglass, and even though he had just over six months left before he turned eighteen, he didn’t have the will nor the strength to do much more than hold a shaking hand over his bleeding ribs. Waves of darkness began to drown his body, it edged its way up his neck and pulled him underwater. It held him down by the shoulders as he fought for fresh air, and this was it, he thought. He had turned the final corner. And just when he was about to close his eyes and surrender into its depths, Potter walked through the door.
Potter was both and none of these things at once. He could engulf and consume him like the burning lick of flames with one touch, only to drown him in a pool of liquid from a bottle-green stare. It was enticing, addicting. And as each night passed with Potter’s eyes pulling him in ever so closer, he became drunk.
He flew above the rest of the players and gazed at the mechanical movements of his team, zig-zagging and swimming through the air as if this was also what they were meant to do. Bulstrode sent a blistering Bludger to Smith, who just missed it by a hair's breadth. Oliver was screaming something at Alicia from the goals. The predictability of it all was comforting, Harry could just about recount the game with his eyes closed.
The Snitch was a miniscule star across the blanket sky, and it glittered in the distance, growing bigger with each push forward, even closer with the stretch of his arm. He was about to hold freedom in the palm of his hands.
Draco raised his head, nosing along Harry’s jaw, following the road up his cheeks, along the bridge of his nose, and coming home to the warmth of Harry’s lips. “That’s not a memory,” he murmured against him, but Draco’s heart swelled in his chest, a beating rhythm that even after all these years, and all these memories they shared, Draco still felt the excitement of discovering something new.
As he picked the sky apart for a hint of gold, he felt the fluttering of the Snitch’s wings from the twine wrapped around his neck. He thumbed the tips of them, a habit which had started since making the necklace. Something flashed in the distance, zapping before Harry’s eyes before disappearing into the thick of the clouds. Harry squinted as he moved closer, snaking behind its trail at a leisurely pace.  He wasn’t yet ready for the game to be over. There was still so much left unsaid between him and Draco, and he didn’t want to waste this opportunity. He had been thinking about this moment since he had first carded his fingers through the soft feathers of Draco’s wing.
kind. I want to physically rough you up with my hands—but, aggressively. I want to punch your face in...
Bludgers curved around him while Quaffles soared through the air in practiced predictability. Harry’s eyes threaded the sky for a glint of gold, but his gaze stuttered on something far off in the distance: messy hair, glittering under the sunshine which draped over Draco’s body like silk.
He chucked the notebook at the bottom of his trunk, and as the rest of the year wafted by with the slow-growing change of the seasons; yellowed, whittled leaves turning to plush, fragile snow beneath his feet—Draco forgot the notebook was even there.
The halls of Hogwarts sang a sombre ballade as he wandered through the darkened corridors. The stairs creaked underneath his feet, and he ran his hands along the dusty balustrades, walking with a fleeting purpose but no destination in mind. It always seemed to be like this, in the blackest of nights, with an array of ashy stars strewn above him—too far out of reach, but close enough to dream. Draco would sneak out of the dungeons, the soothing sounds of the Black Lake faded away from him as he found himself stepping into the silence of the Great Hall.
Draco shook his head, a small smile on his lips. “No, there wasn’t.” He stared at Harry in silence for a moment, before he added, “So where’s the Galleon, then?”
But it also felt familiar, as if they had spent their whole lives getting lost in the touch of each other’s lips. Even if they hadn’t. Even if this was the very first time.
“Fuck off, Potter,” Malfoy said, but there was no venom left in his voice. Harry could feel the hammering of Malfoy’s heart beneath his fingers, and perhaps that said everything his words couldn’t.
—but not when they ganged up on him like this. He could very well handle himself on his own, thanks. Last Week was an Accident. Besides, Thursday’s lesson was all about
Draco walked away without a word being spoken, a silent promise on his lips that he would never return. But that was the thing with pretty promises—he always found a way to break them. He was a creature of habit, after all.
Potter moved above him, his bare body caged him in, and his lips kissed a line down his throat, down his chest, across the ugly splattering of scars down his torso. He kissed all their childish mistakes as if the heat of his lips would wash it all away.
And it was that, the very last expression he saw card over Malfoy’s features, that momentarily dazed Harry. Looking at Malfoy was like staring into the sun: ethereal and blinding all at once. Malfoy’s hands curled between the lapels of his robes—clenched tight, the winning grip that had caught the Golden Snitch—and he
The heavy sound of a camera shutter reverberated around the walls of the studio, breaking Harry from his trance. He snapped his head to the corner of the room where Apolline stood, camera poised in one hand as she waved her fingers at him in the other.
gaining momentum in the air. He fought with his aching muscles to twist his body to right his broom again, and they finally touched the hard ground with a heavy jolt. Malfoy’s weight crumbled over the top of him as they lay on the mud-soaked grass.
Draco placed the Sorting Hat on his head and sat upon the Headmaster’s chair, looking out into the abandoned emptiness all around him.
Harry laughed, not in the least bit amused. “Over my dead fucking body. Do you know what you’re asking of me? I’m not selling myself for anyone’s benefit, least of all the media. As if it hasn’t been bad enough.”
She took out her wand from the sleeve of her blouse and waved it haphazardly at the white wall behind them. Harry had half a mind to duck, or grab his wand from his back pocket to defend himself and Malfoy, who stood bare and vulnerable in nothing but their trousers. But before he could do anything like that, the white compartment began to completely transform.
This time, it was Draco’s fingerprints painting Potter’s skin gold. Not a mirror, or a mirage of empty, stale air. He felt each goosebump, every hair, as he trailed from the ridge of his eyebrows to the frame of his glasses, the point of his lips, and to the sharpness of his collarbone.
And so Harry turned around in a rush of drunken adrenaline and met a pair of warm, chapped lips. Whiskey and mint. He pulled the man closer by his neck, and it was messy, the tip of his nose dug into Harry’s glasses, but Harry bit and sucked at the man’s bottom lip as if he were enjoying it.
When he dried himself off, his skin crimson and torn, Draco hated tattoos just that little bit more.
Their foreheads met, and Draco chased the taste of warmth as they breathed in the same air. “Look at it, Draco.”
Harry’s hands began to move on their own accord, like muscle memory, even though he had never touched Malfoy this way before. But his hands traversed his body as if he knew every dip, every shape and goosebump. He thumbed the cold metal of Malfoy’s belt buckle. Ran his finger across the smooth leather. Dipped a nail into each of the belt holes.
“A very heartwarming speech, Potter. But if I may,” Malfoy turned to the sea of reporters with a distasteful expression on his face, “I’m quite the busy man, and as this is a
Harry’s jaw clenched, and the pain from the fall was nothing compared to the poisonous rush that flooded his body, overtook the chaos in his mind until the only audible thought was a resounding
Deverill sighed, and he looked like a man who expected a fight. “Come on, Potter, don’t blow this out of proportion. It’s just another job, I’ve told you to do it, and you will.”
“Your eyes, dimwit,” he said because if he didn't say it now, he would never have the chance to. Even if it was only fake Potter, with his fake eyes, and his fake smile, and his fake fingers touching Draco's real pulse.
One: his magic surged through his body, a sheer force of power that sent electric shocks from the length of his spine to the tips of his fingers. He smelt it through the air, like burnt rubble and voltaic ozone.
Through the window, warm colours of gold threaded the black sky like streaks of paint. The beginnings of early morning sunlight reminded Draco that he had spent yet another night awake and staring at nothing but his imagination.
Harry sighed. He really should have considered charging people an exorbitant amount of Galleons for uttering his name in every one of their stupid questions. At least Malfoy seemed to share his annoyance.
He lifted his head slightly, focused on the low hum of a voice. He squinted, his vision blurry without his glasses, but the image in front of him was unmistakable. Blonde hair, splayed messily around soft cheeks, grey eyes, swollen and puffy from sleep, skin blushed rose. Draco stared down at him, sat upright with his back against the headboard. “I don’t know what this—” he swallowed, but didn’t stop staring. “I don’t know,” he finished, in nothing more than a sigh.
Harry shrugged his shoulders, the movement pushing their chests flush, their torsos aligned almost perfectly. “Yeah, but this is probably the furthest from where you want to be right now, so I’m sorry to make you uncomfortable.”
“Terribly sorry, Mr. Potter, there’s nothing I can do,” the secretary had said, not even attempting to sound sympathetic. “You can make a formal complaint—though, you must know that we don’t hold any liability. It’s not defamation when there’s no name attached.”
Harry liked to call this game the beginning of the end. They played on the only day during the whole summer that had treacherous storms. In hindsight, it was pretty fitting for the whirlwind that followed.
It was only after the crumbling ashes of death and destruction from the fall of his seventh year, when the things in his notebook suddenly changed.
And so he flowed onto the dance floor, dripping with sweat and liquor, drowning himself in the heat of other bodies. More nameless strangers, and his eager, exploring hands wrapped tight around a small waist. Harry’s fingers dug into soft flesh, and lips—sticky with tequila flavoured lip gloss—pressed into the skin of his neck. He leaned back into another chest with sharp lines and strong hands. Pulled at the lengths of dark blonde hair, spun a tale, whispering words of false intimacy. Of beautiful lies.
Draco turned around, flying in a lazy zigzag, the distance growing between them. As Harry lowered his chest to the broom, gearing himself to catch up with Draco, a Quaffle soared past him, just missing his shoulder by a hair’s breadth. He whirled around to the goalposts, where Oliver was glaring at him.
stands, and this was the very moment Harry had been waiting for. Without a second thought, he moved on instinct, his hands pulling Draco towards him, lifting Draco off his broom so that his body fell forwards into Harry's chest, legs wrapping around Harry’s hips, their chests flush. Draco’s now-abandoned broom began falling to the ground, spiralling below them until it landed on the pitch below.
His mother said he was ashamed, but Draco didn’t agree. If he was ashamed, he would have stayed exactly where he’d been; shunned, spat on, drowning in the deep pits of misery.
remained innocently unopened. If he left it there, he could pretend it never happened. Opening and reading it would only disturb the suspension of disbelief he wrapped around himself like a safety blanket. It would only make him remember things he didn’t want. But that didn’t change the fact that everyone else in the bloody country had read it. Harry really didn’t favour either option, but he was backed into a corner.
and everything Malfoy ever did was to spite him. And he wanted—even more with a poisonous desperation—to touch him. To get into his space and pull his hair until it
Malfoy said nothing but gave him a quick once over, the expression on his face unreadable, as if that alone was enough to justify his presence. He turned a judgemental gaze to the rest of the bathroom and wrinkled his nose in distaste. “This place is appalling,
“They say loneliness can kill a person, but I don’t think that quite applies when you’ve done it to yourself.”
Harry laughed as he felt that familiar rush soar through him. In a blink of an eye he was higher than the hills stretching over the horizon. Icy air and soft pillows of cloud alit a trail of goosebumps along his skin as he dipped between the notches of blue sky.
Rain, wind, and thunderous skies. The higher he flew, the more black the world became as rain pummelled his face and cracked a thin line across his glasses. He climbed the skies, his body burned and screamed at him to slow down; he pushed on, his chest flush to the broom.
Malfoy released the grip on his wrist and his hands fell heavily onto the leather padding of Harry’s shoulders, so unbearably close to the bare skin beneath his collarbone. His fingers tapped the same thumping rhythm of Malfoy’s heart.
Deverill gave him a disapproving look, and Harry would be lying if he said he didn’t enjoy the rush in his veins that only came when Harry was this riled up. He was reeling from it, the memory of that very game with the
Potter crashed to his knees, his hands hovered over Draco’s ribs. He was completely drenched, soaked head to toe as if he too, had been drowning with no chance of escape. “I—what happened to you?” Water cascaded down his body and fell to the floor in a soothing pitter-patter. Draco tried to match his erratic heartbeat to the sound.
This face was not a stranger, it didn’t blur with the ones that had come and gone just like all the others.
Two: his Firebolt stopped its plummeting descent and shot up towards his outstretched hand like a magnet.
“You’ve never written anything in the notebook before,” Draco mused, resting the side of his head in the crook of Harry’s neck.
“Please.” Malfoy looked at him as if he was expecting something, but Harry only stayed silent. Seconds ticked by, thick ropes of tension binding Harry frozen as Malfoy’s words echoed in his mind. He wanted, so desperately, to give Malfoy what he asked, but something held him back—made Harry choke around the syllables of Malfoy’s first name. And just before he had the chance to open his mouth and taste his name for the first time, the moment ended. A sudden collapse like a stone wall turning to rubble beneath his feet.
Malfoy’s nostrils flared, like a horse, but a very angry horse that wore arousing attire. He liked men, not horses. Malfoy was a horse, and he hated horses.
Potter, with his familiar mess of black hair, covering the scar he knew was hidden there. Time hadn’t carved its mark on him yet; his eyes were still that same burning cavern as the day they had met. Draco swallowed. Looked away and looked back. Potter was covered in them. Tattoos. The vile patterns of ink that stained his skin. Draco eyed some place far above Potter’s head and fought against the taste of bile. Because Potter looked
Across the dance floor, bathed in a warm golden glow, was Malfoy. He wore a dark green suit that shimmered under the harsh strobing lights, and Harry seethed, because he somehow managed to look so effortless amongst the thrum of bodies. He wasn’t even dancing with anyone, and yet the whole room seemed enthralled by him, magnetised to his body. He was playing the game of nonchalance and sex, as if he didn’t know exactly where the cameras were, as if the dark look in his eye wasn’t about winning or losing.
Potter leaned over him, his head tilted to the side. An expression akin to curiosity was painted across his face, and Draco had to swallow down the urge to do something stupid. Instead, he lay there motionless, staring up at Potter who silently eyed him as if he were seeing him for the very first time, too. And Draco, in his state of desperation, didn’t seem to care that his mind was playing tricks on him, just as long as Potter would stare at him like that for a little longer.
an eternal, visceral sting. But Draco was a desperate man, shackled to the mistakes of his past. And so each time he stepped into the shower, he’d raise the temperature until the skin on his arm blistered.
Draco moved closer, and as the sky made space for them, Harry’s body thrummed. Draco’s scent engulfed Harry; he inhaled lemon and wood. He was greedy for more, so he moved an inch closer.
his Mother had been talking about—a spark of curiosity, the excitement of discovering something new.
Blood rushed all the way to Harry’s head. The expanse of green enveloped around them as the Snitch careened teasingly above their heads. Harry’s fingers brushed fluttering wings, but Draco’s leather-bound hand knocked into his, both of them fighting to wrap their fists around gold.
Draco continued speaking, even though, at that moment, he looked like he’d rather be anywhere but the constricting heat of Harry’s room. “I wanted to try out for the
This time, Harry stepped forward, but there was still a world of emptiness between them. An emptiness marked by years long gone, of experiences, and knowledge, and memories of each other they did not share.
But here, in this strange moment, Draco couldn’t stop looking, couldn’t stop listening. He hung on to every beat with bated breath. Enraptured, completely and utterly lost. As if he were slipping with nothing to keep him afloat.
Harry bit Draco’s bottom lip and ran his tongue over it, humming into the sweet noises Draco made. “I know what I want. And I really,
and he never had a problem with that before. Except for last week. But Last Week was an Accident, so it didn’t count.
git in sexy clothes. Did someone spike his drink? He slid off the barstool and swatted Bulstrode’s spiky fingers away from his knee. The room wasn’t spinning,
Harry tried to pull his body off the ground, but his muscles shook with the weight and he sent a curdling glare at the tosser who was already making good work on his hair with wandless cleaning charms. He cracked his back as he stood up on wobbly legs, rolling his shoulders to ease the pain.
Malfoy sighed; it ruffled the ends of both of their hair. “What could you possibly be sorry about? Wasn’t I the one who got us here?”
Harry could play a good game in any weather, but it was games spent under the soft glare of the sun that he craved most. Sweat along his brow and down the nape of his neck—it reminded him of lazy afternoons spent at the Burrow with everyone he loved, back when he could wrap his arms around Ginny when she scored a goal and get distracted by the taste of her lips. Back when everything was quiet and simple.
It was cold tiles and wet skin all over again. Except this time it was so much better because it was happening right before his eyes. Unfolding, unravelling with every touch. Harry wanted and he craved so desperately. In the light of day, his mind was foggy—not with alcohol, but with Malfoy.
Chittock’s segment on the wireless should have been the last straw before it got any more out of hand. If Hermione knew just how rash Harry’s thought process had been yesterday, she would’ve berated him for his carelessness, his lack of control. Ron, on the other hand, would’ve rolled his eyes and said something along the lines of:
Malfoy glanced at him, an eyebrow raised in a familiar question that hadn’t escaped Harry’s mind since this whole game started.
Harry laughed, and he felt the sound vibrate against Draco’s chest as he leaned over him. At this angle, Draco’s back was flat to the wood,  his hair spilling around the nose of the broom as they began their rapid descent to the grass.
“Potter—” Deverill massaged the sides of his temples, and Harry couldn’t even find it within himself to feel sorry for him if he, too, was believing the
“I was sloshed! And pissed off! And it was you—” he slammed his finger into the middle of Malfoy’s chest. The same spot he had punched all those months ago in front of a stadium of people. The same spot he had wanted so desperately to touch through the lines of an iridescent shirt. “—
Harry couldn’t help a small laugh escape him. Malfoy caught it, lapped at his laugh with a slow lick of his tongue. “You’re a bit strange,” Harry breathed.
“Yes, Father,” he mumbled, even though he knew it was terribly undignified to speak in a manner that was not clear and crisp, consonants cracking through the air.
Something crossed Malfoy’s face, then, something like realisation. A crashing, burning realisation. The moment ended as he moved away, leaving Harry to chase after him—mouth parted, waiting for their lips to meet again. But Malfoy held his hand against Harry’s cheek, stopping him from moving any closer. Harry swallowed, licked his lips, and caught gunmetal grey eyes.
As he ran his fingers along his skin, the memories seeped from the deep rivets of black ink. They surged up his shoulder, along his chest, and into the beating rhythm in his breast.
“Well, at least one of us can see,” Harry quipped, just so he could see the softness play on Draco’s features again.
Harry stared at the looming shape of the door as light from the hallway crept between the hinges, crawling from underneath the threshold and into the darkness of his bedroom. A tease of what he was missing on the other side. Of what he had lost just after he had found it, like gold slipping through the palm of a leather-bound hand.
It was taking too long; he felt restless. He wanted to speed forward to the moment when he could bend low—feel the muscles tighten in his legs, a fiery pulse of power—before releasing the tension in his body and soaring into the sky. But his feet were still planted solidly on the ground, pointing him towards the
“I’m here to save you because you refuse to save yourself.” The green in Potter’s eyes flashed gunmetal grey. Draco felt a bit sick to his stomach.
“That is because you are stuck in a juncture. You cannot play on both sides of a war, Mr. Malfoy. That is how you sort the strong from the weak, you may be far from brave, but that does not make you weak.”
He wasn’t refined. Or precise. Or elegant. Instead, he was an electric thrum pulsing through the air. A ball of energy and power in the way he moved. And although Malfoy could fly a broom alright, he didn’t know the sky like Harry did.
When Draco first opened the notebook, he didn’t know what he had expected. Perhaps he expected something magical, a thrum of pure power pulsing through his body, righting all the wrongs of the world with the very fibres of plain parchment. Perhaps he expected one of those
Harry’s eyes narrowed. “What’s in it for you?” From his peripheral, he saw Skeeter’s secretary move in closer, Quick-Quotes Quill unsheathed and ready to strike. He knew with a sinking feeling in his gut that some twisted fabrication of this conversation would be retold for all of Wizarding Britain before sunrise tomorrow.
Draco traced his fingers along the yellowed parchment, swirling across the letters of black ink, written forevermore within the pages of a small leather notebook. Entwined with yarn. Threaded with a gold key.
Harry threw his sweaty Quidditch robes onto the kitchen table and switched on the kettle with a heavy sigh. Screeching sounds filled the silence of Grimmauld Place as the water began to boil, and Harry couldn’t stop thinking about his conversation with Deverill from that morning.
Time seemed to move in slow motion, his mind and body disjointed. Through the black clouds, another broom had collided head on with his Firebolt, sending both brooms tumbling to the ground below. He held onto one end of the Snitch’s wings for dear life, and it was as if, for a long exhilarating second, he was floating in the air with no broom to hold him up. Malfoy was on the opposite side of the Snitch, gripping the other wing. Then, the second of suspension elapsed, and they were both plummeting through the sky.
Apolline had just called him dense; he should focus on that, and the way Malfoy’s cheeks coloured as she said Harry was his type. “Are we starting any time soon?” Harry blurted out.
The ground edged closer, a blanket of green that mirrored the large sky above it. Harry shut his eyes, outstretched his hand, and in that moment of blindness, three things happened.
Draco huffed in annoyance, wrapped his fingers tightly around his hawthorn wand, and muttered the new Charm Flitwick had taught them. He watched on with a certain sort of pleasure as the ink sank into the fibres of the parchment. Disappearing.
He shook his head. “You being here all year is a false hope. There’s nothing hopeful about saying a pretty version of goodbye.”
So he did, and Harry found himself staring at a grumbling goblin head, unsure of what it meant. But by the vicious look on Malfoy’s face, he knew he had made one of the most piss-poor decisions of his life, one he couldn’t even blame on alcohol.
Potter shook his head in what looked to be bemusement, but when he spoke again, he sounded dejected. “I’m sorry. This time, it wasn’t me.”
Harry stood in front of Malfoy with his arms crossed. He sized him up quickly—very quickly, just a quick glance up and down, and then a few more glances, just for good measure—because he was an ugly git wearing ugly clothes. He wore an
Just as he stepped closer, the sound of fast-approaching footsteps prompted him to turn around. Two men were there, wheeling a gurney on the pavement towards the entrance. As they passed him, Harry caught a glimpse of what they were pushing—or should he say
into his mouth. Their cocks were both hard, sandwiched between their stomachs as they kept snogging. Draco gyrated against him, making friction—he couldn’t help it.
What was he doing? Maybe he should’ve waited until he prepared what to say, because … because he had no idea of what he wanted to say. This was so like him, rushing into things he wasn’t ready for, he thought, attempting to scold himself.
The water pushed Potter into him. Draco’s fingertips collided with Potter’s side. Potter took hold of Draco’s wrist and tugged at him—like he wanted his attention.
He licked his lips, and absently rubbed his palms over his trousers. “With Harry Potter. I shouldn’t have gotten involved.”
Malfoy rose to his feet, with fingertips on his desk and expression shuttered. He looked a bit like a spooked cat in posture—if the man’d had fur it’d be standing on end.
Harry laughed under his breath. 'Yeah, all right.' Then he recapped the spin-the-bottle, the bathroom confession, and then the amazing snogging in Draco's dorm room. He felt a bit floaty, just talking about it.
A shy smile grew on Draco's mouth, and Harry returned it with a grin. Draco looked away, shaking his head, and biting his lip to keep from smiling bigger. He was really bloody adorable, Harry thought.
Harry set his quill down, and turned to her. She was so small; they were pretty much eye-to-eye with him sitting, her standing. ‘Hi Charlotte.’
At that, the owls arrived to the Great Hall, delivering the morning post. Their feathered bodies obscured the bright blue sky depicted on the enchanted ceiling, as the air filled with the sound of beating wings and students' cries of excitement.
Eventually, Draco decided to explain himself. He owed her that. “I hoped—I thought it could work. I really believed I might be able to have sex with you … Because I do love you, with all of my heart, and you’re beautiful—you’re my best friend.”
Harry swallowed, and inwardly he was panicking. Why did he have to say that? Now he had to follow up that sentence with something. Anything.
Did he? “Well... that was through jealousy and sheer, stubborn force of will. Plus, I was a bit of a git, wasn’t I?”
Ah, bollocks. Maybe Draco had a point, there. They were both ridiculous, weren't they? 'Whatever. Blue, then.' The sky on a nice day playing Quidditch. Sure.
Harry was … touched, actually. ‘It’s all right. I get it.’ It was one life pitted against many, after all.
, you know you don’t have to tread too carefully, right? I like you. I like you even when you’re cross with me—telling me you hate me and that my face is annoying.” He laughed, a self-deprecating sort of laugh. “I like you even when you’re ignoring me, for
Harry led him to the Black family tapestry. Draco’s eyes passed over it all, with mouth set in a firm line.
So—slowly—Draco turned the page. Glancing from the ghost, and then down at the blank parchment. Well. This was rather odd, wasn’t it?
“People like your father, Draco. I don’t. Most people don’t, not anymore. Prejudice exists, yes, but there’s also a whole month dedicated to queer pride now. There a parade, even. The Muggles run it, but I'm sure countless Witches and Wizards attend as well.”
They settled in at the wide, long wooden table while a house-elf brought them two mugs of tea. Draco nodded his thanks.
He turned, and Draco saw that Potter looked about as affected by that display as he felt. Potter’s eyes were red-rimmed, his expression a bit baffled. Potter had to clear his throat before saying, “Yeah?”
‘Yeah,’ Harry whispered, his expression sobering into a soft smile, as his eyes practically glittered with reflections of fairy light. Then Harry leaned in closer, in order to kiss Draco again. And Draco smiled, as he closed the distance.
'You apologise too much.' Draco toed off his shoes and walked off towards his bedroom. He whirled around, just realising, 'I don't have a spare room.'
Harry simultaneously felt shock and relief. Shock to see entries in his own journal, relief to read something similar to his own private thoughts and feelings. Finally. After it seemed like everyone in Hogwarts was happy except for him.
So, Harry hounded Malfoy with a barrage of questions, like, ‘How is your family?’ (Fine), and, ‘What do you most want to do when this is all over?’ (Go back to work), as he watched.
Draco pulled out of the embrace, locking eyes with Harry in the mirror again. “Yeah. Yeah, let’s do that.”
Draco swiped his palm over his face, then folded the letter up carefully. He tucked it into the breast pocket of his pyjamas, and climbed back into bed.
“May your love grow and grow with each passing day, may you lean on each other in times of trouble. May you feel nothing but blessed happiness in each other’s arms.”
Potter was silent for a beat, and Draco wondered if he’d even heard him. Or, perhaps, if Potter was upset by the question, though he couldn’t fathom why he would—
He shrugged and tried to look cheerful. “I have other friends, you know. I’m sure someone can take me in.”
‘No idea,’ Draco answered, wiggling the tips of each of Harry’s fingers now, as if he were testing their flexibility. ‘You?’
Draco licked at his bottom lip again. ‘Is it too forced to just kiss you? Or should we go on a date first?’
He sucked Harry in deeper, letting his cock rub against the roof of his mouth. Deeper, deeper—he sucked him in as far as Draco could handle. And, shit, Harry was doing the exact same to him. He had to force himself to keep from thrusting into Harry’s mouth—
Draco, fool as he was, wearing only a towel that’d dipped low to show part of his arse, just sat frozen in this incomprehensible moment, as rain continued to beat against their window.
Was there? With all the snogging that had gone on in Hufflepuff, snogging was very much on his mind.
‘I know,’ Harry smiled as they spun in a slow circle. ‘Hey, you never did tell me when you first thought of kissing me.’
Harry grinned, and wrestled the cock out of Draco's fist (which in itself was a very weird thing to think too much about). 'You need it.'
Draco clamped his mouth shut, and watched a yacht slowly make its way in the distance. 'I'm not talking about clown sex with Harry Potter.'
She huffed. “Have fun moping, darling.” She kissed him hard on the cheek, and then, she left him. The dock shifted and creaked with her exit. And when she was gone, the silence returned.
Malfoy pulled him up, then dropped his hands. Harry felt their absence. He brought his own hands together, entwining his fingers, to compensate. Then they left their things on the table, and walked out of the library together. Harry’s legs were a bit noodle-y, but he managed all right without having to do something embarrassing like grab onto Malfoy’s arm. Instead, he focused on his breathing.
Harry found Malfoy surrounded by his friends, Pansy Parkinson, Theo Nott, and Blaise Zabini—leaning back against a table. He was smiling at them, saying something.
A break in the inward flow of students came, so Harry slipped out without a word, and stalked off to his classroom to teach a bunch of Fifth Years some Defence.
And yet, the other students didn’t act like it was depressing. At all. They smiled, joked, cheered for the First Years, leaned over to kiss the person beside them (again—
, of course, the Catalans came. That's why the language is so common here, I guess. Berber pirates, and, er, the Ottomans came later. Spain took over in the 1700s, and Ibiza only just gained its autonomy in 1983.'
It was a nice room; everything in light coffee tones. A large window looked out onto the crowded beach, and the beautiful, blue Balearic Sea sparkling in the light.
“We believe Septima meant it to force Draco's secrets out of him.” She inhaled sharply. “Because, in similar vein to the Mirror of Erised, this artefact reveals only the secret desires of your heart.”
A breathy laugh. 'I'm sure every sort of jail is unpleasant.' He was lovely—even with red eyes and wet clumpy eyelashes.
Harry exhaled. “Yeah, we don’t have to talk about it.” He shot Malfoy a smile, and fiddled with his napkin.
“Happy Christmas,” she said through another toothy grin, handing him his things in a nondescript (thank Merlin) white bag.
Then, the path opened up into a... a parking lot. The grey and paved sort, filled with motor vehicles.
Harry nodded, and managed a smile. He flung himself at her on the couch, and squeezed her tight—with their legs in all directions and Harry almost falling off the couch.
He cast one appreciative glance beyond the stretch of lawn to the blue-green gently rippling water of the lake, before following the wooden signs that pointed him towards the hiking trails.
Oh God, and what if he hadn’t? What if he hadn’t been quick enough? What if that had been the end of Draco Malfoy like it had been the end for Vincent Crabbe?
The smile returned. 'Shall we break for lunch? Oh! I suppose you haven't had fresh fish or seafood yet, yeah? That's another requirement.'
Harry tilted his head so their cheeks pressed together. His breath came in heavy bursts against Draco's ear. 'Draco Malfoy,' he said under his breath, and there was a hint of amusement and disbelief in his voice.
Harry dropped Draco’s hand after giving it one squeeze, and moved to sit on the sofa, bouncing a little in place. “Sit with me.”
After breakfast, no one else from Hogwarts had come down yet, so Draco went outside to see the lake. Mist still hovered on its surface, and the space smelled nice—like wet leaves and evergreen. He breathed it in, and felt his tension ease up a bit. The gentle lapping of the water against the rocks on the shoreline had a soothing rhythm. He liked it here, he decided.
Next was Formentera … shots of the two of them sprawled out on the beach, with sunglasses. There was one with the two of them together—heads pressed together and smiling.
He’d chosen his outfit with great care, though. An all-black 3-piece Muggle suit, with a black wizarding cape over top. He’d cleaned his glasses, even—the nice ones with the tortoiseshell plastic frames. He’d even tried to tame his black curls into something presentable (really they just flopped over on one side rather than in all directions). Perhaps he put so much effort in because he knew the wedding would be posh, and, for some incomprehensible reason, he wanted to prove that he could be just like them. Though, he hadn’t a clue as to why he should care. Maybe he didn’t. It was all very odd.
Potter deserved so much better than his past. And Draco hoped Potter was happier now, now that the war was over and he’d never have to go back to his aunt and uncle’s ever again.
“Yes,” Draco said, leaning in to kiss Harry again. He pulled back, with eyes bright. “And I don’t give a shit about The Prophet.”
Draco opened his eyes, and saw his employees staring at him with matching looks of amused delight. He nodded. 'Britney,' he said, in way of explanation.
Harry bit his bottom lip, and closed his journal. He wanted to know who the person on the other end was, quite badly.
And it wasn’t as if he’d like to juggle a boyfriend, potentially falling in love, when he already had a beautiful, perfect, yet dying, wife at the same time. No, he wanted to be with Astoria, wholly committed to her, and only her. Platonically, obviously. He wanted to make her last years as perfect as possible.
'Oh. Don't have either—don't think I’ll ever be able to figure out that stuff,' Draco said truthfully. Harry deflated, looking disappointed. 'Ah, but Pansy ...'
Four-person and two-person tables were spaced throughout the room, decorated with white linen tablecloths and an arrangement of dried flowers in little white ceramic vases. It was already nearly full, both with his classmates and Muggle patrons. He spotted Potter already there, sitting with Weasley and Longbottom. Potter was frowning, leaning forward, telling his friends something.
Narcissa Malfoy was stood in the wide archway that separated the two rooms, with Draco hovering nervously just behind her. Dressed in what was probably very expensive embroidered pearl robes, and with a large leather handbag to match, Mrs Malfoy gestured towards the sofa. Her expression seemed … faintly amused. 'Please. I won't keep you both long.'
Harry peeked again. And, yeah, Draco Malfoy did appear to be sitting on his bed. And Harry’s bed, of course, was in Gryffindor Tower. A place that Draco was not able to get into, on account of the password. ‘You’re not here,’ Harry pointed out helpfully.
He let them hug him, before Harry said, ‘Let’s get on the train.’ He’d had just about enough of feeling everyone’s eyes on him.
And, lastly, there was Draco curled up and comfortable on the hotel bed with their mountain of snacks in front of him.
Harry shrugged, looking down at his half-chopped onion. ‘It doesn’t really bother me. My glasses might help a little, too.’
Laughing, Draco squeezed at Harry’s shoulder. ‘Eat anything you like, there’re leftovers from last night still.’
Draco blinked at him, not comprehending for a moment. Harry looked flushed and nervous and daring, all at once. Hungry, even? Without a word, Draco unfolded the blanket around himself, revealing his tented boxers.
Draco scrambled to sit up. He wasn’t expecting that answer, because he couldn’t imagine someone dating Harry Potter being that fucking stupid—'Fucking bastard. Fuck. Harry, I'm … shit.' He's sorry? Merlin,
Looking down at his hands on his lap, realising they were gripping tightly onto his knees, Harry wilfully relaxed them and leaned back against the sofa.
He settled onto it, like he had the day before. This time letting his legs dangle over the other side, over the steep edge of the hill.
‘Am I married?’ He huffed out a breathy little laugh. ‘No.’ Draco seemed to blink more rapidly at that, looking off at the far wall. ‘I’ve been single for about five years, now.’
'Mm. Very nice. I think mine's yellow.' He thought of sunshine, sunflowers, and … well, blond hair. Glimmering in the sunshine, like … at a Quidditch match. (Rein it in, Harry.) Yellow
Harry cupped Draco's cheek, brushing his thumb over the smooth skin there. He let his hand fall to Draco's neck, over his collarbone, and to his chest. His fingers flitted over the scar tissue, wet and slippery. And Harry allowed himself to look down, to see the raised scars. He traced them down, followed their path, to a patch of dark blond wiry hairs, and Harry took a step back in order to get a better look. Draco's penis, a bit darker than the rest of his pale skin, and half-hard, was just out of his finger's reach.
Draco smiled, exhaling hard through his nose. Okay, that was good. Harry hadn’t completed weirded Draco out, then.
The door to the bathroom was at their immediate right, and a closet to their left. Potter kept walking through and stopped to look at the room. Draco closed the door softly behind himself, and turned towards Potter’s tense back. Why was he so tense?
“I … thanks, ‘Mione.” Harry took a breath. “Okay … it’s just—I think it might not be working out. With her.” He winced.
He couldn’t keep playing it safe though, right? Besides... Harry knew him. Knew all the awful parts of him, he’d experienced them first hand. He’d been at the mercy of them, time and time again. And it’d never really broke him—never pushed him away for good. And now... now, despite everything, Harry claimed to
The two of them stood to snog in the centre of the circle. A few people whistled. Harry looked at Parvati and Terry, and yeah—they were snogging. It wasn’t really very interesting, and, just like the last time they’d played, it seemed to go on for too long.
They’d reached the back door of the resort, and Draco didn’t know what to say... so he opened the door, and they navigated their way in, which was a little ungraceful with Potter’s refusal to drop his arm, so they had to shimmy in on an angle.
in my life … but I don’t think it’s been in a good way. I don’t take risks, I just go through each day the same way. I teach the same structured lessons and I chat with Neville about plants, and Ron and Hermione about their kids … because I don’t really
Harry smiled, biting at his bottom lip, and nodded. Then he put toothpaste onto his toothbrush and began to brush. While Harry did that, Draco washed his hands in the sink.
Harry nodded slowly. Fuck … that was exactly what Malfoy was. It was incredible really … that Malfoy was that non-judgmental person for him, a person who knew so many of Harry’s secrets and didn’t lecture him or treat him like he was damaged. Malfoy … after everything.
(There is some Italian and Spanish spoken in this chapter, you don't really need to know what the words mean.)
Malfoy's had only about three redeeming, positive moments: his ‘I can’t be sure’ at the Manor, lowering his wand with Dumbledore, and those bloody stickers with that First Year. And Harry didn’t know why he ever even cared about those stickers. They didn’t change anything, not really.
‘Well … I suppose I … could stay a little longer …' He furrowed his brow. ‘I’ve a board meeting I can’t miss on the 16th, but other than that …'
It’d been about fifteen minutes, and the onions were sufficiently cooked. Harry glanced at Draco, noticed the bandage on his arm as he lifted the glass up to his mouth. Harry flicked off the range—the onions could sit for a minute. ‘Oh, ah, it’s been two hours, we can take our bandages off.’
Draco shrugged, and took another mouthful of food. Potter didn’t know what he was saying, he was just trying to be nice again. Draco might even get used to this Gryffindor kindness... it was a nice change of pace, really. Refreshing, even. Merlin, he might try it out himself sometime.
Malfoy’s finger breached his own arsehole, and he fucked himself on his own finger—stretching himself open. Then, another finger. His thumb brushed over Harry’s tip. It was … a lot to watch. And to feel. Harry had to concentrate very hard on
Merlin. They were … friends? Pansy never mentioned any of this. And she should have. Harry was … Draco caught himself, he was thinking "mine", but that wasn't fair or true in the slightest.
He sniffled, and stepped up to the side of the bed. Through a bit of wetness in his eyes, he saw the wrinkled little guy in Hermione’s arms. Tiny closed eyes, delicate little nose and rosebud mouth. Bald as could be. “He’s perfect.”
The last time they were in a bathroom alone together—his awful mind reminded him. He shook off the thought, and marched up to a sink, and looked at himself in the mirror. He was determined to get through this without a total meltdown, without embarrassing himself completely in front of Harry Potter.
, he’d almost said. Though that would be an outright lie. He didn’t know why he felt so defensive. And, fuck, there was something more important to talk about than his relationship with Ginny.
Because … because they were both very much drunk and it didn't do to kiss. Not here. Not now. (If that was what Harry was thinking—it may
Draco took himself by the hand, and rubbed his cock over Harry's chin, circled around Harry's lips, and then entered him—entered Harry's mouth.
“Yeah, well... I just, wasn’t really in the mood for a party, as it turns out,” Potter said. “Uh... Were you crying?”
Then, Potter did it again. The fish were all swarming around his fingers. A little one tried to take a bite. Potter laughed again, and pulled his hand away.
‘Ah. A laptap,’ he remarked, placing his lemonade down on the round wooden table, as he un-crossed and re-crossed his legs.
He sucked at his bottom lip. Yeah. It was best to just … yeah. ‘I didn’t like the way you looked at Cedric Diggory in Fourth year.’
It seemed Molly and Ginny were dealing with their grief by cooking, Harry observed with a fond ache.
She looked at him approvingly. “Yes, I didn’t think you would be involved with that rubbish. Your classmates will be late risers this morning, I reckon. Maybe you can have a word with them, in case they plan a repeat performance tonight. I do need my sleep.”
Harry leaned over to look at the page with a frown. Didn’t look very interesting—lots of symbols and diagrams in tiny font.
Hearing the kettle start up broke Harry out of his stupor. He walked into the kitchen, spotted Draco there with his back to him—pulling two mugs from the cupboard, and setting them down on the counter. Harry came up behind and wrapped his arms around Draco, bringing their bodies flush together as he nuzzled into the back of Draco's neck. He smelled so good—he always smelled so good.
‘What were you talking to Malfoy about earlier?’ he wondered aloud, interrupting whatever creature she’d been prattling on about. Thankfully he’d managed to speak quietly enough so no one would overhear him asking. (He was blurting stuff out far too much lately.)
She leant closer to him, grinning. ‘Well apparently he’s a fucking DJ down in Ibiza, and he’s got his own YouTube channel.’
Draco smiled. ‘Well, to put it simply, no one knows. There are theories—theories that magic may be biological. Like something in our brains, in our blood, in our genetic make-up. But autopsies, blood tests, and DNA analyses have failed to find anything that separates us from Muggles yet.’
.” Harry smiled. And then kissed him once more. “Okay I’ve got a question for you. And feel free to say ‘no’ if it makes you uncomfortable at all.”
‘Yeah, of course.’ Harry squeezed Malfoy in tighter, and kissed the top of his head. ‘Will you stay here? Spend quarantine with me?’
Ginny. She was coming at him, big brown eyes sparkling, and pink lips smiling. Ginny was familiar, he told himself. She was undeniably
She exhaled, long and slow. “I don’t mean to … put a damper on things. I’m just worried that you might fall in love, and he’s got a wife. I don’t want to see you get hurt.” Who said anything about love?
He shook his head, and looked out at the water. ‘And I take it as one. But I still did some terrible—’
They stepped quietly into Hermione’s hospital room. There she was, lying on the bed with a mess of dark curls framing her tired face on the pillows. Tired, yes. But beautiful. In her arms was a tiny bundle, and she was gazing lovingly at it—at Hugo.
Draco rubbed at his chin. ‘I don’t know … I think I must’ve got it in our fourth year. At the World Cup.’
Draco let out a breathy laugh. “No. It’s not stupid.” Harry smiled a little. "And I like... wearing them,” Draco admitted, with a shrug.
He watched Weasley throw an arm around Potter’s shoulders and lead him off someplace, whispering into his ear. Draco took another bite out of his marshmallow, wondering what that was all about.
‘Yeah, it’s brilliant,’ he said enthusiastically. Truthfully he’d probably say the same for any colour at this point. ‘So you don’t … knit with magic?’ He remembered the first time he saw Molly’s knitting needles working all on their own. He’d been so awed by it, at the time.
What else was there, though? What had he liked in school? Not Potions, not Herbology, not Care of Magical Creatures or Divination.
With the gentle drop of a fork onto a plate, and the sound of chair dragging softly on the floor, Malfoy was getting up, and making to walk out the Great Hall.
Potter switched off the telly without warning, and the silence was startling. Draco’s heart started to speed up. He didn’t know if this meant Potter wanted to talk or not. Maybe tell him not to try anything in the night? Don’t smother him with a pillow? Draco bit back a sigh.
Harry wrapped the ugly scarf around his neck. “Now we’ve each got a team to root for. We can sort of … compete.”
It was done. They pulled apart and Terry looked a little rumpled. He walked back to his seat in a daze.
'So, yeah. As I was saying, I'm so sorry last night was such a disaster.' He sighed heavily. 'All around, really. From the shouting match with my ex-fiancé to, er, when I was dancing with you. I, um, well I think I was drunk and might've gone too far there.'
A golden dew, sunny raindrops. Harry was still there in the sweet taste of morning. The warm touch of sunrise.
Deverill wasn’t lying when he said the photography team was small, because when Harry stepped into the large studio at exactly ten o’clock, it was to find Malfoy and a no-nonsense looking woman waiting for him. The woman stared at him up and down and clucked her tongue, muttering something in what sounded like French, if the way Malfoy’s lips lifted in an amused smile was anything to go by.
If his first fault was not realising the consequences of his actions, then his step towards betterment would be to develop his self-awareness skills. Now, he could have given himself a moment to identify the pros and cons about engaging with Malfoy. For instance:
“Real enough to touch, Mr. Potter.” He turned to Apolline, eyes wide. “What? Did you think you’d be having your photos taken against a white wall? Do you have no
Draco sighed and stared at Potter in silence for a while, his expression unreadable. “Shouldn’t you have a question for me now?”
The owl just cocked its head up at Harry, staring at him through narrowed eyes in an expression that reminded him of Hermione’s
Because that had to mean something, didn’t it? Draco keeping the wing as if it meant more to him than he let on. Something more than walking away without a backwards glance.
Harry reached down and grabbed it, thumbing it between his fingers; it felt soft and silky against the rough calluses of his hand. He was reminded of blonde hair, the feeling of running his hands from Draco’s scalp to the short hairs at his nape. An endless expanse of smoothness, of pale milkiness. Touch as soft as a feather.
Potter chuckled; it was a nice sound. Draco wanted to make him do that again before he realised that he didn’t actually know what Potter sounded like when he laughed. Draco bit down on his lip; the prospect of change was too little too late. Years of animosity cultivated by an ill-fated handshake did that to a person.
Self-preservation was the number one rule for a Malfoy, his father often said. Out of all the rules, that one was the easiest to follow, so Draco didn’t quite understand why he found himself forgetting.
