It was partially due to these strange glances that he invited the eldest sister to come by the Flamel home at some point, to which she was understandably hesitant. However, it took mere moments between Gabrielle asking if she could come too and Harry replying that he saw no issue with that for the young woman to agree, and very quickly it seemed he was relaying the name and coloring of his owl so that she can keep a lookout for any correspondence.
Harry could understand that there was a bit of a security breach being had inside Tom’s head, but still couldn’t quite understand how it had happened or why the man was so insistent on it being because of his horcrux gaining a body. Really, the man was terrible at explaining things to him, it would be so much easier for the both of them if he was honest. It would certainly help their communication skills.
“What do you reckon that was about?” He whispered, squinting slightly at the man’s retreating back as Draco snorted.
Groaning a second time, Nicolas stuffed the letter back away and took off towards the sparkling towers of the academy, purpose in his step as Rèmy shouted a rushed goodbye after him. He was particularly against speaking with Albus ever again, especially after Hadrian had discussed in full just how far the man was willing to go to achieve his goals. The cruelty was revolting to him, and in thinking back to every second that he thought kindly of Albus now made his skin crawl. However, Olympe was a dear friend that he had met while she was still a student and he was still entertaining a stint as a professor at Beauxbatons, and after she had graduated and become a professor herself, the professional relationship between them had evolved to the point that she was better described as a family friend, and for all her life had been very dear to him and Perenelle. So, despite having grown apart in the few years that he had thrown himself into study of the deathly hallows and all that came with them, he felt a certain need to assist her in the likely quite bothersome situation that Albus was undoubtedly putting her through.
Her laughs tapered off a bit, not enough to stop as she shook her head jerkily, her white hair flipping through the air erratically. Harry got the feeling that he didn’t understand near enough about the universe, and she was well aware of it.
Draco studied her face, squinting slightly as she turned away, waving to the door as Nicolas opened it and Harry came stumbling out, his leather jacket abandoned for a much more sensible white button-up. Draco was momentarily taken aback by the sight, trying to remember if he had ever seen Harry wear white, let alone a dress shirt.
“Uhm… yeah, mate?” He muttered, still blinking the sleep from his eyes as he settled into a more comfortable position. How long had he been asleep? Had Fleur and Gabrielle already left? He glanced around, finding that it was only them in the sitting room, all alone. He then looked to the windows, finding himself staring out at the pitch-black of night. Yes, it seemed like they had left, or at least should have left.
She fidgeted, caught between long-buried memories and an itching feeling at the back of her skull that this was
Harry had woken up early that morning to the distant feeling of fingers brushing over his wrists. There had been a pressure, which he could conclude might be two fingers pressing into the inside of his wrists, and then a mournful sigh. The noise had been followed by the shifting of fabric, and he had felt the sheet thrown over his body move further upwards, completely covering his head. There were voices then, two outside his mind and one inside, and as consciousness started to pull him upwards into the waking world, Harry subconsciously started to stretch his ever-taught muscles. He mumbled something, mostly confused with what was going on, and flexed his fingers.
Draco rolled his eyes a second time as Bagman’s voice boomed through the stadium, the conversation apparently over as the other two of his party both turned to watch the stadium. Harry considered Draco’s words for a moment, before turning to look at Fudge again. He was surprised to find the man’s gaze already on him as he whispered something to a diplomat Harry didn’t recognize. He narrowed his eyes at the display slightly, off-put by the expression on the minister's face. Fudge went pale once he noticed, jumping away from the diplomat and quickly patting at his waistcoat, looking flustered and off-kilter.
He nodded, apparently in agreement, and continued to silently write. She didn’t spare patience much more than a few seconds longer after that, her concern winning out over any amount of respect she carried for his privacy, and she quickly rounded the desk, peering down at the parchment and quickly reading through the first few sentences he had already written out. She too, went as unnaturally pale as her husband, before practically ripping the mysterious letter out of his hand and yanking it open, reading through it in its entirety. Once finished, she paused, looked down at her husband, before reading through the letter a second time.
He let the thoughts urge him forward, the questions he desperately wanted to ask fueling his pained shamble as he followed his lord and the two people with him out into the field surrounding the stadium and into the forest past it, keeping at a distance as the trio walked steadily, his footsteps masked by the voices around him and the crunching of leaves under the people’s feet. Barty fell into himself as he stalked after the three, mind returning to that state of half-consciousness as his body worked of its own accord, following after its master with silent footsteps as the sounds of excitement fell away behind him and darkness enveloped this new space he found himself in. He paid no mind when the three far in front of him stopped, their voices carrying along with the wind as he stopped in place as well, standing still in the trampled grass as they seemed to come to a swift agreement and carried on again, his quiet steps quickly joining with theirs once more as they all stepped through the woods and out into a new, unfamiliar clearing. Again, he stopped, standing straight at attention as they gathered into a circle, one of them—one of those vague silhouettes in the dark—took something in both hands, holding it out for his lord and the other, small and indistinct shadow to grab hold. He watched as the silhouette reached around, revealing some sort of object he couldn’t see from within the person’s cloak. He watched as a woman’s voice began to speak an unintelligible chant, her cadence assured and strong, yet too quiet for him to understand.
“The… whot? No.” He muttered, his tone making it sound like the obvious answer. Blaise stuttered to a halt, genuinely shocked silent by the response.
He blinked a few times, finding his entire body too stiff to move as he blinked the ice off of his eyelids carefully.
letter. Tom bit his lip, thinking furiously about what to do. If Marvolo was to find out about Lucius’ true reasons for disowning Draco, then the entire point of doing it would be lost and the entire Malfoy family would be lost as well, or simply get a very large and very bloody target painted on their backs. Maybe things would be fine if the Locket figured just enough to know that Draco was getting disowned, sure, since the reason behind it could be inferred and not initially damning, but it was a very thin rope that Tom would have to walk in order to insinuate such a thing. But if Harry went on spewing his thoughts out into the aether, letting every little shard of Tom’s insane, monstrous soul know exactly what was going on, then every last one of the Malfoys, including his son’s soulmate, would be destined to a very painful death very quickly.
“True alchemy, the original branch and the type of alchemy that I will teach you, is rooted in a complex spiritual concept of separation between spirit and self. True alchemy’s concepts revolve around simple parameters of physical and spiritual immaturity in comparison to far more refined and therefore perfect maturity. The concepts state that, as everything in this world holds magic and therefore has a
Without warning, the imposing figure of his lord suddenly turned, and Barty froze stiff as eyes—as bright and horrific as the killing curse—pinned him in place. Wide and monstrous, the eyes gazed out into the forest behind Barty, analytical and daring as the imposing man reached down suddenly with his one free arm to pin the shorter person—a boy, it looked like—beside him in place. Barty sucked in a sharp breath, his mind barely comprehending that decadently sinful shade of deadly green before his eyes traveled slightly upwards to lock onto a faint paleness along the man’s forehead.
“Well.” The man stood suddenly, taking off his right-hand glove as he rounded the table to settle next to Tom, holding out the now bare hand as if it was an offering. “I suppose my remaining questions will be brought to life within you, and eventually my part of our consciousness will be satisfied with the answers that we find.”
“The potion’s room!” Came the distant reply. “I want to see her brew a few simple potions is all! We won't be gone long!”
Harry stayed in that same, vague, half-aware state for the rest of the day. When there was a knock on the door a few hours later, the sound of muffled French wafting through the airy space as Perenelle stood up to get the door, he merely glanced towards it and sighed. He watched Perenelle from his place on the couch, with Draco’s left foot propped up in his lap and the other one hanging off the couch entirely. The muffled voices became louder as the door opened, and seemed to continue as Perenelle’s cheery voice was added to the fray, outshone by a voice that was distinctly Fleur, who seemed to be speaking in a breathless, awed tone.
Due to an increase in masochism on my part, not only will I grace you with close-ups of these seven, but I also drew both Fate & Death as well as the Wendigo & Veela.
Albus stopped, remembering how one of his most valuable assets still at a schooling age was now transferring to Beauxbatons in France. He bit his lip, contemplative. Hermione Granger did not seem in the least bit excited about going to France for schooling, so perhaps it was possible to have her return, if only for the next school year, with the students coming for the Triwizard Tournament. He would have to broach the subject with the girl herself, and would certainly have to plant the idea in Headmistress Maxime’s mind, but if he perhaps had an alumni of Beauxbatons there to assist in the endeavor she would be more inclined to agree.
“Draconis, tell heir Potter that I wish to speak with him before you both leave for Hogwarts. In fact, I would appreciate it if he wrote a letter to me so that we may open up communication.”
“T-the prototype of what?” He finally asked, his eyes skating back and forth between the small stone and Harry, who was rolling up the sleeves of his shirt as he walked towards them, looking more than a little scatterbrained as he did. His hair was sticking up on end in all sorts of angles, and there was some ink staining his fingers as they fiddled with the pressed, white sleeves of his shirt. Draco watched, enraptured, as the sleeves were pulled up to above his elbow, revealing long arms and tanned skin. More skin than Harry typically showed.
“Hadrian.” Perenelle’s hand came to rest over his own, and Harry found himself stuttering to a stop, his eyes locked onto the table as her comparably tiny hand squeezed his own. “We have lived hundreds of years, Hadrian. I highly doubt that you will be able to surprise us.”
He stopped stiff, turning to glare at the lobelia plant on his right. The purple flowers swayed in the wind, swishing smoothly through the air as if they were not an omen of his impending doom. Nicolas groaned, rubbing a hand down his face before yanking the crumpled letter that had brought him here in the first place out of his pocket.
Theo suddenly felt a spike of anger, jerking down to pick back up his trunks before turning towards the fireplace. “Unlike you, grandfather, I could care less about a person’s reputation. If I want to care about someone I will despite how the rest of the world sees them.”
“Or not go mad.” Harry remarked, the exhaustion in his face breeding something darker as he seemed to sag against the back of his chair. Draco felt a rush of emotions surge through him at the sight, and subconsciously straightened, glancing around for signs of…
Fate has white around her pupil because, as descriptions state, her eyes are always cold and cruel, which I often imagined as this freezing ice-like look that I thought would be best encapsulated with white. Both her's and Death's eyes were based off of solar eclipses (loosely, as I was too lazy to pull up any photo references and just kinda went with a picture in my mind), just because I thought that it would lend the eyes to looking more unearthly and-well, godly.
She smiled, closing her eyes and sinking further into the mossy earth underneath her as the sun warmed her cheeks and bare legs. It was delightfully hot out today, and they had dressed up in swim wear that Theo had regarded as ‘obscene’ and had taken off to the little pond. Luna was dressed in a lovely little blue and pink one piece swimsuit that she had seen in a muggle shop while in Clovelly, and a pair of bleached out bermuda jean shorts that some random muggle girl on the beach had gifted her. They were about three sizes too large and the edges were all frayed so that strings of fabric tickled her legs, but they looked far too fun for her to resist wearing now that it was nice and hot out.
There was a laugh, though Tom didn’t see the man’s mouth move. “I already have a name, my dear Tom Riddle, and you have known it this entire time. I suppose you had forgotten sometime along the way? That is of no matter, I will remind you soon enough.”
“Any part of my soul gaining a body is a concern, Harry. Especially considering he knows… well, he was created at a very inopportune time for my mental strength.”
“Hadrian? We’ll be right back!” Perenelle shouted over her shoulder, not stopping in the slightest as she shoved a star-struck Fleur back down the hall.
Harry rolled his eyes, ignoring Tom’s scathing reply as he gazed around the workshop. It was a large, square room with tables and bookshelves blocking every wall, parchment thrown about the place as the smell of something burning permeated every crack and crevice. Half of the bookshelves didn’t even have books on them, instead being decorated with a wide array of beakers, various bars of different metals and substances, and other miscellaneous glass containers holding mostly either the opaque black liquid or the water-like substance. Nothing looked organized in the least, though the furnace inset in the far wall was impeccable and clean, a stark difference against the chaotic backdrop of the room.
Albus stopped, hand halfway raised to begin stroking his beard when the epiphany struck. The attack was so illogical, when one stepped back and considered it. It almost seemed as though the attacker didn’t have a single motive besides killing someone. It was as if things had just…
Her gray eyes turned to him then, shining with amusement and just a dash of something else he couldn’t discern. Theo scoffed out a laugh, shaking his head in her direction as she darted around him and out the door, the letter still in hand. He let her go, still leaned up against the door frame, still watching the moving portraits painted onto the wall, and still wondering if she had experienced a vision or a nightmare. Did it even matter? Luna was a strong person, and knew her limits-unlike him. She would talk if she wanted to, and would stay quiet if she thought it was necessary. Maybe he really had just been misplacing his own frustrations, though with what exactly he wasn’t quite sure.
Perenelle : Ah, un maître de potions en herbe? Je dois admettre, après que Nicolas a pris Hadrian, j'ai souhaité avoir mon propre apprenti. À quel point es-tu douée?"
“What comes next?” Harry questioned, not bothering to look up from the bubbling cauldron as the green fumes started to darken and sizzle. It was difficult for him to see through the thick gas, but he could see well enough to know that the color of the concoction was the pernicious red color his mentor had described in the previous step. The sound of footsteps alerted him to Nicolas standing, and a deep breath made him think that the man had shoved his head out of the window to get better air. A mangled cough seemed to prove the theory.
Spurred on by the reaction it had elicited out of his soulmate, Harry took great joy in making even more unnecessarily flowery declarations of his affections as they walked up the sharp upward incline of stairs and to the very top of the stadium. Draco laughed a few times, and simply smiled at the rest, refusing Harry any more cheeky quips or equally obnoxious declarations until they nearly reached the top of the absurdly tall and unnecessarily thin stairway.
Neither of his companions had said so much as a word. How long had it been since he had started his explanation? Minutes? Hours? Time seemed to have blurred together as he had become so focused on his memories and reliving all that had happened, but the sun outside seemed much higher in the sky than it had been when he sat down that morning, so it had to have been far longer than he thought. Harry swallowed the lump in his throat, rubbing away the crystalizing tears with equally cold fingers. He felt so, so cold; it was a cold beyond what he needed, a cold beyond what he wanted.
Tom felt a red hot spike of anger rush through him, one that screamed through his nonexistent veins before settling deep in his stomach and staying there. His eyes followed the blue-eyed man as he came back around to his chair and sat down, thumbing through the booklet as he continued on. “You see, my tactics are much the same as dear Hadrian’s, meaning that I have a need to triumph over my foes on the battlefield, though I believe my preferred field of battles is one of wit while Hadrian prefers a more violent, physical approach. You, however, have dedicated our soul to the pursuit of death in order to fuel Hadrian’s own power, which I simply cannot tolerate without good reason for doing so.”
They stared at each other for a moment, quietly, before there was a flicker of something in Harry’s eye, and the tall boy abruptly threw his head back, his laughter booming through the room. Draco realized only a second after, and groaned, burrowing his head in both hands as the echo of near-hysterical laughter bounced around his ears.
Perenelle also nodded, though her eyes were more watery than conspiratorial. “Good… oh, goodness Hadrian, I don’t know how I’ll manage without you there during breakfast. Everything will be so… oh I can see it now. Everything will be so painfully dull!”
Harry snorted, before resting his head against Draco’s shoulder again and falling blissfully away into sleep. Blaise decided he should leave well enough alone at that, satisfied with the little moment of chaos he had wrought.
Nicolas laughed lightly, picking up the bottle that Harry had been observing in order to bring it into the light for observation. “I must admit, the process is rather draining, but what I can relate it to is the act of casting a spell continuously until your magical reserves have been completely expended.”
She hummed, looking down at him through the thin sheen of her sun hat’s veil. He was reclined out on the dry summer grass, his head resting on her lap right next to the small book that she had been pretending to read for the past few hours. His eyes were closed, an almost serene smile across his lips showing that he was either having a particularly pleasant dream or was planning something mischievous. Daphne couldn’t help but smile at the expression, remembering what he had been like before he killed that muggleborn months ago. He had taken an almost instantaneous turn after that day, and while she could tell that he still held a great deal of guilt surrounding the murder that he had committed, there was a skip to his step and an ease to his gait that made her absolutely certain that what he did was the right thing. Not all lives were created equal, and Daphne was sure that that muggleborn boy’s life didn’t hold a candle to Blaise’s.
He barely made it out the door and down the stairs without tripping, using the support of the people around him and the desperate wish that they were all too deliriously excited or drunk or unfocused to pay much attention to an invisible force pushing its way through the crowd. All he could manage to focus on was the hulking figure he was following, the pitch-black hair and the commanding presence and that frighteningly familiar aura of power and supremacy. The imposing man moved through the crowd with ease, parting the waves of people with a familiar happenstance that sent a shock of thrill racing through his body. The familiar movements, the unignorable aura… the familiarity he felt did not shock him. No one but his lord could ever make him feel so terrified, astonished, and in awe all at the same time.
“You promised not to keep things from me anymore, Harry.” He whispered quietly, voice losing every hard edge it had held mere seconds before. Harry felt his stomach drop to his toes, head whipping up to find Draco’s eyes pinned onto his own. “You promised me that you would be honest, and for the most part you have been, but I feel like you’re falling back on those old habits of keeping things from me for the sake of…
He took a small sip of his water again, thanking Perenelle as she levitated a plate of breakfast over to him. She seemed nice enough-she absolutely adored potions, which was a subject he felt that he needed personal growth in, so Harry was feeling rather tempted to ask for advice or even lessons from her alongside his efforts with Nicolas.
Harry pushed off of the desk, the now crumpled letter still in his hand as he whipped around and swung viciously towards the nearest wall, hearing a satisfying
The blood had dried dark, almost black from age and grime. The bowl of fruits that the painting once illustrated was almost completely covered by the stain, the barest inklings of a pear peeking out from underneath the splatter. Marvolo looked at it for a sparse moment, his mind wandering still to the feeling of utter delight as he severed Lady Riddle’s spinal cord and ripped her stomach open with precise slashes of his wand. Lord Riddle had screamed, only held back from running to her by his cowardly son, who had screamed at him to leave the love of his life behind to die.
There was a pause. For a moment even Blaise was caught off guard, before he was swiftly snatched back up by utter delight.
The train of thought ground to a screeching halt as he stared, eyes wide, at the now unassuming iron door, realizing that if there really had been an attempt to revive Voldemort, doing it when Harry Potter was far away was the safest way to go about it. The boy was destined to kill him after all, it was best to cover your bases before attempting a resurrection ritual.
“Oh, mais sa cicatrice Gabrielle, n'est-elle pas étrange?” Shuffling his feet for a moment, Harry peered around questioningly, before returning his attentions to Sirius and trying to block out any ghossiping that might be happening in a language he didn’t understand.
He nearly stumbled at Draco’s voice, whipping around to find the other boy with his nose stuck high up in the air, eyes squinting judgmentally towards the ‘ghastly’ creatures.
Nicolas tisked, patting him once on the shoulder before pulling away. “Regardless of that, you are welcome here at any time you find yourself needing a roof over your head. We would never turn you away.”
She was already reaching for his trunks, picking them both up and quickly skipping away, he merely followed after her, reaching the steps just as Xenophilius spoke one final time.
and that the two met in a public place where Harry could easily escape if his father had ill intentions. Surely Harry would be able to at least hold off any sort of assault if that were the case, right? If he was capable of mutilating a child without remorse, surely he wouldn’t be too troubled with defending himself against Draco’s father, right? Especially if the man aimed to kill.
“This, Harry, is the moral dilemma that you face here.” Nicolas popped the top off of the phial, and the smell of iron immediately permeated the air. Harry stiffened slightly, hands subconsciously clenching as he urged his instincts down. Even without the need to breathe, he could still taste the metallic odor on his tongue.
“I bet you want to chop me off at the knees to even the score, eh Malfoy? You have grown a little though, haven’t you? A few centimeters, I reckon?” Harry replied, a familiar teasing tone to his voice completely replacing the concern that had been there mere minutes previously. Draco swallowed thickly, trying to come up with an equally sarcastic reply but suddenly pulling a blank. Harry’s voice had gotten deeper as well, mellower. Draco couldn’t explain it, but his the taller boy's voice sounded like molasses, or honey.
“Hadrian should be here in just a moment, I believe he moseyed off to sort out something with the potion he helped me brew yesterday.”
Harry nodded slowly, observing the massive iron door with interest. “When you woke me up it was just barely sunrise, so I reckon I have three hours or so before Nicolas tries to wake me up.”
Regardless of his harsh tone, Draco was smiling, a familiar blush trailing up his neck and eeking out around his cheeks, so Harry supposed that the decision to preemptively make nice with Viktor had been the right one, if only to breed life into Draco’s fiery personality, one that had been dwindling into cinders over the past month.
“I don’t fully understand it myself.” Stall. He needed to stall. “If you give me time, I might be able to explain how it happened, but I can’t confirm that you’ll… well, I-”
Draco’s eyes suddenly fell onto him again, and then narrowed further. Harry stood his ground, suddenly finding himself in a silent war of wills as his best friend slowly circled the table, his moves strangely reminiscent of a tiger, or a wolf. Harry didn’t know why, but he got the sudden feeling that he was being scrutinized so heavily for all the wrong reasons.
of all people must have seen death. It was an absurd notion to him. It was a well-known fact that the Malfoys had sheltered their son far too strictly for him to have ever randomly come upon something like that.
The sunlight was hitting his back directly, and the heat reminded Harry of blond hair and pink lips.
He thought, his shoulders sagging slightly as he closed his eyes, slowly giving in to sleep as the hours ticked closer and closer to morning. No matter how Draco reacted to the news, telling him on the same day had always been the right idea, regardless of how or why Tom thought differently.
“Well just because you're used to it doesn’t mean he can go around being so disgusting! He called you-”
the soul stayed in the place of the lost limb before realizing slowly that it was no longer there, and thus receded back into the rest of the body. The man hobbling down the walk had to have lost his leg mere minutes ago, for his soul to still be acting like he had two of them!
The somber moments of silence seemingly forgotten, a rowdy applause shook the room as people far back near the entrance hopped up from their seats to get a better look at the living legend before them. The not-Moody’s soul seemed obscenely excited about the entire ordeal, as it flickered about in an array of nervous twitches that Luna didn’t like at
“Don’t you like your vessel, Locket? You rave on about it all the time.” Tom replied cheerily as he finished off the door and bent down, picking up the downed doorknob and examining it. He would have to sort out some of the dents, but he had just barely enough magic to manage it. Yes, he could manage it easily.
to be a plan to separate the two, to give his lord his own body once again. Should he ask? Or should he stay silent? Barty fidgeted, uncertain and terribly curious.
The Lovegood residence was built in the shape of a rook, though it hadn’t been planned to look that way. Yes, strangely enough the home had initially meant to be a bishop, but an unknown ancestor who Luna had decided to name Ophelia Elara Belinda Jane Lovegood the third had found herself perturbed with the idea of being so intertwined with the concept of religion that she insisted they change it to a rook. The story went that she then proclaimed that ‘The Rookery’ sounded far more pleasant than ‘The Bishopric’, which everyone in the family could contend with easily enough.
and it hadn’t really felt like he was being trusted by Harry at all. When he had realized that, all the enthusiasm he had around trying to figure out Harry’s mysteries quickly fell away.
Noxious fumes permeated the air, seeping into his clothes as his fingers worked in tandem with several of the ticking devices scattered around his workplace. Nicolas sat in the corner of the room closest to the opened window, some sort of enchanted cloth covering his nose and mouth as he muttered incomprehensibly under his breath, a quill scratching across a piece of parchment sat propped up on the sill. Harry shuffled his feet, the soles of his boots scraping across the flaking metal that had built up there after decades of not being swept away as he fought the urge to close his eyes. The fumes rising up around him took on a green, insidious tint, and Nicolas cursed, scooting closer to the window and as his breathing shallowed.
There was a sparse second of silence, before the alight wand was finally pulled out of his face, revealing the woman who had been counting, as well as a young boy who seemed to be around thirteen. Barty took only a sparse moment to stare at the child, before coming to the swift realization that he was likely a Malfoy. Their hair was a very unique shade, after all, it rarely could be found anywhere outside of the family. The woman, however, was a complete mystery, and as she backed up a few paces and back into the darkness of night, he allowed himself to assume she was simply a foreigner. Her accent surely insinuated as such.
That familial, comforting presence felt so earth-shatteringly real. “You’ll have that soulbond for the rest of time. Keeping too many secrets and telling too many lies is a sure way to cause you both pain for a long, long time.”
(Lmao and yes I am absolutely making Harry as tall as Death once he's full grown, he's still got quite a bit of growing left in him.)
The memory of Theo’s bogart came rushing back to him in that moment, of the familiar green eyes and hair-raising cackle. He cursed, realizing that the goddess’s meddling went far deeper than he could have expected. Was she purposefully trying to drive a wedge between him and Theo? Or was there something else going on that ran even deeper than that?
likely that the girl had been killed on sight as well. But how did the attacker manage to get her out of her dorm, down five flights of stairs, and into the great hall without any of the portraits waking up or seeing a thing?
He questioned himself, mind running rampant with possibilities. Albus was hardly one to threaten anyone, at least not directly, but he did have a general tendency to try and ‘persuade’ people to do favors for him when it was not in the least beneficial for them to do so. Nicolas himself had fallen into a similar trap many times, and he was certain that Albus still had several of the rare tomes that he had begged out of the Flamel library over the years, some of which being the last remaining of their kind, written directly for Nicolas’ use from trusted intellectuals and dear friends over the past several centuries.
Luna groaned, shaking her head with frustration. No! There was no possible way that soul belonged to an aged man like Alastor Moody. There was just no way!
“Tom? Come on now, Tom, you know I didn’t mean to call you a murderer, right? And Tommy… and I’m sure Tommy is fine with being a part of you, you know? Don’t… don’t put me back in with these things on-”
“Leave? But Tommy dearest, you haven’t even told me about the letter yet! I want to know what it saaaaid!” The locket whined, still writhing around in its bonds as he stood over it, glaring hatefully.

“Oh Tom, Fate had such high expectations for us, and we let her down. I suppose this must be her revenge, yes? And I suppose that it is partially my fault, for making you this way. I am, after all, a very large piece of our life. I’m so sorry that she has destroyed us in such a way, and I am so very sorry that you feel the need to destroy us further in retaliation.”
“You were born mad, you know that Potter?” Draco shot back, his tone sharp and-yes, he definitely knew something was wrong-as he casually dunked one of the biscuits into his tea. Harry snorted a laugh, one so obnoxiously fake that he nearly cringed at it himself, before leaning back in his chair, trying to disappear into the wicker weave as Perenelle directed the conversation away from him and onto potions, seeming to draw Draco’s attention away and making him objectively invisible.
In his past few weeks of living with the Lovegoods, he had found himself strangely comforted by how…
The headmaster’s voice broke her from the wistful thought, and she turned keen eyes to his burning brilliance. He was a powerful man, of that she could not deny, but his soul was one that she found painfully bright—too bright. No one did well to stare directly at the sun, after all, and that was the only thing she could find to be comparable to Albus Dumbledore’s soul. A burning, writhing, powerful mass not unlike the sun.
The man tisked, shaking his finger at Tom as if he were a petulant child. “Incorrect. People faced with horrible situations in which society has collapsed, still have morals. Different morals yes, but morals all the same. Hadrian, when faced with such a situation, would feel nothing about his actions and would see no issue with them, no matter how horrible and cruel. A human living in a post apocalyptic wasteland might murder others, yes, but they will likely feel inclined to protect their family and keep those they care about safe in direct contrast with that. Hadrian is not like this.”
And so, he told them. He told them everything he could. He started with his original timeline, of how it had gone and who they had lost, of how the Flamels themselves hadn’t lived long enough for their paths to cross his own. He spoke of how he reunited the Hallows accidentally, and walked to his death in the Forbidden Forest at the age of seventeen. He retold his conversation with Death, and of the few moments where he met Fate, and of his rebirth. He gave quiet recounts of his early years, of learning under a madman who lived in his head, and of how that madman slowly grew into someone less mad as time went on. He spoke of soulmates, and of creature inheritances, and of how both converged onto him on his 13th birthday, a twisted mess of presents he never asked for that were gifted to him by cruel gods that wanted hidden things from him in return. He spoke of the full extent of Albus Dumbledore’s manipulations, and of the ancient magics that had been used to bind away his emotions and make him compliant in the first timeline. With shaking hands, he recounted the sins of Ginevra Weasley, and how he enacted cruel revenge against her a mere two months prior. He whispered, with a shaking voice, how his heart had stopped that day, and how it had been giving out months prior to that, and how his body froze the air around it no matter how hot the day was, and how only his soulmate seemed to warm him anymore. He whispered of the agony, and of the joy, and of the pain, and how, through it all, he had crawled with bloodied hands towards a happier future, until he had no blood left in his veins for him to bleed, and his heart shuttered to one last painful stop, and how his lungs caved in and all that was left was bloodied fur and sharp claws. He spoke of sunken eyes and icy hands, and of the beautiful, scorching embrace that his soulmate wrapped around him when it all became too much to bear. He spoke about the agony of being apart, and of the ice in his empty veins, and of the daunting years of conflict that seemed to stretch infinitely on before and behind him. He spoke of how it felt like too much, and how it had always felt like too much, and how he sometimes wished that everything would just stop, and he could just forget all of it, even for just the smallest of moments.
“I s’pose.” He finally managed, feeling rather proud of himself for such a feat. The darling Lady Malfoy seemed equally impressed, and landed a rather sloppy kiss on his cheek in response, one which involved a peculiarly large amount of tongue, considering how far it had been from his mouth. The man hummed, wrapping a wandering arm around her waist and generally making a bit of a fool of himself as it landed a bit farther down than was considered appropriate, especially considering that his barely fourteen-year-old son was sleeping a mere two doors away, and would no doubt be incredibly inconvenienced by his drunk parents making feverish love in the hall outside his bedroom.
Tom pinched the bridge of his nose, staring blankly at the broken door as his migraine returned two-fold with the painfully loud noise. Fixing it right away was clearly not viable, but if he could find a way to keep Locket from even trying to barge in again, if only temporarily, then perhaps that would give him enough time to rest his magic and try for more extensive precautions.
The thought sent a wave of panic through him, and as Lord Malfoy’s hand left his shoulder, Draco’s gaze zeroed in on the fireplace across the room. There were mere minutes left until the international floo was opened for him, and then he would be off to France a week earlier than scheduled, without the ability to know anything past what he had been told at that moment. What would happen at the manor while he was gone? When he returned during December for Yule, what would have changed? There was a certain oppressive weight to the air, one that had followed him around the manor for the past week, ever since his father had stood up one morning and stated that he should leave for France earlier than scheduled. Draco just didn’t know what to make of it all, but knew that it wasn’t anything good. Maybe that was why he had instinctively written to Blaise, knowing that the owl would take too long to get to Harry and feeling unsure with where he stood with Theo. He had just desperately needed to tell
free of guilt, blue eyes.” Tom threw the booklet away, masking his anger with cool indifference as the thin paper fluttered through the air for a moment before settling down on the cold tile floor a few feet away. The diadem horcrux eyed it with discomfort, as if seeing something so precious just laying there on the floor bothered him deeply.
and it only got worse as the seconds dragged on. He had gotten a letter from Sirius asking if he would like to meet up and hit the town at some point that week, and despite the start to his alchemy lessons, Harry hadn’t managed to find it in himself to decline. Perhaps it was a younger part of himself that agreed, one that was still sore from the man’s death in the last timeline. Or perhaps he just wanted to get away from thoughts of ten thousand men and the speed at which he had resolved to kill them.
Lord Lucius Abraxas Malfoy is the proud owner of no less than three offices, though the last of them feels a tad bit cramped now, considering the rather large elephant in the room.
Letting out a long breath, Theo forced himself to straighten his spine and continue walking, twisting through the comically nonsensical-if familiar-passages on his path towards the nearest fireplace. He wouldn’t let Harry’s sins bother him over what was supposed to be a vacation, and he would be attempting to spend every second he could at Luna’s house doing anything
He was jolted from the thought as a particular memory was shoved to the forefront of his subconscious, as he physically jolted out of his meditation, his frozen eyelids being forced open with a crack.
Nicolas Flamel?” Her surprised shout made him jolt, and he blinked at her gobsmacked expression with confusion. Before he had a moment to reply, the girl at his leg let out an excited little squeal and stepped away from him to also stare in shock. “Whatever for?”
They both laughed, warm and light and happy. The tension between them was broken, thawed like ice on a hot summer day. Draco looked down at their intertwined hands, at how Harry’s fingers alone stretched the length of Draco’s entire hand. Their difference in size felt comical with Harry’s new growth spurt to contend with, and once again Draco was glad for his own, nearly laughing at the thought of what they could have looked like next to each other if he had continued to be stunted.
Harry hummed at Tom’s strained voice, confused with what it was saying. Stay still? Why would he need to stay still?
“Who’s not going mad?” Draco blurted, his entire body taught as a wire as Harry whipped around to face him, a look of utter surprise and panic overtaking the exhaustion on his face. Panic, because of what? What reason was Harry-? Draco felt panic of a different sort surge through him, and he gripped the doorframe to keep from outwardly reacting. Something was horribly, terribly wrong. He could feel it.
Draco stared down at the portkey as its chain was held out to him, the glimmering pendant shining pleasantly in the early morning sun.
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic sits upon nine acres of land in an undisclosed location in the south of France, near Cannes, and overlooks a cliff. The view off of this cliff has been widely considered one of the most stunning in the wizarding world, second only to the glittering streets of El Dorado in America. The Academy has a large, rectangular, man-made lake just outside the entrance, which is home to a very large swan, who was affectionately named Clarence many years prior. The gardens are vast and elaborate, home to a variety of flower and plant specimens that have been planted over the hundreds of years that the academy has been a place of learning. While these gardens are cared for primarily by fairies and by sprites, it gets a helping hand from the Academy’s grounds and gamekeeper, Rèmy Vieuxpont, who tends to the stables and also helps to teach horseback riding as an extracurricular class.
The old man sighed, standing from the ancient table as he removed the gloves and set them down in front of them. “That is a very good question, and I would love to answer it after you in turn answer one thing for me.”
“Don’t even try to say they are the same scenario, you bastard. I constantly refuse to give them all an explanation because I know all too well that they have
“Right then.” Brushing his slightly stained shirt down, Draco took a moment to glare at his visible ankles, annoyed that the expanding charms on his clothing worked so slowly that they were practically ineffective when faced with a massive growth spurt like the one he was experiencing. Draco was happy that he was finally growing, sure, but considering that it was likely one of those massive growth spurts that everyone experienced at this age, and that Harry had been complaining about bumping his head into door frames in his letters, Draco was doubtful that he would look much taller standing next to anyone. Well, maybe he might look taller around the girls, but Theo was sure to have grown just as much if not more than him, so Draco was doubtful that this sudden growth would save him from the other boy’s teasing.
the house was. It seemed that every available space was taken up with something interesting or noteworthy, and what little space remained housed almost everything else, be it stacks of newspapers, editorials, empty inkwells, or jars of glitter. It seems like every inch of the house absolutely
“I wouldn’t be thinking about them so hard if they were old things.” He muttered, closing his eyes as her laughter momentarily drowned out everything else.
Harry jumped at the sudden voice, turning to find Draco standing in the doorway, an expression too elaborate for him to figure out painted across his face. Their eyes met, and Harry felt his shoulders stiffen as Draco seemed to dissect every inch of his face as if carefully observing some great puzzle. What was he looking for?
The ring was gone. He didn't know how it could even be possible, but without his own interference the door to the ring had been completely removed from his wall. He stumbled forward, gazing out at the endless blackness that had replaced it. When he had absorbed the diary, the door had also disappeared, but after that the entire wall had also been returned to normal.
Harry watched as the gold glimmered in the light, intrigued by the entire process despite knowing very little about it. What was the black tar-like substance, and how did it play into ageing the metal’s spirit?
The darkened form seemed to melt and flake away at the same time upon contact with the clear liquid, and as it did flakes of a golden metal began to take their place. Copper to gold appeared to be much easier than lead to gold, as though the ease in which something was changed was completely dependent on the age gap between the substance that you wished to change and the substance that you wished to change it into.
He followed a well-worn path to the dining hall, the corridors becoming unfamiliar as he walked further away from his original route. As he walked, the decrepitness of the house started to shift into something calmer-something more akin to a tomb. As he walked, the aftereffects of his first visit became less prevalent, and the manor revealed itself like an aged crypt, housing the memories of those who had lived there with stunning accuracy. Marvolo was not privy to those memories, he did not know how to follow them as he could follow his own, but the hints of life that they gave were telling all the same.
There were so many noises, so many movements and sounds and smells, he couldn’t keep track of one over the other. Disjointed blips of conversation assaulted him from every angle, every little squeak of a shoe or shifting of a cloth grating against his ears as if they were explosions going off right besides his head. For several minutes, he lost it all in the fog of noise, unable to grasp onto one thing over another as the voices got louder and more excited and loud loud
Harry let his tight smile fall as the two started to go down a rabbit hole of ingredients and brewing times, a familiar feeling of dread creeping subtly up from his chest. This was going to be much harder than he had thought. Sure, just saying that he would tell Draco about his father’s letter once a good opportunity presented itself was simple enough, but putting the thought into practice? It was already grating on his frayed nerves.
Harry and Draco reconnect, the bond between them sparkling and sizzling brilliantly as fire and ice finally collide.
“So that is your decision? Leave it up to the one being that has the means and the ability to destroy not just us, but the entire world as we know it? Tell me, Tom, is this your attempt to repent for us, or for the world?”
His body stood on its own accord, and his muscles and bones strained in protest. His eyes unfocused, blurring into a vague mess of colors as the invisibility cloak was pulled off of him from somewhere near the floor. His legs moved, against his own wishes, and began to walk towards somewhere he could not discern. That was another unfortunate part of the torture that was the imperious curse. When someone under its spell was being maneuvered by its caster, their eyes blurred and there was nothing that they could see. This meant that, even in the times that his body was allowed to walk and eat and drink, when he was finally able to relieve himself or bathe, he was unable to see anything but vague blurs. And, once the chore that was keeping his body alive was done, he was forced back down into the same sitting position, staring at the same overgrown fingernail, and forced to wait for the next time that his sight would go blurry.
“How did you even find that much blood… oh.” Nicolas and Perenelle were born at the cusp of the thirteen hundreds, just in time for the bubonic plague. “You took it from the bodies during the Black Death, didn’t you.”
Sighing, Theo turned away from both of the quills, shuffling deeper into the large stationary store as his thoughts veered sharply off course. He didn’t know what to feel about Harry anymore. On one hand, he couldn’t forget the sight of Ginny Weasley’s body, mangled and broken beyond recognition. The memory was seared in his brain, carved into the back of his eyes so he couldn’t ever forget about it, or how Harry had been the one to do it.
He shook his head carefully, still watching the girl’s father as he seemed to contemplate something carefully. “No, don’t worry about it. Shall we head off?”
about the strange conversation he had found himself in, he considered the man’s words carefully, trying to figure out what would be the best thing to say without betraying his own ideals. The sound of someone walking around upstairs gave him the hope that this conversation would be cut short soon enough.
“Well,” she started, brushing the feeling of scratchy lichen off of her knee as she did. “It just seems that you aren’t taking a moment to think about who Harry is, why he would do something, and for what reason he would do it. You’ve known him since your first year after all, you must understand that he always has good reasonings for things. He is very logical after all, he isn’t one for acts of unnecessary violence.”
He sighed, adding in the last of the Anjelica herb as his visibility dropped lower still, forcing him to wave his hand around in the air to try and clear it. Realizing the effort was ineffective, and further acknowledging that any exterior magic that he might use to try and clear the air would potentially ruin the potion, Harry allowed himself to groan tiredly before focusing on the color of the smoke around him, finding with relief that it seemed to be the correct hue.
“The last name I wish to honor, and one you all have likely heard much of over the past several months, is Ginevra Weasley. She, as you all are well aware of by now, was tragically attacked and killed by a werewolf, who had come to this school with the expectation that he would be far away from all students during the nights of the full moon.” The headmaster paused then, his soul flickering with something akin to… excitement? Luna blinked, taken aback by the odd emotion as the old man returned to his speech. “The werewolf was captured immediately, though he soon escaped and is currently evading capture by the auror task forces deployed to detain him. If you or any of your friends and family members have any knowledge of Remus Lupin’s whereabouts, please submit a sighting report to the DMLE posthaste. Now, let us all spare these lost friends several seconds of silence in their memory.”
As much as he liked to ignore the fact, Harry had to admit to himself that memories stick. They cling to you like parasites or leeches, sucking and zapping away any new knowledge you have surrounding an individual. The Dursleys, while brilliant now, still had memories applied to them. Harry could not forget the cupboard, and he could not forget their hatred, even if it was fabricated and untrue. With those memories, leeching away at the edges of his perception of them, he was incapable of fully placing himself into their family, no matter how much all of them tried. But Nicolas, and Perenelle, had no memories attached to their character that might taint them in negatives. He had not even met them in his past life, and in this instance he realized just how much of a blessing that was.
Nicolas poured the molten metal into a small cup-like container, the brightly shining liquid dripping into it like sludge. The workroom was hot, and smelt of a sulfur and ash that Harry had grown accustomed to after so many brushes with Death.
“Time passes Albus, and not all things can be forgiven, especially so soon after they happened.” He replied, making an effort not to glare as his nails dug into the hard oak wood of the office’s door. “I believe it is reasonable of me to say that you are no longer welcome near my home. Goodbye.”
Draco rolled his eyes, waving his hand around at the room of people. “These are politicians, Harry, they’re not exactly used to people who naturally command attention. Fudge is a coward as well, so that entire altercation was doomed from the start. A hare would frighten him, let alone you and that smile of yours.”
Until clarity came rushing back to him, and he slammed the letter down on his desk, denting the wood and causing one of the legs to crack under the pressure. Draco’s words from the week prior raced forward from the back of his mind, ripping into him like a knife as their truth rang through the air in his uncomfortably silent room. The new year, mere months away. Less than half a year, if that, would pass before suddenly, without cause or reason, Lucius Malfoy would disown his son.
As soon as the headmaster had settled down into his chair for the minutes of silence that were expected to come, a sudden
Family dynamics. The more accurate word would be family hierarchy, but she had been told many years prior to never say that in front of polite company-or any company at all. The family ‘dynamic’ was a concept that she had had ingrained in her from a young age-practically as an infant, she would wager.
The worn carpet that his father’s corpse had laid on decades prior stared back at him, mundane in its normalcy. For such a pivotal part of his development, the sun-bleached fabric felt as forgettable as anything else, normal and quotidian in every way. There was nothing special about that carpet other than the uniqueness that he attached to it, the faded cerulean inks holding nothing but age and wear. His mind was the thing that supplied the uniqueness, and everything after that was the truth of it.
Draco scrambled forward, cursing slightly as his and Harry’s fingers both fumbled around the thin chain. He got a grip on it just as Perenelle hit one, and he felt the tell-tale feel of something hooking onto his navel before the even more distinct feeling of being ripped forward and through space made him close his eyes, resisting the urge to breathe in or even move as his body was thrown hundreds of miles across the ocean and back to Britain. He felt the unpleasant sensation of being stretched, tugged along faster than his body was supposed to handle as magic merrily kept all of his organs and body parts exactly where they were supposed to be, if only just.
He thought idly, huffing slightly as he reached over absentmindedly to grasp Harry’s hand, looking around the campsite as the looming figure of his soulmate started questioning Krum about the difference between Dark Arts-related courses at Durmstrang and Hogwarts, for no discernible reason other than he could. If Draco knew Harry as well as he thought he did, it likely was for no other reason than an academic one.
Harry pushed his way down the uneven steps, not taking much care in being gentle as people tried to elbow past him. Draco was blathering excitedly about the match as they descended, occasionally throwing a very enthusiastic elbow at the passing person whenever they got just a bit too close for his liking. It was a chaotic affair, and the noise was much,
She shifted in place, picking at a loose hangnail as the noise around her steadily climbed and Harry continued to not appear. Where was he? He had replied to her letter—rather stiffly, but he had replied—so surely he was still doing well, right? But Draco was feeling anxious, had something happened? Had Harry decided to stay in France? Did he not want to be friends anymore? Did he think that the letter she wrote was too strange and didn’t want any part in it? Did he-?
Tom had a pinched expression, eyes occasionally darting towards the iron door and what was beyond it. “I recognized the blackness that was beyond the hole. It was very similar to the mind of someone who actually has a mind to store memories in. Though… I will say that it seemed noticeably bare, even for the average eighteen year old mind-that was the age that I had made the ring.” He paused for a moment, clearing his throat of something before remarking about it under his breath. “Though I suppose that’s unsurprising considering how many memories I stole from him.”
“Merlin, that was worse than the first time!” Draco shouted over the noise, his face appearing a little pale as he grabbed Harry's elbow for support. Harry laughed brazenly, brushing some soot from his shoulder as they began pushing their way through the crowd.
“Oh of course Nicolas, do not think so little of me, please.” She admonished lightly, waving her hand through the air as if waving away his words, a habit she adopted from Perenelle over the years. He huffed out a laugh, raising his own hands in assent.
You see, Draco had gained a suspicion during his third year, one that had been cemented by numerous slightly suspect scenarios that he hadn’t been able to simply write off. The suspicion being that, somehow, he had an innate ability to tell when Harry was feeling high emotions, or at least could feel when something was off. It had happened during the past Hallowe’en, it had happened again the morning Ginny Weasley’s body was found, and it was happening now, as he lay in bed on the morning of Harry’s fourteenth birthday.
(And a very special thank you to everyone who takes the time to write out a comment each chapter, because I really love you guys. But really, you're all fantastic.)
Draco didn’t even bother raising an eyebrow as Harry stormed into the room, the tall boy looking incensed past the point of reason as he stormed across the room before stiffly sitting down, perched at the edge of the couch next to Draco as if he would jump back up again at any moment, his lithe fingers angrily working along the folds of some medical tape as he furiously bandaged his knuckles with it. Draco did raise an eyebrow at that, however, setting aside the book he had been reading—one of the tomes that Fleur had gifted him on Harry’s birthday—before regarding his soulmate with a quizzical expression.
“You know, portkeys used to be rather wretched for me. I don’t know what changed, but I’m certainly not complaining.”
Perenelle pat his arm, a warm, strangely touching smile lighting up her face as she spoke. Harry was taken aback by the expression, not knowing just what about it had brought him so much comfort at first. In fact, it wasn’t till he had gotten into bed that night, the sun having already risen and set, that he realized just why it had offset him so much. The smile had been patent in the way that a mentor might look at their pupil, but kind in the way a family member might address their child. It wasn’t a smile given to a pupil after they do something grand, or a mother addressing something sweet that her child had done, but was strangely in the middle.
“Yes I-yes, of course, Mister Potter, this is Oblansk-no, erm… Obalonskthe? I-I’m not well suited for Bulgarian names Mister Potter, I apologize. This is the Bulgarian Minister.”
He hissed, anger expelling outwards like a burst of cold air. Ice crystallized the water particles around him as he hissed and spit and fought down the urge to rip his
Marvolo gazed at the rising sun, watching as it peaked through the red clouds to greet him and the new day. Wrinkling his nose in disgust, he turned sharply in place, and wandlessly apparated away.
Sirius watched him duck through the doorframe with amusement, already making his way through the tailor’s shop as the poor seamstress manning the desk watched him with mild trepidation. Harry gave her a warry wave, before quickly setting off for where Sirius had snuck off to.
