“Potter, you tosser!” Draco screeches, kicking wildly. “I will kick you square in the bollocks, you bastard!”
“Simon? You knew his name?”
“Shut it,” Harry warns.
Long, clawed fingers pull a lever to stop the lift. “But Fidelius quo Fortius, too, hm?”
always try to translate what I want to say, unlike some people who just run off without any explanation.”
Draco chews a bite of sausage far more slowly than needed and takes his sweet time washing it down with a gulp of water.
He winces against the brighter light and flicks it to drift toward the ceiling, if there is one. It sputters out about fifty feet up, but the shelves end right about there, anyhow. Books. The entirety of it, just fucking
“I’m not a dog.” Harry rolls his eyes, even as he rolls over and crawls to the pillow. It crushes under his weight, and he crosses his ankles in front of him while fixing Draco with a level glare. “Why am I-”
“Huh,” Harry puffs out, inches from Draco’s lips. “We never used to-”
“Mm hm.” Harry buries his face in Draco’s shoulder and thrusts deeper. Harder.
Harry releases Draco’s wrist and wraps an arm around his waist, and another around his chest. His lips slide along the drying skin of Draco’s shoulder, and he sighs, hips to hips, shoulders to shoulders.
Harry forces his gaze away from Malfoy’s fingers, back to his paperwork. He leans forward on the desk, and the box in his pocket digs into his ribs in a sharp rebuke.
“Harry Potter, this is not your home.”
“You’re one to talk.” Draco’s hands, pressed flat and fingers splayed, slide up Harry’s chest, and his fingers close, trapping hair. “When did you decide to grow
12 Grimmauld Place, London
A long spiral of dried blood decorates the bannister, twisting around it in a morbid, out of season Christmas garland. The corner of the wall at the top of the stairs is broken off at head height, plaster crumbling onto the floor at his feet as he turns into the hallway. More gouges run across the floor, but whatever made them has disappeared.
The dull ache at the base of his spine grows, and his rhythm falters just as Draco’s arm picks up a frantic pace. Tension pulls his lips into a tight line and curls his toes under with a sharp burn.
“Very good.” Kreacher’s humanity slides back into place—a civil facade.
“Oh,” Draco sighs, sitting up straight, a heel digging into Harry’s pubic bone. “Sorry. False alarm.”
Harry shoves his lit wand between the books near the head of the bed and scans the room as he removes the wreath from his hair. A curl snags on the dried vines, and he grimaces as it pulls free. Near the door, a black velvet jewelry box eats the light.
As fast as it came, the rain stops, as if those long-dead weather gods simply turned the spigot off and wiped the clouds away like smudges on glass. Raindrops, latecomers in the storm, linger on the windows and glitter in the breaking sunlight.
The bench is still smooth in a coarse kind of way, but the towels aren’t as soft, and a cold breeze flits through the room as he stuffs his robes in his locker. The jewelry box doesn’t fit in his jeans pocket very well, but it doesn’t need to stay there long.
are the worst thing to happen to me, Harry.”
“No,” Robards sighs, “just you. They’ll get a formal reprimand on their transcripts, but it won’t mean much unless they have other infractions. Only one does. Confidentially, it’s just enough for me to get rid of someone that deserves it. You can probably guess who.”
And there it is, plain as day. Ten inches of polished hawthorn, wedged between a stack of file folders and the edge of the drawer. It’s in his pocket, hidden inside the rolled-up papers, and he’s approaching the Atrium Floos before it hits him that he’s carrying stolen evidence from the Head Auror’s office.
“Master Black?”
“What?” Harry swallows past a lump in his throat and ignores the vindictive burn of a weightless paper crane against his chest.
Seamus’ chest rises and falls in an amused chuckle. Dean’s eyes go wide, followed by his mouth.
An unfamiliar pink newspaper lays on the front steps next to the pot of geraniums, and he huffs out a surprised breath. Ginny would use the Financial Times for kindling. The door starts to swing shut and he tosses the paper on the shoe mat.
“Hey.” Fingers thread up into Harry’s hair and grip tightly, immobilizing him with a gasp. “I seem to remember your pristine arse and my tongue being rather fond of each other.”
He moves, simply matching Draco, and it’s the apology that was never meant to be spoken, forgiveness that wasn’t meant to be heard.
Draco’s fingers slick his hair back, water cascading down and sluicing off his spine to slap against the copper.
chapter contains mentions of alcohol & the war/grieving (nothing too heavy!)
Grumbling, Seamus rolled his eyes. “Whatever. I got Gin.”
Harry looked up from where he’d been directing a fond glare at Hermione when he heard Arthur’s excited announcement. Still wearing the Santa outfit he’d given out gifts in earlier, his face was alight with the something akin to the fascination of when he’d finally understood the mechanics of electricity. Spotting him and Hermione, Arthur waved with his spare hand and made a beeline for the couch they occupied.
Looking up, Harry welcomed the distraction from his work until his brain caught up to his ears. Panic came over him, eyes widening as he spoke slowly. “I thought we agreed that a divorce was for the best.”
Harry smiled into her hair, blaming the Firewhiskey for how emotional he was feeling. “Thanks, ‘Mione. Love you too.”
“I’ve been planning for the worst since the day the Dark Lord came back. It’s in my nature.”
“I’d like to remind you that we’re seeing my parents tonight, and I’d much rather you not outright hate me across the dinner table. Lovely to meet you Harry, please don’t keep him too long. We’ve reservations at 6pm.”
“Oh.” Harry’s eyes widened as he felt his breath catch in his throat. “Yeah, sure.”
“You did?” Harry asked James. He glanced at Ginny, who gave him a slight nod.
“—they weren’t orders, he wants to do it—“
Seamus winked. “And then some. They’re grabbing dinner, for a start.”
“I don’t really want to,” he admitted after a moment.
“I can so! It’s definitely not
“Concerning the patient, Miss…?”
so close to the end now aaaahhh x
“Probably not, yeah.” Harry waited a few moments for the answer that didn’t come. “Are you going to tell me?”
Though he hadn’t meant it to sound so nervous, his voice was still infinitely calmer than he felt inside. Sucking up every ounce of courage he had, Harry kept his chin up defiantly and met Malfoy’s quizzical gaze head on, refusing to back down or look away.
“Bloody terrifying,” Draco agreed with a short laugh. “Though hopefully by then it’ll feel less…” He trailed off, but Harry knew exactly what he was referring to. It was the prickling feeling on their skin, the nausea that wouldn’t quite sit still. Something that only time and patience would be able to navigate.
Sick of feeling like he was the butt of all jokes lately, Harry pouted into his marshmallows and glared at Draco over the excessive amount of whipped cream that topped his drink. He watched as the other man rolled his eyes and cast a surreptitious wandless cooling charm on his mug.
“Hey!” Harry laughed, shaking his head as she sent an evil grin his way. “That was a low blow, ‘Mione.”
Sighing, Astoria glanced towards her husband before leaning in closer to Harry to speak. “Because neither of you wants to be publicly outed in your affections, and yet there’s too much history to be discussed before you can be within speaking distance of one another without addressing it?”
Leaning back in the armchair opposite his, Draco shrugged lazily. “Well enough, I suppose.”
“Draco, that’s not what I mean.” He sighed, the weight falling on his shoulders seemingly ageing him at least forty years. “Like… The Astronomy Tower, Room of Requirement. Big things. The Great Hall, though I think we’re both managing there okay. I guess Malfoy Manor for me, maybe for you too? Oh. Hogwarts Express,” he said as he gestured towards his nose with a sideways glance before rolling his eyes. “Should I continue, or do you get the point?”
“Alright. I’m only going to say this once, mind you.” She took a deep breath, fiery gaze staring into his soul. “You’re incredibly selfish and stubborn, Harry. I was the same. I stayed because it was the right thing to do, and I don’t regret it, but there is a world out there that we haven’t been part of. We settled down so quickly, we were so thankful to be alive after the war that we didn’t give ourselves much of a chance to live.” Pausing to look down at her stomach, Ginny smiled, voice low when she spoke again. “I know you still don’t think you deserve more than this. Merlin, you don’t even think you deserve this some days. I see the way you look at James and Albus. You’re living in the past, blaming yourself for all the loss and you don’t need to keep putting yourself through that.”
“Hello? Hello?” Came the voice from the receiver.
“So aside from the Dementor thing, which we have decided I can’t blame you for, have I missed anything horrible?”
Percy’s eyes seemed to scan the table, whether hoping for someone to disagree or challenging them all to add their voices to the argument, Harry was unsure. After a few terse moments he stood, slamming down the glass he’d been holding. Watching as the Butterbeer sloshed its way over the brim of the glass, Harry barely heard Percy depart over the rage that flooded his senses. It took a few moments before he could tear his eyes away from the slowly pooling liquid, glancing sideways to see Draco sitting stunned, face a shade so pale he was almost translucent.
Turning to see where Teddy’s trunk had ended up before he sent the young boy clambering onto the train without it, Harry saw Draco carrying it effortlessly a few strides behind him. Sending him a grateful smile he gestured towards it, watching Teddy grab the trunk before throwing his spare arm awkwardly around Draco first, then Andromeda. Harry was last in the lineup, taking a trunk to the back of his legs and wincing as he hugged his godson goodbye for the next few months.
With a short, breathless laugh, Harry shook his head. “Of all the things you could say sorry for…” Trailing off, he saw Draco avert his eyes to the mess they’d made of his study. “That wasn’t the one I came here for. If anything, I should be sorry for getting carried away.”
Draco Malfoy could be pining over Harry Potter, no, not at all!”
“I know. I saw you leave the pub.” Shifting awkwardly in the hallway, Malfoy grimaced. “If you’d prefer I ignored the invitation, I can leave.”
“Blimey, Harry. Sometimes I worry about you, mate. They’re going on a date tonight, you idiot.”
A crease appeared between Draco’s brows. “You made it quite clear where you stood when it came to us. I didn’t think there was any point.”
“You sent me a letter saying you didn’t know if you could be with me after all, and then I didn’t hear from you again.” Voice raising with every word, Draco stood up from his chair and threw his hands up in the air. “What was I supposed to think?”
“I’d best be off,” Andromeda said to their left, startling Harry out of his emotions. “You’ll both be here for Christmas holidays, of course?”
Speaking quietly, Draco looked towards the crackling fire. “Do you remember what you said last year? When the papers found out about us?”
Harry tipped back the rest of his drink before clearing his throat. “Have you just come over here to embarrass me then? I thought Gin was doing a good enough job of that on her own.”
Rolling over onto his back Harry saw the moonlight casting shadows as it streamed in through the open curtains. What did he want to be? He had fantasised about having a family not so long ago. About being an Auror, and marrying Ginny and being one of the Weasleys and now… Well. He felt unprepared for any of that. Uninspired, even. But was that simply a general life feeling or his new thoughts on his old dream? He would have to address it all soon enough. There was only so much avoiding he could do when he spent so much time at both the Ministry and the Burrow.
Harry felt his breath hitch as Draco reached out a hand to brush snow off his hat, making its way down to the tangled curls that stuck out beneath it before resting on the side of his face. The world stood stood still as he froze, eyes meeting Draco’s in a whirlwind of emotion.
in return along with his thanks, overjoyed that Draco’s owl had been instructed to wait for a response. As he watched her fly off into the night he felt his heart swelling; he wasn’t stupid enough to read too much into this, this time around. But Draco had extended the olive branch to at least be civil with one another and Harry was gladly taking it, grateful for the promise it held.
and Harry had quite the soft spot for her.
“Explain then,” he grumbled, slumping to lean his chin on one of his arms.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Harry, you—”
“Consider it forgotten.”
“All what?”
Cheeks heating at Draco’s smirk, Harry hurriedly made to defend himself. “I am! I mean, I was. I just got distracted by the snow around you.”
She sighed. “Don’t worry about it. How are you feeling after all that?”
“No, no! I just wasn’t expecting to see you here. At my house. On my stairs. You know?”
“Yeah, one of the boys in my class told everyone about you when we learned about dragons.” With a shrug, James put his cutlery down to look questioningly at Harry. “Mum said that story was made up.”
actually approve of and accept him—the irony of Draco needing the Weasley’s approval not lost on him—and breathed a sigh of relief when he finally came around to the idea that the conflict had centred around Percy’s wankerish behaviour rather than a decades-brewed mistrust in him personally.
The words were possibly the truest he’d spoken as of late, yet Harry hadn’t realised how much he felt that way until they were out of his mouth. Watching as Ginny tried to blink away the streams of tears, he felt his heart breaking as he reminded himself that this was the right choice for both of them. Ginny deserved better than a predetermined future, she deserved better than what Harry could ever give her. He just wished it didn’t have to feel like it was destroying them both in the process.
“I’m terrified,” Draco admitted after a moment. “At first, I thought it was because of what the world would say. This study was my father’s, you know. I haven’t seen him since Mother’s wake,” he added with a sigh, a sadness seeming to come over him. “He’d be horrified if he saw what I’d become.”
“Master Harry looks much better!” Kreacher exclaimed, bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet. “Kreacher will be back to clean while Master is gone.”
“Liar. Tomorrow night?”
She snorted, shaking her head as she looked at the table between them. “Yeah. Yeah, I guess it would. I’ve been thinking about it for a while now, but I guess I just… I don’t know. I hoped I was wrong.”
“I’ve got to keep the family name going. Have a Malfoy heir.”
“Not-friends,” Harry supplied.
“—Hermione doesn’t like you cleaning, she thinks it’s—“
“My dad wrote to me about it yesterday,” the young Malfoy said with a serious tone.
At her pause, Harry nodded slowly. “So… I can leave?”
“What? You saw what?” Ron’s concern was apparent and Harry cursed whatever had come over him.
“Y’know…” He started, stepping into place beside Hermione where she waited at the pedestrian crossing. “Healer Benson said I should talk to someone about my problems.”
“No, Harry. Just not a fan of girls.”
Shaking her head, Ginny looked up at him from beneath glistening lashes. “We both lost a lot. You wanted a family, and I… Right now, I think I need a drink.” Turning to pick up her wand from where she’d left it beside the sink, Ginny summoned two glasses and looked back over her shoulder at Harry. “Do we still have the brandy?”
“Why am I making tea? I’m the one with a literal human growing inside me.”
The only mention he’d seen of Draco that year was the word the papers brought. There hadn’t been much—not for lack of searching, he’d practically torn the
chapter inspired by
“You don’t do that here?”
“Oh.” Harry blinked a few times, unsure what to make of that. “Hmm. That’s definitely not what I thought started that. Thought it was just a bit too much wine and… I don’t know. Excitement that we decided to stop being married? Guess that doesn’t make much sense when I say it out loud.” He paused, looking up at Ginny’s amused face. “You really think me talking about my feelings is sexy?”
“I had no idea,” Harry whispered. “All this time…”
“I can hear you thinking,” Draco mused with a fond smile.
Feeling giddy with festive spirit and warm with appreciation for how far they’d come, Harry ordered a matching drink and echoed Draco’s soft smile.
Two lives, two loves became one
Harry shrugged, unsure of how he felt on the matter. “Honestly, I’m not fussed either way. I’ve never had a pet that wasn’t an owl.”
He knew you were scared
“Oh?” A hint of interest had crept into Draco’s voice, eyes still not daring to look up.
They were sprawled across the floor at this point, leaning their backs against the couch. Harry had shrugged off his coat and jumper as the alcohol had started to warm him up a bit. Ron was flushed, unable to remove the horrendous sweater that George had forced onto him; they’d had a bet going at the shop all year and having lost, the Jingle My Bells innuendo was a permanent fixture across Ron’s for at least the next 32 hours. It had been funny when Harry first spotted it but now Ron wouldn’t stop complaining about how itchy it was getting, leaving him hoping that Hermione would know a spell to at least alleviate the discomfort.
“Of course. I should really get going anyway.”
“Because I was scared!”
Reclining abruptly, Draco grimaced. “You can’t… Why are you even telling me this? We can’t do this. We can’t talk if you’re going through this with your wife.”
Glances head straight to your heart
“Yeah,” Harry said, thinking back over their time together. Even in just the past year alone he’d seen a different side to Draco; they hadn’t spent more than a few days out of each month together, but it was incredibly to see how far they’d come. He could see it now though, how coloured Draco’s words and actions were by what Harry’d thought to be stubbornness but now recognised as potentially something more. Self preservation, to start, but Hermione seemed close to the mark when she said he probably still placed a lot of blame and need for penance onto himself.
“You as well,” he said, accepting the kisses that landed on each of his cheeks. “You’ve met my, er, Ginny. Gin, this is Astoria Malfoy.”
“Most would take it as a compliment, but most aren’t as dense as you.”
“My dad said he’s a Death Eater. Your parents were killed by them,” he said, directing his words back to Teddy now as he pointed at the stag. “And he was one of them.”
“No crueller than keeping him as a slave to begin with,” she murmured.
“So… What do you say? More than just
He carefully put the crate aside and cast a cushioning charm around it, wary of customers tripping over it while he had his back turned. Only took an accident to happen once before you knew better than to tempt fate ever again.
“I have changed!”
Shacklebolt was leading the hearing and his voice—though low in volume—drew everyone to attention. Calling the session to order, shuffling was heard as the crowd presumably settled into their seats.
“You wish you weren’t interested?” Draco’s voice was cautious, guarded, eyes trained on Harry like he was a Basilisk about to strike.
His eyes were locked on the stone floor beneath his feet as the guards either side of him forced him into the chair in the center of the room. Hardly daring to breathe for fear it would be too loud in the silence that surrounded him, Draco clenched his fists as tightly as he could with his hands shackled together and hoped desperately that the shake he could feel in his body wasn’t as outwardly obvious as it was for him.
Relaxing into the fingers working their magic on his stiff shoulders, Harry let his eyes float slightly shut and enjoyed the sound of the crackling fire that filled the room. From beneath his half-closed eyelids Harry could see the three boys sitting on the couch opposite him, feet dangling above the floor clad in matching woollen socks. The entire family had a pair; Lily had demanded matching Christmas outfits and this was as far as they’d gotten without too much complaint from the boys. His were visible where his legs stretched out before him on the floor, Draco’s somewhere beside him as Harry sat leaning against the chair he occupied, nestled between his legs.
“Harry!”
The clock counted down the seconds to midnight and Harry shouted along with the rest of them.
enjoy my crazed experiment at writing something epilogue compliant but also cute and festive xx
Harry didn’t let himself watch Draco walk away, directing all of his attention towards finishing the drink before him even as the taste was bittered by the conversation he’d never expected to have.
Faltering mid-sentence, the man’s shoulders froze before his head slowly turned to meet Harry’s gaze. There was a desperate look to his eyes, one Harry knew too well; he often saw it on the people he apprehended in the field as they realised there was no escape.
Nodding before reaching to tangle his fingers with Draco’s around the woolen scarf, Harry whispered back. “What’s mine is yours. All of it. I’m yours.”
“So you are?” Harry looked back towards where Draco sat, confused by what to believe.
With an earsplitting grin, Harry watched as Draco left the room and tried not to dwell on the warmth spreading through him.
“I usually am.”
There were only a few days until Christmas and Harry was in a frantic rush to buy the last of the presents he needed. Auror training had run overtime and now he was cutting it fine to make it back before the end of lunch. Why had he left this until the last minute again?
“Planning to ask him out any time soon?”
Salazar, they had witnesses. Draco hadn’t even thought about who might be called on to speak during his trial. He doubted anyone in his family would be allowed to take the stand and his fellow Slytherins who’d been with him through the last few years were in Ministry custody or unable to be located from what he’d read.

“Lee Jordan isn’t on our records this quarter. Did you want me to go back further?”
“Did you mean that?”
Funny how he’d spent years of his life wishing Malfoy ill and now that he had the power to send the git away, he was trying to save his ass. It just didn’t feel right after all they’d been through to leave things as they were. Not after Malfoy saved his life in the Manor. Not after seeing the fear in his eyes during those moments in the Room of Requirement. Did Harry wish that Malfoy had chosen a different option back in sixth year? Of course. Did he hate him for it? Honestly… He wasn’t sure anymore. It was hard to have hatred for anything these days. He just felt a constant sense of exhaustion and emptiness.
“Seeing as you only send them once every other month quoting very obscure hours of availability, I can hardly be held responsible for that.” The way Malfoy managed to sound so refined, so put together even as he begun to look slightly dishevelled was infuriating. Harry also couldn’t help but notice that Malfoy’s hair looked
It was nothing he wasn’t already painfully aware of. He just didn’t know how to tell her that sleep wasn’t on his side these days, any more than it had been back in fifth year with the dreams.
Then again, he hadn’t intended on wearing down a path in his bedroom carpet either. Yet here he was.
“And because neither of them has the self restraint to not make a scene,” Ginny added. “You’ll likely just end up pushing him against a wall and doing unimaginable things to one another at a Ministry function.”
“I won’t push it any more right now,” she said, deflating. “Just… Just know you can talk to me about it, okay?”
Gulping beside her, Harry gave a short nod. “Got it. Do your thing, ‘Mione.”
“We’d love to, Andromeda. Thanks.” Ignoring the grumble to his right, Harry took it from Andromeda and took great pleasure upon noticing that it was embellished with red and gold. Offering it to Draco, he smiled smugly. “Scared, Malfoy?”
Snorting, Malfoy looked back to where Harry stood expectantly. “What’s it to you if I am?”
Healer Benson raised an eyebrow at him. “With your health is what I was referring to. Do you understand the colours?”
Harry nodded his understanding. “Don’t worry, I’ve done my experimenting.”
, he thought, not for the first time today.
“But you don’t know how to be around me. So you probably don’t want me, then.”
The silence that followed was even worse than if she’d been shouting, because it meant that Hermione was mad. Really, really mad.
Maybe Draco heard the unintentional undertone in Harry's words, maybe Harry's thoughts were written plain across his face. Either way, Draco picked up on what, or more precisely, who Harry was referring to and sighed. “I’m not leaving my wife, Harry.”
Like where he stands now
“Can’t you just, I don’t know. Have a kid together, sure, but marry whoever you want anyway?”
“Oh Merlin, that’s disgusting.” She placed the glass in front of her, turning her eyes back on Harry once more. “Okay, so. I guess you already felt like part of my family and we didn’t question if it needed to be more than that. I don’t know. I’m not saying we did something we shouldn’t have done, or that any of it wasn’t real. Does that make sense?”
Whether everyone else in the room knew Voldemort was there or not, Harry couldn’t be sure. All he was aware of was the pounding in his ears and the constricted flow of air in his windpipe before the room started to go black and his senses were overcome with fear.
His initial thought had been one of panic, followed by confusion: could wizards even get heart attacks? Harry was yet to hear about someone dying from anything other than old age or magical reasons. He supposed he could ask Hermione but he didn’t want to worry her and she would no doubt send him back to St Mungos if heart attacks were a viable cause of death in the magical world.
Harry grumbled into his eggnog, taking a long sip as he ignored Malfoy’s chuckle across from him. Maybe ignored was the wrong word for what he was doing; the sound was carefree, genuine, something Harry had yet to really appreciate from the blonde, so he refused to respond but instead let it play over in his mind for a while before resting his glass atop his knee.
Catching Harry’s expression, Ginny silenced them with the promise that they’d discuss it another day and turned the conversation to lighter topics. Listening idly as he mind churned the fact that his son was best friends with Draco’s son, Harry had to laugh at the irony.
“This doesn’t seem suspicious to either of you?”
chapter inspired by
Certain of the fact that he saw James wink at Draco as he left the room, Harry again turned to the man behind him, demanding answers.
“What?”
“Not quite,” she said with a cheeky grin. “At least, I wasn’t.”
“You ‘right?” Harry called back. “Come here, one sec.”
Looking around them and taking in the stupid rainbow tree, James whispering something in Rose’s ear while Albus stole a toy from the pile in front of her…Framed photos of their friends and family on the mantelpiece, a suspiciously Slinky-shaped lump under the throw blanket on the couch… The home they’d built as a family. The life he had made and the knowledge that no matter what happened outside of these walls, he always had this. He turned back to see Hermione smiling at him and he could see that she knew exactly what was going through his head.
Ron and Hermione shared one of their looks, taking a moment of hesitation.
“Draco?”
“Guess the holiday will do them good at any rate.”
Harry shuddered as the charm struck him between his eyes and closed them, waiting until the tingles that spread across his face had disappeared. When he looked up again he saw Hermione nodding her approval, even as disappointment coloured her features.
Turning to Ginny with a strained smile, Draco nodded by way of greeting. “Apologies. I didn’t intend to intrude on your Christmas.”
nervous. Harry
“What I’m saying, Harry, is that he’s blinded by generations of prejudice—and inbreeding, to be quite frank with you. Scorpius has helped him to want better than that, but for our son, not for himself. You’re on the galleon when you say he doesn’t think he deserves the happy ending you could be for him.”
“Sorry, Hermione. I’ll tell you next time.”
Malfoy laughed, a rich, warm sound that filled Harry’s chest with something he didn’t want to examine too closely. “Fine. Just because you asked so nicely.” Picking up his glass, Malfoy took another sip as he seemed to think on how best to phrase his words. “It started in Azkaban. Something that one of the Muggleborn inmates suggested, actually. Apparently it’s quite common among the Muggles he grew up with and well, when you’re incarcerated through the holidays you cling onto what little you can. There were only a few of us who agreed in the end—five, to be exact—and we kept doing it in the years that followed.”
Sighing, Harry looked at the gentle pity in her eyes before taking a long drink from the mulled wine, cinnamon and orange rolling over his tastebuds. “Honestly? I’m not sure he ever will.”
Harry nodded, heart racing as he considered whether he felt more terror or excitement at the prospect being presented to him. Equal parts of both, if he was being honest with himself.
Ginny was hiccuping between laughs now, tears forming in her eyes. “Sorry, Harry. I just—“
Folding his arms across his chest, Harry huffed. “Well, maybe sorry isn’t enough.”
Harry let out a shaky laugh. “I doubt it, Gin. But thank you.”
Harry mindlessly ran a hand through his hair, nodding behind Hermione to indicate Ron’s imminent return. Trying not to fixate too closely on Hermione’s previous words, he instead took a long drink from the Butterbeer he’d been handed as he half-listened to Ron recount the trials of the day that Harry had thankfully been able to skip.
Laughing, the two of them came closer together as they watched the chaos unfurl before them. Harry felt Draco’s arm brush his, the contact welcome after an afternoon of trying to keep affection to a minimum. Looking up at Draco beside him, Harry saw the happiness he felt reflected back at him, a warmth spreading through him at being surrounded by people he loved.
The tears were flowing freely now and Harry moved forward to do something to comfort her but Ginny held up her hand as a way to keep him back. Pressing his lips together, Harry focused on breathing until she seemed ready to continue.
“You were?” Harry asked, slightly confused. “Well, you don’t need to be sorry. It was for the best.”
“Good,” came her reply, with a look on her face that he knew meant he wasn’t getting out of this agreement.
“I’m not sure leaving them to their own devices is a good idea,” Draco said as he watched them through the glass panels in the storefront. “Though I won’t complain for a few minutes of peace.”
Eager lips giving answers
“I… I can’t let Scorpius live with my mistakes. You’ve heard me say it a million times now, I know. What you don’t understand is that, well, I know that the more time I spend with you, the more we do this…” Draco sighed, following it with an empty laugh. “Harry, I’ll never want it to end.”
Harry stayed silent, unsure of where he was going with this train of thought. He watched Draco’s brow furrow as one hand pulled at the end of his scarf, the only tells that he was still slightly hesitant to share what was on his mind.
Ginny crossed the room to hand him the first of the drinks before taking a seat at the table, slumping back against the wooden chair and downing half of her brandy in one.
“That will be alright, Miss—”
“Shut it, you prat.”
“What?” Harry felt a chill to his bones, unsure of what had brought about this behaviour. It had been so long since he’d had to defend Draco… He certainly wasn’t expecting it from someone who had spent as much time with him as Nick. “Where did you hear that?”
Another big perk of quitting was that he had been able to avoid most Ministry functions since then.
The rest of their time together was overshadowed by the news; Harry knew Ron was trying to lift his mood and though he hoped he didn’t seem too consumed by his own thoughts he suspected his lack of focus was obvious. After a few more glasses he had bid Ron adieu, flooing home and immediately dropping into his favourite chair by the fire. This was hardly unexpected; Draco had sent news of Astoria’s pregnancy in his final letter earlier this year. It had just shocked him to find out about it secondhand through an article. He’d hoped to at least hear some word from Draco about it, not have his best mate clue him in and then send him concerned looks for the following hour.
Cursing himself for how small he both sounded and felt, Draco picked up the end of his scarf and started tugging at a thread to avoid Harry’s gaze. It wasn’t that he’d been hoping Harry would tell him he was the same, or that it didn’t matter because he loved him anyway, no. Those feelings could die in Fiendfyre for all he cared.
“I see.” Harry frowned, leaving Draco resisting the urge to smooth out the crinkling skin between his eyebrows. “So… Just not a fan of dark hair?”
“Scorp says a lot of things,” Albus said solemnly. “He’s very wise.”
“That’s the problem though. I mean, I don’t know. Some days I wonder if we jumped in too quick.”
He could hear the truth in her words, made all the more powerful by how fervently she believed them. “So… You think I should quit my job.”
The rest of dinner passed in a daze, Harry’s thoughts a whirlwind of every encounter he’d ever had with Draco and Al’s offhand comments about their divorce.
No. It was better this way, he reasoned. They were already worried enough about his health. Nobody needed to know about Dumbledore’s parting gift, or what really happened in the forest that night.
She sighed. “Look at me, Harry.”
There was a soft smile on Draco’s face as he began his reply. “Think of the love you have for Weasley—not Ginevra, the other one—and Granger. It might not be quite the same; we hardly fought a Dark Lord together. Still, we’re in this marriage for the same mutually beneficial reasons and are fond enough of one another to make it work. Our child will want for nothing.”
“We’ll be seeing you at Andromeda’s next week?” Harry asked.
“I don’t think so?”
He was in Azkaban, of all places. The wizarding prison. Somewhere reserved for criminals and as his father always put it, people stupid enough to get caught. He should feel ashamed, hopeless, resigned to a life of misery and despair. But all that aside, he actually felt quite calm for the first time in as long as he could remember. True, he was in a barren cell made of century-old concrete worn down by pacing and filled with the lingering presence of the dementors. But he wasn't under You-Know-Who's reign anymore. He didn't have to watch his back at every turn, even in his own manor. He didn't have to constantly deploy Occlumency shields at every waking moment in fear that the Dark Lord would hear his inner thoughts, fears and fruitless dreams of defecting to the other side. Not that he would have ever been able to desert his family and friends. He just wished he hadn't been stuck without a choice in the first place. So yes, it sucked that he was in prison for an indefinite period. But he felt so much less like his life was at risk and for now that was enough to make him almost grateful to the witches and wizards who had put him here.
The kisses burned against his lips, the feel of Draco remembered in his arms.
'So,'  Seamus sat down beside Ron, expecting every pair of eyes to turn in his direction.  He was not disapointed.  'Justin was talking to Dean, who of course told Ginny, who then spoke to Pavati, who caught Terry, who then told me...'
He even had his own private bathroom, something he never had growing up in luxury in the Manor.
He drifted in a black sea of raw pain, the only light came from the boy who held onto him, dragging him back from the darkness.
'Yes, most of the time.  I had to make their bed, my cousin's too, when I didn't have one of my own.  I hate them for that.  So many time I wished I could get into one of the beds I had just finished.  It always looked so soft and inviting.  But I knew I would only get punished.'
It was stupid, unnecessary and quite frankly, embarrassing.
On shuffling feet, he ambled around the empty hallways, thankfully dinner was still going on, and it would be a while yet before he needed to make a decision and head back to the common room, or, most likely, not bother at all.
'It's a Muggle story, a classic written a long, long time ago.  It's about this little boy who doesn't have a family.  His parents are dead, people are cruel to him.  He is all alone in the world, and his life is pretty rubbish.'
The stone floor changed to grass under his feet.  Soft underfoot and damp, the night-time dew already soaking into the slippers he wore.  Harry's slippers.  Everything that touched him belonged to Harry.  He couldn't bear the thought of anything else.
'You see them, Draco?  You see them dance for you?'  A sibilant voice, worming its dirty way into his veins.  Sticking to his limbs, draging him down into the Hell that had been created for him.  His dead parents whirling around the Cell.  'Join them, Draco.'  Cold fingers touching his shackled ankles, creeping ever higher.  'Look at how they want you.'
'Well,'  Filch looked like he was considering Harry's tall tale.  'Go fetch it then, and straight back to your House.'  With a put upon sigh, Filch turned away from him, back to his night-time patrols, the ever suspicious Mrs Norris close to his heels.
There was no place in the castle where the walls didn't bleed out memories.
Draco picked up the spoon.
Draco couldn't know what had come over him.  Whether it was her hand on him, or the soft look in her pretty eyes, but he found himself nodding.
'Are you leaving?'  Ron sighed.  'Tell me you are.'
It could all be okay.  Malfoy would leave, Harry would forget him, they would all be happy again.  Quidditch and flying and feasts in the Great Hall.  Hermione badgering them over their incomplete homework.  Back to The Burrow for Mum's anticipated party.
And Him.  It always came back to Him.
They could all see, each and every one of them, freely stepping into his deepest, darkest secret, unveiled in the school he had once loved.
So what if Malfoy loved Harry?  So what if Harry loved him back?
Sopping wet clothes clung to his frigid skin, soaked strands of dark hair plastered to his face.  Harry didn't notice any of it, his thoughts solely on Draco.
'I...I don't have anywhere else to go.'  Draco finally spoke.  'I d...don't have a home.  There is no money.  There is no one.  I...I want to stay here.'
He should have killed him, he was meant to kill him.
'Why don't you read something?'  Hermione suggested kindly, looking up to briefly touching his shoulder as he let out yet another protracted sigh.  'You still have that Charms essay to finish, you could do that.'  Her helpful ideas were met with a withering look from her bored boyfriend.
He felt his eyes fill.  Furious at himself.  He had already had to stop on his short walk here to compose himself.  It would not do to appear at Draco's bedside with salty tears running rivers down his cheeks.  He had to be strong, had to get Draco through this.  He owed it to him to tell him everything, including his betrayal.
It took him a long moment to catch his breath.  Draco leaned his weary body against the wall of the empty corridor, allowing his head to thunk against the hard stone behind him.  He still held his bag before him, his fingers cramping from the tight grip.
'You don't have to take it, you don't even have to touch it.  But it is yours.'  She told him gently, carefully chosing her words.  'It may not be compatible with you, that is something we shall learn, together.'
'I do love you, Potter.'  Draco smiled softly as he sunk into Harry's shaking embrace.
There were letters inside, beautiful letters full of flowing script and a poetic style that was all his mother.  Her handwriting flawless, much like the woman herself.  She loved him dearly, she told him so in each and every delivery.
Theo didn't get the chance to blink, let alone offer up an apology for the devastation he had caused before Harry's hand was tight around his throat, his back forced up against the rough wall, his head slamming against a blunt jut of stonework.
So when had this card, clutched in his damp and dirty hand, become so important?
'I need to start getting better, Harry.'  He stopped him before Harry could continue.  'As much as I would love to stay in here forever, Madam Pomfrey would never allow me to fester in my hermitage.'
His feet heavy on the flagstones, his breath panting and raw as he turned the corner and was hit by a wall of silence.
It was a nice room, lovely in fact.
'And where do you suggest he goes?'  Slughorn frowned, leaning back in the chair and appraising Harry.
His eyes screwed up against that all pervading darkness.  Outside, his mind chanted.  Outside.  Not there, never there again.
'I've handed in my Captaincy.  I'm not going to play Quidditch any more.'  Harry blurted.
Down on his knees, his hand fisted in blond hair that hung in lank, sparse patches.  Draco's head wrenched upwards, forced to look at what awaited him.  This was his future, his past and present.
After that, the kiss that had changed everything, there was nothing.
'I'm so tired.'  Draco sighed.  'If you had said all that when I first started Hogwarts, I would have agreed with you completely.  But now, after everything, I'm not sure I have any energy left to fight.'
'Oh.'  Her voice softened.  'Yeah, it's hard to think of anything else, isn't it.'
'You need to go.'  She told him, even though her fingers tightened painfully.  'Before anyone figures out it was you.'  Her eyes strayed to Potter's back.  He was moving, rising from the floor like a feral spector from a distant dream.  Pure rage crackled in the air around his taut body as he slowly turned towards them all, his wand still raised.  Stone dust covering his robes, caked in his dark hair as the destruction continued to settle around him.
'Are you going to sleep?'
He hadn't survived, he had been condemned to live.
He had promised himself long ago that he would not allow anyone to find him in the worst way.  And he had stuck to that promise even when the darkness called his name.
'We are doing all we can for him, Harry.'
Ron hadn't looked at him before.  Not really, not since he had come to live in Gryffindor Tower.  But locking his eyes on that pale figure, barefoot and shivering, Ron realised that there was something wrong with Malfoy.  Something really wrong.
The corridors were silent, the commotion had finally moved to the Great Hall, and Professor McGonagall knew she had to be the one to take the stand before the waiting eyes and the expectant faces, and deliver an explanation that would suffice.
'I...'  Draco stuttered.  'I wish I could give you more.'  He felt heat flood his face.  'You should have all you want.'
'No, you're right, it's too soon, forget I even mentioned it.'
Harry Potter was not his friend, and this man in the middle of the blasted corridor was someone he no longer recognised.
September bled into October, the nights grew darker.  Draco's progress was slow, painful.
Draco couldn't breathe.
He knew had to get this done quickly, get the water running, make sure it was warm enough to help Draco's aching body.  Plenty of soothing, fragrant bubbles, perhaps some salt to help with the cuts he had picked up.  His hand...  Harry remembered sharply.  Draco had cut his hand.  Blood.  Thick and red and wet, pooling in his palm.  Glass.  It must have been from the glass in the window panes, glass that he had sent exploding all around the corridor.  How could he have been so fucking careless?
'I didn't see him fighting for the Light, did you?  For all you know, for all any of us know, he was out there,'  He lifted his hand, waving in the direction of the door.  'Fighting for Him.  For Voldemort.'
'I do.  Please.  For me?'  Harry asked, and Draco was lost.
But it would happen.
Harry had been convinced that the boy was dying.  He had waited for it, watching for his chest to stop moving, waiting for the pallor of death to seep into his ashen face.  To sit beside him, to watch the life slip from his tortured body...  He could never shake those thoughts, would never be rid of those feelings of utter helplessness.
'You are not like that, not now.'  Harry said quietly.
They got so far before Draco's feet refused to cooperate, he stumbled, tripped over the step into the castle.  Harry caught his fall, the door clattering loudly against the stone walls, sending dust motes and tiny shards of stone tumbling to the floor.
'Draco?'  She touched his shoulder, whispering his name into the silence of the Library. He awoke with a start, his pupils dilated, his breath coming in choking gasps.  'You cannot sleep here.'  She continued, aware that it took him a long time to realise where it was he had laid his tired head.
'It was my responsibility to care for Draco.'
Harry did nothing.
'Okay.'  One word and Harry was turning back towards the door.
He shivered in his t-shirt.  Wrapping his arms around himself did little to help.  He had left the common room with nothing.  His wand abandoned on the floor, along with any shred of dignity left to him.  He was a monster, pulling his wand on his best friend like that.
'I had money, I went out the very next day and replaced the lot.'  Harry grinned.  'All brand new, leather bindings.  I spent a fortune.'  He ran his hand over the immaculate cover.  'Never told anyone I had them.'
Draco Malfoy, just another name on the list of the dead and missing.
He could do all that was expected of him.  It was almost easy to play the part of Harry Potter in the daylight.
Memories crowded in close.  He couldn't think, couldn't remember.  Harry...
'He'll see me!'  He couldn't let go of Harry's hand.  'Please!'
'I'll never be good enough for him.'  A sob escaped as he buried his face into Draco's hair, his voice muffled now.  'I should have known, I should have listened all those years ago.  Stayed where I was, I was safe there, I couldn't hurt anyone there.  None of this would ever have happened.  Not one thing.'
Voldemort.
'How has any of this been your fault, Harry?'  She asked him gently.
He found that he couldn't tear his eyes away from the limping form as Draco carefully picked his way across the uneven path, his footsteps slow.  It pained him to walk so far.  There was a limit to how many times a hip could be shattered and repaired before it was ruined forever.  Draco had long gone past that point.
'I...  I can smell them.'  Draco murmured, his scarlet eyes flickering.  'All...  All over me...  Make it stop.  Please.'  He grasped at Harry's arm.  'I can't... can't...'
'Draco tells me you have been reading to him at night.'  She spoke quietly, ignoring Harry's latest outburst.  It was not surprising.
'What's that?'  Draco's eyes fell to the book held in Harry's lap.
'Draco...  I'm so sorry.'
'I can't be touched.'  Draco shook his head.  'You know that better than anyone.'
'A little.'  Draco told him quietly.  He wouldn't tell him about the nightmare.  He held onto to Harry's arms as he was gently pulled upright, propped against the pillows.  Holding onto Harry for a fraction of a second longer than usual.  Stupidly, he had missed him.
There was Malfoy, as bold as brass, sitting in the Potions classroom before anyone else, with his hand covering Slughorn's.
Tears, an admission of cowardice.  He didn't want to fight, and he hadn't.  A cursory examination of his wand confirmed that the last spell it had produced was a simple one.  Water.  Nothing wrong with that.
'You know how it is.'  Harry shrugged away the question.  'It's nice to be out.'  Raising his eyes to the azure sky, he was quick to change the subject.  Further questions would be most unwelcome.
His blinking eyes, his dark hair, his face forever claimed by history, misremembered deeds consigned to dusty history books, dutifully taught to bored students by equally bored teachers.
'I still don't understand why it took so long.'  She shot Ron a disapproving glare.
'I am eating!'  Again on the alert.  'At least I would be if you hadn't called me back.'  He crossed his arms, leaning back in the chair.  Fury flashing through his eyes.
He wanted to go to him, get him away from all of this, all of them.  All of those openly hostile eyes turned in his direction.  He knew what McGonagall was going to say, he tuned her words out, concentrated on the boy who could not look his way.
'You've been with him, haven't you.  Malfoy.'  Neville stated, his tone unplaceable.
'Go away, Hermione.'  Harry didn't look up from the book.  'I'm trying to read.'
The moment Draco sent Harry away he wanted him back.
'Draco stays here.'  Harry spoke, his tone resolute.  'If he goes into that place, he won't be coming out.  You know that.  They can't help him, not with this.'
A life with a pretty redhead on his arm, a metal band around his finger was what people wanted from him, and for a while Harry had believed that it was what he wanted too.  But it wasn't to be.  An unhappy ending to his already fractured life.  So what was it to be now?  A career in a profession he had never given a thought to before?  Harry had never expected to live long enough for that.
'I know.'  There was no anger this time, no barbed reply full of hostility.  Just quiet sadness.
'I...I wasn't looking for you.'  Harry stayed his feet, longing to advance, but afraid that Draco would disappear down the empty hallway.  'I wasn't...  I promise.'
'No.  You.'  He closed his eyes, ashamed by what he was about to confess.  'I...I can't have anyone else touch me.  I can't bear it.'
'I...I'm sorry.'
Harry would be able to take it all away.  He would lead him to his bed, settle him under the covers, heat his hot water bottle and climb in beside him.  He would hold him, kiss him, read to him.  Comfort him in any way he knew how.  Draco knew that Harry would be able to silence everything.
The Headmistress allowed herself a secret smile as she kept to her distance.  Harry was talking.  Whispered words that had Draco nodding, his face turned to Harry as they took tiny steps closer to their goal.  Draco was also smiling, his eyes slipping closed through sheer exhaustion, his expression warm as Harry leaned just that little bit closer, dusting a kiss to his pale cheeks.
And Harry.  Of course Harry.  Just the name running through his head raised a smile.  Harry bloody Potter.  Of all the people.  He would read to him, dry his tears, touch him when it was all just too much.  Sleep beside him, an arm wrapped closely when the nightmares threatened.  Chased them into the night, banished them with soft words, with gentle hands and sometimes, only sometimes, a soft, hardly felt, brush of lips against his trembling, tear stained face.
'You know how it feels to go through life without your parents, we both do.  But just imagine for one moment of the thoughts in their heads as they were forced to watch their only son being raped in front of them, powerless to do anything other than watch as he was tortured, his stomach carved up, his back shredded to ruins.  And think about how Draco felt when they were killed in front of him, made to live with their stinking corpses.'  Harry spat.  'I hope you are happy now that you finally know where I have been night after night.  He can't sleep, he's terrified to close his eyes.'
'Believe me, Malfoy, I don't.'  Ron stepped forward, instinct already reaching for the wand tucked in his back pocket.  'I know it's you, it's always you.  What have you done to him?  Tell me what you've done. Some curse, some dark magic?  Harry wouldn't touch you, disgusting, perverted little snake.'
'Perhaps.'  Ron admitted grudgingly.  'You think I've been a right arse, don't you?'
'Draco...'  Harry turned Draco's arm slowly, watching the shine of blood catch fractured light filtering through the steam.  'Did I do this too?  Like your hand?  All that glass...'
He slipped away unnoticed, all attention was on Seamus, heads from other tables turning to the commotion at the Gryffindor table.  Slytherin heads.
'You were born a wizard, you will reamain a wizard.  You do not need a wand to prove that.'
'Harry?'  Harry heard Neville at his back, his voice quiet.  He had almost forgotten there was anyone else in the room.  'Shall I fetch Madam Pomfrey?  Perhaps she could give him something to calm him down?  Help him get to sleep?'
Magic was who he was.  It was in his very blood, coursing thought his veins, buried deep within his bones.  He could wish it all away as much as he liked, but it was a part of him.
Those violating bodies could not wield wands when they were between his thighs.  Others could, of course.  As they jeered and laughed.  But mostly they watched.  Eyes glittering from under the masks they wore.  Impatiently waiting their own turn at the body he had become.  Drumming fingers against the Cell walls, calling out to get the job done.
They had talked about this.  Something that she wanted to try, one last thing, something that might help.  He knew it wouldn't.  But she was good to him, he owed her that much.
'No.  No, it's not.'  Draco took a shaky breath.  'I need to be normal, Harry.  I just don't remember how.'
'Where?'  Harry asked softly, still standing by the bed, his hands still twitching.
'Draco!'  Harry couldn't help but grin.
Only...
A soft noise from the open doorway startled him, and for the briefest second, hope flared brightly in his tight chest.
All the riches in the world could never compare to sitting in the dying firelight with Harry pressed to his back.  There would be no mansion in the countryside, there would be no vault filled with gold and jewels, there would be no wand to wield.
'Hurts...'  He choked, drawing blood from his bitten lip.  'Can't.'  Draco reached out, his hands grasping in thin air.  'Harry...'
It was useless, he had begged and begged Draco more times than he cared to count.  Let their friendship be known, consequences be damned.  Harry could deal with it, anything was better than watching him being slowly broken down.  Slowly becoming a shadow.
Yet here he was, despite it all, with that hand, Harry's gentle, kind hand buried in his hair.  The one he had never shook, the one that had refused him all those years ago.
'Not for me.  But for him, yes.  I wish all that, and more.'
It was that final Battle.  That War that had brought an end to so much.
But...  It was Harry's dressing gown cord.
'That's a good lad.'  The Professor nodded at him, already allowing himself to become distracted by the students who had begun to fill the classroom.  It was easier than confronting the truth of Draco's deception.
'Tell me what your Father would think of you, your dear Mother.'
So what if he had to stop and catch his breath?  Who would care that he jumped at his own shadow?  That he had to hold on to the walls just to make slow progress.  There wasn't anybody to see.  It didn't matter to anyone.
But she had never once thought his path would lead to Draco Malfoy.
It was a man in a bespoke suit, drawing his belt through tight loops.  Buttons popping open, trousers being parted.  A high laugh filling his ears.
'I can't stand this.'  Harry murmured so softly that Draco didn't hear him, could only feel him pulling away, coming around to face him.  'I...I need to see you, properly.'  Harry's fingers fluttered at his throat, undoing the ties that he had only just pulled together.
'I know you.'
'Neville knows what happened to you.'  Harry broke.  'I told him.  I...I was angry, he said things...  I should have w...walked away from him.'  The words spilling from Harry in a sobbing rush, he couldn't contain his hurt at what he had done to the boy in the bed.  'I'm so sorry.  It's not fair.  I...I told your secret, I was wrong.  I'm a shit.  Tell me to go, Draco.  You have to tell me, because...because I can't do it.  You have to say it.'
They waited for him.
He was the first in the room, Professor Slughorn blessing him with a weak, watery smile as he took his seat in the back of the dark Potions classroom.
'I want it to mean everything.'  Draco breathed softly, leaning closer once more.
'Oh, Draco.'  But there he was, warmth pressing against his back, settling the throb in his head.  Shaking hands around his waist, gently tugging him ever closer.  'Lean back, I've got you.  I won't let you fall.'
'Nightmare.'  Draco gagged on the word, fighting to make himself heard.  'You a...are only a...a nightmare.'
'Because...  Because I have to.  I look at his hut everyday, Harry.'  Draco explained softly.  'It holds too many ghosts.  Please, you have to understand, you have to let me do this.'
His own eyes dry, turning away from her.
'I know.'  He felt Harry sigh, they were still pressed together, Draco wrapped carefully in the furs once more.  Harry's hands soft on his sore back.
Drawing his knees to his chest, the bed felt huge, so accustomed to sharing it's space with Harry.  It was hard to finally be alone.  But he would never be alone, not really.
His Hermione.
'No.'  Firm, but with his eyes shining too brightly, Draco implored her.  'He doesn't need to know.  I'm not going to be a burden on him.  Harry has to leave eventually.  I don't want him to think that he has to stay.  That I cannot cope without him.'
The joke hadn't last.
He had allowed the nightmares to claim Draco back.  Back to that Cell, and the horrors within.
There were ways.  Lots and lots of ways.
Harry dreamed of alabaster skin and the shyest of smiles.  Of shared kisses in the dark and the taste of tears.  He dreamed of fingers laced with his own and the touch of warm skin.  He dreamed of whips and the smell of blood, the sound of screaming and the heartbreak of quiet sobs.
'Does it hurt you?  Your back?'  Harry whispered.
'There is something exquisitely pure in the suffering of the human form, don't you think?'  The monster had returned.  That cold body close to his, watching him, drawing a sharp fingernail across his sweating stomach.
'No...'  Draco murmured.  'Can't...I'll do anything.'  His head thrashed against the pillows.  'I...I'm s...s...sorry.  Please.'  His eyes screwed shut in pain, Draco was trapped in his waking nightmare.
'Do you think that's enough?'  Ron seized on Draco's apology.  It only served to make him find his anger once again.  'Do you honestly believe that that will solve everything?  That sorry will take it all back, make everything all right?'
He could do this, he could watch in silence as McGonagall told his fellow students that Draco would be joining them, that he would be spending his days, evenings and nights with them, in this tower, in the den of the lions.
All that was required of him was to pick himself up off the stinking floor and walk towards that smile, a taint of something more.
Nothing seemed to warm him up then, nothing at all.  His soft, thin limbs trembling despite the layers of blankets, the blazing hearth.
Draco was worth it.
'But I wouldn't take it back for anything.'  Draco sighed, his body sagging against the one who held him.
'You once told me something.'  Draco lifted his head, and in the gloom of their sudden hiding place he saw emerald eyes shining, tears leaving well worn tracks down Harry's cheeks.  'You told me that you didn't have a family of your own, that you didn't feel like you fitted in anywhere.'
The lies he wove, the fallacies, the tall tales.  Each one quick, each one more elaborate that the last.
Draco knew that there would be nothing he couldn't do with the touch of that hand.
'No.  You eating that soup before it gets too cold matters too.'  Harry looked pointedly at the bowl in Draco's lap, still untouched.
Friends, he would always tell himself.  Close friends, good friends.
'There are no Death Eaters anymore.'
'She was right, I would have been furious.'  Harry told him, wordlessly sending thanks to the foresight of Madam Pomfrey.  It would have been more than he could stand to be away from the sick boy beside him.  'And no, in answer to your question.  I don't mind.'
Until Draco.
Draco Malfoy.
And another.  And another.  Each scar so faded, each one hard to find.  But Harry did.  He found each and every one that he had forced upon Draco's body that afternoon.
'Let me try and help, Draco.'  Harry held his hand, his fingers tightening as he stared down at the ragged wound sliced across Draco's palm.  'I know it's loud and I know you can't close your eyes.  How can you?'  His eyes stung, he swallowed away a sob.  'I know you can't sleep, and when you do it's too horrible.'  He stepped closer, pressing his free hand to Draco's bare chest, across a scar of his own making.  'Everyone is cruel.  I'm cruel.'
'Nothing.'  Draco choked, his fingers rigid on the window ledge, his knuckles white with strain.  Harry had to go, he couldn't see him like this, not anymore.  It was too much to bear.
'Now that is not strictly true, is it?'  The ever astute Professor tilted her head, fixing Harry with her best gaze.  'When was the last time you had a proper nights sleep, Harry?  I want you to be honest with me.'
'Don't get me wrong, Malfoy.  I completely understand that our Dark Lord was nothing more than a madman, Hell bent on taking what he believed was his alone.  But, he stood for us all, he was one of us, Malfoy.  And you did what you did to save your own skin.  Well, it's not got you very far, has it.'  Nott raked his glittering eyes up and down Malfoy's body.  'A traitor, a whore.  How are things going with Slughorn by the way?  Has he bent you over his desk and fucked you till you screamed?'
'This is the second time you have come to get me with bad news.'  Harry said, his voice flat, unable to meet McGonagall's concerned gaze.  They walked down the empty corridors with a single direction in mind  'He's dead, isn't he.'
The boy had to endure.  Had to be cast aside, the one they had so easily forgotten, ignored, taunted.  Accused.
'It's not enough.'  Harry shook his head.  'I want to make things right, but I don't know where to start.'
'You can't move, can you?'  Sadness now.  A sadness that Draco put there.
'I need to be able to do this.  I have to do things alone.  You...you cannnot always be there.'
'It's my fault.'  Draco pulled free from Harry's careful hold, eyes burning as he summoned his courage, facing Ron's rage head on.  'No one knew, don't blame anyone but me.'
'It's rather irresponsible of McGonagall, Harry.'  Hermione spoke up.  'She should be aware of your welfare.'
'I tell you what, lad, you look like you could do with a hug.'  Hagrid spoke, something in his heart twisting painfully at the sight of this child who had nowhere to turn.  'Would that be all right, do you think?'
'Then I will urge you to be quiet.'  The headmistress ordered brusquely, feeling for herself the magic radiating dangerously off Potter.  The boy was a live wire, his hands clenched into tight fists.  'What we are doing for Draco is going to help him.  It may not look like that is the case, but it is all we can do.'  She lamented softly, accepting the role of bad guy.  'Harry, his body cannot take the spells, not without causing him pain and immense distress.'
'How is this even allowed?'  Harry flipped the card over, reading the words printed on the back.  'Don't they have to ask for permission?'  Never in a million years would Harry believe that one day he would be the subject of a collector card.  And that he had been the one who had given it to Draco.
'No, you're not.'  Harry interrupted, his voice harder than he intended.
Would they be horrified?  Would they walk past him if they saw him on a street, not able to recognise their own son?
He kept his peace, he gave no opinion, he returned with them.
And something else, something more, something that brought a gasp from the empty air surrounding him, the suffocating press of figures in the darkness.  A mewling, pathetic creature on the ground.  Curled up and weeping.  The thing on the stones had once been human, Draco could see that.  Somehow oddly familiar.
'Draco!'  Harry's startled exclamation broke through the thick fog in his head.  His voice tinny, coming from some dark, distant place.  'What are you doing?'  He couldn't answer.  His lips parted but no sound would come.  To speak meant to fall.  Only tears.  Only ever tears.  'What's the matter?'  Fear soon replaced that hidden note of anger in Harry's voice.  Draco could hear Harry coming closer, could hear his hesitant footsteps.
'I care about each and every one of my pupils, Draco.  There are no exceptions.'
Voldemort.  His face contorted, his hands twisted.  That cruel face with cruel eyes.  He had been the one, the one to cause all those memories here.  And everywhere.  Nightmares of blood and screaming.  Endless death and mindless destruction.  Violent madness.
The Fat Lady let him in without a word.  Even she had decided early on that the selfish boy from Slytherin had no place here.  What did it matter that he shook?  That his head was down, that his eyes were red and puffy?  Whatever had happened this night he had brought upon himself.  Horrible child.
He had even been warming Severus Snape's bed, the nasty little catamite.
Harry drew him in, pressing his forhead against Draco's, his body so very close.  It didn't matter that Draco was naked, it didn't matter that they hated each other, that the only words they had ever uttered to each other before yesterday were filled with hostility.  All that mattered was Draco, his desperation, his pain, his tears.  The way he had reached out, asking for him.
'Course.' He handed the leather book to the slight child, who immediately pulled it to his chest.  It was heavy, and he doubted the journey to McGonagall's office would be made any easier with the added weight.  Hell, the boy didn't look in any fit state to stand, let alone walk much further.
'I will never be able to thank you enough for all that you have done for me.  You and Professor McGonagall have both gone out of your way to look after me.  More than I ever deserved, and I shall always be eternally grateful.'  He gave her hands a weak squeeze.
'Have you even thought to ask him where he wants to go?'  Harry had to force his voice to stay even, calm.  'What do you want to do, Draco?  Be honest.'  His eyes turned from the head of Slytherin House and stayed on Draco.  Warmth and understanding alive in his features.
'Draco?  Draco, can you hear me?'  She was on the bed, roughly shaking his shoulders.  It would hurt his healing body, treating him this poorly.  But the pain would wake him.  It was all she had left.
'Your recovery is thanks enough, my boy.'  Anything else she was about to say was stolen when the slight knock at the door made them both start.  'I guess that will be Professor McGonagall coming to escort you to your new room.'  Standing, she opened the door to the headmistress.
'It wouldn't do to have someone stumble across it, Argus.'  The dirt encrusted Herbology professor had been saying to the perpetually grumpy caretaker.
'But...'  Hermione twisted her hands together, unable to meet the cool stare of the woman before her.  She wanted to be of some use, to be allowed to do something, anything to assuage the guilt coursing through her.  'I...  I could get Madam P...'
'Tell me you deserve this.'  A thick hiss in his ear.  'Tell me that you like what I do to you, that you want more.'
So many nightmares, so much death.  So like the War.
'Harry?'  Draco couldn't stop his mirrored tears.
Draco could go no further.
It tried to speak, but time and puterfication had rendered the corpse mute.  But still he reached for his only child, reached for a smile that compounded the true horror of Draco's worst fears.
The thought of Draco in Hagrid's home made him feel sick.  The memory clear in his mind of that scared boy lying amongst piles of covers, that mountainous bed.  Crying, in pain, and so very alone.
'I...I love you, Harry.'  He finally admitted to the sleeping boy.  'I'll always love you.'
Late afternoon sunlight flooded through the two big windows that dominated the room, his view over the lake and beyond.
'Try not to talk.'  The voice said, a gentle hand touching his hair.  'Hagrid has gone for help.'
But this, this wouldn't be breaking his promise.
'He gave my Father a knife.  He...He told him to kill Mother.  Said that he could take me home, that it would all be over.  Promised.  She told him to, said to kill her, to cut her with the knife.  To make it stop.  I...I thought he was going to.  He held it out, ready to do it.'  Draco gulped, on the verge of vomiting.  'He threw the knife away.  It was over.  And then...then He made them watch as he...as he hurt me.  Chanting, cutting me with that knife, had...had sex with me.  Made them watch.  My Mother, my Father.  They saw me like that.'  Draco finally broke down.
'Draco understands.'
The beckoning darkness was his world, the hooked fingers curling towards him, dragging him back, urging him in.
'Y...yes.'
Harry was down there.  With the students, the teachers.  With his friends.  Hermione was touching his arm, leaving her hand against his coat.  Ron's head thrown back, laughing into the morning light at some joke, some amusement that Draco would never be party too.
'He is still strong, Hermione.'  Something in the tone of Neville's voice made her head turn back around, made her look Neville in the eye.
'You shouldn't do that.'  Draco whispered, his voice soft, so close to his ear.  'It's not nice.'  It pained him to say it, wanting more of Harry's gentle caress, needing it to last forever.  But he had to be the one to put a stop to this, had to stop Harry running his fingers over those terrible marks that must surely feel so nasty, so alien to him. It wasn't fair, it wasn't done.
'You don't have to do anything.'  Harry told him softly, easing him back down to the bed.  He took his place beside him, didn't even consider giving up his sure hold on Draco's waist.  'You are not ready.  Pomfrey said only to try if you can.'
'You scared me.'  Draco whispered, those beautiful eyes inches from his face, Harry couldn't help but stare into them.
'I never knew.'
Heads hung.  Some in shame, some in silent contemplation.  And some in unrelenting denial.
'It's all right.'  Draco forced a smile, 'I promise, it's all right.'  He stroked Harry's tentative smile, blushing when Harry kissed his fingers.  'You don't need to worry over me.'
'Don't say that.  We...  We can make it work.'
'Professor McGonagall.'  His tremulous voice called out into the silence, the sound echoing throughout the Great Hall.  And Greg resolutely had to ignore all the faces as they turned in his direction, as he grasped tight to Milly's hand.  He had to do this, he had to help end Draco's torment.  'I have your answers.'
No.  Not dreams.  Never dreams.  Nightmares.
'Yes, t...thank you.'  He continued to struggle to find his voice in front of the huge man before him.  So much shame.
His feet shuffling across the tiny floor of his room.
He couldn't hold on.  The shouts and the screams fading as he closed his eyes, as he couldn't stop himself sinking into the wide nothingness that waited patiently for him.
'It will still be here when you are ready.'  Her voice brought him out of the encroaching shadows.
Together.
'How dare you.'  Harry repeated, a chill to his words that few had heard before.  He ignored the way Nott wrapped his own fingers around his choking hold, desperately searching for purchase, his scrabble already weakening, flickering stars beginning to cloud his wavering vision.
'Is that what you think?'  Harry was shocked, struggling to find his voice.  Rage boiling inside of him.  How could Draco think this?  How could he believe that he truly was so terrible?
'We shall come back in the morning,'  Pomfrey told him.  'When we know what we are dealing with.'  She gently took McGonagall's arm.  'Come, Minerva, I think we could both do with a stiff drink while we go over Dumbledore's book.'  She led the shell-shocked headmistress from the room.  'Look after him, Harry.'  Turning in the doorway, Madam Pomfrey smiled sadly, her voice soft, barely heard over the heartbreaking sound of Draco sobbing.  'He is going to need you.'
Draco didn't even want to ask how.  What did it matter?  His time was up, his sanctuary discovered.  He wasn't ready, he would never be ready.
'When I was little I caught a cold.'  Harry continued with his story. 'Couldn't get warm, couldn't stop sneezing.  My aunt, in a rare moment of compassion threw it into my cupboard for me.'
Harry, please...  No.  He could do this.  Blinking in the severe light Madam Pomfrey needed to see by, blinking away that ever present need for the Boy Who Lived.
'I don't want to be anywhere else.'  A flush stealing over his cheeks, a shy smile to match Draco's.
'Is that what you truly wish?'
'I don't understand it.'  Madam Pomfrey shook her head.  'The two of them, in there, together.'  She gestured to the closed door.  'They are always knocking the stuffing out of each other, throwing hexes and insults, not sharing a bed, not causing the walls to tremble if they are parted.'  She paused to shake her head once more, her own actions confounding her.  'I have never in all my years put two students in a bed together, it's unthinkable.'
Dark magic, McGonagall had told Draco.  Told them both.  Evil, twisted spells that bound the blond boy to the Dark Lord.
He was so very careful with his body.  Understanding of Draco's needs and fears.
'The others are too bright.'  Draco spoke, but Harry did not hear.
'Harry, it's okay.'  A thought suddenly occurred to him.  'Is that why you stay with me now?'  He asked carefully.  'Do you feel guilty about what happened?  Because you don't need to, you know.  I...I can do this alone.  I forgive you.  I was never angry.'  He twitched in Harry's arms, wanting, wishing to turn around and face the only person he could stand touching him.
Harry knew he had shattered that trust the second he drew his wand against someone he called friend.  Would Draco believe he could do it to him too?  If they argued?  If they didn't agree?  The thought of causing Draco that pain would be his end.
'Ah, but Harry and Draco are not your typical students, are they.'  McGonagall smiled.
The door opening made Draco start.  Rationally he realised that he was safe, but his mind supplied darkness, hooded figures in silver masks that were ready to curse him into the Hell he was accustomed to.
Perhaps he would tell him of Nott and his words.  Perhaps.
'To the point that he could seriously endanger his own recovery.  Draco has made it known to me that he cannot contemplate holding a wand, let alone attempt magic.'
Chest heaving, panicking.  Draco clutched at Harry's hand, weak fingers flexing uselessly.  'I...I didn't want that.'
Tonight.  He would have taken it out, taken it to his bath...
The way the dying boy took each shivery, shallow breath, the split skin on his wasted back bared to the chill in the hallway, to the crowds that couldn't find the strength in themselves to walk away.
'No.  You don't have to.  There are other ways of doing this, Draco.  Without magic.'
'I'm not leaving you.'  Harry told him, breaking from the book.  'You can shut your eyes.'
Hagrid was right, Malfoy was close to death.  Far too close.  His grey eyes flickered and twitched under almost scarlet eyelids.  Trapped in his own personal Hell.  Harry felt helpless, there was no way to offer comfort to the broken boy, no place to touch him where it wouldn't cause him untold pain.
It blossomed, broke and crawled down towards his wrist, deep red slicking a path across his black inked skin.
'You are going to be okay.' Harry choked back a sob, tears streaming down his face for the boy who was his sworn enemy.
'Draco.  Come on, Draco.  Don't leave me now, I've only just found you.'
'Hermione, that was three days ago.  I didn't see the point.'  Harry shrugged, confused by her obvious concern.
'Do you want water?'  The kind voice asked, so close.
His mind was a swirling tangle of disjointed memories and lucid nightmares, each one slipping through his grasp, catching on the chill that whipped around him, dragging all of them further and further away.
'He overheard her talking to McGonagall. Whispering, apparently.'  Seamus' eyes lighting up, ready to impart his vital piece of golden gossip.  'Turns out our favourite missing Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts.'
Just like they had done to Draco.
Draco Malfoy was many things.  He was a nuisance, a tease, he had a vicious, cutting tongue.  He was clever, scathing, amusing and fiercely loyal with his friends.  He was independent, spoilt, angry.
Harry had found him in the dark.  He was leaning close, his breath warm against his freezing skin.  It felt shockingly real.  A trick of the dark, a figment of his cracked imagination.  Arms wrapped themselves around him.  Elusive warmth bled into his broken bones, healed them.  It didn't hurt so much.
'It doesn't matter, Draco.  Just forget about it.'
So many students, standing and staring at what was before them once again.
'He sent everyone out.'  Draco leaned heavily against Harry, drawing strength from his close proximity.  'I was still chained up. I...I think I'd been...  Touched.  He liked them to get me ready for him.'  Swallowing hard, Draco forced down the bile in his throat.  He could do this, he had to do this.  'I remember crying.  He was laughing, telling me that it was my fault.  That I had done wrong, that I deserved all the punishment.'
'No.'  Draco whispered, tearing his eyes away.  'I had a wand, once.  This is n...not mine.'  His flooding eyes met hers.  Why couldn't she understand?  His own wand was gone, broken.  Snapped cleanly in half, tossed aside like it meant nothing.
He didn't notice Milly at his side, didn't realise that she had taken his hand and was beginning to talk to him, leaning heavily against him.  Her voice gentle and kind, and more than he would ever hope for again.
Two lonely boys, finally saying farewell.
Draco's hand was curled in, cramp locking it tightly where he held it hard against his heaving chest, where he struggled for each shallow breath, fighting against whatever hid behind his flickering eyes.  Blood, wet and bright and shining.  It seeped between his fingers, dripping thickly down over his wrist and trickling to his lap where it was quickly swallowed in the dark of his robes.
Encouraging.
'And you believe you can make this work?  You honestly think that you and Harry can carry on as if nothing has passed between you?  Keeping your friendship secret?'
It forced it's unbidden way through, there in the bedroom that was not his own.  Garish colours that would never be his, a bed that stood apart, stripped bare.  Starkly white and cold, a place he had once slept.  So long ago.
'Shit, Draco.  I'm so fucking sorry.'  Harry grasped him, pulled him close.  The cloak thrown to the floor where it lay in the dust, forgotten for the moment in the face of Draco's distress.  'I didn't think about what I was doing to you.'  Harry told him, his hand clamped on the back of Draco's neck, pressing him to his chest.  Draco's hands cluching his jumper, wanting to feel the warm skin beneath the thick wool.  He couldn't get close enough.
And it was the ever present fear that he would once again turn a corner and bump into Harry Potter.
And all because of him.  Because Draco had been dying, because so many had been hurt.  Because he had been too weak to kill the Man, the Monster earlier.  Too afraid to go it alone when he had the chance.  He had to drag them along, he should have had the courage to protest louder, longer.  It had been his duty, his birthright.
Find a nice little place not far from here.  Somewhere he would still be able to see Hogwarts outside of a window.  The Headmistress would not grudge him staying within the grounds if he so desired.
Draco slid to the floor in an ache of tired limbs and tear stained eyes, his borrowed trousers already picking up the forgotten dust on the floor.  The Draco of old would never have been that inattentive.
'Of course.'  Harry's shy smile lit his face.  'I'd like that.'  His hands found the small of Draco's back, pulling him ever closer.  'You feel cold.'  Harry told him.  'I don't like it when you are cold, it worries me.  Can...can I stay with you?'
'So, then.  Draco and Harry.'
'You wanted to cut it out.'
The Boggart couldn't fix on any one form.
'I'm sure it was an accident, Ron.'  She placated him, 'Harry didn't mean the things he said, and Malfoy, well, he's not been the same since he came back.'  She added thoughfully, giving the silent blond some much needed consideration.
'H...Harry?'  His broken mind supplied.  It wasn't possible.  He had watched Harry open the wooden door, stepping out into the afternoon sunlight.  'You...you left.'
Draco reached for the name that drifted on the air, the cry already dying in his arid throat.  Harry.  His Harry.
'You okay?'  Harry spoke now, rubbing his back, kissing his hair.  'I'm sorry, I should never have kept us on the floor for so long.'
'I am his headmistress.  I am now his only guardian.  I want to give Draco everything he needs.  I cannot change his past, but I can help give him a future.'  McGonagall took a deep breath, it would not do to get upset.  Now was the time for action, not more tears.
'Come along, Draco.'  McGonagalls words finally broke through the relentless pounding in his skull.  The way she turned to Draco, the way she put her hand carefully on his scar covered back, it all made Harry want to scream.  It should have been him doing that.  It should have been him leading Draco to his new bed, the one placed near his own.
'But you do.  And you always have.'  Draco smiled softly, his fists bunching in Harry's jumper.  'You belong with the Weasley's, Harry.  They are the family you need, and they are the family you love.'
Check the Map, just to be sure, perhaps his fathers cloak.  Pull back his curtains a fraction, slip out.  Make sure they fell neatly back into place.
Harry had spent his tears, sobbed while Draco offered comfort, whispering words that reversed their roles.  Draco wasn't angry, how could he be?  Harry was sad, hurt and tired and heartsick.  He knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that Harry was the one getting him better.  All the magic, all the potions in the world were nothing compared to the boy sleeping beside him.
Surprise lit across Hermione's features as the shape of her boyfriend appeared in the gloom.  She had left him hours ago, contented to play chess with Harry in the common room.  Kissing his cheek, pleased that he seemed truly happy, for once.  But now, now he looked so upset that she felt her chest tighten at the sight.  Tears flooding down his reddened cheeks.
Sweat soaked and sobbing, Draco had vomited down his front, the little soup he had managed to swallow over the last few days spilling down the pale yellow fabric of his top.  And, Harry realised with a hopeless lurch, he had lost control of his bladder.  The sheets beneath his body wet, his pyjamas sodden.
'It's...It's Harry.'  Ron stuttered, coming to stand before her desk.  'He's...he's ruined everything.'
Oliver Twist.
He leaned further out, knowing that it would be almost impossible to see him this high up in the castle walls.
Turning the tap on, he trailed his fingers under the flow, the water slowly waking to hot.  Steam rose up around the mirror hanging over the sink, obscuring his view of himself.  The face of a stranger disappearing under the onslaught of heat.
'It helps him sleep.'   A small smile flittered across Harry's face, not quite reaching his eyes.  'We finished Oliver Twist the other night.  He liked it.  We are half way through The Three Musketeers now.  He...he wanted me to read Dracula to him, but I wouldn't.  Another monster in the dark.  It might make things worse.'  A soft sigh, a blink of wet eyes.  'If that's even possible.'
'I need to borrow Potter for a while.'  Professor McGonagall's head appeared around the door to Harry's History of Magic classroom.  'Quidditch business.'  Her tone matter of fact, brokering no argument.
To see him standing there before them all, a lone Slytherin in a sea of angry Gryffindors tried all of Harry's resolve.
'I...I want to try, Harry.  Please.'  Draco lifted his head, looking to the innocuous little door.  'Just...  Promise you'll stay with me?'
He was dropped from the arms.  Falling hard onto the chilled earth.  The man stood over him, looking down at what he had become.  Draco expected more pain, he tried to curl up, anticipating it, but nothing.  The man in black just walked away.
'I know you are good at Chess, Ron, but even you can't play alone.'  And leaning his weight against a chair, he forced a smile from lips that still burned.
'As opposed to a murderer.'  He replied.
Why did it have to be this way?  Draco's name, no, not even that.  Malfoy, they used Mafoy.  That name being spread around the Great Hall.  Soon there wouldn't be a person under the castle roof that remained unaware that Draco was indeed back.
Draco watched in silence as Professor McGonagall closed the door softly behind her.
And forget.
Nothing mattered, the damned school, the house cup, the latest Quidditch match.
Her hand hesitated, just inches from touching Harry.
And the third time Harry had shared a bed?
The window might as well be a million miles away.
'He won't see you.'  It pained him, but Harry had no choice.  He wrenched his hand from Draco's clinging grip.  'You have to trust me, Draco.  I won't let anything happen to you, I swear it. Trust me.  You'll be safe here.'   Harry was already turning away, leaving him to sit alone.  Ready to meet Filch head on.
It wasn't true.  It couldn't possible be true.
He was carried for hours by a man who didn't speak.  He knew from the feel of him that he was one of those who had liked to hurt him.  This man liked it nasty, dirty and violent.  He couldn't even struggle, his body too weak to fight.  All he could do was wait to see what fresh horror this man had conjured up for him.
'We could try again tomorrow.'  She said kindly.  'Let you get some rest.'
The only thing on the desk before her, a single cardboard box.
'You are killing him!'  Harry couldn't stand it a moment longer.  The sight of the painfully writhing boy was too terrible to witness.
And then it happened.
Draco's bag had split.
'And where does Harry fit into all of this?  Is he aware of Draco's plans?'
'No, you do not.'  The Professor shifted uncomfortably, all too clearly recalling that terrible conversation with Professor McGonagall several days ago.  'But I still don't understand your reluctance for Draco to return to his House.  He is a Slytherin.'
'Perhaps it's not that simple, Ron.  We don't know anything about it, only what we saw.'
Called him slut, called him whore.
'Don't say that.'  There was hot anger in Harry's voice.  A fury that couldn't be contained.  'Don't ever say that.'
How could he have been so thoughtless, so callous, so very cruel?  He was no better than all those who hadn't given a damn.  No better than the ones who left Draco for dead.  How could he face that almost silent weeping after what he had done?
'Okay, yes.  Water.'  Finally he could be of some use.  There was a mug by his own bed, he could use that.  Neville drew his wand, the spell already on his lips.  He was startled by Harry's panicked, raised voice.
When they had gone it had almost broken his fragile heart.  Replacing them with such copies had softened that ache, not taken it away, not entirely, but it had helped.  And those books were truly beautiful, so beautiful that it was only right that Draco now owned his most favourite.  And it was right that this book could also bring comfort to another lost, lonely boy.
'You.'  Draco took a breath, spoke the impossible.  'I want you too.'
'Don't be ashamed, Draco.'
As he had been, as he had always felt.
And he knew.  He knew that had he been able to find something so very pretty in that place, he would not have stayed his hand.
The screaming had started again, he knew it would never stop.
Cut it all away.
Her blunt question shocked him into silence.
Harry suffering in a different way.  But he still suffered.  Draco could feel it in Harry's close body.  An ever present tremble that had been there from that first night.  A sign that he did care, that he was never going to leave him, however hard Draco pushed at him.
'That's enough.'  There was anger in Harry's voice.
Surely Malfoy had died?   How could a child survive with such terrible injuries?  His poor, broken body lying in his bed, never to throw an insult, never to move, never to breath again. He would burn the place to the ground.  Hagrid decided, sudden tears clouding his vision.  How could he ever live in such a place again?
'You are my home.'  Harry whispered back.  'Only ever you.'
'You...you killed Him, didn't...didn't you.'  Draco swallowed heavily, needing to get the words out, even if it felt like swallowing glass.  'Voldemort.'
He wouldn't attempt it, not tonight.  The memories were too close, the thoughts of Harry too painful.
Harry walked beside Hagrid and his unbearably light burden.  Draco was well covered, his naked pain concealed beneath numerous covers.  Should anyone stumble across the pair, they would be forgiven for thinking that Hagrid only carried rags.
Draco had known.  But had done what was asked of him anyway.
'Everything?'  Harry had to ask.  Please, please let there be some gaps.
A child.
The gaping hole in the castle wall, the afternoon breeze swirling through the open hallway and shivering through his body.  The broken windows and the shattered stones, the shock and fear on all of the faces that surrounded him.
'How can you bring yourself to say his name?'  Slughorn asked quietly, wincing when Draco voiced the loathsome name.  'When so many still cannot?'
'Madam Pomfrey did hurt me.  I should have been honest with you earlier.'  Draco spoke, his gaze on the sky, if he was to look into those eyes his resolve would crumble.  He heard Harry's sucked in breath, ready to vent his anger.  'She didn't mean to, and I didn't tell her to stop.'
'No.  Please.  No.'  His head rocking back and forth against the pillows, cold sweat breaking out over his pale skin, his hands clenching into helpless fists.  'Hurt me...I...I want you to...  Please, make...make it stop.'  His words a jumbled mess, darkness behind his eyelids.  The Cell in his head, breaking into his dreams.  'I...I can't.  Don't.'
The place where the voices hid.
'Of couse not.'  Slughorn shook his head.  'At least not until he is well enough to be released from Madam Pomfrey's more than capable care.'
Yet another thing that made his insides squirm with distaste.
Harry was only vaguely aware of the exchanges flying back and forth over the table.  More inane gossip  Likely it would be who was caught snogging who on the Astronomy Tower, or what couple had split up now.  He didn't even try and appear interested.   His gaze on the far wall, the fork in his hand idly playing with the remains of his dinner.
'It's going to hurt.'  She warned.  'You have already been through so much. You don't have to suffer anymore.'
Potter didn't give a shit about Malfoy.  Hell, it was well known that the Saviour had almost killed the Slytherin before the War.
Harry knew his anger was directed at the wrong person, but it didn't take away from the fact that Draco was terrified by the questions, broken and back in the darkness.  Draco was his priority right now.  The feelings of anyone else didn't matter.  'Please, just go.  I need to take care of him.'
'Yes.  I can understand that.'  She nodded, a smile twitching her lips.  'Come along now, Poppy will be staying with him.'
'Open your eyes, Draco.  You don't need to be scared.  I'm not going anywhere without you.'  Harry's voice so very close, his breath warm against his skin.  'You need to look.'
That woman had brought him some, he remembered that.  Her with the tangled hair and the blinding mask.  He had known her, had once called her aunt.  She had held a bowl to his parched lips, tipped it over his chin as he had gulped it down, knowing it would be his last for some time.
'Hmmm,'  Harry murmured, his eyes flicking around the increasingly rowdy room, looking for rescue.  'It wasn't so bad.'  Finding none, he decided to keep his reply as vague as possible.  'We...we didn't really see each other all that much.'
They had witnessed the heartbreaking moments Draco dreamed about, they had seen all the nightmares of his truth, and one of them, among the staring crowds, had brought the memories to his door.  To her door.
And all Draco had offered in return was a weak, watery smile whenever their paths had happened to cross.
'You don't need a stalker, Harry.  You need someone to knock some sense into you, because it's obvious that I'm right.'
The Cell, that was real, that was all he knew.  This, this was the dream.  The candles and the bedcovers and those emerald eyes.  A dream that he could no longer hold onto.
His Harry.
It was all he could do to stop himself tearing away from her.
'It is where Draco belongs.'  Professor Slughorn interrupted.
Protection from what only turned out to be a small group of laughing first years, their uniforms crisp, brand new shoes clacking as they made their late way to the Great Hall.  It wasn't Nott and his accusations, it wasn't the shadows that stalked his dreams.  It was perfectly normal, happy students.  But still Draco clutched to the hands that were wrapped around his.
'Because it is a part of something important, something that was only mine.  A good memory.  I want it to be yours.'  He closed Harry's hand around the tiny glass angel.  'Please.'
He had a house, he had money, he had friends.  So what else could he possibly need in his life?  He should be happy.  He had no reason not to be.
And suddenly there was nothing.
'Malfoy...'
'That sick fucker tortured him, killed his parents in front of him!'  He all but screamed, unconsciously holding Draco tighter.  'And you made him relive it!'
'I wish you didn't struggle to believe me, Draco.'  This time it was Harry who rested his head against Draco's shoulder, exhausted beyond measure.  'I wouldn't say anything I didn't mean.  You know that about me, at least.  I get that this is strange, new and scary.  But I am your friend.  Please believe that.  You have to believe that.'  His voice was little more than a tired sigh, the fight draining from him.
Harry washed Draco's body with all the care and attention the exhausted boy deserved.  Cleaned up the evidence of his nightmare, dressed him in his own pyjamas.  They hung softly around his thin frame.  A comforting warmth that smelled like the Boy Who Lived.  Draco never wanted to feel the touch of his own clothes again.
'Harry?'
His own father.
He couldn't see the trunk, but he was all too aware that it sat there, waiting.  Stained oak, expensive fittings, silver handles, green trim.  Menacing and dark and full of his former life.  There were clothes, robes and such like in amongst the packed items.  Books, parchment, spare quills.  The usual things a school boy needed in his daily life.  And letters.  Photographs, memories.  He couldn't think about it, not now, not tonight.  McGonagall was right, it could wait.
He had listened to his Mother's dying scream.
Neville's heart ached at Harry's words, as he searched for something to say.  'They are your friends, Harry, you know that they wouldn't tell a soul.'
'I can't...'  He shook his head, his dirty face turning to her.  'What if I'm not strong enough?'
'Too ashamed of me, is that it?  Caught snogging a Death Eater in the precious Gryffindor common room.  Whatever next.'  His voice was bitter, stinging with anger and resentment.  The Boy Who Lived has really lost his mind now.  I should have let Voldemort kill me once and for all, it would have been easier for everyone, for them, to grieve over their marvelous hero.'
But no, once again in the arms of a body, held despite the agony, the screaming inside his head.  Only this time it felt different.  It wasn't cruel, it didn't hurt quite so much. It was a different pair of hands, a different smell.  There was a voice this time too.  A kind, gruff voice, one full of gentleness.  One that promised him warmth, help, salvation.
He really had gone this time.
He should have taken his hand there and then, not closed his eyes and listened as Draco's soft footfall faded along the flagstones.  Taken his hand, led him back to the common room.  Gathered together his things, and left.  Just simply walked away from all he loved and from all he knew.
'But...  Gryffindor?'
'Sorry I'm so late.  Everyone was staying up tonight.  It's Saturday tomorrow, so it was hard to slip away.'  Harry didn't fail to notice the red of Draco's eyes.  There was a smell in the air.  Madam Pomfrey and her limitless potions, no doubt.  It wasn't a surprise that Draco had been crying.
It didn't seem to matter now.
He needed to get him into bed, needed to wash him, dry him.  Get him all the water he could ever want.  Needed to help him sleep and chase away all the bad dreams.  Read, or just lay quietly with him, touch him.  Anything.
But others had different plans for him, uses.  His body taken from him, taken and used and thrown aside without care.  Others knew him, as he had not known himself.
'It's all right.'  The woman soothed.  'Can you swallow?'  She asked, urging him back against a pile of pillows.  'I'll get you some water.'  She left him, her footsteps moving away.  He had to see, he had to open his eyes.
'I...I can't.'
'You didn't know.'  Draco soothed.  'There is nothing to forgive.'  He allowed his hands to fall to Harry's arms, holding them there.
If he had known, if he had only realised that the kisses they shared by the fire a lifetime ago were to be the first, and the very last, Draco knew he would have held Harry tighter, kissed him longer.
It was truly terrible.  A mess of open wounds, crisscrossing over ones that had clearly tried to heal themselves.  It was a wonder that Draco had managed to survive.  The infection was virulent, black blood drying across his back and shoulders.  The lash marks had bitten deeply, cutting into his young skin with such force.  A heavy hand had been behind the whip.  Frequently.
'He made it through the night.'  McGonagall continued.  'He will recover.'
He slipped the thin piece of card out from under his stack of pillows, careful with it, lest it should crease or be damaged by his shivering fingertips.
It had been night, sleeping bodies filled his rooms, his house.  Safe in the knowledge that he was the only one awake, he let himself into that Cell.  Let himself take enjoyment from the frail boy on the dirt stained floor.
'Can you get up?'  Harry asked him softly.  'Did he hurt you?'  He held out his hand.  'Come on, I'll help you.'  Despite all of Draco's intentions, he couldn't refuse that hand.
'It is a wand.'  She spoke after an age had passed, her voice solemn, her own hands as still as stone on the desk.
Her body locked with fear, her blood chilled as it forced its way around her veins.  Drumming loudly in her aching heart.  She couldn't move.
He felt Draco immediately stiffen, felt the panic rising.
'No, no, I'm fine.'  He shook his head, tucking his arm under the blankets.  It hurt.  Something else he wasn't prepared to burden Harry with.  It wasn't fair on the boy who visited.
'Minerva?'  Madam Pomfrey turned to the Hogwarts headmistress when the door clicked shut.
'Are you back with Ginny?'  Neville crossed his legs.  'Because I know she was with Dean tonight.  And you are out there,' he waved his hand around.  'Flying like a man possessed.  Something has gotten you angry, hurt.  Are you jealous of him, because I've never seen you like this before.'
But...  They had seen, they would know the truth.
'You can't lie, I've said it to you before.  You are terrible at it.'  Harry spoke.  'I may not know much about you, Draco, but I do know that.'
Things so terrible, so disgusting that he knew he would never sleep without imagining Draco screams, issuing forth from between those pale lips that used to help him with homework.
'Dark.'  Draco babbled, confused.  'Can't...can't go...  Back.'  His head shook against Harry's shoulder, heavy tears leaking, running over Harry's neck.  'They...They will come for me.'
'You sound like Harry.'  Draco told him, selecting a biscuit from the pile.  He made no move to eat.  'He's...he's been so kind to me.'  Draco spoke quietly, unable to make eye contact with the giant who watched him.  'It's like he understands completely what I need, how I need to be touched.  Even things I don't know myself, he seems too.'  He began to crumble the biscuit between his fingers.  'I had another nightmare last night.  A bad one.  He...he stayed with me.  I...I think I was screaming.  I couldn't breath, he...he was crying.  I frighten him, but I can't make the dreams stop.'
“Hardly fair, ain’t it?”
Nick shrugged as he got to his feet, looking over at where Harry and Draco stood. “Why don’t you ask him then?”
“You could start by telling Kreacher you’ll do your own cleaning,” she said as she handed the crisply-pressed robes back to him.
Walking back to her seat, she kept her gaze trained on Harry. “Usually my first question in this scenario would be: what is Draco Malfoy doing in my department? However, somehow I had another more pressing question today: how long has he been shagging my best friend and
Astoria laughed, shaking her head slowly as she looked between the two men. “I’m not entirely sure I’d call them unimaginable anymore.”
“I’ll be in France most of the weekends anyway, you know.”
“It’s fine, really.” It was a lie—he was still in agonising pain—but Harry really didn’t want to leave the house. “It’s pretty much gone now.”
Astoria scoffed. “Glad to know someone finds it endearing. Imagine how much he could complain about you in a day, and then multiply that by most days of the year for the entirety of our marriage.”
Closing his eyes and setting his head back against the chair with perhaps slightly more force than usual, Harry sighed. “Maybe, but I’m working on it.”
“Dad,” Albus whined, really drawing out the syllable. “Scorp said that his dad told him everything. How come you didn’t tell us? Some kids didn’t know, but some did, and it was embarrassing.”
“Why not?” Did Draco really not want anything to do with him? Harry felt the air escape his lungs, like the weight of the world was crushing him. Could he not even manage being civil for the sake of public appearances?
“What if for once in our lives, we stopped thinking about what would happen later and just enjoyed ourselves?”
“Something about seeing the way you look at her…it’s almost the way you look at Ron sometimes.”
“I’m not entirely sure I follow,” Harry admitted slowly. “Why?”
I couldn’t have left you to burn. Those flames…” Turning his head to look at the door again, Harry shuddered as he pressed his eyes closed. “And you saved me at the Manor, anyway.”
“—excuse me, that’s not very—”
The red bird had barely moved from atop Malfoy’s hair at this point and Harry wondered if she ever would. Perhaps she would nest there. This set about a new bout of laughter that continued as Malfoy paid for both the bird and an eagle owl, glaring at Harry for majority of the transaction. He had to claim plausible deniability when Malfoy asked him what was so funny, knowing he’d be murdered on the spot if he admitted how hilarious he found the thought of Malfoy’s hair turned into a bird’s nest.
“That,” Malfoy says, fingers snapping, two of them flicking between Adams and himself with a flourish, “is verifiably untrue.”
“Hilarious,” Harry mutters, settling back into the water. “I didn’t plan it. I just… didn’t know where to go.”
Harry draws in another slow breath. “Can we talk?”
Wilson shrugs. “Riled up, but yeah, not a scratch on her.”
surveillance footage.”
“No, really. First time for everything, I supp-” His words stop dead. Poor word choice for the audience. “Anyway, I assume you want the Body Bind off?”
“It takes some getting used to.” Malfoy’s hands drop, followed by his shoulders and Harry’s gut. “I’m taking a nap, Hazza. Just fill that out as you please.”
Harry’s throat clicks as he swallows. He remembers Auror training. Not the policies, but everything else. The duels. The strained muscles. The fogged locker room mirrors. The waiting. The quiet. The touches that always started at his hair.
“Fuck!” Draco exclaims. “Warn a bloke before you snaffle his dick in the bath, won’t you?”
Casting a glance at the edge of the rug, Harry indulges his shoulders in an eager wiggle before he leaves the empty Tupperware on the hearth, kicks his shoes off, removes his socks, and digs his toes into the densely woven rug. Goosebumps run up his legs as his feet press into the silky fibers.
“Ummmm…” Malfoy’s rising hum is conspiratory. “I’m telling Robards,” he sings.
Draco towels himself off like an Olympic swimmer, all brusque efficiency and everything better to do. Harry watches, dripping on the tile floor till Draco glances back and tosses him the towel. Grimmauld Place hadn’t seen fit to provide him one.
“And you’re not going to punch me, right?”
“Twelve Grimmauld Place.”
The article ends in a paltry handwave about reformation efforts and extolls the miserable charity events Harry avoids like the plague. The newspaper section falls back into its folds, as if it’s been read and reread too many times. And maybe it has.
already? After what? Three days?”
Malfoy’s hands slide up the bars and above his head, pale skin tight over his flanks, stretching over ribs as he moves. The Sectumsempra scars are invisible like this, only showing when he’s flushed with exertion or heat or-
Face, you-”
A halo of brown curls obscures the bottom half of the safety glass window in the hall door, and Harry gulps. This could end very poorly, or merely alright, but it won’t end well.
“It’s a bit pervy, you know,” he says, pulling his bottom lip under his teeth and releasing it. “But I think I’m into it.”

Harry’s palms press the velvet tight across his hips, pinning his cock against the slick satin and holding his pelvis tight—a novel feeling. What would it feel like to have Draco on top of him? Riding him? Fuck, coming on top of him?
else’s idea, really.
Hermione merely hums and nods, lips against her cup.
“Funny.”
Draco’s fingers crook, and Harry’s vision whites out under a wave of pleasure that starts in his arse and ricochets to the back of his head, down his thighs, and unfurls more with each stroke. Release builds, hard and urgent, against Draco’s fingertips inside him.
Harry’s gaze flicks up to Draco, who’s leaned over, elbows on his knees, watching Harry eat with an uncomfortable level of scrutiny. Harry licks his lips, and Draco mimics the gesture. “You sure you don’t want some?”
Harry’s hands wander over the velvet to cup his hardening length. Would Draco get himself off in here tonight? Almost certainly. How could he not?
“Hm?” His placid expression can’t hide the flush in his cheeks or his darting eyes.
For once, his eyes don’t meet Harry’s, and for once, Harry wishes they would, because he has no idea what Malfoy means.
The door opens silently, and he braces himself against the gate for a maelstrom of maledictions. The litany of ways he’s failed her, failed her family, failed himself. Diatribes that are meant to kick his arse into motion but only ever sealed his lips and bruised his heart.
“Hey.”
“Did it explode on your arse, too?” Draco leans around Harry’s shoulder.
“Don’t think about them.” Toes line up on opposite sides of his cock, and it’s nearly as good as a hand. “Don’t think about them… all slippery…”
The fourth one is gummy strawberry goodness as the kid in the book leaves his aunt and uncle’s house and flies to school. His parents are dead, and his classmates are awful.
“I’m just filling it in myself.” Harry’s quill scratches across the paper, and the MimeoQuills copy its movement.
Scowling, Harry turns to examine him. Kreacher has only ever addressed him, sarcastically, as
“खूबसूरत । Beautiful,” he says before kissing Draco again fiercely, pushing him back onto the couch until he’s lying on top of him. They pull back again after a few minutes, gasping for air.  “मेरे । Mine,” he says with a smile as they continue kissing, the lesson forgotten.
“Yeah.”
“That’s-” Draco starts, but Harry feels him pause.
Hermione’s eyes roll back in her head. “Oh. My. God,” she clips. “Harry, you’d think you lit Ginny’s hair on fire from the way they’re acting.”
Jenkins shuffles forms into a pile and shoves them into a corner of the desk for Harry to finish later. Generous.
Harry’s smirk levels out into a vindictive grin. Jenkins getting shitcanned along with him is indescribably sweet.
The bronze door is cool under his fingertips, and smooth against his forehead, and a glossy-slick caress across his lips.
“Thought you’d be more keen on seeing him again,” Adams grits out as he waddles backwards. His arms are scooped under someone’s shoulders, and Wilson’s carrying the man’s legs.
“Oh, what the
Just silence, perfect darkness, golden satin, sapphire velvet, the smell of old paper, and a nest of mismatched pillows. The pillows don’t smell like books, though. He turns, nuzzling into the closest one. It doesn’t smell like paper at all. It smells like soft skin and sharp gasps.
His hands find his hair, grabbing hold in what’s usually a calming, tugging movement, but he freezes, realizing he’s under surveillance.
, if you will.”
She nudges the door open on a hip and lets it swing shut behind her, not startled by the loud thud. Her hands each clutch a cup of coffee, and a paper bag is wedged under one arm as she walks with the utmost precision to his desk, eyes on the overfull paper cups.
,” Harry says with a swat of his own, grimacing as he remembers his failed confession of his feelings for Draco on the latter’s birthday. His nerves about whether Draco would like his gift had affected him, leading him to ramble before he finally panicked and blurted out “I like you” in Hindi and ran away, embarrassed, leaving a very confused Draco alone in his kitchen. “I was scared! But I was determined to tell you that day somehow. I didn’t count on accidentally slipping into a language I felt more comfortable using at the time. Also, Hermione did literally shove me back in a while later to sort things out with you. In English.”
The muffin is gone, and Harry busies himself picking the crumbs off the desk with his thumb. “Do you think I can come to Sunday brunch at the Burrow?”
Harry chuffs a laugh against Draco’s neck that turns into a slow, grazing kiss. “Maybe later.”
“So…” he drawls. An awkward silence fills the space as he digs a squashed muffin out of the bag and breaks pieces off to nibble at. “How’s everything at the Burrow?”
“What could you possibly have done to warrant that?!”
Draco glances back over his shoulder.
“Fuck it,” Harry mutters, intention on that open window as he Apparates in.
Harry’s head leans back and thunks against the copper, and he watches Draco’s wand Battleship game over the horizon of his own cheeks.
. You have a boyfriend?”
. The vault is too silent against the noise of his own memories, and his eyes dart around for distraction.
Malfoy’s voice wafts like smoke from his cell across the hall, ringing against the tile. His hand floats above the cot where he lays, eyes closed, gesticulating nonsensically. His fingers weave an almost-pattern as Harry watches.
“Illegal.”
One of the master bedroom windows upstairs slides open, and Kreacher’s ear twitches backward to catch the sound. A light clicks on in the room, but nobody passes by the window.
“Just get out, Harry,” she says. “Just pack a bag and get the
The staircase is entirely redone, smooth, bright wood and sunny walls. It’s strange though, that Ginny has done all this now. She spent years denouncing cooking, cleaning, and decorating, so as not to become her mother. Maybe she
St. Pancras’ is well out of the way between the Ministry and Grimmauld Place, but it’s worth it for the food and the walk around St. Pancras’ Gardens. He’s never bothered to tell Ginny that he comes here at least once a week. It’s not that she wouldn’t appreciate it, but that she would appreciate it to death.
“I thought you’d never ask.”
The vault doors only have a few feet between them, unlike the massive rooms upstairs. Wand in one hand, hand on the box against his hip, he passes by the doors, steps narrowing.
Malfoy’s curled on his side, back to the room, jeans unfastened and hitched low on his hips.
“Certain.”
me,” Draco sings, waving the book. “Or, rather, Griphook was an embezzling bastard, and they credit the Malfoys with his death. But I’ll take what I can get.”
“Three!”
The article blathers on with banal quotes about togetherness and cooperation.
, and they had never gotten around to taking a bath, let alone together. But, had either of them wanted to? Unlikely. But why not? Even before the quiet disdain had set in, he hadn’t asked her. What would have happened if he’d asked her for this?
“Ah, guess I’m stuck with it, then.” The man opens his mouth to argue, but Harry cuts him off. “Thanks, anyway.”
And it’s reassuring that sometimes being alone is the safest choice, because people are human, no matter how above the fray they think they are. It’s just another cabinet under the stairs, but this one locks from the
Ornery grey eyes watch him as one set of toes tries to tweak his nipple and fails entirely. Harry huffs a laugh that melts into another groan as thumbs dig into his forefoot.
If the wreath
Dead people or people he’s dead to.
The day’s Financial Times and Daily Prophet sit next to the largest pot, and Harry picks them up to scan the Prophet’s headline. He holds it up for Draco as he looks up from plucking spent blooms.
Adams scoffs and tugs his robes down as he turns toward the door. “You
“Bit futile.” Harry’s head tilts, briefly distracted by what spells would work best to hex someone’s cock off. “Oh! I stole your wand!”
“But it’s my house-”
Adams swings the iron bars of the cell door open and shoves Malfoy inside. A one-footed hop is all that keeps him from crashing to the floor.
The robe shifts, suddenly balanced, and Draco’s grey eyes turn mischievous. A metallic tinkle of jewelry to Harry’s side makes him turn away. Draco’s fingers hold the jewelry box up at shoulder height, and he turns it in inspection.
His fingertips dig into Draco’s chest and hips. His arms overlay the scars he left, a portent of how these bodies would return to each other. Over and over, he thrusts, tension building. Just as over and over, they’d found each other.
With a quick grin, Harry grabs the offending ankle and tickles right down the center of his sole.
Harry Potter
“How many?”
, you lanky fucker?”
Fumbling the styrofoam container out of the bag, Harry grumbles to himself, “Unusually helpful.”
“Fuck!”
“One.”
“Oh, just a poem I was reading,” Harry replies without looking up from his book. He automatically stretches an arm out to make room as Draco predictably flops onto the couch with him, snuggling into Harry's chest and pulling said arm around his shoulders. “It’s really sweet. Made me think of you.”
His black leather furniture is missing from the front room, and… everything is missing from the front room. Even the fucking peony-printed wallpaper is missing. In its stead, smooth lemon-yellow paint blossoms of its own accord over the bare, pockmarked plaster.
“Morning, Potter,” she chirps, as only a young nightshift Auror can, hazel eyes lacking the permanent bloodshot sheen of their coworkers.
“Harold,” he finally states. “I am obviously a leading expert in ruining one’s life with one’s dick. Obviously. And that is a terrible idea. Especially with what I suspect you’ve got in your pocket. And what I
The stairs are a coarse kind of smooth under his bare feet, and the living room is awash in golden, dusky sunlight that melts into the butter-yellow walls as if it’ll simply hibernate there until dawn.
Draco’s blush intensifies. “Merlin, Potter. I may not understand that, but the way you say it… conveys a lot already,” he says.
“Potter,” Draco warns, “this will end quickly if you do that.”
A thrill ripples through him at the thought of the body this bed welcomes at night. Alabaster skin sprawled over the deep blue velvet, possibly mere hours from now. Would the bed still be warm when Draco slipped into it? Would he notice?
The door glides open on oiled hinges, and it’s the smell that hits him first. Browned butter and herbs. Not dust and stale tea, though there is a hint of coffee under the savory aroma that coats the back of his tongue.
“God fucking damn,” Draco hisses, both hands wrapped around the pipes as he thrusts himself back.
“Draco, I-” Harry’s objection falters again.
His locker is empty. The paper crane is gone. His robes, holster, trainers, shower kit, and change of clothes are gone, too, but they’re not his first thought.
“Fancy meeting you here, Hazza.”
“Dracula Lacedaemonian Malignancy.”
“Mm hm,” she hums, the tip of her nose resting against the opening of her coffee lid. “I wouldn’t say he’s upset
Harry steps over the edge of the copper tub, picks a towel up off the floor, and wrecks his hair with it. Body dried, he squints at the wall of mismatched hooks, winds up, and throws the towel across the bathroom. It unfurls in midair and lands haphazardly across two of them. Good enough.
Draco sighs. “Is it tits? Did you get used to a set of ‘em bopping around while you fuck?”
Ginny must have told Ron to scrounge furniture from the back of the Weasley vault. His fingers trail over the blue and gold brocade back of the settee as he passes, then pauses. His palm runs a firm line down the backrest, sliding down the textured silk.
“Oh, God, Draco.”
For the second time in under an hour, Harry freezes mid-stride. Not a stick of furniture is where it should be. The couch has been blown open like a beached orca and is shoved against the fireplace. Stuffing tumbles from the split black leather in polyfill entrails. The matching armchairs are on their sides, as if grieving the death of the couch.
“Jesus,” Harry wheezes.
“When did he start putting surveillance in the Auror changing rooms?”
“They just can’t keep away,” Draco mutters, turning a page.
Adams growls softly under his breath. “You had your dick out in the alley next to the Leaky.”
Harry’s fingers gather suds and slick down his own hip, over his arse, and down to the tight furl of his entrance.
Draco huffs through a sardonic smile. “I am in a perpetual state of loitering, then.”
choose
Harry shuffles over and swaps out his half-eaten tray for Malfoy’s, a bit guilty he’s getting more than he’s giving.
“But we…” The snails tickle the back of his tongue, and he gulps them back down. “I mean, for like, a good year. Why didn’t he say anything?”
“Yeah,” Harry whispers. “Sure.”
Draco stills in his arms. “Yeah?”
His thoughts drift, as they have for years, to the simple awareness of his own body, careful to stay within its own bounds, because fantasy is for people who can admit to themselves what they want.
“Phht. Aurors are so closed-minded.” The floating hand turns and points right between Harry’s eyes, and he freezes. “Most of them.”
Three steps toward the bathroom, and Kreacher grunts in disapproval. The light coming from the bathroom is wrong again, but not like the mirror is broken. It’s the wrong color for the time of day, a rich russet hue like an indoor sunset. Ignoring the bare feet slapping the floor behind him, he peeks inside.
“Uhm, yeah, I-”
Harry’s mouth attempts a witty retort and settles for a whimper as Draco rubs his feet, kneading and working the cramped muscles until they loosen. Slowly, inch by inch, the rest of Harry’s body follows, sinking into the bed. His eyes drift shut, and if he didn’t know better, he’d swear his skin eased itself down against the soft flannel sheets.
His t-shirt peels off his back like a cold, wet second skin and takes his glasses with it. Something small skitters down his forehead, nose, then chin, and he bats blindly and sputters. Glasses back on, he steps back, looking for whatever just crawled down his face.
“What’s he in for?” Harry asks, as Adams sets a quill in motion.
On his cot, Malfoy eyes the tin and sighs resolutely before lacing his fingers behind his head. “I hate that shit.”
Harry’s fingers find the lump of the velvet box in his pocket, but it’s the opposite of comfort. It’s a lie, honed to cut with deadly precision.
“Harry Potter, leave,” he rasps.
“I can finish them, Reynolds. They won’t be able to get him on the docket for the morning Wizengamot session, anyway. He’ll be here all day.”
“I stopped taking my birth control two months ago, by the way,” she hisses, and he wonders for a split-second if she’s learned Parseltongue, because he hasn’t heard anyone enunciate around fangs and venom like that in years.
His fingers reach inside to flick the latch open, but he startles at a loud pop of Apparition. Pointed ears lay flattened back, and hard black eyes greet him.
“Can you take the Bind off him?”
“Coming in, then?” Harry asks with a wink.
“Wait! Why’d you dump her? She a shite lay?” Dean’s glassy brown eyes squint at him, hedging his bets. “Nah. Impossible.”
“Or you shrank,” Draco retorts. Fingers wrap around Harry’s half-hard cock, eliciting an eager hum. “Hm. Not all of you. Thankfully.”
Harry sips his water carefully and watches Malfoy pick the breading off his sausage roll, eating it first.
Draco’s back is an ancestral land and the nape of his neck calls Harry’s lips home.
The wreath slides off his head as he gazes up into blackness. The walls are polished mahogany bookshelves that stretch up so high his wand can’t illuminate them. Every bloody sort of book decorates the three walls. Tattered Grisham, gold-embossed Pompadour, C.S. Lewis, a full set of the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Animorphs series, Plato, Dickens, Stephen King, Jules Verne in English and French.
“Hey,” Harry says, a bit sharply.
“Fine, indecent exposure and public urination, but I don’t think the bloke on his knees was there for that.”
“Ah, but you didn’t lose me through greed, but sloth,” Draco says, finger pointed at Harry as he winks, awkward in the spray of water. “In fact, you were quite greedy, and I rather enjoyed it.”
Baffled, he shuffles down the hall to his desk. Jenkins and Adams lean over a scribbled-on sheet that bears the lines of an unfolded paper plane. Adams turns around to look at him first, Jenkins’ gaze following from his seat at the desk.
Draco’s brow furrows, but whether in anger or confusion, Harry can’t tell.
She’s in the middle of his kitchen, and it is
Draco’s gaze drifts up from Harry’s pocket, scans his face, and his own chin tilts in challenge. “
“Hm?” Harry hums as he regains control over his limbs, which he does apparently own. The lid of the dittany tin fits on with a slow exhale between metal rims.
“Jesus fucking Christ,” Harry chokes out between ragged gasps.
Someone sighs, and someone else responds in kind, an ancient sort of language, but one that’s new to them. Harry’s arm pulls Draco closer, bodies flush.
Harry grips the desk and glares over at Malfoy's cell. "
“Yeah, you do, don’t ya?” Malfoy snarks. “Under the right conditions.”
Her fingers are tipped with nails like claws, and he’s never thought of her as a Harpy, a Fury, an Erinyes before, but if anyone’s earned her vengeance, he has.
takes care of the evidence, but it takes several minutes of stretching against the wall to get the muscles in his feet to relax.
Ear cocked toward the door, Harry rounds the desk and finds the drawer. There’s no way Robards would have kept it in his desk. And there’s no-
“You what?” Draco’s knees drop, legs extending back out toward Harry.
Draco draws a long breath in against Harry’s skin and sighs again. Sighs like he’s always belonged there. Like it’s always been home. Like he’d always known.
“His name, his mother’s name, his owl’s name, his bloody childhood crup’s name.”
“That knob certainly found its higher calling in buggering,” Draco murmurs, feet wiggling between Harry’s thighs. “It was no big loss, anyhow.”
Malfoy’s tray is empty in mere moments, and he’s licking his fingers before it hits Harry how hungry he must have been. He rips off a bite of the sausage roll in front of him and waits, thumb over his wand holster, for death by Dark magic. Nothing.
“Fucking bastard.”
Harry’s glasses cover one eye, and he rights them primly. “I don’t know if I want that filthy mouth anywhere near my very clean arse.”
Linner? Suppfast? Breakunch?
“Uh huh, I-”
MimeoQuills are spread over the duplicate forms before he dares look up again. Draco is still leaned over, elbows on his knees, with the book in his hands like he’s going to preach from it.
Kreacher looms at the top of the stairs, backlit by more sunlight than the second floor has ever seen. He wears a tailored little suit, and Harry runs self-conscious hands through his hair in an attempt to tame it.
“Harry! Guesswut!” Neville slurs, leaning over Harry’s desk. Firewhisky rolls off him in a volatile wave. Chocolate brown eyes focus and unfocus on Harry’s face, one of them drifting shut.
A throat clears behind the curtain. “I suppose.” Low and smooth, like melting sugar, and Harry’s face goes pale and cold despite the heat.
“Well, we can add sex in a public lavatory, then.” Adams fans out several forms and initials the corners of all of them. “And public drunkenness.”
Blue, blue, blue. “Yeah, one of them got the bright idea to break out a back window.” Mint-colored citation forms top the three stacks. “That’s when Ron sent a
The ninth one is tacky black currant as the kid asks for his wish to be granted.
“I’m going to sleep, Potter.”
A breathtakingly drunk Neville shambles through the door, listing toward the wall till he’s walking with one shoulder sliding along the tile. Behind him, Seamus Finnigan struts in, short-cropped hair and square jaw a juxtaposition to his rounded frame and glassy eyes.
It’s either five seconds or five minutes before the realization hits him, battering its way through the post-adrenaline haze. The wreath is gone. The wreath is inside. Malfoy took it inside. Malfoy is
“The MimeoQuills?” Draco gasps out. His skin under Harry’s lips is flushed pink and tastes of sweat.
Apparate to the Burrow and confirm Hermione’s assessment?
It’s immature as fuck, and he’s going to do it, anyway.
Most likely the chasm, then. Not the bed.
