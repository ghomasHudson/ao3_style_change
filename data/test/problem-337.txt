Harry was patting down his ‘too-tight’ trousers as he stared at himself in the mirror, he hated Ginny and her friends for harassing him into wearing these ridiculous pants that showed off a bit too much for his typical liking.
Draco did one quick sweep of the room they were staged in. He noticed a small Muggle-like camera, secreted away in one of the room’s high corners. He eyed it suspiciously for a few moments. Perhaps someone was watching to make sure nothing terrible or untoward happened here. That fact should have made him feel better about this whole set-up; instead, Draco’s stomach felt heavy.
Without much thought, Harry summoned his best red wine wandlessly, not noticing how Malfoy openly adjusted himself in his trousers. Sometimes Harry didn’t realize how much his wandless magic affected others.
and familiar way that Harry was more than used to - not seeing in person exactly - but known to do to himself from time to time.
Then again, he never in his wildest (maybe his wildest) dreams would have imagined this could ever be a reality for him. He believed that the closest he would ever get to anything sexual with Potter would be a late-night wank with thoughts of him and his Quidditch uniform or rubbing off to him speaking gibberish in Potions class.
Harry didn’t respond; he couldn’t answer, his mouth still open, this time in a silent cry as he came, nails digging deliciously into Draco’s back and his head thrown back, eyes wholly dazed.
Slowly, he began moving his hips to and fro, allowing the magical fleshlight to do half the work as well.
“Can you give me a verbal confirmation?” Draco asked as he traced his finger along a collarbone lightly.
The slight ache in his jaw was a reminder of the pleasure he provided for the man above him. He opened his eyes wider to take it all in as well and moaned around him at the sight.
But before Harry could respond, Malfoy had already made up his own mind, his own needs coming in-between any games being played.
Draco then must have decided to play games too, as he began thrusting into Harry harder than usual, and the whole upper half of his body propelled forward from the impact.
Harry only stared dully back at Malfoy before ordering two chilled shots of tequila. Roddy snickered.
Harry kept finding his eyes drifting between his mates, who were complaining about Gryffindor’s quidditch team, to Malfoy and his lot across the bar. Harry took in Malfoy’s unusually pleasing demeanor as his expression broke into a wry grin at whatever it was Zabini was going on about.
He waved to his fans, as he placed his mic back before strutting back to his own table where his group was hooting out their own praises.
Clenching his jaw, Harry glared at Hermione’s pitying expression. “Look! I have to find out who this sodding person is! It’s driving me mad, okay?”
Potter only softly smiled at that, his teeth biting his lower lip, and Draco wanted to rip it from him and bite it himself, only him. “Apparently, there are better subs out there than me. Subs who are more mendable, flexible to his particular whims.”
Harry found himself smiling unconsciously as he watched. At least he wasn’t staring at his mobile all night, which had been Ron’s goal all along.
A few seconds passed before Neville and Luna both decided to join in on the havoc on the dancefloor, Luna performing what looked to be some sort of ceremonial dance to bring about - something or another.
He reached out a hand and placed one over Draco’s shaking hand, closing his own around it to calm him down.
He stood under the water for a few minutes, as if that was a completely normal thing to do whilst wearing lingerie, his arse moving to and fro as he twisted and turned under the hot water, making sure every bit of the lace was soaked.
Besides, why go through all that trouble when he could just sit back and enjoy the show right in front of him?
"I don't think this is house-elf magic. It's more likely an ancient curse placed on the house by Sirius's ancestors. You will need to contact a professional curse breaker to lift it."
He could feel the wetness pooling in his trousers and wondered if it would stain with pants to catch it.  But the worry went flying out the window when the muttering got a decibel louder, and Draco bit back a whimper, nonchalantly moving his left hand down to his lap, lightly rubbing at himself through his trousers.
They had agreed minutes prior that a walk sounded nice. They had been in the middle of a conversation that Draco had been desperately pushing back for quite a while, but Harry couldn't wait anymore, it seemed." Harry couldn’t wait anymore; it seemed. But it had escalated to a tipping point, and Draco was seconds from hyperventilating or throwing something at his boyfriend’s head.
Rather, Harry was frustrated at himself for not giving in to the attention and internally groaned at himself for being so hard-up. It had clearly been too long for him with that kind of thing. He shook his head and entered the room.
“You know, you could be a Slytherin, with the way you sneak around like that.” Draco turned around to face the other man, quickly hiding his surprise at how close he was standing.
They had ended up at the same hole-in-the-wall karaoke bar that Seamus and Dean had dragged him and Ron to a few Thursdays ago, and Harry appreciated the familiarity of it. Still, it didn't help that he was staring at Smith’s face across from him and not his mates.
As he watched Luna wave her hands about in her explanation of house-elves well beings, Harry wondered all the ways he could kill his boyfriend and make it seem like an accident.
The kiss quickly melted into something more heated, more desperate. Harry reached up and placed both hands on each side of Draco’s face, holding him in place as if he might flee at any moment.
As he slipped through the same hole, Harry tried not to think too hard about the fact that he was willingly escaping past curfew again, to see Malfoy
Malfoy’s raspy voice in his ear had Harry shaking; he wasn’t sure if he would be able to hold his legs up at this rate.
A few seconds passed after that, and a thought occurred to Harry, and he knew he had to get it out before it completely ate away at whatever sanity he had left at this point.
Malfoy’s grey eyes found him instantly across the table, surveying him, and Harry suddenly felt naked.
Malfoy stared at him for a few more seconds, eyeing him and clearly making a decision mentally, “I...suppose we might need quite a few thorns...you can come along if you’d like.”
“Honestly, Potter, I would think you were eleven years old again.” he huffed and flicked some water into his face, which just made Harry laugh even harder.
Snatching his hand back quickly as if it were burned, his eyes widened comically as the realization hit him upside the head like a bludger bat.
Today’s song was different than usual. More gloomy and dark. Harry sat and pondered this song for a while as he sat on the Quidditch bleachers.
Potter stared over at the other man for a few more seconds in an attempt to gain the higher ground but then visibly collapsed in defeat.
Harry popped off, “You know, I’m not a Seer myself, so if you could speak up, I’d love to hear what it is you’re - mmph!” Draco smirked down at the man as he fed him his cock to shut him up, but Harry didn’t mind in the slightest.
He felt his cock harden even further as he could hear the rain of the shower water and the way Malfoy let out soft “oh, ohs” each time his fist reached the tip of his cock.
As thoughts filtered through his head, he nodded to the bartender and ordered his second double firewhiskey of the night, mulling over his next moves.
A filthy part of Harry’s mind wished he had brought a camera or video capturer of some kind, not to threaten Malfoy with, oh no...just for future personal uses is all.
“Please, Draco, for Merlin’s sake—” Harry hiccuped adorably, and Draco reached up and traced his lover’s lips with an index finger, still wet from Harry’s cock.
Harry frowned though; instead of feeling his joggers that had adorned his lower-half, now he felt the air hit his bare legs.
The color reminded Harry of Malfoy’s eyes, which were now staring directly his way. He stared stupidly back, his friend’s shots in his hands as he precariously made his way back to his seat with an awkward shuffle.
“Erm - well, I sent you that note,” Potter stated as he played with a bit of string that was peeking out from his quilt on his bed, looking away from him. Like Draco wasn’t the one who
The song Harry received that very next morning was even more of an incentive to find out who in the hell it is.
Malfoy certainly took his time from there, as he decided to fluff up his towel instead of turning around, and Harry hadn’t realized how he wished for him to turn to face him desperately until he caught himself pawing at the wall like an animal with his hands.
Harry forced another round of Quidditch through his head; he imagined himself playing this time, no Malfoy in-sight, which allowed him to calm down enough for his erection to die away for the most part, even with Malfoy’s hands which had wandered quite far down near his V lines, before they left his body completely before he cleared his throat to signal he was done.
Do you want me to keep going or-?” Harry started as he leaned back to look at Draco in the eye, but he wasn’t having any of it.
Glancing once at Pansy, who was currently talking to a different redheaded firecracker at the bar on her other side, he looked to the dance floor again, and his eyes immediately found his target.
Luna must have finally broken away from greeting guests and floated over to Harry at some point; he wasn’t sure when. He was too busy trying to count the number of sequins on Draco’s silver vest.
Bright brown eyes blinked up at Harry as the man in question nodded with a broad grin, his whole face brightening up at the sight of Harry. Harry immediately reached a hand out for the man to shake, only for it to be ignored entirely, and Harry felt unfamiliar arms wrap around his torso instead.
If you asked Ron, that was more of a nightmare than anything else. He could still hear Hermione’s shrill scream in his head after Ron had thrown up on her after getting off the Tower of Terror. He smiled to himself at the memory as he sat half his arse on an open bar-stool.
“Potter.” he nodded once. Harry’s mouth widened in a more confident smile at that, teeth and all, and Draco had to remember how to breathe.
The man in question huffed out an ugly laugh, “This happens to be my scene, and that -” he pointed to Potter like he was yesterday’s trash and Draco growled, “- just happens to be my boyfriend. But you already knew that, didn’t you. I did invite you, not my request, I can assure you of that.” Jakob then eyed his boyfriend with distrust before his eyes glinted back to Draco.
He then pictured Malfoy and what he would in this position, and a tantalizingly filthy image of Malfoy taking a shower next after Harry was through and having a turn with his toy had Harry growing harder inside the toy.
Malfoy rolled his eyes so hard that Harry was worried they’d get stuck there. “Don’t be daft, Potter. You can’t rub this in by yourself.” He then opened the bottle and squirted some more of the aloe on his hands, slowly rubbing it in on his own hands to warm it up, Harry supposed, as he watched, mesmerized at the sight.
He moaned, unable to contain himself. Potter was so tight around his cock. He expected him to be loose from the other rounds, but the enveloping heat was tight as a vice.
He briefly wondered how he would get past the Fat Lady when he saw the golden boy himself, standing to the side as others passed by him in a flutter. But he only had eyes for Draco.
But what was awaiting him certainly wasn’t anything near what he would have even guessed if anyone had asked him seconds prior.
Draco raised an eyebrow once again, body thrumming with desire just from his voice alone, but he didn’t want Potter to know that. “That’s where you are wrong. You invited me up here for some sort of wicked reason.”
It was infuriating, how it was almost as if the unknown sender was trying to tell Harry something in song lyrics. Which, if Harry thought about it, he would realize that sounded mad even to him.
He wanted this project for Slughorn to go well, and he figured a sore throat or a fight of any type wouldn’t be the best start.
Without giving him another second to back out, he downed his drink and swayed toward the dance floor, which hadn’t relented all night as there were more bodies than there had been in the last half hour.
Harry glanced at Malfoy before slowly putting his device back in his dress robes pocket. “Why’d you ask?”
He moved his hand away, forcing himself to pick up his quill again to pretend he was writing up notes on the reading, when in all actuality, he was ever so slightly moving his hips over the edge of the desk, praying to Merlin no one would catch on or look up at the sight of him rubbing off at the sound of Potter’s voice in front of him.
Yet there the git was, adjusting the mic to his height. And Harry unabashedly took his fill of the scene unfolding in front of him, excitement pooling in his stomach in a way that made him squirm.
This wasn’t true at all, of course, he enjoyed coming into Malfoy's space, listening to his records, and working on their project with casual talking intermingled.
“Nah, he needs extra help with the new product lines that are coming out soon for the holiday season for W3. And at least I’m not throwing away my life every other weekend as an Auror. My job isn't
He looked away when he realized Harry had caught him in the act, opening his mouth to change the subject entirely before Harry could say something about it.
“Oh my... Well, I’m sure we can fix this…” Hermione’s voice cracked as she attempted to pick up the massive tree and immediately discarded that task to pick up some broken pieces of glass from the vases.
“You are.” Harry tried to ignore the way his breath caught in his throat from the pure intensity he was feeling at this moment; he wasn’t sure if hearing Typhon’s song made his heart pound, or if it was because Malfoy was wearing the same blazing look from before he went  on stage, in his eyes as he studied Harry.
“Isn’t he a Seer anyway? Can’t those types see the future and all that bollocks? He should know you two are
The Slytherin then straightened up, adjusted his towel around his waist, and turned around to disappear into the main hallway on the other end that led to the main common room.
Draco’s heart skipped a beat as he stared down at his boyfriend, how perfect and beautiful he was, always willing to please him.
Draco first introduced Justin to Harry and everyone else at the Burrow at Hermione’s birthday party, a few months before Christmas. The two had been dating for a few months before that, and Harry never could find out why Draco hadn’t introduced him to his boyfriend before then, but he tried not to think much of it.
He struggled towards the end, grunting as he tried desperately to get the sodding things off his erection, which was practically sticking straight out. Malfoy leaned over and pulled them down the rest of the way, the cool air finally hitting his cock above him and Malfoy stared at it as if it was a work of art.
A few hours later, Harry awoke to Malfoy beside him in the bed, watching him with a look that closely resembled affection.
Draco watched, delighted, as Harry pushed back onto the toy, back and forth, trying desperately to get that vibration feeling where he needed it most.
Harry didn’t particularly want to remember Luna’s last Christmas party, Malfoy drunk off his arse, and jumping Harry under the mistletoe.
Potter couldn’t look more mouth-wateringly filthy if he tried, his mouth open and drooling around the ring gag, his reddened cock wrapped up in that damned cock ring like a present Draco wanted, no, needed, to rip open.
When the hero had come out as bisexual a few months ago, Draco remembered that day very well indeed.
At the same time, the other Houses merely stared; even Ron gave up and slid in next to Harry on the loveseat to watch his dance partner win the competition easily without his help.
He wondered if Malfoy found Harry different from the boy he grew up with, or perhaps Malfoy hadn’t paid him much mind since the start of the school year. He wondered if Malfoy liked this version of Harry better, or at least, found him more intriguing than his past self from before the War.
“Mr. Potter! Please take those blasted earbuds out; if I have to send you to Headmistress McGonagall again for overusing your device, she won’t be pleased.” Professor Slughorn groused, clearly not having a good day himself, sighing something along the lines of “ruddy contraptions” and “back in my day-.”
“I don’t believe I have control over your comings and goings, Potter, or any control over you at all.” Malfoy looked him up and down, in a similar manner to the way he had looked at Rodrick.  Harry shivered.
He grabbed the newest toy, lightly touched the velvet feel of it before shutting the drawers, and he heard Harry’s intake of breath at that. Like he was waiting on pins and needles for his return.
Malfoy gestured to one of the colorful slim covers that lay beside the stack of others; this one, in particular, was darker in color, and Harry swallowed back his tongue as he grabbed it to take a closer look at the picture on the front.
Draco couldn’t help but smirk at Potter’s bumbling and stepped closer to him, reaching a hand up to straighten his bow tie. He watched Potter’s throat as he swallowed, but instead of backing off, he simply took a small step closer as well.
Suddenly the memory of Ron complaining to Harry about how obsessed he was with Malfoy back in sixth year rose to the surface, and Harry wanted to laugh and cry simultaneously.
Draco thought, as he stood outside the tattered old building on the outskirts of Knockturn Alley, where the coordinates in the said letter had led him. He glanced left and right before raising the hood of his robes and slowly opening the nondescript door, which creaked with age.
Harry only laughed at that, which earned him a pinch on his arse from Draco. “I gathered that much, thank you very much. Considering how you were eyeing that flogger of mine the other day like you wanted to tie me up and have your wicked way with me.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "Kreacher and, I'm sure, this house already respects my ancestry but as the new owner,
"Indeed it would, Master Black," said Kreacher, then turned to Harry. "The Mistress' and Master's portraits would also appreciate it if you ceased walking the halls without any clo–"
“Hmmm…” Luna blinked and nodded once, her eyes hazy with thoughts Harry was glad he wasn’t privy to. “Well, whatever you say, Harry.”
He moved a hand over his mouth, realizing his breathing had become rather hot and heavy just from that image in particular. Not that Malfoy would be able to hear it over the shower noise, but one can never be too careful.
He licked his way inside Draco’s mouth, causing another sigh to leave him. Harry brought a hand up to lightly hold onto the back of Draco’s head to keep him there, not wanting this moment to end anytime soon.
Harry visibly flinched as Draco finally wrapped a hand around his now rigid prick and gave him a few strokes before moving onto whatever the hell kind of dastardly act he had planned next.
“You absolute arse, you are the biggest bloody pillock I have ever seen!” Potter raged on for a bit, while Draco only continued straddling him, hips moving teasingly slow over him, and Potter’s rant was cut off as a whine came out of his throat instead.
But out of the corner of his sight, he noticed Malfoy stand up from his booth and head over to the stage in a manner similar to the last time. Harry felt his heart speed up as Malfoy grabbed the microphone, adjusting it to his height once again.
However, his attention was drawn to a few others taking their chance at surfing further out in the water.
Harry audibly swallowed as he twitched in the chair. “It sure seems that way. You aren’t terrible at it, so to speak.”
Hermione only glared at Harry from her spot by the sink, her arms crossed menacingly over her chest in such a way only she could accomplish. She waited until her husband left to put the kids to bed, and then her reign of terror began.
He bristled then and turned around again to face the array of soaps at his disposal. But the thought of Harry using the sex toy was enough to entice other parts of him, as his cock came to life, and Harry groaned pitifully, staring down at it woefully.
Draco knew if he heard his name come from Potter’s lips, his cock would either fall off or wither away, so that would be a perfect safe-word for tonight at least.
The same bartender from yesterday looks from him to Harry, interest glinting in his dark eyes. “I take it you two know each other then?”
“What does it bloody look like, Harry?!” Hermione's eyes lit up in a way that promised pain if Harry didn't accept the gift.
His cock hadn’t weakened in the slightest from the song lyrics or Malfoy playing a starring role in his spank-bank for the night.
The trio made it back to the bar, and Roddy poured him a generous amount of water, this time no salt in it to Harry’s immense relief as he downed the glass. “And I thought you couldn’t get any more pathetic, yet here we are.” Malfoy mused, sitting across from Harry and making sure to give him the most satisfied smirk.
“Shhh,” Malfoy then gently raised his other hand that held the plug and pressed the metal tip against his lips, "I know what you need."
Pliant under his boyfriend’s touch, Draco took this as a sign to slip one finger inside him, and Harry’s mouth went dry.
Harry felt the fleshlight retract from him, and he was able to pull the rest of the way out with a satisfied sigh.
For their eighth year, Headmistress McGonagall set up the students into one big happy tower together to promote harmony and new house alliances.
Harry recklessly kept singing off-pitch as he heard whispers in the crowd. He didn’t care in the slightest. His eyes were glued to Malfoy, who was looking more and more likely to cut his throat as the song went on.
Draco finally made his way through the crowd, and he reached out a hand and grasped Potter’s wrist a tad too tightly.
Harry’s eyes closed as he let out a long breath of air. It wasn’t in his plans today to have Draco Malfoy see and judge his sex toys, let alone hold one of them, yet here he was.
?” Harry took the piece of paper from her, which turned out to be thicker than he expected, and took a closer look.
Draco’s hand tightened in his hair as well, as he gently brought him back further to his aching cock for more.
He looked at Malfoy and found him glaring up at something or someone from behind Harry, and Harry was worried he would curse whoever it was.
He did have the mindset to take the invisibility cloak off this time, though. He got settled in and comfortable in his usual spot by the peephole, using the cloak as extra cushion for his bum.
As hard as it was to prevent them, the images kept coming, literally, in his mind. One, in particular, of Malfoy, quickly fucking his fleshlight hard after a long day’s work, while another man fucked him from behind had Harry’s own thrusts quicken, his breath’s coming out in quiet moans at each thurst.
Harry couldn't hide his annoyance with Ron for jumping to his wife’s side so quickly in all this as he glared over at him before biting his bottom lip as he stared down to the leaflet in his hands.
There were a few seconds of no movement above him; silence pervaded the air and he started to sweat. He twitched a bit from where he lay, and finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Malfoy cleared his throat and began rubbing the cold aloe on his stomach.
He only struggled in his restraints in response, pushing his hips up ever so slightly to get any kind of friction against his cock. All the while, Draco ignored his own throbbing erection to tend to the begging man laying down in front of him.
Ron must have noticed his discomfort as he raised his brows at him in concern. Harry only gave him a strained smile, and his eyes went back to Hermione and Luna as they continued their speech to the rest of the group.
Unbeknownst to Harry, Rodrick muttered, "I don't know how I feel about that one there…you best watch him.” under his breath as he handed Malfoy his drink. “Good thing that he isn’t bad on the eyes though, eh?”
Harry caught the smirk that erupted on Malfoy’s face at Seamus’ words and had an urge to look away but found he couldn’t.
"Merlin, you are unbelievable." He leaned in and kissed Harry soundly, sucking on his bottom lip, causing Harry to groan in his mouth as he knotted his hands further in his hair. Harry reached behind him, grasping at his shirt for any leverage at all, finding none as Malfoy reached around and grabbed his wrists, holding them above his head on the bed.
“The nargles in the mistletoe have senses that us humans don’t.” Hermione piped in, her face a red tint as Ron looked at her in disbelief. “I remember readi-”
Harry kept pushing his luck, his hand with his mic shaking as he stared Malfoy down, unable to face anyone else right now.
Green eyes met Draco’s own, hard, grey ones. He waited until he had his full attention before he grabbed him and dragged him to a hidden alcove, away from any windows where anyone could catch them.
He began moving them up and down, keeping Harry on edge, and by the gasp from him, Draco smirked to himself, knowing he was succeeding. Being tied up, it was difficult for Harry to gather his bearings, but Draco had to give it to him; he attempted his very best to get more of Draco’s touch however he could.
He had gotten the hang of putting his boyfriend’s insistent fingering in the back of his mind to the best of his ability, when without warning, Harry felt Draco’s fingers exit and his cock enter him within seconds, no warning given at all. His quill broke in half from his hand, a stain of ink bleeding out on the tiled floor.
Draco’s eye rolled in the back of his head at a particularly perfectly aimed thrust, and his hands moved from Potter’s back to his shapely arse and kneaded the muscle there. He grinned when Potter’s voice trembled slightly.
Harry was twitching around, attempting to get a proper look around at everyone, and he saw Ron snigger at him from his spot at the table beside Kingsley. Harry just gave him the finger.
The other man finally finished, allowing the water to clean up the mess, and Harry watched as he started humming a little tune as he shut the water off without cleaning or washing up.
“Besides, it’s kinda witty, innit? ‘Little Lion Man’? A Gryffindor nod, I suspect.” Ron bobbed his head with a satisfied grin as if he had just solved all of Harry’s problems with that simple statement and dived in for more pudding.
Potter’s tone of voice switched at that and went from sexy snake to incredibly indecent and lewd in seconds.
“Erm - are you sure this person isn’t trying to kidnap you and eat your brain?” Hermione implored, eyebrows high on her forehead as she listened to Typhon’s newest song at Harry’s insistence.
Harry leaned back and moaned, whining as Draco grabbed his cock and circled it around his entrance, not entirely entering him.
They were all standing by the (unfortunately untouched) punch bowl (thanks to McGonagall) staring at each other and laughing at all the awkward fourth years. Some of the boys seemed to be failing at asking the girls to dance if their up-turned noses were anything to go by.
please. You can do whatever you want to me, whatever you want at all. Just please...please, please-”
“You heard me.” He felt Malfoy’s hot breath intermingled with the steam of the shower on his neck, and he shivered once more. “It won’t let go until its job is complete. That’s how I charmed it. Its job is to get its user off.”
His breath caught when he finally stood between Potter’s legs. There was a dark green dildo, snug against his cheeks, up his arse. He wanted to bow down to the arresting sight of it.
me to fuck you that night.” He stated bluntly, as he began to pull out of him, only to push back with more strength than before. Harry’s eyes opened from where he had them clenched shut, watching Draco as he fucked into him faster. “Yes,” Harry replied, licking his reddened lips, and Draco could only groan.
Potter’s earlier apprehensiveness disappeared as he spoke clearly to his boss about the last few weeks on the job; Weasley and Granger stood side by side on his left, Granger’s dress tickling Draco’s arm as she stood beside him, making the awkward circle complete, to his silent duress.
Draco groaned. “Fuck Potter. If you don’t start speaking English in the next three seconds, I am going to apparate us both out of here faster than you can blink.”
Potter’s cock was rock hard against Draco’s thigh, and he moved to drag it over him, adding to the movement, and that had Potter reeling, hands grasping his arms for balance.
Harry blearily looked up to see both Malfoy and Rodrick gazing down at him with looks stuck between amusement and pity.
! I can’t believe this…” Harry covered his face with both hands as he laid on his back on the bed, not knowing if he wanted to laugh or cry.
Harry licked his swollen lips, tasting a bit of come that landed on his bottom lip, and moaned in appreciation, smiling in the realization that his jaw was rather sore, but in the best possible way.
Once, he sat down Harry felt someone else looking his way and turned to see Hermione giving him one of her favorite looks, the one she gave him when he did something foolish.
Harry’s stubble made for an excellent feeling for Draco, yet he wanted to get to the main event. He reached down and grasped a handful of dark, curly hair; and leaned down to whisper lowly, “If you don’t hurry up and suck my cock, Potter, you won’t get the surprise I’ve been waiting all week to show you.”
The music’s soft thrums penetrated his ears at once. Harry recognized the guitar strums immediately. He stilled, his heart racing in his chest, he had to remember how to breathe before he passed out right there at the bar.
Harry inhaled the cold night air, belatedly registering how out of breath he was from attempting to find his music soulmate. He leaned over the cool railing, the wind soothing on his overheated skin.
Harry was able to get a hold of himself right as Draco added another finger. “N-no Hermione, I’m alright. Just a bit hot in here is all. A-anyone else hot?”
“You?! Admitting to being a twat?” Harry gently moved a piece of blond hair away from the pale face beside him, slowly becoming unimpressed as he watched Harry make fun of him.
And the drinks kept coming, mainly thanks to Seamus, who was apparently on a mission to get them just as pissed tonight as he had been last night.
Harry shook his head, “No," his voice was already rough, "no, I brought it especially for this trip; I wanted to try it here for the first time.”
were the one who got yourself in this...sticky predicament. I figure it’s up to you on how to get out.”
Of course, his mind quickly replaced the knife he was using to chop up beetles with something else entirely in those delicate hands.
Harry felt a warmth flow through him, and he immediately pushed himself further into his mattress; a familiar stirring of arousal pulsing through him just from the words of the song alone.
“Tessie’s. Yeah.” Ron looked as though he was about to cry into his breakfast, and Harry patted his back as Ginny laughed raucously across the table at her brother’s unfortunate expense.
Hermione just stared bluntly at him, as if he was the dimmest person in the room. And he believed it at that moment.
All he had to worry about at first was Seamus spamming him with what the Muggles apparently called “memes.” He ended up blocking his number within the first forty-eight hours.
Malfoy visibly started at that but did a decent job of covering it up, running a hand through his perfectly coiffed hair that always laid immaculate on top of his head.
Wordlessly, he followed the other man, noticing a few faces turned his way with some questionable glances, but on the whole, folks kept to themselves. He figured people were tired of fighting and asking questions that didn’t concern them after the war.
Draco blinked once, and once again as he took in the pitiful man beside him, and started to chuckle lowly in his throat before it broke through his pursed lips and became a full guffawing laugh at Harry’s expense.
Potter had been there longer than him and Pansy both, his dark hair hanging over his face in parts, and as the disco light overhead moved a specific way, Draco could see the sweat running down one side of his neck.
Harry knew of Draco’s tendency of having an odd boyfriend here and there that he would keep for a few weeks at a time before dropping them like a Whizzing Whizbee.
Well, at least Harry thought it was at his expense, but it seemed that wasn’t the case with the look on the blond’s face.
“Draco! Oh god, I’m so close.” He cried out as the tip of the toy began massaging directly onto his prostate with each thrust.
Potter’s lips upturned in a slightly nervous grin as Draco made his way closer, and a few inquisitive eyes trailed past them, probably curious as to why Draco Malfoy was within mere feet of the Gryffindor’s Tower.
It was probably close to the sixth time Slughorn had caught him listening to his music; the fourth time, he was sent to McGonagall and only received one of the strongest eye-rolls he had ever witnessed, along with a biscuit.
Ron’s mouth pursed in thought, “Sounds like they’re tryin’ to tell you something there. Has anyone here ever punched you in the face?”
Potter was arching up, pulling at the restraints in an attempt to get closer or pull Draco in even further. Draco huffed out a breath and slide in the rest of the way until his swollen balls rested against the man’s backside. He gave himself a moment to adjust.
Harry felt his whole body heat up; the shots must have just hit him in one fell swoop. His vision wavered as the bright lights illuminated Malfoy’s figure from the stage.
Harry’s eyes followed the other man’s form as he got dressed, toweling through his damp hair, and walked out.
He had only smelled the potion all but once four years ago in Slughorn’s class during sixth year, but he figured it would smell mostly the same.
He thought back to the raid from earlier, nitpicking each step they both took and what could have prevented what could have been a particularly gruesome disaster, and rolled his eyes at the mistakes he made himself. He shouldn’t have just barged in there like a first-year recruit.
“I like it.” Malfoy’s eyes were lit up by the lanterns that hung outside, embellishing the quiet fire underneath that stare.
Harry found himself wondering if the man would be open to teaching him a few moves on his surfboard later on, but when he got even closer, he looked frighteningly familiar, so much so that Harry wasn’t certain with the sun in his face, but he almost looked like -
Harry wiped his sweaty palms off on his trousers, not looking anywhere near the other man, and made his way over to the table where their papers were littered about, knocking into things on his way.
Doomed, hopeless...now those were words he could heavily relate to as he eyed Zacharias Smith, sitting across from him taking shot after shot on a “date” he asked him for earlier, on a wild whim before their Charms class.
As he sat in Potions class later that day, Harry’s mind drifted to the peephole again, wondering if Malfoy would even be there again that night.
Speaking of Hermione, when she wasn’t in the library studying or breathing down Harry’s neck, her and Ron,
“Good boy.” Jakob hummed towards Potter, clearly pleased, as he strapped on the new o-ring gag tight over his mouth.
Malfoy himself took that as a cue to leave, only to come back seconds later with a clean, fluffy towel, which Harry graciously took from him with a nod.
It was all over quickly, as in what seemed like a matter of seconds, the man’s board skimmed the sand to a delicate stop.
He reached around Potter and pulled out his erection without any fanfare, realizing at that moment how desperate he was for him, and just from the light touch on his cock, Draco could tell Potter was in the same predicament.
He still laughs whenever he thinks about last Christmas and the ridiculously enormous dildo she bestowed him as a gift at the Burrow. That was the reddest he had ever seen Arthur’s face.
Thankfully, there was a lovely, large fireplace in their suite’s sitting room, and Harry had all his notes prepared as he watched the clock tick down, sitting in front of the fireplace and waiting for Kingsley to give him the all-clear to join in.
Harry felt his heart flutter in his chest at the lyrics, wanting nothing more than to find Typhon, grab them, whoever the hell they were, and hex them for hiding from him. And then maybe snog the sense right out of them after.
They were just the first couple he thought of, is all, as his reasons why he shouldn’t show up to the party ran through his mind.
Not that Draco knew everything about him; he could speak ten other languages for all he knew. But...he had never heard Potter mention it, nor any of his other loyal followers, nor
As soon as he had gotten back to his room that first night and laid under the covers (after having one of the best (and quickest) orgasms of his recent memory), he promised himself that he would never go looking for Malfoy in the showers again.
Harry swore his ears were ringing, either that, or he had passed out for a split second. He couldn’t remember a time he had come that hard in his whole life, and it was all thanks to Draco Malfoy.
Draco complained something about that not being what being a Seer is all about, as per usual, but Harry was too engrossed in his cock to pay much attention to his garbled complaints.
The image of him stuck in this bloody fleshlight and Malfoy coming to check on him hours from now entered his mind, and he had to stop himself from laughing hysterically at that.
Harry nodded and groaned loudly again, and Draco slowed his thrusts down a bit, wanting to stretch out this moment for as long as he could for Harry.
Draco promised himself when he left the shabby, dilapidated building after fucking Potter’s brains out that night that he would put it all out of his head, never to think back on the perfect way Potter gave way beautifully. The erotic sounds that came out of him. The utterly indescribable feeling of coming inside him.
“There - there isn’t a spell? Or some way to reverse this?!” Draco sounded a tad hysterical at this point as he looked to Luna, who shook her head, a soft frown gracing her features. Harry felt sick to his stomach.
Harry quickly answered, and Draco couldn’t hold it back any longer. Even if Harry refused to ask for it directly, he was 98% sure he would have given him what he needed.
Nodding, Kingsley waved to the nearest barmen for another drink for him and Draco both, and Draco graciously accepted his, a part of him disappointed for missing the perfect moment to leave before Kingsley walked up.
Harry’s breath caught in his throat, starting a coughing fit. Malfoy quickly stood up from his spot on his duvet, “For the love of Merlin, Potter!” A hand came up and caressed his back, which made Harry’s coughing substantially worse before it hit his back a few times a bit too roughly.
“Oh? "He told you to come begging for forgiveness, did he?" Draco growled, not wanting to speak on the man he so despised.
“Erm - and with that, I turn it over to Ron, who I believe had some additional research done about the whereabouts of certain much more disadvantaged house-elves.
Potter nodded, and Draco pushed him face-first against the brick wall, nibbling down his bare throat, undoing his bow-tie. “I’m going to fuck you so hard that your bastard of an ex-boyfriend will be able to feel it.”
is that it then?” Harry scoffed deprecatingly. “Is that why you invited me to your dormitory? You wanted some quality time with me and how I smell?”
The Slytherin was wearing a dark burgundy robe, tied up in the front but enough leeway to allow his lithy chest to show, his pale legs strutting up to the shower stall as he bent over and laid his shower supplies in a cubby hanging lowly on the wall.
It looked rather old if the telltale signs of paint chipping on the sides were any tell. A needle-like piece stuck out from the rest of the box as it ran its tip over what looked like a black disc.
Here he was; in the middle of the night, kneeling on a dirty floor, and staring at Malfoy’s nude arse through a peephole like a bloody perv.
“Because I wanted my hands on you. I have wanted my hands on you for so long but after last Christmas...I needed to feel you again.”
But Harry didn’t particularly pay much mind to his hair products, his eye too transfixed on his pale arse, as Malfoy leaned over to grab whatever other soap he needed at that moment from the ground, causing it to stick out from under the water, begging to be stared at.
“Sorry...sorry I shouldn’t have lost control like that, I just don’t want you to think that way, blame yourself for
“Yes, I’m aware.” Malfoy leaned over to try to see the other toys he brought with him, but Harry stepped in his way before he could get a good look into the suitcase. “Interesting choice of profession, I must admit.” Malfoy eyed him up and down before turning around and grabbing the aloe, gesturing for Harry to get up on the bed. "Sex toy inventor? Not the profession I had picked out for you all those years ago at school, yet here we are."
Instead, he stirred himself and watched Malfoy’s pointy face as he meticulously poured the last of the powdered moonstone into their potion.
Draco nodded, first finishing the remainder of his drink and vanishing the glass, not bothering to place it back on the bar.
He shucked off the outer layer of his dress robes while he was at it and headed towards the entrance to give it to the man who was in charge of watching the invitees’ belongings.
“Huh?” he answered eloquently, the scent still pervading his senses. He wrenched himself back from the cauldron in an attempt to clear his head and forget about the unmistakable aroma that was finally evaporating away.
“That’s not the point! You are still working yourself to the bone, even if you aren’t risking your life every other day.” Before Harry could respond, Hermione pulled out her wand and summoned a piece of paper from one of the shelves from the living area.
After a few seconds, he blinked, and his surroundings came back to view; and Harry caught the gazes of a few attendees of the meeting and immediately jolted.
Even if Draco was in the middle of writing up important paper-work for Robards, it didn’t stop the brunet from attacking with his diabolical face kisses.
It was almost entirely dark, minus a small lantern that looked virtually out on the other side of the bathrooms.
Harry enjoyed basking in the sun, wondering if he would get more freckles, but then decided to hell with it either way and forewent any sunscreen.
But every time Malfoy opened his eyes, and it was as if he knew exactly where he was in relation to him, no matter where he floated to in the pool, managing to catch his sight every time with a smirk.
Hermione and Luna began educating the room on their research, and Harry gasped. His briefs were gone, vanished more than likely knowing Draco, and Harry hadn’t realized how hard he had become from the start of Draco coming home and massaging his feet to - whatever he was planning on doing next.
, well…” she gave Harry a look that resembled pity and amusement, causing Harry to pull a hand through his unruly hair in nervousness.
Potter, however, was not one to back down from his own way. “Sorry?” But the faint pink tint on his cheeks told a different story.
Entranced, everyone watched as Malfoy danced on the table in the middle of the room in front of the fireplace, as Slytherins cat-called.
Harry had to bite his bottom lip to hold back any arguments. He frankly wasn’t in the mood to rile the other man up or vice versa. But he couldn’t help but notice the way Malfoy’s eyes were watching his mouth, enraptured as if he was waiting for an explosion to indeed happen.
Later that night they had all had their mobiles out, recording Seamus singing Dean a Celestina Warbeck classic.
Reeling back and grabbing his elbow with a tight grip, Harry exhaled a breath of air he had been holding.
“What a mess,” he croaked, while his beady eyes looked around with distaste. “Poor mistress would be so disappointed to see her house in such a state. I must go now and tend to her.”
Malfoy’s jaw ticked as he ignored him in favor of stirring, his gaze on the potion rather than Harry. Harry tried not to sulk into the cauldron for the remainder of the class as any attempts to talk to the other man went entirely out the window.
He wasn’t sure what to make of it if he was quite honest, but somewhere deep inside him. He felt like this meant something to someone. Whoever it was that was sending him all these bloody songs that was. It had to mean something real
Harry mumbled something into his pillow, and Draco slapped his arse again, this time with more sting. Harry groaned pitifully into the already damp pillow under him.
Twisting around, he bleakly registered he was standing in the middle of the dance floor, several students blatantly staring at him. Dean and Seamus were peering over at him from where they stood swaying to the music and attempting to get his attention to no avail.
Harry closed his eyes again, starting up breathing once more when he heard a terribly familiar voice. He sat up quickly, anger coursing through him at the interruption (which in hindsight might be a little over-dramatic, after all, people are allowed to have fun on a beach).
Harry let out an embarrassing snort, hiding his face in his hands to prevent Draco from seeing his reddened face.
Ron just stared blankly at him for a few moments before standing up and walking over to where they kept the cups. Everyone else thankfully was too enraptured in whatever it was Hermione was saying.
“Well, Potter, we will ask again, what do you have to say for yourself? And how are you going to fix this mess? That is,
Malfoy’s hand wrapped around his growing erection as he breathed out a puff of air through the steam of the shower.
Roddy blinked at Malfoy’s quick retort and shrugged before mixing up some blue concoction behind the bar.
The enchanted stars in the windows had been Harry's biggest disappointment. They had lasted a mere ten seconds before every single one had exploded into clouds of ash.
“What do you need? Tell me." Harry groaned as he saw Malfoy staring down at his face and his arse, where he greedily took in the plug from where he was fucking him with it.
“Your cock -- I just want to come on your cock.” He whined pitifully, moving his face to the side to take deep breaths, and Draco rubbed a hand up and down his back, soothingly, smirking to himself at his lover’s indiscretions.
"Correct, Granger." Malfoy moved his long fingers along the mantelpiece and the backrest of a turned-over chesterfield.
The redhead only shrugged as he reset his game. Harry just turned up the volume on his new song from Typhon, pulling out the massive book to Hermione’s relief, and tuning them out entirely for the remainder of the night.
She had only sighed at him in her usual put out way anytime he brought up Malfoy, which Harry only ignored every time.
Malfoy visibly huffed and turned to leave, but Harry grabbed his wrist, pleading with him with his face not to go as he sang straight to him.
That seemed to be the final straw, and Harry heard rather than saw the door open to the bathroom. He was utterly too embarrassed to look at the man, who’s clicking footsteps had halted within a few seconds of entering.
Malfoy’s eyes widened slightly before catching himself and relaxing in his usual impassive expression. Harry couldn’t help but notice the pink blush that traveled slowly up his pale neck. Harry had a strong urge to just grab Malfoy by the neck and lick…
He could stand there and stare for hours if Draco never dragged him away (after buying him three or four of the largest dildos the store sold in repentance).
Instead, he gently pressed one finger to the end of it, then pushed it a little further into Potter’s hole. Potter’s body strained, his legs shaking under the restraints, and Draco took pity on Potter and himself both as he slowly pulled the dildo all the way out, saving Potter the torture of being teased by the fullness any longer.
The odd sound was probably just some old bit of plumbing, but it didn’t deter him in the slightest from trying to figure out the mystery.
Draco began fucking him in earnest then, the dildo pistoned in and out of Harry like nothing he had ever felt in his life.
Harry gave an impressive eye-roll, a tad disappointed at her tact this time ‘round. Usually, there was more high-pitched yelling. She only scoffed at his childish petulance. “I’m serious, Harry. You can’t be going around exploding things just because you have so much pent-up steam, especially in my kitchen and around the kids.”
His breathing exercises clearly weren’t working at the moment, and his already somewhat tan skin was turning a frightening red-ish hue.
“Too right.” Ron poured himself a cup of tea and sat down beside him. “I wouldn’t even want to imagine how ragged we would have turned out if we had decided to go that route! Especially you, you don’t need all that extra stress.”
Harry felt the fleshlight’s insides tighten; this time, it was a pleasant sensation, as he quickened his pace. He bit his bottom lip, failing to hide his whimpers from escaping his throat.
Idly, he stared at the peephole in front of him, rubbing the sore spot on the back of his head, almost laughing at himself.
He grabbed his wand from the table and vanished the cock holder from Potter’s weeping erection, and the man in question sobbed aloud in apparent relief. Draco then reached out and grabbed his cock, tugging twice; when Potter erupted, the entire length of his body froze in sensations as he finally came.
He crossed his arms over his chest, outwardly wincing as his forearm rubbed up against his burnt chest.
Word must have gotten out that the Chosen One was making his debut at this particular wizarding watering hole.
The two of them had been together officially for a little over four months, and there had been no discussions of their past at all. But leave it to Harry to bring it up on Christmas Eve of all times.
He heard Malfoy gasp, as he fucked into his only for a few more seconds before coming deep inside Harry, biting down on his shoulder to barely cover his own ragged sounds.
Before Harry could even blink in surprise, Malfoy turned around on his heels, his glittering grey eyes locked onto the very spot of the peephole again, and Harry felt a sudden cold chill in his bones as the cunning bastard smirked grandly-
“Potter.” Malfoy’s shocked face transformed quickly into a look of complete rage, his knuckles white from his grip on his microphone. “Stop -”
Taking a deep breath, Harry assumed this was just part of the toy’s magic in some way. He wasn’t sure what or how yet, but he figured it was alright.
He then noticed the small table that was set up on Potter’s other side. There sat a small bowl full of...muggle condoms?
As he handed his outer robes to the gangly younger man by the front door, his heart stopped in his chest at the trio who walked in, almost dropping them in the process.
Checking the time, he realized with a put-out groan that it was already one am, and knowing how prickly Malfoy was, Harry figured he had specific times he abided by to shower, and it seemed he had missed his shot by an hour tonight.
Before Harry could deem any of that with a response, the man had stood up from his seat and straightened his shirt before he was coat on and all, standing out the door waiting for him to join.
"Too right. That would have been much too boring anyway." Harry found himself smiling at the other man, watching him as he squeezed some of the liquid on his palm. His heart began beating a little quicker at the sight. It took Harry a bit longer than he’d like to admit before he understood that Malfoy wanted him to get on the bed so he could apply the aloe himself onto Harry.
Thankfully, Harry could see the whole space of the stall as Malfoy made his round. At one point, he waved his prick around with a smirk like it was something to behold.
He watched, warily, as Potter adjusted himself against his pillows on the bed and just watched him. It was….odd.
He wasn’t even sure why he suddenly needed to do this; he knew logically; this made no sense, and it was only a coincidence that one of Typhon’s songs was playing.
Harry decided to hell with it all and laid his towel down beside Malfoy, who didn’t even bother greeting him at all, too busy with his sunbathing.
He attempted to pull away to get some semblance of control back to no avail, and the mistletoe floating ahead of him was almost taking the lead, so to speak, and stopped right before he reached Draco, causing him to halt mere inches from the blond’s surprised face.
“Roddy is hosting a party tomorrow night for Christmas if you want to stop by.” He stared at the ceiling as he said this, and Harry rolled his eyes, scooting even closer to the man in question.
Harry grabbed the wine glass from the pale man and sat it on a side table before diving back into the kiss, straddling Draco’s hips this time, wanting to plaster himself entirely to the other man.
Even the portraits didn’t seem to mind his sleuthing around; he did manage to keep his Lumos pretty low just in case he woke up some of the old sleeping sods.
They all laughed loudly at that, startling Harry and only fueling his exasperation. “What! He was clearly flustered -”
One, in particular, caught his eye, a slender body bobbing in the water, straddling a green surfboard as he waited for the perfect wave to start up.
But her words caught up to him, and he shook his head, his palms suddenly sweaty, and he put down his now empty glass on the side table.
“Mai Tai’s,” Harry corrected him with a grin of his own before blowing bubbles in the water, to Malfoy’s complete dismay.
Yet, never knowing when to quit while he was ahead, Draco leaned forward once again in his seat, ears trained on Potter in front of him.
Harry glowed at the praise; his mouth was slightly open, ready for whatever Draco was going to give him.
He glanced back towards the ocean, sipping at his drink as he watched couples walk up and down the sand together, and some folks alone, just taking in the view themselves.
The way the fabric adorned Potter’s body like they were made for him made him want to kiss his seamstresses’ feet. The lines, the colors, brought out his skin tone like nothing ever could.
Harry couldn’t formulate any words to respond before the smaller man set off back towards where they came from. He wondered if the man always flited with the people who stayed here or if Harry had a bright sign over his head that read 'In dire need of a good pounding.' Either way, he didn't mind the attention.
Harry swiftly turned his head to Smith, glaring in disapproval, his eyes narrowed, before swinging his head back to the stage, giving Malfoy all his attention. Not that he hadn’t been before...
“Yeah, well,” Harry eyed the few papers he put in a small pile on his desk, “I was going to look through some cases.”
It wouldn’t do much good. Harry figured McGonagall herself could catch him in the act of watching Malfoy jerk off, and he would still watch for as long as he could manage before being dragged away to detention.
“He’s the one hosting the party, Potter. No need to be so like that about it.” Malfoy answered, with a smirk etched on his face, still facing the ceiling, but running a thumb over Harry’s side, “And he’s a friend who gives me free alcohol on occasion.”
Swallowing, he nodded, so utterly enchanted by the other to the point that he wasn’t sure if he could wield a coherent sentence together.
He had a black cloth blindfold covering his eyes, wrapped around his head, and knotted at the back. His mouth was open, a substantial o-ring gag forcing his mouth open.
His usually pointy and pale face was - well, still sharp as ever -but his cheeks were adorned with pink spots, and his eyes were a mix of mischievous and tipsy as he laughed infectiously.
Potter’s head snapped up, and Draco felt his blood run cold. He almost wanted to double-check that the blindfold was working, with the way that Potter’s face was just...there. Staring him down, unnervingly.
Draco wrapped his scarf around his neck once more and helped Harry into his coat before ushering them out the door and back into the blisteringly cold wind outside. But somehow, the wind didn’t feel as cold to Draco as it had before.
Malfoy’s eyes caught Harry’s as soon as his “date” wrapped an arm around him in his seat possessively as he sat down. Harry immediately flinched away, feeling somewhat resentful towards Smith for ruining what could have been a moment.
The room was utterly silent then, and Harry pursed his lips as his eyes drifted slowly up to the bloody mistletoe in question, where it still hung perfectly between himself and Draco.
Harry thought about why he was feeling the way he had been for the past few months, and the more Harry pondered it, the more he didn’t want to think about it any further and the urge to summon a bottle of Ogden’s from downstairs and hide away in his room became more of a pleasing idea instead.
Taking that order to scram, Harry nodded his thanks, grabbed his crinkled notes and broken quill, and pushed back through the other side of the Floo.
Zacharias made his loud return back to the table, complaining about the lack of hygiene in the bathroom, which Harry found hilarious with how he had just been scarfing down three-day-old cheese fries and getting it everywhere in the process.
“I might have,” Draco mused, lifting a hand to stroke his chin as if he was an evil villain in the plot, thinking up his dastardly plan.
Harry stiffened as Malfoy stepped closer behind him, bringing the pleasant scent he had just previously been acquainted with for so long.
Harry stared at the sand, grinding his teeth for a split second before back-tracking back towards the tiki hut. Malfoy was standing out like a sore thumb as he leaned oh so casually against the bar top in his way too short swimming trunks.
need to earn its respect. There is no point in me giving Kreacher the orders. It needs to come from you if you want these attacks on your attempts at
Then again, Harry wasn’t even sure if he was any different himself. It wasn’t like he was taking initiatives to go up on stages and sing his heart out to crowds or wear tight leather trousers that show far more than he would be comfortable with.
He raised a hand and pulled Draco’s cock out of its confines, sighing in pleasure at the look of it, almost as if it was perfectly tailored for him. Not too girthy, but plenty long enough.
"The Chosen One himself," Draco said, raising an eyebrow in his direction. "I was just about to swallow my first Firewhisky of the festive season when I was rudely called away from Zabini’s Christmas party. Still, it shouldn't be too difficult to put pay to this little problem. Potter, could you give me a rundown of the phenomenon you've witnessed?"
“Of course. We wouldn’t want to offend any impressionable eyes...even though,” Malfoy made it a point to look around him in the pool area before looking back up at Iain, his expression blank, "I am not seeing any young families around."
Malfoy looked up, unconcerned as Harry finished his coughing fit. “I would much rather you wait until after our study sessions are complete before dying on me, Potter. I’d hate to have your death on my record.”
When the last hour was up, he slammed the previous book shut and turned back to his music, clearly offending Madam Pince.
Glancing around frantically at the table, he spotted a shot of Ogden’s that Seamus hadn’t taken yet and snatched it up, to the complaints of his friend. He downed it in one go and jumped from the table, made his way back towards the stage where Malfoy was standing there in all his glory, singing
He followed Potter out the door to the courtyard, thankfully empty of others, for the time being, taking the opportunity to admire the way his robes outlined his hips as they slightly swayed, his trousers cradled his arse so lovingly in the back.
Harry pulled Draco into a heated kiss, stopping him mid-rant, and turned to face him, one leg wrapped around him - as Draco took the hint and scooped him up, vanishing his trousers, allowing Harry to encircle him completely.
Malfoy only tsked at him, smirking as he ran a finger over the plug, the metal glittering in the low lights of the room almost as much as Malfoy's eyes. "Take your shorts off.”
A few minutes passed, Draco straining his ears to hear the sexy drawls in front of him. There were a few times when Potter would stop, write something down with his quill, turn a page of his book, then get right back at it again, unknowingly torturing Draco.
Kingsley nodded his head, and Harry would’ve chuckled at his best friend’s pout. Apparently, his wife had not made him privy to the full schedule she had planned.
Was it just him, or did the Slytherin was staring fixedly right at Harry from the other side of the wall, almost as if he could see through the stone?
The haggard man and Mrs. Norris both looked around for a second, then started their way down the rest of the other hallway, and Harry breathed a sigh of relief.
Once they were seated, Draco couldn’t help but be drawn to Harry’s aura, even though he was trying his damnedest to stay a bit away from him. As hard as Draco tried to build up his walls, his boyfriend always had an uncanny ability to see through him, even from the get-go of their relationship.
But Draco only sighed before looking back down at his book, reading the words without processing them, nor did he
Harry stared at the man as he poured him another drink, something about the man's tone of voice set him off and he immediately straightened in his seat, “You uh...didn’t miss the moment when Malfoy told you we were mortal enemies back in the day, right?”
This time, it was Harry’s mouth that fell open in shock, as he shook his head in disbelief. The only sounds that could be heard were the quiet chatter of folks leaving the shops around them and the light wind that had calmed down considerably since they made their way back outside.
“Just imagine what an ‘I’m so sorry, Harry, for all the torment I put you through the years’ could get you.” Potter rubbed his hips against Draco’s deliciously, and he almost lost his mind at the obvious arousal he was feeling from the other man.
“I - I thought, I thought that you were going to break up with me?” Draco asked, more timidly than he would have liked, but it was too late now.
He had read up on that particular name, per Hermione’s suggestion early on. But nothing came up of interest or any specific meaning. To his dismay, he couldn’t even find any other languages where the name appeared, even after spending an extra three hours in the library.
“You and your partner will work together to create the perfect Amortentia potion. Once complete, you will turn it in, and it will prove to be half of your N.E.W.T. score.”
“Fuck, you beg so beautifully. Listen to yourself.” Malfoy pushed all the way inside, licking a stripe up his neck at that before biting down; Harry begged again only louder.
Hermione let out a long-suffering sigh as she grabbed the paper and waved it at the morose man at the kitchen table. “An early Christmas present from Ron and me.”
Humming in thought, Draco turned to walk past Potter towards the exit in case he needed to make a hasty getaway when he felt a hand come up to stop him, lightly holding him back on his chest.
The Gryffindors walked down, tickled the pear, and got their snacks, and Ron had to remind Harry to cool it -  the food wasn’t going to disappear, and they should have enough treacle tart to share without him needing to stuff all of it down his throat at once.
Malfoy looked at him, his grey eyes giving him that same curiously intense look, similar to the one from the first karaoke night.
Instead of deeming that with a response, Harry walked toward his bedroom, his heart pounding as he opened his mouth to call back to Draco. “If you’re too tired to Floo home, you can sleep here.”
As a matter of fact, Draco would hardly mention Justin at all around Harry. And it became somewhat of an odd subject when anyone brought him up around Harry.
But Malfoy’s grey, calculating ones were still stuck to Harry, almost reminding Harry of Second Year at the dueling club, the fiery expression echoing from back then.
Draco couldn’t hold back anymore, not with Potter lying underneath him, entirely under his disposal and writhing on his cock. He gently pulled out, practically all the way, before slamming back in, his hands holding onto Potter’s bound thighs for dear life.
By the time he was re-orientated with his left eye peeking through, Malfoy had moved under the shower water, and Harry could see the stress from the day melt off his body as the hot water hit him, and almost like a Pavlovian response, he felt lighter too.
Draco was observing him from the side, and Harry felt himself heat up. Then the blond took the conversation in such a direction, Harry was sure he had whiplash from it.
“Me! I’m your Christmas present. And look no further, because I am the most perfect present anyone could ever ask for.”
Harry’s eyes practically rolled to the back of his head in response to the praise, his speed increasing as Draco’s thrusts became a tad faster and more aggressive, Harry’s eyes watering from being used in such a way.
He watched as Harry’s back arched, and he was coming suddenly, all over himself, and Draco let out his own groan as his orgasm ripped through him.
Harry’s breath caught as he watched Malfoy look his way directly with those glistening grey eyes from his karaoke throne and
“Potter - ” and bless Kingsley for interrupting her, “- just hang tight for a few more minutes, we are almost finished here. And you’ll be free to go back to your vacation. Now Granger, what I was thinking for next steps here -”
He brought a hand up, stroking slowly up and down the length, getting a proper feel at first. He watched, mesmerized at the precum that was inching down his length, dripping onto Harry’s fingers. Harry immediately brought his hand to his mouth and sucked, eyeing Draco the whole time, and smirked as his eyes darkened incredibly so at that.
"Harry!" Hermione exclaimed, clearly outraged at the suggestion. "Why would he deliberately curse the house he loves? Seriously."
Harry unwillingly would then stash his phone away, feeling the warmth of it through the pocket of his robe, his hands itching to grab it again and hide under the table to check for any new messages.
The room was eerily silent for a few seconds before Harry looked over to Luna and the rest, and then conversations started anew slowly.
That should not be as hot as it was, but with Malfoy standing behind him, literally a few inches taller than him, looking down as his cock fucks his own fleshlight, was enough to finish Harry off.
He was slightly disappointed when his knees hit the stone, indicating no more room to get closer to the scene before him.
Draco’s mouth had fallen open at some point in Harry’s little heartfelt speech of his, and he could feel his whole body shaking with an undetermined emotion he couldn’t control.
He looked around. The tree must have snagged her frame and took the painting down with it. Kreacher was always moving her around to different spots in the house, ignoring Harry’s complaints each time he did so. “Mistress would like to see the Christmas decorations. Kreacher will move her every day, so she stays in the Christmas spirit", Kreacher had just explained to Harry yesterday.
“As much as I would love to continue whatever I am sure is a riveting conversation, I must, regrettably, change the subject.”
Granger was the first to catch on, obviously, and jerked her head once, giving Harry a brief look that conveyed an emotion Draco couldn’t pan down.
As he looked closer, Harry realized the indentation was a small entrance to a dark hallway that seemed to go on for a bit.
“Green,” Harry answered quickly, his heart pumping widely in his chest that the man had enough mind and heart to ask anyway.
“Yes.” Draco leaned down slightly to kiss Harry on his beanie covered head, reaching up to stick a tuft of hair that was falling out from it. “I know I have made my amends to your friends. But I uh - haven’t really to you. And I apologize for that.” Draco swallowed heavily, holding back any disgusting emotions until this was over.
Harry raised an eyebrow of his own in retaliation, knowing full and well it wasn’t as articulately and gracefully done as Malfoy himself.
He pushed in a bit and pulled out a tad quicker this time, but once more found himself...not able to pull completely out.
He moaned wantonly, pressing up even more towards the man above him, wordlessly asking for more, and Malfoy seemed to be in a giving mood then.
Harry watched as Malfoy then ran a hand down his chest, rubbing at his nipples and biting back a louder groan at that. Harry almost wished he hadn’t, wanting to hear it all.
Malfoy walked to the bathroom in silence. Harry sat up as he heard the water running from the sink for a few minutes before the other man walked back in, drying his hands on a towel that he then threw at Harry, who grunted in annoyance.
Even though Draco clearly couldn’t begin to comprehend what the other was saying, he knew what he was alluding to if the small, tentative thrusts against his thigh were of any indication.
The moment had passed: even though Harry wanted to rewind the last five seconds and give him a better compliment, or an
There was a loud whooshing sound and a tinkling of glass. Lots of glass. Harry shot up from the rug to take in his living room. The tree was upright with all its decorations repaired and back on its branches. The broken Chinese vases, the cracked portraits and figurines from the mantelpiece – all that had previously resisted all Reparo Charms was now fixed and in their rightful places. Harry couldn't believe his eyes but even Aunt Walburga's portrait had returned and hung - SILENTLY - on the wall.
Harry had managed to set up a few Christmas decorations here and there by Luna’s request, and she brought some extras to add as well, but he clearly remembered that there was
He had hoped it would be a bit longer before Draco had to be in Potter’s company once again, but here they were. He carefully watched the crowds shuffling around, no sign of him or his comrades anywhere.
Over the threshold, he slowly stepped into what looked to be a singular hallway, the wood under his feet creaking with each step he took. There was hardly any light to guide his way. Pulling out his wand, he muttered a quick
“Aw, look, babe, it wants us to kiss!” Justin beamed at his boyfriend as he looked from the mistletoe to Draco, who in turn looked quite a bit paler than usual.
Draco looked his boyfriend’s way with a look of desperation, and Justin, the poor sod, just nodded, giving his consent for it to happen.
Draco gave up on any semblance of holding back as he leaned down and ran his tongue over each nipple, paying close attention to lavish each one delicately. He doubted anyone before him had done so and who knows how long Potter had been in this position.
“Merry Christmas to you too, Mr. Potter,” Clifford muttered, waving his wand to clear the mess of paperwork that was strewn on the ground thanks to Harry’s carelessness.
His legs working once more, Harry sat up and rubbed at his knees, his legs still shaking from his otherworldly orgasm Draco wrung from him.
Which, now that he thought about it, was pretty pathetic. Draco was his friend, and he had known him before Justin ever came into the picture.
As he finished his drink, he imagined how Potter would look on his black, satin sheets back in his bedroom; the candles lit just enough for Draco to make out the sinfully debauched face as he begged for him to -
working with Malfoy after his little incident in his bed a few weeks prior, but he has felt... tense.
Parkinson managed to look somewhat sheepish. “Well, Draco doesn’t like it when we get involved in his personal life. And acts like a petulant child whenever we do. There’s nothing to be done about it.”
It was only when he was sitting in the taxi on the way to the hotel that he realized he had forgotten his wand entirely in the first place and tried not to panic too much. But after practically scaring the poor Muggle taxi driver into a tizzy as he rummaged in his bags countless times to make sure, he figured he wouldn’t need it anyway...
Rather than holding out on himself, Harry thought it’d be best if tonight he wanked this time with Malfoy. Not like it would hurt anyone or anything for that matter.
Harry bottled up the argument that was forming on the tip of his tongue as he looked back up at the happy couple before him. His best mates’ genuinely hopeful expressions were hard to stay angry at or quarrel over.
He noticed the man’s cock was at full attention, and Draco could almost see it bounce in anticipation from where he stood. It didn’t look like he was coming anytime soon, however, as there looked to be some sort of metal cock ring wrapped all the way around the poor sod’s prick, preventing him from coming.
“I’m not a fool Draco, I know we both have our fair share of issues. Past and present.” Harry’s side of his mouth upturned at that, “But I have never forgiven myself for cursing you that night.”
Potter huffed a laugh at that. “Oh, so you think this was all an incredible scheme of mine to get you in my bed?”
But deep down, Harry knew this wasn’t some random young girl with a silly crush. These lyrics were too thoughtful for that.
Harry noticed how Malfoy took in that sight before him as he emptied his drink at an alarming rate. Looking somewhat put-out at the fact that the bartender didn’t have time for his flirtations, Draco then sighed into his almost empty, obscenely red-tinted drink. “Yes, quite.”
Draco had to stop himself or else ram right into Potter, as he hadn’t been paying attention in the slightest to when he had stopped walking. “So erm - how have you been?”
On the other hand, Weasley looked as though he was falling asleep at the sodding table, no less! Draco expected nothing more from the red-head, but still. Their N.E.W.T.S. were rapidly getting closer, and if he didn’t pull himself together, he was not going to get anything better than a P.
When Hermione gave him another one of her side-eyes, he realized it looked a bit off.  “Harry, do you need some Pepper-Up? You’re looking a bit peaked.”
Potter’s vivid green met his icy grey, and Draco was reminded of how glassy they had looked in class. Not as clear or focused as they did now. “Funny story about that. But maybe for another time?”
He heard a seagull outside squawk and rolled off the bed to take his first peek outside the wall-length windows, after which he immediately ran to his luggage, pulled out a pair of trunks, and got dressed, grabbed his bag, and headed straight down to the ocean.
Harry only shook his head in disbelief, biting his bottom lip in amusement before airly replying, “Oh, right! Remind me again, who was the one sending songs behind a mask all year? Songs that, more or less, professed love to the other? The other being me in this scenario.”
“Oh, don’t give me that Draco love. Go on and find someone’s mouth to suck on. I haven’t given up quite yet.”
He extended his arm as far as he could reach for the soaps, the tips of his calloused fingers barely grazing the soap bottle he was aiming for before it knocked over, causing a domino effect to occur and sending five other bottles careening to the shower’s wet floor with several bangs.
He blamed his boyfriend, who took it upon himself to cuddle up to him as they made their way through the snow towards their house, for that one.
Two months passed since the incident in Knockturn Alley, but seeing Potter in the flesh, dressed to the nines as he smiled softly at something Weasley said next to him, brought all those memories back in one swoop.
The Slytherin threw his head back, baring his pale neck as he came all over the man on the ground in front of him.
Seamus’s mouth that had been open ready to either cat-call again or laugh his arse off, promptly froze in place as Malfoy began to swing his hips to the beat and croon the first verse of the song.
The idea of doing the same now tastes less sweet and much more bitter and nasty. Harry was too tired from last year; the emotions were flying high, and still are to an extent.
-- Draco thought, maddeningly struck with the knowledge that he was going to tip over the edge soon. Potter’s illegal voice suddenly sounded deeper and gravelly, almost as if Potter was intentionally doing this to him, the sounds coming from the back of his throat.
A few seconds passed, Harry sipping lightly at the drink, noting with fondness that Malfoy must have charmed the glass into something else when he wasn’t looking because he now tasted his familiar go to firewhiskey.
After stepping over a shirtless Neville, Harry climbed the steps to his dorm, warm but not quite sloshed. A sense of euphoria washed over him as he climbed into bed, grinning like a fool from the night’s festivities, happy at how different the night ended up than how he had expected. Even though he hadn’t found Typhon in the crowd earlier.
Pureblood niceties and all that sometimes still rang true with him, no matter how many times Harry tried to loosen him up on it.
Malfoy opened his eyes from where he was starting to layout again, floating on the water as Harry floated beside him. His grey eyes found him immediately, staring at Harry in clear contemplation as if he was mulling something over in his head.
Draco sighed again as the snow crunched under his feet. He saw Harry glance at him from the corner of his eye and felt his hand tighten around his.
Half the party decided against it as Charlie never disclosed what precisely the ‘substance’ was, which was fine by Harry, leaving more for him.
, currently moving one of his clever hands down his chest, getting closer to the waist of his swim trunks.
For one thing, Draco could still feel the uncomfortable stickiness staining his trousers, which wasn’t the most fun feeling in the world, but he managed it enough. Every step was just another reminder of what just occurred in class, and Draco’s fingers tightened on his books in his hands at the memory.
He wasn’t exactly sure what he was expecting to gaze upon at that moment, perhaps some old forgotten books in a dusty forgotten classroom, or maybe even some brooms he could hijack for Quidditch.
Seamus had some sort of electronic contraption that Harry could plug his mobile into so that he could play the songs on a speaker with no magic. They were a bit hesitant at first, but after a test run and practically blowing their eardrums out from playing a song on full blast, Harry had complete faith in their setup.
Draco had met him once at the Ministry's Annual Ball last spring, and he came across as nice enough. He remembered a specific moment that evening, when Draco placed a light hand on Potter’s back, whispering about the lady in accounting and her newest attempt at wooing him with zero luck.
“This isn’t good for your health, Harry. You can’t be working yourself dry and not taking time for yourself. Just the other day, Rose asked me what was wrong with Uncle Harry.”
“Here,” Malfoy shoved a bottle of clear looking liquid into Harry’s hands. “This is for your awful skin. It’s a Muggle remedy. Rodrick showed it to me once.”
Harry stared, fascinated as Malfoy grabbed the mic off the stand at one point and belted out a long note to end the song before bowing to the crowd - some of which had decided to flock in front of the stage, and Harry could have sworn he saw a girl try to reach out and grab the sod.
“He always wanted to do things like that - push my boundaries. I never truly liked the idea of other people watching - even if the other person was him. It was only when I found out he had been fucking other people behind my back that I broke things off.”
He had a feeling that whoever Typhon was, he was angry with Harry for something. Or he was bored with him.
“Onions have layers, and so do you, and I would like very much to get to know those...layers…on an intimate level.”
Justin nodded after a few more seconds and leaned in to kiss Draco goodbye before turning around and leaving, no words said to Harry in the process.
Draco got a sick thrill at Potter’s expression as it changed from relaxed to immediately turning a dark shade of pink. It boded well with his darker skin tone, he noted internally.
“I mean, you have been looking down and out lately,” the redhead continued, “Do I need to speak with George about working you too much?”
He allowed Draco to see him in such a state of need, his skin splotched with reds and pinks, his hitched breaths, those green eyes, usually so bright and alert, glazed over as he gazed up at Draco, as if he was the answer to all his wishes.
“He should have known better, but…” Potter hesitated and bit his lip as if he wasn’t sure if he should continue. Draco’s hand twitched with the urge to reach out to touch him.
Draco made a strangled sound above him and thrust hard a few more times before pulling out quickly, and Harry gasped, watching as Draco shattered.
“FILTHY HALF-BREED!” came the mangled screech from Aunt Walburga, whose portrait was lying on the ground faced down. Harry could practically see the frame shaking with anger from being toppled down.
As Harry felt one of Draco’s hands reach up and caress his arm, he wanted nothing more than to make the most of this short moment and reached with his other hand to grab at Draco’s long sleeve, pulling him a tad bit closer, when real life came back with a metaphorical punch to his face.
“Thank you for granting Harry with what I’m sure was excellent company- but it seems your time has run out.”
The walk back to the common rooms was going to be interesting. Harry only hoped he would make it before he exploded.
Harry hummed as he ran his fingernails lightly on his head. He turned around to face the shower-head, his eyes closed, to rinse out the shampoo. Harry didn’t want to spend
Harry helped Ron carry them, trying to calm his shaking hands to no avail.  By the time he made it to the table Neville’s drink ended up halfway empty.
Humming in approval around him, and the vibration must’ve felt incredible for Draco, as he was jerking his hips in tandem to Harry’s mouth, slowly fucking up into him.
Malfoy was trying to get his wits about him, and Harry could have sworn he heard him mutter something along the lines of: “Bloody hell...Potter doesn’t know his magical strength....” before sleep overtook him.
At that, Harry pushed his elbows into the floor where they touched to prevent his upper body from moving from the force of Draco’s thrusts from behind him. But he stayed firm, and stock still on his end, watching intently at the time in the corner as it slowly ran down.
It didn’t help that Typhon hadn’t sent any more songs his way for the past week. At one point, Harry had gotten so desperate that he almost sent one back to him, but he figured it was pointless.
He pushed inside a few inches before pulling out and pushed back a few more before pulling out again. And kept the process up until he was fully snug inside Harry.
With that thought in mind, he figured it was as good a time as any to head back to the common room and forget the past week happened, especially tonight’s activities.
, Malfoy was clearly done with the conversation as he forcefully wrote in his notebook, his quill practically ripping through the paper.
On instinct alone, Draco reached up and grabbed the tuft of Potter’s hair, rearing his head back. Draco could pinpoint the exact moment when Potter started to fall into his subspace.
Not that he expected anything different in this situation…but just having Draco standing here vehemently trying to get out of a little kiss was affecting him more than he thought it would.
Hermione. Just on the bloody ground, taking notes. Listening in on this meeting. What else do you want from me?”
But, if this was to be the only time he could lay his hands on Potter, relieve the ache he had carried for so long, make him come,
Harry yawned with a grin on his face, nestling closer into the man’s chest with a soft sigh. “So that means you're staying the night, yeah?”
Suddenly, he was immensely grateful for his insightfulness to take off a layer, as he already started to sweat at the thought of Potter being here.
He would much rather spend the night whinging about Typhon and listening to his playlist on repeat, but the last time he spoke to Ron about it, Ron actually looked like he might hex him, so Harry figured all his friends were at their wits end with him.
Behind the lube, seemingly forgotten about, was a small black frame. Draco shuffled closer to it and saw that it was a list, written in gold ink and titled: “Rules:”
Draco started to take his hand back from where it was still touching Harry’s chest, but being a tad quicker, Harry grabbed it before he could manage it.
But he had Malfoy to attend to for the present time. He sighed and made his way up to his room, the blond following him.
He had his fill and needed to get as far away from Malfoy and his amazing cock and spectacular body as he could and never mention his escapades to anyone ever.
Thankfully, he and Ron had Hermione to help them out through the original muggle technology barriers from the get-go. Eventually, all the students at Hogwarts were on their phones non-stop. Harry often had to stop some of the younger years from running right into him in the halls from not paying attention to where they were walking, too enamored with their handheld devices.
Green eyes looked back at him at that; mouth opened in a mixture of shock and pleasure, as he shuddered, feeling a new sensation all of a sudden.
Good thing he could always count on Malfoy to be a dependable partner, knowing exactly what he needed almost at every second in any mission they are ever on together, without him having to say anything most times.
Harry was currently going through all the possible ways Malfoy could have tracked him here in his mind. Perhaps Malfoy had been stalking him since that last New Year’s party at Luna’s; he had seemed pretty inebriated…
; his reading glasses perched on his nose in a way that made Harry want to strip the man of everything but those damn glasses.
Under the caveats of a hot shower, along with some of his old Ogden’s, Harry knew he kept for special occasions.
“And I think they’re right. I owe it to him. At first, I thought he was embarrassed about the whole thing, but speaking with them, he’s apparently just angry. More so about our fight that happened a week ago.”
Ron looked back and forth between his mates with a growing look of exasperation. “What are you two going on about? Do you -” He looked straight at Harry, a bit green around the gills when he asked,
Harry scoffed, but something inside his chest sang from the fact that this was Malfoy, the same prat who sang his heart out on stage, giving Harry his full attention. It was much different than him up in front of crowds, where everyone could see him and watch, mystified.
In the middle of writing his findings, his grip on his quill tightened. He hadn’t realized it had broken in half until the ink on his fingers dripped onto his paper.
He bristled after his umpteenth time checking on the Slytherins. He felt as though Malfoy knew he was watching him if his ever-growing smirk was any tell.
Sighing and trying to hold back his grimace of pain from his sunburn, he nodded to the man as they both ended up at some thrifty looking store. On the inside, folks could come in, buy anything from fishing equipment and knee-boards to mugs and keychains, as well as shirts and shoes with the resort’s name embroidered on them. Harry picked up a mug for Ron and a book about dolphins for Hermione.
Moving more quickly than he would have typically done for their first time (and the fact that he has ideas for times after this should have given Draco pause), he backed Harry up into a wall, a tremor of excitement ran through him at the sight of Potter willingly being pushed and handled.
Draco blinked once, then again, clearly coming back to himself. But that same soft look in his eyes was still there as he gazed openly down at Harry, making his heart pound twice as fast as usual.
As soon as his body disappeared around the staircases, Harry quickly pulled the cloak over his head. He then spelled a silence spell onto his shoes to prevent any more Filch incidents like last night; before briskly making a turn out of the common room entrance and straight to where the alcove was.
“I do appreciate you having faith in me, however.” The man’s grey eyes gleamed with delight. Harry wanted to bang his head against the bar top.
him, perhaps? Someone who had a romantic relationship with him in the past and was trying to get back in his arms?
“So, Amortentia. Easy enough.” Malfoy organized all the notes in front of him on the bed into one stack. “We will need to find the ingredients, which shouldn’t be too much of a bother.”
Seamus still hadn’t shut up about that first night when they saw him months ago. Harry had to threaten to hex his bollocks off on the way over when Seamus kept asking everyone to sit at the table closest to the stage.
Harry hummed, not answering verbally as he knew he would only make a quip about how awful Eric’s hairline was or his stupid loud shoes he always wore. He wasn’t sure why Draco always does this, brings up old flames to Harry as if he particularly wanted to hear about them.
of all people. He must have gotten up from his spot in the corner with the other Slytherins during Harry and Hermione’s talk.
“You have quite the magical energy during sex, Potter. You almost caused the windows to explode earlier. I’ll just take that as a compliment.”
The professors must have transfigured it. It gave way to an archway and a beautiful look at the Hogwarts grounds.
, Harry turned to see what the new and empty hallway offered, and it seemed to lead towards the direction of the common rooms, so he figured
Harry began taking studious notes immediately as Kingsley began his introductory statements. He had gotten onto Harry about his lack of notes in the past, and Harry decided then to get a good chunk in within the first ten minutes of the meeting. That gave him ample opportunity to be able to drift off into his train of thought with no worries for the remainder of the time.
The Minister nodded, and O’Brien continued with his concerns on the subject matter of the meeting. That matter being - well, Harry now couldn’t tell you if someone asked him at wand point. The last five minutes of this blasted meeting had gone thoroughly over his head thanks to his boyfriend’s sinful antics.
The music started intensely, but Malfoy seemed to know all the words by heart as he sang out into the microphone strong and sure, not missing a single beat. Harry was pretty sure his jaw had dropped down to the table, but there was no way he was moving an inch.
It took one final unconscious magical outburst at the dinner table in front of the children for her to charm Harry’s arse to his chair and have the conversation he had been actively avoiding, to no avail, for years now.
As if Malfoy losing his fucking mind (and being a wicked singer to boot), Typhon, and studying for the N.E.W.T.S. weren’t enough to drive Harry mad this year. Nope. McGonagall thought it prudent to have another ‘ball’ type dance to promote ‘inter-house cooperation and friendship.’
“Oh? Is that so— ?” He couldn’t even get out the rest of his retort before Potter attacked his mouth with more enthusiasm than Draco can remember seeing the man direct towards anything else  in his life before. His lips were chapped, but he made up for it by sneaking his tongue inside his mouth, and Draco sucked in a breath as the kiss deepened quicker than he anticipated.
He eyed the elaborate cock ring still wrapped around Potter’s perfect cock, and hated it. Thinking about all the things he could do with it without the metal contraption on him had his mind whirling.
A few patrons sat at the bar, nursing what looked to be somewhat fruity concoctions, their wet bums plastered to the seats as they took a break from the sun and the water.
“Slytherins are a loyal bunch and wouldn’t say anything the other wouldn’t want out. They were annoyingly close-mouthed about certain...things.”
Once the words finally caught up to him, Draco grinned lightly down at the crumpled paper, and embarrassment subsided for the time being.
As he searched in their colorful collection of toys, Draco’s lips upturned in a smirk when he saw his newest purchase hiding below their usual go-to’s. One that he hadn’t been able to share with Harry yet.
“No, thanks.” Harry spat, throwing a wad of money at Roddy before heading back to his beach chair, moving it another ten feet away from where Malfoy was when he got back, just in case.
Slowly, he turned back around to face the fleshlight and swallowed, feeling sweaty even under the shower water. He then looked out of the shower door, wiping the steam off and peering out to make sure no one was there, watching.
"Young Master and the Mud– er, and Young Master's guest may want to stop defiling Mistress's precious tea service and see what happened to the Yule tree." He vanished, without even waiting for Harry's answer.
Great start to a relaxing break, he thought dryly to himself, as he watched the cars pass outside the taxi window, a few palm trees scattered around proving that they were close to whatever resort Hermione booked for him.
Draco pulled away slightly, raising an eyebrow as Harry stood shakily up from his knees. “I kind of already, erm-”
Draco hummed in thought, and his grey eyes got a glint about them as he remembered what Harry was talking about. “Oh, yes! That was quite an excellent toy. Even though I already had the newer one in that line, which is much softer in my opinion.”
It also was a way to keep Harry himself from jumping up and down in pure joy. “I agree. I feel like we may have been a pair of idiots.”
“One thing you ought to know, Potter, is that Malfoys never apologize. So take this as a one-time thing only.”
He barely noticed Professor McGonagall staring at him oddly from her perch as he swept the floor, witlessly scanning the room for the person he needed to find in that very moment.
“Listen, Potty. We don’t quite understand what has gone through Draco’s head this year. At first, we thought it was all a farce. Some joke or laugh at your expense.”
Harry then walked to the side of the room, ignoring the odd stares, and opening a door that led through a narrow hallway and outside onto a courtyard of sorts that Harry never remembered being there before.
He didn’t know why he said it, and Harry immediately regretted it as soon as he saw Malfoy’s expression of disbelief marring his face. He smoothed it out quickly into one of indifference. But he twisted until he faced Harry on the bed.
"Did you get the tree from Hagrid?", Hermione whispered. She had come up from the kitchen right behind Harry.
The images transformed into more of Malfoy on stage, letting out soft croons into the mic or the way his eyes blazed every time he looked Harry’s way this year.
Harry bit back a surprised curse as the elf appeared out of nowhere again, glaring down at Kreacher. But Kreacher ignored Harry and instead stared up at Malfoy with wide eyes as if he himself hung up the moon.
With what he was sure was a bewildered look he gave Potter, Draco blindly reached for his quill, pretending to write down some notes as if he hadn’t just come in his trousers like a thirteen-year-old again.
He knew about the secret passage to Hogsmeade already, obviously, so he skipped over that one. He did remember Fred and George once explaining to him where a few others were hidden away, even a few that didn’t show up on the map, so he spent his first few weeks exploring those.
Harry was frozen in place as the water kept falling from the shower. The water had rinsed all the shampoo from his hair at this point; as water droplets ran down his face, Harry blinked, studying the cock sheath intently.
An image of them both in Draco’s lavish bath back home entered his mind then, Draco cleaning Potter up, cleaning any remnants of any other person’s touch on him and marking him his own.
Either that or risk hearing them go at it, which was not on his list of to-dos for his last year at Hogwarts, thank you very much.
“So are we going to make this an every Christmas event, us meeting up and snogging, or fucking then leaving each other high and dry? We are two years strong, after all now.”
A small box sat on top of Malfoy’s other table in his room, and unconsciously, Harry stood up and knelt in front of the contraption to get a better look, hoping Malfoy wouldn’t stab him with his angry quill.
Draco was in Potions class when it happened. It had been a typical, dull day at Hogwarts. The type of day Draco had come to expect.
Harry pushed against the hold but widened his eyes in the realization that he couldn't move his hands at all, even after Malfoy let them go.
He knew he was acting ridiculously - this person, whoever they were, was probably having him on. Having a good laugh at his expense, no doubt, right at this moment as they watched him flounder around in the middle of the ballroom.
Potter moved his thigh in-between Draco’s legs and ground down, his cock rubbing indecently against Draco’s leather-clad trousers.
He came with long stripes all over his chest, his mouth open in a low groan as his orgasm ripped through him.
Through the small crack in the wall, his eye immediately caught sight of Malfoy’s usual pinched and sullen face giving way to one slack with pleasure, his cheeks pink from the heat of the water raining down, and Harry’s throat clicked as he tried to swallow again.
Potter groaned in the kiss and began his perfectly timed thrusts against Draco’s own now weeping erection.
“Oh, this? Yeah, I uh...am really quite intrigued by the uh - Romans. And the Greeks. And their history.”
Harry played for a while but then made some excuse to get some peace and quiet and sat on the steps outside the door.
He then slowly worked his cock from the base, all the way up to the tip with a twist at the end, as more quiet moans started pouring out of his soft pink mouth.
But Malfoy looked like he wanted to hex him to bits, and Harry impulsively reached for his wand under his robes.
One of Iain’s eye twitched but nodded shortly and went off before Harry could ask for anything, apologize for the Slytherin's behavior, or desperately explain to his only hope of getting laid in the next week and a half that Malfoy wasn’t his boyfriend and that they weren't...like that.
Harry clenched hard around their fingers, and Malfoy slapped him on the arse. “Brat,” Malfoy called him almost affectionately.
Harry sang to Malfoy earnestly, smiling shakily as he walked one step closer to him, surprised his legs hadn’t entirely given out on him yet.
Even a few times, Draco had to give one of the men who worked there the side-eye when they got too close to his boyfriend, eyeing Harry like some piece of meat he would like to bite into.
He was always this way, Draco concluded after being in a relationship with the man for the past few years and always going headfirst into everything in life as if it would be his last time.
Harry could feel himself about to combust, as he felt Draco’s hot and insistent mouth kiss and lick his back, his thrusts teetering on edge, and Harry knew that feeling, and knew he was close to coming himself.
He watched as water rained down on his cock as well, and wondered what was shower water versus precum that was making Malfoy’s dick glisten like that.
Harry wondered how it would feel, receiving that treatment from him. He was a few inches shorter than Malfoy, and he figured they would fit well together. He could easily imagine himself standing in front of him, Malfoy massaging his ridiculously expensive hair products into his wet hair, fingertips grazing his neck.
His mystery sender was so abhorrently offended by Seamus’s choice of song he sent that he sent Harry back three songs in a row, all with lyrics of how stupid and ridiculously pigheaded he was.
“It reads the room. The mistletoe, with the help of the nargles, of course,” Luna chimed in again with a broad smile. “So once you two kiss, it should leave you alone since its job would be completed.”
They all laughed heartily at that and drank deeply before falling into a conversation about the Quidditch teams at Hogwarts this year.
A few more seconds passed as Harry stared down at the man lying partially on him, the moon coming through the windows and shining on his pale back beautifully.
“Yes, we gathered.” Hermione quipped, her eyes nothing but kind towards him now, which he appreciated more than she knew, as she sat delicately down on the loveseat right next to Ron, across from Harry.
Letting out a long breath of satisfaction as the water hit his face and washed the lingering shampoo from his hair, Harry opened his eyes, and his mouth fell open at once, causing him to almost choke on a heavy stream of water.
. All you have to do is ask, and you shall receive. I was wondering what I was going to have to get you for Christmas, but I think you’ve answered that for me.”
He clearly didn’t know Harry and his friends were there, or maybe he did and didn’t have eyes for him like last time.
After the shopping outing, Harry figured it was time to head back to the condo. He smiled at Iain, who was checking a couple in but grinned widely when he saw Harry.
Kingsley begrudgingly agreed to allow this when Harry had initially been asked. After all, he was promised two weeks off after the last gruesome raid, and he was planning on taking full advantage.
Malfoy’s brow raised, “You...were the one who asked me out here to speak. You are aware of that, aren’t you, Potter? Or is that lightning bolt on your head impairing your memory as well?”
He watched as the man meticulously placed his first round of hair care products in his blond hair, his fingers dragging over his head in circular motions.
Harry breathed in deeply and counted to five. He wasn’t sure if he was currently up to dealing with Malfoy if he was in a teasing mood. “Erm - nothing. Just some things I need to sort out before I completely lose it.”
Draco laughed as he Apparated them home, smiling at his boyfriend’s dramatics. “We wouldn’t that now, would we.”
singing voice Potter, then that’s fine. Just don’t let Filch find out. I don’t want to be the one who deals with him.”
Ron had escaped his wife’s oncoming tide by leaving to put the kids to bed minutes prior, saluting Harry on his way while his best mate pleaded with him to stay, uselessly.
Typically, it wouldn’t have bothered him as much, but he usually would have Draco beside him, stealing all the chow mein and complaining about the movie Harry picked to watch.
Harry wasn't sure if the so-called 'category' Roddy was talking about was for him or Malfoy but he wasn't about to find out anytime soon. He opened his mouth to fire back when he heard Malfoy sniggering beside him and he turned to him instead, brows furrowed in frustration."
They all settled into a booth at the back of the bar.  Harry had insisted they sit at the back because he didn’t want to chance sitting close to the stage in case Malfoy was there and decided to perform some of his infamous karaoke.  Folks had been so enamored with him and his singing that he had become something of a celebrity in eighth year.
He watched as Harry’s wrists sagged against the ropes that were still tying him up, head turned to the side.
It was the worst possible excuse he could have made to the worst person on Earth to make it to, and Harry bit back a groan of defeat at Ron’s beaming expression of the prospect of food.
“Nothing. Just have a lot to do before Christmas, is all,” he spat out as he pretended to organize the few papers on his desk.
Iain’s face blanched, looking from Harry to Draco and back to Harry, quickly pasting on a fake, customer service-like smile that Harry figured he was good at doing by now. “I see! Well, gentlemen, please let me know if I can get you- ”
Before Harry could acknowledge that with any response or breath in for that matter, the blond was up and out of the pool in a flash, pulling a towel over his body, and Harry followed him, tumbling over the side of the pool to rights again and followed him up to the condo.
To fix this, he decided he would swap eyes every few minutes to give the other one a break, not to strain one too much. Wouldn't want that now.
Potter kept his steadfast and thoughtful gaze on him and took a step closer away from the club’s wall. He looked as though he had made up his mind about something, nodding to himself.
“Yes, yes! I know what you mean.” Harry then realized Malfoy was talking about the song Typhon had sent him, which was still playing inside.
Draco left at that, knowing deep in his soul, he would never cleanse himself of the ache he so desperately wanted to rid himself of.
Draco raised an eyebrow at that, a question in his glittering eyes. “Whatever did she do to deserve that?”
looked to be a little less than a foot long in length and transparent in color, where someone could see right through it. It seemed almost squishy on the inside and hard and smooth on the outside.
A ding took him away from his musings, and he found a new song waiting for him. He stared down at the new addition, biting his bottom lip as he pushed away the lingering urge to hide in his dorm, turn off the lights, and replay the song over and over again.
He would have even loved to have fucked himself while watching Malfoy touch his cock, to bring the fantasy even more to life. He imagined fucking himself on his fingers as Malfoy watched him do it, as he would continue to wank to prepare his cock for him, his grey eyes on fire.
“You have freckles…” Harry stated dreamily, as his index finger traced over the small dots on the pale man’s shoulder.
I suppose that’s the Gryffindor in you. Come on, let’s stop and get take-out before they close for the night. Thai sound good?”
Draco swats him again, lightly this time, his bum still sporting a nice reddened color, and he leans down over his boyfriend with a smirk.
Draco stopped in front of a black door, as he had been instructed in the letter. The entryway in question was cracked open a few inches, and Draco couldn’t help but peer through.
Sitting back up in his sad chair, he stood up and wandered over to the tiki bar again. A man of habit, he was turning out to be.
“I haven’t been able to take my eyes off you all night. Those bloody robes of yours -” Harry licked his lips, and Draco clenched his fists, his cock hardening in his trousers, and a sick part of him hoped Potter could see it.
A few more seconds passed of the awkward staring contest between them, and Draco gritted his teeth, not able to stand this ridiculousness any longer.
He turned his head to lightly glare at his boyfriend over his shoulder, who lightly swatted him on his arse in retaliation.
Malfoy’s face then transformed into a myriad of expressions from shocked to confused but ended on a rather amused one.
“I am going to need two things from you before proceeding tonight.” His hand tightened minutely in his dark hair. “One, I need you to speak. I need you to moan and whimper and cry out as loud as you can.”
Harry attempted to take a step back, feeling a tad awkward standing so close to Draco, when his heel hit an invisible barrier of sorts, and he shouted in surprise and pain as he stood on one foot, glaring at Luna from across the room.
Well, less standing, and more jiving around the people surrounding him, dancing to the blaring music overhead.
Theodore Nott seemed to be filling a similar role, except without Millicent’s brains, as he was staring off into the abyss and not paying a lick of attention to the proceedings.
Pansy sighed, utterly put out with the two imbeciles beside her. “Yes, that is what some call sarcasm, love. You would think two years with me, and you would have it down pat by now. Bye, Potter!”
Draco leaned down again, caressing Harry’s face with his other hand, “Turn around on your stomach for me, love.”
“I left my wand at home,” Harry admitted, setting his water down as gently as he could, trying to ignore his magic thrumming inside of him, just wanting to be unleashed. Malfoy always made him feel this way, and Harry hated it.
He immediately set into action, grabbing at his most private collection of toys that he had brought with him, throwing them back into his luggage, and desperately praying to the gods and Merlin that Malfoy hadn’t been paying attention.
They then talked about work, complaining about Draco’s new secretary. Harry wasn’t a fan as the new hire was clearly gagging for Draco every day at work and made no point in hiding it.
Harry turned around to rinse the conditioner out, inhaling the lovely lemon scent, when his eyes caught sight of the damn fleshlight again.
Any time he could see his best mate smile, for whatever reason, it always managed to cheer Harry up out of whatever slump he found himself in.
“Yeah, okay,” Harry muttered as he bypassed Hermione’s raised eyebrows over by the couch to snag another drink before he caught himself staring at Malfoy and
Harry can’t understand that, seeing that the man is still as pale as he used to be at Hogwarts. He doesn’t know hot the git doesn’t burn, but a part of him hates him for it.
“I might know something. But if you would read the blasted book like I told you to, perhaps you would know something too.”
. Harry only shrugged. He could feel his cock dripping as Draco continued to rim him, his tongue slipping into him with ease as his body opened up eagerly to the ministrations.
“Come on, mate! It’ll take our minds off of all the blasted studying. Don’t tell ‘Mione, but she’s been busting my balls with the number of times she's forced me to study with her in the bloody library. I’ve had to think I’m dating Pince!”
It was one thing to watch Malfoy rub one out without him knowing; it was quite another to get off to him getting off ten feet away.
Draco asked, fingers lightly tracing the pink marks on his arse from earlier, moving down to his pucker, circling a fingertip around it, as Harry nodded into his pillow rather enthusiastically, to Draco’s delight.
to get back at him for all those times he got one up over him. Harry would be able to hold this over his head in sweet, sweet victory for any future bullshit he threw at him.
Slughorn made his rounds and then stood up at the front of the class for a last announcement. “As I enjoyed watching you all bond today with your other classmates, I’m going to assign a little project for you all.”
With one last lingering look around, Harry shook his head, feeling a sudden loss in his chest, a morose feeling overtaking him too quickly. It almost had him seeing double.
Like a bludger to the head, Harry stopped, realizing that he was in love with this mystery person cutting him open.
Finally, Draco slowly pressed into the man, wanting to savor this moment since he was sure it would be the only time he could ever touch Potter like this. He bit the inside of his cheek, the feeling of Potter’s tightness overwhelming, better than he imagined it could ever be.
Before Harry could even catch his breath, Malfoy turned to him so quickly he’d have thought he was a snitch Malfoy was attempting to snatch with those reflexes.
Nodding, Harry sucked in another breath and turned just enough to where he could look at Draco in his eyes. “Sorry -”
The third time had to be the last and final time; Harry told himself belatedly as he made his way through his classes that day.
“How original.” Ginny snickered into her bowl, and Ron managed to give her the finger between his massive bites of food.
Draco watched him in trepidation, and Harry could practically feel the magical nervous energy coming from him.
The lace-covered his half-hard cock indecently. Harry’s mouth watered at the sight of his hand, slowly rubbing down his chest, getting closer...before ultimately trailing away and back up his chest to a nipple, working it over until it stood hard against his pale chest.
Harry mewled softly into Draco’s neck, his hips becoming erratic against his like his own voice was turning him on almost as much as it was Draco.
The sounds increased in volume, and Draco leaned forward in his chair to hear what in the sodding hell Potter was saying to himself. But it sounded as though he was...speaking a different language?
Potter then clenched around his cock, and Draco groaned as he leaned over his body, grazing Potter’s cock, which was still wrapped up tight, unable to come himself.
He felt an elbow to his side, and Harry saw Ron giving him a wary look as he nodded toward the full pint glasses left by the bartender.
Vibrations began erupting ten-fold from the dildo, stronger than before, and Draco lightly moaned from both the sensation and his boyfriend’s reaction below him.
“You should have seen him on his fourth day here. Bloody travesty - ugly red splotches all over. Couldn’t handle the sun. Poor love had to have me rub Aloe Vera all over him.”
Harry wanted to both laugh and cry at Ron's uncanny ability to swap his positions just because of one look from his wife.
Just because the git seemed less evil in the past few years didn’t mean Harry had to become buddy-buddy with him.
The sunburn made him rather frustrated as it was, and Malfoy’s loud mouth hadn't been helping. So it was finally nice to have some peace and quiet on this vacation of his.
Hermione’s gaze went past Harry for a split second, before looking back at him in the next second. He despised the pitying expression on her face.
Ignoring the jibe, Harry muttered a balming spell on his elbow before taking the spot to Malfoy’s left, staring down into the violet-colored potion. “Looks about right. How do you already have it almost done?”
Harry covered his empty hand to his mouth, holding back his moans the best he could, as he frantically began wanking himself to the image, not able to refrain from touching himself any longer.
“Oi! Is this that bloody karaoke bar you keep talking non-stop about?” Dean yelled to Seamus over the crowd’s noise, who was looking entirely too smug for his liking.
Malfoy just looked up haughtily and sniffed, “I assure you, Potter, that is indeed the name of the establishment. Muggles have such a...quaint way about them, don’t they?”
A few seconds passed as Draco observed Potter. Any sign that he wasn’t into this scene and the ropes would immediately be cut down, no question. But then a spark of something passed through Harry’s green eyes, almost like a challenge, and Draco smirked triumphantly.
He could watch Malfoy floating in the water all day and all night, his pale skin ethereal as it blended beautifully with the light blues of the pool water. And when he opened his eyes to look up at him lazily, Harry was entranced by their stark greyish hue, the water almost bringing out the color to the nth degree.
At the very least, there seemed to be enough hot blokes to keep his attention for the next two weeks.
That last day of work before the Christmas holiday, Harry had been in a mood, and it had been evident to others at the Ministry if his secretary’s expression was anything to go by as he threw his last file of the year at him.
Potter was attempting to thrust up into the feeling again, moaning low in his throat, and Draco almost wanted to see him come like this.
“Because you tend to be a bit possessive over him,” Hermione stated once when Harry had asked the others why Draco left one afternoon.
Draco pinched his arse when Potter nipped at the reddened spot on his neck, and Potter thrust up against his thigh even harder. Draco bit down on his neck in extra retaliation.
“No, I guess I should say that I am apologizing for the way he acted towards you. Erm - it wasn’t nice. And it was quite ridiculous.” Potter’s eyes hardened then, as he looked away from Draco and towards the night sky in the background.
Draco turned slightly to Harry, nudging him with his arm, “I just have one question for you, Potter.”
When Malfoy bowed to the crowd after being declared the winner, winking in Harry’s direction, Harry gulped and decided it was time for bed.
He then visualized himself lying in his bed later that night, stroking himself off to visuals of Malfoy in the shower, and that almost made him come right then and there, just knowing that in an hour or so, he would be able to satisfy his need.
Draco bit back a groan. If he was honest with himself, he had been more than half-hard since he had peered into the room and gotten his first glimpse of Potter.
“I - I will have to make him feel comfortable with me once again. So, I will have to make it up to him. I didn’t mean to hurt him...with erm, whatever I did.” Pansy scoffed, but Harry rushed on.
Harry really did try to come up with any excuse he could think of that would prevent Malfoy's hands from touching him. Not that he was that put out on the idea, quite the opposite if he was honest. But anyone's hands on him at this point would do.
Harry jumped a foot in the air before turning around to the sight of Malfoy standing there, dressed to the nines and looking like he would rather be anywhere but here, acting as if he wasn’t the one to invite him out to begin with!
Harry wasn’t sure if it was the sneering tone or the fact that Draco thought he still smelled Ginny in his Amortentia, but something inside him exploded.
While he was waiting at the bar for the shots to get poured, desperately trying to tune out the end of the woman’s screech, he heard a rather loud commotion coming from Malfoy’s table and looked up to see him not there - only that’s when he realized -
He knew it was true from the moment when he sang that song, but hearing it come from one of Malfoy’s comrades made it all the more real.
Draco looked as though he was a jungle cat who finally found its prey, and Harry wasn’t sure if he was afraid of what’s to come or intrigued. His cock twitched again at it, and Draco smirked knowingly, coming over to lean over him in the bed.
He stared at Potter’s bright eyes roaming all over Draco, not able to stay in one spot for longer than a millisecond.
His thrusts quickened even more, not that he had much personal input on what speed he was choosing to keep going at, as this sex toy seemed to have a mind of its own.
"There is no changing some people or things when it comes to old magic. Maybe you should concentrate your energy on something else. I would hurry you, but I'm getting paid for my time and watching you get flustered is turning out to be much more entertaining than Zabini's party promised."
Draco crossed his arms together tightly against his chest. “But I just tried kissing Justin, and it wouldn’t let us even touch each other!”
He looked down as his cock moved in and out of the toy and wondered how deep Malfoy’s cock would go inside it versus his own - if both their cocks would fit inside at the same time...
Malfoy hummed at that instead, “So much pent up aggression. You know, I rather remember you not complaining at the time last year.”
It was around two in the morning when a new ping woke him up from a restless sleep, and his eyes lit up in the bright light his mobile was giving off. It was a new song. Harry instantly grabbed his headphones and started listening.
Harry grumbled into his pillow, something about going to the shops without him, and Draco pinched him in retaliation.
This whole meeting was centered around allowing house-elves more independence and self-rule. Hermione had an entire plan written up about how they should start receiving payments from their masters and how the term ‘house-elf’ was derogatory in itself.
Breathless, his usually perfectly tamed blond hair in disarray atop his head, he stared down at Harry in a mix of pure desperation and awe. He ran a long-fingered hand through Harry’s messy head of hair and sighed when the man tilted his head back into the touch.
In response, Potter only bit his bottom lip as he gazed up at him, and Draco wanted to rip it out and bite it himself.
A few indescribable moments passed, as Draco kissed up and down Harry’s neck, as he crooned in delight.
“Fuck! Oh, fuck, yes.” Potter moaned, and Draco cursed, moving his hips even fast and drowning in the sounds emitting from him without that ugly gag in the way.
incident that Draco would never have thought would ever be even close to a possibility for him utterly changed him, and these past few months have been torture for him in almost every aspect of his life.
Whenever a new song was sent his way, he would make excuses to skivvy off to the library or the Quidditch pitch right after classes to listen to the lyrics over and over, sometimes making notes of what it could mean in his notebook.
He watched as the mistletoe floated over his head and past him. That was when Harry realized some sort of invisible force was forcing him to walk faster, practically dragging him across the sitting room and towards Draco and Justin.
The four of them nodded as Kingsley made his way to the bar, something Draco always admired about him, the ability to talk politics while intoxicated.
He sucked in a stuttering breath; the sex toy sealed itself off from any shower water from entering. Not that it needed any more wetness inside to guide it. It almost felt to Harry like the fleshlight itself produced a small bit of liquid on the inside to help the slide.
“What?!” Harry muttered in irritation. He was getting tired of the Slytherins antics at this point and wanted to be left alone in peace to think about how to fix his dilemma. He must have outwardly said that as well, as Pansy’s expression became even more devilish.
The snakes left once they all came to a compromise, and Ron and Hermione, as well as some of the others, trickled into the common room soon after, catching Harry sitting by the fireplace, deep in thought about the night’s events.
All that day, he had been alone in his hotel suite, nothing to occupy his time besides reading over the notes for his upcoming meeting, silently stewing in the knowledge that Draco was out sight-seeing. Probably gossiping it up with Pansy and Ginny as they shopped at as many touristy spots as Ginny could drag the two of them.
Classes did seem to drag on worse than usual that day, and when 11:50 PM hit, he hightailed it to his spot, making sure to get there with time to spare.
“Anyone who would tie up their sub and leave them to others whims without anything in place - actually no.” Draco gritted his teeth, remembering Potter being tied up alone with the door unlocked, allowing anyone to swoop in and have their way with him, and Draco shuddered in disgust.
He could hear Potter swallow from where he stood, his eyes still trained on his crotch, and Draco felt the same heat sweep through him as before from earlier, practically swaying where he stood.
Draco’s grip on his glass tightened as his eyes met Potter’s, who hadn’t realized he was there tonight as well; his own expression looked as though he wished the ground would swallow him up.
Draco forced his eyes away from the green; afraid if he didn’t, he would never be able to when a little paper-shaped bird landed on his desk.
“Wait, wait, please continue.” Harry wasn’t sure why he was all of a sudden so enraptured with what Rodrick the bartender had to say, but whatever Malfoy had said about him, he felt he deserved to know.
“Thanks, mate, would’ve never guessed that one without your help,” Harry replied as he kept one earbud in, half-listening to the music and half pretending to pay attention to his friend’s conversation around him.
It didn’t help either that Harry still had that sodding book from the library that he hadn’t opened up yet.
Draco resisted the strong urge to roll his eyes into his skull at the mediocre display of nonchalance Potter was desperately trying to convey. It certainly did not suit him well.
Harry giggled at that, punching him lightly in the arm. “You are the most ridiculous man that I have ever met. And that is saying something.”
The song really was atrocious. He wasn’t sure who Cher was, but they could kiss his arse for all he cared.
Harry took off his glasses, wiping them off on his t-shirt as the man quickly made his way up towards the bar.
Harry then imagined telling Malfoy, admitting his ridiculous crush on an unknown person who had been sending him songs every day since the start of term and immediately imagined Malfoy laughing at him cruelly, like he used to years ago. That image hit him squarely in the solar plexus and he quickly decided against it.
Malfoy leaned down further and kissed him deeply, but instead of continuing what he started, he only laid his head down on Harry’s chest, sighing in content.
For some reason, after the War, Luna had been very keen on hosting her Christmas Eve party there due to the number of nargles in residence.
Seeing the silver-tongued Pansy Parkinson of all people muck up her words was quite the sight, but Harry couldn't care less and wanted her to spit it out already.
Rolling his eyes to the ceiling, Draco grabbed his wand, having had enough, and vanished the gag entirely. Potter realized immediately and began swallowing and licking his dry lips in relief, inhaling deeply.
After what seemed like an hour passed by, and Harry had to swallow his groan of annoyance when his eyes caught the time in the corner where Smith had kept a Tempus charm running to count the minutes of the meeting conveying it had only been fifteen minutes that had passed.
And sure enough, almost like clockwork, Harry heard some scuffling noises from the other side of the wall. He peered through the hole once the light turned on.
invited him to the scene. That alone made Draco’s head spin as he shakily took a sip of his watered-down gin.
“Those are called records. You pull them out of their sleeves here and place them inside the player here.” Harry’s eyes widened in silent awe as he watched Malfoy show him in real-time.
Before Malfoy could respond, the waiter came by and took their orders.  Harry only ordered a salad; he wasn’t sure he could stomach anything more.
So Harry slunk around the secret hallways that he never could venture to before, finding a strange delight in it.
Harry’s hands sweated as he glanced over the album sleeve, where there was a clear view of a man’s jean covered crotch in the center. “Erm - they had quite the artistic expression?”
Then again, Harry wasn’t one to talk, as he wasn’t much to venture out into the sex toy land. He owned one relatively small dildo for when he was feeling rather frisky. And some lube.
If not an exercise in self-restraint. Especially on the days when Malfoy would wear his low hanging joggers that framed his arse so deliciously.
“And Draco can get quite famously angry. Trust us,” Blaise said with a smirk that was a tad bit frightening.
A sudden, painful wave of jealousy hit Draco particularly hard as images of others having their own go with Potter suddenly stampeded through his head. With those thoughts in mind, he swiped a hand up, magically cleaning off Potter of any extraneous fluids lingering around his mouth and the rest of his body, scouring him of anything
Harry couldn’t look away at the beads of water hitting his body, the look of pure, unadulterated bliss on the other man’s face.
Then he remembered that Typhon had sent him a new song, so he rushed to pull out his mobile, casting a soft
What if Typhon turns out to be a First Year? Or some random Fifth Year having a go at him at his expense?
One nasty bite later, Harry took his hand back, glaring at the man. “Merlin, Malfoy, your hair will survive this travesty,
If last year’s Christmas gift didn’t clue him into Harry’s feelings towards him, he wasn’t sure what would do it. Perhaps a lap dance and a nice make-out sesh would do the trick?
He tilted his head again, his face angled up to see Draco’s own if the blindfold wasn’t filtering out his vision, almost as if he was staring right into Draco’s soul from behind the mask. Draco leaned down closer, his heart pounding as he moved his palm to hold his neck, thumb massaging his skin gently as he leaned down and grazed his lips to Potter’s swollen ones. The urge to suck and lick them better reverberating through him powerfully.
Harry looked back up from where he was staring at the ground and raised both eyebrows. And for the first time since Harry stepped foot outside that night, Malfoy seemed a bit too preoccupied with the color of the stone's floor to look back his way.
A few sounds caught his attention from behind the different colored doors as he passed them, ranging from short whimpers to long-drawn-out moans, and behind one, Draco could have sworn he heard the sound of leather reverberating off the walls.
“So, erm -” Harry looked back down to the snow for a split second before taking a breath and looking straight at his boyfriend.
- his inner voice reminded him, as it had all week, as he paced his dining room floor in agony over whether or not he should show up.
Harry's eyes travelled across shapely leather-clad thighs and fitted robes. The face was familiar but the smirk worn by the wizard made Harry shiver.
For starters, he didn’t want to see Draco’s boyfriend and his work partner snuggling by the fire all night. Or
The Slytherin would become twitchy and awkward – Harry couldn’t remember ever seeing him like that before, and would practically jump at the chance of a new conversation.
A Draco from three years ago would have certainly called him out in front of the class or perhaps written a cruel note to him about it. But nowadays, he didn’t have that energy nor anger in him.
.” Instead of touching him more, he removed his hands and pressed Harry’s back down further into the mattress, his thrusts picking up.
Harry walked further into the room and could see the start of where the beach began, and if he squinted, he could have sworn he could see the sparkle of the ocean further on --
He figured it would be for the best, so he wouldn’t have to shuffle back to the common rooms with a stiffy like he had the previous night. He practically had to waddle around like a bloody penguin.
But Pansy carried on as if she believed Harry was listening intently to her belittling him with every breath she took.
Harry felt as if someone had petrified him right there and then, as he watched Malfoy’s now lace-covered arse as Malfoy reached down to pick up the robe, before folding it very neatly on the same bench as before.
Before Harry fell into a sound sleep, he heard Draco mutter something along the lines of onions and layers and laughed aloud at that.
If anything, it would be a funny story to tell Pansy later. If only he could figure out what it was that Potter was whispering about.
Malfoy’s eyebrows raised as he raised a finger to his lips, tapping lightly on the lower one, and Harry gritted his teeth at the nonchalant act.
“Come then. Now.” He gritted out, and Harry wailed, his cock spurting out copious amounts of come all over the bedsheets, his mouth open as his screams turned into soft croons. From behind his eyes, he could have sworn he saw a purple light, but he didn't have his wits about him to check or really care for that matter, his orgasm taking everything out of him.
But of course, it would appear that way, Draco internally dismissed the notion; it’s not as though Potter would have forgotten to apply a disillusionment charm before leaving his flat.
“I saw the toys you brought with you that day. What did you expect when you came down here? Did you have plans to find some random bloke to whip into shape with that pretty flogger of yours? Or did you want someone shoving that plug up your own arse, watching you as you struggled on it?”
Luna nodded, “Nargles wouldn’t lie to us. All they want is to bring happiness to those that deserve it most.”
Potter smirked against his mouth and pulled back, his pupils wide, and he already looked utterly decadent, and Draco wanted nothing more than to sweep him up and Disapparate back to his house.
Having Harry’s pleasure, only to him, was such a treasure, and Draco never let Harry down, always giving him what he needed. Harry may think Draco was ‘in charge,’ but Draco knew better than that.
He made his way through the darkness. Malfoy hadn’t seen him yet, even as he slowly climbed up using the side steps that connected to the stage, finding a second microphone sitting up in the back.
He begrudgingly grabbed the base of his cock through his robes to prevent any accidents, as he continued to watch the blond come back from his high. He cleaned any leftover mess in the shower water before turning off the faucet and grabbing his array of hair products and soaps and walking out of the shower towards the other side of the bath where his pajamas laid.
Malfoy then opened his mouth, breathing hotly, and licked his bottom lip, catching the water droplets as they cascaded down from the shower.
It wasn’t as though Harry was in denial that Malfoy was decent looking. After tonight he was sure to have more than one nice complimentary thought about the man’s bum and other...features.
Draco’s eyes moved down the length of the man before him, stopping at the nipple clamps, nice and snug. He had a strong urge to pull on them. His eyes traced each scar the man had received from his few years as an Auror and continued down along Potter’s happy trail until his gaze reached the hard cock at the end of it.
Harry turned to the fireplace and to the cursebreaker whom Bill considered the very best in the whole of England.
Harry heard Ron sigh in defeat beside him as he trodded slowly to Michael Corner in the back to partner up with him.
After what seemed like ages, Malfoy slowly turned towards the shower stall, facing Harry in the same movement, and Harry’s breath caught in his throat.
“Looking good, Mr. Potter! The sun is doing you wonders.” Iain gave him one of his famous winks as he strolled by the two men by the pool.
Once he finally got around to listening to the blasted song in question, he couldn’t blame Typhon for sending all the hate his way.
He thought it was something about a new invention at WWW, but he wasn’t sure; it had been hard to pay attention with all the birthday festivities around them.
Harry put all his efforts into keeping his face calm as he used all of his lower body strength into kicking his boyfriend again. With his quick reflexes, Draco grabbed the struggling leg on the ankle and managed to place both knees back on the ground.
His legs were bent at the knee and pulled outwards and to his sides, wrapped up thoroughly to ensure no movement.
Draco’s eye crinkled as he attempted to hold back a smile of adoration. He was always jealous of Harry’s ability to brave anything he set his mind to, including uncomfortable conversations, it seemed.
A few more seconds passed then, and the clock rang midnight, a few people cheering outside even who probably had too much eggnog spiked tequila.
A light flickered outside, and Draco realized it was coming from Harry, and he reached across the table to take hold of his fist, which was currently radiating with uncontrolled magic.
But he left it be and walked further down, eyeing the meticulously knotted ropes crisscrossing his thighs.
But of course, he would be here - he’s Harry sodding Potter. If he didn’t show, Minister Shacklebolt would have his head. After all, the main reason for this particular soirée was to raise money for the Wizarding Orphans Committee, and if Potter hadn’t shown his face to this one, he’d probably be out of a job.
“And then what’re you gonna do if you find out who it is?” Neville questioned, his mouth twitching in amusement. Blinking a few times as he stared down at his phone, Harry mulled it over for a few seconds. “I don’t know, probably erm- well...I don’t know.”
He wasn’t sure if he wanted Malfoy to slap him again or call him more indecent names; he wasn’t sure of anything except the need to get Draco inside him sooner rather than later.
“What is so special about it?” Draco gritted out between his teeth, and Harry glanced his way, noticing his cheeks had a nice pink color on his cheekbones.
“I - I was just going to say how erm...relieving it is to see people change...for the better as Malfoy has. Good on him.”
But in a deep, dark trench of his mind, Harry knew it was more than admiring a simple beauty. But he wasn’t about to travel down that road.
That made Harry wonder how she could get the reservation for him in the first place, but when he asked, Hermione had only waved him off, stating it was thanks to someone she worked with that had an ‘in.’
Harry eloquently mumbled, “Wha-” Coughing, he tried again, his throat immensely dry. “What happened.”
Draco leaned back at that, away from him and denying him any extra touch. Potter keened at that, and Draco grinned behind him, shushing him all the while. “Oh, hush now; we don’t want anyone to hear us now, do we.
He desperately needed to get this project for Slughorn completed so he could devote all his attention to finding out who Typhon was and so he could get on with his life. And forget about Malfoy and his teasing and those fiery looks he was frequently giving him.
of lube in fact. Draco furrowed his brow in contemplation as he looked at the bottles more closely. There didn’t look to have been used much at all.
Malfoy was practically vibrating with need as his restraint started to waver, one hand kept tugging on his reddened cock, and the other was caressing his balls, and Harry was sure he was going to come any second now...
Plus, he figured there wasn’t any harm in a little venturing out, walking around after curfew. After all, he was the ‘Vanquisher of the Dark Lord’, and if anyone were allowed to walk around Hogwarts free-rein in their pajamas, it would be him, piss on Filch.
