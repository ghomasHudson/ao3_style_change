“I-I’m…going to see James,” She mutters mutedly before disappearing through the door after Albus.
Which Harry had definitely not given to his son. But now, it seems, it is a good thing that James knows no boundaries and guilt – except only when someone has died, apparently – to go through his study; a room Harry has locked with charms that even a seventh-year should not be able to break, he adds in his mind.
Harry eventually manages to order all but Molly to go to their beds, promising that they will be safe, proceeding to give the same instructions to Bletchley as he did to Parkinson. He leaves the Ravenclaw common room and exhales in the corridor before making his way to the Gryffindor Tower.
closely – so he barely moves an inch.
!” Draco breathes, as Potter pulls back for a moment, only to tilt his head to the other side, before surging back to conquer Draco with his lips and tongue, his hand sliding around Draco’s shaft in a relentless pace.
“What about her friends? Old boyfriends? What kind of relationship had she with Mr Riley?” Harry asks after a short silence.
, little experiment, “It became clear, that Miss Travers had taken three vials of Calming Draught, before casting her last spell – the locking spell – to the door. And, due to her condition – as with three vials of Calming Draught, it is quite remarkable that she had even been standing at that point – her magical signature, however weak it had been, was transferred to the door. But the door was not locked. The spell had not been strong enough.”
“Berrycloth, Fungbury and Weasley are patrolling the station and Hogsmeade,” Harry continues, “Higgins, Bletchley, Walter and Parkinson will go back to the common rooms until we have cleared the threat – expect a nightshift, and communicate if there is anything suspicious,” Harry says to the Aurors in question; who all nod grimly.
Hermione is already moving towards the elevators. “Oh, and Harry,” She says and turns to look at Harry after pressing the button to summon the lift.
. Like, for one month after she broke up with me. Which was at the end of September. It’s safe to say we both avoided each other after that. I didn’t talk to her until the train. I only saw her at the party, but I definitely didn’t invite her there.”
Draco vaguely remembers Potter saying something, asking if Draco was going to be all right. Or – Potter might’ve just told he had been dancing with Dumbledore, Draco couldn’t say. He was quite inebriated.
She leaves, and Harry stays alone in the quiet classroom, for quite some time, going over the case in his mind, before Quinn and Smith return, followed by Ginny, Professor Slughorn, and Albus.
Albus glances at his friend. “Nothing. She’s just…I dunno,” he murmurs, before turning his focus back to his friends. “It’s a Hufflepuff.”
He knows that he has a bit of time before the others wake up and they’ll be starting a new day in the investigation – it is not yet five-thirty, and he assumes the Aurors are still sleeping – so he decides to make the most of it and step into a hot shower down the hall.
“Scorpius asked Travers not to speak of what she had seen at the party,” Quinn says, glancing at Harry and Albus, and then back to his notes, “And as I asked Scorpius, what had Travers seen, Scorpius confirmed that she had seen Scorpius with Potter, upstairs…er – kissing and, um, touching each other, intimately.”
Albus thinks sourly.
James arches a brow at him. “A
Harry knows Ron’s right, but – but why are they in the centre of this? Why?
“How many can I take?” Harry asks then, in his mind already going through a list of his Aurors who are working or on call.
Quinn nods slowly. “Why do you say Miss Travers was talking,” he glances at his notes, “rubbish, about you to Scorpius, when you found them?”
And later on, Albus did admit to Scorpius that the plan had been an idiotic one, since they really didn’t get into any of the Muggle pubs they tried to, even with their charmed ID’s. As they were unable to use magic outside Albus’s home due to being underage, they had thought their fake Muggle ID’s would’ve done the trick. But no. Apparently, neither of them looks old enough to be eighteen, Albus reckons.
Albus can see a vein ticking in their father’s temple, as the man keeps grinding his teeth together in order to not explode in rage.
Ron lets out a very quiet groan. Hermione gives her husband a narrow-eyed look.
he had done all the necessary detection spells to make sure the train was indeed empty and trap-free, before he approached the scene.
.” Moonstone warns, evidently knowing where Harry’s thoughts, and his questions are going.
Malfoy hums under his breath. “Join the club, Potter…” He says wryly.
Scorpius is both irked and amused by the events, and tells Albus that he needs to seriously start thinking about dying his hair or at least getting fat. But to Albus, it all seems like Scorpius’s heart is not in it, like his mind is somewhere else, and like he’s merely trying to say the right things so that Albus would leave him be.
What he doesn’t expect, as he creeps a bit closer, is that his brother and his friend are in a middle of an argument.
Scorpius gives him a jerky nod. “Yeah.” He says quietly, and then turns to go back to his own bed, slumps to sit down on it, and buries his face in his hands.
Harry lifts a hand up, and silence falls once more.
“Traumatic brain injury,” Draco says, pointing a finger at the wound in the girl’s head. “No damage, bruising or wounds elsewhere.” He flicks his wand a couple of more times before adding, “Time of death appears to be approximately two to three hours ago.”
Draco’s pride tries to remind him that he still ought to feel bitter about what happened, and not let Potter use him whenever he wants to.
He’s glad the inspection is over, but he dreads everything it brought up.
“So, you think one of us did it, then?” James asks, narrowing his eyes at their father, looking somewhat offended.
Draco’s brows twitch slightly, as he wonders, with irritation, what the hell the blonde man is blushing about now, and how the hell would a
McGonagall gives him a strained smile. “Auror Potter, why don’t you take a seat with us – I believe we all would like to hear an update about the situation.”
Albus quickly steps back, a shield charm already in place as James jumps up and a mere second later, throws a hex at him, roaring at the same time.
Albus can hear James scoffing loudly. “No, you fucking won’t,” James growls. “You will not tell a soul, Malfoy, and you will pray that they don’t ask about it tomorrow. And if they do, you’ll – you’ll lie!”
Albus gives Scorpius an incredulous look, having been hoping that he could snap his friend away from whatever it is that is bothering him.
Auror Berrycloth walks in, followed by three Aurors Draco doesn’t know by name; a woman in her forties and two men, who both seem younger than the woman and Berrycloth. They all greet Potter and then eye Draco curiously, before Potter makes the slightly clumsy introductions; Aurors Bones, Smith and Keir.
Potter then asks Keir to order them something to eat and drink, and there’s a short break. When Keir returns, Potter nods at Quinn, who then starts to go over the questionings he had held with Draco’s son and Potter’s sons and niece.
“No, I did not see anyone after I left Jenna’s compartment.” Rose says instantly.
Peele chuckles at him, leaning against Harry’s doorframe. “Rough holidays?”
It’s the beginning.
Quinn gives him a small nod. “I agree.” He then glances at the timepiece on the wall. “Nearly one. James is coming now, right?”
“Feels different…” Potter mutters.
He steps into the Ravenclaw tower after muttering “Fire,” to a riddle asked by the eagle knocker; ‘
James was not questioned about the party under Veritaserum, because Quinn hadn’t seen it important, knowing that Harry had been concerned about the alcohol and the underage kids. And because James had neither seen Scorpius nor Travers during the train ride, there was no way they could’ve put together the truth. Scorpius had asked Travers on the train not to say anything about
Harry thinks, not really wanting to picture the details of the occurrence. Scorpius and Albus, they were –
, Harry thinks, for making him unable to enjoy a quick wank without his mind wandering over to the blonde Slytherin.
Albus also knows that Scorpius doesn’t hate his father, even if he makes it seem like he does some days. He reckons that Scorpius and his father are merely too different – not in appearance, as they look so much alike; they both have blonde hair and an impossibly good posture, sharp angles and grey eyes. Only…Albus thinks there’s something inexplicably
Rose nods, letting out a long breath. “I know I shouldn’t – I mean, we weren’t even friends with Jenna, but…I can’t stop thinking how horrible it is, what happened to her,” she says, her voice thick. “…Even though I reckon many people thinks she deserved it,” she says with a displeased tone, biting her lip.
Potter gapes at him, then moves his gaze away, evidently in his mind going through the events during the holiday.
The Aurors have been discussing their plans for the day throughout the breakfast, occasionally asking about the details of the scene from Draco. Potter has been using most of the time to make floocalls to a number of people: the Minister, the Auror office, their boss – who Draco has only met a handful of times after the war and after his hiring – and Weasley’s mother, apparently.
He turns to look at the Malfoys. “Scorpius?” Harry says steadily. “We’re ready for you.”
the fucking reaction I was hoping for!” He yells, but doesn’t move, standing still right next to Scorpius’s bed. “And, my dear friend,
Harry reaches the bare stretch of stone wall.
“What is the great mind thinking?” Moonstone asks quietly, standing up from his chair and flicking his wand at the teapot on a side table. “Tea?”
Harry assigns orders; Keir, Quinn, Fungbury and Ron will search the village and question its inhabitants, while Harry and Berrycloth will go to search the station and the train and to examine the crime scene. Everyone moves quickly towards their destinations, agreeing to report to Harry by the hour or if something comes up.
Harry agrees, and tells McGonagall that he will first summon all his Aurors to the Entrance Hall to have them updated before moving on with the investigation. McGonagall tells them that they will have until midnight, and after that the students should be allowed to turn in for the night.
“Mr Riley is from the Ravenclaw house, but I presume he is currently in the Hufflepuff common room?” McGonagall says, giving an inquiring brow at Moonstone, who nods back at her.
Albus wants to say he definitely agrees, but he chooses to keep it to himself. The girl looks close to tears already. Instead he clears his throat. “Why did you think I’d – I’d be, um…into you?” He asks, and then leans against the teacher’s table, watching her with an arched brow.
Albus stands up from the bench, right as James mutters a quiet “Yeah.”
Not that Draco was objecting the slightest. In fact, he was enjoying it more than he had imagined he would with Potter. It had been both thrilling and so…
“Alright there, sir?” Peele asks as he walks by Harry’s office while pulling on his robes, finishing for the day. “Long day, eh?”
Quinn gives Harry a curious look. “Why her? Why not the boyfriend, who probably accompanied her in the train?”
Which doesn’t exactly make Harry at ease.
Harry nods. “Was there anyone who didn’t get along with Miss Travers?”
“…James and Albus…” Harry mutters, shaking his head slightly. “It feels like I don’t know my sons as well as I thought...”
“Why didn’t you stay with her and go to the school together?” Harry asks, watching how Riley’s cheeks tinge slightly with red.
Potter looks stunned, unable to form words. Draco wonders if there are other things the boy is keeping from his father. He would quite like to point it out, out of spite, as he has always somewhat envied the relationship between Potter and Albus – like it wasn’t enough that Draco has already felt jealous of the bespectacled wonder since the day they met – envied Potter’s good terms with Scorpius, and how the two of them seemed to interact effortlessly, compared with Draco and Scorpius.
Draco blinks, momentarily speechless, reminded of another time, another night; the last time he talked with Potter. The last time he saw that innocent, sincere look in his eyes. He swallows hard and forces those memories to somewhere deep in his mind, allowing the envy and indifference to surface. He has always had mixed feelings regarding Potter, and only understood them after he had reached adulthood, long after he had married Astoria.
Rose frowns slightly. “Around six.”
“Two hours ago, the train arrived to Hogsmeade,” Potter mutters at his watch, and then takes in the scene with a focused frown.
“Did you see her during the train ride back to Hogwarts?” Quinn asks then, and James shakes his head.
“James told us about a party that took place in his home, to where Travers was invited by him,” Quinn says, glancing at his notes.
“Oh! Hi. I didn’t know anyone was awake yet,” Potter says breathlessly.
“Albus?” Scorpius asks, sitting on his bed.
Ginny scowls at Harry for a moment, and then lets out a weary sigh. “Fine. Do it then,” She says stiffly, looking aloof, and then turns towards the door, not saying anything more, and not turning back to look at Harry.
“Scorpius?” Potter asks, almost silently, following Quinn’s gaze.
“She didn’t,” Albus says quietly, looking at the snow surrounding their ankles. “I’m just glad it’s over.”
Scorpius looks back at him, shrugging. “Yeah, I’m fine. Just some stuff with dad…” He mutters, turning his focus on his plate.
The Headmistress takes a steadying breath, while the teachers at their table keep glancing at her with a mix of worried and shocked expressions.
if it wasn’t for you,
“This what you wanted?” Potter murmurs, bucking his hips against Draco’s.
to Albus, somehow. He thinks the feelings between the two of them are not really mutual. He thinks Scorpius hasn’t looked at Rose like that, and probably will not do so in the future.
Harry is about to speak about his quarrel with Ginny, but then closes his mouth, opting to give Malfoy a nod instead. “I need to go soon. Quinn will question Rose in a moment, and then I have to discuss with Mr Riley’s, Miss Scotts’ and Miss Westen’s parents and ask them the very same thing I’m asking you now,” Harry says wearily, before giving Malfoy an intent look. “Will you give your permission to question your son under Veritaserum?”
Quinn looks at Potter. “Even though Albus didn’t seem to be distressed at any point of the questioning, and explained the events rather openly, there is still the fact that Albus and the victim have history together, and he admitted that they were in bad terms some months prior to Travers’s death. Thus, he will be questioned under Veritaserum.”
“Me too,” Rose says, taking Albus’s hand and squeezing it.
Draco lifts his brows at the Auror. “Yes?”
Potter clenches his jaw. “A what?” He asks mutedly, his neck taking an interesting shade of red.
The rest of his words are muffled, as Harry covers Malfoy’s lips with his, their kisses instantly greedy and slick, their breaths hot against each other’s lips. Harry grips Malfoy; his other hand against his neck, holding him in place for Harry to ravage his mouth; and the other, roaming searchingly over Malfoy’s body, before finally stopping in the middle of his back, where he presses the other man slowly towards him.
Lust and want overpower the sharp wave of annoyance for being manhandled.
Peele nods at him with a smile before taking a step back. “Tomorrow, then.”
And Harry is even more stunned, if possible, since… James and Albus, they get along, but they have never been as close as Lily and James, or Lily and Albus. The fact that James would defend his brother – and Harry admits that the means to do so were rather harsh – makes his chest warm a bit.
Potter glances at the Aurors, before he continues, “Pamela Scott stayed in a compartment with her sister and Skylar Westen for the most of the trip. Jenna Travers stayed in their compartment for some hours in the beginning of the train ride. Pamela Scott, her sister and Westen heard part of the argument between Scorpius and Travers, and then between Albus, Scorpius and Travers,” Potter says, with tightness in his voice. “Scott’s description of the events changed between the questionings, and her final word, under Veritaserum, was that she had heard Scorpius asking Travers not to say anything to anyone, but she hadn’t heard what exactly. She confirmed that she had in fact seen Albus coming there as well, and having an argument with Travers. Scott explained that she had heard Travers threatening Albus about revealing his secrets to everyone, and because of that, she had later asked her sister and Westen to not mention the occurrence to the Aurors. She explained that while she was sure that Albus couldn’t have had anything to do with what had happened to Travers, she thought Albus would have been suspected for her death, after having the argument with her.”
“The school governors have been owling me every hour, as well as the Minister; apparently many of the students’ parents have taken residence in the village, demanding that the school ought to be closed, and the children sent to their homes,” McGonagall says, her tone weary.
parchment between his fingers.
He tries to give them a reassuring smile. “Everyone but Prefects into dormitories, please,” He says coolly, and he’s met with hesitant expressions.
“What on earth are you wearing?” Draco asks before he can stop himself, as he stares at Potter’s attire; a pair of loose trousers and a hoodie – hardly something one wears outside during the winter.
Neither Miss Westen’s nor Mr Woods’s questioning gave Harry much. Their stories were identical – not too identical to have been agreed upon, but enough to be valid. They had both been patrolling the train for the most of the ride, and had only briefly sat down with Miss Travers and her boyfriend. Miss Westen had told them – after Harry had asked if there had been anything concerning or unusual in Miss Travers’s relationship with her boyfriend – that Mr Riley was somewhat of a jealous type, but that was only because Miss Travers had had a lot of history with other boys.
Their father looks horrified. “W-What?”
What he actually needs to do, is to talk with Scorpius.
had done to James. “Does it matter?” He grits out.
“What did you want?” Draco asks with a blank voice, watching Potter carefully.
And there are moments he wishes he’d
“Who do you think is dead?” Zachary asks quietly, his eyes quickly moving across the Slytherin table.
Albus stares at his friend. What does Scorpius mean? What the hell does he
Draco arches a brow at Potter, only then remembering the fact, and deciding to exchange a couple of carefully selected words with the Auror later. Potter notices Draco looking at him, and there’s a mixture of guilt and exasperation in his expression, before he turns his focus back to Quinn.
Waves of pleasure float over him, overwhelming him, and Draco must’ve lost some time, as he suddenly realises that his hands are twined in Potter’s disorderly locks, tugging them lightly, guiding Potter’s lips to fit against his.
Their father gives James a furious look. “
He seethes inwardly. Fucking Potter with his meaningful looks and his maddeningly soft smiles and his alluring bright eyes. Draco gives him a sneer, and Potter merely turns away, a ghost of a smile on his lips.
Harry stands up and moves to the fireplace, mutters a spell to light it, before throwing a handful of floopowder into the now merrily dancing flames. He reaches Hermione easily, gives her a status report, and she tells him that she has been in contact with Ginny – who will arrive to Hogsmeade later that evening – and the rest of the Weasleys. She makes him promise to give her love to her children. She also tells Harry that no one has come forth about the incident, and everyone – including the Minister – is eager for Harry to solve the matter efficiently. They end the call after Harry tells her that he’ll be in touch in a couple of hours, when he has gone through the results of their investigation for the night.
Albus clenches his jaw, looking away. Of fucking course. Of course, James will break up with his long-time girlfriend and go after Scorpius instead. Of course, he’ll endanger his whole Quidditch career – or at least, that is what he said it would do, for a – a – what? One, drunken night of necking? Albus shakes his head in frustration. Of course, he’d do so. Because this is Albus’s life, and when has Albus ever got what he wanted? When has James not got everything he wanted?
“No. I daresay I haven’t,” he says quietly, watching the castle in front of them with longing and sadness. There are too many good and bad memories he needs to swallow down and examine later in the confines of his room.
“Do you want to listen to music or something, Potter?” Malfoy breaks the silence of the room to ask. Harry glances lazily over at him, his straight back and crossed legs, and smiles.
“ Malfoy places his hand on top of hers for a moment, and she stills. Her eyes are locked on him, wide and glassy. She sniffs once more, quietly, then squeezes her eyes shut, curling a hand into Malfoy’s shirt.”
The fast clicking of heels against the stone corridor got louder as Harry shut the door behind him. He turned, glancing down the hallway in the direction of the voice- Hermione’s. She appeared, her eyes locking onto him.
Once he's done with the gel, he begins with his magic. His fingers gently press and prod at the expanse of skin that is Harry's back, sending tiny sparks to tell him what injuries there were. There was some bruising, a few superficial cuts, and some residual magic inside him, but that could be fixed moderately easily. The magic would take the longest. Malfoy tells Harry as such before he begins the next stage.
He begins to cast, his voice still rough with sleep. His wand moves in a twirl, he says a spell, and then he pauses as he interprets whatever the results are. They aren’t visible to Harry, though he’s sure he wouldn’t understand them, even if they were.
The blond just shakes his head, disapproving. “I wish I could talk to whoever raised you,” he says, whisking out of the room again.
Harry's green eyes pass over the room where he dumps Hedwig's cage and puts his trunk. He moves swiftly across the tiny room, waving his wand. "Wingardium leviosa," he says, moving the tiny shelf next to the bed. It reveals a tiny fireplace- he reaches into his jean pocket and takes out some Floo powder, throwing it into the fireplace. The green flames shoot up. He crawls into the fire, standing up and shouting, "Knockturn Alley!" He stumbles out of the fire into Borgin and Burkes- he sneaks out the door.
“Let’s listen to that, then. Beethoven or Chopin or something. I can’t say I know much about it,” Harry says with a sigh, his eyes fluttering shut, “but I’d still love to hear it. If it means something to you, that is.”
“Potter?”
"Why would I possibly joke about such a thing?" He sounds cold, like his old self. Defensive. His tone was tinged with that same unexplainable emotion. If Harry didn't know better, he would think he'd hurt Malfoy and feel guilty for lashing out. But, of course, he did know better. "I'm not joking, Potter, don't be so insolent. I'm on my way to be a healer, and you'd be hard-pressed to find someone near my level of medical knowledge in this castle.” Malfoy’s voice was getting lower, angrier.
He adjusted the cuff of his white shirt, his silver-grey eyes scanning the room for a drink tray. Alcohol focused his mind, it always had. He spotted one, bobbing its way through the room, and began to thread his way through the crowds of people to reach it.
Malfoy’s cool breath ghosts over Harry’s cheek. His presence is comforting, warm and solid and steady, and the tension leaches out of Harry’s body.
Harry smiles. He had been prepared. "I'd like joker bites and snake bites too, please."
Though his mind is fuzzy, Harry knows something is deeply wrong. He feels wrong. His chest aches slightly, as does his head. Through the fog of Malfoy’s sedating magic, Harry can feel their heartbeats thrumming together.
Harry tilts his head as he stares at Malfoy- he’d blushed more in the past twenty minutes than Harry had ever seen him blush before. But he lets it go, crossing his legs on the bed and opening his own book.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry nods. "I'd like to get some piercings." The man's smile grew wider.
“I don’t want to be your savior, Malfoy. I just want to figure this out.”
"Harry?" Malfoy's voice, and his cool hand on Harry's back, shocked him.
“Come on, then.”
He forces a slight smile for Ron, patting his shoulder once before turning back to Molly. She had returned to staring forlornly at her lost son, half of a pair, tears slowing trekking down her face. Harry put a gentle hand on her shoulder, pressing a kiss to her cheek and standing up. She glances at him, seeming to understand. He turns to Hermione, whose face was upturned to look at him. He brushed a tear from her cheek before turning and striding back towards the door.
"A relaxer. It makes the magic flow easier, and makes a connection easier to hold," the taller boy explains. He applies the gel silently for a few minutes, massaging it into the dark skin below him before he absent-mindedly begins to hum.
Harry opens his eyes, the smile he hadn’t known was on his face only widening as he stares at Malfoy. “The bath is great, Malfoy. You picked good scents- are they from the oils?” He attempted to divert the vain man’s attention by talking about his expensive bath products- he seemed to take them very seriously.
Harry rolls his eyes, smiling at Malfoy’s back as he returns to his task. “Not because of Gryffindor. Well…” he hesitates, and smiles again, wider this time. “Maybe a little.”
His mouth drops open, and he spins, marching quickly into Malfoy’s room. He nudges the other boy, crouching down next to him, a twinge of regret hitting him as he does so. He doesn’t really want to wake him, but he also doesn’t want to use his bathroom without permission.
Ron and Hermione were likely mourning, as he should be. Harry knows that many people would be dead when it was all said and done. Dead because of him, because of what Voldemort had done to get him.
Harry let go of Malfoy’s arm, pushing himself to stand. He stepped over the boy’s body, so he was on the side of the wounded arm, tearing his tie off. He knelt back down and pressed his tie to the wound, gently lifting Malfoy’s arm over his thighs as he did so.
A tinge of pink creeps into Malfoy’s cheeks, and he averts his eyes, staring intently at the page his book was open to.
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Don’t be daft, Potter. It’s fine.” He flicks a dismissive hand towards the large, plush bed, and Harry tries to ignore how the tips of his ears are still red. “Sit down, I have to sort through some of these books. You won’t be able to help with that.”
Green eyes lit up, and a smile stretched across Harry’s face as an idea occurred to him. He reached into his robes, feeling around in the inner chest pocket. His grin widened when his fingers closed around rough parchment- he drew the Marauder’s Map out into the low light, murmuring “Lumos'' as he did so. Soft light emanating from his fingertips, illuminating the paper.
Hermione’s voice trailed off as her eyes moved from Harry’s face to the boy in his arms. Shock flashed across her face, and one of her hands came to her mouth. “Harry…”
“What the fuck is a bath setting? I like the water to be warm, usually, but that’s about my only requirement.”
“You had...a Horcrux inside you?”
Malfoy keeps at the Healing for much longer than on the bruises and gash, but Harry doesn’t mind. He dozes off completely at one point, to the sound of Malfoy's velvet voice and feel of his magic hands.
Sneakily and quietly, he snuck out of his room- skipping the third to last step on the staircase as he crept downstairs- it creaked, rather loudly, and no one was to know he was leaving. He knew he could still get in trouble for doing magic in a Muggle house, with Muggles sleeping right upstairs so instead he quietly picked the lock on his old cupboard (the Dursley's didn't know he could do that, but he'd learned years ago so that he could sneak out and steal a piece of bread or two if he hadn't got any dinner) and got his wand. He pulled out the fully packed trunk from the tiny closet, dragging it outside without much trouble.
He glanced around at the attendants of the ball- his friends, classmates, enemies. They would be lost to him soon enough.
“Here,” Harry says. He stops in front of a closed door, shooting a glance over his shoulder at Malfoy. He grimaces at what he sees.
This was a dangerous task he was undertaking.
Harry slows as he finally got close to the Weasleys. He could feel the pain rolling off them in waves, and spotted one of the twins in the middle of their huddle, cold and still on the unforgiving stone floor of the hall. Harry’s heart stuttered, and he pressed a hand to his mouth. His eyes welled with tears as Molly Weasley, practically his mother, the woman who had accepted him since he was 11, looked up at him.
He thinks the ground was shaking but...It seems to be him who is. His body is shuddering every few seconds, teeth clenched together and eyes squeezed shut.
"Good. Two more bruises." He repeats the process with a bruise on Harry's jaw, and one just under his eye. Harry sits through the whole process, fidgeting with pent up energy, eyes going to different spots on Malfoy's body as he waits. When Malfoy tells him it's over, he sighs.
Malfoy lets out a loud sigh, closing his book with a snap. Harry glances up, his chin resting in his hand. He smiles bemusedly at the sight of Malfoy, slumped down in his chair, his head lolling back. Those grey eyes were half lidded, and focused right on him.
A faint din of voices reaches Harry’s ears, and he shakes his head. He can’t be wandering around doing nothing when a war has just ended, when a part of him is gone. He turns right, walking towards the noise. It’s leading him towards the Great Hall. He reaches its door, stopping just outside, not wanting to enter. The room is full of bodies.
After what seems like hours, Harry and the unknown person were inside the castle. They are in a room- it smells like fire and ash.
“Harry!” she exclaimed. She grabbed a handful of her silky periwinkle robes, holding them out of the way as she ran towards him. Harry’s stag peeked out slightly from behind the wall, dissolving into silver mist as its purpose had been fulfilled.
He steps gingerly into the room, setting his bag down on the floor, near the wall. Out of the way. He does the same to himself, folding his arms in and standing near the door, silent. His eyes continue to take in the room, picking up small details as Malfoy goes through his silent coping. He notices the blanket- it’s tucked in at the bottom of the bed, but left slightly messy near the pillows. He also sees that the bookshelf closest to him has what looks like only poetry books, including those by Shakespeare and Poe. This surprises Harry, and his eyebrows raise, his eyes darting to Malfoy.
“Yeah.” Harry is lost in thought for a moment, but feels compelled to speak again. Something in Malfoy is drawing the words out of him. “I think the first time I realized I loved red was when I was really little. I got a bright red scarf my cousin Dudley grew out of, and it was the warmest one I’d had. And I would tend to the fires for my family when I was a kid. I loved to stare into the flames. Wasn’t allowed to very often, but I savored it when I could. It was warm.” He hesitates, his jaw clenching slightly as he remembers his cupboard. “Hogwarts was warm too. Comfortable, and loving, and warm. So, yeah, I love red.” Harry smiles ruefully at nothing, feeling Malfoy’s gaze on him. “Not just for house pride.”
Long, tense minutes pass. Harry gets more and more on edge, pacing the room.After what feels like a lifetime, the fireplace roars with green flames. They lick up the brick before fading away to reveal Malfoy, whose face is shadowed. There’s a new scrape on his cheek, red and aggravated, and what looks like the beginnings of a bruise.
He sighs, and gingerly retracts his arm from Malfoy’s grip. He stretches. Unsatisfied, and with an ache still in his lower back and shoulders, he slides carefully out of the large bed- the side Malfoy wasn’t sleeping soundly on.
He’s hit with dizziness, and stumbles forward, the force of standing up and gravity getting the better of him. He’s stopped roughly by long-fingered hands grabbing his arms, digging into them slightly, and his head thumps, hard, into Malfoy’s chin, forcing a pained breath out of the taller boy and fully stopping Harry.
“Yes.”
Malfoy stares blankly at Harry, his eyes completely empty. Harry's eyes widen in response, as he realizes the implications of what he'd said. He opens his mouth, grasping for the right thing to say, or anything at all, but can find nothing. After an agonizing few seconds, Malfoy breaks his gaze, staring intently at the floor, away from Harry.
Malfoy’s voice is slightly amused, but still sounds serious.
Harry reached behind him with one hand, trying to find his wand on the floor while still holding the open wound shut. His hand was covered in blood, making it slippery, and he wouldn’t be able to get a grasp on his wand even if he could find it.
He'd never seen that before.
“Malfoy-”
Harry collapses, wand dropping from his bloody hand: he is exhausted. Sweat-dampened, messy black curls stick to his neck and forehead, pink lips bloodied and bitten, eyes hardly able to open, weighed down like bricks.
“How do you expect to do that? In the Restricted Section of the school library?” Harry scoffs.
There’s a desk, covered with papers and books, all coated in a thick layer of dust. A window sits directly behind the desk, casting the room in soft light.
The boy’s silver eyes were barely visible. His eyelids fluttered, the normally bright pupils a blanched grey.
“Malfoy?” Harry said, quietly. Fear colored his voice.
Harry’s discovered Draco’s plan...by walking straight into it. It’s on him to help, and though he hates the git, he can’t let him fade away.
"There we go. You're okay. You're gonna be okay." The voice mutters quiet missives, almost too quiet for Harry to hear, and Harry realizes he can't hear anything but that voice. He pulls away, just the smallest bit, looking around them. A man holds him, and around them is an almost clear bubble, silver veins of magic running through it.
"I'm going to heal from the top down, alright?"
“Harry?” a feminine voice called, panicked.
“Potter?” Malfoy says, his voice scratchy and low. “Do you need something? Food? Why are you…” He squints at the man crouched at his feet, his eyes slowly becoming more focused. “Why are you out of the bloody bed?”
Harry drops onto the boy’s bed, sighing. What is he doing?
Harry shook himself slightly, pushing himself too quickly off the bed.
“You need to rest. Now.”
“No, you don’t,” Harry mutters. He’s left alone in the room for only a few seconds, again, before Malfoy sweeps back in.
Harry startles, turning back to the stairs and proceeding up them as Malfoy begins to walk again. They reach the second floor, where Malfoy turns down another hallway, finally stopping in front of one of the many nondescript doors.
I decided I didn’t want to wait to publish another chapter hahaha! There won’t be much focus on Pomfrey and the hospital stay, but that will be next chapter. If you have thoughts, please leave a comment!!
Bubbles cover the surface of the water. Its heat permeates Harry’s skin, almost painful. But somehow it’s relaxing, and Harry sinks in, taking a deep breath of the sweetly scented steam before he calls for Malfoy to enter.
i hope you enjoyed this chapter!!! (^.^') i've been sitting on it for a while, and it ended up being near double the length of my normal updates, around 1k words. this one is 2k plus some change!! they're finally making some progress on harry's little problem... but that won't do, will it :) draco's marvelous healer talents are going to get some more time in the spotlight next chapter! (can you tell i've been into sickfics lately)
The girl nodded and also let a small smile appear on her lips.
"Love." She said, a soft smile on her lips and approached the boy, hugging him.
He put the chocolate frog inside his mouth as the room fell in a dead silence, before exploding with loud noises and sentences, of course.
"I freaked out, i really didn't know what to do. In a second Blaise and I were talking, then i heard something and when i looked at you you were glaring at the ceiling, you were breathing so fast i thought you were... hell, i thought you were dying, Harry!" Theo said, he was shaking. His hands were shaking, the clear sign of how nervous he got because of... whatever had happened to Harry. The boy stayed in silence, his eyes were focusing on the floor while his thoughts were far from there.
"Oh, for Merlin's sake! Harry!" They heard suddenly, and then, Harry felt warm - and safe, oh Merlin, so safe - arms around him. Draco was hugging him.
"Today we're going on our date." The boy couldn't help it, he was happy and excited to spend the entire day only with his boy. And honestly, the younger one felt the same way, but he was too sleepy still.
"When Harry said that earlier... About us knowing who he thinks did this, who do you think it is?" Theo asked, taking a sip from his drink.
"They're not here..." The others looked at the table too.
"I love you, too." They rubbed their lips, before kissing each other softly.
"Fuck... i love this strawberry cake." Harry mumbled, his mouth full.
"Oh, that's a good thing, right?" Harry asked again and Dumbledore sighed, a blank expression on his face.
"I'm okay. I'm sorry, love. I'm sorry." Harry held his face softly and smiled, before kissing his lips.
"Bubble-head charm!"
Why did he have to be part of this tournament? Why did he have to let his boyfriend underwater for one hour? What if he drowns? What if he gets hurt? What if Harry can't swim and be fast enough to save him? What if he lose him? What the fuck. No, no, no, he wouldn't - he couldn't! - lose Draco. Not now. Not ever.
He wished he could feel like that all the time.
"As usual."
When Harry and Draco told about the first task to Lily, James, Lucius, Narcissa, Sirius and Remus they were mad. At the old man - Dumbledore -, of course, but they were mad. Sirius, Lily, James and Narcissa called him all kind of bad things they could even think, Draco laughed his ass off hearing it, Harry did too. It was funny to tell them somehow, even though it was a bad situation. Umbridge was still her, except that now, people were playing pranks around the castle to piss her off, and it was working fine till now. People got a lot of detention, but they always said it was the most boring kind of detention - it was literally to sit the hell down and read 'Hogwarts: a History' and write down important details -.
“The door, I cannot explain,” Potter says slowly, before letting out a long sigh, and then curses under his breath. “I need to go question the students who found her, along with the prefects who were patrolling the corridors – perhaps one of them saw something that could help us with this.”
“Did you leave your compartment at any point?”
and him, knowing how she must’ve felt like after James had treated her so badly in the party. Albus on the other hand, hadn’t apparently known about what had happened between his brother and his friend, and had thought that Travers had merely spoken ill about Albus. Or, perhaps, it was what Scorpius had insisted to Albus, Harry thinks. Albus hadn’t even known that Scorpius had originally told Quinn that Travers had been threatening to spread false lies about Scorpius and Albus, something that Harry had seen from Albus’s expression, when Quinn had asked about their relationship.
“What?” He asks bluntly, stopping in his tracks.
“Did you see anyone as you left her compartment? Did you see anyone walking towards, or into Travers’s compartment?” Quinn asks calmly.
He walks to his coat rack and sees his reflection from the window beside it. He’s in a desperate need of a haircut. And a shave, Harry adds to himself in his mind as he scratches his holiday beard. Ginny used to cut his hair, and now that she hasn’t, Harry has let it grow to his shoulders. He keeps it tied back in a bun at the nape of his neck. Something his fourteen-year-old daughter teasingly calls a ‘man bun’. Harry snorts inwardly as he thinks about her; the small girl with her fiery red hair and spirit, and the fact that Harry will be utterly ruled over by her in a couple of years.
“About what happened at the party?” Quinn asks, his eyes moving over Albus’s face. “Between you and Scorpius?”
Harry’s steely gaze briefly meets Moonstone’s, before he focuses back to the boy. “What happened after you left her…in the compartment?” Harry asks, wondering if Riley was the last person who saw her alive.
Draco inclines his head slightly, knowing Potter is right, knowing that he himself wants to know the truth, but is nevertheless irritated by the bright, righteous expression on the bespectacled saviour’s face.
“FUUUCK!” James screams, slumping down to the floor, panting, at the precise moment when their father, their mother, and the Headmistress arrive to the scene.
“Sir,” Parkinson says as soon as Harry is closer to him. The two students give them hesitant looks and slowly take their leave. After they are outside hearing distance, Parkinson continues, “Nothing out of ordinary here. All students under fifteen have been asked to go to their dormitories. Smith is currently with Slughorn, in the middle of his fourth Prefect interview,” Parkinson tells Harry promptly.
party. Albus grits his teeth together.
He empties his mind and walks inside the classroom behind Quinn and gives his son a reassuring smile, before taking a seat next to him. “You’re doing all right, son,” He murmurs, squeezing James’s shoulder. James’s jaw is tight, and he doesn’t look at Harry, but gives back a small, jerky nod.
Scorpius’s jaw tightens. “We’ll just tell them what happened; she bothered me about you, you told her and Riley to sod off,” he says tensely.
“Did you see Travers after the occurrence in the corridor between you, Albus, Travers and Riley?” Quinn asks, taking notes.
He takes in an exasperated breath. “Scott…Pamela…why did you lie to the Aurors? To…to – what? To
“Sir?” Berrycloth presses on.
Potter clears his throat. “And due to that, I decided that we should question James under Veritaserum as well.”
Harry shakes his head in exasperation, shoves Ron lightly, feeling a bit better. Soon, Hermione and Rose join them, and it is time for Rose’s questioning.
Potter looks at the table, his jaw tightening slightly. “Yes and no,” He finally says with a weary voice. “She knows what happened,” he says, looking at Draco, who had already figured out that bit, “But there were other…issues,” He says with a small grimace. “I suppose the…thing…at the pub was just the last straw – something we’d been, well,
“I’ll handle it, Harry. Just go there, and do your job,” Hermione says firmly, placing a hand on his shoulder. “I need to go now.”
He crouches over the book to take a better look at it.
“Anything I can help you with?” Moonstone asks, taking a sip himself after taking his seat behind his desk.
“Then what are we waiting for?” He breathes, before tracing Malfoy’s lips with his tongue. “Let’s go back to the pub…”
He shoves one of the sandwiches down, as he starts to scribble down the report, occasionally glancing through his notes.
Potter pulls the book closer, closes it and flicks his wand at it, checking it for any traces of magic. Draco already knows there are none.
It is now past dinnertime, and everyone, who had come forth about seeing Travers during their train ride, has been questioned.
you doing in here?” He asks, out of the blue, a hint of sharpness in his voice.
Harry gives a quick shake of his head. “The train driver and the trolley lady were both questioned. They had not seen or heard anything abnormal. The train wards were not breached by outsiders,” he says, and Smith, along with several others, seem slightly disappointed.
The corners of Peele’s lips quirk up a bit. Harry thinks Peele was brilliant, truth to be told. Harry rarely watches his Aurors training drills due to his workload, but today, he made the exception.
Ginny gasps, her anger faltering.
He lets out another sigh, knowing that there is no use to continue sorting out his mess of a desk when he is feeling so tired. Standing up, Harry stretches his back and briefly wonders if he remembered to eat lunch during the day. Based on the growling sound in his stomach, he thinks not.
“What?” Albus asks with a tight voice.
“Hello, James,” Quinn says with a small smile.
Harry stares at his back, watching the infuriating and impossibly handsome wizard, feeling bewildered, feeling light, and wonders, if they will make it through without strangling one another in the process.
“Yes, I can. They’re all here,” Scorpius tells him quietly, his sharp eyes moving across the Hall.
Albus’s eyes widen in surprise and interest.
Rose lets out a shocked gasp, her cheeks flushing red, a hurt look in her blue eyes.
Harry can hear Ginny letting out a sharp breath.
Harry gives a nod to the Headmistress. “If there is nothing else, I will head up to the Gryffindor Tower to inform James that he too will be questioned under Veritaserum tomorrow,” Harry says wearily.
Albus murmurs his good nights and jumps into his own bed, lying on his back and staring at the canopy. Why would Scorpius get mad at him for interrupting the argument between his friend and Travers on the train, if they had only been talking about Albus?
Draco watches as Potter sits heavily across him, fiddling the bottle while staring at the table.
but then again, so had Travers, with how she had treated Albus, as well as spreading awful rumours about Harry and his son on the train, in the beginning of their holidays.
“Why?” Harry asks, curiously, stopping close to him.
Enjoy! :) (with typos and all)
The silence is interrupted by a sudden appearance of a silver crow, which, quite easily, manages to scare the shit out of both Draco and Potter.
! You’re acting like you – like you
“What did you tell them, just now? Did you tell them the truth about what happened on the train? That I was there, and I was the one who told Riley and Travers to sod off?” Albus asks, forcing his voice to stay calm.
“Then –”
Albus gives his father a disbelieving look. “You really don’t have a clue,” He mutters with annoyance.
Potter lifts a hand up. “Hold on,” he says with a low voice and a deep frown. Everyone turns to look at him. “I questioned Miss Westen. And she didn’t mention anything about this argument. Neither did Riley.” Potter says, glancing at Quinn. The other Auror gives him a confirmative nod.
Scorpius blew Albus off in the train, after – well, after their row
It is later in the morning, but the breakfast is still being served, and Harry watches as Miss Scott and Miss Westen leave the Entrance Hall together, moving towards the Great Hall, both fidgeting slightly – a somewhat mild aftereffect of Veritaserum, before he turns to the irritated and concerned parents.
Albus lets out a small scoff. “I can’t believe he thinks he can be angry about…about anything! I mean, after what he did at the party, after sticking his nose into my business – I mean, I’m the one who’s entitled to be angry, if someone is!” he growls. “Right?”
“Shit, Scor, can you see –” He breathes unsteadily, his hands trembling.
Berrycloth – the only one who Draco has actually exchanged words with, as he was the one who sealed the train after Draco had wrapped up for the day and sent the body with a Portkey to his colleagues at the wizarding morgue – levitates a large tray behind him, placing it on one the side tables before casting a stasis charm to the several plates of food. He then takes the seat next to Potter.
An hour later, they are finishing their breakfast in the private chamber, both the courtesy of Ms Bones – who Draco hasn’t really spoken to, not in school or after the war, but wonders how she ended up here, to run the pub. She seems friendly enough with Potter, and when Weasley arrives, with him as well.
His contemplation is disturbed by an uproar of laughter originating from, where else, but the Gryffindor table.
, Draco thinks,
The barrel turns into a narrow and low passage going upwards. Harry nods at Quinn and Higgins before they enter, one behind the other, ending up into the cosy and round common room decorated with bright yellow and black and with several tables and chairs here and there as well as with plants and flowers hanging from the walls and the ceiling.
I've written already a lot, but I need to tweak it somewhat before I can post (to get all the mysterious little details in!).
Riley grits his teeth together. “I’ve told you everything I know.”
There’s a sharp knock on the door before it opens. Quinn and Riley step inside. Harry stands up from his seat while Moonstone flicks his wand to clear his table from teacups.
Albus continues, shaking his head in bewilderment. “What does she think about your doings?”
Albus digests his words. “Because she thinks that? Because you think that?” He asks, not really sure if he’s ready to hear James’s answer.
“What next?” She asks quietly.
Albus lets out a snarl of exasperation, feels his cheeks flush red, feels the tightness in his chest wavering, but he doesn’t give his brother the satisfaction of knowing exactly what the hell is going on in Albus’s head – even though, he kind of gives it as he turns his back to James, and starts scrubbing the bedpans with a furious determination, in order to finish as soon as possible, so that he will be released and so that he doesn’t have to see James’s irritating face again.
James nods at Quinn. “Laurean.” James says easily. Quinn’s lips twitch.
Bloody Ginny. She had told her. Of course, she had told her.
“Oh.” Moonstone says very quietly. “I’m…I’m very sorry to hear that. How did the kids take it?” He asks, and when Harry looks back at him, he sees Moonstone watching him with a deep frown.
Moonstone pats him on the shoulder. “You can tell us, Nate. The other students will not find out what is spoken in this room,” he says gently.
Harry suppresses a large yawn as he walks briskly towards the village. It is dark and cold and the snow glittering on the ground and the trees creates shadows in the moonlight. He has left the Map to Prone who will be in charge of the Aurors stationed in the school during the night.
“No.”
Harry takes in a deep breath. “Miss Travers had many friends, but as most of us, one could not be in friendly terms with everyone,” Harry explains. “She had some arguments with occasional students. Quite normal arguments – the sort that comes with being a teenager.”
Malfoy looks unaffected by Ginny’s spiteful tone, and merely gives her a blank look before turning towards Harry. “Quinn said you wanted to speak to me, Potter,” he says simply.
Draco wants to give Potter a couple of carefully selected sharp words, as he completely agrees; even if the kids are old enough to be alone at home, he too thinks this all stemmed from the party – from the dispute between James Potter and Jenna Travers, and perhaps something else as well. But looking at the man now, and seeing how exhausted he looks, Draco takes pity on him, and decides to incline his head in agreement.
Harry sighs, looking out from the window, to the snowy landscape. His sons should be enjoying the weather after their classes, and not be questioned for murder. Still, if there is a way to speed things up, he knows it is with Veritaserum. And if Albus truly has spoken the truth, wouldn’t it be better to question him once more, and be done with it?
Harry feels a flicker of amusement, and briefly wonders how many times he has actually visited the office, both during McGonagall’s time and Moonstone’s. “I believe so,” he merely says, and then clears his expression before glancing at the group of three students. “Is Miss Westen there?” He asks from Neville, who confirms Harry’s assumption with an agreeing gesture.
He turns and gives James; who looks mildly disappointed, a small smile. “I’ll see you in the morning, James,” he says, voice softer now.
Albus presses his teeth together, feeling angry, feeling betrayed. The unfairness of the situation is making his stomach roil. He moves his gaze away from his brother. Because he might take a swing at him.
Harry huffs out a short laugh. “I know.” He looks at Malfoy for a long while, his eyes moving over the sharp angles of his face, the aristocratic and somewhat arrogant features, thinking of their past; as rivals and enemies during their childhood, and remembers how it started to change – how Malfoy wasn’t suddenly sneering at Harry every time their paths had crossed, how they had started to greet one another, whenever their eyes met. Knowing that growing up had a lot to do with it. Knowing, that both Astoria and Scorpius had been important factors as well.
Quinn looks James silently for a moment. “But she came?”
He wonders, how Albus will take it?
Harry is alone, his mind reeling. He knows he can’t think of what is happening between his sons and Scorpius, since he has a murder investigation going on. He knows he needs to focus and make himself ready to question the handful of students still, before he can think of other things.
“Sir,” Quinn says pointedly.
Pamela Scott’s version of the events had changed between the two interrogations. Why would she first claim that Scorpius was the one having an argument with Travers on the train, and then the next day say that Albus had been there with him? Is it possible that someone had told her to say such things? She hadn’t given Harry any explanation for her lies, and merely claimed that she had forgot the details. Harry doesn’t really buy that.
Scorpius gives Albus a quick glance. “Hey,” he says absently.
The mealtime is over quickly, too soon on Albus’s opinion. Albus and Scorpius leave their friends to enjoy their free time, and make their way towards the unused classroom in the Entrance Hall – the one they were instructed to come to after breakfast.
James sighs desperately, running a hand through his hair.
He knows that Scorpius doesn’t get along with his father that well, and that his friend hasn’t really spent time with the man after his mother passed away a couple of years ago. It has always been either Albus staying with them, or Scorpius with the Potters. Mostly the latter way.
Harry sees the tension between Hermione’s shoulders, and the worry in Ron’s eyes.
“…And, as I was returning back to my compartment, I saw her – Jenna,” Rose says, her voice calm, the words flowing out of her in a steady stream.
were you thinking, screwing around with my brother?”
“Bloody hell, James!” They father hisses, his eyes widening in dread as he sees and interprets James’s expression. “You organised a party
Albus’s father shakes his head at her. “Ginny.” Albus knows there’s a warning in his tone, but he couldn’t care less.
a party? I suppose you were all sober at this party, hm?” He asks, lifting his brows James’s, who fidgets in his seat.
James too resumes to his scrubbing task, and Albus breathes heavily, his mind whirling.
Draco listens carefully as the blonde Auror goes through his son’s questioning.
“How long did you stay there?” Quinn asks, after scribbling the details down.
She nods slowly. “I know.”
Their father shakes his head to James. “Of course not. But all of you might have valuable information for the investigation. We need to know everything that has happened between all of you and Miss Travers. You can help us to figure this out, to find the reason for her death.”
“I need to talk to Malfoy, to see the train again. Perhaps it’ll help, if nothing else comes up before that,” Harry says wearily.
His cousin stares at him.
“And after the party? You saw her? Talked to her?” Quinn asks.
“Did she threaten to reveal your personal matters to others?”
Potter narrows his eyes again at the girl. “It is possible that she merely locked the door to change into her robes,” he says, glancing at the neat pile of school robes on the opposite bench, “and then she…slipped and hit her head to the bench.”
Draco makes it to the hallway, and just as he wonders which of the doors is the bathroom, someone trudges up the stairs.
Harry glances at Quinn, and sees how he too looks completely taken aback.
Lily frowns, and then, presses against Harry, her head tight against his chest. And Harry, he feels like a weight has been lifted from his chest, only to be replaced by another – the worry for his children, the worry about the future. He’ll keep his word to her, of course he will, but…but that doesn’t mean he’s not scared about what will happen to them.
Travers?” He says before he can stop himself.
Scorpius swallows convulsively, his throat bobbing. He looks away, his jaw tightening, his cheeks colouring. He’s embarrassed. Or, perhaps he is afraid to admit it to Albus – why it matters to Scorpius.
There’s a long silence, during which Albus tries to steady his breath, tries to close his mind, and tries not to feel at all. Because if he does, he’s not sure if he can bear it – not there, in the middle of the grounds, in front of everyone. What he needs, is to be alone.
“What is going on?” Ginny asks incredulously, and Quinn merely gives her a pointed look, before turning his focus on Albus.
Hermione looks terrified; her hair, the usual neat hairdo is all over the place, reminding Harry of their Hogwarts days. Her eyes are shining with tears and her hands are shaking.
, 2006.”
, and then you fucking lied about it afterwards!” Albus yells, almost panting.
They weren’t going to, originally, but then Rose had been questioned and she hadn’t been sure if it had been thirty minutes she had spent with James on the train, or less. And Harry knows, that if there hadn’t been an incident between James and Travers at the party during New Year’s Eve, he wouldn’t have been questioned at all.
Albus thinks for a bit if he ought to do something about what happened during the holidays – with her – but eventually decides to ponder it later, when he’s in the privacy of his own four-poster bed, and proceeds to join in the conversation with his dormmates.
Harry greets Fox and gives his son a reassuring smile.
Harry frowns at her. “We need a Portkey – and we need to investigate Hogsmeade, as well as the station.”
Harry paces in front of the classroom in the Entrance Hall, waiting for his Aurors to step inside, to go over the situation, to try to make sense of the slim evidence they’ve got. Both Quinn and Smith are already there, having been questioning students with Harry since this morning, both standing rigidly in place, and not minding one bit that their boss is moving there, with an anxious expression, huffing occasional words under his breath.
after being in the headlines for
“Perhaps one of mine could join each house?” Harry asks and glances at the Aurors before giving McGonagall a questioning look.
“One of the students had met Miss Travers in the corridor, less than an hour before her death. The student had described Miss Travers as ‘distressed’, as they were questioned under Veritaserum. Then, the same student had helped Miss Travers – had lent her a book to replace the one that had fallen under a prank of their schoolmates,” Harry says, and there’s a pause, as he thinks of his and Malfoy’s conversation in the compartment, “Then, fifteen minutes later – as the same student had stopped by at Miss Travers’s compartment with the book – they described Miss Travers to be quite a lot calmer and in perfect health, when leaving Miss Travers’s company and returning to their own compartment.”
“Who indeed,” Scorpius murmurs, the contempt evident in his voice.
exactly?!” She shrieks, staring at Albus with an outraged look.
After the encounter in the corridor, Scorpius had stayed away from Albus for the rest of the ride. It wasn’t until they had reached Hogsmeade, that Albus had found his friend at the carriages, looking grim. Albus had apologised, even though he wasn’t sure
“However, you have been seen with her in the recent past. Have been seen having an argument,” he says to James, “or,” He mutters, looking at Albus, something close to disappointment in his eyes, “having a relationship with the girl.”
Ron walks up to Harry and pulls him into a bear hug. “They’re all right, mate,” He murmurs into Harry’s ear, and Harry knows that Ron was, and still probably is, as worried as he has been.
Rose answers without a pause, “Because I like to read ahead.”
As the parents leave the Entrance Hall, Harry lets out a long breath, and walks to the front doors, stepping outside. He breathes in the cold air, hoping it will clear his head. His mind is working furiously, putting together what he knows and what he has observed, moving the pieces to their correct spots in the timeline.
Quinn starts with Albus exactly the same way as he did with the others earlier. Harry and Ginny sit next to Albus, as Quinn asks him to state his name and birthday, as he asks Albus to go over the train ride and asks about the row in the train corridor.
Berrycloth clears his throat loudly and turns to look at Potter, who is still standing next to the side table. “Sir – may I suggest that you assign one of us to question both of your boys? It would be better to take care of it without delay, even more so, since there are inconsistencies in the students’ statements, so that we can move on with the investigation as smoothly and quickly as possible.”
Scorpius lets out a long huff of breath, rubbing his face, before looking at Albus, regret and shock still edged on his face. “I didn’t m –”
James lifts his chin and looks at Quinn, “I’m not proud of what I did, but she was a b…I mean, many people disliked her,” James says simply.
Seconds later, all Aurors land with a collective thud, still gracefully on their feet, in front of the school gates. Headmistress McGonagall stands there waiting, along with Neville Longbottom.
“Why would you think that?” Scorpius mutters quietly, focusing on his books again.
Albus lifts his brows at him. “Really, Zabini?” He says with a bored voice. He’s very fond of his friends, but sometimes, they can be complete wankers.
Potter heads to the side table after the door has clicked shut, picking up a bottle of Butterbeer.
The Patronus disappears, and Potter sighs, casting his own silvery stag, and sends a quick message back to Fungbury to thank him for the information, adding that he’s still at the scene with Draco, and that they will both return later.
A deep frown pulls itself between Quinn’s brows. Harry feels as confused as Albus looks. How the hell could one of them lie during a questioning under Veritaserum? There has to be an explanation. It simply cannot be possible.
Rose lets out a huff of breath, frowning at him. “He didn’t look good, Al. Perhaps I should go and –”
It takes about thirty seconds for Albus to realise what exactly has happened. Yes, he was suspecting that Scott was the one who had told the Aurors that it was only Scorpius who had been having a row with Travers. But now he understands why.
“None of them, nor the two students we questioned yesterday under Veritaserum; Nate Riley and Pamela Scott, had any knowledge, of what had happened to Jenna Travers – nor did they have anything to do with her death. All of them confirmed it, under Veritaserum. In addition, all of them confirmed that they did not know of anyone else, who would have had anything to do with Travers’s death,” Harry explains to the twelve blank faces.
Albus’s lips twist into a rueful smile, but he doesn’t look at his father. He keeps his eyes at the floor as he speaks. “I dunno, dad,” He finally says, thinking back when he realised what was happening between his parents. It was last summer – which to Albus, feels like a lifetime ago. Everything had been different then. Scorpius had spent some of his holiday at the Potters, and everything had been…
“What?” Harry asks frantically, all kinds of possibilities running in his mind.
Harry calls it the ‘Auror face’.
“Does Ron know?” Harry asks, finally glancing at her, a cringe on his expression.
“Why the hell did you do this?! Now they’re questioning me
Right as he’s buttoning up his robes, getting ready to leave towards his empty home, someone barges into his office.
Harry smiles at him. “Good duelling today. Bones is a tough lady.”
Mr Malfoy is about to say something to his son, when the door to the classroom opens. Albus’s father walks out with one of the Aurors. Auror Quinn – Albus thinks, remembering the man from one of his visits to the Auror office.
The Headmistress stands up and gestures for them to move forward. “Good morning, Mr Malfoy. Mr Potter. Cassius,” She says and flicks her wand to conjure a set of straight-backed chairs – similar to the ones already occupied – in front of her desk. “Please, sit down.”
Mrs Scott sighs disappointedly, Mr Westen shakes his head in dissatisfaction, but Mrs Westen, at least, gives Harry an understanding nod. “Of course, Auror Potter,” she says, glancing at her fellow parents. “We just have to trust that our children are safe, under the protection of the Auror Office, as well as the school teachers,” she says pointedly, aiming her words at her husband and Mrs Scott – who both seem to calm down a bit.
His father gives him a tired smile. “Hey Al. You okay?” He asks, nudging his jaw towards one of the seats lining the walls. “Do you have a moment?”
“Figures…” Zachary mutters under his breath.
exactly he was apologising for. That had helped to make Scorpius relax a bit. But now, Albus is wondering if Scorpius is still distressed about something.
“Could the dose of sedatives have made it impossible for her to summon help?” Potter asks slowly.
” Harry grits out, giving Ginny a pointed look. Even though Ginny speaks about them both, it certainly feels she’s somehow blaming him for all of it.
”Potter.” Draco mutters, watching the other man carefully.
“Did you know that it stopped when our sons became friends?” Malfoy asks, his eyes searching Harry’s. “That after everyone had seen the paper, or heard that the Chosen One and his children were associating with the Malfoys and were in friendly terms, the rumours stopped?”
Albus gives his friend a slightly maniacally triumphant look. “
Harry knows that the two of them are somewhat acquainted, as both of them are Quidditch fanatics, and have shared many conversations about the sport whenever James has stopped by the Ministry during the school holidays.
“Yes,” he grits through his teeth, feeling lightheaded, feeling aroused as fuck.
He sighs, casting another warming charm around him. He only wants to be alone. He doesn’t want to go to enjoy the day without school, doesn’t want to go to say goodbye to his mum or dad. He wants the day to be over, and the next. And the one after that.
“Do you regret it?” Hermione asks, her eyes moving over his face, “Whatever it was that happened between you and Draco that night?”
“Don’t fucking say you didn’t
Harry holds his breath, staring at James intently.
Harry watches him closely. “And you? Were you different?” He asks, not unkindly, but trying to picture the situation, knowing that how Scorpius was when his mother lived, was different from how the boy seems to be now, but knowing that a large part of it is being a teenager.
“There is something you should know.” Malfoy says, to little avail, as he opens it at the same time, and Harry sees it. The inscription inside the book.
That they are working together to solve a possible murder. And that – that after the pub, Potter disappeared. He didn’t floo Draco. He didn’t owl him. He just went back to his wife. Back to his family.
Quinn clears his throat a couple of times, and definitely avoids Albus’s mothers sharp glare. Albus can relate to that. She can be somewhat frightening. “So…you…” Quinn clears his throat again, glancing at his notes, “You were in bad terms?”
Harry detects shocked looks and some murmuring, but everyone is quick on their moves to unholster their wands and switch into their Auror gear; a uniform charmed with basic defensive spells to throw off some of the milder hexes and jinxes. After a short moment, the group of Aurors grab the rope, one by one, before the Portkey starts to glow in blue, indicating that it will be soon activated.
Aaand more questionings + drama, you're welcome ;)
Harry smiles tightly and turns back towards his son, to see Albus and Scorpius, and a handful of others watching him with anxious and curious looks.
Albus arches a brow at him. Why would Scorpius act like this when his father is mentioned? Is he afraid to see him? “Your father? Isn’t he the Crime Scene Investigator?”
Harry doesn’t know what to think anymore. He puts his glasses on the table in front of him and presses the heels of his palms against his eyes, trying to sort out his thoughts.
“I dunno. That is why your father is here, I suppose,” Scorpius says dismissively, and then turns his gaze at the book, flicking through the pages.
James doesn’t have time to react, before Albus has flipped up his wand, and aimed a wordless tripping jinx at his brother, glaring at him as James splutters and yells in surprise, and slips from his feet, tumbling down the stairs.
Unfortunately, the Headmistress has their wands.
Quinn clears his throat loudly. “Sir.” He says tightly, interrupting Harry. Even Ginny’s staring at Harry in disbelief.
He hisses, giving a sour look at Albus, who bristles at his brother’s words.
Albus frowns ahead, bewildered. Why does Scorpius sound so…anxious? Why does he need to talk to James? Albus listens attentively, feeling like a complete stalker as he leans against the wall around the corner, close to the classroom, the door of which has apparently been left open.
But based on Weasley’s behaviour last night, Draco knows he ought not to relay on wishful thinking on the incident being truly forgotten.
“Good night, Albus,” Scorpius says behind the thick, green fabric.
Albus rolls his eyes. “Yes, we
okay with that?” Albus asks slowly, his voice dark.
“Dad?” Albus asks, his eyes moving fast between Harry’s. “What’s going on? Is there a mu – “
Harry wants to yell at the top of his lungs. He never wanted it; the fame, people fawning over him. He never wanted any of that for himself, and definitely not for his children. How did Albus describe it? Fifteen minutes of fame, was it? That witches – underage girls – want to… want to
“Something’s happened, Harry,” Hermione says, her voice trembling.
“What…?” Potter mutters, staring at the table and looking utterly taken aback. “Albus…Albus –
Auror Smith clears his throat on Berrycloth’s other side. “Sir,” he says with a small grimace. “There’s something you might want to hear about your other son,” he says, and Potter’s eyes widen, almost comically.
The children had taken it as well as one would, when hearing that their parents were going to split up – even though Harry suspected that both James and Albus already knew. Harry and Ginny had assured James, Albus and Lily that they would still be in their lives, and that their love for their children had not changed. But that their love for each other had changed, into a different sort of love.
“…Was there anything out of ordinary in Travers’s behaviour?”
Then, after a short, baffling silence, Harry has a suspicion. A quite bothersome suspicion, in fact. “Quinn?” Harry asks almost wearily.
I lied before. And now…they think someone told me to say you were there,” she says quietly, not looking at Albus.
, Rose!” Albus suddenly grits out, glaring at his cousin. “Stop thinking that you’re gonna be anything more than a friend to him!” He yells, realising how hysterical he sounds. Realising that he’s breathing heavily. He feels like he might be suffocating.
“What?” Harry asks, knowing exactly what Moonstone is doing. What he’s always doing – always trying to read people, to figure them out.
“She saw you?” Quinn asks, his voice tight, his expression quite uncomfortable, presumably having a good idea of what Travers saw.
James looks ahead, at the white courtyard, at the untouched snow in front of them. “Yeah.” He says quietly, a small frown between his brows. “Don’t know if there’ll be a future for us…”
Their holiday wasn’t the most brilliant one, at least nothing like last year. But it wasn’t that bad.
Hermione eyes him with a pointed look, a knowing look, and then, Harry realises. “You
“Oh?” Quinn asks, “What did she say?”
Scorpius gives Albus a thoughtful look. “Perhaps she wishes to know if we saw anything,” he says quietly.
Harry splutters slightly, glares at the bird that is long gone from his sight, and sits down at the kitchen table, tearing the letter open with trembling fingers, somewhat dreading what Draco has written to him.
“Has anyone else been hurt?” He asks from Hermione as they walk out of his office and towards the space with empty cubicles. Harry’s glad he hasn’t eaten anything, as his stomach twists with nausea.
“…They aim to – to sleep with my son, because –” Potter says, his eyes wide with incredulity, his voice rough, “– because he looks like me.”
“Look, Al…I knew, yeah. That…you fancy him, or something,” James says quietly, a grimace on his lips. “I wasn’t sure then, but I had my doubts, and I didn’t mean it to happen, I swear it – you know we were both plastered,” James mutters, a strained look on his face. “I regret it happened, because after…I knew you’d be hurt.” He sighs, and adds with a small incline of his head, “You and Char both.”
The Aurors go over the results of their interrogations once more, trying to form a timeline based on the Prefects’ answers. Most of them eat, but Draco cannot stomach even the idea of food. All he can think of is his son. What is going on with Scorpius? What will happen to him?
Draco’s eyes find Potter’s – Harry’s – and he inclines his head to the door. “Until tomorrow,” he murmurs and then takes his notes and makes his way out of the room.
“What do you mean, does he know that?” James asks, an eye roll in his voice. “He should. I asked him to shut up about it.”
“Surely it wasn’t that bad!” Ginny says in outrage.
Harry feels equally ashamed that he didn’t – that he and Ginny kept it from their children in the first place. They had the right to know. “I’m sorry. We should’ve told you,” He says letting out a long breath. “You deserved the truth. At least, at the point when we had made our decision.”
He gives her a shrug. “Yeah. Why wouldn’t it be?”
“Thank you, Headmistress,” Harry says before turning to his team of Aurors assigned to the school. “You know the drill.”
“What do you think?” Scorpius asks impatiently, and Albus can picture clearly Scorpius rolling his eyes in exasperation. “I trust you heard about the questioning they’re doing tomorrow?” Scorpius continues tightly. “And if they ask the right questions, you know what they’ll find out.”
“Why do you think Miss Scott thought you needed protection? Why would she lie and tell us that you weren’t there?” Quinn asks, watching Albus carefully.
Albus curses inwardly, hating himself a little for being so jealous, for feeling so betrayed, that he has become a shitty friend to Scorpius. He forces all the miserable and confusing thoughts into the darkest corner of his mind, wills himself to stay blank before he faces the greyness of Scorpius’s gaze.
James sends a mild slicing hex towards him, which cuts Albus’s lip.
Bones shakes her head, an expressionless look on her face. “Nothing unusual on the grounds or inside the school.
“Dad…” Albus mutters, feeling somewhat relieved that his father is coming there, and knowing that everything will be all right then. His father is good at what he does.
Draco twitches slightly at the name. The bloody Prince Charming – something Scorpius has taught him; a character in a Muggle children’s story, and where his son has even found such Muggle books, Draco doesn’t know – is going to question his son. Draco wants to ask Potter, why he assigned Quinn – is it because he is the best? Draco really fucking hopes so.
Harry has been thinking the same thing. Why get back at her several months later, if Albus and Travers hadn’t been in any contact between September and the end of December?
Molly is a seventh-year prefect, who Harry has heard, only narrowly lost the Head Girl title to her classmate Charlotte. And how does Harry know this? The answer would be James, who happens to date Charlotte. That said, Harry is not sure how much he should be trusting on what James tells him, as the boy is known from his mischief – enough so to make his two namesakes proud.
“Hermione!” Harry exclaims with surprise. And then, as Harry sees his friend’s expression, dread fills his chest. Something has happened. “Hermione, what is it?” Harry asks hurriedly, taking long, quick steps towards her.
“Could you talk it through once more?” Potter suddenly asks, and Draco rolls his eyes.
again.
Potter? A sixteen-year-old girl’s spell is weaker than the one cast by the Saviour of our world?” He asks, mockery dripping from his voice.
Harry sighs inwardly. He hates not knowing what he is up against. “We don’t know yet. Keep your head down and assume the worst,” he says with a grim smile.
Draco wonders briefly if the
“James Sirius Potter, April 2
He looks down, where his hand is still deep inside Draco’s trousers, holding Draco’s cock in a gentle grip. “Shit.”
“We did, didn’t we?” Albus asks pointedly. “I wonder what rubbish Riley has told them, if they’ve already talked to him…”
Harry gives her an incredulous look. “Of course not! I haven’t told anyone!”
Albus tells Quinn how he found Scorpius; with Travers bothering him and talking rubbish about Albus, and then Albus explains how he told her to bugger off.
Sooo...the rating is now changed. Some explicit stuff at the end ;)
Harry’s eyes widen, and he swallows tightly. “H-How?”
“Al?” Scorpius asks quietly, but rather…vehemently. And Albus knows he can’t avoid his friend, like he had done the previous night, when he had returned from his detention.
Albus turns his gaze back to his father, giving him a blank look. “I suppose they want to brag they’ve shagged the son of
“Naturally,” He murmurs wryly, and hears an amused huff from Potter’s direction.
Of course, the map is over forty years old, and as it was made for the amusement of four students, there could be errors. But it couldn’t hurt, Harry reckons.
Albus doesn’t spare a glance at the three Hufflepuffs, and instead makes his way towards Scorpius’s father, making Scorpius follow him, since there is no way the blonde Slytherin would go to stand with the Scotts and Westen – or alone.
“Thank you for joining me,” Harry speaks to the crowd: to Travers’s family, to all of his Aurors who have been working with the case, to all of the teaching staff, to the Headmistress, to Malfoy, and to Hermione as the Head of the DMLE, and to the Minister for Magic and a handful of his secretaries.
Harry thinks, swallowing deeply. Something incredible happened, something, he hadn’t even thought could be possible. He shakes his head. “No.”
…” Harry groans. “Feels so fucking good…”
Andd, were back! Have at it! (and let me know what you thought of this chapter ;) )
Draco doesn’t think that neither James nor Albus had anything to do with Miss Travers’s death. They would’ve reached out to their father for help. He knows them – well, Albus, more like – well enough to make the presumption. He can only hope his own son would act similarly and come to him in a tight situation. But he unfortunately knows Scorpius well too. Draco would probably be the last person Scorpius would ask help from. Well, perhaps Lucius is, Draco thinks ruefully.
Teddy quickly swallowed a mouthful of blackcurrant crumble before grinning up at Andromeda. “Goodbye, Nana! Say hello to Aunt Cissy for me.”
In the possession…
She looked up as he approached, hazel eyes widening as she immediately recognized him. “Mr. Potter, sir!”
“Fuck,” he whimpered, fingers digging into Draco’s shoulders as sharp teeth grazed the delicate skin of his neck, biting into the flesh and
Draco squeezed his hand and spun, Disapparating them all away.
“Thank you,” Harry said sharply, turning to make his way toward Room 7. He ran a hand gently over Teddy’s back as he strode down the hallway, whispering soothing words in an effort to calm his godson’s whimpers.
In the pleasure.
Harry could not stop the grin from spreading across his face. He glanced down, teeth at his lower lip before releasing it and stepping towards Malfoy, “Well, then. Show me what you’ve got, Malfoy.”
It’s something new, for you, since you rose to fame. You’re not used to it anymore.
Gods…
“Of course,” Malfoy nodded, swallowing thickly and  clasping his hands together behind his back so tightly that his knuckles turned white. “I was just—”
“Of course.” Slowly, the man hobbled toward the barrier. He laid a hand against the surface, raising a grey brow at Teddy, a smile tugging on his lips. “Would you like to meet him?”
Malfoy narrowed his eyes at Harry, scoffing as he rolled his eyes—rather dramatically, if Harry dared to say—before turning to make sure that the crumble was spread evenly over the blackcurrant. “Yes, Potter. I would have you know that I am a particularly accomplished baker, and crumble just so happens to be one of my specialties.”
Harry snorted. “And she agreed to that?”
“You’re doing this,” you whisper. Potter narrows his eyes, clenching his jaw. “Potter…what are you doing to me?”
Dean had, surely with the encouragement of Seamus, given Ginny a bright pink pair of jogging bottoms, apparently popular amongst Muggle leisurely wear, with
Harry grumbled as he tied his trainers. Teddy had begged that Harry bring Gary to the cottage today, so that Andy and
indicating that Malfoy has Disapparated. He stood in place for a moment, trying to decipher what had happened. Malfoy had actually seemed...
You press in—
He won’t.
Just as Harry lifted his tea and took a large gulp, Andromeda delicately cleared her throat, gazing at him over the lip of her own cup.
Draco exhaled shakily, warm breath ghosting over Harry’s face, and Harry raised his gaze. Their eyes met, sharp and heated, and they both stilled.
“Er...well, sure. But we normally don’t leave until later. Are you sure you didn’t still want to spend time with...with your cousin?”
Harry startled as Draco charged towards him. He reached for Harry’s arm, fingers digging into his wrist as he pulled Harry into an empty room across from Teddy’s.
Right...
He wasn’t sure what Malfoy didn’t understand. “I’m just—you’re training. At St. Mungo’s.”
It hurts.
“Why wouldn’t he?” Ron asked, chuckling as Teddy made a particularly daring turn and whacked George’s head with his foot in the process.
his friend was trying to withhold his mirth. “About all of that—”
Harry bit his lip quickly and glanced down, attempting to hide the thrill he got, knowing that Teddy evidently did not approve of Draco’s boyfriend.
Harry could not hear the voice as it spoke, but he watched as Draco grimaced, eyes shifting to watch Teddy before he replied. A quick conversation was held before the crow spread its wings, lifting from the ground, the
“Oh, bloody hell...” Ron murmured, standing up and turning towards the stove to pour some more tea.
“Well, er...I mean, he obviously adores you,” Harry shrugged, raising one hand to scratch the back of his neck—he could feel sweat beginning to bead along his skin. Andromeda should really have the stove looked at, as it was obviously emitting far too much heat. “And you’ve always been rather...dramatic, I suppose. He’s probably just...mimicking that.”
Unconditionally.
“Please, Harry?” Teddy had begged, his eyes widening, the color shifting slowly, faltering between different hues without settling on any one in particular. “
Harry blinked slowly, watching as the early morning sunlight reflected off of Draco’s platinum hair. He coughed, “Er...so, he’s good?”
“Here they are, young man.” The elderly owner stopped in front of a wall of cages, all interlocking to create a maze. Kneazles of various sizes and colors lounged about, keen eyes observing the newcomers, while others jumped from one perch to another.
Pulling.
Teddy’s laughter echoed inside of the cottage. It was just before lunch, so Teddy would surely be in the kitchen with Malfoy, helping to prepare whatever meal they would be having that day. Inhaling deeply, Harry rubbed his sweaty palms against his legs. He tugged his tight shirt further down, making sure that it did not show any of his midriff, before reaching for the door knob and entering the cottage.
“Look at you!” Harry called out, a wide grin splitting his lips as he walked towards the two. Both of their heads snapped quickly towards him, though while Teddy yelled in excitement, Draco’s cheeks colored slightly as he pursed his lips together.
Red bleeds into the water, a bright bloom.
“What?” Harry questioned, staring pointedly at Malfoy.
"Yeah, i thought about him too. I don't know why, but i always had a weird feeling about him." They all knew what he meant.
"I really want the sunlight to come soon. We have to talk about this bloody tournament with our families and I can't wait for them to find out who did this to Harry. This person can already be considered a dead person." Draco said while he gently stroked Harry's hair.
They fell in silence, a warm and cozy one. They finally felt in peace. Each one of them. They could finally just breathe.
"Get some rest. I'll stay here with you all the time." The boy muttered and kissed his boyfriend's forehead.
"Harry? Harry, love, hey, hey, I'm here, I'm here now." Draco. Good. Draco was here, it meant Harry was safe.
"Harry!" Hermione ran towards him and hugged him, they almost fell on the floor, but Draco put his hand on Harry's back.
After saying that, they all started talking about it. About the kinds of Dragons they could fight, about how they could fight them, what they could do.
"You're so gorgeous. Bloody hell." Draco said and in a fast way, he picked Harry on his arms, the smaller boy put his legs around his hips as they kept kissing and as Draco pressed his body against Harry's, making the other boy moan softly against his mouth.
In fact, the boy was now nervous, thinking about the stupid task - he had stopped thinking since Saturday - again.
"Harry? Are you here? Please, be here... oh." Someone was here. Someone was here and he didn't know who it was. He couldn't understand their voice. He couldn't see them, his vision too blurry due his tears.
Harry put his hand on Draco's neck and brought his face closer to his.
"That's a interesting one. I'm trying to find a fantasy one, Luna was reading it last week and it seemed to be really nice."
At least, for the next few weeks.
For some reason, when Dumbledore stopped talking, shocked, looking at the Goblet, Harry somehow knew what was going to happen.
"Maybe Cedric's will be Theo or Ron." Luna pointed out.
"I think adventure is a great option for tonight." Ginny said, putting her arm around her girlfriend's shoulder and bringing her closer.
"Yep." He answered.
He got out of his thoughts and noticed that Ginny was staring at him with concerned eyes, and he also noticed he was looking at the book on his hand for... he didn't know how many minutes.
At the same time Harry adjusted Draco's body on his arms, Krum got there, he was fast grabbing Cho Chang - that was... unexpected - and then, he left. Leaving now only that girl, Harry knew as Fleur's little sister.
"Yes, hot chocolate and popcorn, love."
"That's what family is for, Harry. And we are family." She moved to his side and he rested his head on her shoulder, feeling how she put her arm around him and hugged him. He felt better.
"No! I got this. This... stupid thing, i can do this, just wait a bit." Harry mumbled, and at the same time, a little stronger wave of wind flew around and the blanket - again - got out of place.
The blonde laid on the ground, making Harry lay on the top of him without breaking the kiss. Harry groaned when he felt Draco's hand on his ass, squeezing it with a strong grip.
Cold hands are touching him, pressing against his forehead, and cheek, while one steadily rests on his chest. Harry feels the familiar stirring of Malfoy’s magic under his skin, calming his stomach and his irregular heartbeat.
Malfoy’s blond eyelashes flutter, and he blinks a few times. He looks well rested, at least. When he sits up, his face pressed with the folds of his sleeves, and wipes at his eyes, that’s all Harry was thinking about. That he looks well rested. Not that his hair is slightly mussed, and he looks softer when in large sweaters like the one he had donned at some point in Harry’s episode. Not that at all.
“Potter?”
Harry almost moves away from the cold hands, feeling the blond's magic under his skin, making its way down to the deepest part of the gash and slowly healing it. He winces, his body rejecting the foreign magic. This doesn’t feel good.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ah!”
He didn’t feel anything at all.
Harry grins widely. “So I can wash this sweat off me, then?”
Harry's pale green eyes, striking like jade against his golden-dark skin, are narrowed down to slits. His glasses had been cruelly snapped right down the middle by his lovely cousin Dudley and he couldn't see- nor could he reach his wand, locked in the cupboard under the stairs, to either fix the glasses or charm seeing spells onto his eyes. But, you know. It was fine.
Malfoy’s hand is like a balm on a burn. It subdues the pain, just slightly, and Harry pushes closer to it, his eyes closing. He lets out a deep sigh, his senses dulling as Malfoy’s magic slowly pulses into him from where his long fingered hand rests. Harry knows that pulse matches with Mafoy’s heartbeat- is one with it.
Malfoy does, gently closing the door behind him as he comes inside. He settles on a bench Harry hadn’t noticed when he came in- it’s by the door, a few feet back from where Harry was slumped against the wall of the tub.
"Hi," he mutters. "I have a room? It's under Granger."
The blond steps out of the living room, glancing at him. “Did you need me to come with you? Are you not a big boy who can go on his own?”
He let out a tiny, choked sound, and Ron looked up at him. He put a large hand on Harry’s knee, making Harry look up at him. Ron’s mouth was set, his cheeks streaked with tear tracks. But still, his lips lifted crookedly in a broken smile. His other hand was clasped with Hermione’s, and she was looking at Harry too. Both their eyes were red, and they were holding onto each other for dear life.
“Ready?”
“Yep!” Harry grins at Malfoy, reaching under the bed to grab one of Sirius’ bags. He begins to shove the clothes into it, ignoring Malfoy’s gaze on him.
Malfoy swallowed, hard, managing to open his eyes the smallest sliver. He stared at Harry blankly for a long second, before his eyes fluttered closed again.
hello again everyone!! :D i hope you enjoyed the first two chapters, we’re getting closer to the real plot!
The blond rolls his eyes. “Let’s go to Grimmauld Place. You can’t get into the manor without me, so I should just come with you. It makes the most sense.”
His thoughts are interrupted promptly with Malfoy’s rearrival. He holds a stack of fluffy towels, and a plush looking emerald green robe is slung over his arm. He drops the items onto Harry’s lap.
Harry shifts on his feet, considering the question. Finally, he speaks. “I should stop by Grimmauld Place.”
"Nice. Thank you." He pulls out 5 galleons, handing them over. After the guy smiles wolfishly at him, he leaves, walking out into the Alley. He darts into Diagon Alley and then out- Into the Leaky Cauldron. He runs past Tom and the people in the pub, back up to his room. He drops onto his bed, letting out a sigh. He felt good...Really good. Rolling onto his stomach, he bites his lip. Something was missing. He reached up, lightly tugging his earlobe. He grinned. "Oh!"
Malfoy sits down next to Harry, and Harry can hear the clinking of glass and feel the heat of his body as Malfoy leans over him to presumably rummage in his bag.
Harry hums quietly, eyes still closed.
“What do the spells do?” Harry blurts out, trying to stop his train of thought.
“There are wards, so we’ll need to go together,” Malfoy says lightly, turning to face Harry. His eyes trace over Harry’s face, and Harry’s blush deepens. Malfoy’s lips curve into a slight smile, but he turns to face the fireplace again to let Harry recover some of his pride.
Once his eyes are on him, he can’t look away. Malfoy is staring at him. The grey eyes dart away from Harry’s, and Malfoy’s eyebrows draw in slightly. His cheeks and ears pinken slightly, and he lets out a huff of a sigh, and speaks.
“Why are you standing there like you’ll catch a disease if you touch anything?”
"Good choices." He pulls out his wand, casting a numbing spell and then a piercing spell, each piercing going in smoothly. Harry smiles when the guy turns around, feeling the new things in his lips.
He pushes the door in, taking a careful step inside. A sad smile pulls at his lips as he takes in Sirius’ room. Malfoy moves with him, and ends up crowding Harry slightly in the doorway.
“So, what exactly am I looking for in here, Malfoy?”
Harry narrows his eyes, wanting to defend himself, but he was in the wrong this time. This man in front of him wasn’t the mean-spirited bully he’d known. He had no idea who Malfoy had become.
Malfoy finishes a few seconds later, his words speeding up as he looks back at the wound. His last word is a soft whisper, a puff of air escaping him as he leans back, a single drop of sweat tracing down his cheek.
“Here,” Malfoy says, tossing three books towards Harry. They thump on the mattress next to him, and he grabs one. The cover is worn, well-loved, and a light grey color. He traces it, liking the rough feeling on the pads of his fingers.
Draco smiled slightly at her, and turned to leave the ballroom.
Hary grimaced, pacing in the hallway as he stared down at the map in his hands. I need to find Malfoy! Where could he have disappeared to? I need to find him. He stared at the map accusingly, as if it were to blame for Malfoy’s disappearance, and stopped once more in the exact spot Malfoy had been.
"How innocent." Malfoy's voice holds no mocking, just teasing, and what seems like curiosity. Harry turns to him, confused, and blinks at the strange look in Malfoy's eyes. Had he put him off? He hadn't meant to.
"You need to go to Saint Mungo's."
About half an hour later, Malfoy sits back. Harry can feel drops of sweat from him on his back. "The magic inside you was much harder to clear than I thought. You had a few bad spells caught before they really reached you, but that weakened your wand core while you were using it. It should be back to normal now. Now, please flip over."
He looks up, and their gazes connect. Malfoy’s eyes are wide, and his cheeks, pink. He looks away, staring at the book in his hand like it was the most interesting thing in the world. “I just think blue is nice,” he says gruffly.
Harry makes his way over to the bed, settling down on the edge as Malfoy peruses the bookshelf closest to him. The blush had faded. How unfortunate.
Harry blinks again. "Below... the belt?"
He reached back to the door, his blunt fingers settling slowly onto the shiny silver knob. He turned it gingerly, pushing the door open to reveal… a dark room. Cold, too. He shivered as a gust of cold wind hit him in the face.
Malfoy’s nose wrinkles as his eyes blink down to the clothes before coming back up to Harry’s. “Are those what you’re choosing?” he asks. His voice is wry.
Malfoy looked at him, scandalized. “You don’t even use a certain bubble bath? Or an oil?” He gasps dramatically. “No Gryffindor red bath water?”
Harry spots red hair that looks like it’s miles away. He steps through the doorway, feeling like he’s entering an entirely new space. The air is heavy with murmured conversations, nobody daring to be loud. There are tears, and blood, and the rank smell of gore.
He slipped out his wand, whispering an incantation over the drink before drinking it in one gulp. It burned satisfyingly as it went down.
hello (: i've had this chapter in my google docs for quite a few months now, but i was sitting on it, overthinking it, you know the feeling. i've decided that even if my writing isnt perfect or if some things are awkward, it's better to post and continue improving and receiving criticism than to just let my anxiety hold me back. sorry for the wait! i am very excited for this fic, and would love if anybody could comment w thoughts :D i also may be posting a new drarry fic soon!! and possibly bakudeku, but who knows. thanks for reading!! <3
Periodically, he glanced at Malfoy’s face and chest, trying to see if he was still bleeding. He kept applying pressure as he shrugged his robes off his shoulders.
They stumble out together, connected by Harry’s hand, which is still holding tightly to Malfoy’s arm. As soon as he regains his wits, he lets go, sending a guilty glance over at Malfoy. To his relief, Malfoy isn’t looking anywhere in his direction. Instead, he seems completely overwhelmed by their present situation. His eyes are dark and stormy, bony fists tight at his sides. A scowl pulls at his delicate features as his eyes dart around the cavernous room.
Harry blanches. “Malfoy, you’ve got to be kidding.”
She attempted a weak smile, reaching one arm out to him, the other gripping tightly to the other twins’ arm- George. Harry stumbled over, barely aware of his surroundings, and sunk down to his knees next to her. Hermione, Ron, George, Arthur, and Ginny were all there too, no words passing between them.
He stretches again, linking his fingers together and pressing them towards the ceiling, groaning quietly at the twinge of discomfort in his upper body as he does so. He pulls each arm across his chest, and does a few various other stretches, testing each limb and muscle until he’s satisfied.
Harry glared at Malfoy. “I’d rather not leave you alone in my godfather’s house. You can come with me.”
Harry nodded, staring resolutely at the floor. He didn’t feel comforted at all.
His skin was sallow and clammy to Harry’s touch, his parted lips tinging purple, his eyes shut. His light brown eyelashes fanned over his cheeks, and his eyebrows were relaxed. He almost looked calm, though he was nearly on his deathbed.
Harry couldn’t look at Fred’s body, or any of their faces. This was his fault. Fred had died because of him.
He shook his head, turning away. What Pansy did was of no interest to him. Though he loved her, he was glad to have her chattering at someone who wasn’t him. There were plenty of thoughts clouding his mind already. He needed a clear head.
“Malfoy!”
He could swear he sees a glimpse of white blonde hair in the crowd of bodies, and he pushes his way towards it. He stops a few feet behind Malfoy, who had just bent down over a small witch, probably a third year. She’s lying on her back, tears rolling down her cheeks as she clutches at her side.
Harry glanced back at the room behind him, taking note of two wands lying on the ground, and his discarded robes. He let out a sigh. They could wait.
“So, Malfoy,” Harry says, slightly more comfortable, “Why no green? I would’ve assumed your room would be chock full of Slytherin pride.”
Hours pass, each moment slowly dripping by like honey. The two boys sit in comfortable silence, occasionally piping up if they find something of interest. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen very often.
The bed lifts where Malfoy had been sitting: he'd stood up. Is he leaving? Harry closes his eyes, letting out a short breath. He'd already fucked things up and he'd barely even spoken.
Harry walks the cold, empty halls of Hogwarts with no mind to where his feet are leading him. The smell of blood, of death, is heavy in the air.
He looked up at Harry, his bright silver eyes holding the green eyed gaze, nearly magnetic. “You're missing a part of your soul." His voice was harsh as he practically spat the words at Harry.
Harry was left feeling like he was missing more than one part of himself.
Malfoy was staring at him, his eyebrows lifted high, his eyes containing something unexplainable as he drew back slightly. After a split second, his face hardened.
Harry stared down at Malfoy’s face, watching shallow breaths escape him. I should move him out in the hall. Nobody will be able to find us here.
Malfoy turns fully this time, a wide smile on his face. “I never would have guessed,” he teases, setting another book down on the desk.
Harry is gently set down on a bed, where he finally opens his eyes. Seconds pass as he blinks hard, trying to make the pounding in his head stop. "Who are you?" he utters, voice sounding like sandpaper. The man is standing, back facing Harry, and looking at something, from what Harry could see.
The magic snakes down into Harry's cut, trying to heal it with threads of intent Malfoy had sent, but it isn’t working. It does hurt though. Harry grimaces, flinching away from the sharp, needle-like pain. Malfoy sends him a lethal look before frowning and pulling the magic back. "Stay still, Potter," he instructs. His magic prods back at Harry's cut, Harry forcing himself to stay in place, and Malfoy nods. "There it is." He sets to work.
Malfoy throws a wry smile over his shoulder at Harry, turning back to the books as he responds. “Green is a lovely color, but blue is my favorite. There’s plenty of Slytherin pride at Hogwarts. When I’m home, I like to be comfortable.” He waves a slender hand in the air, gesturing at the homey atmosphere as he pulls out books and inspects their covers.
“It seems you’re having… complications. With your soul.”
He shook himself. Hermoine had been tortured here. Voldemort had held meetings in this room. Was Draco Malfoy pretending he couldn’t recognize him the most important thing? Why did his mind go to that? Harry let out a sigh, then turned back to Malfoy. They should start setting up.
Harry laughs. “Red bath water sounds like a nightmare. And no, I don’t have a specific magical bubble bath or bath oil. Pick one out for me, Malfoy.”
“That is a perfectly valid reason, Malfoy.”
What an odd situation Harry was finding himself in. But that wasn’t anything new.
Malfoy sighs, his eyebrows drawing together. “Let me check you, then. You seemed fine before,” he hesitates, “the incident of last night, so we need to be safe.”
As his shirt drops to the floor, he hears the door creak. He instinctively curls in, covering his bare chest with his arms, but Malfoy’s eyes are covered. “Sorry, Potter- Just wanted to bring in your bag, so you have clothes to change into.”
He stopped by a large stone pillar on the edge of the room, falling against it as his head swam. He squeezed his eyes shut, gritting his teeth. He NEEDED to go through with it. So he would. And he would do it right away, before anything else could distract him.
The blond’s face freezes, and Harry can practically see him carefully putting himself back together before he turns to Harry.
He smacked his lips, glancing regretfully down at the now empty and unhelpful glass, which blurred slightly as his eyes unfocused. He blinked, hard, before looking up- right into bright green eyes. His hand dropped to his side as he stared, wide eyed, right back.
Malfoy blinks twice, pale eyebrows raising a fraction.
Harry just looked at her, shifting Malfoy slightly in his arms. The boy’s breaths were steadier, though still shallow, and his uninjured hand was resting against Harry’s chest. His fingers twitched against Harry, and the boy looked down, eyes wide.
Harry watches those hands as they rifle through the worn pages of books. Some Malfoy sets on the desk, and others go back on the shelf.
Harry rolled his eyes, letting out a huff of a laugh as he pulled his shirt’s sleeves onto his arms."The fuck do you think Saint Mungo's is gonna do?” He starts to pull the neck hole over his head. “I had a fucking Horcrux inside me, though of course they would never have known that!” He grunts, shirt half on, and realizes, a bit late, that Malfoy didn’t actually know that before. He looked up at him, gauging the look on the blond’s face.
An arm slips under his knee, one behind his back, and he's lifted off the ground. He presses his face against his rescuer's shoulder, too exhausted to hold himself up.
The language of the spell seems to change, the soft Latin he was speaking bleeding into French, soft accents and tilted words. Malfoy is weaving magic into Harry's body, pulling a pain-reducing spell in as well, almost seamlessly adding it. There is a small stutter when he does, and his eyes open, focusing intently on Harry's wound. His fingers press down a bit more, chanting faster to fix the ragged scar.
He nudged the door open with his foot, grunting as he hoisted Malfoy higher in his arms. Blond hair tickled his neck as the boy’s head slid closer to it, and he could feel Malfoy’s uneven breaths against it as well. He shivered slightly.
He grabs his pants, knowing he's being too rough, knowing he's being illogical, but not knowing how to fix it and not really caring anyway.
Pansy’s face flashed into Draco’s view, catching his eye from the dance floor. She grinned cheekily at him, and blew him a kiss as she was twirled back into the crowd by a Durmstrang student.
“Are you ready to set up?”
Harry gaped, staring wide-eyed at the map. He’d disappeared right before his eyes! He wasn’t going to let Malfoy off that easy, though. This was just proving that he was up to no good, and Harry would catch him in the act. He put out the Lumos on his fingers, making up his mind.
Harry starts up the stairs again, hearing Malfoy’s slow steps behind him. Each wooden step creaks under his weight as he stiffly makes his way up. He can feel Malfoy just behind him.
Harry inclines his head slightly, his gaze staying on Malfoy for a few more seconds before he turns to the door of the living room and strides out. If Malfoy didn’t want him to worry, fine. They weren’t friendly anyway. He heads straight for the staircase, lost in thought, but turns back when he realizes he doesn’t hear steps behind him.
They go through the floo in the headmaster’s office. Harry steps in first, with a call of “Number 12 Grimmauld Place!” The bright green flames engulf him, and as they die down, he glances around at his dead godfather’s living room.
Harry starts, turning to look at Malfoy with wide eyes. “Malfoy?”
Harry blinked.
“I don’t want to talk about it.” Malfoy cuts him off, his voice harsh. He gingerly touches the scrape on his cheek, glancing at his bloody fingers before wiping them on his dark robe. “I’m fine. Do what you need to do.”
hey guys! :D this chapter’s been awhile coming, huh? i’m very excited about it, and i hope you are too! please, enjoy!! <3
He needed to get him help, that was for certain. The blood hadn’t soaked through the torn sleeve yet, but it would if that wound wasn’t closed up.
Harry smiles bemusedly. “Of course- nothing’s ever easy when it involves Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy.”
Harry can feel the heat of Malfoy’s chest against his back, and has to suppress the urge to lean back against his chest like he had when Malfoy had carried him off the battlefield. The blond was muscled, but gentle. And fuck, did he smell good.
Harry presses his mouth together, the cold reality of who he’s talking with washing over him once again. He knows Malfoy can feel it too. He lets out a breath, trying to let go of that. The anger, the hatred. Malfoy can help him, and he’d changed. Harry had to change too. He resolves to have an open mind- he was the one at stake here.
“Yes, well,” Malfoy says airly, “if you’d like to stay alive, you might want to stay on the good side of this pervert.” He smirks sharply at Harry before turning and making his way out of the bedroom.
Harry peeks over his shoulder, wondering what was in the room. Even though he’d been expecting a bedroom, what he saw still surprises him.
Harry turned, green eyes narrowed slightly. He couldn't see much in the darkness of the alley he stands in. He opens the door to the Leaky Cauldron, avoiding glances from those who recognised him. His gaze locked on the floor, he approaches the front desk.
“He, uh… His arm is sliced open. I tried to help, but I couldn’t think of a spell.”
"It's okay."
Harry watches him, head tilted. His hair is messier than Harry's ever seen it. Malfoy looks up at him and Harry smiles without even thinking. Malfoy looked young. Sweet, almost.
Malfoy's eyes flash up to meet Harry's, both intense gazes caught. Harry's eyes flicker down to Malfoy's lips, as he had started to spell another, smaller, gash shut. He was almost done now, Harry thinks. He can feel the twinge of Malfoy's magic making itself known inside his body, almost at his skin.
The light sounds of a party carried through the ballroom- laughter, murmured conversation, pleasant music, the clinking of glasses. Draco was focused on none of it. Pansy had finally unattached herself from his arm, and was flitting around the room, socializing. She lingered by Granger’s side, and Draco caught a glimpse of her hand ghosting over the girl’s bare back.
His fingers, as cool as before, press into Harry's hot skin. The murmured words of the complicated incantations surround Harry in a relaxing daze, his eyes closing as Malfoy's magic courses through him.
Harry's intensely green eyes turn to Malfoy. His cool fingers are hovering over Harry's deepest wound, on his side. He doesn’t seem to be holding a wand.
“I have to tell Ron and Hermione if we’re going somewhere.”
Harry sighs, shoving away the stupid thoughts once again. He didn’t have to be mean to Malfoy, but pitying him was no help either. They were here to do a job.
He sits down on the bed. "Sit up, please," he murmurs. Harry does and closes his eyes as he waits for the dizziness to subside. "Vulnera Sanentur."
Harry cracks a smile, wincing at the sharp pain in his jaw as he does. He still can’t speak, but makes as sarcastic a noise as he can, forcing his eyes open slightly to glance at Malfoy, who rolls his eyes in return.
His voice is stilted as he responds. “My mother loves me. She’ll do most anything for me.” His eyes flash to Harry’s as if daring him to say anything about what she wouldn’t do. “My father is going to Azkaban. We both know it. It’s just a matter of a time until he’s captured and brought into custody- they will have fled to one of our other estates.”
He stepped inside, closing the door behind him. He lit his wand with a wordless Lumos, glancing around.
He threw his wand arm out and waited for the magical bus to come screeching down the road.
He smiles, a small, genuine smile, and a dimple makes itself known.
Harry raises an eyebrow, smirking as Malfoy looks up at him. “Problem, Malfoy?”
What is happening to him?
The man at the desk sneers slightly at him. "Yes Sir, then. Here's your key." A rusty silver key is shoved at the boy, who snatches it without another word and runs up the stairs.
Glancing around the alley, Harry looks for a piercing shop. Seeing one, He walks toward it with a different walk from his usual- now he's strolling, hips swinging slightly. As he enters the shop, the man behind th counter looks up. His eyes are white- even the irises are just a shade away from white. He smiles dangerously as Harry approaches. "Chosen One? In my shop?"
Harry rolls his eyes. "Fuck off, Malfoy." He hesitates one more second. but finds he isn’t all too opposed to the idea of Malfoy seeing if he was fit or not. And maybe telling him so, too. "Let's get this over with."
"What?"
The man turns around and Harry's eyes widen.
Malfoy’s face drops, and Harry feels a stab of guilt, but he pushes it away.
Malfoy presses pink lips together, ducking his head down. "You have more injuries. Let me help."
He saw no sign of the Slytherin, who stood out easily with his sharp features and luxurious clothing. Harry shook his head, pushing through the large double doors of the ballroom. He didn’t spare a glance back at the bustling party, too focused on his mission to care about what he was missing- not that it was much.
Harry takes a few shaky steps, waiting for Malfoy to come through the floo after him. He shivers slightly. It feels haunted in the cold room. What’s taking Malfoy so long?
Harry’s breath hitched as he watched the paternal display.
“You know—” George interjected, eyebrows raised in astonishment as he watched Teddy “—I think it’s because Harry has something even better in store for you.”
Harry frowned. “Are you sure?”
!” Harry started, voice faltering on a hoarse moan as a wet tongue lapped against him. His back arched, arse lifting to chase the pleasure as he buried his face into his pillow.
Harry blinked, dumbfounded. “What?”

Harry couldn’t understand what was happening. “Teddy, I—”
“Harry, did you see?! Did you see me flying? Did you?” Teddy cried out excitedly, dropping his broom and throwing himself at Harry once they were near enough.
“I’m not sure,” Ron interjected, furrowing his brows, “Yeah, you’re decent with creatures. But do you really think you want to
“It’s okay, darling. I love you. So much. Don’t you love me?”
Scrambling after Malfoy and Teddy, Harry stumbled as he tripped out of the sitting room. He needed answers. He needed to know
Potter lifts your forearm to his mouth, his lips brushing against faded ink, teeth nipping at your skin. He lifts his gaze to yours, something possessive and dangerous flaring in his heated eyes. “You’re mine now. Not
He expected to find Kreacher waiting for him, but the elf was nowhere in sight. “Er, Kreacher?”
Harry laughed, kneeling down to catch Teddy in his arms and lift him into a tight embrace. Teddy wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, legs settling on his hips, as he clung to his godfather.
Harry paused in the entryway, watching as Teddy gazed up at Malfoy with such a pure adoration that Harry’s breath caught.
“Why’d he want a Kneazle so badly?” Ron asked. “Teddy hasn’t ever seemed like he wanted a pet. Loves creatures, sure, but a pet?”
“Draco
Two months ago, Andromeda made the decision to move to France to be with Narcissa and foster their rekindled relationship, now that she knew that Teddy would be well taken care of with Harry at Grimmauld Place. After transferring custody of Teddy to Harry, Andromeda sold her cottage, returning to England to stay in the guest suites at Grimmauld when she visited Teddy once every week or two.
thing.
Malfoy’s nimble fingers reached for Teddy’s, covering the smaller digits as he kneaded the dough, forming the crumbles that would sit atop the dessert.
Draco suckled the sensitive skin at the crook of Harry’s neck as he rocked into him, pressing deeper with each thrust. Harry breathed heavily, reaching his arms back so that he could thread his fingers through silken hair, holding Draco close.
“But, why?” Teddy whined, his lower lip beginning to wobble as he gazed up at Malfoy with wet, emerald eyes. “Lunch won’t be ready for so long. The crumble is
Harry shook his head once more, dismissing the thought from his mind. Teddy would not be that manipulative. He couldn’t be.
His lips were parted around a large wooden spoon, cheeks puffed out, blackcurrant filling leaking from the corners of his mouth. His bright eyes widened as he looked between Malfoy and Harry before pulling the spoon from his mouth with a wet

Firm hands holding you down.
“What’s this?” Harry gasped dramatically. “Is that a yawn I see?”
He froze as Draco shifted, resting his hands on either side of Harry’s face and propping himself above Harry as he began to catalogue their injuries, sharp grey eyes wide with concern as they looked over Harry’s torso and limbs.
Malfoy faltered, stumbling slightly as he paused the dance. Teddy stepped off of his feet and looked up at his cousin, concern written across his face.
There is a bite at your ear, a tongue curling around the lobe before it pulls away. “Be a good boy.”
In the silence that followed, Harry refused to meet Andromeda’s eyes. He could feel her firm stare on him as he fidgeted in place. Before he could suggest that he and Teddy begin to prepare lunch, her cool voice cut through.
Harry laughed to himself, shaking his head quickly.
“You heard me, Malfoy. If you are such an expert at baking crumble, I want to see what you can do,” Harry smirked, his tongue darting out and wetting his lower lip.
“Brilliant!” Ginny clapped her hands together. “Then you wouldn’t mind entering into a friendly wager, would you?”
He didn’t dare ask any.
Damp.
If it made Teddy happy, he would just have to get used to having a Kneazle about.
“Exactly.”

Draco snorted, crossing his arms firmly across his chest as leaned back to observe Harry, narrowed eyes glancing down Harry’s body and slowly making their way back up.

burned in the absolute disaster of his own fleeting hope.
“I mean—well, he’s your friend.” Harry shrugged, biting nervously at his bottom lip. “He’s your friend, and he doesn’t like me. But I want him to...” Harry took a deep breath, eyes focused on his thumb as he began to slowly rub it against Draco’s smooth skin.
But you can’t do this.
Draco’s brows furrowed in a soft frown as he tilted his head to one side, eyes flickering over Harry as if searching for something. After a few quiet seconds, Draco hummed. He straightened and began to stride confidently towards the entrance of the sitting room—towards Harry.
The room was still, quiet but for their heavy breathing.
You can’t—
Harry clenched his fists together at his sides, pursing his lips and turning his head so that he could watch as Ginny helped Teddy re-mount his training broom. He had no desire to see Draco being fawned over by his boyfriend.
“Oh...” Teddy deflated, his shoulders slumping in his disappointment. “But, you will come by next week, right? Do you promise?”
“No!” Teddy cried, though his adamance was rather diminished due to it being stated on the end of his yawn. “I’m awake. We can play again!”
Harry took a jolting step forwards, fingers hesitating in front of Draco. He desperately wanted to reach for the other man, to pull him forward. But he had to be sure.
Harry froze, staring in astonishment as he watched the two.
Draco was introducing him to Teddy.
Harry rolled his eyes, having already figured that. “Yes, of course. And what are you betting, Gin?”
Tears began to flow freely down Teddy’s cheeks, panicked breaths escaping him.
“Lunch will be served first, Tedward,” Malfoy’s clear voice stated. He stood straight as if nothing had happened, save for the slight blush at the tips of his ears.
Harry stumbled after him. They made their way downstairs to the kitchen, where Draco set the mugs of cocoa on the counter with a swift

“Wait...what do you mean, he
And through it all, Harry had to bite his lip and force a grin, because if he didn’t Andromeda would find out and she would...well, Harry wasn’t exactly sure what she would do, but he would really rather not find out. It was also obvious that Teddy adored Malfoy. As confusing as it was, Harry couldn’t bring himself to crush his godson’s love of his cousin.
What the bloody hell kind of question was that? Obviously he hadn’t done
…and pull away.
“Yes, Jesse. I assure you, I am more than capable of taking care of myself. And of casting a simple healing charm,” Draco’s voice drawled.
“I’ll miss you, too,” Malfoy threaded his fingers through Teddy’s hair, which had begun to darken at the roots, black with only his signature turquoise at the tips.
“For God's sake, Draco! Aren’t you
He was not expected until after lunch, and he could picture Hermione and Ron smirking at him for his early arrival, believing he would be carefully observing Malfoy for any suspicious activity, but Harry dismissed any doubts as he strode inside. The cottage was comforting, the life and excitement thrumming inside of it much more desirable than the empty halls of Grimmauld Place. He had nowhere else to be that morning, so thought it would only be practical to see how he could be of assistance with whatever was planned at the cottage.
Teddy squealed, rushing towards them. He jumped onto the bed and wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck, placing a wet kiss against his cheek, before scrambling across the bed and bestowing the same treatment upon Harry.
Teddy began to toss handfuls of crumble onto the blackberry currant concoction.
“Harry, let’s
You gasp as he takes you…
,” Harry growled.
Harry snapped his head towards Ron, who snorted and immediately lifted his hand to his nose, beer seeping out of his nostrils. Served him right. Hermione sat quietly, hands cradling her pint as she watched Harry with a keen eye.
“Of course not.” Draco heaved a deep sigh, lifting up from the ground and hovering within arms reach of Harry. “She demanded that we strike a bargain—the likes of which I will
“But I want to go
at him. With a heavy sigh, Harry swung his legs over the arm of his chair and took a deep sip of his drink. “No, ‘Mione. I haven’t. But...well, he may not be up to something. At least...not like I first thought, anyway.”
Draco narrowed his eyes dangerously, and Harry laughed.
He turned his head, watching as Draco made his way up the stairs, trousers pulling tightly against his arse.
He could safely say that his latest career attempt was a failure. As he slowly made his way to the second floor, Harry mentally cursed Ron for ever thinking he could be a
“Sure thing, sprout. I’ve got a few new ones since you were last in,” George nodded his head toward the front corner of the store, where a large display of vibrant Pygmy Puffs were rolling around their enclosure, high squeaks echoing throughout the shop.
? There’s an entire chapter on the subject,” Hermione’s fingers squeezed his shoulders gently, a fond smile tugging at her lips as she looked down at her tipsy boyfriend. Ron had always been easily affected by wine.
Draco’s breath hitched, and Harry raised his gaze to meet Draco’s wide-eyed stare. Harry licked his lips, eyes flickering across Draco’s face, before settling on his lips, reddened from where Draco had been chewing at them.
The rest of the weekend flew by.
He was too late.
“I’m coming, Tedward,” Draco responded, tilting his head towards the stairs, eyes staring heatedly into Harry’s own.  Slowly—
As he regained his balance, Harry looked back at Malfoy and froze as he stared into silver eyes, twinkling with mirth, eyebrows raised and a smirk tugging at his thin lips. He could feel his cheeks heat with embarrassment, and sheepishly rubbed the back of his neck, huffing out a stilted chuckle as he glanced away.
“Er...it’s fine,” Harry shrugged as he collapsed in an armchair. He didn’t know when Hermione had the chance to talk to Andromeda recently, let alone why she was asking about his time at the cottage, but one could never be too careful when Hermione began to question something.
“Er...” Clearing his throat, he glanced between the two companions suspiciously. “What?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, “As I said, I am here to visit my aunt and my cousin. Do you have a problem with that, Potter?”
Andromeda’s voice called from the sitting room, and Harry winced. Of course Andromeda would know that he was there. She seemed to always notice everything, no matter how inconspicuous he thought he was.
“Well, sure, but I still don’t see how this is related to your new case,” Harry shrugged, “Teddy hasn’t shown any werewolf traits yet, just his metamorphmagus abilities.”
Harry cleaned Teddy’s room while Kreacher freshened the remaining guest rooms—
real.
, Draco!” Teddy whined. He grasped Draco’s hand, picking his training broom up from where it rested against the hearth, and began to tug his cousin out of the room and to the gardens, where they would all Apparate from.
“Oh, shut it!” Harry laughed. He could get used to this, he thought—to this easy, teasing exchange between them, soft smiles and bright grins.
“Of course, Teddy,” Harry laughed, “I’m sure Nev would love to have you there.”
A desperate sob—
It is quiet and dark, save for the crackling of the fire that throws a soft light across the room. Shadows loom in the corners, a threat lingering…
“You’re mine, now…it’s okay.”
Harry squared his shoulders, brushing his fingers against his wand tucked away safely in his pocket, before stepping towards the back of the house where he knew he would find Malfoy corrupting his godson.
They froze, mere inches from one another, breathing softly.
“Well, yes. I mean....Merlin, Malfoy, the only time we ever needed it was at the bloody Yule Ball in fourth year. And that was for
He glances over at Harry, his thin lips tightening, before pushing the door open.
Harry jolted awake as the Knight Bus came to a sudden, lurching halt in front of a small, musty looking tavern. He jumped up, promptly tripped over a witch who had fallen asleep on the floor, picked himself up and loped to the front of the bus, grabbing his trunk and Hedwig's cage (which was empty as she was meeting him at the Leaky Cauldron) and leaving the bus. It promptly lurched into motion, driving about a yard before it disappeared with a screech.
Harry’s eyes brightened, and he straightened slightly on the cold floor. He grasped his wand firmly, squeezing his eyes shut. Images of flying through crisp fall air on his broomstick, hugging Hermione after she nearly died in the troll attack, and drinking tea with Hagrid all flash in his mind. “Expecto Patronum!” he calls. A large silvery stag appeared, majestic as it shimmered in the low light.
The noise in the background; cheering, screaming, sobbing, fades to a buzz as Harry lies on the bloody ground. He can feel people running to him, shouts of joy, anger, fear, all heard through the baseless humming.
He knew exactly what he wanted- A tattoo. He takes a deep breath- He was going to do this by himself.
He smiles slightly as he reads the message written in elegant cursive- “I’ve done what I can. Mediwizards have taken over. Meet me at the Astronomy Tower. D” He sets off for the tower, the piece of paper tucked in his pocket. As he reaches the top of the stairs, he glances around.
“Malfoy! The Ferret!
I will not worship you.
You always have.
“Hi!” Teddy grinned broadly, finally letting go of Harry’s hand as he walked further into the shop. “We want to see the Kneazles!”

were, trying to dance with Patil,” Malfoy chuckled to himself, “You looked like a moron, Potter. An absolute buffoon. No idea what you were doing then, just as you have no idea what to do now.”
You’re safe here…
Harry cringed. He knew that his face must be flushed—if not from the heat of his cheeks, than by the amused twinkle in Andromeda’s eyes.
“No, no!” Harry shook his head vigorously, “No, she just—you know what? It doesn’t matter. Shouldn’t we finish the toasties?”
“Of course, Harry,” Hermione took a sip from her own glass of wine, “What do you plan on trying next?”
Harry blinked lazily, a lazy smile spreading across his face. He relaxed further into his sheets as Draco cleaned the spunk from his skin. Just as Draco began to turn towards the en suite, presumably to dispose of the dirtied flannel, Harry reached forward, his fingers grasping at the air.
“Of course,” Harry confirmed, giving a gentle nudge to Teddy’s shoulder before the boy ran out of the room.
Teddy huffed, stomping his foot as he frowned. “Fine. Then I’m going outside until it’s ready!”
” Draco smirked “—I have, on multiple occasions, had the unfortunate privilege of assisting Ginevra and her teammates with their assorted injuries. The lot of them are entirely unable to keep themselves balanced atop a broom. How on earth they have managed to become professional Quidditch players, I will never know.”
Teddy was standing atop a stool at the counter, fingers kneading the flour concoction in front of him. Malfoy stood at his side, a wide grin splitting his lips as he bent over and placed a dish into the oven next to him.
“Shh…Malfoy, you’re fine.”
it, no matter the circumstances. “What are you doing here?”
Teddy turned to look at Harry as he finished his meal, smiling happily up at him, silver eyes alive and sparkling with pleasure.
“Let me guess,” Draco interjected, a smile teasing at his lip. “Red?”
. Harry snickered at Gary, whose claws clutched desperately at Harry’s with the sudden shift of location, fur standing on end.
“They’re amazing,” he whispered, gently resting one small hand against the exterior of the cage.
Draco hummed behind him and Harry straightened quickly, spinning around to find Draco biting his lips, pupils blown as he watched Harry appreciatively.
“Of course you are,” Harry agreed, securing his arms around Teddy as he stood up, shifting slightly so that Teddy sat on his hip before continuing towards Andromeda. “At least until Hermione and Ron start their brood.”
Squaring his shoulders, Harry pushed the door to the kitchen and made his way inside. Immediately, he was hit with the strong, comforting scent of rhubarb and apples, melted butter, cinnamon and sugar.
“Jesse.”
Draco nodded, curt and precise, though he did not look directly at Harry. “Yes, I am fine. Thank you.”
“What!?” Harry cried out. His jaw dropped, mouth agape as he watched his godson fly off, Teddy’s laughter alight in the breeze.
That is what he always says…
Ginny blinked slowly at him, looking quite unimpressed. She sighed exasperatedly, throwing her hands up at her sides.
Teddy was hovering on his training broom by Draco’s side, flying smooth circles around him as they spoke to one another, Teddy’s left hand grasped in Draco’s to keep him balanced.

“Of course he did, Ted,” Harry nodded, rubbing his hand against Teddy’s hair as he picked up a stack of dishes. “Gary will be glad to see you. He’s quite bored of me, now.”
“Can I?” You whisper against his nape, rolling your hips against his arse, perfectly slotted between his cheeks, a delicious friction that threatens to push you over the edge. “
for this, just you wait! And Jesse said he’d act as the Healer on-call so we will have someone there in case anyone gets injured.”
“Oh!” she gasped. “Yes, of course, Mr. Potter. Uhm...” She looked down at her charts, scanning the contents before meeting his eyes. “You may wait for him in Room 7. Down the hallway, to your left. The procedure should be complete shortly and I will alert Trainee Healer Malfoy right away.”
You want to tell him.
This was it, Harry thought.
Harry froze in place, just over the threshold of the kitchen. He could hear Teddy running around upstairs, Andromeda down the hallway in her room as she packed for the trip she took to France every weekend. While her husband had been sentenced to life in Azkaban, Narcissa had been cleared of all charges and fled to France. Andromeda had reunited with her sister and now, five years after the war, spent every weekend visiting her, while Harry watched Teddy.
Harry grinned, “Yeah, well...he kept glaring at me, and I figured it was because he knew how I felt. About you.” He ran shaky fingers through his messy curls, glancing away as he felt his cheeks begin to flush. “So I thought, why would he like me, then? When it was obvious that I wanted you.” Draco inhaled sharply, but Harry kept forging on. He could not risk stopping at this point and
“No, I am talking!” she said firmly. “Jesse is protective of Draco—he has mentored him since Draco entered the training program. But they are

with Malfoy. I’m watching over Teddy—like I’m
Harry cleared his throat awkwardly, “Anyway, I just mean that he seems really hurt. He won’t let me help, and he’s in such pain, I thought that maybe it was serious...you know, that he’d need multiple healers or something?”
Malfoy gracefully unfolded from his position on the floor, standing in one smooth movement as he brushed imaginary lint from his trousers. Teddy’s eyes morphed back to a bright amber as they flickered between Harry and Malfoy. He began to chew nervously his lower lip before turning towards Harry, a question in his shining eyes.
Once his feet touched the floor, Teddy began shifting eagerly from one foot to the other, eyes flickering between George and Harry. “Can I go look at the Pygmy Puffs now?”
Ginny and Ron laughed as Harry’s face flushed and he turned back to the gardens, watching Teddy and George as they looked for gnomes.
“I’m sure I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Ron shrugged and turned to watch the children flying in the middle of the pitch. A few moments passed before he slyly glanced at Harry, lips twitching with a mischievous smirk. “I’m just saying, though...there are probably less painful ways for you to get the Ferret on top of you—”
The fact that Draco spent most nights with them at Grimmauld instead of at his own flat after his shifts at St. Mungo’s certainly contributed to his happiness, as well. He finally had what he felt like he had been missing his entire life—a family.
Gold turned to ash.
“Okay!” Teddy cheered, kicking his feet gently against Draco’s legs. “Come on, Draco, let’s
Draco was silent, a deep flush spreading across his pale cheeks. The freckles across the bridge of his nose stood out and he looked to the side, nose wrinkling as if debating what to say.
Brushing her fingers gently against Harry’s shoulder in farewell, Andromeda swept out of the sitting room.
Andromeda pursed her lips with a hum, raising her eyebrows in question once more as she stared at Harry before nodding once. “Be good, everyone. Floo if you need me.”
“We were flying at Grimmauld, in the gardens,” Harry started, swallowing thickly as he watched Draco work, his cheeks beginning to flush in embarrassment. He had been a horrible godfather—unable to protect Teddy during a simple flying lesson—and now Draco was there to witness his complete lack of competence as a caregiver.
“Alright.”
You arch beneath him, lips parting, desperate for air…
Teddy scrunched his nose, pouting before his hair slowly bled back to its vibrant turquoise.
“Right away, Sir.”
“Why?” George asked, reaching for a crisp from the basket in the middle of the table and crunching loudly on it.
“It’s okay, Ferret. We understand,” Ron interrupted, his nails stabbing into Harry’s arms as he tilted his head towards the Apparition point. “Go ahead, save lives and all of that. We can handle this lot.”
“But, Draco—” Harry started.
. In his efforts to try to persuade Harry with his dramatics, Teddy had morphed into perhaps the most theatrical person that Harry knew. He could recognize, now, how much Teddy resembled Draco in that moment.
Draco.”
A huff of withheld laughter sounded from across the table. Harry wasn’t sure who was trying to hide their amusement, but he ignored it for the moment. George’s accusation was more important right now.
Harry grinned down at his godson before glancing hesitantly towards Malfoy. “Er...Malfoy, do you mind if I join?”
It’s not you.
“What’s a prostitute?” Teddy asked curiously as he looked between the two of them, grey eyes glimmering with a mischievousness that would have made Ginny proud.
There is a hand over your mouth…
Draco would teach Teddy how to fly—which surely meant that Teddy had exaggerated his injuries the day prior. “Damnit, Draco!”
Teddy giggled, grinning up at his cousin, gap-toothed smile wide in his happiness, before he finally caught sight of Harry standing in the entryway.
“I may have misinterpreted the situation, Potter. My apologies,” Draco started, his voice low and monotone. “If you have intentions towards Healer Montgomery, I regret to inform you that I will be unable to aid you in your endeavors. Furthermore, Healer Montgomery is in, as far as I am aware, a committed relationship with someone of the female persuasion.”
They were so close that all Harry would have to do is lift his head—a mere
“I might have done,” Harry shrugged one shoulder, grinning mischievously. He raised his hands to Draco’s hips, slipping them beneath the material, fingers slowly tracing the lines of Draco’s body, lifting his shirt until Draco raised his arms and allowed the garment to be tugged over his head and thrown to the floor.
Andromeda reached for Teddy’s hand, grasping it securely in her own before striding back to the cottage. Harry stood alone in the garden, watching as Andromeda and Teddy disappeared inside, before glancing back at the boundary where Malfoy had Disapparated.
They all watched as Malfoy walked away, until he crossed the wards and Disapparated with a soft
Malfoy blinked, and with a shiver his body finally relaxed. The tension left his shoulders, and his head rolled back, neck presenting itself subtly as a smirk pulled at his lips. “Oh, are you?” he sneered, narrowing his eyes before he began to push forward, forcing Harry away from him. “You’re not going to find out
an idiot,” Draco growled, voice vibrating deep in his throat as he took a quick step towards Harry. He lifted his hands, threading his fingers through Harry’s curls and
Until, suddenly, it
“Yes, I’ll be there soon, Teddy. Go ahead and set up.”
Everything seems so…
You rest your fingers against your tender stomach.
But Jesse had not been betraying Draco while doing so...
