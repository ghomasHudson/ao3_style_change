“What’s different?”
“Me and Draco?” Potter repeats, having caught up to them, the fit bastard.
Andata e ritorno - round trip
“It’s been quite a few years since we were twenty-two, Draco. I’ve grown up.”
“Merci,” Draco says, and reaches for the serving spoon.
“We’ve a history,” he attempts to explain. “Not a happy one. He kept it brief last night but we’ve not been good to each other over the years. I can admit that.”
Harry is seriously concerned now. Luna is never this upset.
That is the last contradictory thought Harry has before his instincts take over. He allows his body to move, slow and serpentine, his wings stretching and contracting with every roll of his hips. There’s a want, a need, bubbling inside him. He can’t remember the last time he’s felt such a carnal craving. Without conscious thought, he brings his inky black hand up to his mouth and spits.
“Do what?”
“You’re bleeding. Fuck, you’re bleeding.” Green eyes are tearing lines across Draco’s body, the emotion inside them stabbing harder at Draco’s heart than the ice-cold chill of the Atlantic below.
Harry laughs. “Help me up, would’ya?”
Grinning, Draco shifts. “Like you aren’t.”
, she thinks, and untangles herself from Hermione to give him a kiss on the cheek. He grins down at her, blushing.
“It’s two in the morning—” the Healer begins to say but Draco silences her with a single, seething look.
“He’s sorry,” Harry says and Hermione boggles at him.
Charlie hums back at him nonetheless, as if his hesitancy were answer enough. He pushes off the counter and moves closer to Draco, eyes narrowing with mischief or suspicion, Draco’s not sure which.
“It was Xenophilius’ idea! He’d discovered the city just before we buried your father. He told me only after your illness came upon you.”
“Will you two move it?” Harry asks, impatient as ever. Draco comes to an abrupt halt when he sees the source of the growling engine idling before them. Sirius’ motorbike is sitting in Harry’s back garden on the isle of Inishmore and Draco can not reconcile the incongruous sight.
The man steps back, releasing him. “Not yet, sweetheart.” He smiles soft and genuine behind his mask, his smooth palm against Harry’s cheek. Harry leans into it, kisses his slim wrist; presses his lips to the delicate blue veins visible just under his porcelain skin. The man sighs, melting at the gentle affection yet pulls away, his smile fading into the crowd along with his presence.
“That feels . . .”
Heart racing and feeling slightly unhinged, Harry looks down at the glowing screen, entirely distracted. “What is it?”
The sun has set and stars twinkle into life as the moon rises bold and full behind them. It casts an eerie blue glow over Draco’s pearlescent skin and Harry licks his lips, wanting to drink in every moment of this experience, to savour its flavour and forever hold its tang in his mouth.
Hermione pulls down her shades. “He does, Ron, yes. But not for the reasons you think.”
“The rest of the city is okay,” Luna points out.
“It’s freezing in here.” Harry curses as he rips off his hoodie and transfigures it wandlessly into a cloak for Draco. He drapes it backwards over Draco’s shoulders, careful to avoid his wings. Hermione wonders when it had become so cold in the temple. It felt balmy and even humid when they’d entered earlier in the evening.
Draco catches the soft sound of Harry’s laugh behind him before his mouth presses fully against Draco’s arse and his tongue works into him with a pointed tip. Arching, Draco cries out, his cock dragging against the silk of the damask, leaking and eager.
She winks at Draco and then walks off, towards the crazy man with the camera. Draco watches in horror as she leans down and whispers in Cameron’s ear, filling his mind with all sorts of scenarios that will surely leave Draco frustrated beyond measure in his too-small swim trunks. He’d worn the kimono as a precaution, but there’s only so much silk can hide.
“Can I help you?” he asks.
A little too soon, Harry thinks, noting the date on the calendar in the kitchen on their second Saturday in Venice.
It was tiring work, and frivolous too, creating an oversized spring pool of mineral-rich hot water for Harry to soak his bones in every night, but as the years pass he finds himself more and more contented with having such a source of relaxation at his fingertips, mere steps out his back door.
Hermione grins at Luna’s hopeful perspective. “What do you think they’re doing?” She asks, feeling the grip of tension in her shoulders.
“Hermione, it’s okay. Draco brought him back. We’re all safe and sound,” Luna says, petting Hermione’s hair. Harry watches as Hermione relaxes into Luna’s touch and is grateful for his friend’s ability to quell Hermione’s near-constant anxieties.
“Nah, he’s brooding, he is.” He points at Harry with one of his knitting needles.
Potter exhales and runs a hand through the chaos of his hair. Draco bites his lip, wondering if it feels the same as it had the day Potter had dragged him from the very fires of hell on the back of an old broom. Draco remembers pressing himself as close to Potter as possible, his nose tucked into the back of Potter’s neck, feeling the wind whip Potter’s curls into his face. He’d smelt like sweat and damp leaves. The memory makes Draco ache.
“I honestly don’t see your point?”
,” Harry purred, taking Sirius’s hands and bringing them down to his thighs. “I know you like me smooth.”
All in all, Harry had to admit it was a successful system. Given that facing Tom’s wrath was the consequence for getting bad grades, French eventually rose to his second highest class—first being biology. This led to another problem, however.
“Sounds good,” Harry beamed.
By this point, Harry had simply accepted the fact that he was most likely a masochist and was smitten with Tom even though he was a slave driver. The thought of losing their triweekly sessions was too much to bear, especially given that Tom was not only in a different grade, but also in a different dorm house (Slytherin, obviously), so their contact would become non-existent.
Clearing his throat, the boy found his voice and continued. “They kicked me out ‘cause I signed up to stay in a boy’s room, but apparently… Slytherin doesn’t allow trans boys to stay with other boys…” He shrugged. “But then they also don’t also them to stay with girls, ‘cause they identify as male. So it was kind of a lose-lose situation.”
“Um, thanks?” he finally managed to say, cheeks flushing slightly.
Harry handed Cedric his phone, discretely adding an emoji next to his name when he got it back. It was essential to have a representative emoji for all of his contacts, and next to Cedric’s he put a bumblebee.
Tom’s resulting delighted grin was entirely sadistic.
“Where do you pick this stuff up, Harry?!”
“Alright, well, we’re lab partners for today,” Harry said, deciding that at the very least, he would try and act amicable. That way, if Blaise
But of course, things never go well when you have Professor Snape as a teacher. Snape usually assigned Draco and Harry as lab partners, but one day he suddenly decided to switch things up. Because he was a sadist, obviously.
“…And why is this a big deal?”
Before they arrived back at school, Harry convinced Draco to stop by the nearby coffee shop with him.
“…Sorry? I didn’t quite get that.”
Tom’s face reddened further, visible despite his prominent scowl. Who could grill panini bread now, huh?
So that’s where Harry was now, visiting the coffee shop for the fourth day in a row. Cedric, conveniently enough, seemed to work the 4-8 shift every day, allowing Harry to see him after school. Cedric smiled whenever Harry came in, not even asking for his name when making his coffee because he remembered it after the first time. Sometimes they even made small talk.
Harry simply hummed and the two of them buckled themselves into the coasters.
Tom looked at Harry, then, sanctimonious façade melting and being replaced with a hesitant warmth and adoration. “Do you think I could… kiss you? Just for today?”
and then done.”
It started with Tom being a jerk and asking Harry to buy him some coffee. Like, excuse him? He’s going to confess to Harry one day on a ferris wheel like the cliché he is, and then he’s going to make him get him coffee? If this was Tom’s idea of romance, he sucked at it.
D: D: D: D:
Oh. Oh! It seemed that Operation Coffee Shop Romance was succeeded at a much faster rate that Harry anticipated.
marketing idea: harry hugs™
“I most likely would have,” Tom narrowed his eyes. “I had assumed that you would want to end them as soon as possible, given that you constantly complain about my ‘spartan’ teaching methods.”
“You know, I don’t think you did, Draco. You don’t have to, though, I know it was just—internalized homophobia and whatnot. Very tricky stuff.”
“Coffee then, hm? Let’s go!” Sirius decided, dragging Harry away.
would actually be a thing.
1. when did Harry Hugs™ get replaced with Harry Smooches™
“It might be scary for you,” Tom harrumphed. “I won’t be phased by something as silly as a children’s ride.”
“Um.”
“Perhaps,” he said smugly.
“I, ah—thought you might end our tutoring sessions if you knew I was doing well.”
“Nothing’s wrong,” Sirius assured hastily. “I just wanted to celebrate with you alone. I was the one that taught you after all.”
Noticing Harry’s silence, Blaise stiffened slightly and stared at the ground, biting his lip again. He met Harry’s eyes again when the boy reached out to clasp Blaise’s hands in his own.
“Harry! You’re supposed to be comforting!”
Sirius stared at Harry incredulously for a moment before breaking out in laughter, grinning wildly.
“Do shut up, Harry.”
i already did the data anyways so boo for u :p
Harry frowned. “Cedric, you’re cute, but your arms are like twigs. Unless you can woo the snake by winking at it, you’d be dead in an instant.”
Harry cleared his throat.
Harry furrowed his brows. “Sorry?”
Harry gaped, wide-eyed. Then, he jumped onto the bed with Hermione and hugged her with all his might.
“I,” Tom began, “am an orphan. A wee young boy lost in the throes of foster care.”
Harry, who in the course of his life had read plenty of fanfics, knew exactly what Draco was saying and needed no further explanation.
“You’re cute,” he whispered in Harry’s ear.
“Nice pin, loser," the boy sneered.
“Is something wrong, Siri?” he asked, tilting his head. “We got out of there pretty quickly.”
“Yes! Thank you very much, ma’am,” Harry replied amicably.
And thus Harry was left alone, wide-eyed and blushing, and quite possible going insane.
Harry couldn’t say he expected to be joined at the hip with Draco after that, but it was still a bit disappointing when the boy continued ignoring him in public. He understood, of course, that Draco couldn’t risk his father finding out from one of his schoolmates that he’s been associating with ‘the gays,’ but Harry felt a slight pain in his heart nonetheless.
“Yeah? Well, Dance 101 is stupid. I’m skipping to Dance 501,” Harry grumbled. Sirius just pushed his back further until Harry begged for mercy.
“Did you think I was?” Blaise scoffed.
Harry laughed outright. “You must be insane if you think I’d say no—”
Harry stuck his tongue out and let himself be spun around by Sirius. They danced like that for a while—Sirius teaching him basic rhythm and tempo as they went. Harry felt warm, being held in Sirius’s arms as they moved across the floor. The songs were fast at first, Harry being spun around in circles and thrown back against Sirius’s arm, but eventually they switched to Harry’s ‘Delicate Vibes (sunflower emoji)’ playlist and Harry rested his head against Sirius’s chest as they gently moved to the music. Sirius’s neck was slightly sweaty from their exercise and Harry could feel the warm moisture on the tip of his nose. He found himself blushing as he realized just how tall Sirius was, with Harry’s head resting just under his chin.
boo, no more banter? did i hit a sore spot?
“Right. Well, give me your number, yeah? So we can exchange lab info and such.”
“Anytime, Harry,” he breathed out.
Christ, he was
Hermione noticed first, of course, that Harry’s smile seemed more strained, that it didn’t quite seem to reach his eyes. Even Draco noticed eventually, pulling him aside one day to ask if anything was wrong. Harry said he was fine, of course. No one believed him, but Harry gave them such a pleading look to drop it that they couldn’t help but reluctantly nod.
Draco raised an eyebrow, frowning.
“Ballet! Wow, Siri, that’s incredible!”
Harry started choking. “Tom! Those are two very different apps! I don’t have either!”
“It’s not that,” Blaise interrupted, giving Harry a reassuring smile, though it was a bit strained. “It’s just that… they kicked me out of the dorms just a few days before the first semester started, and my parents had to rush to get me an available dorm room. I’m lucky Gryffindor had one left, otherwise I might not have gotten to attend Hogwarts at all. I guess I’m just still a bit bitter.”
Draco was silent, expression blank, before roughly throwing a shirt at Harry.
“Perfect. And Harry?”
Harry, although not a particularly good actor, thought that he was doing a pretty good job of convincing Tom he still sucked at French. It wasn’t particularly hard to do, considering the part about getting distracted by Tom’s hands every five minutes during their sessions wasn’t exactly an act.
kk so how about i do the data analysis and u do the intro and conclusion
Sirius kicked the back of Harry’s knees lightly and knocked him to the ground.
“Oh? I thought you weren’t my daddy?”
Silence.
harry says drarry rights
“Sure,” Blaise smirked. “I don’t trust him. I actually do a lot of reading on serial killers; it’s a hobby of mine. And he definitely gives me bad vibes.”
In Harry’s opinion, Operation Coffee Shop Romance was already off to a great start.
Both of them shuddered at the memory. After giving Blaise his first official Harry Hug™, they went on to their studies.
“No, like I was trying to say—it’s been years. I hardly remember. Plus, it’s not exactly something you can learn in a couple of days,” he protested, voice hoarse.
Eyes twinkling, Malfoy nods. “Many times.”
Warning for this chapter: brief mention of self harm
Feeling his fingers prickle at the memory, Harry comes back to himself at the sound of Draco’s voice. To Harry’s astonishment, he’s attempting to apologise for disturbing him.
“That’s going to scar,” she says, sounding frustrated. “I don’t have enough Ditanty.”
Hermione claps her hands together as if calling a meeting to order. “Great. Well, Harry and Luna will be off then.” She collects their satchel and places Luna’s safari hat atop her head over her bun, adjusting it to a jaunty angle. Luna looks up at her from under the brim.
“I’ve got you,” he told her.
Hermione nods. “It’s home, isn’t it?”
Scorpius smirks at him and it’s such a familiar look, Draco blinks in shock over the realisation that his son has become a perfect twin of himself at twenty two.
“What potions, exactly?” Hermione asks and Draco watches as Xenophillius pulls a vial from his robe pocket, just as Draco had guessed. The liquid glints blue-silver in the candlelight, alluring as ever.
Grinning, Hermione lowers the camera and steps forward, picking up Luna’s bangle-covered wrist to tug her close.
Draco moves with hesitant steps towards the black beast. He raises his hands in a peaceful gesture as the horse’s nostrils flare, snorting out a gust of warm breath against Draco’s palms. Whether it be in warning or approval he knows not, but he steps closer just the same, emboldened by some power he can’t name, a fissure of magic tingling against his skin, urging him forward.
“Draco,” Harry chooses his words carefully, “please feel free to join me.” Then, with a smile, “The water’s fine.”
Draco’s company and wants to spend as much time with him as possible. He was the one to stay when he should have left that first night. He’d sought Draco out on that balcony, shared his cigarettes and laughed at his perverse antics. The confusion of their time on the beach and the uplifting visit from two days prior when Harry had dropped off pastries left him feeling hopeful yet uncertain of how to proceed.
Draco isn’t buying it. “What do you want, Cee?”
Draco actually pouts. “Potter, I had a point to make.”
feature anywhere? I
The three of them have a rather perplexing conundrum on their hands, one Harry is certain Hermione never considered planning for despite her endless lists and lengthy itineraries. The conundrum being the transport of a (somewhat) feral Veela across an entire island via Apparition.
“What did I say?” Harry calls again, engine revving along with his ire. Draco’s nerves are shot through with panic as he jumps for the second time in as many minutes and shakes his head clear of confusion.
“You need this,” Harry is saying as he pulls Draco’s hair back, displaying his throat for Harry to bite and suck as he thrusts into him, hard and demanding, just how Draco likes it. “You need me.”
,” he replies and turns back to his room to get ready. If he’s going to willingly spend more time with Harry Potter, he’s going to be prepared. He grabs a moisturising potion off his nightstand and gets to work. If Cecilia wants to grossly objectify him, he’s going to make it worth her while.
“Fuck my mouth,” Draco tells him, seeing the desperate need so blatant in Harry’s eyes. Harry nods, pressing his cock down into Draco’s mouth and then moving his hand to hold Draco’s head in place as he rocks his hips. Draco closes his eyes, luxuriating at the feeling of being used, being wanted, needed. He takes what Harry gives him and sucks down hard on his prick as it slides wet and filthy in and out of his swollen lips.
A knock sounds at his door in the early afternoon. It’s Cecilia with a tray of biscotti and almond cake, a silver tea service floating in behind her. The saucers rattle under their respective teacups as she directs it to land gently on the duvet.
Draco huffs a laugh. “You’re incorrigible.”
“This is going to end embarrassingly quickly,” Harry whispers to himself.
“There’s no Portkey office here, lad,” the man says, and Draco blinks at him; more from being called lad at the age of forty-five than the shock of the lack of modern transportation in the village.
“... really clench the muscles of your back, Harry. My gods, it will be gorgeous! With your skin, and his skin... ugh! It is indecent to voice aloud what I feel right now, truly, my words would shock you.” Cameron continues, oblivious to Draco and Harry’s combined shock.
“S’right, but who wants those?”
“‘Mione!” Harry shouts. A disturbed pair of pigeons take flight at the sound.
“There is no need, Draco.” Narcissa lets go of Harry to put a hand to Draco’s cheek, mirroring his pose. His skin feels warm and alive beneath her palm. “Take your potion. For me.”
“But she was right,” Draco interjects. Harry nods.
“Hermione hiding?” Harry asks as he raises the cup to his lips with a nod of thanks.
“You’re radiant,” he tells her for the tenth time. She laughs, pressing a warm hand against his chest.
Harry hesitates, hovering over the title page for a few seconds as he catches his breath. When he turns the page, he breaks out into a surprised chuckle. There, in their festival finery are Ron and Hermione, Ron cheekily holding a fan in front of his face as Hermione looks on with humour and adoration clear in her eyes. Harry turns to the next page, and then the next, each one framing a single perfect image of their time together in Venice, most of them candid when Harry hadn’t even known Cameron had his camera on hand.
Black hands flank Harry’s face, and Harry tilts back as Draco leans in, mouths open, breath mingling. They hover together, lips barely touching, feeling each exhale as it passes between them.
“I think you should bathe, Draco. Your musk is rather alarming.”
“I see.” Draco stares down at the steam rising steadily into the night air, his face pinking from the residual heat. After a moment, Harry sees resolve firm in his eyes and watches as Draco turns to drape his dressing gown over a nearby stone wall. Harry’s breath catches at seeing the silver fall of Draco’s silken hair brush across the lines of his back when Draco pulls his nightshirt over his head, followed by his matching trousers, exposing endless amounts of cream-coloured skin to Harry. Along with a rather skinny, yet pert backside that Harry remembers quite—
“Can’t stay,” he responded, head bowed.
“No, shan’t.” Draco slams his door behind him and tries for the rest of the morning to convince himself that he’s not hiding.
“Flying isn’t enough?” Ron asks, his voice tentative as if he already knows the answer.
,” she tells him, voice filled with a reverence he doesn’t understand, along with the translation of the phrase.
to Draco’s conservative upbringing; flying like a demon over the cliffs of Cornwall, beaming at the turquoise blue water below having never seen an ocean so clear; never feeling happier in his young life than when he was seated behind Harry on that beautiful bike.
he’d hit him hard enough to break skin.
“He’s not?”
. Devastating, mysterious, headache-inducing, Potter.
Draco scowls at her over the rim of his glass. “I blame the Weasleys. And yes, I’m including you for contributing to the horde. Scorpius would be a testament to Slytherin’s name if not for the influence of Victoire and Rose.”
“Here,” Harry says, shoving a dusty
.” Looking offended, Malfoy tilts his head to the side. “Was that not obvious?”
She stops several feet behind him, staring out at the waves. They crash, loud and large against the shoreline, sending up white cascades of foam. Harry has the odd thought that the tempestuous tide perfectly reflects his mood. Luna gives his shoulder another squeeze and he hangs his head, turning from the railing, and Draco below.
“Still think so little of me, Potter?”
“I assume the museum guards will eventually realise that an entire room on the fourth floor has been closed off by a tripped curse.”
Hermione halts mid-step. “What?”
or three for the road.
“Breathe,” she says.
“For what?”
Draco often wondered what had become of Harry after he’d left England. He’d known, in some way, it had something to do with him, but was too scared to pursue the true reason and too much of a fool not to. All he’d ever heard in the years since was that the great Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World had retired to Ireland to live a quiet life on land left to him by his godfather. The side of Draco that had grown terrified of confrontation after hearing the news, found a terrible, painful solace in the knowledge that he’d never have to see his commanding presence in Diagon Alley, or spy him tableside at a Delacour-Weasley gathering in France, again.
“It’s most certainly not fine.”
“Cornswallow silk!”
“I was.”
Harry had always been a little bit proud of himself for befriending Draco—properly chuffed that the two of them had successfully put their past behind them. He’d considered it a sign of his own maturity, and that the sessions with his mind healer were leading to progress in his everyday life. And if, after a few pints, Harry would find himself watching Draco from across the pool table with more than just a look of friendly pride, but instead, a hunger. Well, he liked that too. He liked the way it felt, that tingle of attraction licking through his veins. It was warm, like the burn of firewhisky on his tongue, and Harry eagerly soaked in the sensation whenever it came over him, despite never being quite drunk enough to act on it.
Luna is rubbing soothing circles in his back. “I know. I felt it too.”
Draco gasps, a small exhalation of surprised breath. Harry aches at that precious sound and he’s terrified to examine why. He closes his eyes against the tumultuous tide of thoughts rushing through his mind at having to hear that surname again after all these years. He always forgets that Sirius and Narcissa were cousins. It’s as if his brain blocks the connection on purpose.
“The wind! It’s fucking bonkers—” he halts when he sees them so entwined. “Erm.”
“Can I come back tomorrow?” Harry asks, hopeful.
“It was his idea, wasn’t it? He brought you there?”
She rolls her eyes. “You know who.”
“Shit!” Harry shouts, jumping out of the way of a falling bit of marble. “It’s breaking.”
Harry growls, his thighs trembling from exhaustion at having to work so hard with so little leverage provided by the foot pedals. He palms Draco’s arse and pulls him off, much to Draco’s dislike judging by the nails biting into Harry’s shoulders.
Hermione shakes off her attentions, though not unkindly. “I did try!” she exclaims, then gathers herself. Inhales. “I didn’t—I just didn’t want Harry to be left alone with him. You see how they are with us in the room. With your father in the room! Imagine if we weren’t even there?”
Ron shrugs, grinning back. “I like ‘em.”
Harry had turned in Draco’s arms and kissed him, pulling back only to tell him, “That would be impossible,
Hermione watches as Harry sits down hard on the ground at Draco’s feet, all the fight leaving him in an instant. She sees Draco peering up at him, broken and small and horribly scarred. Clasping a hand over her mouth, she holds in a sob at the sight of him, reconciling the posh, prim, and pristine man she once knew with the one she sees before her now.
he thinks, pressing his mouth to Draco’s, tasting himself on his lips.
“I . . . I know,” Draco says, the admission closing up his throat with emotion. He looks up, sees the tears in Scorpius’ eyes and wants to reach out to console him, missing him terribly. “I’m sorry.”
“Yes! Harry, shove Draco against the rocks...”
“Keeping you from running. Again.”
Harry shrugs, feeling a melancholic chill settle over him despite the warmth of the evening. “Dunno.”
“I know,” Hermione sighs, shaking her head. “The entire place has been practically vibrating around us since you left. I’m terrified it’ll cave in, but the wards are holding.”
. . .
Hermione looks up from tending the elf. “Of course he has,” she defends.
“I have.”
**Puttano - hehehee, ‘man slut’. Cee is a bitch sometimes.
“You’re not surprised by that?” Draco asks.
. . .
Harry takes Draco's cockhead into his mouth, sucking hard and cutting off Draco’s internal thoughts just as a strangled gasp pushes its way past his pale lips. Harry hums around the girth of it, his eyes closing to the taste and smell and feel of Draco
“Can I taste it, please?”
Hermione hovers the little step stool over to Draco’s beast and nods her head, encouraging, as if she truly hadn’t heard Draco’s request, or seen the ache upon his face at her careless words. She conjures a saddle for him a moment later and Draco tries his best to brush off his unease.
Luna hands him another one. “Hermione will be with him,” she reassures.
Harry straightens and steps into Draco’s space, breathing in the smoke he exhales through his lungs and holding his head tightly in his hands. “
“Wait,” Harry said, all too soon for Draco’s liking because he whined when Harry pulled back. “How do we get out of here?”
“What?”
Sighing, Cecilia laments. “He’s been like that all day.”
Scorpius hesitates for a moment before moving to stand and walking towards his father. Draco reaches out as soon as he’s within arms reach and pulls him into a fierce hug, pressing his cheek to his son’s hair, allowing the familiar scent of his soap to fill his senses and soothe his rattled nerves.
. . .
“Yes, and so have many other witches and wizards, Potter. They have a magical chapter, you idiot. What? Did you think Lewis Caroll came up with all that tosh about Alice and the looking glass thanks to the glorious, hallucinogenic properties in Absinthe? No, of course not. He was a squib and used his wizarding knowledge to enchant Muggles worldwide. Or, if you ask me, deceive them, but that’s neither here nor there, the point is—”
“Right. We do.”
“Are you?”
“Fuck me, please,” he keeps repeating, lost in his need. Harry leans down, spits, and watches it land on the furl of Draco’s arse as it twitches. He rubs his thumb over it, presses in and hears Draco’s cry in response. “More!”
“You mean I could have been trapped inside a painting! But instead . . . we—”
“But how did—” Hermione’s interrupted by the slamming of the front door, then the shouted call of Harry apologising as he comes up the stairs.
Hermione nods and jots down the notes Luna dictates, biting her tongue with every addendum.
George’s returning smile is frighteningly eager. Harry feels it’s his duty to warn Draco of what he’s getting into but feels entirely too content leaning into his side for support at that moment to pipe up.
Scorpius answers with a raised eyebrow of his own. “Would you like tea?”
Grinning, Draco continues, laying kisses all along Harry’s fevered skin before Harry sees his eyes widen and he pulls back, staring at Harry’s chest looking spellbound.
See y'all Monday! Comments are <3
“After you, good sir,” Cameron says with a bow and a flourish, his dreads flopping into his face as he holds the door open for Harry, and Harry can’t help but grin at the man’s theatrics.
They’re climbing, higher and higher above the cursed waves, away from the danger, the bike’s engine sputtering and backfiring as they ascend. Draco’s coughing up saltwater, his throat raw from his heaves and his body shivering with the cold. He doesn’t care, as soon as he feels the wheels touch down on solid rock he’s pushing himself off the back of the blasted bike and falling to his knees in front of the foal’s face.
“The temple where you put Draco,” Harry adds from behind them. Luna hears the edge to his voice and wishes he’d hold his temper. All around them, the leaves of the trees and brush start to quiver.
“I think it’s infected,” he tells Luna as he enters the kitchen.
Sure hands palm Draco’s arse, spreading him open, and Draco arches off the pillow at the first surprising touch of Harry’s tongue licking a stripe along his furled skin.
Harry wants to ask who, but the ‘she’ Luna mentions can only mean one person. The only person left in Draco’s life: Narcissa.
Leaning in close, Harry rests his forehead against Draco’s. “Tell me, Draco. . .”
“Which means?” Harry asks.
Chapter warning: mild peril that's quickly resolved.
Narcissa Malfoy peers at Harry’s bare chest with narrowed eyes, and Harry quickly wraps the robe tightly around himself, knotting its tie with so much force, he grunts. Narcissa nods her approval.
“Yes.”
“Imagine once he gets to school?”
, and all that—or Venezia, in this case.
“These are the ugliest socks I’ve ever seen,” he states, grinning.
He can’t stand being in his human body any longer and shifts, breaking into an instant gallop, legs pumping, lungs pushing out air as he tears a line across the landscape, lamenting how he’s come so far, lived so long away from all the memories and the pain, all the resentment and strife, only to once again be chasing the ghost of peace here on the island he’s long called home.
“Wow.” Hermione slumps against the railing, eyes unfocused in the middle distance, contemplating the possibilities of a feral Veela being able to communicate mind-to-mind with someone else. But that person would have to be rather intimately connected to that particular Veela, and isn’t that curious? Harry and Draco (to Hermione’s supposed knowledge) were just friends before his untimely death. She turns her head, squinting at the two men on the jetty, brow furrowed.
Harry shakes his head. “
“Hmm?” Harry had been looking off out the kitchen window, his mind elsewhere while his magic and his moods swirled around Draco like a tidepool of intoxicating colour.
“Draco, we can’t help if you don’t tell us what’s wrong.”
Exhaling, Harry almost wants to smile.
After he finishes off both Cecilia’s and Cameron’s drinks, he lies back on his chaise, closes his eyes, and pretends not to think about seeing so much of Harry Potter laid out next to him like a pornographic feast. He rubs absentmindedly at his wrist, fidgeting like a first-year.
“Fuck,” he says, chest heaving. He’s on his back, leaning on his elbows as he looks up at the literal ruin they’ve made of an ancient temple which, according to Luna, was supposed to be indestructible. Draco is flung across Harry’s body, head buried in his neck, his wings spread out over all three of them. He’s protecting them. Harry grins down at Draco’s messy head, feeling bewildered and a little punch-drunk at the realisation. He flops back onto the ground, and heaves a relieved sigh only to choke on the dust-filled air a moment later.
“I know,” he soothes, taking Scorpius from her arms. He presses a hand to her forehead, feeling a fever of equal heat burning under her own skin and frowns at her, his worry compounding. “Gabrielle you’re burning up.”
“Nor is torture. Which is what today will be if you make me come to the Lido with you.”
Draco stops dead, throat tight. Damn Cameron and his commitment to capturing the moment.
“You had a lot of fun on that bike way back when, didn’t you?”
There is entirely too much silk and satin floating about their flat for Harry’s liking as Hermione alters two sets of Venetian dress robes for him and Ron with fierce, decisive swishes of her wand. Her tongue is poking out of the side of her mouth in rapt concentration, her hair a mile high from the humidity of the early evening and her tireless commitment to a theme. The dress robes had been an unexpected surprise after Hermione learned of their invitation to Carnevale via Cecilia’s insistence yesterday. Hermione had been planning to drag them to the festivities all along; she had packed the robes away in a hidden bag, wanting to spring the idea on Ron and Harry at an opportune moment that most likely would have involved a lot of
They stand there, taking drags in tandem and looking out on the water, listening to it lap against the sinking sides of the ancient buildings below. It echoes in the slim canal, creating an ambient sound Harry finds soothing. Soon, his nerves settle. He’s amazed he’s managing to share the same air with Malfoy and not feel on edge.
The bartender coos his agreement and shakes his head with suppressed mirth. “Too right.”
. . .
“I never told you,” Harry says, sounding hesitant.
this time. Put himself into Harry’s space, licked a stripe across
. . .
Draco solemnly nods, forcefully polite. “Of course.”
With exaggerated grace, Draco bows at the hip in Harry's direction, hand placed compassionately over his heart. “Thank you, Harry.”
The water splashes as Draco yanks against Harry’s hold but Harry doesn’t give in, he simply squeezes Draco harder until he feels him flinch, reaching his threshold. Draco hisses. “Careful.”
“Alright, Harry?”
With Draco Malfoy around, he’s even more grateful.
“Fuck!” He bounces on one foot in the general direction of the kitchen. “Luna, what’s wrong?” he calls.
He wanders the streets of Cannaregio, ending up on the edges of the city staring at the facade of a 15th-century church. There’s a huddle of tourists gathered nearby, their guide proclaiming that this is
“He’s a little menace,” Draco says, smirking into his gin and tonic.
“Oh my.”
Harry allows himself to be impressed for a moment and then pushes for more. “And Cameron?”
She smiles. “I can try.”
Luna’s off before Hermione can even nod in agreement, bouncing down the stone steps of a circular forum that leads to what must have once been a bathing pool for the inhabitants of the city.
He finds the railing and leans heavily onto it with his forearms, allowing the relief of fresh air to soothe his feverish skin. He looks out over the water, letting the swirling clouds and the electrical storm hypnotise him into a lulled sense of normalcy. None of today had been normal. And what Harry feels right now, the prickling sweat on his skin, the shivers running up and down his spine, is definitely not normal. He should be more alarmed at what’s happening to him, but he’s too exhausted to bother.
“I can see why you like it, though I’ll never understand why you had to abandon everyone for it.”
“They’re like you,” Harry repeats. He grins as a flush blooms across Draco’s cheeks in response.
Don’t you remember?”
“You were in so much pain,” he says, running a hand through his hair.
“You and Maman.”
“Potter!” Draco shrieks as he’s tipped backwards. Potter laughs but doesn’t follow through, dropping Draco back onto the bench seat with an amused grunt. Draco smacks him on the arm. “Heathen!”
No trigger warnings for this chapter.
I have this story (almost) fully written. You can ask Sly, she'll back me up.
. . .
“The wards!” Hermione calls, “They’re not holding.”
Cecilia holds up her hands, face raised to the heavens. “
“Later,” he says, grinning, and steps away from the table, giving them a final wave.
He rubs the back of his neck, feeling awkward. “Hey.”
“Oh.”
“Hogwarts doesn’t teach Muggle Art History.”
“You can’t possibly—“ Harry begins to say but cuts off on a gasp as Draco grips him in a tight, slippery fist, shocking him silent.
The bartender pours more whiskey into Draco’s glass without prompting and Draco, despite himself, bows his head in excessive gratitude.
They’d been warned so many times over, of the madness that could overtake the Malfoy line, of the genes that could taint their so-called ‘pure blood’ and drive them to ruin. Narcissa had once loved the idea of her breathtakingly beautiful husband having Veela heritage. She’d romanticised the idea of him being more than just her partner in life but her destined mate, a true match of love, not just a betrothal amongst patriarchs of two long-established wizarding families. Her love for him always felt like an act of rebellion against her own father. The pride she once held for how intensely she loved Lucius felt like she was spitting in the face of pureblood traditions, rather than bowing to them.
Harry slumps into her embrace. “You’re the only one I ever told,” he confesses to her.
A nod in the direction of the teapot. “Mind pouring me one?”
This question is met with a noncommittal shrug. Draco waits for more but Hermione remains stubbornly quiet, sipping her tea. Draco feels untethered in that moment, loose amongst the tide and not comfortable without having a solid grounding under his feet.
It’s nearly four in the afternoon when Ron splutters after someone accidentally kicks sand in his face.
and stood, wanting to assess the seamless walls of the room once more. Malfoy’s gaze followed him.
Draco looks up, mouth forming the question just as Scorpius answers it for him. “Mr Potter. Why’d you leave him?”
At a loss, Draco just stares back at Harry, stern.
His frustration mounting, Draco stares to take his fill the same way a desperate man would scratch an itch that was already bleeding, wanting to conquer that which has made him so unsettled. The markings spread out across Potter’s skin like an illuminated manuscript Muggle monks would pore over with endless discipline in their monasteries; or no, rather those mad Victorians. The markings are archaic in their execution, yet exceedingly and whimsically detailed like only the Victorians and their "scientific" texts could ever achieve. Orion, standing proud and aloof, taking up space on Potter’s bicep, draped in yards of fabric like a Roman nobleman. Canis Major, howling at an absent moon, one paw lifted, placed directly over Potter’s heart. Draco swallows hard at the sight of it—Sirius, the godfather, reflected in front of him from his place in the heavens, the closest thing Potter ever had resembling a loving parent, forever immortalised on his skin.
Draco is burning up, his skin almost painful to touch, yet Harry can’t stop himself from exploring further. Now that he’s allowed himself this, he doesn’t want to ever let go. He rubs his thumb over Draco’s protruding hip bone, grinning at Draco's resulting hiss of approval.
Hermione made her stance very clear regarding the secret discussions between the two of them—that is, she adamantly forbids them from happening without her inclusion. (As if she truly has a say in the matter.) She eyes Harry’s hand on Draco’s knee like she wants to hex it off, and Harry reluctantly removes it to his own lap, if only to keep the peace. Out of the corner of his eye, he swears he can see Draco pout.
They burst through the swinging door of the gents, laughing as they stumble into each other. Draco shoves Harry against the tile wall, his smile looking a little wild. His hair tumbles over his forehead, glinting silver in the low light, and Harry likes that it's no longer perfect. Placing his hands on either side of Harry’s head, Draco grins down at him, eyebrow raising in question. Harry answers by arching his back off the cold tile, bringing his hips into contact with Draco’s, feeling bold and reckless and so turned-on he’s afraid he’ll combust.
They rock in tandem, limbs wrapping tightly around each other’s bodies, panting breaths gasped into each other’s open mouths.
“I do.”
Scorpius squeezes his eyes shut and shoots back his drink in one. He drops his glass down to the table with a satisfying thud against the wood, shakes his head fiercely and says, “No, I didn’t mean just now, but thank you for that visual, dear father. Merlin’s tits,” he looks to the ceiling before gathering himself once more. “I meant before.”
“You’re just now realising this?”
“No, it isn’t,” Harry snaps, “but sometimes these things—”
“My point is,” Harry continues, “that I could never tell if they were male or female or both or neither, they’re simply beautiful as they are, no matter what that is, no name needed. And I’ve always liked that.”
“I know,” Luna assures.
Draco asks. Harry flinches in his arms, a splash of concern tainting the air.
It takes another second for Draco to come to the conclusion that this man must be Bill’s elusive younger brother, Charlie. He’s shared meals at Bill and Fleur’s table for twenty years now and yet he’s never met this particular member of Bill’s massive family, no doubt due in part to his constant travelling.
“What’s the pumpkin for?” Neville asks.
The ringing in Draco’s ears reaches a fever pitch before all sound coalesces down to a single moment happening before he can stop it. Scorpius has thrown a picture frame against the wall just behind Draco’s bowed head. He knows the subject of that image better than he knows his own mind in that moment and shoots up from the table with inhuman speed. He’s glaring daggers at Scorpius within a second of the glass shattering, the tattered image of his son’s beloved mother floating to the ground like a dried leaf on a breeze. Draco flicks his wrist and the frame, picture, and glass are instantly restored and righted once again on the grand piano where it belongs.
“Yes,” Harry’s saying, mind fucking gone with lust. He pushes back in, fast and hot, pulling Draco’s hips against his own, and can feel the zip of magic fire up Draco’s spine, can see the spark of it explode outward into the inky sky. They both cry out as the magic flares between them and Harry falls over Draco’s back, arms encircling him, one pinching a peaked nipple, the other holding tight to Draco’s leaking cock and pumping. Draco’s hands have moved to the throttle of the bike; he keeps revving the engine, the bursts of vibration sending shocks of pleasure through both of them. They’re fucking to the rhythm of Draco controlling the bike and it’s all Harry can do not to combust from the sheer intensity of the sensation.
“Draco,” Harry whispers, questioning his choice to join him out here with the summer heat pressing in on them from all sides. He needs to rise, needs to sit forward and put his elbows on his knees like Draco, but he can’t move. He’s been rendered utterly inert by those penetrating, predatory eyes. Another second passes with Draco watching him and suddenly, Harry isn’t sure he wants to let this limbo of indecision end—the anticipation is too sweet not to savour.
“Too bad, it’s already been taken.” Draco gestures to the tree. “Rotten luck, that.”
Snorting, Harry says, patting his stomach, “not today, too full. But, sure. I’m still down, yeah.”
Luna nods and takes another sip of her tea. As if that explains things.
Draco takes a long sip of his drink. “Please, explain.”
Draco inhales, steeling himself, and pretends he doesn’t feel the warmth coming off Potter’s skin, let alone that he likes it. “Great, now that we’ve got that sorted, you can go off over there,” Draco gestures with a wave of his wrist, “and leave me be.”
Too startled to look away, Harry watches as Draco sinks to his knees on the rocks in a single, fluid motion, as if he were nothing more than a feather floating to the ground on a breeze. Harry’s brows furrow, feeling sluggish with fever and unable to truly react the way he should. Harry should be doing something, saying something to make Draco come back.
“Draco, what did you do?” Harry asks, his voice a shattered, terrible thing, and it cuts Hermione to the quick just to hear it.
“And yet, here you are.”
“Then dance some more with me. We’ll sleep forever together, my love.”
“What do you think I’m planning, Charlie?”
Harry wants to groan. The man is impossible. He looks to the ceiling, staring at the painted beams, desperate for patience. “You know I do, Draco.”
“Snake,” he shoots back.
. . .
“No one blames you. Fleur has written to you a hundred times over saying as much. She misses you, Papa. Bill misses you. I miss you.”
Draco breathes out a gasp, laying his hand flat over the scar, and touches his forehead to the horse’s bowed head.
Harry stares, the line of Draco’s back long and lean before him, the round, firm curve of his arse exposed and perfect, nestled between Harry’s thighs. “You’re beautiful,” he tells Draco, and Draco nods, the bastard, before arching his back, the sharp cut of his shoulder blades spiking as he holds himself up on the handlebars to look back at Harry with a wicked grin. As if to drive the point home, he licks his lips and blows Harry a kiss.
“He isn’t!” She shouted, feeling slightly unhinged at the thought. Everyone always used to say how much like his father Draco was, but Narcissa had seen the break between the two men when Draco turned fifteen. She saw the chasm that bloomed between them that summer and only grew larger as the war loomed and Lucius fell further into the prejudiced ideologies of a demagogue. The darkness that Lucius coveted in his own soul was never reflected in Draco’s eyes, only the darkness that had been inflicted upon him. Draco’s resemblance to his father ended at the length and colour of his hair. This didn’t stop people from flinging you look just like your father at Draco like an Unforgivable every chance they could. If Narcissa could have protected Draco from such a fate she would have, she would protect him against anything—even himself.
“Mmmm,” Harry hums, his smile broadening as his hand moves to stroke Draco’s hair. It’s grown long and sleek in the four years since the war. Harry likes the way it looks fanned across his bedsheets or, on occasion, wrapped around his fist.
He collapses after his release, landing sideways, cushioned by the curve of his wing. He lies there, heart racing and shivering with aftershocks as the sky continues to ripple with lightning above and the waves sound out a cacophonous yet soothing rhythm all around him. His vision begins to swim and he lets his heavy head fall to the side, blinking slowly. Only then does he see it, there, just ahead of him, the pool of his come mingling with the blood on the rocks.
“He’s not getting better.”
To Harry’s delighted surprise, Draco blushes. He nods and encourages Harry forward. “Come on, Potter,” he says, sounding entirely too posh. “Must not let the wild beasts get too far ahead.”
“Luna!” He calls, his concern now shifting into panic. “Is Hermione okay?”
“What aspect of the day is bothering you most?” Luna tries again. “The letter Hermione delivered in an oh-so-timely-and-manipulative manner? The fact that you had to come back out here with me? Or was it the painfully awkward way you were forced to leave Draco, miserable and melancholy out on the jetty?”
“He held him afterwards like a precious thing. We both saw it.”
Behind them, the click of a shutter sounds. Cameron has his camera out, lens trained on Potter. Draco hisses in distaste, adrenaline still pumping through his veins. He stands and boldly moves to sit beside Potter on the opposite side of the boat, blocking Cameron’s view.
Hermione doesn’t respond, just squeezes him tighter. He can feel the hitch of her breath and the warmth of her tears as they begin to soak into the thinning wool of his jumper. He rubs her back and doesn’t let go.
"Tell me again why we're dressed this way?" Draco asks.
“Hmm, I’m afraid that doesn’t translate.”
Harry nods. “Gladly.”
He squares his shoulders, defiant and strong. “You wouldn’t.”
“Well. Good for them,” he says, finally turning away from the scene. The man has his hands fisted into the woman’s hair, the sounds of their joined hips and wet kisses enough to sustain Harry without having to watch it firsthand. He leans back on the railing, watching Malfoy instead—the excitement clear on his face and the telling rise and fall of his chest as his breathing quickens. Harry can see the bob of his Adam's apple through the waves of his silver hair as he swallows. There’s a flush climbing his neck and staining his cheeks, his mouth left open in awe. His bottom lip is wet. He must have licked it. Harry wonders if he’ll do it again.
Draco looks back over his shoulder, his preternatural silver gaze latching on to hers, and she knows, without question, that he can sense her disquiet.
Coming up behind him, she foregoes a proper greeting in place of engulfing Harry in a large, bone-cracking hug, the leather of his coat creaking under her embrace.
“I’m sure he’ll cook when he’s able.”
“I thought Cecilia’s boat was Sylvia?”
The foals fly in figures of eight below Draco, swooping and diving in and out of air gusts and in and around their mothers. They seem delighted by the rain, encouraged by its pressure on their wings. Draco doesn’t understand it but he feels a bit of comfort in knowing that the animals are not affected. That is, until he spots one lone foal, dipping lower and lower towards the waves, its mother hovering nearby, wings flapping in an agitated rhythm, hooves scrambling beneath her as if in a frenzy. Teddy is moving ever closer to them, having also spotted the alarm.
It’s at this point that Draco very much wants to stomp his foot and demand his son explain himself. What the hell kind of game was Scorpius playing at?
Malfoy crossed his arms and glared at him. “I told you, it was not intentional!”
. . .
There’s a moment where they watch each other, breath held, the air rippling with tension before Narcissa crumbles, her impeccable posture slipping. Her teacup clangs on its saucer as she places it hard on the table and drops her face in her hands.
Taking that as yes, Harry reverses the bike out of the shed and turns it for takeoff. He plucks one of Draco’s hands up from around his waist and places a single kiss on the inside of his wrist before repositioning it tight against his chest and guiding them into the darkening sky. Harry can’t help but enjoy the feeling of Draco clinging onto him like a vice as the rooftops quickly fall away beneath them. He’s a hot brand coiled around him, all power and sinew at his back.
“Oh, she’s as well as can be expected. But when I arrive home with such news! She’ll be up and sparkling once more! Mark me.”
Harry stands on the edge of a vast limestone cliff. It cuts a jagged line across the horizon, much like the scar etched into the weathered skin of his furrowed brow. Cascades of crumbling rock tumble down towards the tumultuous tides of the Atlantic below. Bitter gusts of whip-sharp wind surge up from the waves to tug at his unruly black curls, the leather tie holding them back ineffectual against the elements. He takes the full brunt of the gale coating him in the stinging mist of the sea spray as he gazes out at the rippling black water and the quicksilver clouds. He doesn’t allow himself to look away, not wanting to miss a moment of the vast expanse that unfolds before him, a constant horizon and an ever-changing tide.
“When in Venice,” he says with a shrug and leaves the room.
“I wasn’t trying to be noble,” he says, pulling his hand out from under hers. He’d genuinely wanted to save Pol. No parent deserves to lose their child, but he’d also had a death wish that day, in that moment as he dove beneath the waves. Harry had known and hadn’t let Draco chase it to its inevitable conclusion. That knowledge grated.
Nipping at his bottom lip, Harry says, “turn over,” and takes the delicious feel of his rigid cock away from Draco. A pathetic whimper leaves Draco’s mouth as Harry shifts them on the bed, moving Draco to drape across a pillow, facedown on the duvet. Harry kisses a trail down his spine, compliments streaming from his lips like water from a tap. Draco sighs at the attention and praise, luxuriating in the decadence of it all.
“I’ve always liked that one.” Harry raises his head off the pillow, straining to look down at where Draco’s lavishing his attention. “They’re androgynous.”
“Is this a . . . hot spring?”
“I’ve ruined it.”
Harry closed his eyes and let his head fall back against the dusty rose plaster with a thud, which he regretted as a new well of pain seared its way through his temples.
Draco shuffles out barefoot from the bedroom, his mouth wide with a fresh yawn when he hears the creak of the kitchen chair.
“We could have been arrested.”
“Harry?”
Draco’s shoulders spike, his eyes fierce and brimming with tears. Harry continues to stroke his feathers, feeling useless.
She turns at the sound of voices.
, called there by his curiosity and his own latent tendencies to constantly know where and what Draco Malfoy is up to. He assumes Malfoy is lounging on that ridiculous red-lipped couch draped in silk and being hand fed grapes by Cameron or something equally extravagant and bourgeoisie. Discovering such debauchery will be a satisfying sight as soon as Harry summons up the stones to actually knock.
He rounds the corner into the kitchen just in time to see Luna throwing a box of ginger mints and a smudge stick of sage into her satchel. Her clothes are dust-covered and sweat-stained, and there’s an angry scrape across her cheek. Harry rushes forward, alarmed at her appearance.
Harry grins, eagerly wanting to prove this stranger wrong. He feels reckless and free and pushes his thigh between the man’s legs, teasing him. The man hisses and pulls Harry tight against him, mouth to his ear once again. “Don’t do this, Harry. Not like this.”
Beside him, Draco’s wings spike upwards at Hermione’s insinuation. Instinctively, Harry puts his hand to Draco’s knee, giving it a reassuring squeeze. Draco jumps.
Another cry interrupts their question. Immediately, their wands are in their hands, their backs to each other.
“But, if he’s been improving—”
“Mad, yes. But it's the only way.”
She sighs, watching him stroke the reddened dirt beneath his inky fingertips. It’s then that she realises what that reddened patch is: blood. Harry’s blood. From when Draco bit him that first day. Her mouth drops open on a gasp, feeling uneasy and voyeuristic for reasons she can’t quite explain. Logically, she knows Draco is more creature than human in his current form, and animal instincts run deeper and more base than any human equivalent, but the shock of the image he paints before her doesn’t stop her from swallowing hard on her discomfort and tucking her knees more firmly under her chin.
“Maman is gone.” Scorpius pulls him into another hug. “She would never have allowed you to continue like this for this long. She was stronger than me, no doubt, but I’m done.”
Hermione allows herself several long deep breaths in order to not send a stinging jinx Harry’s way. After the day she’s had, she’s closer to throttling him than she’d like. They had brought him here to help, not to fly off the handle and break the ancient wards with his uncontrolled magic. Hermione keeps telling him to practice meditation to help with his moods but does Harry listen? No, of course, he doesn’t.
the little bridge just outside their flat. He’s smiling to himself as he looks down into the water from his place along the railing, his smirk driving Draco to distraction. He knows what Potter is thinking and it does nothing to settle Draco’s nerves over agreeing to join them.
Luna clears her throat. Harry watches her delicate fist cover the sound, and rolls his eyes.
Luna squints at him. “That’s not how I thought you’d finish that speech.”
Pulling back, Draco hears the harsh sound of Harry spitting just before he feels wet warmth against his hole and Harry’s thumb sinking into him without warning. Draco cries out, rocking his hips into the mattress. Harry traces his tongue along Draco’s rim as he fucks into him, pressing down over that bundle of nerves that drive Draco to distraction.
“You’re welcome!”
“You can talk?” he asks.
Hermione squeezes his shoulder, her other hand pushing back the hair off his sweat-soaked face. A motherly gesture he eagerly leans in to, needing the comfort.
“You went to
There’s a gash. A long, jagged slash that starts at Draco’s right cheekbone, just under his eye, and runs the length of his face, through the far side of his mouth. It gives Draco’s expression a sort of pulled quality, like a knife dragged through treacle. It’s as if the sneering smile of his youth has now been permanently painted over his adult face, his aristocratic features made imperfect in some horribly ironic twist of fate. It’s jarring in the extreme, like seeing a slice cut through the Mona Lisa, or the shattering of a stained-glass window. Its violence shouldn’t exist on such a face, and yet, Harry can't help but stare, overcome by what it represents.
“What’s wrong?” he asks upon reentering the room with three steaming mugs trailing in his wake. “It’s . . . tense in here.”
“Oh.” Harry turns back to the girl and shrugs, giving her another smile. She giggles, pointing to his left hand. “I like your dragon.”
He pats his chest, smiling sadly at the ache he always feels whenever he thinks about Sirius. He stands and announces, “I’m going in,” planning to wash away his sorrows in the turquoise water.
Draco huffs. “You know.”
Draco feels a traitorous stinging at the corner of his eyes and clenches his jaw, forcing down the emotion. Hermione sees his reaction and steps closer still, her warm hand pressing hard on his shoulder.
“Every schoolboy should know it.”
Charlie and Ron both snort. “Fair point.”
“I never knew.” Bewildered, Draco looks down at his young son, testing the waters of his own connection to him but not sensing a phantom fever affecting him, only the vague discomfort in Gabrielle’s body vibrating out to him. Instead, he sees the flarings of his son’s aura, sparking in golds and creams around him, the flickering quality a telling sign of danger.
Hermione smacks him. “We’re the same age, Draco.”
Harry hears, right before Draco’s hand twists, driving his frustration home.
. . .
“That’s a long time to go without speakin’,” Charlie mentions, leaning over Harry, his ponytail falling into Harry’s face as he hovers to read.
cuts deeper than any curse.
” Harry calls, wanting to ignore the keen observational prowess of his best friends in favour of drowning any lingering sense of emotional baggage over Draco’s nonappearance at the festival in a magnum of
“I have no doubt that his vast improvement is due to the attentions and energies that you three have shown him over these past days. Such news will certainly boost Narcissa’s spirits.”
There’s a consoling hand at his back. He violently shrugs it off and turns, glaring at Hermione.
She’s nodding, a finger to her chin. “But that’s love, no?”
“Harry, oh, fucking . . .  yes!” He drops his head, whimpering into the pillow as Harry milks him, his thumb rubbing just under the base of Draco’s cock as Draco pulses in his grip. All the while, Harry is still inside him, pressing deep as Draco convulses around his tongue, his whole body shuddering with the force of his release.
“She’s my boss. And also my aunt.”
Somewhere in the background Draco hears the click of the shutter and knows that Cameron has captured forever his reaction to Potter’s words. He feels overheated at the thought.
“Wanna go for a run?” Harry offers and grins at Draco’s scoff.
“They’re both Sylvia.”
“Right.” Neville directs a finger gun at him and winks. George cackles at him.
His shaking hands moved too quickly for Harry to react, one fisting into the front of his white tee-shirt and the other grabbing hold of the haphazard bun resting at the base of Harry’s neck and yanked simultaneously. His head went one direction and his body the other, leaving him utterly exposed, his entire body tensing under Malfoy’s touch. His own hands came up to grip at Malfoy’s forearms, his fingers digging into the sinewy muscle he found there. Malfoy’s lips were at his ear, his words leaving soft pants of humid air against the vulnerable line of his neck.
“I’m starved,” he says, à propos of nothing. “Let’s head inside. I’ll cook.”
“You’re saying—”
“I told you. You don’t have to apologise. Just try.”
filling him. All consideration for the consequences of such actions is washed away with the retreating of the tide as Harry swallows him down whole.
“Erm, don’t take this the wrong way, mate, but . . . are you high?”
“Drink?” Cameron asks, and Harry nods again. “Gin or Campari . . . or both?”
“Always,” she echos, feeling hollow even as she says it.
“We have a problem,” Hermione says, pacing back and forth across the living room throw rug. Luna notes that it’s of Turkish origin, and how lovely the colours are.
Maybe it’s the chill of the thin night air this high above the ground, or the sensation of Draco somehow being inside him and Harry not minding, but the thrill of flying quickly encompasses any semblance of Harry’s self-preservation. He manages to swallow his initial unease and directs Draco to where they’re staying on the island. Harry finds himself very thankful that the inhabited areas of Crete peppered between its many mountains are easily seen from above.
It isn’t working.
Draco huffs a laugh, too exhausted to truly put up a fight. His mother’s pleading voice still echoes in his head. The sound of her blatant desperation is so foreign he doesn’t know what to do with the memory, now forever trapped inside his mind. Even through the darkest days of the war, Draco never heard his mother reach such a level of raw emotion. Malfoys never let their emotions slip. He was raised to keep it all inside, buried and contained, never letting the vulnerability show on his face. He’d never fully comprehended the importance of such resilience until the war, when his mother became the only truth he could follow.
“That’s the thing, I’m not sure it is.”
“Good thing you have a pool, then.”
They stay on the shore for the rest of the afternoon, sipping Campari cocktails and eating slices of melon wrapped in prosciutto as the sun slowly bakes Harry’s skin until he’s the colour of a roasted chestnut, the black and gold markings of the constellations adorning him shimmering in the heat. He drops his hand from over his eyes to his chest, finding Canis Major, atop his heart as always.
Unsure of how to proceed when suspecting one’s father of barbaric decision making, Luna dares to ask, “Were you unaware that Draco has been imprisoned here for the past four years?”
Harry spins, spotting Cecilia coming up the stairs with her ever-present market tote slung over her arm. She smiles at him, amused, and puts her hands on her hips.
“So, there’s no geothermal pools?”
“I came across these two,” Xenophilius says, gesturing to Harry and Luna flanking him, “at the clearing near the stream. I was planning to check in on Draco when Luna, much to my surprise and delight, told me of his fortune at having you three liberate him from the safety net in which his mother and I had so lovingly placed him.”
Draco smirks as he leans in to press his mouth to Harry’s ear.
Smiling, Harry gestures to the watch. “Come on, I remember the crack in the glass. Dudley’s name is inscribed on it, even.”
. . .
“—no, that’s my name.”
“It’s okay, Draco,” Luna says, hands spread in a placating manner.
“I should probably go,” Potter says, his hands reaching for a pair of Turkish slippers Draco refuses to think of as chic, despite him owning several pairs in a similar style.
Thank you for waiting for this update! Life on my end has gotten even more insane than what we've already all been living through. The chapters are written. I shall persevere with posting them.
Malfoy smirks. “Liar.”
“What do you mean lost?”
“He’s right on time.”
“Is this—”
Hermione sighs, and begins her ascent up to Luna’s newest discovery, which won’t turn out to be a discovery at all, just some moss she thinks is magical on an errant rock. Nevertheless, Hermione gathers a glass vial from her satchel and hands it over to Luna for collection.
He turns to Hermione, the knowledge of his realisation still fresh in his mind, and feels his face break into a scowl of pain he can’t control.
. . .
Harry nods along but for the most part ignores their pleasantries as they all catch up and discuss Charlie’s impending trip back to Romania, too engrossed in the words in front of him. The beginning stages of the transformation process are complicated and utterly insane, according to Aldamova’s Annotated and Articulated Animagus but he understands the theory. His father did this, he can do it too.
Harry never mentions what’s on his hand, nor does Hermione ask, and he loves her all the more for it. He’ll explain it to them eventually, he always does, but not now. Not tonight.
Cecilia kisses his cheek and steps away, surveying her work. “You’re gorgeous.”
The corner of Harry’s eyes prickle with a telltale sting and he scrubs at his face, dislodging his glasses. He takes a moment to wipe them clean on his shirt, pretending that his bowed head is concentration, not sorrow.
Harry dares a glance in Draco’s direction to find him already looking back. It startles Harry but he accepts this as the challenge that it is—
The shocked gasps of both Hermione and Luna sound behind them as Draco bends at the knee and leaps from the ground in one smooth motion up into the sky, his impressive wings pressing down on the humid air of the night with surprising force. The power Harry feels emanating from Draco as he holds him tight and close to his body is staggering. He’d barely been able to stand in the temple.
“Turn around,” he says, stealing one last kiss before guiding Draco to drape his legs, one and then the other over the seat. Draco does as he’s told, graceful as ever as he lays himself forward onto the metal and leather like a damn snake coiling itself happily in someone’s lap before striking.
Sea mist dances over Harry’s skin, the wind whipping his hair back and pressing his sunglasses closer to his face. He grins, feeling the force of the water and the sun beating down on him in tandem. The water taxi undulates in the wake of the waves in the lagoon, bouncing up and down as it zooms by other boats, tourists waving, black shades glinting in the sun, white teeth shining with joy. Harry is surrounded by picturesque Italian beauty, and buzzing with the excitement everyone feels at the beginning of a long-awaited holiday. He breathes deep, taking in the scent of the salt air, teak oil, and the distinct musk of the driver’s
“I’ll see you later.”
“Remember the night Scorpius came down with the red fever?” Draco asks, a week after the foal incident at the cliffs.
Draco shoots forward towards the pair, his nerves spiking along with his shoulders as a thunderclap rings out above them. Just beyond he can see a break in the black clouds, a slice of light cutting along the horizon. He wills it ever closer, needing a reprieve from the onslaught.
“Charming, as always!” Draco calls out to him then grimaces, looking at the broom in his hands. He’d been pestering everyone from Charlie to Hermione via Floo why he couldn’t fly with them if Harry had insisted on him joining them in watching the herd for their daily dives off the cliffs and now he’d gone and been cheeky to the man right after he’d given him what he’d wanted. “Fuck, you’re such an arse,” he says to himself.
Harry sighs, feeling scolded. “You know, I did plan ahead for this, Hermione. He’s with Andromeda.”
At first, Harry folds his arms, offended. But the booze in his system and the nicotine high he’s coasting on make it impossible to feel frustrated for long. He sighs, leaning his elbows on the iron rail next to Malfoy, and giving in to his base instincts like a hormone-crazed third year.
“Ron, tell him.”
“What did you think your time here was going to be like? Sitting in my kitchen contemplating the weather?”
“So, it’s no longer recognized?”
“Why?” Draco asks, cutting Hermione off entirely.
Draco hears the creaking floorboards as Bill enters the room, as if summoned by Fleur’s discomfort alone. He turns in time to see Bill place a consoling hand on Fleur shoulder before bending down to press a kiss against her neck. “Chatting bonds, I see,” he says upon standing once more.
Luna’s nodding without thought, too overcome with emotion to question his words.
Harry can’t shake the image from his brain. It’s tantalising, the idea of two men on the bridge, as opposed to a man and a woman. Of him and Malfoy, sharing cigarettes and listening in on a pair of men connecting in
“You can tell by the scowl.”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Malfoy cried, and wrenched himself around and closed the short distance between them in two strides.
“Fuck,” he curses, and hangs his head.
. . .
something good.
Charlie heads to the door, holding it open for everyone assembled. “Well, I can’t wait to see this,” he stage-whispers to Teddy. As Draco walks out into the weak morning light, he hears Teddy snort behind him. It isn’t encouraging.
Finally, she says, “you were killing yourself, Draco.”
Malfoy throws his head back and laughs. Harry focuses his attention on the painted beams along the ceiling, ignoring the slight. There’s a macrame planter dangling from one beam near the far window, the plant inside its web seems to be pulsing . . . as if it were actually happy to be basked in so much light. Harry envies it, wishing he were back on the Lido with Ron and Hermione, soaking in equal parts Campari and tanning oil.
She crumbles at his kindness and leans into his touch. “Draco,” she says, voice hitching.
“You told me to imagine.”
“We can bring him inside now.”
“My dear Luna,” Xenophilius says, pulling back and holding her by the arms a little too tight. He always was a bit overzealous. “Sweet, wondrous Luna, you’ve found it!”
His fumbles with his new pack, dropping it once before managing to pull out a cigarette. Behind him, Draco snaps his fingers. Harry’s cigarette lights in a flash. He watches the burning tip for a moment before bringing the filter to his lips, thrilling at the thought of consuming something that Draco’s magic has touched. He’d done this the other night when they watched the couple on the bridge. It hadn’t felt this profound then—this electric.
“Fuck,” Harry curses, thrusting upward towards the withheld promise of Draco’s mouth. “It’s like an electric shock. But low and buzzing. The kind of tingle that leaves you shivering and unsure if you want more, it’s so intense.”
before heading back towards Harry’s, with Hermione and Ron in tow. The two of them had made themselves scarce during the thick of the festivities and Harry suspects they were in a secluded corner also enjoying the intoxicating anonymity of the night.
Harry arrives earlier than he’s expected back on
Draco pours and hands a glass to Scorpius. They silently toast and raise their respective glasses for a sip. Neither bothers to speak and after a few painful moments of this, Draco snaps and sits down at the table with an undignified thunk.
“You don’t—” Harry starts but stalls out when words fail him.
Taking a moment, Draco pauses, standing taller than he had before, pulling the sides of his robe together as if the action were a true gathering of his thoughts. He looks about as if seeing the room through Harry’s eyes, then starts by pointing to a jade plant in the far corner, explaining how its leaves wrinkle when in need of watering and plump like bloated green pillows when it’s fully sated. Harry allows himself a grin, listening intently as Draco guides him about the room for the next few minutes, pontificating over each plant and its uses in turn.
Hermione puts her hand atop Draco’s. “Stop that.”
“Gods, Draco. What you do to me.”
Harry shifts, tender from Draco pressing into him only hours prior, his body reminding him of all that he’s leaving behind as the train pushes steadily onward. He puts an ankle over his knee, purposefully adjusting in his seat and thrills at the dull ache, wanting its echo to last, to follow him all the way back to the halls of Grimmauld Place where he’ll lie naked on his bed and think of nothing but the last few days.
“Your ‘dreadful yet darling’ flatmates?”
With a sigh, she stands, brushing sand off her tanned thighs. “It is time we step in then, hmm?”
“How many can you handle?” She leans in and brushes away Hermione’s smile with her lips. She knows that this is what Hermione needs, and even more, it’s exactly what Luna craves. The chance to exude power over Hermione soothes Luna’s nerves to something shimmering and pearlescent in her mind. It leaves her irrevocably calm, and leaves Hermione’s non-stop brain suspended at a much-needed intermission between acts of brilliance, allowing her to rest.
Draco stares at his tea, throat working. “He’s . . . distant.”
. . .
“Call me Harry.”
“Hey,” Cameron says, splaying his hands in disappointment.
. . .
Hermione looks uneasy and Luna leans across the workbench to twirl a finger through one of her curls. “It’s alright,” she assures her. “I love your elderberry jam. And my father found a new project, don’t you see?”
“School.”
“He’s not miserable, ‘Mione,” Ron calls from inside the sitting room where he’s knitting a pair of orange socks and listening to a Cannons game on the wireless.
“Yes.”
“Malfoy,” Potter says, plopping down next to him as they bounce along the current towards their destination.
He knows at that moment that such a fate is no longer acceptable for him; that his life is worth more than the grief that’s plagued him; that Gabrielle would have wanted more for him, that Harry and Scorpius and Hermione and Fleur still want more for him.
“Oi!” he hears behind him as Ron comes running around the side of the cottage at the sound, Hermione in tow. “What happened?” They ask in unison.
“What?” Harry says, distracted.
Harry peers into Draco’s cup, studying the yellow hue of the brew.
Harry’s adventure is ending. He mouths at his straw, feeling nostalgic for a time that still looms present and pulsing with life in front of him yet slips through his grasp no matter how hard he tries to keep hold of it. Ron and Hermione sit beside him, glowing with the air of two people who’ve enjoyed their time abroad yet are eager to get back home to their fulfilling lives. A smile flits over Harry’s face at the thought of little Rose, so quickly becoming a toddler before their eyes. Harry bought her a souvenir stuffed toy, a flying lion, the symbol of the Venetian flag. He’s planning to charm it to roar and buzz about her head with its feathery wings, hoping she’ll enjoy the little display. It’s currently tucked into his backpack wrapped in purple paper, along with another present he’s anxious to unwrap, a parting gift from Cameron he’d been handed this morning with strict instructions to open only once he was on his train.
“Then why did you leave?” Draco snaps.
Another nod, another sip.
“Pity,” Ron says and Hermione snorts in response. “Wha?”
“Dee and Harry are having a domestic,” Cecilia explains.
“No, Draco. I don’t mean us. Gabrielle.” Draco’s eyes snap to Harry’s as he continues. “Her death wasn’t your fault.”
“Describe it to me,” he demands, pressing his lips into a collection of stars over the defined v of Harry’s hips. He nips at the ridge of Harry’s hip bone, then rests a cheek to the flat plane of his stomach, waiting.
Draco raises his chin just a tad higher. Harry takes that to mean he agrees. He then resumes his pacing, ignoring Draco’s request. He needs to think and to think, he needs to move.
“You’re impossible.”
“Sirius owned this record.” He’d scratched those same words into the wall above his bedroom door in Grimmauld Place. Harry remembers the day he spotted Sirius’ slanted teenage scrawl marring the dingy brocade of the wallpaper. It had made him smile through his tears.
“Oh, well then what I had planned can wait till morning, I suppose.”
Behind them, Draco huffs.
“He’s in pain.”
. . .
No warnings for this chapter
“Stopped?”
“Ta.”
“Don’t be silly,” she says, leaving a soft kiss at the base of Draco’s neck and (finally) moving away from him. Harry swallows, frustration growing at their connection. She twiddles her fingers at the two of them and steps to the far wall, rapping on the panelling in a staccato rhythm. The wall shifts, revealing a door where Harry hadn’t seen one before.
It’s at this moment that Harry decides to grace them with his presence, all wind-swept and dragonhide clad, his hair a riot of salt and pepper curls atop his head, loose strands running amok from the tie holding it. His gaze is fierce as he glares at each of them in turn.
“Then tell me what’s wrong!”
“But I agree with everything you say.”
Cecilia merely grins at him and takes him down the hall, stopping before a blank bit of plaster once they’d reached the end.
“The bite,” Luna repeats, dragging a fingertip along her neck. “I wouldn’t consider it morally correct of Draco to just bite Harry without his consent, but I assume Harry isn’t too torn up about it, given their history—“
, that feels too intimate for what he and Malfoy are to each other nowadays, but he also can’t find the power of speech to adequately correct her either.
” the mirror tells him in a deep, masculine voice. Draco flushes and steps back, flattered yet feeling caught.
Draco shifts, sitting further back on Harry’s thighs. Harry feels the loss of his heat and moves to rest his hands on Draco’s hips, halting his retreat. Draco allows it and Harry squeezes gently. “What are you still atoning for?”
Harry forces himself not to think, eradicating all thought from his mind, and focuses instead on the task at hand: running.
“Try Finland.”
“You’re staring.”
“S’warm.”
,” abruptly shutting the door in Harry’s face.
“You’ve come so far, Draco. You can’t let us stop now,” Xenophilius is saying, his hands held out as if Draco would walk into the embrace of his own free will, as if any of his so-called ‘progress’ were thanks to Xenophilius’ attentions. In retaliation, he holds Harry to him harder.
“It was never your watch, Potter.”
Bile rose in this throat at the thought. He’d been so weak, so shamefully, pathetically weak; so blindly willing to let Harry go in place of the promised stability of fulfilling his familial duty to the Malfoy name. The reason he’d been born. What he’d been raised to do. Falling into the role required only that he numb himself of the previous four years of happiness. Extinguish a bond so new it barely had time to take root inside him and yet had already weaved itself into the very fabric of his soul. Draco had survived living under the Dark Lord’s vindictive, penetrating gaze for a year, successfully cutting off all emotion from his mind in order to simply breathe in the same space as that vile creature. Cutting out a piece of his heart and self-cauterizing the wound couldn’t be worse.
Thirteen and half hours later, Draco stands, holding his newborn son with concern consuming his every thought. He’s come too soon and he looks too small, too pink, too perfect. Ten fingers, ten toes, a shock of white-blond atop his head, and a red slash of a birthmark on his thigh. Draco doesn’t allow himself to cry, he doesn’t want his tears to stain the purity of his beautiful baby boy.
Cameron, ever the optimist, lights up at this suggestion. “Oh brilliant, Cee! Yes, I was just thinking, the canals this morning are looking extra clear, perhaps we could take a ride—”
“You’re staring, Draco.”
he says, rocking against him. He feels Harry swallow, his throat working over the press of Draco’s lips, and Draco grins, liking that he’s rendered Harry speechless. He lifts his head, placing both hands reverently against Harry’s face, and stares down at him, savouring Harry’s submission. He takes the time to run his hands through Harry’s hair, the long curls cascading through his fingers like silk. Four and a half years Draco has waited to kiss Harry—longer still that he’s waited for Harry to realise how much he’s wanted—
“No need to extend me such pleasantries, my dear girl, no need. I am here to help.” He flicks his wand over his shoulder and the front door slams shut, taking the roar of the wind with it and leaving a chasm of silence in its stead.
“I shouldn’t have said that. I’m sorry.”
Draco flinches at the mention of Gabrielle and is immediately filled with self-loathing at his reaction. What is he even doing? Sitting here in another man’s dressing gown having a stilted, alcohol-fueled conversation with his son. He has no idea how to handle his grief anymore. How to balance his undying love for his wife and this newfound urge to make something more of his own life while he’s still able. He feels shame even thinking that he deserves happiness after Gabrielle’s death, but that had been the reason for Scorpius sending him here in the first place, had it not? Scorpius wanted Draco to move on; to live.
“Stop being a prick.”
She agrees. “Still, we need to think.”
” Harry says, smiling.
“Told you,” Luna sings. She plants another kiss on Hermione’s cheek and skips towards the borderline near the stream, her waist-length hair flouncing along behind her. When she reaches the edge of the water she halts and holds herself very still. Hermione steps up beside her and twines Luna’s hand with hers, giving it a gentle squeeze. Luna grins but, otherwise, remains motionless—her eyes closed and her face serene. She inhales deeply and then releases the incantation of a spell her father sang to her as a little girl. An ancient summoning passed down through the generations as a lullaby that will allow anyone singing its tune entry to a long-hidden place. Hermione looks on, mouth open in awe as the gossamer curtains part, leaving a chasm in the landscape. Just beyond the seam lies what remains of an ancient city.
Harry tries his best to bite back a smile as he takes in Ron’s appearance in his tartan robe and hand-knit socks. His freckled face is flushed and his eyes are tired, yet he’s grinning from ear to ear. Ron sees Harry making a study of him and smacks him on the shoulder. Harry smacks him back, happy for his friend.
Potter folds his arms across his chest. “Yeah. You were a bit of a prick this morning.”
Draco stills, blinking at the sight before him while simultaneously panicking at the thought of what lies behind him in the dim light cascading through the bedroom doorway. “Scorpius.”
“Thank you for the tea,” Luna says to her father, in an attempt to restore a sense of normalcy to the room. She places Hermione’s Healer bag down on the table and steps forward to hug Xenophilius. Hermione doesn’t waste a moment, pulling the bag close and digging around in its extendable depths for what Luna suspects to be a reviving potion for the elf. Luna also sees Hermione pull out a soothing draught and takes a hasty sip of her own before tossing it to Harry. He snatches it out of the air but doesn’t partake. Instead, he hands it back over his shoulder to Draco, who also refuses. Luna shakes her head at both of them.
“It’d feel even better with a cock inside me.”
“The Malfoys.”
Nodding, Luna adds a fair bit of morning-glory honey to her cup. “Yes. And I’m happy for him.”
Harry, feeling bold, raises his hands to rest behind his head and nods. “I think so, yes.”
Harry is moving before he even realises, pulling her to him in a giant bear of a hug as Ron shouts another “oi” at their backs.
“Do you have Vermouth?”
"I've been trying to show you. They're—"
“Between two worlds, like.”
I saved you!”
“What would you like, Draco?” Luna asks.
The fabric of the world ripples around them, revealing the hidden city in all its twilight coloured splendour. Xenophilius is off like a shot as soon as the image solidifies before them, robes billowing out behind him like the unfolding golden petals of a sunflower. Luna chases him, eager to keep up, wondering at his strange behaviour. She hears Harry call out behind them, but she ignores him in favour of following her father.
“I didn’t—” Draco begins to say, but Harry rushes to interrupt him.
“Every week,” he repeats her words. She doesn’t know if he’s placating her but she accepts the consolation at its face value, needing to believe him, even if it’s a lie.
," he shakes his head, “it would be a waste.”
“It’s my fault,” Draco says, moving towards the door, Charlie at his heels.
“You think this is best?” she asks, lip quivering on the words. She looks around her at the marble columns and mosaic floor, hands wringing.
Scorpius’ eyes narrow. “No.”
“I’m going to lick it off you.” Harry shoves hard, sending Max stumbling away from him. He turns, thrilling at the shock on Max’s face before grabbing the bottle off the counter and advancing. Max’s eyes flash and he walks backwards until his thighs meet with the arm of the sofa. Harry puts a hand to Max’s heaving chest, grins, and pushes, watching him fall. He lands on the cushions, eager and smiling—hungry for it. Max is always hungry for it, it’s why he won’t commit to Harry and insists on playing dick roulette three nights out of the week.
“Mipsy?” her father asks. “She’s not with him?”
“Just, is it wrong to want more?” Harry asks, splaying his hands.
When Luna opens her eyes, sleepy and smiling softly against Draco’s bare chest, what she says is not what any of them expect.
acting, Draco?” Potter asks, catching Draco off guard.
Ron, having donned his traditional plague mask with protruding beak, decides to poke Hermione in the hair as if he were a bird, squawking like a Stupefied goose. She scowls and turns to Harry, eyebrows raised.
“Love you both,” he tells them. “I’ll do one better when I get in. I’ll Floo Molly.”
“She flew too close to the waves.”
Hermione looks at Ron, her expression pointed before turning back to Harry. “When you asked for the books, Harry, I became curious. Naturally I had to read them first in order to ensure their quality. That research got me thinking—”
. . .
“We’ll be spending a lot of time on this bike then,” Draco says, reaching back to twine his long fingers through Harry’s hair. Harry practically purrs in response.
Harry’ stands and stalks away from her before she can do much more than stop the bleeding and send a disinfectant charm his way.
“Why?”
After a few moments of stilted yet highly amused silence, Charlie says, “That went rather well.”
“Harry, we don’t have time for this. Do you have your wand?”
Draco feels a brush of his son’s fingers through his hair before the connection closes and the tears break free of his lashes, trailing a searing path down his cheeks and chin. Behind him, the foal nuzzles at his neck, her legs sturdy once more, her leathery wings folded neatly at her sides. Draco hasn’t left her alone since the incident on the cliffs, bringing her back with him to his room and making a space for her in front of the hearth, piled high with blankets and pouffes. He can hear the whinny of the foal’s mother just outside the window and moves to unlatch the pane, allowing the mother to crane her neck inside the room, snuffling at her child’s head.
“You’re like a damn kneazle,” Draco says, voice muffled from his position on Harry’s chest.
Harry opens his mouth to speak, closes it, all the words stuck in the back of his throat. In a daze he hands over his gelato to the pink-haired Draco Malfoy, as if the offering would suffice in place of speech.
“How the fuck do you know?” Draco bites out, his body rigid with strain.
“Can I—”
“Fine?”
“Your point?”
“Once he’s moved on, the previous project is left behind. He never starts something he can’t finish, so if he’s found something else—“
“Huh,” Ron says, hands on his hips. “Bit of a fixer, innit?”
Sighing, Hermione rolls her head on the back of the couch, dropping her hand from her eyes and accepting a filled glass from Luna. “He did what he thought was best, Harry. We have to give him the benefit of the doubt.”
And yes, Harry’s ‘later’ was totally intentional.
"They are rather comfortable."
“I’m too dependent on Dreamless Sleep already.”
“Coming to join me?”
“I have an idea.” And then he’s up and off, strolling down the beach without evening looking back.
“Hey!” Ron yelps through his beak and Harry snorts, downing his firewhiskey and relinquishing his glass to the kitchen bench.
Harry can’t help but grin. “‘Cause of me?”
“Mr Lovegood,” Harry says, sounding just as odd as Luna feels.
“Perhaps you should come over more often, then,” Harry says, stabbing an asparagus spear.
. . .
Harry’s eyes flash at the sight of the binding spell, and he slashes his hand through the air. The vines singe into ash instantly and fall to the carpet like flakes of heavy grey snow. All of Xenophilius’ bravado leaves him as he witnesses firsthand what Harry is capable of, his shoulders lowering along with his wand. His expression of alarm melts into something more benign—an aged deerhound with its tail between its legs, told not to eat the bones of the roast dinner.
Malfoy had managed to push Harry back into the wall, his thigh moving between Harry’s legs and pressing in hard. He rolled his hips and pulled at Harry’s hair so he could lick a trail down Harry’s neck with a hot tongue. Harry felt his skin pucker into gooseflesh as Mafloy blew cool air over the stripe he’d just painted him with, and he bit back a moan. He needed air. He needed space. He needed to breathe for a second and get his feet back under him. Figure out what the hell was happening to them both.
“Nev’s in the back,” George answers.
“Well, that was Scorpius’ job,” Hermione retorts.
“There was a house elf that tended to him. Brought him food,” Harry tells them. “Shit, really?” He sits back, then turns to Hermione, eyes wide. “Do you think—”
It’s his turn to push back his chair. He’s at the back door, wrenching it open before he can yell or cry or self-combust from the thunderclap of emotion he’s just experienced.
“What?”
Polpettino - adding ‘ino’ or ‘ina’ at the end of words endears them, so polpettino means ‘tiny’ meatball. heheheehe
Draco’s eyes close at the words, his throat working.
“What?”
Harry’s lips thin. “No.”
I totally forgot about posting yesterday and I am so sorry, y'all. I hope this update satisfies. More to come in five days! Sooooo, that'll be . . . Friday! See you then!
Malfoy huffed and crossed his arms across his chest.
“Not recently.”
“You’re violating a priceless piece of art, Potter. Have some respect.”
“Yes—“
Hermione gasps and Draco feels Harry flinch in his arms. Everyone in the room knows too well of the seizing fits Draco’s suffered over the past days.
. . .
“There!” Hermione calls over the wind, her voice carrying back to him on a gust. Draco looks down at where she’s pointing and sees spread out before them an endless expanse of grey tinged rock and mossy green flora. Meandering lines of stone walls slice through the landscape, along with the occasional darting black figure that Draco assumes to be a wild Thestral gone loose from the herd.
“It is fated,” the priest says, gesturing to Harry’s hand.
a fan!”
Luna puts down her cup and stares out the window at Draco with his curled, ruffled wings and bowed head out on the jetty, huddled in on himself with a shame he shouldn’t have to feel. “He’d sneak down to the dungeons at night to bring me food, cast warming charms, use magic to help us, even though he wasn’t supposed to—it was terribly dangerous for him. He earned my friendship even in the darkest moment of my life.”
Just then, the fire behind them roars to life in a shock of green flames, the Healer stepping through, potion satchel in hand.
“Master Draco!” She croaks and hops down from the coffee table on wobbly legs. “Master Draco, you’ll be needing your potions.”
Harry grunts. Draco assumes that translates to
Eyebrow raising, Draco allows his eyes to sweep lower across Harry’s chest and arms, shifting away from his relaxed position lying over him. “Shall I do a proper study of you?”
Harry tries again. “Draco, listen to me.”
“I know!”
“That’s what I said!” Malfoy exclaims. He hits Harry’s arm with the back of his hand, which makes Harry laugh all the more.
She sits back down, forcing a smile as her heart pounds so hard in her chest that the corners of her vision begin to blur—the result is that the only thing she can focus on is her son. “Talk to me, please.”
Luna smiles into her tea. “Focus.”
Harry’s eyes close unbidden at the words, their meaning coursing through him like the rip of a curse cast through a wand. He moans, his back arching off the cushions.
help. He bit his lip and watched the buttons of Malfoy’s waistcoat strain against his gasping breaths and the fall of his pale hair over the sharp line of his cheekbone as he turned his head back and forth against the plaster wall in discomfort. Harry ran a hand through his own hair in frustration.
All the wind leaves Harry’s lungs in an instant. He breathes out Draco’s name soundlessly and sits down hard on the rocks, his knees having given out on him. What the mask had once covered is now visible under the lamplight, and what Harry sees breaks something inside him. He feels it happen, a clean snap right through his heart.
. . .
,” he says, and takes another lick of gelato, coating his tongue in cream. It’s a debauched sight that Harry will never in his life forget witnessing first-hand. His empty hands clench into fists at his sides.
“And I like you, Harry. As much as it pains me to say it, you are… adorable,” Tom hissed out the last word like it pained him to say it. “I thought you were a complete idiot at first. And I still do—”
“Of course…” Harry nodded gravely. “After all, you can’t break me out of jail if Professor Snape kills you first. Did you see the glare he gave Neville when he didn't know what an amino acid was?”
with Sirius or anything, or even that they had made any serious commitments to each other. It’s just that no-one quite liked finding out they were only being flirted with as a replacement for someone’s straight best friend.
From then on, in the privacy of Tom’s room where there were no witnesses, Tom became Satan himself.
“I’m a changed man, Draco. I’ve felt the turmoil of love and heartbreak. I’ve felt my heart fracture and stitched it up with my very own hands. I have taken control of my own destiny.”
“I give up, Harry. You’re incredible, you know that?” he got out in between laughs, wiping a tear from his eyes.
Harry Potter clutched his school bag, adorned with a plethora of gay pins he ordered off Amazon (featuring brilliant slogans such as ‘gay and angry’ and, his favorite, ‘teenage lesbian’) and stood at the platform of 9 ¾ King’s Cross Station, gazing upon the Hogwarts Express. This is it. No longer did he have to live closeted (literally) with the Catholic gremlins known as the Dursleys—who, Harry thought, for a family that preached the importance of household love and harmony, surprisingly loved their child abuse—and could finally live out and proud. After sacrificing his Tumblr blog in middle school in order to focus on his studies, Harry managed to get a scholarship to the prestigious Hogwarts boarding school, marking the beginning of a Dursley-free lifestyle. 15 years old and unapologetically gay, Harry Potter was ready to live out the queer high school life of his dreams.
It was all worth it, however, when Tom immediately blushed upon seeing Harry in the tightest skinny jeans he owned paired with a loose crop top that hung off his shoulders. And his signature rainbow heart hair pin, of course.
Harry’s heart pounded slightly. “And that’s… good?”
Harry banged his head against the table.
you—”
Silence.
“You look nice, Tom!” Harry said once Tom simply stared at him and seemed to be at a loss for words.
“You know I only have chocolate milk in the mornings,” Harry scoffed.  “Why would I need Viagra, anyways, when I have your sweet bod to look at?”
“Ugh, yes. I forget to get him coffee one time and suddenly it’s his life’s mission to make me miserable.”
Blaise laughed, finally losing the strain in his voice.
Cedric snickered and locked eyes with Harry. “Well, if he ever does plot your demise, you should give me a call. I’ll help you fight him off. You take the tutor and I’ll take the giant snake.”
me: man, i wouldn't know what to write about
“Hey cutie.”
This was the birth of his coffee shop romance.
Tom hummed in consideration.
“I have coupons! The dance troupe people gave them to me out of pity. I was going to invite Draco, but—”
After Tom asked Harry how much French he currently knew and was met with a stuttered ‘b-bonsoir,’ however, everything went downhill.
“So,” Harry began, once Sirius had put on one of his oversized sweatshirts (they were the only clothes Harry had that fit the taller boy). “I saw that you commented on my vlog.”
Harry attempted to sound aloof, but with Sirius’s presence drawing out all the air from his lungs, he sounded a bit more desperate than he would have liked.
“Harry, you know—you’re different,” Sirius said quietly.
“Aren’t your guardians… like… abusive? Or something?”
“I—God, I’ve been in love with him since we were kids, you know? And I always somehow thought that we’d end up together but then he met Lily and I just—I knew he wouldn’t feel the same way about me. And then I saw your video and all I could think about was how much you looked like James. And you had that cute little rainbow pin in your hair and I thought maybe I’d actually have a chance.”
Harry laughed aloud, recalling how silly he must have looked.

“Yes, well, I think it’s only proper if I say it now. I am sorry, Harry, truly. You didn’t deserve that.”

anyways as an apology, here's a double update with two new characters!! hope you enjoy, and I will look forward to seeing all you lovely new and familiar faces in the comments!
“I’m not surprised. Every one of your dormmates seems to be lacking in not only decorum, but common sense as well. Did Weasley attempt to use chocolate syrup as ink again?” Draco sneered.
“Hermione, listen! Sirius Black found my vlog!” Harry wheezed out.
