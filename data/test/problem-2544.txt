Draco saw the realization arrive in Harry’s eyes, glared at him and walked away. A part of Harry wanted to laugh, he was so fucking slow sometimes. He went back to his table with Ron and Hermione, dropped everything nonchalantly, to Hermione’s annoyance, and unfolded the note;
Once he calmed down his breathing he finally noticed Hermione’s soft hand on top of his clenched fist. He turned to look at her and her expression pleaded for him to calm down. It also warned him that they were going to talk about it later.
“I didn’t see much… But I heard what he doesn't want you to tell Hermione.”
Draco looked at him apprehensively, “Why?”
The hardest part though was the moment after the meeting, when they were leaving The Three Broomsticks and Molly held Harry back while Ron walked ahead, maybe unaware, maybe not.
Ron sighed, “This wasn’t you?” Harry shook his head.
Harry remembered the scar that could still adorn Draco’s neck if he fails to keep him away from Lucius or Bellatrix. He remembers the bindings in the suffocating room in a world where he’s driven to insanity by Draco’s death. He remembers the feel of the man on his lap as he holds on to a sleeping infant in his arms.
Harry’s dry look must have been enough of an answer.
“I don’t know. It went nowhere.”
Draco was quiet for a long time before he finally replied, “There’s bound to be someone out here or in the Slytherin dorms who know I’m talking to you…”
“If he’s there, his father wouldn’t put him in immediate danger. Let’s go, he’s safer than we are!”
And then he saw the Dursleys, and he saw Dudley. And he knew immediately that Dudley was only hateful and judgemental towards him because his uncles raised him to be that way. That Dudley didn’t know or care or understand homosexuality until his parents explained it to him. That he didn’t care still until his parents told him it was bad. That Dudley has always mimicked his parents. That Dudley was a reflection of the Dursleys adults.
Harry was getting too used to this dumps of baffling information from Draco. Harry had been given the impression that Neville was an orphan like him, due to him living with his grandmother. But Draco has not said the word kill once when referring to the ‘attack’ on the Longbottoms. “And your father told you all of this?”
Harry sighed, “It wasn’t really my plan to die. I’m not suicidal.”
“When he got his arse handed to him by a two year old?”
“Past that point he stopped even attempting to train me, father me or whatever he thought he was doing. Past that point I became a masochist and tried my best to fix something that was broken from the moment I was born.”
Draco laughed sarcastically, “Weasley wants to be friends?”
Ron rolled his eyes, pulling Harry who was about to walk unto some unsuspecting freshmen. “I get crushes, ‘Mione. It’s been four years of school. I’ve seen an array of those. But Harry needs to control himself. Basic self-control. Focus on the damn class and not on blondie.”
“He wouldn’t like you being here, seeing this.”
Draco refused to look at him, shaking his head as Harry approached him, “I don’t need your pity.”
Harry shrugged at Hermione, walking past her towards the stairs, he needed a shower and proper clothes for class.
Harry thought back on Malfoy’s hidden wrists, and figured that his parents had shamed him into hiding his wrist for either:
Harry threw the cloak away, looking at Draco both confused and amused, “You want me to pose your corpse?”
Now Harry wanted to punch Hermione.
“Harry, if you glare any harder the poor boy might alight in flames.” He heard what Hermione said, but saw nothing wrong with it.
Harry truly believed the conversation was over, walked away to another bench to appreciate the empty silence, when he muttered, “I’m not sure.”
He couldn’t help to notice the Malfoys standing tall and proud, with an unbreakable poker face as their son joined them, subtly blending into their cold demeanor.
Draco looked conflicted between smiling in satisfaction, laughing at the play, and glaring at Harry so as to not give Harry the satisfaction of making Draco smile. Harry stared at Draco too much, he realized.
Draco gave a pity smile in return, “Once he’d realized what he’d done he killed himself.” Draco turned to look back at young and innocent Helena, “And that’s our pride and joy, The Bloody Baron. The Grey Lady’s murderer and an example of what happens when you let your desire of something overtake your life.”
“I know your father will not be happy about this, he will probably try to…” He looked discreetly at the Huffies, noticing one had managed to fall asleep at the table and the other one was struggling to stay awake, “He will probably try to ‘scare you away’ from me by… you know.” He sighed, “I know you will probably not heed my warning when I tell you, beg you to stay away from your family, from your dad or your aunt… But I’m done letting fear prevent me from enjoying my life. I just realized how easily I could lose everything, how it could all go away in a blink of an eye, so I will enjoy this while I can, and I want to enjoy it with you. So I came here to ask you to come to the Yule Ball with me and stay away from your family.”
“Your father, does he hate me?” Draco opened his mouth, but Harry interrupted, “Aside from the fact that me existing means that his precious ex-boss is dead. Does he have other reasons to hate me?”
He grimaced, pride evident in the upturn of his nose, “Same could be said for you.”
Harry shrugged, “He seemed terrified that I would suggest that. I think at first he was more offended due the fact that the Yule Ball is so public, and-... Yeah.”
Now for the important stuff.
Halfway through the game, and another stolen glance at Draco, Harry heard Ron sigh, disgruntled.
“... I’m sorry I don’t understand your code. What?” He looked like it was still too early for Harry’s bullshit. He looked tired.
Ron, missing the somber mood, asked, “Why don’t you just ask him?”
Draco was quiet for much longer than Harry would’ve preferred, but at the end, “I don’t know. It’s a cruel day when you realized you’ve never had opinions of your own.” Draco turned to Harry and smiled, “I guess you're in a position to help me create an opinion on the matter.” Harry smiled in return.
Ron shrugged, “If there’s anything I’ve learned from you passing out is that anyone can fake it. Try code.”
Draco slowly lifted his controlled nonchalant expression to Harry as if to say, ‘You brought him here. This is your fault.’, before turning to glare at Ron.
2. Firefox kept trying to spellcheck all the words into American english... "Rumour" to "Rumor", and here I am like.... bruh, google docs got the message after three ignores that this was a british story, when are you gonna get the message?
What was he thinking about? What was he planning? Why was Draco sitting under the rain?
Draco looked up looking somewhat insulted.
Harry didn’t react physically, but his gut told him to leave. Be smarter than Neville and save yourself the trauma, leave.
“Harry Potter!”
After scaring a few students and explaining just why that's a ‘Unforgivable’, he moved on and asked for another one, and Harry was beginning to feel sick. Harry understood in great detail just how horrible it could be to not be in control of yourself, your life, your destiny. And there was a spell for it. And that was the least bad of all the curses. Harry felt physically sick, and wished he was also mentally gone.
Hermione sighed, and looked away towards the group of students gossiping on the bottom floor.
“A-... kind-, no… not loyal either… I don’t know, fuck it. Hufflepuffs can do bad things too if coupled with greed!”
Draco nodded, “Mom implied he was… absent during my first year alive, focused on death eater business. It was after my first birthday that he… met his son.” He looked down at his wrist, and Harry winced at the slight finger marks surrounding both the names, “That’s when the names become more visible. Readable.” Draco sighed, “And he was mad to come home and find that his name was on one of his infant son’s wrists.” Draco shrugged, “For a while it meant nothing, though regardless he never let mum let me out of the manor, or let anyone visit me. Mum convinced him that whoever was the other name would be my… enemy. That this meant he and I would have a wonderful relationship as father and son.”
After two weeks of stressing and constantly being disappointed when Draco walked towards him only to keep walking past him, Hermione kicked everyone out of the boys dorms and sat Harry down, looking for answers. She did not like them.
Forgive me for the two rants in the a/n in the previous chapter. I could have maybe rephrase them better, but I don't apologize for either.
Harry and Hermione looked up, baffled. Ron didn’t poke the nest, he hammered it to the ground. Harry flinched as he saw the indignation and a small sense of betrayal cross Draco’s eyes as he stood up, still confused and now angry. He kept trying to glance at Harry and Harry really wanted people to not look at him so he could at the very least mouth something to him to let him know it was all for show. Ron pushed forward, nearly getting in Draco’s personal space causing everyone around them to huddle towards them, expecting a fight.
And that didn’t sit well at all with the Dursleys.
Draco paused, “... Your parents’ death wasn’t a spectacle.”
Hermione laughed quietly and turned back to Ginny to continue talking statistics.
“It’s not safe for-”
Draco’s arms moved and Harry then noticed he was staring at his wrists. Names clearly visible. And he should not have been shocked, but it still made his mouth slightly dropped at seeing something he’d already convinced himself was true.
“You don’t have to-”
Excuse time:
“I’d like to have a semblance of control in this situation.”
School was normal for a few days, almost a week, with Harry fooling himself into thinking he could just ignore the shit show that was his life. But he couldn’t.
… Had… had either Malfoy seen…?
Ron smiled, “You like that h-” Harry glared at Ron as he was about to say ‘he’, “Lefty, err, you like that Lefty trusts you?”
“He said a few wrong words while petting his hippogriff, but Ron greatly exaggerated. He did not attack the hippogriff at all.” Harry wasn’t even glaring at anyone, not really. He was glaring at the empty space between Ron and Mr. Weasley, imagining Lucius Malfoy there, wondering how much of this was his fault.
Harry gave a short sarcastic laugh, “Lust? Sloth? Envy?”
Draco shook his head and walked away. Harry remained frozen, Hermione’s words ringing in his ear until the Fat Lady told him, “He’s waiting by the stairs, you fool.” Harry jump-started and ran out, thanking the Fat Lady and following Draco wherever he wanted to take him. He’d suspected the Astronomy tower but instead found himself in front of the Slytherin entrance. Harry looked at Draco.
If you came back here through some other method... still go back and make sure you did read chapter 8.
Please leave a comment.
Ron scoffed, “How would you had done it? Hermione’s had us glued to your hip since the other schools arrived, and unless you know Legilimency…”
So when the letter arrived on the twenty-fifth of December with the prim and proper and rushed signature from Narcissa addressing Draco, all three boys held their breath in the hidden comfort of an empty classroom on the fifth floor. How had Ron ended up part of the crew? Harry figured after all the letters he’d sent bitching to his mother to reply to their queries Draco would get the message that Ron meant him no harm, so when Draco eyed him desperately while tightly gripping a letter, Harry dragged Ron along for the ride.
Then after school ended it was vacations or... "vacations". As I ended up going on a two week trip that ended up being a chore and very emotional traumatizing in many senses. It was a family trip. And to sum it up, one family member confessed she has been suicidal for a while. The one whose at fault for that just... ugh. The another member defended the guilty member and just ... ugh. It was a horrible trip. Never going on a family trip with that side of the family again.
“When will the fucking story end?”
“I will jinx you both if you don’t tell me who lefty is.”
“Yes, but her insults could cut you. So I’d worry about that.” Draco was indignant in his response, realizing he did throw Parkinson under the proverbial bus.
Harry Potter, written messily on his left wrist.
Harry snickered, “You make it sound simpler than it is.” Harry grabbed the hand on his face, covering his wrist knowing- believing based on his dreams that Lucius name is the one he’s helping hide. Harry kissed his fingers, his thumb rubbing against the name, almost wishing he could rub it off, not just of his wrist, but his life. “You can trust me.”
The first thing that happened when he left the tent was that the sun… blinded him. Not good. The second thing thing that happened was his eyes adjusting to the sun and immediately noticing its glow on a particularly blond head, that tried to hide in the crowd. Not good either, since all of these things distracted him from the FUCKING DRAGON!
Harry nodded and followed Ron towards the closest male’s bathroom, where Ron handed him his bag. “Store your clothes there.”
“Because he respects my decisions and-”
Zabini just moved his hands inside his jacket.
He shook his head, a small prideful smile making small youthful wrinkles of joy on his face, “Wear my shoes long enough and you’ll become an expert at stealthing around and gathering information people don’t want you to hear.”
It was a long, sad walk that would sometimes irk Harry when either Ron made up crap about Draco or Mr. Weasley talked ill of a child he knew nothing about. It was long, but he finally understood Ron and Draco and their hatred for each other. They didn’t really hate each other, not naturally at least. They were trained so by their father’s and their petty hatred for one another. And so both boys made it to Hogwarts with prejudices about each other’s family, planted in their heads by their fathers.
“When impactful things like these have been decided for you long before you were born, when what kind of relationship you are going to have with strangers or your own family members gets decided before you even take your first breath… I had no control over this. And I’ll never do. Someone dictated long ago that me and my father would never get along. That regardless of my every effort he will dislike everything I do, every choice, every smile, every breath.” Draco sighed shaking his head and walking backwards until his back hit the wall, sliding down against it, “He blames me for it. Like I’d somehow had some sort of control over it. He blames me for it. He once came home disgruntled that some people at the ministry kept asking him why he hid his son’s soul markings.
“I don’t know… about the Yule Ball and… It’s not that easy.”
Though three hours into dance lessons Harry was beginning to consider if he had some sort of attention deficit. He was becoming extremely aware that Hermione had been constantly dragging Ron and his attention back to the lessons, in some cases literally dragging Harry back to the lessons. He figured after stepping on Hermione’s feet for half an hour she would relent and let him leave this infernal lesson, but regardless, it’s been three hours now and both Ron and Hermione were determined to break Harry.
“Can you tell me about your wrists?”
“You won’t tell me what to do. But I want you to understand I would strip myself bare for your trust.” Draco swallowed, his eyes slightly shaking with temptation to look, Harry nodded, “However dangerous it may be for me. I would turn the world upside down just to have you be a part of my life. And not with the role you currently play.”
Harry was getting too used to the plate of stasis-heated food sitting on his nightstand and the rest of his roommates snoring in the night.
Wait… how long had he been staring at Malfoy? Had he had that smile the entire time? Had Malfoy also been staring back the entire time? Why didn’t Ron stop him? Why didn’t he stop now that he was aware? He tried… But Malfoy was staring back. Not angry, not confused, not aggravated. Just curious... Innocent curiosity. Like he was trying to have a silent conversation with Harry, with just their eyes. Harry didn’t need words to know Malfoy just wanted to know why he was staring, and behind that question was the more important one; why was he smiling while doing so…
Harry took a step forward back to Draco.
… It wouldn’t change anything. He could delay it as much as possible, but as soon as Harry took Draco to the Yule Ball, Lucius would get wind of it. All he would be delaying was the beating… Wait… Until when? They weren’t getting a Christmas break to go home, they haven’t left the school besides for the tournament. That meant Lucius was coming to the school.
The three remained in silence until Hermione realized they were not remembering the details that were screaming at her inside her mind, “Guys!”
Draco looked frustrated and it looked like it had more to do with the tear that escaped than Harry’s insistence, but Harry was a close second, “This is none of your damn fucking business!”
Malfoy shut down in a second, turning stone cold and walking away.
Harry got up early the next morning, hoping to get to breakfast without too much of a crowd, at least, that’s what he was gonna tell Hermione.
Harry didn’t move from his bench, and it was not a good position, visually, since there was a statue of a young girl holding a basket of flowers, overtaken by vines, flowers and bushes in the middle of the garden. He could only see half of him and that didn’t include his face -which Harry believed Malfoy had done on purpose-. Maybe the fake animosity will let Malfoy talk to him.
Malfoy was having a quiet conversation with Parkison and Zabini. They were laughing, quietly, and in that moment Harry wanted nothing more than for everyone to shut so he could hear his laughter. His quiet laughter. How he expressed joy in the intimate private moments. How would his quiet laughter sound like at two in the morning after a long night of drinks, snacks and a little bit of fun-
Harry told Hermione the truth, “I think I am… But I’m not one hundred percent sure if I mean the same thing to him as he does to me.” AKA… unrequited love. It’s horrible, but when it happens, it means that the person who was assigned as your soulmate, to them you were assigned as their enemy.
Lets see. Finals were... rough. I thought I was going to flunk a class for the first time in my life. As an honor student, straight up panic. And I panicked so hard I reached the zen level of indifference and numbness. But I survived.
An edge of douchebaggery climbed up Harry’s throat as he itched to reply with a prickly ‘why do you care?’, so he took a breather. “Bad life.”
Want the truth? Up until this chapter, I had no idea what those dream/visions/memory were. They were inspired by a Star Wars Reylo fic. But I had no idea how to connect it to HP. But eh, I made soulmates and enemymates world. This world is mine to do whatever I want in it. And I think I've made a decision.
Harry ignored him, wrapping his wrist once again, not ready to go through this with the entire Weasley clan, all in one night, “He’s not done for. He can’t be.”
“June. If you want a timeline, then fucking June is when I realized things weren’t so black and white. June is when I decided to give you a chance.” He saw in Draco’s eyes as he contemplated what happened during that time and Harry decided to correct his vagueness, “June of second year. I personally discovered something that made me understand what was really going on. I tried last year to talk to you, but … you know…”
“Ron, crushes are hard. Give him a break.”
“When aren’t you?” Draco was staring at the hands, watching how his name on Harry’s wrist rubbed against his father’s name on his own. He twisted his hand to avoid that, not pulling away though.
“I believe you already did.”
“It is. You tell me you’re ready to leave that bastard you call father behind and I could have every professor in this school looking for a safe house for you and your mom in a matter of minutes. You’d have a new home before your father even realized you were leaving.”
The awkwardness was temporarily gone, replaced by undeniable joy that was soon interrupted by a disgusted groan from a newcomer.
Harry stared at the diary in front of him. He saw the memory, and he more confused now than he has ever been before. This was Tom Riddle’s diary, that was Tom Riddle’s memory. That happened fifty years ago. His soul mate was … 70? I mean, granted from the memory, Tom was very attractive,  but by now he should be 70… a problem for later.
Eventually Dean grew annoyed and angrily stormed to the door, aggressively opening it by the sound of it and going off on the midnight visitor, “What the fuck! It’s one in the morning on exam night! We need to fucking rest! Take your knocking and shove it up your arse!”
Hermione giggled and nodded, giving Harry a soft pat on his shoulder, “What is it? I promise I won’t tell any living or dead soul.”
“I told you-”
I hope you enjoyed it.
Harry nodded, “That does suck. But not as bad as going to Azkaban at the hand of one of your best friends and getting blamed for the death of your other two best friends.”
Hermione smiled, big, like she just gave them the answer to all their problems.
Harry had nothing most of his life and the only thing keeping his faith in place was the knowledge that there was someone out there who belonged only to him. And he can’t do shit about it.
Harry grimaced, “I can protect you.” Harry shrugged, “I have a good track record-”
The look of baffling joy that spread across her face was something, and it had a bit of mockery to it, “It’s odd, but apparently being dumped by you is a great way to boost your popularity! Much more if I was dumped for a boy. They pity me.”
It took three firm squeezes from Hermione before he realized that class was over. Many students had left, a few hindered around either gawking at Harry or Neville. Moody was shooing them away, trying to get a moment alone with Neville, telling Harry that he had to see it, he had to know what happened.
Harry does not feel so good.
Draco still didn’t take it.
Harry smiled. And he would never admit it to anyone, but that note would remain hidden under his pillow. Just like how he would never tell anyone where he got the afghan from, not for any reasons of shame, but for the sake of keeping himself on Malfoy’s good side.
Draco turned around confused, “That’s what he told you?”
After staring at a few students, Moody finally picked a kid when Neville raised his hand, “Yes, boy?”
Harry shook his head, “You’re right. None of my business.” Harry knew he had gone too hard to back off now, but Harry had been harmed by his uncle when he was small. Harry knew how humiliating it could feel to admit that someone who you’re trying to make love you and that you love, maybe unconditionally, hurt you in ways they shouldn’t. It was not a matter of pride. It’s a matter of hope. Hope that they would change. And you don’t want them in jail when they do. Draco was not going to admit to his father hitting him.
And like Hermione insinuated for him to do, just as they were leaving Hermione just happened to trip, pushing Harry perfectly in Draco’s direction. Neither were expecting it. Harry picked himself up quickly, making sure his hand graced Draco’s, a note stealthily -hopefully- passed, and then forced himself not to apologize or help him as Ron dragged him away.
Why did this take longer, after I told you I was gonna write it?
Harry had learned long ago to wear long sleeves to hide his wrist in fear of being bullied for having both male names on his wrist. Once both Dudley and Harry had been old enough to understand the concept of morals, homosexuality, and shame, Dudley had joined on his parents’ bandwagon of shaming Harry for having both male names. So, Harry hid his wrists.
Ron blinked a few times, as though he couldn’t understand, and he didn’t, “What was a lie?”
Draco stood up, rubbing his face and hair in panic and pacing around the room, muttering over and over, “Not today, not tonight, not so soon.”
“I know,” Ron shrugged as he got up, dropping the invisibility cloak on Harry’s lap, “Mom replied. She’ll come visit this weekend.”
“I’m under the impression that he was the one who gave information to You-know-who and made them a target in the first place. At least, that’s what my father implied when discussing it with Goyle’s father. I could have misunderstood.”
Draco sighed, grimacing at Harry and following after his father.
“Who’s Lefty?”
Harry didn’t look back.
“Uncooperative!” Hermione yelled from the bench.
Draco looked back at Harry, the question in his eyes, in his eyebrows, and Harry mouthed
Harry didn’t realize how much time had passed, sitting next to a quiet Draco until he noticed the candles were being put out on their own and sunlight was beginning to appear at the end of some hallways. He turned to look at Draco only to realize why he’d never replied.
Malfoy glared at him and looked away.
Harry missed the first three periods, Ron claiming that he had noticed Harry had snuck out and that Harry had trouble going to sleep and that he had not desired to disturb his precious sleep. Since the closer this task got the more rare it became.
“You and me, Yule ball.”
Molly shook her head and ushered the kids to go to bed, so when Arthur got … honest, Harry was already too far away and all he heard was ‘Malfoy’.
“Greed.”
Hermione then pulled them both behind her and ran ahead, catching up with Ginny and pretending she didn’t just threaten them both.
He would deal with it later.
Ron sighed and shook his head, “Not something so blatant and stupid as what first-years do. Just ask him what did he want from you during the first year. To be your friend, or to assess the enemy.”
“It’s easier to hide the bruising under his shirt or trousers.”
Harry sat in bed for hours till morning came telling himself over and over again “When the day starts I will ask Draco to the Yule Ball, warn him as vaguely as possible that his father will beat him for it, try to convince him to find a way to disconnect himself from his family, and I promise I won’t let Draco go to the Ministry mission next year”.
Draco nodded, “You do. You, who are already a part of history, need to know what happened before you, how history was shaped and what the biased history books remove in belief that that information was not important. What is misinformation, what is gossip believed to be truth. How did those wars end, how to prevent another one… How to end one.”
“Someone’s… Someone… I just remembered I was supposed to send a letter to my father. I’ll be back later, Pans. Don’t-” Draco looked in Harry’s direction, confused, “Don’t wait up?”
Harry walked forward and reached for Draco’s hand, allowing Draco to decide whether he wanted to grab them or not. Waiting patiently.
Harry sighed, trying to get comfortable once again.
“And look at how well that turned out.”
Harry nodded.
Draco didn’t push him away, he just sighed, like he was tired of fighting. Fighting what? Fighting this? Harry hopes it is fighting this.
“She’s more strong willed than you think.” Harry murmured, also disturbed at the idea of Hermione walking in while any of them…
Malfoy didn’t back down from his glare disguised as indifference, but didn’t say anything more. Moody nodded. He didn’t bother explaining what the curse was before moving to his desk and pulling out a spider, placing it on the table and performing the curse on it.
The boy ignored Ron as he glared at Hermione, “How did you do it? If anyone would have figured out a way to get past Dumbledore it would be you.”
“Nothing.” Ron shook his head, dropping a few treats on Harry’s lap and making for the door, “I’ll get you some tea.”
Arthur then fussed and sat besides Harry along with the Diggorys, blocking the Malfoys from his view.
And it took her a second. “Oh!”
He knew that Ron had a hard time realizing that the know it all brat was his soul mate and that Hermione fussed for a while about the prick who was hers, but now they amicably accepted and are testing out their friendship to see how good this could be. Neither questioned which wrist was the enemy when both Hermione and Ron had Bellatrix Lestrange, a criminal who currently resided in Azkaban.
“Lefty’s dad was here last night.” Harry didn’t look away from Ron or Hermione, but was incredibly aware that people were stalling, wanting gossip on Harry… so … Lefty. “He looked annoyed about me being there. Lefty didn’t look happy.”
“Ask the other champions!?” Harry exclaimed quietly, while Ron exclaimed slightly louder than a whisper, earning a kick from Harry.
Still kidding, thanks for reading. Will try to have the next chapter up before the 15.
Harry swallowed, his lips pursing, trying to find more words to explain-
He sighed, “Greed is a very vague word. But it could be said it is the root of evil. You-know-who did what he did due to his greed for power and authority. My father did… maybe even does, but did what he did for the same reasons. My mother married my father in her greed for protection and a life of very little worries… Oh how disappointed she must be. I-...”
Regardless, here's the real reason for getting this chapter 3 WEEKS after it had been completed: I forgot. Thank milicavanilica13 for posting a comment and reminding me. It appears the comment is gone so I'm sad I couldn't reply and thank you for your insight and for reminding me this story existed.
Harry glared at Ron who panicked and squeaked, “Mr. Malfoy?”
Draco was silent, and Harry nodded, letting him ponder on what he said. But eventually other students began to come in, and Draco sighed, “Let me think about it.”
Dean didn’t add anything more before dropping the curtain and shuffling back to his bed, dropping on it like a log.
Malfoy huffed, moving towards the base of the stairs, where Harry would land in a minute when the stairs finally made it back to him. “
Harry nodded and got up, heading towards the stairs to change into his school robes only to stop at the end of hall, where Ron and Hermione were sitting by the stairs, Hermione with a book in her lap and Ron with a bundle of fabric that Harry could quickly guess what it was.
Draco considered it, “It-... It would help.”
“Neither do you and Draco, but nonetheless, here we are.”
“But no one knows what happened. James and Lily Potter just died at the hands of You-Know-Who protecting their only son, who then proceeded to become the only person on earth to ever survive a killing curse. That’s what you’re known for. Surviving the impossible.”
“At first?”
“Can I ask Hermione for help?”
Harry smiled as she dabbed more on his cheek that slowly healed. It hurt, but her caring did make it better.
He turned from the flower bush to find Malfoy sitting on a cold stone bench, almost hidden between rose bushes.
When he reached the top of the tower though, it fluttered and left him blank.
Harry knew he was pouting, but didn’t know why. He was frustrated yes, he had all the answers, yes, but… He didn’t know what to do here. He tried to show Draco his wrists once and he straight up panicked. His dreams keep telling him that moving forward romantically with Draco would lead him down a dangerous path. So… why?
He was tired of being the biggest man in town, the hero, the warrior. For maybe an hour all he wanted to be was a teenage boy in the arms of his soulmate sharing a kiss that stole all rhyme or reason from Harry’s head.
“You couldn’t hear it?”
He can’t recall the walk downstairs, he was fighting to both hold on to his sleep and also get rid of it all through it, but the moment the portrait moved aside, he was wide awake.
Malfoy didn’t say anything, just stood there patiently, analyzing Harry with an air of superiority. Only his fidgeting fingers scratching at his trousers gave him away. He nodded, “Bad night?”
Draco looked around confused, clearing his throat and buying time to come up with an answer, “Besides you costing us a house-elf?”
Harry turned to look at Draco who was bare as bare could be, hope covering every inch of his face, “Promise me it will end well.”
Haha, just kidding. That's not how it works like here.
“Tell that to your face… and lips. It went somewhere, you just didn’t reach the finish line.” Ron bemused. Hermione groaned in disgust, “Ronald!” And it genuinely took Ron a few seconds before he flinched back, “NO! That’s not what I meant! I meant that aside from all the snogging that they probably did, based on his answers, Malfoy probably didn’t agree to anything. He took a few steps towards the finish line, but…” He turned to look at Harry and Harry shrugged, a smirk on his face as he finished, “I don’t know.”
The girls all seemed to calm down as Delacour finally left and the boys all sat down. And the tension grew, as now every student in Hogwarts waited.
Harry nodded to himself, or at least that's how it would look like to everyone else, before turning to Hermione to do whatever she wanted him to do. Astronomy tower at midnight. Fuck sleep, he’ll sleep when he’s dead. For now he’s gotta enjoy every second he gets with Draco.
Harry found Draco sitting alone on the Slytherin table having fruits for breakfast. He nodded and stalked forward, slightly thankful that there were only two other students in the hall, both Hufflepuffs who looked like they were falling asleep on both their breakfast and their homework.
Harry sat up, having slept basically nothing and still feeling refreshed and ready for a rowdy day of magical creatures and awkward glances, “Well, I have a blond to make uncomfortable today, so if you don’t mind.”
ENJOY!
Harry snuck to him, whispering, “Stop making a show and walk away.”
Draco closed his eyes in what appeared to be annoyance but the faint smile that appeared later showed that Draco enjoyed explaining this as much as Hermione did, “Helga Hufflepuff, who was also a Hufflepuff by marriage, had a son named Henry, Godric Gryffindor had a daughter named Sarena who was hard to track down for historians seeing as there was nearly no document stating she was a Gryffindor by birth, only her married name Sarena Peverall, and Salazar Slytherin has no known heirs, but the family name and… spirit went on with his nieces and nephews. Caught up?”
That night he had another vision-less night. Dreamless even. And so on it went for a few days, to the point where Harry began to think it was a metaphor for the stillness in progress in real life. But in the moments of insomnia at three am in the morning, that wise old voice in his head told him it was because he has done nothing significant to affect the future, so it had nothing to show.
Draco continued nodding until what Harry added sunk in, and then stared at Harry with wide-eyes, “What do you mean?”
The burst. The flame. The paper.
Draco turned to - what they could only guess- steal a glance at Harry, before blatantly panicking at seeing both Harry and Ron staring at him, and turning away to aggressively watch the game.
Standing there listening to the magical silence Harry could understand why many people would devoid themselves of feeling love. This… sucks. Your emotional well being depending on someone else sucks. The disgust and self-hatred you feel at failing to rescue them on time sucks. The waiting sucks.
“No.” The smile shifted to that of someone keeping a secret, “It seems like someone, oh I don’t know, forgot the entire reason why he came here in the first place?” Ron extended his hand for another attempt to teach Harry.
He entered the storage room, eyes focused on the paper, trying to memorize it all temporarily for easy finding. Between waiting for other groups to get their ingredients and getting help from other students in terms of how much he should grab, he didn’t really notice who was in the room. Dried Nettles. Harry now needed Dried Nettles and he was set. Dried- Fuck.
Hermione sneered, feeling slightly insulted, “You couldn’t have expected answers from us. There’s only one person who can answer your questions, and you two have made him somewhat aggressive towards all of us, so now none of us can approach him.”
“You are evil.” He smiled nonetheless, shaking his head, “Using your priviledge like that.”
Draco scoffed, “I’m not!” The once-over Harry gave him made Draco aware of his backing away, “I just like my personal space.”
Harry didn’t like that answer, “Help?”
Neville looked baffled, before glancing behind Harry for a second and calming down, shrugging as he settled in bed, taking his shoes off, “The Fat Lady would not have been so nonchalant about it. She’s supposed to protect us.”
“No.”
“Err… Why wha-”
The new school is in and there's been contact
Harry smiled and nodded as Ron walked out, “Thank you for keeping watch.”
Hermione sighed, and raised her eyebrows at Harry, “When Ron is telling you to pay attention, you’re not doing good. Try to focus a little.”
Deep inside he understood why Draco had reservations in letting someone else in. Everyone who had been in before only disappointed him, just like Dursleys had with Harry. And then when Harry peaked out of the walls he hid himself in, he found the Weasleys who welcomed him with open arms full of love.
Ron groaned and Harry huffed, trying to ignore her, but knowing well that she was right. They’ve only been in Hogwarts for three years and they’ve had their share of dangerous and thrilling adventures.
“Your father and aunt, Crouch Jr and Peter Petigrew.”
Hermione didn’t buy it, “You, figure it out?”
Harry shrugged and muttered, “Don’t they think the gays are Satan's way of luring innocent men to hell?”
Ron closed the door as Harry yelled, “WHAT’S ON THAT NOTE RON?”
He sighed, “He overheard.”
Ron didn’t look up from his cauldron, really interested in how it’s content seemed to be getting darker by the second. Hermione paused for a second, and then shrugged, accepting Harry’s word. When Hermione turned to read further instructions Harry turned to look at Ron, the question in his eyes. Ron barely smiled and shrugged.
Draco sighed, looking at his shoes for a second before climbing on to the desk in front of Harry, “What?”
Other than that... Yes, this chapter was mostly filler. I did not want to rush to the Yule ball since that would be the schoolwide confession and when the Lucius bomb would in some way drop (though I already dropped a tiny one).
Hermione sighed and Harry turned to look at them. Harry wondered if either of them realize that they’ve taken the role of his fill-in parents, their smiles tender as they watched their boy finally get a glimpse of joy. Harry shrugged.
Ron shrugged, looking at Hermione with the peace of a promise made at birth, that no matter what got in between, at the end of the story it would be them together, a trust of each other placed in the souls at birth, “If she wants to experiment and play the field a bit I wouldn’t really care. It’s me at the end of her nights, just like no matter what it will be her at the end of mine.”
Harry didn’t let his smile drop, putting on confidence he didn’t feel, and just shrugged, giving him one last look before pretending to go back to whatever conversation Ron was having with Hermione regarding the two bearded twins. Maybe he should pay attention… Why did Fred and George have beards?
“The goblet chose you. Apparently...” Hermione looked so scared.
Harry was a few cold symptoms away from being the poster boy for stress.
But Harry now understood why Draco was so determined to introduce himself during first year. Imagine growing up seeing this name on your wrist and knowing who it was and that soon you were going to meet them…
“Alright, eat the pineapple and I’ll annoy you tomorrow.” Harry smiled, a bit mischievous.
Draco, on the other hand, kept getting louder and more panicked with every question, “What are you implying about yourself?”
I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry.
So maybe it was them setting him back.
“Potter!”
He smiled, enjoying the little fantasies Draco drew up of a world where he had been sorted into Slytherin.
She continued laughing and Harry sarcastically joined in, bitter that people were talking shit on his dancing behind his back, “Ha ha, funny, it’s you.”
Harry opened his mouth to relate it all to him, but Draco interrupted him.
Harry had no idea where he was pulling all of this from, but Harry wanted to touch Draco and fool himself into thinking his fingers could heal his injuries, “I spent the majority of my youth covered in bruises and being taught the million ways to hide them. School would’ve had a lot of questions. You could say I’m a bit of an expert.”
The reactions were mixed, as half the french school cheered for the girl, and the other half cried over not being chosen. The boys from all schools seemed to be excited no matter what. Not all boys. Ron was. Hermione smirked and shook her head as Harry held Ron down, keeping him from some involuntary reaction that seemed to have taken over many of the boys. Harry looked around and almost picked up the pattern regarding the boys that weren’t affected, but in the end he looked at Hermione as she whispered, “Gay. The Veela charm won’t affect you.” Harry ‘oh’ed as he finally understood what was going on with Ron and immediately tried to find Malfoy to see if it was affecting him too.
Anyway, thanks for the comment Verotica, otherwise I would've forgotten to post this chapter.
“And you know what?”
It’s been almost a week of class, and they could already read him like a book. And they were trying to save him from himself.
The redhead nodded, passing the note to Hermione, “Anyone we maybe know with this penmanship?” Hermione shook her head, “I don’t exactly pay attention to that.”
Harry bit his lip, “Cooler? You are making him sound like a deranged spoiled brat who is reckless and looks for fights just for attention.”
I was (still am) under a lot of stress due to school and the disappearance of a close classmate of mine. If you feel that Harry's ooc, then I apologized. I let my emotions guide this chapter.
Forgive me if you disagree. Can't wait to read your comment saying so. Regardless, chapter nine will be coming in a few minutes.
“Hey, look at me.” Harry grumbled, looking up at Diggory who had a firm expression on his face as he squeezed Harry’s shoulder in reassurance, “You’ve survived way worse than this. You survived the death curse. A stupid tournament isn’t going to be the end of you.”
“Dumbledore put a protection around the goblet, that’s what the glowing ring is. If you think for a second you are smarter than Dumbledore, go ahead and try. Don’t come asking me for help afterwards.” After glaring at Ron for an extra second to intensify the threat, Hermione sighed and went back to her book.
Ron shrugged and left.
“A wise greedy man could fool a whole unknowing village into thinking he was god, or govern and take advantage of a nation.”
They all turned to Harry, remembering once again that Harry grew repressed from everything he should have known.
Harry shrugged, “You came willingly. You could have ignored me and gone back in.”
Malfoy never let his eyes hinder on Harry for more than a second, in fact, he never let it hinder on anything for more than a second. He was nervous. “I had a feeling you didn’t.”
Later was now, Ginny slowly dying right next to him. Tom Riddle spelling his name with his, Harry’s, wand, looking just as beautiful as he did 50 years ago. Watching as the letters rearranged themselves to spell the name of the enemy every told him he had, but he didn’t think much of due to the name on his wrist.  I am Lord Voldemort.
“The… The cruciatus curse.” Neville sounded sick, like he was about to puke… Like those words were his vomit.
Harry nodded, walking towards the sinks.
Hermione nodded, her curls bouncing with her excitement, hitting Harry and Ron in the process, “If you’re his enemy, and they are in the side of You-Know-Who, why keep you separated? Is more beneficial for them to keep you close. Hell, is more beneficial for them to pretend and make you believe you are his soulmate to trick you and get your trust. The play they are making doesn’t make sense if he’s your enemy.”
Draco could be a prick, but Harry had as much dirt on him as Draco had on Harry. Not that he would ever use it, but he could understand where an apprehensive Slytherin could be coming from.
Comments are appreciated!
“Not yet what!?”
“Lucius is on his right.”
Harry jumped out of the fire’s way and hid behind rocks, wondering if this was it, what it would all amount to, a dumb competition and his charred body in the grasp of a dragon.
Hours later the sun was shining on his face and Harry hated Hermione for insisting they’d sit by the window to help him stay awake. Harry had spent the majority of the day fighting for consciousness, losing his resolve during History of Magic, not consciously falling asleep, but passing out from exhaustion.
Harry turned to Hermione, “What happ-”
HAHAHAHAH Guess who has a fucking investigation to do and instead wrote another chapter..
“Is only fair. Ask Diggory if he’s figured out the egg. You’re only in fourth year, he’s a senior. Try and use pity.”
And only then did Harry realize that he has never seen Malfoy with short sleeves.
“I’m impossible?”
Harry slightly flinched when the crease in his neck where his jaw and his neck connect was covered by the palm of Draco’s hand and he had all but a second before his mind was silenced. And Harry felt small. Harry felt so small as his hands reached and pulled on the neck of Draco’s shirt, needing him so close, needing him to never pull away, feeling a tickle in his stomach as Draco’s hands slowly left his neck and snaked their way around his back, his waist, looking for the same proximity. Harry’s hands reaching up and wrapping around his neck.
He looked around in the dark, grasping at the afghan, holding it tight as panic surged in him as he remembered the … vision… ?
Malfoy nodded and remained quiet as well, letting Harry ponder it.
“I hate them.”
Harry tuned out after Ron started talking about him being her brother and how it was natural for him to worry. Not to disregard it, his worry was legit, but Hermione was also right. And Harry wasn’t interested in hearing her convince him about it.
Harry nodded, pulling it from his trousers and handing it to Ron. Even now he wished it was more burnt.
Harry looked away, abashed, and nodded.
Harry shook his head, stubborn to not learn at this point, “Bold of you to assume I understand patterns.”
“Peter Petigrew? The guy who Sirius Black kill-”
Zabini sighed as they came into view, Parkinson’s arm looped with Draco and Zabini hiding his hands in his jacket.
Draco looked up, analyzing the anger that has yet to leave Harry ever since he found out the truth of the shit show that became of the marauders. “I think my mother mentioned once that the Potters had been close with Sirius Black. It wasn’t in a good tone, or a remorseful one. The Blacks were not happy that he had ended up a Gryffindor. He’s considered a traitor in… what’s left of his family.”
They all remained quiet while they pondered this, Hermione settling back on the bed and Ron leaning against one of the bed poles. Harry on the other hand made the mistake of laying down on the bed, and the accumulated lack of sleep from the past few weeks-
“And then he’ll take a break to have a talk with his son in private?”
Harry wondered if there was a word to describe that very… relatable feeling. Because it was one that hunted him as well as he filled the empty silence with talks about his average dancing skills, the rumors with Ginny and just… anything that he’d seen or noticed this past few days. Neither boy should be talking, they both realized. Their worry was too much to enjoy the company of each other or the pleasures of conversations or… snogging.
(See the end of the chapter for
Molly shook her head, “The elitist, high-class, Pure-blooded families usually show off their newborn children with parties and newspapers clipping. It was odd from the beginning, but-...” She looked at Harry, facing a guilt she’s denied feeling for years, “But we all lied to ourselves and pretended it was normal, so none of us would have to be the one to deal with it. The rotting spread so much we became a part of it. And it shames me to even admit this, but that’s why I’m helping. Because I became part of the problem I criticize so much. Nothing I do now will ever make up for turning a blind-eye to the signs of an abused child, but I should at least make an effort.”
Harry lightly squeezed his neck, getting Draco’s attention, making him look him in the eyes as he whispered reluctantly, “Your- your father.” Draco closed his eyes again, Harry feeling him swallow the lump on his throat, feeling him barely shiver in his hand, the wind having nothing to do with it. Harry nodded, “Until it's safe for you, no one has to know.”
But only two minutes before class started, he waltzed in, no care in the world, and joined Zabini on a desk at the far back. Never looked at Harry, nothing.
That actually made Draco pause, having expected another reply and having been already ready to knock Harry down, mouth open. He smirked and nodded, still not looking at him. “I’ve been told that’s a sin. One of the worst crimes you can commit, bad enough to tarnish your soul and forbid your entrance to a higher place, a miraculous afterlife.”
“Besides that. Besides the whole accusing him of putting Ginny’s life in danger with that journal. Or the house-elf, or anything that happened during Second Year.” Harry’s eyes said he was not messing around and wanted no more joke answers, Draco’s eyes said he wanted to leave.
He unclenched his fists, ignoring the pain of his nails carving into his palms.
“It was.”
“And he doesn’t want the humiliation of having to dance with your two left feet.” She finished, nodding like there was no other answer. She burst out laughing again at Harry’s insulted face, “After the dancing lessons that’s all everyone talked about, who would be the poor idiot who’d have to dance with you.”
Harry didn’t want disciples waiting on his every word and faltering for his approval. What he wanted from the Weasleys was a family, and seeing them do this irritated him.
Almost all the way to the Grand Hall, Harry felt a chill down his spine and he stopped. He knew the feeling. He was being followed. And whoever it was, was good at it, but slipped because he heard the intake of air through someone’s nose and the halting of movement and sound.
Even the senior champions were nervous about the affair. So Harry knew his stress was justified.
Draco turned to Zabini, “You?”
Harry nodded, stood up and walked away to the Gryffindor table, repeating to himself in his mind over and over again, ‘I will not let Draco go to the Ministry, I will not let Draco go to the Ministry,” Ron and Hermione joined him soon, panicked and confused. Harry shrugged, ‘I will not let Draco go to the Mi-’... why did he need to go to the Ministry?
Harry shrugged, slowly joining Draco and staring up to the stars, “We agreed to meet up with Molly this weekend and try to coerce her into talking with your mom and … yeah, you get it.”
Harry had nothing to say. There was a knot in his stomach, and it had mostly to do with his fear of Draco waking up and finding Ron there. He may be coming to terms with letting Ron and Mione help, but he would definitely be against Ron seeing the bruises that have to be coloring on his face by now.
Ron looked like no matter how hard he tried he couldn’t figure out this math equation, “Why?”
Both Harry and Draco stood there in shocked silence as both contemplated the next few seconds. Draco in silent horror as Harry’s hand covered a gruesome truth. Harry in wonder and frustration, knowing that to gain his trust he would have to ignore the wonderful opportunity in the palm of his hand.
“Draco knows he will have-”
Hermione ignored everyone screaming at her and hid in Ron’s bed, Ron closing the curtain with her inside and turning to Harry, “We are talking about this.” He warned under his breath and Harry shrugged.
Harry was quiet, realizing he didn’t know the answer properly, and that he was the one who prejudice.
He turned to look around and ask another student for help when he saw someone in the corner of his eyes shoving their open palm towards him, “Dried Nettles.”
Hermione, Ron and Harry sat by, watching seniors upon seniors push their friends around to put their names in the goblet, or put their names in themselves. It was a spectacle as they teased each other and dared one another, and there was silence in their trio, but even a stranger could tell how badly Ron and Harry wanted to join the group of reckless teens.
Draco pulled out his wand, sighing as he did the Ventus spell. A beautiful swirl of wind encompassed him, drying him from toe to head. Never one to do a simple drying spell, huh.
Draco nodded then went back to staring at the blank wall.
“Why do you think he was here-”
“My turn, do you know why he hates me?”
Hermione was giving him a look. Harry shrugged.
Harry wanted to go back to glaring at the board, because now that his mind was not occupied with anger and pain, his mind wanted to look at the source of it. See how he was doing. Was he staring at him? Was he thinking about him? Does he also want to join the Triwizard Tournament? Does he care for that stuff?
Now he had to come up with a plan to diffuse Malfoy, to ease his anger and his hurt ego or pride.
He put a lot of emphasis on the word ball, but Harry just shrugged reaching for his hands again, “This but in front of everyone.”
Harry paused, confused, before smiling tenderly at Hermione, “Of course! I mean… thanks for asking for permission, unlike some other people-”
He heard Malfoy intake breath as so to speak, but he interrupted him, “Mrs. Figg was- is a great woman though. I loved sneaking off to her house when the Dursley’s left. She would always have snacks waiting for me, or would bake them on the spot when she saw me. The Dursley’s didn’t like that though, so they tried to limit the time I ever got to spend with her.”
It took a few seconds for it to sink in before Draco began to look horrified, “So much for secrets.”

From inside a large lump of fabric fell heavy on his bed. This was either a very hard and heavy pillow or something wrapped in a soft material for its protection. Pulling at the material Harry found that it was neither. A soft, black afghan was wrapped around an array of products and a crumpled note. Along with a book talking about sleep disorders and muggle and wizard remedies, there was also some Valerian root and some lavender. In Harry’s uneducated mind, none of these things had any correlation except the blanket and the book.
Draco shook his head, “That’s the easily digestible and very neatly cleaned up version of it. A lot of the history was removed. This castle belonged to the prestigious house of Ravenclaw before she agreed to turn it into a school with her three good friends.” Harry looked up at the statue of a little girl with a basket of flowers, long flowing hair and a circlet of sort on her head, Draco motioned to her, “Helena Ravenclaw. The only heiress to the Ravenclaw name and the castle. Each statue of a young girl in this castle is of every Ravenclaw woman that came before her. It was a rite of passage.”
Harry sat between Ron and Hermione, a new constant in his life, watching attentively the Gryffindor table making bets on who would be chosen for the tournament.
And yes. The Malfoy thing is going to get worse before it gets better.
He focused on the sound of Malfoy breathing for a few minutes, “What were you thinking about?”
Harry stood at King Cross station, watching as parents filed in to pick up their children.
Harry has two left feet and is nearly impossible to teach him how to dance. The Slytherins took that as a chance to goad about their natural ability to dance and obnoxious stuff like that, while making fun of the boy who lived for ‘being inferior’. To the discredit of a few cruel ones, he heard a few whispers about his mother being the reason for it, ‘tarnishing his pureblood genes with her mudblood ones’. As though dancing skills are something you carry in your blood, those fucking pricks.
“Well I’m not going to deny you that. You get ahead only on blind luck.” His defenses weren’t entirely down, but he was calm and casual.
“Teaching students that weren’t of prestigious families?”
“You do. Otherwise you wouldn’t have hidden it.”
He smiled and shrugged, “Call it intuition if you want.”
Draco rolled his eyes, “What a boring date you’ll be. What exactly did you have planned for the ‘ball’?”
And here's the thing, even I didn't know what would happen because it was supposed to be left to interpretation. You choose the ending.
“Ron-”
Harry sighed and contemplated letting him keep sleeping, enjoy this moment, unsure if he’ll ever get it again, still not entirely sure those dreams are visions or what. He squeezed his hand. It didn’t wake him, only alerted him to the uncomfortable position he was in, and Harry internally groaned as Draco just slid sideways, his head landing on Harry’s shoulder. Draco shuffled a bit, unconsciously getting more comfortable in the position, before letting out a tiny sigh and settling back to his deep sleep.
Ron glanced at him, looking baffled, then sharing the look with Hermione who seemed to have picked up on the Gryffindors interest but couldn’t correlate how Harry’s suggestion was a solution. She shrugged, “It’s your loss.”
Neville nodded, dropping a parcel on Harry’s lap, “Someone left that for you outside of the tower. The Fat Lady refused to say whom it was from. Just started giggling.”
And Harry was going to reply, but then he noticed a yellow tinge on Draco’s left cheek. And out of nowhere, Harry’s need to tell Draco the truth became insignificant.
Draco didn’t say anything.
The duo had a stare off, trying to see who would break first, that being Harry when he sighed in defeat and shaking his head, “The question has been bothering me since I saw him that night. He looked at me like I was the last thing he wanted to see…”
Harry took in her pause and her worried look, “You knew.”
“Approval. Respect. Recognition. Love.”
Draco sighed, “Stop.”
Silence. Again.
He let go in a rush and glared at his own hands in shame, wondering if there were fates that one simply could not run away from. “I’m sorry.”
“During second year everyone believed me to be a better, if not the only contender to be the Heir of Slytherin. They had no idea and they still managed to nail some facts in the head.” Harry looked away ashamed, “I had to beg the hat to not sort me into Slytherin.”
To say Harry was confused would be an understatement.
Draco’s expression read that he got it, but he didn’t want to hear it.
“I said midnight.”
“Left-who?”
A few hands raised shyly, and some people straight up pretended he wasn’t there.
Harry nodded, and then another bout of silence, “What do the Slytherins plan with recruiting the Huffies and the Claws?”
“Hey!” Hermione stopped Harry, looking excited for a moment, like she found an answer to any of the many problems on their plate, “You want a distraction?”
Malfoy took a few deep breaths before he finally replied, “He didn’t teach it to me. But I know I learned it from him… My mother would never use any of those curses. I just don’t know how I know.”
Harry nodded, “Friend or foe?”
“Lucius would rather he’d play none. Lucius would rather his son be dead than having him conspiring with us. I think Lucius is still a death eater. He’s still helping Voldermort, regardless if he’s alive or not.” Harry knows he is, but how is he gonna explain that to Ron, “If Lucius finds out Draco’s on my wrist as well, and that he’s not my… enemy... “
Draco shook his head, and tried to continue back into their dorm with his crew when Harry pulled again. Draco turned around, looking ready to punch someone but not finding anything. Parkinson sighed, “Honey, you’re stressed, you’re probably imagining things.”
“WHY DO YOU THINK YOU’RE A TOPIC IN MY HOUSEHOLD?”
“What’s wrong with that?”
Draco sighed and turned back to staring at the sky. If he was still figuring out his plan, he was doing it in his head.
“Who. Hit. You?”
“Doing it with your cousin?”
“I get it.”
“Why? Everything about Draco was challenging Harry. His tone, his face, his body.
The section of the Slytherin table with Durmstrang in it burst out in celebration, and many students from Beauxbaton and Hogwarts joined in the cheers as their favorite quidditch player joined the frayed.
“Why?”
Someone sighed.
Hermione nodded, leaving the room and leaving the door open behind her as Dean, Seamus and Neville walked in, still not used to Hermione coming into their room without any regards for privacy, now even disturbed with the idea of it considering they’ve all hit puberty.
Malfoy sighed, the frown on his face and his nod of acceptance making it known to Harry that he believed him. And an inch of the weight fell off.
“What can I do to make you trust me?”
Any questions, feel free to ask.
“I don’t care.”
“Where were you?”
“Not yet.”
Ignorance is bliss. And he was dearly missing it.
They stared at each other for a few seconds, both daring the other to break from their statement, Ron losing this one, “Alright, Harry told me to shut me up. But it still counts!”
The foreign students were confused to him being there, while Diggory gave him a pitied look, already getting the gist of the shit show that was Harry’s life.
He stared at both his best friend, Ronald, and his newfound enemy, Malfoy, bite at each other, subtly looking at his left wrist, at the fancy name written in fancy calligraphy, and then looking at the blond git in front of him.
Harry sighed, looking around for the nearest desk and settling on top of it, “Can I ask a question?”
It was hours later when Hermione came to check on him, and he wished he had remained ignorant and that she had taken Ron’s approach.
He didn’t know where he was going or what he was doing. He simply strolled through the castle, ignoring the stares of those who know about DADA class, and smiling and nodding to those who didn’t. It was getting cold, but nonetheless he ended up outside, on a small garden sitting area that was probably older than the concept of the school. He wondered for a second who did this castle belong to before it became a school. Was it the founders? Some other family? Who was the one who requested this garden? Or the many more scattered around the school’s territory…
To be honest, Harry had not planned this far away. He did not think Draco would allow him the question, so he never planned one. “...” Draco smiled, like he had expected Harry to blank out and be stupid, like he knew Harry had no question.
Harry watched Draco switch to his other wrist, looking at his fine penmanship scrawled on Harry’s skin and a subtle smile surfaced on his lips. Soul markings; one hell of a blessing.
Malfoy wasn’t walking. Not at first. He was just still by the stairs near the slytherin house. But the closer Harry got to him, the more anxious he seemed to get as he began to shuffle around and pace in circles. Until eventually, a floor above where Malfoy was, he heard him call out, “What are you doing out of bed?”
The parcel was fat and heavy on Harry’s lap, and simply said Harry P. in bold capital letters. Harry looked at Neville, “Did you think for a second that maybe someone might be trying to hurt me and thus they sent a parcel with something that could kill me?”
He had a feeling Hermione was going to spend the rest of the year being worried if his on-growing obsession with Malfoy was any indicator.
“Until I was nine the lie almost held up. But I just kept finding more and more articles in the Prophet with your name on it and I became obsessed, and I knew your name was basically forbidden in the manor, so I hid it. And then while in the middle of an argument, as he was grounding me for speaking out of turn and making him look bad in front of his friends, he searched my closet for something to hurt me with.” Draco shrugged with the same nonchalant airiness Harry has regarding the abuse he dealt with at the Dursleys, “ Could be a belt, could be something I held precious that he would then destroy… He found the box full of the ripped articles. Mom had no idea what lie to formulate to save me from that. He saw it as me deciding what roles they were supposed to play. That was the first time he hit me with his own hand.”
The air was tense, and no one knew what to do. Not Hermione who breathed heavily besides Harry, not Harry who wondered how much back would this put him, not Ron who really didn’t want to fight and didn’t want to push forward, nor Draco who was confused as hell, and much less the crowd of people who expected a fight and only got two teenagers glaring at each other.
Harry shook his head. Draco sighed, “Rowena Ravenclaw who was a Ravenclaw by marriage, had Edmund and Helena Ravenclaw, the latter who is currently the ghost of Ravenclaw-”
Harry tried to smile, but just grimaced in amusement, “I thought the same.”
“You’re father thought you that?”
“It’s not your fault. You now know what’s going on and what’s making you so short-tempered. And I’m sure by now Lefty has heard about it. Try again. If he hasn’t heard about it, tell hi- FUCK, LEFTY!”
“Were there no rumours going around regarding Vol-” Harry stopped at Draco’s glare and nodded, “Regarding You-know-who’s search for my family as he hunted me down?”
“You-know-who died. My father forbade me from leaving the manor until I was disciplined enough to not pull on my sleeves and show people I wore the name of You-know-who’s ‘killer’ on my wrist. It meant different things depending on who saw it. Some of ‘Daddy’s’ friends would see it as treason. Like he sees it. Some of his friends would see it as what my mother kept trying to convince my father it was.”
Surprisingly, yes.
Silence.
“Generally?” Ron and Hermione nodded, “Like vomiting my soul out.”
Until Harry dared to try and reach for Draco’s bruise, only to have Draco flinch away, “What the fuck are you trying to do?”
He saw Hermione quietly but joyfully join her parents who proudly and quietly stood by her side as she began to goad about all of her achievements this year.
“Can I show my wrist?” Harry didn’t understand why he had to ask permission to do that, but…
Enjoy-.... Good Luck!
Ron seemed to be staring at Draco, “It’s strange. Or at least it was.”
“It’s better this way.” Hermione murmured, not looking up from her book.
“Cheat.”
A few hours later, two hours till supper, Harry found Draco in that old garden with the flower girl. He was staring at her.
As Ron helped Harry settle on his bed, he told him about how McGonnagal and Dumbledore visited on the second night, believing Ron to have left already. McGonnagal was mad at Dumbledore, blaming him for Harry’s stress and demanding that he finds a way to get him out of the tournament. Dumbledore never replied.
“Why. Do. You. Care!?” Draco had no intention of answering the question.
doing out of bed?”
He sighed aggressively, motioning to his surrounding, “Because of life.”
“I’m still getting used to the idea of Lefty being… Lefty. And even if I had become used to it… Harry, you know well I’m the last person who’s ever going to understand what’s going on inside… Lefty’s head. But I’ll be here for you for anything else.”
“Can I ask for something in return?”
Hermione scoffed, “Who says Malfoy even knows for sure what Harry is to him, and that is if Harry’s even on any of his wrist.” Hermione turned to Harry, looking at the Tom Riddle signature, “Didn’t you believe Tom Riddle was your soulmate before we found out Tom Riddle was you-know-who?”
Harry smiled, “Yes. Morning sleeping beauty.”
The smile that broke through Ginny’s face was enough to make him feel like everything could be right for once. The pride of having so easily solve one issue filled Harry with an undignified amount of confidence. That was probably why it hit him like a pile of bricks when he saw Lucius Malfoy walking away from the Headmaster’s office with a terribly collected and quiet Draco.
“Death-eaters! They attacked the campsite and took the muggle caretakers hostages. The ministry is trying to deal with them.” Neville tried pulling Harry with him, but Harry remained frozen.
“Trio.” Hermione corrected.
McClaggan stood up, seeming like he was looking for a fight, “What? Scheming other ways to cheat your way into this tournament?”
And the ice filled his veins as he turned back to Dumbledore and finally understood what was going on. What a fool was he to think he could just one year. Ron pulled up, “Go.”
Hermione shrugged, “Ron noticed you left but didn’t come back, and when I woke up at five he told me about it so I made a few guesses at what might have happened. I then asked Ron to get the marauders map, confirmed my suspicion, and came down here to make sure things were going good. Then we saw you were just sitting there taking a nap and figured it would be bad for the both of you if people saw, we don’t want that drama yet, so we sat here, stopping people from coming by. There’s not much we could’ve done about slytherins coming out, so thank heavens none appear to be morning people.”
“Are you okay, Harry?”
“They don’t get along.”
Harry and Malfoy stared at each other for a few minutes before Harry gave up, assuming that to be the end of the conversation, and going back to his hunt for caffeine. He liked Malfoy, but with zero hours of sleep all Harry wanted to do were bad decisions. A few of them involved a bit of sexual assault on the blond from Harry, others involved Harry’s fist on Malfoy’s cheek. And Harry was too tired to try and understand those mixed feelings.
I'm writing this for free! I'm not asking for your money, I'm taking time out of my schedule to entertain you. All I ask is that you comment and let me know that my work is not being eaten by the void. I don't even mind if all the 10 comments are by the same person, I will be fucking excited to write a chapter for that one excited reader.
The trio stood frozen, watching everyone run past them far away from danger. They couldn’t see what caused it, they couldn’t see where it started.
“Awake because you want to be, or because you can’t sleep?”
A small chuckle escaped Draco, as though that was the last thing he ever expected to leave Harry’s lips, “Your scar?”
Harry paused as Draco explained, “Sirius Black is our cousin. Mine, my mothers, my aunt.”
“I’m not hungry.”
“I was confused, in a new place, and scared. I had no idea where I stood or what was going on. I trusted people blindly. I’m not saying I’m against Ron now, but I can see where he was wrong, just like how I can see where you went wrong as well, to help me create that image of you being dangerous. But then I learned.”
“I’m sorry ‘Mione, I don’t get what I’m supposed to get from that, other than Lucius is an arse. Even to his own kid.” Ron murmured, forgetting their code altogether.
Harry looked around, physically looking around for his will to now ruin the moment and wake the boy. He almost wanted to cry, this was so unfair. Harry softly bumped his head to Draco’s, trying to nudge him awake, and the boy only unconsciously nudged him back, a small ‘hmm’ leaving his lips. Harry nearly cried. Harry tried to move but the boy only whined and Harry really just wanted to scream at everyone to go back to sleep. Sadly, he couldn’t.
“Why did you kidnap me from my friends?”
Everyone turned to look at elder Malfoy as he blatantly tried to pretend the Weasleys weren’t there as he moved to the other corner of the box with a surprisingly timid and quiet Draco Malfoy following behind him.
“Actually,” Draco looked down, looking ashamed of himself, “I’d prefer if you did find someone else to… jaunt into the ball with.”
Draco lifted his head and looked at Harry, his eyes glossy, not really awake, “Hmm?”
Hermione huffed and began going up to the boy’s dorm, “We’ve had a nasty luck for the past three years, and then the Quidditch Cup incident happened, and the Ministry resurrected an old death game and…” She sighed turning back to Harry, looking at him with pity and regret in her eyes, “You. Have. Rotten. Luck…” she bit her lip looking down, “I simply had a feeling. So just in case, I wanted to make sure you had an alibi.”
He did get a little bit better, enough for the bags under his eyes to lessen. But the first challenge was a few days away and from Hagrid’s little helpful nudge, he had discovered it was dragons. And no matter what anyone told him, nothing could prepare him for dragons.
Draco turned towards them confused, then glancing at Harry for a hint of an answer only to find an uncomfortable itch on the corner of Harry’s lips before turning back to Ron who for the first time ever seemed uncomfortable and scared to pick a fight with Draco. There was simply no reason for it in Ron’s mind, so he had to poke the hornet's nest, “Word on the streets’ that your father was involved in the attack at the world cup. Should we be expecting you to join them as well?”
Harry nodded, “You know he is one, you know you are safer away from him.”
“And finally, what’s the last Unforgivable Curse?” Harry felt a chill in his spine at his ‘finally’, but couldn’t understand why. He figured Tom ‘guy who I thought was my soulmate but is my mortal enemy’ Riddle traumatized him enough and created trust issues with people who promise to be trust-worthy. And he sounded too happy to be here.
“Dean mentioned seeing Lucius leave the school after supper. Figured this would be what you were doing.” He shrugged, “And after I noticed midnight had passed and you’ve yet to come back or move from this spot, I figured you had fallen asleep again and would need a watchdog.”
“Why were you smiling at Malfoy?” Hermione whispered, not even looking up from her cauldron.
A small chuckle escaped Draco, and Harry felt like he’d won the House Cup and nothing else mattered.
paying attention.”
Nonetheless Harry nodded. He extended his hand, scared of a rejection of his own making, before he heard Draco sigh, “Don’t… squeeze too hard. I still feel it pulsating.” Harry smiled as Draco placed his hand on Harry’s. Then his smile dropped as he remembered why Draco asked him to come up here in the first place.
“The champions are expected to parade into the ball and initiate the first dance-”
“It was Ron,” Harry muttered.
Draco had definitely not expected that, “What?”
Ginny shrugged, like it didn’t bother her that she was the only Weasley who couldn’t go to the ball, “And?”
“He’s known all along that they weren’t gonna get along so Lucius never bothered. Plus the fact that you-” Ron turned to look at Harry who was glaring at the mirror, water running over his hands, “It’s not a matter of trying to change destiny and maybe fix his relationship with his son, it’s a matter of destroying you. Destroying what you want. Lucius doesn’t know if Draco’s on your wrist but he knows he will have an impact on your life. So regardless of what role Draco plays-”
“Lefty has your name.”
“All’s well that ends well.”
The day passed with little to no problems. It was sometime after supper when Harry managed to drag Ginny away from a group a giggling tweens into an empty classroom. The words on the board look like glyphs, so Harry guessed it was an active classroom. One of those classes he refuses to even bother taking. He can’t bullshit himself out of homework in those classes. After calming down a slightly panicked and embarrassed Ginny who swore him into secrecy regarding her worrying that her older brother might have been in trouble, Harry allowed Ginny to become the fourth person he’s ever shown his wrist to. And just like her older brother, she laughed.
“I don’t mean be my date, I mean, take my place as champion and do the stupid dance for me. I. Don’t. Dance.” Harry’s eyes had a clear desperation behind it.
He got the whole arm thing down. He could twirl the both of them. He could dip, twirl and shuffle, but moving from the spot he’d begun in? Nope. Not a chance. He either took too big of a step, or too small, or not the right direction, or speed, or he lacked synchronization.
Harry smiled as he walked up next to Draco and stared at the girl.
Hermione pulled them both away, continuing on their way to Herbology.
But it was affecting Zabini, and Parkison seemed annoyed by it. Malfoy, on the other hand, thought it was funny, as he helped his friend as well.
“What’s so funny?”
Draco nodded, “Same.”
“What’s that?”
He took another step, “What do you mean-”
She choked mid laughter and stared at him confused and insulted, “What?”
Draco gave a ghost of a smile, pulling his hands free and grasping for Voldemort’s name. His nails scratched the shape of each letter, and Harry felt for a second the same anger in Draco as he felt in himself about the unfairness of this situation, of who they were destined to fight. It wasn’t like with the average person where their enemy was just some guy who would attempt to make their life miserable or was simply the most incompatible person for them. No.
Harry silently grumbled, wanting to make a bet, but realizing Ron did not gambled blindly and Hermione was simply not stupid. He knew none of the names his classmates kept calling out for. He sighed.
“Morning.”
Draco’s breathing calmed down, but his defense remained like steel. “Of course.”
They were nearly done with supper when Hermione passed him a note, her head gesturing towards Draco before going to her meal and pretending it didn’t happen. The note was nothing at all what Harry expected,
Molly shook her head, arm looped with him as she led him forward, “I still remember when Lucius Malfoy, only a year after graduating Hogwarts, came to make himself known in the Ministry. Flaunting his money everywhere and using it to make his desires law. Arthur entered the ministry on an internship with hopes of creating a change in the world by sharing his ideas and then helping in leading the ministry away from You-know-who’s suffocating grasp. And in a matter of days Malfoy came in and crumbled it all to the ground with some well placed coins.
Nonetheless I hope you enjoy this chapter.
“He shouldn’t have to do anything, Harry. I understand well enough why Draco behaves like he does. And so should Arthur. We’ve seen how Lucius is and how he treats his son. Draco doesn’t have to explain anything.”
Harry grimaced, looking away to Ron who was glaring at him, “Never make me do that again. I’ll fight for you, but only when it’s necessary.” Harry nodded. But honestly, he’d much rather both boys be angry at him than the possibility of Lucius appearing at school and bruising Draco’s face once again.
“I wasn’t wearing my wrap.”
Arthur turned to Ron, “Who’s embarrassed?” He asked before turning to look at the Malfoys.
The tone of the class died down, and it died hard. The remains were burned and the ashes were burned again. Not one said a word, no sound. Just the sound of a spider squirming and silently begging for it’s life. Ron may hate spiders but even he looked terribly uncomfortable.
Harry looked at Ron, “Any bets? I’ll make it for us.”
It was quiet.
Harry shrugged, “It was the most liberating thing I did. When I stopped caring about the Dursleys… there was nothing to hurt for if there was nothing to care for. When they stopped meaning anything to me, nothing they said could hurt me, they could never disappoint me, and I could never disappoint them.”
“No.”
Ron shrugged, ignoring Harry’s seething glare and turning back to pretend what Binns was saying was interesting, “He’s your…” Sigh, “Soulmate. At least we hope that, so have faith that at the end of the story, he’ll be by your side.”
Harry nodded, not being able to speak through the knot in his throat at hearing someone else voice out loud something he feared only he felt. Draco has been a victim of circumstance and his only crime is being born in the wrong family.
“No, I just want people to back off of you.”
He sighed, “I’m going to do the thing you don’t want me to do.”
Harry felt the air get colder, and immediately knew this story didn’t end good. Well… to be fair Romeo and Juliet doesn’t end good either, but…
Harry smiled, nodding and then sat besides Draco, “Yes and Yes? No and No? Yes and No?”
Harry sat down next to the boy, looping his right arm with Draco’s left and pulling him in to lay his head on his shoulder. He looked away at seeing Draco looking like he was pulling at every ounce of strength inside of him to prevent himself from sobbing. He never outright did. All Harry ever heard was Draco choking back his sobs while silently crying besides him.
1. I printed out the 40+ pages of this story to hand edit. I'm not done. I had to help someone move out of their house and got distracted.
