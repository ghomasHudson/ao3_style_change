Draco crawled on top of Harry and kissed just under his ear.
Pansy saw this and decided to contribute to the conversation. She very visibly looked Harry up and down. “I thought about it a few times. Figured sleeping with the enemy counted as fraternizing.”
“Alright.”
“I’ll bet you responded most positively to the complement, then that he loves you, and less when he said he appreciates you?”
He closed his eyes and his chest ached. But he pushed it all aside.
They understood completely and Hermione even went out and bought a few little hats for Teddy as a Christmas present.
“You were and you still are.”
“Maybe, maybe not. I haven’t decided yet.”
“Perhaps to someone without a refined sense of humor.”
“So let me.”
Shivers and a teasing pleasure invaded his system. It was all he knew. Though he tried to look relaxed, he wasn't. Not really. The whispers of pleasure drifted down his body and dance between his legs. He was getting just a bit turned on and he was very aware of this, but he didn't want to move. It was just relaxing enough for him to be willing to endure it. But that compliance didn't last for long. A stirring alerted him to the issue and he retreated from Draco's reach. "That's enough, I think." He tried to casually rest his arm on his lap to hide his problem.
He was met with a moment of silence before Draco spoke up again. “I take it you’ve made your decision, then.”
Draco was taken aback by the conflict and defeat in Harry's eyes. He removed his hand, but leaned in just a bit closer. "Are you alright?"
"I quite like using my mouth." Harry wiped his damp lower-lip with his thumb and gave a wink.
“Yes?” He asked in a somewhat teasing tone.
“Does he really fancy me?”
“Quills work. If it isn’t broken, why fix it?”
“Don’t worry about it, you have months to figure something out.” Harry assured.
“I’ve got it. I think I just used too much icing.”
“I swear I’m gonna hex you.” He sighed out the words.
“A grave! The boy's meant to be dead, Draco, you know this. He refused to lay down and die. The world could've been so much better if everything had gone according to plan, if some kid hadn't gotten loud and rebellious, if my family weren't so deceitful! So yes, I've ruined your lives. I took everything you had ever hoped for, and I derailed it. But only because you did it to me first.”
He agreed, “That’s probably best. I suppose we’ll tell him tomorrow. He and Hannah will be together by the weekend.”
Harry kept it on top of his trunk. He was so happy.
It was actually quite a dark and troubling set of arguments that Harry put up, but in the end, it was enough to make everyone see that Draco had never really been a bad guy. At least, not of his own will. The charges were dropped and Draco was set free. Draco was under the blissful impression that he and his mother might be the last of the Malfoy line. That they would rebuild their name, that Draco would have an heir, and they would start anew.
Harry sent it off to his friend and somehow they felt better now that it was gone. It was out of their hands. That made it easier in a way that neither of them quite understood. Though they felt better, the house became uncharacteristically silent and still. It was as if they just didn’t know what to do with themselves. They both had things in mind that they could do, but neither really wanted to move. They were stuck at the table, soaking in what they had just done. The relief turned to terror. Everyone would know. It was no longer their little secret in their private little bubble. It could change things and they didn’t want their lives to change again. It changed once and they handled it beautifully. They didn’t know if they’d get so lucky again.
He knew that Harry had to be connected to Crow, since he was able to get Pansy such a good position in her project. But now, this made Hermione connected to her as well. And he knew that Harry and Pawk were connected too, which made him wonder about what all Harry was getting up to.
Harry was intoxicated by bliss, but Draco was utterly shattered by it. He was held captive by the noises Harry made. His tongue groveling for more. He was broken and the splendor of Harry’s pleasure was his only remedy.
Draco spoke with him about students and classes while everyone watched in a mix of amazement and fear. They couldn’t believe someone would hurt Harry like that. Students mumbling about their disgust were heard around James, who had never seen his father so afraid before. Everyone was furious that someone would do this to such a kind professor, and war hero.
It’s easy to trust people with little things. Harry would trust a cook to make his food, he would trust a thief to rob him, he would trust his friends to help him, and he would trust Teddy to make him smile.
Seamus is cheery and kind, but sudden bright lights make him flinch and think it’s a curse coming at him. He’ll never forget all the times he was almost hit. All the times he almost died.
“Don't do what?”
“Especially when this particular person is suppose to be sentencing a man who committed violent crimes.”
September came and Ron entered a training program to become an Auror, Hermione took up an internship at the Ministry, Ginny went back to Hogwarts, and everyone else returned to their lives before the war. Everyone except Harry. Harry realized he was the only one whose life centered almost completely around the war. He was born to die in it, and without that, he wasn't sure what he was meant to do with himself. So he stuck around a while longer. Although he was halfway moved in to his own house, he stayed for Molly. Sometimes, she just couldn’t cook or clean, and without saying a word, Harry would silently get it done for her. He was used to doing so much more, and he felt like he owed her for all the kindness the Weasleys had shown him. Though it sometimes took them by surprise, no one said a word when Harry was the one serving dinner, or when they walked in to see him cleaning. Just silent nods and an unspoken gratitude. Harry preferred it that way.
Draco nodded. “That’s okay. But if you ever let me, know that I’ll take my time and I’ll make it as sweet as possible for you.”
“A more intense healing spell.”
Typically, the elite of the wizarding world held a slew of balls, gatherings, and dinner parties around the holiday season. But given the circumstances, he doubted there would be very many or that he would be invited to any. Part of him was upset as he did enjoy the good food and dancing, but he was also thankful he wouldn’t have to deal with the judgment and stuffiness.
Draco felt himself starting to tear up at the realization he came to, but held back. “No. You’re marrying me off to Potter?!” In his shocked hysteria he was overcome by a genuine laugh. “You’re insane if you believe that he would ever agree to this! The moment he finds out, he'll take it up in Wizengamot and have the law changed!” His own teary laughter made him feel like he was losing his mind.
Harry gave a giddy chuckle, flashing his Golden Boy smile, and then winking. "I know."
“Not yet. I want to. He’s not even one yet. I’d really love to see him.”
Draco raised his eyebrows at the sight and couldn’t help but to grin. “Expect to get undressed today?”
The contact came as a bit of a shock to Harry, as did the look Draco gave him, but some reason, he liked it. He really liked it. He liked it more than he wanted to. Although Harry had been a bit oblivious in the past, it was easy to not notice his surroundings when he was constantly wondering when the next slight on his life would take place. But now, he was aware. He was so painfully aware. He knew exactly what Draco was doing and he knew it was being done on purpose.
“Merlin, go to bed.” Harry whined as he went into his room, but Draco stood in the doorframe before Harry could shut it. He tilted his head and waited for Draco to speak.
Draco blinked a few times and nodded, still a bit shocked. “Sorry, I just didn’t realize you actually died.” He was told that Harry was only unconscious, or perhaps was only pretending to be. He had no idea that Harry was actually dead for a brief period of time.
He shook and cried while Harry let out a low and loud moan that was more akin to a howl. Draco was trapped in an intense physical bliss while Harry was overwhelmed by a deep relaxation.
He took his time and went back to teaching on Monday. He started his classes off by saying the prank had been pulled by a student, who shall remain unnamed, who hadn’t known the true extent of Harry’s trauma, and didn’t know it would scare him like that. He said that he and the student had a talk and all was forgiven. He asked that everyone respect his decision and let it go. The students did as he asked.
He sauntered up to her with a smirk. “Hello Abbott. Rumor has it you’ve fallen for Longbottom.” He figured if he claimed there was a rumor then she would either confirm or deny it.
Draco scooted closer to Harry and wrapped his arm around him. They usually weren’t this physical in front of other people, but Draco didn’t care. He just wanted to comfort Harry. Harry cracked a small smile and he laid his head on Draco’s shoulder. He had never been held like this before. But he really liked it.
Naturally, Harry agreed.
"Wright, Alex Wright."
Draco cringed as Harry didn’t get what he was implying. “Yes, but I also have to examine you on the outside.”
Harry looked up as if he had just been caught doing something naughty. He swallowed and nodded. “Yea, I’m fine.”
“Why?”
fancy
Every year he would get a slew of questions in the beginning by students who went ahead and binged the chapter on Harry and the war. He would also receive questions throughout the start of the spring term, when it was actually time for the first years to study the chapter. He didn’t mind answering them, and as repeated questions arose, he made suggestions for an updated version of the textbook.
“You seemed unhappy.”
“Alright then.”
“You look like an angel.” Harry said softly.
He moaned out for Draco. Loud and guttural. His moans bounced off the walls and filled the room. He could hardly get any words out besides Draco’s name. He was panting and every exhale was a new noise. Sometimes moans, sometimes whimpers, and other times he chanted the blonde’s name.
When they had almost finished, Draco spoke up again. “How about we go grocery shopping? Maybe we could cook dinner together, or something. We could go out and eat if you’d prefer?”
Draco wished he could kiss the pain away.
Harry’s whole body quivered when he was fully inside his lover. His back was arched and he shifted his hips a bit. Without the leverage of his feet on the bed, Harry couldn’t move his hips much. He definitely couldn’t thrust, but he could roll his hips just enough to give them both a nice buzz. He held used the pads of his thumbs to caress the front of the other’s hips.
Draco came rushing into his dorm to tell Harry the good news.
The two books mentioned in this chapter are real, check the end notes for links!
“You were never that bad anyways. I almost killed y-“
Harry thought a moment, but he soon became a bit determined, “Ballocks, I’ll stay with you over break and we’ll spend Christmas with Teddy.”
“Alright then, let’s go.”
He rolled his hips, letting the feeling wash over his body for a few more seconds. There was a warm wetness on his hand and he groped for his wand to cast a cleaning charm. A shiver ran through him as the magic swept over such a sensitive area.
They talked about couple stuff and then Ron shifted the conversation to ask if Dean still fancied Seamus.
She nodded, “That would be best.”
Draco stood and headed into the kitchen, pouring two glasses of wine and pulling some of Harry's chocolate out of the fridge. He went back to the sofa and set everything down on the coffee table. He cast a quick charm to light the fire while he waited for Harry to return. When he did, he did so in his pajamas, completely done with the day.
Hermione seemed to be in between everyone. She thought magic should be a last resort. Her reasoning was that the relationship should start off naturally, and that using magic to make it happen wouldn’t be as genuine as two friends confessing their love for one another. She mostly agreed with Luna and added on the idea of trying to set give Dean and Seamus little pushes a long the way.
Draco looked Harry up and down and gave an estimate, “You’re a hundred sixty centimeters tops.”
“I did it! I read the entirety of the restricted section, and I did it before break ended, just like I said I would!” Harry celebrated as he put down his last book. But rather than relaxing, he was ready to complete his next task. “I should finish making my lesson plans.”
Christmas morning came and Harry woke with a grin. He hardly slept that night because he was so excited. He was running purely on adrenaline that morning.
He smirked at the blonde. “But you love it.”
“Wasn’t me either.” Harry felt a grin spread on his face. “Must of gotten enchanted.”
- - - - -
Dean crossed his arms and rolled his eyes. “At least I didn’t get too excited and spontaneously combust.” He mumbled.
"Fine."
“Are you alright?!” Harry asked, very concerned as Draco suddenly looked exhausted and disassociated.
“I could make it even warmer.” Draco reached up to grip the lily on his necklace, making Harry’s warm up and send a lovely feeling through his body. He felt loved. For the first time in a long time, he felt so unconditionally loved and he basked in it. It was enough to make his cheeks turn red and he looked away. “Cheeky bastard.”
"If you say so."
“I hope it’s still just as beautiful a decade from now.”
to make a withdrawal to afford the present, but he figured he might as well since he planned on spending a lot on Draco.
Harry woke up the next morning with a soft moan. There was a hand in his hair, petting him and gently scratching his scalp. His back arched softly and one of his hands drifted up to trap the hand in his hair, preventing it from leaving it’s place.
Teddy didn’t know who Harry was. All he knew was that there was a brand-new person at his home, and this new person is playing with him. So he figured Harry couldn’t be half bad. He decided he liked Harry, but if Harry tried to keep his glasses away for much longer, that opinion might change. He wasn’t sure yet. He wasn’t sure about a lot of things. But he knew that he loved that woman that holds and sings to him. That’s about all he was sure of. He also doesn’t like peas, he knows that for certain.
She nodded, “Good, then. That’s good.” She brought him into the dining hall for tea. “Well, how has it been?”
Harry only shook his head. "This is a debt I want to spend the rest of my life repaying."
life now, Harry. Live."
“Can you believe it? This is the first time my name has been in the press without your involvement, I did it all by myself, and it's about
Hermione dismissed him. She said he was only looking to have his name on a piece of history and Harry knew this to be true. He wanted to be known but wasn't willing to actually work to do anything worthwhile. It made the man reek of desperation and Harry knew the scent from the first day of Wizengamot, which was precisely why they weren't friends. Even without political experience under his belt, he knew to steer clear of a leech like Garren.
The blonde sighed, "Well, living with Potter can't be the worst thing."
"I had no idea."
It was then that Draco decided he could get used to hearing the word. As a matter of fact, he wouldn't mind hearing Harry call him that. A small smile graced his face as they began to eat. The silence was much more comfortable than before. The entire moment changed something inside of Draco. He was shot with an extra dose of confidence. These last few weeks together, and the very spontaneous trip, it made everything feel so different now. He knew exactly what had changed. Draco knew he'd fallen, but a week ago, he made the choice to fall. Rather, he didn't fall at all. He walked down this path, choosing every step. Draco's mind chose Harry, and now, his heart has too.
They sat in agreement and found that they were perfectly situated in their lives. Both Harry's time in Wizengamot and Draco's book were almost finished. Chapters of their lives were about to come to a close and they were to end just as they began, with Harry and Draco together. Then, another chapter would begin between them. Though Draco wasn't sure about how he wanted to write ending to his book, he was certain that he wanted every chapter of his own to start and end with Harry by his side. He was also pretty confident that if he and Harry were still together by the end of the final chapter, it will have made a great story. And though Harry wasn't writing a book that he could mentally compare the chapters of his life to, he thought the same thing.
“Are you seriously threatening to injure yourself just to get me out of bed?”
Harry wrote a letter of recommendation to Crow, saying she shouldn't do the reform alone since a partner would make it look more trustworthy, and two strong Slytherin women working for a good cause would reflect well on the wrongfully criticized house. He also recommended Greenwood to sponsor the reform, but that was only to further Greenwood's debt just in case.
Harry and his friends were starting to spend almost all their free time on the couches. Studying, reading, talking, doing projects, writing papers, and working on homework. They enjoyed the time they got to spend together because they were finally realizing it wasn’t going to last forever.
“Here you are.” She said with a warm smile, handing him the flowers. “I’ve got to say, of all the arraignments I’ve done, I’m most proud of this one.” She was an artist and flowers were her medium.
Both women moved to protest, but Harry cut in. “‘S fine.” He mumbled as he stood up. “Just, send word if anything changes.” He stepped towards Draco and kissed his forehead. “Please wake up.” The words came as a whisper when he meant to speak them in a stronger voice. He turned back to the Auror and gave a somewhat awkward expression. “Don’t you need to cuff me, or something?”
They were completely infatuated with each other.
Really he couldn't have been more wrong. Harry was delighted by the feeling of warmth spreading through his chest. It let him know that Draco was thinking of him, and at a moment like this, he needed it.
After only one weekend he made it halfway through the F’s.
“I don’t know how and I’d rather not. I’m good at being stressed, no, wait. I mean I’m used to stress, stress is familiar. I don’t like the vulnerability of pleasure.” He tried to work his feelings in the simplest form possible so that Draco would understand his issue.
Harry paused and seemed to think a moment. “It isn’t that I don’t want to. I do. I really do. I suppose I’m just scared. I trust you, but I can’t help being scared.”
He looked Draco in his eyes. “Do it, seriously.”
“‘Mione told me.”
That night, Draco had quite a few questions.
He also received a collection of stories that he hadn’t expected in a million years. Accounts of Draco Malfoy, helping people.
“Taking a page from my book, I see. Mockery really is the sincerest form of flattery.”
Harry was momentarily taken aback. He blinked a few times before asking, “Resolve the sexual tension?” He couldn’t help but to chuckle. “What exactly does that mean?” He could feel the way his cheeks heated up.
He brought Teddy in and answered every single question the boy had for him. In the end, he said, “I didn’t want to tell you about these things because it still isn’t easy to talk about. I wanted you to know, you’re my kid, you deserve to know. Remember how I told you I don’t like yelling, loud noises, and bright flashes? This is why. It reminds me of things I don’t want to remember. I’m sorry that I didn’t tell you, I didn’t know how. I love you, Teddy.”
“Draco, stop teasing me.”
Harry grinned and nodded. He started wearing Sirius' jacket every-so-often when he first got it, but the winter was a bit too cold for it. Now that it was warming up he'd started wearing it more often.
They all insisted she sit with them. Hermione was going to sit on Ron’s lap to make more room, but Dean and Seamus beat her to it. Nobody questioned why Seamus insisted on sitting on Dean’s lap, everyone knew why, and everyone was frustrated by the fact that they still weren’t a couple.
That received a few murmurs from around the room. Draco just looked at the floor, he hadn’t intended on anyone ever discovering his actions, but now he was thankful that people told their stories.
by EE Ottoman. He looked at the back and read over the plot. A doctor and a retired Navy surgeon in the 1830s, trying to protect a man accused of being transgender. He bit his lip through a grin and looked up at Harry with excited eyes. “For someone who doesn’t read very often, your taste in books is quite impressive.” He said as he set the book atop the other one. He passed Harry a smaller present, though it was a bit thick.
“You are, but that’s beside the point. The point is, although you are perfect, I am the better lover. I’m the one who started the love letters, I-“ He cut himself off to think a moment. “I seduced you into letting me touch you multiple times.” He thought again. “I carried your books for you and healed you when you broke your arm.” Draco was slowly realizing that perhaps, Harry might have been a bit more romantic than him.
“Not to say I’m unused to you two talking about me, but could you at least do it behind my back?”
Harry smiled and then let out a laugh. "Sorry, I'm just glad we're able to move on."
“So we’re trapped.”
“A decade? Harry, you’ll be married off by then.”
“Harry, I want to be here for you, I really do. But I need to know what you need. Do you want a distraction, to talk, to cry, to be left alone, to sit together in silence, I need to know.”
Harry’s thighs shook and he moaned out, calling out the name of the boy above him. His back arched and his breaths turned to panting. He writhed once more as his inability to move his hips was frustrating.
The class erupted in accusations as to who Harry could have married. Given it was only his second year teaching, he had no idea how to reel the class in, so he let them get it all out. Word spread and by the end of the day, he had students asking who he was married to. He decided to make it into a game. He offered up a hundred Galleons to anyone who could guess who he married.
Harry closed his eyes and no one said anything else. They let him have a moment to process it before Arthur finished up the article.
He brought it all inside and set the papers on the coffee table before taking his letter into the kitchen. It was from Hermione. Pawk and her spoke with Effie Crow and brought up St. Mungo's reform to get Crow to help in converting older members of Luther’s failed opposition. She got excited by the idea and immediately got to sending letters to a few of them, in hopes of arranging a meeting tomorrow before the vote. Apparently, Pawk was putting off her list of The Silent Seven in order to prepare Crow to convince the older members to vote for her. Harry decided to write a letter to Pawk, asking for her final name with the offer of taking care of it for her.
“Hey. Are you alright?” He asked.
Lucius folded his hands behind his back, standing tall and looking quite proud of himself. “Harry used old law to insult me, so I’ve used old law to regain my honor and to punish my blood traitor of a son.”
The blonde gasped with joy, “Oh, you blush everywhere!” He couldn't have been more attracted to Harry. He thought everything about him was charming in its own way.
Her lips parted and her hand slowly moved to cover her mouth as he spoke. “Merlin.” She sighed out the name, horrified. “How have things been for you?”
Harry wrote a letter. It was a really long one. Maybe there was an apology meshed in between the lines, and if there was, Harry didn't even know if he meant it. Apologies weren't the point and forgiveness would have been a waste of time. It listed out everything he had done and why. It was nearly a manifesto. An apologetic manifesto but he didn't know who he was apologizing to. Maybe to the recipient, but it was also apologetic to the wizarding world in general for what might happen when he left. He felt he spent too much time on that. Too many what-if's and they might all be for nothing. He hoped so. He so badly wanted to be wrong. Still, he wrote. Everything he did and how, and a few extra tips to help the reader make their own little schemes.
Draco took a deep breath. He wasn’t sure what he was feeling. In fact, he wasn’t sure that he felt anything at all. He spent the rest of the day on that sofa, unwilling to move. When he did leave to go to his room he found sleep to be impossible. As much as he wanted to believe that his father would come to his senses and call the whole thing off, he doubted it.
He twitched again.
Draco never spoke about what he lost. He felt like because they were Death Eaters, it wasn’t valid. They were the bad guys, so their deaths didn’t matter. But Harry wanted it, so he went for it. He wasn’t sure why, but he was willing to do whatever it took to make Harry feel better. He could tell that Harry’s done all the talking that he wants, but now it’s a distraction he’s looking for. So he spoke about the people he lost, who they were to him, how he remembered them, how they died, among other things.
Sometime in the afternoon, Harry remembered his presents for Draco. They had been hidden under his bed for weeks now and he managed to forget they were ever even there. He sat up and looked down at Draco, “I have your Christmas present in our room if you want it.”
“A what?” Harry had no idea what the term meant, but he assumed it was something sexual by the way Draco smirked.
He struggled to sleep that night because he was too excited about the future.
“No, but someone should.” Draco grew a grin and he became very interested.
From the moment they woke up, Draco knew something was wrong.
“Well, it is, until you get to the ball. It ends with a really long and really heavy sex scene.”
“Wha-” He was about to question her, but almost immediately realized what she was doing. “He hasn’t hurt me, mother.”
When he checked out, the woman didn’t even seem to pay attention to what it was she was ringing up. She only added the amounts on the tags and took Draco’s money, as he, of course, paid with exact change.
“Happy now, git?” Draco mumbled through his final whimpers.
“Yes, but she had suspicions since third year. She wrote about it in her journal.” He found Draco walking around the hospital wing and he smiled. He watched as Draco spent most of his time in the back room where they brewed medicine.
Harry’s face went dark red. He hadn’t even considered that there were two possibilities. He tensed up a bit and looked away, trying to find the words to respond. He struggled greatly with intimacy, but was slowly getting better.
Harry looked over the patents, but he didn’t really care. The cufflinks were cool, and he would definitely be using them. But he was mostly interested in the journal.
Harry let out a laugh. “That’s the most posh dessert I’ve ever heard of.”
Draco nodded and took the flower. He seemed very happy about having received it.
Pansy chuckled. “He’s obsessed. Now, your turn.”
“The economy.”
“I tried your brothers but you wouldn’t let me.”
Draco nodded. "He showed me where you were mentioned. It's on page twenty-seven, by the way." He commented before drinking some more.
Harry found himself going to see Teddy every weekend now. It got to the point where he and Draco were given keys to Andromeda‘s house.
It was natural for him to call Teddy his godson, a few years and he simply called him his son. At first, he referred to Scorpius as his kid. He knew Draco intending for Harry to also father Scorpius, they’d had a million conversations about it, but the idea of parenthood still unnerved him. By the time Scorpius was only a few months old, he was telling all his friends about his two sons. Around the same time, Teddy began asking if he could spend the weekends with Harry and Draco, who immediately gave him a room in their house. They decorated it for him, he moved some of his clothes and toys in, and he had his second home with his fathers and brother.
“I saw your dick twitch, you’re pretty well endowed and you don’t wear underwear to bed, it’s hard to miss.” He said it as if it was a completely casual thing to say.
They both spent a lot of time out of the house. At every chance they could they went out and saw their friends. Harry also had his job and Draco would read in his room if everyone he still spoke to were busy. Since his trail, Death Eaters considered him to be a blood traitor, a title he wasn't ashamed of in the slightest. But it also drastically shortened the list of people he spoke to. He still had his mother, Pansy, and occasionally he spoke to Blaise. Though Blaise ended up moving to France with his mother, so they couldn't see each other in person besides when Draco took the Floo to the Zabini villa.
“I am. I wrote all those love letters, flowers, blowjobs, I hold you at night, I make your bed, damn.” He spoke as if he had just realized how amazing he was. “I’m bloody perfect.” Of course he wasn’t serious.
Harry spent his summer trying to heal. Meditating, exercising, just about everything a self-help book would recommend. Of course, he felt stupid in the beginning, but no one ever judged or teased him about it. Everyone mourns in their own way. Harry had the most to mourn, so no one said a word to him.
Draco blinked a few times and realized Harry was much more involved than he thought. “Oh. Wow. Right, then. Anything I could do to help?”
Ron mocked offense, “I’d be a good husband!”
“Like what?”
“You do. Ever since I taught you to make it, it’s become your favorite food.”
Harry huffed as a blush spread on his cheeks. “Tempting.” He pretended to ponder it over.
Any semblance of fondness faded when Harry pulled his hand back to lick and spit on it. Those blue eyes widened as the now-lubed hand returned to him. The friction was so much better. His hips gave an eager buck and he nearly glared down at Harry.
He sat down at his table and Hermione turned to him. “Alright, I did some research and the bank will mint gold and silver, but they won’t melt it. We’ll have to figure out how to do that on our own. But besides that, the plan is good. I also checked the gold to silver ratio, it’s very high right now and shows no signs of dropping. If you wanted to try to beat the system like that, then I would recommend we start as soon as possible.”
“I happen to have class, Potter.”
It was strange to unload all of your baggage before someone else.
Harry, on the other hand, was lost in food. He had a week’s worth of meals planned and he was eager to get started. Cooking was one of the few things that he helped him relax.
“More! Yes! Draco!” His body shook in Draco’s arms, he gripped Draco’s shirt tighter, and his hips had become a quivering mess but he still rubbed himself against Draco’s thigh. He needed it too bad to feel embarrassed. The magic forced Harry to let out another moan before his body finally reached its limit and gave it.
It wasn’t a shop Harry had ever heard of, but Draco insisted it’s where they needed to go. According to him, it was the only place in Hogsmeade where they could get all their shopping done. He explained it as a shop that sold everything one would need for each season, and their Christmas stock was going on sale.
Harry only smiled, “I don’t think there’s a force in this universe that could stop me.”
He told himself everything was fine. He knew everything was fine. Hogwarts wasn’t being attacked, everyone was fine, he knew this, but it didn’t matter. It was as if somewhere, deep inside himself, he didn’t really believe everything was fine, and he was petrified.
“This’ll just make me fall asleep.” He said as he shifted around under the blanket, trying to discreetly snuggle into it.
Harry gets Draco talking with his friends, schemes, and has discussions of past abuses.
Draco sat in silence a moment before breaking it. “Don’t tell me you’re insecure.” He couldn’t believe someone as gorgeous as Harry might have issues with his body.
No nightmares befell Harry that night.
Seamus and Dean were finally a couple, that’s the best anyone could hope for. They spent their free time with each other, trying to make up for all the time they wasted with their pining. They were also looking into jobs at the Department of Magical Sports and Games. They were interested in helping to organize tournaments, advertise for them, and create more merchandise for the registered Quidditch teams. They were also looking to expand the scope of magical games, wanting to include more options since only a few existed. Since they were both raised in the Muggle world, they were looking to create magical versions of different Muggle sports.
Seeing how fit Harry was came second. Harry is quite beautiful after all.
Harry understood. He really did. He looked down a moment. “Fine. I won’t make this a regular thing, and I’ll talk to Hagrid about telling the proper authorities. But you know I don’t regret what I did.”
Narcissa and Andromeda were both silently intrigued by his willingness to go do it. Once he left the room, they proceeded to discuss it.
“That might not be a good idea.” Hermione countered. “As I said, everyone responds to the love languages differently. Harry doesn’t really enjoy getting gifts. Growing up he never had much of anything, and he never got birthday or Christmas presents. It’s hard enough getting him to accept gifts on holidays. I don’t think getting gifts is his love language.” She thought another moment before continuing. “Or acts of service. He hates asking for things, he likes doing things on his own because that’s just what he’s used to. It’s what he’s comfortable with. I don’t think what works on you would also work on him.”
Harry sighed and sat down at his desk. “Alright, what exactly do you want to know? Everyone I’ve ever thought to be cute, people I’ve considered a relationship with, what?”
Draco tilted his head, “Find anything interesting anyways?” He had been hoping for something amusing when Harry returned. Originally he stayed up with the hope of Harry revealing some secret relationship to him. But now that he realized how boring Harry was when no one was trying to kill him, he was hoping Harry found something more gripping to tell Draco in one of the books.
They talked about plenty of things. But they didn’t talk about the dead, that was too hard and some things were just better left alone.
"Of course! I can take a beating and I've learned to dodge."
“No. I broke my rib when I was a kid, but we just hid it cause the Dursley’s didn’t want to get in trouble.”
The plum robe that he hated so much left his body for the last time. He didn't want to bring it home. He didn't want to deal with that garment again. So he dropped it on the floor and walked away from it. It felt good to leave it behind, it felt like he'd closed a door. He wanted to feel like another one was opening but he didn't know anymore. There was a whole future ahead of him. Running The Cupboard Project to help orphans and victims of abuse. It was everything he could have asked for but he felt like he was making a mistake. If it wasn't for his meddling then maybe he, Hermione, and Pawk's work never would have made it. He wondered if anyone would be able to do what he did and keep the ball rolling. He tried to reassure himself, since a lot of the older members were going to be retiring through out the next few months. Spring was always a popular time. A lot had already made retirement plans. That would make things easier with more younger people in. Still, he worried. Maybe he could stay. He wanted to do it all because as much as he wanted to trust other people, he also didn't want to be wrong. Things could fall apart and he'd be back at square one. Tom Riddle could wear a plum robe. He didn't want to leave room for that. He didn't want that to be his fault again. Maybe it never was his fault. He didn't ask to be born. Still, too many things could go wrong and he didn't want to deal with another Voldemort again.
Something about it scared him. He was afraid he would mess it up. He felt like a big responsibility was being put on him, but he also felt so loved.
She sat down and let a few tears fall from her face, wrapping her arms around Draco and keeping him close.
They spent the next few moments trying to encourage Neville, but he was having none of it. “Guys, really, it doesn’t matter. I’ll get over her eventually.”
He smiled at the thought of his father surprising his mother with the necklace as a pun on her name. In his head, his mother loved it and thought it was funny too. But it could also be a gift for his father from his mother. Her making a pun on her own name and giving it to James so that he’ll always have her wherever he goes. Or it could have been a necklace his mother had since she was a girl.
Draco saw the way Harry’s mouth twisted and he knew he was done for.
“No, but it doesn’t hurt to prepare for the worst.”
With that, Draco had to leave to go face his mother.
The warmth of another wasn't something that Harry would ever get used to. He was used to the isolation of his cupboard. He wasn't used to the tenderness and love that radiated off of Draco. He and Cedric really had fancied each other all those years ago, but now Harry understood that what they had wasn't love. Not really. It could have been, but it wasn't. But this, the blonde in his arms, that was love. It was a fire, passionate and new. He hoped to see the day where it became something warm, flickering, and familiar. Eventually he hoped to see when time turns their fire to warm and bright embers, and although tame, embers alone are just as dangerous as flame. He knew that if cared for, they could burn forever.
Draco licked his lips. “You can do anything you want to me, Harry. But remember, this isn’t my first time, far from it. I‘ve learned self-control. So don’t be surprised when I’m not nearly as bad as you.”
He left and quickly made his way back home to see Harry was chopping some fruit for lunch. He scurried into the kitchen and held up his bag of books with a grin. Never before has Draco had the urge to share his books with someone else, but here he was, excited to tell Harry all about a matter he once considered personal and secretive.
Harry hollowed his cheeks so he could suck Draco’s cock a bit harder, he took a bit more into his mouth, he let his tongue roam around the new skin, and he let out soft hums as he did it.
Never in his life had he hoped he would be wrong more than right now.
A desire came over him and he leaned across the shaking body under him, his hands steadying himself as he dove in for the taking. He kissed Harry once more. It was much softer, their lips ghosted and occasionally pressed as they hummed and groaned, making the most carnal music.
“Thank you.” Alex wasn’t stupid. They knew that whatever the second reason was, it was more important to their meeting. “Secondly?”
Conversation stopped there. They both retired for the night in Harry’s bed. But even if neither of them confessed their feelings, they were forever changed.
Harry rolled his eyes.
The incantation worked almost as the opposite of a Patronus. It forced him to feel all his worst memories and then it used the hate in him to kill. He didn’t think he was capable of such hate since he was never able killed before. Now he knows he’s capable of more than enough.
"Threaten you? No, don’t be obvious." With that, Charlie left and the director returned only a few seconds later.
Draco noticed and smirked down at Harry’s length. “Absolutely gorgeous.”
"You got me, there." He admitted. "Harry used to room with me, before all this. He doesn't snore, by the way, I just like messing with him. But his dragons'll stay up till midnight."
Draco, on the other hand, felt absolutely pathetic. He couldn’t believe he was getting jealous when Harry wasn’t even his. He decided to help himself feel better by Flooing home and pampering himself. He took a long and warm bubble bath, massaging himself as he washed. He was able to relax a while and not think about how dumb he was being. He really couldn’t believe he was feeling this way over a boy that wasn’t his. Still, the bath was so relaxing that he couldn’t help but to let it go for a while. He put on a few different lotions and spritzed on his favorite cologne. He felt strangely better after pampering himself. He took the Floo back to see Harry standing in their sitting room, with John.
- - - - -
Harry raised an eyebrow and gave a small smile. “Were?”
With that, they each got comfy and eventually fell asleep. But just before he fell asleep, Harry found himself thinking of Draco’s jawline one last time, much to his dismay.
Laughter. It was full of laughter from Sirius and Remus. But nothing from James.
“I’m sorry. I hope that wasn’t too forward or anything. I’m just ..... I can’t believe it.” He blinked a few times and then cracked a smile. “
Ah, a sarcastic society. Of course. One that was made with the sole purpose of setting up Dean and Seamus. Draco could only assumed that Harry had made up the name on the spot and had only labeled it a secret society in order to get Draco interested. It worked.
"My thoughts exactly."
“Oh contraire, Wizengamot undid the laws surrounding the oaths we took, but didn't search as deep into old law as I did. This is very legal. Just as legal as Potter’s rights to my wine.” He grinned as if he had just revealed a secret.
Harry blushed and rolled his eyes. He then looked up at Draco and bit his lip. “You looked so cute. Can I do that again, sometime? Maybe tomorrow, or the day after that, or an hour? Whenever you want to, really. It’s up to you.”
Harry felt trapped. He was on his back with his knees bent, feet flat on the bed. He bucked into his own hand as fast as he could but it still wasn't enough. All he could feel was need. His body craved the sweet release that he'd denied himself for so long. He panted and blushed as he felt as if his pleasure had plateaued. He couldn't move any faster, so he tightened his hand a bit and used his thumb to tease his head. There was nothing to help him cope with the powerful feelings inside of him, and he loved that. He knew that soon enough, he would be overcome. He felt a coy smile take over his face as he let out throaty groans that reverberated through his room.
“Clean it up or I will burn all your Christmas presents. I swear I’ll throw them all in the fire.”
"Might as well. Nothing better to do."
“I didn’t know they would scare you like that! It was just suppose to be a joke! I didn’t mean for it to turn out like that!” He began tearing up, desperate for Harry to tell him that it was okay.
"Am I having an identity crisis?" He looked over at his closet and let out a laugh as he realized what a drastic change he's made just on a whim. He shook his head and decided he might as well give this new outfit a try. He slipped on Sirius' jacket and took the Floo to Diagon Alley. He found himself being looked at, but not the kind of looks he was used to. People didn't look disgusted by his outfit or starstruck because he's Harry Potter. Instead, he found both men and women looking him up and down. People were attracted to him, and that only boosted his confidence.
“Not officially.” Ron spoke as if they were in total agreement that this was, in fact, a competition.
Words of affirmation. Harry needed it now more than ever. But by the same token, threats and taunts could also work wonders on him.
She took a deep breath and looked over at Alec again, but this time, he caught her eye and smiled, waving her over. "Oh." She said softly before standing up and wiping the surprised expression off of her face. "I suppose I should go over there. Wish me luck."
He was very aware that it was all just a front to lock his father away for entirely unrelated crimes. But still, he got through it. He got through every interview, every court date, every testimony, and every news article. He got through it all.
“A dream. You said it yourself, it happened cause you weren’t wanking or stressed. You sure you aren’t gonna wake me up one night, rubbing yourself in your sleep?”
“Scoundrel.”
Harry’s cheeks went pink and he rolled his eyes, trying to pretend he didn’t hear it. When he looked back up at Draco, he was caught by the sight of a man in the throes of pleasure. This beautiful and experienced man was on top of him, tempting him with an orgasm. He looked gorgeous and Harry could feel himself getting even closer. His moans and gasps were growing ever more embarrassing.
Draco was also learning quite a bit about Harry Potter. Like everyone else, Draco had only ever seen the noble and publicized version of Harry. The Golden Boy, The Boy Who Lived, he knew him only as his monikers. But the man who stood in Wizengamot and defended him, he'd never seen that man before. It made him question how much he really knew about Harry.
"We can't do
Dean was bent over, rummaging through a shelf, and Seamus was trying to keep the potion at the proper temperature.
“Hi.” He said softly, extending his hand to shake hers.
“He likes when your hair is messy and your little stubbly beard. He said it makes you look wild and like you’ve just had sex. It drives him crazy.” She tilted her head. “I’m starting to think you’re attracted to how refined Draco is and Draco’s attracted to how disheveled you are.”
“Never make fun of my skincare routine again.” He said as he tightened his grip and began moving his hand up and down.
Harry closed his eyes in relief and felt like he won a lottery. Narcissa ran to Draco, hugging him and crying. Draco was magically bound to the chair but was promptly released, and he hugged his mother. They were both in tears.
Harry moved into his house in Hogsmeade and began wondering what he was meant to do with his life. Should he date and find someone to marry, was he to get a job or live off his wealth like his father? Harry liked the idea of working, but he didn’t know where to start. He didn’t want to work in the Ministry, that was certain, but he still wanted to make a difference.
“What?” Draco sat up and looked over at Harry in shock. He couldn’t believe Harry would say such a thing.
Harry was surprised, but he appreciated it. “Do you know how to make spaghetti?”
“Tell him that Andromeda is doing well. That she’ll never have to work a day in her life. I’m taking care of her and Teddy. He doesn’t need to worry about them. Tell him I’m going to buy a house and Teddy will have a room there so he can come over anytime he wants. Tell him I’m going to teach at Hogwarts so I’ll be able to watch out for Teddy everyday. Tell him Teddy’s cousin Draco is looking out for him too. Tell him Draco reads to him all the time and is trying to teach him French even though I think it’s pointless. He’s a baby, he doesn’t need to know French. But tell him Teddy’s already better at French than I’ll ever be. Tell him that Teddy will have all the clothes, toys, and books he could ever want.” He hiccuped as he tried to calm his breathing. “Tell him Teddy isn’t going to grow up like us. He’ll have it better. He’s gonna be better than we ever were.” Harry sniffled. “Tell him I’ll make sure Teddy lives an amazing life. Tell him he didn’t die for nothing.”
It was a bit of a hard topic because even Remus believed Sirius was guilty until that fateful night in the Shrieking Shack.
Petunia wasn’t exactly close to Lily, so his only real connections to his parents were Sirius and Remus. One taken by Bellatrix Lestrange, the other by the war.
Then, McGonagall came in, leading a group of about forty first years. Harry supposed most of his classmates who survived the war, and would-be classmates, must have transferred to other schools.
His characters got together, explored their careers, explored their dynamic, grew together, and now he had nothing more to say but he needed something to draw it all to a close. An "and they all lived happily ever after" was absolutely out of the question. Draco refused to just leave the reader hanging with the knowledge that the characters were going to keep living their lives as they had been. Though in terms of happiness, it was a fine ending, something about it still fell flat. It wasn't whole and he couldn't quite figure out how. The characters had each overcome serious obstacles in their careers and were moving forward as a couple, they'd moved in together, he even had them adopt a cat together. It was a perfectly happy ending but it still just wasn't enough. Everything was complete, everything had ended. It was so neatly and nicely packaged but there was something left to be desired. It didn't feel finished and yet it was meant to be.
While Draco was off with his mother, Harry went to the closest Muggle town and found himself at the library. He changed into “street clothes”, things he would never wear at Hogwarts. A loose white tee shirt, Sirius’ leather jacket, his mother’s necklace, black jeans that fit him well, and dark brown boots. He looked like he belonged in a rock band.
“This ought to be fun.” He said before standing up with a grin. “I’ll leave you to your work, for now. But don’t expect such mercy tomorrow.” He spoke as if he was some monarch making a serious threat about his power and influence. Something about that joking superiority, a tribute to his old attitude, made Harry smile.
Harry for one, was a bit more open about his hesitation, "We''ll become public spectacles. Even more so than we used to be."
“He offered once and then he told me I could take them whenever I please.” He clarified, figuring their silence might have been over whether or not Harry had permission to take Draco's clothes.
The meeting continued and Harry and Hermione were grilled. They were shown no mercy, but they were prepared. All questions were answered to the best of their ability, though some had no answer yet. Some could only be answered theoretically. They dispelled many rumors and did their best to ease any doubts. The only thing that truly worried Harry was when someone asked about the lawyer representing the department, and he had to answer, "Daniel Greenwood." The man who got Lucius Malfoy off in exchange for the arrest of the remaining Death Eaters. There was a mixed reaction as some approved of what he did but other, more stern believers, hated him for negotiating with a perceived evil.
Harry’s face reddened and he decided now was as good a time as any to take his revenge. He was suddenly invigorated by the adrenaline of both shame and anger. He grabbed his boyfriend by his boner and quickly began to get him off.
Seamus nodded, satisfied. "Well, there's no harm in taking inspiration from real life. How about friends in Hogwarts who fall in love?"
“Very funny Draco, but no. I didn’t. It was only a small hamlet.”
He scoffed and crossed his arms. “I doubt you know anything about literature, Potter.”
"Though, I would like to apologize for something in particular." Harry confessed. "In the bathroom, when I cast that spell, and ..... and I almost killed you." His voice was weak and he cleared his throat, trying to get his words out. "I didn't know what the spell would do, so it was incredibly stupid of me to have been messing around with unfamiliar magic. I only knew it was labeled as a spell meant for enemies. I was horrified when I saw all the blood ....." His voice trailed off and so did his mind. He stared at nothing in particular as he remembered coming upon Draco's body.
- - - - -
“Second-rate?” He asked with a laugh. He thought it was a bit hilarious.
“First of all, Mr. Potter, I’m not giving away the job. I’m telling you that if you want the job, you should fill out an application like everyone else. Don’t confuse me for some groupie. You’ll go through the hiring process like everyone else. Secondly, I want to hire you because you know what you’re doing. I’ve seen that your teachings work. It saved lives. You also seem to be a natural fit for the job, given your history. Now, do you want the job?”
He tripped on his words and ended up getting himself a boyfriend. It was quite adorable.
“Don’t be. Do it whenever you want.” He smirked, “That was the most arousing display I have ever seen.”
The sun rose the next morning and Harry peeled his eyes opened. He saw that Draco was wrapped up in his arms. He smiled to himself and wanted to go back to sleep. He was so warm and inviting. It was tempting, it was enticing, but he had to get up.
“But the silver to gold ratio fluctuates in Muggle economy.”
When Harry defended him, he put up a very compelling argument. He questioned whether Draco was truly acting of his own will. He compared the two of them. He made a point of describing how neither of them had a choice in anything they did. The only difference was that they were on different sides of the war. He described all the people he’s hurt and the laws he broke, while Draco had breakdowns in the bathroom. He let everyone know that his crimes were greater than Draco’s, but Draco was the only one of them to feel remorse. It was a dark and troubling set of arguments, but in the end, it was enough to make everyone see that Draco had never really been a bad guy. At least, not of his own will.
After his shift in the hospital wing, he went to charms, where again, he relished in making Harry laugh.
“A little after eight. Wanna go see Teddy now?”
“I knew it.”
Harry nearly shouted and his body twisted as he was pleasured from both ends. Moving his hips back impaled him further onto Draco, but moving his hips forward brought him to a teasing hand. His lips parted as he gasped for breath and let out every whine and wail that he wanted. A small smile spread across his face as he was overcome by such a wonderful feeling.
“Then why are you laying on your back, getting off to me threatening you?”
Draco was frozen for a moment before he stepped aside and wordlessly let Harry in. He didn't know that Harry was aware of his sensitivity, but as he thought about it, he can't recall a meal where Harry used very much dairy.
So he wrote on.
Harry had a sweet smile spread over his face as he reveled in the ocean of pleasure that he had fallen victim too, finally brought under by the waves that once washed his body. He never knew why but he always gave a demure smile when he was close. Truthfully, Draco thought it to be absolutely charming, a testimony to innocence.
Once inside, he made a casual comment, “How’ve you been holding up, Draco? I know there aren’t many girls around here.”
“I can’t help what I am.”
A groan slipped out as his back arched even further and his head tilted back. He was gasping and grunting, overcome by the building pleasure. It swirled in his hips and demanded to be released. He raised his hips up and moved his hand as fast as he could, accidentally drawing a soft cry from his mouth as he tried to to finish himself off. His thoughts went on to the idea of Harry’s hand touching him instead. The fantasy was so simple, yet it was the one thing he wanted the most right now. He didn’t need sex or Harry’s heart, right now, he only needed a hand. His thighs shook and his little noises only grew more desperate as he got closer. As much as he once wanted to make the night last a while, the Harry in his mind was egging him on, demanding that he finish, that he give Harry his cum. Draco didn’t know why his fantasies had become so lewd but it only made him want to finish even more.
Gifts.
“You weren’t even in the shower for ten minutes. I feel sorry for your future lover.”
“You dolt! Didn’t you read the interview Potter gave only a few days ago about his support for Pawk?” A woman in the group harshly whispered to the man that was so sure Pawk was evil. It made the man’s eyes widened and his face was drained from shock.
“Of course. You don't need the harassment.” She agreed.
Draco seemed more shocked than anything. He covered his face and stared at the ground. He couldn’t believe he was really going to work at Hogwarts. It had always been his dream to work in medicine, and for the past few months being a Healer at Hogwarts was all he wanted. Now he was finally getting it.
Draco’s eyes rolled back and he continued to pant, but every exhale was another hungry noise. “More, please! Faster, Harry.” Harry’s hands were much rougher than what he was used to. He was used to expensive moisturizers and soft skin from his lovers. But Harry’s skin was tough from the years of work. It made everything feel so much better. He hardly felt halfway there but he was already shaking.
Harry laughed to himself but it was soon interrupted by, “What the fuck, Harry?”
The pointed tip of a tongue slowly teased his rim, sliding from the outside to just against the inside, flicking against the sensitive opening.
"I uhm, I suppose it's the same, expect I guess I don't like being bitten." He added in a small voice. His embarrassment was obvious, but he still took the conversation as seriously as Draco. He simply wasn't used to this.
But no one realized they were married to each other.
Harry blinked a few times and came to realize what she was suggesting. “That’s manipulation.” He said it very plainly, as if he had no particular stance on the morality of manipulating others, and for a moment, he didn't. He suddenly began to realize how clever the girl really was.
came drifting through the house.
His friends were used to Harry moving around without saying much. It was just part of his adjusting to being back at Hogwarts. They knew he’d be back to his normal self soon enough.
Andromeda agreed and without even thinking about it, Harry took the cup and headed towards the kitchen. “Do you mind, Andromeda?”
“Then we could work at Hogwarts together. Who knows, maybe I’ll become head of the infirmity and be able to sit up with the rest of the staff at banquets.”
“Of course. I’ll be there.”
“I’m coming!” The blonde called back as he finished fixing his hair and put on his favorite French cologne.
“Draco!” He gasped out the blonde’s name before his body stilled and his mouth opened in a silent cry. He was motionless and quiet for a few seconds before he descended into a trembling mess. His hips stuttered and his mind was completely overloaded by the feeling of release. A loud moan tore from his throat as he came in his pants.
The room was filled with a dreadful curiosity.
Harry and Draco ended up falling into a pattern. They would eat breakfast together and everyone followed Harry as he did his work. The dragons stayed by Harry and Draco watched them. After a few weeks, Draco ran out of things to write about. He sent a letter to the Ministry that said there wasn't anymore work to be done. He even called Harry's life mundane. Still, they insisted he stick around for the dragon's teenage years, which were close to kicking in. At only ten months old, the dragons were the size of bears and as moody as fourteen year old humans. Once, they'd even gone as far as to hiss at Harry.
“I know.” He sighed, “I’ll try to. I just, I don’t want to just spring it on him. I want to build up to it. I want to wait for the right moment.”
For some reason, a grin spread across Harry's face. It wasn't from pride or happiness. It was something else entirely. It was hurt and sinister. He knew their reactions would be quite wild to his answer and he was almost excited to see their faces when he told them, "Because he's my husband."
Harry was making one hell of a dent in the restricted section. No book was spared from his hands. He was already on P, besides books focused on Potions or poltergeists, there wasn’t that much in the P section. He was also talking to other Professors about what teaching was like. He took advice he could get because DA was his only experience, and it certainly wasn’t a normal classroom environment. He was also talking with McGonagall about what he would be expected to teach the students each year, “Because Merlin knows I have no idea what I’m suppose to know in DADA, hardly any of the teachers were competent and all of them except Lupin managed to screw me over.” McGonagall wrote out a list of concepts that each year should be taught and Harry began to write out everything he knew on each subject, citing books and personal experience. He’s never been so excited about the future before.
Harry was also surprised by the sight of Draco. The first thing he noticed were the deep blue eyes that stared back at him, and the stark blonde hair that was a bit longer than before. He wore long and dark Auror robes fit him very well, no doubt he had them tailored to his body. He was as lean and lithe as when they were in school, but he seemed slightly muscular. Even so, he still looked as soft and posh as ever, likely due to all the expensive lotions he used. It was nice to see that some things never change.
"Then you could write a sequel about the farmer going from dating the big city lawyer, to going back to the country and dating a stable boy!"
Mr. Demgass wasted no time in getting to the nitty-gritty. “Mr. Potter, I must say, I’m quite impressed with you stealing a dragon. That was the most interesting thing to happen in my near-century of working here. Now, on to your problem, if you want to call it that.” The goblin pulled out a large file and it slammed onto his desk. Many of the papers inside looked ancient and worn. Much of the writing was faded and the pages were laid instead of woven. It had to be older than the 1700s at least. “You are now the head of twenty-two houses, but given the grim look you walked in with, I assume you didn’t come to celebrate.”
“I don’t wanna take it off.” He mumbled as he unwrapped one arm from around Draco and reached over to get his cocoa. He took a sip and let his head lean back against the wall, unintentionally showing off his neck.
His face went red as he recounted the story. “I was thirteen, in the room I had been given at the Dursley’s. I’d had boners before, but I never did anything. It was a much less stressful time, so I think my body got sick of my shit, and one night, I had a dream. When I woke up, I was rutting into the mattress like a dog in heat. At that point, I couldn’t stop.” His face turned red and he looked away. “Thankfully, I was quiet enough that my voice didn’t reach anyone else’s room. When I was done, I was too exhausted and I just fell back asleep.”
Harry’s cheeks went pink from the accusation. “I’ll have you know, I don’t bottom.” He wasn't even sure why he was humoring Draco with the conversation, but he felt the need to defend himself.
Neville Longbottom, Arthur and Molly Weasley, and Narcissa and Draco Malfoy all found themselves in the lobby of Gringott's bank for the same reason. They were the last remaining descendants of the House of Black, and there were a few things to settle.
Harry looked up at Draco while he leaned in and gave the head a soft lick.
“Thank you Draco, really. But you don’t have t-“
Seamus always relaxed because Dean was practically a radiator, giving off ridiculous amounts of heat and warming Seamus from the inside out. He loved being held by Dean. Something about it made his heart flutter and swell at the same time.
When they woke the next morning, Draco’s head was laying on Harry’s chest and he had an arm thrown around his friend’s torso.
That night, the fall term was officially over, and that morning, a majority of the students left Hogwarts. In the Great Hall, only about thirty students were there for breakfast. Harry was pretty happy at the peace and quiet.
Draco found himself grinning in the mirror while he thought about Harry’s slip-up. He found it quite adorable that Harry accidentally called him love.
They spent the night cooking, eating, and talking. The wine made conversation flow even easier. Ten minutes into it and Harry was confessing a few details of his childhood that he had never really spoken about, and Draco found himself doing the same. Four glasses in and they were like open books. They sat there until some ridiculous hour of the night and let out things they never thought they would confess to another person.
They were both grinning and giddy over their night together. There was a fluttering in Draco’s chest while Harry’s held fireworks. Draco’s excitement was a shyer and more coy one, still a bit embarrassed by how they woke up, even though he enjoyed it. Harry, on the other hand, had a spring in his step, and he made it obvious that he was very happy about something.
“Alright then, what can I do to help?”
"What?! How does this prove anything?! I saw the article, of course I saw who wrote it."
Draco continued in his letter to Pansy, detailing how the meeting went. He added in Harry's outburst but also mentioned how Harry fought to combine their surnames. He was looking for every positive he could find to convince himself that things might not be as bad as they seem. But no matter how he felt about it, tomorrow, he was to move in to his new husband’s house, and there he would start his new life as Harry Potter’s spouse.
The next day, just before Easter holiday, Harry and Hermione withdrew some more Galleons to be melted. She needed the funds so she and Ron could start shopping around for furniture. They acted as if they were going to move in tomorrow. It was sweet, but it was also making Harry worries about his own future. Should he start looking for a house? Was he waiting too late?
Neville laughed at Harry’s random comment. Mostly because it was true and he never noticed before. Shortly after, he was paired with a boy from Ravenclaw, and left.
“Oh, I used a special spell to lock the door. It’s special because it can only be undone by the same person who casted it.”
Harry was dumbfounded, “You don’t like Quidditch?!”
Those wide green eyes seemed so innocent in such a moment. "Is this flirting?" He didn't even know why he asked such a thing. It came out before he could control his tongue.
Early the next morning, Harry sent out a Howler of his own.
“You should, you’re wonderful with plants.” Ron said with a nod, “Much better than me. I’ll never really get Herbology, but you look like you don’t even have to try.”
Harry's coat and shirt had lifted, getting snow on his lower stomach. He could also feel a little snow in his trousers. "I'm cold and I'm absolute shit at sledding. How do I keep falling and hitting rocks? Why don't you ever fall?"
Harry got a noodle out, “You flick it at the wall. If it sticks, it’s ready.” He flicked it onto the wall and the noodle stayed for a second, before lamely falling. “Not ready yet.”
He let out a shy chuckle and thanked her. "Did Molly tell you about the adjusted Christmas plans?"
"I just want to marry you. We could do it naked in your flat if you wanted, we could make out vows in the bed, seal it with much more than a kiss for all I care. I don't mind where or when, I just want to spend the rest of my life with you."
Draco tsked and shook his head, “No, I’m too gorgeous to be on the dirty ground. You’ll realize your mistake and come to my rescue.”
"I'm going to write the book."
Harry let out a laugh and Draco squeezed beside him, laying on his side to face Harry.
It all felt very convoluted and twisted to him. It was as if someone had gone out of their way to make him life more complex than it needed to be. Or at the very least, his time at Hogwarts. But it was almost comforting to think that he hadn’t really lost his loved ones. Still, he tried not to get his hopes up.
“It’s really fine, in the end it was my choice.” Harry said, not wanting anyone to feel bad. But by the same token he also wanted to bludgeon them all.
Harry nodded and Draco pulled Harry’s left sleeve up as gently as he could. He began to wrap him up in a cast.
“Then I’d have to heal us both.”
He headed over towards The Three Broomsticks, which the Searcys often frequented. On his way there, he received quite a few looks. Some angry, others suspicious, and some even pitying. He figured it had something to do with his dance with Draco and ignored him. Journalists snapped photos and tried to ask questions about it, but he only ignored them. Others threw out questions that seemed vaguely like threats, asking if he or Draco are prepared in case an extremist goes after them. He ignored it all and left them at the door of The Three Broomsticks, his eyes searching for the Searcys.
“Yes.”
He sent all his books flying back to their proper places and threw away all his used parchment before going off to lunch to get something to eat and eyefuck his boyfriend from across the room. He spent his lunch period shooting smiled over at Draco and occasionally winking.
Draco beamed at the praise he received. “I’ll always be a pain in your arse, Potter.” He smirked down at the boy. “Or I could be quite pleasurable.”
Harry cracked a smile and continued. "Right, but it's going well. I know we have around twenty votes secured, we just need about fifteen more to get it off the ground." The wizarding elite, which made up most of Harry's opposition, still held a small majority of Wizengamot. They were not okay with things that they once considered normal suddenly being made illegal. It sickened Harry to think that abuse had become so normalized, but he wasn't going to let that slide any longer.
Harry nodded and looked up at Draco’s face, curious as to where this was going.
Harry was still silent. He wiped his eyes and looked at the page expectantly. He hoped to finally know their identities. Most of all, he hoped that they were who he thought they might be.
Harry found a box of stuff after cleaning out his parent’s vault, including his mother’s old journal.
Harry agreed and they found themselves glancing around at three trees that sat at just on their preferred the height and width.
Hermione nodded. “Yea. He’ll experiment a bit, and once he figures out what his lover enjoys, he’ll do it all. Develop sweet habits for them, like making your bed. He also occasionally does bigger things, like getting you flowers. He tries to mix it up and keep it a bit spontaneous.”
“You’re worse than a girl.”
"I know, that's what I thought at first. But, after what went down, he has something to prove and something to lose. I thought he'd be the best fit."
Draco gasped once more and his cheeks went red as he got up to wipe his cheek off with a tissue. “Ew, your got your slobber on me!” He ignored the fact that he absolutely loved the attention he was given. He looked over to see Harry looked very satisfied with himself and seemed to be enjoying the icing in his mouth. “You blind bastard.”
Since The Cupboard Project was created, he felt more educated on the subject. He was very aware that physical and verbal abuse existed, but he didn’t have any idea that emotional abuse was a thing. He’d found himself looking at old versions of The Cupboard Project that Harry had in their house. He looked at the different variations of their definition of emotional abuse. He looked at their examples. He saw things that were much more familiar than he expected. Things that he thought were normal, or that he had once written off as products of war stress. The more he thought about it, the further back he realized it started. It wasn’t just a few incidents during the war. It reached deep into his childhood, it was familiar and normal to him, and the war only escalated it to the point of Draco thinking it wasn’t the same. The war was only a scapegoat that Draco had created for himself. That hurt him. They hurt him. Draco was hurt.
Draco’s aura of superiority didn’t falter for a second. “You’re half-right.” He said in a teasing tone. “I do have a thing for, the savage animals of men. But I don’t need to be taken. No. I know my place, and that’s on top. I want to tame you.
“This is the best day of my life.” He said as he rushed into the shower, pulling off his clothes as he went.
Harry's stern expression shifted to a comforting one. "I appreciate that. I really do. But we'll be fine."
“Unimportant.”
“My mother thinks my father may try to murder her for lying to Voldemort about you being dead. She just changed her will so he won’t get anything from her.”
“What’s his nickname?”
It was then that Draco remembered Harry's likely heterosexuality. Before he could ask about it, the bedroom door swung open.
“Sorry. I’m not sure how this usually works.” He confessed with a blush.
Draco thought a moment and remembered a small and cute fantasy of Harry’s. He once confessed he liked the idea of being ridden. After a bit of alcohol, he said he thought it’d be a beautiful sight and that he wanted his body to be used for pleasure. Of course, there was trauma that contributed to it and the conversation had turned into something vulnerable and serious. But the idea of his fantasy remained.
“Don’t say my name like that, Draco. Fuck!” He could listen to it forever. He was hardly halfway there, but Draco sounded close. He decided to use a hand to stroke Draco, whose name slipped out a few more times.
Of course Narcissa had see him in magazines, newspapers, and tabloids. She thought it was hilarious and adorable that he had become a celebrity. She offered no help when he was hounded by the paparazzi and instead, giggled at him while they hurried away. She thought it was amazing how he’d become famous for such a good reason. Pure bloods weren’t typically famous for just being so. The wizarding world has their own celebrities who were famous for their own reasons. Blood rarely had anything to do with it. For her son to gain fame for doing good warmed her heart.
The marital contract was meant to be arranged by a neutral third party. But, as with all property, Draco’s right of marriage was to be settled at Gringotts.
Twenty seven presents later and Teddy was all done unwrapping his new wardrobe. He won’t need new clothes until he’s six. They loaded him up for the next few years.
Harry choked. He physically choked on air. He started coughing and couldn’t stop a moment. When he finally collected himself he looked at Draco with wide eyes. “St-Stop that.” He was two seconds from a boner. It was all too much.
The blonde emerged from the bedroom with a smile. “Harry! I assume the vote went well?” He assumed this because Harry didn’t seem upset about anything. But his smile dropped when his lover started towards him with a determined expression. Of course, he wasn’t worried about what Harry was about to do, but he wasn’t sure how to react to such a sight.
With Draco back on his plans to flirt with Harry, he hit some unexpected luck.
“Merlin!” Harry exclaimed in a harsh whisper. He looked away and hid his face.
“How did no one recognize you?”
“Oh.” He realized he never told Harry his characters names. “The lawyer is Amell Adler and the photographer is Othello Hamel.”
Harry wasn’t sure why he did this, but the next day, when McGonagall called for him to hurry along to class, he responded with, “Yes Minnie, my love.”
Draco tilted his head and finally stepped out of the Floo. "Well, if it's what you like then I'm happy for you." He commented before glancing at the kitchen. "How about spaghetti tonight? We could finally open that bottle of Zinfandel?" He offered.
“Same difference.” He refused to properly acknowledge defeat.
Of course, it was noticed that Harry Potter was going to every table, except Slytherin, and whispering about something.
“I’m starting to think you just have an obsession with me.” He teased with a smirk.
Harry smirked. “He uh-“ He cut himself off with a chuckle. “He said you’re tolerable.”
Harry sighed. “Yes, I had a hickey. I’m an adult. Adults do things.” He didn’t want to explain his sex life to his friends.
Harry’s back was arched up once again and he squirmed a bit, trying to quell the excitement bubbling in his lower belly. “Draco.” He sighed out the blonde’s name and that send a rush through the boy on top on him.
Harry gave a cheeky smile and watched Draco open the other presents. At the books on medicine he seemed quite excited, “Thank you, Harry.”
Harry cleared his throat, a bit embarrassed, but it didn’t help the quality of his voice. “Whatever.”
He stared up at the blonde in shock. He blinked a few times and tried to compose himself. Which he mostly did, despite his red cheeks. “Congratulations. I can’t pull your hair anymore.” He struggled a bit and realized he couldn’t shake Draco’s weight off of him. He rolled his eyes. “Okay, you’ve won
Harry owned the titles, properties, and vaults of twenty-two Wizarding families.
Hermione also happened to know a bit about love languages, and she was tempted to break the whole thing down for them, but she didn’t want to ruin the magic of it. She decided to keep quiet about the reality of it and instead, smiled along with Pansy. “He’s a right tosser, but he has his moments. When he really cares about someone, he knows how to show it.”
Harry would never really know.
This. This tiny little family. Herself, her sister, her son, his boyfriend, and her great nephew. This unfamiliar house full of love was more of a home than Malfoy Manor ever was.
After working to settle the lawsuit, Harry found himself outside for a short stroll. He was hounded by paparazzi and reporters who all wanted to know about his current life, his work in the Ministry, The Cupboard Project, if Ron and Hermione were going to finally wed, and about the lawsuit he just helped settle. For a majority of his time in the public eye, he hated paparazzi. But now, he couldn’t have been happier to see them.
But it didn't feel as bad as before he put the feeling to words.
It was then that the Malfoys arrived. Lucius stood tall and proud, Narcissa looked as if she had been crying, and Draco refused to lift his eyes off the floor.
As everyone left, Pawk, Hermione, and a few others were going to go out for drinks, but Harry declined, saying that there was something he had to do and it couldn't wait.
Draco nodded, wordlessly enchanting his quill to take notes for him. "Was there anything else before their birth that may have contributed to this attachment?" He couldn't believe where he was, he couldn't believe what he was doing. He was in the middle of Romania, interviewing Harry Potter, who had three dragons at his side, and was meant to live with the man. The situation was unbelievable, but it was also as if the weight of it hadn't hit Draco yet. Rather than worrying about it, he had a sort of tunnel vision for the present. He was focusing himself on the task at hand and decided to worry about what came after when it was time.
Draco shrugged. “Well, I can’t get pregnant, and we have cleaning charms to take care of the mess.“
Harry sighed but seemed to relent. "Alright. I'll tell him when we get back to our room."
It’s too bad that Harry isn’t as oblivious as they would like to think. Though he’s often a bit clueless, he did understand when he was being used. He wasn’t going to let them.
“I’m excited. I want to see her and talk to her. I suspect she’s only ignoring me because father wants her to. I just hope she’s happy to see me.” Draco paused a moment, finding his words, “I want her in my life, I really do. I even miss my father, but he won’t talk to me. He only wrote me once to let me know he was free and that I couldn’t come to the Manor.”
Silent arms wrapped around their bodies and they ended up laying down in the arms of a lover. Basking in the glow of their confessions, how warm and stark, they burned.
“Precisely.”
He spoke with them a bit longer before he decided to put the map away for the day. He was already late to lunch and didn’t want to show up looking like he had been crying.
When Teddy read it, he ran to Harry’s office in the middle of the night, shyly knocking on the door.
He got the standard greeting.
Harry’s messy mop of hair framed his face as he lifted himself from Draco's body. “Really?” There was something so sweetly surprised in his tone. Something so innocent. It was as if he'd just been promised candy or flowers. The child-like excitement that he had displayed nearly made his lover laugh. For as cute as it was, there was also something crude about it. He was so openly excited, without a hint of nervousness or shame, about being taken.
by Cat Sebastian. He turned it over and read the summary, seeing it was about a man from the slums who did as he must to care for his siblings, and a proper retired soldier who was greatly tempted by him. “Oh, is this like an enemies to lovers?” He asked as he turned the book back over, excitement in his eyes. He couldn’t believe Harry actually found him a new book.
“Mother, I’m sorry to have done all this but you hardly ever respond to my letters anymore.”
Draco immediately thought of a few ways he and Harry could warm up. He was so attracted to the man next to him, it was ridiculous. "Thank you for making this, by the way."
A similar conversation came about where Draco was met with support, but Blaise was mostly interested on how cute Harry was. With the pictures he’d seen, he made the comment that every since Harry let his stubble grow he’s never looked so good. That lead to Draco telling his friends all about that morning, when he saw Harry shirtless for the first time. Laughter rang and they reveled in the bit of freedom they were all given by the holidays.
The mood thankfully lightened after a while. She thought the scar was funny, which was probably the best reaction they could have hoped for. But it also brought the conversation back around to what happened and her coma. To Harry's embarrassment, she mentioned that she'd been fading in and out for days and that she managed to catch large chunks of sounds and smells. It embarrassed Harry because he wondered if Draco was experiencing the same thing. Not to say he would mind of Draco heard what they had been saying, but he did just confess that he would be willing to eventually have a wedding to make their marriage real.
"Fine." Harry relented and hissed at the newborn. "Get off of him, Calypso."
They both knew they only had Crow's support because after the scandal leaked, Hermione and Pawk were the only people who didn't turn their backs on her, and she was desperate to save her face. They didn't speak much about it as they both knew it wasn't the most morally-sound strategy, but they also didn't care as much as they used to about morals. All they saw was progress and any obstacles would be run over.
“But sex is the best stress reliever.” He didn't want the conversation to end yet. They had honestly never had one as long as this. He considered himself lucky to have gotten this far with it, and he didn't want it to just stop now. He's found himself enjoying their conversations. He liked that he could have agreeable conversations with someone that was different from him. He was taught never to bother being civil with those under him because they were always wrong and backwards. Of course, he didn't believe that now, and seeing as Hermione was always his biggest intellectual rival, he never really believed it. But he also had never bothered to be civil with anyone who wasn't a pureblood Slytherin.
Dean shrugged, “I don’t know. I guess I never thought it was important, and it never really came up before.” He paused a moment, going back to Seamus’s previous question, “I think I’d like a nice lad. Shorter than me, sandy hair, blueish-green eyes. I like short hair too, but not too short. I also like a few freckles and a little cleft chin, adorable. Actually, I really like freckles. They’re so cute. I think I have a thing for Irish accents too.” Like Seamus, he was a bit worried that he was being too obvious.
Draco agreed with Hermione as everyone else had covered some of the most obvious solutions.
Draco was unworthy of such an oblation and he knew it. It wasn’t about him, it was about Harry. The raised hips were no offering, but a command that Draco eagerly obeyed. He served Harry, worshipped his flesh, and begged with his fingers that he may be blessed.
Harry felt his heart picking up and his chest felt light and happy from getting to wear Draco’s clothes. Something about it being Draco’s made it feel warmer, and he also enjoyed the scent on the jumper. Meanwhile, Draco swelled with pride knowing that everyone would see it was his clothes on Harry, which adorably swallowed Harry due to their height difference.
While Teddy was sleeping, Harry and Andromeda talked a little while longer.
"Oh no! Merlin, no! I don't fancy him, I've just ..... I've realized that he isn't as ugly as I once thought." Truthfully, Harry didn't have an ugly bone in his body. Everything about him was attractive, regardless of personal tastes. Draco, however, was aware of his own awkward face and height. He knew he was an acquired taste and often compared himself to fine wine. Unfortunately, it seemed the only people with a true taste for his looks were girls only after his money. Never fine men.
He cringed a bit, but smiled. “It was once. Don’t say it like I do that all the time, people will think I’m creepy.”
Harry only shrugged at that. “I look like pleasure. It wasn’t an accident and I like it.”
“Harry! I thought we agreed you weren’t going to overwork yourself and you were going to relax during the break. There’s still four days left.” Draco sighed, “I already threatened you with magic, but you didn’t listen.” He reached for his wand. He hoped it would be enough to compel Harry into stopping because he didn't actually have a plan. He was hoping intimidation would be enough.
Even if it killed her.
“Draco, that’s wonderful!” Blaise exclaimed upon seeing what remained of the mark. “Just in time for the start of spring. I bet the ink will be gone by next month.” He said as he looked over the area. “Maybe you’ll be left with a cool scar like your little boyfriend. Or, perhaps, the scar will fade too and you’ll have a clean slate.”
The article was perfect. It painted Lucius for the vengeful and obsessive man that he was, while showing Narcissa as being a victim who was unable to stop her husband. But it wasn't all pretty. It also showed how wary they were of each other in the beginning, how stressful it was to walk on eggshells all the time. Their fight was written as a thing to be celebrated, a thing that set them free. It pushed them to at least be friends. They each had their stories of how they fell for each other. It was their favorite part because they both loved the way they seemed to have chosen love.
“But love, you look so magnificent. Do it again.”
She looked out the window and saw that the snow had stopped. Even so, they were dressed for the winter weather. "Want to go look around, then? You might fine something."
Greenwood?" Draco was almost in disbelief.
“Draco, we have five minutes.” Harry called out, trying to get Draco to understand how little time they had.
“Want me to teach you how?” He offered.
He was drunk on sleep. He reached up and wrapped an arm around Draco’s waist. He rolled over and brought Draco beside him without even thinking. “Shut the hell up and sleep, Draco.”
Harry hesitated and then entered, still unsure of how to go about his request. “Yes?”
“Then let’s do it.”
"And I still don't like dirt."
“They’re charmed. When you purchase one it shrinks and you can stick it in your pocket.”
Harry cracked a smile, shaking his head and going back to his book. He just hit the H’s and he was reading up on Harpies. They were much more terrifying than he expected.
Oh god I can’t believe I’m finished. Don’t really know what I’m suppose to do with myself now that my fic is done, lol. I hope you all enjoyed it!
Draco did a double take before sitting up in his chair. "Are you actually unaware of how good-looking you are?" He sounded just a bit outraged.
After waking up from his nap, Draco was delighted to see Harry was shirtless and covered in mud. He let out a laugh and tilted his head, “Enjoy getting your arse kicked, Potter?”
The moment Harry was given permission, he lost it. He thrusted wildly into Draco, craving the pleasure it gave him. He began to cry out and he felt himself starting to leak. His free hand trailed back to grip Draco’s arse, digging his fingers in and playing with it’s soft roundness.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Heathen.”
Harry threw out a few answers as he went along. “I’m well, the Ministry is well, The Cupboard Project is well, Ron and Hermione are doing well, and the lawsuit went well.” With that, most of them were discouraged and went to hunt down others going in and out of the Ministry. Some still asked some questions; wanting details. He gave a few but didn’t mention that Daniel Greenwood is the lawyer responsible for the department. He didn’t want that released yet. He needed just a bit more time to get everything together before he was ready for that information to be out.
Of all things, Alex ended up giving the story of Garren to a gossip column. For as excited as they once were to bruise the man's ego, the story almost felt beneath them. As if it was so petty and useless that they couldn't be bothered with it. It was similar to the way Hermione and Harry felt about the whole situation. For everything they've done, Garren felt like nothing.
Harry was satisfied with the explanation and went back to looking through his parent’s things. There were a few picture albums, he didn’t look through them. He’s already looked them over multiple times. He just hadn’t brought them out of the vault until now.
“Yea. Messy hair, my stubble, wearing your sweaters, my smile, my eyes, singing to the radio, playing with your hair. It’s all part of my charm.” He winked.
She nodded and continued to carefully detangle Draco's hair with her fingers. "Have you ever considered making your marriage real? Perhaps, with a ceremony or something?"
Harry let out a soft chuckle. “Why do you do that? You used to say my name so condescendingly, as if it were an insult, as if it was disgusting. But now ..... you made your old arrogance into a joke, you call me by my last name when you flirt with me, it’s .....” He trailed off once more, searching for words. “It’s incredible. Why did you do that?”
"Uh." He felt how his face heated up and shrugged, "It's just ..... it's a bit descriptive in one part, where ..... where Claus is ..... touching ..... Sebastian." He covered his face and felt absolutely stupid for the coy way he tried to describe what went on in the book.
He had a friend who worked at Witches Weekly, a magazine full of celebrity gossip, personality quizzes, recipes, fashion, advice, and just about everything a teenage girl could ask for. His friend had sent him an owl asking about Harry, specifically, his money. She wanted to know where it came from. Before he answered, he asked why she needed the information. She explained that she was writing an article on the richest wizarding families in the UK and Ireland. Harry was on the list. Draco told her that the Potter family had a history of inventing potions, getting rich off of it, and selling the company. Apparently, the bank had already told her that but she knew there was some money he was getting that wasn't on the books. He was raking in thousands of dollars each month and it wasn't from his families shares in the companies they sold. So Draco confessed that Harry also did business in the muggle economy but he gave no more details.
With that, people afflicted with lycanthropy were given full rights as members of the magical community and were removed from the list of creatures. They were also given their own department in the Ministry, which created nearly a hundred new jobs for them. It was called, “Lupin's Law”. The legal term for werewolves was also changed to, “people afflicted with lycanthropy”. By calling them werewolves, one could argue that the rights of “people” didn't belong to them, as they were not people. It was an intentional wording that allowed bigots to push their ideals into law. Now, it was undone.
Draco smirked, “But you wouldn’t know anything about that, would you?”
The hand on Harry’s lower stomach curled, digging his nails into the yielding flesh. He could feel it. He could feel something so wonderful resting just beyond his body’s borders. Something that was only growing, threatening to wash over him like a retreating tide onto the shore.
They both drifted in and out for a while before they fell into something deeper.
"Dolt." As much as he hated it, hearing Harry groan sent a wave of warmth through his lower belly.
He thought a moment longer on the way he was treated and frowned. “I was denied affection. I was never shown love. Hell, I never try to hold you because I don’t understand. I was raised without it and now I don’t get it. I don’t understand how to ask for that! It’s just so far beyond me!” Harry stared down at his lap. He meant to delve into his childhood and tell stories, but things fall apart. "It sucks because I want to hold you all the time."
Harry pulled his underwear off and looked down, embarrassed to see that he was already halfway there.
"I need to speak with Draco Malfoy."
Draco and Pansy followed him as they all searched for Harry’s friends. He grew a bit frantic as time dragged on, but they found them after a few minutes. He felt so relieved when he saw Hermione talking to Dean and looking around for them. Harry sped up and hurried to the table, taking a seat beside Ron. Draco and Pansy sat next to Harry, leaving a space between Pansy and Seamus. They all greeted Draco and Pansy as if they were old friends rather than enemies. It was a sort of warming moment and he knew that everyone at the table appreciated how welcoming the greetings were.
Draco chuckled and picked up Harry's sled. "Because I'm perfect. Now let's get you inside before you injure yourself." He carried the sleds while Harry trailed behind, occasionally shaking a bit of snow out of his clothes.
One thing Harry learned very quickly was the art of crying silently. He couldn't afford to be loud as a child. It made Draco wonder how long Harry had been crying for.
for most of it."
“Harry, you have gorgeous green eyes, messy hair that always looks like you just finished shagging, very fit body, a nice arse, you’re funny, kind, loyal, you have a good heart, you’re a damn poet, you like kids, and you saved the world. You’re just about everyone’s wet dream.”
Harry didn’t say anything at first, contemplating about how to proceed with such a confession. He might as well be honest since he’s been this open. No point in going back on it now. But he knew he should probably stop being so telling to strangers.
Especially when Draco started his unofficial apprenticeship with Madam Pomfrey, he needed a bit of homework help since he had less time to do everything. Harry would also sneak food from meals so that Draco would have something to snack on after he came back from the hospital wing.
words of affirmation. He was abused and bullied. Touch and words have never really been a positive thing for him. I think those might work best.”
Draco’s jaw dropped at the animalistic noise he heard from Harry’s room. He was leaking a bit into his own boxers but didn’t plan on going anywhere until he knew Harry was done.
Draco grinned and stood up, holding out his hand, “Yours or mine?”
"Sort of sad though," she commented, "how casual this has become. It's almost boring."
“How?”
Truthfully, neither Harry nor Draco wanted to be alone with the other. Not yet.
“No.”
Harry could practically see the worry at the Skytherin table. But rather than shaming the young girl, applause erupted in the room, even though some Ravenclaw were a bit disappointed they didn’t get another member.
Poor Dean and Seamus were completely unaware of what their friends were up to. They were laying in their dorm together, in separate beds, talking to each other. They were talking about everything under the sun. Their classes, professors, futures, and who they wanted to end up marrying. No topic was too personal for them. They were like open books to each other.
Draco chuckled and gave a smug grin. “Is my gorgeous blonde hair too distracting?”
“Yes. They also know you risked your life to save people. They also know ..... a little bit about us.” He wasn’t sure how to word it, so he went with that.
The room was silent again. This time, the silence was uncomfortable. Harry hated that. They had been doing so well. Two weeks of nothing and they had finally managed to make a joke and do something together. He couldn't let their bit of progress be ruined. He tried to think of something else to talk about, something to bring the mood back. His eyes went down to the noodles and he got an idea. “Do you know how to tell when the noodles are ready?”
“You can use me anytime.”
Harry didn’t even look up. He felt the stare and knew what it was about. “Draco is my husband.”
“I guess we are.” He smiled. “Took us long enough.”
Draco wanted to make things better, but he hardly knew how. "This isn't something you can bounce back from with a few months of self-care. I know you've been trying, and I think that's wonderful, but you can't fix everything. That just isn't realistic. Some things might go away today, others in ten years, some things are here to stay, but it will get easier. You spent years in that house, it'll take time." He thought a moment and tried to make a suggestion. "Would you like to drink wine and eat chocolate?"
After eating, they gathered their presents for Teddy and took off to see him.
“Me too.” Seamus agreed.
He smiled and said, “I married a Slytherin who insisted on using the ring as a way to brand me. Cheeky bastard. It was a spring wedding in a little garden, quite lovely.”
With permission, he also revealed Seamus had been editing his books. Besides work, the two had become good friends. So much so that Draco found himself standing as Seamus’ best man, when he and Dean finally tied that knot.
He obeyed and he found himself shifting his legs around so he was laying on his stomach, facing Draco. He decided he had to taste Draco.
He looked up to see pieces of parchment being shoved in his face. A small smile played onto his face and he tilted his head. "Really? Watch the food for me and let me read it, then." He took the papers and leaned against the counter while Draco watched him, instead of the food.
“I love you too, dad.”
He knew that outing their relationship could have dire consequences but he didn't care. All he cared about was Draco. Once he was back by Draco's side, Narcissa was the only one still there. They shot each other friendly looks that were laced with concern. Neither were up for conversation. While he was by Draco's side, nothing mattered. Even the pounding in his head seemed to dull and his eyes didn't droop as much. But when he returned home with the parting promise of making something for he and Narcissa to eat, knowing she had gone just as long as he had, everything was terrible. He worried about Draco and about their outed relationship, his head killed him, his eyes drooped, and he could hardly focus on anything. His mind slowly blanked and he frowned to himself. He'd rather be filled with racing thoughts than have his mind overcome by something worse than sleep. It was a tiredness that didn't effect his body, but only his mind. He absolutely loathed it.
They were a pair of earrings that Andromeda once loved very dearly, but had to pawn away at one point when times got tough. They had been given to her by her late husband for their fifth anniversary.
McGonagall raised an eyebrow at him. “Technically I’m not your Headmistress anymore.”
All that was left was the forty Year 7 students that remained.
Draco pulled away for a moment and Harry was left hyperaware of his hole. He could feel it was different. It was warm, wet, and relaxed. Draco had licked him open and he was overcome with the feeling that he needed to be filled.
The nails that dug into him soften to fingertips. He wasn’t dug in to, he wasn’t gripped, he was held. His arm slowly crumpled under him and he laid on Draco’s chest, hardly able to hold himself up. He let out a series of grunts. They were strangely soft and desperate, almost hums. He chanted out the noise as he got closer and closer, incapable of words.
“Cold. It’s so fucking cold. I’ve been wearing jumpers for two weeks straight.”
Harry saw something in Draco's face, but he wasn't sure what it was. He spent a moment taking in the other's face as he tried to figure it out. Truthfully, he always thought the blonde's face to be a bit awkward. His jaw was a bit soft and gave him the profile of a half-moon, his nose ended a bit too far from his lips and the sharpness of it didn't fit quite right with softness of the rest of his face. He noticed how puffy Draco's lips were, how unnaturally round his eyes, and the way his eyebrows were darker than the hair on his head and had no shape other than being bushy lines. He tried not to stare too long and found himself looking away, trying to put his mind to something else.
When finished Harry and stepped out, Draco couldn't look away. He had his pajama pants on but not a shirt. Small and soft muscles, dark stubble, adorable glasses, wild hair still dripping onto his body. Ah yes, he forgot Harry was a sexy beast. But he was so innocent too. Harry was a walking paradox and it was killing Draco.
Harry's place?”
The Auror almost looked nervous. “He’s a key witness to the crime. We have to get his account of what happened. But, given his past with Draco and the recent media rumors surrounding them, we also have to clear him as a suspect before Wizengamot.”
“I’m gonna hex you.” Harry mumbled as he finally pulled a shirt on.
Molly gave a sad smile. “There you go, always worrying about someone else instead of yourself.” She pressed a kiss to the top of his head as she held him close. “Try to make the best of it, Harry. I know you want to befriend him, and I think a friend is what he could use right now.”
Harry let out a soft grunt and found himself shifting his hips under his skin, his body warming up to the electric pleasure that erupted from somewhere new.
“Just like that. Now, up and down. Please.”
Harry laid there a moment before he realized what was wrong. Draco was a horny slut, but not enough that he would suggest such filthy things. Harry looked over at Draco with suspicious eyes. “You’re hard, aren’t you?”
Harry rolled his eyes, but it was late, and he was slightly delusional, so he gave in. “Ugh, fine. Since you’re just dying to know.”
While they were getting their plates, Draco noticed Harry giving him a bewildered expression. He furrowed his eyebrows, “What?”
It was so much more difficult than he expected.
“Cedric, Cho, and Ginny, obviously. The Ravenclaw girl from second year, Neville, and you.”
“Apparently.” She scoffed, “The nerve of that man. Sometimes I can’t believe I married him. He really only did it for my money. I knew it but I still fell for him. You must think me a fool.”
He'll never forget the day that he, a fifteen year old, came along to his parents and told them he was gay. They were fine with it, but that night his father asked him over and over if he was certain that he
“Neville?”
“I don’t feel like I owe you, Harry, I’m just pulling any excuse I can to suck your dick! I really want to.” Draco explained.
Draco nodded, taking it all in. Part of him was honored. Harry, it seemed, wanted to get better for him. He wanted to get better so they could be together. But there was a dull ache in his heart from their inability to be together now, though he was hopeful that they would be, one day. He took a shaky breath and gave a small nod, "I can wait, Harry. It's okay."
“Right. Then, if everyone is satisfied with the arrangement at hand, I need the betrothed to sign.”
