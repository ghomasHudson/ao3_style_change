The girl laughed, tossing her hair aside. "I could say the same about you ... Don't worry, I was waiting for someone."
In the living room, while waiting for her juice, Luna tried to think of what to do, looking discouraged inside the backpack, until the colored circles caught her attention and she had an idea. Quickly unfolding the packing, making Neville move the coffee table away and setting up the plastic piece on the carpet, she announced excitedly:
“Hmm…?”  Harry did not answer, confused, not knowing how to explain the origin of the man without being instantly placed in a sanatorium.
To Harry's surprise, in a few seconds, the boy was clinging to the wolf's neck, his hair held up by licks in a wet mohawk.
However, after everything, returning to innocence seemed impossible, mainly because of the clear vacant places, in the boats, and in the hearts, that would be punctuated in that crossing.
Vampires were great liars and seducers and tried to gain the sympathy and trust of their victims before approaching. Probably. Harry wouldn't let that last part prove itself. He walked to the windows and grabbed the curtains.
"Fine. I said that. And that he is stubborn as fuck. And he makes all of this SO harder than it could be, because he doesn't want me there, but he also doesn't have the LEAST sense of self-preservation. In one second he is complaining that he does not need protection and blah blah blah, in the next second he is playing in front of a fucking car!"
“Two to one. What can I do? We are testing a new keeper. But I was the one who scored the point. Is there beer in the fridge?”
The brunette stood on tiptoe to brush the older man's lips with his own, pulling his lower lip with his teeth as he pulled away. Draco's hands went to his hips, but in a spasm of consciousness, he stepped away, taking a step back. Harry took a step forward.
Harry Potter froze under the touch, not knowing how to breathe again. His heart accelerating to alarming levels. Until Luna's soothing touch on his forearm brought him back to reality.
He did not want to attend the party for several reasons. First, because he didn't like dances. Second, because he knew that his presence would draw too much attention and this celebration was not about him, besides feeling too depressed when looking at the place and feeling the stark absence of many who should be there and could not. Finally, he could say that he preferred to stay and keep Draco company, who had prevented him from trying to change the date of the party, which took place during a full moon. But, it would all be a lie. The truth was that graduating meant saying goodbye. To Hogwarts, to the only place he had ever called home. And he was not ready to move on. Not yet.
"What are you talking about?" Asked the brunette, kissing him back. "He brought you to me. This is the best cupid in the world."
The brunette had to control the urge to throw the remote control against the glass. With all the stability he could muster, he walked stiffly to the window.
Finally, despite his humor and style, Draco didn't like horror movies. Quite the opposite. He thought everyone was too artificial and exaggerated. He liked romantic comedies. THAT, NO POTTER, ARE NOT EXAGGERATED, GODS, YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE. Harry had slept in the middle of one of them on Tuesday, and when he woke up, he blushed, realizing that he had been carried to bed again, this time, without notes.
“I beg forgiveness, my Lord. I was ignorant and failed in my duties to you.” He kissed the hem once more.
He forced his magic into those places to fight against the magic that was Voldemort's. Slowly but surely, it began to recede. He chased it all the way to Lucius' left arm.
. You years of spying, your dedication to Harry, helping him and saving him, and caring for him… Thank you.”
“I am not a lenient man, Ssseverusss,” the Dark lord hissed, drawing his wand once more. “If your posssition asss my ssspy hasss been compromisssed, then you are of no ussse to me. Avada-!”
Shrieks rang out in the chamber, echoing off the stone walls around him. He ended the curse abruptly as he faltered and stumbled to his knees. A Death Eater moved forward to help his master off the ground. He was cursed for his actions. As the Dark Lord took to pacing again, he kept muttering about ‘that stupid Potter brat’ and ‘that cursed old bat Dumbledore’. It was a sign of how intense his anger was that the Death Eaters could understand him; he was speaking English.
As he was about to take his first bite, someone called out, “Hey Harry, show us how you see!” There were several answering murmurs in agreement.
“That’s not what I was asking. You love him? Is it a love match, or is it for the survival of yourself and now your child?”
“Oh, sweet Merlin. Please tell me that didn't happen. Please, Draco! Tell me I did not tell all our family and friends about our sex life. Tell me that you did not clarify the details of our sex life.”
Over the next month or so, Harry began to trust his environment more and more. He allowed Draco to wander around the rooms they were living in with Snape on his own, as long as he didn’t leave them. He allowed Snape, Pomfrey, McGonagall, and Dumbledore to give Draco foods and potions without testing them first. Occasionally he would, just to be sure, but it wasn’t every time like it had been at first. He began sleeping at night with Draco, truly sleeping. When Snape or Pomfrey would run tests on Draco, he didn’t fight them like he did at first.
For the next month, Harry had a slight impression that the Slytherin was avoiding him. Maybe because the blonde avoided being in the same environment as him. Or because he walked in the opposite direction every time the Gryffindor approached. Or the times he had shouted, "Stop following me, Potter!". Or because he had hexed him with furnunculus in the face the time Harry had disobeyed the advice.
"Look that!"  He exclaimed, but instead of throwing, he pointed the stick horizontally. "Avada Kedavra!"
In the original version, the wolfsbane potion needs to be taken strictly for a week until the full moon and allows the werewolf to maintain consciousness during the transformation. In my version, in addition to taking it only once, the werewolf performs a complete transformation, without stopping at the painful middle ground between wolf and man, does not acquire consciousness (or at least acquires the state of consciousness of a dog) nor has the memory of the transformation. Draco is a lovely little giant white wolf, who likes to chase things and pets in his tummy;
The man looked at him offended, with no intention of leaving, fleeing t9he entrance. In fact, almost playing hopscotch, running away from all the cracks and windows through which the sun's rays infiltrated, slowly warming the wooden floor.
“Protect from what?” He said back, wondering if "protecting" involved continuing to walk on the roof of his house during the night.
Harry carefully took the warm ball in his palm. Last week it had been a sparrow and two days earlier a squirrel. Hermione's cat had serious problems when it came to bringing dead animals home. That was why he had been forced to keep the cat. Her boyfriend, and their best friend, had refused to accept the cat since his pet mouse had disappeared - BEEN BRUTALLY MURDERED HERMIONE - while they were at school. Harry held the little thing firmly against his chest as he advanced towards the kitchen, where the light was better.
“Great. Bring me coffee. I like my coffee black, like my soul.” and laughed, leaving the brunette bewildered, fleeing behind the counter.
“Mimbulus Mimbletonia” Corrected Neville “It is a rare species of cactus. I already told you about it. In the end, I had to take her home. This morning I put the poor thing in the sun to make her feel better and…”
>Teorically, a vampire could live off a person's "donation" from small amounts from time to time, but few people know that vampires exist and even less trust them (it is also very difficult for a vampire to force himself to stop)
Harry stood in silence. He hadn't heard the man going around the side of the house and lean against the window, until he heard his voice and without an answer, it was impossible, without opening the curtains, to know if he was still standing there listening to his movements, trying to know what he was going to do.
Pansy put her arm around Ginny's shoulder and held up her middle finger. Ginny laughed. The redhead's ears were almost the color of his hair, but, Hermione stepped in front of him, pointing to the sofa, on the opposite side of the room, where they were sitting earlier.
Harry sighed, turning his chair around and sitting back with it facing the opposit side, his face resting on it's back "I know this is not the best moment of your life, of all of us actually. But I also know that it is not easy to be a werewolf, let alone go through it alone. Maybe I'm not the person you want to see in front of you right now, but, maybe I'm the person you need. So what do you tell me? Can you at least give it a try?"
As a matter of fact, Harry Potter didn't like cats very much. He was the type who preferred dogs. But he liked Hermione, and after his skin had been saved by her so many times, it was simply impossible to deny taking care of the cat while his friend was taking a vacation course.
“Hey.” The brunette almost fell backward, when the blonde's face suddenly appeared, as always, upside down, in the window. “I can hear you. You don’t need to do that”.
In a matter of a few minutes and the strange feeling of being watched came again. With the corner of his eyes, he saw a pair of green eyes peering through the circular opening that decorated the door. He waved for the brunette to come in.
Draco followed him up the stairs. He looked at the walls as if they were old friends and told him funny stories. Draco didn't complain when he made him sit beside him on the dusty floor.
He rubbed his hands together and picked up the small pile of paper on his desk, gathering the leaves and tapping them on the wood so that they were aligned and gazed, in awe, at the first assignment in his life that he had not done at the last minute. This time, he really needed the extra credit and, unfortunately, Professor Snape, also known as the strictest professor at his college, did not like him at all and would not accept a half-ass job. Not even Hermione, who had had a subject with him the previous year, had been able to finish with perfect grades, so the brunette knew he needed to write the best report of his life if he wanted to stay at least average.
"Potter! By Merlin's beard, I don't know how I came to agree with such a stupid idea ... Potter! Get out of there! You will die!"
"Did Granger do it? " Draco asked, scraping his tongue with his teeth to try to get the taste out of his mouth.
They both turned in the direction Harry was facing, where a melancholic Draco Malfoy was playing with his dinner, across the room, at the Slytherin table.
>In this case, Draco hasn't been out hunting since he met Harry and ate for the last time at the party. Considering that a "fresh cup" of blood is not a very large amount, it was enough for a few days
“Hmmmmmmmmm!” Dean and Ron made together as kindergarten boys, drawing the attention of the other tables in the small restaurant, which turned to face them.
Harry shook his head in agreement. In his mind, he said “So that's it. Goodbye ”and closed the door, but that’s not what came out of his mouth and he didn’t know why, but he would probably regret it later.
Draco rolled his eyes. " About Lupin. Are you using me as a way to deal with his death? Am I like the new project of the great hero of the wizarding world?"
The redhead nodded, not looking the least bit at ease in knowing that the candies had not been found on the floor or anything.
Luna and Neville exchanged a look and then shook their heads in approval. Harry frowned, disoriented by the situation.
And it didn't extend to your friends either, right? Well, if it wasn't something so simple that it could be resolved intentionally by the brunette throwing himself in front of a car, it probably wasn't the case, was it? And he had said he was going to come back… Harry decided that taking care of someone drunk didn't count on saving his life. But he didn't want to think about it too much. He wanted to have hot cocoa.
At some point, everyone's socks were gone, Ronald's freckled chest was taking a breath and Simas had decided to make the game a booze game and make everyone's balance a lot worse. Harry had decided not to participate. The alcohol made his mind a little foggy and he couldn't afford to be even minimally out of his senses and reflexes when his life and everyone else's was in danger. "Couldn't" in the past, because he quickly changed his mind when it was the blond's turn to put one foot in the red and lose his shirt and Harry realized that he couldn't look away from the thin line of hair that came down from the navel and got lost where dark pants started and he was forced to turn a shot to pay attention to something else.
Sorry for the delay guys. I lost this chapter two times because of computer errors and was so fucking pissed I gave up trying to write it for a week each time it happened. So, here it is.
Draco blinked, coming out of his stupor. He looked over his shoulder. Harry Potter was sitting on the bed, completely naked - except for the round glasses he never took off - showing a half-smile. Faster than the brunette expected, the Slytherin practically threw himself on him, pushing his body over the bed.
>They prefer to consume the blood of young and/or healthy people, which have a higher nutritional value and can keep them for longer
"If you have been approved for your potions N.O.M.S. that would prove you able to go to the advanced level ... Although I still think that Dumbledore pulled the strings to keep you in the class ..."
“Hello, Draco!” Ginny and Neville chanted it together, like children welcoming the new student into the kindergarten class.
In the middle of the sofa, without socks, legs thrown over the pillows, the brunette's head resting on the blonde's shoulder, for the first time returning to sit as close as they had sat at Harry's friends' short visit when the blonde was struggling much to purposely make him as uncomfortable as possible, just because he had been vampirophobic.
From under the table, where he played with the remnants of the paper bag that Ron had left behind, the cat meowed offended.
Ronald sat in an armchair with his legs curled up against his chest, looking at the blonde suspiciously. “What kind of name is Draco? Are you one of those guys who pretend to be a vampire or something?”
A meow alerted him in the other room. Harry ran back in, brandishing his broom like a sword, but found it empty. On the stairs, a man and a cat were surprised.
Harry felt it would be kind of stupid to answer the cat again, but he answered anyway. In the middle of the kitchen table, under his fluffy little paws, was a sheet of paper.
The blonde rolled his eyes. “Again, Harry... I can call you Harry, right? You are being very offensive.”
Harry almost spit out the piece of cold cheese. The man was at his window ON THE SECOND FLOOR AND UPSIDE DOWN. It was not possible that Harry had not heard him climb the wall and walk on its roof. How had he come up at last ??
"So ... What's going on down there? "Draco blushed, looking away making Harry laugh. "Do you feel horny when I piss you off?"
Harry blushed, remembering his pathetic attempt to throw himself in front of a car and how stupid it looked now. He vaguely remembered being lifted and thrown over Draco's shoulder, wondering if that was how a sack of potatoes felt until he saw Ron rushing past them screaming and covering his lower parts, running back home and being taken out of that thought by a wave of giggles. He remembered Draco's angry look, pressing him on the floor, his red irises glowing in the dark and the feeling when he approached his face and ... Harry didn't want to think about it.
Draco turned the contents over at one shot. Harry laughed with the face that the blonde did. He knew that the taste was unpalatable and could not be improved in any way as it would detract from the potion's effectiveness. Good. If it tasted so bad, it must be all right.
At the moment, Harry didn't try to reason whether that was a double-meaning comment or not. For the first time, full of curiosity, he took the courage to run his hand over the side of the vampire's face, outlining his mouth with his thumb. Everything was soft but unnaturally cold. Weird. He wanted to kiss that again.
The blonde's hand gripped his tightly. Harry realized with despair that he just couldn't move under the grip, let alone get rid of him.
There was no way to get back to normal with a vampire perched on his roof every night, showing up at his windows, following him to work… Oh my God. What if he decided to follow him to college? No. No. No. He had to get rid of him. Just find out how this life debt thing worked and then…
"I don't know Hermione! I guess? I do not know. I think I'm getting used to his presence and it would be kind of weird if he disappeared out of the blue. And deep down I feel that it's not just because of that either, but at the same time I think it is and I feel stupid and ... Aaah!"
Harry turned to the blond, who wore a long-sleeved black blouse - no surprises here -  but open at the shoulders and back, with the strips of fabric forming a pentagram. The man laughed at him, tapping the collar with the tip of his index finger.
"But this is dangerous" you must be thinking. Do not worry. He had a pepper spray and had taken a two-month self-defense course once. Besides, three in the morning was the best time to run. The streets were empty, that is, there was no one to judge him. The night was cool and the stars dotted the sky 18% of the time when it was not raining.
"And he has that magical world view, that good always wins over evil and blah blah blah and it's unbearable. And I just want to punch him in the mouth. With my mouth. Softly. Because he is so cute it makes me want to die."
He went to the bathroom to splash water on his face, Crookshanks, as always, behind him, his brush tail raised, whipping the air.
Uncle Harry, who was actually his godfather, but it was easier to call everyone uncle, was a very brave man. Everyone respected him a lot because he had survived an evil spell when he was just a baby and therefore had a lightning scar on his forehead. There was also the possibility that he hit his head somewhere and invented that part of the story to impress him, but there was no problem. He had also defeated the snake-faced man alone and won the wizarding war.
"But making an assumption. If I wanted you to do something for me, who would have to find it important enough, is it me or you?"
"I already apologized! And look at Longbottom's face! He is big enough to stand for himself." Spat Pansy Panrkinson, pointing at Neville who was trying to sink into the seat so as not to be noticed. "He is clearly don't giving a shit for what you are talking about!"
Harry adjusted his seat belt, which was hurting his neck. He let out a loud breath when big white paws stepped on his thigh. Harry opened the glass of the taxi, allowing the dog to stick his head out the window, sitting half on his lap, as he was too big to do so, but he insisted on trying anyway. The taxi driver continued to start a conversation, telling about his life. Maybe because of time, he needed to do it to stay awake. Perhaps due to a lack of attention. Harry didn't care in any way.
Draco blinked slowly. With his left hand, he covered his face. The first rays of the sun appeared on the horizon, piercing his eyes with the sudden light. Strangely, the grass was too soft this morning ...
"Theoretically, that you met this apparently Satanist guy at the cafe and the next day invited him to your house to mentally wash all your friends and luckily you still haven't lost a kidney in the process. So, knowing Ron Weasley, I suppose I don't know anything." Hermione laughed.
Everyone seemed to find the explanation plausible, staring at Ronald to see his reaction. The redhead just nodded, extending his hand for a greeting: a firm handshake, to show dominance, which didn't quite work out, feeling his fingers almost being crushed back, even though the blond didn't seem to be making the least effort.
A tall presence loomed behind him. Harry looked over his shoulder to see, pleased, Draco Malfoy standing behind him with his arms crossed.
Harry got startled, interrupting his way to the place next to his friend to observe the black-haired Gryffindor whose name he had apparently forgotten. In fact, he wasn't too concerned with looking at her, since a certain person was making his way through the Great Hall to the Slytherin table, about to pass a few feet from him with Pansy Parkinson by his side.
And then? Well, he kind of ran home to make sure he got there before it started to get dark and he lost the protection of the mantle of the sun. He had already been forced to make three different excuses for his group of friends about why he couldn't go out at night this time.
“Come here. I will introduce you to everyone.” Luna smiled, pulling the man by the hand towards the corridor.
Teddy felt his eyes tear up. But, he was already big. He wasn't going to cry. They could go to the park another day, even if he had to wait to hear Uncle Draco's secretive secret...
"Oi. "Ronald greeted with his mouth full and his hand tucked into a brown paper bag. "The cat stole it from you?" He said, pointing to the candies in his hand.
Youngest seeker of the century in the first (and rumors that he would have killed Professor Quirrel with his bare hands, but that part was probably just rumoring);
Harry snorted, crossing his arms and turning his head in another direction. "Sorry if I wanted to make sure that you would not feel obligated to go out with me."
"Hello! My name is Potter, Harry Potter!" The Gryffindor stood up suddenly, with his hand outstretched. " Do you want to be my friend?"
"No. And don't blame me, until yesterday you would prefer to throw yourself in front of a car over my presence."
To Draco's amazement, the murderous tree stopped trying to attack, returning to its initial position and remaining immobile from there. "How did you ...?"
If anyone is wondering, Draco's family has a blood bank. He didn't leave in five minutes, killed an elderly man, filled his cup with fresh blood, and came back. He just carries it around, because hydrating is important.
Teddy was not scared and needed no explanation. He knew, somehow, he knew that that in front of him was a werewolf, perhaps not in the way he had imagined, but, a werewolf, like his father. Something he didn't understand made his eyes water. He smiled.
Also apparently, Snowball was even happier than Teddy, having a new play partner, with more spirits than Harry. The brunette smiled when he saw his godson and boyfriend playing together. Snowball even let the boy ride on his back like a small, furry little horse, until he jumped through the bushes and disappeared into the woods between barking and childish giggles.
Harry could just watch from the window a very strange conversation, listening to lose parts like “Stop pretending you need help if you are going to hunt people who want to help you! It's very slutty! ” and "Those pants look awful on you!" And then the vampire came back as if nothing had happened.
"That was the worst way anyone has ever asked me out in my life. And I am over two hundred years old."
He stood up, disoriented. Or at least tried, because something stuck around his neck wouldn't allow it. He angrily watched the pink leather ribbon, which connected his body to Potter's wrist, on which, at the moment, he was sleeping.
On Thursday, Harry chose the film. He looked for something that was more comedy and less romance, something that he could at least watch without sleeping. He waited - he wouldn't admit he was anxious, but he was - for the blonde to appear. He took a while this time. And when he arrived, he didn't look very excited.
Harry pulled away to force the blonde to get up and fight him. He was experienced enough to know how much of a provocation Draco Malfoy could take without fighting back. In the next instant, his back was against the wall, and the blonde's hand was splayed beside his head. Draco had the same irritated look as Hermione. Harry had been dealing with that kind of look for eight years and it still wasn't less terrifying.
Teddy got out of his chair. He knew that the chair was his own, because it had a stack of beautiful pillows on top, for him to get taller and because he and Uncle Draco had painted his name on the back so that everyone would know too. Uncle Draco was Uncle Harry's husband. He had a crazy lab on the top floor. Sometimes he taught Teddy to mix gooey things and create liquids with shiny mixes. Once, he and Uncle Draco had made a blue potion and put it in Uncle Harry's coffee and he had been sobbing soap bubbles for a week. Teddy never noticed when it happened, but his hair always changed to blond when he was around him.
Ron sat on the grass. He knew he had asked a question that would not get an answer. There was no one to take the attention that the furball was receiving from his friend now. But, okay, if his friend was happy.
Waiting until they were calm and cooled once more, Harry motioned for Draco to talk about them, about what was going on between them at that time. Knowing he wasn’t asking about Granger and Weasley, Draco thought for a moment about what else they’d talked about that day: their wedding. “Marriage? You want to talk about our wedding?” Harry nodded in answer. “Okay. Well, Severus said it had to be silent-” Harry cut him off and mentioned the second wedding. “Second? I don’t understand.” Motioning, trying to get Draco to understand. “You… you want to have a second wedding? So that I can have all the things I want? Oh Harry!” He threw his arms around his beloved and cried happily into his neck, despite his two-and-a-half-month belly.
Molly was dead set on cooking for the event; Narcissa was adamant about hosting it on Malfoy grounds, if safety allowed for it. Every detail was hashed out between the two women with the occasional input from Draco. Honestly, as much as he’d cared during the discussion of their wedding, he was less interested this time around. Maybe that would change after It was born. Right then, he was just lamenting his size and inability to move.
“No, Lucius. What do you know of Severus at this very moment?” He gestured to the prone form of the professor, hoping the blonde would have an answer the matron did not.
Harry smiled at his husband, happy that he made him happy. He’d thought about naming their child James or Lily for all of two seconds. But that wouldn’t be fair to It, trying to live up to an impossible standard. The idea of naming someone after someone else just seemed to dimmish that person’s worth in Harry’s mind. Like he was trying to replace someone by naming his child after them. They did consider the middle names, as that was less of an issue to Harry. Instead, they’d gone with ancient Black family names from those relatives who weren’t Dark. Reviving a happier period of time.
The unmistakable tensing in Harry’s back and shoulders and the clenching of Draco’s hand a little tighter did not go unseen by Poppy. She kept her movements slow, with just the right amount of noise. “Good afternoon, Harry,” she greeted. “I was wondering if we could talk?” She received a curious and slightly amused look for an answer. “Oh yes, I realize that you can’t actually talk. I can get you a Quick Quote Quill, which writes based on your thoughts. Would you mind that?”
“Well, that’s a simple answer,” Theresa said. Three pairs of eyes shifted to her; they’d forgotten about her. “Yes, I still exist. Blaise and Harry were married in a simple ceremony where the bondsman was silenced on pain of death from
Blaise’s jaw dropped. “You self-absorbent, self-righteous, downright arrogant prick! Do you know the shit you put Harry through?!”
With that, he slammed the nursery door in Harry’s face. The sounds of Draco instructing new paint colors on the walls and a rearrangement of the plushies could be heard. Harry wandered back into the living room where Severus was reading
“Ssseverusss! Why have I not been informed of Potter and Malfoy’sss abcensssesss from Hogwartsss when you are right there to keep an eye on thingsss for me? Isss that not your posssition asss my ssspy?”
as quickly as possible. They were lucky to have caught several major Death Eaters like Dolohov, Greyback, and the Lestrange brothers. The full Wizengamot had already been recalled to oversee all the trials.
Lucius immediately went silent. He was still struggling, still in immense pain. But that one word, that one whisper, silenced all sounds he could possibly make. His heir, his son, his
“Actually, I agree with Potter,” Snape said, shocking both of them. “Granger and Weasley have been hounding us for information for the last couple of months. When they burst into Albus’ office when the two of you were there, I thought for sure our cover was blown. Maybe we can allow the two of you to talk to them. Tomorrow. And on one condition.”
“No, you stand over there by Harry’s head. That way you’re out of my way but still close enough for him to see you. I want both of you to do exactly as I tell you to exactly when I tell you to. Kipper!” The small house elf appeared. “I am going to need lots of warm water and towels. Do you think you could get that for me and place them on the table I’ll have set up by the time you get back?”
“Draco, we’ve been over this. Childbirth is a process. To mess with the process invites complications. The child will tell us when they are ready. With women and with men carriers, that ready moment is revealed through contractions. As you get closer and closer to five minutes, you’ll feel an urge to push. That tells me it’s time to act. If you were a woman, we’d begin the true labor process. Since you’re a man, I’ll get ready to retrieve the child myself. No worries! You’re not my first. Certainly won’t be my last. Oh! How long between those two now?”
Teddy felt a hot, wet breath behind him. He turned in fright, facing the icy snout of an animal at least three times its size. He raised both hands to his mouth in amazement.
In the next few days, Draco would try even harder to outwit Harry Potter. But if there was one thing those damned Gryffindors knew -in addition to being crude, ignorant, and irritating- it was being insistent.
When he found himself, Draco was on the floor. Hands on the rug, head up. He blinked in confusion. He looked at the brunette, a little disoriented. Harry Potter had the chain wrapped around his wrist and a malicious smile.
“Delighted to meet you.” Draco smiled, taking it between his fingers and turning her wrist so he could place a kiss on the back of her hand.
Draco rolled his eyes. "That's not funny, Potter. Am I a joke to you? I'm not your pet and I don't want you to treat me like that!"
"I SAID-" Louder this time. "That we all here now! Draco! What the hell! You are not paying attention!"
>All vampires have this characteristic of red eyes, which, like fangs, can voluntarily be shown and hidden, but they will lose control in situations of instability (mainly hunger) and strong emotions (mainly desire and anger)
Meanwhile, Harry sat in silence, not knowing where to put his face and not understanding how the vampire had gotten into that situation so easily and his friends found it completely normal. The brunette was sure that if the man turned into a bat right now and went flying across the room, everyone would clap.
But Ron was right. Harry would always remember this birthday. Apparently he said something aloud because Draco responded with, “Oh, the night's not over yet, Harry.” The look he gave the ex-Gryffindor was smouldering enough to light the room afire. And Harry wasn't the only one who noticed.
“Let the record show that the paternity test I will soon administer will verify these statements as 100% truth in addition to the Veratiserum statements. Harry, did you give birth to McKay?”
With a sigh and a nod, Poppy began her work. It was going to take a while. The list of injuries was so long. And that was only for Draco. She was really worried about Harry; he was the one more likely to be in danger and trouble. He also seemed to be very protective of Draco. Understandable. She wished she knew what had happened to the two boys before her. She shook her head then, and got down to work. Draco’s malnutrition and dehydration were so bad, she’d have to start an intravenous drip to get him and the baby steady. Luckily she’d taken a Muggle medical course or two before she could become a qualified Medi-Witch at the school.
“Yes, Mimsy. I am getting ready for my wedding. Follow me.” Now was the only time he’d really hated having to have the house elf with him at all times. It wasn’t as though he’d never gotten dressed in front of someone before, it was that he’d only been around Harry for the last five months. Being around someone new, even a house elf, was slightly distressing for Draco. As he was brushing his hair out and securing it in the clasp, he gasped. “That’s it! I know what to do for something blue! It will be perfect!”
“Severus,” Dumbledore warned, watching as Ron cowered a bit but Hermione didn’t even flinch. “Miss Granger, what is going through your mind right now? You seem very sure of yourself right now.”
“She’s never been thanked before. I think you shocked her. Well, you just rest. I’m going to go unpack my things and begin cooking dinner. What would you like?”
!” he called back, obviously saying the last two words in a sarcastic manner. “I want nothing to do with them! They’re all the same anyways: I want to help
As Madam Pomfrey began her scans, Severus began jerking this way and that. Knowing that Pomfrey was doing all she could for her patient, he turned back to the Malfoy patriarch, once Death Eater. At first, there was nothing to suggest the same thing which had befallen Snape was having the same effect on the elder Malfoy. But after several minutes, a grimace appeared on his face. The headmaster called Madam Pomfrey over quickly to see what similarities there were between the two patients, but she gave a different answer altogether.
From the two mothers the couple decided to use the Malfoy crib and accompanying mobile, the Weasley bassinet and accompanying mobile, a Weasley rattle, Draco’s first baby stuffed crup, and all the baby clothes they could get. They had plenty of boy clothing from both sides, but only Ginny’s old things in case It was a girl. They were in excellent condition and super cute. As Draco went through them piece by piece, he cried over each one. They were so adorable!
Draco was sobbing, his head hanging between his arms. Only the headboard and Harry’s prick kept him raised up as he was. It had felt so good! He didn’t know why he was crying. He was so happy. When Harry tried to pull out to see what was the matter, Draco grabbed his hip to hold him still.
When he was again questioned, and threatened with Draco’s death this time, Harry would only repeat that Draco would be the cause of Voldemort’s downfall and that soon, very soon, the world would be rid of the pestilence known as ‘He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named’. Voldemort didn’t take too kindly to this and stepped up the torturing. Eventually, Harry broke through the binds that kept him in place and kicked arse. First the Death Eaters on duty fell to his wand, which was kept nearby for some unknown reason, although Harry wasn’t complaining. Then Wormtail fell and was placed in a containment spell so his mind could be filtered and Sirius proven innocent, even though he was no longer alive. Harry went in search of Voldemort then, and found Severus kneeling at his feet to ‘report on Dumbledore’.
“He more submitted to the nundu,” Draco explained. “Once he realized it was there, he tried to calm it and then just submitted to the gas to keep the nundu from attacking. Eventually, it left. Because of the poison in the gas, his eyes and vocal cords were damaged and … broke.”
Molly snapped another picture just before Draco started to groan and yell through another contraction.
Poppy sighed. “I will have to re-break it before I can heal it then. I’m sorry Harry, you know if I don’t it will only cause problems later on. What about the cut on his leg. Is that badly infected?”
That was the routine. Monday through Saturday Harry would stay in his rooms with McKay, only allowing Kipper and Theresa into his rooms when needed. On Sundays, he would join Blaise and Theresa for dinner but wouldn’t say anything while there. Then he’d beat a hasty retreat to his rooms. Blaise allowed this for some time, nearly five months, before he talked to Theresa about it. “I don’t understand why he would shut himself up like this.”
There was quiet for a few moments. “Are you okay Harry?” Blaise asked. Harry nodded quickly. “Scared?” Harry nodded again. “I’m right here, Harry,” Blaise said, taking one of Harry’s hands in his own. “I’ll be right here the entire time. I’m not going anywhere.”
After all the names had been read, and all the students had their diplomas, Dumbledore stood to say, “I am sorry to announce that one Mr. Draco Malfoy could not attend today’s festivities. His diploma has been owled to his home and we wish him luck and success in life. Congratulations Class of 1998!” While all the other graduated students cheered, hugged their friends, kissed their boyfriends or girlfriends, Harry sat in his chair with a completely white face. Blaise quickly made his way to the Gryffindor and pulled him into a hug.
“Both of you shut up!” Draco snapped, wielding Harry’s wand into silencing them both. “I will deal with you later, Father. And you, Weasley, Harry will deal with later. Get out of my room!” With a burst of magic, he warded the room from Weasley’s presence, allowing the magic to push the redhead out into his professor’s sitting room. “Father, help me into that chair there.” Stunned, the elder Malfoy did as told.
“What guarantees can you provide I won’t return to my rooms right this moment to find Potter defiling my godson?” he snarled, arms crossed as he towered over the sitting headmaster.
“And we’ll have a white table cloth with white napkins. The napkin holders will be gold for you, the silverware silver for me. Each goblet will be rimmed in green or red, depending on the house. It will be perfect! Three Gryffindors and three Slytherins. The plates will be fine china with a combination of our house crests on it. No, not the Hogwarts houses. I mean Potter and Malfoy of course. We can even have little name cards to show where everyone is to sit. Should I do whole names or just surnames? I think surnames would work perfectly. I don’t want the professors to think I’m taking liberties with their names.
“Would either of you care to inform me just what is going on?” Snape drawled, crossing his arms over his chest.
That’s when Snape understood. Draco’s instincts were telling him to protect his child at all costs. After what they’d been through in the Forest, after seeing what had happened to his father and Severus when they defected, knowing what Potter went through on a near-daily basis with the press… His child wasn’t safe. Not in a world where the Dark Lord still lived and tormented them all. He couldn’t blame the young man for wanting to protect his progeny after all of that.
The merry voice broke the pair apart, and Harry moved forward quickly to hug his best friend. “Ron, you right bastard! I can't believe you didn't say anything!”
Draco nodded. “Yes, I thought tutors might be the best option. We can work to our schedule and around It’s needs when It comes.” He looked up at his husband and they held a truly silent conversation with their eyes only. An agreement was made to look into tutors for their NEWTs once the baby had arrived and things began to settle a bit.
“Thank you Dr. Rhodes. I think that just about does it. The paternity test is sky blue, signifying that the hair I took from McKay Zabini proves that he is a male child and has read his DNA from the hair strands. I am pouring the concoction into two separate vials so that I may add a few strands of Draco Malfoy’s hair to the one on my left, and Blaise Zabini’s to the one on my right. One will turn red, and one will stay sky blue. The sky blue on will show who the biological father is. The one that turns red shows that that’s person is not the biological father. Draco, if you please?”
“Draco!” Severus shouted, rounding on his godson. “Give your father a little credit will you? He withstood the Cruciatus Curse for near five minutes when he failed to produce you or give a reasonable excuse. He is in tremendous pain, and the potion isn’t doing much for him. He was never going to give you to the Dark Lord and you know it! He asked me to keep you from that fate, from the fate he served himself. I told you this when you first returned to us. I realize this is hard for you, Draco.”
When he got to work, a few people greeted him as usual. He was in his Auror robes, and he took the elevator to the correct floor. A few more people greeted him as he made his way to his office. It had taken him a while to reach the level he was at, and he had done it without his fame. It was a hard road, but damned if he didn't have an office (not a corner office with a view, it was more like a broom closet really) with his name on the door. He was co-leader of his squad, meaning if they broke into two teams, he was in charge of one of them. Or if their head leader was out of commission for whatever reason, he took over.
“Stop!” he cried out, trying to breathe and talk and laugh at the same time. “Harry stop, stop stop stop!”
“Yes, well,” Harry said, a little miffed at being interrupted like that when all he wanted was the man of his dreams back in his life, “we hired Theresa and she did check-ups and things. Months passed, I got bigger and moodier and hungrier, but Blaise stayed with me. His mother found out the true story and was upset, but let us deal with it as we had been. When McKay was born early on December 22, I was so happy. And then I was depressed because Draco wasn’t there to see it. I locked myself in my rooms and only came out once a week for dinner Sunday nights. Otherwise I took meals in my rooms and Theresa checked on me and McKay there. After five months, Blaise had had enough.
But before a single word could be formed, Harry suddenly slumped backwards into Draco’s arms, unconscious.
Complete silence followed his outburst and revelation. No one could say anything at all. Slowly, Draco lowered himself back into his chair. Though he was not that far along in his pregnancy and he was not showing that much, he could almost feel how upset his child was with the outburst. He tried to sooth him or her with his hand on his midsection, silently thinking calming thoughts to it. His actions did not go unnoticed. Hermione had a very keen eye and quick mind. What surprised him most was Ron’s reaction.
“I don’t–” He turned toward Harry and watched as he signed something to him. “Don’t wear the mask? Don’t shut out my emotions? Don’t be what I’ve been taught to be since birth? Then what am I supposed to be, Father?” Draco was angry now, lashing out as his world was turned upside down. “What should I be, hmm? A catamite for your Lord and Master? A convenient fucktoy? Is that what you would have me be?!”
“Well, we were all really good friends during our last years in Hogwarts, mum.” Blaise mentally kicked himself. He never called his mother ‘mum’ unless he was trying to hide something. “Really, I’m okay with it.”
To help get his mind off his physical condition, Molly would often discuss Harry’s birthday party. They’d skipped over Draco’s June birthday at his insistence because he said he was too large to celebrate, that he didn’t want anyone to see him that way. Harry had been a little upset at that, both because he wanted to celebrate his husband and because he didn’t like the idea of Draco resenting their child just because it made him fat for a while. Draco had rushed to assure Harry that wasn’t the idea at all and that it was just hormones and vanity talking and that
The next morning, Harry walked passed one of the sitting rooms, still in his pajamas, and yawned loudly. “Blaise? Are you in the kitchen?” he called out. Five sets of eyes watched him pass the sitting room, one of them in amusement.
Throughout the day, things were normal. He pushed papers, had lunch with co-workers, went over reports from a raid he and his team had done last week. He spoke with Tonks about Remus, and then reminisced about the “good ol' days” when everyone was together. They didn't mention the reason everyone was together was to take out a megalomaniac trying to take over the world.
“So you want me to get Draco to go along with this plan. That’s what this is about.” Snape sighed in surrender. “And just what am I supposed to say that you haven’t already?”
“Silence, Severus. It’s not the first time and it won’t be the last. They’re probably sleeping. Draco needs his rest and Potter is still out cold.”
“Oh thank Merlin,” Snape breathed. He entered the room fully. “What seems to be the threat, Mr. Potter?”
“Would you listen for five minutes before you try to kill me?!” Snape cried, watching as his shield almost gave way. “I was sent to prepare you for your wedding. Draco is safe, in another room. It was his wish that you not see each other. No, I do not understand the language you two use to talk to each other so I have no idea what you’re saying. If it’s a sarcastic remark about you not being able to see at all, then my answer is I don’t care. Draco is dressed and almost ready to be escorted to the Great Hall. I cannot say the same of you however. Your robes are here. Draco asked that your hair be pulled back with this.” He carefully thrust the pin into Harry’s hand.
Their due date was the first week of September, something that worried Harry to no end. If Snape were in class, how would he get Madam Pomfrey to their quarters? He could easily summon her with magic like he had before when Draco had first felt the baby move. That was so invasive, however. When he brought the worry up to Draco, the blonde merely bit his lip while he thought on the matter.
The fact that Draco could use the wand as if it were his own was quite interesting as well. Sometimes another witch or wizard could use a foreign wand for this or that. He’d only heard tales of one witch or wizard using another’s wand so easily for so much as he did with Harry’s wand. It was a thought that made most magical folk ill. Their wand was their life force. The subject was as taboo as leaving random blood samples lying about. It just wasn’t done.
“Okay.” He looked at the door once more before going to his own rooms. The next day was the same, and the day after that, and the day after that. Sunday evening, Harry brought McKay down of dinner in the dining hall. “Harry, how nice to see you. That’s a weird thing to say considering we live in the same house. Would you like something to eat?” He received a nod for an answer. Harry sat where he normally would and kept McKay in his lap the whole time. When he was done, he left the dinner table and returned to his rooms. The next day, he didn’t come out.
“It’s just not fair. I’ve done everything I’m supposed to, and now it’s all wrong! It’s all useless!”
“Well, you're late to work. I've already called in for you. Your boss understands. He was at the party last night.”
In the time that Harry lay unconscious on his bed, Draco tried to come up with a future. They needed to complete schooling, that was for sure. They weren’t too far behind, thank goodness. It was only their seventh year that would need to be retaken. But with their money, private tutors wouldn’t be a problem. And his father was completely supportive of the two of them. That made things a bit easier.
“Yes yes yes!” Draco cried, hiking his leg up as much as his belly would allow. “Do it, Harry. Eat me out. Stretch me and make me wet for you. I want to come on your tongue alone. Do it, baby. I want to feel you deep. Ah! Yes!”
“Harry? Are you awake?” Draco whispered, not daring to speak too loud in case it were a dream and he should cause himself to wake from it.
Dr. Morris looked over at the notepad. “Yep. Okay. Short story, once more. Draco and Harry were in a relationship and Harry ended up pregnant. Draco misunderstood some things, and Blaise married Harry to keep him from embarrassment from having a child out of wedlock. McKay, the child, was born and Harry became depressed. Blaise treated him to Jamaica where they found the long-lost Draco. Now they have come to terms and wish to part. Blaise and Harry that is. Draco wants to marry Harry and for McKay to take his name.”
“Fine. Let the wand decide.” He and Harry got out of bed and kneeled down on the floor beside it. Draco set Harry’s wand on the floor and gave it a spin from the middle. Just as it started to slow down, their door opened.
“I don’t know what it could be. Effects from one too many Cruciatus curses? A potion? A lingering curse? A–”
“He kept me at dinner one Sunday night and made me talk about what was bothering. We finally decided to get out of the house. I wanted to go island hopping, so we set up the appropriate portkeys and things, then went to Jamaica just two days ago. Yesterday, McKay and I were playing in the surf while Theresa was sun bathing and Blaise was playing Frisbee with some other guys. The Frisbee landed on one of the porches on the beach, and it turned out to be Draco’s porch. Blaise and Draco talked, and then Blaise gathered the rest of us there. We came back today to rectify everything and tell Blaise’s mother what was going on.”
“You’re… But he’s… I thought…” Poppy spluttered. “Yes, yes wake him please. I won’t keep him awake long. Can he answer my questions? Like how you’re healing him?” Her answer was a nod before Harry laid his left hand over Draco’s eyes. Slowly, Draco began to wake. When Harry finally took his hand away, Draco was fully conscious. “Good–”
“I asked what he would use, but he wouldn’t say anything. As we continued walking, I realized he kept getting a few steps ahead of me. I’d run to catch up with him, then he’d get ahead of me again. I accused him of speeding up, so he slowed down. But he kept getting ahead of me. Finally, when we were almost standing still, he looked at me funny. He said I was awfully pale. ‘Of course I’m pale,’ I spat back. ‘I’ve always been pale. It’s a Malfoy trait.’ But he shook his head and walked around me a few times. Then he shoved his hand down the back of my robes through the neck.”
“My name is Doctor Theresa Rhodes. I specialize in all aspects of male pregnancy, including the labour and delivery. I was hired to care for a pregnant wizard and his child.”
“So crude. I repeat, I have nothing to say to either of you. Madam Pomfrey said he was okay now, right Headmaster?”
“Forty-five minutes. I woke at about 2:30am and went to get some cookies and milk after walking around a bit. That usually helps, but it didn’t this time. Ouch!” They stopped for a moment. “Please tell me we’re nearly there.”
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
“I want to know where Harry is!” a new voice suddenly butt in. The three teachers looked up with shock and bit of fear in their eyes at the other two-thirds of the Gryffindor Trio standing in the office. They knew they needed to speak with the both of them, but with Harry as protective as he was and Draco as emotional as he was, they knew it was not yet a possibility. Frankly, they were shocked it had taken this long for them to come forward again. “You made an announcement about Malfoy today. Was that true? Did you find him? What about Harry? What new developments are there? Has anything been done since we last had to demand answers?” Hermione asked rapidly.
“No,” Draco answered. “Harry woke me. He was the one keeping me asleep. He tends to do that when he thinks I need some extra rest. Which I don’t,” he directed at Harry. Then he sighed. “I suppose I was roused to tell the story?” Harry nodded. “Fine. Where are we starting?”
“There are some things we need to tell them, Draco,” Dumbledore admonished. “A basic overview, perhaps?”
Disappointed, Harry spelled the calendar away. So there were no notes, no appointments, nothing. He went to fix himself a sandwich and find something sweet to munch on. He was depressed, and eating always made him feel a little better. Luckily his metabolism was high, so it didn't really matter how much he ate or when. He sat in front of the telly, something he insisted on having, and watched whatever looked good while he was channel surfing.
“I want the wedding to be within the week. Is that possible?” Draco asked. “I want it to be soon, so I don’t get any bigger.”
Sheesh, that was about a billion and two times harder than the first chapter. But tell me what you think! I like this fic and I think it’s turning out splendidly! o.O I can’t believe I just used the word “splendidly”.
Harry grinned at the idea and decided to do just that. He pounced and pinned Draco to the bed, ready to please his husband and please himself. He decided to get a little revenge for the treatment he'd suffered yesterday.
But truly it was Severus, Lucius, and Narcissa who were the most impressive to Harry. The three took no mercy, using the Killing Curse liberally on their former comrades. They didn’t build up their curses in intensity but went straight for the kill. They knew their opponents were there to fight dirty and win at any cost. So they would do the same. The three cut a nearly straight path for Harry right to Voldemort. Having spelled his husband and son asleep then locked them safely within the dungeons of Hogwarts, Harry strode straight to the Dark Lord and wished him
I did it! I got through the birth! I’m so proud of myself. It’s the first time I’ve written a non-birth birth scene. Did that make any sense to anyone? In all my MPREGs, the men have always formed a birth canal. Not this time. It was a weird scene to write for me on this, the day of my nephew Stormageddon’s birth. By the time you read this, that day will have come and gone. But it mirrored Stormageddon’s birth quite a bit. Including the tuft of dark hair despite having two light-blonde parents! Anywho, here are the translations for the spells Madam Pomfrey used on Corvus and Draco:
Summer came, and they were split up. But the two-month hiatus from one another quickly came to an end and soon they were back together. Christmas came around, and was celebrated normally. And abnormally. Harry was port keyed from the Great Hall at lunchtime December 23rd to an unknown place. Everyone panicked. Severus and Draco knew where he was by dinner that night: the Dark Lord had him. By dinner December 25th, the Dark Lord was gone. Severus and Draco returned, an unconscious Harry in Draco’s arms, with an awesome story to tell. While Harry was being tortured and force-fed Veratiserum, Voldemort asked question after question about the Order, Dumbledore, Hogwarts, etc. Harry didn’t answer a single thing.
Both boys nodded, though Harry was still smirking. If there was any way to lay claim to Draco and make sure Snape knew it, he’d succeeded. As the pair sat on the couch, he kept a possessive arm around his expecting husband. Draco picked the book he’d been reading back up. It was another male pregnancy book; he couldn’t stop reading them. He was so hungry for knowledge and information. Every so often he’d read a sentence or passage out loud to the other two men in the room, keeping them informed as well.
“Draco, if it be your wish for Harry to be bound to you, place the ring on his finger.” He paused while Draco slipped the ring onto Harry’s left ring finger. “Draco I have not the right to bind thee to Harry only you have this right. If it be your wish, say so at this time and place your ring on his hand.”
“McGonagall had the robes and pins made to Draco’s specifications. Madam Pomfrey has the rings. Dumbledore took care of the food. I took care of the cake. All that’s left is for you to show up, say your vows, and agree to the wedding. I hope that you did think of some vows?”
But it wasn’t enough. Draco moaned at the contact, leaning forward a bit and putting his hands on the headboard for balance. “More, Harry. More.” It wasn’t like they hadn’t had sex just last night. Draco was still nearly insatiable despite his even more constant comments about his looks and his weight and his lack of appeal. Only because he was still slightly stretched from all the recent activity did Harry push two digits in on the next pass. Draco groaned in approval, pushing back to try and hurry it along.
“Just because you like women doesn’t prove anything Blaise,” Dr. Morris said. “You have slept with other men before and you just said that it was pleasurable. Now we need to figure out why you slept with Harry.”
“It’s okay Harry. Like I said, I understand. I don’t want to keep you inside, but I do thank you for promising not to go out unless I’m with you. I promise I’ll go out into the gardens with you at least once a week until Theresa says no more. How does that sound?”
“That’s about when we realized I was pregnant,” he lied. A hand softly caressed his belly and he smiled. “It definitely wasn’t planned, but we were very happy. A baby Potter-Malfoy.” He smiled at Harry, who smiled back. “Due late August or early September, as I said. We don’t know the gender, because we want to be surprised. We’ve just been using the term ‘It’ for now. We have decided to have a renewal of vows in the spring, once the baby has come and we’ve had time to settle as a family. We’ll make an announcement about that at a later date.”
“Come on. I’m not as big as a hippogriff yet.” Harry quickly climbed into bed beside Draco and held him close, letting the feel and smell of Draco relax him. Without realizing it, he was quickly asleep. “You were more tired than you thought,” Draco whispered. “Just relax, and let me watch out for you this time.” He kissed the top of Harry’s head, hoping Harry a sleep without nightmares for once.
“Will you tell me the whole story now, Draco?” Lucius whispered. “I’d like to know just how your rival became my son-in-law. I can understand the need to hold on to anything that can keep you sane during such a terrible time as these last months have surely been for you. But I really must know how you can go from rivalry to marriage.”
“The calendar!” he exclaimed and rushed downstairs. In the small kitchen they usually ate in when they were by themselves, Harry and Draco had created a calendar system that worked for the two of them. It was basically a muggle calendar that ran on magic, but was also created by magic. He called up the day and noticed that nothing was charted for that day. No dates, no appointments, no outings... no birthdays. He enlarged the calendar to show the whole week, in case it was a longer appointment being called into question.
“Please, for the love of Merlin, someone help! Stay with me, Harry. Help is coming, I just know it. Help!”
“Look at some of these names!” Draco crowed. “Acton? Adair? Africa?! Who names their child after a continent?!” He flipped a few pages ahead. “Bogart! Ha ha ha! Can you imagine naming our son or daughter Bogart?! Bonadventure. Bonner. Botham. Boys?! How horrid!” Another few pages slipped past. “Frye? Fuchsia? Fulk? What is wrong with these people?! Oh no! Norina. Nowles. Nubia. … Saffron?! Sage?! You’re not making dinner, you’re making a child! Sammy. Sargent. Sassy?! Sayer. Seal. Senga. Look, I may or may not have weird family names,” Harry silently snorted at this, “but these names are ridiculous. Is this a muggle book? Please say this is muggle! I bet Granger gave this to you.”
“Yes, Master Harry is in the room. He isn’t needing anything right now. He be eating breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, even tea times! Master McKay is just fine, but is very loud, sir. And he said Miss Theresa ma’am is coming by twice today.”
“I slept around in school,” came the automatic response. Blaise blushed and closed his eyes, wishing he would stop speaking. “A seventh year introduced me to it when I was in my fourth year and ever since then I just slept with whomever I wanted to. I didn’t sleep with just anyone; I had my standards.”
But Hermione said they’d been talking about the possibility of them pairing up, Harry and Draco, for quite some time now. It wasn’t a new concept to Hermione or the other girls. Was it only Gryffindor who thought that or did the other houses think that too? Slytherin? He couldn’t comprehend that thought, couldn’t wrap his mind around it. Why not say that he was in love with Snape? Or Voldemort? At the time, it seemed just as likely. The idea was ludicrous!
“Good evening, Draco,” came Hermione’s voice, chipper as always. “How are you today? Has there been any change in –
“Ah! Yes!” Draco cried, arching his spine and throwing his head back. He cock gave a small jet of pre-come.
But, as he walked toward his office, no one mentioned his birthday. He saw co-workers he barely knew, and co-workers he went into the field with on a weekly basis. He saw people he liked, and people he didn't like. He even saw Shaklebolt and Tonks, who he'd worked with in the Order. They greeted him, had a quick chat about unimportant things, and then went on their way. That was when he saw Ron.
Then Harry was thrusting his way in and out of Draco, building their pleasure all the way to the top of that pinnacle before pushing them both over. First Draco, who cried out loudly to make up for the fact that Harry could not. He had become more vocal in the last month or so, just to allow Harry to live vicariously through him. And then, right at the tail end of Draco’s climax, Harry began his own. He threw his head back as if to cry out, but no sound was emitted. Draco held him through the aftershocks, held him close as they rolled to their sides and cuddled. It had taken Draco a while to get used to the concept of cuddling, but Harry had demanded it, insisted it was for more than warmth out there.
“Would you look at that,” Draco said as he got Harry to calm down. “Have you been talking about me to our son Harry?” Harry burst into a fresh wave of tears. “What did I do now?”
It was Molly Weasley who broke first. “You knew? You knew Harry was missing, was in danger? That he’d come back blind? That he was having a baby?”
The door was flung open. “Tell her?” Harry asked with wide eyes. “You mean tell her that I was pregnant before I was married and that the baby’s not yours and that I’m not even sleeping with you? You want to tell her all of that? Why not?! Tell her everything why don’t you! And while you’re at it, tell her about my childhood and everything I’ve gone through and why we really want this house and why I can’t stand the thought of being in England again!”
“What was that about?” Draco asked. Harry merely lay a hand on Draco’s stomach. “Ah, I see. Okay, the detention. So Harry and I had fought in Hagrid’s class and were given detention in the Forbidden Forest as punishment. We went out with Hagrid leading the way, but it was only a few minutes before we were separated. He told us to stand still and that he’d be back in just a few moments. He’d heard something in the Forest and decided to check it out. When we could no longer hear him, I began mocking Harry. The usual.”
“You should care about your health, Draco,” the headmaster urged. “It is of greater importance, now more than ever.”
“Damn it Draco!” Blaise stormed up onto the porch and shoved Draco against the side of the house. “You’re going to listen to me for a few minutes now. No more guessing based on what you see. That is not my baby out there with Harry so don’t even try to throw that in my face.”
Albus merely steepled his fingers and eyes the pacing Potions Master before him. “Severus, come now. You know it’s not feasible to give them their own rooms. With young Mr. Malfoy pregnant and in his second trimester, he needs someone to look out for him. Someone who can freely communicate, and preferably someone with medi-wizard training, to be on hand in case something happens. It’s why you were chosen.”
With a heavy sigh, Blaise sat across from his mother and began the long explanation. “Harry and Draco became friends and then boyfriends shortly before the downfall of the Dark Lord. It was the day before graduation when I found Harry in the Great Hall. He told me he was waiting for Draco because Draco had something he wanted to talk to him about. He also told me he was pregnant with Draco’s baby. I hugged him in congratulations and Harry kissed my cheek. We were friends, that was all. I thought Draco knew that.
“They don’t know anything about you, Harry,” Draco explained, ignoring the gesturing for the moment. “They know we’re married and that we’re having a baby. That’s about it.” He waited for Harry to say something, then turned to the other Gryffindors. “This is going to be bit of a tale, sit down for a moment while I work out the details.”
“Like I haven’t missed my schooling?! My Christmas?! I have missed just as much time as he has!” Draco roared, jumping from his seat. “Every day that he was wandering lost in the Forbidden Forest, I was by his side. Not you! Not Weasley! It was always me! When he was cold, it was me that gave him warmth! When he was hurt, it was me that nurtured him back to health! When he was scared, it was me that lied and told him it would be okay! Not you! Not Weasley!” Taking deep gulps of air, he paused for a moment. “And when there was no hatred left to fight with, it was me that gave him love. All of that was me. I am his life now, not you. I mean more to him than you ever could. You’re right. It is all me.”
“Not much. Just that you're the top, and I beg you for it, and I am apparently gagging for it.” There was a sigh of relief that, although it was more than anyone needed to know, it wasn't too bad. “Then I told them all that I liked to be on my knees, bound, sucking your cock.” Harry groaned. “And that I like to play with toys.” Another louder, longer groan. “Oh, come on baby. You don't have to defend your manhood anymore. We made sure everyone knew you were the top.”
All you need to know is that I’m an awesome authoress and that this is an awesome fic that you want to read and WILL NOT flame at the end. Also, you want to leave a review. I know you do. And so do you. Because I just told you that you do. Yeah. On with the fic now…
“After much debate, we have agreed on what to tell you two. You know the most important bits, and have surely already guessed more.” He went on to describe the detention, the start of their wanderings, and most of the obstacles they faced in their travels of the Forbidden Forest. He had to stop so Ron could explain the shock behind Draco using Harry’s wand so easily.
Ron wouldn’t find out what she wanted as there was a knock on the door. Hermione ran into the bathroom to clean herself up, leaving him with the job of answering the door. Just before he got to it, there was another knock. “I’m coming,” Ron said as he opened the door. “Yes? Can I help you?”
“At least you knew the proper spells to place on him,” Snape said, still trying to help Lucius in his pain. Now that Draco was out of the room, Lucius was not holding back his anguish. “I need another dose of the potion, but I've never given two doses to anyone before. I am unsure as to the side effects. It could help him, or it could kill him.”
“Well, if that’s what you want dear. Your father and I will have no problems with that. We’ll owl you the paperwork to change the name from us to you two. Enough of that. How’s my son-in-law? You mentioned a medi-witch was living with you? Is everything okay? No one was hurt were they? I’ll insist you come home if you or Harry are hurt now.”
“Come now, Malfoy,” Hermione protested. “There’s more than that! You’re on pretty friendly terms with Harry, and the professors were calling you by a different name, and you are looking much better for you time spent in the Forest than even Harry does, and–”
“Anyways!” Draco stressed. “I asked him what was wrong, why he wasn’t talking. So he started talking. Only no sound came out of his mouth as it moved. We found a patch of ground with no grass or plants and he began to write in the dirt. I suggested we find somewhere a bit safer to take up residence for a while.” Draco fidgeted in bed for a moment, then took up the story again. “After we found a nice place, well, as nice a place as the Forbidden Forest can provide, we got to talking. Harry wrote in the dirt and I talked aloud. We finally realized Harry could use wandless magic to conjure paper and a muggle pen. It was a little easier after that.” He fidgeted again.
“The Ministry is like that and you know it, Harry,” Draco sighed. “It is quite possible that what Dr. Morris said is true. But quite frankly, I’d do this twice a day for the next six months if it meant getting you and McKay back. I’d even,” he paused to take a steadying breath, “I’d even cut my hair that many times to prove McKay’s paternity.”
“Yes!” Harry sat up quickly with wide eyes, one hand lying protectively over his stomach. “Yes, please Blaise.”
Tears welled up in his eyes. “If you want to go, I understand. I thought… I thought the wedding meant something and that you were happy. But I guess I was wrong. I can get the marriage annulled. You don’t have to worry about me saying anything to
Knowing better than to try and get Harry to talk about what had just happened, Theresa also pasted a fake smile on and nodded. “So far so good,” she whispered. “This is McKay’s heartbeat. And here he is. See? These are his feet, and here’s his head. He’s perfectly happy, so long as you don’t eat anything spicy, okay?” They laughed lightly, although it was strained. “Here, wipe off the goo and sit up again. We’ll see how you’re doing now.” She waved her wand over him to see how he was handling the pregnancy. “You seem to be doing okay. But take it a little more easy; you’re getting tired faster.”
“No. Now I have a favour to ask of you. As a friend. Please, Severus, you must help me in this.” The sincerity in Lucius’ eyes and pleading in his voice rooted Severus to the spot. He nodded once, jerkily. “You know what He has planned for Draco. I can’t allow that to happen. You’re closest to him. Tell him about yourself, tell him to contact me to confirm it. Don’t let him walk the same path as me. Get him to make friends with that Potter boy you hate so much. Whatever it takes. Don’t let him meet the same fate as me.”
“Harry, that's enough now,” Draco warned, standing behind him and placing a restricting hand on his arm.
“Yes, dear,” Narcissa said. “We understood that signing just fine. No translation needed.” She paused for a moment to smirk and then think. “What if we conjured a divan for Draco and Harry to sit on and chairs and couches for everyone else? It’s more intimate, and it won’t make Draco feel left out.”
What they found was this: Harry wasn’t in a tower, Harry wasn’t in a classroom, Harry wasn’t in the Great Hall or the infirmary, Harry wasn’t in the dungeons, and Harry wasn’t outside. They lay the map down dejected. He wasn’t in Hogwarts at all. They really had taken their best friend out of the school. Hermione’s eyes went wide suddenly. She grabbed the map, nearly ripping it in her haste. “Show the infirmary!” she shouted. The map moved so it was showing the hospital wing once more. “Ron, Ron! Look at this! He’s not there!”
Harry’s glare softened a smidge, and he looked down at Draco with sad eyes. When he looked back up at Poppy, his gaze almost broke her heart. Slowly, his grip slackened and he got off the bed. He didn’t leave the bedside, but he did move away just enough for Poppy to scan Draco and him separately. She did just that, somehow knowing to make slow, calming movements so as not to startle him. She gasped when she read what the quill she had charmed to write on the parchment beside her wrote down. It was all of the injuries Draco was suffering from. She turned to Harry and did the same for him.
“Are you satisfied?” Draco bit out dryly. He stomped back to their room, Harry following and gesturing wildly. “I don’t know what you’re saying Harry. I can’t see you. And no, I won’t turn around. I’m mad. And I want to stay mad damn it! I want some say in this. I don’t know them. They’re not my friends. They’re your friends. Let them know that you’re okay, that you’re blind and mute. Use a Quick Quotes Quill, or legillimancy, or something to communicate with them. You don’t need me to be there to translate for you all the time. You can manage on your own for an hour. And I’ll be here in these rooms. I won’t be going anywhere. Like always.”
“Well, the serum is in effect so I know that’s true. Just a moment please.” Dr. Morris turned back around and picked up a small notepad and a quill. She whispered two charms, one to make both items float and another to make the quill write whatever was spoken. “My name is Doctor Jennifer Morris. I am specialized in all basics of medical needs for witches and wizards, and specialize in male pregnancies and the such. I cannot deliver, but I can assist.” She point to Theresa to do the same.
“Our necklaces, charmed for us each, tells us when another is in peril,” Ron explained quickly. “Harry’s is
“That’s it, Harry, that’s it! That’s my spot! Harder… Yeah, you got it. You know just what I want, what I need. Only you, Harry, only you can satisfy me. Make me wet. Get me ready for your cock. I’m so ready, Harry. I need you. Your tongue, your fingers, your cock-”
Hermione jumped off the rock and pulled her boyfriend along behind her as she ran all the way back up to Gryffindor Tower. Ron was shoved toward the stairs leading to the boys’ dorms to get the map from Harry’s trunk. That was another thing that confused them. If Harry was gone, wouldn’t he have taken his trunk with him? She didn’t think long on it as Ron came back down with the map in hand. “I solemnly swear I am up to no good,” he recited. Hogwarts slowly began to bleed onto the parchment in black ink. “Start at the top of Hogwarts and make your way all the way to the dungeons, then to the outside grounds,” he ordered, watching as the map moved around to show what he’d instructed it to.
Draco had tears in his eyes, as did Harry. His vows were even simpler than his blonde mate. He raised his right hand with two fingers extended and placed them on his cheekbone. Then he dragged them to his jaw line before moving the hand to Draco’s left cheekbone and doing the same thing there; their sign for “I love you”. A lone tear fell down Draco’s cheek.
“Of course.” He turned, and stalked out of the Headmaster’s office back to the dungeons. When he arrived, he immediately knocked on the slightly open bedroom door that would lead him to his godson. “The headmaster has agreed to the outline of things, with details to come. He will ask Poppy to witness and Minerva to stand with Potter this afternoon, and will floo in after dinner with their answers. Have your details ready to hand to him by then.”
“Hello Blaise,” Draco said, completely emotionless. He looked over where Blaise had looked and his muscles tensed for a brief moment. “I see you and Harry are perfectly happy together. Congratulations are in order, I guess.”
“Thank-you Harry. Let the record state that Harry Zabini was formally Harry Potter. Sorry Harry, it has to be said. Do you think you could get McKay to say something just to show on the record that the child is here?”
“Very well Dr. Rhodes,” Harry said, standing and offering his hand to shake. “Thank you. Please, rejoin the others and Blaise in the kitchen. Dr. Johansen?” The last doctor walked in with a smile on her face. “Please, sit down. Do you know who I am?”
All you need to know is that I’m an awesome authoress and that this is an awesome fic that you want to read and WILL NOT flame at the end. Also, you want to leave a review. I know you do. And so do you. Because I just told you that you do. Yeah. On with the fic now…
“You lied to us?” Hermione seethed, rounding on the headmaster. “We have been worried sick, freaking out over every possible theory and every time our charms let us know he was hurt or injured, and he was here?!”
“These three have known for a few months now, have been helping care for the two young men. Draco, especially, needs help at this late stage of pregnancy. They were also essential in keeping the lie about Harry being off in training strong.”
Draco could see the tension and stress building in Harry, so he placed a gentle hand on Harry’s cheek. “Calm down, love,” he whispered. “We don’t need to answer those questions right now. Let’s just go back to our room and look at the book on baby names.” He watched Harry gesture a few times. “Yes, I know we already have names picked out. I just think it would be fun anyways. Relaxing.”
“I am a doctor who specializes in male pregnancies. I was asked this morning around seven o’clock, when my shift ended, if I would like to be a personal doctor for a hush hush male pregnancy case. Of course I was intrigued. I accepted and was asked to be here, at this house, by ten o’clock. I went home, took a shower and changed my clothes, then came here. I was third to arrive, only to be followed by Dr. Mitchsens. Mr. Zabini told us that he had been married within the last week and that you were pregnant. He referred to you as Harry at all times. He mentioned the cravings you’d been having and that things were rather hectic in your life so stress would be a problem. He gave us some scenarios and asked for the answers we’d give.”
He was really going to have to learn to listen to the man when it came to the Malfoys. Everything he’d thought he’d known was wrong. He’d learned the truth about Draco in the Forbidden Forest. He’d learned about Lucius every day since he’d been brought to Hogwarts by Severus. He’d learned about Narcissa after she’d turned up beaten, broken, and bloody at the Hogwarts gates.
. It was nothing more. The kiss on the cheek was a simple ‘thank-you for being there for me’ because you know we’re
Harry woke with a start. He hadn’t dreamt about that night in a long time. He was sure that was the night their child had been created. Suddenly, he realized he was naked from the waist down and that there was a reason for that. Pulling up the blankets a bit, he was almost startled to see Draco going down on him. Grey eyes stared up at him before that mouth smirked around its mouthful. A few more gentle sucks and Draco eased off, slithering up Harry’s body to kiss him proper.
“There would be a live orchestra for the music, an outdoor pavilion perhaps. It all depends on the time and weather. And the child of course. I don’t want to be pregnant when we have our second wedding. We will be married before It comes of course, but for the second wedding I don’t want to be the size of a Quidditch Pitch in my robes.” He paused for a moment. “What do you want Harry? Don’t you have any ideas or wants in this wedding business?”
Draco was dreading the interview all morning. He kept moaning about how fat he was and how ungainly. So Harry had to show him just how attractive he found him to be.
“At dinner on Sunday. When he comes down, talk to him. Try asking him things. Make him stay until after dessert or coffee or something. Tell him what you’re telling me, that as his friend you are concerned for his and McKay’s well-being. Ask him if there’s something you can do to make this easier on him. Other than that… I don’t know Blaise.” She sighed and left to walk around outside. The snow had melted and it was Summer time now.
