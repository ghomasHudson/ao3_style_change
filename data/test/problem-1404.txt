, Draco!” Harry’s voice is liquid, ripples on a pond, and the hand that reaches up to cup Draco’s cheek is trembling.
Draco feels a great gasping sob being ripped from him… he can’t contain it and he can’t control it and he feels himself falling forward without even the energy to stop himself.
“What does it matter?” Harry asks, his words half-muffled, his face pressed into Draco’s chest. “I’m getting rid of it anyway.”
He is sticky, and the room smells musky. There is another smell, too, one that is familiar and perfect and one that he never wants to stop breathing in.
.” Harry looks almost ill. “They took something that is supposed to be about love and trust and pleasure and used it as a tool…
Harry’s fingers, gentle and hesitant, slide across the top scar. They reach for the second, moving slower, memorizing each bump, the jagged edges of poorly healed flesh.
Harry’s made a fiddly sort of dinner, the kind he excels at, but genuinely hates to cook: Fish with an artichoke-tomato vinaigrette beside grilled vegetables, and potatoes, roasted to perfection with fresh herbs and asiago cheese. There is crusty bread and flavored oil to dip it in, and a pile of greens… because Draco loves them.
“The… clients… they mostly saw what they expected to see… a lost lover, the movie star they fancied, someone they just wanted to fuck. It was a job, I guess. No matter how much I hated it, no matter how awful it was, even when it
Marked… probably with even more reluctance than Draco, and Draco thought he received a sentence similar to his own… so…
“Madam Pomfrey gave me some books,” he says quietly. “Professor McGonagall wrote a letter of recommendation for me… for St. Mungo’s. When they rejected me she even went down in person… but… Well, there wasn’t anything she could do… I think she asked Madam Pomfrey to send the books. I think she asked Hermione to help me get into the Muggle course.”
… an old Potions textbook, and several paperback novels, which look Muggle and have bindings too worn to read, on the nightstand. The top book says
Grimmauld Place seems strange without them—empty and echoing—but Draco would be lying if he said he wasn’t also enjoying long evenings in the library curled up with Harry.
When his aunt swung it at him, it knocked his shoulder out of joint, too. But Malfoy only asked about scars.
Draco looked at the large, round, open-faced… pie… casserole… thing… on the table. It appeared to have some sort of red sauce spread over it and was covered in melted cheese and what looked like mushrooms and bits of meat.
“I thought… I wanted… I just wanted not to be alone that night. To he held… loved even. Not to wake up in some stranger’s bed. Some stranger with a boyfriend.”
Harry is looking down at their joined hands. With his other hand, he traces Draco’s fingers… Draco shivers a bit… and up his arm. Harry’s fingers stop when they reach three silver lines running across the back of Draco’s forearm.
. The thought of it is enough to turn his stomach to ice. There might also be some sort of physical punishment, but that seems almost inconsequential by comparison.
It can’t last, though. This happiness is like a soap bubble… and Draco can see the shimmering edges with reality just beyond.
Classes… studying… more studying… The routine is comforting. In the common room no one hates him; in their bedroom, Harry’s touch is love.
Draco has decided that he loves the back of Harry’s neck brushes the hair back some more to nibble just below his ear.
Thank you for all your comments! Either take a peek at the newest tag... or just read on to see if you guessed correctly! <3
of sweat, of fingers so slippery it’s a miracle he was able to hold on to them at all. I’m wiping away the imagined-memory of them slipping out of Harry’s grasp, the pain of trying to hold onto something that you
He uses his thumb to trace Harry’s eyebrow, along his cheek, along his jaw… he can feel Harry relax, fractionally, underneath him.
drop the carton of milk he was holding… but it was just about empty so not as embarrassing as it could have been.
The treacle tart Draco made for dessert effectively keeps Harry from storming from the kitchen… but it does not keep him from shouting a bit.
Harry is gone, too, but that hardly matters. He left tea, under a warming charm, and buttered toast,
Granger tends to shatter the fog, dragging the world, and Draco’s place in it, into crisp focus. Draco thinks it’s probably a good thing, but he rather wishes she wouldn’t.
Malfoy nodded. “I didn’t scream,” he said, as though this was important. “When he whipped me, I didn’t scream.”
perfect. They is not a fitting meal for the heir to the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black.” The elf is scowling. “Or Master,” he adds belatedly.
That had been a week ago. Draco hadn’t been so hungry then. He expects the compulsion that would make the man wait until he receives
They’re walking together by the lake. Springtime has painted the grounds of Hogwarts a hopeful green and, from under trees and beside rocks, patches of vibrant daffodils explode out of the earth. The sky is grey and threatening, but the flowers make the world seem bright.
Harry had been prepared for the ribs, for the utter emaciation he knew he would see as soon as Malfoy removed his clothing; he gasped out loud when he saw the other boy’s back.
He wasn’t willing to accept a lifetime in prison, either. So he sold himself to Elladora instead… and simply endured…
“What? Bring home beautiful boys to fuck?” He brushes Harry’s hair back from his cheek. “Yeah. I guess.”
Severus wasn’t sure what sort of melodramatic flair had caused the Dark Lord to leave the comforts of the drawing room at Malfoy Manor and traipse them all out to the cemetery on the edge of the estate, but it could hardly bode well for young Malfoy.
Draco rolls his eyes at the absurdity of this statement… and suddenly books are swirling around him in waves of colors and memories. For a moment it is all too much.
Draco lets himself be held a moment longer. If he said he wasn’t crying, just a little, he would be lying.
causing him pain… and, at the same time, wanting nothing more than Harry’s touch. His fingers are on the robe, ready to shed it, but Harry stops him.
His name may be as old as England, but the man himself has ancestors that hail from the Indian subcontinent—he’s short, slightly round, and his skin is the color of melted chocolate.
“Wait… Draco…” Harry waves his wand, vanishing the papers. “Come here. Come here and sit with me. Please.”
“It’s maybe not such a good idea to kick a hornet’s nest, either,” the old man says. “But it doesn’t look like that’s going to stop you.”
Draco can’t join in. His feet have stopped moving, he realizes, and he’s standing holding Harry’s hand like it’s the most important thing in the world. The lake is flat and bluish-grey at their feet.
The passion in Harry’s eyes crashes over Draco like a wave and Draco turns into it, embracing it. Harry’s mouth is hungry… his tongue both demanding and teasing.
At the moment, it’s the head of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures who has him face down, arse up, on silk sheets.
, the day he had been flung, alone, on the path that would lead to him walking, deliberately, into the dark forest… to his death.
“Fine… thanks,” Harry says, tightening his grip slightly before stepping out from behind Draco to accept the mug Weasley is holding out for him. He takes a sip, wrinkles his nose, and stirs in a heaping spoonful of sugar, ruining the perfect foam.
“Lucius, find a cell for the boy and leave him there. You will have no contact with him after that.” The Dark Lord fixed his gaze on Narcissa, who flinched. “Is that understood?”
The pace Potter sets is brutal, and Draco can feel a trickle of dampness seeping from the corners of his eyes. He hears the noises that escape him… pained noises, noises that he cannot contain. Potter hears them too and, if anything, fucks him harder.
And he was telling the truth when he promised Draco that everything would be all right. Draco is cleared of most charges and pardoned of the rest. He is to spend the summer with his mother and return to Hogwarts for Eighth Year.
“To be fair, she was almost five,” he says. “And I only read half of it to her. She read the other half to me.”
“No,” Potter says again, softly this time. “That’s not what I’m asking.” He twists so that he and Draco are nearly face to face, and twists his hand in Draco’s until they’re palm to palm, fingers still intertwined. “I’m asking if
“An excellent question, Granger,” Draco said. He wanted to mock her, truly he did. But he was just too tired.
They are wet, soaked with sweat, and sticky… and Draco begins to shiver. With a little maneuvering, made more complicated by the fact that Draco can’t… won’t…
Potter—partly because Potter looks adorable sneaking popcorn out of his own bowl in his own house, but mostly because he has no fucking idea of what to do next. Nothing in his professional experience, and certainly nothing in his childhood, has prepared him for an evening of watching telly… with Harry Potter.
Harry’s fingertips rest lightly on the tops of Draco’s bare feet. One finger is making gentle, sneaky circles on his leg, just above the hem of his pajamas… but he is otherwise completely motionless.
“No.” Draco’s hand is still gentle on Harry’s cheek, but it tightens somehow… changes from caressing to confidant. “No, Harry, love, wizards can’t contract HIV… or any Muggle virus. You know that.”
Malfoy is still holding his hand… pressed between his own. His fingers haven’t completely stopped moving, but almost. The two girls are still on the merry-go-round, giggling as they spin.
Better silk, Draco tells himself, than stained and scratchy cotton. He even believes it—sort of. But sold is sold.
“I… turn around.” Harry says it as gently as he can, but the words are still an echo of his earlier words. He hears it clearly, and so does Malfoy.
I roll over. Harry Potter’s bed is empty, his covers thrown back, his sheets white in the faint moonlight.
Not surprisingly, Potter ignores that, hitching a smile back onto his face. “I’ve picked out a film. Come sit down?”
“It’s in my story. The lonely boy kisses the dragon and the dragon turns into a prince and they live happily ever after.”
“Mmmm, uh-uh, Harry.” Charlie pulls him even closer. “I’m not interested right now in what you think
Draco clears his throat. “I have art club right after school,” he says, “and then I have to meet with an English Language Learner at the library… so about six?”
Draco can feel a growing dampness, his own precome mixing with Harry’s hot breath… the wet of his tongue… as he licks him, nibbling and sucking. He’s beautiful there, his vibrant green eyes constantly flicking upwards… wordlessly asking
He is with Weasley the first time he sees one of his clients. By now he can nearly always make passersby on the street stay who they really are… and not morph into someone he knows. Intimately. But there is no mistaking this man—the ruddy face, the broad shoulders and blunt fingers, the layer of fat overlaying an even thicker layer of muscle. He was
He can see into a tiny overrun garden, and into a slightly better tended one behind a tall stone wall. He can see the backs of another row of houses and, beyond that what might be a park, lightly brushed with the first touches of spring.
“Oh.” Harry Potter is bright red. “It’s okay… I mean, I thought you might want to… but it’s not a big deal… if you don’t… want to, I mean. I was just wondering.”
“Death Eaters are not welcome at St. Mungo’s.” She sounds more bored than hateful. “You’ll have to leave.”
“I…” Draco doesn’t know what to say. He’s certainty not going to tell Weasley the truth. Not about this.
… like I was… a tool or something. I hated the things I did… the way people touched me… the bodies I wore. I hated the way the door just opened and shut and I couldn’t control any of it…”
Healer Mitchell makes no such promises. In fact, it rather seems he is promising Harry’s painful demise.
The door opens and Charlie Weasley, literally and figuratively, blows into the coffee shop, bringing with him the smell of fresh mountain air and a pocket of cold. Charlie is dressed for the Romanian winter—all fur and leather—and he has a full beard now. He looks wild and untamed and maybe a little frightening.
Draco is on his feet before he realizes he has moved. So is Luna. The distance between them has not changed.
Harry tucks himself back in and watches Malfoy try to right his clothing, watches him move with aching slowness into a sitting position.
what that necklace was. She had also enclosed a note mentioning that the Dark Lord had entrusted Bellatrix with a cup, an heirloom of Helga Hufflepuff; it was in her vault at Gringotts.
Strong, slim hands hold him steady as he relieves himself of the remnants of his breakfast. Malfoy really is a University student, in his second year of a nursing course… of all the unexpected things.
Harry runs his thumbs across the scars. He looks up, holding Draco’s gaze. “Will you… will you take off your shirt?” he asks.
.” Harry picks up Draco’s hand and brings it to his lips, kissing the backs of his fingers. “And I did really want to see you in these robes. They suit you.”
Draco finds that tears are, once again, slipping down his own cheeks. “Oh, Harry, they didn’t leave you. They died. They were killed.
A rich, flourless cake, drizzled with ganache and topped with fresh raspberries sits on the sideboard.
Harry doesn’t say anything. He just picks up Draco’s arm, his thumbs sliding over the Mark… almost as if he is brushing it away, erasing it.
“I know. But I promised. And, actually, Malfoy, you look like you could just fall over at any second. I can’t just let you drown in the tub.”
His eyes register shock, hurt, maybe even hope before they resolve into a sort of professional calm.
Weasley would notice that he only showers very early or very late… when he can be assured of absolute privacy.
“Stress could be a factor. Not enough sleep, too many fry-ups, not enough veg… I remember those days. You’ve got exams soon, right? What are you studying?”
For a moment he just stands there. The cottage was too loud… too crowded; the house is too quiet… too empty. Part of him wants to go back.
“She was my first friend. When I went to my aunt and uncle’s for the summers… she was the only one who didn’t
He knows the definition to all of the words she’s just said… but he cannot quite comprehend how they relate to
all his major arteries. Hermione thought it was a miracle; Ron didn’t think it sounded like a miracle—he thought it sounded like magic.
happy, so I’m not even sure! But I liked it… I liked my life and working at the coffee shop and being with you… everything. I liked being
This is how he wound up in Lance’s arms… his flat… his bed… in the first place. Harry knows, too, with a sick twist of his heart, that he won’t stop Lance from fucking him again now… even though he’s sore, even though he doesn’t really
“You don’t know how much I wanted to use my mouth,” he whispers, almost afraid to say it out loud. It’s the truth, though. “How much I wanted to taste all of you.”
He refuses to use magic, but instead pours over a Muggle repair book, sometimes with the less-than-helpful aid of Mr. Weasley. Then he moves things and twists things and then stands back to admire the results.
Robes, trousers, and pants are all swept away. He feels it then… something hard pressing against him. Fury turns to terror and revulsion gives way to a searing pain.
Harry sucks Draco’s first finger into his mouth, up to the knuckle. He swirls his tongue around it, and sparks of pleasure dance up Draco’s whole arm. He sucks the finger all the way in, and Draco moans.
“Hey…,” Harry pulls him close, obviously willing to ignore the mess in favor of holding Draco. “Hey… I’ve got you… that was so amazing. So perfect. Do you want me to…?”
Harry’s tongue touches the inside of his elbow, and Draco shivers, arching his whole body into the touch.
Draco expected lessons in torture and murder and other unbearable things… instead Macnair led him up to the guest wing and to the room he had claimed for his own.
“Look,” she says, and he has to take a step back, covering his nose with his hand; her perfume suddenly seems to be assaulting him, “why don’t you go sit down for a bit? Rest a little. We’re not busy, and I’d rather have you not faint—or vomit!—behind my counter.”
Draco is sitting in the middle of the bed, wearing only a pair of boxers, when Harry walks out of the bathroom.
Draco concentrates on nothing but Harry… the little gasps he makes, and how he smells of Earl Grey tea and wood shavings and sunshine, and how he fills Draco’s hand, and how the ridges of his cock slide under the pajamas under his palm, and how he arches into Draco with a moan that is at least half sob.
“Because I’m so fucked up that apparently I would do anything—even fuck a complete stranger that I didn’t even really want to fuck—just to not spend Halloween alone.”
Polyjuice Potion burns going down… and then he waits as his bones grow or shrink, as his features change, molding themselves into the features his client wants.
compared to what he feels now. But even through his rage, a small part of him recognizes that this is in no way Draco’s fault… and Harry hates that part, too. He means to push away, but instead finds his face buried in Draco’s jumper, his fingers fisting the wool, unable to let go.
at Snape,” he said softly, “For stopping the bleeding… for saving me. I thought you’d actually killed me. And I was so grateful.”
It’s true, but for the sake of the darkness swirling in Malfoy’s eyes, eyes that look like they would give anything to
I’m being nice. A good brother-in-law who is not a brother-in-law. Victoire will be thrilled. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t motivated, in large part, by the idea of seeing Draco again.
wasn’t allowed to watch it either—my uncle didn’t think it was appropriate—but Dudley snuck it into the house anyway and when they’d all go out and leave me behind, I’d sneak into his room and watch it.” Potter stops talking, rather abruptly, and sits back down. “Anyway, I… hope… you like it.”
—and never was—good enough to make up for this.” He nods at his arm. At least it doesn’t burn anymore. It just rests quietly and hideously against his skin. “No one would hire me.”
“I don’t know,” Draco admitted. “But I hope it happens again soon.” Draco grabbed him, before he could turn tail and flee, and kissed him. Gently.
attachment to the number seven. Forty-nine lashes on the boy’s back—he was barely seventeen, for Christ’s sake!—seven bouts of Cruciatus. It was too much.
from here. Stop acting like I’ve agreed to lead packs of Muggles on a six week trek through the Andes Mountains.”
The coffee shop smells warm and comfortable. Homey, even. If he knew what a home was supposed to smell like.
The cool air hits Draco as he steps inside. Coffee, chocolate, and the rosy perfume of the older woman sitting by the door reach his nose and he breathes in deeply. Pleasurably. She glances up, sees their joined hands, and gives them a small smile before returning to her book.
Potter swallows visibly, and Draco watches the muscles of his throat work… forgetting the fishnets… the ribbons… the Reparations Company, Incorporated. Everything.
The bottom step creaks and Harry shuffles into the kitchen, bare-chested and looking a little worse for wear; at least he has bothered to put on pajama bottoms.
“I suppose.” Malfoy looked as though he might want to ask Harry to leave again, but in the end he just turned back to the mirror and began to undo the buttons of his shirt.
of November. They have been aching almost constantly for a month now. Except… for these past three days.
Some of the marks were more than half healed, but many were still raw. Harry poured a few drops of the oily brown liquid onto his fingertips. There were too many stripes to count, crossing over one another, colored with bruises fading in tones of green and mottled yellow; a web of misery inflicted as punishment for failing to do evil.
“I know that dream,” I say softly, carding my fingers through his hair. His hair is thick and heavy, but so very soft. Even though it looks it, it’s never tangled, and my fingers slide easily through the curls. “You always come for me.”
It turns out rather wonderful… for Shepherd’s Pie. Which means that Draco will consent to actually eating some of it. He stubbornly serves it beside a huge pile of greens.

Draco isn’t entirely sure what a chemical is, but the expression on Harry’s face makes his heart clench.
Of course, Percy and his wife had spirited away Mr. and Mrs. Weasley for a Muggle cruise and they can’t be reached.
Sleep had come easily to Draco at the Manor. In the cell there hadn’t been much to do but sleep. And after… sleep had been easier than being awake. Now it was eluding him.
Hermione’s pancakes are delicious and she has remembered that he prefers jam and lots of butter to syrup. The jam is perfectly sweet and full of chunks of real strawberries. It is heavenly.
And then Mockridge will heave himself out of bed to shower before going home to his wife. He will tell Draco that he’s booked the room for the night… that Draco should sleep… and Draco
I would pass out under the invisibility cloak sometimes, causing something of a panic. Hermione worried. Ron yelled. Ginny and I broke up.
It must have been at least partially effective because Draco opens and shuts his mouth three times before finally saying, “She’s my
“Erm… thank you, Kreacher. Oh,” Draco said, remembering. “Severus said to give this to you.” He pulled an ugly golden locket out of his pocket.
Harry can feel tears dripping down his cheeks. Malfoy pulls him closer. Their foreheads aren’t touching, but almost.
The uncomfortable thing was that Ron believed him. He was fairly certain that Malfoy was in as much danger from He-Who-Must-Be-Named as they were; he
“Hey… come here.” Harry sits on a large rock, pulling Draco down beside him. The rock isn’t wet… but it isn’t dry either. Harry presses a long kiss onto Draco’s forehead… then kisses the corner of his eye… then kisses down the trail of tears that Draco hadn’t know he was crying… and finds his lips.
Harry watches Malfoy drain the sink, wipe it down, and rinse and ring out the cloth. He drapes it over the faucet and turns to face Harry.
“In fact, you have more right to live in this house, I think, than I do. If you want to stay… if you want me to move out… I will.”
His dark shirt and trousers… his robes… they will hide the telltale bruises that have blossomed on his arm… on his hip.
don’t want chicken soup,” Harry says, maybe a little petulantly. “Let’s stop for curry before this whole ‘put me to bed thing’, yeah?”
Hermione is making pancakes. Weasley is minding the bacon. They look up when he enters, then meet each other’s eyes in a way that makes Draco want very much to glance down to make sure that he actually
Harry took a few steps forward until he was close enough to place his hand on Malfoy’s shoulder. He didn’t touch him, though. “Those are over a month old,” he said unable to keep the horror out of his voice. “They should be healed by now.”
Ron had coaxed Hermione into playing a game of chess, and the two were ignoring him almost completely. Harry didn’t mind. He had absolutely
Almost unwillingly, Draco reaches for Potter’s hand… running his thumb across the raised lines that he knows spells out “I must not tell lies”… in silver now.
That first day… He remembers Weasley’s calm voice telling him he was okay… and how every time Weasley repeated it, he
Draco’s arms… his body… his lips pressed against his forehead… against is scar… It is only Draco that is keeping him from flying apart completely.
He lifted his head, only to realize that standing was out of the question; he would have to crawl. He was stiff and everything hurt. His back felt crusty in places and sticky in others.
“I believe you.” Harry sounds concerned, worried, even, but he just pulls Draco closer. He presses his lips to Draco’s forehead… an unending kiss.
When the Floo chimes, Fleur doesn’t look particularly surprised to see Draco sitting in my kitchen. She looks tired and her usual golden glow has a faint silver tinge to it. But she doesn’t look like she’s had bad news, either.
Waiting for the Polyjuice to force him into someone else’s body, waiting for the next client to come through the door… will they be gentle or will they hurt him? What will they want from him? What will they
it when I was living with my aunt and uncle. They were really always against anything different, you know? Magic, of course. But also gay people, people with messy hair, motorbikes… I’ve always wanted one.”
He wants to say, thank you. But he can’t. A squeeze like the crush of Elladora’s silencing curse grips his throat.
Harry is a mess—his jeans and sweatshirt have stains all over them… grease and other unnamable bits of grit, he has dirt in his hair after having spent a considerable amount of time on the floor trying to unstick the bike’s stopping mechanism, and his hands, the side of his nose, a bit of his forehead, and his left cheekbone, are all black.
They’re standing at the edge of a cliff. Draco doesn’t know what’s at the bottom; Harry doesn’t care.
“You have to be careful that everything is smooth when you iron it,” she explained… patiently, for once. “Otherwise, you’ll just be ironing
A year… a lifetime… of emotion crashes down on Harry. Wave after wave… he can’t catch his breath… he’s drowning…
Harry raises his eyes. They hurt… and are swollen and feel like they are full of sand. Draco’s eyes are molten iron.
Harry can feel each heartbeat in his chest, each reluctant squeeze. Like an overworked muscle, one that is too tired to carry on. “Why’d you let me, then?”
“It’ll be Egypt and Portugal this year,” Draco says, joining the conversation on Antonie’s side. “Portugal’s too good. There is no way Romania can beat them.”
“It’s fascinating—the differences between wizards and Muggles. You wouldn’t think it, of course, because physically we’re nearly identical… but magically… it’s fascinating! Can Muggle techniques improve wizarding medicine? Is there any way healing spells could be modified to help Muggles?” Draco’s not lecturing anymore, and the words run, most unprofessionally, together. “I’ve been studying…”
and marshals them all into obedience. He has to hurry if he’s going to get two shirts ironed in time.
The Dark Lord is holding court in the drawing room and there are Death Eaters in the hall… loud and vulgar and, frankly, terrifying, but if Draco slips out of the drawing room through his mother’s parlor, and then up the back staircases, there are only three dark passageways between him and the safety of his bedroom.
Ron understood that. He’d understood it since his very first year at Hogwarts. And it seemed that Regulus, Death Eater and Slytherin, had understood it too...
“I… Thank you, sir. But I have my dog with me today.” He gestures to Lisbeth, who is peering around his knee.
Draco’s tongue brushes his lower lip… teasing… begging, I think. We can have leftover takeaway tonight. I’ll cook for him
Harry isn’t breathing. It would be impossible… sacrilegious… to interrupt the music—even to draw breath.
Harry falls silent. And Draco remembers how he used to think Harry constantly sought out attention… how jealous he had been… how he used to relentlessly tease Harry.
“Yeah…” Harry frowns. “Might need a shower, really. And probably to toss these pants into the laundry. Do you want to go first?”
The spark of hope that had momentarily lit the boy’s eyes disappeared and everything about him sort of crumbled. “Thank you, sir. I’m sure your… attentions… would be preferable.”
The house he’s standing in seems to be a perfect marriage of the two extremes: It’s neither sprawling, nor tiny, and it has quite a large garden, but stands at the edge of the sort of village that looks like it bustles during the daytime. There’s a sturdiness to the house, but not a sternness, and the thick stone walls and ancient beams are softened with warm wood and shabby, but authentic, Oriental rugs.  The fire in the living room fireplace crackles merrily. Across the hall, in the dining room, a large table, solid but unadorned, sits in shadows—expectant, but not lonely.
is… Harry, I don’t know if you can safely terminate the pregnancy… but whatever you decide… you don’t have to do it alone.” Draco pulls their joined hands to his lips and places a gentle kiss on Harry’s knuckles. “Okay?”
The words are ancient, the sentiment archaic… and the whole thing, Draco thinks, is just really fucking unfair.
Draco shakes his head and Harry’s mouth descends… slowly, carefully. So gentle… so much longing. It is a first kiss.
Peaky. He’s exhausted. It’s not yet nine, and he’s scheduled ‘til three. He’ll never make it. He went to bed early last night, too.

… probably a man he has known since childhood… Draco takes his seat. He forces himself to eat his eggs, to spread marmalade on his toast, to drink his tea. Just like any other morning.
Hanging above the upright piano is a screen that Draco is fairly sure is the telly—he might be wrong, though, because he thinks he remembers something about televisions being boxes, so it might be the small box is sitting on the piano, under the screen. A tray on the small box slides out and Potter puts something round, flat, and shiny onto it. Then the box slurps up the tray and disk alike and begins to whirr gently.
They’ll cuddle after, and Cuthbert Mockridge will stroke his face and tell him how beautiful he is and ask him if he liked it, and Draco will lie so very prettily, and Mockridge will smile and promise to see Draco again soon.
Draco’s words came out sounding almost matter-of-fact, but his hands are shaking violently as he brings the mug to his mouth.
Draco believes him. “Don’t,” he says. “Really.” Draco’s head falls forward into his hands. “I don’t want you to. I just want to put it all behind me and never think about it again.”
Draco hears himself sigh as he pulls his fingers gently across Potter’s cheek… and away. “My time isn’t my own.”
“I can’t,” he admits. “I could never. You’ve been hurt too much… by too many people… People who were supposed to love you… protect you… Harry, I can’t be one of them.”
Draco is not going to lie to Harry Potter. Not again. Not ever again. “What if I can’t?” he asks, finally giving voice to his very real fear. “What if I can’t
“Will you sleep in my bed… and hold my hand when we’re out… and brew my Pepperup Potion so I don’t poison myself?”
She takes two steps into the room, long blond braids bouncing, bright green and white striped tie peeking out from under her grey pinafore. I wonder what Bill thinks about the green. Draco, I suppose, loves it. “Uncle Harry? Dra—er… Mr. Malfoy?”
Draco is sure he can’t move, but he feels his ribs, his hipbones, pressing into Harry and tries to pull away.
It doesn’t take long before Harry is shuddering and coming, gripping Draco’s hips with bruising fingers. Draco doesn’t mind;
for the first time in… he doesn’t know how long. Not since he’s been on the Muggle streets… not since he was chased from the Wizarding World, ducking curses, both uttered slurs and very real, very dangerous spells… not since he was in Azkaban, awaiting trial… Not since the Dark Lord invaded his home.
“This is kidnapping, you know.” His hand is still on Potter’s arm, and he thinks he can walk, maybe, five steps without falling over. Climbing the stairs is out of the question.
“No. But it feels… I don’t know. Evil. All I know is that Kreacher brought it to my mother. Regulus had asked Kreacher to destroy it, but he couldn’t. He thought, maybe, she could, but… she couldn’t either.”
Macnair wasn’t really there, taking him unprepared, taking pleasure from his pain… and yet he screamed anyway. He screamed for him to stop…. Draco could
For a moment they are just Potter and Malfoy glaring at each other… and it is the most wonderful, most
believe that he had been tortured… starved. Malfoy had always been thin, but now he was damn near emaciated, all bone and haunted eyes.
, which she says she doesn’t want back—he gathers the inscription from Molly Weasley, noting how it’s a wife’s duty to keep her husband well-fed and how she marked out some of Weasley’s favorites, might have something to do with it.
There was blood now, but still the boy refused to scream; he just pressed his forehead to the stone that marked his grandfather’s final resting place and waited for the lash to fall.
Draco usually falls asleep in Harry’s arms… but tonight he holds Harry close, letting him snuggle into his chest. Draco strokes his hair and kisses his forehead, watching him drift, slowly, towards sleep.
Her name is Lisbeth. He knows it like he knows his own name. Like he knows she is coming home with them.
Charlie pulls his mouth off Harry’s cock, his mouth glistening like lip gloss. “If you don’t like something, Harry, you have to
Harry held Draco’s hands against his chest… over his heart and let the other boy rest his forehead against his own. He couldn’t even guess how long they stood like that.
I know he’s changed. I’ve seen him be kind and funny and none of the things I associate with the Draco Malfoy I knew before the war. I think, maybe, I didn’t know him at all… before.
Draco doesn’t know how long Harry held him… carefully encouraging Draco to let wave after wave of emotion wash over them both. Hours, at least, until exhaustion pulled Draco into sleep.
Harry who spills all over his hand and trembles in his arms and leans up to kiss him, bruising and being bruised.
Harry tried. He really did. But his tiny fingers were too small, too uncoordinated, and he always pulled them away too soon.
know, but he nods intelligently. He’s of the opinion that the shiny red one that Harry’s gaze lingers over would suit him perfectly.
are cast on it. Harry lies on it, his fingers intertwined with Draco’s, as their last few minutes tick by. Part of Draco can’t stand to see him there, on the bed where so many have been… and part of Draco wishes he would never leave.
and Malfoy’s wrists were bound behind his back. Ron recoiled slightly at the look of betrayal in Malfoy’s eyes… all the more so because he didn’t complain or even comment.
He watches Malfoy, who could not be dissuaded from seeing him safely home, scan the room. “You have a piano?” he asks. “You can play the piano?”
The woman at the counter is the sweet, not-quite-regular who always calls him “dear” and asks if he’s feeling all right. Today she doesn’t ask. Instead she tells him she’s going to sit down and asks him to bring her coffee over when it’s ready.
A number of Draco’s most secret fourth-year fantasies are quietly entangling themselves around his current nightmare.
too hard to explain. The lie lies heavy on his tongue, coating it like rancid oil… a film that cannot be swallowed away.
an oversight… isn’t likely to be life-threatening; anything in the Wizarding world can be cleared up with a course of nasty-tasting potions… but Charlie always cast protection charms anyway.
Weasley releases him, and Draco turns, heading for his bedroom. For the chair by the window. For safety.
The spell will fade long before the bruise does, but for now it is enough that his cheek has stopped throbbing with each heartbeat.
He was expected to attend the trial of every Death Eater… and testify against them, even the ones he didn’t know and had no personal evidence against. He spent so many grueling days in the Ministry depths. He testified
“We’ll come visit, and you and Draco will come visit us. And it’s not as if we’re moving out tomorrow, Harry. There’s quite a bit of work to do on the place before we can live there.”
Harry climbs into the chair, under the horrible blanket, and Draco thinks Weasley enlarges the chair a bit more. As soon as Draco feels Harry’s arms around him, he falls asleep.
Draco cried until his bones felt liquid. He cried until his eyes burned and he could barely breathe.
In truth, he didn’t handle it very well and had to cancel his next appointment because he couldn’t stop vomiting. Elladora was
It was decided that Draco, with his moonbeam hair, alabaster skin, and eyes like molten silver should spend his time working as a high-end prostitute.
The shivering is no match for the warmth radiating from Harry’s body, and the tears stop as quickly and inexplicably as they started. Draco snuggles into Harry, feeling safe, feeling loved. His eyes fall shut without his permission. He doesn’t want to sleep… but it has been a long day, and sleep tugs at him.
“How did you get here?” another voice asked. Weasley’s; it had to be, though Draco couldn’t bring himself to look. That meant Granger was here somewhere, too.
And ever since Draco helped Bill with some tricky translation of an ancient text he needed to break a particularly nasty curse… they’ve been meeting occasionally for drinks. Even Ron’s gone a few times. Even Hermione.
“And a good cushioning charm, just in case,” Harry says, sweeping his tongue across Draco’s mouth… demanding… no
Hermione had gone upstairs to the room they now shared, but Ron followed Harry and Malfoy into the bedroom that had once been his and Harry’s. Apparently it was now
Harry remembers being happy—this small connection between him, his aunt, and his unknown grandmother—who was also the mother of
“Possible pregnancy,” he mutters, gaze firmly affixed on Harry’s stomach. He casts a charm without asking. “Pregnancy confirmed.”
He picks up Harry’s hand, which still smells faintly orangey, even after the cleaning charm, and brings it to his mouth. In proper courtly form, he kisses the backs of Harry’s fingers before turning his hand over to press his lips into his palm.
from every Muggle author in existence. He spends his time trying to keep track of them, to remember his favorites, and note the similarities and differences of the authors.
Harry actually has no idea when exams are. He did think about getting a Muggle degree in… well, he didn’t know what, exactly… partly to pass the time. But, eventually, he decided against it. He doesn’t
Professor Hastings is pressing a series of buttons and then requesting Miss Weasley join him in his office.
“You have to please me?” There’s a thread of anticipation running through Potter’s voice. “You have to do whatever I want?”
It’s less of a shock and more of a slowly dawning realization that he, too, is naked. Which makes sense, of course. But he finds the idea of striding… naked… across the room to receive a cup of coffee from a man he doesn’t know… disconcerting.
Severus stopped dead, suddenly seeing, not the child, but the man he had become. For one, horrifying moment Severus imagined fine strong limbs spread out before him, steel grey eyes looking up at him with lust.
Draco’s palm aches to touch flesh, and he has just about resolved to do it when a snake of dread crawls up from his belly and his hand jerks back, quite without his permission.
The first time Charlie kisses him, his strawberry blond stubble scratching softly, his lips achingly gentle, Harry feels…
“Don’t worry. I won’t leave you this time,” he says, his voice measured and crisp. “I can’t survive on what Mr. Ainsworth is paying me. And if I’m going to be
There was a bit of an outcry, but in the end everyone still wanted him on their boards, to head their charities, to speak at their functions.
Half an hour later the Granger-Weasley family has gone home and Draco is alone in the bookshop. He walks through it one last time. Everything is in order, of course. The children’s section is immaculate, not that he ever doubted Rose.
Draco’s hand is in Harry’s. Or Harry’s hand is in his. Their fingers are laced, palm to palm, and Draco has no idea who reached for whom, or even when it happened. They might have been standing there all afternoon, just staring and holding hands.
Blaise… Draco takes a moment to wonder if his attacker was, somehow, encouraged by the idea that he had spent the last half of fifth year snogging Blaise in secluded corners all over the castle. Their relationship wasn’t exactly common knowledge… but it wasn’t a secret either.
“You never had a sore throat and the doctor gave you bubblegum flavored medicine to take three times a day?” Draco’s tone is light.
The vision faded quickly, but not before a sick jolt of anticipation left Harry with very little hope that he would stay that way.
She tells him she has a small cottage just outside of Compiègne and asks him to visit. He tells her he will come soon. He is lying… but he wishes he wasn’t.
Harry’s hands are on the waistband of his trousers, the tips of his fingers barely slipped inside. “There’s something I want to try. Will you let me?” he asks.
Potter is leading him up slightly uneven stairs, the polished wood of the banister warm and smooth under his hand, to a landing. Two doors are shut, another door leads to the bath, and the last to a room with a large bed made up with a white comforter. A huge brownish cat is curled on one of the pillows.
“Good,” Draco replied, and pressed his face back against Harry’s chest, though he was no longer sure who was holding whom.
He has been taller and more muscular than he could have ever hoped to be, for some inexplicable reason he has been short, fat and bald a number of times. He did marvel at his body the day it turned the color of polished ebony.
I’m not sure of the dress code required for picking up a child from school, so I changed out of my trainers (hence the clicking) and traded my bulky (and admittedly covered in clay) jumper for neat pullover and sport coat. I even ran a comb through my hair… for all the good
“I’ll find you. I promise,” Harry say, kissing him gently as the chime, signaling the end of his hour, rings.
An old piano stands along one wall, currently supporting Harry’s meager library. According to his landlady, someone left it behind ages ago. The flat is four floors up—it’s stayed.
“I need to get going. Do you want me to come back in the morning? I can take Victoire to school… save you the trouble of crossing London.”
The man waives it away, looking deeply uncomfortable, but resolved. “I don’t know what to say, except… it will get better. I know it doesn’t feel like it right now, but it will. I’ve been there. Those edges that are cutting you open right now… someday they won’t be as sharp.”
He lets Charlie wrap him in blankets and sit him before the fire, lets Charlie bring him tea and earthy stews made from root vegetables and warm spices. He watches the flames dance and tries not to think about the Fiendfyre and Draco Malfoy’s hand… so sweaty—
The woman behind the counter has abandoned her blue stripes and dyed all her hair a vivid pink. “Cappuccino, love?” she asks him.
He gives in to the sensations, moving with them, letting them carry him, like one does when swimming in a heavy sea: don’t fight, breathe only when your head is above water.
“Do you remember when Dean locked himself in his room for a week. Or when Parvati used to wake us all up screaming in… what was that Hindi?”
Something uncomfortable… something sharp with rough edges… is twisting through his heart. He tells himself that this is what he wanted. That he feels
“He’s not a Death Eater and he’s not bothering me,” Harry says as firmly as possible under the circumstances.
Draco makes a soft noise… drawing Potter’s attention—not that it could possibly be anywhere else—to him. With fingers that he cannot keep from trembling, Draco slides the topmost button of his overcoat slowly out of its button-hole. He spreads the fabric slightly to reveal milky skin, collarbones that he
“Not ‘til the end of summer, at least, though,” Weasley says. “There’s a lot of work to be done on it, yeah? The bath won’t do and the kitchen’s a mess and most of the wallpaper makes the wallpaper at Grimmauld Place look bright and cheery.”
“You’ve been looking into his mind again, haven’t you?” Luckily they were still whispering; Ron didn’t think messing about in You-Know-Who’s head was exactly a brilliant idea, but Hermione was rabidly opposed to it.
Somehow his hand is still in Harry’s hair and he uses it to hold him still for a kiss that is as rough as it is tender. “I love you, too,” he says.
Draco pulls his hand free, turning his arm over. The Dark Mark hasn’t faded. Obvious black lines, a symbol of hate, are etched forever into his arm. Draco drags a finger across it.
“Not bad, Malfoy,” he says, dropping a few notes on the ground, “I might even come back for another go.”
Narcissa had turned guileless blue eyes up for the Dark Lord’s probing and he received nothing for his efforts.
“When I was a kid… sometimes if I couldn’t eat dinner… I’d wait until the Dursleys were asleep and then sneak into the kitchen to make sandwiches. Lots of time it was just cold ham and cheese or something, but if I could… toasty meatloaf sandwiches were my favorite.”
There’s a mist in the air… not really enough to wet the passersby, not enough to wet Potter, but it’s seeping through Draco’s ragged sweatshirt and into his skin. Into his bones... into his scars.
He tastes of wine… of unhappiness… and he makes a small noise, opening his mouth for Draco to deepen the kiss.
taken his hand the one time it had really mattered, hadn’t he? He had flown out of the fire and death like an avenging angel, his eyes blazing through the sea of smoke and flame, his hand stretched out… for Draco.
Kingsley wanted his support to become the Minister of Magic… and then wanted him to assure the public that the danger was over, to convince people that the Ministry was no longer serving the interests of the Death Eaters. The Aurors wanted him to join their ranks without a single qualification and no training.
He is also wearing Gryffindor flannel pants and a horribly clashing sweatshirt that appears to say “West Ham”… though, while he is pleased to have formed the letters into two identifiable words, they
Weasley always seemed to take up more room than strictly necessary. “I definitely don’t want him in my jeans. Don’know if Harry feels quite the same way, though.”
“I need to go,” he says. He touches her hand for the smallest fraction of a second. “Will you tell Harry?”
He doesn’t. He just gives Harry a long look before climbing in beside him. Harry reaches out a hand, catching Draco’s, interlacing their fingers.
, yes, just like other spells, but they also need the magic of the person being healed. Healing spells just won’t
His shirt was open at the throat, but the sleeves were rolled down and buttoned tight, the Dark Mark hidden. In the dark of the pub, his eyes were the color of an unsettled nighttime sea, his hair glowing like light from a beacon. The kind of beacon you would use to find your way home if you were lost at sea.
Draco watches the flames and listens to Harry breathing. Either or both of them might have fallen asleep. Draco loses feeling in both legs… still he doesn’t move. He just holds Harry close.
“We could have grown up friends, maybe… practically cousins…,” Potter said, somehow landing on the most irrelevant thing Draco had just said.
I roll back over and close my eyes and tell myself that Potter is an eighteen-year-old wizard, more than capable of fighting through his own nightmares. It’s not true though and a moment later, I’m flinging back my own blankets and padding into the common room.
Draco is not going to argue; the day didn’t start out cold, but a chill has settled into his bones and an eerie mist has settled over the moors. He casts a cleaning charm on his hands which is almost completely ineffective… and he finds himself staring at his own hands, black and grimy.
“Then you can’t.” Harry says it calmly, as if Draco hasn’t confessed his darkest secret, his most terrifying fear. “It’s okay.”
Barefoot, and mostly glitter-free, Draco walks down the stairs… to find Potter sitting on the couch in the living room. Potter’s made a huge bowl of popcorn and set out a bottle of wine and two glasses. He’s leafing through a Quidditch magazine and nibbling at the popcorn with a slightly guilty set to his shoulders… as if he feels like he should be waiting for Draco but can’t quite resist the buttery kernels.
“Draco, don’t.” Weasley’s eyes are soft, though his voice is firm. “Don’t go into that room. Go into the garden. Or the kitchen. Go somewhere where
?” He can feel the words, warm and slightly damp, through the fabric. His erection strains towards Harry.
“We’ll figure it out. If you won’t go to St. Mungo’s, will you at least go to a Muggle doctor? I can take you to the office I’m working at this month. Maybe… I don’t know… maybe you have an underlying infection. Maybe even from this.” Draco picks up his hand, running his fingers over the completely healed cut. “I checked you for everything I can think of… but maybe I missed something… maybe a blood test…”
Draco grasped the arms attached to those hands and held on, his grip bruising, as every scream of pain… of anger… of betrayal… was ripped from him. Every scream he had refused to utter forced its way out.
It was broken by the appearance of a house-elf who shouted, “Master Draco!” and rushed to prostrate itself at his feet. “Kreacher is honored to serve a member of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black!”
“Probably.” Potter doesn’t move either. If anything, his fingers tighten slightly on Draco’s. “This was nice,” he says.
He is fed, he is clothed, and the light that comes into his cell is natural and tinted with salt and seaweed. His guards are human and they are not unkind.
“I know.” The corners of Weasley’s eyes crinkle a bit when he smiles. “But that’s the thing, right? You
For a moment his eyes blaze again, then Harry Potter disappears down the hall, and Draco looks at what he has given him. It is a peach.
“I’ll let you vomit on that man’s shoes if you like. Your choice.” If Draco was trying for a joke, he failed. The words come out tight.
to please you tonight,” Draco says softly, gaining back just a little of his self-control. “I’ll do whatever you want… and you’ll
slowly, Draco moves his mouth toward Harry’s. Harry is still. He doesn’t move and he doesn’t blink, and when their lips meet, the kiss is sweet and chaste.
it was a pretty brief thing, mostly the result of a sloppily preformed translation charm. On one of the Christian texts, you know.”
“Yeah… We were going to say it… soon… but… maybe I’ll just tell you now. Harry’s going to have fits, of course…”
Thank you all for reading!!! As always, questions, comments, and constructive criticism are always very welcome!
Luna materializes out of nowhere. “Seamus,” she says, her voice floating, “I don’t think Draco wants to be touched right now.” She gently removes Finnegan’s hand from his shoulder.
He really has chosen all my favorites. The wine is light and white, and with a practiced wand movement, Draco has added just the right amount of chill.
“Of course I will.” For a moment she’s quiet, thinking probably. Already planning. “Are you thinking of using Malfoy Manor?” she asks.
The door pushes open, slowly. Not the way a client comes into the room, but rather as though it really is
I just want him to want to see me as much as I want to see him. I don’t want what we had last night to be a one-time thing.
Weasley pulls a blanket out of the chest at the foot of the bed, inspects it closely, gives his wand the gentle wave of a cleaning spell, and then another, more vigorous and it becomes a violent shade of orange which clashes horribly with… well everything. The Chudley Cannons.
“And Master Regulus loved Miss Cissy! He said she was like a ray of sunshine when his life was at its darkest!”
The mess is everywhere, slippery and cooling on both their stomachs, the sheets, on Draco’s hand, and inside Harry’s pajamas. Their wands are out of reach and Harry slides away from Draco… to reach for his wand… his abandoned tee-shirt… anything to clean it up…
“Now, I’ll just need you to fill out this form, and then I’ll call for Miss Weasley. We’re near the end of our day, so you can take her straight from here… save the confusion of the regular dismissal time.”
Draco is shaking so hard his teeth are chattering and he burrows into Harry’s chest, feeling his strong arms coming around him, feeling his lips press against his temple.
He is at the end of the second passage, the noises in the downstairs hall becoming distinct again… only a few doors, really, from his bedroom... when he feels rough hands grab him.
“Thanks.” Ron reached out and was unnerved at Malfoy’s flinch. He gave the bonds an experimental tug. “They aren’t too tight, are they?”
happy. But if you’re doing something that hurts you or scares you or even that you just don’t want to do…. Draco, that will

manage to respond, and for a moment no one said anything and a heavy, uncomfortable silence filled the hall.
“Terrible news,” Mr. Hastings says, his eyes nearly liquid with concern. “Please tell Mrs. Weasley that her family will be in our prayers—and if there’s anything we can do, of course.”
Harry drops to his knees, pushing aside the flimsy robe that is all the clothing Draco really has, and takes him into his mouth.
Draco eats the toast and sips the tea, his hands shaking: It is the fourth day, and he has decided to go downstairs.
“The world won’t end, Draco, if we’re a couple of minutes late to this stupid thing. What is it, the tenth one this month?”
He’s never noticed before, they are so pale, but Draco’s eyelashes are long enough brush his cheeks, and he has a little freckle, high on one cheekbone.
As always, your kudos, thoughts, questions, and constructive criticism are always very welcome! ~ Blessings
! Had he used protection spells? Unlikely in the presence of a Muggle. There is no evidence of a condom.
He was rubbing his wrists… Ron had used soft ropes and they hadn’t been on for more than moments. His wrists couldn’t be hurting him. Harry stopped the motions with gentle hands.
Hermione calls it “what if” history… and says there’s no real point to it. She always touches the inside of her forearm when she says it, though; it’s barely visible anymore… where his aunt carved the word “mudblood” into her arm. What if he had done something—anything—
She stares haughtily down at him before blinking twice and letting out a low hoot. Harry decides that is a
Draco was aware that his lungs weren’t functioning properly; he couldn’t seem to catch his breath. He was aware that his legs wouldn’t support his weight. One of his arms was in his father’s grasp; he wasn’t sure who held the other. He knew he was being dragged from outside to inside, down one set of stairs, then another.
“I know a good cleaning charm.” Draco can hear the smile in Harry’s words. “Please. I want you to come for me.”
“Thank you.” Draco pauses a moment, wondering just how far Potter’s generosity stretches. “Do you think I could borrow your shower first? It’s just that the glitter… it itches!”
… well that was what he was raised to do. Etiquette, conversation, the art of charisma… they were bred into his very bones.
The light in the white, windowless room was bright, but it was a suffocating, unnatural bright… white and raw, not golden like sunlight or candlelight. Draco blinks and he is back in the room… waiting.
Harry kisses him. Deeply. As if he is chasing the taste of himself on Draco’s tongue. “Oh my god, I love you,” Harry says. “You don’t know how much I love you.”
“But…” Draco’s argument dies unsaid. He means it: Harry Potter does not tell lies. He replaces his hand on Harry’s cheek. “I love you.”
Lisbeth enters the bookshop at a half crouch, nose working overtime, and investigates the entire first floor before curling up, with one eye open, behind the counter.
Draco moans again, this time sounding of hurt and frustration… and Harry recognizes it as such. “We’ll get there, Draco. We will.” Harry’s fingers are light on his cheek. “I know what you’re thinking… and if I was
“You do realize that I can’t actually kiss you here in the schoolyard?” It’s not quite his professional voice, but at least it’s one suitable for use in public. It wasn’t, I realize. Before.
to take the Dark Mark… that he is not an evil wizard. He talks about how he lowered his wand on the Astronomy Tower and how he didn’t betray them at Malfoy Manor. He reminds the court that he used
At Draco’s soft encouragement, Lisbeth obligingly sniffs Harry’s hand; he doesn’t try to touch her, and she doesn’t try to bite him. “I agree. Completely,” Harry says.
It may be that he really is the only one who knows that he was raped in the dark halls of his own home… and if this information is something that Draco still keeps for himself, he is not going to give it away.
Harry’s hands are clever and gentle. He imagines them touching him… everywhere… in all of the places he hasn’t allowed
… on the way his bones are beautifully fragile beneath his fingers, on the way his arm is trembling in his hands… on the way his eyes are wide and afraid and hopeful… Harry leans forward and presses his lips through the Dark Mark and onto the skin below.
“Harry.” He forces the word past unused vocal cords, past the familiar choking feeling. It sounds harsh, painful. It
owl, she’s Draco’s, so that helps. She’s a smallish Tawney who doesn’t like to be petted and often stares down her beak at him. In a way, she reminds Harry of a thirteen-year-old Draco Malfoy… and he finds that oddly comforting.
from the shower, Potter.” Draco can feel his mouth twisting into a smile that is more than half smirk. “And I’m not entirely sure that it wouldn’t be pointless.”
He would have to find a way to get the Sword of Gryffindor to them… but now was not the time for that.
Weasley nods, turning back toward the house.  Draco takes two steps with him before pausing, pretending to see a weed poking through the lavender.
“Oh… Okay.” She is still looking at me, her eyes now wary. “Do you even know how to take care of me?”
“Merlin’s fu—f—falling down pants,” he says. First he rescues the sausages, then he rescues Victoire.
… when Draco kissed people because he wanted to. Because he wanted to share their touch, to feel their mouth on his, their breath mingling with his own.
The idea of hurting Harry makes him feel sick and it is that, even more than Harry half sitting, half collapsing onto the ottoman, his face dropping into his hands, that deflates his anger. “Oh fuck,” Harry says again, his voice little more than a whisper.
Draco kneels to pull weeds while Lisbeth lies down in the sunshine, her head resting on outstretched paws. She’s not asleep and her dark eyes are alert and watchful.
