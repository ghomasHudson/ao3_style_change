Dumbledore glared past Harry's shoulder, and a sudden clatter of shoes turned Harry around in time to see Seymour and Ruthven disappearing down the dungeon stairs.
While Harry was puzzling that out, Shacklebolt turned to Remus. "Sir. I will see Mr. Potter safely inside, but this is an active investigation, and the school is closed to visitors."
Draco scowled. Harry smiled apologetically back. It wasn't like he was a Slytherin, after all; Draco couldn't expect constant subterfuge.
"I'm afraid you'll need to be more specific." At the look that passed between the two, he sighed. He was probably going about this all wrong. "Look," he said. "I don't have some grand unified plot. If you want to know the point of something I did, you'll need to tell me what it was."
It would have been easy to talk to Draco after their Transfiguration tutorial, but now that he had permission, he thought his sense of urgency may have been exaggerated by feeling like he didn't have any options. Unlike the day before, Hermione had been easy to avoid. On that evening, she studied by herself in a corner, Ron argued with Ginny by the chess table, and Harry sat with Seamus and Parvati. None of them claimed the sofa by the fire that they used to share.
The door chimed its warning, and Carla entered, Hannah behind her. Harry was reminded of Linnet running into Julian, and wondered if a more subtle use of herding had been involved there. Carla hesitated less than Julian had, and advanced toward the circle with her head high, ignoring food and flowers until Hannah caught her arm.
"Oh." Her eyes widened a little, he suspected more from the look on his face than from the words. The memory was still vivid in his mind.
"It wasn't supposed to work like this!" Harry protested. "And she was asking about Millicent, and I couldn't--" Harry stopped, swallowing. Draco's eyes were still wide with astonishment, but his mouth settling into a scowl. "I've got this backwards. I should tell you about Millicent first."
a secret, and not monitored, you know -- people should be able to take care of themselves. It's all gone very well, though, so we might consider lower years after Christmas."
Harry found that a bit strange to contemplate, but he nodded, and soon found himself with a glass of milk that tasted like the milk at Hogwarts or the Burrow -- good, but not at all like milk at the Dursley's. He looked up and found Sirius drinking some as well.
"This was when I got back from Veritaserum interview.  I didn't want to go upstairs, but I didn't want to leave Hermione and Ron worrying. I heard a bunch of kids thundering up the stairs and thought I'd send a message with one, then when they came into sight they were all Slytherins."  He shrugged. "But Gentian and I had spoken before, a few times, so I decided to risk asking anyway."
The Slytherin first-year girl from the night before was waiting in the hallway. Harry gave her a smile as he waved her in.
He checked their spying mirror at the door, which showed the view from the larger one outside, but no one appeared to be waiting. Harry wasn't sure the view would catch a tabby cat by the wall, but there was nothing more he could do. He opened the door, and he and Hermione slipped out into an empty corridor.
Draco sighed. "Barbaric spectacle," he explained. "Pansy, he's quite right. It's their hallmark. Although I haven't heard of them using this particular act before, I also would have assumed Death Eaters from the exhibition of a victim." His hand fell from her shoulder. "Perhaps we should move back to the beginning. Harry?"
"Eh." Draco shrugged. "That's what you're here for, right? And I'm not wrong. I was worried about Harry;
"Hermione!" Draco exclaimed, and Harry twisted to see Hermione standing at the next table back, clutching his school bag as well as her own.
Harry shrugged. "Why would I? I went to Gryffindor, and that grew what they value. But you can't deny I'm madly curious, and the last year with you has definitely made me more studious, so I
Remembering the water, he licked his lips. There had been something in it. Maybe he did have some resistance. Maybe she had had some warning that it would all go wrong.
Harry stared back. "You don't think that's a little suspicious? You're suddenly the ideal person to leave them with? Dumbledore arranged it, I'm sure. Either I break up with you, or he knows if I've been doing Dark Arts."
"Well, yeah. Though if he'd been a bit less authoritarian about it, we might have cleared Sirius that night." At Hermione's glare, Harry sighed. "Don't get me wrong. It was
"Letting him know how to adapt," Creevy said quickly. "I suppose it would be someone from the Slytherin team." He thought. "Or Thornton."
Harry hated Azkaban. Even now, years after their departure, the gloom of Dementors clung to it like the mold he could see when the guard's swinging lantern splashed light on the base of the wall. Their power for sapping will was gone, however, and the darkness that remained just made him angry.
good." He let go of Severus's erection and reached for one of the things he had brought from the other room. "Now, I'm going to put a harness on you. Just let the straps tighten -- they know where to go." A whispered charm, and the heap of leather began to move, like an untangling nest of snakes. They slithered across Severus, one encircling each thigh, and two connecting straps unfolded to let another wind around his waist. Smooth brass buckles tightened on each.
," he said daringly, and a hand stroked up his thigh and settled at his hip, one finger stroking over the dip above the bone. For some reason, this made everything more intense, and more of his thoughts stilled. He knew --
a party. I forgive you the offense against my family, Mr. Parkinson. I'm sure it will have quite have slipped my mind by the end of the evening."
Ginny grinned, but didn't play along. "You just find the seam and pinch it between your thumb and forefinger. Then you can pull it right off. You can also make it just a little larger that way."
She stood up, using the movement to cover a check on her wand -- up her sleeve and ready to drop out, point first.
"But it does!" Draco insisted, gesturing angrily at the beautiful room. "It's the Malfoy midwinter ball! It's supposed to be white and gold!"
Harry felt a jolt of mingled hope and fear. Auror business could be about Sirius, which could be either very good, or very bad.  "And he couldn't come himself before then?"
The man snorted, but he looked more interested now. "Sixty G apiece," he answered. "If I can get 'em.  All up front."
When she tipped the hideous glop into his mouth, that seemed unbelievable, but her wand was at his neck, and thick slime oozed steadily down his throat. He couldn't even grimace until her wand lifted away.
Severus looked thoughtful for a moment, and then his face twisted.  "Rabastan had this sport," he said quickly.
Ron was staring, mesmerized, at the vial. Harry leaned forward to wave a hand in front of his face. "You in there, Ron?"
Out in the hallway, Millicent looked significantly at the door. "People will be listening, you know."
"What in Merlin's name is the meaning of this?" Professor Snape demanded. He strode forward, wand out. Draco looked again at the way the bonds pulled Potter's arms up tight and stretched out his torso. Dropping lower, his eyes searched the folds of Harry's trousers, imagining he was hard beneath them. There wouldn't usually be a wide line just there, would there?
"Again, I believe we're talking about a twelve-year-old, and during a year that sort of behavior was being actively incited."
"Ah." Snape's arms unfolded, and his hands came down to the desktop at either side of his thin frame. "'Luck' is a tricky element to alter, even for short periods of time. Such curses -- and potions -- exist, but they are expensive to the caster. Think about what I told you, Harry, about what the Dark Arts require. What would a curse of bad luck take from you?"
be softer, but it's not as if I'll be trying to sleep. Yes, I think it will do." A wicked smile seemed to say she was just teasing. "Take off your robes, Harry, and lie down."
to tell Professor Dumbledore," he said carefully. His eyes rolled to look at Draco. "But Malfoys is having bad secrets--"
"Yes. When I first met Tuktuk, I wanted to confess to Dumbledore, and do you remember what Draco said to Professor Horsyr, that time?"
Harry recalled the Potential Harassment by Department form he had been working on that morning. "Yeah, but I think I can't finish it -- my objectivity is shot. Would you review the folder and add your observations?"
Snape's office door was closed, but Draco seemed to have expected this. He sailed past without even a glance. Harry shrugged and kept up. A minute later they were in Snape's lab, with Draco quietly latching the door behind them.
will have no need to. If he does not, we can consider some other avenue of approach. Miss Bones of Hufflepuff, perhaps? Since her aunt is already in the opposition...."
"I'm surprised there haven't been dozens!"  Blaise said cheekily. "Although the portkey failing has probably staved off some, as has Professor Snape taking his side about it."
"You can't--" the boy tried, but Harry poked his head in, checking those closest for people he knew.
"You can--" Shacklebolt let out a harsh breath.  Harry belatedly regretted the words. "Professor Dumbledore has not mentioned this."
Harry found this overly dramatic, until he thought about the Harry that had preceded him. "Of course not," he assured him. "How's this? I won't treat you as a minion, and you won't treat me as a fool."
Harry forced himself not to thrash loose of the covers and the touch. What had happened? He had wished he'd never heard of Horcruxes, and the naked girl -- a nymph? No, wasn't it dryads that lived in trees? She had flowed out and
Harry's last letter from Auror Tonks had come, not from the MLE, but from Chameleon's Rock, Essex, and that was the address he used when writing to her. On Wednesday afternoon, after a grueling Cursebreaking exam, he settled in a comfy chair near the Gryffindor fire to read her reply.
Harry could hear the door opening again -- presumably the Ravenclaws. "Neville," he said quickly, "Introductions. Just for a fresh start, this is my boyfriend, Draco."
Zabini twitched at the sound of Parseltongue. When a torclinde wove its way from the sleeve of Harry's robes and wrapped around his arm, he sucked for a moment at his lip.
They decided on long, curved beads for the signals, to increase skin contact for the warmth that would alert them to a summons. They communally agreed that would be better than the bead lighting up. The challenges of
"And what of the identification of the ingredients?"  Snape challenged. "Such laxity goes both ways, you know."
After lessons on Friday, that was where they went. Harry had already sent word on to Gentian that he had an unplanned meeting with a professor and did not know how late it would go.
"It's not fair. I didn't even do anything; I just wasn't angry at you enough for him. And what is the point of that? Not talking to someone doesn't help anything."
"Prince," he muttered. "Only know one of those." In nervous twitches, he opened the door and found neatly creased dark trousers hanging beside white and silver-grey dress shirts and black school robes. A few brighter things were pushed to one side. On the shelf under the trousers was a shiny pair of low black boots with thin laces, and on the door, Slytherin ties and scarves hung softly next to stiff leather belts in black and grey. Shuddering, Harry took enough for an outfit and sat on the bed to dress.
"I had my first tutor at four." She glanced at him. "And it became one of my truest pleasures. Draco is quite good, is he not?"
Gradually, her frown cleared.  "All right. Maybe that's why mine tend to drift if I look in a mirror."
She beamed at him, and then, to his surprise, caught him in a rough hug, not letting up until he choked dramatically.
Harry snapped into place in a stiff brocade chair. Draco was at his side, and he was facing Professor Snape.
"Then we will try the ones below that. The dungeons go over that far. The chute needs to be between rooms on each level. There must be some way to get into it."
Quietly, Harry turned his bead green and silver. He was not surprised to see that all of his housemates had done the same. He reached past Ginny to tap Millicent's bead, adding gold flecks to the red she had managed, and she nodded curtly.
"Well," Snape said sourly, "whatever hidden craft got you into Slytherin in two worlds, you had better reach down deep and find it now. You are a person of some interest to many parties, and I
Draco looked unhappy, but he hadn't set his chin for a fight. "Yes. However, I still think you should have consulted me. And this summer I plan to host a party that is mine."
Smirking almost like his usual self, Malfoy did something that made the stretch more intense. At the same time, she started playing around Harry's cunt with her other hand. Harry shoved into both touches.  "Fuck. Please."
Gratefully, Harry took the glass and downed the rest of the water. It had a faint aftertaste of lemon. He decided to believe it was
Harry jerked back. It wasn't so much the idea of a knife at his head -- well, some fear of that was unavoidable, but he trusted Ron. It was--
"Esmée Sinclair," he read. "French born, but of a British father who stayed well away from British politics. Educated at Beauxbatons, where she is in her final year. Mother's family (Dumont) has good fertility, but father's--" He looked up. "Your mother researched how many kids her ancestors had?"
Snape sneered, either at the mention of Sirius or the tardy return to avoiding his name. "Tell him that it will be someone from the order."
She was still expecting him to name terms, he realized suddenly. He could blackmail her. Embarrassed, he flipped the hood of his cloak back over his head. "Come on, then. Buy your books and we'll go. The Leaky Cauldron will do."
Linnet smiled approvingly, even as she shook her head. “They would certainly prefer to, and the Ministry can always find some members of that population to say they will. But realistically, they don’t have the connections to Muggle governments to redirect commerce and tourism away from their population centers, never mind their hunting grounds.”
Accordingly, they spent much of the first day in the sitting room, reading.  Harry was relieved when it was time for him to make dinner. After dinner, he and Draco had sex -- mutual oral pleasure, for the most part. He deliberately did not look to see if Severus was watching or ignoring them.
Harry and Draco looked at each other. "Well," Harry said, "I'd gone down to Slytherin early to fetch Draco--"
The exercise was difficult. Harry could perceive Snape's magic readily enough. It shivered in the air like ozone after lightning. Accessing it was another matter entirely. After five unsuccessful attempts, he said that he didn't think the Dark Mark was connection enough.
"Yeah you, yeah more," Draco chanted, cried, and Harry hammered into him, memories and plans fading away into heat and constriction and scent and pleasure, and he roared as it surged, and panted as it faded, working at Draco until he followed after.
They heard the chime that Draco had added to the door after Hermione's first, sudden, Friday entrance. "Harry?" Ron's voice called. "You decent?"
"Since he already knows about the place, I don't see any harm. And I'd like to invite Ginny Weasley, as well, and Cornelia."
of Dark Arts, I would expect, but with elements of Darkness beyond his control." Draco shrugged. "Even Harry cannot approach them at some times -- when his scar flares, I believe, because the effect is more short-lived than use of Dark Arts."
They stumbled into the bedroom and onto the bed with Harry holding on to Draco's hand as if he might otherwise be drawn away to another world again.  On the bed, he finally got Draco's shirt open, and was able to stroke the clean lines of his chest and pinch his small, pale nipples larger and pinker. Suddenly, fabric blocked his view as Draco pulled his t-shirt up.
Harry had to revise that thought a minute later, when the Hufflepuff Chaser walked in with Ginny. He hadn't known that they knew each other, but he supposed they were in the same year, and so had probably taken classes together. In fact, Cadwallader put his schoolbag down on the seat nearest to Cornelia, on one end of the blue and white loveseat, before Ginny led him over to the refreshments.
Once they were alone, Dumbledore sat at the table, checked the teapot, tsked, and then gestured to the platter of sandwiches.
Before the whispers could resolve, they were interrupted by the arrival of the morning post. Owls swooped in with their burdens, and the previous discussion was put on hold as Harry and Hermione read the
Harry was shaking. "Chamber," Draco said, and led him down in silence. In the stone hall, he pulled him past their fuzzy plastic sofa and around the screen to their bed. Leaning against it, he drew Harry close, letting him hide his face. For several minutes the only sounds were slow breathing and the occasional drip of water.
He had to answer that with something, he realized. She would never stop being suspicious if he didn't. "Well," he said, "look after Draco for me? I mean, I can't protect him in Slytherin, and you're strong...."
Millicent had somehow managed to stay on the edge of the group, despite the attention she was getting. Harry doubted she was embarrassed. Probably she just didn't want anyone noticing that her body wasn't where it was supposed to be. He strode up to her without being blocked. She was huge in her padded Beater's robes. He didn't care.
"Oh, so I have I. You will note that I knew what 'their business' is." Draco crossed the room and sat next to Harry, but twisted to face him. "So, what do they want? A public endorsement?"
Eugene finished with the lotion, and then touched it here and there with a charm that spread out blended pink. Once he was satisfied with that, he got out some eyeliner. "Look down and hold still."
After a moment of squirming forward to extract himself from the pinned trousers, Draco started a hesitant crawl. Harry gave a little tug to give him his direction. "Come on, now. Head up!"
Silenced, the twins looked at each other. Harry felt suddenly awkward. "It was -- Draco feels I can use Voldemort's blood guilt against him, and build a protection. Remus thought the theory was sound, but he doesn't want me to do it until I leave school. He's afraid I'll go looking for trouble, or something, but really, Voldemort has found me enough times that I'd like to be prepared."
By the time Defense Against the Dark Arts was over, Harry was thinking more clearly. During the free period that should have been Potions, he sent Hedwig off to Remus and then let Draco distract him with tutoring in the Cypher charm. At lunch, Professor McGonagall and Flitwick had returned, but Snape was still absent, and during Charms, Draco passed on a message to Harry from the Slytherin hearth box.
The last was the worst one. He started just a little after Nott had, with talking about finding Ginny's body.  He was explaining how Tom Riddle, the student who had created the diary, used it to drain her life for his own use, and also control her actions.
"I have a court summons," Harry said flatly. "I think defying it would cause trouble for all of us."  With satisfaction, he watched Uncle Vernon's face pale. "If the Mag-- the people who enforce these things showed up, and I said you wouldn't permit me to go...." He let the sentence trail off ominously.
"It was fun," Harry answered, ignoring Ron's scowl, Seamus' wince and Hermione's gasp, all in favor of smiling at Parvati. "Well, except for Draco spending the entire ball with potential wives. I'd already been there a full day, though, so we'd had time together, and with his mother."
Rob was already scrambling to his feet. "Could we?" he asked excitedly, apparently unable to believe his good fortune.
"I had Ron to counter her, and he was first. Then there was the team. I wasn't friends with Hermione until after Halloween."
Millicent shrugged. "In case someone doesn't approve of the company Malfoy keeps, of course. Is there some reason we haven't headed back yet?"
Harry wasn't sure which bothered He-Who-Had-Been-Hermione more: that Ron never remembered to call him Eugene, or that Harry did so with unnatural frequency. Harry had the guilty thought that he might be having a little too much fun with this, especially considering the state of the rest of his life, not to mention the rest of Wizarding Britain, but when Eugene lowered his book and said fussily to Ron "is there some
"So, this has more than one curse on it?"  Hermione asked, as she studied the little clay disk in front of her.
"Some games of what?" asked Sammy, arriving with Barnaby, another sixth-year boy, right behind him. He stepped back right after the words came out, as if afraid to have spoken in front of all these older kids.
Snape snorted. "Unlikely, Potter. No, as you said, casting a Credulity curse at the wall doesn't do anything. I doubt you have actually built up sufficient Dark energy."
They were nearly finished with the pile when the musicians -- a full dozen of them -- came in, with various large and small cases, and tromped up the side stairs to a recessed space at the far end of the hall, about even with the tops of the windows. Draco sighed and looked at the grandfather clock at their end.
"Indeed." Dumbledore settled back, but his eyes shone, and his voice slowed with satisfaction. "An excellent choice. If you wish supplemental instruction, please feel free to call on me. I believe my training in the matter is significantly different from Professor Snape's."
Harry shrugged. "Oh, it was an active Portkey, all right. But, really, I'm just protected against them." That little exaggeration, he thought, might give him an edge.
"Because I was sorry! Hermione, I acted like an idiot, and I basically said we weren't friends any more, and she was hurt!"
"You can find one elsewhere," Snape said dryly.  "I have better things to do than support the vanity of a spoiled society heir."
"Please, then, go back to what you were doing."  Draco hesitated. "Will it work with me, er, like this?"
With a decisive nod, he schooled his expression to polite neutrality, set a hand on the knob, and turned it.
"Mr. Potter." Snape pivoted from where he had been sneering at sample vials on his desk.  "Detention."
"Er," Harry stuttered uncertainly. He didn't want to agree with the girl's implication that she was unliked!  On the other hand, hadn't he experienced the same thing himself? During the Triwizard Tournament, people had treated him like dirt, and then praised him. "Yeah," he said, giving her a little smile. "Sometimes."
Linnet patted Gilbert on the arm. "She's got you there," she said. "And I agree. I've never heard her put down anyone, even people she had every right to."
Her eyebrows scrunched down as she edged inside. "Did you do that? Without a wand?" At his nod, her frown turned to a wide smile. "Wonderful! Your lessons are going well, then?"
"Yeah, what I did to Theo seemed to be a lot of it.  I hadn't thought of it as a threat, though -- it was more of an offer of truce, actually."
"Have you ever tried memory enhancing potions?"  Harry asked. "I was reading about gargoyle dust, this summer...."
Harry could feel his mind overloading, thought drowning under sensation. He was only vaguely aware of breaking the kiss, first to breathe, and then to roar with a rising surge of pleasure that blinded him like lightning.
They left their things in the room, and emerged from their new entrance into the storeroom of cursed objects. Rather than head back towards the History of Magic classroom, and from there to the main staircase, they continued on past the side corridor and past empty rooms, to where Harry guessed they would find the spiral staircase at the back corner of the castle. He had never been there on this floor, but had on occasion taken it from the fifth floor to the third. He paused at the first of the narrow, deep windows, and looked out at a long, narrow finger of the lake. It seemed much larger and darker seen from here, only one floor up and in the shadow of the castle, than when he looked down on the glittering sunlit surface of it from the fifth floor. Behind the dark water, hills rose in muted purple and gold.
Harry had just got the shirt buttoned, and was making a token attempt to smooth down his hair, when he heard the buzz of the Floo. He hurried out and found a chipper, first-year version of Miranda grinning out from his grate.
Harry stayed for what he thought was another hour, although he didn't dare have a second drink. Still, he worked at trying to look relaxed while others talked. A few people made disparaging remarks about mixed-bloods or Muggleborns; he took his cue from Draco and responded with no more than a contemptuous look. It was almost a relief to have Pansy tell a family story about an abused ancestress, Katherine Parkinson, who killed all the males of her family with a curse that ripped out their genitals at the root. At least then, he was able to wince with the rest of the boys.
"Remember all that," she instructed, and he found himself wondering if she planned to test him later. "Now, I want you to take the potion."
"Hm." Remus looked skeptical. "And at the Malfoy ball, there were people willing to dance with you?"
Not knowing what else to do, Draco nodded. He also raised his head.  Potter was looking at him with a gentle smile.
"Well, it's hardly interesting with you. You'll tell me anything, after all. But at the Manor, the last summer...."
The month passed without either Draco or Harry  mentioning the matter again. It was when Snape appeared in their Floo, two days before the full moon with their flasks of potion in hand, that the thought resurfaced in Harry's awareness.  Suddenly, he wanted to smell Snape's fear.
"Bastard," Harry muttered, but Draco shushed him. Harry would have worried had Draco not also gripped his hand tightly, the contact nearly hidden under the wide sleeve of his robes.
"I couldn't find you." Harry didn't show the map, although Malfoy was not in evidence.  "I thought something might have happened."
Draco actually smirked. "Unclear. She's a Metamorphmagus -- the daughter. Her mother says she's all three girls in one.  Harry thinks the Muggle fields around her may have confused the gift."
," Harry shot back. "Nott holds his capture against Draco, probably even more than against me -- you could tell that he did, at the trial. And you said she loves him."
"You should come," Gilbert urged. "You must realize that your absences are noted. Your own housemates may understand, but the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs fear losing your patronage."
Ron tumbled into the seat next to Harry, his cheeks red from running up the stairs. Looking around, Harry saw Blaise was on the other side of him. Encouragingly, he gave Harry a nod, so he was even interacting a little. That completed the group, Harry realized. Everyone who had attended the week before was there again.
"There are, however, other factors to consider. Yes, hospitality is one of the traditional values that matters to her keenly. You are also correct, I believe, that she loves her only surviving child -- even beyond all causes and potential social and monetary gains. I am quite certain that she has too much discernment to deceive herself that he would forget you if you were murdered in her domain. She is also quite actively repositioning herself politically. You are of more value to her having survived the visit than not."
Draco relaxed more. He opened his eyes and looked up. "How like you," he drawled. "Do trust that I will complain if I am dissatisfied."
"Almost," he answered. "It was a present from Hermione. Draco's learned to like it, though." Ignoring Severus's horrified look, he accepted the flogger from Draco and turned it in a showy figure eight, enjoying the way the tails whispered wickedly through the air. "Stand up, love. Robes off and hold the bar."
"I had a lovely holiday," Hermione said primly. "I enjoy spending time with my parents. They both took the entire week off from work so we could do things together, and we spent two full days in museums in London, and another day in Cambridge, ostensibly visiting a friend of Dad's." She laughed. "It was Oxford in the summer. I think they're hoping to tempt me back to the Muggle world with University libraries."
Neville yelped and jumped forward to avoid the swing of the door opening again. On the other side of the glass, Ginny froze, staying still and tense until Seamus gave her a shove through. Harry stepped back.
, darting to the side so that Draco would not be in the line of fire. As he did so, he realized that he had miscalculated. The disarmed man was lunging for Draco, hands outstretched. Inches away from his goal, he was suddenly knocked backwards in a flash of light.
." Exhaling, he tried to lower his shoulders and speak more lightly. "Still, it wasn't all bad, was it? Who knows how long we would have had a Death Eater teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts if I hadn't smelled the real Moody in his trunk."
"There is something happening, then?" Harry said eagerly. "Something organized? Snape has hinted, and both of you will tell me particular people can be trusted...." Vague images of heroic missions swirled through his head. He could slip into the house with his invisibility cloak on, and repel the Death Eaters at the kitchen door....
Justin looked thoughtful. “Mine is, largely. Magic is terribly exciting, but Hogwarts would be horrible if I wasn’t in Hufflepuff.” He reached out to Susan, and she held his hand.
"Not like this. She found a quirk in how beryl interacts with animal and mineral potions components, and rather than being excited, she was in tears about everything she might not know yet. There's no way she can keep this up until N.E.W.T.s."
"Ugh!" Draco exclaimed. "I kissed a Gryffindor!" and that was so unexpected that Harry burst out laughing. He looked at Draco, who was smiling smugly at him.
"Fine," Draco snapped. "You're disgustingly honorable and all of that. I believe you. Since that was the
A normal Bludger would have continued on. The Contrivance, however, turned to pursue him, ignoring the red-clad Harry, and struck the arm guard Draco had raised in protection. It was a glancing blow, and would have had little effect but for the explosive properties of dragon's blood. To a loud bang, the Bludger shot backward, singing the twigs of Malfoy's broom in passing. It then twisted round to come at him again. "
"But why would--" Her breath came out in a harsh puff. "And you won't stay through that, of course," she surmised.
"I think that's an excellent idea," Draco said smoothly, with a quick, quelling look at Harry. "If he acts,
Esmée took two rapid steps back, Draco's glare following before he pivoted back to Harry. He drew himself up haughtily, orange twigs still hanging off his collar and sleeve.
"Not exactly." Harry took a quick breath. "Dinner with Narcissa -- and Draco and Snape -- was fine. Rather fun, actually. The next day was okay too. Then the ball started.  Draco was busy, but he'd invited Gilbert and Linnet, so they were there -- Gloria as well, though I didn't actually talk to her."
, and he threatened me and then backed down. Look, let's put back his stuff and let him go. That way, they don't know we know, and I'll tell everyone to listen for the word. The Contrivance can be put into non-red mode, if needed, and we'll just watch for referees."
"It will make me more masculine. I'll get facial hair --" she rolled her eyes -- "well, more of it -- and my breasts will shrink, and my, um, one of my female parts will become more like a penis.  The final formulation will add blood and semen from a man, and that will complete that change."
Before Harry had worked that out, he was on his back with Draco straddling one of his calves while he attended to Harry's cock.  He didn't, Harry discovered, have quite the technique of either Draco One or Draco Two. That made him reassuringly his own person. Remembering his lessons under Draco One, Harry thought he could enjoy directing Draco as he evolved a style, but for today, it was far too late for that. Already aching with sustained arousal, he went from pleasure to peak in minutes, release crackling through his body like lightning and leaving him limp under the smug smile of his new lover.
Draco tilted his head, making his hair catch the afternoon sunlight that streamed in the back window. "I think he's deeply submissive, really. The problem is, he doesn't understand that, so he goes about satisfying it in all the wrong ways, so it's never actually pleasant, and he doesn't learn what he wants."
For a moment, all of them froze. Then, with a sighing moan, Draco began to rock in Harry's loosened hold. His breath resuming, Harry rubbed his face against Draco's soft shirt.
"Now, Harry!" Lupin reproved, removing one hand from the lead to wag a finger playfully at Harry. "I haven't been a professor in years. You know --"
"Very nice." Harry strolled around the edge of the table until he was at Draco's head. Leaning forward, he grasped the hem of Draco's shirt and pulled it up, baring his back. Carefully, he smoothed Draco's fair hair down under the rumpled fabric. "You look so lovely there," he said softly.  "Do you want to know what I'll do to you?"
"Understood, Mr. Potter! My pleasure!" Tom looked uncertainly at Harry's head, which Harry belatedly realized must appear to be floating in mid air. Harry set a hand to his hip, parting the cloak a bit, so he would have at least a column of his body showing. Tom seemed set at ease by this. "I should show you the Floo for private arrivals, sir."
For a moment, her eyes closed. Then she straightened. Her wand dropped out faster than Harry would have believed her capable of, but as Horsyr darted forward, it pointed up. Pansy swirled her casting in a spiral above them. A privacy charm.
"Hello, Sir," Draco said brightly. "Please come in. Severus," he added, with a polite nod of greeting.
Auror Mason rolled his eyes. "We'll take over from here, sir," he said, and Dumbledore, with a nod to him and a deeper one to Tonks, departed. The headmaster's office felt plainer and quieter without him there, although nothing else had changed.
"Fred...." Harry said warningly, but both twins were ignoring him. They parted to walk past Harry on both sides, which disconcerted him enough that it was a moment before he realized where they were going.
"Harry!" Jeremy exclaimed, seeing him approach. Rob waved a hello, and Sammy looked nervously at the Firebolt resting against Harry's shoulder.
Professor Dumbledore shook his head slightly, but did nothing to intervene. Harry got the impression that he would gladly have used another ten minutes of Professor Snape's time to get to the point gently.
Harry briefly pictured an animate kitchen, with an oven door popping open, and a flying fork arranging parsley around the emerging roast, but he suspected it just wasn't polite to mention servants, or House Elves, or whoever it was who was cooking.
"Eventually, I did some strange enough accidental magic that they had to tell me," the Hufflepuff explained. "It was rather awful." To the side, Harry saw Gloria flinch. The boy held out his hand to Sammy. "I'm Eric, by the way. In third year."
Hecksban looked unusually grave. “It was unambiguously physical, as we saw. What does that suggest?”
affect where you go from there. If I'd accepted Slytherin, for example, I probably would have been a better student, but I would have stayed far more secretive, and become sneakier."
"Ron," Draco said patiently. "You are obviously either Confounded or high. I - and I expect you -- would rather have people believe the former."
"Before we begin the marvelous feast that awaits us, I have a few announcements. First, I would like all of you to still be here at the end of the term.
"McGonagall. When she was handing back my essay, she told me to come to her office directly after lessons."
"NOBODY MOVE!" roared a deep voice. The clatter of footsteps stuttered to silence. Harry stared down at Draco and found him drawing in deep, desperate breaths, as if he had just outrun a manticore. "TONKS," the voice added in a more even tone, only the enhancement of the Sonorus charm keeping it loud. "REPORT."
Draco shrugged. "Understanding is not articulation, and articulation for one audience is not always the same as articulation for another. You
That got a smile from Draco at last. "I'm sure." He sighed. "I don't mean-- Training makes some sense, logically. I realize that your success, in this case, is of critical importance to far more people than us, but still--"
"Is there any beer?" Seamus asked, with a hint of challenge. Draco couldn't entirely repress a smirk.
. I made Hermione carry a silver dagger. Then a year later, I totally mucked things up with Cho by buying her one as a present, and not being able to tell her
"Considering the Notts," Severus said, "indubitably." He regarded them speculatively. "Speaking of which, no one has come tattling to me about the two of you, recently. Have you done anything of interest?"
Harry only just bit back a "he never told me."  Horrified at nearly having revealed his contact with his godfather, he sat silent for a moment, and in that moment, Minister Ramsley rose to his feet. He gestured to a clerk, who pointed his wand at his throat and bounced quickly to his feet.
"Yeah, but what if I cast the wrong thing?"  Millicent sat down and untied one shoe, which she pulled off and set in front of her.
Harry tensed. "A potential customer," he huffed. For a moment, the man looked him up and down, and then he gestured at the shop, which ran in one narrow room, bisected by waist-height bins and barrels, from front to back. Harry glanced at the bins and the dimly lit shelves, but had no desire to look more closely at them. Instead, he stepped up to the counter.
The next day was Friday, and while things were more comfortable between Harry and Hermione -- enough so that he caught Ron frowning while he watched them playing with their Animation spells in Charms -- he worried about disappearing for the evening. Neville, Luna, and Susan would be joining the Uncommon Room group, and he didn't want to leave early. After lessons, he found himself sitting with Hermione in a window alcove, letting her vent about Ron.
"I'm counting on that to make it look natural," Harry said. "I'll even help. Just make sure the loo works, as soon as possible. Draco, draw up the contract, and we'll all sign it."
"It's occurred to me," he admitted, mostly to her hair. "And I miss telling you everything, really I do."
"Is it urgent?" Malfoy called back. "I'm having a pleasant conversation."  Harry could just see the smirk he sent at Eugene. "With one of my own kind."
"Many noble individuals are involved in different ways," Dumbledore said cryptically. "For example, Hagrid often accepts specific tasks for me, but often without sensitive information about the larger plan. I consider him one of our number, but he is not a strategist."
have been that easy, if I'd still approved of your murderous pursuits." Decisively, he returned his attention to McGonagall. "Should I tell you about the list of curses?  It might be better if Aurors asked us individually for specifics. Harry and Hermione won't remember all of them, but I showed the list to both of them, and Professor Snape received another copy from my father."
He looked terribly proud of himself, and Harry had to grin back at him. "Yeah -- I heard on the train. Congratulations."
His jaw dropped. For a moment he just blinked at her.  "Are you insane?" he said finally. "What's the point of even
"Here already?" Draco commented, as he sat down at Harry's table in the mixed house space. Harry stopped smoothing the feathering of his quill and set it aside.
"Is it not?" Snape was still angry. "Potter sweeps in and commands things -- sending the Wizengamot to change centuries-old edicts, and you to pour the tea."
"So I'll have to play some tricks on someone, whether it's Ravenclaws, or Hufflepuffs, or Slytherins that Draco doesn't like."
"But in Dark Arts itself -- well, the few spells I've done -- everything just bursts out. Draco thought I might be drawing power from..." Harry hesitated, gesturing at his scar. Snape hated him saying Voldemort's name. He remembered how he had felt looking at the name he had drawn in the Slytherin Common Room, and wondered if
"What?" Finding Draco still steadfastly looking away, Harry bumped against him. "Yeah, I told you what you had wrong. And from a few words of information, you
Harry pushed his plate away. There was no way he could manage to choke anything down through the tightness in his throat, and if he did, it certainly wouldn't stay.
"Bases for the party favors," Draco said.  "Put that down, and I'll show you an easier one." Reaching into the heap he had just exposed, he pulled out a tiny tin tiger and then placed it on the dark wood. Harry's ring warmed as Draco drew his wand. His brow was furrowed with concentration as he focused on the tiger, and he steadied the little thing from the sides as he ran his wand tip from head to tail, whispering a charm.
Harry felt a stirring of fear. On Sunday, he had to meet Millicent every other week. He had promised her he wouldn't tell, though.
"Yours now," Draco insisted, reaching ineffectively. He pouted. "It isn't fair if I'm the only one undressed. I can't even reach your trousers."
"Um...." Harry was unconvinced, but Draco had apparently expected this. He smirked. "Actually, it was after a game at the end of sixth year -- when it changed, I mean. We lingered in the showers, and ended up pulling each other off -- very juvenile and clumsy and quick...." The smirk shifted briefly to something softer. "But for all that,
He considered it. The initial sparks hadn’t returned, but he could almost feel the pain lying in wait below a thick layer of magic dulling it.
Harry stilled his motion, only then realizing that he had been rutting against the mattress as he worked. He moved his mouth off Draco's cock slowly, trailing his tongue up it as he withdrew. Shakily, Draco tugged at his arms, urging him up.
"Oh, is that what you want, Potter?" Malfoy's voice was sticky sweet over the click of the door closing. "Grace? Or just flexibility?"
"Yeah." The room had a sofa as well as the one chair. Harry sat on the end nearest Remus. "I have a new appreciation of what it must be like for him. And I've been doing this for less than three weeks." Speculatively, he looked at the door. "I wish I could turn into a dog."
She nodded serenely. "I understand why you protect him. It is not needed, but I do not take offense. Your arm, Mr. Potter?"
when you're lost!" Draco caught himself. "I do mean it, Harry. You shouldn't take offense. And it's not entirely a bad analogy. For his family to get home without him might have been inconvenient if there were several underage children. However, Pansy is old enough to Apparate, and Garrett too young to attend, so Mother did not feel she was inconveniencing anyone. She went to Mrs.  Parkinson afterwards, and told her what her husband had done, and that he was not welcome back at the manor, but that she might reconsider if he acknowledged that he was at fault and pledged better behavior. Mrs. Parkinson was visibly embarrassed, but said she had better return home before he did something foolish. She collected Pansy -- before I could speak to her, unfortunately -- and left."
Hermione's statement wasn't critical. Harry nodded. "Yeah.  I know that last spring upset people, and the trial probably made it worse, and seeing me with Slytherins isn't going to help, but I'm not willing to dump them. So I thought I should take opportunities to talk to people who don't know me well, so they know I'm not mad, or a drunk, or betraying my house in vengeance, or whatever."
"As I understand it, starting with a subtle element makes the glamour more stable," Draco said. "It's a technique primarily used in decorating. Starting with basic changes is easier, though, so more people can do it reliably."
She swallowed, apparently missing his humor completely. "Um, I'm Katherine, Katherine McDuffie, third year. M'brother Robbie was talking to a Slytherin yesterday, and he said that you said that was okay."
Harry stepped close behind Snape, so that they almost touched. "Hold the bar," he whispered. "Do you wish to be bound?"
"Right." Ron closed his book with a snap, tossing it to the table as he surged to his feet. Harry saw Hermione wince and hold her mouth shut tight. Ron didn't notice; he was calling for Ginny as he crossed the room. With a grin, Harry patted the cushion beside him, and Hermione scooped up her schoolbag and came over to join him on the sofa.
Harry twisted. Draco was holding an empty wine bottle in one hand. He flipped it end over end, catching it by the neck. Snape sniffed.
Ron's brow furrowed as if something in the swirls didn't make sense. "You're confused about boys and girls?"
Harry felt his cheeks stretch in a grin. It was completely harmless. "It's never occurred to me," he said, with the spontaneity of joy. "Maybe when I'm done traveling."
The Slytherin Common Room was surprisingly sedate. Most of the younger kids were near the middle of the room, working at the tables there in groups sorted by year. Fourth years and up were scattered throughout the room. By the fire, Pansy was chatting with the Greengrass girls at one side of the horseshoe arrangement of sofas. On the other side, one sofa in, Gilbert and Linnet were discussing something intently, with the hapless victim of Pansy's Babbling Draught looking on. Nott, to Harry's relief, was nowhere in sight.
"You'll be fine," Harry soothed. "I'll bite you right before moonset, in case something goes wrong, but nothing will. You brewed the Wolfsbane potion; it will work. You stayed with us last moon, remember?"
"Oh, dear!" Hermione wondered if he had been possessed. By Voldemort? But he had done the right thing, she thought. By Godric, perhaps? That was still disturbing. "Come into the tent," she said. "You need to warm up, at least."
"I can't say anything about a color. Not because of the charm, but because..." He shrugged. "There isn't a real answer."
Harry handed control of his Abraxan over to Susan Bones and plopped down next to Mill to check out the card game she was playing with Blaise, Ginny, and Caradog.
That done, Harry made himself look heavier, especially in the face. When he was satisfied with his appearance, he extended his hand to Susara.
"I know it's a shock," Tonks said cheerily, stepping forward to take his arm. "But as I told you before, it's rather designed to be. You'll be in a cell tonight, but a decent one, and we should have you back in time for lunch tomorrow. Come on, now. Professor Dumbledore said we could use his Floo."
Sighing, Harry handed Draco his glass. "Then we definitely need to say a few things to each other in private. Here, hold my drink, in case Snape's outside. We're just going to pop out to the corridor for a mo."
Harry pushed a little more, getting the head in just a little. He wanted to tell Draco to relax, but he knew that wouldn't help. Given a goal, Draco would try intensely. "Love you," he said instead, and that won him a crucial moment of softening. He pressed in enough to count, although still not past the head. Another pause, and he pressed again.  "Good?"
"Umbridge?" Snape asked in surprise. "Deputy Minister of the Office of Bureaucratic Oversight? She generally levies fees, in this world."
Harry stretched over to give him a brief kiss. It might be worth mentioning his Sorting, if he really wanted these people to look at him differently. "If you'd been nicer," he teased, " you might have had the chance."
Harry thought he would have done it the other way -- there was no color that all four of them had, but he, Draco, and Linnet all had Ravenclaw blue for having fallen asleep in the library, and he, Draco, and Gilbert all had bright pink for having kissed a girl and grey-flecked black for having used Dark Arts, a challenge Blaise had called in the second round of play. Still, he nodded. "Right. No one else has one, because I'm the only Parselmouth."
For a Slytherin child, she was brave. He had liked that about her from the start. "You know," he said, "I can't teach you the Privacy charm, but I do owe you tutoring on something. You never collected."
“No, Hannah is bringing her. We thought it best that she arrive late, so it would more awkward for her to leave than to stay.”
Draco shrugged. "I don't care," he said obstinately.  "I've spent three years pretending not to care; no one should be shocked that it has become real."
Harry was not sure which was stronger – the leaden weight of dread in his stomach or the quickening flares of pain in his legs. He made a choked sound of protest, but no words would form. He couldn’t say his aunt’s life was worth less than that of a mouse – she was a
"The knickers? Now?" At any other time, Harry might have been embarrassed by the high tension in his voice, but he could see, now, how it was making Malfoy pant with lust.
"And everything. Yes. And there were people who laughed, but I didn't mind. But now they're horrified and trying to show me how
"Really!" huffed Parvati, beside her. "I know you don't admire me, but you must know enough of my housemates to pick one."
Draco nodded and stepped forward. Harry thought he had been looking anxious, but as he set his shoulders back and raised his head, all traces of that fell away.
"Mm." Draco stretched back, the twist of his arm and the grace of his final pose demonstrating 'artful'. "
Snape shoved his plate away. "Why am I here? If you are planning to punish me, then DO it. I do not need to sit here and listen to your hunting preferences."
"I think the headmaster may be under the misimpression that you are still overindulging in alcohol," Draco said dryly. "He should realize that now you are of age, it would scarcely interest you any further."
"True, Mr. Potter, but that was not my primary concern."  Dumbledore straightened, looking at him over steepled hands. "Your safety is of the utmost importance--"
The brewing had taken almost two hours, and Harry, who had forgotten his Charms texts, had to spend the rest of Sunday finishing an essay. Hermione ignored him -- he suspected that she was annoyed that he had been away so long for two days in a row. He came back from meeting Draco on Tuesday in plenty of time to satisfy rules, but got the cold shoulder again.  Afterwards, he lay awake wondering if it would be better if there was an Uncommon Room, and he spent some of his time with Draco where she could be with them.
"Only some of them," she said. "I'm horrible at transfiguration, but I'm fine with some charms -- except all the appearance ones, unfortunately. I know they're not transfiguration, but they
Once Draco had put it like that, Harry had no choice but to cooperate. To his surprise, he did feel marginally better once he was in fresh clothes. He thought he might even understand what Draco had meant. The change placed his day more firmly in the past. With more cheer than he would have expected, he stepped out into Diagon Alley, Draco at his side. Draco did not take his hand -- or his arm, as Harry could suddenly imagine him doing -- but he walked intimately close. Even dinner with Parkinson and Bulstrode --
"The house colors -- both, as exactly as you can manage -- of whichever house you have most often disparaged in that manner."
"She was all set to mount a hunt," Ron said cheerfully, taking an egg mayonnaise sandwich from a platter. "But I said this was the most likely place to find you."
Since this story has all been pureblood (though lower-class) Snape, I decided to change his Patronus to what I probably would have chosen for him when
"I'm looking for--" Something from a Red Cap, he meant to say, but the words wouldn't come out. "-- Sphinx feathers."
Harry sat. The arrangement was oddly social. It made him think of the first stiff interactions with Narcissa. The headmaster, however, had not distracted him with a cursed chair. Dumbledore seemed equally at a loss.
sort,” Draco countered. “They were too distracted to think of the consequences of the potion, I expect. Severus, at least, would have realized the danger, and that it would not take malice to cause damage.”
"Perfect," Malfoy said, sliding his hands up and under Harry's shirt to push it back and off his shoulders. "I've been wondering what you would look like."
"So," Gilbert said, doodling what looked like a crest with his wand, "do we have to worry about you?"
Stepping out of Madame Pomfrey's domain into the dim-lit corridor was his real return to Hogwarts. Harry wondered what had happened while he was gone. Had Draco stood by his lie or confessed to someone? Perhaps Blaise? Harry shuddered as he remembered the trouble Parvati's question had caused between Draco and Blaise. They wouldn't be telling each other anything now, and conversation about him would likely be avoided for quite some time.
"I'm not sure it does, really," Hermione objected. "They assured us that those taken had not been in genuine peril--"
"We do not believe she was abducted, so this is not yet a crisis. She went to her husband's office yesterday, and while her guard watched her parked automobile, they left by other means. This was not noticed until the offices closed and they did not emerge. A large number of people searched for them throughout the night."
Harry tried to glare, but he couldn't not smile. "You seem to think I'm confusing things," he said, as loftily as he could manage. "I'm not. And I didn't need excuses, as he was delighted to be the experienced one, and always ready to show me something new." He swallowed, remembering that brilliant week of discoveries. "But the spell was excellent, intense sex. The magic has this effect...." He stopped and wet his lips. Draco shivered.
“Sit,” Madame Pomfrey said, nudging a chair in behind him. He tried to lower himself, and ended up collapsing into it ungracefully.  “I haven’t released you yet.”
"Yes. I wouldn't risk a friend of Harry's. He's on the bad end of responses, but it won't get worse this long after taking it."
"Right."  "Eugene" was a problem, but "Master" wasn't. Harry didn't think he'd ever understand house elves. "Well, do you know if Malfoy is treating her -- him -- decently?"
"Yes, for it to affect me." Harry slid Snape's book out of his school bag. "They'd need time for any of the methods here.  The strongest way is to cut off flesh from her, directly into a rather nasty potion, and once it dissolves in that, to attack me with that potion. A simpler one is to cut deep into part of her body -- say, her right hand, if they wanted to damage my wand hand -- with a particular curse, and then pour a similar potion into it. But it's not that much simpler. They wouldn't need direct access to me, but for that, she needs to stay alive while the potion eats through her. At our degree of kinship, she'd need to be restrained for almost half an hour, and even then, we might not have enough of a family bond for it to work."
Draco sighed.  "First," he said, "don't believe everything my spellfather says.  Second--" he looked at Harry, for a moment, as if he wanted to be held, but then, almost scornfully, faced forward again. "Severus and I both have the same destructive response to fear. Neither of us can tolerate even a wisp of it, and I
Harry grimaced, but he could not help but remember Snape's warning when he suggested cursing Nott's bloodline to get at his uncle.
"Maybe." Harry laughed at his own doubt. "I suppose you'd know better than I would. We shouldn't meet more than once a week, I think."
When it was late enough, he ordered take-away from his favorite curry place, and put it under stasis charms. When Draco woke, he had warm food and a chilled white Bordeaux wine waiting.
"Okay." Harry yawned.  Hermione would bring him assignments and notes, probably, so-- "Mill!" he exclaimed.
They needed to Floo, of course, and Harry ended up on the floor covered with ash, but when they had him in a bed, Tonks cast a Sound-Block around it and sat outside it to keep an eye on him. Shacklebolt was talking to Madame Pomfrey, but the spell worked both ways, so Harry could not hear them.
"Sure," he answered, and pinched the cord, lengthening it until the loop slipped over his hand. He followed that with the second. "Beads on a string."
"Hi, Harry," Millicent said, as he dropped down into the tunnel. Harry thought she must have heard his approach, because she turned back to the open area right away.
Snape nodded. "When you put it that way." He relaxed enough to lean back against the wardrobe. "But what do you want in return for this
," he answered. "Are you likely to pursue a career?" Not waiting for an answer, he extracted another packet and gave it to Draco. "I meant it sincerely. I liked you from that first day, you know, much to my surprise."
"I..." Ron had actually gone pale, his freckles standing out on his cheeks, as they had when news of Mr. Weasley's death had reached them two years before. "But he's a rich pureblood who was trying-- trying to--"
Draco leaned against a nearby work slab and pulled Harry to him. They watched in silence as the silver mist dimmed and sank back into the cauldron. With that gone, Snape's scarf turned out to be much darker than Harry had thought. With a satisfied nod, Snape set a timer charm in the air beside the cauldron, and pulled off his dragon-hide gauntlets, and then both scarf and goggles. When he turned towards them, he had indentations on his face where the leather had pressed in.
Harry's jaw tightened. "My business can be shared with a lot of strangers, but I can't know about them?"
They sat quietly for a few minutes. Tuktuk had managed to stretch from Harry's lap to Hermione's. Harry thought it ought to be uncomfortable, but the Quiri looked content as it twisted half onto its back.
"I'm not sure." Harry looked away. "I feel like I ought to be able to manage without it. And then, of course, there are the Quiris...."
Frowning, Harry looked over at Snape, who was sitting stiffly in the other window-side chair. The man rolled his eyes, and then shrugged slightly, so this probably wasn't some sort of trap. He still seemed to disapprove, perhaps of Harry giving away his aptitude for wandless magic.
"Make you more domestic, that is," Harry explained quickly. "I told him I thought you'd always be interested in research and social issues, no matter how many kids you had."
"Oh, yeah -- Ron said Crabbe had threatened to tell about something -- breaking form, or leaving his post; I wasn't sure."
"Because when she slapped him, he crushed the chocolate in his fist, and they both got spattered." She rolled her eyes. "
Draco's laugh was so tight with nerves as to be almost a giggle, but he let go and pushed where he had previously been holding, and Harry rolled over, wriggling back until he had Draco's cock between the cheeks of his arse. To his satisfaction, it firmed up some in the process.
"Not-- Just-- Look, some is for us, and some is for gifts, okay? I was out in Muggle London under Polyjuice, and I went shopping."
Harry stared at him incredulously, and Draco's sneer dissolved into a sigh. They were a good distance from the castle, now. "When Professor Snape talked to the house last night, he said that you should be regarded as a potentially valuable resource, and as such, were to be considered as under his personal protection."
Harry cocked his head to the side, trying to recall anything he had heard about gargoyle dust, but nothing came to mind. "What's it for?"
Sirius frowned, his brow creasing with thought. "And who died?" he asked wryly. Harry watched each shift in his expression raptly, drinking him in. This, he thought, was Sirius as he might have been -- as dependable as he was loyal.
Harry blinked. Draco, in front of him, was not his father, but he looked like he'd raided his father's wardrobe from fifteen years ago. He was wearing long, formal blue robes over a lace-fronted shirt, and his hair was pulled back in a blue lace tie. A signet ring glittered on his thumb.
When Harry returned to the shop, the twins had left, but on the crate by his bed were two doses of Polyjuice, a few ginger hairs caught in folded parchment, and a note:
to? No, indeed not. And lest you think that I have misunderstood, Bill was born in November of the year following, with no indication he had been delayed. I believe one of her school friends, however, had had a period of considering an array of bad options."
"Oh!" Padma said quietly. "Well, all right, then." She cleared her throat. "For his notable achievement in Charms theory, including the idea that led us to mending the second glow-line, I admire Blaise Zabini." She took one of the cylindrical beads and turned it dark green, then wrapped it with a double spiral of bright metallics -- silver for one strand and bronze for the other.
, and those of you with parents parroted them about a lot of things. You have to count more what people say when they start thinking for themselves."
Harry shrugged. "I'm not the only one who knows that connection," he said. "Dumbledore remembers him. He was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor when Riddle was a student."
"Precisely, sir," Draco answered, and Harry took the newspaper from his bag and extended it to the headmaster. Dumbledore accepted it with deep nod. He frowned at the grey newsprint.
Ron sounded casual, but not entirely coherent. Harry went around the table to sit by him, his hand on Ron's shoulder.
"I mean, I can't keep expecting you to be a girl for me, can I? But this isn't really going to work if you aren't. I won't do that again no matter what you'll do in return. Still, I can't imagine going back to just, you know,
"When they have visitors, yes. But they're sad when I leave, and they're always indoors now, because winter in Scotland is too cold for them." He looked back to Remus.  "Frieda had been going to take them south in November, at the latest. But they will be glad to see someone new."
Hermione wiped away the tears that hadn't yet soaked into Harry's robe, and blew her nose. "Sorry," she said, shoving the handkerchief back into her pocket. She would have pulled free, but now he didn't want to let her go.
"Oh, seven about the ball itself, and who danced with whom, with special note of Harry's partners, and of yours." She bit her lip. "And some less amusing ones after the head was found, of course."
to have the day after the ball to work on it uninterrupted. Unfortunately, Mr. Parkinson was inconveniently murdered after Mother evicted him, so that day was taken up with Auror interviews, writing letters to Pansy and tearing them up, and far too much time sitting in my room, reminding myself to breathe."
"Listen. You created a space that a mixed group of Slytherin and Gryffindors of different classes and backgrounds found comfortable, and you kept them happy, friendly, and
Hermione froze. Could this be her Harry, back again? Maybe the body stayed put? She was sure smoking must leave a taste.  "Harry?" she asked tentatively.
"Harry!" Draco exclaimed in mock horror. "How dishonorable of you! Nosing about in someone else's correspondence?"
"Exactly," Snape spat, for the small audience of Neville and Seamus, both frozen near the door.  "Did you think I would not find out? Tomorrow night at seven, and don't think that's the last of it."
"Brilliant. All right, let's go around the room. Tell me your name, whether you have any experience with cursed objects, and how comfortable you are with-- No, on second thought, just name and experience.  Let's start with you."
, Creevy," Potter said, a little of the iron that had Draco expected showing through the gentle plush of his affection. "Drop it."
"Great!" Harry glanced at the paper. He saw "Cursebreaking", but had no time for more. The carriage was rolling to a stop. They exited into a milling crowd of students, and were quickly separated.
Draco's inner room, when he entered it, was not entirely dark. The embers of a fire gave off a faint glow that showed Harry the path past the sideboard and to the bed, where the curtains were drawn -- perhaps against the light of that fire when it had been brighter.
"Hm." Seamus sounded a bit more sympathetic at that. "Might a Slytherin have tampered with it? If you were with them...."
Voldemort wasn't the goal. He probably wouldn't have minded if he had, but there had been enough failed attempts that I think they were pretty sure that stabbing him wouldn't work. The attack was to get enough blood for the spell they created so that I would develop attuned to his power--" Harry's words slowed as he recalled the sensation of pulling power from Snape's casting of the Dark Mark -- "and with five times the chance to destroy him."
Tom waved a hand in dismissal. "I'll have it sent up. Close up that cloak, Mr. Potter, and I'll show you to your room."
His warning was too late.  She'd hurled the rock neatly into the rubble, where it hit with a thunderous crash, knocking loose several other stones which rumbled down to the floor.
"I don't see why everyone is so surprised," Parvati remarked, finally sitting down on an empty settee and crossing her legs neatly at the knee. "He's generally amiable."
After some rather tedious spellcasting, much of it repeated by the professor, Draco had concluded two things: the spell did not have an area effect, so it would land only on him if set off, and that the effect would be emotional or mental, and not too destructive. Concurring, Hecksban instructed everyone to stand ready, and gave Draco approval to add the Pensieve base potion.
"Blood replenisher," Harry replied. That had to have been what he swallowed. Draco shuddered behind him. "Um...."
" He cocked his head and looked at Harry. "We'll have to make sure it doesn't violate the permanent harm rule."
"Let's play," Harry said, and Draco rolled off the bed and onto his knees. Harry couldn't keep from laughing slightly at how artificial it was, but Severus came to his feet at the first burst of motion. After a few quick steps, he seemed to realize that they weren't going anywhere, and backed up towards the wall. Still smiling, Harry Summoned the whip rack and set it down to one side. It was a short stand, basically rectangular, with a line of slots in a board set a few inches above a low platform, and another corresponding set in a board at the top. Only two sets were used as intended, with the handle of a crop resting on the platform, and the shaft laid from one slot to its pair above. A thin switch was stored similarly, but beyond that, he had used the upper slots in pairs, looping thong or cord handles from one to the next. In that way, he had suspended four floggers and a leather paddle. Most were black or brown, with little ornamentation. The Imperial Flogger hung among them like Gilderoy Lockhart in a line of monks. Harry stepped back and motioned Draco forward.
"Wrong?" he questioned, ignoring the kids. "It's just spin, you know. I can say you're a reckless fool as easily as a hero. You can say I'm an unreliable turncoat as easily as I'm adaptable."
"The old sort of fairies. A different race entirely.  They were killed off by water systems and such."
Harry stopped in the doorway of the crowded Slytherin Common Room. A nearby lower-year registered his presence and whipped around. "Potter!"  the boy shouted in warning, and rowdy conversation muted to whispers in outward waves as people turned to look.
"Do you have plans?"  Draco asked, as they left the room after Cursebreaking. Harry looked up the stairs to the bobbing spot of red hair that showed Ron taking the stairs two at a time.
Ron outright laughed at that, the sound familiar, and a few others followed. Hecksban grinned and let the whispers die out before continuing on to a Ravenclaw that Harry didn't know. Beside him was Blaise Zabini, whom he had previously not noticed.
"You truly intend to slay him?" she asked Harry. For the first time since the Seeing, she sounded rational.
They discussed the divination potions until Draco noticed that it was time for lunch, and then raced upstairs, pausing only as needed -- for Harry to seal the chamber behind them, and once for Draco to set a monitoring charm in front of their new entrance to the passage and close it, and for Harry to blow the dust around to hide their tracks. They walked into the Great Hall late and together.
To his relief, Malfoy did not seem bent on using his position as a prefect to seek out couples in the bushes. He continued along the edge of the garden, ignoring rustles and giggles that he had to have heard, and off into the unkempt lands near the Forbidden Forest. After a few minutes of walking, Harry realized they were headed towards where Hagrid had pulled up the Devil's Snare last year. Was Malfoy planting more? That must be it, Harry decided. It would be just like him to have a hobby of strangling bunnies -- indirectly, of course, to avoid any mess.
"Hi," Gloria said, holding out her hand. "Pleased to meet you," she said, as she shook Robbie's hand, and then Sammy's. "What lovely hair you have!" she said to Yolanda. Harry couldn't help thinking that she was as socially trained as Draco. Gilbert leaned his chin on a fist.
Harry eyed the girl for a moment, trying to push down his resentment. "Of course," he said, managing a smile. "Hello, Linnet."
"More likely, he'll talk to her, she'll hug him and cry in relief, and then ten minutes later, after he pretends nothing happened,
"Excuse me," Draco said. "We agreed that you could be here, which is itself a hindrance, as your brother pointed out. Do not make it an active one."
"If you're a man, though, you'll still...." He trailed off, realizing that he had left no tactful way to continue.
"Some other time," Harry muttered, taking a swallow of the cognac. It had layers of flavor below the heat of the alcohol, but he didn't have the concentration to appreciate them. Draco was laughing as brightly as his mother, the sound as brittle as glass.
"Fawkes -- Dumbledore's phoenix, if you've ever seen him -- blinded it, and brought me the Sorting Hat, which brought me the sword of Gryffindor. I could barely lift the thing, and had no idea how to use it, but the basilisk was wild -- not surprising, really, considering how long it had been down there -- and blind, and all I had to do was hold the blade out while it tried to bite me, and it impaled itself.
Harry flushed. He hadn't thought of it that way, but he probably did look snooty to them, walking off with Draco Malfoy, and in his new formal robes, as well.
of you Calming Potion." He started with Justin, who took it gratefully, then moved on to Draco and Blaise.
"Just a moment!" Ron called, from out of sight of the grate in the parlor. Under normal circumstances, Harry would have stepped through, but he didn't want to appear threatening. "Who's--" He stopped in the doorway, little Amanda held upright against his chest. "Harry?"
was normal. Still, after each put away the things they had carried, they both walked down to dinner with him -- on opposite sides of him all the way to the Great Hall and down the long Gryffindor table.
At dinner, a message arrived from Draco's mother. Harry watched his face intently while he read it, and determined the news could not be terrible.
There were chains on the three remaining chairs -- Nott was no longer present -- but none of the defendants were restrained with them.  When his name was called, Lucius stood with quiet dignity. He was impeccably, but sedately, dressed in robes of soft grey, and he held his head high.
There was no point in advancing the issue to Snape until the other students returned -- Draco could hardly claim that Harry was under pressure from his housemates now. They spent a leisurely -- although not exactly lazy -- afternoon together, and wandered into dinner hand-in-hand.
"Me too." Harry squeezed him briefly. "If anyone had told me, last September, that the place I would feel safest was in this room, I would have thought they were raving." He kissed the most accessible part of Draco, which was somewhere near his shoulder. "And if they'd said in Draco Malfoy's arms...."
didn't know it wasn't a switch, when I found myself in front of a Professor Snape, next to a Draco Malfoy, I assumed Harry One had been an idiot and gone to
"Perhaps," Draco allowed. "But any debt to you undercuts her legitimacy in the house, regardless. So. You told Hermione this?"
"Your friend is better company than I expected," he said. Harry had no idea how someone who was still glowing from orgasm could manage that breezy tone. "We should have him over more often."
Blaise nodded. "Good, because that's the only way you're not getting 'Dwight's White', or whatever's cheapest."
But it worked for you. That's something that indicates a wizard's or witch's affinity for the casting. Then you talked about Rodolphus Lestrange killing your dad, and said Nott would kill someone that night."  Harry turned to Hermione. "And when we asked him, he came out of it and shrugged it off, and said it was just 'blood in the water.' But the next morning, we read about the victim, and that woman who found the body, and the first thing she saw was blood in the water."
Draco didn't pull or try to keep him in place, just held on, and touched, and occasionally moved his fingers in little circles over Harry's scalp, teasing at the locks as if he'd leave him looking like a hedgehog. He also made high, desperate sounds and low, lustful sounds and everything in between. As Harry discovered he could move lower, taking more of the shaft into his mouth, Draco began to rock just a little, not thrusting, but suggesting a rhythm, which Harry picked up gladly. He settled down against the mattress, pushing into it every time his lips moved down, and one of Draco's legs curled behind his shoulder, encouraging more movement.
Harry did, and they tilted to the side so he could wrap a hand around Malfoy's cock -- and god, but even that felt good -- and he rubbed up against him and pulled him off until they both came -- not together, but not awkwardly far apart.
Draco opened his mouth, and then closed it again. Slowly, he nodded. "I understand what you mean, but-- This is more than a little overwhelming. I've learned more about you this evening than I ever knew, I think. It's easier to think about sex."
"Yeah." He sucked at the edge of Draco's ear, and then at his neck. It took the edge off the need to have something else. Draco's cock in his mouth, he remembered. That, maybe. He tightened his grip around that hard shaft. How could that feel so good, just in his hand? "Fuck.  Want you."
Harry didn't point out that he had; his studies with Snape were the last thing he wanted to remind Ron of.
"Right." Harry grinned.  "The one with trousers on. I want you pushing up against her -- um, him. Sorry, Malfoy."
"You knew you were gay then?" Dean blurted out.  He cringed. Harry blinked. It took him a moment to tie that back to what he had been saying.
"You didn't see the head," Harry managed. He thought he had put the feeling behind him, but it came back as strong as the first moment of recognition.
Harry nodded. "And looking for Horcruxes. That's the same as the last place. And Ron Weasley -- there's a strange thought! -- had been with you, but he left and was killed."
intervene when people try to take advantage of him." Scorn twisted his features again. "Did you think to gain his favor for so little, Severus? A few minutes' submission that you enjoyed as much as he did?"
"Being silenced while under Veritaserum is dangerous," Kingsley explained. "Your mind is at war with your body."
our supplies after Hermione left last night, to see if anything was contaminated, and in examining the feathers, noticed a difference in heft. One was genuine; the other was spurious -- a Great Eagle feather, possibly dyed.
In the end, they decided to try the Seer's divination in two weeks, at the beginning of November. Draco noted that he might need Harry to brew, leaving the reason unstated -- that making the potion himself would leave him unable to approach the Quiris. When Harry and Ron got back to Gryffindor -- long past curfew -- Hermione left for her room without a word.
Harry felt a wash of disorientation, but it was nothing like the discomfort of a portkey. "Um ... okay?" he tried, as the world steadied.
Harry laughed. "Look at it this way," he said. "All my ability to play unfair, I'm saving for the war, okay? I'll cheat to put one over on Voldemort -- not on a bunch of kids who are mostly younger than me."
"Your love can do the same," Ron said conversationally. "But it's also a strength. It's a tree, here. It grows out from you, and people gather around it. You're going to have a rough winter, though -- harsh and mild by turns. Mum always said that brought on colds."
From the interested flicker of Zabini's eyes, he hadn't known, which to Harry meant he was allied with neither the Order nor Voldemort -- at least not actively.
Millicent snorted. "And what would you know about fathers? Sorry," she added hastily, "but it's true. It's easy for you to look at families and think it's all love and understanding. When you have one, it's more complicated."
," Harry said. After reaching the end of the cylinder -- without flaws this time -- he rolled his shoulders and sat back. "It's all right, Ron."
Severus hissed and settled, and Harry stroked the back of his neck. "There.  Move lower; you can lean against me. Draco, would you please wash his hair?  It's heavy as a thestral's mane."
Cartwright blanched. Beside him, a woman in brown trainee robes coughed and hid her mouth behind an upraised hand. Harry couldn't place her, exactly, but he was pretty sure he had met her and liked her.
"Well, how do I know?" Ron retorted, but more cheerfully. "All this time with Slytherins -- they could be rubbing off on you."
Draco and Parkinson made almost identical eyerolls at his lack of breeding, but Bulstrode gave a nod that looked something like approval.
Madam Pomfrey raised her chin. "Mr.  Potter needs to explain to someone how he nearly died, yet again," she answered tartly. "He has protested that his head of house will be biased in this case, and Professor Snape--"
Zabini shook his head. "Too damn obvious, P-- pet.  Tell you what -- there's a nightclub down Nimue Close."
"Especially as they were, by all accounts, as inherently skilled in glamours as the centaurs are at divination."
Susan Bones straightened from the sofa she shared with Linnet and Caradog. "Hufflepuff for when we need support," she said firmly. "For bringing us together, without excuse."
"Obviously." Harry sucked the tip of the finger in and watched Draco's eyes close. He continued with that for a minute, moving his mouth up and down it in a mimicry of fellatio, until Draco was squirming. That accomplished, he lifted his head away. "For how long?"
It was at least an intense pink, rather than a light one.  All the boys took one, as did Millicent, Ginny, and Cornelia, and consented to the same bright pink. Sophia spun strong cords out of her yarn, and they all strung them.
"Just a mo'. Stay still." The wand jabbed towards him. Harry braced for the tickling investigation of a security spell -- instead, the pressure in his abdomen suddenly eased. "We use hospital spells instead," Tonks said cheerily. "Cuts down on escape attempts.  Do you need the other kind?"
soothe me." At that, she turned to face him, but the tight disapproval on her face was worthy of Professor McGonagall. "I have a perfect right to be angry."
"You want this in your mouth?" Draco rose up on his knees and leaned obligingly forward -- but not quite enough. Harry could barely flick the tip of his tongue across the head of Malfoy's cock and the side of his fingers.
"Something else, then," Harry persisted, "that will make it harder for him to hide. A limp. Loud sneezing fits. Glowing hair."
"Oh, yes! That! I hear you have your own mind, and some new friends." She looked at him keenly. "Are they doing you any harm?"
Draco's eyes widened. "What if someone walks in us?" He looked thrilled as much as alarmed. Harry grinned.
he thought, but he caught the words before they came out. Answers like that were fine when he didn't care (or was trying not to care) what people thought, but hadn't he and Draco decided that they not only should care, but should make an effort to sway others?
"I threw a swing at Ron when he was being offensive," Harry said tightly. "Draco's concerned that it was stupid, and Hermione's concerned that it was wrong, and since I agree with both of them, they can both shut up about it."
"Come here again tomorrow," he said, all the while wondering if she had not thought their bargain sincere, "and follow when I leave. No -- the day after. Tomorrow, let me know what spell you want.  I'll tell Draco you'll be passing him a note for me."
"Oh." Harry smiled. That made sense, and was actually cheering. "Yeah, um, well ... I'm seeing a Slytherin now."
Thursday night, Harry smuggled Draco through the Gryffindor Common Room and into his dorm. No one else his year had stayed. Draco marveled at the view again, and they discovered the window seat was a convenient height for a number of things. They made up for staying up all night by sleeping all morning, barely making it to lunch.  After a cold, but exhilarating, hour of flying, they returned to Gryffindor so Draco could go over Harry's clothing choices for his visit and present him with an early Christmas present of dress robes that he considered suitable for the ball. Harry thought it a minor victory that of his choices, Draco left one entire outfit intact.
Harry left Gentian winning handily with the plastic pieces and bonding with Yolanda. When he arrived at the headmaster's office, Auror Shacklebolt answered the door. Harry looked around for Professor Dumbledore and saw him in a chair by the window, seemingly engrossed in a thin book.  He didn't believe that for a moment.
Draco tsked. "Hermione, of course. Although when Gryffindor lost forty points overnight, there was enough grumbling in the hallway to surmise that it was twenty points each for you and him."
"I need to tell someone who's looking for my aunt," Harry corrected. "That's just where she'd go! Ginny, look after your brother for a little while? He may be slightly loopy for ten minutes or so. Oh, and--" Snapping his hand open from fist to fingers, he Vanished the potion. "Draco, let's go."
Tonks came down to meet them, and Harry felt an embarrassing rush of gratitude when she looked at him with ironic sympathy rather than curiosity or censure. "Come on, loves -- I can chivvy you past the press." She leaned closer. "And I'm bloody glad that
"A supportable assertion," Draco said, nodding at him. "Again, I wouldn't take that wager at the cost."
"Watch it," he whispered, crouching.  Remembering his promise to Draco, he thought he ought to help with the books.  He decided it was safe to let his hands emerge. "Sorry, Bulstrode. I'm wearing an invisibility cloak."
The dog sat, tongue lolling out happily. Uncle Vernon was ranting at Lupin about not being able to keep his mongrel under control, and ordering him off the property without giving him space to leave. Finally, Lupin gave up on his spurts of words abating and turned away from him. He tugged on the lead. "Come along, Harry."
Harry sighed. "I think Ron's been trying to talk to me," he said. "He just doesn't want it to be in front of anyone, for some reason, and Hermione's been hovering any time I'm not in the dormitory, and we're never alone there." He frowned. "Which might be Seamus and Neville hovering, now that I think about it. I should talk to them."
"Please." Narcissa stood straight. She looked pale and slender against the dark wood and stone behind her. It was easy to imagine that she was frail, but Harry suspected her slight form was no more yielding than a steel blade.
"Excuse me," Harry said to Hermione, who was explaining the runic assignment for his Symbology class in rather more detail than he felt he needed. Ginny met him over by the northern windows, where the thick winter drapes helped absorb quiet conversation.
"Quite," Draco said, with a satisfied lift of his head. "Of course, all we had to fill was a Chaser position, but the competition was productively intense. And yours, my dearest rival?"
"Silencing charm!" Harry exclaimed at whisper, and they both cast one, with laughs held in so tightly that they were practically giggles.
"Go ahead, Ron," Hermione said, from where she was sitting on a sofa, parchments spread out on the table in front of her.  "Draco's just been explaining it to me." Another sofa had been moved in from the usual wide arc that worked so well for Friday gatherings to directly on the other side of the table.
Snape's Auror escort stepped through the Floo, and Snape followed without a word of farewell. Harry expected him to be gone when he stepped out at the Leaky Cauldron, but Snape was hovering near the grate, and immediately seized him just under the elbow.
Harry hesitated. "Not right after. I need to show up at the mixed house space for a little while.  Give me half an hour there?"
Ron drank the potion, and then Ginny pulled him towards the empty sofa. He let his head thump back against the cushions, but after a moment rolled it to the side enough to look at the wall -- perhaps the ivy.  Ginny held his near hand in both of hers, and she glared across the low table to Harry and Draco, who had joined Hermione.
After a moment of awkward silence, the headmaster cleared his throat. "Well. That aside, I believe we should discuss the trial. We wish you to be present, Harry, and seen, but whether or not you are called will depend on the flow of the proceedings, understood?"
Hesitantly, Harry leaned forward. He needed to not think about Myrtle, he told himself, as his lips touched Draco's. He needed to think about something else. Sliding into that tub, perhaps, late at night, with the drains blocked to ghosts. Draco's arms came up around him, interrupting the thought, and suddenly he didn't need to imagine anything. Draco's mouth was soft and warm, his lips pressing just as Harry liked, his cheek not yet scratchy, but not quite as smooth as a girl's. Harry played the tip of his tongue along the line of slightly parted lips, and they opened further, inviting. He moaned into the kiss....
"Whatever you want, baby." He loved the feel of Draco's cock -- the narrow, hard shaft, the soft skin, the slide of tight foreskin where his excitement had squeezed out slick drops of lubrication. Harry went from a tight, slow grip to something lighter and faster, and Draco shook in his arms.  No scream of pleasure now, just a shudder and gouts of moon-white spunk, cast out in two short cords and a longer line of oval drops, splayed out like the lines from the flogger. With a shuddering sigh, he rolled forward.
"So," she said, releasing him to pick up a glass of wine, "as I understand matters, you are Draco Malfoy's lover."
"He has a notebook, a hand-sized leather-bound one. I've seen it before. It's for scheduled items and things he does for Malfoy. When I tried to open it, I couldn't, even with charms, but when I used
"It's not all bad," Harry put in. "Houses, I mean. It's good to be with people who don't think you're mad, and I can understand why a school might want to cultivate someone's greatest strength."
"Well, no." Harry found himself confused by the idea. He hadn't really thought about the nature of glamours that way before.
"Of course not!" Harry looked frantically around the room.  There weren't many people inside on a sunny May afternoon, but he suspected that everyone there was listening. "Come on -- we need to talk privately."
"About returning to Hogwarts," Harry advanced. "Could I come back there too? Rather than spending more time at the Dursleys'? I don't want to endanger the Weasleys, but the school is safe, and--"
"I need to run up to the Owlery while I can still be in the corridors," he said, remembering the letter in his hand. "Nice to meet you, Katherine. We can talk more later, if you want."
"In that case, either you have presented your arguments badly, or she has been fighting it extremely hard."
"I get that," Harry said earnestly. "I mean, that's mostly true for me, too. I'm supposed to be able to use Voldemort's, that's all, and I mostly don't feel other people's.  You saw how he needed to have the Mark bare."
He thought he saw Dumbledore's eyes widen slightly, but then the moment passed, and the headmaster's face smoothed to placid concern. "You do not feel obliged to rush matters, I hope?"
"It was rather a personal conversation," Harry confessed.  "Because you seemed down, which should have tipped me off -- I even said it wasn't like you...."
" He licked up Harry's thigh and further in, lifting Harry's cock to expose the soft skin below, and running his mouth back and forth it, before concentrating his efforts at the base of Harry's shaft.
Susan and Linnet burst out laughing, but most people looked confused. Luna, Millicent, and Gilbert raised their hands along with Susan and Linnet.
Harry froze. Ron hadn't spoke to him for a week. Why was he here? Had he brought a professor? He and Draco exchanged a worried look. "Here," Harry called back.
"Well, of course I will!" Hermione exclaimed indignantly. She sighed. "Do you think we'd be better off as friends? No, don't answer that. You've already told me you do.  Though it's not as if you don't have spats with him just as often."
was taking an illegal potion, but I wasn't in substantial danger, and I wasn't hurting anyone, would you tell Professor McGonagall?"
"I know I do," Draco answered, but his head was too high, and his face too empty. "I just don't know if Pansy still wants to have dinner with me. She never replied about rescheduling. And I want to go back to my dormitory, but I don't want to be murdered in my sleep."
Harry's heart seemed to miss a beat. He stared at the boy. Dennis and Colin did start up rugby games in the spring, and were bent on converting their Wizard-born schoolmates to the sport.
"The what?" Harry asked, but Snape motioned him to silence. Frowning, Harry decided to accept that now, and then press both of them for answers later.
. It's like their critical thinking is shut off, but just for me, and if I try to tell them something counter to really ingrained beliefs, it wouldn't work. So if I told Hermione that the N.E.W.T.s are useless, for example, she wouldn't believe me, because she just couldn't believe something like that. But if I told her my revising was on track with the schedule she handed me first week, she probably would."
He nudged Julian, who was staring wide-eyed out at the circle. “Something that worries or excites you,” Gilbert prompted, too quietly for Harry to have caught it without context.
After that had been Blaise teasing him about Dark Arts. He skipped ahead to being called on that and talking about Control Spirit, ending as Draco kept him from talking about the casting.
"Hi. Sorry -- I know we haven't officially met."  He held out his hand to shake, and when she draped hers over it, remembered to raise it for a kiss, instead. She was so little that he had to bend rather low.  "Would you tell me which way Millicent went? I was hoping to speak to her."
"Oh." Draco looked chastened. "I -- No, that's rather different. It's foolish, really, but you've said you won't wait for me while I'm married. Would you, if I married someone who agreed to a divorce after the birth of our second child? There must be women in a similar position to my own, and I could put a time limit on it. It wouldn't be so long."
"Enough, Draco," he said firmly. "And don't make me say it a third time." He lounged back against his pillow. "Instead of taunting him, tell me what you think I should do."
Before he saw writing in the book, he saw Draco. He was leaning against the wall, just around the corner from the stairs, and pulling out his quill.
Luna cocked her head to the side, and, looking far away, gave the matter serious consideration. "I don't think other publications are ready," she said gravely, and folded her hands in her lap.
Harry thought back. "Maybe.  He took a while to sort, I think. And he would have wanted Gryffindor to please his grandmother. But it could just have been the Hat seeing deeper than we did at first."
Harry leapt to his feet, hoping to intercept the intruder, but before he could get around the sofa, Hermione burst into the room, alone.
Harry held back all the suggestions that wanted to tumble out -- the twins, Hermione, Ron, Draco, and others -- and nodded. He reached for sugar for his tea. The beads on his wrist -- two bands, now -- clinked against the porcelain side of the bowl. Dumbledore's gaze flicked down to the noise.
"All right," Draco said finally, throwing himself dramatically back and swinging his legs over the arm of the couch. "I think we are in agreement. I'll make the beads, though -- Transfiguration is too unreliable." Sitting up, he reached for the bottle of Vouvray and topped off the glasses of those who were drinking it, tipping the last drops into his own. Still holding the bottle, he met Harry's eyes with a lift of his eyebrows. Harry nodded.
"I'll be there in a few," she answered, and they parted as a group of students emerged from the Great Hall.
, right? He wants me to win."  Harry yawned, and realized he still hadn't answered. "Oh -- wandless magic."
“I have a toothbrush that vibrates during use,” Draco said proudly, flashing his white teeth. Hermione rolled her eyes.
"You idiots!" Hermione shouted. "All right. That's it! Harry, Ron -- you two leave here, and-- Oh. No, Ron should stay. Draco, you and I are going to the Uncommon Room, and you are telling me everything. Harry, you are taking care of our dear friend, as you
.  Of course you can't understand." Harry looked away, but Draco let go of his hand to wrap an arm tightly around him. "We have this year," Draco said intently, "and most of next, probably. Stay."
"Because Draco Malfoy is your sweetheart, right?"  Yolanda said quickly. Sammy turned and stared. She giggled. "It said so in Witch Weekly."
At the end of breakfast on Saturday, Harry considered Eugene's stressed, pale face, made transparent excuses to Ron, who seemed relieved to accept them, and led Eugene off on a walk around the lake. He paused at the beach where Sirius had almost lost his soul, feeling both saddened and strengthened by the memory. Sitting down on a rock, Harry glanced over at the still-jarring lines of Eugene's body and face, before turning his gaze to the water. "How's it going?"
The hall was quieter than usual after the Hat's song.  Harry wasn't sure anyone else had liked it, although the last verse had given him a thrill of satisfaction. The staff, especially, looked put out, to a one -- except, perhaps, for a stranger, who appeared to be hiding a smile behind his cup.
Relenting, Harry sat down with him. "Of course not.  I don't mean to be pushy; I've just expected you'd want to go faster."
of that makes sense," Draco answered. He raised his hands in an elegant shrug. "And therein lies the problem. I do not know if these curses are less or more likely to harm me than to harm a stranger. To that extent, Justin is correct. The intent is significant in theory -- but in practice, of no value."
"Now, Harry," Remus chided. "I don't like him -- and I'm not convinced that you should trust him -- but there's no need to be offensive."
, right? He couldn't tell Malfoy he didn't belong here, when that would leave him in the hands of enemies.
Harry shrugged, trying to ignore the implied criticism of Draco. Did Ron think Gryffindors couldn't be? "He says Snape has put some protections in place, and Crabbe isn't coming back, since Goyle isn't. Nott is, but you can't have everything."
dueler among current Hogwarts students, don't you? And that Ron Weasley is a head taller than you, and has enough older brothers to complete a Quidditch team?"
"Oh!" Harry blushed. He had a brief impulse to protest that he was bi, but if thinking he was gay would stop Myrtle from throwing herself at him, he could live with it. "I don't think I've ever heard, um, that one. Maybe Muggles don't use it now."
"Drinking?" Potter guessed. "Dark Arts?"  Snape nodded to the first, then hesitated at the second. "With either," he said. "I may have a little talk, or several, with the student in question, depending on how I see the matter developing." He looked archly at Harry. "However, as you are not re-sorting, none of that should affect you.
Change it to what? His heartbeat slowed as he considered the matter. It would be easiest if there was also movement involved, and the trigger was the same. Harry stepped directly in front of the chair to stroke both arms. He didn't need to touch every bit of wood -- from here, his energy would flow downward, filling it all. The room fell silent as he leaned forward.  When he could feel the entire frame of the chair beneath his touch, he seized the curse and twisted.
"Yes, but my department -- well, the Experimental division -- had a candidate we badly wanted last year, and he just got a better offer from someplace in Iceland."
Afterwards, he walked her down to Slytherin. Draco insisted on spending Sunday afternoons available to his house, but that didn't mean they couldn't run into each other. Instead of Draco, however, they overtook the same two Slytherin first-years that Harry kept seeing.
"Maybe. But that just means I need to do it better. Which means I have to find out what Thornton's like and how he talks to Malfoy, and I already have a clue from how he talked to me as you, at first...." Harry's voice trailed off. This was more information than he could collect just from having Dennis trail Thornton around. What he really needed to was something like a Muggle bugging device....
During the trip up to and back down from Gryffindor, they settled the amended story of their encounter with Sirius, and decided that if a dog was necessary, it should be one that Sirius had kept under magical control.  Harry raced off to Defense Against the Dark Arts feeling giddy with hope.
With thought assent, she emerged from his sleeve and curled up in his lap in a golden coil. He could tell she was displaying her bond to him, and found himself proud of her bravery.
"Yes," he said finally. "I'll go with you when you lift the spell, and try to calm her down if she flies into an
"Yes, I get that." Harry's brain was finally past Creevy not being Creevy, and starting to appraise the damage.
Ron stopped in his tracks.  People bumped into Harry from behind, muttering irritably before continuing around.
Harry snorted, and Draco held up a hand. “No – don’t answer. I will try not to be too curious. However, we all heard Professor Hecksban advise the headmaster that she be located quickly, and Severus had a travel cloak on when he made his delivery.”
"Why not?" Draco said coldly. "I would be useless to her. Or no." He gestured dismissal, perhaps to some wayward idea. "No, it would be easily fixed by
"What?" Harry dropped into one of the previous batch of chairs. They were stiffly uncomfortable, but a beautiful match for the sofa. "What's wrong with it?"
At a motion from Draco, he let out a squeak of surprise.  He turned to follow as Draco moved to the side, but lost the slippery length of Draco's cock.
Tom turned his head and dropped the bowl he had been about to fill with stew. It clattered on the countertop, but did not break. He was no taller than Harry, now.
made it a grievance. Before that, it was a matter of understanding my place." He glared down at the remains of his beans. "Now, I expect her to understand hers."
"Maybe less so if they're young. Devary's parents are amicably divorced. He was saying it was difficult for him -- he was nine -- but his little brother just thinks it's normal."
That stung -- because, Draco thought, he knew he was right. "Yet you still told him things you would not want repeated," he shot back.
"Damn it all!" He stomped down three flights of stairs to where a group of fifth year boys were speculating about something related to Quidditch. His boy belatedly noticed his presence and scrambled to his feet. "Creevey!"
As he led her into the huge circle of couples, the musician who announced the pieces said something about getting acquainted, and the girl clutched his hand.
" The spell was a dueling standard and came easily to Harry's tongue. The ropes fell from Draco. As they did, however, something else came from above, landing heavily behind Harry. He whipped around and found himself facing someone masked and cloaked as a Death Eater.
"We did another divination," Harry interrupted. "Scabbers -- that is, Peter Pettigrew -- is in Spain -- Majorca -- as a rat, on his master's orders."
For a moment, Ron looked grateful, but that changed suddenly to a scowl. "No thanks, Malfoy. I'd rather sit with someone sane."  With a dirty look at Harry, he walked up to the very front of the room and an empty seat next to Padma.
While watching Mill frown at it, her breath already steadying, Harry thought she looked more fit then she had before, and wondered if it real, or an addition to the glamour. She'd done her own that afternoon. With a shrug, Millicent moved down the sideboard.
"Oh, very good!" Hecksban outlined the door and windows in orange. "Let's say it's the same. Harry?"
"How dare you!" Pansy's voice was shrill and clear over a rumble of other comments. The glowing words bothered Harry more.  He had put Voldemort's true name on a place that he was trying to keep from him. Now that he saw it, it felt sickeningly like an invitation.
Harry didn't really have any more to write in the letter, beyond signing his name. When he got to Gryffindor, he looked around for Neville, and spotted him over by the windows in the last light of sunset.
Turning his back, Harry released Draco. Draco swayed for a moment, and then shoved his wand back into his sleeve. For that instant, Harry was breathless with relief.
Draco glanced around. Harry suspected he was tallying allies. "The person who led the round chooses color," he amended.
at a new stretch of wall. "His family is pureblood and well off -- at a level with Malfoy's, although they didn't know each other before school for some reason."
"I'll tell you later. For now, don't get upset at my testimony. I've arranged something with McGonagall."
Harry set his hands on Draco's shoulders, and Draco leaned back into the touch. "I did ask to invite Gilbert's family and Linnet's, which Mother would approve of."
"I took Care of Magical Creatures at Hogwarts," Harry interrupted. "I also have a NEWT in potions. Let's move on."
Harry stepped in with a light tread, careful of the edges of the cloak. Hermione would suss him out from errors others might not notice.
"To believe me, I mean," he said. "But it went totally wrong, and you believed everything I said for days, until I managed to lift it."
Reluctantly, Severus stepped into the bath and started to sit down. At the first touch of the water to the lines on his arse, he gasped and tried to stand again, but Draco was ready for this and pressed on his shoulders, pushing him down with a splash that slopped water onto the floor.
Draco arched his eyebrows. “Apparently.  Professors Snape, Hecksban, McGonagall, and Flitwick – as well as Hagrid – are said to be sequestered in a security review with the Headmaster. Thus the cancelled lessons.”
Harry considered that. He was fairly sure Hermione wouldn't tell, once she'd said she wouldn't, which she had.
"Oh, Harry!" Mrs. Weasley seemed almost to relax at that. She smiled a little as she shook her head. "
After one particular dive, in which they had swept past each other coming from opposite directions, looped back in mirror arcs and crossed again, Harry had laughed that they couldn't do that again if they tried, and Draco argued that
At the upper dungeon level, Harry stopped to query Draco in the Liber Geminus, while Hermione watched with interest. He followed the course Draco described, and came to Blaise lounging against the corridor wall. His face lit up when he saw them.
Kingsley clapped him on the shoulder. "Apparently not. If you had Revelation Syndrome it would have shown by now. You may have a lingering tendency to be a bit too frank...."
"Yes!" Leslie said enthusiastically, rocking up on his toes. "And she passed to Lindsey, who scored, and then Jason intercepted the throw from their Keeper, and Ginny guarded him, and we scored again? That was brilliant!"
"The last one wasn't bad, though," Harry protested. "I mean, in the last place I was in, that version of me was a Slytherin, but didn't seem to be a dangerous bigot."
"Oh. Well, good." Harry realized he was petting the chair arm again, and forced his fingers to cease their quick strokes.  "So, it's a brilliant class. The first two months were mostly curse detection and blocking. We did simple transfer and destruction in November, and have just started what's called 'effect mitigation,' which was what I was doing there."
"Ah." McGonagall's mouth again had that decided twitch that meant she was trying not to laugh. "The tamer meaning relayed to us was that it represented a Hufflepuff conquest." She raised her eyes.  "The
Harry nodded. That made perfect sense to him. "No one's sure who cast it," he said, "but everyone's pretty sure it was a Death Curse. If not, it would have faded when the caster died, and so many people of that era have died that the living ones have been eliminated to reasonable certainty. We're fairly sure it wasn't anyone who died at the Battle of Hogwarts, because Jeremiah Blake became an Auror that September. The prevailing theories are Sturgis or Savage, who died that October, or Williamson, who died that December in the Boxing Day Massacre."
? He had never been quite sure if the familiarity was supposed to extend both ways. On the other hand, it probably wasn't ruder than departing abruptly from her garden, and both Sirius and Snape had left him thinking of her that way.
"Oh, how wonderful!" she exclaimed. "I'm finding it exhausting, myself. Your independent project must really be helping you."
“I didn’t see how it started. Nott’s saying Harry threw himself down the grand staircase in a suicide attempt—”
Looking back nervously, Draco made a chopping motion with one hand. "Later. I want to know what you promised Snape."
They had bowls of muesli -- from which Draco had picked out all the raisins and dates -- and some leftover ham, and two cups of tea each, and then Harry spoke briefly to Minister Shacklebolt, who -- as they had expected -- affirmed that Harry had absolute authority over Snape. Once that was over, Harry stiffened his resolve and called Little Alexandria.
At last, they could reasonably say that they needed to freshen up before their return to the trial, and they stood to leave. Draco bowed slightly to Mrs. Weasley and said he was pleased to have met her, and they made their escape while she was still blushing.
Harry nodded. He lowered himself down so his groin rubbed against Malfoy's. The front of his cock slid against the wet heat of Malfoy's ready cunt. He groaned. For a minute or two, they just rubbed against each other, spreading the velvet slickness between them. Malfoy lifted his hips and Harry froze.
"Best would be the body of a victim," she said, still looking blankly past them, "someone he took power from killing. Not my Calvin, no, he was only killed by servants, let him rest--"
"Obviously. But you've been avoiding us, and that won't do. You're going to spend the next three days in the presence of both of us -- maybe one for short stretches if needed -- at all times."
, please remember that the Forbidden Forest is, as the name clearly states, forbidden. Second, the girls' lavatory on the second floor is closed for repairs. Third--"
Sighing, Harry moved to take Draco's hands in his own. "Sorry, but no. Ron's decided he wants to talk about the divination, and has even agreed to hear the details from you, so I told him I'd bring you up to talk."
"Hold," Harry called, the word breaking out of his throat as if he were leading a Defense exercise.  He didn't know why he had chosen dueling language, but it seemed to work, in that they paused, rather than turning the anger on him. He rubbed the line of crescent-shaped indentations on his arm. "I have an idea," he said, trying to sound friendly. "Why don't you both write out a list of what you think is entailed in being a boyfriend or girlfriend -- separate them out into obligations and things you just want -- and give them to each other? Then you can decide what you need to work out."
Draco leaned in, one knee on the bed, and met him in a crushing kiss. Harry grabbed onto his shoulders and tried to pull more the rest of him as close. He wanted to press forward, but couldn't break the chain.  Draco's teeth scraped Harry's lips as he drew his head back.
"First," he said, "you are entirely impressed with my cleverness, breeding, and wit, and you do anything I say."
was the one I used a clipping of in your potion. Rather than adding weight and wisdom to the draught, I increased your focus on physical sight, and the Dreaming head of the Runespoor had no balance."
"We thought Snape was trying to steal it," Harry explained. "Of course it was Quirrell -- or rather, Voldemort on Quirrell's head --"
In accordance with Draco's message, Harry hurried down to the Chamber of Secrets. Draco was there, sprawled across the furry plastic sofa, playing with the lightning cloud. He looked over when Harry entered, and then back up to the floating toy. Harry got no further acknowledgement when he crossed over, so he sat on the floor by Draco's head, with his legs tucked over to one side.
Harry thought Draco might have enforced that with a hex, because Snape didn't speak after that. He didn't even try to turn away, although he did shift uneasily, visibly more and more agitated, as Draco began to thrust. Harry tried to watch, to absorb the burning color on Snape's face and the distension of his dressing gown as his own cock began to rise, but the sensation of Draco moving inside him was too much. His eyes closed as Draco picked up his pace, his hands digging into Harry's hips rather than curling around his cock, where they belonged. He wanted to ask for more attention, to beg for it, but he couldn't bring himself to speak, only to cry out and rock back harder.
"You shouldn't meet with her anywhere!" Ron exclaimed. "She's always been awful to you. Tell her no."
"Oh." Her frown lasted only an instant. "Well, that's still good, but if you're up-to-date with everything else, you should read ahead."
"As it happens," Dumbledore replied, "I was looking for Harry, but it is probably for the best that you were together.  Harry, Professor Snape expressed a willingness to escort you home."
As soon as he started for the sideboard, Professor Snape was in his path. "Here," he said, shoving a heavy goblet into Harry's hands. "I won't have you downing a quart of Narcissa's brew and falling in the fountain."
"Visited my brother Charlie, last summer, if you must know." Ron folded his arms over his chest. "He works at the Romanian Dragon preserve, and was one of the handlers during the Tri-Wizard Tournament."
"I ...hm." She smiled brightly. "I've never kissed a girl," she said, and then, with a triumphant smile, took out a bead from the bowl, and turned it pink.
"Oh, I intend to -- but that will be my personal thanks to my cousin. I want my official consideration noted."
"Just a tiny bit," Blaise said dryly. "He was checking his bed for curses when I woke up, and by the time I came back from breakfast, he'd made it to his pants."
Breathing heavily, like someone about to attack, she stared at him, her small eyes sharp in her heavy face. "Name your price," she said flatly.
Harry shuddered. "Good you did! That would be worse than Crouch. Hm. May this information make it to the Slytherin Common Room? It makes you seem less -- um, whatever -- and him more of a hindrance."
Ron wasn't startled by the mirror. They had come this way as third years, shortly after Harry got the Marauders' Map, and had confirmed that the passageway was indeed blocked. He did give Harry an odd look as Harry tapped the glass and then reached through it to open the door, but he followed Harry through readily, ignoring Draco at his back. His eyes widened as Harry activated the glowing strip on the walls.
"Color, Mr. Potter?"  she asked crisply, as he emerged for the fifth time. Behind her, the early winter sunset was just tinting the western windows with pink.
Harry corrected himself -- was still capable of looking indignant. After a brief moment, that insulted tightening of the lips changed to a curl almost of mischief. "As soon as I'd reached the final stages. I took the trouble to do the full, six-week, potion-enhanced change, however, as
"Try," Harry managed. He could feel the magic setting the words as a contract, but couldn't bring himself to care.  "Angelina hates you. I might be able to persuade her to recuse herself."
Hagrid had come into sight, though he was at a distance on the far side of his hut. Harry realized that the conversation had gone off track. "Anyway," he said, "I'm having trouble with Hermione, over disappearing when Draco's around, and I need to be able to tell him why I do it, so he can give me advice about handling her, or maybe an alibi, now and then. And he could probably help with getting potions components."
"Because malice isn't justice." Draco's hand was resting on the back of his knee, and, deliberately, Harry wriggled his arse back against him. "We probably have to talk this out sometime, but the energy's fading. Tell me what you want right now."
They continued chatting until nearly curfew. Harry had to run up the stairs to fulfill his promise to Hermione.
On Friday, Harry arrived early to help Draco prepare the Uncommon Room. They had not managed any time alone together on Thursday; first he had been pulled into an afternoon meeting of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and then Draco had written in their book that he was busy all evening. Harry knew that part of that was a Prefects meeting, as Hermione had gone to it too, but he was concerned that Draco might be brooding after Wednesday night's class.
"Of course not." Kingsley flashed white teeth in a quick smile. "Though I hope you might consider making an exception for me, in time." He held up a hand. "No reply necessary. Do you consider yourself recovered?"
Harry nodded guiltily. Casting around for something else to think about, he saw the edge of a large envelope protruding from Draco's bag.
It seemed to take forever for the water to go through him, and there was nothing else to do but drink more of it. Harry wondered if he should leave the flying horses Sirius had given him in the Hospital Wing. He hadn't thought about them for months.
"Please do," Draco said icily, his eyes narrowing. "I don't for a moment believe Pansy's theory -- the girl is hardly your type -- but there is clearly
"Oh, very well." Narcissa settled on the chair she had Summoned for Harry, and finally managed to hook the back strap of her shoe over her heel. "So, you must tell me about this class of yours -- Professor Hecksban is the Cursebreaking instructor, I gather?"
"Confidence that you should be believed." With a steady gaze, Harry met Snape's challenging look. "That won't be a problem, sir."
"Sirius," he breathed, and closed his eyes for a moment, afraid to look and see how his words had been reported.
The speaker was Leslie Chase, a fifth-year Gryffindor boy. Harry didn't think the kid had spoken a dozen words to him since the end of the Tri-Wizard tournament. Pushing down his annoyance at being interrupted in a conversation with Cornelia about her new position, he mustered a smile.  After all, wasn't this the sort of situation where Draco and Dumbledore both advised him to use charm? And really, it wasn't difficult to summon a smile after a 230-50 win in the first game of the season.
Tilting his head, Dumbledore waved the matter away. "I did not dispute your account, Harry. I am simply curious as to what he offered to teach. Our good Potions master has several unusual talents, but he is seldom one to share."
"Since they got along with Sajid, I think they'll manage." Harry plopped down in the puffy armchair across from the others. "And those two boys have a Muggle mum, as Gloria knows."
to feel in charge today. He leaned against his boyfriend slightly, and relaxing wasn't as hard as he had expected. He wondered how Draco felt about it when he did that.
Harry took the Knight Bus to the Leaky Cauldron, persuading Stan and Ernie, through combined gratuities and flattery, to let him leave it with his invisibility cloak on. Stan actually held the door to the pub open, allowing Harry to haul his trunk inside. Harry left the unwieldy burden by the door and slipped into the warm front room. He was struck, suddenly, by the memory of when he was thirteen, and he had lived here for two marvelous weeks. It wouldn't be the same now, of course. That was before Voldemort had regained his body, and even with the supposed threat of Sirius Black, escaped convict, he had been free to roam Diagon Alley as he pleased. Now, even if no one was telling him it was too dangerous, he would be aware of how dangerous it had become. The smell of beer washed over him, and incongruously, he found himself longing for tomorrow's breakfast, when the crowd would be thin, and that scent stale and bitter and comfortable.
Harry is widely considered Slytherin's ambassador to the mixed-blood students; this afternoon's scheme clearly did not come from his mind."
On Sunday morning, the Gryffindor team had Quidditch practice, but before that, on the way out of breakfast, Harry stopped his head of house.
"Where was he, there?" Draco asked, ignoring him. "Not in your tent, I gather. Hidden somewhere else?"
"Nodded and moved on, yes. I only told her about one bead. I wasn't going to try a second, because I'd given some general information and thought I might be hitting the limits of the charm."
He shook his head. "No, though I am still annoyed about that, to be honest. It's-- Remember how we'd talked about telling Draco, in September?"
Ginny grinned. "And now you watch. And once you take a bead, you won't be able to talk about it unless you really try." She looked around quickly. "And she says if she's playing or not by the time it's Ron's turn, agreed?"
The kitchen of Darkmoon Den was dimly lit by a low fire.  Behind a curtain, Harry heard a quick scramble of motion, and then Sirius -- shirtless and breathless -- burst out, wand drawn.
Wednesday evening, Draco and Harry arrived early for the second Pensieve attempt. Professor Hecksban was unfolding a protective surface of stiffened leather over the desk prior to returning the Pensieve to it. Harry moved close.
"Yeah, but...." Harry tried to rein in the threads of wild magic that he could feel coalescing around him. "He's
Harry folded back half the thick tails and held them against the handle. He wasn't sure why that made the impact sharper, but it did. He powered the next blow from his shoulder, and lines of red bloomed across Draco's back.
Harry drew his doubtfully and laid it against the cylinder. "About the same length," he said. "I couldn't really keep a grip on it if I put it far enough in."
"I am not!" Harry stopped, both to catch his breath and to look at her. "Look," he said. "I have a schedule, precisely because Draco wants to be sure he's around Slytherin enough. We spend time together on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, so I'm not going to be available then."
"Blaise Zabini." Snape's eyes snapped up and bored into him, and Harry couldn't keep from laughing slightly. Of all the things for Snape to latch onto!
showed up, reporting the ghastly death of respected businessman Howell Aldous Parkinson (survived by his wife, daughter, and infant son). The article made no mention of Harry, but also no mention of Voldemort. Harry's breakfast was turning uncomfortably in his gut as he went down to the Chamber of Secrets to wait.
"It will be easier to walk after a rest," Draco cajoled. Harry could see his point in trying to delay; Ron, when he crossed the Common Room, would be obviously either under the influence of something or ill, but that would only matter if someone was paying attention, and even then, it might not.
"Oh, Merlin, no! It will take a week to get the paperwork started, and then we need to agree upon the questions." In a sudden dramatic movement, she put her hand over her mouth. "Oh, dear me! I seem to have forgotten to record this conversation! We'll need to start again."
"Well, that's the problem." Harry stood. He didn't like Draco looking down at him. "Originally, I had thought here, but Tom would tell Dumbledore--"
A shield spell shimmered in the air. In his arm, Harry could feel the tingle of a recent rush of magic. Belatedly, he noticed that his hand had shot out, quite without any conscious thought on his part, in a flat blocking gesture that bore no resemblance to either how he would hold a wand or to the wand motion for the spell. To one side, he could see Snape, his own wand drawn but not yet brought to bear, apparently just as frozen by shock as Harry was.
Harry shrugged. "Not outright, although I did give them the impression I would. The last thing that I told them was that insulting my boyfriend was a bad move."
It was agonizingly, gloriously, slow. Only when he'd made an inch did Harry pull back, redistribute the lube, and start again, immediately gaining ground.  "Draco. My love."
"Yes. Without that intent, but they do." He leaned back against an empty table. "Now -- do either of you see a more serious risk than the bodies of the dead?"
"All right." Draco's anger fell away, leaving him looking lost. He came tentatively back to the sofa. "You shouldn't hide things from me," he said plaintively.
"Harry...." Sirius rubbed the back of his head, making a mess of his hair. "I can't-- There are things about me that you don't know, yeah. I mean, it's not like we've had a lot of time together, right? But you
He missed his warm weight for an instant, and then the ridges of fingers were replaced by the broad smoothness of a cockhead pressing against his entrance.
for a book?" She stood up.  "Come with me. What I've got is for witches, so it won't cover everything, but there is at least basic safety information. Honestly!"
A hand grabbed his shoulder roughly, and shoved something cold past his collar. Harry was already shouting out a disarming spell as he turned. A heavy body flew back, crashing into one of the massive common room sofas and dropping to the floor with a thump. Inside Harry's shirt, the cold thing was heavy and hard, but it didn't hurt. Susara moved across his neck, apparently unharmed. Every source of fire in the room flared into life at once -- Draco's doing, Harry thought -- blinding them all.
The tension fell from Draco's shoulders as turned his head to catch Harry in a kiss. His hands against Harry's back were enough agreement. When Harry finally stepped back, his hand slipping down to clasp Draco's, their fingers interlaced, and with that, Harry led him to the bed.
"Really?" She didn't look like she believed him. Harry wondered what, exactly, she had heard. Had Kingsley mentioned something in establishing what the Aurors believed to have happened? If the investigation was concluded, he might have. Perhaps he had even said something about that voice.
Relieved to see Snape relax, Harry released his shoulders with a shrug. "It's probably still a week before I can approach the Quiris, though. More, maybe. I think I better not confront Dumbledore--"
"I think she's enjoying this," Draco muttered, as he and Harry stepped out into the frigid air, wearing cloaks from a wardrobe by the garden door.
Dumbledore nodded. “Yet you must try. Mr. Potter’s recovery will be more arduous if she dies still cursed.”
Ron scrubbed at his face again. This time he noticed the blood on his hands, and his eyes widened. Harry tried a cleaning charm, but couldn't manage the gesture. Draco had to step in and do it.
Harry nodded. "A lot more of it." He started to reach for the butterbeer, but then took a chocolate biscuit instead. "She cut me where Wormtail did, and spilled a lot of my blood into the bowl. A cup or more. Snape gave me Blood Replenisher right afterwards. Then she poured a potion on top -- and that's not the nicest stuff, either; Draco won't be able to finish it himself if the Quiris are still here -- and combined them, then scried from that. Oh -- and she painted some of the potion onto her face -- eyelids and around the mouth--"
Draco hesitated. It had been something around the color change, but....  "Something seemed off," he said. "The way he was looking at me.  He was cagey on details, and I led him astray."
"So we say Professor Snape is teaching me to keep him out, but that I may be distracted or disoriented while I'm learning. That covers mistakes in the next week or two, and then I'm fine."
Smugly, Snape nodded.  "Agreed. If he realizes you have slipped under his net, he may well make that challenge. You must present a visage of wounded innocence, or your protests will be dismissed out of hand." He smirked. "Or you could eat twenty pickles, and watch him try to explain to Madame Pomfrey how you have suddenly been poisoned."
"It's very dark," Harry admitted. "And strange, even without that, I think." What sort of wounds did a creature that was only claws leave?
Draco stayed pressed against him, but his voice was level. “Both true. If he thought you worthy, he could be the pinnacle of graciousness. If he did not, you were less than human, and he had no kindness to beasts.” He twitched. “Going from treasured to less than human is
.  They would appreciate honesty as well, and be more likely to work with him if they got it. "As part of defeating Voldemort," he said slowly, "making friends in all houses, so I have allies everywhere, when the war demands it."
