“The Head Auror agreed that I could do this if I don’t let it affect my work in other cases. So, Malfoy you’re stuck with me as your liaison with the Ministry.” He finishes as he stands up.
A cough, that sounded suspiciously like a laugh, from the brunette suggested that he also saw the same body part as Draco in the clouds. Blushing, Draco lifted his brush to fix it.
Of course, with this prompting, Potter just had to show off. Harsh, hissing sounds emanated from his mouth.
It almost worked, she was about to agree with Draco until Teddy let out a shout of “Monkeys.” Causing her bottom lip to jut out in a pout.
A red blur appeared in Draco’s vision as the boy leaned over the man’s shoulder to deliver an apology on Isabelle’s behalf.
Draco delivered a swift goodbye to Harry and Teddy, not wanting to invoke more teasing for taking too long. He pretended he not to notice Potter watching him until he disappeared in green flames.
Looking out of the page was a girl with dirty blonde hair, tied up in a messy bun. Her icy blue eyes were shielded by silver glasses. She was the same age as Macy, thirteen years old, and her name was Jasmine Marie Bramble.
“Come along Kiki. We wouldn’t want to keep them waiting too long.” Draco said, picking her up and walking out the room.
Potter seeing his struggle offered to carry Isabelle, if someone would push Teddy for him. A job Jasmine volunteered for. The brunette approached Draco hands raised expectantly.
“I always have room for a friend, Harry.” Luna’s soft voice floated from the phone.
Draco stood in front of them arms crossed and foot tabbing - his tone firm as he said, “This is getting ridiculous. They left two days ago, I let you tow mope yesterday because I know it’s hard to say goodbye to someone you care about but now, we must get it together. We’ll see them again soon and you’ll be able to write to them.”
Unfortunately, the new spell wasn’t perfect. These alerts weren't uncommon, since they detected anything with a magical aura. Which meant Draco dragged his body into the cool morning air when he felt that electric tingling run across his skin. Even if the sun was just starting to peek above the horizon. If it was up to the young man he’d be in bed for few more hours.
“Besides, it’s not about what the snake says rather about how rare the magic is to get that skill. It could be an amazing tool to understand the nature of magic that is largely unknown.
“Can we go see the monkeys now?”
“Everyone go ahead and dig in.”
He stood there mesmerized by the gelatin- like creatures, until the sound of a camera distributed his concentration. The blonde’s head jerked to look at the intruder, who turned out to be Jasmine. She held an old camera in hand and was inspecting the picture she had just taken.
He didn't understand it, insisting elephants wouldn’t jump over fences and that the words didn't even rhyme correctly. After a while of his rambling, the two children decided they preferred to play with each other, over Draco’s lap.
Draco tried to keep his voice low and steady to lull them all to sleep, but Max interrupted him with a question.
“Can you help me choose my pictures?” He asked, a shy smile on his lips. Max had gotten better at asking for help when he began to feel frustrated or anxious. There were still times when Draco would find Max pulling at his hair and biting his lip. But these instances had declined in the last few weeks.
Macy sat back with a huff and Thomas rolled his eyes with a drawn out “lame.”
It is never acceptable to eat Shepherd's Pie with a salad fork.
But the brain is a mysterious organ. So, that one small glance had Harry moving in the opposite direction of his office. Toward the one person who could always be a distraction from his problems - even if it was by causing another problem for Harry.
“It looked cool in the movies.” Macy said, pouting.
Only a few steps in and Harry was already questioning his decision on coming here. He was trying to decide if he should leave and find something else to relieve his boredom.
“Isabelle, I told you he’d wake up!” Came Max’s indignant voice from above Draco’s head.
So, he selected an empty room closest to the center of the manor. The room had already been stripped of all its furnishing and re-painted by Draco a few months back. He had originally planned it to be an office space, but this was the more urgent need.
He waved his wand, levitating the dropped item and held a hand out, waiting for a small hand to slip in his.
“Good, because today we need to go shopping,” Draco informed them as he cast a hot air charm on Thomas, drying him. “You all are in dire need of new clothes. The ones the Ministry gave you should be burned. I will not have anyone that’s staying with me wearing such things.”
Harry’s muttered,
Once he had shown the kids the entire first floor, Draco took them outside to catch the last rays of light. Macy and Max were both enamored with the floral garden. Using a pruning tool he’d summoned, Draco presented the five with a white rose each.
Draco was glad that the boy was coming out of his shell and finding his own interest. Seeing Thomas’ happiness, caused a swell of happiness of his own. “Wouldn’t miss it for the world. I better be on the way before Harry burns down our house. And next time please tell me if someone is harassing you. That way I can deal with them before you are hurt.”
It was a whirlwind month that passed by quicker then they’d all expected. Twas the night before the three teenagers were due to leave for Hogwarts and they were wide awake.
“Perfect, so you’ll be teaching Isabelle and Max, who is seven.” Draco brightly said.
“Hey, he has the best color.” Max defended Draco’s work.
Isabelle unhappily accepted the other cloth. The three began to clean the mess when Mittsy popped in looking distressed.
The two joined Max and Mittsy at the table, who were both wearing a tiara. Max held out another one to Draco as he sat down to place the cool metal on his head. Isabelle cleared her throat and in a royal tone announced, “Now the tea party of the princess’ of the house can begin!”
“Don’t worry. By the time I’m done with your hair, everyone will be treating you like the princess you are,” he said with a small smile.
Please, Harry. Thomas wrote from Hogwarts and something’s wrong. You’re the only one I trust to watch Max and Isabelle when I’m gone.”
Merlin how was Draco mean to deal with this kind of emotional turmoil. Hell, he hadn’t even confronted his own feelings about this.
“Everyone up! We’re going to be late!” Draco yelled, getting up while throwing a pillow at Thomas. “Come on, there’s no time to sleep.”
He was about to give her a harsh scolding, but her smile smothered his anger for the time being. Draco lifted her up, morning his clothes that were beyond repair. Isabelle reached up to smear mud across the man’s cheeks.
Before he can answer Macy says, “No honey, a date is for people who want to fu-“
Harry gave the boy a smile and held out a hand, understanding that the boy was nervous about him from the time they meet. But instead of walking over to give it to him, Max threw the bottle at Harry; unwilling to get closer to the scary man.
Jasmine and Macy gathered their things to take them to their rooms.
“Thank you, Mister, for fixing my hair.”
That hand lasted for another hour. As the hand dragged on, everyone just wanted the game to end. They began to help whoever was close to winning.
“Take as many as you want.” Max said with a shrug.
“Malfoy, what the hell am I doing in your bedroom?” He said, the muscles in his jaw tightening.
Standing in the entryway were the five kids that Draco had claimed guardianship over. Thomas was leaning against the wall, one leg bent at a ninety-degree angle. His brown- leather boot-clad foot rested on the wall.
“Man, I wish we were in the slash row!” Thomas said as they left the aquarium. There was a collective disappointed agreement from the others.
Potter’s eyes finally fell on Draco, green eyes like acid, “Malfoy, that’s none of- What are you wearing?”
Returning her book back into its hiding spot, Jasmine stood before the map of the mall. Draco took some time as the girls studied the chart to recover his wits and prepare for the upcoming battle that will be this trip.
“What’d I say about mentioning Boy Wonder.” Draco said giving her the side eye, but Jasmine didn’t waver, her gaze steady on Draco.
Harry shoved him.
An insistent tugging of his hair dragged Draco unwilling out of his slumber. He laid face down on a pillow, a weight pressed on his upper back. His groggy mind slow to process the reason he was in that uncomfortable position. Before remembering the previous night.
Nagini would then leap, jaws gaping. She'd be close enough that Draco could count the scales on her face and see the poison dripping off her fangs. The dream always ended there, with Draco jumping out of bed, arms raised in defense, his breathing labored.
“Quill, please.” Isabelle said.
Draco stepped to Isabelle’s side. “Let me take a look.” After inspecting those small hands, Draco let out a gasp. “My goodness, you do have potato hands. Fortunately, I have just the cure.”
“We have your back.” Macy said, wrapping her arms around the three.
Draco took the spot beside the boy amazed at the number of photos around them. Max had taken pictures of everyone.
Tilting his head back and forth, Draco let out a sigh. No matter the angle his clouds somehow always resembled a certain part of the male anatomy.
“No.” Snape said. He had been desensitized from that look for many years now. The sugary look dropped from Draco’s face.
“There’s always time for sleep.” Thomas grumbled through a yawn, but left the room still wrapped in his comforter.
Draco flinched from the volume, he hoped that it wouldn’t draw any attention to them. Pulling his hood to cover his face once he was sure they had no witnesses.
Draco reprimanded her on cleanliness and how the petting zoo was not the place to play in the mud. Isabelle nodded in understanding not looking abashed in the slightest. Harry then comes sauntering up, holding Teddy in one arm and in the other hand was his wand.
Potter’s face softened, “She looks pretty dead to the world to me.”
“Good morning!” She greeted.
“She’s only four Snape. She’s too young for Hogwarts.”
“I’ve got this.” Draco said teeth clenched, frustrated.
One leg bounced against the floor as another documentary about the wonders of nature started.
Not for the first time, Draco wondered what he had been think when he'd left for the orphanage.
Max made a face, “I wouldn’t want to talk to snakes. They’re scary!”
Thankfully, Thomas took pity on the crazy-eyed man and scooped Isabelle up, allowing Draco to hold Max’s hand. Both took turns nudging the two older girls in the right direction.
He had half a mind to ignore the shout but both Max and Isabelle stopped for the brunette. Potter ran up to them, painting in hand.
“Do you think I’m that easy to corrupt, Draco Malfoy?”
Macy cheered in excitement. Mouth still filled with toast, she exclaimed, “It’s been forever since I’ve had a true shopping spree. Where are we going, Diagon Alley? Hogsmeade?”
“No more fights for me.” Macy made a cross over her heart.
But as the group approached a lone hut in the center of a field Draco began to doubt Potter’s intentions.
Following the sound of the voice, Draco saw Isabelle jumping up and down in a puddle of mud. Clumps of the brown substance grasped in her hands, and mud streaked across her face.
“I can’t talk to idiots.” Draco said, a hand to a temple. He walked away, breaking whatever trance that fell over Potter. And he was quick to chase after the other man.
“Thank Merlin,” she exclaimed, a wide smile on her face. She reached for her wand and waved the slender piece of wood, making several files fly into her hand.
“Do you know how hard it is to draw with a quill?” Thomas questioned when asked about it his bag, now full of materials, clutched close to his chest. “These muggle inventions called ‘pencils’ are amazing.”
“Get the potion now.” Despite Draco’s rudeness, the healer looked pleased. A vial was already in hand as she directed Macy to a bed and resumed looking over her injuries.
“I’ve never been to the muggle world,” Max nervously said.
“Please Uncle Snape.” Isabelle said, flashing the portrait a sweet look, identical to Draco’s.
“What are you all looking at?” He asked, pretending to not know exactly why they were.
“Oh no!” Max exclaimed.
He muttered the charm,
Draco marched to his wardrobe his mind going a mile a minute. He needed t get to Hogwarts fast, but he couldn’t leave Max and Isabella alone. The two children trailed behind him their expressions mirroring his own worried one.
Draco continued like this for a good distance, thankful that Max wasn’t too much bigger than Isabelle. Regardless of how light the two felt when he first lifted them, his arms were beginning to burn with the strain. He swore then that he’d start workout his arms more and invest in a stroller after this trip.
Much to Draco’s misery and to everyone else's amusement, the group didn’t split after the primate exhibit. Draco was ready to part ways after they traveled through the jungle habitat, but Potter bribed the children with ice cream, the prick. Although, Draco hadn’t put up much of a fuss; it was free, and it would help to cool them down after the sweltering jungle.
The blonde man reached for a random apron, he didn’t care all that much about his design. But Potter’s voice called for his attention.
As Draco spread the healing salve across the cuts, he asked, “Why do you scratch at your arm so much?”
The group burst through the magicked brick wall of platform 9¾. The train was already stationed, the only people left on the platform were parents and a few stragglers that were nervous to leave. In the windows boys and girls could be seen waving to their families. Others hid their face to avoid any embarrassment from their parents.
“If you all insist, then I recommend clothing that can give you a wide range of movement.”
Delighted at gaining the blondes attention, Isabelle ran full sprint at him. Before Draco could stop her, the small body slammed into his legs and dirty fingers tangled in his shirt.
“Wait, what did you mean that Harry Potter would find you?” Thomas asked, an eyebrow raised.
“Of course, he’s not poppet. Mr. Potter is being the one being a prat. It’s his own fault for scaring you, he should know better than to throw blame and call you names.” Draco gave Harry a hard glare and got a contrite look in return.
Sure, he had some strange infatuation with a younger Harry and he’d be the first to admit he handled those feelings badly. Who knew that making fun of someone and their friends wasn’t the correct way to woo someone.
“Go on in then,” Draco prompted, giving her arm a gentle push to spur her on. Her hold tightened once more before loosening, then letting go completely.
“I can wait.” Max answered meekly. Draco set his hand on the smaller’s head, noticing the slight wince at the contact. He took a mental note to continue with small, caring contact. From what he has seen, Max hasn’t had many affectionate gestures directed toward him in his short life.
Attached to the document was a picture of a young man with brown hair and hazel eyes. The image showed the boy glaring at the camera before abruptly turning his head away. Draco’s eyes roamed over the words scratched on the page.
Thomas quickly placed the animal back on the ground when Harry turned his back. He reached for the hand cleaning station beside the gate and furiously scrubbed off the germs now on his hands. Sighing in relief once his hands were disinfected.
“Oh I know, last year a Madam Puddifoot’s Tea Shop opened up in Diagon Alley. I heard that she now serves these little pink cakes that will bloom as different types of chocolate flowers depending on the customer's mood.” Macy was quick to answer, looking at each person expectantly. No doubt waiting for their agreement.
“Thank you, Isabelle.” Draco ruffled her hair before leaving the room. The lack of footsteps behind him had Draco turning around to call for the young girl. But when she emerged from the room Isabelle was wearing a purple shirt.
“He’s right. I’m the one who's sorry. And look I’m fine, it was only a surprise.” Harry said holding up his hands in a surrender position.
Draco pulled the plug from the drain and lifted Isabelle up, wrapping her up in a warm, fluffy towel. Rubbing her back and arms to dry her off.
“Blood over water.” Macy muttered, avoiding Draco’s eye.
Thomas was the one that answered. “That look says if a teenage boy is going out of their way to follow another, he's done so because he has a crush.”
“What is so funny?” The green-eyed man growled, his dark aura stopping the laughter.
And Thomas suggested using his as kindle for the fire, but begrudgingly accepted it at the elf’s insistence.
He studies the three teenagers as they walked ahead of him, they all acted older than their age would dictate. All Draco worried about at that age was if his mother's package of baked goods would arrive that day or his next step to annoy Potter.
“You know who my parents were,” Draco started, trying to find the right words.
Draco couldn’t stop a huff of amusement from leaving his lips or the small smile from forming, even if he wanted too. Seeing the movement of Draco’s face muscles, Harry beamed even more. For Harry, Draco's smile was a rare sight, let alone one that he had caused.
“Ya. Those with bad parents." Her shoulders hunched further, to make herself smaller.
Max shrugged, “I don’t know, When I’m scared or worried it helps.” This was said in a voice so small and quiet that Draco was lucky to be close enough to hear it.
“She’s already picked out three other pairs.” Jasmine nods at Macy’s pile.
“What about Mr. Potter?” Isabelle said. Seeing that the man was still occupied with his admirers, Draco wrote him off as a lost cause.
When a thought struck him, “You’re not supposed to be here are you?”
“I would have appreciated a please somewhere in there, but yes you can use the camera,” Draco huffed.
“Or we could go to the Sanctuary here in England,” Jasmine spoke up, her book tossed aside. “It’s one of the largest zoos in Europe. The place is famous for their many biomes spelled to mimic environments from across the world.”
The older man eyed the wounds that littered the small body as he worked.
When he appeared in the Manor, his potions room was his first stop. The potion had turned a murky grey color from overheating. Draco sighed seeing this, the mixture was a lost cause. He bemoaned the three months of wasted work as he vanished the contents of the cauldron. Tomorrow he had to start all over.
“No, Malfoy this is important.” His green-eyed stare and serious tone made Draco swallow.
“Potter, what are you doing here?” Draco asked, eyes narrowing in suspicion of the other man’s sudden appearance.
“Come on, you helped paint half of it after all.”
“How is that even possible?” he asked in disbelief as the others laughed, having escaped punishment. And that's when the stare down between Jasmine and Draco began.
Sneaking a look at Potter, who was helping Isabelle straighten her canvas, Draco would have to remember to thank him. Merlin, he was growing soft.
They were finally done. Max was the only one not resting on the grass. Instead, he’d was passing out water bottles to the exhausted group. When Mittsy turned up with the seven bottles Max immediately claimed the task of giving them out. He handed Draco one and smiled brightly at the head pat he received. That is until he realized there were only two bottles left, one for Harry and one for himself.
“I’ve had to look after these troublemakers for way too long. No one wants to adopt these types of kids. I must say the Ministry has been slow answering to my complaints about these five. I don’t want them going around corrupting all the good children,” she complained, giving Draco a disapproving look. Like the inability of the Ministry was his doing.
The three looked much more relieved and relaxed the rest of the night. Macy finally choosing a turquoise polish, announcing that it was the color for Draco. Once his nails were completed to Macy’s professional standards, the fire was extinguished, and everyone laid down for their much-needed rest. But before they fell asleep Thomas cheekily quipped, “Who would have thought you’d be so sappy, Draco?”
“Who’s the adult here?” Draco grumbled, straightening out his robe.
“Wow, Mr. Potter your clouds look so cool.” Isabelle praised. She wasn’t wrong, the man’s clouds looked very realistic.
“This potion is amazing. I can’t even feel this.” She said, while poking at an unusually large bruise on her shoulder.
Draco had no idea where she stashed these books.
Draco closed his eyes and rested his head against the door, weighing the pros and cons of keeping it shut forever. Reluctantly, he re-opened the door to admit the two and led them into the tea room.
Their seats were arranged with a set of three facing another set of three, a retractable table between them. Isabelle immediately claimed a window seat, kneeling on the chair to stare out. Max sat in an aisle seat, afraid of getting sick by seeing the scenery as it blurred past them. Thomas took the other window seat and already had his eyes closed ready for a nap. Macy took the middle, still dazed from all the new stimuli. And once Jasmine finished asking questions about the train, she pulled out a book and began to read.
It was a little area marked with a rickety, wooden fence. Enclosed inside were small animals such as goats, rabbits, sheep, and kneazles. Parents followed their children as they roamed the area. Making sure they didn’t harm the animals and remained injury free.
The ride eventually came to an end, the squealing of the breaks waking the passengers.
“I guess it can count as your act of heroism for the day, as I’m sure you’re compelled to do at least one each day.” Draco said, trying to school his face into a neutral expression but couldn’t mask the mirth in his eyes.
“I’m not even going to bother answering that question.” Draco said, leading the kids to the rapidly depleting seats. The room had begun to fill whilst their backs were turned.
Draco ruffled the boy’s hair and nodded.
Jasmine stood off to the side, her hair up in a bun like the one she wore in the picture. In her hand was an open book titled
“Bye-bye Uncle Snape.” Isabelle said with a wave.
In a crevasse made by Macy’s trunks were two stowaways. They were crouched, huddled together to take up as little space as possible while remaining hidden. Thomas let out a snort and went to go extract Draco from Macy’s octopus like grip.
“Sorry, but the thought of Draco hurting us." More laughter erupted from her. "I’ve seen puppies that were more ferocious. He’s all bark.”
Straightening his posture, Draco made his way back to the house. Trying but failing to shake off the ominous feeling that had started growing when he’d seen the raven. He dodged trees and stepped over large roots jutting out from the ground, his paranoia increasing his speed toward the safety of his home.
Mittsy already had dinner cooking when they stepped out of the fireplace. But first, Draco had to make sure that Isabelle and Max were scrubbed clean of all dirt.
Frustrated, Draco turned sharply and walked away from the child. The girl’s sobs followed him out of the alley. He took a few more steps before Draco spun around, cursing his altruism.
“We are not talking about that.” Draco commanded, facing the boy-who-lived once more.
Draco would know, his father had forced him to memorize entire lineages of prominent pureblood families. With his curiosity piqued, Draco scanned the only paragraph on the page:
“I agree. Muggle clothes are designed with different styles and colors. Which means, they can express themselves more thoroughly then with we can with robes,” Macy recited.
Taking in a deep breath, Draco agreed (anything to get away from the other man) and told everyone it was time to go. Completely ignoring Harry.
They continued about the zoo, roaming from one exhibit to the next. Seeing the different creatures such as the jobber knolls who, according to Jasmine, were silent until they died and grizzly bears. The last of which prompted a debate between Thomas and Macy about who would win in a fight; a bear or a shark.
Draco returned to laying on the ground with a groan. How is this his life.
“Mr. Mal-”
The announcement distracted Max long enough for Draco to remove the boy from his back and held him to his chest. It seemed for the moment he wasn’t going to fight Draco.
“No, if I’m forced to go out, it’s going to be to someplace interesting not lame,” Thomas directed that last bit at Macy.
A large brick house adorned with small windows loomed in front of them. Circling the place was an old rickety fence that had its white paint peeling and missing in a few places. Above the door was a sign that read, ‘Orphanage for Wayward Witches and Wizards.’
As they found their seats, Jasmine asked Draco how the train worked because she hadn’t seen a chimney for the steam.
“I’m not touching them. Do you know what kinds of diseases they can carry?” Thomas said, shuttering at the thought. Draco crossed his arms across his chest, nodding along with what Thomas was saying.
“Than that settles it.” Draco says, picking up his fork, “You all will stay here, at least for tonight. If you change your mind later, I can help to find a stable place to live.”
Making a quick stop at a deserted corner half-way through their shopping trip, Draco shrink their many bags, so they could walk around more freely.
“You coward!” Draco taunted at Thomas, trying to fend off both goats and failing.
Reluctantly picking up his twelve cards, Draco said seriously, “You better pray it doesn't reverse, Jasmine. Because, I have an arsenal here with your name on it.”
Before taking the first bite, Draco cleared his throat. “I think it’s time to discuss your situations. As I said before, you all are welcome to here. But if there is another place you’d rather stay, like a friend’s place, I’d help make the arrangements.”
“I don’t believe I have another one.” Was Harry’s guarded answer.
Goosebumps formed on his arms when he thought on the stories about the messengers of bad luck, ravens. Seeing one so close to home, especially a magical one, could only mean something unfavorable is around the corner.
“Call me Harry. I’m not on the job right now.”
“Yes! A story,” Isabelle agreed.
“Oh, you want to be a singer?” He asked slowly, testing the waters.
Scowling, Draco threw the pillow back right as Jasmine walked between a couple of pillows in her arms. His throw hit the unintended target on the side of her head. At Jasmine's astonished face, Macy let out a high-pitched laugh.
Max leans close to Isabelle and whispers, “Can I go on the date with Draco too?”
As Draco approached the girl, the image on the front of the book became clearer. It depicted a half-naked Adonis, Janus Rosier, posed proudly in front of a grand stone castle, in his arms Beatrice Whitby swooned.
Outnumbered, Draco resignedly said, “Fine, let’s go to the monkeys. But then we part ways, Potter.” A finger pointing at said person’s chest.
The next morning, Draco stood at the mirror appraising his reflection. He looked wrecked. Eyes red with dark bags, evidence of the late night. His hair damp from the shower and mussed from the towel clenched in one fist. The blond locks tickled his cheeks where they rested, moving with the man’s slight motions.
“I have to stay out of trouble to stay on the team. You, Max, and Isabelle are still coming to see the game, right? It’s a charity event this time around so you better come early to get a seat.” Thomas said, his expression honest and open.
A resounding crack from the branches in front of Draco, had him jump and his wand arm rose in defense. The woods were silent then besides the sound of Draco soft breathe. His eyes narrow, straining to discern a figure between the branches.
“Yep! Of course, can’t wait!” Macy squeaked out, enthusiasm forced into her tone. Her eyes never leaving her hands, unable to meet another's eyes.
Thomas ignoring the call, turned and buried his head further into the pillow. Pulling the covers up to hide himself from view. The rest of the children were gathered around the table when a loud shout from the first story bedrooms got their attention.
When Macy presented the group with one of her own, Draco felt a ball of dread in the pit of his stomach.
“Draco?” Luna inquired, braking Draco’s observation of her tattoos.
“Malfoy Manor?” Thomas read the inscription on the top of the gate.
“Of course. I should have known.” He sighed. Draco turned to McGonagall, “There you have it Headmistress. Now, I say punish Crystal and let the kids go to class.”
This letter broke the proverbial camel's back. A viscous anger rose up inside of him. Draco would prove that he can move on; he didn't need them.
“OK, nobody panic.” Draco tried to keep everyone calm, even if dread was running through his veins.
“Now you all go on Mr. Potter and I have some things to discuss. I’ll head in soon, with luck without the interloper.”
“Of course not, Father made sure I had the best tutors in England.” Draco said, nose in the air.
This hung heavy in the air, Thomas kept his eyes trained on his lap thinking over what was said. The golden snitch kept drawing Draco's attention, with a flash of gold or a fluttering of wings near his ear.
Before the war, Draco used to do an hour of yoga a day, even at Hogwarts. He would sneak out after dinner and do his favorite poses in the fresh air at a deserted part of the grounds.
“Luna said to head to her studio soon.” Harry informed the whole room. A cold silence from the other occupants of the room met his statement.
It wasn't a lesson he acted on often; Draco loved to argue, after all. But he did know when to use it for his advantage.
“They’re saying you’re starting a new Dark Order.” Potter’s words froze Draco, the door half closed.
Thomas punched Draco’s shoulder lightly, “Take good care of Max and Isabelle. Remember they need three meals a day.”
Draco’s nod of confirmation had Thomas blurting, “That has got to be the most ridiculous and pompous thing I have ever heard.”
“You are a child of dark wizards who supported that evil and insane man. Your lives are never going to be easy.” Draco said, looking straight into Thomas' eyes.
By the end of the session their paintings were beyond repair and their skin marked up in with all the colors available.
Gathering the two’s chosen shoes, they went in search for the others. They finally found Jasmine and Thomas sitting with their shoe selection sprawled around them. In Jasmine's lap was a pair of light blue Vans, and Thomas had on a pair of gray Nike sneakers and black converses.
His clenched jaw preventing the bitter and angry words from escaping as he followed the woman down the hall.
“We can do that?”
Naturally, Harry ignored that. He strolled into their shared office space determined to find the piece of evidence that would crack this case.
“We can hang them on your wall. As for the rest, we'll sort them in an album for protection.” Draco said.
At this moment, Draco understood Gryffindors better than he likely ever will again. This plan, although rushed and short-noticed, had somehow worked. None of his previous schemes had worked out as well, despite the hours he took to plan them.
But Harry was here because Draco was his last hope of getting any sort of entertainment today. He would rather be at the office tracking down the arsehole smuggling exotic creatures into the country, but Terrence’s back was acting up, so Harry had the day off.
Her words ran together as the feelings that had been building inside rushed to get out. She let go of Draco’s hand, so she could hug her knees close to her chest for comfort.
A throat cleared, “Gentlemen, I don’t see you painting. Do you need some assistance?" Luna said, watching the two with a careful look.
Macy laughed, “Merlin no, I know exactly how I sound and with Thomas as a brother I never hear the end of it. But I love composing with a piano or guitar. Plus, I’m not that bad of songwriter, if I do say so myself. Which reminds me, I noticed a Grand piano in one of the rooms.” She said fluttering her lashes up at him.
Macy sat beside Jasmine’s feet, her legs crossed beneath her body. She hunched over a parchment that was covered in lines and notes. Occasionally, she would straighten, eyes focused in thought, and a quill tapping her bottom lip leaving ink smears.
“You didn’t finish the story,” Thomas said, words slurred slightly from tiredness.
It’s been a week since the confrontation with Potter and Draco had been tense every minute of it. He’d half convinced himself that Potter was going to retract his testimony and he will be back in cuffs, waiting for an available cell in Azkaban.
“You can’t just come in here and do whatever you want.” Her face was turning a purple color. Seems she’s not used to being ignored.
“I told you Macy, four trunks are too much.” Thomas claimed as he watched his sister huffing as she struggled with her load. He had opted out of placing his single trunk with the others, deciding to carry his himself.
“Yeah, that’s good. But his clouds are bunched up weirdly.” The girl critiqued.
Draco’s lip twitched; this boy would fit right in at the Weasley’s home. The boy refused to look straight at the camera. Instead, his eyes flickered about the room never resting in one place for long. The name on the form read Maximus Jacob Hawkes, seven years old.
“Mister!” Isabelle yelled, gazing up at Draco in awe, “You came back, Mister.”
As she did so, Draco's breath shuddered when he caught sight of the bruises, cuts, and burns on the small body. If the others had just as many wounds and scars, he’d need a second bowl of salve.
“Well,” Draco said, absentmindedly stroking the skin under his thumb, “what if we made a plan together so one day they’ll can be sorted by size, the next by color, and so on and so forth?”
Macy, Max, and Isabelle remained silent during the whole trip. During Draco's last walk with Isabelle he couldn't get the girl to stop talking. So, it seemed strange that she hadn't uttered a single word.
The scene could be mistaken for one of the Manor’s moving pictures for all it had changed in the past few days. Although today, Thomas had decided to grace them with his presence; a rare phenomenon to be sure.
“Are you all ready to go?”
“And why did you fight with your fists? You’re a witch – please tell me this isn’t a habit you picked up from Potter.” He directs at Macy, missing the eyebrow arch from McGonagall.
need to start our workout.” The blonde said gesturing to the kids, “So, if you want to talk it’s going to have to wait until afterward.”
Macy and Thomas were looking at the board games. They decided in a card game called
He was having an excellent morning. Mittsy made his Earl Grey tea the perfect temperature. His omelet contained two eggs, bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms; exactly as he liked in. After breakfast he went on a pleasant walk through the ground's garden, even with the slight chill in the air.
The blonde man used a simple spell that hung the little girl’s clothes in the closet, while she organized her stuffed animals on the bed, faced toward her. Once they were all placed to her satisfaction, she began to pace in front of them like a general in front of her army. She was still explaining the rules of the room to her new friends of when Draco left the room: no being mean to each other, clean up after yourself, and no staying up past bedtime.
Thankfully, the journey to the zoo was a simple one, it was only a Floo trip away. Thomas was the first to go through the fireplace.
The brunette's forearms rested on the strollers handles, a teasing glint in his green eyes.
“Don’t look at me like that. I told you if you brought that many trunks you’d be responsible for carrying them. And what did you tell me...”
The worst of it was on his right forearm, it had both scars and cuts crossing each other. During his bath, stray fingers would occasionally brush along the wounds before they were jerked away causing waves in the water.
“Nothing.” Draco said, starting to walk to the building. Thomas acts so mature sometimes that Draco has a hard time remembering that he’s only fifteen.
“Yes, I have been busy. As I see, so have you.” Snape said, eyes trained over Draco’s shoulder with a raised eyebrow.
“If you three don’t leave this instant, I will show you what it means to pay,” Draco threatened. He doubted anyone would do much to punish the three miscreants for bullying the girl.
“Who do you think-” She choked off with a look from Draco, who walked past her and went to Macy. She turned her head, eyes avoiding Draco’s own. He gently took her chin in his hand to move her face into better lighting. He tutted in sympathy.
“You’re not from the Ministry, are you?” he asked, stepping in front of his sister protectively.
“That used to be my mother’s favorite novel.” Draco spoke up, nodding to the book in her hand. Which Jasmine set aside as the older man sat in the chair across her, obviously he wasn't leaving anytime soon.
He'd started brewing a potion back at the manor and it looked like he wasn't going to make it on time to save it.
“What? Who said you had bad parents?”
He felt Isabelle crawl to his side, but instead of lying down like he expected she poked his cheek.
The kids left, with only one look back from Thomas whose expression seem to say,
Of course, Isabelle had the time of her life as they traveled down the mountainside. She pretended that they were in the middle of an earthquake. Max was soon roped into the game, he was the citizen-in-distress that Isabelle was to save.
Just based off the number of Potter's ideas that worked out for him, Draco should have realized recklessness was the best tactic.
By the way, McClain coughed in his hand and Harry shifted his feet, they did not.
Even Mittsy wasn’t spared this blanket of despair that seemed to have fallen over the house. She hadn’t even glared at Harry when his toe got caught on the edge of a dais holding a family heirloom.
“You shut your mouth. I said we need to talk.”
In the next couple of weeks Mittsy proved to be a godsend to Draco. She was able to get most of the supplies that the three students would need for the upcoming year. But it seemed like every other day one of them remembered something that they had to have for classes.
Just to prove Harry wrong, Thomas marched up to a group of rabbits hopping happily around and picked one up. He held the floppy eared creature away from his body, already regretting his rash decision as the rabbit squirmed in his hands.
Isabelle was back talking a mile a minute. Max would squeeze Draco's fingers every now and then. Checking to make sure they were still there. Behind him, the beginnings of an argument between the three teens could be heard as the blonde climbed the steps to the entryway.
Jasmine had her book out, continuing to read when her questions were ignored. Thomas was the only one with anything to say, but it was always to throw insults Draco’s way.
Draco blinked, surprised at the amount of research they'd done on this topic.
Brown eyes looked up at him as he asked, “What’s bothering you Max?”
They looked like they hadn't seen a shower for weeks.  The boring, Ministry- issued, grey robes were disproportionate for their bodies. The hems of Thomas' trousers were tight on his calves, and Jasmine had to keep shoving her sleeves up her arms.
“You can wear that one tomorrow Kiki. Mittsy took that shirt for cleaning.” Draco compromised, hoping that the use of her nickname would soften the scowl on her face.
Satisfied with Isabelle’s agreement to the question, Draco called out to the others that it was time to head out. Max looked hesitantly at Draco’s offered hand with mud coating it.
The small elf’s long ears perked upward; her left ear slightly higher than her right. She had a long, pointed nose that upturned at the tip and wore a green cashmere gown that fell to her calves. Her woolly socks covered most of her lower legs, and brown knitted hat with holes to accommodate her ears.
Meanwhile, Isabelle looked despondently at the ground, where one foot was idly kicking. Her small hands gripped onto the straps of her pack.
“You said Hercules had twelve labors he had to complete?” Jasmine asked.
“Shouldn’t children be in school?”
“I’m not following you. Teddy and I have been here long enough and if I don’t get him back home before dinner Andromeda will kill me.” Harry said with something resembling a pout.
“Shh!” Harry cut the man off as he was gearing up for a rant.
A discarded can was snagged from the street and a transfiguration spell muttered. The dented can shifted until it molded into hair-cutting shears. With his new tool in hand, Draco approached the girl once again.
Max stood off to the side, mud splattered, a victim to Isabelle's movements. He used a hand to keep Teddy behind him to prevent any random flecks of mud from getting on the younger child.
Draco downed the brown mixture in one go. Shuddering at the disgusting taste, he braced a hand on the wall as his body changed. Once the disorienting feeling passed, Draco checked the mirror to ensure nothing was out of place.
He swatted at the annoyance with less force than intended due to sleep-heavy muscles. Quiet giggles sounded after the movement, and the weight on Draco’s back shifted. A loud ‘shhh’ was attempted between the two kids.
“Thanks, I think the green paint really brings out my eyes.”
“Don’t say that!” Draco snapped. “Just let go of my arm Macy.” He said trying with little success to shake her off.
Before Draco could defend himself, he felt a tug on his sleeve. A goat had started to chew on his expensive, silk shirt.
“What do you want from us?” Macy voiced, picking up on Thomas' uneasiness. As she tried, unsuccessfully, to shove her brother out of the way.
He was free to make his own decisions and beliefs based on his experiences.
“It’s on fire though.” Max said, chewing his bottom lip.
“You don’t know him like I do. He aligned with Voldemort, and never had anything good to say. You want me to believe that’s the kind of person who should be raising kids.” Harry exclaimed.
Draco nodded to himself after a short scan of the washroom revealed that Mittsy had thought of everything. A stool stood in front of the toilet and the sink, a kid’s toothbrush was in a glass cup with strawberry flavored toothpaste lying beside it, stickers of fish fastened around the tube to prevent slipping, and towels hung on a rack magicked to keep them warm.
“What happened?” He demanded urgently.
“I am not signing that Potter.”
“What the bloody hell do you think you’re doing?” Draco yelled, jogging toward the group. His shout startled the older children, the sliced hair and scissors dropped to the ground.
Bless the siblings, they were egging Potter on, but they didn’t know what they had done. Draco could practically hear what little common-sense the man had leave and by the looks of it the Boy Who Lived was about to do something stupid.
“Thank you, Luna.” Harry said with a smile. He would forever admire Luna’s ability to forgive those who’d had wronged her.
“We’re here.”
“Clean our mess.” Max answered.
“You don’t need to apologize, Jasmine. If anything, it’s the adults who created this system that should apologize.” Thomas passionately said, sitting up once more to deliver his speech.
“Aww, can’t you just use magic to clean it up.” Isabelle complained.
“Impossible. Potter hated me.” Draco argued, his tone dark as he thought back to a cold, wet bathroom.
Unfortunately, Draco’s brain, like brains tend to do, could only focus on the abysmal events. His mother fell sick while awaiting her trial, dying soon after. Draco was informed of his parents’ fates only after his own trial had concluded. Then, the Ministry tossed him out leaving only a bitter taste in his mouth knowing that he was now alone.
“No, don’t listen to him, he’s telling it all wrong. It wasn’t like some type of fairy tale, we didn’t ‘meet’ a hippogriff. I was attacked by one.” This statement was successful in catching the others attention, and curious eyes fell on the somber blonde.
Draco pulled up the covers to the boy's chin, tucking him in. Both said goodnight to each other before Draco walked out, leaving the door open upon request.
Terrence McClain was an older man, skin worn and wrinkled, his spine curved with age. His voice crackled like that of burning wood from smoking for most of his life.
In a more subdued tone Max agreed, “I would rather stay here then to get sent somewhere else.”
As he turned to leave Thomas called out, “Draco. Thank you, seriously.”
“Oh, right. I forgot about that." Draco said. He bit his lip looking worriedly at Isabelle, who looked back with a smile.
Draco didn’t understand how muggles could stand such greasy food, although the kids didn’t seem to mind. Thomas scarfed down a slice of pizza that had a layer of grease coating the top and the three girls decided to get burgers and fries that left their fingers sticky and wet. While Draco and Max opted to eat Chinese food, the least greasy option in all the choices.
Draco stood at the entrance of the mall and sent a silent apology to the parents who he'd given dirty looks for their messy appearance and wild kids.
It was at breakfast when Mittsy came in with an owl perched on her head. In the elf’s hands were a stack of three letters that were addressed to Thomas, Jasmine, and Macy.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Potter.” Harry screeched, launching into the air. He slowly turned to the portrait of Snape inside a wagon that Max pulled. His face pale, a hand clutching the material at his heart.
Max looked dead on his feet, swaying side to side with eyes half shut. Jasmine inspected the mound of blankets and pillows with interest; Thomas looked mad.
Once everyone had found nine to ten casual outfits, some formal clothing, and several sets of pajamas, they called the trip a success. Even Draco couldn't resist the temptation, getting several articles of clothing for himself. Shoving their shrunken purchases into their pockets, the group headed to the food court for an early dinner.
“It’s OK. You won't be going anywhere near your parents or Azkaban. I promise,” the older man said giving Maximus’ arm a gentle squeeze. Only taking a step back when the boy had relaxed enough that he wouldn’t continue his previous actions.
His mother’s garden had always been a sanctuary for Draco. A place where he could relax and bask in the sun. He’d often sought out the garden when he felt overwhelmed. During his tumultuous teenage years, he had practically lived there.
“Try it like this.” Potter said, walking to Draco to correct his technique.
(It would end up looking something like this)
When he had rented the apartment already fully furnished, he had planned to replace everything with new furniture, but as time passed, he had less and less motivation to do so. And now he was content with the old, ugly pieces that decorated his place. Harry spent most of his time at the office anyway.
“Sorry, Mr. Malfoy I’m afraid it’s not that easy. We have a no fighting policy, so unfortunately both girls must be punished.”
Standing beside him, almost a head taller than his older partner was Harry Sodding Potter.
When he retreated, an apron was in his hands and painted on it was a classic prince outfit.
“Kiki?” was the soft response.
“Ah, yes,”
“Absolutely not! You can't interrogate a minor without their guardian present. And as I am their guardian,” Draco left the statement open, letting the others fill in the blank.
“Come on, Malfoy. I swear I won’t bite.”
"Look, this is my Manor and you all are welcome to stay here,” Draco explain. The uncomfortable twisting of his gut telling him the potion was about to wear out.
It felt like his skin was shrinking, and Harry had to move- to do
Macy was the only one who had redeemable manners. From this, Draco suspects that Thomas was purposely trying to annoying him with his conduct.
“I’m sorry, Mal-Wait, I mean, I’m sorry, Draco. I should not have used that spell on you, it was stupid and reckless. If I knew what that spell did, I would never have cast it.”
“Anytime Harry. If you come by in about an hour, I should have everything ready.” Without so much as a ‘goodbye’ Luna ended the call. Harry was familiar with this as Luna refused to end a conversation with a goodbye claiming it was bad luck.
“It is as they all say: the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, and both of us know this bundle is rotten."
“If I may, Auror Potter.” Jasmine said, adjusting her glasses, “I wasn’t privy to your fights at school, but I’ve heard of your rivalry and Draco’s bullying tendencies. In fact, when Draco revealed himself I was prepared to run. But after diner with everyone I thought one night wouldn’t hurt, and one night turned to two and here we are. I never met the Draco you knew but the man I know is not him.”
Heaps of food were currently occupying the Malfoy’s mahogany dining table. It was an array that would rival Hogwarts first day dinner.
“Draco, Stop.” Potter wrapped a hand around Draco’s wrist.
When Teddy was lifted out of the stroller, Isabelle took his hand and led him to a goat chomping on a clump of grass. Max was right beside them the whole way, a determined to look after the two and keep them out of trouble.
“You have to be gentle, Teddy. If you want to be friends with them, you have to be careful.” Isabelle explained to him as she demonstrated the correct petting technique.
A whirlwind of emotions ran through Draco as Isabelle said those words- anger, pity, sadness. ‘Death Eater' isn't a name that should be thrown around, let alone an accusation toward a child.
His eyes swept over the five, Draco noticed that each kid had an identical pack to Isabelle. He assumed that the packs held all their belongings judging by the lack of other luggage.
What Harry wasn’t expecting was the strong shock he’d received when he touched the door handle. No counter charm he knew would break the curse placed on the door knob. It wasn't until the fifth shock, a numb hand, and various co-workers snickering for Harry to leave the Ministry.
“Look it’s
It’d been quite some time since he had played quidditch and the snitch seemed to be provoking him, causing his body to tense in annoyance.
He called for Mittsy to initiate the plan.
If Potter were anyone else, he wouldn't hesitate for a second to go out with the man. But unfortunately for Draco’s libido, this was Harry “I’m better than everyone else” Potter. Harry “I can beat you at everything” Potter. Harry “Green eyes as bright as an Avada Kedavra” Potter. Harry “messy hair, chiseled jaw, sun kissed skin, red lips… Draco mentally shook himself before his mind could wandered farther.
“Well then, do you have any favorites?” The boy took his time to contemplate the group of photos, before placing his chosen four in hand.
A loud silence fell, all eyes on the boy wrestling his feelings down into a more manageable state.
The public needed some place to direct such strong, collected feelings. And since the Death Eaters were out of reach, they turned to their damned children to enact their own version of justice.
A/N: Here's the fourth chapter, I hope every one enjoyed it and please let me know what you think. My family and I actually had an Uno game that lasted for two hours, and my mom described it as her personal hell so that's for you mom. haha.
“This is the best the Ministry can produce?” came the condescending voice of Thomas. “It really is pathetic.” The final word dripping with disdain. Draco could feel a headache coming on.
The brunette man looked at them with wide eyes. He was pushing along a stroller with a young child within. The child tried their hardest to inspect every aspect of the surroundings, leaning forward as far as the straps would allow.
Inspecting the few injuries Macy had, Draco applied the medicine onto her wounds.
The nasty expression on the three boys’ face marred their otherwise handsome features. A strong sense of nostalgia bubbled in Draco’s chest when he saw that look. After all, it was an expression that he had caught sight of in the mirror often enough, not too long ago. Memories from Hogwarts assaulted him. All if his mistakes and arrogance thrust to the forefront of his mind.
“It’s an easy fix.” Potter persisted, ignoring the other’s warning.
“Ya, Jasmine said that it has a lot to do with balance and flexibility. There’s even a pose where you touch your head with your toes by laying on your stomach and bending your back until the two meet.” Thomas mentioned, casually sensing a weakness in Potter.
“Oh, ha ha very funny.” The blonde man dryly said, before he found himself trapped once more in Macy’s arms. This one with less yelling, but with more tears. Macy’s head was buried in Draco’s chest making her next words muffled, “You had better write to me!”
The angry teen opened his mouth, ready to deliver a scathing remark to the older man when he walked in. That was until he caught sight of Isabelle and Macy, and his anger quickly cooled into concern.
“OK good, Now let’s get you to bed.”
In a way, Draco knew he was lucky. With Potter’s testimony, he had avoided a permanent stay in Azkaban. In fact, the court hardly gave him a slap on the wrist. And with a life-long sentence in Azkaban, Lucius was no longer the head of house passing the title to his heir.
“Come on guys! This way,” Macy called over her shoulder, already heading toward the first store, a shoe outlet.
“Um. Excuse me... what’s your name?'
Removing it from around his neck, Draco continued, “He said it was to remind me that though I’m a Malfoy, I also come from the noble House of Black.”
Draco got his revenge by drawing a heart on Max’s wrist and Isabelle’s forehead.
“Then we go to court. I’ll take on you and Hogwarts. Trust me I won’t lose I have the best lawyer in the country.”
Harry Potter. His pictures don’t do him justice.” One of the women commented, eyeing the brunette.
“What the- Potter are you stalking me now?” At Draco’s exclamation, Harry snapped out of his state of shock and back into his natural state of sarcasm that always seems to come out around Draco.
“Can I get either of you some tea?” He asks, honey-sweet. McClain accepted with a head bow, Harry remained silent which he took as a no.
“Ok, I’ll watch them.” Harry gave Draco a once over. He straightened, looking puzzled. “You look nice?”
“I suppose they are, but they all can't be scary.” Harry said, giving Draco a meaningful glance. But, the other man didn't want to decode the symbolize in his words, so the sentiment went ignored.
“My Aunt Andromeda got her name from this constellation,” he said, tracing the outline of princess Andromeda. “It’s also called the Chained Maiden, since the princess was chained as a sacrifice for her mother’s boasting. Luckily, a young hero came along to rescue her.”
“Jasmine, w- you,” Draco started, trying to collect his words. When his eyes fell to the instrument in her hands he wound up saying, “Where’d you get that?”
Draco startled before jumping into action, helping Jasmine and Macy with their luggage. Even Thomas grabbed two of their cases.
“Hey what’s that supposed to mean?” Came Macy’s indignant response, as she rubbed the side of her head that he pressed against.
“You’re telling me I trusted you and this school to keep my kids safe while I wasn’t around, and you failed and you now want to punish Macy because she wanted to defend herself. Is that right?”
“Those are some pretty words.” Draco said around the lump forming in his throat.
The older man tried to correct these behaviors. Really, he had.
“Shit, Draco I’m sorry.” Potter said.
Potter fumbled with his wand to return it to his pocket, “Malfoy, I’m-”
“We can if it’s the guardian that is under suspicion of abusing said minors,” Potter replied, smug.
It was an idea he had last time they’d all slept in the living room before Thomas, Jasmine, and Macy had left. No matter the number of blankets and pillows that covered the floor it was no replacement for a real bed. Draco’s back couldn’t stand another night on that floor.
Max wanted his eye shadow done in bright green and blue which Macy was all too happy complying with. Artfully applying the makeup so it resembled scales.
“Do I have permission to speak now?”
“Oh, that’s mature.” Thomas says with a laugh.
“I know not. This note Young Master Thomas sent.” Mittsy said, passing over the parchment in her hand. Draco’s brow wrinkled as he accepted the paper, they’d received a letter from them a few days ago. A letter this soon after was out of character.
Grey eyes met brown, “I understand that life can get bad and stressful, and you need a way to escape, but this,” Draco ran a thumb across the edge of the bandage, “is not a healthy distraction. Can you promise me if you feel like that again to come find me, it doesn’t matter what I’m doing or what time it is, OK?”
Her eyes squinted in the sudden light. She brought the steaming cup of tea, wrapped tightly in both hands, closer to her chest.
Maybe the hero won’t barge in, a curse on his lips, ready to vanquish the enemy, but that's not what Draco needed.
Unless she was a seer, Draco doubted this woman knew anything about these kids. Even then, he'd never put much stock in the art of divination after meeting Professor Trelawney.
“It’s not fair but that is the truth. So, staying won't help your social standing but I’m offering a place to live free of abuse and suspicion that you all experienced.” He continued. “Now, once you all are finished with dessert, I’ll show you around the Manor.”
“What were you doing? Were you trying to give me a heart attack?” Draco exclaimed, striding to them. He knelt to check them over for injury.
“How about theses, Kiki? Look, they’re pink, and they light up.” He finished the statement by hitting the shoes together, causing the lights on the soles to flash.
Draco seemed to have run out of child friendly insults to throw at Harry and was trying to set Max on the floor. But the boy had a handful of Draco’s shirt and refused to put any strength in his legs to keep him up-right.
“We all can go on the date, that way it’ll be more fun!” Isabelle cheered.
Macy stood next to Thomas looking bored as hell. Her wand twirling expertly between the fingers of her right-hand. Draco caught notice of her perfectly manicured nails, painted bright red. He’s eyes were drawn to the tiger print on her thumb. A smirk formed on Draco’s face as the sight procured a memory of Pansy practicing her skills in the art of nail polish. She spent first year with horrid nails due to this.
Macy scrambled toward the shelves, the others followed at a more subdued pace. Draco stayed with the two youngest, herding them into the kids’ section.
Jasmine was more hesitant, but when Draco held is arms open to her it wasn't long before she wrapped her arms around Draco as well. The hug didn’t last long but both gave a tight squeeze. Jasmine cleared her throat as she took a step back, a slight blush on her cheeks.
So, all these people wanted to meet the Hero, Draco scoffed. Potter probably carried around a quill for this exact situation.
Like Thomas, who’d conveniently forgotten that his school robes were now a couple of inches too short and only mentioned this to Draco four days before the train ride to Hogwarts. Let’s just say that Madam Malkin was not happy about the short notice and he had to give a hefty tip to soothe the ruffled feathers.
“Yes, you look quite impressive, but you have something just here.” He used his thumb to wipe a streak of flour from Draco’s cheek. He could feel his cheek warm under Harry’s touch. The brunet stepped back his voice soft, “There, perfect.”
In periods of high stress, the child used pain to distract himself from the cause of anxiety. A bandage was wrapped around the area to protect the healing wounds.
“T-that sounds fun.”
Draco knew he was glaring, but neither seemed to notice. Before the stranger could say anything, Luna stepped onto the small stage and announced the start of the session.
“Don’t forget mine.” Draco said.
“This is where you live?” She nodded in conformation.
The kids dipped their hands in the paint and flung it at each other and the older men. Potter gave Draco a wink as the kids joined in, then picked them up so they could place a hand imprint the blonde's cheeks.
“The difference between me and you, Thomas, is that I know my limits, and I know for a fact I’m not good with animals. Not even crups like me.” Draco said matter-of-fact, once his laughter was back under control.
“I said no.”
Now with clean teeth, Isabelle was placed on the bed. The blonde began to smear the ointment over every injury he found on her body.
“See! But next him don’t throw the object instead roll it to him or place it on the ground for him to get himself.”
Ultimately, Jasmine won the 'fun game.'  Draco disagreed, mumbling that it was 'a game from his own personal hell." Nonetheless, he still demanded a rematch as they exited the train and began the short trek to the Manor.
The crunch of grass signaled Harry following him, “Did you just call me Harry?”
“Does that make you the pauper?” He threw back, tying the strings around his neck.
“I’m not going to drop her.” Harry assured, reading reluctance in Draco’s body language.
A struggle ensued when Draco had first presented the clothes to the elf. Mittsy shed many tears that day. All the while, throwing everything within reach at Draco with surprising accuracy.
Macy was too focused on brushing off soot that had fallen on her clothes to look out the window in amazement.
When they had finally claimed a cluster of seats on the busy train, Thomas withdrew something from his pocket and slammed it on the table in front of everyone. He removed the hand, revealing a colorful stack of cards that had
“When Master Draco be your age, Master Draco be wanting only tomato soup and sandwiches,” she recounted.
Draco wasn’t having a good night’s sleep. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw an image of He-Who-Should-Not-Be-Named, Voldemort Draco cursed himself. He’s dead, despite the phantom pain he felt on his left forearm during nights like this; he shouldn't be afraid anymore. The grisly man would always have Nagini coiled around his feet and remained silent. He’d look down at Draco from his perch and lift a single finger.
It was such a simple thought, but true. And surprisingly enough it did make him feel more at ease. So, he informed everyone that he was going to try to relax by doing something that he hadn’t done in a while, yoga.
“Out of the two of us I don’t think you are the one who needs to apologize.” Draco choked out.
Giving up on Isabelle, Draco moved on to Max who was being equally as difficult. Where Isabelle refused to move, Max started to squirm when Draco got him in his arms.
The woman at the front desk was swift to fetch the facilities director, Suzie Tally, once he'd made his made-up position at the Ministry known.
“Br-brood?” Draco choked out.
Draco slumped in his chair, disheartened. Until an idea formed.
“Who’s that?” She said, climbing onto Draco’s lap.
“No one is going on a date. I wanted a change.” Draco announces, frustrated with the conversation. Putting a pout on Isabelle’s face.
Yet, Draco couldn’t recall them having a child, let alone a ginger haired one. Both Hawkes were blonde, and none of their ancestors were able to pass down that gene.
With a sly look, the begets how the rest of Draco’s day would go, Macy opens her mouth.
Jasmine let out a gasp and whispered scandalized, “You didn’t bow to a hippogriff?”
“Aww! But your interactions are still so famous in the house. Mr. ex-Prince of Slytherin,” Macy gave a snide remark. “According to the older years. You were the only one who would, and I quote, ‘show that righteous prick what’s what.’”
The Ministry had no claim to the Malfoy's fortune or properties once Draco took on his birthright.
“Really Potter, if you can’t keep up you’re welcome to sit out or better yet leave but stop distracting my kids.” Draco said before continuing to the next pose.
Max shrugged, “They were still coloring when I went to get my camera.” And sure enough, Isabelle and Mittsy were sat at the table, brightly colored utensils scattered across its surface. Isabelle’s tongue stuck out at an angle, her arm moved in wide arches pressing hard on a sheet of parchment.
A mess of flour, egg shells, butter, and chocolate batter spread across the marble. Some of which had landed on the three during the cake making process. Draco dreaded bringing out the frosting and sprinkles once the cake was finished in the oven.
Draco took a deep breath before addressing the room, “The only advice I can give you all, is to never give in. Keep your head held high and wear your house colors proudly. Show them you're not leaving, and that their hatred and prejudice won’t win. If there is one thing, I learned during the war is that hatred will never win against determination and-” Draco pinched the bridge of his nose before muttering, “I can’t believe I’m going to say this, - love.”
The boy clambered out of the tub in answer. The water splashing against its porcelain prison as he did so.
“Malfoy?” Harry said, stunned.
He waved a wand at the candles to light up the way as he walked. When they arrived at the dining room, he just-about jumped a meter in the air when the light revealed a figure sitting at the table.
Draco made a face as he surveyed the mess they’d made. He guided Isabelle and Max to Luna, but before he could utter a word, Max spoke up.
“Thank you,” Maximus responded quietly, giving the man a small smile and disappeared into his new room.
Choking on his pumpkin juice, Draco shook his head as he coughed, “No, we are not going to discuss Potter. In fact, his name or any other aliases of his are forbidden in his house.”
“Yes, but why?”
The rest of the meal was filled with jokes about his haircut. They call it playful teasing, Draco calls it harassment. While Isabelle continued to pout from his rejection and Max sat looking sad.
He began when he was fourteen with his mother. When Narcissa returned after a visit from France, she’d introduced Draco to the exercise. She said that it was good for the mind, body, and spirit; Draco loved it.
Smiling Draco emptied the tub and gestured to the clothes, “Go on and get dressed.”
“No, I’m not from the Ministry, and I’m sure you don’t have anything I need. I'm rich enough that I want for nothing." That came out more conceited then he'd attended. Draco paused to gather his thoughts better before starting over.
“I don’t want them to leave.” Max said, at the same time as Isabelle.
Draco remembered the disgust in Frank’s blue eyes when they were introduced. The barely veiled insults spat about Draco’s styled hair, thin frame, and fashionable clothing. As if Draco's less then rugged appearance threatened Frank's own masculinity. Lucila Hawkes wasn’t much better; always a step behind her husband, a cutting remark on her tongue.
The four sat at one of the long tables with a couple who were making goo goo eyes at each other. Harry and Draco shared a similar look of disgust at their display. The two men choose to sit on either side of the kids, so if they needed help, they would be there.
Did Draco even deserve this apology after everything he had done? A whirlwind of confusing and contradictory feels erupted, threatening to drown him.
“Draco, you’re someone who appreciates the finer things. Which do you prefer?” Macy asked, modeling off the shoes by turning her body left then right. Both shoes were stylish, one reached mid-calf with no heel. The other boot was ankle-height, with a slight heel.
Seeing that he wasn’t going to let it go, Draco took the offered quill and signed his name.
Draco watched as Max pushed the chocolate chunks around his ice cream bowl, his head rested forlornly in a hand. Every now and then the ginger would release a heavy sigh that caused his frame to slump further in his chair.
Using brown paint, he drew a circle where Potter's ocean was beginning to form. “There it’s looking better already.”
“What’s a date?” Isabelle asks Thomas, who answers the girl saying. “It’s when two people want to get to know one another better, so they go out to places. Like the forbidden forest or the owlery.
Draco wasn’t nearly old enough to be called 'mister,' but it was unlikely he'd ever meet this girl again, so he’d let it slide. With a swift 'Good evening' Draco left Isabelle.
“Well,” Draco started, enjoying the way both Macy and Thomas leaned forward to catch his every word. Merlin, he missed being the center of attention, “it’s because I’m a Malfoy,” he finished.
“Wait.” Max called, causing the group to stop at an intersection. He stepped to the foliage that lined the path to take pictures of the large, colorful flowers. They moved out of the way of the path.
Then, something burst through the leaves with a loud shriek and swooped at Draco. He ducked down avoiding the sharp talons of an ink- black raven. The animal disappeared into the forest, and he watched as the spell shadowed the creature.
“This is my room just in case I’m needed. The rooms on both the first and second floors have been prepared for guests, so you can take your pick. Each room has its own washroom and I had Mittsy pick out some old clothes that will fit you, should you need clean clothes.”
Then looking at Harry in concern, eyes wet, “I’m sorry! Are you hurt?”
Another small voice spoke up from his other side. “Leave him alone. I want to stay with Draco.” Max said, standing behind Draco, his shaky hands tangled in the blonde’s robes.
Draco kept apologizing to them, ignoring the comments regarding his nonexistent love life. Max and Isabelle wouldn't accept the apologizes until he agreed to go on a date.
Jasmine tried to refuse a makeover, but Draco told her that if he had to be subject to this so did she. The other girl looked into Draco’s darkly outlined eyes, accentuated with a ‘smoky’ eye shadow. Then, to his painted lips, strawberry red, and gave in. But warned Macy from expecting the same when they were at school.
Amused, Draco answered her unasked question, “Yes, you can use it. My parents believed that it would benefit me in some way to know how to play an instrument. It’s going to need a good tuning, though, it hasn’t been used since the…” Draco voice trailed off.
“Oh! Gross!” Macy said, her face seemed to cave in on itself, her hands used to cover her ears, “I don’t want to hear that.”
Macy and Thomas chose rooms on the first floor. Thomas explained, quite unnecessarily, that he wanted the room farthest from Draco, and Macy followed to stay close to her brother. Jasmine decided to claim the room that was closest to the library.
“You’re not dressed in you Auror robes,” Draco observed, sizing up the man.
“I’m sure there’ll be plenty of time for me to finish it later. Now sleep.”
A panicked Draco began to herd a confused Macy and Jasmine out of the room.
Even the kids have noticed his mood. They kept trying to distract him, Isabelle and Max keep inviting him to tea parties. And Macy would ask for his advice on songs she was writing, “They don’t sound right when I try to sing them. I need your help.”
He took a shower of his own and left methodical instructions on how to wash the mud splattered clothes for Mittsy. Although, he suspects that his clothes won’t be salvageable.
He poured the milk in a cup, adding a dash of honey and cinnamon. Casting a warming charm on it, an idea began to form in his mind.
“Thank you!”
“Hey, I’m going to get Isabelle ready for bed. I’ll come back to help you next if you don’t mind waiting.” Draco told the boy once he opened the door.
“Once again, no. This is a trap. Did you forget who taught you this tactic?”
“Now, I’m going to need you to stop crying and sit still. So, I fix what those horrid children have done,” Draco said, twirling the scissors around a finger.
Snape gave the younger man a pointed look, the two stood there is silence until it dawned on Draco. The blonde's posture drooped.
(See the end of the chapter for
Max nodded, “I promise”.
As Draco stared into the flames, Isabelle crossed his mind. It seemed that other kids were punishing those with criminal parents and none of the adults cared enough to put an end to it. Draco hadn’t given a thought to the Death Eater children who were still minors.
charm, sighing at how late it had gotten. He went in search for his other three charges.
Snape's nose wrinkled when the word 'Uncle' was used to introduce him to the child.
And that sentence might have had the most innocent of intentions, if it wasn’t for how Potter had said it. Draco almost tripped at the tone and a red flush rose on his cheeks. Not for the first time, Draco cursed his pale complexion.
“Yes, we are. So, if you would quit with your negativity, we could have great time,” Draco said.
But he had no doubt that his father loved him. Draco never feared in his presence.
McGonagall looked stunned, “I can’t just punish one girl and not the other.”
“I don’t want to go back.” Jasmine’s voice was quiet and hesitant, like she was unsure if she should be sharing this secret. Nonetheless her soft-spoken words were heard by everyone in the room. “I know that sounds stupid, but I don’t have many friends. None that I can really talk to at least.”
“Yes, I need you to prepare a few rooms and make enough food to accommodate guests.” Draco told the elf.
“Mittsy, I need you to get Harry Potter and bring him to me.” Draco crouched down to look the house elf in her eyes, “And listen to me very closely here. I don’t care how busy he is. I want you to grab him by the robes and drag him here.”
The two of them were beginning to get along, and of course, Draco had to go mess it all up again.
Mood worsening once he'd heard that most of his classmates returned to Hogwarts for an eighth year. The golden trio included. Even Slytherins, that weren’t killed or jailed, had the opportunity to go back.
“That- That doesn’t matter. You were one when you were sixteen.” Harry lashed out.
“Or if you need someone to buffer your exposure to Macy you can call on me.” Thomas said, pushing Macy’s head out of the way so he could see Jasmine.
Unable to stand the stifling quiet, Draco asked, “Why don’t you want to go back?”
“Is everything alright Mittsy?” Draco asked.
“Where have you been, we’ve been waiting for ages.” Isabelle said, bounding to Draco to grab his hand.
And Thomas wasn’t helping the situation at all. Instead, he started to cheer for the goat and even gave it a name, Jasper.
“Now we match,” was the delighted explanation.
Draco looked on in horror as Isabelle regaled the table about her first meeting with him, the turkey half chewed in her mouth.
“She’d get along famously with Hermione.” Harry whispered, into Draco’s ear.
Harry rolled his eyes at Draco’s dramatics, “That was your own fault. You should have just bowed to Buckbeak, before you approached him.”
All his bravo seemed to leave him, “Yoga?”
“I should tell you that one of the adults is Draco Malfoy.” Harry hesitantly said. Keeping his voice low so his words wouldn’t reach the man now sat with the kids on the sofa.
Isabelle nodded her head, following Potter’s instructions closely. Her clouds looking more even.
Summoning his hair trimming kit, Draco brought the razor to the side of his head and flipped the switch. Buzzing filled the room, and soon delicate blonde locks fell to the floor.
And really that flash shouldn’t have brought the image of his school hood rival into the forefront of his mind. The stranger’s hair was darker blonde rather than the iconic white-blonde of the Malfoy’s.
Despite the look of concentration set on his face, Draco wasn’t deep in thought. Instead, his mind was occupied with keeping track of the birds flying around the willow. But since ornithology wasn’t one of Draco’s many skills, he’d had little success in his endeavors.
There was no one left to fear. He couldn’t change his past, but he can choose how to live in the present. So, he had better make each decision count.
Damn, He’d honestly forgot all about that term in his release. Until next year, the Ministry could barge into his home and anything was found that they didn’t like he’d be dragged away in chains. The kettle whistled, causing Draco to jump.
Little did they know that they’d soon experience the taste of betrayal because of this seemingly innocent game. The rules were fairly simple, so it wasn’t long before they were flying through rounds and the game was getting cutthroat.
“I’m too old for a story,” Thomas said but rolled to face the rest of the group.
Draco lifted their three paintings and started to head out.
Draco considered giving Thomas one, despite fully expecting a rejection from the boy. Giving in, the blonde handed the final flower over the boy. Thomas’ face was guarded as he accepted the rose, but later the flower could be seen protruding from Thomas’ front breast pocket.
Currently, the dark-haired girl had her eclectic collection of nail polish scattered across the floor. Her expression focused as she contemplated the small vials in front of her. Isabelle already had her nails done with a polish that allowed the color to change with her mood. Macy had commandeered Draco’s hand and was trying to decide which color would fit best on the man’s nails.
“I like it.” Isabelle says, emphasizing the
“Stop! Draco’s my friend and I love him so stop being mean.” Clutching his hand tighter, as if to squeeze the others harsh words away.
Thomas Franklin Nitwiker was fifteen years old and taller than Draco, if the record was to be trusted. As his eyes continued to skim the page, a splurge of text caught his attention:
“I’m a huge fan Mr. Potter and I am so grateful to you and your friends.” The man gushed using a handkerchief to dab at his forehead. Harry signed his name on the painting with a quill and handed it back to the man.
Draco stood and gave her a nod.
“Why does everyone think I have a hero complex? I’m just at the right place at the right time.” Harry said aspirated. Draco was about to argue the point when a shout interrupted him.
Draco would be the first to say he deserved punishment, but somehow, he’d been given a second chance. Isabelle shouldn’t be condemned for what was out of her control. One as young as her shouldn’t have such sad eyes.
“Draco, Mr. Auror man’s not doing the pose correctly.” Isabelle tattled, drawing all their sights to the man still in mountain pose.
“Draco? Hello?”
The image of Draco as a puppy, barking, sent Jasmine into her own fits of laughter and Thomas gave out a loud snort. Not wanting to be left out, Isabelle let out a boisterous and fake laugh.
Thomas responded, “We all could do with a little relaxing.” Which had everyone nodding in agreement.
“When I was born my grandfather, Cygnus Black III, gave me this,” Draco said pulling out an astrolabe pendant. It was old and clearly well loved. The pendent was circular and made with the finest medals, its design was intricate and complex.
Mittsy directed Harry to a room where Max and Isabelle were lying across a plush looking sofa. Max's face was buried in the cushions while Isabelle’s head hung off the edge, her legs resting against the sofa’s back.
“I was declared innocent. You do remember, right Potter? You were there after all.” Draco grounded out, teeth clenched. Harry was at a loss of words at that, so Draco continued, “So unless you’re here to arrest me I want you both off my property.” Then slammed the door shut.
He paused before saying, “If you really want my advice, I’d say don’t bother. It’s lonely and stressful at the top. There are only a few people that you’ll be able to trust. You don’t know the number of times I wished I’d just enjoyed my time at school without all the pressure to be the biggest and baddest. It’s not worth it,”
Once dried, Draco helped her into some of his old pajamas, silently thanking his mother for hoarding his things. The outfit was slightly too big on her small frame, but it would work for now.
Merlin, Harry thought, those pants leave nothing to the imagination. He was busy appreciating Draco’s strong legs, shapely ass, and the little bit of creamy skin that was showing as Draco’s shirt slide down the blonde’s body, when a high-pitched voice ratted him out.
“Of course. These are your dragons and they’ll be here every day, so you can have them lined up in any way you want, whenever you want them.” With that, the two planned out a schedule that Max liked. By the time they were done, Max had visibly relaxed. The boy gave Draco a giant grin as they moved on to the organizing the clothes like Max wanted.
“See the brightest star in the sky? It’s called the Dog Star, or Sirius. My cousin was named after it,” he said, pointing to the correct star.
Quick as lightning Draco struck his revenge.
He received an enthusiastic response from everyone at the recommendation. They encouraged and expressed interest in the activity. Even Thomas said that he’d join Draco, which was a testament to how on edge he'd been.
“But Draco I’m bored. Can we go play outside now since the sun is out?” Isabelle complained.
“That I’d be able to handle it.” Macy grumbled.
“Well they’re not hippogriffs but saving you from a pair of evil goats must get me some points, right?” Harry said, looks up at Draco a crooked smile plastered on his face. A smile that did funny things to Draco’s stomach.
“Others like you?”
“Right away Master.” Then she was gone.
Jasmine ruffled their hair, “I’m going to miss you guys. Eat a slice of Mittsy’s cheesecake for me.”
From there he could see the five children, all in varying positions around the room. Isabelle and Max sat on the rug with their favorite toys scattered in the space between them. Jasmine was once more reading out of a thick, hardcover novel. Gold lines wove together creating a complex pattern on the cover. Her back rested against one arm of the couch and her legs stretched out in front of her; lounging on the couch.
He wondered if the teenager should be reading those books, knowing they could get a little raunchy. But the thought was quickly dismissed. After all, he read the same books at a younger age and he'd turned out fantastic.
“They’re not that good.” Draco muttered with another glance at Potter’s painting.
Draco turned his back on Harry to herd the kids back onto the path. When Harry casually said, “Are you sure you don’t want me to come with, you know just in case you run into a stray hippogriff?”
“You see, most of the members of the House of Black were named after stars,” Draco said.
“Why? It’s only fair.” Draco demanded, struggling against the hold on him.
Max tugged on Draco’s robes and pointed to the door to the right of his and asked, “Can I have this room?”
“Nah, if they really want it back, they can report me.” Harry said, slipping a hand into Max’s free one so they were walking in line.
“Isabelle, we’re leaving.” Draco called out. The little girl ran up to him and complained that she wasn’t done talking to the snake.
“I’ve known you for almost nine years, I don’t think I have to ask permission, Draco. You can even call me Harry if you want.” Potter said, following behind Draco.
“Nice to meet you all.” Harry said with a disarming smile. Although, it didn't seem to soften the kids any.
“They weren’t good people, their beliefs extreme and ridiculous, but I have no doubts that they loved me. I believe you can hate what they've done and still mourn the loss of the parents you love.”
“Isabelle how does the water feel?”
One bird caught Draco's attention. It was a small thing with red breast feathers that faded out into a grey-brown color. The bird perched on a branch until a sudden gust of wind prompted it into flight.
Jasmine wanted to spend some time in a bookstore, a two stories tall shop, to buy a few of her own books. Draco used that tome to look for children books for Max and Isabelle. His library was sorely lacking literature of that level. Macy and Thomas were even able to find a book or two for themselves.
“Hey guys you ready to go.” They both nodded
Silence blanketed the room. Even Max and Isabelle were quiet. After a few beats Thomas spoke up.
“I like that one, can I have it?” Isabelle asked, crouched on Draco's other side.
She shrugs and bits into a piece of French toast, “People talk.”
“Oh, you think that’s funny?” Jasmine frowned, launching one of her pillows at Macy, who caught it, using it to smack the blonde girl.
It was like the feeling that had cropped up the morning the Hogwarts’ letters had arrived. Trying to find the reason for their mood Draco casually prompted, “Speaking of tomorrow, are you all excited to go back to Hogwarts?”
What followed was an hour of sabotage. Both men took every chance to mess with the other, all the while defending their own piece.
Spying the scissors in his hand the girl shrunk back, even more frightened. Draco stopped the scissors’ movements at her skittishness and sat down next to her.
“But I was having fun!” Isabelle pouted, but took Draco’s hand and followed him out. “She said she liked it here, and that she was very happy to meet me.”
“I know just the thing to help,” he said, throwing the covers off.
He found Macy in her room with the door open wide. She sat facing the mirror combing her damp hair.
Straightening, Draco said, “Well in any case, we’ll be leaving. Wish I could say it was a pleasure to see you, but it wasn’t, so goodbye!”
The next few hours were spent following their route moving in and out of different clothing stores. Only stopping at other shops if the kids found them interesting.
“The taller boots are best. They can be worn for casual and semi-formal events.”
Upon exiting the building, the issue of travel cropped up. He couldn’t side-along all these kids without leaving some behind. Nor could they apparate on their own.
Draco then, dried and combed Max’s hair while the boy brushed his teeth. Once done, the two found themselves on the bed.
put it on me.” Isabelle said with enough attitude that Draco knew he was not forgiven from their argument.
I know it's been years but I was sitting at home bored and remembered this fic. So, here's the next Chapter.
Then they all split up to get their outfits. Draco had changed into a muggle work out clothing, when Mittsy came to inform him he had a visitor.
Draco knocked on the wooden door across from Macy's that Thomas had chosen as his room. Entering when he heard a grunt.
Setting his now cooled drink aside, Draco stood and strolled into the adjacent room. “That’s it! I can’t take it anymore. We haven’t left the Manor for days. You all barely even go outside. It’s not healthy and I am going stir crazy. We are doing something today, anything! Are there any ideas?” Draco demanded, as he stopped in front of the lot.
“I can see them perfectly from here thank you.” Draco said, grimacing at the thought of getting close to the animals.
Draco strode to Isabelle’s room giving it a knock before entering and found her jumping on the bed. From the state of the bedding, she’d been at it for a while.
Draco created this ointment specifically for the scars that slashed across his torso. Although it hadn't removed the marks, they were hardly noticeable anymore. A person would have to be up close or knew what to look for.
“Draco is Latin for dragon. Those nine stars there make up the Draco constellation. It's theorized that the constellation is Laden, the dragon tasked to protect the garden of Hesperides where the golden apples grew. Hera, Queen of the gods, placed him among the stars for his loyalty after Hercules defeated the dragon for his twelve labors. If you look just above Laden’s head, you’ll see Hercules’ foot.”
“Last time I was in that shop there were paper hearts and lips enchanted to float around the room,” Thomas said to Draco, straight faced. “One of the lips wouldn’t stop following me around, and it kept waxing poetics about my nose.”
“Not just that. You looked terrible after the war,” She said, not one to mince words, “I was worried when you didn’t return to Hogwarts, but I’m glad. You seem like you’re in a good place now.”
Draco placed the girl into the half-filled tub, the water coming up to her lower chest.
Draco smirked he could almost hear potter grinding his teeth.
They walked a few yards from the hut when a voice called out, “Hey, Draco wait up!”
Macy looked a ghost, with her pale face and dark, purple bags under her hazel eyes. Her hair uncombed and tangled as if she tossed and turned the whole night, until she decided to venture here.
Two weeks passed since the three teens left the manor and Draco sat in his potion's lab eagerly reading the first letter they sent.
Thomas lifted them in his arms causing them to let out giddy squeals. "You better give the old man trouble for me, OK.”
(because they were good Slytherins and needed a game where a snake could eat you).
During the show, Jasmine pulled out a small notebook to take notes on the aquatic mammal. But, soon realized that she couldn’t take notes and take pictures at the same time.
Cuts adorned the girl’s hands from their rough meeting with the ground. They were likely caused by a rough meeting with the ground. One of the boys forced her head upward by grasping a handful of her long, dark hair and giving it a jerk. A pair of scissors glinted viciously in his other hand.
“Where do you live?”
After dinner, Draco lead the group through the Manor introducing the different rooms.
“You all will be staying in my wing of the Manor. I suggest you avoid the east and west wings,” Draco says gestured down the aforementioned parts of the Manor. “I haven’t gotten them renovated yet, so they’re still dark and cold. And the portraits refuse to be reasoned with.”
“It shouldn’t even have been around teenagers if it is that easy to provoke.” Draco threw out, face flushed.
His next plan was to nab Ron and Hermione for a day out. Something they hadn’t done for quite a while now since they were busy with their jobs and projects. But Ron outright refused when Harry suggested it.
The women’s giggles were beginning to hit a pitch that only dog could hear, grating on Draco’s nerves.
“Don’t Potter, not here.” Draco scanned the crowd as they began to take notice of the commotion. Harry sensing Draco’s discomfort stepped closer to whisper more effectively.
“During 6th year, Potter would always show up at the worse times.”
Max looked to the figurines fretfully. “I don’t know how to order them. I can sort them by color, but then their sizes are all mixed up, but if I sort them by weight, then the dragon's lengths are all off. I don’t know what to do.”
“Goodbye. Mittsy, Snape you are in charge.”
“So, do you guys know any good songs?” Harry inquired.
Max didn’t have many fresh cuts or bruises, Draco figured the kid kept quiet, so the bullies hadn't noticed him. But, a plethora of scars laid across his limbs and trunk.
Macy tucked hers behind an ear before doing the same for Max. Jasmine carefully placed the flower in her pocket planning on pressing it later in a book. Isabelle preferred to keep her rose in hand twisting and twirling it admiring how “pretty” it is.
“Oh,” Draco exclaimed, looking up at the other man now standing in front of him. A hand rose to lay dramatically on the blonde’s chest.
“I’m not your babysitter, Draco. I was in an important meeting with the Minister of Magic. You might have heard of him before.” Harry hissed, turning to leave but Draco’s fingers on his shoulder stopped him.
For better or worse, this broke the proverbial ice. Although if asked, Draco would say it was for the worse.
When the trio made it back to the Manor, Draco was quick to clean them of every flake of paint before he was forced to hang the paintings.
Their bags, once enlarged, took up the table. A few threatened to fall, hanging precariously on the edge. Only Draco’s quick wand work saved them from falling to the ground.
He used the next few months to renovate the manor. The daunting task helped him power through the fear and despair that threatened to overcome him. Many bad memories were associated with each room. But as the dark artifacts were thrown out, rooms repainted, and furniture replaced, the weight on his chest lightened. Until the manor looked less like a prison and more like a home.
“It's not what they've done, but what they will do in the future. With this group it's only a matter of time," she said, tapping a finger to the side of her nose knowingly.
“Sorry about the mess, Miss. I’ll clean it up.”
“I think Draco’s ready to go hunting for a date.” Then started to mockingly make kissy faces toward Draco.
“Go ahead and find an apron,” Luna said, gesturing to the hooks along the back wall, where kid and adult sized aprons hung.
At a closer look at the girl, it was plain that her eyes weren't as green as Potter’s. But they were no less stunning. He pushed that thought aside, ignoring the word he used to describe his old rival’s eyes. It wasn't the time to resurrect past feelings.
Draco slowed his steps noticing the two youngest struggled to keep up with the longer legs of their companions. Figuring it would be inappropriate to try to carry either of them.
“Mittsy can show you the way out.” With that the house elf appeared and with a, “Exit be this way,” the two were gone.
“How could you run a school like this?” A high nasally voice said as Draco approached the doors, “I want these vermin out this instant. Look at what they did to my girl.”
“Finally,” Thomas groaned, causing Macy to stick her tongue out at him.
Draco reached for the hand picking at Max’s fragile skin and for Isabelle’s hand, gaining both of their attention. He gave those small hands a squeeze and asked gently, “Who’s up for some ice cream?"
This elicited a laugh from the three.
Draco headed over to Max’s room and knocked on the door.
Draco walked down the stairs to the sound of Macy and Thomas fighting over the amount of luggage she had with her.
“Hey Draco, look!” The brunette drew a dark green line across the blonde’s forearm when he looked into the direction Harry pointed.
Draco smiled as he set up his station. Looks like this trip had been good for them judging by the excitement exuding off Max and Isabelle.
“Wait, I’m not done talking to you.”
Merlin, he must have been dead to the world if both Macy and Max were able to climb all over him like that.
The ride down into the park was surprisingly bumpy. Draco leaned against the side of the swaying vehicle, eyes squeezed shut and his breath released heavily from his nose. Merlin, they had magic at their fingertips was it so hard to make the ride smoother. Even the thestral carts weren’t this bad.
“You can’t use the Keep Away charm on everyone who wants to hurt us.” Macy said.
“We could go play at a park and climb trees,” Isabelle supplied, blinking up at Draco a stuffed owl wrapped in her arms.
Thomas laughed good naturedly then engulfed the older man in a hug. Draco could have sworn he heard his ribs groan from the force, but he didn’t complain. Instead, he wrapped his own arms around the boy and gave back as good as he got. Both were smiling when they parted.
“No.” They guiltily answered Luna. Her disruption ended the argument between the two for a limited time.
“You all are in so much trouble,” Jasmine said, shaking her head. Then, proceeded to lift the children out of the maze of leather boxes.
“I don’t really have friends I can stay with,” Jasmine told, straight faced. “Those I mentioned earlier are just classmates. So, I doubt they’d let me stay with them for an extended period.”
Passing the library, a light caught his eye. There, sitting in one of the lounge chairs was Jasmine. In her hand was one of those old, cheesy romance novels that his mother snuck into the Manor behind Lucius’ back.
Oh, yes this is going well.
“That's true, you don’t get a body like that if you exercise regularly,” Macy accused, eyes falling to Harry’s stomach and shook her head sadly.
“Oh Kiki, what happened?” he asked, rubbing her back.
On the trek back to the lift, Isabelle managed to fall asleep on Draco’s chest despite his movements jostling her body.  It wasn’t long after, that Draco noticed Max was lagging. Draco’s arm reaching farther and farther back due to their connected hands.
Harry gazed at the quill a look of horror passed over his face, “Someone gave it to me to use to sign. Do you think I should go back?”
“My parents got me a quidditch set on my 12th birthday. This was the only thing that I could bring with me when Macy and I were on the run. When the Aurors found us and figured out who we were we weren’t allowed to go back to our house for our belongings.” Thomas recalled and sat up, staring at his golden reflection in the shiny surface.
“Thank you Mittsy. You can go back to bed,” he said, lifting Isabelle once more and leaving the empty cup on the table. “Let’s go, Kiki.” Looking back at Macy, who had a look of surprise when Draco gestured at her to follow them, “You too, Macy. Come on.”
“For that, I'm proposing Code Insomniac. If any of us are having a particularly bad night or if you don’t feel like sleeping alone, call a Code Insomniac. Mittsy will gather us, along with all the pillows and blankets in the house so we can sleep down here.”
“I’ll go,” Thomas dropped his case ready to sprint down to the store.
Harry looked back at the four pairs of eyes staring at him, “So, what were you guys up to before I came?”
“Not again!” Macy bemoaned, covering her eyes, “My poor virgin eyes.”
The room was set into the side of a mountain showing off a perfect view of the Sanctuary below. Large domes could be seen caused by spells that preserve the biomes within. Keeping the climate as close to the creature’s natural environment would be. From where they stood, the people below were nothing but tiny specs moving throughout the zoo.
Draco rushed to the kitchen and prepped the kettle for tea. The small tremors of his hands made the task difficult; he clenched them to try to steady himself.
He playfully stuck out his tongue at the three teens when stepping away from Isabelle and Max.
Thomas successfully diverted the goat's attention to the silk feast before it by using Draco as a human shield. With the blonde distracted by the appearance of a second head, ‘Jasper' snatched a mouth full of sleeve.
Merlin, he was bored. He averted his eyes, so that the living room was now within his line of sight just past the large, open wooden doors.
Back when blood purity was important, everyone thought that magic was hereditary. But then, muggle descendants showed signs of magic, so the hereditary link was debunked.
The rumpled note still in his fist held Thomas’ rushed handwritings stating that Macy was in the hospital wing and needed help. And if Thomas was asking Draco for help it must be urgent.
“And I found the perfect one for you.” Harry announced, a cheeky grin on his face as he rummaged in the hanging aprons.
“So, he stalked you.” Jasmine chimed in giving Macy a knowing look and getting a similar look back.
“We don't exactly have any friends out of our house. And we're pretty much blacklisted in Slytherin.” A bitter laugh followed this.
The girl’s eyes were frantic as they searched for any form of help, until they met with his grey ones.
She ran through the room in only her underwear; yelling and laughing as Mittsy chased behind her, a pair of pants and a shirt in hand. Draco managed to grab the girls when she tried crawling between his legs to escape outside. All thoughts of the raven gone, as he joined Mittsy in wrangling a squirming five-year-old into their clothes.
“Can you talk to other animals too?” Max wondered.
But on this day, the nasty taste of the Polyjuice potion seemed remarkably more unappealing. So, he left the Manor with only a large hood to obscure his features.
“Shut up Thomas!” Macy’s head whipped around to give her brother a furious glare, a hand lifted brandishing a bottle of nail polish in return. But Jasmine’s voice stopped her from going through with the threat.
More crying was the only response. Draco tilted his head until the sky was all he could see. He’d never been around children before, let alone a crying one.
“Isabelle, swallow your food first before you speak, please.” An enthusiastic “Sorry!” was the response before more food was shoved in her mouth and another story told.
Draco shook his head at the pleased look that crossed her face as she popped away. That elf was a menace, but it seems much of his family is these days. His foot froze half in his leather boot – Family. It wasn’t a word that he thought would be in his vocabulary again.
Jasmine accepted hers from the elf, then set it aside disinterested. One would think that the letters had kicked a baby animal with the way Macy looked when the letter was handed to her.
“We’re walking the whole way to the Ministry!” Jasmine exclaimed in disbelief. “Surely, we can’t be traveling to London on foot?”
Draco shrugged. The Malfoy fortune was vast. He could buy everything in the mall, including the mall itself, and still have enough to buy out ten others. The many properties and stocks he owned around the world continued to thrive, despite the war.
“That look doesn’t do much to change my mind about you two.” Harry laughed at Thomas’ grossed out face and walked over to Teddy, shaking his head at the other’s actions.
“Well you seemed busy.” Draco said.
Now, Draco was struggling to pull Isabelle away from the penguin exhibit. They were making their way to the rainforest habitat where the others were already waiting.
“You look good Draco.” Luna said.
“I know that, you prat.” Draco said sharply, his voice becoming gentler when Max shifted at his tone, “I just don’t want them to wake up.”
“So, what happened here?” Harry asked, curious.
The cart came to a stop at the bottom of the mountain and a disembodied voice warned of the slight step to the ground. Draco gratefully set foot back on solid land.
“There you go,” Draco said.
“Oh really. Go on show me what to do and I’ll be running laps around you all in no time.”
The teenagers seemed to have less injuries compared to Max and Isabelle. He assumed it was because the older children fought back while the youngest only defense was to hide from their tormentors.
“You can’t be serious! What about them?” Harry gestured to the group, “we can leave them here with Malfoy.”
At the mention of Aurors, a thud was made somewhere in the pile of trunks.
Macy and Jasmine walked directly to the kneazles that lounged in the sun. The animals were so used to people's presence that they didn’t react as the two girls approached. Draco leaned against the fence as he watched them with the animals, Thomas by his side.
The walk revealed that the first bunch of roses were in bloom, the rest soon to follow.
Each seat had a small easel and canvas prepared. There were bottles of paint scattered on the tables and cups of brushes were provided.
“It feels nice.” She says moving her arm back and forth, so her hand trailed through her fingers.
“Enough, Mr. Nitwiker! Now you all be good for Mr. Humphrey. If not, he might send you to stay with your parents in Azkaban.” With that she turned on her heel and left the group.
“They’ll come, or they won’t there is no sense in worrying about something that might never happen.”
“Good lord,” Draco gasped and marched over to them, “Isabelle you’d better get out of that puddle immediately.”
“So, they hate you because they’re jealous?” Thomas asked in disbelief.
“What did I hear about vermin?” Draco said darkly. Letting the doors close as he stalked to the group.
“We passed a candy store on the way, maybe they slipped into it without us noticing.’ Jasmine worried, eyes wide.
Draco nodded his head sagely. “Yes, my father had money, so they all waited on me.”
He looked past her to Madam Pomphrey, “Why aren’t these healed yet?”
Glaring at the Aurors Draco replied, “Did your reports tell you that the oldest of these “Dark wizards” is barely fifteen years old.”
Draco jerked around and indeed the two were no longer beside him.
He opened his eyes to slivers, feeling crusty and heavy at this late time. Staring back at him was Isabelle, peeking over the side of the bed. She had wet streaks on her cheeks, eyes puffy and red from her fists rubbing at them. Her hair was messy and knotted.
“Let’s go in there!” She was pointing at a building that had all kinds of fish magicked to swim around the front. Every now and then, a shark would appear and try to swallow the door leading within.
Draco watched the scene unfold, amazed at how fast the five accepted his idea. A pillow smacking him in the face interrupted his thoughts. The unexpectedness of the attack caused him to stumble back a few steps.  Looking up, he saw Thomas with a satisfied smirk on his face and a hand fisted on his hip.
“No, that’s not the same shirt.” The girl glanced down, her countenance becoming cheerful when she spotted the bright color. Giving Draco a cheeky grin, she continued down the stairs with a skip in her step.
They were once more on the train heading back to Malfoy Manor. Unlike the relaxed atmosphere they'd experienced on the way to London, the air was tense between the six passengers. Every pair of eyes skimmed over the group of people, untrusting.
He brought the snitch close to his lips and whispered, “Thomas Franklin Nitwiker.” At the uttered words, delicate wings unfurled, and the ball darted into the air.
Glancing between the two, Draco said, “I saw that. What was with that look?”
“Technically, it was Macy who brought it up.” Jasmine says between laughing. Draco’s head met the table, he could feel his life span shorten as he continued to argue with these people.
“Right away, Master Malfoy!” Mittsy responded, then disappeared with a snap of her fingers.
Draco signed the document before moving on to the second folder in the pile.
“I didn’t mean to. But he’s scary.” Max explained to Draco, a fistful of the blonde’s shirt in his hands.
Thomas rushed outside with his new art supplies to sketch one of the albino peacocks, calling back that he'd take the rest to his room later.
“Draco?” she croaked, lower lip trembling. He sat up and pulled her toward him as soon as he saw this.
A smoky blue trail appeared a few meters away from Draco. It swirled as if being disturbed by the wind and never rose above his knee.
Obnoxiously happy music accosted the group as they walked away from the transit line. The music would be overpowered, every now and then, by the screams of excited children. Draco took a second to recover to ensure that his lunch wasn’t going to reappear. Isabelle tugged at his shirt signaling the end of his break.
Of course, the whispers behind them shattered that good mood. Irritated, the blonde turned toward the nosy people. Couldn’t he leave the Manor once without any nasty comments.
“Jasmine, Thomas, and Macy left for Hogwarts the other day and well...” Draco let the sentence drift off, gesturing toward Max and Isabelle.
A hooded figure dressed in black robes was the single blemish on the street that day. The form’s dark aura conflicted with the world around it. The others on the street were too absorbed in their surroundings to pay the figure any mind. The hood hid the scowling face of a young man. His long hair blonde, almost white, and facial structure aristocratic.
But seeing the absolute devastation on both faces as the train carried Macy, Jasmine, and Thomas away, Draco wanted to cheer them up fast. To be honest, he also needed a little pick me up.
Draco knocked against an oak door when they'd reached the second floor of his personal wing.
“Draco my bed is so big!”
“Look, Draco, they’re so pretty!”
Draco followed the trail into the woods, his wand held tightly in his fist. The rising sun caused shadows to stretch and twist into nightmarish forms that set the man on edge. The intruder could be anything from a wizard, werewolf, or just a lost crup. Either way it could be dangerous, so Draco kept a close watch on his surroundings.
Draco touched the handle of the gate which opened to reveal a pathway leading up to his house.
To get her mind off talking snakes, he mentioned the petting zoo that was close by.
Max and Isabelle loved the toy store. Isabelle ran around pulling stuffed animals off the shelves while Max examined the dragon figurines. He chose five of his favorites and carried them around in his arms until it was time to purchase them.
“You know it’s common for those of both sexes to preen while looking for a partner. There’s no reason to be embarrassed.”  Jasmine interjects, Draco stares at her, eyes wide.
“Let’s go!” said the shortest of the three. And with one final sneer at the girl, they dashed out the alley, laughing and joking all whole way.
Once they were all signed, Draco thrust his canvas at Potter. “Might as well sign mine as well.”
Draco nodded along, cursing Potter for putting such thoughts into the girl’s head. Now, she may go find a snake to ‘talk’ to just to get injured. Not only that, few people would be kind if she pretended to be a parselmouth.
The journey was quite peaceful. And as they walked Draco felt his sadness from the past few days start to disperse.
“I was named after a constellation, and it is my favorite story of them all,” he said, ignoring Thomas’ snort of “it would be.”
“Where are your parents?”
The next day, Draco paced in the manor’s living room. There was no reason to wasting energy scuffing up the hardwood floor that morning. Mittsy would have his head for the marks he’d left on the polished floors.
“Are you sure it wasn’t because you were jealous of me getting to ride it?” Draco felt anger rise in him, Potter didn’t know when to stop poking the snake. Isabelle interrupted him before he had time to start in on the other man, which would have included an impressive array of curses.
Isabelle climbed on the stool in front of the sink and started to brush her teeth. As she was doing this, Draco used the towel to dry her hair, then proceeded to comb out the tangles.
Soon, the sound of stomping reached their ears, continuing until a soaked Thomas emerged from the doorway. “I’m awake,” he grumbled, unamused.
The man stood at the clear dismissal and waited for some type of gratitude. Receiving none, he turned on his heel, muttering about the rude behavior of teenagers.
“Get it, because you're kinda of like a prince in wizarding society.”
Blinking at the exchange with Luna, Draco turned, and it wasn't hard to spot his group. Potter stood at the center of a crowd. He looked out of place shifting from foot to foot, a hand scratching the back of his neck as he accepted a canvas from a short man. Max and Isabelle were peeking out from behind the brunette's legs.
Max tried to imitate Draco by attempting to eat his orange chicken with chopsticks but found the task too difficult and switched to a fork. Draco assured the boy that it took a while to master the utensils and that the more he practiced, the better he’d become. This managed to lift the boy’s spirit, and he continued with his meal happily.
“You better treasure this forever.” Potter joked as he signed.
A bright light coming from Draco’s left distracted him from locating Jasmine. The room was completely dark room except for a cylindrical tank full of glowing jellyfish, floating lazily around.
Max rubbed his eyes when Draco asked if he was tired. Stubbornly, Max denied it through a yawn.
He cursed his rash decision. Far too Gryffindor-like; there was no chance that his scheme would succeed. And if his fake credentials won’t give him up, it would be because he had hexed this woman out of annoyance.
“Okay, I have the tickets for the train. Follow me.”
Stares and whispers followed them as they approached the train's entrance. Draco couldn’t hear what was being said but he couldn’t imagine it was anything good.
“Malfoy, I swear…”
“There you are, Kiki. All done!” Draco said, patting her on the shoulder and stood. She looked at him with solemn green eyes, her hair now just short of her shoulders.
Twirling in her seat, Macy graced Draco with a smile, “They are literally the only band with decent music. Which is why I’m going to start my own band, to bring some actual good music to this dreadfully boring world.”
His eyes opened and blinked to banish the fuzzy film that seemed to cover his eyes. From his position he could see Thomas curled up a blanket wrapped tight around himself. And Macy clinging to Jasmine, somehow climbing over Draco last night.
Draco made sure Max’s and Isabelle’s apron were tied correctly. Max chose one with different colored butterflies painted on and Isabelle’s had a monkey swinging from a branch.
Draco told them it wasn’t necessary for them to join. He appreciated the gesture, but they didn’t have to if they didn’t want to.
“Good luck trying to find a tutor this late in the year.”
“So, do you!” Max accused.
“Wow, I want to try talking to the snakes!” Isabelle said, running off to a glass panel to ‘talk’ to the snake within.
look which went, predictably, ignored.
Max clapped his hands and stared in awe, like Draco had cured the young girl of a horrid ailment. Macy let out an explosive laugh, head bent back. Jasmine tried to contain her own giggles with a fist placed at her mouth. Draco even managed to spot a quick smile cross Thomas’ face.
“We’ll use these to build a makeshift mattress to sleep on?” Jasmine asked. At Draco’s nod, she walked over to the pile and pulled out a single pillow. Throwing it to the side, she said, “I call being on one edge. I need room, so I can sleep.”
This launched the story of Hercules’ brave deeds that King Eurystheus tasked him as punishment for murdering his own wife and kids.
Max stood to the side arms crossed at his chest, a puddle forming at his feet. Draco quickly pulled the towel from where it hung and wrapped it around the shivering boy, ensuring everything was dry.
When she had the object in her hand, she had Max sign hers then she did the same with his.
“Mr. Potter’s busy right now. Let’s go, you both are in need of a bath”
“Merlin, Macy! You scared the hell out of me. What are you doing down here in the dark?”
The previous injuries had healed nicely over the summer thanks to Draco’s ointment and everyone keeping an eye out for Max’s anxiety. To try to curb the harming habit before the redhead started it. Now, all that there were ragged white scars on his arm.
“Well, since no one is actually asleep, how about I tell a story?” Draco announced to the darkness.
“You know what I find funny,” Thomas spoke up. The teen stared defiantly into the eyes of the man who defeated the darkest wizard of their time. “That you came here accusing someone of a crime with no proof. He took us in and fed and clothed us.” He finished in whispered disbelief, with a gasp and a hand over his mouth.
Max and Isabelle promised once they were back on the ground.
Draco had to yell the last part to the group as they scattered around to observe the different tanks. Draco followed them, making sure to locate each one of his charges as he went.
But he still tried to go back to sleep. Draco was drifting between awake and asleep when he heard the door creak open. The light from the hall fell across his eyelids.
By the way Tally was treating this case, he doubted she’d look closely at the signature.
“This is the only thing I have left of my life before the war. It only activates with a specific phrase."
“Uh, I’m not really one for group hugs.” Draco voiced stiffly.
The laughter of children interrupted the young man’s reminiscing. This by itself was not unusual, but Draco recognized the certain tone in the sound. He had heard often enough with Death Eaters living in his house; cruelty.
“I won't stop you if you want to leave. But I implore you to stay the night, in the morning I can help find alternative living. Isabelle told me that life at the orphanage was terrible. If you need an explanation for my actions, it’s simply because I can relate. I know what it’s like to be afraid of turning the corner in the place you live.”
“You two should just kiss already.” Jasmine remarked, chin in one hand using the stroller for support. Despite her earlier words, Macy threw them a thumbs up and even winked at Harry. Both men just ignored them as they continued the trip to the lift.
“No.”
The streaks of morning light that made their way through the window fell on the young man. They caressed his face and body, casting shadows on the floor beside him. Accentuating the strong features of his face and causing his pale hair to glow.
“Yes, yoga, the discipline that includes breath control, simple meditation, and body postures that is used for health and relaxation.” Jasmine stated, she had no doubly looked that up in the time they were getting ready.
“Malfoy let me. I’ve gotten pretty good with the Scourgify charm. I had to cast it plenty of times with Teddy when he goes outside to play.” The sight of Potter approaching them a wand drawn had Draco shaking from memories. The blonde shrunk in on himself clutching Isabelle against his chest, using his body to protect her.
He still remembered the reaction everyone had when it came out that Potter was one, and he was their Golden Boy.
“B-but,” she stuttered, looking up sadly at Draco. Looking around for something that could stop the impending tears, he saw a pair of trainers.
Hey, guys thank you for all the kind words. I was hesitant to post this story because I wasn't sure if anyone else would enjoy it but I'm so glad I did. Your comments are what push me to keep at it with this fic! So, I hope you enjoy the rest of my work, let me know what you think.
“Let me ask you this Mr. Malfoy. Was Hogwarts your sole experience with education?”
All three say they are doing well. They've seen some discrimination, but nothing all that surprising according to Thomas. Macy made a new friend, Summer, a pure-blood Hufflepuff that doesn't have many friends in the house because of her blood status.  An upcoming project in Care of Magical Creatures has Jasmine ecstatic. While, Thomas is counting the days until Quidditch tryouts begin to become a chaser.
They stood there watching as the train became a tiny speck in the distance. Glancing at the children, Isabelle was silently crying, eyes still on the spot the train disappeared a hand still waving. Max gaze transfixed on the same place, his bottom lip trapped between his upper and lower teeth. He was once again scratching at his arm.
Tally must have chosen the most uncomfortable seat in the whole place for her office. Draco had to force himself from shifting on the hard surface as she droned on with her grievances with the Ministry.
In the same store, Jasmine found two one-thousand-piece puzzles that she could work on. One was a picture of a bunch of cats and the other was of a castle surrounded by a green meadow with flowers blooming in it.
“Yes, I’m sure someone misses you.”
“It was at that time that it really hit me about the kind of destruction I was capable of. And I am so sorry that you had to be at the receiving end of it.” Harry finished, retaining eye contact with the other.
Thomas strode to his sister’s side, standing protectively beside her. He grasped her upper arm, offering the little comfort he could to the upset girl.
“You still have house elves? How pathetic.” Potter mutters, which Draco ignored. He knew the other man was just trying to rile him up hoping for an excuse to bring him into the DMLE.
“Oh, so I’m Malfoy again? And watch your language, there are kids around.” Draco could help himself from pestering Harry, as he left the room in search for those kids. Knowing that Harry would follow him and not simply apparate out of the Manor.
He regretted the words that left his mouth when he saw the horror other man’s face. The words had honestly been a knee jerk reaction. But, the thought of Potter casting a spell on him caused his breath to catch and his heart to quicken.
“Not tired.” Jasmine said quickly and with finality while trying to remove her makeup with a wet cloth. The others were quick to back her statement up.
An hour into the trip, Draco and Jasmine were the only ones still awake. Draco was awake because he was a responsible adult, and Jasmine was still immersed in her book.
Their route planned, Jasmine said, “If we follow this path, we can visit the most stores in the shortest amount of time.”
“Is Isabelle still with Mittsy?” Draco asked, as Max led them to the tea room.
Draco stretched his as his appearance returned to normal. Turning to address five surprised faces.
They weren't children in the public's eyes. All anyone saw was their parents’ choices. Their kids were something for people to sneer at and blame for their misfortunes. Many Death Eaters sentenced to Azkaban, as demanded by the wizarding world. Still, this did little to satisfy their anger.
If that's true many questions arise. Like, what about skills like Parseltongue that are pasted down, obviously there's a magical link. And how about squibs, why don’t they have magic-” The rest of them stood there stunned as Jasmine continued to rant. Her words accelerating the more excited she became.
“Yes, Kiki. When we were younger, Potter and I fought quite a lot. And one time we both took it a little too far and I was injured, but the important thing is that he apologized right?”
"Remind me again why we couldn't apparate to this place?" Draco asked.
“I had no idea that it was that bad for the Slytherins. There have been people bad-mouthing your house, but I thought it was all harmless talk. I’m so sorry, Macy.” Jasmine said, sadness and regret coloring her tone.
Isabelle wanted hers at the head of her bed, while Max had his hung above the desk and dragons (now ordered by tail length). Draco used a strong sticking charm as he placed them in fear that the painting would fall on one of their heads. Before laying down for bed himself, Draco placed his own painting in the center of the wall facing his bed.
“Are you kidding me?’ Draco asked, the painting once more in his possession, “Do you know how much I could sell this for now?”
What was Draco supposed to say to that, it’s okay, because no it wasn’t. I forgive you, because Draco had forgiven Potter the moment, he saved him from the fire, but Draco wasn’t sure if he was ready to say it out loud. And maybe that meant he hadn’t forgiven the other man at all.
About twenty minutes into the ride, Isabelle became bored with the scenery out the window; setting her sight on Draco and Max.
He stepped forward for a better view, “Wow, look at that detail.”
The picture was slightly off center, and Jasmine was closer to the lens then the rest of them, but they all were happy.
Other than healing scar tissue, there was the added benefits of pain relief and increased healing of small wounds. He actually had a booming side business selling the vials to pharmacies.
Her leg kicked out, sending a stone skittering across the ground. She reluctantly led Draco out of the alley, her shoulders slumped weighted down with disappointment. A long stretch of silence fell as they walked hand-in-hand along the pavement.
They’d searched the shelves for a while, until Draco spotted Max trying to reach a pair of converses on the top shelf. The left shoe had a rainbow design with a white lace, while its counterpart was white with a rainbow lace and sole.
“Perfect, go ahead and take those parchments with you. They’re to prove that you now have guardianship. If you ever want to be rid of them, all that needs to be done is for the new guardian to sign the legal forms. Although, good luck trying to find someone; I’ve been trying for almost two years now,” she finished with a laugh.
But it was Jasmine who snapped him out of his paranoid state, the day before.
“I was on the phone!” Harry protested.
“Is that so.” Thomas said, and evil glint in his eyes. The boy wrapped one arm around Jasmine and dragged her into the group hug. She complained but went with little resistance. Thomas' tall frame dwarfed the rest, staying like that until Draco relaxed into the hold.
“Snape?”
“Macy!” Draco practically shrieks, then in a more hushed tone, “How’d you even know that, your thirteen!”
“What?” Harry yelled. Apologizing profusely at Max’s violent flinch back at the exclamation.
Max waved back shyly, while Isabelle had both hands over her head waving and jumping up and down. Draco gave his own wave.
The image placed in the coveted space warmed Draco's chest when he looked at it. A feeling the ruined portrait had never elicited.
What a headline that would make: ‘The youngest Malfoy finally detained, not from war crimes but because some woman wouldn’t stop talking.’
Draco’s nose wrinkled at the suggestion, he's track record with animals isn't the greatest, but seeing everyone's interest he had to relent. Sighing, the blonde gave the group a nod. They all dashed out the room to prepare for their journey.
Draco yanked out a handkerchief from his robe pocket and brandished it dramatically, causing Isabelle to laugh.  He then took her hands into his before gently wiping them clean.
Jasmine’s attention left the tank and focused on Draco. “It was in the library, so I grabbed it on the way out.”
Draco pursed his lips as much as he was loathed to do anything Potter wanted, he was desperate. If it would help get Max and Isabelle out of the house, then he would do anything.
“Yep, Draco and I were in the same Care of Magical Creatures class and the professor, Hagrid, brought one in for us to see. I even got to ride it.” Potter proudly said.
“Jasmine, I don’t think anyone can call you stupid. But I know what you mean. Slytherin’s aren’t exactly popular people in Hogwarts right now and the mood within the house isn’t much better. Merlin, it’s so stifling to be in the common room.” Thomas punctuated his words by throwing himself back, so he was lying flat on the floor arms outstretched. He stared up at the dimly lit ceiling as if it held all the answers to the questions of the universe.
“I want to hang some of these with my painting, but I don’t know which ones to use.” Max explained the situation to Draco.
“Lovegood,” Draco guilty murmured. He needed to apologize for her treatment as a prisoner in the Manor but nothing else came out.
Draco's path was suddenly blocked by Max, Jasmine’s camera raised and pointed at the older man. He had just enough time to smile before Max pressed down the button.
"Make sure you wear something comfortable. We'll have quite a walk to get to Luna's place." Harry called after them.
Draco’s eyes roamed the remaining photos before gathering them for future use once he received Max's approval.  The two children headed up the stairs their chosen photos in hand.
“I am her legal guardian I can do whatever I want. Now, what happened to my ward?” She opened her mouth to answer and Draco leaned into her space. “What don’t you understand here? I’m. Not. Talking. To. You.”
“You did not just
Before Draco could reach the group, a single movement of the scissors freed the hair grasped in the boy’s fist. The rest fell limp against the girl’s face, causing sobs to escape from the child with more force.
Draco stayed around to make sure that the spell was cast. Before saying his goodbyes to the three. Giving each a hug. “Please stay out of trouble all of you. I’m not sure how many times the ‘I will sue you’ play will work on McGonagall.”
“I can’t wait,” Thomas spats at the woman.
McClain was the first of the three to speak up. “Mr. Malfoy, the DMLE have received some concerning reports that you're harboring a group of dark wizards.”
The next document held a photo of a young boy. He had thick, red hair and freckles painted across the bridge of a button nose and cheeks.
When Mittsy had told him that Senior Auror Terrence McClain and Junior Auror Harry Potter were walking up his pathway, he thought she'd taken a few of his hallucinogenic potions. But here they are.
He couldn't hold back the barking laugh that burst from his chest when he saw what the other man was wearing.
“Snape, it’s been a while.” The young man greeted, setting aside the parchment. Draco had one of the two portraits of his godfather, the other hung proudly in the headmistress’ office. Severus Snape spent most of his time there at Hogwarts, but every now and then he appeared to berate his godson.
“What are you doing here?” Draco exclaimed.
“Is everything okay?” Harry’s concern quickly dowsing his anger.
They were staring, it was making his skin crawl. Draco ran a hand through his new cut feeling the soft, recently shaved hair. The sides and back were cut short, while the top was kept long an loose, letting it swoop back.
Watching the two, Draco was positive taking them out for ice cream was a mistake. He could now recognize that going home, changing into pajamas, ice cream on the couch, and a story would have been the best way to go.
Harry leaned in close to Draco, the sharp scent of his after shave invading the blonde's space. Their arms brushing, Draco didn't know if he wanted the other man to lean closer or to step far, far away.
The pressure on his head increased as the culprit realized Draco was awake. Looking up, Draco met the eyes of Isabelle who sat crossed legged in front of him, her hands still gripping blonde strands.
Thomas also acquired a sketchpad, drawing pencils, charcoal, and two felt-tip pens, which an employee claimed all beginner artists needed. As the group left the arts and crafts store, Draco realized this was the most excited he'd ever seen the boy.
Thank you everyone for all the support. Unfortunately, spring break is coming to an end so I won't be able to post as quickly but I am planning on regular updates. Anyway, here's the second chapter. Pleas let me know what you think.
It was only when they reached the end of the exhibit, that she finished. Everyone had kept up with the group except for Isabelle, she stood in front of one of the glass panes a few yards back.
At the door, Draco glanced back at the woods that now seemed less sinister at this distance. He entered the manor, while shaking his head to clear it, only to find a stripped-down Isabelle.
With that, Draco’s irritation found a new target.
“Is he going to join us?” Max asked, scared by the angry aura the other man was exuding.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy you get back here!” But the man was ignored.
“These Aurors are here to talk to you all. This is Auror Potter and Auror McClain. They are Thomas, Jasmine, Macy, Maximus, and Isabelle.” He said indicating each person.
“Potter!” Draco yelped. Luna’s eyes fell to them once more and Draco swallowed his complaint. Plastering a disarming grin on his face until their instructor looked away.
This wasn’t what Harry expected when he decided to come bother Draco that day. Maybe some eye rolling and sarcasm, definitely yelling, but not this.
All in all, there couldn't have been a more perfect morning. Then, why had he been pacing for the past few hours.
“I refuse. You can’t put that spell on my daughter.”
“Luna, please.” She said, giving his arm a squeeze. Her smile said it all; he was forgiven.
Draco needed to find a good Mind Healer, one that could help these kids deal with their unique situations. A Healer that could look pass their parentage. The sound of the office door opening brought him out of his thoughts.
They hung up their aprons as the paintings dried.
incantation
“Shut up,” Draco muttered into a pillow, but his whimsical tone betrayed the smile that was beginning to form.
“Hey, Draco. Check me out!” Steeling himself for what was sure to be something completely absurd, Draco turned.
Isabelle’s expression fell, and she looked away. “Do I have to go back?” She asked.
With the silence that followed that statement, he assumed he had hit the nail on the head.
“You cut your hair.” Jasmine remarks looking surprised.
Draco dashed into the garden where everyone was already gathered in their most comfortable attire.
Staring back at him was an average looking man with brown hair and eyes. His square face a tad broader than Draco’s own. He was of average height and was slightly on the chubby side. This was the perfect disguise for Draco's plan, one could see him a thousand times but never remember him.
“Draco, he hurt you?” Isabelle asked, breaking the strange atmosphere between Draco and Harry. Her arms tightening around Draco’s neck attempting to give him some comfort.
In the wake of this team up, the others admitted defeat, and construction continued until everyone was satisfied with their creation.
“Master, Autor Potter is being here.” Mittsy said, clearing her throat before shuffling away.
His final image of the girl was of her beside the fence, watching him leave. Her short, dark hair swayed with the wind. Green eyes glistened from unshed tears, and her threadbare shirt hanging off a narrow shoulder. The sight emphasized how tiny she was.
Drawing out his wand, Draco cast a quick timing charm that would notify him when an hour has passed. Polyjuice was particularly fickle potion. Any minuscule change in variables would affect the length of time that the magic would work.
“Do you know any good tutors, Professor?” Draco asked, attention returning to the portrait.
But against his believe, the man voiced his agreement. This was a lesson he learned early in life; if one was to be remembered fondly it wouldn't do to disagree with others. Lucius made sure Draco knew this, so he could climb the metaphorical political ladder.
“I can do that; I was blessed with perfect pitch.” She said, her voice soft with understanding. He gave her a grateful nod.
Dropping the container in his hand, he rushed to the bedside and snatched Isabelle midair causing her to let out a shriek of laughter.
Draco’s eyes followed the signature as it curled and disappeared within the woods.
"Why don't you make me?" Thomas had replied, deliberately stretching them farther onto the table.
“Where’d you find that top?” Draco asked confused.
and a board game called
The sound of Potter knocking on the wooden door echoed around them. By the time footsteps was heard from within, Draco had already formed a plan of escape.
Hearing her name Macy turned from the mirror to the group. On her feet, she wore two different types of boots.
“Madam Puddifoot’s isn’t lame.” She frowned at her brother.
“Draco what’s happening?” Thomas asked when he caught sight of the man entering.
They had a hard time waking up Isabelle and Max for them to walk through the Floo, but by some miracle it was done. Thomas, Jasmine, and Macy soon followed.
Draco then led the group up the stairs to the second floor and into the final room on the tour, the library. Most of the minors showed little interest for the room.
“Young Master Max there you be.” Mittsy exclaimed when she spotted the redhead.
“We’ll be back soon, and you both will have some much fun with Draco you won’t even notice we’re gone.”  Macy assured, hugging the two close. She released them wiping the wetness that had gathered in her eyes.
“I don’t mind,” he claimed. The three walked toward the exit where Thomas, Jasmine, and Macy gathered.
“Yes, I do.” Harry said looking sad, “We may have had a rocky past, but I’ve never hated you enough to want you dead or hurt. And nothing excuses my actions.”
But McClain called through the door, “Mr. Malfoy, please. As part of the release deal, your place of residence is susceptible to random inspections for dark magic.”
Lethargically, the two rose and headed to their rooms to get dressed. Sighing, Draco followed them up.
“It’s not exactly good for a family’s social standing to associate with us, if you know what I mean. Most Slytherin families who wouldn't join He-Who-Should-Not-Be-Named are still carefully watched. There's no way they'd worsen it by taking in Death Eater kids.” Thomas finished.
He could still feel her eyes following his trek down the street. The splashes of orange and red painted across the sky alerted him to the late hour. Cursing, he quickened his pace.
Draco gave them a short nod, a hand on Max’s head and the other still in Isabelle’s grasp.
He spent most of his time in the Manor wandering from one room to another in a daze. Trying to recognize his childhood home from the ruins that were left.
Thomas showed interest in the outdoor broom closet, as the tour continued. Draco had great fun watching Thomas' face as he detailed the brooms located within. He only had the latest and fastest brooms one could find on the market.
Draco stood, "Come along you two you heard Mr. Potter we've got somewhere to be."
Looking around, Draco saw Max asleep, curled into his side, and Isabelle’s limbs spread all over the place. Macy laid on her back, mouth open softly snoring, Jasmine had one hand under her head and the other grasping the blanket to her chin. Thomas was semi-awake. He had one eye slightly opened, gaze on Draco. The other closed, squished against the pillow.
“Why, Malfoy I do believe that was a compliment.” Harry smiled as he settled a softly complaining Isabelle by rubbing her back.
The fireplace was inlaid with grey marble. A soft, brown wood engraved with the Malfoy Crest framed the marble. The grey couch, handpicked by Draco himself, was plush and made with a smooth cloth. It was as comfortable as any bed, which could be the reason Draco found himself dozing midday, a book on his chest. A small table placed in front of the couch had a shaggy, Slytherin green rug beneath it, protecting Draco's feet from the cold floor.
“Slow down you two! You’re going to knock someone down.” Draco called after them.
What surprised him was that the blonde never lorded the children's mistakes over them. He would gently manipulate their limbs until they were in the correct position, before returning to his place. At that moment Harry would describe Draco as soft, an adjective he’d never associated with the man before. He was fascinated by this New Malfoy and couldn’t keep his eyes off the man.
He was already on thin ice with his senior officer when he’d spilt a cup of coffee on a stack of paperwork. His whole team had to stay late to redo all that work.
But the scathing words died on his lips when he didn’t see sneers directed at him. Rather the two women stared with awe and admiration, just not at him. He should have known that Potter’s presence would be enough to overlook his own reputation.
Now the thing about Harry is that he had come to terms with the fact that he likes the company of both men and women. And since his relationship with Ginny never went anywhere, he’s been able to explore his options. So, he is comfortable admitting when he finds someone attractive.
“Draco, I’m like the pigs!” She then proceeded to oink in proof.
“Nothing. Your painting just looks a little dull. Why don’t we add some color? Draco threatened, brandishing his brush and moving to Harry’s area.
He squirted a generous amount of body wash onto a square cloth and handed it to Isabelle, instructing her to clean her body while he rinsed her hair. Draco ran his fingers through the wet strands inspecting the girls scalp for any insects. Not finding any, he lathered her hair with shampoo and conditioner.
“It was all dusty. I didn't think anyone was using it.” She clarified, blinking up at Draco.
He was out on the street ready to once more try his hand at the locked door of his office when he saw a flash of blonde in the corner of his eye.
It was a sunny, spring day. Chirping birds rested in tree branches rich with green leaves. Flowers of all colors were beginning to bloom. Children ran and jumped through puddles left by the morning rain. Their laughter drowned out their parents’ shouts to be careful.
“Luna,” he amended, “we really did make a mess and used up a lot of paint. Let me clean and pay for it.”
Draco checked twice to confirm that Max and Isabelle were still by his side as smoke poured out of the train's shoot. A window dropped open a few meters away from the trio and Macy’s head popped out.
As Harry sat there, an itchy feeling crawled along his skin. A sensation that he’d been getting since the end of the war. Like a bunch of fire ants where walking on him; it was a level of restlessness he never though he'd experience.
If it wasn’t for Harry exclamation Draco wouldn’t have recognized the woman in front of them. The tips of her blonde hair were dyed a light blue and bundled up in a messy bun worn high on her head. She was wearing a set of muggle clothes with paint splattered randomly across them.
Once he was sure that the older children weren't going to fall back asleep, he rushed to dress Max and Isabelle. Unsurprisingly, Max was already dressed in black trousers, a gray shirt, and a black robe with blue lining. It was Isabelle that presented a challenge that morning.
Reaching over to get a hold on Max’s waist, Draco turned so he was now on his back with Max trapped by one arm. Shutting his eyes, he blindly reached for Isabelle as well to get her to lay down.
Draco picked up two of the polaroid’s for closer study. From the looks of it, Max has quite the eye for photography.
Draco had the salve ready and treated the abused skin with the mint smelling medicine. Leaving Max's forearm for last, the potioneer grasped the thin wrist and gently pulled it forward, palm up.
Ignoring Draco’s remarks about
As the muggle population grew and their towns expanded, the Ministry demanded the wards changed. Tired from the reports of panicked muggles running from the Malfoy's woods.
Adjusting Max so he fit more comfortable in his arms, Draco returned the smile.
With a bright red face and loud giggles in the background Harry gets into the correct position. God, Malfoy may be one of the most attractive men he’d ever seen and could have walked straight out of one of his wet dreams, but he was still a git.
“Thank you, Harry.” Draco said, clearing his throat. “If you need any help just ask Mittsy or Professor Snape.”
Max is around the age of his awakening, Draco would need to look out for the signs. He will also need to look for some good training material for the two.
“Thomas if you're not going to help, shut your mouth!” Jasmine panted, digging in her heels for greater leverage.
“How are you no worried? They could be taken, scared, or worse, dead.”
Draco opened the first file. He planned on signing the document with, ‘
“Handler? Don’t you Aurors have more important things to do then bother me, like I don’t know catching actual criminals.”
With his permission, Isabelle snagged her favorites. Along with the picture of her and Jasmine she chose a picture of Draco, Max, and Thomas stuck in a fierce battle of chess. Macy dancing a hair brush held to her mouth as a microphone. Thomas sketching, his eyes focusing on something beyond the camera.
“There’s a rumor in Ravenclaw that Harry Potter had a parchment that showed everyone's exact location within Hogwarts. Is that true?”
A fire was lit in the fireplace casting shadows in a dance across the walls. They all were once more gathered in the living room, it was a peaceful scene no outsider could encroach on their private bubble.
Before, when he thought of the future and what he was doing caused him to sob, but now the same thought brought a hopeful smile on his face.
“Potter, there are children here!” Draco gasped out between laughs.
Draco rolled his eyes at the obvious lie but didn’t call the man out on it; arguing with Potter was just a waste of energy. It’s not like he might actually enjoy the other’s company. That’s just ridiculous.
But what really drew Draco’s attention were the tattoos that decorated her arms. The ink appeared to dance across her skin as she moved, the patterns reached to the sleeves of Luna's shirt.
“It serves you right!” Draco said, head jerking toward Thomas. The teenager was inching behind Draco to use him to block the goat that was encroaching on the boy’s space.
Thomas was the next to move toward the blankets. “Well. I need to be on the other edge. My limbs are the longest and I doubt you all want me in the center kicking you.”
Before Draco could start listing the accusations, starting with the letter A, a laugh rang out. The three adults turn to the owner of the noise and saw Macy's frame shake in mirth.
The kitchen was first up in the tour because of its proximity to the dining hall. It was a large room, with an excessive amount of counter space. Draco informed the group that Mittsy kept a tight ship in there, so to stay on her good side they shouldn't make a mess of the room.
Macy knelt beside Isabelle pointing at the fishes swimming by. Draco saw Thomas and Max heading toward the entryway with a sign above that read,
“We’re doing yoga.” Isabelle supplied helpfully.
The others were getting farther away from them, so Draco scooped the boy up using his unoccupied arm. He picked up the pace to catch up as Max’s head sleepily drifted onto Draco’s shoulder.
“Fine!” Was her reply, instead of the tantrum he was expecting.
“Thomas, don’t be rude!” Macy admonished.
He just had that revelation this morning, it wasn’t time to cower like before. This was his chance to prove to them that he changed. Picking up the tea cup, Draco hoped that Potter could look past their history to see that.
By the time Draco had the correct size down and helped Max into them, Isabelle called out to him for attention. Looking over to the girl, he found her struggling to walk in shiny, pink, seven-and-a-half centimeter heels.
“Just don’t go running to the press. They may think I’m trying to corrupt you.”
“Macy hates our parents for what they did and who they are, but I can’t. I want to! But every time I try all I remember are the birthdays spent together, or my father teaching me to fly, and my mother’s soft voice.” He turned to Draco, his eyes sad and confused.
“Godson? You mean that’s my cousin's child?” Draco inquired, leaning down to get a glimpse at one of his few living relatives.
The blonde turned from the fireplace. Blinking away the grey spots in his vision, caused by the light of the fire, as he hurried to his potion’s lab. He threw open the doors of the oak cabinet and with single proficient movement plucked the desired potion from the many glass vials.
“We were making a cake.” Isabelle said.
“Thank you! That’s why you two are my favorites.” Draco says and gave them a hug. Isabelle giggled, giving him a kiss on the cheek, while Max went bright red with a stuttered, “Your welcome.”
As he watched Draco Malfoy guide them all gracefully through the poses, ever confident in his abilities without the usual arrogance, he could admit that Malfoy was bloody attractive.
“Real subtle, Macy.” Thomas mocked his sister, throwing a pillow at her back.
A strange look passed over Potter’s face, “You’ve read that book.”
Macy took the opportunity to inquire about her new guardian's life, waiting until he was once more sitting with a cup to his lips when she pounced.
The envelopes were bound together with a piece of twine and keeping them closed was a red wax seal. That presented a familiar school crest.
Down the alley, a group of boys were gathered around a sobbing girl kneeling on the ground.
Draco Malfoy wasn’t having a good day. Well, he hadn’t experienced a ‘good day’ in years. Not since The-Dark-Lord-with-No-Nose barged into his life, destroying any future he’d planned. So, he had a valid excuse for his sour mood.
Glaring at the nosy individuals, the blonde wished he had remembered to down a potion of Polyjuice in the mad rush to leave the house. The kids hadn't picked up on the attention the ex-death eater had drawn, too busy lugging the many suitcases forward.
“Now come on. My house elf has dinner ready for us and I’m hungry. We can discuss your plans there.” With that, Draco scooped Isabelle up and set her on a hip. He offered his free hand to Max; who hesitated at first, but soon grasped Draco’s hand in his own.
And that brings us here, Draco staring at Potter, who once again stood at his door, arms crossed and sans Auror robes.
The two stepped down the stairs toward the kitchen to make some warm milk. The beverage always helped calm him down as a child.
The goats suddenly stopped their advance as a sharp whistle broke through the air. They about faced and trotted over to a crouched Harry Potter with animal feed cupped in both his hands. The two animals that practically attacked Draco and Thomas a second ago, were now nosing peacefully at Potter’s hands.
He told Thomas to move his elbows off the table. For that, Draco received a glare.
"How can I assist you, Max?" Draco said, cutting off the charm once the sheet was secured and turned to the boy.  Max stood in the doorway fiddling with the camera that hung from his neck.
Facing the three, Draco said, “You all stay safe, and if there is anything you need send me a message. I’ll make sure you get it. Also, wear warm clothes around the castle. Trust me, the common rooms may be warm, but the halls always seemed to have chill.” Draco took a breath ready to continue but the first warning whistle sounded cutting him off.
Mittsy was young by house elf standards and had been with the family for as long as Draco could remember.
Shaking off the melancholy, Draco secured his wand in his sleeve when Harry’s deep voice sounded from behind.
“In your dreams, Potter.” Draco sneered.
“Good, now let’s take off those dirty clothes.” Draco said eyeing her robes, “Those need to be destroyed too, so they may never see the light of day again.”
Once kids finished gathering their shoes, they brought them to the service desk to pay. Looking down his nose at the cashier when he saw her judgmental look for the kids' untidy appearance.
Despite the declaration of Draco's innocence, the rest of the wizarding world weren't as forgiving. There had been many occasions where his infamy had brought trouble. Before long, Draco had to wear a disguise to navigate the streets unharmed. Learning the hard way that people only cared about the mark on his arm.
Harry was about to answer him, when there was a click over the phone and a soft voice gave a greeting.
“Seriously, what do you want from me? If you were so sure of my evilness, then why’d you testify for me?” Draco yelled, throwing his arms in the air.
The teen was laying on the bed, above the covers. He was tossing a small golden ball in the air, one that Draco immediately recognized as a golden snitch.
“Fine, then tell me how you were able to stay the leader of the Slytherin house. I hear you were the head snake since your first year,” Macy pressed excitedly. “You are a legend in our house for having the longest reign for centuries. Come on, I need tips.”
“That’s right Jasmine! If you ever need to talk to someone about anything, other than homework, then I’m your gal.” Macy excitedly stated, reaching to grasp the other girl’s hand between her own.
Walking down the path, Draco smiled to himself when he heard the other three follow.
“Well then let’s fix that.” Max trailing behind him as they headed to the washroom.
Once everyone had their fill of dinner, Draco called Mittsy for dessert. With a snap of her long, bony fingers six slices of chocolate cake appeared on the table, one in front of each person. The cake was drizzled with fudge and decorated a red cherry on top.
Draco looked back at the picture of the skittish boy. Pity and grief bloomed in his chest. He slowly shut this file after signing it and replaced it with the forth folder.
latest hit single played in the background with Macy singing along, off key.
It would be impossible for the six of them to finish all the food at the table. Although, the way the kids were eyeing the buffet there was little doubt they'd try their best to tuck away every morsel.
Draco's stomach felt as if it were trying to leave his body through his throat every time he looked out to the moving landscape. He didn’t know how the others could handle it.
“What exactly are you accusing me of Malfoy?” Harry asked darkly.
The Nitwiker siblings could no longer contain their snickers as Mittsy told the tale of Draco's stuffed kneazle. The man ignored the two, he hadn't played with Mr. Fuzzles since first year. Besides he refused to feel embarrassed when he was the only one who knew when to use the utensils.
scrawled across the back of each.
Once Draco finished washing the boy’s hair he asks, “Are you done in the bath, Max?”
He explained the purpose of the salve to the Ravenclaw, and she covered the few bruises she'd collected at the orphanage with the cream.
“Of course, I will. I need a break anyway.” Draco patted Max's head to reassure the boy.
“Stop. No one's going anywhere. Macy please stop screaming.” Draco brought out his wand, “First, we need to get the Aurors down here.”
“I see.” Draco set Isabelle down on the seat beside Macy. “I’ll be right back.”
“Well, we are shopping to fill up your entire wardrobe for you, so pick the ones you like.”
“I’m sure you weren’t but we can’t spend all day here.” Draco said.
Both Jasmine and Thomas rolled their eyes, giving Draco identical looks of ‘
“So, where did you get the quill? Do you just carry one around with you?”
“Nobody likes me.” Macy said, but was quick to correct herself, “I mean, when I walk down the halls everyone who’s not wearing the same green and silver colors sneers at me and I feel so disgusting. Last year, I had decided to stop wearing my tie, but they still stared at me. I’m constantly scared of being hexed.”
“Draco.” Jasmine says in greeting, not looking at the other and continued to take photos of the jellyfish.
The man paled, but he wouldn’t be Harry Potter if he’d back down from every challenge presented to him.
“Thank you, Jasmine. I’ll try to survive the next few months without you, it will be difficult,” Draco sarcastically replied. But everyone heard the truth in the words.
“They want everyone to believe the war is over, but in those halls, it’s still raging strong. Every Slytherin is an enemy doesn’t matter if the kid’s a muggle born or a pure- blood. And it’s not only our house being affected. Pure bloods from any house are being targeted and don’t get me started on those with death eater ties. Students are being disowned if they are not placed in the ‘correct’ house. And I’m sick of it, why does it matter? All because a stupid hat decides to place you in a glorified dorm doesn’t have anything to do with who a person will be. Only they can decide that! No one seems to care that there is nothing but fear and hatred still at Hogwarts and it needs to be addressed!” Thomas finished his rant, chest heaving and eyes glassy.
“I’m supposed to hate them. They are the worst kind of people. I should hate them, right?”
Jasmine was too caught up in reciting the recent studies done at St. Mungo’s about a connection between mutations and magic to notice Thomas and Macy slip away. Draco drifted off, preoccupied by the reptiles, letting the girl's words to fly over his head.
And so, Max and Isabelle watched the scuffle unfold. Draco trying to free his hand, and Harry trying to calm him down. A tricky twist of his hand broke Potter’s hold, the sudden release had the brush swiping uncontrolled against Potter’s face. A jagged, blue line swept along the man's cheek to his chin.
“Are you going to stand there all night or are you going to help us, old man?”
Draco placed his favorite last. Taking up the space above the fireplace, where a portrait of Draco and his parents was once displayed. The oil painting hadn't survived the Death Eater's occupation of the manor, destroyed during one of Grayback's fits of rage.
“Draco?” Max called. The ginger looked imploringly at the older man and held up his palette. “I can’t get the color right, can you help?”
But it was Macy that had done the most work this night. She had already finished Thomas’ makeup, who was surprisingly docile during the whole thing. When questioned about his nonchalant attitude he shrugged and claimed he was used to such antics from Macy.
“Take care of yourself.”
“I wanted to know how he got the horses to the king.” But as he said this his eyelid slid the rest of the way shut and he was asleep. Draco shut off the astrolabe and returned it to its rightful place against his chest. Closing his eyes, he soon followed the others into sleep.
Entering Max’s room, Draco saw the small boy sitting on a chair in the corner of the room, twiddling his fingers.
“We wanted to go with everyone.” Isabelle said.
He looks the same as when he was that stupid, naïve teenager. Back when he thought his parents could do no wrong; that they would always do what’s best for him. But looking into grey eyes and thinking about last night, Draco had a realization.
“I can damn well try.”
“I’ve had nightmares like this.” Harry whispered.
“I told her to tell the Headmistress or you, but she said she could handle it.” Thomas continued, “And well it looks like she did.”
Draco suppressed his irritation as he followed Luna’s directions to blend the two paint colors together. It puzzled him why he felt this way.
Draco learned that his father’s beliefs were wrong in the most uprooting way possible. And would be the first to say that Lucius had many, massive faults.
“Oh, ha ha ha, like you would do any better with an animal.” Thomas snapped, leaning back against the fence.
The next document was for Thomas Nitwiker's sister, Macy Lauren Nitwiker. A thirteen-year-old girl. Draco could see the family resemblance; both had brown hair and the same hazel eyes. Their facial structures so similar that a genetic link could be the only explanation.
The next few hours were spent arranging those photos on bedroom walls according to Max's and Isabelle's exact directions. Other photos would randomly appear throughout the manor in the following days. Each one that now hung had its own intricate frame and enlarged to fill the once bare, lonely walls.
“Hi, Mittsy.” Max said. Taking Draco’s hand, Max pulled him to the other side of the table revealing dozens of polaroid pictures spread out on the floor. Max sat in front of them and shifted through the images.
“Draco, they have to come with us! I promised Teddy that I would show him the monkeys, I can’t break a promise.” Isabelle whined.
Despite the lack of natural light, it was Draco’s second favorite room in the manor. His favorite being the library.
Green eyes meet green, Harry was surprised by the apathetic look on the girl’s face. Every meeting before the child had always been very cheerful.
The statement elicited varying responses from the group of children. Isabelle seemed deaf to everything around her, while Maximus let out a squeak in fright. The older girls turned two identical, indifferent stares onto Draco. The look in those eyes unnerved him. The taller of the five formed an angry scowl and directed a cutting glare at the Director.
And thus, began an epic tug-of-war battle between Draco and the goat. One trying to avoid ripping the cloth; the other looking for a snack.
He now understood their struggle. His hair was a mess from his fingers running through it, and clothes rumpled from wrangling the five to their destination. It was a miracle that they had made it without him having a mental breakdown.
Harry’s eyes, once slits, were now wide taking in the sight of Draco Malfoy. Hair styled, a baggy gray shirt on that revealed his collar bones and a generous portion of his chest. The shirt brushed his upper thighs where it met a pair of tight elastic pants that were tie dyed dark purple and black. To finish it off he was barefoot.
“Fine. But you better find a replacement soon.”
Setting his burden down, Draco approached the child. Placing a hand over the abused forearm to stop the subconscious movements.
Draco placed the glass container of salve on the sink counter. Then knelt on the ground beside the bathtub to block the drain and start the water flowing. Adjusting the temperature as needed.
“It was romantic,” Macy haughtily said, “but I wouldn’t expect you to know anything about romance. I bet all you want to do today is go see a Quidditch match.”
“Her parents are Death Eaters, so she deserves to pay,” a boy replied looking down his nose, pride radiating from him. He paused, awaiting praise for his actions against someone born of evil. There was still so much hatred in this world.
Potter stood there, legs spread. An arm lifted in a flex, he had his face scrunched in the cliché heroic expression. And on his apron was the body of a man, a single leaf was the only thing keeping the image decent. A six pack and bulging quads were painted on the black material, all in all, it was so very absurd.
After that annoying morning, he really didn’t need this right now. He thought as he took in the appearances of the two Aurors at his doorstep. One who he’d rather never to see again.
“I knew you would understand.” She took off both shoes and added the pair of boots to her pile. “OK I’m ready.”
Draco checked the time using a
But it was his kids that held his attention. Thomas and Jasmine stood side by side chests out and faces stern. Behind them was Macy who held her head high. A large bruise was forming from her eye across her cheek and there seemed to be a bite wound oozing blood on her wrist.
“This is Mr. Humphrey. He’s here from the Ministry to finally take you off my hands,” Tally said, gesturing to Draco.
Jasmine and Macy were teaming up to push the cart topped with both girls supplies.
Draco stepped out of the unfamiliar fireplace, noticing that most surfaces of the large room was covered in dark marble. A single pane of glass made up the entire wall across from him, the only place free of the dark decor. This allowed visitors to look out and admire the beautiful view.
Isabelle stepped out of the heels and rushed to Draco, saying, “I love-love them.”
It felt like a train collided against Draco’s chest at the sight of her green eyes. Ones that shared such similarity with a boy once forced to kneel before him, both pleading for his help. It was one of the few times Draco had made the right choice. A brave decision. And without much more thought he stepped forward.
That’s where Draco found the group of kids, all gathered around the crowded windows to stare out.
The only response was Isabelle flipping over onto her stomach, so she couldn’t see the man in front of her anymore.
Besides, Jasmine seemed more mature than most kids her age.
Jasmine and Thomas peered in the cart as one of the cases hanging precariously on the edge started to shift. A hissed, “Max” came from within the mass of trunks.
Draco felt a tug on his hand, where Isabelle was pulling on his fingers. “Are they being mean? She asked worriedly, before he could give an answer, she was yelling at the Aurors.
By the time the older man realized they had company Max had managed to climb over his shoulder and was clinging on to the fabric on his back. The boy was able to dodge every twist Draco preformed to grab at him.
“You’ve met a hippogriff?” Jasmine asked, awed.
At the end of his speech, a child was suddenly clinging to his leg.
“I want your autographs too.” Harry said.
“Mittsy could you go and inform the kids of our guests." Rolled his eyes as Potter's eyes hardened when his house elf appeared. “And could you tell them to meet us here. Thank you.”
“Do you have a star named after you?”
Much to Draco's grief, time seemed to slow as they walked to the Manor, but the gates did eventually appear in the distance. Signaling an end to Draco's misery.
“So, Mr. Humphrey. You’re here on behalf of the Ministry about the children of the unsavory families?” Tally inquired, her high-pitched voice brought Draco out of his spiraling thoughts. Her gaze sharp enough that he quickly checked his occlumency shields.
She grasped Draco’s robes as he sized her up. She was younger then he’d first thought. Her head reached mid-thigh, eyes large in her oval face, ebony hair brushed against a round chin. The clothes she wore were dirty and hung loose on her thin frame. They wouldn't be able to keep a child warm.
He continued to point out the different stars and constellations that shared a name with his relatives. Such as the star Regulus and the constellations of Cygnus and Orion.
He tossed on his most impressive outfit he owned; in these types of situations it is best to look your best. That is when a person is most intimidating. “Here’s the plan. First, Max and Isabelle. You two go get Uncle Snape.”
That and the sound of Thomas fake gagging got Draco’s attention. He gave Thomas a small shove as he passed by the group to stop the disturbing noises coming from his throat.
“Mittsy!” he called for his lone house elf. She appeared in front of the man with a pop.
Letting out a breath, Draco handed Isabelle to Harry, “Well, you are good with kids. I’ll give you that.” He said glancing over at Teddy.
Isabelle's grip on his hand tightened as they came to a stop.
Macy had an identical description as her brother. Once again, Draco signed the dotted line on the next page and continued to the final folder.
Groaning, Draco knocked on the opened door, “Don’t tell me you’re a fan of that group.”
And when she wasn’t complementing their appalling behavior, she would tell stories from Draco's childhood.
Jasmine and Thomas were the only two who heard the noise as Draco was too busy trying to placate a panicked Macy. She had latched onto his arm, bemoaning the kids absence.
“Leave it.” Draco smacked the arm causing it to jerk, leaving a large streak across the canvas.
Maximus was fidgeting from foot to foot, worrying his bottom lip. His left hand picked at the scars on his right forearm.
Which was a goddamn lie, with how Potter’s shirt hugged his arms and torso, the Auror had one amazing body. At least to Draco’s expert eye.
Hey guys, here's the next chapter. Please let me know what you think and enjoy.
