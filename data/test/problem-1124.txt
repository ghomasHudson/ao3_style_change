Finally, she looked over at him. “Do you want your papa to date this man?”
Harry groaned. “You don’t just ask someone out on Valentine’s day, it’s not on.” He considered for a moment. “Wait, that means one of you knew in advance? And you didn’t warn me? What kind of friends are you?”
“Do you want me to talk to him?” Professor Mentis was obviously trying not to sound too eager.
“Norway - Merlin her handwriting is terrible.”
“Are you all ready to head home?” Draco asked.
“And you, Scorpius.” Hermione gave him a friendly smile. “Are you seven like Rosie?”
“Yeah, why not?” Harry asked, taking a hesitant step forward.
“For all you know he’s on a date.” Draco said, absently brushing imaginary lint off his robes.
“The one who heard me and papa on the wireless and makes brownies. He said he wanted to meet papa and me but papa said it didn’t work that way and then he dated that awful lady instead. And now he’s going to be so cross with me. He probably hates me.” A fresh flood of tears soaked the hem of Ron’s cloak.
“Thanks ever so.” Draco said to Pansy, wiping his hands on a tea towel before coming around to crouch down at Scorpius’ eye level. He had been waiting till Scorpius was a little older to have the “daddy is queer” talk with his son.
Brunch was pleasant and the party smaller than anticipated - Bill and Fleur and their youngest, Luis, were visiting Fleur’s parents in France. Percy and Audrey had arrived with baby Molly in tow, George and Angelina were there with Fred and Roxanne, and Luna had brought her friend Rolph along in what Harry soon learned was a misguided attempt between her and Ginny (conspicuously absent due to a work event) to set him up. Luckily Charlie was back on a rare visit home and had captivated Rolf with tales of Siberian snow dragons so thoroughly that he barely said two words to Harry. That was fine with him - Harry was in no mood for a blind date and still felt upset over the previous night. He half-considered telling Ron and Hermione about it, but was worried about the latter’s reaction as Hermione had become strangely protective of Draco over the past few months.
Harry waved at the bartender. “I think it helps that I come with pocketfuls of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. I’ve been told that my direct line to an endless supply of jokes and pranks is one of my finest qualities.”
Harry and Pansy were slower to rejoin the party, with the latter hanging off Harry’s arm and trying to walk steadily in her tall heels. Draco watched them from where he stood beside Blaise, as waitstaff wove through the crowd handing out bubbling glasses of champagne to all present. While the clock counted down Pansy leaned toward Harry and said something quietly in his ear - Harry laughed and shook his head.
Scorpius’ eyes had gone wide. “Do you still hate them?”
Draco found he really did need something hot to drink and it turned out Hermione was surprisingly good company They ended up at a trendy wizard coffee shop with which Hermione seemed quite familiar - she ordered a latte that came in a large glass mug with a handle. Draco ordered chamomile tea with honey and a bit of milk, following her over to one of the tables by the window.
“I’ll come back all the time, amá.” Sayeda promises solemnly, then to Harry. “Amá and Baba want me to stay at Hogwarts on weekends for the first year and then we’ll decide if I want to come home on weekends.”
“Well, he was in the DA but I was a little too busy to really get to know him. It’s funny, actually, his office is near Hermione’s - he works for the DMLE as a prosecutor. Hermione and I went to the cafeteria to order lunch one day when I was visiting her, and Anthony was behind us in line. We both got the same order, and I made a joke about how we were perfectly matched.”
“Okay papa!” Scorpius cried, rushing to Draco’s side to take his hand.
“Yes but you actually want to be having sex, Draco, and that’s the difference.” Pansy surveyed the crowd. “You don’t have to marry or even date them - casual sex has never been easier. I bet you could find someone here - that one by the fishtank, for example?”
“When you adopt an animal you make a commitment-”
There was a brief pause. “Did he have one before?”
Potter purses his lips as though he’s about to object, then seems to think better of it and nods.
After dinner, Arthur brought Harry out to his toolshed for a chat - Anthony had been cornered by Rose who demanded he explain Hanukkah to her in detail after Harry had let slip he would be meeting the Goldstein family at that year’s celebration.
“Children?” Hermione asked tentatively, her wand movements ceasing as she studied him.
Draco laughed, though he quickly realized it was the wrong reaction. “Esme, I’m not, I promise you. I’m attracted to all genders. I wouldn’t be using you in any capacity - I’m not ashamed of who I am and I don’t care enough about what the rest of the world thinks to want to hide it.”
“The handwriting is too confusing.” Scorpius pouted.
“No papa” Scorpius said seriously. “To meet the man from the letters.”
Ron shrugged but did not defend himself - in fact, he glanced over at Hermione and winked.
“Oh…” Potter trails off, raises a hand to run it through his hair, then seems to remember it is full of product and thinks better of it. “To be honest, I saw you get on and was curious.”
“Another trait he inherited from his mother, as you might have guessed. I-” Draco was cut off by the sound of his name being called. “-must see what Blaise wants. If you’ll excuse me?”
Scorpius was at his Aunt Daphne and Uncle Blaise’s house on the 1st. He was ostensibly at a play date with his cousins, Verena and Cassius, who were two and eleven respectively and not very interested in Scorpius. Daphne and Blaise were not neglectful parents but they were busy, and their children spent a lot of time with their nanny. Because Scorpius was quiet in relation to his cousins, she generally left him to his own devices which usually involved reading or drawing in the library.
“It glows red papa.”
The man’s voice is a gentle, a sound that ripples out around them to soften the dingy kitchen. Sirius has his eyes closed and he is carelessly twirling a snifter around on the wooden table with one tattooed, scarred hand. In the warm light he looks a little like the boy he must have been, wild and handsome.
Scorpius nodded shyly, but Rose held out her hand.
“You are terrible at this.” Draco can’t keep the glee from his voice - he hadn’t expected to trounce Harry so thoroughly on their first go. “Weren’t you raised by muggles? Shouldn’t it be easier for you?”
Pansy sighed but stopped herself before the temptation to roll her eyes overtook - she had long ago promised Astoria to support Draco, and directly countering him in front of his son seemed like a bad way to keep that promise. So she did as the young boy said, reciting the words of the spell and waiting for the letter to glow gold. When it did, she neatly detached the wax seal and began to read it aloud:
I re-wrote this 2x and still am not exactly where I want to be with it.
Draco shook his head. “I don’t think that’s going to happen, Scorpius. Harry has a partner already.”
“He’s a fool anyway. Clearly not meant to be your husband.” Ron nudged Harry. “I think something better will come along.”
“What is that primary school teaching you?” Draco set a knife slicing tomato as he scrambled eggs. Scorpius shrugged, shaking the letter impatiently at him. Draco gave his son a quelling look, but couldn’t help smiling. “Norway is too far a-way to consider. Next.”
“Misunderstanding what?”
“So let him keep Tiberius then.”
“Scorpius is very fond of Rose.” He agreed, trying to keep his voice level even as the realization broke over him that his equilibrium was rapidly diminishing under Potter’s gaze.
“Ah, Molly knows does she?” He asked as the dishes bumped against Hermione’s back.
Harry shrugged. “I guess so.”
Pansy looked over at Draco. “New career? Late night smut show?”
“Hey Hugo.” He said, bouncing the child slightly in time to the words. “How’re you doing today?”
Harry leaned forward and kissed him. “They’re going to love you. Ready?” Anthony nodded, took hold of his arm, and together they disapperated.
Harry had often quietly wondered about Malfoy over the past twelve years - he seemed to have disappeared after the hearings, at which Harry had spoken in his defense. Harry knew that the Malfoy parents had fled the country upon Lucius’ release from Azkaban (far too early, in Harry’s opinion). The only suggestion of Malfoy’s continued survival were the letters Harry, Ron, and Hermione had received on the third anniversary of the battle. In them Malfoy had apologised for years of bullying and clarified Harry’s suspicions that his actions had been born of a desperate need to survive, not an actual desire for a blood purity war. That the four of them were now standing in the same room, dressed in their finest and about to celebrate together, was such an astounding shift in tone that Harry almost couldn’t believe his own eyes.
No matter how many times he looked over the documentation - the trials, reviews, and backers they had accumulated over the past few months - he could not concentrate. After giving it an honest fifteen minutes of effort, Harry found himself sitting on the couch with a packet of crisps and a beer, idly flicking on the wireless.
“Can wizards marry each other? Do you want to marry a wizard?” Scorpius asked, wide eyed as though his entire world view was about to change.
“I think you were correct about one thing, though.” His temper getting the best of him, Draco flicked his wand, causing the front door to slam open on its hinges. “You do need to leave.”
“Fancy taking a walk to the post office, Hugo?” He asked.
“No, wait.” Rosie said decidedly, striking out their first line. “We should make it look like it’s from your papa."
“Alright” Rosie shrugged, carefully tearing the scratched out beginning of their letter from the top of the parchment “let’s use mummy’s owl button, it will be more anonymous because they change every week.”
Harry watched as Malfoy took his soon back to bed and tucked him in - he tried not to be too much of a voyeur, but the soft expression on the other man’s face, the deft way he settled the blankets around Scorpius’ shoulders, the low murmurs between the two of them, all clenched at Harry. How could Anthony not want to be a father?
“Hermione and Weasley?” Malfoy guessed.
“It’s not that - he loved Lily’s fierceness - but James always had a bit of an overprotective streak. It drove Lily mad, of course, because she was so independent.”
“Are you doing okay?” He asked, leaning down conspiratorially so he wouldn’t embarrass Scorpius. Harry could remember his own first time in the loving, warm noise of the Weasley family and how overwhelming it could be.
Pansy laughed, though it died on her lips as she continued to read: “I know what it is like to lose people. I too lived through the war and came out of it wondering where love fit into a world like ours. Hearing you describe it so succinctly on the radio has made me lose my mind, a bit, and here we are.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Magic.” The man laughed. “Which is ridiculous, because I’m a wizard. Everything is magical.”
“Says the person who connived for weeks to have him meet the bloke who broke his heart!” Ron stopped, frowning. “The Bloke Who Broke His Heart - now that would be a great title for a novel.”
Draco’s head is beginning to ache from irritation. “I usually enjoy the ride,” he snips coldly.
“Potter.” Draco searches for something to say and lands awkwardly on “how’s married life treating you?”
Pansy had begun to make a habit of stopping by Draco’s home on Friday evenings for dinner. Draco cooked, of course, as he wasn't sure Pansy had ever actually touched a stove. In a bid to please both picky eaters - Scorpius was going through a phase where he wouldn't eat greens and Pansy had been finicky since birth - Draco usually made some sort of pasta.
“Do you think you’ll get married to another witch someday?”
A chorus of cheers rang out and then nearly everyone was kissing - some chaste and some decidedly not. Blaise kissed Daphne, Hermione and Weasley were wrapped in a disturbingly passionate embrace, and Draco’s gaze fell yet again on Harry. He watched in amazement as the man bent down to place a friendly kiss on Pansy’s cheek before glancing up to meet Draco’s eyes. With a smile, he raised his champagne glass in a silent toast before downing its contents.
“I’m very sad, but my papa is worse.”
and she says that we’re not right for each other.”
“You are.” Ron says, taking the bottle back from him. “You are losing your mind.”
“Well, I look forward to explaining that to the cleaning service tomorrow.”
Hermione and Ron joined them shortly, the latter holding a squirming Hugo who, now quite fast and mobile on his hands and knees, objected strongly to being held.
Draco coughs against the liquid he has inhaled. “Unlikely.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” He demanded when she smirked at him.
“Now that sounds like something you heard an adult say.”
“I love your Aunt Pansy very dearly, but not in the way you love a partner.” Draco told him.
Draco shook his head and drained his glass. “Yeah, I’ll start dating, it will be fantastic. I’ll just grow a new heart.”
“Please don’t speak when you have food in your mouth.” Draco said fondly. “And anyway, this isn’t how it’s done.”
“Scorpius called into the Mind Healer Hour and told them his Christmas wish was for me to find a new love.” Draco blushed furiously. “Truth be told, I was feeling morose and went on a slightly wine filled ramble about what I think love is. Now apparently everyone and their mother has opinions on it.”
Scorpius took a moment to examine the pile of letters, then grinned. “No!”
“Thank you for having me.” He said solemnly, his expression breaking when Rose tackle-hugged him onto the couch, shrieking “Bye Scorpo, bye bye bye.”
“If that’s the case, I pity your fiancée.”
“No, I’m here with Pansy…” Draco began, gesturing to the now empty table where she had been sitting. “Or at least I was. I suppose she saw me talking to you and as she can’t see your face, assumed it was the dark haired man she sent me over here to seduce.”
2. Just because this fanfic is Drarry endgame doesn’t negate the fact that in this particular universe, Draco is bi. That he thinks about how much more he would rather be with Harry than Esme on this date says more about mutual attraction and compatibility than it does sexuality and is in no way intended to suggest that Draco is just bi till he meets the right man/woman at which point his sexuality will ping to one end of the Kinsey scale.
“Agreed.” Pansy incendioed the letter.
“Don’t believe a word he says, Sayeda.” Harry cries, all mock-outrage, with a sly wink at the end that sends the girl into a fit of giggles.
“Her new cat.” Fran explains.
“What does love mean to you?” The Professor’s voice had taken on a soothing, encouraging tone.
“Because he’s already so sad. I don’t want him to feel worse.” A quiver in the boy’s voice went straight to Harry’s heart.
Hermione put her mug down on the coffee table and came to sit beside him, encircling his shoulders with her arms. “I think you need to talk with Tony about this. It’s not something you can go into a marriage without discussing properly. Even Ron and I had to have it out before we got married because there is no way in hell I’m giving birth seven times.”
“Oy, if you don’t stop yelling I’ll be disrespecting you in a minute.” Says a wizard who looks like he should not be making this sort of promise.
“Rose?” Harry asked, then seemed to regret it immediately when Draco met his gaze.
“No, I learned a long time ago that the things my father taught me were untrue and hurtful. But I did some unkind things before I figured it out.”
“Maybe to you.” Malfoy shrugged “I’ve always been open about it. You Gryffindors, so caught up in your own drama.”
“Well it is. You hear this man on the wireless and you’re so captivated by his voice that you let it cast doubt on your relationship with Anthony - yes, I know you broke up for other reasons, but that’s not what I’m getting at. Now you’re attracted to Draco - and by the way, if you hurt him with all of this I will have your head - but you can’t ask him out because of this mysterious man from the wireless? The one who, let me remind you, you
“I haven’t found the time.”
It was altogether too much. First, to know that Harry had heard Draco’s innermost feelings on that blasted show, of all places. Second, that he had rejected Draco in the bar. And third, that Scorpius had chosen his letter from all the others that had been sent to them, and now Draco would have to suffer the humiliation of a second rejection.
By the time Draco reappeared, Pansy had set the table and placed a warming charm over the meal. She surveyed his outfit as he entered - crisp dark blue robes over black slacks and a fitted black vest and button-up. When the light hit his vest, Pansy could see that it had leaves embroidered on it in a dark green; his chin-length hair was styled attractively in a way that softened the harsher features of his face. He looked altogether too good to be going on a blind date with Daphne’s co-worker’s sister. When she said so, Draco frowned and cast a quick glance at Scorpius, who had his arms folded tightly across his chest and was glaring at his father.
He missed Astoria suddenly, fiercely, and felt overcome with anger that she had left him alone. He knew the thought wasn’t fair even as it sprang up but he let himself feel it for a moment, the rage at having lost her, at finding himself a single father and even worse, alone once again. Then the anger turned to guilt and bitter sadness, and Draco decided it was time to get well and truly pissed.
Hermione shook her head. “No, I’ve eaten - Ron tried his hand at muffins last night and they’re not bad. I brought some for you as well, but they’re already in the kitchen.” She threw the plate in front of Harry a dark look as though reminding it that her breakfast foods listened to instructions.
Despite her death, Astoria was still everywhere in the manor, a ghost he hadn’t the heart to exorcise. Without her plants died, music sounded flat, and Draco forgot to open the curtains.
Which is, of course, Potter’s cue to approach.
“Scorpius is one of the sweetest children I’ve met.” Hermione said, elbowing Ron. “Honestly not a mean bone in his body.”
Draco snorted in an undignified way and topped her up. “I have at least eleven more years before he graduates from Hogwarts, don’t I? We’ll figure out the rest later.”
“That’s-” Draco isn’t sure how to express what he’s feeling.  “I’m impressed by what you’ve chosen to do, Harry.”
Ron grinned. “A Malfoy Hufflepuff? That’s something I can’t wait to see.”
In the end, Draco’s studies had worked to neutralise the mark, enough that he was able to cover it with an utterly meaningless tattoo of a fish. It was done at a muggle shop, and the sight of Voldemort’s handiwork disappearing under the skilled machine of the woman who ran it had given Draco a special thrill.
Harry’s heart sped up and he sat up so fast he nearly overturned his beer. He flicked his wand to turn the dial up and sat forward listening to the man’s voice as it filtered out of his wireless.
The man took several deep breaths. “I’m not, come here.” Harry imagined that he had taken the little boy into his arms. “What can I do for you, Professor...Mentis, was it?”
“Thanks.” Harry sat down heavily on the sofa.
“I’m sorry to say, but that is one of your faults.” Hermione frowned as she realized that
“And you didn’t even get a shag out of it.” Pansy said crudely one Saturday evening as the two of them sipped wine at a trendy bar, part of Draco’s concession to her pleas for a night out. Scorpius was having a sleepover at the Granger-Weasley house.
“I guess it was mutual, really. I - it’s sort of stupid.” He takes a sip of tea that he doesn’t really want to fill the silence and stop himself from speaking.
“She mentions Scorpius all the time.” Potter interjected, and at last Draco allowed himself to meet Potter’s eyes. He was surprised to see that the other man’s face was friendly, relaxed. Gone was the boy who ranged from bristled to outright hostile in Draco’s presence, though that did nothing to quiet Draco’s longing to rib him a little, if only so that Potter would pay attention to him. Draco pushed that desire down, reminding himself that tactic was best left in his school days.
Draco was not at home when the letter arrived - he had an investors meeting to attend with Blaise and then dinner later on and only had time to stop at home briefly. Pansy had collected Scorpius from school and was expecting to stay with him into the night; she was in the kitchen trying to work out how to use Draco’s muggle toaster when the owl arrived. She let it in and took the envelope, then scanned the kitchen for the bag of owl treats. Finding none, she proffered one of the apple slices meant for Scorpius’ after school snack. As the owl dropped peel all over the counter, Pansy turned the letter over in her hands.
Harry looked down at their hands, at the rings on their fingers that were supposed to signify a promise of everlasting union, and felt a heavy sadness descend on him. He nodded. Anthony put a hand out and cupped the side of Harry’s head, one thumb stroking his cheek.
“Caractacus”
“He’s very good at being my papa.” Scorpius speared another piece of pancake. “I think he would like these. Even though he says sugar isn’t a sensible breakfast food he still lets me have pancakes sometimes. That’s a smart thing to do, even if I don’t always like it.”
What Rosie referred to as the "owl button" was in actuality a charmed bell that summoned the nearest free ministry owl to Hermione's home office, a perk of her elevated position and a testament to how difficult it was for her to get away from her job.
“Yes, I was in the same year. But I was a Gryffindor.” He expected the small Malfoy to make a face or comment at that, but the child only nodded. “And I didn’t know your papa very well back then.”
His graceless entrance nearly brought him crashing straight into Hermione Granger.
“Well, I do love Ginny, but we discovered it was more platonic than romantic. Now she’s married to Luna and I’m-”
“Does he still hate me?” The question was out before Draco could stop himself.
“Well.” Potter says. “Thanks for that. Closure, I suppose.”
“Thought you’d sort it out yourself - I’m glad Anthony cared enough about you to end things when he realized.”
“I’m aware. However, as ‘Ernie’ is befitting only those under nineteen and over fifty, he now goes by his full name and has for years.”
“Letters, Aunt Pansy!”
There was some muttering that sounded like swear words. “Don’t be angry papa.” Said a little voice.
“You know, James was like a brother to me, but I loved your mum just as much.” Sirius says, as though he can tell what Harry is thinking. “Never a judgement about who a person was or where they came from, and she would not let anyone get away with prejudice. I think part of it came from being a muggleborn, since purebloods weren’t shy about their bias in those days, but she was involved in muggle politics as well. She came back September of our 7th year with a - what do you call it? When you break a bone and muggle healers put that thing on it?”
“No, not since Astoria died.” Malfoy hesitated. “Too many bad memories there. And painful good ones.”
October, 2004
“What one were you in?”
Amused, Ron re-read the letter and then pulled out his wand to vanish it, but something stopped him. He skimmed the page again, remembering the desperation in Harry’s voice and how sad his best friend had seemed talking about a childless future. Ron liked Anthony just fine, but he had always felt a bit of standoffishness from the man whenever he was around Rosie and Hugo; Anthony was kind and polite, but it was clear he didn’t relish their interactions the way Harry did. Ron looked over at Hugo, who was chewing on the corner of his own jumper, at his wide brown eyes and dark, reddish curls. Ron remembered finding out he was going to be a father. He remembered holding both his children for the first time. Then he remembered the look on Harry’s face when
Draco blushed. “Well, I would have thought it was obvious.” He said after a moment.
“What does...Merlin. I’m glad this is an anonymous floo.” The man laughed, but it was sad and a little hollow. “Okay, just for you Professor, I’ll answer. Love means finding someone who fits. Someone who can see past my faults without turning a blind eye. A partner who wants to help raise S- my son while respecting his mother’s memory. A person who will forgive my ridiculously expensive tastes and find my eccentricities endearing. I want to look into their eyes and see home. Merlin, that was sappy.”
Harry took the maze at a jog, which was quite difficult given that night had fallen and it was lit only by a slightly eerie glow of fairy lights and his wand. He took a wrong turn twice, coming up short at dead ends and nearly walking head first into the horn of a marble unicorn. Eventually he found the proper route and made his way to the garden at the center of the maze, through the winding path of blooms toward the gazebo and fountain. Harry scanned the scenery for another person, feeling as though his luck truly had run out this time. He was too late.
Trying to shake off this unfortunate encounter, he strides toward the train without a backward glance. Draco settles himself at one of the first class tables on the train, spreading parchment out over the surface so he can read over his address for the thousandth time. He had been utterly shocked to be nominated by his peers in the program as a presenter at the Healers of the Magical UK conference. His mentor, Ahmet, had praised Draco’s in-depth study reverse-engineering the protean charm to alter the effects of magical curse marks. When Draco had insisted his research was purely selfish (he wanted the Dark Mark gone from his body) Ahmet had told him that most people who became master healers ended up helping themselves in some way as well.
With a glance to the door, Harry lowered his voice. “Did you always know you wanted to be a dad?”
“He’s what?!” Scorpius demanded.
“Harry?” Anthony called out.
“Who are you here with, a date?” Harry asked, looking past Draco and down the bar as though an attractive companion might materialize.
Internally, Draco sighs - he has no idea why Potter is at all interested in conversing with him, considering the awkwardness of their last interaction five years ago. Perhaps he has taken it upon himself to make sure Draco is keeping true to the terms of his parole. Or it is just Potter being his usual infuriating self. Accepting what fate has dealt, he raises his head slowly.
“Do you want some?” He asked, eyeing the mountain of eggs and bangers, toast (with strawberry jam) potatoes, and bacon.
“It’s not him, it’s - listen, Draco, I just wanted to date a nice, normal wizard. Go out and have dinner, get drinks, maybe have sex if the mood was right. I don’t want to date a - a wizard who is using me to pretend he’s straight.”
“Well-” Harry began.
Draco heaves a sigh of deep frustration and turns. It is indeed Harry Potter, looking rumpled but somehow still attractive in jeans and a Ballycastle Bats t-shirt. He's wearing the beard again, though better filled out ten years on and neatly trimmed; he also appears to have abandoned his attempts at using gel so that his hair falls in soft curls just below his ears.
“You’re engaged and you haven’t brought him to dinner before?” Molly demanded, chastising him in a loving but firm voice, happy tears in her eyes.
Draco half-listens as his friends chat over their respective days - usually he is engaged and curious about their lives, but a recent and all-consuming change in his own is distracting, and he dreads having to share it. Still, they are bound to notice eventually and there will be hell to pay if they don’t find out from him.
“No, but...isn’t love supposed to overcome differences? Look at you and Ron.”
“Why not?” Scorpius asked, looking from him to Harry.
What he had intended was to pop by the recently added midwifery wing for a quick visit with Fleur and Bill, meet the newest Weasley, then grab a bite before he has to floo back to Portsmouth with Dean for their afternoon lecture.
Forgive me the OCs, I love a cute family dynamic.
“And you’re worried about him?”
“And you’ll be an Auror I suppose?” That is what everyone has said: Harry Potter has a paved road through the ministry leading straight to him becoming the youngest head of the DMLE in recorded history.
Harry flushed. “Seeing as I am still engaged to that man, I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“No Hugo, we don’t hit.” Hermione said from where she was giving Rose’s hair one last go-over with her wand, ensuring the two puffs on either side of her daughter’s head were neatly arrayed.
Harry glanced at the clock on their mantle “I’m late, he might have already gone.”
“And sometimes Aunt Pansy too.” Scorpius said after a moment. “I’m sorry, papa. I just wanted you to be happy and you’ve been so sad.”
“Yes papa” Scorpius said, crossing the room to tuck himself into Draco’s arms. “I ate pumpkin pancakes and Mrs Weasley gave me this Holyhead Harpies robe!”
“I’m fine.” He says, to looks of disbelief. “I am. We’ve been growing apart for some time and I realized suddenly that we wanted different things.”
“So you’re saying you heard this bloke on the radio. Talking about his dead wife. And now you’re...in love with him?”
“As if you could.” Draco laughed, summoning the tea pot. “Still not drinking milk?”
“What things?” Pansy demands.
Something stirs in Harry, a peculiar feeling he doesn’t recognise and thus attributes to jealousy. Only Malfoy could look this good as someone drips blood on the floor at his feet, with his slightly rumpled hair and the robes that seem to actually compliment his features when they should, by any rights, wash him out entirely. Harry wants...something. Maybe he wants to be Malfoy? He’s still reeling from that thought when he steps out of the way of a lime-robed healer and knocks into a rather large table of pamphlets, sending it skidding across the floor and into a burly wizard with tree roots growing out of his nostrils.
Harry slumped down in his seat, balancing a plate of fruitcake on his stomach. It was Christmas eve, and the sun had just set. Anthony was working late and things were weird between them at the moment anyway. After a second rousing Sunday dinner at the burrow with all the Weasley grandchildren, plus Teddy, home from Hogwarts, Anthony had remarked casually that he was happy they didn’t have any sprogs of their own. It wasn’t something they had discussed before, and Harry found himself stuttering out questions - did Anthony ever want them? (“Never”). Not even somewhere down the road? (“No.”) What about Teddy? (“Teddy isn’t in our lives full-time”). It hadn’t occurred to Harry till just then how much he did want to be a father, but when Anthony had asked if it was a problem, Harry had lied and said no. Anthony was good. He wasn’t going to sabotage that.
“Slytherin.”
A bell chimes and almost as one, the group looks toward a spot just out of sight behind the reception desk. Whatever they see launches them excitedly down the hall, chattering and jostling each other as they go.
The silence that followed was deeply uncomfortable - Harry wiped invisible soot off his sleeves and Draco looked around the room as though seeing it for the first time.
“Why?”
“Where did all of these letters come from?” Draco demanded after the owls had been fed and shooed away and he was satisfied with the thoroughness of his cleaning charms.
Harry reached up to straighten his glasses and there was a small ripping sound as the robes caught beneath his shoe and tore.
“Is this some sort of test?” Draco demands, and when Potter shrugs, Draco heaves an audible sigh. “If I met and fell in love with a muggle then yes, I imagine that I would consider marrying them. However it would be selfishness on my part, cruelty even. Imagine finding out the man you love belonged to a family who considered you inferior? That he believed the same at one point in his life? I can’t think that I would stay with such a person. Not to mention that I would also have to explain what I am to them.”
Draco sighed heavily and surveyed the mountain of letters in his living room, wishing he had never gone on the air in the first place.
Potter nods at Draco when their eyes meet, formal but not hostile. It would still be enough to put Draco off if he hadn’t worked so hard preparing for this particular day. Despite his efforts at rehabilitating the Malfoy name through true philanthropic work (and court mandated community service in the Janus Thickney Ward) Draco is well aware that the Malfoy name is enough for most employers to reject him outright. It is no longer sufficient to simply do well, his achievements must stand above those of his peers so that he comes across as a desirable addition, someone who is worth the risk his reputation brings.
Harry threw down the quill and re-read his letter. Then he got up and strode toward the fire, throwing a pinch of floo into the flames.
Scorpius nodded. “My Aunt Daphne said it to my Uncle Blaise. I think she meant it in a nice way.”
“Oh nothing.” Hermione said, clearly enjoying herself. “Only the last time I watched you so blatantly check out a man you ended up engaged to him three months later.”
“What man?” Harry demanded, though he was quite sure he already knew the answer.
All of Hermione’s hard work boiled down to one simple fact for Rosie and Scorpius - access to an owl, provided they were brave enough to sneak into Hermione’s office. Rosie had no qualms about it: the office was technically off limits, but years of hearing stories about how her parents had broken school rules to help Uncle Harry had left Rosie with a somewhat flippant attitude when it came to rules.
“Yeah, except I didn’t send it.” Harry gave her a searching look, making Hermione scoff.
It has been a year since they’ve seen each other, and their last meeting was at Draco’s spectacularly uncomfortable trial. Potter thin and underslept, lurking like a Dementor at the back of the room with an auror guard around him to keep the reporters at bay. He had barely looked at Draco, gotten up to testify on his behalf, and then quietly left. Still, Draco knows he owes at least part of his freedom to Potter, and likely his mother’s as well. He had been given a sentence of probation and community work, Narcissa two months’ house arrest; it was better than they ever could have hoped.
Scorpius thought for a moment, then nodded and held his hand out. Harry took it and they walked over to the fireplace together. “We’ll go through first.” Harry told Ron and Hermione.
“People who heard papa on the wireless!” Scorpius said, already breaking the wax seal on one that looked rather thick.
Malfoy shook his head. “Not since the war, in fact, though I must say Hermione’s insistence that they be paid has made me reconsider from time to time. There’s a Wizarding cleaners who come in during parties.”
“Agreed.” Amani clasps Draco’s hand, then Harry’s. “Let’s not be strangers.”
“Hello Potter.”
“That’s right. That’s right.” Draco cupped the back of Scorpius’ head and hugged him tighter, unwilling or unable to look up at Harry. This was his moment with his son, a reunion that he would not sully with his own feelings of rejection.
“And you’re head of the department?”
Hermione laughed. “If you think I don’t get the same interrogations from Harry about you then you’re delusional.”
Antony’s best friend, Mandy Brocklehurst, invited Harry and Anthony for tea in the first week of the New Year. Privately, Harry found Mandy rather dull - she and Anthony had both graduated Hogwarts to attend the same school of law, graduated top of that class, and taken up positions at the ministry. While Anthony took on cases for those who could not afford regular lawyer fees and worked tirelessly to rewrite blood purity hate crime legislation, Mandy had quit public defense after a year to start her own firm. Now she made a hefty paycheque helping rich widows and petulant second sons sue the estates of the deceased, among other endeavors. Mandy kept a flat in the Phoenix District that was chic but sterile, and Harry often found himself wishing for a misplaced slipper or dog-eared book, anything to indicate actual life
“I’m going to be late.” Draco bent down so he was eye level with his son. “You’re the one who wanted me to start dating, right?”
Le Phénix was about what Draco had expected - upscale French cuisine, most of the tables occupied by couples on dates. His own companion for the evening, Esme, was already seated at a cosy corner table, a glass of white wine in front of her. She smiled when she saw him cross the room and Draco smiled back - she was very pretty, a round face and large blue eyes, brown curls pinned up in a loose knot on her head, a conservative but stylish purple dress. Exactly the kind of woman his parents would have loved till they found out one of her parents was muggle-born. As Draco had long ago decided such prejudices were ugly and beneath him, he had no qualms about that aspect of Esme’s identity.
He forces himself to focus on the exam, not sparing a glance for the other side of the room where Potter is working diligently through his own. Draco almost forgets about him till somewhere around the third hour when one of the adjudicators asks Potter to cast a Patronus charm. Draco suspects that it is curiosity more than an actual test of skill, Potter's patronus having become synonymous with the wizard himself.
As he pulls A Day at the Races out of the sleeve, a note flutters to the floor. It is worn, having been folded and re-folded, the paper thin with age.
June, 2002
Scorpius nodded enthusiastically. “Yes!”
“Nope.” Harry debated mentioning Anthony, but something held him back.
Scorpius nodded solemnly at her, then turned to look at Draco. “Your new partner might be in one of these letters papa. I think we should read them.”
“I was surprised - I mean, I get a lot of cards because” Harry waves vaguely at himself “but I have this sorting spell that puts the ones from people I know in their own pile, and every year there’s one from your mum.”
“Is your family smaller too?” Scorpius asked.
“Are you really busy? Rosie said you were famous.”
“Papa?” Scorpius asked. Pretending he hadn’t been listening in, Draco turned around.
“Too many years to count.”
“Well I’d gathered that. Who are they from?”
“Nonsense” Arthur said, waving his wand to repair the rip. “Do you remember Ron falling over his own feet trying to waltz with Hermione at their wedding? These robes have seen more than you and I put together.”
“Focus please. Why did you send it?” Harry tried, and failed, to feel indignant.
Harry looked over at Scorpius who seemed to have withdrawn slightly and looked somehow a paler than usual. He nodded, handing Hugo over to Hermione so he could sit beside the other boy.
“Scorpius.” Draco warned. “Now is not the time and furthermore, it’s exceptionally rude.” He steered his awful son toward the fireplace and glanced back at Esme. “I’m just going to take him to his Aunt’s and then I’ll be right back.”
Draco feels heat rise in his cheeks; it’s not true, of course, just that he can barely enter a magical establishment without hearing about Potter. If he reads the occasional headline he’s hardly to blame, they’re everywhere, especially since the announcement of Potter’s engagement to Weasley a few weeks ago. Even his cohort - all younger than Draco because he had purposely waited two years to start so as not to enter with anyone who would remember him very well from Hogwarts - is obsessed with Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley’s upcoming wedding. When they found out he was in Potter’s year, that he knew the man, they were beside themselves. “I can’t read the Prophet without seeing something about your love life.”
at home.”
“I can. The snogging, him seeing you to the train station. Those are new relationship things.”
“Blaise and I work together, he runs a potions business and I do most of the brewing. We're relatively successful.” This was an understatement on Draco's part, but he had grown up too much to brag.
“Yeah, but not as much.” Harry felt a flutter of fear in his chest and he began to grasp at anything he could find to stop their conversation from going in this direction. “And we’ll sign him up for Quidditch camp in the summer. He’ll be gone most of the year. You knew this might be a thing, I’m his godfather afterall.”
Harry did just that, apparating round to Andromeda’s tidy little home the next day. She agreed much more readily than anticipated, and as his eyes traveled over the house Harry could see why. It wasn’t untidy- Andromeda paid a house elf for cleaning and meal preparation - but it was obvious that during Teddy’s absence she stayed mostly in her chair beside the fire, reading through the stacks of books that rose up all around her like little hills. She was lonely, he could tell. Though she was only just pushing sixty there was a certain frailty to her that belied her lengthy battle with illness - a weak heart, the healers said. Magic could do many things, but physiology was undeniable; in the muggle world she would likely have been taken by a heart attack, but she was fortunate enough to be a witch. What the condition meant was that Andromeda had very small reserves of energy and even those varied from day to day. Though Harry and the Weasleys visited often, he knew that since her diagnosis Andy had stopped going to volunteer at the various organizations she loved, finding herself far too exhausted afterward. No matter how much they cared about each other, Andy was often still too proud to admit she needed help.
He shrugged. “It...wasn’t unexpected.”
And then:
.” Harry said, unsure how he felt about it.
“We used to joke that we were the perfect pair, and I suppose we were in the beginning, the two of us and our kneazle Tyberius. But I became busier with school and then the clinic, and Ernest’s practice took off. It got to a point where I would barely see him in passing. And Tiberius…”
“Quiet down!” an older witch beside him says admonishingly.
“And have you dated any witches since.”
“I promised Rosie that I’d stay up late! But Harry’s her uncle and he says her grandma won’t let her stay up till midnight either.”
“Are you coming with us, Scorpius?” He asked, attempting to brush soot off his jumper - even after using the floo thousands of times he still felt as thought he hadn’t quite worked it out.
Arthur accioed a box from the rafters and drew forth a set of deep blue robes with slightly lighter blue trim. Unlike many of the other items that had made their way through the Weasley family, these were in pristine condition. Harry shrugged out of his sweater as Arthur draped the garment around him.
Across from him Ron snores softly, his face tucked into the crook of one freckled arm. The silence in the rest of the room is oppressive and absolute, pressing in on Harry as he tries to will himself to sleep. When he can stand it no longer, he levels his body carefully from beneath the sheets, stepping quietly across the scratched wood floor. He tells himself that he’s going to get a glass of water and then go straight back to bed, but when he arrives on the landing of the first floor the kitchen is already occupied.
“Come sit in my lap and we’ll read it together.”
Draco pauses for a moment as the silver apparition gallops around the room, coming so close that his robes flutter in its wake. It is impressive and somehow too personal at the same time, almost rude to request such a thing, and yet everyone does. Potter's adjudicators applaud, he manages an uncomfortable smile, and the stag fades away.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I can’t wait to be charged with taking care of that beast.”
“In November.” Scorpius said. Rose looked over at him as though it was the first time she had noticed he was there.
The Granger-Weasley family was just sitting down to a late supper when Draco burst from their fireplace.
The small boy thrust out his hand and said, in a quiet voice. “Pleased to meet you.”
“A plaster cast?” Harry supplies, being personally quite familiar with this particular facet of muggle medicine.
“I just didn’t think you’d bet on
A couple makes their way over, the woman’s dark curls slightly looser than Sayeda’s framing thick-lashed eyes and light brown cheeks. She is arm in arm with a man Draco assumes is her husband, his skin a similar shade as his daughter’s, hair and beard going grey. They’re older than most parents with a child this age, but they exude an energy that is almost palpable. “Harry” the woman says “so lovely to see you again.”
“What? No!” Harry grimaced. “I didn’t see who it was, but they certainly seemed to be getting along.”
Inwardly, Draco winced - over the many years of their acquaintance Daphne had had plenty to say about his hair. In their school days, following the unfortunate incident in fourth year, she had taken to calling him the “platinum ferret”. She really only let off when Draco started seeing Astoria, and of course she couldn’t say anything about it now that her beloved nephew bore the same pale blond locks. At least, not to his face.
“Maybe, but drinks are better for the first date. With dinner, you might decide you don’t like them halfway through the appetizers and then you’re stuck finishing. You can always follow up drinks with dinner if you want to.” Draco paused. “Unless it doesn’t work like that anymore.”
“I’m not ready to date anyone new yet.” Draco says firmly, catching the server’s eye and gesturing for another drink. “There has to be a period of adjustment, mourning, and figuring out a custody arrangement for Tiberius.”
“We’re both adults.” He says firmly. “I’m sure it will be fine.”
“I did.”
It was nice to see Harry slightly wrong-footed without any of the less pleasant side-affects, so Draco nodded but didn’t say anything, taking another sip of Pansy’s drink.
“See? Pot- Harry never stayed up till midnight when he was your age. Now, let’s get you back to bed.” Malfoy said, his voice far kinder than Harry could have imagined
“Like you.”
“We should meet his parents, maybe you could invite them over next weekend.” Arthur suggested.
“When Hermione said you two were having coffee I was a bit surprised.” Weasley interjected, and Draco’s gaze swung to him - he had finally grown into his body, broad shouldered and stocky, his freckled face bearing a stronger jaw than he’d had in his youth. Draco could even admit - secretly, in a place he would never, ever reveal to another living soul - that Weasley might have gotten handsome.
Neither says a word as the story unfolds, one of a young man’s poor choices and regrets that feels slightly too poignant, the voices rising dramatically till it seems as though there is an operatic chorus in the kitchen.
“Because of the war?”
A woman’s pleading voice faded in. “I don’t know what to do Professor, every time we make love and I’m close to orgasm he gets up to have a pumpkin pasty.”
“In two years!”
“Surely one of your friends would agree to a drink?”
“What about Hermione’s house?” Daphne asked “Maybe he got bored and went to visit Rose?”
They were crossing a little stone bridge and Anthony stopped, turning to face Harry full on. “Live with us?”
“Hello.” Harry replied. “Aren’t you supposed to be asleep?”
“Are you seeing anyone right now?” Draco asked after what appeared to be a moment of contemplation.
Molly’s army of food was still waiting for instruction. “Honestly - to the fridge with all of you.” She said, waving her wand in irritation. Most of the dishes obeyed, but a plate stacked high with breakfast food remained, inching slowly toward Harry, who reached out to take it when it got close enough.
“It’s when grown ups only hang out once and never again.” Draco explained absently.
He accomplishes the first task - Dominique has a head of strawberry blonde hair and still bears the slightly squashed look of a newborn, but Harry delights in how her entire hand curls around one of his fingers when he holds her. Being very familiar with new parents (the Weasley family has been productive since the war ended) he doesn’t overstay his welcome, and is on his way to the exit when he spots a familiar flash of white-blonde hair.
“Do you want to hold my hand when we go through the floo?” He asked quietly. “I remember it used to make me feel a little dizzy - still does, if I’m being honest.”
The problem was, Scorpius reasoned, that his papa had not been very good at choosing a partner so far; of course, his mummy had been fantastic, that was a given. It just seemed to Scorpius that ever since his papa had started thinking about dating again he had been making bad choices. He wouldn’t even entertain the thought of going out with Harry Potter, who Scorpius had come to adore. Scorpius had also been forbidden from bringing up the mysterious letter writer after he burst in during his papa and that awful lady’s date. Really, it left Scorpius with exactly one option - he would go to the meeting with the man and befriend him, then convince his father to do the same. He wouldn’t even mind if they wanted to kiss (well, it was gross, but he wouldn't tell
Draco took a deep breath, trying to stave off a panic attack. Scorpius was somewhere out in the wizarding world alone, and there were terrible people out there, Draco knew exactly how terrible from personal experience, and there was nothing between them and Scorpius.
It was probably the two glasses of wine combined with a significant amount of cocktail that made Draco brave. He leaned conspiratorially toward Harry. “Do I ever.”
“He wants to meet us-”
“Nooo...I promised my friend Rosie I’d stay awake till midnight.”
Harry grins. “Well, yeah, I think we could be.”
The two Queen songs mentioned are You Take My Breath Away and, of course, Bohemian Rhapsody. This isn’t a fic about Queen, per say, but they make more than one appearance.
“If it’s all the same to you, I’d like to say the words out loud.”
Harry does not mean to stalk Draco Malfoy around St. Mungo’s.
“Not the faithful companion you had hoped?”
“No thanks.” Harry muttered, flicking off the wireless. His whole body felt charged and jumpy, as though he was waiting for something to happen, an excitement he hadn’t felt for someone in a long time building in his chest.
“Let’s go find the food table.” As the father of two and uncle of plenty more, Ron was now adept at sensing and interrupting an impending argument. He put an arm around Hermione’s waist, the other around Harry’s shoulders, and steered them toward a table laden with all manner of delectable-looking treats.
“You cannot.”
“He’s not here, Draco. What’s wrong?” Hermione asked, getting up from the table in the adjoining dining room.
.” Daphne says appreciatively. “I wish I could stick around to see why he’s been staring at you for the past twenty minutes, but I’ve got to dash.” She kisses Draco on the cheek and is gone before he can protest.
Esme smiled - she had a very pretty smile - and shook her head. “Please don’t apologise for being a caring father, it’s a rather appealing quality.”
“A wizard?”
“Wouldn’t date a muggle?” There is a slight shift in Potter's tone, an almost imperceptible edge.
“He was at Daphne and Blaise’s but he’s disappeared.” Draco said, barely able to get the words out. “No one knows when, or how - we think the floo? But we don’t know where he went.”
“Pleased to meet your Mrs. Weasley.” He said, offering her his hand which she bypassed in favour of wrapping her arms around his shoulders.
He actually seems quite popular as well - one of the witches in the group reaches over to deliver a gentle slap to the back of his head and another throws her arm about his shoulders. All of them are laughing, and it’s a different sort than Malfoy’s laughter was in school, lighthearted and friendly in a way that completely transforms his face. Harry finds himself stepping into the shadow of a cabinet to watch as Malfoy makes a sweeping gesture with his hand and unfurls the parchment, though Harry is unwittingly far more focused on the way his lips curve into a smile and the pleased flush on his cheeks.
“This isn’t the first time, mate.” Ron said, sitting heavily beside Harry on the couch. “This lager was paid for by one of our Harry-bets.”
“It’s quite alright.” Draco can’t help but be charmed by Sayeda’s enthusiasm. “I was in Slytherin. Yes, I played Quidditch against Harry and -” he leans in conspiratorially “- I beat him at it a couple of times.”
In the twelve years since their first hesitant conversations Andromeda had become the aunt Harry wished Petunia could have been, and his occasional care of Teddy had made Harry realize that whatever else he did in life, he wanted to take care of children. Moving the pair of them in Grimmauld seemed like a good start.
Draco withdrew, his body moving out of the intimate, charged space they had created. “Well” he said, throwing back the rest of his wine. His voice had gone all formal and polite. “I do hope you succeed. If you’ll excuse me it’s quite late and I think I should head home.”
Scorpius made sure to keep his eye on the family as they made their way through the village, though he almost got left behind a couple of times when his attention was drawn to something else. The hardest thing to ignore was Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, which had opened a shop in the village with displays designed to captivate children. Presently, their windows were filled with fireworks that exploded over and over above a display of their most popular products. Scorpius stopped for a moment to stare as a bright pinwheel whizzed behind the glass then exploded into the shape of a phoenix, before he remembered his mission and ran to catch up.
Somehow they end up buying muggle street food, though Draco isn’t sure how Harry manages to transfigure his desire for a proper meal into takeout.  They wander through a busy market, Harry eating a kebab as he weaves expertly through the crowd, occasionally stopping to look at something that catches his eye, and Draco trying to consume a hotdog without dropping ketchup on his shirt. It’s silly and a little overwhelming, but he enjoys himself nonetheless.
“It’s addressed to Sleepless in Shoreditch - probably another admirer of your father’s” Pansy said, working one long, deep purple nail under the wax seal so she could open it.
Scorpius glanced over at Rosie, who was trying to tell Ron a story that seemed to have no discernible plot. “I always hold papa's hand. Does Rosie hold someone's hand?” He asked quietly.
“Malfoy?” Harry asked, though he didn’t sound upset.
“That’s weird” Scorpius said. “Why would you do that?”
“Even adults?” Scorpius asked, and giggled quietly at Harry’s solemn nod. “What’s your name? Rosie said she has lots of uncles and aunties.”
“Hi Malfoy.” He says, a little uncertainly.
“Ernest and I broke up.”
Draco nearly choked - Hermione had told him to pop by around two and collect Scorpius, mentioning that if Draco arrived before them he should make himself at home. He had been to the Nook before, of course, taking Scorpius for play dates and getting swept up in conversation with Hermione that lasted through several cups of tea. The last thing Draco expected, however, was to see his son stepping out of the floo hand in hand with Harry Potter, the pair of them laughing as though they were best friends. It evoked several emotions at once, a distinct longing being chief among them - briefly he imagined the three of them as a unit, Draco, Scorpius, and Harry. In that flash of fantasyhe could see birthdays and holidays, family dinners, a partnership. His second biggest emotion was frustration - why was it the only person Scorpius seemed to like and approve of had rejected Draco so soundly?
Hermione smiled kindly at him. “Sure, Ron and I have worked through disagreements, but in  the end we both wanted the same things fundamental things. Even if I needed a bit of planning and discussion before we had children, I wasn’t closed to the idea. Though I did tell Ron that if he wants a third he will have to carry it himself. I don’t know how Molly did it six times.”
“Listen Harry, I wanted to offer you my robes for the wedding.” He said, his ears going slightly pink the way Ron’s did when he was embarrassed. “It’s traditional for a wizard to wear his father’s robes, and seeing as you don’t have those I thought I would offer. All of my boys have been married in them, it only seems fitting that you would be as well.”
Pansy mutters something about wine snobs under her breath as Daphne launches back into her story about a recent date gone awry.
Draco sighed. “No Scorpius, I never hated them, but things were complicated by a lot more than inter-house rivalries when I went to Hogwarts.”
It was both endearing and slightly irritating that Hermione knew him so well. Harry sighed and rubbed a hand over his face. “I just worry that somehow I am fundamentally flawed. That there’s a reason none of my relationships work out. Anthony is perfect and I couldn’t even give up one thing to make him stay.”
Pansy chokes on her gimlette and begins to cough.
“That’s 5-0 in my favour!” Draco looks around at the other patrons for support, but as it’s mid-afternoon on a Monday most of them are regulars who have no interest in table football. “That means I get to pick what we do tonight.”
Jólasveinarnir =  Icelandic Christmas folklore depicts mountain-dwelling characters and monsters who come to town during Christmas.
“Yeah, one of those on her arm, and eventually we found out she’d been involved in a protest in muggle London against those muggles who hate people based on the colour of their skin.”
“Quite frankly, no.” Draco says, holding up a hand to stop Potter's next words. “And not for the reasons you’re thinking. I believe I would be rather more of a danger to any muggle than most wizards, given my family and background.”
“Maybe he had to have a drink or two, get up the nerve?” Harry read the letter again. “It’s very to the point. Why did I pick such a far off date? Honestly, it’s only just February now. I couldn’t have chosen Valentine’s day?”
“Who’s it from?” Scorpius asked from where he sat at the kitchen island, playing with a large selection of quidditch figurines (if Pansy had looked carefully, she would have seen the Chaser for the Holyhead Harpies, long red plastic braid whipping out behind her as she hovered just above the cutting board, “Wingtips Weasley” emblazoned across her back in gold. But Pansy didn’t look.)
Draco felt himself soften at this - Scorpius was a shy child, doubly so around anyone older than twelve. “He doesn’t warm up to many adults.”
“Hi.” Scorpius said quietly.
“See you there!” Rose called out as they disappeared.
walk around Diagon Alley - it might not have been possible ten years ago, but he has worked hard to redeem himself, donated and volunteered and been as up front as possible about his mistakes. He’s pleased to say that these days he’s relatively anonymous, a hard-earned distinction his younger self would have loathed.
“A partner who wants to help raise S- my son while respecting his mother’s memory. A person who will forgive my ridiculously expensive tastes and find my eccentricities endearing. I want to look into their eyes and see home.”
“Fair enough.” Harry glanced at Draco and began to say something just as a loud chime sounded from downstairs.
Hermione gave him a sarcastic look. “Oh truly? Because you’re sitting in your least favourite chair, Harry, and I can see you’ve been drinking off-brand lager. I’ve been with you through enough breakups to know when you’re not doing fine and are, in fact, punishing yourself.”
Harry felt a funny twinge of insecurity in his chest at this, but he pushed it down. “And now you’ve been married for  -”
“My papa says not to give my name to strangers.”
Draco often prided himself on being composed; although he had softened since becoming a father, he was still adept at navigating the social and business worlds with a careful distance. But something rose up inside his chest, a squirming teenage crush he had been sure was gone forever. The feeling crashed over him as the trio made their way forward, Hermione’s hands outstretched to envelope his in a warm squeeze.
“I suppose you’re right I - you’ve placed bets on me?”
He’s rewarded with an embarrassed smile and again, there’s that odd feeling in his stomach when their eyes meet that causes Draco to deliver a stern internal admonition to himself.
Draco, who had his gay awakening thanks in part to the way Potter looked in his Quidditch uniform, splutters indignantly for a moment at the sudden change of topic. “Yes, I suppose. Sort of.”
“Tonight we’re talking about Yule wishes. Do you have your heart set on something? Have you been hoping for your dreams to come true? Call in now, we’re listening.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ernie MacMillan!” Says a voice that is far too close and recognisable. “Sorry to interrupt, I thought that was you and wanted to say hello. It’s been yonks hasn’t it?”
“Often. But not even Astoria could coax any back to the manor, so I’ve gotten used to doing things myself. Anyway, it doesn’t make much sense when it’s just the two of us.”
“I recall, you’ve mentioned that several times.” The problem was that Draco didn’t mind hearing it; he kept replaying his own brief conversation with Harry. They hadn’t had a chance to speak again at the party - Harry had spent a surprisingly long amount of time talking to Pansy before Weasley and a very tipsy Hermione appeared at his elbow. The three of them had departed with a quick thank you to Draco, and though their parting handshake had left Draco feeling quite a lot more inebriated than he had any right to be considering his low alcohol intake, it had not been meaningful enough to be suggestive. Add that to undeniable factor of Anthony Goldstein and Draco felt altogether far more foolish than he would have liked, and about as helpless to stifle his crush as he had been in school.
“What was it?”
6:16:pm: Tell me, Harry, is your spelling always this atrocious
“Oh sure, great idea, pull his dad into the conversation.” Harry muttered, though he did not change the station.
“It’s from France!” Chorused Pansy and Scorpius together, the latter dissolving into giggles.
Hugo babbled up at him, his chubby brown cheeks dotted lightly with freckles, hazel eyes searching Harry’s face for a moment before he broke into a smile that nearly struck Harry dead on the spot.
It was too much. Draco had to look away, trying and failing to disguise the sadness of his face. He was aware of Hermione’s scrutinizing gaze and knew he would have to endure a gentle interrogation at some point in the future, but for now all he wanted to do was go home and drink a steadying cup of tea.
Draco's coffees with Hermione had turned into a weekly date at the funny little cafe, the two of them meeting up after drop-off to chat over whatever strange coffee drink she could convince Draco to try. The novelty of sitting across from a person he had spent most of his childhood loathing and insulting had not yet faded for Draco. She had let him go through a heartfelt apology and self-flagellation once, then told him that would be quite enough. Despite this, Draco couldn't quite believe that Granger was now Hermione, and the girl he had called a mudblood was now a woman he called his friend.
Draco has always planned things out well in advance of their occurrence, it is how he had convinced himself at eleven that Harry Potter would be his best friend (playing on the same Quidditch Team, going to Hogsmeade together, being the two most popular boys in their year). Given the deeply disappointing result of that particular fantasy he has attempted to curb this tendency in adulthood, but occasionally allows himself to indulge - a man has to have some idea of what he wants, after all.
“So, the wireless?”
“Accio Christmas, Christmas come to meeee-”
Professor Mentis laughed. “Or wizards. Have you dated anyone since?”
Three days after Harry’s visit, at the exact moment (though neither could have known) when Harry and Anthony were breaking up, Hugo Granger-Weasley found the ball of parchment while crawling around on the living room rug. One year old Hugo had a taste for paper of all kinds, so he picked it up and waved it around at his father, excitedly yelling “Da! Da! Da!” until Ron came to see what his son had discovered.
“Come on, we’ll be friends. I didn’t know anyone either, when I started, and you’re too small to be left alone.” She said, pulling him with her into the circle of children that had begun to form on the rug in front of their teacher.
“You’re one to talk.” Though she had never come out and said it, they both knew that Pansy had little interest in sex. She enjoyed a solid flirtation, but she hadn’t found a man who wouldn’t eventually try to sleep with her or understood her needs.
“Hello, this is Professor Mentis.”
“Hey!” Harry cried, bolting upright so fast he spilled beer down his front. Ron turned his laugh into a cough and spelled away the mess with the practiced hand of a parent.
“To Harry?”
“This is a wizard from Islington who breeds crups.” Pansy suggested, holding up a lavishly green piece of parchment.
“You can’t be smitten with someone you’ve never met.” Draco said tartly.
“Precisely. And why is that?”
Unfortunately, Ernest is no mind reader and in one fell swoop he grabs Draco’s upper arm and twirls him around to face Potter. “You remember Draco Malfoy, don’t you?”
Again, the Professor interrupted. “What about you? Do you think maybe you need someone as much as your son does?”
Invasive questions aside, Draco does, in fact, have a very good idea of how he would like the future to unfold. He has imagined them living in Ernest’s flat, a bright second story on the newly popular Gryphen’s row in Mayfair’s hidden magical subsection. They will make love in Ernest’s enormous king-size bed, eat meals together in the cheery dining room; Draco will study for school while Ernest works on his latest case. After some time, they will get a kneazle, have dinner parties where their Slytherin and Hufflepuff friends commingle with ease.
There was another pause. “Shoreditch.”
“Mary, can you summon Healer Lark? I suspect it’s a badly done hex. Gil, help me get her to a chair please. Kass, could you start the paperwork to admit her to spell damage?”
“How boring.” Pansy emptied the glass, and a second later it had refilled itself.
Once they reached the entrance, Scorpius set out on his own - he knew Pax Gardens well, as Draco loved the winding paths and seemed to be especially fond of the fountain at its center. The letter had not been clear about what time the man would be meeting them, but twilight was beginning to fall and Scorpius felt sure it would be soon. He had said before the fireworks, and fireworks happened when it got dark. He picked a bench facing the fountain and settled in to wait.
“They only have one more than regular dogs. And they get the second tail removed anyway.” Pansy pointed out, poking Scorpius in the side to make him giggle.
Pansy threw back the rest of her Cauldron Mishap (the bar’s signature cocktail) and handed him the empty glass. “Go on, I can make my own way home if need be.”
After several moments, Draco becomes aware that his boyfriend’s attention has been diverted away from him and they break apart.
“What does yours say, Scorp?” Pansy asked, leaning over to see the letter.
“By age one most children have learned what the word no means.” Hermione, satisfied with Rose’s hair, turned to Harry. “He’s right on target for his developmental milestones too, aren’t you Hugo?” She chucked him under the chin and glanced up at Harry. “Do you want me to take him when we go through the floo?”
Anthony gave him a playful shove as though Harry was joking. “Alright, I think I can handle that.”
“Neither of us is in a place for that at the moment - besides, we’ve only been seeing each other for a few months.”
“How’re you holding up, Tony?” Hermione asked kindly from his other side. She and Anthony worked together at the ministry and had been friends for years. “Don’t let them scare you off, they mean well. For the most part.”
“Finding a new seat. Please do not follow me.” Draco turns to make his way down the aisle.
“Aunt Pansy.” The serious little face lit up. “Did you go to school with my aunts and papa?”
There are a few moments of silence while they sit, lost in their own private thoughts. It’s not as awkward as Draco might have imagined, perhaps even companionable.
feelings, they’re just sexual frustration wearing a romantic disguise. He needs to pull, not hit on his new friend. Unfortunately he has given up every free night this week to see Harry, so opportunities for any other socialization have been non-existent. Draco makes a promise that he will, at the very least, have a decent wank this evening and then attempt to make a plan with some of the friends he only seems to see when they are all single and need company for the gay bar.
“Were you really at Hogwarts? What house were you in? Gryffindor like Harry? Did you play Quidditch?”
“Don’t tease him, Harry, he might be a child but it’s unkind-”
A Day at the Races
“Of course he’s not alright” Pansy answers before Draco can speak “They were together for five years, a person does not just break up with their live-in partner of five years and come out of it unscathed.”
Hermione shrugged. “You know we bet on everything. You’ve participated in many of them.”
“Racists.” Harry supplies, being doubly familiar with them having grown up in the Durlsey household.
“It can’t be almost midnight!” Draco cried, gesturing for Harry and Pansy to follow as he made his way back to the party.
Harry laughed at the idea, though privately he thought it likely wasn’t as much of a deterrent to Ron as Hermione hoped - he had been angling for a third child “to round things out” since Hugo’s fifth month.
“Is this your son?” She asked, then laughed “Sorry, of course he is, the hair is as much a giveaway as Rosie’s. Can’t escape those Weasley genes.”
“Freddie is her cousin - George and Angelina’s son.” Hermione explained, before turning to Scorpius. “I don’t think we’ve been introduced.”
“Didn’t I?” Harry tried to recall whether or not this was true.
“I appreciate it, but I’m fine.” He lied.
Anthony squeezed his hand. “This is about more than that, Harry. You adore children, I’ve seen you with Rosie and Hugo, with Teddy - hell, with babies we run into doing the weekly shopping. You want to be a parent. But I don’t, I never have. I love you enough to know that it’s an unkindness to ask that you give up your dream. Just as, I hope, you love me enough to feel the same.”
Ron and Hermione shared a look. “Whether or not you’d say yes to Ernie Macmillan when he asked you out on Valentine’s day.” Ron said eventually.
Once he had extracted himself, giggling, from Rose’s grip, the small boy made his way over to Harry and leaned in to whisper something. Draco watched as Harry bent down to listen, nodded, and enveloped his son in a hug.
“No. Maybe.” Harry reached for the beer again, and Ron passed it back to him. “I’ve always wanted to be a dad. I love being an uncle and godfather, getting ugly kid art, and I don’t even mind changing diapers. I want to read someone to sleep every night and cook them breakfast on Sundays and watch them grow up. The fact that Anthony doesn’t...I don’t know what to do about that.”
Ligligan Parul Sampernandu = an annual festival held in mid-December in the City of San Fernando in the Philippines. The festival features a competition of giant lanterns.
“Children under the age of ten are not supposed to apparate unless under dire circumstance” came a haughty, familiar voice from behind them. Hearing it now, Harry wondered how he hadn’t recognised it all those months ago on the wireless. Taking a deep breath, he turned around.
“Hands off Potter.” Pansy said, thought Draco noticed she wasn’t trying very hard to get away. “Draco would be most upset if you put the moves on me.”
The man croons, the guitar fades out, and Sirius throws back the rest of his mead, then pours himself another glass.
It took three months for Draco to enter the master bedroom again, and even still, he couldn’t bring himself to sleep in their bed. When Astoria moved into the manor she had made it home not just for herself, but for Draco as well.
“But who could just as easily leave you for another woman?” Draco’s ability to be delicate had dropped out of the fight several minutes previously. “Just because my options for dating are broader than yours does not mean I am any less devoted to my partners.”
“How could you?” He wishes desperately that Potter would leave him to his speech.
“Ba!” Hugo giggled, clutching a handful of Harry’s shirt and smacking him soundly in the nose with the other hand.
“I know for a fact that Rosie won’t be staying up till midnight.” Harry told him.
“That’s right. And here’s Rule Number Two - you and I are a great family all on our own. Although sometimes Aunt Pansy is there too.” He leaned forward to envelope Scorpius in a hug, tightening his arms around the small boy.
The front door closed.
They’re at Paddington station, Draco about to board a train that will begin his journey to Cardiff for a healer’s conference. Ernest has tried to dissuade him from taking muggle transportation, but Draco has always loved trains and the journey is short enough to be pleasant but not tedious.
“He’s not, those two witches are together. He’s clearly a third wheel. I bet he’d love it if you talked to him when you went to refill my drink.”
Potter shakes his head. “Nah, I thought I would, once, but last year gave me a taste of it and I don’t think I’m really cut out for the job. To be honest, the idea makes me feel a little ill.”
The boy nodded. “I only have two aunties, though, and no uncles.”
“I bet it’s not.” Potter’s voice is sincere and low, his expression kind. It might be this fact alone (when will Potter ever look at him in such a friendly manner again?) that prompts Draco to continue.
Harry looked at the letter in his hand, then crumpled it into a ball and tossed it into the wastebasket across the room so he could turn into the hug. “Thanks Mione.” He said against her shoulder. “I think you’re right, I need to talk to Anthony.”
Rosie had gone over the day with Scorpius so many times that it had become a mantra to him “Floo to the Three Broomsticks, find a family, follow them to the garden.” Rosie said that the festival was huge and Hogsmeade would be busy so it shouldn’t be too difficult a task. Scorpius wasn’t sure how she knew so much, but he was not about to question it. He believed in Rosie the way some muggles believed in their religious leaders, a similar devotion and reverence for whatever guidance she could offer. Scorpius would grow out of it, eventually, and they would find a more equal footing in their friendship. For now, he did as she said.
“Fran, Amani, it’s been too long.” He raises to shake their hands. “Are you enjoying Hampstead and the new home?”
“Ask him when he gets here. I think there are more important points though: 1. Are you going to meet him and 2. Are you sure you want to date someone whose handwriting looks like a seven year old’s?
“Gross.” Scorpius said. “I don’t want that person to be papa’s partner.”
He had re-ignited his acquaintance with Astoria at one of Pansy’s Slytherin Gatherings, then spent an entire year courting her and convincing her family to accept his proposal before they were finally engaged. It took another year for them to marry, but from the day she moved in to the manor Astoria had been waving her wand and setting things to rights. The pallor of despair that had settled over its many rooms following Voldemort’s occupation began to fade in the face of the diminutive witch; the dark, foreboding atmosphere had been transmuted by her love of plants and music, her laughter.  When they found out (a mere month into their marriage) that they were going to have a child, they had fun picking out his room, collecting furniture and decorating, climbing high into their respective family trees to see who could suggest the worst ancestral name for their son:
Draco gently moved Scorpius backward until they could look into each others’ eyes. “You’ve never been this upset about staying at Pansy’s before. You’ve practically begged to in the past, if I recall.”
Harry stopped in his tracks; the boy looked so like Malfoy he felt as though he had fallen back in time. But then a sweet smile spread across the child’s pale face, and his mother’s genetic influence became suddenly apparent.
They landed just outside the perimeter of the Burrow and stepped through the wards, which easily admitted them. The front door flew open to reveal Molly Weasley’s smiling face.
Stupid. Foolish, pathetic, laughable. He was all those things, and more, though his brain was not quite sober enough to come up with additional synonyms. Draco sank onto the couch in his living room, trying to reckon with the past hour. First he had chatted Potter up, then practically thrown himself at the man, only to be rebuffed. Of course he had been. Potter likely had not forgotten who Draco was, what he had been. And Draco had been foolish enough to think, for a moment, that there was a connection between them - not only in the bar, but at his New Year’s party as well. He had been sure there was something lingering there, waiting to be encouraged. But Potter’s not-so-subtle rejection stung more than he could have anticipated and his subsequent reaction had been nothing short of mortifying.
“Professor Mentis, from the Mind Healing Hour. We’ve been talking to your son, he’s very concerned about you.”
Harry laughed. “Sad state of affairs, isn’t it?.”
Instead, Harry stole pancakes straight from the griddle when Molly wasn’t looking, helped Arthur re-program the new cellular telephone he had received for Christmas and set about building a long train track that ran directly through the chaos with Rose, Scorpius, Fred, and Roxanne. Scorpius stuck very close to Harry, never more than a couple of feet away from him; when they sat down to eat, he pulled his chair close and let Harry fill his plate, answering questions in a quiet voice about what he wanted. Rose sat on Scorpius’ other side and talked animatedly at George, forgetting about her friend at times in her enthusiastic re-telling of what Harry thought must be a dream.
Scorpius shook his head. “Papa, why can’t you just meet the wizard from the letters like you’re supposed to? Why do you have to see this lady instead?”
“He’s a Gryffindor but you don’t mind, do you papa? You don’t hate Gryffindors anymore right?”
Pansy looked hurt. “That’s not what I meant and you know it.”
“Mine too!” Scorpius looked up at Harry as though assessing him. “Are you married?”
“Do you think you could ever feel that for someone else?”
“It’s okay Scorpius, I know, Rose told us everything.”
“Harry helped me too.” Scorpius said, turning out of his father’s embrace to smile at the other man. “He told me how he didn’t have a family growing up and the Weasleys became his family. It’s like how we made our family, you and me and Aunt Pansy.”
Draco wasn’t the only one who couldn’t stop thinking about Harry - Scorpius was preoccupied with their brief encounter well into the evening of the next day, talking incessantly about the man.
“Well.” Harry gulped, trying to get a hold of himself. “That’s news.”
“Malfoy?”
“No, it's okay, they're very open about adoption. ‘Yeda was orphaned at a young age.” Harry explains as they begin to walk again. “Her parents were muggles and she was in muggle care for her early years - she was my first kid right out of school. It was difficult finding her a family because we didn’t have a lot of magical people who wanted to adopt, and we try to put children in homes with at least one parent who has a similar racial or cultural identity. But then Fran and Amani came along - she’s a professor at the Hemlock Collegiate and he works on magical human rights issues. They met in America and moved back here to be close to Amani’s family - his parents actually came from a town close to where Sayeda’s mum grew up. They’re older and they were usually more of a temporary home for children, but when they met Sayeda we all knew they were meant to be a family.”
“What’s a one night stand?” Scorpius asked.
“Exactly. Do you see any red glows?”
“Do you think papa will get married again?” Draco heard Scorpius whisper to Pansy when he had turned his back on them to stir the marinara sauce.
“It will not be with Ernie!”
Potter’s face lights up in a way Draco has never imagined it could in his presence.
“I don’t know about famous, these days. But yes, I’m very busy with work.”
Scorpius loved Rosie with the devout solemnity of a disciple combined with a very real need to prove himself worthy. Rosie had practically rescued him from social isolation at school and was the first friend he had ever made on his own (cousins didn’t count). If anyone knew what to do, it would be her.
Harry grinned “There was the added complication that I’d heard this bloke on the wireless and I was embarrassingly smitten with him.”
The child nodded, though Harry could see slight hesitation on the small, pointed face. “Rosie said there will be lots of people.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sure enough, she appeared in the doorway seconds later, an assortment of dishes following behind her like ducklings.
Oh no.
“Harry, listen.” Dean puts a hand on his shoulder. “If you can’t tell that your wife has packed up all her belongings and is getting ready to move out, maybe that’s a sign you’re having problems in your marriage.”
“You know her name’s Ginny.” Hermione admonished gently. “Anyway, I think Luna would have something to say about that as they’ve been married for three years.”
“Me too!” Scorpius cried, grining. “But Papa says it’s too sticky - he keeps some in the cupboard for me, though. He’s nice like that. Mummy liked jam too, her favourite was strawberry.”
“The singer, Freddie Mercury, he died when I was still in Azkaban from...a muggle illness called AIDS.” Sirius looks at Harry carefully, as though for a flicker of understanding or recognition. Finding none, he relaxes. “Remus saved all my albums, and any of your mum’s he could recover. Lily would have wanted you to hear them, she was always singing Bohemian Rhapsody, dancing you around the flat.”
“How fortunate that he turned out to be you, then.” Harry replied, and he was close enough now to reach his other hand out to Draco. “If you’re interested, that is?”
Draco doesn’t want to admit that this is exactly how he feels as well, though he does rather wish there were a trolly of magical sweets to roll past and distract Potter.
“Good lad.” Draco knew his paranoia was likely unfounded - Pansy certainly seemed to think so.
“We should get going, Scorpius.” He said quietly.
“Damn, my meeting with the minister has been moved up and I’m about to be late!” She said, shooting out of her seat so fast she nearly upended her drink. “Sorry to run out on you, Draco, but it took me forever to get this meeting with Kingsley in the first place.”
Harry had no such obligations, so once he was sure the other man was asleep, he padded downstairs to the living room.
“This is Draco Malfoy, Rose. He was in the same year as daddy, Uncle Harry, and I at Hogwarts.”
“A healer’s conference.”
“He’s moved on awfully fast.” Ron said, sliding in beside him.
Once she leaves, Potter appears to decide that their former topic of conversation is too fraught, because he veers wildly toward another. “What are you hoping to do, once you’ve got your N.E.W.T results?”
“Yes.” Harry breathed, then ducked his head in embarrassment. What was he doing?
“Couldn’t have said something earlier then?” Harry gumbled into his pint glass.
Harry follows. He doesn’t mean to, only his feet make the decision ahead of his brain and by the time he realises what is happening he’s already crossed the atrium and gone down the corridor after them. Fortunately, he is never far from his invisibility cloak, which he pulls from his side bag where it is nestled between a large book on trauma guided practice and his overstuffed school notebook. Seconds later, and completely invisible, he rounds the corner and comes almost face to face with Malfoy. Harry’s heart thuds uncomfortably in his chest, but Malfoy’s gaze goes straight through him to the board on the wall behind, which lists attending healers, then back to a pale-faced witch who appears to be bleeding from one eye.
They exit via Whitehall Gardens, walking along the Thames in near silence. Around them, Muggles crowd the streets - tourists, Draco realises, chuffed that he has been able to put his Muggle Studies N.E.W.T to use already. Potter surprises him by leading them to a café set just off the road on the edge of a large garden, nicer than anything Draco had anticipated. They choose a table on a terrace in the back, shaded by trees and sparsely populated, but not a word is exchanged between them till they’ve ordered.
Malfoy nodded. “I hope some day the Manor will be that, if not for me then for my son.”
“That kneazle hates you with its entire heart.” Pansy counters, poking one of her long nails vengefully into his side.
Harry almost didn’t make the meeting. That evening, following two days of indecisiveness, he had gone to Hermione and Ron’s house where he ended up recounting the entire tale of his run-in with Draco. Technically it had begun with just Ron, but Hermione had gotten home about halfway through the second re-telling (Ron wanted to make sure he understood every nuance of conversation) and Harry felt foolish about hiding it from her, especially because there were no secrets between the three of them. Also, he suspected Ron was getting far too much entertainment from it all.
“Charles Selwyn” Draco finishes for her “You set us up six years ago, Daph, and it didn’t work out terribly well.”
“Hello boys!” She cried, enveloping Harry in a tight hug before she turned to Anthony.
“When’s the wedding?” George asked, his mouth half full of bread.
“I don’t you going on a date with some lady.” Scorpius said, producing the letter from his pocket. “I want you to go meet this one.”
“Co-head - Dean and I were the first people to complete the program so it was essentially by default. Before this, the DMLE took on any reports of orphans or child abuse, but they’re not very well trained in the matter and quite frankly did more harm than good. What is essentially lacking from the magical world is any sort of understanding of intersectionality. There’s next to no social support, just utter death on one end and the Janus Thickney ward on the other.” Potter stops, grins awkwardly. “Sorry, I’m pretty passionate about this but I don’t mean to talk your ear off.”
When Scorpius shook his head, she gently grabbed his arm, tugging him out of the office and back down to the kitchen for another round of planning.
Harry sighed and grabbed Ron's beer, taking a heavy gulp. “Anthony is a good man. I’m going to marry him, I just need to get this out of my system. Maybe I’m losing my mind.”
“Let’s get something to eat."
“Well then, I’d be honoured to continue the tradition.” He said, putting a hand on Arthur’s shoulder.
“Listen, Draco-” Harry began just as the rest of the Weasley-Granger family tumbled out of the fireplace: Rose, Ron and Hugo, then finally Hermione in quick succession.
“Dear Sleepless & Son.” Pansy did roll her eyes this time. “I am not normally the kind of wizard who listens to WWN’s floo-in mind healing show, but I happened to catch your episode on Christmas Eve. After hearing your story the other night, I couldn’t help but feel compelled to write.”
Scorpius shrugged his shoulders noncommittally.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to pry.” He said after a moment.
“I know.” Hermione smiled. “That’s one of the reasons I forgave you. I don’t think you spent much time after fourth year being anything but terrified for most of your waking moments.”
Harry winced - he had quite vivid memories of a very inebriated Ron swinging Hermione around the room at breakneck speed. It would have been hilarious had Harry not spent the subsequent half hour cleaning Ron’s vomit and feeding him sobering potions so he could consensually engage in his wedding night.
Even though he hadn’t seen Potter in twelve years, Draco’s chest tightened slightly, surprising him with the reaction a mere mention had conjured.
A year has done wonders for Potter: his hair is trimmed close to his head and he has grown himself a beard. It has the slightly patchy look common in teenage facial hair, but suits his face tremendously well. His skin has the healthy look of someone who has spent a considerable amount of time outside, and Draco wonders if the rumours of his sabbatical in Spain might hold some weight afterall.
“Well that’s sorted.” Rosie said. “Have you thought about how you’re going to convince your papa to go to the festival?”
“That’s too far away!” Scorpius whined through a large yawn. “How old were you when you got to stay up till midnight, Harry?”
“But Harry didn’t think that?”
“Are you hoping to change his mind?” Draco asked
“Yes please!” Scorpius squealed, launching himself toward the pile.
“And you broke up with Ernest.”
“I know it’s serious!” Rose yelled, stomping her foot. “I’ve been trying to tell you, I know where Scorpius is!”
“Okay, just for you Professor, I’ll answer. Love means finding someone who fits. Someone who can see past my faults without turning a blind eye.”
“Why are you on the train?”
“It depends on how she’s feeling. It’s okay to need support sometimes, though, it doesn’t mean you’ll always need it.” This was something he told the kids in his classes when they were frustrated that they couldn’t cast a spell without his help.
“Hello?” The voice was pleasant and slightly aristocratic. Harry’s heart sped up a little, though he wasn’t sure why.
Harry watched Malfoy’s interactions with Hermione and Ron carefully for any hint of malice or ulterior motive, but found none. Instead, there were only hints of the snotty boy Harry had known, interspersed with some very real glimpses of the man he had become.
had held them for the first time.
“He’s practically married, Pans.” Draco said quickly, noting that Harry looked particularly amused by her comment. “To Anthony Goldstein.”
“Don’t be ridiculous.” Hermione crossed one leg over the other and leaned forward to give him an appraising look. “I think you should go meet this man, and not just because Ron will owe me three galleons if I’m right about him. You need to let go of the fantasy that you’ve built up if you’re ever going to find someone; if you don’t go, you’ll always wonder what could have been. If you’re going to ask Draco out he deserves your full attention...and while we’re on the subject,you need to actually ask what he’s looking for instead of being a prat and assuming.”
“Always test them first.” Scorpius sniffed, leaning back into his father’s comforting touch.
“No!” Scorpius shouted, shrugging off Draco’s hand. “No! I want you to date the person I want you to date!” He turned around and stormed upstairs - a moment later they heard the door to his room slam shut.
“Scorpius is afraid of crups.”
“The whole being afraid of a good thing, thing. Hermione thought she was giving clear advice, and you thought that advice was ‘compromise everything you want because you’ve found a decent boyfriend’. Hermione and I compromise, but not in a way that makes us fundamentally unhappy. You were unhappy, mate.”
“I don’t have time to discuss this letter writer, Scorpius. It’s impolite to be late.” Draco returned, his nervousness over the date and his irritation at the continuation of these blasted letters rendering his tone sharper than he meant. Scorpius’ lip quivered but he held firm.
The letters began arriving on December 27th; Draco woke up to a parliament of owls in his living room, all clamoring for attention. He made a panicked search for his bag of owl treats while Scorpius solemnly collective each missive.
Draco took a steadying sip of his eggnog latte - he had become quite fond of them since their first initial meeting, though he still preferred strong black tea - then shook his head. “Just surprised, is all. I didn’t know Potter was-”
He is alone at Grimmauld Place, trying to distract himself from the heady fog of grief that never seems to dissipate. He’s digging through a cupboard when he finds several dusty crates of albums he vaguely remembers tucking away during his time on the run with Hermione and Ron. It takes him only a little time to figure out how to set the player up in the kitchen, a mug of strong tea at his side.
“Yes. Your son called our show to let us know that his Yule wish is for you to find love.”
“Me neither.” Draco ended the spell. “You may open them. I’m going to start breakfast, do you fancy a fry-up?”
to Sirius and Remus as boys - Harry knows there is a significance he isn’t quite understanding.
“He doesn’t have one now, that’s why I’m calling.”
“You’re so sad, though.” Scorpius said mournfully, reaching out a small hand to pat Draco’s chest. “Your heart broke.”
Draco looked: a man sat at the bar beside a long tank of tropical fish with his back to them. He had dark, messy hair and broad shoulders, nursing a pint of beer as he made idle conversation with the witch next to him.
“I’m not teasing anyone.” Harry took another step toward him, reaching out to take Scorpius’ hand.
“Wait!” Scorpius cried, dropping the snitch he had been holding. “Papa says you have to do the spells first.”
“-And I don’t want to be invasive.”
Notes:
Harry let Scorpius down and the child slowly made his way over to Draco. He looked pitiful, face tear-streaked and eyes red. Draco could see he had been crying for quite some time, and his stern resolve broke at once. He closed the distance between them and scooped Scorpius into a tight hug, picking him up off the ground. “What’s rule number two, Scorpius? What is it?” He demanded, barely able to keep the emotion from his voice.
“Scorpius!” He said, diverting his attention to the monster of a child who had wrung his heart so terribly over the past hour.
“Uh huh! Are you going to go to the carnival, Harry?”
“I’m just fortunate that anyone thinks I am redeemable.” Draco said honestly, taking another sip of his latte.
“I should think the plus side of breaking up with Ernest is never having to see that little monster again.” Pansy says.
Sure enough, the New Year spell had been activated and a giant, luminous clock was floating over the mantlepiece counting down the last minute of the year.
“One who isn’t going to leave me for a man.”
Their eyes met briefly as Malfoy responded and well, that was something else. A feeling he hadn’t known existed stood suddenly upright and demanded attention; Harry was embarrassed to admit he felt slightly weak in the knees from only the brief eye contact. He was so busy trying to convince himself otherwise that it took Harry a moment to realize what Malfoy had said.
“I don’t know, Potter. Why the sudden and overly-familiar interest in my love life?”
Harry chokes on his own laughter.
he thinks, but he doesn’t have time to ruminate on what it might be - Malfoy and the healer lead the witch away, and a glance at the clock on the wall reveals that Harry is about to be very late for class.
“Well, past Draco would have hexed anyone who suggested such a thing. I was terrified of you.” He admitted.
Scorpius nodded. “Yes papa.”
“Do you really want to see Ernest over and over when you meet to exchange Tiberius?” Daphne asks reasonably. Draco doesn’t - he never wants to see Ernest again, in fact - but he’s a little too proud to admit that he’s hurt by the whole ordeal.
The other man sighs, takes a sip of his now cold tea, and makes a face. “No, I knew, but I was pretending it didn’t matter, that we were just in a bad period. She’s Ginny, for Merlin’s sake, she waited for me through the war, she couldn’t wait this out either?”
“She was. Scorpius takes after the best parts of her, I try to remind him of them as often as I can. I know he’s mine in looks, but he’s hers in personality through and through.”
Harry smiled his thanks to her and took another pull on the beer, indulging for a second in the comfort of his family. Arthur had fallen immediately into conversation with Anthony about his half-muggle upbringing, with Rosie listening intently from where she sat in her grandpa’s lap. Molly bustled around putting down plates of food with help from Percy and George. Angelina and Ginny were leaning across the table now to introduce themselves, the latter taking Anthony’s hand in her vice grip to shake it. Ever since they had broken up eleven years ago (coming out to each other in a flurry of laughter and tears) Ginny had been the most ferocious of the Weasleys, interrogating Harry’s dates whenever she got the chance. Harry had never been able to return the favour - it was clear that Ginny and Luna were well suited to each other. They had been together almost since Harry and Ginny had split up and Harry had officiated their wedding (in bright yellow robes he hoped never to see again) three years previous.
It’s the wrong choice- Potter’s face falls - but after a moment he answers quietly. “I’m getting divorced, actually.”
“Listen Harry, I’m not the type to meddle in someone’s love life, you know that. I mean Ron’s the one who reads wizarding romance novels, not me - and don’t you dare tell him I’ve revealed that disturbing secret.”
“And now?” Malfoy asked.
Draco had invited Hermione and assumed that by giving her a +1 on the invitation he was effectively inviting Wealsey and Potter as well, though he doubted very much that the latter would attend. His assumption and subsequent lack of preparation made it all the more surprising when the man in question walked through Draco’s front door amidst a small crowd of guests.
“Keeping an eye on me, are you?” Draco has a can of vimto in his briefcase, and a packet of crisps (all part of his muggle train ritual) but he won’t allow Potter the satisfaction of seeing him consume them, so he gives in and sips from the mug. It’s not entirely Draco’s taste, and there is a slightly unpleasant flavour from the transfigured rubber, but it is hot and he is pleasantly surprised to discover that Potter is not the type to add sugar.
On the one year anniversary of her death, he decided it was no longer bearable. He packed up their essentials, shut the manor, and moved with Scorpius to a townhome in a wizarding area called The Phoenix District, an “up-and-coming area for the modern witch and wizard nestled covertly within the trendy muggle area of Shoreditch” according to their letting agent. It was also home to an “integrative” primary school bringing together wizarding and muggle-born families under a banner of tolerance. Astoria had always been firm in her belief that Scorpius should never know the prejudices of his paternal ancestors and Draco felt that in her absence he would have to soldier on alone with what they had planned.
“No, only an evil madman bent on destroying the world.” Harry retorted, clinking his bottle against Ron’s before taking a much needed drink.
“My mummy did too, but I wasn’t a baby.” Scorpius twisted his napkin in his lap. “Papa is doing a very good job with me, though.”
“Mummy!” Rose said again, tugging on Hermione’s sleeve.
A chime sounded from Hermione’s purse at that moment, and she dug around inside before producing a small, black plastic device with an opaque screen. She tapped the surface and it lit up, revealing text far too small for Draco to read.
“Wait!” Draco commanded in a voice so tinged with panic that he saw tears spring up in his son’s eyes.
And he flicks his wand to turn up the volume.
“I was aware, yes. I meant, why are you out of bed? You’re supposed to be asleep.”
The madman in question is Kingsley Shacklebolt, a wizard mostly undeserving of Harry’s ire. He’s also the one whose box seats they are occupying and whose firewhiskey they are slowly diminishing, but Harry is too preoccupied with self-pity to mind what he says.
“But first-” Professor Mentis cut in “-a discussion on how to deal with New Year stress.”
Scorpius’ eyes flicked over to look at Esme, then back to Draco. “I missed you.” He said, reaching forward to hug Draco tightly.
In this chapter we begin to diverge slightly from the original movie, if only because I got a bit carried away with writing. It comes back to the plot soon.
“Don’t worry, it gets easier every time you drop them off.” Hermione said reassuringly as she saw the expression on Draco’s face. “Rosie has been coming to school here since she was five, and I thought I’d pass out the first time I watched her walk away from me.”
Harry and Dean sit in the stands at the Ilkley Moor Quidditch Stadium, ostensibly watching the Appleby Arrows play the Ballycastle Bats, though in reality they have gotten quite drunk off firewhiskey and are both complaining about their relationships with one Ginny Weasley. Dean has just finished an extended rant about sixth year that skirts around the fact that Harry started dating Ginny quite quickly after she and Dean broke up, and now Harry’s grievances have taken center stage.
“But Papa-”
Luckily, Dean is too absorbed in the game to expect a reply.
When the rock interlude begins, Sirius starts nodding his head rapidly to the music, tangled locks bouncing around his ecstatic face. Harry laughs and imitates him and they head bang in their chairs until they’re both dizzy and out of breath, euphoric in their shared enjoyment.
“I can’t wait!” He exchanges a warm hug with Fran and then Amani before the family walks on down the street. Harry and Draco pause a moment, watching them together, Sayeda between her parents with Fran’s arm still across her shoulders.
Sirius waves a hand and a second snifter floats toward him from down the table; he fills it a quarter of the way and slides it over to Harry. “Your mum got me listening to them, she was mad for their music. Lily was always the first to know about new music and was clever enough that she figured out how to play muggle records at school early on, made all of us listen to their albums over and over. This one came out in our fifth year. Remus and I - this song meant a lot to us.”
Harry had his doubts, but he folded them up and shoved them into the back of his mind where he kept the tiny, nagging worry that he and Anthony were making a mistake getting engaged so early. Hermione had told him a thousand times that he self-sabotaged due to childhood trauma and not believing he deserved anything good. Anthony was something good.
“Yes.” Draco said after a moment. “Your grandfather raised me to believe that muggle borns were not as good as those from long magical lines. He taught me that being pureblood - a term that is considered very rude these days - meant we were superior wizards.”
“He defecated in my shoes. Consistently and with malice.”
His quest brought him to the second floor. In his defense, the toilet on the first had been occupied by a very amorous couple, and so he had slipped upstairs to see if there was another on offer. Not technically proper guest behaviour, but his bladder dictated action. Low and behold, there was one on the upper landing across from two closed doors.
“Potter” He said, a cold edge to his voice that made Scorpius frown. Draco saw this and softened his tone. “Scorpius! You look like you’re having a nice time?”
Potter blinks, as though he is confused by the hostility. “Right, makes sense. There’s something about it that feels like the first day of school all over again.”
“Have you talked to your papa about this?”
“Lovely chat, Potter. I’ll see you around I’m sure.” He wobbled slightly as he turned but no limbs were left behind in his wake, so Harry had to assume he’s apparated safely home.
Narcissa and Lucius had moved abroad following the latter’s release from Azkaban, leaving the palatial family home empty and cold in their wake and a twenty-two year old Draco at loose ends.
(This laissez-faire attitude combined with Rosie's general aptitude for trouble would elicit many muttered expletives from Professors during her years at Hogwarts)
“And it - no one made a big deal of it?”
This revelation made it difficult for Draco to meet her eyes. He felt all of eleven again, his hand desperately extended toward Potter. Or seventeen, clinging to his back as the flames leapt towards them. He wanted to be asked after. He wanted Potter to be as curious about Draco's life as he was over Potter's.
Malfoy seemed surprised to find Harry waiting for him outside Scorpius’ room.
They both worked contentedly for awhile, Draco cooking at the stove and Scorpius sorting through the pile of missives till the floo flared and Pansy stepped through. She took in Scorpius half-buried by letters on the floor, and then her eyes found Draco in the kitchen. “Oh good, I was worried I’d miss breakfast.”
“I’m fine. Do you want to hear the rest?”
“I’m sorry to hear that.” Professor Mentis’ voice had grown softer.
Harry did look (how could he not) and felt his stomach drop. It was one thing to have an understanding and adult break up, but it was another entirely to see the man you loved with his hand on another man’s thigh. Harry ducked his head and looked morosely into his pint.
“Cardiff.”
“I will not be disrespected like this!” The man bellows, glancing wildly around the room.
“No bother - it was nice to see you again, Hermione.” Draco said, and was surprised to realize he meant it.
“Brutus”
“Scorpius? What’s the matter? Is Aunt Pansy hurt?”
Draco desperately wanted to ask after Potter, but couldn’t bring himself to utter the words. He tried to silently will Hermione to reveal even a tidbit of information about her friend, but she seemed almost deliberately elusive, instead volleying the question of careers back at him.
“Harry! Harry!” It belongs to a little girl who is charging toward them, her glossy black curls bouncing. She has her face painted like a cat’s, white whiskers and a pink nose standing out against the dark brown of her skin. Harry turns around and Draco can see his face fill with happiness.
“Over four years of celibacy?” Pansy shook her head. “That’s an awfully long time.”
“That’s why I broke up with Ernest.” He says, attempting to circumvent the story.
The little boy shook his head. “I don’t want to stay at Aunt Pansy’s. I want to sleep in my bed.”
Draco sighed, and closed his eyes. “I'm sorry. Look, it doesn’t happen twice. I’ve had my chance. I was luckier than an ex-Death Eater deserved, and now it’s time to focus on Scorpius.”
Krampus = In Central European folklore, Krampus is a horned, anthropomorphic figure described as "half-goat, half-demon", who, during the Christmas season, punishes children who have misbehaved.
“You’ll have to come for dinner now that we’re settled in the new place.” Amani says and then, to Draco’s surprise “You as well, Draco, if you think you’re up for an adventure through Mexican-Sudanese fusion.”
“I took the morning off to check in on you.” She finally sat down in the chair opposite him, though her wand movements had not ceased and the room was tidying itself around them. From the kitchen Harry could hear the clink of dishes being washed.
“He doesn’t sleep at night.” The child’s voice said quietly. “I hear you walking around the flat, papa.”
“He likes the Holyhead Harpies. And he makes excellent brownies-”
“You don’t have to convince me he’s a good father, Scorpius.” Harry told him gently. “I can tell he loves you a lot and anyone who sees how happy you are knows he’s good at it.”
Maybe it was that he had already polished off a bottle and a half of beer, but Harry felt his eyes well up with tears. He used the sleeve of his jumper to wipe them away.
Malfoy is wearing the pale orange robes of a first year healer, which strikes Harry as odd given he was talking about it as a career more than three years ago. His hair is less stiffly coiffed now, and he looks relaxed, confident.
“That doesn’t make it any easier.” Hermione hesitated for just a second, then placed her hand gently on his arm. “Grief is never easy.”
“This is Professor Mentis, and you’re listening to my Mind Healing Hour on the WWN.”
“‘Yeda, you’re going to overwhelm him.” Fran chides gently. “My apologies, Draco, she gets so excited when she meets people who are like us, since we spend most of our time outside the community. It doesn’t help that Amani’s parents sent him to Uagadou and I went to Castelobruxo, so Sayeda has no one to ask about Hogwarts.”
Daphne and Blaise’s nanny, Lorna, shook her head, tears falling down her cheeks. “A couple of hours ago. He’s such a good boy, I swear he was fine just sitting in the library.”
It was only by sheer luck (or perhaps fate) that Harry’s crumpled up letter did not get thrown out or indeed, vanished - wizard homes rarely had rubbish bins because any refuse was swiftly magicked out of sight. Its survival came down to two factors: 1. As both Hermione and Harry had been raised by Muggles, the act of throwing out rubbish was ingrained in them from a young age, so Hermione kept a wastebasket and Harry’s first instinct was to deposit his crumpled letter there, rather than use magic to dismiss it. 2. the fact that Harry had been a Seeker, not a Chaser, and thus his throw toward said bin did not deposit the parchment inside. Instead, it hit the rim which redirected it and, by extension, the course of Harry’s life from that moment on.
“Sort of.” He took a long drink from his pint. “There’s something I need to take a chance on, I think. Someone.”
As the afternoon wears on, they stroll around the neighbourhood, chatting aimlessly till they find themselves beside a primary school that appears to be hosting a carnival in its car park. A flock of brightly coloured tents flap in the breeze and families wander around, competing for prizes, eating candyfloss, and having their faces painted. The noise level is loud but joyous, and they are just about to walk on when a small voice calls out:
The man sighed. “A year and a half.”
“Bad dream?” Harry asked, leaning against the wall beside him.
“Last Friday.” Draco downs his entire glass of wine unceremoniously, then makes a practised study of the menu, though the food aspect of their lunches has never really been a priority.
“Uh huh. Mummy loved Yule. Every year she would decorate our house and make papa sing muggle carols even though he hates them. I think he’s especially sad because of that.”
“I concur.” Pansy said, toasting Scorpius with her cup of tea.
“I expected you would still be at the Manor.” Harry said without thinking.
“Nuh uh.”
“How’s Ginny doing?” Amani asks.
“There is nothing you could ever do to make your papa hate you, Scorpius. I know that for a fact.” Harry rubbed a comforting hand in circles on Scorpius’ back. “He’s probably very worried, though. We should get you home, have you ever apparated before?”
about it. I’d like to ask them to move in with us.”
Hermione looked puzzled for a moment before understanding dawned on her face. “No.” She said. “Harry doesn’t hate you. Both he and Ron know we’re friends. Sometimes he asks after you.”
Hermione smiled fondly. “Married with not one but two sprogs. Rosie’s the oldest, and then there’s Hugo who is one. As you can tell, Rosie already has a mind of her own, but you don’t have to worry about Scorpius once she’s decided he’s her friend.”
“This odd letter I’ve received.” Harry pushed it across the table and took a deep pull from the pint.
“Actually, Draco made me upgrade, so I’m now fully capable of sending messages with all their words intact.”
“Are you alright?” Daphne asks.
“Sorry, I’ve been rude.” Harry pulls him forward by the elbow. “This is my friend, Draco Malfoy. We went to school together. Draco, this is Francisca and Amani.” The other two adults visibly relax, but Sayeda leaps forward and seizes the hand Draco has extended to her parents.
“Scorpius.” Draco said. “I’d like you to meet Hermione Granger.”
The library had a nice big fireplace, so when the time came it was quite easy for Scorpius to put down the comic he had been reading and sprinkle some stolen floo powder into the grate. He arrived in the Three Broomsticks at six pm, tumbling out of the fireplace on the heels of a family of four; just as Rosie had predicted, no one in the crowded pub paid any attention when he followed them out the door.
Their conversation after this follows more neutral territory: the waves Granger is currently making at the ministry, their respective summer plans, Draco’s fish and chips. It’s awkward, as neither really knows how to be friendly with the other. Draco is glad when they both finish, and even more so when Potter does not order any pudding (he seems the type). They pay their bills and stand, hovering beside their table.
“Lovegood?!”
Short chapter, but I'm quite confident it won't take me a month to update the next one now that the tumult of January is over.
Draco nodded. “Asleep upstairs with plenty of soundproofing and monitoring charms. Rose seems to have gotten the idea into his head that he should stay up till midnight, but thankfully he was asleep by 8pm.”
“I-” Harry started, then remembered. His upcoming date, the mysterious man from the wireless. The pull he felt toward that vague possibility. Though he felt a similar yearning now, he couldn’t see a future here, not from this inauspicious start - they might get drunk and fuck, Malfoy was certainly attractive enough that Harry’s body had taken immediate notice of the desire the other man inspired. He also felt a need to know the other man better, find out the minute details of his life. But Malfoy didn't seem to be interested in that, and Harry wanted a real, concrete future. A partner and family. It was plain Malfoy was only looking for a one night deal. So Harry averted his gaze.
“Oh.” Potter looks around to see if anyone is eavesdropping. “I’m sorry too. Weird it happened around the same time, isn’t it?”
Pansy winced - she often forgot that Draco didn’t tell Scorpius the intricacies of his personal life, preferring to remain focused on Scorpius’ wants and needs. As a result, she frequently slipped up and let details like this out without thinking.
Harry doesn't fully realise just what Sirius and Remus were to each other until the war is over and both men are dead.
Harry nods, sips slowly on the mead. Every word is precious to him, each one a small dab of colour added to the image of his parents. Still, there is something that Sirius has come close to saying and it hangs between them, an important detail just out of reach. This song was
“Thank you for coming.” Draco said, only just managing to keep his eyes from floating to Potter, who stood off to the side.
“No, I’m over that.” Pansy took off her heels and sat down cross-legged beside Scorpius. “What do you have there, Scorpo?”
“It doesn’t.” Pansy deadpanned.
Draco looked over at her untouched latte curiously, then exchanged his mug of tea for it and took a sip.
“I’ll see you later Sayeda.” Harry says, bending down again so he’s eye level. “I can’t wait to hear all about your adventures over dinner.”
“I think we’re old enough to decide for ourselves.” Draco leaned forward, surprised to find himself flirting. “I promise I won’t tell anyone.”
“Could you just marry Aunt Pansy?” Scorpius asked, causing the woman in question to snort into her tea.
“I thought maybe you’d like company for the walk back.” Harry lied, then was surprised to discover that it was not in fact a lie at all.
Harry takes this as his cue to exit, glancing over to see that Malfoy is utterly undisturbed and deep in conversation with a recently arrived healer.
“And then you hear a father on the wireless talking about his son, and you feel a connection to him because that’s what you’ve always wanted.”
“Talking to Harry.” Scorpius shrugged a pyjama-clad shoulder. “Did you know he wasn’t married?”
Potter shifts uncomfortably from foot to foot, suddenly reminiscent of a much younger boy. “Or not, forget I said anything.”
“Or wizard.” Pansy quipped, then clapped a hand over her mouth as she realized she had just inadvertently outed Draco to his son.
“I try not to assume anything about anyone’s sexuality. Or gender, for that matter.” Hermione said. “You know Charlie is nonbinary? They told us last year. I never would have imagined and it made me wonder - why? Why was I going around assuming everyone fit into these neat little boxes? If I restricted myself to one box I’d be what, a wife or a mother? I enjoy those roles, but they don’t define me. Logically no one role or binary state defines all people. You’re a prime example of that.”
“See?” Scorpius demanded. “I told you he was the best one from the letters. He wouldn’t lie.”
“She was flirting with you.” Potter says once the server has left after depositing drinks on their table: a proper tea for Draco and a large, frothy drink for Potter that he calls a cappuccino.
“So you’re married to Weasley are you?” Draco asked after a moment, when the tears that sprang to his eyes at her kind touch had dissipated.
or have you made an exception in my honour?
There was a pause, then Esme let loose a loud, over-exaggerated peal of laughter. “Oh, you’re funny!” She said, giggling as she reached for her glass of wine. “I like a man who’s funny.”
“I was just giving the boy a musical education.” Sirius says, gesturing at the albums on the table. “Lily would’ve.”
Weasley chuckled at this. “Rosie was still wide awake when we left her with mum. Poor thing has never gone up against Grandma Wealsey about bedtime before, won’t know what hit her.”
“Bye Harry, Bye Draco!” A huge yawn escapes Sayeda’s mouth. “When you come over I’ll introduce you to Azriel.”
Harry’s eyes welled over again, and he shoved the bottle of beer away in disgust as he frantically wiped at his face.
“I’m busy!” Which has been his only excuse since the event a fortnight ago. “I can’t always make it home till very late - you know what it’s like, we work for the same madman.”
“But if you met the right one, fell in love with her and couldn’t imagine living the rest of your life apart?”
“What is the number one rule for objects of unknown origin?” He asked, going over to rub a gentle hand across Scorpius’ back.
“I almost didn’t recognise you back there.” Potter says, which sounds like a lie, though Draco has made attempts at forging his own sartorial path. He’s quite proud of his travel outfit, a navy Burberry trench over a casual charcoal suit made by one of the designers popping up around the newly reformed, and slightly gentrified, Knockturn Alley. Draco’s tie matches his trench, and his white dress shirt is crisp; Ernest places a huge emphasis on style as well, which validates Draco’s obsession. He is tempted to reach up and run his hand through his hair; he has been wearing it in a short pompadour for the past few years (something his muggle-born barber calls “timeless style”) but he knows such attention would only be detrimental to its overall look.
That did it - Molly was weeping openly now as she wrapped her arms around the pair of them. “Oh boys.” She sobbed against Harry’s shoulder.
“We have our first floo call - what’s your name?” The smooth tones of Professor Mentis’ voice practically oozed out of the wireless.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you for inviting us. The place looks lovely.” she said, squeezing again before she let go.
Taken aback, Draco can only stare at him, trying to process the offer.
“I think celibacy might be a constant in my life till Scorpius goes off to Hogwarts.” Draco did not relish the prospect, but he couldn’t see any way around it.
Harry was straightening the neck of his robes as he exited, heading toward the stairs when a smaller blonde head than the one he had been tracking poked out one of the doors.
“Potter.” Draco’s heart thuds against his chest - he had sent a letter of apology months ago and received no response, assuming that Potter's silence spoke for itself.
Once inside the shed, Arthur gestured to a worn looking stool as he leaned against the workbench which currently held a large satellite dish and two microwave ovens. Harry wasn’t entirely sure Arthur should be messing around with microwaves, but that didn’t seem to be the topic of discussion at hand.
“From Papa! He’s a wizard who-” Before Scorpius could continue his train of thought on the matter, the man in question appeared. He stopped short before them, his gaze travelling between Harry and Scorpius.
“Arthur, I’m so sorry.” He stuttered - here he was, destroying the family heirloom that had been so kindly given to him. “It’s bad luck!”
“Who?”
“Am not! I just don’t like all their tails.” Scorpius protested.
Draco nods, trying not to show his surprise. “You have time to figure out what you want and, I'd wager, plenty of options as well.” He tries not to let the bitterness creep into his tone but he must not have succeeded as Potter immediately changes the subject and asks how he enjoyed the Potions N.E.W.T.
“Yeah.” The small voice got quieter. “My mummy. She died.”
Then there’s the fact that Ginny has this odd insecurity about his attraction to her. It’s completely incongruous with the rest of her personality, she’s practically become a feminist icon in the years since she joined the Harpies, but this one little sticking point has a tendency to balloon when she’s had a bad game or is feeling stressed. Combined with Harry’s particularly gormless inability to tell when she’s upset, it has been the cause of more than a few heated arguments.
“What - are we on the air right now?”
Which is how he found himself dropping Scorpius off at his first day of primary school, suddenly unable to let go of his son’s hand.
“Some of them to Harry, yes. We got into a lot of fights as boys.” Draco scrutinized his son’s plate. “Eat up Scorpius, you’ve barely touched your roast.”
Sirius flicks his wand and the record stops, lifts off the player and slides back into its sleeve. He selects another album, this one with a group of four young men not unlike the Marauders themselves on its cover. He sends it floating gently onto the player, there is a moment of silence, and then voices crackle into perfect acapella harmony.
Harry felt his throat tighten with emotion. “Arthur, I’d be honoured.”
Malfoy smiled slightly. “More likely Hufflepuff, if I’m being honest. I blame Astoria, her father was one.”
“I suppose I can’t fault you for liking it.” Hermione cast her gaze around the room as she spoke and Harry watched her expression go from neutral to concerned. “Don’t look, Harry, but Anthony is at the bar with his new boyfriend.”
Draco munches thoughtfully on a chip. “I’d like to be a healer,” he says at last, expecting Potter to scoff.
Harry always met Ron and Hermione at their home so they could travel as a group to the Burrow for Sunday brunch. On this particular day he emerged from their fireplace somewhat worse for wear despite a very strong hangover potion - he had stayed at the bar till well after midnight nursing a keen sense of loss that he couldn't quite explain. Scorpius and Rose were sitting on the couch, heads bent together as they whispered fervently. They broke apart when he appeared and flashed him identical innocent smiles - Harry knew they were hiding something but decided that they weren’t his children and therefore it was not his job to uncover their scheme.
“And it wouldn’t be fair to Tony, having to change the way he saw his life going, would it?”
Draco did a poor job of concealing his grin behind his mug, but if Hermione noticed she didn’t say anything.
He hesitated - now that he’d had a moment to think about it, this whole plan seemed just short of absurd. Still, he knew from experience that after having seen the wild look on his face as he tumbled into the living room, neither of his friends would settle for an excuse.
He has just finished his opening paragraph when the train begins to move and, in the same instant, someone sits down across from him. He knows without looking up that it is Potter.
“Are you sure you want to leave in the part about the brownies?” Rosie asked when she had finished carefully transcribing.
“I always thought he and the youngest Weasley would end up married.” Draco said.
“What are you-” Potter tries to rise, bashes his leg against the table in a way that causes him to swear under his breath, and collapses back into a sitting position.
“How is it?”
“It’s going to be a long engagement.” Harry said, raising his voice. “We didn’t - it sort of came out of nowhere, really. It just felt right, didn’t it Anthony?”
Draco looked between them, then back at Harry. “But the other night-”
“And a former Death Eater.”
Till now. Because as Harry watches the other man strain toward the snitch, sweat beading on his face, he feels his mouth go dry. As Ashcomb’s fingers close over the tiny golden ball, a latent realization finally pops through Harry's hazy mind like a cork.
Potter goggles for a moment, seeming to find difficulty in believing that it is Draco who Ernest has been snogging. For his part, Draco nods a quick hello and turns to give Ernest a final, cursory peck on the lips.
“I just hadn’t realized you -”
“Strawberry is my favourite.” Harry affirmed.
“We just moved here a few weeks ago.” Draco replied, wishing his tea would cool down enough to drink. “I wanted to be close enough to Scorpius’ school that we could walk there in the mornings, it saves time as a single parent.”
“Mummy got sick and it happened, just like that, and there was nothing anybody could do. If we start asking why we'll go mad.  So, rule number one: we don't ask why.”
“Nocere Revelare.” Draco waved his wand in a figure eight over the letters. The entire collection glowed a soft yellow. “Detecto dolo.” The glow intensified. “What does it look like when something is cursed, Scorpius?”
Harry’s mouth went dry. He had not imagined that his quick stop in for a drink would culminate in Draco Malfoy practically whispering in his ear about how he wasn’t actually straight at all. Let alone in a voice that felt like a jolt of lightening to Harry's insides. He also hadn’t realized how attractive Draco truly was till that moment, the other man leaning so close Harry could smell him - a hint of cloves and expensive soap. Malfoy’s voice had a certain quality at this timbre, it reminded Harry of something or someone he couldn’t quite put his finger on. Malfoy seemed to be enjoying the surprise on Harry’s face as he smirked and leaned back only fractionally, finishing the cocktail he had been drinking before starting in on the wine.
“Hullo.” Harry said to the room at large. “Everyone, this is Anthony. Anthony, everyone.” A glance at his fiance revealed that Anthony was slightly taken aback by the sheer number of people before him. He supposed that walking into a room with fifteen family members you hoped to impress might be a little daunting. Especially when you were an only child.
Harry stopped and ran a hand through his hair. Was he losing his mind? What kind of person wrote a - a love letter to a man they heard on the wireless?
“Dear Sleepless in Shoreditch” Scorpius read aloud. “I am a 25 year old witch from N- Aunt Pansy, what does that say?”
6:30pm: This is intolerable.
“Fine, fine, what about-”
There was a shock of silence before everyone started talking at once again.
Harry nodded. “I felt the same way about Grimmauld after Sirius died, it took me a long time to be able to live there again.”
“We’ll start with the school and then work our way through places he’s familiar with. He has to know the address to get anywhere so there are a limited number of possibilities.”
“I must get going, I’ll see you on Monday.”
“No house elves?”
“Yes. I’m just not used to so many voices.” Scorpius said, cutting his pancake into quarters with the side of his fork.
“He’s a great kid.” Harry said, holding a hand out to Scorpius, who took it happily.
Perhaps it is this question that prompts Potter to ask him to tea, though it could be simple loneliness; as Potter reveals how he found out his marriage was over on a quiet Sunday afternoon three weeks previous, it becomes apparent that he has spent the intervening weeks in solitude. When he finally finishes detailing the events (including a fantastic impression of Gwenog Jones trying to console him as the Harpies shrunk and carried his wife’s boxes out of their home) Draco realises that Potter is feeling completely at sea. Even the Golden Trio is no longer functioning properly, Weasley having been distant since his sister broke things off with Potter, and Granger quite busy with a big project at work.
“I don’t know if that’s a compliment on my dress or a comment on how I’ve aged.” Draco says archly.
“Not even the worst part, mate. Then there’s a knock on the bloody door and it’s the whole bloody team, come to help her move. Turns out she had her things packed and ready to go.”
“We’ll continue this another day.” She promised as she rushed out the door.
“Teddy isn’t really a child.” Harry said. “He’s almost thirteen. He’ll spend half his time at the Burrow with Victoire anyway. And you know Andy has been sick, she can’t look after him full time anymore. In fact, I’ve been thinking - and I wanted to
Draco looked helplessly at Pansy.
“You know” Daphne, ever ready with a goblet-half-full suggestion, says brightly “I have the perfect man to set you up with. He’s charming, well read, on the board of several charities. He was a few years ahead of us in school and he’s a wizard liaison for Gringotts. His name’s-”
“‘lo Malfoy.”
Harry choked a little on his drink and cast a searching look at Draco. “You came over here to hit on a bloke?”
“Da!” Hugo affirmed.
Hermione put a gentle hand on Draco’s arm to steady him and looked over at Ron “Send a patronus to Isobel.” And to Draco “She was Ron’s partner on the force and she’s still an auror. She’ll be able to help us.”
“Potter.” He said after a moment, then seemed to shake himself. “What are you doing out of bed, Scorpius?”
Of course they have been, Harry isn’t foolish enough to think they’re perfectly happy. To begin with, they haven’t had sex in approximately a year and a half, though Harry has been attributing this to the fact that both of them work demanding jobs which frequently take them out of the country.
“It certainly would have been more romantic.” Hermione said archly. She wasn’t wrong - while the festival was a lively celebration of community it was not exactly the favoured spot for a first date.
Draco nods. “Best of luck going forward, then.”
“My dad didn’t like that she was protesting?”
“They passed away when I was a baby.” Harry said quietly, aware that the topic of conversation was veering close to very personal territory for Scorpius.
“Fifteen minutes? I came upstairs to find the loo - I wasn’t snooping, it’s just a very vocal couple was occupying yours downstairs.”
“From everything I’ve seen he’s a wonderful kid.” Harry chewed thoughtfully on his lip for a moment, weighing his next words. “But you’re not the worst sort yourself, Malfoy. At least, not from what Hermione has told me.”
“It started to feel like we were roommates” Draco continues, ignoring this undignified behaviour while taking secret delight in having been its cause. “Then next door neighbours. Finally, I realised it had been months since we’d even eaten a meal together. That’s when I knew that we weren’t partners anymore, not really. So I sat down with him and laid out what I was willing to sacrifice - extra rotations at the clinic, every second week of lunches with Pansy and Daphne, things like that. And he...wasn’t. He didn’t want to. So we ended things.”
Fran studies them closely, her eyes flitting from one to the other. “We should set something up in the next couple of weeks. Do you still have that ancient mobile of yours, or has it finally given up the ghost?”
“That you like to drink lattes. That you purposefully put Scorpius in a multicultural school where he would meet muggle-born children. And that she considers you a friend, which is probably the highest recommendation you could get from anyone.”
“Potter.” Draco looked past him, but there was no trace of a companion. “Drinking alone?”
“Mind the carpet!” Draco yelped.
“Apology accepted.” Potter says quickly, sensing correctly that Draco will go on if he is allowed. “Though I think if we’re going to be friends you’d better call me by my given name.”
Pansy scrutinised them through dark lashes as she took a sip of her drink. “What are the two of you doing?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Did you papa?” Scorpius had danced around the issue before, but this was the first time had had asked the question directly.
“Ah, your true intention is revealed.” Draco considered - it was tempting, the man was handsome and it had been more than a decade since he had had a one night stand. Almost as long since he’d had sex with anyone except his wife, come to think of it, though there had been a couple of occasions with Theo and Astoria that they had all promised never to disclose to anyone (Pansy knew, of course. But Pansy knew everything.)
“I think the owl treats are in the sweets cupboard, papa.” Scoripus said helpfully. Draco stored his son’s detailed knowledge of said cupboard for a later conversation and after a moment of rifling, pulled the bag from behind a jar of ice mice whose number had been notably reduced.
“It’s alright. Why else talk to your school rival, if not for catharsis?”
An hour later, Draco finishes his final paper and exits the classroom. Potter did not take the Arithmancy N.E.W.T and thus finished his test an hour previous, which is why Draco is surprised to find him sitting on a bench outside. He stands when he sees Draco.
“Exactly. Our division looks after the wellbeing of all children in magical Britain as a whole, with a specific focus on those without parents, including children who are muggle born. All of us, even the purebloods, are educated at muggle universities as Social Workers for four years before we do any field work, and at the same time we’re also doing magical classes that compliment those skills. We number about twenty-five all told, with five of us being active, seven about to complete their degrees, and the rest in varying stages of their education. We take on cases and field them to the appropriate departments or see them through ourselves.”
Pansy looked from one to the other, grinning.
“You didn’t tell me Teddy would be staying with us.” He began as they passed an ice rink packed full of children.
“You can’t use him as an excuse forever.” Pansy sighed, draining her glasses and searching around for her wand so she could summon the bottle.
“Father. Latte drinker.” Hermione nudged his arm affectionately. “Surprisingly fun and witty companion. If you told a seventeen year old Hermione that she would be sitting in a posh coffee shop decorated to the teeth for Christmas, with her friend Draco Malfoy, she would have laughed herself sick.”
“But you must have some idea of where you see things going?”
“UGH.” Harry flipped the dial back.
“Draco, I didn’t want to start something with you because I thought a one-night stand was the only thing on offer.”
“We’re in the same class?” She said disbelievingly - Draco was beginning to think that curious skepticism was her default setting.
“Yes. These two little hellions cooked up a scheme to get Scorpius here to meet, well, you know the rest. To meet you.”
Draco knew this to be a lie, but decided not to comment - Pansy had plenty of things she could reveal about him in retaliation and he was not about to risk it in her current state.
“My apologies for the lateness of my arrival.” Draco said, hanging his jacket before sitting down across from her. “My son was not happy that I was leaving.”
Harry nodded. “I told him I wanted to move Teddy and Andromeda into Grimmauld and Anthony said he didn’t want to be a parent. And that he didn’t want to stop me from doing it either.”
“Yes, wizards can marry other wizards. People can fall in love with whomever they want, and I happen to be a wizard who does not care about the gender of his partner.” It sounded a bit simplistic to his ears, but Draco wasn’t sure now was the time for a detailed journey into his romantic life.  “And no, I’m not sure I want to get married again.”
Harry sighs internally - alright, he’s not happy, and clearly neither is she. But he still doesn’t know why they have to break up instead of working through it. Ginny had said that she didn’t want them to hold each other back. What had she meant by that?
“Sorry Scorpius. Of course we can go inside.” He let the small boy lead him toward a row of cubbies; they found the one inscribed with Scorpius’ name in neat, precise handwriting, stowing his satchel and jacket before exchanging his wellies for soft-soled trainers. When Scorpius ran ahead of Draco into the classroom he felt a brief panic of loss, stumbling slightly as he hastened to follow.
