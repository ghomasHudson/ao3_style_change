Harry choked on his oyster, which thankfully, was quite slippery and managed to make it down alright in the end. He widened his eyes incredulously at Draco.
“I packed it up,” Harry said, holding his chin up defiantly. “We’re going to bring it back to McGonagall.”
Nodding with satisfaction, Niamh guided Harry’s head back down to the pillow and continued to hover in his line of sight.
“Nothing about this is ever going to be fair to either of us,” Draco replied, eyes tired and shoulders slumped.
He stood from his chair and turned to face Draco. “I’m – God… I’m sorry. You’re absolutely right and I’d never even thought about it.”
They landed in a dark alleyway, where their past-selves were going over the plan they’d made to trap the dementors one last time. Looking between them, Harry wasn’t sure whether the past or current version of Draco looked more anxious.
“Where is Ginny?” he asked, panic eking back up. Niamh’s eyes tightened with concern. “Or- or Mrs. Weasley? Or Hermione?”
They spent a happy hour following Teddy around as he clambered up play structures and down the tot slide. When he was strapped into the swings by Malfoy, Teddy screamed for Harry.
It was soon followed by a blurry face which hovered above him. Between his swollen eye and his lack of glasses, Harry couldn’t make out any distinguishing features. Hands moved up to hover hesitantly by Harry’s jaw line, as though their owner wanted to hold his face, but was concerned about causing him more pain. Harry was grateful for the caution, he was quite certain even the gentlest touch would be incredibly painful at the moment. Merlin, what a state he must have been in if this was how he felt even
The thought of transporting via magic made Harry’s whole body tense protectively. After an unpleasantly jolty elevator ride, they emerged onto the main floor and wound their way past those unfortunate souls waiting to be triaged. They slipped out the window and onto the road, which was full of muggles rushing around so busily that they didn’t notice the three people who walked straight through the glass of the condemned department store onto the walkway.
“Do I just not deserve to be happy? Is that it?” Harry was fully yelling now. “Was I happy, Hermione? With him? I sure fucking look like I was!”
He stood up and walked over to the stove. “Let me help?” When Malfoy hesitated Harry grabbed the pan from his hand. “Come on, I’m sick of people waiting on me.”
“There’s also the matter of the dementors targeting you last year,” Draco continued. “It might be connected. We never really figured out anything about it, we were so focused on the dementors right in front of us.”
Harry stretched his lips into something between a sad smile and an uncomfortable grimace, “Don’t worry about it.”
She continued to explain softly, “You were attacked three days ago. We’ve had to keep you unconscious since then, due to brain swelling. We needed time to support your brain to heal. This morning we discontinued the charms, in order to allow you to wake naturally when you were ready. I imagine you’re in some pain, right now. Can we get this potion in you to help before we talk more?”
With a generous smile, Malfoy acknowledged the awkwardness. “Before, when we first became friends, I just absolutely refused to acknowledge how awkward it was. I knew I could convince you to work with me, so I determined that’s what we were going to do, no matter how much you argued.” He paused to eye Harry slyly, “mind, your arguments were on the weak side. Perfunctory, one might say.”
“You’re welcome,” Hermione said smugly. “So Ginny will be back in town tomorrow and we can get her memories - ”
“Thanks, Harry. It’s just hard. The proper investigation is clearly going nowhere. We’re not doing any better. And…” Draco’s mouth twisted and Harry knew he was fighting off tears.
They fell into silence for a moment before Malfoy said, “Today’s my last day home before I’m back to my regular training schedule.”
“Have you been having lots of nightmares since coming home?” Draco’s voice was hushed. Harry could see the edges of his features in the bit of light filtering in from the hallway. He looked concerned.
Harry undid the buttons and then nudged Draco to lift his hips up so Harry could pull his pants and trousers down towards his knees. In all the weeks Harry had been contemplating this, he’d imagined he would feel much less certain about it. Perhaps if Draco weren’t so hesitant, he would have been. But he wrapped his fingers around Draco and pumped a few times, before lowering his lips with a small smirk.
“Well, I happen to know that Hermione has a study schedule written up for you already,” Malfoy replied as he pulled the door of the study closed behind them. “Come on, next floor’s got the best room. I can’t believe that Ron didn’t make sure you saw it right away when you first came home.”
“Oh.” Harry blinked at the table and its bounties. On Teddy’s card, there was a stick man whose head was engulfed in sunshine yellow standing next to stick Harry (his head was invisible behind an ominous cloud of black).
Draco let out a huff of amused laughter as he watched a woman in her thirties trying to corral five spirited children. “Reminds me of Molly,” he murmured.
“Yeah,” he rubbed at the back of his neck. “Yeah. I mean, I know it’s all going to be terribly awkward. So I’m sorry about that part of it all. But your friends with all my friends now, and I have to trust past-me’s judgement I suppose. I thought what you said, about getting to know each other as friends made sense.” He shrugged helplessly. “I’d like to get to know you.”
“Yup.” Harry ran his fingers through the soft pile of the rug. “We’ll find whoever did this. We will.”
“Guess what I’ve got hold of?” She asked eagerly, before her eyes sharpened and she exclaimed, “Oh my God, you two have shagged, haven’t you?”
The next morning Harry woke early from a nightmare that left nothing but a lingering sense of anxiety. He tried for a while to fall back to sleep, it was still dark out and he didn’t want to cause Gandalf to stir and become excited. Recently (and Harry wasn’t quite sure which of them had started it) he and Draco had begun to leave their bedroom doors open at night and the crup would lie on the hallway floor in between them. Finally, Harry sighed and crept out of bed. He hushed the whimper of excitement from Gandalf as he glanced into the dimness of Draco’s room to confirm he was still sleeping.
Harry bit his lip and broke the eye contact, which had caused something of a riot in his stomach. “It’s your turn.”
“I need to head off to my seminar in a few,” Malfoy said, pulling Harry out of his reminiscing. “But I wondered about having Dudley over for dinner? He’s been asking.”
They headed down the sterile halls of Mungo’s, all sorts of strange sounds echoing along them. Harry glanced to Malfoy at his side and asked, “Are you always that polite?”
- you must be a Slytherin graduate- right? Harry pondered this thought giddily, feeling so tired, even though he had just woken from a three day coma.
“Merlin,” Harry shook his head. While he’d managed to come around to the fact that he was, indeed, more interested in men than he’d ever been in any girl, it was hard to hear he’d been such an arse as to do that to Ginny, who of course he cared about.
“Huh,” Harry backed out of the room with a shrug. “Never seen it. You going show me the rest of this place or what?”
Hermione, looking as nervous as Harry himself felt, shifted her hand to hold his more tightly and a sharp poke drew his attention. A glimmering diamond ring adorned her finger.
“It’s not your fault, Harry,” Draco smiled sadly. “And I have no intention of letting her ruin our evening.”
On the third day, just after lunch, Harry had brushed off Hermione’s suggestion that he go to lay down and had instead gone into the drawing room and grabbed a book from the top of a pile on the side table. Unfortunately, it was obviously left behind by Malfoy –
“Nah,” Harry shook his head. “Seemed pretty sincere to me. She’s interesting. Reminded me of Luna a little. Maybe I should give Luna her details. I bet they’d have a great time designing custom gowns together.”
“Some members of the Dolohov family have been brewing up a gang of wizards with anti-muggle sentiments.”
“Except for the fact that very recently you almost fucking DIDN’T!” Draco was so angry now that he was flinging his arms for emphasis. Harry thought that if he did so just a little more aggressively he’d lose balance and tip himself over. “And yet, you seem to believe you know better than a team of trained Aurors.”
family. Draco’s family. Harry wondered about what Longeman had told him about Draco’s mother; he certainly wasn’t brave enough to probe into that any time soon.
couldn’t he have been so on top of things that night last week when Draco showed up at their front door?), they offered apologies to one another.
“Oh God, no. He’d be livid with me. Please don’t even tell her.” Harry shuddered to think of Draco’s response to having Pansy called on him. “But I don’t know what to say to him. It’s seriously worrying me.”
Malfoy set down his fork and leaned towards Harry, his blonde brows furrowing. “For everything from when we were younger. You don’t remember all the steps between you rather rightfully hating me and now, so I need to apologize for all of it.”
“I didn’t mean to hurt him,” Malfoy said after a minute. “Just got carried away. I was angry.” He took a deep breath and added, “About everything.”
Ginny preened dramatically and fluffed at her hair. Harry hadn’t even noticed, but it was shorter than it had been last week at the hospital, cut into a soft, waving bob.
Wrinkling his nose, Harry thought this over. This relationship was so new to him. Something about that felt like pushing a boundary he wouldn’t be allowed to push yet.
Despite her concerns, Molly was ecstatic to hear that Harry and Draco were back together and made treacle tart to celebrate. The two of them graciously received comments ranging from congratulatory to rather inappropriate teasing from George and Bill.
Harry wanted to ask about the tea, but decided that at this point it might be better to let Malfoy sleep it off a little, rather than blunder drunkenly through the awkward conversation coming their way.
“He did,” Harry agreed. He pressed a kiss to Draco’s cheek for the pleasure of watching it turn an even deeper shade of pink and hearing the girls gasp in delight. “We’re… properly together again, I suppose.”
Perhaps he ought to let Draco know how early he could see the signs of his past-self falling for Draco. Perhaps he ought to let him know that between their time together in present day and reviewing the memories, Harry of current times was nearly there too. In the end, he decided he didn’t want to rush it. Instead, he pushed back his embarrassment as Draco walked him to the washroom, and waited outside the door to walk him back to bed before saying goodnight.
“Auror Longeman,” Draco greeted pleasantly, while Harry stared Longeman down with flashing eyes. “Please, sit. How is the tea?”
“Let me help,” Harry said. When Draco appeared hesitant, he pushed forward, “By that I meant I’m helping. We obviously made a good team with the dementor stuff.”
Harry’s tone of voice must’ve given away how unimpressed he was with the prospect of that endeavor, because Malfoy chuckled in that soft, low way. It was leagues away from the cutting, derisive laughs that Harry remembered from school. He found himself hoping he could hear more of it.
” Hermione hissed. It was the one curse she really couldn’t tolerate. “But really, Ronald. What were you thinking?”
Encantado’s sign was glowing softly, the letters sparkling in a subtly enticing way that looked classy rather than gauche. There was a wizard in dress robes with a genial smile on the stoop, holding a list of reservations.
Draco smiled, “Well this is one you already know most of the answers to. I enjoy Quidditch, chess, movies, walks with Gandalf, time with our friends…” He hesitated, and while his cheeks were already flushed in the cool air, Harry was pretty sure they darkened with embarrassment.
Draco flinched a little at the name. He met Harry’s eyes, “You really don’t think she was involved?”
“It’s like a game to get to know each other better. It was Niamh’s idea, really. Credit where its due and all. But we each ask each other questions and then we have to answer that same question ourselves. I know it’ll be a bit odd because you’ll already know most of my answers, but pretend you don’t, just for the sake of, you know, getting to know one another again.”
“Thank you,” she reached to squeeze Draco’s hand. “But I’ve been terribly rude. Talking so much. How are the both of you? Has your recovery been going alright, Harry?”
They stood together in silence for a while before Harry said, “We’ve dinner at the Burrow tonight, why don’t we go have a nap first?”
“If you do, then you haven’t gotten to know me well enough yet!” Draco shouted. “Or maybe it’s just that you still think I’m only in it if it’s easy? We,” he waved his hand sharply between them, “have
Determining that Draco was best left to sleep as long as he needed, Harry slipped out of bed to let Gandalf out and feed him his breakfast.
He hesitated for a moment before saying, “Alright then. Okay. I promise I will stop looking for Clarice Brunetto. But, Harry, you need to keep watching the memories.”
He walked them down to the door, dismissing their looks of concern and emphasizing that he was just tired, which the Niamh said was to be expected.
“He’s fine,” Harry assured her. “It’s been fucking weird. I’m definitely more easily tired, which is frustrating. But the headaches have been happening less often, and they’re less intense when I get them.”
The most upsetting visit was from Andromeda and Teddy. Teddy, against his grandmum’s protests, ran into Harry’s room and clambered up onto the bed. He patted Harry’s face gently and with a look of great concern.
Harry shook his head apologetically. “That, er, wasn’t quite the right word. But this is taking a toll on you. It’s not worth it just to try and get revenge on whoever hurt me.”
“It’s sort of like entering into a film, watching everyone act around you. Only they don’t know you’re there at all.” Harry nibbled on his lip. “I’ve never seen a memory with me in it before. It’ll be a bit odd, I suppose.”
Shaking his head in bewilderment, Dudley said, “I used to wish I was magic, but with all the mad stuff that happens to you, I’ve changed my mind.”
“Missed it on the grand tour the other day. I’ll show you,” Malfoy promised, guiding Harry back across the attic.
“Great,” Malfoy gave him a gentle smile. “We’ll order pizza. Don’t overdo it today. If you want to do the third memory without me, go ahead. But if you’d rather wait for me, that’s fine too. I’ll make sure there’s time before Dudley’s over. I’ll be home around five.”
This was just irritating. Why couldn’t she tell him what the actual bleeding fuck was going on? “Harry James Potter. July 31, 1980.”
It was strange to have lost his memories of slowly coming to terms with his sexuality. Now that he’d woken up to the reality of it, it was ridiculously obvious. He wasn’t easing his way into his attraction for Malfoy, he’d been plunged in deep. To his credit, Malfoy did seem to be trying not to make it harder on him.
“Last year, just shortly after the last date you recall, you were attacked by dementors in muggle London.”
“I see,” Harry replied gently. He reached for Draco, “Either way, it’s late and you’ve got training in the morning. I don’t want you off your game and coming home with any missing bits because you weren’t paying proper attention during duelling class.”
“No, it’s… you didn’t mean…” Harry looked over to Draco helplessly. He didn’t want him to feel badly. He was sure that the fact of it hurt Draco just as badly as it did Harry, after all.
Ron grinned, “This barmy bird tried to break into Mungo’s when you were brought in.” He ignored Hermione hissing at him that they weren’t meant to overload Harry with stories. “He’s the one who found you, after you were attacked. Anyways he made it all the way to the lifts, and this nurse was losing it. But Oscar wouldn’t leave until Draco pulled out his strict tone. He sounds like mum when he does, it’s awful.”
The rest of the day had gone quite pleasantly, really. Harry had given in and taken a pain potion and a bit of a nap after the film was over. Then Dromeda and Teddy had come by again for a late lunch and some time at the park. Throughout the afternoon Harry and Malfoy had sat companionably at the kitchen table while Harry began to review his Charm’s readings and Malfoy worked on an essay for one of his classes. Harry wasn’t sure why Malfoy had chosen to sit with him, rather than in his study. Maybe it was just to keep an eye out for Harry overexerting himself. It felt like more than that, though. It felt like both of them just wanted to be nearby one another, as though watching the first memories had chipped further away at the nervous tension between them.
“She’s right famous,” Harry spoke loudly into Draco’s ear once they’d settled in. At least a quarter of the people wearing Holyhead robes had
Malfoy pulled out his wand, “Here.” He drew a circle around the spot, murmuring a spell Harry couldn’t catch and a cool tingling spread across Harry’s back.
Harry’s eyes immediately landed on Draco, he studied his face intently, looking for the little cracks in his demeanor. His mouth pulled down at the corner just a little and his eyes were like dark tunnels. He didn’t even respond to Gandalf as the puppy tried to climb his way up Draco’s leg for attention.
Kreacher appeared in the hall with a loud crack. “Kreacher can set Mr. Malfoy up in a room, perhaps?”
Seeming to realize that the offer was at least partially stemming from pity, Malfoy narrowed his eyes and straightened his back. “You don’t need to do this. I’m fine with Pansy.”
“Trainee Malfoy,” Longeman said coolly, finally turning to look at Draco, “I recommend you remember your tenuous position within the DMLE as well as the way your past actions reflect on you in the current circumstances.”
Dudley easily divulged every detail of the flat in London that he’d moved into, the mechanics training program he’d finished in December, the new girl he was seeing, and the story of the first time he’d met Malfoy. Apparently, he’d apparated right into the middle of a dinner that Harry and Dudley were sharing.
“Yeah, yeah.” Biting his lip firmly to keep himself from getting too emotional (he’d had quite enough crying already this week thank-you-very-much) Harry replied, “this is really nice. I’m glad to see it’s been left.”
A series of yipping barks echoed up the hallway, and on skittering feet the crup puppy that Harry had no memory of appeared. He was adorable, with scruffy white and brown fur, his forked tail beating wildly as he slammed into Kreacher’s legs on his way to Harry. Kreacher, disgruntled, apparated away. Oscar abandoned Harry for the bannister of the nearest stairwell as Harry dropped to his knees to greet the pup, “Hey, Gandalf. Hi, buddy.”
“Yes, but you clearly can’t be trusted to spend more than a few hours to yourself,” George retorted, eyes sparkling. “Relax, mate. Can’t a fellow spend some time with his recently seriously injured friend without being accused of alternative motives?”
Long, platinum hair framed grey eyes and sharp features. Malfoy, for sure. The other man’s eyes widened and he pulled his hands away from Harry.
And then, there was his hair. Malfoy either left it down, accentuating his collar bones at it brushed gently against them, or tied it into a knot at the back of his head, which highlighted his jawline and long neck. And his piercings - something about them drove Harry wild. The hoop in his eyebrow would glint when he raised his brow and smirked at Harry in a way that was definitely more flirtatious than any of the smirks Harry could remember seeing on Malfoy before. Several times now Malfoy had given him such a look and then quickly withdrawn, shyness overtaking his features. Harry found that just as attractive, strangely endearing. Twice as often as that, Malfoy would open his mouth to say something and clearly think better of it, leaving his lips slightly ajar in a way that left Harry wondering how it would have felt if Malfoy
“Why would we keep these?” Harry asked, at a loss. Last he remembered he’d refused to subscribe to the
“I mean, I’ve done nothing but fuck up. And I know this is hard for you. I don’t want you to feel forced to keep trying, is all…”
“Mr. Potter,” Longeman greeted dispassionately, passing his robe off to Kreacher without so much as a glance his direction.
Frowning, Harry grabbed a book and decided to wait in the sitting room until the two made it back safely. Diggle probably would have ensured they came back home, Harry knew. But he wanted to make sure for himself. When they returned and Malfoy looked surprised to see Harry up, Harry told him he just couldn’t sleep after his long nap earlier.
“Did you end up seeing your memory for today? I’m sorry, I figured you probably needed your sleep before Dudley arrived more than anything.”
“I did, thank you. I never used to like to talk about it. I’d have to hide it from my father. My mother would owl me supplies without his knowledge.”
“The healers have told me I need to remove myself from the situation, for now.” Malfoy said, clearly deciding he didn’t want to discuss whatever it was the Prophet had to say after all. “That it will be too much of a strain on Harry to have me around. That someone who he trusts deeply should explain it all to him.”
He’d worked with George all through August to get the shop back open, and had been over there helping him out several mornings a week through what Harry could remember of the fall. George cut him off with a sharp elbow in his ribs.
Draco smiled his thanks. “Once I’ve narrowed it down a bit, I’ll pass it on to Longeman. His team hasn’t exactly
They’d begun to follow Annalise to their table when Draco stopped abruptly, causing Harry, who was holding onto his hand once more, to stumble over his feet. When he glanced back in concern, it was to find Draco struggling to mask a look of shock with an indifferent demeanor. Harry followed his gaze to Narcissa Malfoy, dressed in an even more refined fashion than Draco, sitting alone at a table for two. She was draining the last sip of wine from her glass, and as she went to set it down, she glanced up to find the three of them staring at her.
It was definitely the best room. A deep, inviting couch rested against one wall, with heavily cushioned reclining armchairs on either side of it. They faced a large television which had a surround sound speaker system. Shelves on either side of the telly were lined with films. Deep red velvet curtains were pulled across the window, but sconces lit the perimeter of the room in response to a flick of Malfoy’s wand.
Harry dropped the sheets back onto the table and pulled Hermione’s schedule towards him. She’d left a note on the bottom, suggesting he work on one subject at a time as he could do anything he wanted at whatever pace he’d like when it came to coursework, and he had the option to write his NEWTS one by one if he’d like; there were scheduled sittings every other month through the Ministry’s educational department. Hermione had scheduled him in to focus first on Potions.
“Pansy, it’s just coffee. Anyway, I won’t be long because in case you forgot, our exams are this week and I need to study.”
As I rerun through the whole interview, my face gets hotter and hotter no matter the rain. No man has ever had that effect on me before. Why him? Sure, Potter is good looking, and polite, he has wealth, and a lot of power. That show of power in his office was at the same time ridiculous and also hot.
“Not necessarily. A weed is just a plant we see to be in an undesirable location. Some of these plants we may want to keep. Let me have a look around.” He says to me and I stop pulling at the weed- no the plant.
“No thanks love, not hungry.” I kiss him on the forehead and go to leave, when he grabs me and pulls me in for a proper kiss.
“Merlin, are you okay?” He leans on one hand and uses his other to push some strands of hair out my eyes. He moves his fingers from my hair down my face and brushes my lower lip. My breath hitches and I have a very non discrete bulge in my pants which I hope he doesn’t notice.
“Draco, I’ve just sat for two and a half hours listening to all kinds of crap. I would like a drink.”
“Right, you get washed and I’m going to make you a sandwich. I’ll be back in 10 minutes to help you out, okay?” She says gently. I nod at her and she leaves. I place my head against the back of the bath and just lie there for a minute. Then I start washing myself because I know that if I am not washed by the time she comes back up, then she will wash me herself and I don’t want that.
After Andy and Narcissa have had another good hold of Leo and we’ve had a chat, we get going. I put Leo back in his pram and give everyone a hug.
“I know what you mean about formal.” She shouts over the music. “It’s a shame we couldn’t get an original picture for the article. He is a good looking son of a bitch, right?”
“Harry, is everything okay? Your floo is shut.” Hermione says down the phone. Me and Draco share a look and he nods.
“You are a lifesaver Draco! Thank you so much. Here.” She passes me some parchment and quill. “These are my questions and all you have to do is read them out to him. Maybe jot some notes down but make sure to record it anyway.” She says while wiping her nose on the back of her hand and passing me the recorder thing. It’s muggle and Pansy swears by it; she says it’s saved her life more times than she can count and that we wizards should really start looking more highly on muggle technology.
“Come on, we need to get dressed - that’s if you want to meet my mother.” He grins, leaps off the bed, and pulls on his jeans - no underwear! I struggle to sit up as I’m still tethered.
It’s international friendship day here in the uk! So happy celebrations! Hope you like the chapter. Enjoy X
He lifts me and pulls the quilt and my duvet out from underneath me and places me back down, this time on the sheets.
“Let’s get this jacket off, shall we?” he says softly and slides the jacket slowly down off my shoulders and arms. He places it on the chair.
“We have a son, Harry.” He sobs and turns slightly. He pulls back and places the baby in my arms. He starts crying again gently and all I can do is stare.
“You might need that.” I say and go back downstairs to get him a glass of water out the fridge with lemons in it, just how he likes.
“I didn’t know the time, I’m-im so sorry. I’m so stupid.” I sob my heart out to them. I expect them to look angry but they look sad. Then Hermione sits next to me on the sofa and Ron sits on the floor in front of me. And they just sit there with me while I’m crying. Hermione places her arms around me and leans her head on my shoulder and Ron places a hand on my knee.
“Red Room of Pain? It’s mostly about pleasure, Draco. Believe me.” he says. “Besides,” his tone is harsher, “your roommate is making the beast with two back with my brother. I’d really rather you didn't.”
George came up to us then to say hello with 2 year old Fred on his shoulders. The little boy was giggling and holding on to his dad's forehead. Angelina shouted over to be careful with her son but George just rolled his eyes and carried on wiggling his shoulders and making his son giggle.
“I needed time to think.” I whisper. I’m all deer/headlights, moth/flame, bird/snake …..and he knows exactly what he’s doing to me.
2: Not sure why this is solely for MY benefit - i.e., to explore MY sensuality and limits. I’m sure I wouldn’t need a ten-page contract to do that! Surely this is for YOUR benefit.
“Okay let's go then. Hold on tight to my hand.” I hold my hand out for him and he runs up and grabs it.
“Why? Ginny said it this morning when she spilled her cup of tea.” He says confirming my suspicions.
“So Teddy… you know we don’t want anyone to know about the baby yet right?” Draco asks him as we approach the door.
“No, Draco, it doesn’t. First, I don’t make love. I fuck….hard. Second, there’s a lot more paperwork to do. And third, you don’t yet know what you're in for. You could still run for the hills. Come, I want to show you my playroom.”
The Submissive will keep himself clean and shaved and/or waxed at all times. The Submissive will visit a beauty salon of the Dominant’s choosing at times to be decided by the Dominant and undergo whatever treatments the Dominant sees fit. All costs will be met by the Dominant.
I wrap the duvet around me and quietly pad down the stairs and towards the living room. Harry is at the piano, completely lost in the melody he’s playing. His expression is sad and forlorn, like the music. His playing is stunning. Leaning against the wall at the entrance, I listen, enraptured. He’s such an accomplished musician. He sits naked, his body bathed in warm light cast by a solitary freestanding lamp besides the piano. With the rest of the large room in darkness, it’s like he’s in his own isolated little pool of light, untouchable….lonely, in a bubble.
“He was attentive.” I pause. What can I say? His HIV status is clear, he’s heavily into role-play, wants me to obey his every command, he hurt someone he tied to his playroom ceiling, and he wanted to fuck me in the private dining room. Would that be a good summary? I try desperately to remember something from my encounter with Harry that I can discuss with Pansy.
“I’m not writing it, Pansy is. Miss Parkinson. My roommate, she’s the writer. She’s very happy with it and was devastated she didn’t get to do the interview herself.” I feel myself relax and come up for air. Finally something not about me and a normal topic. “She’s a bit concerned she doesn’t have an original picture of you though. The only ones she could find were muggle photos.”
I thank him and head to the elevator with my ‘visitor pass’. I smirk a bit at that because I’m sure it's obvious that I don’t belong here, without printing it in large on a security pass. I’m wearing converse for god's sake and everyone else is in suits and heels and dressed professionally. Even the security are dressed in black suits, I notice as I pass them on my way to the elevator.
4: As you are aware, you are my only sexual partner. I don’t take drugs, and I’ve not had any muggle blood transfusions. I’m probably safe. What about you?
“Come on grumpy bum. Let’s get some ointment on them hands. Crookshanks sit.” The bloody cat listened and sat straight away. “Now stay. Good crookshanks.” I just stared in disbelief. As we slipped through the door I turned to Draco and hissed.
“Wow that long? My Dora was out within 5 hours. She never did wait around.” We all chuckle at that and Draco leans into me and sighs happily.
Harry heads into the kitchen and picks up his phone, scrolling through some emails, I assume. His mouth presses in a hard line, and he makes a call.
“I know,” he murmurs. He leans down and kisses me, his finger still moving rhythmically inside me, and he adds another one. His other hand scoops my hair off my head and holds my head in place. His tongue mirrors the actions of his fingers, claiming me. I am so close to cumming, my cock leaking pre-cum, and I push against his fingers to try to make them go deeper. He gentles his hand then, so that I’m brought back from the brink. He does this again and again. It’s so frustrating…..
“Draco dear, I’m the one that should be apologising. It’s good to see you putting on weight and I shouldn’t have made a joke.” She says back to him sincerely.
“Being a dork?” He looked up through his lashes and smirked. Then the song changed to a slow one and I pulled him closer. We both still had our paint brushes in our hands and paint on our clothes but neither of us seemed to care at this moment. After a couple of minutes of listening and swaying together, the song changed again to a faster one. Draco pulled me in for a kiss and whispered in my ear.
We start in the front room. The wallpaper is going on one wall and we have to paint the rest, which Teddy has kindly offered to start. While me and Nia are figuring out the wallpaper, Draco and Teddy are sitting on the floor painting the bottom of the wall.  A couple of hours later and the wallpaper is done plus the bottom half of the wall has been painted. Me and Nia turn our attention to the wall and by the time we are done it looks great.
His eyes are burning into mine and they are anxious. Then my eyes are drawn to his mouth, his beautiful, beautiful mouth. For the first time in my 21 years alive, I want to be kissed. I want Harry Potter to kiss me.
“Sit.” Harry commands, shocking me out of my worrying. He’s wearing a white linen shirt, collar and cuffs undone. He points at the table which I now realise has a LOT of food on it. I sit down opposite him and shit uncomfortably.
15.9    The Dominant shall maintain his own good health and seek medical attention when necessary in order to maintain a risk-free environment.
“I have rules, and I want you to comply with them. They are for your benefit and for my pleasure. If you follow these rules to my satisfaction, I shall reward you. If you don’t, I shall punish you, and you will learn.” He whispers and I glance at the canes as he says this.
He points his long boney finger to an icon on the scream and continues to huff out instructions to me, but it’s like white noise. I haven’t got a clue what he’s saying, and in all honesty, I’m not interested.
“Sure.” He turns to Pansy and pulls her into his arms. Then gives her a long, lingering, passionate kiss goodbye.
“Well I…” He goes a bit shy then and looks down at his shoes. “I had a really good time today, thank you everyone. My presents were lovely and the party was brilliant.” He looks up again now, getting a bit of confidence back. “But it wouldn’t have been possible without my uncle Harry and my uncle Draco. They are some of the greatest people I know and whoever disagrees shouldn’t come to my house anymore…. and well, they are going to be great dads!” He finishes his speech then. I was smiling all the way through until that last sentence. Merlin Teddy, he really didn’t get things sometimes.
“Ermm...excuse me a moment, Mr Potter.” Potter frowns at me and follows me with his eyes as I turn and head to Greg.
“I don’t doubt that.” I whisper into my cup of tea. “Why haven’t you asked me to call you by your first name?” Okay….that was not what I expected to say.
What a surprise. His black hair is tousled and sexy. He’s as beautiful as Pansy. The family resemblance is striking.
“For Nia! All this space for her. It’s perfect right?” I look around and imagine what it would look like. There is a bathroom up here and there is enough room to split into a bedroom and a sitting area.
“Tomorrow?! You waited until the last day to ask me to look after the cat?” She was heading towards the floo now, slowly backing away from the conversations.
15.23    The Submissive shall always conduct himself in a respectful manner to the Dominant and shall address him only as Sir, Mr Potter, or such other titles as the Dominant may direct.
Then Luna speaks up. “Yes, you shouldn’t joke. Draco can’t help being pregnant as much as Hermione can, and nobody is joking about her.” Then she carries on messing with the food on her plate, like she hasn’t just told a secret to a room full of people.
“Sev, we have half an hour. Would you like some tea? And you can tell me how your potions store is going.”
“Hey Harry, do you wanna keep this?” Neville says and comes out of the greenhouse. He sees Draco and immediately looks at his belly and they both freeze. “Draco… hey. So I guess it’s true then. Congratulations, you two!” Draco unfreezes then, then turns and practically sprints into the house. “Oh I’m sorry Harry, I didn’t mean offence.” Neville says shyly to me.
Severus walks besides me as we head down to the great hall. We follow the stream of wizards and witches gowned in their black robes.
“It’s a picture…. of your new baby brother or sister!” He says and most the kids jump up. Some in protest but most in celebration.
A flogger….hmm. I think I'm in shock. I can observe and absorb but not articulate my feelings about all this. What IS the appropriate response to finding out a potential lover is a complete freaky sadist or masochist? Fear! Yes, that seems to be the overriding feeling. I recognise it now. But weirdly not of him - I don’t think he’d hurt me, well, not without my consent. So many questions cloud my mind, why? How? When? How often? Who?
“Draco interviews me for the student paper at Hogwarts because I’m conferring the degrees there this week.”
“That sounds lovely.” Draco said and gave me a quick kiss. “Now let's see what’s in this creepy building.”
Oh…. that surprises me. Before I can question him further on this revelation, he interrupts my train of thought.
“It requires control and concentration….how could I not love it?” He laughs. “Although brooms are my favourite.”
The tears are coming heavy now, I haven’t allowed myself to feel this in a long time. But it’s what I need right now.
“Don’t say that again. Especially in this house.” Draco says and then picks him up. “Now, how do you like your room?”
“Goodnight grandma, goodnight uncle Draco. Thanks for today.” He says sleepily. They say their good nights back and we head upstairs.
“Hello Draco, I’m.....pleased to see you too,” he mutters as he hugs me back slightly. Setting me back down, his hands are on my shoulders, he looks me up and down, his brow furrows. “Are you okay?”
Half an hour later we are all back at Andromeda’s having a cup of tea while I’m waiting for Draco to arrive. Hermione went home about 10 minutes ago so she could do some reading before Ron got home from work. She rarely gets days to herself lately, with working so hard at the ministry. She’s going to be a great minister of magic some day. She works so hard and tries to include everyone in everything and promote fairness. She’s already working on proper work contracts for house elf’s and equality for all magical creatures. She really is amazing.
“Okay, and what do I get out of this?” My slytherin brain starts thinking. But he just shrugs and almost looks apologetic.
“Oh dear, did I say something I wasn’t suppose to? I’m sorry Draco.” I look at Draco and he looks like he’s holding tears back. He stands up and drops his napkin on his plate.
“You look stunning.” he murmurs as he leans down to briefly kiss my cheek. “Plum, Mr Malfoy. I approve” Taking my arm, he leads me to a secluded booth and signals for the waiter.
“I hope you guys don’t mind but I’m going to do a few wildlife projects out here. Like a bug tower, and homes for hedgehogs and birds, and I’ll find flowers that attract bees and butterflies…” she goes on but I don’t mind what she does because she did this for us. From where we are standing at the treehouse tree, I look over to the apple tree, I wonder if that's the one..
Oh, my worst suspicions confirmed. She has taught him well, and the thought depresses me - there’s nothing I can teach him. I have no special skills. “She must have been a good teacher.”
I remember the pub, the drinks, the lights, and oh shit—I called him last night, and threw up in front of him. I groan and put my face in my hands. And oh shit...Blaise. I sit up quickly, remembering the incident with Blaise. It could have been the sitting up too fast or the memory, but I suddenly feel nauseous again.
Why won’t he look at me? Perhaps he’s changed his mind? A wave of unease washes over me. Perhaps walking out on him last night was the end for him, too. He’s bored of waiting for me to make up my mind. Oh no, I could have completely blown it. I remember his email last night. Maybe he’s mad that I haven't replied.
What if I do say yes, and in three months’ time he says no, he’s had enough of trying to mold me into something I’m not? How will I feel? I’ll have emotionally invested three months, doing things that I’m not sure I want to do. And if he then says no, agreement over, how could I cope with that level of rejection? Perhaps it’s best to back away now with what self-esteem I have reasonably intact.
“Mr Potter.” Greg returns his handshake. “Wait - not the Harry Potter? Of Potter Enterprises Holdings?” Greg is suddenly all awestruck and the atmosphere goes back to normal. Potter gives him a polite smile but it doesn’t reach his eyes.
Internet! I don't have access to a computer, only Pansy’s laptop, and I couldn’t use the school's ones, not for this sort of ‘research’ surely.
“I’ll do that. You cook. Would you like me to put some music on so you can continue you….erm...dancing?”
The only man I’ve ever been attracted to, and he comes with a bloody contract, a flogger, and a whole world of issues. Well, at least I got my way this weekend. I flush at the memory of his hands and his mouth on me, his body inside mine. Closing my eyes, I can still feel the soreness of my muscle inside me. My cock is fully hard now. I want to do that again and again. Maybe if I just sign up for sex….would he go with that? I suspect not.
“Grandma! We’re home!” Teddy shouts and takes his shoes off. He lifts his head when there’s no answer and looks around. “Grandma!”
“This is your house Leo. Me and your papa rebuilt it and made it our home. You’ll grow up here, with more brothers and sisters hopefully. But let's not mention that to papa just yet, eh?” I whisper to him.
I wander back to my bedroom. This is too much to think about. I need a clear head - a fresh morning approach to the problem. I put the offending documents in my backpack. Tomorrow…. Tomorrow is another day. Clambering into bed, I switch off the light and lie staring up at the canopy. Oh, I wish I’d never met him. I shake my head. I know that’s a lie. I have never felt as alive as I do now.
I finally get up the courage to move away and head back downstairs. I promised Teddy I’d come round today. I apparate instead of using the floo because I’m running low on powder and need to save it in case of emergencies. When i get to the front door I’m about to knock when it’s opened by Lottie and then all I see is a flash of bright blue and then I’m tackled.
He stands back to gaze at me. I’m naked for Merlin’s sake. I flush crimson and stare down at my hands, and I desperately want to disappear into the hot water and foam, but I know he won’t want that.
“Well… nobody anymore. Almost everyone who knew them is gone now. But a lot of people told me about them in the past, so I just remember. I remember everything everyone told me and when I miss then, I just think of those memories.” He hugs me then.
“Please.” He puts his hands together like he’s praying. So I get my wand out and turn some of the huge mountains of bubbles into horses. They fly out of the water and gallop around Teddy and then over to me. Teddy loves it when I make bubble animals and he asks for horses quite a lot.
“Obey me in all things. Yes, I want you to do that. I need you to do that. Think of it as role-play, Draco.”
“To Paris?” I say, my voice a bit too high. “Of course, who wouldn't?” I ask. “But Rome is where I would really like to go.” I say daydreamily. He cocks his head to one side and runs his finger over his lips. Oh Merlin…
“Have you got any names for the little guy?” Katie asks while she examines Draco again for the afterbirth.
The stairs were centered in the middle of the house. So straight across was the first bedroom. It was medium size and had a small en-suite. It was at the back of the house and didn’t need a lot of work done.
“Actually, the reason she did this was kinda sweet.” That made Draco look at me like I was nuts. “I know, I know. But here me out. She thought back to how much I enjoyed sorting grimmauld place out and clearing it out to make it my own. She thought that's what I’d want to do again, with you, for our family. She figured we’d get to spend more time together and get to talk more and laugh more. She really didn’t mean to hurt you dragon.” Draco blushed at his pet name and punched my shoulder lightly for it.
“Good! I’m so glad. Hermione’s fine, she’s her usual self except with a bigger belly and occasional sickness. It’s shit that Draco has it so bad.” I agree with him.
“Firstly, if you don’t want your wand tracked, then put a charm on it.” He snaps back at me and I shrink a little bit. “And secondly, if I hadn’t of been there, then you probably would have been waking up in the photographer's bed. And from what I remember, you weren’t entirely thrilled by his advances.” He is glaring at me furiously. And for some reason I burst out laughing.
“Wrong? Not to me.” He shakes his head, he looks so sincere. “Try it,” he whispers. A challenge, daring me, and he cocks his head to one side and smiles his crooked, dazzling smile.
“Cum for me, Draco.” he whispers breathlessly, and I unravel at his words, exploding between us as I orgasm and splinter into a million pieces underneath him. And as he comes, he calls out my name, thrusting hard, then stilling as he empties himself into me.
“Oh no, you don’t.” Harry threatens. “You can wear something of mine.” He’s slipped on a white t-shirt and runs his hand through his just-fucked hair. In spite of my anxiety, I lose my train of thought. His beauty is derailing.
Ron gets the beers out then and by the time I get home it’s way past 11. Hermione had long gone to bed and me and Ron had sat talking and drinking just like old times. I told him how the house was going, about Nia, about going to Hogwarts (which he was a bit jealous about), about thinking of quitting the aurors (which he wasn’t to happy about but he understood), but mainly we talking about our pregnant partners and how excited yet terrified we were about becoming dads. It was nice to talk to him again just us and we agreed to do it again soon. Maybe everything was going to be okay after all.
“Mr Malfoy. How nice to hear from you.” In that moment his voice changed entirely. He sounds surprised and….warm—seductive even. My breath hitches and I blush. Then I remember Pansy is right next to me and I get up and head into the kitchen, trying to avoid her unwanted scrutiny.
“Yeah I just need a minute.” He looked up and saw that I wasn’t buying his bullshit. “Healer Bell just said that the baby is taking a lot of my magic, and that if I do a lot then I will feel tired. But it’s fine honestly, stop worrying.” He got up then and did a sort of half bow. “See, completely fine now.” And kissed my cheek. “Come on.”
“What?! When did he start taking the potions? Why didn’t you tell me? Wait, why are you upset?” She asks one after another.
I walk quietly towards him, enticed by the sublime, melancholy music. I’m mesmerised, watching his long, skilled fingers as they find and gently press the keys, thinking how the same fingers have expertly handled and caressed my body. I slush and gasp at the memory. He glances up, his unfathomable green eyes bright, his expression unreadable.
I lavishly sign on the dotted line of both copies and hand one back to him. I fold the other up and put it in my backpack. I then take another gulp of wine. I am sounding so much braver than I’m actually feeling.
“Draco, it doesn't matter if it’s legal or not. It represents an arrangement that I would like to make with you - what I would like from you and what you can expect from me. If you don't like it, then don't sign. If you do sign and then decide you don't like it, there are enough get-out clauses so you can walk away. Even if it were legally binding, do you think I’d drag you through the courts and in front of the Wizengamot, if you decide to run?”
When she had finished she was still looking out the window but I could see her tears in the reflection. She turned around and pulled the sleeve of her jacket off to reveal big splinch scars, a bit like Rons. Her own magic must have been fighting her dad’s when he apparated her and so she got splinched. How she healed though, I don’t know. She must have been very powerful even then to do it herself without even knowing how.
I put my tea bag in my cup of hot water and watch it change colour. It reminds me of my mind, a whirl.
“I’m sorry too. But I hadn’t told Luna or Ginny. Hermione only knew because she was there when me and Draco had fallen out. That day you broke my door down.” I chuckle at that and so does he.
The submissive will not drink to excess, smoke, take recreational drugs or potions, or put himself in any unnecessary danger.
“You okay?” I whisper to him while Katie is busy. He shakes his head and is breathing deeply. Not bad enough to panic but I’m still worried. “Calm down, I’m here. What’s wrong?” He looks at me with pleading eyes.
When we got to the cafe, I opened the door for Draco to go in first. To which he just laughed and shoved me through. We sat at the same table we sat at last time by the window. I looked over and saw Nia chatting with another customer. Good, she was here and by the way she was smiling at us she didn’t have a clue we were on to her. After the customer had left Nia came over to us.
When I wake, it’s still dark. I have no idea how long I’ve slept. I stretch out beneath the duvet, and I feel sore, deliciously sour, and realise Harry must have cast a cleaning spell on me. Harry is nowhere to be seen though. I sit up, staring out at London in front of me. There are fewer lights on among the streets, and there’s a whisper of dawn in the east. I hear music. The lilting notes of the piano, a sad, sweet lament. Bach, I think, but I’m not sure.
“Good.” He smiles. “Now term. One month instead of three is no time at all, especially if you want a weekend away from me each month. I don't think I’ll be able to stay away from you for that length of time. I can barely manage it now.” He pauses.
I move out of Blaise’s arms and stand up from the table. Whoa, head spin. I nearly fall back down but grab the back of the chair just in time. I chuckle and make my way to the bar. I stagger over and of course there's a queue. I reach for my phone out of boredom. I look at my last calls and realise one of them is Potter. I chuckle and think of calling him. I could ask him about the books and what was with the cryptic message. If he wants me to stay away from him then he should fuck off. I drunkenly grin at myself and press call. He answers on the second ring.
“I don’t know. I think it’s a warning. He keeps doing that, warning me off. I don’t know why because it’s not like I’m banging on his door.” I frown.
“We wanted to give you our present first Teddy. Close your eyes.” Instead of closing them, he opens them wide and holds his hands out.
He is currently at his and I’m meeting him there at 5. I won't give him his present until later though.
“Oh, I exercise control in all things, Mr Malfoy.” He says this within any humour in his smile. I look at him and he gazes back steadily, impassively. My heart starts beating faster and I blush again.
“I need to be alone.” And left, presumably to go back to the barn. Draco got up and went to go after her but I held him back.
Teddy is playing with little lucy, who turned one last month, and Freddie and Molly II. While Bills kids, victoire, Dominique and Louis, are all playing together with Hermione. She has done the patronus charm and her otter is chasing them around. Nia is talking with Angelina and fluer, while Percy and Audrey are talking to molly and Arthur. Narcissa and Andy are standing off together watching Teddy playing. Bill, George, and Ron are setting up more fireworks. And me and Draco are sitting at the table, cuddled up together, watching everyone.
“Oh dear, I do hope he’s okay Harry.” She looks worried now and I curse myself for telling her about the mediwitch.
I shrug. “No one’s really, you know….” Come up to scratch, only you. And you turn out to be some kind of monster. “Why are you so angry with me?” I whisper.
“Well...well because of our past, or maybe because we are both men, or maybe because they don’t think I deserve uncle Harry.” Draco tells him with a twinge of sadness in his voice.
We all start cleaning as nothing in here actually needs to be magically fixed. Nia is asking all these questions about magic and learning and flying.
“Baby’s looking very healthy, Draco. You’ve got nothing to worry about.” Katie said to Draco after finishing with the examination. We had seen another scan and Katie said she would print more pictures for us. “How are you feeling now?”
“I got bored at the house, so I went to see Teddy and Andy.” I said calmly, while magically getting rid of the smashed glass behind me.
“We have a son.” I repeat Draco’s words. I kiss Leo’s head and my tears drop into his hair. Which I then get a look at and start laughing. “He has your hair.” I turn my watery smile to draco and leans against my other arm. We stay there for a while just enjoying the moment.
“You spoke to my mother behind my back!” He cuts me off and pulls his hand away. I reel back slightly confused.
“Draco please, this is important. Do you want to have Leo at st mungos or at our home or at the manor or at grimmauld? That’s your choices.”
“Bye Andy, we should only be a couple of hours, I'll send a patronus when we are on our way back.” I say and wink at her so she’ll know when to pack up.
We land on the edge of Hogwarts and the breeze catches us straight away. The beginnings of summer in the wind. I turn to say something to Harry but stop and stare instead. He is looking at Hogwarts with all the wonder of a child. For a fleeting moment he seems his age: young, carefree, and heart-stoppingly beautiful. He turns to me and grins. Is this the key to him? Hogwarts?
Too obvious, Malfoy! And I remember that he could sue if I disclose too much. Ha, what’s he going to do - take all my money? I must remember to search up ‘penalties for breaching a nondisclosure agreement’ while I’m doing the rest of my ‘research’. It’s like I’ve been given a school assignment. Maybe I’ll be graded. I blush, remembering my A for this morning’s bath experiment.
“That’s so much better.” Draco says as soon as he is chest high in. Teddy is swimming next to me and I have one hand out in case he needs me. He won't though because he’s a good swimmer and we aren’t going any further out. I go round the back of draco and he leans on me. “God this feels so good. Why didn’t we do this before?” Draco asks dazily.
When I arrive back at the castle I ring Blaise on my way back to the room and explain the situation.
“JUST, TEDDY DID SOMETHING THAT HIS MUM USED TO DO AND IT HIT ME HARDER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD.” I tell him because I know I will tell him sooner or later anyway, may as well be sooner.
“Harry, Draco! Glad you boys could make it.” She hugs each of us and then pushes us together and gets a look as usual. She again stops on Draco’s midsection and looks up at him. “Draco honey, I’m going to be telling you to stop eating soon, rather than be eating more. Putting on a little podge I see.” Then she taps his belly. At this point I can practically feel his rage, but he could never shout at Molly. “To many takeaways with Harry maybe?” She questions and chuckles, not knowing what she’s done. Draco shoves me away and then points at me while screaming.
“Nobody is ready to leave their past behind Harry.” She says dreamily. “And this house is a huge part of your past. Too huge though. I look at this house Harry, and do you know what I see?” She asks but doesn’t wait for a response. “I see the war. I see Voldemort, and Dumbledore. I see unforgivable curses and dead friends.” She stops for a second and I think she may be crying. But so am I and I can’t talk right now.
I finally made it to the estate agent and Hermione had already rang and told them I was on my way to put a deposit down. I was so excited and confident in Hermione that I nearly didn’t even look at pictures. But when she pulled them out of the wallet I was nearly bouncing with excitement and happiness. I could really see us living here, all of us as a family.
“Come on. I think we both need a nap.” I start pulling him to the stairs and he doesn’t hesitate for a second.
“Fine. Harry I know I fucked up, but it wasn’t for the reasons you said.” He looks at me with pleading eyes. There is rain dripping down his face through his eyelashes and down his sharp cheekbones.
“Why are you sorry. I basically caused you to have a, what was it, a panic attack.” He says slowly, trying the name out for the first time.
“I won’t tell him I know Harry, I swear it. I will wait until he tells me, I know how stressful this can be on both parties. I have no cause to create more stress for you and my son. But…. well, congratulations.”
As I’m walking back towards Hermione and Ron, they both point behind me and I see Draco running off around the house. I throw my hands up and sigh. I turn back around and go after him.
I move my hand up and down with a firm grip. He closes his eyes again, and his breath hitches in his throat. When he opens them again, his gaze is scorching green.
“Umm — no.” Oh dear, is blonde number one in trouble? The guy in front of me turns to blonde number one and frowns at her. She jumps up immediately.
“Do you know which potion is for morning sickness?” I ask him while still looking at the bottles, trying to identify anything.
“S-sure.” I stutter, completely thrown by this. I glance at Pansy and blush, she just grins at me and winks. Then I notice Blaise, he is scowling.
I frown at him and sit back a bit. What the fuck is his problem. What has it got to do with him anyway? I'm not his, and that's his fault.
“I’d never do anything I didn’t want to do, Harry.” As I say these words, I don’t quite feel their conviction, because at this moment in time, I’d probably do anything for this man standing in front of me. But this does the trick. He seems satisfied.
“Ron, I’m so sorry. It just slipped out and I was really talking about you and me. But I shouldn’t-“ he puts his hand on my shoulder and stops me.
“We're here.” His look is intense, half in shadow and half in the bright light of the street light. Dark knight and white knight, it's a fitting metaphor for Harry. He looks strained. His jaw is clenched and his eyes are tight. He undoes the spell that was keeping me secure and holds my face in his hands. His face is inches from mine.
Pansy and I concentrate on packing, sharing a bottle of cheap red wine as we do. When I finally go to bed, having almost finished packing my room, I feel calmer. The physical activity of boxing everything up has been a welcome distraction, and I’m tired. I want a good night’s rest. I snuggle into my bed, try to wandlessly turn off the lights but it doesn't work - I will keep trying to do at least one wandless spell, and shock Harry - and am soon asleep.
“I can’t hear anything, are you sure your not just fat?” He says to Draco. By the look of Draco, Teddy has been asking a lot of questions like that.
We have been really good friends all through Hogwarts, but I know that Blaise likes me way more. He’s cute and funny, but he's more like the brother I never had. Pansy is always teasing me about it, and the fact that I’ve never had a boyfriend really. But I just haven’t found anyone who…. well, who I’m attracted to, even though part of me longs for the kind of butterflies-in-my-belly moments.
We chat for a bit longer and then Hermione says she has to get back to work. We say our goodbyes and she goes through the floo.
“Merlin, I’m exhausted.” Draco says and lies down on the sofa. I lift his feet up and sit down, placing them in my lap.
I am so proud of her at that moment, my errant thoughts of Harry pushed to one side. Even though I have heard her speech before, I listen carefully. She commands the room and takes her audience with her.
“Remember when he wouldn't even come to these dinners? And now look at him. One of the family.” I look at Ron looking at Draco and Hermione, and smile at him. That really surprised me coming from Ron. He was always supportive towards me and Draco but I think this is the first time he’s called him family. I will definitely be remembering this moment for a long long time.
We go through the kitchen and open the patio doors. I hadn’t done much to the back garden yet and was waiting till I did the stables. But as we step out, my breath leaves me.
“Harry. Draco!” Hermione shouts over from one of the benches placed around the garden. We go over and Ron gets up and gives me a hug and then surprisingly gives Draco one too.
“Let me go first Harry. I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have acted like that. Hermione said that you were going to tell me that night and just hadn’t had a chance before Luna blurted it out. I was just a little hurt that she had known and Ginny and Hermione but you hadn’t told me.” He looks down at his hands.
I get her settled in a chair at the kitchen table, which was put up yesterday. Then I open the first box I see and it’s filled with plates and bowls. So I start unpacking.
Me and Draco had crashed as soon as we had gotten in last night from the burrow. It had been late and so we had slept in a bit this morning. It was almost 11 by the time we were ready to go to the house. Me and Draco had started calling it our haven. But Draco has been calling it something in French, ‘Notre coeur’. I have no idea what he’s saying but I hope it’s nice.
“I’ll….ermm, see you inside.” Blaise mutters and slips back into the building. We both ignore him. Now I’m on my own with Potter though. Shit. What do I say? Should I apologise for the phone call…..and the vomit.
“Hello!  Yep. Where is uncle Draco? Has he had cherry yet?” He says instead of chéri which he has obviously forgotten how to say.
Beautiful. I blush with pleasure. Harry Potter thinks I’m beautiful. I knot my fingers together, staring at them hard, trying to conceal my grin. Perhaps he’s farsighted.
“Thank you, that was sweet of you. I’m feeling better now but I’m still going to take it just in case.” I smile at him and sit down next to him.
“Okay.” I say as casually as possible and carry on with my moving and kissing every inch of his beautiful pale neck.
“After you passed out, I didn’t know where your room was and I needed to keep an eye on you to make sure you didn’t throw up again, so I brought you through the floo to my hotel.”
The next day I wake up at 12. The party is at 4 so I have plenty of time to get ready. I have a banging headache and go get some sobering potion. I take it and then jump straight in the shower.
“Absolutely.” Teddy says happily. “Does that mean me and grandma won the guessing game? Because we did guess James.”I laugh and ruffle his hair.
“What?!” He manages to say before he gags and  throws up again. He’s sat on the floor with his head practically in the toilet. I wish I could help him with this.
“Merlin Harry, I love you so much.” He whispered back while snuggling in. Maybe this would work out after all. Maybe he really did love me. And maybe he really did want a house, and kids, and to be a family. I smiled to myself and drifted back off to sleep more comfortably on the couch, squished with Draco, than spread out on my own. The next morning was made up of breakfast in bed (because we’d somehow ended up in my bed last night), lots of apologises from both of us, great make up sex, and some planning for our future together.
“Yes well it’s always good to be prepared and prove you wrong at the same time. Now, I’m going to get a shower and get ready to redecorate more of our lovely home.” He says on his way out, then stops at the door and looks over his shoulder flirtingly. “You’re welcome to join me in the shower oh great Gryffindor.” He says the last bit just to get back at me, then walks off. Well I’m certainly not going to say no to that.
“What’s vanilla sex?” I ask, if anything to distract myself from the intense, burning, sexy look he’s giving me. He laughs.
“Do you do this to people or do they do it to you?” I whisper. His mouth quirks up, either amused or relieved. He blinks a couple of times then, considering his answer.
My head buzzes and starts to hurt. I squirt my eyes. What the hell has that got to do with him? I didn’t invite him here. He sounds like someone scolding a child. I want to argue with him and tell him if I want to drink like this every night then I bloody well can - but I don’t have the energy and I certainly don’t have any gryffindor courage at this moment. My alcohol infused brain wonders a bit then and I think of asking Potter what house he was in. Got to be Gryffindor right? Or maybe slytherin? Ravenclaw?
As soon as we arrive, Molly comes to greet us. It’s just a small tea today with Molly, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Luna. Arthur is working late tonight so couldn’t make it, which doesn’t bother Molly as long as she has someone to cook for.
I look at the house as we pass and it looks comfortable and homey. I can imagine Harry as a child running around the garden with Theo, and Lily calling them in for tea. It’s sweet.
“So remember every 5 minutes, lasting 1 minute each, for over an hour. Got it? Keep him hydrated and comfortable. Male labours tend to last a while. Oh and try to get food down him if you can but don’t worry.” I nod to all this and then head back upstairs to the cupboard for fresh sheets. As I’m shutting the door, Nia comes down the stairs rubbing her eyes.
After Leo’s first feed, I am just putting him back in his Moses basket when Teddy opens the door and pops his head in.
Later that night we tuck Teddy in bed after giving him a bath with bubble horses. Then Draco goes to feed Leo and I read Teddy a story.
They go off and presumably tell everyone because by the time we get to the present opening, nearly everyone has congratulated us and looked at the ring.
My hands are on the brick wall of the flower bed but are hardly holding me up. I’m exhausted and need to lie down but something else is holding me up. That something then passes me a monogrammed handkerchief and vanishes all the vomit on the floor and walls. I cannot even look at him, I am so embarrassed. I’m disgusted in myself and swamped with shame. I feel like crying but don’t have the energy.
“Thanks for trying to be quiet Molly. We really appreciate it.” I tell her and she kisses my cheek. We all get sat down and Draco passes Leo to Molly.
“Oh Harry. I’m sure it’s just the hormones. It’s a big thing to find out especially if you’re not expecting it and don’t think it’s possibly. I’m sure all he wants is for you to be with him but he’s too stubborn and you know it.” She's probably right. “Stay here, i'll be back in a minute.” She walked out the kitchen and I heard the floo go. I had started picking at the eggs in front of me when I hear the floo go again and then a voice.
“Draco, I don't want to go there at the moment.” He closes his eyes, looking pained. “I’ve been worried about you.”
“Oh you're in the house now then?” She says excitedly. I roll my eyes at her and smile, she drops her excitement then “what?”
The quote is from Tess. From the novels of Thomas Hardy, whom I have just spent 3 hours writing about. I inspect the inside of the three volumes of Tess of the d’Urbervilles, and find that they are first edition.
“Phew it works. Hey little cub. Is your grandma in? Can I come through?” I ask even though I know Teddy wouldn't be in the house alone.
“Ermm…...yes. I have my jacket with everything in. Harry please, I need to tell Pansy. She will worry.” I tell him still very drunk.
“Don’t you dare touch me!” He turns back around and carries on towards the floo. People turn to look and start whispering.
“Harry-“ He whispers and collapses against me. I manage to catch him after he had fallen to his knees.
“Oh just open it.” I roll my eyes at him and smirk. He stares at it with wide eyes and then opens it slowly and for a second his face drops. Did he think it was a ring?! Is he ready?!
“What kind of books do you like to read?” He cocks his head to one side, listening intently. Why is he so interested in me?
“Hmm, don’t you mean a nest of broken things, and on top. That cat is king of any castle.” I agree and we both chuckle.
Now, however, as we both stand there in a total state of shock, I’m distantly playing the screaming match I’m going to have with Hermione in my head. She is so dead. I slowly look over at Draco to try and gauge his reaction. I know what he’s seeing because I’m seeing it for the first time and it does not look good. While I’m planning hermiones murder, Draco is definelty planning mine, and this time I’m not sure I don’t blame him. This is like a completely different house to what I saw in the pictures and what I was imagining. The first thing was the door which is hanging loosely off the hinges and has cracks all through just the back of it which was quite convenient for the photos they showed me at the estate agency. We’re probably going to need a new door. The next thing was the floors, well the lack of floor would be more accurate. Whoever had lived here before had decided to take up all the wood flooring with them and leave us to deal with the rest. Next was the fact that where the rest of the doors should have been were just empty passages. Note to self - find out how much doors for a whole house costs (probably not cheap). As I stood there and thought that was all for now, I looked around to Draco but stopped half way and looked at the stairs. What was there was mostly okay actually but every couple of steps one was missing and just had a hole instead. The steps that were left I wouldn’t trust not to fall right through, they were definitely not safe. This was a nightmare and this was only the hall!
“Yeah, I think I’m going to go have a cup of tea with my mother and go to bed, I’m knackered.” We kiss goodbye and he leaves. Then I take a deep breath and floo to Ron’s.
He takes my hand again and leads me to the dance floor. Shit, I don’t do dancing. I try to pull back and he looks at me. He looks slightly amused for a minute and then suddenly I’m in his arms and we are dancing. Holy shit, can he dance!
We wait patiently for a minute and then a multicoloured light appears on Draco’s stomach. Its changing colours fast but getting slower and slower by the second. Draco closes his eyes and squeezes my hand. Then the light stops changing colours and stays at a yellow.
“That I have called this place home since we bought it, but never managed to call grimmauld home. It was always that, ‘grimmauld’.”  I tell him. He swims slowly up to me, where my legs are in the water.
“That sounds great. Thank you professor! Nia will be so happy, and Draco too.” I laugh at how surprised he’s going to be.
“Sleep, sweet Draco.” he murmurs, and I close my eyes, but I can’t help feel residual melancholy either from the music or his demeanour. Harry Potter has a sad side.
For my birthday, Draco, Hermione and Ron took me and Teddy to the beach. Me and Draco love the beach and we love to swim. The first time Draco called me Harry was when we were swimming with Teddy at the local swimming baths.
“I don’t subscribe to luck or chance, Mr Malfoy. The harder I work the more luck I seem to have. It really is all about having the right people on your team and directing their energies accordingly.”
I head outside but don’t see anyone, so I go back in and take a wonder through the house. I open the door to the office and stare. Ron and Draco are both in here, laughing and playing chess.
Rolling his eyes, Draco conceded. “Alright, but we are not spending all night dissecting our relationship.”
Malfoy was laying on his side, a stream of moonlight highlighting the curve of his neck. Harry’s breath caught and Malfoy rolled over, eyes fluttering open.
Harry hummed thoughtfully. “It’s different seeing it play out in front of you than it is to just remember it in your mind, I guess.”
Harry slipped out of his side of the booth and onto Draco’s, though it wasn’t meant to fit more than one person. After a quick glance around (only because he figured that Draco wouldn’t be keen if there were onlookers) he wrapped one arm around Draco’s shoulders and his other around Draco’s head, so he could guide his head down onto his shoulder. Harry pressed a firm kiss to Draco’s temple and let his lips linger there.
“Hah! I knew it,” Harry didn’t know why he was teasing Malfoy. They hardly knew one another well enough for it. But he couldn’t help it. And with the adorably rattled look on Malfoy’s face, Harry couldn’t bring himself to regret it.
Gandalf barked excitedly at the door, his forked tail slapping Kreacher’s spindly legs. Another desolate knock sounded on the door.
Harry hummed, clasping his hands between his knees and looking down at them. That sounded like one lead, not ‘several’. After a moment he looked back at Longeman, with his best pierce-into-your-soul gaze. “Are you looking into anyone who may have wanted to hurt Draco Malfoy?”
Something in Harry’s demeanor tipped Malfoy off. “He’s awake,” he informed Hermione. “Will you ask if he’d like me to take Gandalf or if he’d rather have him at home when he goes back?”
Malfoy gave him a reluctant smile in response. “I’ll admit you do the vast majority of the cooking. Breakfast for dinner is about the most I can manage. Usually, anyways,” he chuckled lowly and something sparked in Harry’s abdomen. “Now I think of it, that’s probably why it’s your favourite. Just to humour me.”
An exasperated huff of air escaped Draco. “You’ve been silencing yourself? That explains it. You don’t need to apologize Harry. We are well practiced in dealing with one another’s nightmares.”
The crup crawled right up Harry’s lap until his paws rested on Harry’s chest and he could swipe his tongue eagerly across Harry’s face. Harry looked up to see Ron and Hermione studying him for signs of recognition. He sighed and shook his head, before standing up. Harry had opted for Malfoy to leave the crup, figuring that the company would be nice. Harry had always wanted a dog.
These were some of the first scenes I imagined for this story but I had the hardest time deciding what order they should go in the plot, so hopefully it feels like it flows okay! I finally feel like I'm getting my groove back, so hopefully posts will be a little more frequent (though I definitely can't promise anything, sorry!)
“Penny for your thoughts?” Potter says, startling me. He’s hovering our things in the air between us.
Suddenly there is a pop of apparition behind us and I spin around going for my wand. But it’s just a worried looking Andy and a crying Teddy.
I get out of the castle and let the cold wind hit me. It cools me down and allows me to think. I look down the hill and I see Hagrid's hut, there is smoke coming out the chimney so he must be in. Before I can make a decision, my feet have started to walk me towards it. I get there and knock on the door. Fang starts barking immediately and I back up slightly.
“Oh...by the way, I’m wearing your underwear.” I give him a small smile and pull up the waistband of the boxers I’m wearing so he can see. Harry’s mouth drops open, shocked. What a great reaction. My mood shifts immediately, and I sashay into the alleyway, apparating to the edge of Hogwarts.
“May I hold her please Audrey?” He asked and Audrey was more than grateful by the looks of it because she handed her straight over.
“Merlin, you are such a disciplinarian.” I hiss and cross my arms over my chest like a teenager being told off by their parents.
“How do I do that?” My mouth is dry and I wish I’d had more wine. Okay, I understand the pleasing bit, but I am puzzled by the Elizabethan-torture setup. Do I want to know the answer?
Draco finishes the table decorations while I’m playing with Leo. He points to the duck pond and I walk him over.
“Thank you.” He says to her and then smirks at me. He shows me what’s inside and I get why he smirked. It's a tiny silver bangle with a tiny snake running around it.
“We run an excellent internship program here.” He says this quietly and if I knew better I’d say nervously. My eyebrows shut up in surprise. Is he offering me a job?
“Like… like what if we never get to meet the baby? What if the little cherry dies before their born? What if I do something to harm it? Or what if it’s born and then gets taken away from us?” Saying these things out loud has made him go worse again and he’s almost hysterical now. But now he’s said them, I’m thinking about them. What if we never get to hold our baby like we held Lucy. I can feel wetness on my cheeks and know I’m crying now too.
“Really good thanks Ron. How are you two?” I ask him and me and draco sit on the bench next to theirs. It is placed at a right angle so we can all see each other.
“Well you look very smart if i do say so. Now are you sure you’ve tried everything on this hair of yours?” She tried stroking it down once again as if it was going to work the fifth time. I just laughed and pulled away to look at the clock. It was nearly 5 and he would be here soon.
It’s been exactly a week since me and Draco had that fight and Ron’s party was tomorrow. I hadn’t heard off Draco since and I have just been throwing myself into work. I've not told anyone what happened really, just that me and Draco might be taking a break for a little while. I’m not going to tell them that Draco is embarrassed to be seen with them, it would just make them upset as well as me. And I don’t want to upset them, I love them. Hermione is utterly confused and wants to know what really happened but I just can’t tell her.
“Well that is certainly helping! You're doing great! You’ll have graduated in no time.” I joke with her.
Sometimes I think maybe there is something wrong with me. Maybe I’ve spent too long reading romance novels and now my ideals and expectations are far too high for any guy to overcome. Nobody has made it so far.
“Goodbye Draco, and happy birthday.” She whispers to him. “Take care of that grandchild of mine, and if I don’t see you before, I will see you on Saturday.”
I open my eyes and roll onto my side to look at him. He looks so peaceful and so damn beautiful. He’s on his back with one hand above him under the pillow and the other one resting on his belly. I stare at his stomach for a minute, trying to imagine it in a few months when it’s huge. I’m a little nervous, if I’m honest, about this whole baby thing. But it's happened and I’m sticking with him no matter what. I want to put my hand next to his on his belly but I don’t know if Draco would be okay with it, so I leave it for now and return to look at his face. Only this time, his eyes are open. A blush a bit from being caught staring and give him a long loving kiss.
“Probably worse considering you are his daddy.” He smirks at me. I kiss him and then watch Rose for a bit.
“You don’t have to do all that Harry.” He said hunching his shoulder and looking down, “I’m sorry I’m being such a pain.” He started walking towards one of the rooms but was soon stopped by my hand.
“Hey,” I put my hand on his shoulder and unlike Nia, he doesn’t shake it off. “We have time to take Teddy to the flower park, if you're up for it?” He brightened noticeably at that, I know he loves coming to the park with us when he has a chance.
“You’ll have to do better than that Potter!” He snapped and took his hand back. I stood there in complete shock for a minute until I noticed he had paused going to grab more floo powder.
“Hi, Draco.” He smiles at me and his blue eyes twinkle. I like him already. He is obviously nothing like Harry, but then they are adopted brothers.
He eases back with exquisite slowness. And he closes his eyes and groans, and then thrusts into me. I cry out again, and he stills.
“Harry that’s awesome!” Hermione had taken on some of Ron's laid back language since they had been spending so much time together and I just loved it and it made me laugh to myself. She pulled back and looked at me.
“Water and iPods - not a clever combination.” he murmurs. Then he blinks and suddenly my clothes vanish. Really! All it takes is a blink!
The front room is almost complete. Just this cabinet to get up and then personal things like photos and our tv from Grimmauld to put in and we are done.
“Are you kidding me! You guys don’t need to apologise.” She looks up with a tear smudge face at both of us. “This is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.  My dad always taught me wizards were bad but you guys have been nothing but nice since I met you. I don’t deserve all this.” She points around the room and continues to cry into her hands.
“Draco, it's a bloody mess up there! I can barely find anything-“ I stop there when I see Draco. He’s sitting at the kitchen table sobbing his heart out. I rush over and kneel down.
“So you do love him! Oh gosh Harry, that’s wonderful.” She says before I know what I’ve done. I smack my forehead with my hand and groan.
“Oh Harry. Why do you do this to yourself?” She sits on the end of my bed and I roll over so she can’t see my face. “Talk to me please Harry. I’m your friend. Me and Ron are worried to death about you.” She says and I can hear the tears in her voice.
“I’m ready!” I didn’t get any duck feed from grimmauld, where I have a big sack waiting for days I see Teddy,  so we’ll have to go buy some more first and maybe a treat for Teddy while we’re there.
Just then, he jumps down off me and looks at me with wide horrified eyes. He opens his mouth but instead of saying anything he abruptly turns around, grabs his broom off the floor and apparates out.
We had finally finished Nia’s loft last week. We had painted the slanted roof navy blue with yellow stars and a moon. Draco had put a charm on it so that the stars twinkle and every so often a shooting star appears. Then with the moon he had done it so it changes from full to crescent as it does in the sky. The rest of the walls were a golden yellow and had emerald leaves dotted about which Draco charmed to sway like in a breeze.
“No! She’s going to tell me cherry’s dead! I know she is, because that’s what I deserve!” Draco has gone backwards with his progress of blaming himself since the pregnancy and it’s starting to worry me.
“Yeah Hermione, I think I really do.” I grabbed her hands and gave them a small squeeze and smiled down at her.
“It will be all ours in just 2 weeks!” I declared while smiling at Draco who hadn’t said a word or even blinked since I started. He looked kind of pale actually and was breathing kind of heavily, “hey, you oka-“
“You just need all your little nick nacks now and the tv.” I agree and sit down next to her. “Where did you say Draco was?”
“Okay fine whatever Hermione, can you just leave us alone for now please.” She looked about to sob again but lifted her chin and said
“Oh Harry, sorry. I was just looking around...and...and. Well this is quite a collection of rare books you have.” He strokes a few book spines along a shelf.
Draco is on his front on his bed, sobbing his heart out. I go up to the bed and slowly place my hand on his back. He jumps slightly and looks to see who it is. I think he is expecting his mother though because he quickly turns back around and shouts into the pillow.
When he is finished explaining everything that Harry has probably told him he has to, he huffs again, makes me sign a delivery note and then apparates out without even a bye. I want to laugh. Pansy whistles, impressed when she sees it.
“It’s quick, it’s easy, and it’s something different for you to feel and experience. I know they’re quite brutal, and I do like that in a restraining device.” He smiles at me mildly. “Very effective at keeping you in your place.”
“I know.” he says, and for a split second sweet, young, carefree Harry is back. It warms my heart. He’s so excited. Boys and their toys. I roll my eyes at him but can’t stifle my smile. He opens the door for me and I climb in. whoa...it’s low. He moves around the car with easy grace, and folds his long frame elegantly in beside me. How does he do that?
I blanch. Wait what? I hadn’t factored this in as a response. I just shrug because I don’t really know.
“Yeah, brilliant. We got a picture if you wanna see?” I ask her and dig into my pocket to find the scan, but it isn’t there. I must have left it in my other coat and the spare one is next to the bed.
“That’s a shame. Those apples from the tree in the back, that were in that apple pie, were bloody delicious.” He licks his lips just thinking about it. I laugh at him and shove him forward.
“Hi Harry.” They say back and continue whispering together. I go through to the kitchen to find Hermione cooking.
“Pansy.” Harry says and gives her a polite nod and then glares at Theo. Theo grins back and gets up to give me a hug.
“You have already interviewed me, remember. And I remember some quite probing questions.” He smirks. I blush. He didn’t even answer those questions though and they weren’t mine anyway. I feel embarrassed and start babbling.
“I suspended him from my playroom ceiling. In fact, that’s one of your questions. Suspension - that’s what the carabiners are for in the playroom. Rope play. One of the ropes was tied too tightly.”
“I said yes, it's happened a few times.” Seeing my face is starting to panic he’s quick to assure me. “Just over the last few weeks and it seems to be getting better, so no need to worry.”
“Oohhh Harry! Draco, hello dears. I’m so sorry! Draco, well done sweetie! Congratulations. Let’s have a look at him then.” She says and comes over, stroking Teddy on the cheek.
Molly stays in the kitchen to clean up and I take our plates up. As I’m on the landing, I can hear Hermione and Draco talking in hushed worried voices. I sneak to where I can hear them and listen.
We finish at 1 and I scourgify all of us clean of paint. Draco came down about half an hour ago and started helping. I help him up and take him and Teddy back to grimmauld to get changed.
“Why on earth would I be mad? I was sick of you coming back injured and you were constantly in a mood because your mind was always on one case or another. I love having you home. It might just be me but...well I think we have become closer these last few weeks.” He smiles shyly at me now.
“Mr Snape, it’s a pleasure to meet you,” Harry says smoothly, warmly, completely unflustered by Pansy’s introduction. He holds out his hand, which Severus, all credit to him, takes, not showing a hint of the drop-dead surprise he’s just had thrust upon him.
“How old were you when you were adopted?” I ask him because now my interest is piqued and I want to know more.
We all get to talking about what Teddy wants to do for his birthday and other chit chat and finish our tea. Then we go into the sitting area and light the fire. It’s cozy and warm and we’re a family, with one more coming in 7 months or so. That reminds me that I need to ask Draco when the baby is actually due. Me and Andy have a small whiskey each and she offers Draco one.
“Oh wow, Harry it’s beautiful.” Andy says and takes a step inside. Then Teddy runs in and climbs on the rocking chair, moving the dragon teddy into his lap. He starts rocking really fast so I rush in and hold it still.
“Okay, if your friend would like to step away from you while I do the spell.” I release her hand and step back. As soon as it’s done I step back in.
Feeling better about myself, I tie my hair up in a bun and head for the door. I take a deep breath and open it, ready to face Mr Confusing. To my relief he isn’t in the bedroom. I look around for my jacket but can’t find it. I hope he didn’t vanish that too. I take another deep breath and go into the living room. It is huge and is overflowing with wealth.
Lily is on the doorstep waiting for us. She looks elegantly sophisticated in a pale blue silk dress. Behind her stands Mr Potter, I presume, tall, with black hair, and as handsome in his own way as Harry. They have the same kind of messy black hair and with Lily with her green eyes, they may look like his biological parents to some. But I can see the differences.
“Yes oww!” I said while holding my head and trying to squint my eyes open. “It wasn’t my fault someone scared me awake, Hermione.” I grimaced at the pain then as I tried to scowl at her.
He’s mad about something - could be Blaise, France, no boxers, biting my lip, Merlin, he’s easy to rile.
“Hey Draco, how you feeling?” Ginny asks and sits on the end of the bed. He glares at her before speaking.
The door swings open and Teddy rushes in. He is about to jump on the bed towards Draco but I catch him mid air. Draco still flinches though and puts his arms over his huge stomach.
“It won't be like that. People are happy when they see this.” I place my hand on his stomach and rub it slowly. “Total opposite from the war okay. And from now on, I promise I will warn you when we have visitors okay?” He has stopped crying and is still now. I look down and his eyes are wide. “What?” I stop rubbing his belly and go to sit up, but he stops me.
Moving down, I push him into my mouth. He groans again. I can do this. I can fuck him with my mouth. I twirl my tongue around the tip again, and he flexes and raises his hips. His eyes are open now, blistering with heat. His teeth are clenched as he flexes again, pushing his cock further into my mouth. I’m supporting myself on his thighs and I can feel his legs tense beneath my hands. He reaches up and grabs my bun and starts to really move.
“But I know you’ve not done this before. Initially, we’ll take it slowly, and I will help you. We’ll build up to various scenarios. I want you to trust me, but I know I have to earn your trust, and I will. The ‘or otherwise’ - again it’s to help you get into the mindset; it means anything goes.”
We walk in through the back door and it’s fairly quiet. Me and Draco look at each other and frown. Then Molly comes into the kitchen with a plate of biscuits, humming quietly. She sees us and jumps, causing her to drop the plate. It smashes on the floor and the noise wakes Leo. He starts crying from being startled. Draco’s holding him this time and starts rocking him.
“It’s okay Harry, I understand.” He takes my hand and starts stroking it with his thumb. I think we both know what’s coming next.
“A boy!” He stops kissing me and has the most brilliant smile on his face. He wipes his tears and wraps his arms around me, which I copy.
“How did I know you were going to say that?” He loves the park and the ducks and we go every time I come round, even in the rain and snow.
“But whyyy?? I’m having fun, and it's my birthday so I should decide how I spend it.” He says to us. “Pleasseeee.”
“Everything looks good Draco, but I’m a bit worried about your blood pressure. It’s lower than it should be. This is quite common and most of the time it will return back to normal. But it can be dangerous for you and the baby if you don’t listen.” Draco looks like he's not breathing and I’m not doing much better myself. “Some self-care things you can do are; avoid getting up too quickly, don’t stand for long periods, don’t take very hot baths or showers, drink lots of water, eat small meals throughout the day, and wear loose clothing if you can.” She takes a seat and shuffles some papers. She looks just as lost as us but she can handle it as she must do this everyday. “This might actually explain your dizziness and not the pregnancy. Other side effects are fainting, nausea, blurred vision, clammy or pale or cold skin, rapid or shallow breathing, and lack of concentration.”
“You’re late, I came to check you hadn’t blown me off, or you weren’t dancing in your underwear again.” He smirks at me.
Luna beams at Pansy, seated opposite next to Theo, and they start talking about the student newspaper and The Quibbler, which Luna works for.
“No, I need to take my mind off things and this will help.” I nod and let her do her thing. She grabs a lot of pink things, some diapers, and a teddy bear.
I stare at the food overwhelmed by choice and realise I’m actually really hungry. I go for pancakes with lemon juice and a sprinkling of sugar. My favourite.
After all the present we have a collection of nappies and vests and items of clothing. We have a pregnancy pillow for Draco. Some gift vouchers. Some reusable nappies and a baby wrap from Luna. Also a small mountain of teddies, including a niffler and another dragon. A couple of parenting books. A snitch mobile for the cot. And a cute keepsake book.
“Everything’s fine Dragon. Calm down.” I whisper in his ear. He blushes and is so concentrated on the name that he forgets he’s panicking. Then Katie comes around the bed and his eyes go wide again and he squeezes my hand.
“Hey everyone! Ron? Where’s Hermione?” I ask while checking the bar but can only see Seamus. Seamus and Dean were always together lately and me and Draco had our suspicions that they were hooking up secretly. Bout time anyway.
“What if he doesn’t make it?” She looks like she’s about to cry so I grab her face and speak slowly to her.
“That would be this ones sir.” The little elf says and clicks his fingers. A round bottle of yellow liquid floats forward out the cupboard.
“Try saying that when she has been kicking you all day. She’s like a bloody worm today.” Hermione laughs. The baby stops kicking then, but I keep my hand there anyway. Hermione leans her head on my shoulder then. “Not long now and neither of us will be sleeping through the night.” She laughs again. “Are you scared Harry?”
“This is next-generation tech.” She raises her eyebrows at me. “Most people get flowers, chocolates, maybe jewellery.” she says suggestively, trying to suppress a smile.
15.18    The Submissive shall accept without question any and all disciplinary actions deemed necessary by the Dominant and remember his status and role in regard to the Dominant at all times.
“Teddy! You are not to say that word!” I tell him because he probably doesn’t know, in fact he’s probably heard it off Ginny this morning and thinks it’s okay to say.
He still has my hand in his and I turn back to look at the school again. I try to see it in his eyes. He used to live here too and probably considered it home much like I do at the moment, but this is one of the last times I’ll see it like this and I’m sure he hardly gets to see it either.
“Dunno really, you’re my best mate.  I tell you everything, and I know you are going to tell Hermione. But tell her to keep it to herself will you mate.” I tell him and then get up and hold my hand out for him. “Now, I think I want a dance with my boyfriend.”
Kate drops her blankets off her back and races towards me. She leaps on me and hugs me half to death. It's a good thing she is so light, otherwise I would have dropped her straight away.
“Would you now, Mr Malfoy?” he murmurs dryly. He leans down and kisses me very gently at the corner of my mouth. “Demanding little thing, aren’t you? Turn on your front.”
He moves down my arms, then beneath them to my underarms, washing gently. His hands glide across my chest, and I inhale sharply as his fingers circle my nipples and tug on them. My body bows instinctively, pushing my chest against his hands. My nipples are tender. Very tender, no doubt from his less-than-delicate treatment of them last night. He doesn't linger long and glides his hands down to my stomach and belly. My breathing increases and my heart is racing. His growing erection presses against my arse. It’s such a turn-on knowing that it’s my body making him feel this way.
He’s even grumpy by email. Doesn't he understand that I may need to make a quick getaway? Not that my old broom is quick…..but still - I need a means of escape.
“Yes,” I say quickly before Draco can have a go at the poor girl. “We’ve just bought a house a few miles out but it needs renovation before we move in.”
“You okay love?” Ron asks Hermione. She nods and gets up to give him a kiss. Then she comes over and gently takes Rose from Draco.
“But my daddy isn’t here anymore, so who tells you about your mummy and daddy now?” He looks concerned at that so I pick him up and sit down on the rocking chair with him on my knee. Andy must have slipped out at some point. I think for a moment before answering.
If I’d not met him, I’d still be sweetly and blissfully oblivious. My mind drifts to last night and this morning….and the incredible, sensual sexuality I’d experienced. Do I want to say goodbye to that? No! Screams my subconscious.
There is a knock at our door then and I get up to answer it. Standing in the doorway looking smug as ever is Blaise Zabini. He looks pleased with himself and holds up a bottle of firewhiskey.
“Much better.” I said while grabbing the floo powder for him, “Now I’ll see you on Friday and make sure you bring that delicious blush of yours with you.” I was just winding him up now to see how flushed I could get him, and might I say it was working fabulously. “Malfoy Manor.” I shouted and took one more look at his beautiful grey eyes and pushed him through with a quick good night. I went straight to bed after that and actually got a good night's sleep for once.
“Yes.” I whisper after clearing my throat. “And I find you intimidating.” I look down again and blush.
We are quiet on the rest of the drive, both lost in our own thoughts. When he parks up in his hotel carpark, it’s 5 in the evening. He switches off the engine and I realise I am going to have to leave him.
“Yeah, and we will have to apparate there because there is no way I can walk that far.” I chuckle and nod.
The Submissive will not enter into any sexual relations with anyone other than the Dominant. The Submissive will conduct himself in a respectful and modest manner at all times. He must recognise that his behaviour is a direct reflection on the Dominant. He shall be held accountable for any misdeeds, wrongdoings, and misbehaviour committed when not in the presence of the Dominant.
The laptop is a Macbook Pro. It's sleek and silver and rather beautiful. It has a very large screen.
“Yes.” He smiles his dazzling head-cocked-to-one-side smile, and my stomach pole vaults over my spleen. I can’t help but reflect his glorious smile back at him.
He swirls his tongue around and around, again and again, keeping up the torture. I’m losing all sense of self. My legs go rigid, and that’s when he slips a finger inside me, having lubed it up without me noticing, and I hear his growling groan.
"Rolf is a lovely young man and a great friend to Luna. They like all the same things and have been inseparable since they met. He is the grandson of Newt Scamander, the person who wrote Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them." Lily provides us with the information. I smile at Luna and just know that she will end up marrying the guy, even if it takes a while for them both to realise it. Even though I don't know her well, and don't know Rolf at all, I can see it in her eyes and he blush and her smile. We all go back to eating.
After breakfast the next morning, I said goodbye to Draco and apparated to the edge of Hogwarts. I had sent McGonagall a message last week saying I would be coming to see her soon, so I just hope she’s free now.
“We can’t eat money, Mr Malfoy, and there are too many on this planet that don’t have enough to eat.”
“Long enough.” He smirked at me and went through the door. Great, I rolled my eyes at him even though he couldn’t see me. I hope he felt that eye roll.
“Blaise, no, please.” My plea is lost as I stop breathing. You’re my friend and I don’t want this. I’m going to throw up.
Hmmm…. I pull him deeper into my mouth so I can feel him at the back of my throat and then to the front again. My tongue swirls around the end. He’s my very own Harry Potter-flavoured popsicle. I suck harder and harder, pushing him deeper and deeper, swirling my tongue around and around. Hmmm…. I had no idea giving a blow job could be such a turn-on, watching him writhe subtly with carnal longing.
“Don't worry.” he breathes, his eyes on mine. “ You'll stretch, just relax.” He leans down, his hands on either side of my head, so he’s hovering over me, staring down into my eyes, his jaw clenched, eyes burning. It’s only now that I register that he’s still wearing his shirt.
“If you made it bigger, then probably. And some koi fish would be nice.” He smiles and puts his free hand on top of mine on the pram handle.
“I thought we might have lunch together, but I can see you have other plans, and I don't want to interrupt your day.” She gathers up her long cream coat and turns to him, offering him her cheek. He kisses her briefly, sweetly. She doesn't touch him.
19    The Safeword “yellow” will be used to bring to the attention of the Dominant that the Submissive is close to his limit of endurance.
“Of course sorry. Oh wow, it’s so...so amazing.” Then she starts tearing up. She gets her picture out and shows Draco. Then Draco starts tearing up. Oh boy.
“Harry? Is it okay if I get the rest of Draco’s boxes? Then at least that’s done.” Nia offers kindly.
As McGonagall gets to her feet and kicks off the proceeding with her speech, I watch Harry subtly scanning the hall. I sink into my seat, hunching my shoulders, trying to make myself as inconspicuous as possible. I fail miserably as a second later his eyes find mine. He stares at me, his face impassive, completely inscrutable. I squirm uncomfortably, hypnotised by his glare as a slow flush spreads across my face. Unbidden, I recall my dream from this morning, and my cock starts to harden.
“Draco, I’ve told you. There’s something about you. I can’t leave you alone.” He smiles ironically. “I’m like a moth to a flame.” His voice darkens. “I want you very badly, especially now, when you’re biting your lip again.” He takes a deep breath and swallows.
As I peer up at him, I commit his beautiful profile to memory. The idea that I might not see him again haunts me, unwelcome and too painful to contemplate. He turns suddenly, staring down at me, his expression intense.
We go back to the music room and Hermione joins in helping. By the time we finish it’s 4 o’clock and we call it for the day.
“Why? Bored already?” I hear the sarcasm in his voice. He seems his age right now, in the sky on his motorbike. It makes me smile.
I nod. He scowls at me but chooses not to say anything. I breathe a small sigh of relief. My stomach is churning with all this new information, and I’m feeling a little lightheaded from the wine. I watch as he devours everything on his plate. He eats like a horse. He must work out to stay in such great shape. The memory of the way his pyjamas hung from his hips comes unbidden to my mind. The image is totally distracting. I squirm uncomfortably, my pants a bit tighter. He glances up at me, and I blush.
“You’re acting like a pregnant woman.” Nia says then and laughs. Except me and Draco don’t laugh and instead stare at each other. Nia stops laughing and looks at us. “What….” she looks at me and then at Draco. Her eyes wonder down to his stomach and she gasps. “No! Can wizards get pregnant?! Oh my god.” She looks about to cry then, so I start to go over to her to calm her down. Then she launches herself at Draco. I freeze and don’t act quick enough. By the time I have my wand out, anything could have happened. I look over and...well she’s hugging him. That’s all. I really need to calm down around Draco, I’m going to kill someone. I quickly put my wand away before Nia see’s it and freaks out.
“Right I’m going to speak to Hermione then. And if she’s already told that prat, I’m going to kill you.” He gets up and leaves me lying there cold.
“A lot better actually. I’m hardly being sick at all now, and my emotions are near enough back to normal. I have some off days but I’m feeling a lot better. Although I expect our little cherry here is getting a lot bigger, I’ve had to buy all new clothes because nothing fits me.” Draco says a bit sulkily towards the end.
“Okay, open your eyes.” Draco tells her. She opens them and gapes. She doesn’t say anything and just shoves the door open. She looks around and falls to her knees. Me and Draco stand there in shock and then we hear her crying and we move around her. I kneel next to her and Draco stays standing (partly because he would struggle getting up).
“Yes.” It’s the right decision. If I stay here, in this room with him, he will fuck me. I stand, purposefully. “We both have the graduation ceremony tomorrow.”
“Then you should have told her when she obviously told you!” I say right back. Luna looks near tears too now and I can’t stand this much longer. I storm past them and up to the floo.
“Please.” He mouths to me. I wipe his tears and help him up. As we are going over another contraction starts. “Ahhh. Harryyy.”
And he’s back with me again. I blink up at him and smile shyly. He’s so confusing. I ask a question that’s been bugging me.
“Me too.” He murmurs and regards me with dark eyes. “Do you need a hand?” He steps closer without letting me answer and puts his arm around me.
Harry leans over and says something to Theo. Theo is very tall and thin, and has curly blonde hair and light gleaming eyes. He grins then and pulls Pansy into his arms. She laughs and looks more than happy to be there. I am utterly shocked. She has only just met the guy for fucks sake. She nods at whatever Theo has just told her and grins. Then she looks up and waves at me. I continue to stare at her but then Harry is pulling me back through the crowd.
“Yeah same. I guess Teddy’s braver than both of us….maybe he will end up in Gryffindor.” I think about it but stick with my guess. After everything that kid said to me, how can he not be a Hufflepuff. I wonder what ours will turn out to be.
“What about Hogwarts? It’s familiar territory for him and the photos would look amazing.” I can hear her working it all out down to the last detail.
After the war Andy struggled a lot, she had lost her husband and her daughter and her son in law. To top it off she had a baby to look after. I tried to help out as much as I could at the time but it wasn’t enough. I was struggling to keep myself going. That’s when Draco appeared in her life and offered to help out, he even gave her Lottie to help around the house. She got back on track after a while and deals quite well nowadays. But if it wasn’t for Draco back then, Merlin knows where she would be right now. It’s actually how me and Draco met again after the war. But that’s another story.
I’ve worked at the pub in Hogsmeade for 4 years. It’s helping me save for a flat when I move to London with Pansy. I like it there and I get to know a lot of different people.
“The way you smiled at him, and he at you.” He stares at me and I try to look away, but can’t. He is so unnerving.
“That’s a matter of public record, Mr Malfoy.” He says in a stern voice. Shit. Of course, if I had known I was doing this interview I would have done some research either in the library or using the muggle internet. I’m flustered now and decide to move on quickly.
“It's okay babe. I will call st Mungos as soon as I’ve got you in bed and get you an appointment today. Even if it means using my ‘boy who lived’ status. I’ll do that for you.”
“What’s wrong?!” I ask him and look at Leo, but he’s fine. Draco looks up and more tears fall. Then he puts his arms around me and pulls me into a hug. I go willingly and thankful.
“Oh, please, don’t let this be about money, Draco. Theo said it’s very unusual for Harry to date anyone.”
“Blaise, I love you dearly, you mean so much to me. You’re like the brother I never had. That’s not going to change. You know that.” I hate to let him down, but it’s the truth.
“Merlin and Morgana, I thought something had happened.” I breathe for a minute and then look at Hermione. She looks in pain and I freeze. “Are you okay?”
“I didn’t manage to speak to Ron last night, he didn’t come home. So I went in search this morning and finally found him at Bill and Fleur’s. He was more angry at me than you Harry.” I look up at her at that and frown. “We promised each other not to lie to one another. He was really upset with me. He was upset with you as well but he understood you couldn’t tell anyone. So we aren’t talking at the moment but you are welcome to go see him.” She sighs and I take her hand.
After Draco told me he wanted to give birth at home, I put in extra effort and brought in extra help to get this place finished. Most of Weasleys, excusing new dad Ron, came over. Luna, Neville, Teddy, Dean, Seamus, and even Pansy and Blaise came to help. After Draco had had a stern talk to them about not being round enough.
“Couple of weeks or so now,” he says smoothly. “We met when Draco came to interview me for the student newspaper.”
“This is the nondisclosure agreement.” He shrugs and has the grace to look a little embarrassed. “My lawyer insists on it.” He hands it to me and I’m completely bemused. “It’s magical. And it’s needed if you want this to go any further.” He smooths his thumb over my knuckles once more and makes me shiver.
“ugh….I hate oysters, and I don’t want to know about the food. How was Harry? What did you talk about?”
“Thank you but my mother is expecting me. Harry is free though.” Draco says. He still hasn’t been to the burrow once. Molly has invited him a hundred times but he always makes an excuse.
“Draco, you were comatose. Necrophilia is not my thing. I like my partners… receptive.”  He says dryly.
When we get back to the house we go into the living room. It's the only room that’s clean and the big bay windows bring in lots of light. Nia sits on the window seat and Draco sits in the middle of the floor facing Nia. I just stay standing.
“Read that.” the house elf orders and practically throws the leaflet at me. It has all the information about the Mac laptop on. “Account is up and ready.”
He was in Nia’s room, cleaning the bathroom. There are a lot of cracked tiles that need fixing and the toilet probably needs replacing, but the rest just needs a thoroughly deep cleaning.
“And little cherry.” I remind him with a wet laugh and pull out the moving picture of our baby from the scan. The one I was going to give to Ron and Hermione. Draco takes it and kisses it and then kisses me and curls up tighter.
“I’m really scared Harry. I know I deserve everything that’s happening to me but…” I pull him back then to see his face and frown at him.
“Well you didn’t have to track me down through my wand and act like a creepy stalker.” I turn and snap at him. He stares at me and seems surprised, maybe even a little wounded. Maybe that was too far.
“Now you know how I feel when you come around.” She elbows me lightly and winks. We both burst out laughing and when we look up Nia and Teddy are staring at us.
I shake myself and shove my book and bagel under the counter. My heart is pounding and for some reason I am blushing furiously. This is such a surprise and I’m utterly thrown by his presents. He is the epitome of male beauty and is utterly breathtaking. My memory does him not justice. Why the hell is he in The Hog Head of all places? I seem to have found my brain and cognitive functions have been restored.
“Her name is Nia, and I don’t know. I think we should try to speak to her when she’s working. That way she won’t expect us to bring up magic and she won’t be able to draw her wand in front of muggles. Not that i think she will draw her wand but..” I let the sentence end there. Draco knows the sort of people I’ve had to put up with in the past being an auror. One minute they can be nice as pie and the next they're trying to kill you with an avada kedavra . “I don’t think she’s there for us though.” I say next. “Her stuff seemed old and it looked like she had been there a while. She has sort of made herself at home I think.”
The ice in my navel is melting. I am beyond warm - warm and chilled and wanting. Wanting him, inside me. Now.
“I’m fine, thank you, Mr Potter. Draco’s potions fixed me all up.” I blush again and then look at Pansy while she shakes Potter's hand. She doesn’t seem like she felt a current of any sort. Strange. I also note that Pansy is very much not a mess. She was raised with money and so knows how to handle social situations. Plus, she never takes shit from anyone. I am in total awe of her. “Thank you for taking the time to do this.” She tells him politely, with a professional smile.
“Hello, I’m nia.” She says in a cheerful voice and points at her name. “Welcome to Whipped, how can I help?”
Someone shows us to a room immediately and tells us to wait for healer Bell here. As soon as they leave Draco grabs my arm and squeezes.
“The past is behind us Harry and I’m pretty sure Draco of all people has tried to forget it. Just tell him. What’s the worst that could happen?”
“Come.” Taking my hand in his, he leads me back to the car. This contact, flesh on flesh, it’s what is so unexpected from him, normal, intimate. I can’t reconcile this ordinary, tender gesture with what he wants to do in that room…..the Red Room of Pain.
“No!” It’s my turn to sound exasperated. “Introduce you to my godfather as what? ‘This is the man who took my virginity and wants us to start a BDSM relationship’? You’re not wearing running shoes.”
Resolving there and then not to ask him for them and not give him satisfaction, I shall go meet his parents without my underwear. I almost hug myself with glee because I know this will drive him crazy.
“You like this?” he asks softly, his teeth grazing my outer ear, and he starts to flex his fingers in and out, rubbing a circle on that spot each time.
“Actually it's guy Hermione”, I intervened quickly to stop the rant, “we know who it is but not how he’s doing it. So we can't bring him in as we have nothing on him.”
“Thanks Harry.” She says and goes back over to Percy. I take my phone out and it’s a text from Draco. ‘Come to the bathroom NOW’. Hermione read over my shoulder and I turn to look at her. She shoos me along and off I go to find Draco wondering what’s up with him.
“Well, that’s another first.” He eyes me speculatively. “So nothing you want to discuss now? About the contract?”
“Just how sore are you?” he asks as he sits down next to me. I blush. Why does he ask such personal questions?
Fucking kiss me already! My eyes beg him and I can’t move. I’m stuck underneath him but also paralysed with my want for him. I’m staring at his mouth mesmerised, and he is staring down at me with dark hooded eyes. He is breathing harder than usual, and I’ve completely stopped breathing. I’m yours, kiss me please. He closes his eyes then and takes a deep breath. He shakes his head, opens his eyes and gets up off me.
“Pansy, please don’t. I need to study.” I say before she can start. I grab my bag and head to my room before she can say anything else. I slam the door a bit harder than I meant to.
“Draco, I’m so sorry. I didn’t know and-“ He cuts me off with a light slap of my arm that’s on his chest.
“I know, I’m this tall now.” He said and stood up to show us how tall he was and put his hand to his forehead. I snort at that and Draco jabs me in the side.
“Hey. You’re not being a pain,” he raised a pointy eyebrow at me for saying that, “you’re not! I swear. In fact I find it funny and kind of adorable.” I laugh sweetly at him.
15.21    The Submissive shall accept whipping, floggings, spankings, canings, paddlings, or any other discipline the Dominant shall decide to administer, without hesitation, inquiry, or complaint.
“If I cancel now it will take months to reschedule and by then we will both have finished our finals and will have graduated. It took me 9 months of persistence to get this interview with him. Please Draco, I’m the editor and I would be so upset to miss this opportunity.” Pansy rasps at me. She is huddled under a mound of blankets with a littering of dirty tissues around her. Her black, normally straight hair, is in a messy bun and she really does look a sight.
“Hey baby,” I say and give him a quick kiss while he carries on reading. “Did you get my patronus? I’m going to go tell Nia the good news now. And I’m thinking we could carry on with ‘Notre co…’” damn it, I could never remember this.
“Fine, deal.” He was sulking now but it was adorable and I just had to give him a kiss. He was surprised by it but it wasn’t unwelcome as he soon started kissing back. In fact he was getting pretty into this…
I start panicking if I even think about leaving the house. Hermione and Ron come over sometimes, but most the time I pretend I’m sleeping or not home. I know these are signs I need help, but I just can’t talk about it yet. I need more time. But Teddy needs me, Andromeda needs me. So some days I manage to get out. Like today.
15.1   The Dominant shall make the Submissive’s health and safety a priority at all times. The Dominant shall not at any time require, request, allow, or demand the Submissive to participate at the hands of the Dominant in the activities detailed in Appendix 2 or in any act that either party deems to be unsafe. The Dominant will not undertake or permit to be undertaken any action which could cause serious injury or any risk to the Submissive’s life. The remaining subclauses of this clause 15 are to be read subject to this proviso and to the fundamental matters agreed in clauses 2-5 above.
Looking back to the table where a dozen vials rolled askew, Harry remembered with a sudden rush just what he’d done. He clutched at his temples as confusing memories flooded his mind.
Malfoy whirled around, pulling his wand out and dispersing the smoke. He lifted a pan off the burner and studied it before vanishing its contents with a heavy sigh.
“Well,” Ron said cheerfully, with impressive fortitude in the face of the icy look that Malfoy was giving him, “we’re all here now. Let’s go for lunch, shall we?”
With a realization that felt like an anchor pulling Harry into the depths of the Atlantic he said, “Draco… I know that I asked you not to give up.” Harry swallowed thickly, “But if this is too hard, I – I’d understand.”
thrown in the mix. Evidently Harry had given Luna an exclusive on his coming out. By the time he’d emptied the chest out around him, Harry had a distinct taste of bile on the back of his tongue. The things the
“Fucker,” Harry muttered fiercely. He fumed for a moment before realizing that Draco hadn’t moved or said anything since Longeman departed. “You alright?”
Harry wavered on the edge of asking Draco about his mother, but remembered he was meant to answer the question as well when Draco raised expectant brows. “Er.. I like Quidditch as well, obviously. Relaxing with friends. Cooking. I can always get into a good movie,” he smiled at Draco, feeling as though this was the sort of thing two people might connect over on a first date.
Not twenty minutes ago Draco had, in fact, let his mouth fall open in clear awe and admiration when Harry had walked into the master bath to ask Draco what was taking him so bloody long.
“Dudley?” Harry asked dubiously, suddenly remembering that Pansy had mentioned George going to look for Malfoy at Dudley’s the previous evening. “As in my cousin Dudley?”
There was so much in that, Harry didn’t know what to unpack. He turned to Hermione, and was relieved when she beckoned Oscar over onto her arm. “Oscar, love, we need to take a muggle cab home, and you won’t be welcome. Would you go ahead and meet us at Grimmauld Place? I promise we will get him there safely.”
Hermione met his eyes questioningly, Harry indicated she ought to go on with an unsteady jerk of his chin.
“Just a few from particular events where it may have been likely for me to meet or hear of her,” Draco said in a cautious tone.
He walked over to Draco and grabbed him gently by the shoulders, “Sit,” he instructed, guiding him into a chair. He was trembling slightly.
Harry nodded and Hermione ran her thumb across the back of his hand as she began to tell him the story of his life.
As soon as Hermione said it, he had to acknowledge it. The truth of it washed over him in an overwhelming rush, something like he remembered the Thieves’ Downfall at Gringotts feeling. Harry had just pushed it back, far away for a very long time. Though he was quite sure he hadn’t
Turning to Malfoy with a pleading look, Harry hoped he might be able to find an ally. After all, he must be as eager to get through the memories as Harry was.
They remained silent until they reached the front steps of the castle, where McGonagall stood to greet them with a wave and the warmest smile Harry had ever seen on her face.
Clenching his jaw, Harry shook his head. He went to fix tea for Draco and tried his best to get his anger under control before he sat back down to offer it to him. Gandalf had made his way into Draco’s lap and had curled there contentedly, which seemed to have relaxed Draco a little.
And yet, Harry thought, Narcissa Malfoy had cut her son out of her life altogether as a result? At least, that was Harry’s impression of the situation.
Catching sight of the clock on the wall opposite the desk, Harry said, “It’s two in the morning, what on earth are you doing?”
Harry answered Fleur absently as he watched Draco coo over the baby in his arms. Reaching to run her fingers through Draco’s silky hair, she giggled. They looked as though they could be truly related, Victoire’s downy curls the same white-blond. Harry couldn’t believe that he’d missed this little girl’s entire life. He remembered that Fleur was pregnant, sure. It had only just been announced in the last of his memories. But to see her, maybe ten months old…
“Hermione said it was your favourite fancy place,” Harry kept his tone casual, but in reality he was quite pleased with himself as well. It was good to see Draco happy.
She passed him a pain potion and waited for him to gulp it down before carrying on with her lecture. “You could have caused yourself serious brain damage today. As it is you’re probably going to have a massive headache and dizziness for the next day or so. You’ll certainly have some confusion around the memories you watched today for a long time, possibly forever. That said,” she flicked her eyes over to Draco, “he is not to rewatch them. You may talk through them when he is feeling better and do you best to untangle them that way.”
“Draco’s at work, Teddy. He’ll be by to visit you soon, though. Harry, you and Teddy go to the park together every week. Last week you went to the zoo. Do you remember Teddy?”
Harry thought perhaps the statement was meant to come across as apologetic, but it felt more demanding than anything.
Harry ignored her, and wandered towards the refrigerator. Stuck to its gleaming surface was a colouring page of a Hippogriff filled with rainbow scribbles and signed in Dromeda’s neat cursive
Reaching back over his shoulder, Harry rubbed at the infernal bump on his back. He’d first noticed the spot yesterday, but today it was so much worse that when he’d swiped his loofa over it in the shower it had hurt. With a wave of his wand, he defogged the mirror, then twisted awkwardly so he could get a view of what he was dealing with.
“Oh, yeah.” Just as Harry began to think that maybe the awkwardness was waning, it sprang back up on them. “Yeah… I haven’t really looked around the house much. Just kept to the main rooms, really."
A Valentine's Day update (sorry this chapter was a bit more angst than romance!) Thanks for reading, I'd delight in any feedback/comments :)
The pleased look on George’s face reminded Harry so strongly of Arthur Weasley that he couldn’t help but grin in return.
Harry took a few more steps until he stood over Draco. “What if I don’t want to wait? What if I don’t need to take things slowly?”
“Harry,” Draco sighed, pulling his arms off the table so Ron could angrily thunk a plate of dinner in front of him, “you hate throwing around your reputation. Don’t do it for this. It’s fine, really.”
Nodding her approval, Andromeda said, “I’ve already dropped up a bunch of frozen meals for you. There’s a chili, vegetable soup and a pasta dish in your freezer alright? All labelled with cooking instructions.”
“I’ll give you my answer if you want,” Draco offered, waiting for Harry to nod before he continued. “My happiest memory is a day that we just lounged around home together. I’d never really felt at home, anywhere. At the Manor I always had to be so careful, so clean and proper. And then, of course, we had some unsavoury houseguests. And I spent a lot of my time at Hogwarts hiding a huge part of myself. The first time I ever really felt at home was with you. And not,” Draco shot him a rueful smile, “just at Grimmauld once we’d done it up how we wanted. But at that dumpy little flat before. I think I’d feel at home anywhere so long as it was with you.”
She crossed her arms and raised her brows, “I absolutely have. You spent most of yesterday trying to overexert yourself. As I was saying, three days rest. Then you can progress to spending an hour or two out of the house at a time, getting some fresh air and what not. Memory wise, don’t try to overload yourself. Get a few stories here and there. Once we’ve checked in with you next week, we will see how you’re doing. If progress is good you can start reviewing other peoples’ memories of shared experiences in a pensieve. Best to do that in chronological order, so it might take some organizing. We’ll talk more about that later, alright?
He landed on damp concrete, next to a towering glass building. It took him a moment to recognize Malfoy, whose face was hidden by an umbrella tilted against the drizzling rain. It looked cold and grey out, but Harry couldn’t feel the temperature. Just as he began to follow the Malfoy of the past, the present version of Malfoy landed next to him, his light dress shirt looking out of place on the stormy street.
Ignoring him, Harry raced up the stairs to the workout room with his heart racing and his own fists clenched in anger. He stomped down the hall to the entrance of the room, ready to tear Malfoy a new one.
Was George right though? Harry couldn’t help but wonder if the only way he and Draco had been able to get along in their relationship was because they’d had another outlet. But no, that couldn’t be. They’d been working together, been friends for months before they were in a relationship. They’d managed to spend every day together for platonic purposes and still fall in love.
Harry faltered in the doorway. Malfoy was sitting on the floor, curled up in a ball in the back corner of the room. He had his fists, wrapped in boxer’s tape, pressed into his eyes and his shoulders were shaking. All of Harry’s anger sapped out of him. He crossed the room and slid down to sit next to Malfoy.
“This came for you after you went up to bed last night,” Malfoy gestured to a thick envelope sealed with the Hogwarts crest which sat on the table next to a pile of textbooks. “I pulled out your books, as well. And Hermione left her recommended study schedule.”
“Getting back to working on your coursework soon, I hope,” McGonagall said as she led them through the halls of the castle. A few students stopped in their tracks to gawp at them as they passed. “While you will have to redo some of the assignments you’ve already done to ensure comprehension, whichever grade – new or old – is better will be the one you keep.”
The crisp evening air and the fog that swirled around the street lamps was calming, and Harry linked his fingers with Draco’s and inhaled deeply.
Chuckling, Harry said, “You definitely should be. I’m proud to be able to say I’ve played with you.”
“Mr. Potter, I’m Niamh Brady. You’re safe in St. Mungo’s now. I’m a healer.” She charmed Harry’s glasses to hover just above his face, allowing him to see so long as he kept his head perfectly still. Healer Brady had a soft, round face and auburn hair.
“I mean,” Harry turned to Pansy and stumbled onwards when the intensity in Malfoy’s eyes became too much, “If you were on a date… It’s late. He could stay in one of the spare rooms. I’m in a spare at the moment, too. In the morning,” Harry turned back to Draco, “we could talk a bit?”
Grimacing in response to Kreacher, Harry let himself into the kitchen. Draco was standing in front of the dining table, arms crossed and expression livid. The red of his uniform’s sleeves really emphasized his tense, muscled arms.
When Draco arrived back and sent Molly on home, Harry wasn’t sure whether to feel relieved or trepidatious. But when Harry turned down dinner, Draco simply pulled a chair up to Harry’s bedside and asked if he was feeling confused about the memories he’d seen.
The memory faded out and once more, Harry and Draco were in their warm kitchen next to Ron. Draco took a deep breath and then pushed his chair back from the table.
They worked their way up through the rest of the house, popping briefly into various guest rooms that didn’t have much excitement to offer. They both walked right past the master bedroom without so much as a glance its direction. When they got to Sirius’s old room, Harry hovered his hand over the door knob, not certain he wanted to see what they had done with it. At Malfoy’s encouraging nod, he twisted the handle and pushed the door open.
“Oh, well… alright.” They let an embarrassed silence stretch between them before Harry made a decision. “No, I think I’d rather not watch them; unless there’s any bits of conversation or whatnot that you think are really important?”
Thanks for reading :) Like some of you, I too, am getting impatient for them to kiss! So I thought I'd post this chapter early to get us a little bit closer to that moment. I do love a good slow burn though ;P Just like I love reading your comments, so thank you <3
“Not long before Christmas, you tried to test a method to destroy a dementor, and it went poorly. Malfoy was drained of magic, and very injured. You saved him, that time. You called Molly who treated his injuries. Unfortunately, you and Malfoy ended up on the front page of the Prophet, accompanied with a rather salacious article.”
Harry stood on the front steps of Number 12 Grimmauld Place feeling nauseated. In his memory, he had been back no more than twice since the battle at Hogwarts; each time only to ensure that Kreacher was getting along okay. The place had held a few too many memories for Harry’s comfort. Now, apparently, it held not nearly as many as it was supposed to. According to Hermione he’d been living there for over seven months. Seven out of the sixteen months Harry had lost and would never get properly back.
And all the while, there was Malfoy, channelling the rage he clearly felt as much as Harry did into something productive. Treating the girl’s parents with compassion while gaining the information they needed to confirm their next steps. Making a plan to investigate the pressing issue of dementors plaguing the streets of London, rather than only focusing on researching ways to destroy them. This memory, Harry realized was why his past self had been able to move on from his concerns about working with Malfoy.
They carried on like that for a while, batting superficial questions back and forth. Favourite song, funniest embarrassing memory (Pansy had once caught Draco dancing through his dorm in pajamas whilst singing a Celestina Warbeck tune into his hairbrush).
? Ire bubbled up within him and, with just as much impulsive determination as he’d had when he’d pushed Draco against that wall, Harry stormed down the stairs to find the blonde git.
“’Arry,” Fleur chided gently, calling his attention back. She regarded him steadily with her cool blue eyes. “You’ve overcome far worse than this.”
It seemed Harry’s life would just continue to become more surreal, rather than less. For most of the visit, Harry sat quietly and sipped on his tea while Hagrid and Malfoy discussed a hippogriff named Ironclaw.
“Yes. I’ve arranged for my friend Master Dermot Halloran to apprentice you for your mastery and then you were to begin your professorship here.”
Malfoy’s gaze faltered once more, and he picked up a paper to rifle through the pages. “To remember, I suppose.”
“Well,” Harry grinned, “breakfast for dinner’s a fantastic idea. Breakfast is the best meal of the day, but who wants to wake up that early to eat it?”
“One a day only. For this first week at least. If you have any headaches, dizziness, confusion you stop reviewing immediately. And you book back in with me before continuing to watch anymore. Got it?”
He hardly noticed the angry spot next to the dark inky dragon that was twining itself around the centre of his back. Harry let out an involuntary shout of surprise.
Harry squinted at Draco’s face, the edges of his features slightly blurred as he was without his glasses, “I know.” He certainly hadn’t forgotten Draco’s reaction when Harry had first made his move. “I… did actually have a question about that, though?”
A terrible kink in his neck was the first thing Harry became aware of. The second was a cool hand on his forehead. Then the whoosh of the fireplace once, twice. The tingling sensation of a spell cast over him.
“Brilliant, Ginny,” Harry smiled fondly. “I’ve only ever seen her play seeker during pick-up games at the Burrow, though. That time she played for Gryffindor was when I was banned.”
Falling asleep that night was a challenge. Malfoy had left the bathroom on the same floor of their bedrooms for Harry to use, and had gathered what he needed to take a shower upstairs. Apparently Kreacher had gone off to Pansy’s to collect all of Draco’s belongings earlier in the day. Harry brushed his teeth quickly, sprayed a lavender mist from Hermione liberally over his bed and then flopped down, burying his face into his pillow  and trying to pretend he couldn’t hear the shower running above him. Trying not to think about the fact that he and Draco Malfoy were living together, which was weird. Trying not to think about how Draco Malfoy was
Harry was not sufficiently braced for the ball of feathers that bounced off the side of his face before settling properly onto his shoulder. The bird nuzzled itself into the crook of Harry’s neck.
Harry remained still for a few more moments, until Hermione called him out. When he opened his eyes to see her, he was pleased to find he could open both eyes this time. And overall, he hurt quite a lot less. Nonetheless, he was grateful when Hermione offered him a pain potion, explaining that the healer had left it for him to take on waking.
“No,” Harry replied firmly. “I’ve got feelings for you. I mean,” he shot Draco a wry smile, “they’re terribly confusing feelings. But they’re not bad feelings. And they’re there.”
Draco smiled in understanding and dipped his head to press a kiss to the side of Harry’s neck. “A bit of both options,” he said gently. “Though you tended to top more, sometimes we’d mix it up.”
Longeman, out of spite Harry expected, scheduled the meeting for precisely five o’clock. Probably Longeman had realized the reason Harry wanted the meeting later in the day was to ensure that Draco could be present, and five o’clock would make it so Draco would need to apparate immediately after his last lecture and wouldn’t have even a moment to catch his breath at home first.
Harry stepped out of the floo and some part of his heart that had been askew clicked into place. Sunlight streamed into the sitting room and the smell of cinnamon and baked apples drifted from the kitchen. Molly rushed into the room just as Draco stepped out of the floo behind Harry.
“We’ve got a cellular. It’s kept in the centre drawer of the desk in the study. I’ll give him a quick call before I head out if you’re sure you’re alright with it.”
A queen size bed, with a simple wooden frame and a plush white comforter sat in the middle of the room. There was a nightstand on either side of the bed, the one on the right had nothing on its surface, the one on the left had a pile of magazines and a glasses case. Harry assumed the left was his side, with a twist of his stomach. His eyes ranged over the two cream toned armchairs tucked into the bay window and he noticed a door. Heading through it, he found a walk in closet, which was entirely bare on one side. Through the other side of the closet was a bathroom, he barely glanced at it, before heading back out into the hall where his friends waited for him. Waited as if it would have been too intimate for them to be present while he rediscovered the bedroom he had shared with his partner.
The feel of Draco’s cock heavy on his tongue, of his thighs twitching and his hands tugging at Harry’s hair was intoxicating. Harry found himself needing to push down on his own cock to calm himself enough to keep going. When Draco came, Harry swallowed it down and licked him clean until Draco shivered and pushed Harry away.
Malfoy huffed and peeled his hands away from his eyes so he could look at Harry. They were watery and red-rimmed. “It’s not Ron I’m worried about.”
And while he didn’t know exactly what he’d done to cause those dozens of small, quiet injuries, Harry knew exactly how badly he’d hurt Draco by risking his progress during his memory binge and his safety by sneaking out on the Auror watch, And he knew the quarrelling was wearing on them both.
Harry frowned, uncertain where Ron was going but suspecting he was already fumbling through it just as much as the last time. This wasn’t likely to soothe his blinding headache, anyhow.
He heard Draco mumble “Oh no,” and the scene became blurry, fading to black. The next second Harry was back at his kitchen table, with Draco sitting opposite him, looking green.
Brow furrowing, Draco replied, “Well that’s hardly what I would call it. It’s just… two weeks with no progress. The case is basically a write off at this point. But I’m not allowed to be involved, and Longeman is particularly cautious about giving me any form of update so… I just thought I might do a little thinking on it myself.”
Ron? I could’ve spent all week in front of a telly and instead I was moping around the drawing room?”
“Okay,” Malfoy smiled softly. He looked so very different than Harry had ever known him, ruffled from sleep, with his expression wide open. “I’ll stay.”
Harry, who was truly in too much pain to deal with anything else, grunted his assent. With a cool hand at the back of his neck, Niamh supported him to drink the potion, which tasted like mint and licorice and rapidly soothed the pain from its previously violent thumping to more of a dull thrumming.
Squealing with excitement, Teddy nearly lunged out of Andromeda’s arms towards Draco, who scooped him up and pressed a smacking kiss to the top of his head.
Sorry for such a late update, been busy hand-making Christmas gifts to make up for holiday gatherings being cancelled due to COVID's second wave in my part of the world. Happy New Year everyone, I hope you're all safe and well!
Harry kissed Draco intently before replying. “Niamh said I can go up to three memories, so that’s brilliant.”
Draco was sitting at the kitchen table, holding his head in his hands as though he, perhaps, was working his way through some regrets.
“Good evening Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy,” he greeted as he pulled open the door. “Wonderful to see you. Once you make your way up the stairs Annalise will show you to your table.”
Malfoy sat heavily onto the pine bench that rested against the wall. Gandalf immediately hopped into his lap and washed his face with slobber. Malfoy ignored this, instead saying morosely, “I’m sorry. I just needed to see you.”
The long row of Draco’s memories was broken by a single pink one. Harry watched with interest as he confessed his friendship with Malfoy to George, who was a surprisingly great listener. He picked up the next green vial and felt his heart fly at the look of happiness on Draco’s face when past-Harry told Draco that George knew they were friends. He watched as Draco studied the Black family tapestry in Grimmauld Place, and Harry encouraged him to meet Teddy and Andromeda.
Just as quickly as his anger flared, it died. Draco looked so distraught, that Harry wrapped his arms firmly around him and pressed a kiss to the side of his head.
“So…” Malfoy ventured as he began to crack eggs. “You seemed like you hadn’t seen the study this morning.”
“Well Draco, I didn’t think it would be quite so tactful at the time to exclaim with pure joy. But since then you’ve found a partner – although I’m terribly sorry to hear about what’s happened to you both, I can’t imagine how anyone could be so hateful as to do such a thing to another person- and my parents have moved to France where they leave me largely alone.”
Harry squinted at Malfoy, turning his words over in his mind for possible alternate meanings. Finding none, he nodded, “that sounds like a better idea than starting with Potions, anyhow.”
He cracked his eyes open and winced at the light. Merlin, what a terrible headache he had. Before he could complain about the brightness, Niamh’s head was blocking the source of light. She looked sideways, and it took Harry a moment to realize that it was actually his head that was sideways, pressed against the unforgiving dining table.
“Good,” Harry dipped to kiss Draco deeply, cupping his face in his palms. He kissed him until Draco seemed sufficiently convinced and then dropped to his knees in front of the chair.
Rather than reply, Niamh began to cast her diagnostic charms. After a moment she said, “Well, your vitals are still strong. How’ve you been feeling?”
“Did I?” Harry rubbed at the back of his neck. “Been a while since I’ve lost control of my magic. Wish it’d given that arse a jolt. He’d have deserved it.”
Shrugging, Draco said, “I’m not letting that ruin our evening. I’d been anticipating flirting, therefore, we shall flirt.”
With raised brows Longeman asked, “And one of the Auror healers has verified the memory loss is irreversible?”
Harry jumped off the bed and clapped her on the shoulder, “Brilliant, Niamh, thank you. Oh, also – can I watch telly again?”
“I don’t want to her feel badly,” Draco said to Harry when she’d left again, this time with the orders Draco had put in for the both of them. “Or you.
Harry tucked a loose lock of Draco’s hair behind his ear, “No, really. It’s becoming clear why I fell for you.”
“Didn’t help much, did it?” Harry waved his hand at the many papers that had been published since. Despite the warmth that had blossomed in his chest when Malfoy confirmed the truth about the Patronuses, he wasn’t ready to let go of the anger that reading the papers had spawned. “They deserve to be burnt down.”
Harry nodded, “It should be you.” Malfoy favoured Harry with a small smile. “Have you ever used a pensieve before?”
Also, has anyone watched Schitt's Creek? I just finished the last season, so if you're not caught up SPOILER ahead, but I just really feel like David and Patrick have such Drarry vibes and need someone to geek out about it with!
Without a thought, Harry pressed Draco against the wall and grasped his face, kissing him forcefully. Draco gasped, and for the briefest of moments Harry thought he might pull away. And then he was kissing him back, wrapping his arms around Harry’s body, pulling him closer, closer.
Once finished with the memory, Harry looked wistfully at the full case. He headed over to the fireplace to floo Andromeda and ask for a visit. She and Teddy popped out into the kitchen a few moments later with a platter piled high with pancakes and kept him successfully busy for the morning. By the time they’d gone back home at half noon, Harry was exhausted. He collapsed into bed for a few solid hours of sleep.
“Harry, Draco,” Hagrid greeted in his usual genial manner as he fidgeted with the locks and swung the gates open for them. “Come on in. Harry,” he lifted his unruly brows to study Harry with his warm black eyes, “how’re ya feeling?"
Malfoy’s eyes widened for a second, before his smile broadened. “Yeah, that’s true. Pansy leaked it to get them off my back. She claimed she was worried that you might burn down the
“Ridiculous,” Draco grumbled scanning the empty bar room. “Not a one of them is even here yet.” He pitched his voice lower and leaned into Harry as they headed towards a large, circular booth in the back “We could still be in bed. Naked."
“You know,” Harry said on impulse, “I’ve dealt with a lot of truly fucking evil people in life. But Gilderoy Lockhart was the worst of them all.”
“Breakfast for dinner. That’s your favourite, isn’t it?” Malfoy turned, grey eyes searching Harry’s worriedly.
“Had to get up and leave the handsome man I woke up with this morning behind in bed,” Draco said wryly. “But other than that, it was alright, I suppose. Yours?”
Firstly, Oscar threw a near fit that they wouldn’t let him join them. It was the middle of a Saturday and they were headed for a muggle park, though. Finally, Draco tossed him a large piece of jerky. “You spoilt brat,” he muttered, in a tone that held both fondness and irritation.
There were towering piles of books pushed up against the walls, a dummy that looked as though it had served as target practice for a variety of nasty curses, and an old rocking chair that, ominously, rocked back and forth on its own volition. Sighing as he realized the object wasn’t sitting out in the open anywhere, Harry wove through the detritus until he found a likely storage place- an old leather wrapped chest pushed up against the south window of the room. Harry had to push a rack covered in ostentatious cloaks- made of fur, dragon hide, and one particularly tacky one that was entirely green and silver sequins- out of his way. Then he dropped to his knees and unlatched the chest.
“I swear it, Dudley,” Malfoy grinned, he’d changed out of his Auror robes into a loose pair of trousers and an oversized knit sweater and Harry couldn’t help but notice how very good he looked. “They recommend we turn our skin camouflage because there are counter-charms to disillusioning ourselves- you know making our selves nearly invisible so long as no one’s paying too close attention- and they’re too cheap to buy enough invisibility cloaks for the force!”
“Healer Brady said you might need to stop in the middle of a memory if you develop a headache or confusion. I’m coming. Especially since you’ll be starting with technically two memories.”
“Draco?” Harry asked, rubbing the back of his neck. “When… when did you start to have feelings for me?”
Never mind that it was only half seven. If he didn’t get away from Malfoy, and Hermione and Ron, and their condescending but regretful faces he would say something
Draco sat on the edge of Harry’s bed without hesitation. Never mind that they’d hardly spoken since Friday.
The door to the pub squeaked open, letting in a draft of cold air along with Hermione and Ron. Draco straightened but didn’t move away from Harry. Hermione’s eyes landed on them immediately and she waved a file folder in triumph as she approached.
Malfoy smiled sadly and continued, “It wasn’t at all fair of me. Don’t worry about what we talked about. I understand you weren’t in the right state of mind.”
“Just, please Harry, ask for someone to join you next time. They can run two metres behind you for all I care.”
“Yeah,” Draco whispered, angrily swiping at a tear trailing down the side of his nose. “Lockhart really did that? Why isn’t that common knowledge?”
“I’m content to be as close beside you as you’ll let me be as often as you’ll let me,” Harry murmured back, nudging the side of Draco’s neck with his nose.
Once Annalise had left, with a promise of returning with a wine for Draco and a sparkling juice for Harry, he reached for Draco’s forearm, “Fuck, I’m sorry.”
Hermione shrugged apologetically, “A lot of the memories that involve her included Ron or me. And she said she didn’t want to clutter up the important stuff. She didn’t think you needed more than those few to understand… well, how things ended between you.”
“Yes,” Draco’s tone became mocking. “Did you think all the Aurors do is stare out at the street to make sure no one meaning you ill blatantly comes and knocks down your front door? They’ve got all sorts of charms to monitor who enters and exits the home, Harry. There’s a battalion of them out looking for you right now!”
Harry scanned his eyes over the room for a long moment, letting this settle in. “Merlin this is so weird.”
“Yes,” Harry said, “Let’s take Gandalf for a walk before dinner and I’ll tell you all about it. We can get some dinner while we’re out or something.”
“There’s only three from Ginny?” Harry asked as he skimmed over the vials, feeling a little hurt by it.
After a long moment, Draco began to speak in a stilted tone. “I know that you don’t remember, Harry, but please don’t use language meant as a derogatory slur against our sexuality; I don’t enjoy hearing it.”
The-Harry-that-was collapsed on the sidewalk, showing no sign of recognition. He was, in fact, covering his ears with his eyes screwed tight. Malfoy ran towards Harry, stopping a few metres away as a dementor turned to face him with a hiss.
“Yeah,” Draco smiled at Harry before letting it drop and heaving a sigh. “That wasn’t exactly helpful though, was it?”
Draco scoffed and poked Harry in the ribs. Harry wasn’t inclined to complain about, after the way Draco had dragged him up the stairs to his bed to return the favour a little while ago.
Molly and Arthur would take over in the evening. Molly would cook Harry dinner and tut over his low appetite. Arthur took a distraction tact, asking Harry all sorts of questions about muggle technology that he never knew the answers to anyhow.
Harry was rarely left alone over the next three days. Hermione had taken a leave from work (which was probably more easily given than it would have been if they’d been any other two people). Each day she was there when Harry woke, ready to coax breakfast into him. Ron would drop by during breaks in his training schedule to check in on them.
Draco was dressed like the preening posh he was raised to be – you can take the Malfoy from the Manor but not the Manor from the Malfoy, apparently. Harry chuckled at his internal wit and then added, “If anything, you’ve got me worried I’m underdressed.”
“Maybe,” Harry’s face was screwed up with uncertainty. This was all just so bloody weird. “Yeah,” he amended with more confidence. “Let’s do that.”
Snatching another photograph off the wall to toss to the ground, Harry ignored the sound of the door closing behind her.
“Ah, it’s alright, Dud.” Harry brushed off the reminder of how shite the situation was, “Tell me what’s been going on with you over the last year or so.”
“You did?” The flicker of hope in Malfoy’s grey eyes pulled Harry’s internal organs back into order.
“Well Dean’s muggleborn, isn’t he?” Draco glanced sideways at Harry with a teasing twist to his lips.
surprised by all that. But he couldn’t exactly say he was, either. And, for the first time, a small spark of hope flared in him. Maybe the idea that he could get along with Malfoy wasn’t so wildly far-fetched after all.
I know this name, but I know it,” Draco said, frown deepening by the second. “No, no, no,” he murmured as he ran his finger down the list.
“Sure,” Harry nodded, as Hermione wrapped her arm around his shoulders and guided him over to an apparition point.
Harry narrowed his eyes, ignoring that his right eye still stung with the movement. “Why the bloody hell would I do that?”
Harry hadn’t told Niamh, as the nightmares weren’t any worse than he’d remembered them being. “No, but I will, if you think I should. Sorry to have woken you. I forgot the silencing charm.”
They worked quietly together on finishing dinner. Malfoy seemed to know which tasks Harry preferred and took over the others, chopping and mixing while leaving the management of the stove to Harry entirely.
Harry winced apologetically but couldn’t pull his thoughts into a proper response. Which was just as well, because evidently Draco was winding up for a good rant.
A booming announcement echoed around the stadium, announcing the entrance of the Harpies. The entire west side of the stadium jumped to their feet screaming alongside them as the players were announced and flew a loop around the pitch. Ginny slowed down as she approached the Weasley’s box so she could throw a wink at Harry and Draco before racing to catch up with her team.
was one of the first questions he asked after waking with a large amount of memory loss. Probably rude, too.
“You know,” Malfoy said as he put the top slice of bread on his plate, “I think I might need to learn how to unhinge my jaw to manage a bite of this monstrosity. This is a sandwich made for dragons.”
And yet, over the months that had been scrubbed from his memory, they’d truly, undeniably become not just his best mate’s family but
They settled into the sitting room and accepted tea fixed by Kreacher. Harry wished that Molly hadn’t felt the most proper thing for her to do was hide in the kitchen. She was over to help make sure he got on well enough again today, even though he felt much better. Molly could’ve taken Longeman down a peg himself, Harry figured.
“Thanks,” Malfoy’s smiled widened, and he leant in towards Harry, lips puckered slightly. Malfoy fully stumbled backwards when he realized what he’d been going to do and he stuttered out an apology, looking horrified.
Harry’s dreams were fragmented and stressful. On waking, a sharp headache pushed out all memory of what it was he’d been dreaming about anyways. With relief, he found a pain potion on his side table which he took down in a series of small sips. The sound of soft voices drifted from downstairs.
“Fine. Honestly. The noise hasn’t been too much or anything.” Harry scraped his thumb up and down the side of his mug for a minute before asking. “Is Draco still looking?”
Harry followed along as their past selves headed to the park and watched his own image become blurry as he headed across the field with Andromeda. Turning to watch how Teddy thrived on Draco’s undivided attention, giggling happily while strapped in a baby swing, Harry felt warmth flood him. He completely missed the signs of the dementors coming in.
“Harry?” The sound of footsteps came rushing down the stairs and Malfoy banged on the door to the bathroom. “Harry, what’s wrong?”
Malfoy insisted that Harry take the lead with Teddy on the way to the park after lunch. Teddy clamped his small hand around Harry’s and toddled along the sidewalk, seeming to know where he was going. Once in a while, from where he strolled behind them with Andromeda, Malfoy would call out a direction because apparently Teddy did not, in fact, have the ability to successfully navigate just yet.
He’d seen them together twice since returning home. That morning after he’d invited Malfoy to move back in and then the other night for dinner. They seemed to have an easy camaraderie between them, something that Harry, with his miniscule amount of relationship experience, figured was rather important.
“Like hell it won’t! If there are people out there who are still stupid enough to believe that you’ve not only managed to manipulate me, but nearly every other person of notable importance from the war, they need to be set straight. And Longeman’s just a bully, plain and simple.”
“I think I can manage to keep myself safe for an hour long run in a muggle park, Draco. I’ve survived a lot worse, as it happens.”
Draco puttered around the kitchen, pulling different ingredients and tools out. Often, he had to go back into cupboards when he realized there was something else he needed.
Draco pointedly flagged down Aberforth to put in orders for shepard’s pie and butterbeers, and once everyone had put in their orders, turned to Hermione. “So what’s in that file of yours?”
The boy abruptly turned his hair black and curly to match Harry, then platinum blonde and smooth to match Malfoy, who smirked widely at Harry. He quickly pulled his smirk in and turned back to Teddy when Harry met his eyes curiously.
That didn’t quite work as he’d intended because Harry felt his stomach turn leaden as he thought of all the photographs hung in Grimmauld Place. “I’m pretty sure I don’t remember.”
