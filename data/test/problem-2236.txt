Blaise sighed, “It doesn’t matter. He’s, you know, a war hero, Gryffindor, pure-blood who doesn't have red hair. Practically a golden ticket. I’m sure his grandmother is in negotiations for his hand in marriage. As I am not a female, nor part of the Sacred 28, I am not a candidate for Neville.”
Astrid had gotten up early and gone into the cellar to look over the potions ingredients kept at the house. She thought it would help to be able to recognize the more common items quickly when she was watching me work, not to mention for class. When Scorpius came in to collect her she was standing before a shelf that held mostly jars of leeches, and Murtlap tentacles, and looking between her book and the bottles.
Hermione leaned in to hug Harry and said, “You have enough between you to work out without someone here to meddle, and there’s no way I could keep my mouth shut.”
"I should make you wait until the supplies come in." Draco palmed Harry's cock through his jeans and pulled him into a filthy, promising kiss.
They worked together in silence for the rest of the day, with Pansy filling in the mortar and Harry placing the stones. When evening came Harry gave her an awkward little smile and said, "See you tomorrow."
Daphne stared at him, tilting her head. "Level with me Savior, how did you manage to take out Voldemort when you're this oblivious?"
"Hey," Neville said, gripping Blaise by the hip and pressing a soft kiss to his lips. "I'll be in the greenhouses today after 6th period. Join me?"
“In the shower,” Harry replied, enjoying the look of surprise on Lucius’ face before it was quickly replaced with Malfoy impassivity.
The conversation with Harry lingers in Hermione's mind while she's getting ready. She didn't tell him about the plan. That would have been too much to ask, Harry is terrible with secrets. Instead she had just stated that she had been asked to dinner by Draco Malfoy.
James wrenched his eyes off of Teddy to look at the ugly gargoyle, hoping it would shift his thoughts before he did or said anything stupid. Teddy was only here for another week, then he would go back to uni where he likely had a fan club dedicated to him. He didn’t need to be burdened with James’ ever-growing crush.
Inexplicably, Macmillan smiled. What the fuck was going on with everyone? It was as if they’d all collectively lost their minds.
to vanish Harry's denims. Then, recasting, he used the tip of his wand to trace the line of Harry's erection. The fabric of his pants fell off, leaving his cock exposed. Draco hovered over him for a moment, just looking.
Stepping into McGonagall’s office, Harry was happy to see it was empty, his body was still full of adrenaline from not losing his shit on Lucius.  He cast a tempus charm, 7:30pm. Great, 30 minutes to get ready. When he stepped off the staircase into the hallway he found Draco waiting for him. For a moment neither one of them spoke or moved, just stood, looking the other one over. Harry pulled the galleon from his pocket and sent Hermione a message -
Ron looked between them, heaving a dramatic sigh. "Sure. I want to see you, even if it means spending time with him."
In the broom shed, Harry released the protective charms from his newly acquired LightningBolt broom. He’d received it as a gift from Randolph Spudmore the weekend before eighth year. Randolph had sent it with a letter, detailing the broom’s similarities to the Firebolt, and telling him to please stop by for tea someday. Broom in hand, he stepped out of the shed only to find himself staring into the silver eyes of Draco Malfoy.
Draco hummed a response and Harry felt the adrenaline coursing through him shift from anger to arousal. His body shook with desire as he realized they were truly alone in the classroom. He looked up at the blonde with a feral smile, "Speaking of," he said, stalking towards him.
"I want four barrier spells put up around this mat," Loire said, pointing to the sides of the mat, "It needs to be strong enough that an opponent can fall into it and not break through. Which of you can cast and hold a barrier spell of that strength?"
An hour later Blaise and Ernie went back to their rooms. Pansy told Draco he could stay as long as he swore they didn't have sex of any kind in the room.
“It wouldn’t,” Draco answers honestly. “I’ve never held sex and-” he stops himself before saying anything too telling and Potter’s face breaks into a wide grin. Draco huffs and says, “this in the same regard."
Draco's finger slipped in between Harry's cheeks, and, lube slicked, it didn't take long for him to breach Harry and push inside. "Relax baby," Draco said, his voice gruff and low in Harry's ear.
Hermione lifted her chin and said, "She's apologized for her- for," she waved a hand in a vague gesture, "all of it." She glanced at Daphne, "As for the study group, you and your sister always look nice, nothing wrong with me doing the same."
With the file shrunken down and stuffed into the back pocket of his jeans, Draco apparated to the alley behind 11 Grimmauld Place. Potter was waiting for him, the bag of food gripped in his hand.
Harry grabbed Draco's collar and barely glimpsed the Malfoy smirk before their lips met in a bruising kiss. Every fantasy Harry had had about this moment was shoved aside as second rate when compared to the real thing. For one thing, in Harry's fantasies, they were the same height, but he found he liked that the Slytherin had a few inches on him. Draco's kiss was heated, and passionate but precise. His talented mouth took control of the kiss with perfect pressure of tongue and teeth. When Draco's fingers ran through Harry's hair, Harry took the opportunity to press their bodies together and run his hands along Draco's body touching as much as he could. He moaned into Draco's mouth when his erection made contact with Draco's thigh.
"Pansy," Harry said, his voice sounding far away. "God, are you ok?" His hand gripped the door handle tightly.
"Just come on, and stop being so loud." Teddy looped back on the path to grab James' elbow and move him along towards the gargoyle statues.
George stood back, flashing Draco a feral smile. "Welcome to the back room," he said, motioning for Draco to step in.
“Oh, I do,” Pansy said, rolling her eyes. “You’re both ridiculous.” She moved to pull over the pile of letters that was still on the table.
Leaning against the brick wall next to the front door, Draco tipped his head back to let the sun warm his face. Today had been too long already.
That pulled a reluctant chuckle from Harry until he firmly told himself to stay upset with her, pulled back from the hug and scowled at her. “I prefer when you meddle,” he said.
Harry chuckled and stepped close to Draco again, "Sorry," he said. "I just don't want to fuck this up before it starts."
"No. I'm going to mention it when I'm there for the trials. Robards said I could meet with him beforehand."
Harry and Draco walked through the door to the Headmistress' office to see McGonagall standing stiffly behind her desk.
Draco allowed himself to be pulled back, sheathing his wand, and fixing Dudley with a disgusted sneer, "If I'd known it was you I wouldn't have bothered with the wand. I would have just hit you."
Harry stared at her, unsure of how to respond. He couldn’t tell if she was really trying to tell him something or trick him into spilling his own feelings.
“How’s it going being bonded to Potter?” Draco asked in a whisper, “Does he spend most of his time thinking of new ways to please his fans?”
On his way there he spotted a flash of white blonde hair. He immediately changed course, looking for it again, but the colored strobes weren't helping. Eventually he went back to the loo. When he came out Draco was there, waiting for him.
Astrid felt her heart speed up as she read. She flipped back to the last section of the book and scanned the pages for Draco's name. She had just spotted it when her wrist went warm and she looked down to see a message from Harry.
Neville chuckled, quickly converting the sound into a fake cough. “Sorry,” he said, biting back a smile as Draco turned a glare on him, “just, Blaise is right. You can’t possibly be upset about that. It's not like Blaise made badges and handed them out to the entire student body.”
Harry groaned, throwing an arm over his face, "How is this happening? He's a guy. Why is he so fucking-" Harry cut himself off, afraid of what he might have said.
“Here’s what I would like to do from this point,” McGonagall said, ignoring Harry's question and sliding a piece of parchment across her desk. “I want the two of you to meet together and go over this list of incidents involving Scorpoius and Albus. I know, Mr. Malfoy, that you are a single parent. And Mr. Potter, you are the primary caretaker of your children as Mrs. Weasley is often out of the country for work.”
Scorpius studied her face for a moment, "You're lying." He said the words without any anger, just stated them as a fact.
Then Draco drops to his knees and takes Potter into his mouth, worshipping his cock until the only words Potter can say are '
"Harry," Ginny said, reaching across the gap between them to squeeze his arm, "no one cares that you like boys."
"Go take your shower before you drive me insane," Harry said. He turned back to the blueprints because he can't say the next words without blushing, "and I beg you to fuck me."
“Would you keep your voice down?” he snapped. The common room was full of students, several of them staring at him. At Pansy’s reproachful look, he said more softly, “I don’t need half the room hearing my business.”
Draco knew what he wanted—for Potter to fuck him. But he couldn’t bring himself to ask. Instead, he dragged Potter down for another agonizing kiss. Rutting up against him, he cursed himself for being so needy, so desperate. He felt Potter smirking against his mouth.
He took a moment to regain his breath. In the meantime, Harry pulled his arm back into his lap, gently running his fingers across his forearm. His touch was soothing—like a cold balm, it drove the pain away, until finally only a dull ache lingered. As his pulse steadied, Draco leaned over to look at his arm. Harry was right—even against his pale skin, the Mark was a formless grey smudge. It could have been mistaken for a bruise.
Slowly, Draco, said, “I know where we can get one. Severus’ Pensieve. My parents inherited it. It’s at the Manor, in my father’s study.”
“Don’t worry,” she reassured him, “I doubt the others know. Honestly,” she lowered her voice to a conspiratorial whisper, “I don't think any of them can imagine the possibility that you and Harry might not hate each other. You could snog right in front of them and they’d come up with an excuse.”
Harry’s hand twitched, and for a second Draco thought he might reach for him. Instead he stood, a funny look on his face as he said, “Come on, let’s get going.”
He had no interest in dueling—still drained from his session with Potter, Draco found it difficult to stop himself from swaying. But he refused to look weak in front of the others. Grimacing, he took a deep breath and then sliced his wand through the air. Blaise repelled his hex easily.
“What is this, Master Draco?” Kreacher asked, coming closer. Slowly, he took the ring out of Draco’s palm and examined it. Upon spotting the crest, he gave a little yelp and stared up at Draco with watery eyes.
“You’ve told her, then? About…” Draco wanted to say “us,” but that sounded odd. As though there was any sort of him and Potter that formed an “us.”
“Just go,” said Draco, more pitifully than he had meant to. “You don’t understand what I—this isn’t how—”
“You looked terrified. Like you were about to be sick. I thought you were going to keel over. You’re still pale.”
As their Hogsmeade weekend loomed closer, Draco found himself distracted more often than not. He would be reading through a passage from his textbook when suddenly his mind slipped off, flipping through various worst-case scenarios and how these might affect his parents and their future prospects. He was worried about his father’s hearing. The
“Okay.” Harry’s eyes roved over his face, as though cataloguing his every feature. Finally, he said, “I’m going to kiss you again.”
The Great Hall was decorated beautifully for Christmas Eve. Enormous pines, trimmed with baubles, garlands, and hundreds of glowing fairies stood proudly around the room. Hagrid had spent the better part of the morning hanging wreaths along the walls, and great, thick snowflakes drifted down from the enchanted ceiling. Although Draco’s appetite still wavered, even he had to admit that the feast was quite good: honey-glazed hams, nestled in piles of sprouts; whole roasted duck, turkey, and chicken; potatoes prepared several ways; and, of course, an endless selection of puddings. As there were so few of them, faculty and students alike sat at one large table. Even with Proudfoot there, Harry was in high spirits. The eighth years—including themselves, Greg, Anthony Goldstein, the Patil twins, and Hannah Abbott—had been offered wine, and Harry was draining his glass at an alarming rate. He giggled, face red, as he insisted that Draco wear the golden crown that had emerged from his Christmas cracker. When Harry turned to ask Goldstein about his internship at the Ministry, Draco hastily took his wine glass away and set it at the end of the table. He swore he saw McGonagall titter at that.
“Brilliant,” he said, smiling ruefully. “Of course, it’s a bit odd, isn’t it, being married at a time like this…you want to be happy, and start your life together, but then there’s so much work to do…so much happening…”
Harry had a very odd look on his face. They eyed each other, Draco urging his hands to stop trembling, when Harry suddenly seemed to make up his mind. “Come with me.”
“Xenophilius Lovegood…that’s Luna’s dad, he lives near the Burrow…looks like they’ve visited a few times, that’s nice…”
Harry’s hand was on his shoulder, holding him down. The pain in his arm was so great that he couldn’t help but try to yank away. “Hurts,” he mumbled, gritting his teeth against the ripples of agony.
Potter took his cock completely in his mouth, down to the base. Draco watched, speechless, as Potter sucked him off, moaning low in his throat. He was going to come. He was going to come. He meant to warn Potter, but he couldn’t even get the words out. His cock stiffened, there was a heartbeat where he couldn’t even move, and then finally he came. He gave a strangled cry as all of the tension seeped out of him. He poured himself into Potter’s mouth, who took it all. He brought Draco through his orgasm, gently sucking until Draco was so sensitive that it bordered on painful. Finally, Potter stopped and came to lay next to him. He stiffened for a moment as Potter nuzzled against him, and he thought of complaining, but he decided that he was too tired to bother. Besides, Draco's hands were still itching to feel him, and so he contented himself with lazily wrapping an arm around him. They stayed like that for quite some time, listening to each other breathe, Draco focusing on the circles Potter was drawing on his back as he tried to regain his breath. He felt weightless, laying there with Potter, basking in the glow of his orgasm.
“S’alright,” Draco muttered, passing Potter the vial. He closed his eyes and began to absently thread his fingers through his hair. In truth, he was nervous.
“Father? Your Floo is being watched?” Draco sat up in alarm. “If they catch you, if they suspect you of anything—”
“We’re doing everything we can here. I assure you my lawyers have considerably more experience in these matters than you,” he said coolly. “Anyway, there are still two more hearings to go, as I’ve said...and these are only rumours. Still, your mother thought it preferable that you hear the news from me before reading it in the papers.”
Potter raised his mug in Draco’s direction without looking his way. He watched as Potter draped the towel over his shoulders and propped open his book. Feeling as though he had been dismissed, Draco looked around the room aimlessly. They were trapped. McGonagall had reassured them that come September they should be able to leave, but nothing was guaranteed. On those few occasions when Draco allowed himself to reflect on their current predicament, he felt a nasty twinge of guilt. It was his fault they were stuck together, after all. That was another point of contention between them—while Draco insisted that he was to blame, Potter vehemently disagreed, arguing instead that the list of culprits included Dumbledore, Snape, Draco’s parents, the Dark Lord, and, predictably, Potter himself. Draco quickly learned that Potter was an expert at self-flagellation.
Draco relented, resting his head back onto the pillow. Hot needles drove into his arm, the pain so acute it was nearly numbing. Finally, those horrid red eyes faded away, and with them the pain in his Mark.
“So I just…keep reminding myself of all the stupid things you’ve done. And it, uh…” He looked away, embarrassed. “It didn’t…”
“Where are you going?” Pansy asked, looking up at him in surprise. “We’ve got almost an hour before classes start.”
“I can’t believe this,” Pansy hissed. She jumped to her feet, face reddening. “What’s wrong with him? You think if Potter, or Weasley, or Granger, if they were having a hard time—because of what they’ve
Draco held up his hand to quiet her; he had expected the skeptical looks on their faces. “I’ll tell you what’s going on, but you need to drop it after that. Alright?”
“And the chance to learn from Potter, the greatest wizard the world has ever seen.” Zabini smirked. “I always thought your stunners could use some work, Draco.” Nott sniggered.
Draco felt as though a heavy stone had settled into the bottom of his stomach. Forcing his face into a neutral expression, he said, “Alright. And so…what’s your prediction?”
“Up.” Harry wasn’t ready for the sudden release of his restraints. He sagged forward, face falling into the sheets, and he took a moment to flex his aching wrists. “Up, and on the floor. Go on.” Everything in him said to obey that voice, and so he did. Scooting off the bed—careful to avoid rubbing his sore arse against the sheets—he scrambled to the floor, resting on his knees. From this position, he could finally see Draco properly: the smooth expanse of his stomach, his pale flesh that seemed to just go on and on and on, his grey eyes and his pouty little mouth and his straight nose that came together to form a face that had no business being so beautiful. Harry’s cock was sore at the sight of him.
Potter shook his head, and Draco felt his heart leap. There was something irresistibly erotic about the thought that he was Potter’s first.
Deflating somewhat, Lupin took out his wand. “Whenever you’re ready, then. Just hold my arm.” Feeling as though he was about to collapse, Draco looked up at Potter, who was staring at him. His eyes were angry, hurt…but there was something else there. Something stubbornly hopeful. Overcome, Draco placed his hand on Lupin’s arm, and his stomach turned as they Apparated away. His last thought was of Potter's plants, withering out in the garden.
Draco felt powerless to resist as Harry dragged him through the corridor. He already knew where they were headed. At the Fat Lady’s Portrait, Harry said, “Fred Weasley,” and pulled him through the portrait hole. It was déjà vu as Harry dragged him up to the empty boys’ dormitory. Draco felt oddly as though he was intruding, as though he didn’t belong anymore.
“I’m glad my parents stayed out of it,” she mused. “Though of course, you know…I think they agreed with it all. I still don’t know if…well, anyway.”
“I wanted to talk to you about your father,” Harry said. “I’ve been trying to get a hold of Shacklebolt. I think if you—”
But Harry was slowing to a halt. Draco thought that perhaps he meant to recast his Warming Charm, or adjust his gloves, but instead he hovered in the air, looking off into the distance.
Theo was already levitating another table towards theirs. As they drew closer, Granger and Weasley gave them tight smiles, chattering with Lavender as they took off their cloaks. Draco looked past them and up at Harry. For a moment, their eyes met. Harry smiled softly at him before turning to greet Theo, who had stood to clasp his hand. They shuffled around to make room for three more chairs; Draco pretended not to notice as Harry sat across from him.
From the affronted look on Pansy’s face, he knew he hadn’t heard the last of this. But for now, she held her tongue, and that was enough. Even though he hadn’t had a flashback, the nausea rolling through his stomach was just as acute. He knew, rationally, that he was safe; it wasn’t as though his mother could march into Hogwarts and drag him to Azkaban with her. But none of his reasoning seemed to quell the terrible sense of dread that blanketed him like a cloak.
They worked in silence for a moment, Draco finely slicing his aconite stems, until Zabini said, “God, I can’t stand him looking over here. What the hell is wrong with him?”
“No, no…St. Mungo’s…some of the patients get a bit, er, rowdy…” There was a moment of silence as Theo considered him. “You should think about coming with us, though. We went for lunch afterwards. I bet he’d really like to see you.”
It was difficult to ignore that little prickle of mistrust. But Harry’s open, eager face was reassuring. “Fine. But you could have warned me.”
Draco gave a half-hearted smirk as he said, “I think I’ve used you plenty of other ways over the last couple of months.”
As they broke for lunch, Draco caught sight of Potter on the way to the Great Hall. He was flanked by Weasley and Granger; Draco couldn’t think of any way to get his attention other than bumping their shoulders together roughly as he walked by.
All at once, Harry’s wand burst to light. It took a moment for Draco’s eyes to adjust. Blinking at the approaching figures, he took out his wand, gripping it warily. He doubted very much that his father would be brave enough to come to Hogwarts to fetch him—and anyway, how could he leave the Manor?—but perhaps he had sent someone else in his stead. Or maybe it was Proudfoot, come to confront him again...or maybe Nott had contacted the Ministry after all, and those were two Aurors, coming to arrest him...
Well, my friends...this fic will now have five parts. I just couldn't do it justice by cramming everything into four chapters. I hope to have the last part to you soon! In the meantime, please enjoy.
She smiled at them and then glided out of the room. The moment she left, Draco sank back into the sofa, letting out a sharp exhale.
As she struggled to answer, Draco squatted next to his father, whose face was still pale. Their eyes met for a moment and then Draco, overcome with emotion, reached out and took his hand.
“Where’s the string?” Draco asked, looking around at the debris from the owl’s graceless landing. “There was a green string.”
“Hufflepuff has a good Keeper in Cauldwell,” he said, sipping his drink. It took everything in him not to smirk at the look of outrage on Harry’s face.
Draco had meant to avoid Potter, he really had, but as usual his plan went horribly awry. Potter had started to coincidentally run into him all over the castle—in the loo, in a deserted corridor in the dungeons after Potions, in an empty classroom on the fourth floor. And they still continued to meet for their Tuesday lessons, though by now they didn’t spend much time practicing. During their Thursday study sessions, Draco tried to keep his distance from Potter, lest anyone suspect something. It didn’t help that Potter was constantly looking his way, grinning whenever their eyes met, watching Draco as he instructed the students. On one such occasion, Draco pretended not to see Potter smiling at him and was about to head over to a pair of helpless Hufflepuff boys when he suddenly heard shouting. He groaned as he recognized Pritchard’s voice.
“Why won’t you just let it be?” he raged on. “Do you know what my father’s done, Potter? How many people he’s tortured? Killed?” Draco gave a bitter laugh. “If they want to give him the Dementor’s Kiss, let them. He’s earned it.”
, he thought to himself, although he couldn’t find the energy to truly be angry with him anymore. In truth, he wasn’t that bothered by Potter’s part in his escape from a lifetime in Azkaban. After everything Draco had seen, and continued to witness, their rivalry felt like silly schoolboy nonsense. In fact, the whole lot of it—the House Cup, the Quidditch Cup, the interhouse rivalry—it all seemed trivial now. It was hard to imagine a future where he could return to his lessons or partake in the old Hogwarts traditions as if nothing had happened. As if his entire world hadn’t been flipped upside down, and him along with it.
Draco looked up and saw Blaise and Pansy staring at him. He shook his head. “No. Of course not. Why should I care?”
Draco pushed the hair out of his face. His ears were ringing. If he really focused, he could just make out his father’s grey eyes staring down at him. But that was it.
“Hot,” Potter finally mumbled. It took Draco a moment to realize that he was talking about the temperature in the room. Although he was loath to move, he eventually reached over, took his wand, and cast a Cooling Charm. The burst of fresh, cold air was blissful.
“Well.” Something funny was happening in Draco’s stomach. He couldn’t tell if he felt sick or not. Either way, he very much did not want to have this conversation in Flourish and Blotts.
He was unable to respond, unable even to turn to her. His heart beat furiously. He opened his mouth—to say what, he didn’t know—when suddenly he was jostled by the surging crowd of students. Snapping out of his reverie, Draco looked around wildly and saw Potter of all people staring at him. He gazed back, for some reason utterly lost and unsure of where else to look. Potter was surrounded by Gryffindors, Granger on his right and Weasley at his left. His expression was stern. Their eyes met as Potter strode past, staring at him, and then Draco felt Pansy’s hand on his forearm.
All at once, the players burst out onto the pitch, cutting through the air to thunderous applause. Madam Hooch was striding out into the centre of the field, carrying the wooden box that contained the Quaffle, Bludgers, and Snitch. The players assembled into a loose circle around her with their captains, Weasley and Harper, meeting in the middle. As Hooch lectured them on the importance of avoiding any physical contact and other “dishonest behaviour,” Draco glanced across the pitch at the Gryffindor box—he could have sworn Potter was looking his way. He passed a hand through his hair nervously and tried to focus his attention on the game as Hooch gave a shrill blast of her whistle.
“Is that so?” Naked, Draco could feel Harry’s cock dragging against his thighs. His heart clenched painfully when he realized that Harry was already leaking; he could feel the wetness. “Fuck,” he mumbled, unable to stop himself. He was nearly delirious with need, but he told himself to slow down. He finally had access to Harry, and he planned to take advantage.
“Yes, Potter, I know what you’re talking about,” he breathed. “I know exactly what you’re talking about. But what the fuck do you want me to do about it?”
He grabbed a t-shirt and his bathroom bag as well, deciding a long shower before turning in early would be his best bet for a drama free evening. When Harry opened the bathroom door he was assaulted with sound that hadn't been there before. Pansy was wrapped up in the arms of Blaise Zabini, who was leaned back against the wall. Taking in the scene, Harry realized that there must have been a silencing charm up.
"I'd much rather relive that part of the trip than the hangover," Harry replies, thinking of how good it felt to let Charlie pin him to the bed with those strong arms. “Shame you brought a date to my birthday party.”
He wandered through the hallways trying to settle his spinning thoughts. He wanted the next trial to never come, and yet be done and over with all at once. He wanted to just go home, drink Dreamless Sleep, and pass out for days. Harry’s thoughts were interrupted as he turned a corner and a group of people stood staring at him wide-eyed.
Before Lucius could respond, green flames, just behind Lucius, jumped to life again, and Narcissa Malfoy stepped out of the floo, around her husband. Keen blue eyes landed on Harry and he fell silent at the sight of her, his memory of their last encounter flooding his mind.
"We have Professor Slughorn working on an antidote..Or we will, when he's done analyzing the potion from your school robes."
. That’s different. I try a lot of things on my father and they very rarely work. Sometimes he rewards me for the effort, but he’s never fooled. In general, if I really want something from him, I go with straight honesty.”
Harry felt a blush start on his cheeks at Luna's words, "I don't… I just…" he fumbled. "Would you mind if I work with you?"
Harry glanced over Draco's shoulder and found a rather attractive blonde looking nervously at the pair of them. He seemed to be obediently waiting for Draco to come back. Harry felt his body heat up instantly and he tried to push down the wave of jealousy.
Harry always left at 5 so he could miss any other students at the floo, but he and Pansy lost track of time. At 5:30 they got a visitor.
Hermione lifted a brow, did a perfect mimic of the haughty Malfoy smirk, and said, “Oh I’ll be there, ready and waiting for you to ask me for help.”
Harry tossed himself on the couch next to the fireplace. He was happy for her, and proud of her for finding a way to help her parents. His thoughts traced back to the day Hermione had stolen her parents memories, and then his mind started to push other painful memories forward. He stared at the wall feeling a wash of grief hit while his mind assaulted him with images of the people who were gone.
"I'm not seducing you. I've been your friend for a long time and we're practically siblings. Now come over here and tell me what's wrong."
Harry slid into the booth and turned over his plastic water cup. Malfoy had insisted they get Indian food at the diner two blocks over. He looked across the table to see the blonde carefully unwrapping his silverware and placing the utensils on the napkin, evenly spaced. Harry cleared his throat, causing Malfoy to look up, and gave a tentative smile.
"I am appalled to even have you at this school," Umbridge continued, mistaking Harry's silence for compliance. "You're only going to infect the other students with your lies and deviant sexual acts."
After one of the longest showers he'd ever taken, Harry dressed in a baggy pair of denims with a tight t-shirt that had a picture of a snitch fluttering about his chest. He pushed his hair around until some of it fell over the scar on his forehead. Then he ate the dinner Kreacher had made and headed to the wizarding club, Double Arrow.
Malfoy swallows thickly as though he’s fighting his own reply. Finally he says, “I’m sure you have plenty of fans willing to take you out for the gala. Krum would probably fly in from Bulgaria if you asked nicely.”
Potter seemed like an all right kisser, and from the looks of it, he'd managed to slip a bit of tongue into their kiss. Not as much as Romilda had given Daphne, but some. Blaise was surprised that the only thought he heard from Potter was one word.
Blaise followed him through the common room. Draco stopped before the knights and turned back to Blaise.
Draco gives him an easy smile. "Then I reckon you're buying because I don't have any Euro on me." It seems like the right thing to say because Potter relaxes and asks Draco about France.
Umbridge shrieked, a gloved hand covering the small cut on her cheek. "You tried to kill me!" she cried, now pointing her finger at Draco. "You're in league with him!" She was backing towards the door now, "I'm going to have you in Azkaban for this. Both of you!"
Twenty minutes later Harry was on a floocall with Kingsley Shacklebolt, setting up a meeting with him at 7pm. Narcissa and McGonagall had decided to use Harry's status to get a meeting with the Minister of Magic handled tonight, instead of waiting for him to contact Hogwarts. McGonagall was certain that they could beat Umbridge if they got to Shacklebolt with the facts first. Narcissa encouraged the idea, saying that Lucius would be able to provide an abundance of ammunition against Umbridge, if he was given the chance to speak to Shacklebolt. Harry had readily agreed to make the call, fairly confident that the Minister would see him.
“I don’t give a fuck about the sacred 28, Blaise.” Draco shouldered his school bag and walked into the hallway motioning for Blaise to follow him. “Don't you understand? Potter won. His mother was a muggle and he still brought down the Dark- he still won the war.”
Draco drank it down and when Kreacher appeared immediately, he asked the elf to switch them both to Black Firewhiskey on the rocks. Kreacher complied serving them a shot each, in fresh glasses made of fine crystal that Harry had never seen before.
"That's quite an ego Potter," Draco said without opening his eyes, a smile tugging at his lips, "Are you sure it can fit in here with all of us?"
Ginny's face pushed back into the fire, "I can get her off your back if you let me watch you make out with a boy of my choosing," she said, giving him a wicked grin.
"Hermione," Astoria said, keeping her eyes on Draco, "don't answer that." She reached out to tug the sleeve of Hermione's robe. "Come on, let's eat dessert in your room."
In walked a pretty girl with purple streaks in her hair and thick black eyeliner. “Anna,” Draco whispered, taking in the site of her apprentice robes. He reached forward to grab the framed picture of her artwork and shoved it into the top drawer of his desk.
“Will you need to counsel yourself then?” Draco's cold voice cut in. “For what happened at the door with my son, I mean.” He was seated on the couch with one arm along the back, his fingers just barely grazed against Harry’s shoulder. To anyone else he would appear casual, but Scorpius could see his tense shoulders. He knew his Father was holding back.
"I know you're not with Ginny. I just- there was a picture of you with the Quidditch player," Draco trailed off with a one-shouldered shrug.
Blaise spotted Draco in the common room with Hermione and Astoria. They were reviewing each other's potion's essays that were due in the morning. Blaise wasn't sure what the motive was for Draco to attend these study groups but he knew they were helping.
Draco was taken aback, surprised that he and Boot actually agreed on something. Perhaps coming to him was the right thing to do. Perhaps Draco would get out of this assignment on the grounds that it was a complete waste of time. “In that case-” Draco started, then stopped when Boot held up a hand.
When Draco chuckled, Harry could feel it as much as hear it and it made him wrap his arms even tighter. "That was just to take the edge off," Draco whispered. "When I get you into a bedroom I'll make you beg for release."
"So you're still convinced I-" he said, cutting himself off as Draco walked up clad in a bathrobe with wet hair and a basket of products.
Professor Loire was staring at the fireplace when Harry said, "I can leave with him. We can just leave."
"Oh yeah," Harry replied. "This isn't run of the mill sweet sex. It's…" he trailed off, unsure how to classify it, "it's rough, and loud. I call him the Wallbanger."
“Harry," Draco said, "I’ve spent half my life thinking of ways to get your attention. I'm not giving that up now.”
Blaise blinked, running that last sentence through his head again to see if he had missed something. "A breakdown?"
"I know," Pansy says with a dramatic shudder, making Draco laugh. "Anyway, I wanted to let you know she's coming tonight."
The door opened. Neville walked in dropping his bag and school robes on his bed, closest to the door. "Hey Blaise," he said.
Draco, who had just slipped in his shirt and was starting to button it, paused and looked up at him. "Sure."
Draco held his right hand out to Pansy who placed her wand in his. "Sorry Potter," Draco said, "no games this time." With that, he shot out an expelliarmus and caught the wand in his left hand before it could soar past him. Draco dropped Pansy's wand into her waiting hand and stared down at his own. He took a shaky breath before sliding it into his robe. When Draco looked back to Harry he said, "Thank you, again."
When Harry opened the door Pansy Parkinson was standing on the other side of it with her arms folded and an angry pout on her face. Standing next to her was a putout Draco Malfoy. Harry looked them both over carefully and said, "No," and shut the door.
"I think your mother knows," Potter says when he grinds his erection against Draco's thigh. "I think she caught me checking you out."
Luna linked hands with Harry and started to pull him out of the hall, describing different renovation projects along the way. When Harry started to hear the voices of other students he dropped her hand and pulled back. Luna stopped and looked at him.
Teddy looked away, running a hand through his vibrant hair. “It means you’re much younger than me, you haven’t any experience with men, and if I fuck things up with you I will lose half my family.” He drew in a deep breath before continuing, “But I can’t lock it away anymore, I can’t ignore the way I feel about you and I can’t pretend to be so oblivious as to not see the way you look at me.”
he thought, remembering the detailed description from the stories. How the material felt on his fingertips as he slid his hand past them to wrap his-
They stood for a moment, Draco collapsed against him, Harry collapsed against the wall, until their breathing slowed. Eventually, the haze of his orgasm cleared enough for him to think again. He carefully turned Harry back around to give him a deep kiss. “Clean us up so we can go.”
Harry presses a finger to his own smirking lips before replying. "Don't tell anyone. You know how this lot is. They'll have me blacked out if I let them have any say in how much I drink."
“What?” Harry looked up to see a storm brewing in those grey eyes. “Oh! No! No, I think it’s about time actually.” He gave Draco a rueful grin, “But I’m not going into the house right now. They just went in there half-dressed and keyed up.”
By the time Orion played enough to tire himself out and go back to sleep it was nearly an hour later. Even after being distracted, Harry couldn’t get the night’s events out of his head. He laid in bed till 4 am considering the morale issue of wanting to get off while having a kitten in bed. Exhausted from too little sleep, and still hard, Harry huffed and climbed out of bed, heading to the ensuite. At least the shower would be private, and help him wake up.
Harry advanced. "No," he said easily, wrapping his arms around the blonde's waist, Harry walked him backwards, "I'm not the present," he kicked the door shut behind him, "just my mouth."
“I agree,” Harry said, his voice gentle and sincere, “I would be happy to have you use my last name if I thought it would serve you, but it won’t. However, I recommend you let Narcissa Malfoy call you whatever she pleases as long as it’s polite, which this is.” He sighed heavily and added, “Let’s see the damage then, how much of the family did she request?”
Harry smiled at the use of his first name, curled into Draco's chest and prayed he wouldn't have nightmares about the cupboard.
Draco's client gasped and backed up against the wall. Harry reached up to touch the antlers, just to solidify their existence, and feigned shock. "Oh I'm so sorry. Are you Muggle? This is just a bit of magic, nothing to be afraid of."
Potter rests his forehead on Draco's shoulder. "I appreciate your vote of confidence but I'm no match for Hermione. Especially vengeful Hermione. Ron's lucky he's not being kept in a jar like Skeeter."
“Please, please,” Harry whispers, pulling Draco down for another desperate kiss. “It’s enough. I’m ready.”
"Do you mind if we hide in here for a moment?" Potter asked. "That woman out there is a bit of a stalker."
“I have to say Scarhead, I thought you were exaggerating about your fans,” Pansy said, pulling Harry’s attention.
Malfoy cocks his head slightly as though he’s considering her, the barest hint of a smirk on his lips. “You forgot to mention that he’s a ginger.”
Harry ran a hand through his wild hair, “Luna is a different year. Other than that there’s only Ginny, and she wouldn't keep her hands off me if we were caged together like this. So no," he glared at each of them, "there are no 'appropriate females' here." He'd never used air quotes before, they were nice for times when you needed to condescend.
Hermione looked at him, her steady gaze full of a hundred questions. Even the Room of Requirement seemed to hold its breath as they all waited for her to answer. "I would like that, thank you."
"Kreacher, bring up three dinners," Potter said. He glanced at Blaise and shrugged. "Malfoy probably doesn't want to eat down there without you. If he doesn't want it, Kreacher can take it back."
Harry looked down and watched as Draco expertly moved his hand, twisting his wrist every so often, until he gave himself over to his climax shamelessly. His body shuddered, held up by his boyfriend's arm, which pulled him forward into a kiss that swallowed his breathless moans.
Harry slowed his pace, standing just out of view to listen in. He'd never quite kicked the habit of eavesdropping. Hermione said he'd picked it up at the Dursley's and had it reinforced during the war.
Harry looked over at Parkinson. She was easy to spot, sitting next Malfoy at the table, in a red dress. "Yeah, sure, I guess I've noticed." He shook his head and pulled out the bottle of Ogden's from his bag. "I brought this, too."
“No,” Potter said with a grimace, “not down here. I convinced her to give me the counterspell and moved her to a room upstairs that has a view of the gardens.”
Harry didn't offer a greeting when he arrived just started working. After the lunch his mind was a hurricane of memories that cracked into his fragile sense of sanity. He tried to shove them all back into the corner of his mind, tried to distract himself with the work. For nearly an hour he levitated stones into the broken wall, trying and failing to make them fit properly. The problem was that every time he got more than 3 stones stacked properly he would think of Sirius, or Lupin, or Tonks, or Fred, the list felt endless. As soon as the thought occurred the stones would shatter and he would have to restart.
“Harry wouldn’t be good for this, he is notoriously bad at being observant, oblivious some might say,” she said in a near whisper, as though she was confessing.
Harry looked over Astoria's shoulder at Draco and said, "I do owe you." Earning him a grin from the blonde.
Draco's jaw tensed, "Well," he said tightly, "that's my exit cue." He set his drink down and stood to leave.
That night, they didn’t even make it up to the bedroom. The sudden divergence from their usual routine had Draco reeling in a whirlwind of emotion. But he didn’t have time to reflect. The kitchen was much brighter than the bedroom—light from the streetlamps poured through the window, illuminating them in an orange glow. The silence in the kitchen was almost eerie as Potter backed Draco up against the counter. Draco jumped as the refrigerator roared to life—he still wasn’t familiar with the appliances’ strange noises. He expected Potter to laugh, but instead he gently cupped Draco’s face, as though concerned for him. Draco growled and pulled Potter towards him, kissing him brutally and twisting his fingers through his hair. He wouldn’t be able to survive it if they started slipping towards having empathy for one another.
Draco rolled his eyes and, with a sharp flick of his wand, cast a Cooling Charm. “No. We’ve been inside all day.”
Draco reached out and placed his hand on Pansy’s arm. “Go away for a bit. Not to London. Further. Blaise wants to travel to North America.”
Pansy groaned, "Oh gross! Stop flirting," she said, throwing a quill at Harry, which he caught and set down on her desk. He leaned down to grab Draco's hand and pull him to the other bed.
Romilda read the card to herself first, then smirked at Harry as she read it outloud, “Never have I ever fantasized about someone in this room."
Pansy narrows her eyes and leans forward, her short black hair brushing her jawline from the movement. "I know exactly what kind of kissing Draco is capable of," she replies, her voice low and nothing short of threatening. She points a finger at him. "Hermione Granger is far too smart for you, Potter. She's going to figure this out and if she cries one tear over either of you I will make you regret it."
"To behave myself so we didn't mess up the schedule," Harry managed, arching his body into Draco's, drinking in the smell of creamsicle. "I can't help it. I had to touch you."
Astoria looked Harry over and stepped forward to straighten his tie, "Hi Harry," she said. She was nearly as pretty as Draco, with porcelain skin and bright blue eyes.
"You hate to follow rules," Draco leaned in and bit Harry's earlobe, whispering, as he said, "What's the harm in breaking this one?"
Harry flinched at the sound of Malfoy’s voice. Everyone stayed silent, staring between him and Malfoy. “Nothing,” Harry said, ignoring the
had sparked a month's worth of opinions from the public. During the public outrage, Draco and Harry had gone for ice cream, played with Orion, and shopped for a new flat near London's South Bank.
Draco huffed a laugh, despite feeling his cheeks heat. He glanced at the window to the ice cream shop, spotting Potter at the counter. There were a couple of people in line ahead of him, so Draco reasoned he should have a few minutes.
Also, if there are any tags I missed that you are really wanting addressed you're welcome to suggest them!
Delores Umbridge spun around at Draco's voice, "An accident?!" she cried. Her bulbous eyes looked near to popping, "You think I don't know wandless magic when I see it? You did this on purpose!" She turned back to McGonagall, "You expel him this instant or I will have you removed from this school!"
Loire turned to the other girl, "Your friends are waiting for you in the great hall. You should both go home really." She turned back to Harry, "And you should consider coming in early to avoid your fan club, rather than late. No one ever shows up before 9am."
Draco's eyes widened, thinking of Hermione's assignment. "I'm not sure it was on purpose," he said. Then, remembering they were supposed to be talking about a story, he added, "It's not bonding or anything."
"Luna and I just bought a load of sweets off the cart," Ginny said. "We were hoping you'd come enjoy them with us?"
Pansy offered him a smile and said, “We can just pretend that I picked the flowers at random if it would be easier for you, Potter.”
Charlie chuckles, the rumbling sound coming from deep in his chest. “He’s not my date, Harry, he’s my boyfriend.”
“I’m not going to lie, I’ll be happy to be rid of your constant narrative,” Blaise replied, offering Potter a smile of his own.
"Well…" Draco trailed off, he had no idea what muggle gay stereotypes were. He felt completely wrong-footed, and sure that any answer would blow his cover. It's not that he'd never
Draco lifted his eyes and looked at him for a long moment, "You really just want a kiss? This isn't about who I am?"
“Oh, I- yeah, I just wanted help with my technique and Nev-” Harry started, cutting himself off when Malfoy leaned closer.
Harry considered the idea that he might be a part of this talk she was wanting to have, and he felt his cheeks heat up again. His mind trailed him easily from thoughts of their future conversation to the one he was going to have to endure with Molly Weasley. He grimaced, and then, remembering about his face, tried to look as though he wasn't thinking at all.
Draco’s eyes go wide. “Astoria Greengrass? As in the woman my parents are in negotiations with for my hand in marriage?”
Hermione laughed, "Because I'm not an idiot, Harry. I knew it would completely distract you. Your obsession with Draco isn't exactly unknown to me."
Blaise walked into the Slytherin common room and beelined for Draco who was sitting on the plush couch next to the fireplace.
They pushed through the door at Grimmauld place at 3pm that afternoon. Harry was carrying a birdcage, food, and a bag full of too many bird toys. Draco followed him in with Pax, the baby Merlin Falcon, who had refused to leave the warmth of his arms.
As they finished their breakfast, Pansy said, “Let’s go to the courtyard. I need to finish that Transfiguration paper.”
“Well, we have to catch up, haven’t we? What else will we have time for?” Pansy turned to Draco, as though he had the answer.
He hardly flinched at the cold press of Harry’s wand on his skin. “Ready?” he asked. Draco nodded. Harry took a deep breath, as though steeling himself, and then said, “Three…two…one…”
“We have our meeting this afternoon at two,” said Slughorn. “You’ll be excused from your class. I'm in Professor Snape's old office now.”
“We go there! Right now!” Harry said, taking up his broomstick. “Come on, if we hurry, we might get there on time.”
Hermione pressed a charmed galleon into Harry's hand before he stepped in to the floo. "Take this," she said, "I told Skeeter 8pm. Contact me if that won't work, and to tell me when you're on your way back."
Hermione smiled. "Thank you, Harry," she said sweetly. "I'm going to take him away now. Have fun tonight, but not too much. Make sure you talk first."
"No, and they didn't ask either. I didn't have a lot of options. You've seen what people are like around me."
Potter hums against Draco’s clavicle, he’s already undone three buttons on Draco’s black Oxford. “I didn’t come here for tea.”
I solemnly swear my schedule for writing has greatly improved. The next Drarry adventure is completely mapped out so I will be able to stick to my word! Thank you for your love and patience. I hope you enjoyed this piece! Please leave me a comment if you want to make my day!!
Finally, they made it to the end of the tunnel to find a red door. Harry cast a detection charm on it, just in case. The words, '
"Draco," Harry huffed a laugh and stood to his feet, "you're such a bottom, I'm surprised you were able to ask that question with a straight face." He leaned in for another kiss.
Harry shrugged, "My tastes haven't changed much since Hogwarts," he said, watching Draco take a broad lick.
Draco huffed, hoping the flush he felt spread up the back of his neck didn’t make it to his cheeks. “Is it the master, or do you use Sirius’ room?”
When Harry woke on Thursday morning he felt wrung out and decided to stay in bed where he spent a better part of the day trying to make a decision about returning to his life or moving to a remote muggle location in Canada to escape the- well, to escape everything really.
"Yeah." Anna nodded. Then she gave Draco a terrifying wink and said to Potter, "How do you like it at the Ministry of Magic?"
That sat in comfortable silence until Potter asked, “Do you know anything about the costumes Draco and I are wearing?”
Teddy grinned, squeezing James’ hand before he dropped it. “The entrance is a bit narrow, but it widens up after that to full height.”
“Pansy,” Hermione said. Harry was surprised to hear fondness in her voice as she continued, “You shouldn’t put so much stock into clothing. I know it’s your passion, but Harry,” she glanced at Harry then, seemingly taking in his outfit for the first time, and grimaced.
Draco smirked and stood to follow Harry out of the room, pausing to lay a hand on Scorpius’ shoulder, “Make sure you pick good colors for us son, perhaps teal and copper.”
Astrid blushed, glancing briefly Scorpius who purposely bumped the table in front of him, causing Teddy’s pumpkin juice to shake and spill out of the cup onto the
"Fuck," Draco said, "fuck, I'm going to Azkaban." His body started to shake, "After everything that's happened, that awful woman is-" he started to sink to the floor.
He leaned against a counter that was selling a sticky sweet muggle version of Butterbeer, that was woefully lacking any alcohol, and surveyed the scene. Draco had listened in on several conversations throughout the night, even joined a few, and decided that there was nothing to worry about. Well, nothing new, at any rate. Some of these muggles did believe the stories were true, but most of them were convinced it was fantasy. As long as the Ministry kept watch over early experiences of accidental magic they wouldn’t need to worry about growing fame of the Harry Potter series.
"Alright. I've been very patient," Potter said, sitting back down. "Would you please tell me what's going on? I had no idea my house would let you waltz in without invitation."
Harry stared at her for a moment and then looked at Hermione, who was behind her. "Is it worth it then? Dating a mouthy spoiled Slytherin? Or you know, whatever you and Ron call what you're doing with this one."
Draco took another drink and his expression went back to relaxed, "Slytherin," he said simply, "I was-"
Harry hummed in response and looked at the shop as well. A few more feet and they would be at the door. He cocked his head a bit and said, "Could you say no to me then?"
He made his way to Diagon Alley. There was a large group of friends waiting for him at the Leaky Cauldron. He had wanted a quiet birthday celebration at the Burrow but too many people had asked for a party. Eventually, he'd caved and let George plan a big bash.
"Don't you dare be so crass," Draco said the words between kisses, rolling his hips against Harry, "as to propose to me at a wedding."
The door opened and they stepped out onto a deck James had never seen before. In the center was a large hot tub, steam rising from the water with jets thrumming under the surface.
Draco and Harry managed nearly another hour together and 2 more glasses of Firewhiskey before Harry stuck his foot in his mouth.
Potter walked out of the restaurant as though the issue was settled. Draco followed quickly behind him. "I don't even have my notes with me," Draco began, "and I need to do more research. I need to research more of the f- the research."
When they reached the door to Kingsley's office the three Slytherins stepped aside so Harry could go in first. Harry knocked, and the door opened immediately. Once they were all seated around his desk Kingsley addressed Harry.
"I don't want to date him," Blaise said, with a quick mental check on his occlumancy walls. He didn't need any of this getting to Potter.
Pansy searched his face for a moment and added, “Would you like me to appeal to your savior complex?” She batted her eyes and put her palms together as if praying, “Oh please Saint Potter, won’t you help us with our task?”
Harry thought about Ginny as well. He was going to have to talk to her before Sunday dinner at the Burrow. The last thing he needed was a pack of Weasleys bombarding him with questions about Draco.
Prompt #: S42 Neither character A nor B knew that there's a hot tub in Grimmauld Place, but they make good use of it, maybe a sentient house?
"Technically that's not his current plan," Hermione cut in, far too pleased with herself, "it's a repeat of his plan during 6th year."
Dudley put a hand down to keep her behind him, still looking at Draco, "I can prove it, let me show you my phone."
Astrid rewarded him with a brilliant and fast spreading blush, he bit his cheek to prevent a triumphant smile. “You could also offer a reason for me giving in to what you want. I find that logic, or something that appears to be logic, works more effectively on those who are practiced in the art of reading people.”
The two of them snuck into their rooms to change for the interview. Hermione had set them up to meet with Rita and her photographer in the great hall.
After dinner, Harry played a losing game of Wizard’s chess against Ron and then trampled him in a game of Exploding Snap. By the time he was ready to leave his cheeks hurt from smiling so much and he was once again thankful for the friendship they shared.
Harry and Pansy both turned to stare at her. Not to be discouraged, Hermione said, "Let's just talk about it. I think it could help. How would you go about seducing him?"
"You know Potter," Draco replied casually, "I've often wondered about that as well." He walked past Harry to follow Pansy into the house.
Hermione snatched her hand from him and playfully punched his bicep, laughing at his bravado, but she didn’t tug up her shirt. Harry wondered if Hermione’s new confidence was a result of time spent with the Slytherin girls.
Astrid smirked, “Right,” she said. She looked back at the invitation and said to no one in particular, “So I’m a Potter now? Is that going to be a thing in the Wizarding World?”
Draco smirked and moved a little closer. Potter still didn't back up, only tilted his head, slightly up, to meet his eye.
"I-" Draco stalled out, startled by the question. "No! No of course not. I just," he looked at the picture again. "Why Potter?"
Potter's eyes widened and he jumped back, grabbing Draco's wrist and dragging him into the coffee shop. He cast a locking charm at the door and turned to the counter. Nora who was standing startled behind the counter, eyed him cautiously.
This was going to be fun. Blaise let a slow smile spread as he stood and walked over to him. Neville was sitting with his back against the wall, legs stretched out in front of him. Blaise gracefully sank down, straddling him. Blaise could feel the heat from Neville's thighs seeping through his denims.
"I'm the lead singer," she said. "The crowd prefers me on stage, and appearing single. Mr. Potter here could keep you company."
Harry stumbled into the new 8th year common room with Ron and Hermione close behind him. All three of them had run from a group of first years with wide eyes and pictures ripped out of the Prophet, begging for autographs.
“All right, here’s your room,” Harry heard the clerk say, and glanced up to see him showing a middle aged man into a dressing room two doors down from his own. Briefly, Harry watched the newcomers to see if they were affected by the sexual tension that was currently
"Ow! Stop that you bloody cow!" Draco said, getting to his feet. He looked over both of them and took a deep breath, smoothing nonexistent wrinkles from his robes. "Fine, I'll go,” he said. “I will find Potter and prove you both wrong. We’ll most likely end up in the infirmary so come visit me there when you get word of the row," and swiftly left the common room.
Draco narrowed his eyes, plucking at the collar of his robes. "I'm an Unspeakable, Potter. What do you want from me?"
Harry was late to meet with the Headmistress. So far he was only one minute late but he still had to suffer through the whole staircase bit before reaching her. Even though she was a Gryffindor, McGonagall was a bit Slytherin about being on time for meetings.
Harry struck out grabbing Draco's left arm, his hand wrapped around the black robes, but they both knew it was also wrapped around the Dark Mark. Predictably, Draco froze with his eyes wide, staring at Harry's hand. Harry took advantage of the moment to spin their positions and press Draco against the door. He was careful to lean in only from the waist up, just in case his cock got hard.
Daphne burst out laughing. “I guess the rumors about Hufflepuffs are true,” she said after catching her breath.
Through it all, he had made time for Draco. Their bodies intertwined, their magic sparking and blending, communicating for them when the words became too much -too little- to express emotion.
"Then why are you asking me to dinner as though I didn't fight on the losing side of the war, or torture you for 7 years?"
"Sorry," Potter said, "again." He chewed at his bottom lip. "That was clever though, the dragon thing."
Something in the man seemed to snap and he stepped closer to the doorway “You disrespectful little brat-”
Emily’s eyes dropped slowly over him, lingering on the way his denims clung tightly to his waist. “I like the muggle clothes. The agency did a good job,” she said, meeting his eye, “you really do look just like him.”
“I have to give you something for one bite?” She asked, under the table she took his hand and threaded their fingers together.
Zabini stared at him for a full minute before speaking. Harry tried not to fidget and settled for tugging at a loose thread in the couch cushion. "You really think I'm talking about a Weasley?"
When the bottle stopped spinning it was pointing at Neville Longbottom. Neville, who didn't seem to be breathing, stared at the bottle for a full minute before finally raising his eyes.
Astrid had never heard him use that term, 'Dad', and she was certain that he kept it reserved for special occasions.
Draco pulled back, leaving only his hand on Harry's chest, pinning Harry to the wall. He was breathing hard and seemed to be fighting his body for control. Finally, he looked at Harry, "I want to fuck you into a mattress. You actually want to date me. Me, Draco Malfoy," Draco sank back into him.
Draco smiled, leaned back in his chair and lifted a corner of fabric up, "It runs diagonally down to my hip bone."
"I- you- it wasn't torture. You were just-" Harry said. Then he sighed and tried again, "OK. The war is long over and you have obviously changed since you're living in a muggle flat. And I wasn't exactly nice to you in school either."
"What are you doing?" he asked from the door as Astrid pushed gently on the back wall of the wardrobe.
Draco chuckled, "Yes that makes perfect sense, having been your girlfriend, your best friend's sister, and a good enough friend to floocall you about going to the club," he said, "I can't imagine how I got the impression that she would know anything about you."
"You vile harpy!" Draco shouted and every piece of glass in the room shattered at once. Several pieces fell from the ceiling where Loire had allowed Neville to hang his air plants, which were kept in glass balls. When the shards hit the floor there were spots of blood on more than one piece.
“Don’t tug on your clothes, Astrid,” Draco admonished. He was walking next to her on the left with Harry on his other side, who was talking with Andromeda. “People only need to do that when something doesn’t fit. Your dress was tailored.”
"After the stunt Potter pulled last night you better have something planned if you want to get even."
Pansy leaves for work after issuing a warning to Potter. “I have wards on my room. If you step one foot in there I will send the Prophet.”
"Don't accept anything to eat or drink when we are at the Manor though," Draco said matter of factly, "just in case."
Blaise had expected for Potter to be upset. He had not expected for Potter to retaliate, at least not the way he did.
Malfoy had several bottles of cologne. Harry had seen them in his trunk while Malfoy was unpacking on their first day here. Only two bottles sat on the shelf in his closet though, he never used the others.
"Hey," he said to Pansy, grabbing her attention, "back me up here. You know he didn't stay the night."
Harry saw a flash of heat in those silver eyes before Draco said, "I'm sure I can manage, Potter. Tomorrow."
Blaise flashed him a smile. Potter was right. They should all skip class. Blaise wasn't sure he'd be able to think clearly enough to retain anything from lectures today. Besides, he didn't know how many times Neville would be willing to give a repeat performance.
"And reminded them you have the order of Merlin, for killing Voldemort, and that you were still suspicious of people who worked in the ministry."
"I was trying to let you down easy, actually. Remind you, yet again, that you are trying to get involved with a death eater," Draco said between kisses, "but my body seems to be confused about the plan."
"I just want to make sure you're here with me when I walk through this door," Teddy's words came out with warm puffs of air against James' cheek. "Magic is finicky and always changing, so it's best if we're touching when I open it."
Once Harry had successfully removed himself from Hagrid’s suffocating hug, and promised to come back to catch up before leaving, he walked the grounds from the hut to the castle and headed for Headmistress McGonagall’s office.
Draco chuckled against Harry, the sound rumbling through his chest, wrapping around Harry's heart. "I love you, Harry," he whispered.
Draco pulled the dress shirt from the hanger, slipping it over his arm and around his back in one smooth motion. He casually looked up then, giving Harry a wink just before the sales clerk came back.
Draco cocked a questioning eyebrow at him, a smile playing on his lips. "You're absolutely right," he set the tie down on the display table, "and you don't need any help bringing attention to your eyes." Then, letting his finger brush against Harry's now exposed palm, pulled out the blue tie.
"Good, go line up" she said, with a gleam of mischief in her eye, she took the list back and pocketed it. The rest of the students filed into class and they all stood against the back wall waiting to get paired off. Professor Loire stood in the middle of the room on a large mat, facing the students.
Charlie’s eyes dance, and he leans in closer to say, “Do you remember what you told me when I had you over my knee?”
Professor Loire struggled down a laugh, turning her eyes toward the ceiling to search for something less amusing. Harry sent her another dirty look.
"No. I just didn't have it in me to listen to you work. Wouldn't want my magic to go wild and take out the wall," he said, only half joking.
Once they were in bed Draco curled up around Harry, who nearly melted into his arms. Kissing Harry's neck Draco said in a whisper, "What was it like, growing up without your parents?"
A brief look of annoyance passed over Draco’s features as he looked at Harry, nearly breaking into a sneer. Then, far more concerningly, his eyes flashed with mischief and he gave Harry a bitter smile.
"OK Potter, listen up," Pansy said. At which point Pansy and Hermione loaded Harry with advice. He tries to compile a mental list in his brain as they talk. He's pretty sure that half of what they say he doesn't remember and hopes that his subconscious picks it up.
"I love you too," Harry said, relishing the last kiss before Blaise broke through Draco's locking charm and stormed in.
"It's not really an easy question to answer," Harry admits, pulling Draco towards him, seeking a kiss.
She turned back to Draco, her eyes searched his face before returning to the picture. “We are not able to bury thousands of stories shared on multiple sources across the internet. Even magic has its limits.”
Harry scowled, "No, none of this is why you came," he said bitterly, and motioned to the glasses and the patio roof. "You just came to get your wand back."
Before Draco can ask what the fuck that means, Potter's leg slides between Draco's and nudges his thighs apart. With the thick press of Potter's cock rolling against his own erection, Draco decides to ignore the statement. After all, Potter has always been weird and Draco isn't going to give up this opportunity.
"Sorry to hear you'll be busy tonight, Draco," Macmillan said, finally removing his hand. Then he gave Draco a wink. "I'm free Saturday if you want to talk."
Blaise left the common room and started on the long walk to the greenhouse. He was pretty confident that the Slytherins were all delusional.
"Hey guys," Neville said, walking up beside Harry. He paused, taking in the way everyone was looking at Harry. "What are you talking about? Is everything all right?"
"I really appreciate all your help," he replied. "This move would have been terrible without the two of you."
Also, I'm a tiny bit behind on fitting this story into my original chapter count, so it might be a bit closer to 15 chapters when it's done.
The moment the bird touched him Harry could feel the difference. It was almost as calming as a patrons being cast. He felt the tension seep out of his shoulders, and the headache that he hadn't realized was starting, faded as well. Harry looked up to find Draco's sharp grey eyes watching him carefully.
The morning of the gala, Harry was sent home from Pansy’s studio with tailored black robes lined in silver embroidered lilies down the front. Pansy had met him there personally to give over the robes, telling him that Draco’s robes would match, the only difference being narcissus flowers instead of lilies. Harry was so shocked by the thoughtfulness of such a gift he found himself unsure of how to respond. Throat tight and unable to meet her eye, Harry choked out a ‘thank you,’ when she handed them over.
Harry grabbed 2 pieces of bacon from his abandoned breakfast and did, indeed, follow them out the door.
Harry and Kreacher spent a few days clearing the Voldemort paraphernalia out of Regulus' room and making it comfortable, so that his two best mates could have some privacy. He was happy to have something to occupy the time.
Malfoy lifted a sceptical eyebrow and let his eyes fall over Harry's outfit again. "So, you're asking me to dinner so we can, what exactly, become friends?"
After talking to the auror secretary about seeing Potter, Draco headed towards the gym on the East side of the ministry. According to the secretary, Potter would be in there with Weasley for something called 'leg day' and he should be done shortly.
Malfoy's eyes drifted over Harry's outfit slowly. He glanced over at the brass numbers, 394, that were drilled into his door frame, then looked down at his own hand, fingers splayed.
“Yes,” Harry replied, breathless. Realizing he was unaware of what he was agreeing to, he added, “Anything, please.”
She smirks at Draco, grabs his collar, and pulls him close. “Only if you give me a real kiss,” she says the words against his lips expecting him to laugh. Instead, Draco wraps his arms around her waist and hauls her into a passionate kiss that Hermione can feel all the way down into her curling toes.
When he got back to Hogwarts it was nearly 2pm and Pansy was already back at work in the hallway they had started that morning. The hallway was the last thing they needed to finish for their part of the renovation to be complete.
Draco rocked against him, Potter's jumper dragging against his cock. The pressure wasn’t nearly enough, and he was starting to whine, desperate for some kind of contact. Potter smirked viciously and, in response, sat back up. Exasperated, Draco growled, and he tried again to pull off Potter’s jeans. All at once, Potter was gripping his hands above his head, and this time he frowned down at him sternly.
“Oh! I actually remember that from my nan. It’s a Chimaera. It means that whatever’s about to happen, it’s going to require heroism. It might even be dangerous.” She took the card from him. “And below it…that’s two snakes forming a Caduceus. A Caduceus means 'exchange.' See?”
“You didn’t look so brave when he was dragging you out of the Great Hall,” Zabini mused, his eyes as sharp as ever.
“Ten,” he challenged, purely because he was sick of Potter dictating things. Before the other man could say anything, he stalked out of the Great Hall.
The breath he had been angrily holding rushed out of him. He gawked stupidly at Potter, not knowing what to say. Oblivious, Potter rubbed his thumb one last time on Draco’s forearm and then readjusted his wand. “Right. Ready?”
“Good God, boy,” Slughorn gasped. The entire class had turned to stare at Draco, but he focused solely on Slughorn, urging himself to stay calm.
“But the actual vial, it’s a Portkey.” Draco couldn't meet Harry's gaze. In a terrible way, he felt as though he was betraying his father. “It’s charmed to respond only to his touch. They’re going to use it to escape from the Manor.”
And then came Lovegood’s dreamy voice: “It’s funny, Harry keeps looking over at the Slytherin box. It could be a Wrackspurt, making his brain fuzzy…”
Draco brushed off Harry's attempts to reciprocate and helped him get his clothes put back. "We don't have time," he said.
Draco shudders at the idea of conversing with his parents about Potter. He glances up at his boyfriend and manages to push those thoughts from his mind.
He was still lying on the rug, quietly chewing over this information, when the flames roared to life. Harry scrambled away from the fire, jumping to his feet. Draco walked through first, followed quickly by his mother, Narcissa Malfoy.
Harry sat on a plush office chair and looked over his coffee mug, across the desk, at Blaise. It was his third cup of the day, and he was so tired that the chair felt comfortable enough to fall asleep. After a few moments of silence he realized that Blaise was waiting for him to respond.
Pansy took a deep breath, dramatically letting her shoulders slump, and said, "All right Chosen one, I won't try to make you leave. But I'm going to be in there too. You may have fangirls chasing you down but the students chasing me down want to do worse than kiss me."
Draco jumped out at Harry from behind one of the trees, "BOO!" he said, then fell into a fit of laughter when Harry jumped and squeaked in response.
Harry stood a bit straighter, smoothing out the deep maroon robes of his Auror uniform. He pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose, giving him a clear view of Draco's sharp, attractive, profile.
Draco snorted. The brief note was hardly “loving.” He felt a pang of guilt for bemoaning his mother’s novellas in the past. She would write to him long descriptions of the gardens in the fall, the holiday dinners they put on leading up to Christmas, the gossip she had heard from so-and-so, the latest remodel she was planning for the study or the sitting room. Some of those letters he had skimmed through before digging into the box of truffles or the Quidditch magazine she had sent him. He realized that for the first time in his life he missed his mother. He hadn’t felt homesick his first year of Hogwarts, and he had never really missed his parents while he was at school. There were moments in his sixth and seventh years when he had wished his parents were there to guide him, but he hadn’t ever really
“We were old Slytherin friends, back in the day. And he rather enjoyed having an insider at the Ministry. He never mentioned me?”
The fact of the matter was that he didn’t want to be around people who associated with one another on the basis of their pure-blood status. It was a stupid reason to be friends with someone. Plenty of them, his parents didn’t even particularly like—after every holiday, every dinner, every cocktail party, his parents spent the next week gossiping. It was one of their favourite pastimes. Blaise’s mother, apparently, was running out of money so quickly that she was desperate to marry again, while Goyle’s father was so stupid they couldn’t understand how he managed to dress himself in the morning. Theo’s father, meanwhile, was derided for his insistence on having only pure blood when, in fact, everyone knew he had several Muggle ancestors. And they had plenty to say about Pansy’s parents and their business dealings. Draco had always wondered what these “friends” said about his own parents.
Draco scoffed. “If Zabini and Nott ever let Weasley win on purpose, I’ll run starkers through the Great Hall.”
Harry was suddenly pulling him into his arms. “It’s going to be fine,” he muttered. “Please don’t get anxious. You’ve been better, lately. Eating, and sleeping. Let's keep it that way.”
“She won’t. Because I’m going to have a little chat with him right now.” Taking back his map, Harry shot Daphne a meaningful look. “Can you bring Draco to the Room of Requirement?”
There was an awkward silence as Draco looked at the ground. Finally, Potter exhaled wearily. “Fine. Tonight. See you.”
Oddly nervous, he said, “So, I just…I’m calm, confident, I think of the spell as I cast…don’t make a big production of it. Go in with intent and keep it simple.”
“Yeah?” Harry breathed. He was suddenly sliding his fingers along Draco’s belt. “So this does nothing for you, then?” Harry’s fingers trailed further down to brush against the unmistakable bulge straining against Draco’s trousers. Frustrated, he pulled Harry closer and kissed him fiercely, growling into his mouth. Harry reached up to cup his face. The feel of the other man’s stubble, the taste of beer on his tongue, the little sounds he made as they kissed—it was maddening.
“Gringotts.” He decided that there was no point in lying; Pansy had the most annoying aptitude for sniffing out his lies.
“Can I go, sir?” He stood up and shouldered his satchel. “I’m tired. I didn’t sleep well last night.” Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Harry frown at that.
“Er, I saw you head into the library.” Potter stood frozen, apparently shocked at his reaction. “We need to talk about our first lesson on Thursday.”
“We’ve just been.” Hermione dug through her bag and held up the little pink planner. “I have to admit, George really knows what he’s doing. It was packed—we could barely even get in. I didn’t know if he could manage, since…”
thought it would be good to start with the basics. See where we’re at. So why don’t you all pair off, and we can start with some disarming spells?”
"I haven't the faintest idea." Trying to appear as casual as possible, Draco opened his trunk and gently tucked his satchel in-between his textbooks.
“Transfiguration, Charms, Defense, Potions, Herbology, Ancient Runes, Arithmancy,” he listed dully. He wanted to tell his father to get to the point—this was the most they had spoken since before summer, and it felt horribly forced.
Mercifully, Tonks and Lupin showed up just as they finished lunch. They came bearing firewhisky, groceries, and letters. As always, there was one letter for Draco, from his mother. He was collecting quite the unopened pile. Lupin, sensing Potter’s unhappiness, started passing out bottles of firewhisky at once.
His father gave a shaky exhale. “I suppose it will all be over soon, anyway. What time does the train leave on Tuesday?”
Potter finally relented, pushing past Draco into the dark confines of the house. Draco cast a quick Drying Charm on himself and headed to the kitchen. It was shabby and cramped. The paint was peeling off from the cupboards, and the stove had two hobs that didn’t work at all. They kept the kettle on one of these broken hobs. Draco tapped it smartly, setting it to boil, as he reached into the cupboard for two mugs. He found the process of preparing tea soothing. Above him, he heard the shower running. He wondered vaguely why Potter hadn’t just used a Drying Charm. Then again, he often preferred to do things the Muggle way—boiling the kettle on the stove, washing their dishes by hand, and tending to his plants without magic. It exasperated Draco to no end. They had been reassured countless times by members of the Order that Potter could use magic here, that the Trace couldn’t locate him, but that didn’t seem to matter.
“Well, we’ve spoken through Floo before.” He frowned. “Or I could just write. Their mail’s being checked, though.”
“No.” He picked at a bit of toast on his plate, having lost his appetite. “I didn’t know what to say. Slughorn told me himself—it’s not like I have a lot of options waiting for me when I get out.”
Draco braced himself as best he could, but it never seemed to matter. Potter’s forays into his memory were an onslaught. His Mark burned, and he tried to wrench his arm away, but Potter held him tightly. He peeled through the layers of memories so quickly that Draco felt dizzy. He suspected that Potter found the entire thing just as unpleasant, and that he wanted to get it over with as quickly as he could. The previous two times, Potter had limited himself to rather benign memories: Draco watching as the Dark Lord settled into the Manor, establishing his childhood home as his new headquarters; Draco using his mother’s wand, reluctant to take it from her and yet needing to protect himself. Now, however, he dug deeper, unfolding various memories before he stumbled upon a scene at the Manor.
"How did you—how did you know?” Draco asked, startled. In truth, he was grateful Harry had found him, because his only other plan had been to stand outside the Fat Lady’s portrait until a Gryffindor came by.
“Oh, Draco,” Pansy snapped. “He just wants to see you, that’s all. Why do you always have to be so difficult?”
Draco sniggered despite himself. As Potter snorted, it occurred to him that they were having a laugh together. Sort of. It was a sobering thought.
As the students around him shouted and clapped, Draco felt dizzy. He knew at once what was happening—another one of his episodes. He gripped his knees, trying to concentrate on the match. Pritchard had just made a spectacular save, earning himself a loud cheer from the Slytherins. Draco tried to bring his hands together to clap, but they were shaking. If only everyone would shut up for a minute. Their screams, the sound of their feet pounding against the wooden stands, Longbottom’s voice droning on…it was too much. He felt as though he was going to be sick. The voice in the back of his head had returned, warning him that something horrible was going to happen, that he was in danger, that there was no escape. Nott was yelling something next to him, but he couldn’t hear over the sound of his heartbeat pulsing in his ears.
Harry quickened his pace to match him, and they quickly fell out of sync, but no matter; he was close to losing his mind as Harry thrust into him.
“What?” Draco felt a bit guilty when Pansy turned to him, surprised. “Of course not. Since when have you been so paranoid?”
“Right, then. See you.” He sidled past him and took the stairs down to the common room two at a time. He had never been particularly close to Greg, but he felt an odd sort of kinship with him: they had survived the Fiendfyre, and they had witnessed Vincent’s death. He wasn’t sure if the three of them had been friends, exactly, but they had struggled through the Dark Lord’s return together, hadn’t they? Filled with an odd sort of grief, Draco settled into an armchair by the fire and flipped through his textbook, not really seeing the words. An hour passed when suddenly the common room door burst open, and a large group of fourth years came tumbling in. Their cheeks were red from the cold, and they were in high spirits, clutching bags from Honeydukes and Zonko’s. Before long, other students started streaming in, laughing, comparing sweets they had bought, and swapping tales of having seen a hag in the Three Broomsticks. Eventually, the other eighth years swept into the common room. While everyone else went upstairs to change, Pansy spotted Draco and pouted at him.
“It’s after midnight,” Harry said. He was patting her head. “I’m sorry, we were trying to be quiet.”
“It’s not my place to say. And stop trying to distract me. This isn’t about Blaise; it’s about you.”
“Please.” A flush of arousal burst through him, so strong that he had to slip his hands between his knees to stop himself from reaching out. “Fuck me with your cock. I want it. Be rough with me.”
“Harry!” Draco jumped at the sound of Slughorn’s voice. He was ambling towards them, a strained smile on his face. “Is everything alright?”
The others sniggered into their drinks as Ron stared up at the ceiling. He had the habit of turning temporarily deaf whenever Harry said anything salacious.
He jumped when everyone around him suddenly scraped their chairs back. He hadn’t noticed, but the lesson must have ended: students were talking excitedly, packing up their belongings, and already heading out the door. Draco looked down at his notes, only half-finished and much of it illegible. Before he could make sense of what had just happened, Pansy was at his side, asking to compare timetables.
Draco settled into his usual spot by the lake. The water was choppy, the waves dark and ominous under the low orb of the moon. He sat back, his palms quickly going numb from the ice-cold ground. The grass was crisp with frost; everyone swore it was finally going to snow any day now. Draco wasn’t surprised when he heard footsteps coming up the path. He looked over and was about to greet Potter, when instead he saw Proudfoot walking towards him.
And with that, Blaise Vanished the empty wrappers off his sheets with a wave of his wand. Draco watched as he sauntered off to the lavatory. His mind was reeling. Of course, he knew that changing his memories wouldn’t change what had happened. He wasn’t an idiot. But a sad, guilty voice nagged at him, wondering if he was getting off easy. Was it fair that he was able to forget the awful things he had done, while those whose lives had been permanently altered—maybe even snuffed out—still bore the marks he had left on them? In some ways, it didn’t seem right.
“I don’t know. We decided that it would be best for your mother and I to have as little information as possible. Who knows, someday the Ministry might decide to send someone actually competent in Legilimency.”
“Better. You want your wand to feel like it’s an extension of your hand, of you. That way the magic just flows. You need to make it as easy as possible for the magic to pass through.”
Draco groaned. Some of the Gryffindor eighth years had decided to organize a party in the Room of Requirement. It was supposed to be a secret, and so far, the teachers seemed none the wiser. He had no interest in going, but Pansy had been pestering him all week, and he knew he was going to give in. From the rumours circulating, there was supposed to be alcohol, music, and food nicked from the kitchens.
“They’re so tough on us this year,” said Pansy. “I’m exhausted and it’s not even the end of first term. Blaise, did you manage to find those ingredients Slughorn was looking for?”
Draco wasn’t sure whether it was a dream, or a memory, or perhaps some figment of his imagination, but in his mind’s eye he saw himself on his broomstick, soaring through the air. And there were Vincent and Greg, playing as Beaters…it was nice to see Vincent again, he thought…and there was Potter, shooting past him as he searched for the Snitch…and Draco decided to chase after him, because why not…wherever Potter went, good things happened…wherever Potter went, the Snitch would surely be there…and so he tailed him, but there was no animosity between them, no real competition…it was wonderful, up in the air, keeping an eye on Potter as he scouted for the Snitch…
Draco could barely swallow around the lump that had formed in his throat. The dull ache in his arm seemed to deepen. He didn’t want Harry’s sympathy—he didn’t want anyone’s sympathy.
“Malfoy,” Potter started. He stopped, hesitated, and then went on, “D’you ever…” He trailed off, staring at him in a way that Draco found extremely disconcerting.
“As you like. But I’m not going to let you off the hook so easily, you know. As I say, you have potential. You just need an outlet for all that anger. I’m asking you to stay at Hogwarts. Give yourself a chance.”
“But everything will have to change, then. I’ll have to owl Pansy and Blaise, and tell them not to send my presents here.”
motivated. Whenever Draco started to probe too far, honing in on a memory Potter absolutely did not want him to see, he was thrown out so violently that once or twice he stumbled backwards, gripping their kitchen table to remain upright. Most of their arguments revolved around Occlumency. Draco reminded him, again and again, that it wasn’t enough to just shut his attacker out completely. Occlumency was a subtle art and it required that memories be carefully curated, redirected, manipulated, and overwritten. To his own ears, he sounded very much like Severus. And, of course, all of this was lost on Potter.
Draco shook his head. Something buried deep within his mind told him not to accept, although he couldn’t say why. “I don’t want to draw attention to myself. I’ll wait for the holidays.”
Harry chewed at his bottom lip and wondered what it would be like to think things through before speaking. "It's your. I mean, you live next door to me," he said, forcing himself to stop fidgeting "So, you know there's thin walls and my bedroom is," Harry continued l, watching Malfoy's face go a bit more pale, "we share a wall, and sometimes," he cleared his throat, "I mean your clients aren't exactly quiet."
Pansy smiled, "Normal is where you marry the Weaslette and become an auror, Potter," she said smugly.
Astrid spoke up before Harry could respond. She had been watching the exchange closely. "Thank you for the offer. I would really love to get to know you, Uncle Harry, and your family. I'd also like to learn as much as I can before school starts, I don't want to be behind." She looked at Dudley, "Would that be ok with you Dad?"
“I agree. I can’t get through one conversation with Scorpius without hearing about Potter’s thoughts on the issue, or how Potter tells certain jokes with a better ending, or why Potter should be invited to the next charity ball at the manor.”
Romilda, Blaise, Pansy, Draco, Daphne and Milicent all took their shot immediately. The rest of the students watched them, hesitating. “Oh please,” Pansy said, “every person in this room has fantasized about at least one person here. Now take your shots or I’m going to pull out veritaserum and ask all of you a bunch of personal questions.”
Harry fumbled at the abrupt change of subject, "I- yes. You could say that," he said, feeling his lips curl up at the memory of a beetle in a jar. "I think she always will, actually."
"I um-" Potter said, "Molly Weasley had a whole stack of romance novels that I read right after the war."
Hermione glanced back at the woman sitting atop her desk and smiled, "I'm sure Pansy is delighted at your timing. Especially considering the topic."
Draco starts to undo Potter's denims, "Obviously you're under the influence of a lust potion. I'm using it to get control of you."
"Hey Malfoy. Do you want to grab dinner?" Harry asked. He was pleased to hear the greeting come out casually, just like he'd practiced.
Harry gave her a cheeky grin, "Only when Pansy here asks me to." He could feel Pansy turn a glare on him.
Harry didn't look back at him right away just continue to watch the stars above. "Gringotts," he said and turned his head to look at Draco.
Draco chuckled, “We should be getting dressed for the interview.” He backed up a few more steps tugging Harry with him until Draco’s back was against a door.
The man at the door frowned, then cocked his head, trying to see into the house. “Are you sure? It’s really important that I speak with him,” he said, fishing for something in his pocket. He pulled out a piece of paper and attempted to hand it over to Scorpius, who made no moves to take it. The man’s eyes narrowed ever so slightly, “He sent this to me,” he said, his tone becoming less friendly.
Loire looked at him for a moment and then softly smiled, "I hope not. Either way, your help is needed. The Headmistress put Miss Lovegood in charge of assigning so please follow her."
"I begged you to tie me to the headboard and fuck me into the mattress." Harry licks his lips, straining to respect Charlie’s relationship rather than dropping to his knees right here in the crowded back room of the Leaky Caldron.
"Yeah it's this ridiculous idea that," he thought for a moment seeming to choose his words, "It's like being really racist against everyone who's not the same as you. Which Draco isn't- he doesn't believe that anymore- but he was raised that way. He saw a lot of terrible things during the war, and it changed him."
Kreacher moved past the two of them and set their mugs on the little table. He then turned back to Harry, "Kreacher is making things more comfortable for Harry Potter to see the stars." He pointed up at the roof of the patio.
“I’ve got you booked so I’ll see you in two weeks.” Harry heard the sub say. His neighbor must not have been in the room because Harry wasn’t able to hear any replies, only this side of the conversation.
Everyone except Harry froze and then all of them toppled against him dragging him down to the floor as well. He felt the weight of two people lifted off of him and then he could see a fuzzy figure standing above him. “Thank you,” he croaked out.
Draco shrugged one shoulder, looking at the table. "It's warmer in there. How do you like our dorm?" he asked. It wasn't the smoothest change of subject but Blaise let it pass.
He didn't think about relationships or sex very often, actually. He was generally focused on his business and his spare time was spent with friends and family.
Pansy blushed. Pansy Parkinson blushed. Harry’s brows furrowed at the sight, and he tried to remember if he’d ever seen a Slytherin blush.
Scorpius cringed and sat up. He hadn't done anything wrong, but he was definitely wearing only boxers under all these blankets and pillows. He briefly considered what to do if Harry asked. He wouldn't lie outright, he'd tried that when he was younger and it never seemed to work. Distraction was best with Harry, he would do that if needed.
Draco takes the bottle of wine and grabs two glasses on his way to the drawing-room, and waits for Pansy. She comes in a moment later wearing a black silk nightie and green lace panties.
"What should we play first?" Zabini asked once the bottle was safely stored away from Hermione. "Any requests?”
Draco looked up, his hands running along Harry’s thighs under the water. “About time, Potter,” he said.
Neville, who had just taken a sip of pumpkin juice, started to choke and Harry pat his back sympathetically. He hated when he swallowed wrong.
"Stunt?" Blaise asked, feigning ignorance. He glanced up at the girls who were both watching them with rapt attention.
makes its way through, but it's drowned out by the heat coming off of Potter. Draco's body is all too familiar with the dirty grind of a hook-up, and Potter's got a lot to offer. He finds his hands responding without conscious permission, snaking up the sides of Potter's t-shirt to feel the heated skin on the pads of his fingertips.
“Oh come on,” Harry said, “I just threw on something easy. It’s not like I dress like this all the time. You’ve seen how I dress for business meetings, Hermione.”
Scorpius pulled away quickly, glaring at Draco in false annoyance and smoothing his hair back into place. "Malfoy's don't look a fright when there's company, Father," he drawled in perfect imitation of his grandfather.
He was not looking forward to a repeat performance. He could already feel his breath become shallow and a sweat break out as they reached the entrance to Diagon.
"Bloody hell," Ron said, scrubbing a hand over his face. "Is there something in the fucking water at this school? You two I get, Charlie called that in fourth year-"
"Well," Hermione said, "I think Harry is an adult and should make his own choices. I also think that Harry has been gone on Draco for years," she looked at Harry, who was starting to speak up to defend himself, "Don't bother arguing, Ron and I remember 6th year," then looked back to Pansy. "Besides, Draco came to see me a little over a year ago and we had a much needed chat. So yes, I'm ok with it."
"No!" Harry rushed to stand up and had to grip the high back of the chair as the patio stopped spinning. "I didn't mean anything by that. I'm just curious to know."
“I know that better than anyone,” Dean said, his eyes meeting Harry’s with a steady gaze. “I still have nightmares about that dungeon his family kept me in, but Malfoy isn’t his father. He tried to help me, and Luna, as much as he could.”
Dudley looked nothing short of a scolded child. His lips pressed together in a thin line. “No,” he said gently, then turned to Scorpius, “I’m sorry,” he said. “I lost my temper with you. I know it was your intention to get me to leave Harry alone, not to get a rise out of me. Harry told me that people come looking for him a lot and that you tend to be protective.” He glanced back at Harry, “It’s easy for me to forget how famous he is in this- in- here,” he finished awkwardly.
"So," Harry continued, "that night Draco planted portkeys -which are items that transport you to a different continent- at the dinner table. When his parents were whisked away to New Zealand he had the manor to himself for nearly 24hrs, before they would get their hands on a legal portkey to return home." Harry smiled so wide it nearly split his face, "Then he set fire to the whole place!"
"Oh, wow." The blonde's eyes go wide before he adds, "I was not expecting this." His eyes drop over Malfoy in a slow perusal, and he licks his lips before adding, "I mean, I'm down. Obviously."
Pansy dashed over to him, saying, "Draco, I need to-" she looked at Blaise and narrowed her eyes. "You evil rat! You've already told him, didn't you!?"
Harry tried not to worry about his thoughts getting through to Zabini, but thoughts about Draco were different.
Draco fights the urge to cancel the night and lick Harry dry. It must show because Harry closes the distance between them to trap Draco against the door of his walk-in closet with a hungry kiss.
On Tuesday Harry showed up 20 minutes late again, to avoid any other students, and had brought a wireless. The music helped pass the time and every once in a while he could hear Pansy humming along to a song.
By the time Harry made it back to his flat, it was just after 10 pm. Normally, the first thing he did when he walked in was snuggle Orion. The cat would greet him at the door looking like he had been waiting there since Harry started walking up the stairs, demanding to be picked up and showered with affection. This time, however, he was nowhere to be found. Harry called out for him searching under the furniture, in his bedroom, even the bathroom, but there was no Orion. Bewildered Harry opened the door to his flat and started inspecting the hallway.
Harry cursed under his breath and led the two of them to the kitchen to try and salvage his breakfast. He heard his two guests -intruders- sit down at the kitchen table while he got his plate together. Turning around he sat the plate on the table and sat down across from them. “Why are you here?”
Potter licks his lips and Draco can feel his cock get impossibly harder against Draco's thigh. "You're going to be on a date with the fresh scent of my cum on you then."
Harry tilted his head to the side and Draco started to bite his neck. "I want you to do it because you want me. I want you to want me with as much hunger as I want you. I want you to know it's not just a fuck."
Once he felt mostly composed, and was breathing air properly, he tried again. "Lucius," Harry said, offering his hand. Lucius was still taller than him, but no longer the towering figure Harry remembered during their first meeting. He pushed down his annoyance and anger towards the man and reminded himself that they needed to work together to keep Draco from getting expelled.
Both boys were smiling when they reached the kitchen to find Hermione, Ron, and Kreacher, all staring at them with wide concerned eyes. For the first time since they left Diagon Alley, Harry was happy that Pax had wanted to stay with Draco. Even with the bird, Draco tensed up.
“You know me. As long as it’s consenting adults, I don’t think it’s immoral. Gemini’s business plan is genius. It’s not like they use polyjuice." He shrugs, drinking down another swig from his bottle. "From what I understand they hire people who look somewhat similar, and cast any necessary glamors.”
His eyes flashed with amusement, “No. Someone set fires all throughout the place, in hopes of burning it down. But they didn’t take.” He looked at the manor again, saying, “This house has over three centuries of magic in it, I don’t think anything could take it down.”
Harry's shoulders slumped and he leaned against the doorway. "I think I just need someone to talk to," he said.
When Draco pulled back he looked the picture of debauched. Harry could hardly breathe, the boy was so fucking beautiful. He leaned forward to suck a love mark onto Draco's neck while he unbuttoned the boys trousers.
Potter pulls up a hand and rests it on Pansy’s shoulder. “Parkinson,” he says, his voice full of earnest entreaty, “I promise you, I’m not going to hurt him, and I will do my level best to be as Hufflepuff as possible while I’m in your flat. No looking through your things or making judgements, I’m just here to show some love.”
Pansy huffed a laugh, “You’re not cute Potter.” She sniffed, “I’m pretty sure what you’re actually doing is burning your fryup.”
Finally, Friday evening came. After dinner, she pulled on her ankle boots, said goodbye to Joanna, her mom, and hopped in the car, not even attempting to hide her excitement.
The smile left his face and he grimaced at her instead, feeling his already tight shoulders tense further at the word 'home.'
I really like this chapter! I hope you do too, please leave me some feedback in the comments! It makes a big difference.
“Ok, just so I fully understand,” Blaise said, his tone cautious, “are you upset because he was a death eater, or do you have a moral issue with his profession?”
"Who was your first kiss then?" Harry challenged, in an obvious attempt to remove himself as the current topic. "Pansy Parkinson? I know she couldn't keep her hands off you in school."
"It's probably better that I was late then," Harry said, following Draco's gaze to the desk. "I'm not great at showing restraint."
On Friday night when Harry went to his room to change and grab his cloak, the door was locked. He tried it again, it still wouldn't open.
"How are you adjusting to the Wizarding world, Astrid?" Harry asked, setting the tea mugs on the table and sitting in the chair across from her.
"Excellent choice," Zabini said. He gripped Harry's shoulder and said, "Though, Potter here will likely get drunk before most of us."
Draco returned with a smile before they were even directed to a table for dinner on the West side of the ballroom. Their table was set close to one of the winding staircases. Each of them looked for their name on the place cards and set their stuff down. The seating was well handled, going in a circle starting with Joana, then Dudley, Vernon, Petunia, Astrid, Scorpius, Draco, Harry, Teddy, and Andromeda.
Harry looked down at his faded Canons t-shirt, dark jeans, and red sneakers. When he looked back up Draco had already started through the entrance and down the street. Harry hurried to catch up with him. "Where did you learn the term grunge?"
Harry settled into bed enjoying the sounds of his new place. The creeks of the pipes, the soft sounds of a river nearby, and the low hum of music from the wireless he'd left on in the living room. Just after midnight, Harry found himself staring at the ceiling, trying to determine what had pulled him out of deep sleep. He was startled when his headboard moved, slamming against the wall.
“And your rooms?” She said, eyeing them with what looked like suspicion. “Are you intending to keep them?”
Draco leaned in to bite his earlobe, and said, "My new job isn't going to make having a relationship easy either. Don't you think you're moving a little fast with me?" then rolled his hips, pressing an impressive erection against Harry's thigh.
He twisted his body to stare at the wall, his head tilted, in much the same way as the cat next to him, curiously.
She looks nervous, and Draco is pretty confident that she must know what he’s going to say. Why else would she be acting so off? He decides to just get the words out and see what happens.
Harry read the letter with a frown on his face, "I see," he said, looking at his cousin, "and now you need my help?"
Harry stepped closer to him and said, "Sorry mate, didn't mean to change your view of physics. I can fix that too." He waved a hand casting Obliviate, and the man relaxed, sagging against the wall. Harry turned to Draco, "Anything you want to replace that memory with, or is it dealers choice?"
After a quick stop at his flat to change into muggle clothes, Draco met Potter at an apparition point near the burger place. Draco wore denims,
"Piss off Malfoy," Harry said in an angry whisper, "there's no reason for you to play the victim here. I'm the one who had to listen to the spankings and the handcuffs while you were getting off."
What did he want? He couldn't remember what he'd come in here for. Draco tried to get his brain to kick into gear, and finally managed to say, "Potter." No. Fuck, that wasn't right. It was, just- "I mean, I need to- Granger, I mean Hermione-" Draco cut himself off.
"No," Zabini said quickly, a wry smile on his lips, "I have no interest in Potter. Though, 'dark-hair Gryffindor' does seem to be my type."
Harry felt his eyes go wide, his heart stopped, then picked up at double-speed, pounding against his chest like the hooves of his patronus.
Wednesday evening he collected the needed groceries for Poulet Vallée D'auge. He wanted to make something really special to celebrate with Hermione, and Fluer had personally taught him how to make this dish.
However, it was clear that she wasn’t going to get very many answers until she was looking at references from the actual magic users, be it a book or a person. So, in the end, she decided to distract herself with friends and video games. Natalie, a friend she had since she was seven, was the only one she talked to about where she was headed for the weekend. Natalie's family had move to Italy last year, but the girls kept in contact through Skype and made time to game nearly every weekend.
When he asked Hermione about it earlier in the week she'd said primly, "He offered to assist me with a project."
Instead, Neville twisted his hand, interlacing their fingers together. "Seriously, are you all right? Your pupils are blown and your breathing is fast."
Harry heard her walk away and looked back down at Draco. Confused, he whispered the question, “What just happened?”
Outraged, Harry made to stand but stopped himself when he felt Draco's hand in his forearm. Instead, he leaned back in his seat and stared at the floor.
Okay, clearly Harry could see that Zabini was objectively good looking, but was he attracted to him?
“Think what?” Draco said through clenched teeth, cutting her off. “He’ll think ‘Draco Malfoy is up to something,’ is that what you were going to say?”
Potter grabbed hold of it before Draco could. Not that he was going to, he knew better than to take anything on offer to him from a Weasley.
The class paired off on the mats and began to duel. Harry watched them closely, noting the difference between his style and his classmates. He stopped to watch Neville and Ron, as Ron hit Neville with a bat bogey hex. Neville tried to block and counter at the same time and ended up taking the hex on his right thigh.
Harry shifted against the wall, using his hands to brace himself as he arched his back and pushed against Draco cock, taking Draco deep inside him. They both groaned Draco kept a hand on Harry’s cock, the other hand gripped his hip hard enough to leave the mark of fingerprint bruises. Draco watched the slick slide of his cock thrusting in and out of Harry.
Harry stood immediately, he'd finally figured out that she meant to duel him when she said the word 'monologue' and he was pleased. He hadn't been allowed to participate until today, and he was eager to fight someone with skill.
Draco let the tips of his fingers slip into the custom trousers he wore and started to take casual steps towards Harry. "I've already received several lectures from Pansy about why you're a bad idea," he said. He was close now, close enough to touch easily.
Ron looked disgusted by the idea. "What?" he asked after swallowing his food. "Why the hell would I do that?"
hitting on you," Potter says, fierce and possessive. Draco feels a thrill go through him at the words. He likes that Potter desires him enough to be jealous.
Draco’s voice, huskier than it had been before, was steady when he replied, “Not right now, thank you.”
"As a date for the gala," Harry replied, weakly vying for the upper hand or any hand, really. As he seemed to have lost his in a matter of seconds.
In the kitchen, the table was set with two glasses of red wine already poured. On the edge of the table were Harry and Darco’s chosen dishes, set under a stasis charm. Harry pulled out a chair, motioning for Draco to sit, and handed over his plate of Tikka Masala. Once seated, Harry pulled the list from his pocket, setting it on the table between them, and tucked into his own plate of Chicken Curry.
Both boys turned expectant eyes on him, waiting for the end of his sentence. When nothing came Draco said, "He's my boyfriend."
"It's not like that. He said I should come by if I had time. Which I do not. I need to finish this assignment."
Astrid noticed her eyes were getting a touch blurry and pulled the book a little closer. She was laying on her stomach in bed reading through
Really, it was his mother's fault that everything changed. During the last three months of the war Narcissa had reconnected with her sister Andromeda. Consequently, Draco had started receiving mail from Andromeda and Teddy Lupin. It had taken no time at all for Draco to bond with Andromeda, who understood the heartbreak of loving a family that has hurt you. He found himself writing her twice a week just like he did for his own mother.
Hermione’s eyes snapped up, sparking with revelation, and Draco’s blood ran cold. He recognized that look, it was the look she gave when someone showed up with a difficult problem and needed her help to do the research. It meant that she found something interesting, challenging, exciting
"I'm sure I'll see her tonight. I will talk to her and get it taken care of," he said. "I'm leaving in a few minutes."
"Oh Potter," Draco said from behind Harry, "you should have told me you had plans. I would have left after our first round of drinks."
"I'm going to assume you know better than to trust a well timed photograph." Harry didn't need to ask about Scorpius' mum, he'd heard enough from Albus to know the marriage had been a pureblood fulfillment. Astoria Malfoy, who had kept the name, lived in France. She only saw Scorpius for two weeks a year.
