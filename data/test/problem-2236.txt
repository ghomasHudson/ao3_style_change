Harry hasn't taken his eyes off Malfoy, and neither has the other man. The remains of an amused smile lingers on Malfoy's lips, although his eyes are serious. Snapshots of memories zip through Harry's mind like quicksilver: of their practise duels in the Academy, their fights during the War, and lastly, standing in the Great Hall with their wands raised like this in front of a crowd bristling with excitement, when they were twelve, with Lockhart behind him and Snape behind Malfoy.
Lothair rolled his eyes at the question. "This castle isn't simple magic. There are centuries of magic layered on top of each other and it's not just human magic. In order to change the structure of this place, you're going to have to tap into the core of the magic. Rearranging an entire area at the base of the castle isn't as easy as changing the paint colour."
"Are you going to get on with it or not?" came Lothair's drawl.
"You don't have to cast any magic. The magic that's linked to this place will do the recreation," Gwynn commented from behind him. "You said this "room of requirements" restructures to whatever you need, right? It's sort of the same thing."
On one hand, Soren did want the situation to spiral out of control. On the other, Harry's bond with Draco was demanding retribution. Harry was going to need to feel like he had some control over the blond's protection or things would spiral out of control in an entirely different direction. Then there was Soren's interest in seeing how Harry would handle the situation if left to his own devices. They couldn't keep making decisions for him. Perhaps a trial of sorts was necessary to determine which direction to take when it came to Harry's instruction.
Lothair just waved off the order. "No need, I will not be staying there."
"Harry," the voice was hesitant, unsure whether or not to risk breaking whatever inner dilemma he might be having, "You're bleeding."
Again, Harry found his attention returning to Kolvar. "The Realm needs a Prince who can be solely devoted to it's well being. Until I have finished my business with the Wizarding World, I can't do that. It shall have to be temporarily put on hold."
The moment Harry had slipped from the room, the remainder of Soren's anger vanished with an aggravated sigh. He had spent many moons helping those who, like Harry, had found themselves unexpectedly thrust into an unknown world and he had never before lost his temper. Things were not working out as smoothly as he had initially hoped. While the majority of their time was spent on preparing Harry for his role as Dark Prince, the Kingdom around them was crumbling. Roland had yet to make a move and his presence at the borders was making the entire realm nervous. They were currently playing with fire and the entire castle seemed to understand that. Their Prince was unprepared and discontent threatened to destroy everything they were working so hard to protect.
This time it looked like Lothair was trying to restrain himself. Harry highly doubted anyone had spoken to the Elf like that in years, if ever. As it stood, Lothair was still one of three holding reign over the Kingdom and, as such, deserved respect, but Harry just couldn't find it in himself to offer him any. He realized he shouldn't have run off, but they'd barely gotten there in time. Hell, he wasn't even sure if he had gotten there in time. Rosalind and Soren had taken Draco into the other room and had not come out since. He had no idea if the blond was alive or dead. It was a horrible feeling not knowing. He felt like he was balanced precariously on the edge of a knife, just waiting for a strong wind to push him over.
"It won't last long," Akkar urged, "We need to move him. Now."
"What? We got breakfast, didn't we?"
' was the only thing Gwynn thought as everything seemed to click into place. "I'm assuming the ritual went as expected?" she asked, curiously. There was a million questions she wanted to ask, but in the face of the ones Harry had presented to her, she held her tongue. His unimpressed look told her that he wouldn't be legitimizing her question with an answer. "I suppose so. There's no laws against such a thing. "
"He'll be fine," she nodded, sitting back, "but he's going to have one hell of a headache when he wakes up."
As Harry studied the sword in his hand, Daemeon moved around Harry with watchful eyes as the younger Elf got a feel for the weapon. His eyes followed the sweeping motions as Harry tested it.
Lifting a hand, he traced a circle in the air, the air shimmered for a moment and symbols began to appear around the edge. "Lightening feeds into Water. Water feeds into Ice. Ice feeds into Wind. Wind feeds into Fire. Fire feeds into Wood. Wood feeds into Earth. Earth feeds into Lightening." As he spoke, each symbol flashed as he spoke of it. "Which indicates both its strengths and it's weaknesses. Lightening is strong against water, but weak against Earth. Fire is strong against Wood but weak against Wind. That is not, however, to say that an element has only one weakness. Water will always be a danger to water as lightning is to Wood. Understand?"
"You've been filling this room with some sort of energy for the past half an hour! I could barely fucking breath beneath the weight of it. Then all of a sudden it's gone and no one's the wiser?" Draco responded, raising an eyebrow. "And don't think I missed the sudden approval from that prat Ehlark, either. What did you do?"
"He's the decoy." The words left a terrible taste in his mouth and the raising of Lothair's eyebrow told him that they sounded as terrible as it had felt to say them. "He can't know."
"I want you to think your decision through carefully before you announce it and weigh the consequences," was all that Soren responded with as they reached a heavy set of French doors. Not giving Harry much time by way of a retort, he pulled open the doors and stepped through, allowing the younger man to follow in his wake.
"I know, love."
Draco raised an eyebrow but didn't comment since Pansy was already cutting in. "He's kind of busy right now, can't you see?"
Ilaria laughed, the sound freer than he'd yet heard it. It was clear that the two had known each other for a long time. Their banter was easy in a way that came from years of practice.
going on, Soren?" she asked, her body language stating that she would follow even if he didn't answer her question. Her sense of duty wouldn't allow for anything else. It was her job to maintain peace within the realm and if that meant dealing with a bunch of surly Werewolves than that's what she was going to do. The Kingdom could not afford to divide it's troops between an attack from Roland and an attack from the Werewolf would be a disaster if that's what it came down to, not to mention the fact that Lothair had always had enough of an attitude to deal with. They'd never get anywhere if she allowed her temper and annoyance to rise to the level his always seemed to.
Surprise spread quickly among the group, but Harry let out a breath of relief. "Remus. It has to be."
Before he could go after Harry, a hand moved to settle on his shoulder. Glancing back, he found Ilaria standing there. Her eyes met his briefly before they shifted to Gwynn and she nodded. The girl, who had been shifting her weight from foot to foot nervously, didn't wait for another invitation and hurried after Harry, which had Draco instantly seething. It was a miracle the Lady of the South couldn't feel the heat radiating out from him.
Depending on what those conditions were, they could be a heavy price to have to pay.
Draco hadn't been expecting to be called to any meetings. In fact, he'd expected to be left alone or tossed into some cell after beating the snot out of their
I do not own Harry Potter or anything related to the Harry Potter verse. The creation of this story was created solely for my own entertainment. No copyright infringements were intended and no monetary gain has been made.
Harry nearly jumped out of his skin at the weight of Soren's hand settling on his shoulder. Returning his slightly widened eyes toward the Elder, he found an understanding smile on the face of the other elf. "To every good there is a negative. That is what balances the world around us," he responded, giving Harry's shoulder a reassuring squeeze before releasing him. "It's the weight that goes with every significant decision we make. What you have to decide, Harry, is whether or not the good outweighs the bad. Perhaps he will respond negatively to what we've done, but is that enough to change your mind? Is that enough to make you decide that he is better off left to his fate?"
Lothair would be absolutely BEYOND furious.
The ride back to the Manor had been tense and silent. None of the High Lords had bothered to address him about what he'd been thinking when he had agreed to return to Hogwarts. Draco knew that they had heard his hushed conversation with Severus and, yet, they hadn't asked about that or what he'd been trying to accomplish. It didn't sit well with him. Draco wasn't naive enough to think that they weren't well aware of what going back was going to mean. If the dirty looks Lothair kept shooting him were any indication, he knew the Elf was showing some hard earned restraint.
"A pleasure as always," she commented, her tone somewhat dry as she stared at the slightly open door.
Severus barely contained the sneer from forming on his features as a wave of bitter annoyance slammed through him. "I'm alive, if that's what you mean," he snapped, easing his sore body into one of the chairs in front of the old man's desk. He could not, however, help the narrowed eyes as he met Albus' gaze. He hated that damn twinkle above all else. "The boy's gone."
"The usual account?"
Continuing down the corridor, his ears perked at the sound of life that was steadily growing louder. Harry's curiosity was peaked the moment the sound reached his ears. Having been born and raised outside of this world, he was immensely curious of those living within it. Soren, Lothair, and Ilaria were all very different from each other and although he did, for the most part, like them, Harry was still interested in finding someone who might be a little … younger. As he drew closer to the sounds of life, a gentle breeze flowed gracefully down the empty corridor to wrap itself around him, bringing with it the scents of sand and pine needles.
"Yes, my Lady. We're certain."
Harry supposed he could see what she was getting at. In his defense, however, he didn't think of this place as a bathing room. To him it was more of a swimming pool. He'd just assumed that if he couldn't share it with the family he was suppose to have, he could share it with his friends...or at least the one he currently had. "No offence, Gwynn, but you're definitely not my type," he offered, an amused smile flickering across his face at that.
With a final glare at the three wolves, Harry turned and made his way to where Erebus was waiting for him, Draco still held protectively in his arms. Placing Draco up on Erebus' back first, Harry swung up afterwards. After making sure his hold on Draco wouldn't allow him to fall, Harry turned Erebus around and immediately headed back toward the manor. Soren had stated the stabilization spells wouldn't last forever and Harry wasn't taking his chances.
Feeling Soren's gaze, Lothair returned to his attention in order to offer his own suggestion. "At the current moment, they're not moving inward, merely testing the borders. If we alert the outposts as Ilaria stated, we can keep a closer eye on them. From that vantage point it would be easier to gauge their actions and determine when he appropriate time would be to initiate any protective measures needed."
He was positive that the old man was up planning something big, but no matter how much he thought about it, he simply couldn't put the pieces together. Albus had never been interested in the plight of Draco Malfoy, at least not until recently. It was this interest that had tipped Severus off. Normally, the Headmaster was focused solely on that Potter brat, but since the boy had escaped the hold Dumbledore had on him, Albus had redoubled his efforts to bring Draco within the protection of Hogwarts. The man seemed to have a rather intense interest in keeping one or the other under his control and Severus was missing the part of the equation that balanced it.
Harry stiffened at the familiar voice. Spinning around, his eyes scanned the shadows, catching a brief flash of silver hair as Draco shifted. He had to fight the urge to shift nervously as he met Draco's angry stare and it was then that Harry realized that Draco knew. He knew about the bond.
"I'm not late," he stupidly argued, "I've still got-"
Lothair, it seemed, had the same idea a moment earlier because he got there before Draco did, immediately scanning the smaller Elf for any signs of injury. After a moment, he stood back up and shook his head. "And that's what happens when you build up too much elemental magic and release it too quickly."
Soren remained silent for several moments just watching him. This wasn't what happened to most Elves when they came into their heritage and he felt sorry that Harry had to experience it this way. It really was a beautiful thing when given the time to grow. "Why do you think you were able to sense him when he was in danger, Harry?" Inside himself, Harry knew what it meant. He might not be putting the pieces together just yet, but he would. "There is a bond between the two of you. That is why it has to be your blood. He's not going to respond anyone else."
He could hear them in the kitchen and he made a beeline for them, throwing the door open and glancing around until his eyes fell on the culprit. "You!"
"The kitchen would be a good start." Frankly, Draco could do with a cup of coffee. Despite having been in the Manor for several days now and the influence of his now Elven heritage, he still hadn't quite adjusted to the schedules. His body wanted to be sleeping and it wasn't exactly enthusiastic about being up and about at this time. Coffee would be a good start to staying on his feet.
can feel good about!" he snapped, back his tone mocking as his fingers tightened around the strand of hair still caught in his hands. The more he let his anger with the brunette take hold, the more a weight began to settle on his chest. It had been minimal moments before, but it was starting to garner his notice.
The almost instant chorus of disapproval and downright refusal on both Draco and Lothair's parts had Harry rolling his eyes. "I'm not a helpless child!" he snapped, "Don't think for a second they're going to back off if I'm not there. It'll only look suspicious and they'll only press all the more."
Ignoring the warning, Harry stood and headed for the door. Behind him Hermione sighed and he could hear the scrapping of chairs against the floor as she and Ron stood to follow him. He wasn't concerned about whether or not they followed. He was just as content if they did as he was if they didn't.
Ilaria nodded, the conversation continuing around him with an easy flow. "You'd see me more often if you'd just pack up and move to the south with me."
Rolling her eyes, Gwynn reached out and slapped him upside the back of the head. "You idiot. Do you even know what this means?"
With that final show of power, it seemed that their battle was over. Ilaria was grinning, giddy from the brief sparring match, which made Harry wonder what she was like on a real battlefield. There was a cold sense of warning that moved over his skin and he found himself convinced that he didn't want to see it himself. Somehow, he thought she'd be the most terrifying of all of them.
"Guys..."
Dumbledore nodded, "You'll be provided with a suitable room in the Professor's wing," he started, indicating Harry and Draco, "and the boys will return to their dorms."
Harry didn't comment again. There was no point. Lothair was clearly annoyed and he wasn't going to get a straight answer out of him, so he filed away any further questions for later.
His eyes skimmed over Draco briefly before they moved to take in the five new and unfamiliar Elves sitting in the room. He'd never met any of them before but Soren had given him a brief rundown of the basics.
Dressing in a pair of light tan trousers, dark brown boots, and a deep blue tunic, Draco quietly left his room. There was an undercurrent of energy rolling beneath his skin and sitting in his room till the rest of the castle had stirred was not something that he was interested in doing. Of course, this left him with a small dilemma. Where was it that he was going to go? He recalled where the library was, but that would do nothing for all the pent up tension the dream had created within him. He could go and have breakfast, of course, but he had yet to figure out where the kitchens were. Honestly, he hadn't figured out where a lot of things were. Since his arrival, most of his time had been spent between the infirmary, the library, and his own rooms.
"The two of you will now be training together. You've gained enough skill and muscle strength not to be a liability to the other," Ilaria continued, "there is no point in continuing your individual training regimes. In battle, you will be fighting with others if you are not fighting together. Very rarely will you find yourself battling alone."
Draco didn't feel all that interested in heading inside. Once they arrived, he would have to listen to their complaints and face the repercussions. After that ride back, he just didn't want to deal with it. Before he could change his mind, the doors of the Manor's front entrance were already closing behind them. He vaguely noted that the entrance hall appeared darker than he remembered it and he smiled wryly to himself. Even the Manor was responding to the growing storm.
Still nothing.
This time Harry couldn't quite keep the snort at bay. "Um, I've been attacked by a Basilisk, Voldemort' soul, Aracnomantula, Dementors, a Dragon, and-" shooting Draco an annoyed look, "-enthusiastic Voldemort supporters during my time here."
"There's a library over here!" Gwynn called from the other side of the hall.
Lothair snorted and helped him up. "She was just saying hello," he commented, pushing him back toward the state. "Try again."
"I bet," Draco drawled mockingly, leaning back in the chair he'd claimed, legs stretched out in front of him and crossed at the ankles. He looked like the perfect image of nonchalance, but Harry knew he was watching Dumbledore closely. Draco was already suspicious of him without any information Harry might have on the man
They'd gone over basic glamours in their training with Soren but they hadn't tried to do anything as detailed as a complete glamour. They'd changed the colour of their eyes or hair, but nothing as extensive as what they were currently expected to do. Closing his eyes, Harry focused on the image he wanted to create. Searching his mind, he brought up an image from before he'd started to change. He held the image for a moment, studying it. He was shorter, his hair was its usual mess, his glasses sat crookedly on his nose and his clothing had returned to the worn-out jeans and t-shirt he'd favoured.
Soren did not wait for further permission; enough time had already slipped by. The window of opportunity was almost gone. Kneeling beside Draco's body, Soren let his eyes slipped closed, a single hand hovering over Draco's chest. For several long seconds he remained this way, causing Harry already nervous posture to tense. He was just about to comment on Soren's lack of movement when his eyes opened again, only rather then the dark, alert pupils he was used to seeing, Soren's eyes where clouded. The milky substance that had covered his eyes barely allowed for their true colour to be seen. Soren's hand stilled just above Draco's heart and for the briefest moment, Harry could have sworn the tips of his long finger's had started to glow.
"Christ, is that what you're pissy about? Because I didn't ask for bloody permission first?" Draco snapped, irritated with where this conversation is going. "I saw an opportunity. I took it."
Pushing that thought from his mind, he took another step forward. Despite the cool night air, his skin was clammy and extremely warm. The blood trickling slowly down his chest felt like it was scorching its way over his skin. His strength was waning, making each step more difficult then the last. His entire body screamed at him to just lay down, but Draco struggled against the temptation. If he stopped now, he wasn't entirely sure he'd have the strength to get back up. He didn't want to die alone in some unknown forest, of that he was absolutely sure. He wanted his chance to face his Father again. He wanted to tell him exactly what he thought. He wanted to actually stand up to the man as an individual, not his puppet.
"It should have started yesterday."
There was only one bed being occupied in the room and the splash of blond against the white pillow told him exactly who it was. Draco was laying on his stomach, the wounds on his back covered with bandages. Harry released a breath when he spotted the movement of the Draco's back, corresponding with each breath he took. His relief wasn't what he had hoped it would be. Some of the bandages had tinges of red colouring where the blood had seeped through. Draco wasn't out of the woods just yet and he didn't need Rosalind to tell him as much. His wounds had been pretty bad and it wasn't at all surprising that he was still unconscious. A part of him had hoped otherwise, but that had clearly just been wishful thinking. If Draco woke any time soon, it would be a bloody miracle.
"Harry!"
"You can't be-" Harry scrambled for an argument. He was right. It'd never come up that Draco was an Elf. All they knew was that they'd somehow saved him from being tortured by Lucius. That was it. "Well, you need to quit."
Snape nodded.
It'd be just his luck to have bonded himself to Malfoy as a submissive.
"You don't think the wounds will heal, do you?" he asked, looking away from her and back to the prone form on the bed. Could that be the truth? Was Draco going to die after all, despite their efforts? Was he going to have to stand there and let it happen?
"Now that isn't something I can do much about," she smiled, finishing up. "Perhaps you should try wooing him?"
If nothing else, Soren was glad to see the sullen and gloomy look finally leave Harry's face ... even if his anger was only a frustrating complication to the situation. "True, however," he countered, "we were all unaware of your connection to Draco until after the fact and, despite any dislike you have for the situation, the wolves are allowed to hunt any creature who enters the realm without permission, humans included."
"It is of utmost urgency," Lothair insisted, a hard edge back in his voice and a meaningful look in his blue eyes. Whatever it was, Harry had the distinct impression that he was not to be included in the matter. He could tell by how hard Lothair was trying to get his point across without actually divulging what the situation was.
"There is another way to save him, Harry, but it is not easy and will come with lasting repercussions."
Slipping out into the empty corridor, he glanced toward the door where he knew Gabriel slept. For a moment he debated waking the wolf up. It wouldn't hurt to ask about the dreams. After another moment of consideration, he turned away. It was unlikely that it stemmed from the Lyncanthropy and he really didn't want to answer any more questions about what was going on between him and Harry. The wolf was far too observant for his own good.
"I hope you've been able to consider the situation thoroughly," he said, glancing toward the shorter elf, "As I've said the presence of the pack is a beneficial situation for both them and ourselves. They are a key element of our defensive structure."
The sound of another approaching signaled the end of their conversation as they both glanced in the direction it was coming from. Gwynn approached from the left. "We're getting ready to head out," she commented, her eyes glancing briefly between them.
Draco hissed, not appreciating the comment. Unlike Harry, he wasn't an idiot. He knew damn well who Caligula was and he certainly didn't appreciate being compared to the craziest emperor of all time. Not even the fact that she'd put him in the same class as an emperor could sooth his already ruffled feathers. "I said I'd return to school. I didn't declare war on Poseidon."
Ignoring him, Ilaria smiled brightly, making a few motions with her hands and materialized two long wooden boxes. Both smooth and polished. "First, presents!" The first box was shorter than the other and a green so dark it was almost black and wrapped with a golden bow. The second was a blue so soft it bordered on white, a navy blue bow on it. With another motion of her hand, she sent each box to its respective owner; the green to Harry and the blue to Draco.
Draco glowered at him. "It'd be sneaking if you hadn't practically invited people in with all the unlocked doors. Furthermore, it's not the middle of the night. It's morning. Therefore, I'm obviously here to get your lazy arse out of bed, so get up!"
Whether he be Muggle, Wizard, or Elf, Harry's ears perked at the thought of food. It really was amazing how quickly he could let go of what troubled him in the face of a decent meal. It was part of the reason he was always so excited to be at The Burrow. Molly Weasley was the best bloody cook he knew, but these Elves weren't half bad either. "Do you think they could make me some treacle tart?" he asked hopefully, hoping down himself and following along after her.
There was silence around the room as Harry's eyes moved to each of them. Faelyn's thoughts were churning behind her eyes but he couldn't tell in which direction they would make her lead. There was no expression on Oriss face for Harry to judge if he had even been listening. Aranel looked like he wanted to argue the point further but was refraining himself from doing so and Ehlark kept shooting curious looks to Aranel, which had Harry fighting back a low growl of annoyance.
His explanation was cut short by the sudden force of Draco's fist slamming into his face. Harry had barely seen him move. It had been nothing but a blur and an explosion of pain. The force of the punch had forced Harry to stumble back in surprise, vaguely aware of the surprised gasp from Gwen.
Ilaria shrugged, unconcerned with Harry's slight embarrassment. "Consider it a very practical coronation gift."
"Come on," she urged, reaching for his arm to haul him back up into a standing position, "You just need to stretch your legs a bit."
Draco blinked through the haze of irritation that he'd allowed to settle over him and glanced toward the wolf now currently walking through the halls of the Manor with him, a bright spot next to Draco's storm of irritation. Right. He was supposed to be showing their newest resident around, which was comical since he'd been having Potter do the same for him no less than an hour before. "I beat the bloody hell out of Potter the other day, though I can't tell if that's something new or something I just finally allowed myself to do," he commented dryly, which earned a laugh from the man beside him.
Harry flipped him off, but Draco had already glanced away, his eyes closing as he worked on his own glamour. After a moment the air around him seemed to shudder and then Harry was looking at the full extent of Draco's glamour.
Harry could barely compute the thought. "You clearly need to get out more often," he finally responded, shaking his head sadly. Even Hermione took a break from her books once in a blue moon.
Harry seemed to come to the same conclusion if the sigh and slumping of his shoulders was anything to go by. "I want to," he muttered, drawing the short dagger he kept on the side of his boots and proceeding to scratch out a small hole in the mortar of the wall, "It's irritating being the only one who doesn't know what 's going on. Even bloody Malfoy knows more about this place than I do." That statement was punctuated with a slightly more viscous stab of the dagger.
"Oh, that's beautiful," Ilaria breathed peering around him at the sword in the box. "Long sword. 50 inches. Steel alloy with a magical core and sharpened to perfection. Meant for someone with a long reach, not to mention the physical strength and stamina to swing it. Pick it up!"
"We're going," he snapped, heading immediately for the door.
he hissed, "I thought you were a student!"
Behind him, Gwynn snorted.
"Harry," he returned, reaching forward to grip the man's forearm as his was gripped in return, his eyes lingering on the winding lines of tattoos that spiralled up the man's forearm from his wrist and the scars that dotted his skin. The latter had Harry wondering if they were earned in battle or courtesy of his work, but he didn't ask.
"Harry's coming back!"
When Harry moved next it was to unfurl himself from the cross-legged position he'd been sitting in. Standing, he dropped down from the pillar. "
Harry's eyes flickered to Draco's. He had a feeling he knew who they Alpha was referring to and by the look in Draco's eye he knew as well.
"Then why-"
Without a sword, Gwynn was at a serious disadvantage. It was a disadvantage that Ilaria continually warned against. It was a disadvantage that left Gwynn with but one option: handicapping the opposition. Before Harry could understand what was happening, Gwynn shifted into what could almost be considered a crouch, her muscles tensing before she stepped into a forward movement, the heel of her palms connecting forcefully with the center of Harry's chest, forcing the breath from within him and sending him backwards. When his back hit the floor it was with a now very familiar sounding thud that left him struggling to regain the use of his lungs.
"Beautiful."
Shaking the thought away, he moved to the pool and quickly splashed some water onto his face. He hadn't bothered to warm it up, needing the cool quality of it to wake his senses and hopefully push his dreams far from his thoughts. It seemed to help after a minute, a light shiver moving through him as some of the cool water splashed against his chest. Standing again, he reached for one of the towels lining the shelf and dried himself off. Hanging it up, he returned to the room to dress. He hadn't attended to his own wardrobe, most of the items having simply shown up in his closest with no clue as to where they'd come from. Much to his surprise, they all seemed perfectly tailored to him so he didn't bother to complain. He had no belongings and no means to acquire more, so if they were going to supply him with what he needed than he was going to accept it. It helped that all of the clothing he'd found was of high quality. He'd have walked around naked before wearing some of the garbage he'd seen Potter wearing over the years. He might not have a title or wealth anymore, but he still had more pride than that.
Harry didn't need to see Dumbledore's eyes shift to Draco to know exactly what he was referring to. If that was truly the case, it provided them with a little more time to make arrangements, but if it wasn't ... Dumbledore knew more than what he was telling them. The fact that he seemed to know anything about Draco's removal from Malfoy Manor was telling enough.
At the question, Harry stiffened again, glancing to Ilaria to see how she was going to introduce him. Was he supposed to be introducing himself to the general public. How much did they currently know about what was going on? Those questions, however, were rendered irrelevant as Ilaria only shrugged and responded with "A sheepish Prince in need of a real weapon," earning herself a glare.
"Oh for the love of Merlin, Ron, they never said when they would be arriving. They only said that they would be," she hissed at him. "What am I supposed to do? You're already sitting here whining about it. No point in us both doing so!"
The first thing Harry noticed when he entered the room was the smell. He'd been in St. Mungo's and even a few of the Muggle hospitals in London but had never really noticed the scent. Of course, he'd never been in those places with the increased senses he now possessed and he found himself very glad for that. They would have smelled a lot worse. The door he'd entered had clearly been an entrance into the Manor's hospital wing, something he hadn't even realized they had. The room itself looked like the physical manifestation of sterile. Everything seemed to be a shinning white with flashes of stainless steel intermixed. The smell, however, wasn't as pleasing to the senses as the sight. He could smell the sterile cleaner and varying antiseptics. He honestly didn't know how Rosalind handled it on such a continued basis. Perhaps after years of smelling it, he too wouldn't notice. If past experience was anything to go by, he was sure to be spending a lot of time in this room.
Lucius' words were starting to blend together, his vision going in and out. Draco hoped desperately that he'd be allowed to fall into unconsciousness, but he's seen his father torture an individual before. There was absolutely no chance he was going to allow it and a broken jaw was going to be the least of Draco's worries. When he didn't respond, Lucius reached forward and firmly gripped his son's jaw and abruptly turned Draco's head to face him. The pain caused by the pressure was excruciating, tearing from him an agonized cry that only seemed to please Lucius all the more.
"Excuse me?"
It was simple. Harry would return even if all three of the High Lords pressed for him to remain in the Elven realm. The boy would return because everything he had grown fond of he had found within Hogwarts and the world of Wizards: his family, his friends, and, most importantly, his responsibility.
Finally, Harry managed to get them both out of the main current where the pull was the strongest. Once he was able to keep his feet locked on the bottom of the riverbed, Harry released the tree branch and returned his free hand to Draco, dragging him out of the water and up onto the grass. Even with his soaking hair hanging in his face, Harry knew that Draco looked bad. There was blood still leaking from several of his wounds, his clothing was torn, and his skin was a deathly blue colour. Most significantly, Harry couldn't deny the sinking realization that Draco wasn't breathing.
The fact that she hadn't already tried to sneak a peak was rather impressive, Draco thought. She didn't exactly come across as a patient individual. To his left, Potter held both hands out so his own box could settle on his palms. Turning his attention back to the box hovering in front of him, Draco reached out for it. He'd almost forgotten about the brief trip he'd taken to the swordsmith. It had barely lasted a full five minutes. Daemon had taken a good look at him and proclaimed he already knew what Draco had needed. Hell, he hadn't even picked up a sword. He'd pointed that out to Ilaria when they had left, but she'd only told him to trust the master. He supposed now they would see whether or not that trust had been ill-placed.
"Not necessarily," Rosalind laughed, seeing the concern in Harry's eyes. "It doesn't mean we're replacing you with Draco. Ultimately the two of you will act as one. When it comes to ruling the realm, it doesn't matter which one of you are the dominant."
For the first time in two days, Harry showed an emotion other than indifference. "Wait," he frowned, "I'm not going to have to wait for another century, right?"
"Where are they located?"
"Every individual, whether they are Wizard or Elf, hold a deep connection with their ancestral home. In the Wizarding world the Potter line has another ancestral home, but it is merely for those who are not privileged enough to experience the full strength of their heritage. Only a select few, yourself included, have felt the connection with Jade Manor and, because of this connection, she is welcoming you home. It has been many years since she has felt the presence of one of her own."
The sound of tearing fabric had grey eyes snapping back up to watch as the familiar form at the end of the bed used a ripped off piece of Draco's sheet to try and catch some of the blood still stemming from his nose. The voice was familiar, though slightly smoother than Draco remembered. After six years of bitter rivalry, Draco couldn't mistake that voice for anyone. "Potter?" he asked, his voice slightly worried and more than a little incredulous. The last time he'd seen Dumbledore's Golden Boy, he'd been some short, scrawny,bespectacled git. He hesitated for a moment, unsure if he'd been wrong. Perhaps he'd imagined the familiar quality of the voice. This couldn't be Potter.
"I could," he commented, letting his eyes sweep the room before he moved to the next one. "But this will do."
"And my Father?"
"Shhh," Harry hissed, making a motion with his hands for Ron to calm down. Regardless of what Lothair insisted upon, Harry didn't really want to share his Elf status with the general populace. He had more notoriety in this world than he really cared to have and if he could, he'd happily take the regular level of nosy onlookers. "Can we talk about it later?"
The sudden stop of the wolf beside him had Draco's limited attention focusing on him, a raised eyebrow and an impatient look shot his way.
Sighing, he dug his textbook out of his bag and opened it to the page indicated on the board at the front of the classroom, while Snape went on about what they were expected to do. Harry's attention wasn't really on what he was saying, despite the fact that he could probably have used every bit of help offered to him. Potions were not his strong suit. The only reason he'd signed up for it last year was that he'd needed it to get into the Auror program. He was pretty sure he wasn't going to be going into that anymore.
"Fine," Ron muttered, some of the colour draining from his face at the mention of Voldemort's name. "What about his Dad? Someone would have known about him!"
"Potter!" Draco scrambled up, leaving his sword where it lay and headed for the brunette.
"What in the hell was that about?" Harry demanded, fuming as he walked along behind Draco. Don't get him wrong, things between Gwen and Draco were cold at best, mostly on Draco's part, but there hadn't even been any lead up to his outburst. All he'd done was offer her some of the extra food he'd gotten from Sheedra. It was hardly anything. What was worse was now Draco didn't seem to be showing any anger at all. He just looked bored. He didn't even bother answering Harry's question. "You know, you're enough to give a bloke whiplash!"
The sudden surprise, laced with a hint of fear, that sparked in Potter's eyes when he noticed Draco's presence sent a flash of approval through the blonde. The approval mixed with a flash of guilt at the sight of the still rather prominent bruising on his face. Any emotion he'd been showing quickly turned into a scowl when he realized he was actually feeling guilty. The prat had deserved it. He shouldn't be feeling sorry.
"Then I'm afraid you will have nowhere to stay as this is a school and we are not equipped to offer you a palace of your choosing."
"Potter," he called, frowning at the somewhat childish image the other man created. When he didn't get an answer, he called again, but this time louder, "Potter!"
That was her name.
Harry's interest was immediately caught. Could they be referring to the same Elves that Harry and the others had run into on their journey? Was Roland already so close? Harry could feel his skin begin to crawl beneath the light material of his clothes and his eyes darted to the shadows not trusting them to keep out those that would cause him harm. Shaking off what he could, Harry stepped forward out of the shadows and into the courtyard. The sun had already disappeared behind the walls of the castle and the crystal lanterns cast long shadows across the smooth stones.
"What the hell was that?"
"A glamour to make you blend in. Those in power here may already know that you are an Elf but the majority of the population does not. We will not be providing them with that information and we will not be allowing those who do know to acquire any further information about the extent of your abilities. Is that understood?"
Across from Ron snorted. "Give the guy a break, Hermione. He's fine."
He'd debated asking Lothair about it but he could already hear the disdain in the older Elf's voice. Maybe he'd just write to Soren and ask him. It would take longer, he supposed, but at least he was guaranteed more information and less attitude.
"Certainly," she commented, though the slight upturn at the corner of her mouth told Harry she might already know what he was going to say.
"Now he's calling you a liar." The man responded, his face still serious even as his eyes returned to Ilaria. "I've always questioned the company you keep."
Anyone walking by the infirmary then would have heard the rich sound of Rosalind's laughter echoing out into the corridor.
Seeing the movement, Zabini just smirked and glanced back to the front.
Rosalind sighed and moved to sit behind the desk she often allowed her students to use. It was the only one in the room and she would not leave the boys unattended while they underwent the current settling of their bond. "It's too late for that, Soren," she responded, meeting his eyes. "What's done is done. I'll take the first watch. Go, get some rest. It will be a day or so at best before they wake."
Draco stood, ignoring the shuffling and handshaking going on in the room. He wasn't concerned with what was going on in the room. His part had been played and now he was left to go over everything that he had learned. Was he already experiencing lichen characteristics manifesting? His thoughts drifted to the fight he'd had with Potter. Had these characteristics influenced him? Or was that just an excuse he was going to use?
The blank look on Ron's face was all that was needed to tell Hermione exactly what she needed to know. Ron had no idea what he was doing. Settling back into her chair, Hermione picked up her book and continued where she had left of. Dumbledore had said Harry would return and she believed him.
Doing his best to ignore the continued silence of his surroundings, Draco pressed forward, his already weak body protesting painfully against the continued movement. As he steadily, if not slowly, moved forward, the sound of the water's movement grew louder. He still couldn't make out anything in the distance and that made him just a bit nervous. The water wasn't flowing. It was rushing. If he needed to cross, he might be in even more trouble.
"What?" she shrugged, "Now that his clothes fit, he's not half bad in that "needs to be dominated" sort of way."
"Did you yell at her?" he asked, forcing a serious look onto his face. Of course, the scowl he received from Ron had his feigned seriousness falling apart rapidly.
"And yet, here you are," she commented dryly, "talking to me about someone you don't want to talk about."
Both were written in a delicate hand.
"The Manor?"
As Soren's description washed over him, Harry had the distinct feeling that he, on some level, should have felt some form of recognition. Was there suppose to be some connection between them? What did it mean if he didn't feel anything? There was a certain depth to her eyes that Harry could admit to being vaguely familiar but try, as he might, couldn't put a finger on.
"There are seven elemental bases in natural magic. Earth, Wood. Wind, Fire. Water. Ice. Lightening. Every creature who draws on natural magic has a core that stems from one of these bases. Earth is the most common with Lightening being the most rare of the six. Earth connects us all, while lightening is hard to control and unpredictable," Lothair explained, the way he spoke told Harry that he'd gone over this a million times in the past and he found himself wondering what exactly Lothair did in the Realm when he wasn't hunting down ignorant Dark Princes in the mortal world. "Each Element has a weakness and an advantage."
He and Gwynn had been following the river for quite sometime, having slipped through an opening in the trees seven or eight miles back. Harry hadn't known what he was racing toward, but the same instant that had told him to leave the Manor had urged him to head for the river. With his hearing, he'd been able to hear the commotion long before he'd seen it. When he'd arrived it hadn't been the werewolves that had shocked him. It had been the fact that an individual had slipped past the wards of the kingdom. He may have been new to the realm, but even he was aware that it should not have been possible. Of course, at the time, he hadn't known said individual was Draco Malfoy, a bitter school rival and someone Harry was know racing to save.
"I can help him," he responded. Soren lowered himself into a kneeling position in order to look calmly into Harry's eyes, rapidly changing eyes. It took several long moments before the red started to fade from them, the rest of his eyes lightening as it did. It was only then that Soren pressed on, knowing that if he attempted anything sooner, Harry would attack him with intent to kill. His instincts were taking over and the only thing Soren could do was wait. "Allow me through and I can help him."
Harry pouted at the slight. "I'm not that bad!"
Dumbledore smiled at them as they entered the room, his twinkling away as they usually did. There was no sign of anything out of the ordinary but Harry couldn't help but tense up. What he knew and what he thought he knew was at war and it was difficult to keep the tension from building.
He'd barely made it past the door before Lothair had met them, taking the stairs three at a time. "What the hell is going on?"
Harry nearly walked straight into the door he'd been trying to open. "
There seemed to be a collective release of breath around the entire table. Harry hadn't even realized he'd been holding his breath until he'd felt the relief rush through him at Rosalind's news. It was short lived, however, when he realized that she was waiting for them all to take in the news. Her eyes met his briefly and he knew that it wouldn't be just that easy.
Harry felt the flutter of magic around them, pooling around the door. Dumbledore was trying to prevent them from leaving. Lothair too seemed to have reached the same conclusion if his narrowed eyes were anything to go by. Lifting a hand, he placed it on the door. Harry felt a bit of tension and then it was all gone and the door swung open. Without saying anything, Lothair motioned for them to go through before following them out and leaving Dumbledore sitting in his office.
"Report!"
"Nothing," Harry responded, wiping the grin off his face. He wasn't going to point it out to the blonde. He was sure he'd be more annoyed when he discovered it himself.
Soren took the opportunity them to speak, but Harry wasn't listening. His thoughts had drifted inward. On one hand, he had these new agreements to contend with. Both those made to Oriss and Faelyn had the opportunity to become something much worse than Voldemort. As for Kolvar, Harry still wasn't sure what to make of him. What would the Dragon's be getting from all of this? Even with all of this running through his mind and all the dangers it could pose to both himself and the realm, Harry's thoughts went further into himself to poke at this new sense of magic within him. He'd broken into Ehlark's mind. Not only that but he'd influenced his decision. He didn't know how, exactly, but he had done it.
For a moment it looked as though Rosalind was going to continue arguing, her rigid frame still standing firmly between Soren and Draco, but after several long moments, Harry spotted her shoulders drooping. Whatever Soren had been talking about, she clearly seemed to understand, which only confused Harry all the more. "What do I have to do?" he asked, hoping that they'd finally tell him something that might make some sense. He couldn't help imagining that Draco's life ebbed away with each passing moment as they stood there arguing. Not true, of course, but the urgency within him held firmly to the concept.
Filling the sink with water, he splashed the cool liquid over his face. It was barely above freezing and offered a sharp burst of awareness. It wasn't a complete solution but it would do temporarily. Drying off, he moved back to the bedroom and tugged a shirt on. There was no point in trying to go back to bed. He knew he wouldn't find sleep again. Glancing to the window, he guessed he had about three hours before the sun fully set, which gave him plenty of time before the Manor began to stir.
Lothair straightened, lifting an arm to brush off his forehead. Whatever they had done had taken a toll out of them. All four of them were sweating and breathing heavily. "What the hell was that?" Draco asked, pushing off the wall where he'd been standing.
Draco's mind froze as new sounds began to register: heavy breathing, the loud crunching of something heavy snapping branches as it moved, and a low growl. With stiff movements, Draco slowly turned his head in the direction of the sound, his eyes landing on something he'd only ever seen in books and nightmares. Teeth bared threateningly, eyes trained expertly on him, and a tangled mess of dark fur covering powerful muscles. The werewolf was weaving through the tree trucks on a path that led directly to him. There was no delusion that could convince Draco that the creature's eyes weren't trained on him. Draco watched the careful and deliberate movements of the creature; a growing sense of panic building in his chest as he realized the beast was stalking him. With the smell of Draco's blood permeating the air, the wolf was hunting.
"Sorry, did I... interrupt something?" Potter asks, his smile morphing into a frown of uncertainty.
"I used to wear the Malfoy ring, but I stopped, as I no longer want to lord my heritage over others. The ring reminds me how far I've come from my fall from grace and how far I have to go. I don't remember Pansy as the ‘traitor’ who tried to surrender you, nor do I dwell on her wrongdoings during the war. I remember her as my best friend, the brilliant writer who could conjure all sorts of stories during boring classes."
"Here." Harry pushes a vinyl record — “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You” by Frankie Valli — into Malfoy’s hands. "I don't know if you've got anything to play it, but I just wanted to get it for you, 'cause it's... well... one of my favourite songs in your repertoire."
rings out from the group.
They stay like that for a while, each taking comfort in the peace and quiet of the early morning and in each other.
"I can't go home, I can't tell you anything, and it hurts enough to kill me."
Draco glances at the clock — it’s too early for the students to be out and about, so the lake should be deserted. He stretches, and then hauls himself out of bed. He proceeds with his daily morning routine. He kept the décor of his quarters similar to the Slytherin dungeons; outfitted in the muted colour of dark green and wooden cupboards, with silver motifs adorning the stone walls and soft green lamps.
He barely has enough time to finish his sentence before he's engulfed in a puff of smoke, and at the spot where he was standing just seconds ago...
"Nothing wrong with that, yeah?" Harry runs his lips down the side of Malfoy's waist. "Wanna please you."
"The... Shrieking Shack. How romantic," Draco drawls when they arrive at Potter's destination.
... after I'm done fantasising about you, I've got the real thing upstairs waiting for me. Gonna touch you, gonna hold you, never let you go, fuck, gonna wake you up with a blowjob tomorrow morning, fuck, just thinking about your cock in my mouth, I can't... fuck I'm c-c-coming, Draco,
“What’s this?” Marjorie asks. She tilts her head, trying to look at the sketch the right way round. “May I?” She gestures to the book.
," Harry muttered, feeling the monster's roars subsiding as it stood down, satisfied at Draco's answer.
"Quidditch," he replies smoothly. "Most of my free time goes towards playing Quidditch."
"She'll be watching us have sex?" Draco points out blandly, eliciting a sheepish smile from Potter.
Charlie looks at the injury and winces at the memory. "Yeah. She's a right fighter, that one. She and I go a long way back, and... " He sighs, rubbing the back of his neck. "She's not doing too well at the moment." His expression of concern morphs into irritation when his fingers catch on air instead of his usual ponytail.
"Yes, and that too," Draco's chuckle morphs into a full-blown laugh now. He sits down on the floor gracefully in front of Potter and slips his briefs off.
Draco knows he’s supposed to be jumping for joy, but it’s just… too much too soon, isn’t it?
...and now he's gone.
Potter gazes back, answering with an equally miserable look.
That was before Harry had discovered he was gay, though.
Harry's life would have turned out very differently if he didn't stumble upon Dean Thomas, hunched over on the floor of an abandoned classroom, working on an oil painting of Hogwarts. Dean offered him a paintbrush and a welcoming smile, waving away Harry's doubts that he was absolute pants at drawing.
Seconds pass while a panting Draco stays completely still, bowing his head until the tips of his hair graze Harry's chest, his fingers sunken deep into the mattress.
"I finished my final year after the War and left Hogwarts a year ago," Harry doesn't miss how Malfoy's left arm tenses when he mentions the War, and quickly steers the conversation back to Quidditch.
Harry stalks out of the suite, wincing and limping slightly — no, he can't leave now, he didn’t take the potion — but before Draco can explain, Harry's gone.
Harry's fidgeting — his fingers lacing and unlacing, while his right foot is tapping out a rhythm on the wooden floor. Although Draco is looking straight ahead, he can see Harry shooting him glances in his peripheral vision. Draco's about to ask him about it when Harry blurts out, "I wanted to kiss you that day. In Paris. In the rain." His grin softens into a dreamy smile. "I loved seeing you like that."
"Not stopping. We'll go slow. No rush. Got the whole night," Harry soothes, smoothing Malfoy's hair back and kissing him slowly, sweetly until he relaxes, nervous tension seeping out of his body.
"Post me anywhere. Anywhere but here," he requested of Kingsley.
"Yeah, before I came. I don’t know how you feel about beard burn, and… er…" he trails off, his face warming up.
Harry almost drops his plate.
"You've been smiling all night," Potter remarks, lifting his leg and resting his right ankle on his left knee. "Guess you really like me too, huh?"
That evening, the lights were on in Malfoy's flat. Harry raised his fist to knock, but hesitated. After a long moment of standing outside his door like a loon, he hung the bag on the doorknob, knocked and ran off, hiding behind a car like some lovesick stalker. Malfoy opened the door, looked into the bag and scanned his surroundings. He took the bag and smiled, before turning and closing the door.
“To your right,” he croaks, and the class follows.
Potter freezes, before slowly turning around to face him.
“So good, God, I can’t- Harry, please, so fuckin’ good, I gotta, please, Harry-” Malfoy manages between pants. He reaches up to touch Harry’s prick, but Harry nudges his hand away. Instead, Malfoy strokes the inside of Harry’s thighs with feather-light touches. The combined sensations of Malfoy deep in him, his hands on his thighs and his own hand on his cock is exquisite, and Harry cries out in pleasure when the head of Malfoy’s cock presses into him right there. He knows what Malfoy wants, and he’s gonna give it to him so good, yeah, he’ll give Malfoy anything he wants-
"You're paying me," she responded, dryly. "I'm not doing it out of the kindness of my heart."
The responding growl was the only response as the remaining two High Lords watched them disappear.
"We apologize for interrupting your meal," Lothair greeted, lowering his head slightly in greeting once he had stopped in front of the Head table. "We had planned to arrive earlier but we had some unexpected delays."
The soft brush of fingertips across his feverish skin was the first thing Harry's muddled senses had registered. The second was that the pleased moan that had seemed to echo loudly through his mind had escaped from between his own lips. For as hot as his skin burned, the touch of those fingertips over his stomach left lines of icy relief in their wake. Those cool touches only made it extremely difficult for Harry to keep his breath from rushing past his lips in small gasps of surprise and pleasure. The arms that slowly snaked around his waist held the same icy touch but it was the strong chest pressed against the warm skin of his back that nearly broke the hold he had on himself.
"Under normal circumstances, this would have been a non-issue. Humans are not allowed into the realm. We've put up both physical and magical barriers to ensure that they don't," Sore continued, unfazed by Harry's stubbornness. "Draco is the first human to enter the realm in centuries. The fact that he managed to enter the realm is enough of a problem on it's own."
Reaching the Potions classroom, he found the door still locked. Lifting a hand, he exercised some of his magic and lifted the spell holding it closed. With a brief knock, he glanced down the length of the hallway before moving inside. He wasn't at all surprised to find a wand pointed in his direction. He had just broken in, after all.
"Isn't that a bit much?" Harry asked, raising an eyebrow. If he had them constantly monitoring the school grounds, it was going to be much harder to accomplish what he'd come here to do.
"He doesn't understand what he's saying?"
It had been two days since Harry had seen Draco. When the blond had left, Harry had laid in the courtyard for several long moments before allowing Gwen to haul him to his feet. He'd mumbled a thank you and had wandered back into the castle, leaving her to stare in concern at his retreating back. He hadn't seen her in two days either. He'd returned to his room. Stripping out of his dirt and blood stained clothes, he'd fallen onto bed and remained there until Soren disturbed his morose thoughts.
"You're making a big deal out of nothing, Lothair. Calm yourself."
"I wouldn't be worried about me," Ilaria grinned, moving further into the room, "He's the one who said you were unoriginal."
Turning his eyes away from the elegant picture the hall offered, Harry had allowed them to fall on Soren, who's face held a knowing smile. Of course, the older Elf had known exactly what to expect. "Why does it feel like home?"
"What's wrong, Malfoy?" Harry taunted, "Too slow?"
"You are an Elf," she started, motioning for him to follow her. Leading him away from the main room, Rosalind stepped back into her professional quarters. Knowing the others would be returning, she did not head for the office, instead turning them toward the conference room. It was a little less personal, she supposed, but it would allow Draco the room to retreat if he so needed it. There was a lot of information to be stowed upon him. "Created as such in an attempt to save your life. I should stress upon you the significance of this. We do not involve ourselves in the affairs of the Wizards and we do not change them to increase our own population. We accept only those who have had Elven blood passed down through the generations and are lucky enough to have it activated upon their inheritance. Harry, as you are aware, insisted that we step in when it came to you. He was quite persistent that keeping you alive was the right course of action."
"I am not whining! I'm concerned! Something you should be!"
He let those words wash over him for a moment before he shoved them away as he always did but, somehow, they didn't feel quite so distant anymore. He could feel them whispering at the edge of his awareness as though waiting for an opportunity to slip free from their confines. It didn't matter. It wasn't anything he hadn't heard before. It wasn't anything he couldn't accept. He'd be fine.
Beside him Zabini cleared his throat, making Harry realize he'd been gripping the edge of the table so hard the wood was starting to creak. Flushing, he released it in a hurry and offered a sheepish smile before quickly volunteering to go and grab the necessary ingredients for the potions.
"Explain."
Harry flushed brilliantly at that. "Woo?" he spluttered, shaking his head. "I'm pretty sure he'll just make fun of me all the more ... or break my noise again."
Three days.
Draco glanced back up at the question and offered a lazy shrug. "Given my options, I think the Elves are probably a safer bet than Voldemort or Dumbledore." He didn't offer up any information about his own Elf blood or the irritating bond between them. Keeping that to himself was probably in his best interest for now.
Draco paled, the colour draining from his face with every word that she spoke. There were so many things wrong with this situation. Werewolves, dragons, Potter, blood, all of it. He had grown up in a Pureblood household fond of the Dark Arts and Godson to the best Potions Master Hogwarts had ever seen. Harry might not have been aware of the significance of their blood transfusion, but Draco was well aware. Blood magic was powerful. Arguably the most powerful magic there was. It was the reason blood was such an expensive potions ingredient. It added power to any brew, but it was also a volatile ingredient. Too little or too much could have dangerous side effects. The sharing of blood between two wizards was taboo. It was the reason there were blood replenishing potions for injuries where major blood loss had occurred. Adding an Elven ritual and a creature inheritance to the mix only further complicated the entire situation.
Leaving the two to themselves, he headed toward where the other's were gathering. None of them seemed all that concerned about a large amount of tack that was piling up. A moment later, the reason for that became clear. With a few words Draco couldn't quite make out, they all vanished. He shot Lothair a questioning look but the other Elf didn't seem all that interested in answering the unasked question in Draco's eyes.
Soren sighed, glancing up from the book in his lap to pin Lothair with an irritated look. "What, pray tell, are you complaining about this time?" Lothair had seemed to be in a terrible mood for days now and, if Soren was being honest, he wasn't entirely sure which one of them the other Elf was currently enraged over.
Whatever Harry had been expecting it hadn't been to just walk right in the front door and straight into the Great Hall in the middle of Dinner. They were supposed to be keeping a low profile, weren't they? This was the exact opposite of a low profile. When Lothair had flung the doors open, hundreds of eyes had turned to look at them and he was suddenly very appreciative of the glamours they'd been made to wear. Even Lothair had worn one. His pointed ears were gone and his hair had been shortened in a style similar to Draco's and his clothes had been changed to standard Muggle wear. Had he not seen the change, he wouldn't have believed the Elf even knew what casual was.
"Well, look at it this way," Ron commented, taking a huge bite out of his sandwich before continuing, "it can- get -uch worse."
Harry frowned, "If there's any deeds they'd be at Gringotts in the vault."
Despite the name, the place was more of a Castle than a Manor, but Draco didn't care. Under other circumstances, he'd have taken great pleasure in his surrounding. He'd have loved to spend hours studying the portraits on the wall or the paintings depicting battles and conflicts he wasn't familiar with. The whole place was full of things he had no knowledge on. As it stood, he passed by them silently, a heavy cloud following as he moved until, gradually, the sound of voices began to dawn on him; until a familiar voice dawned on him.
"Gladius then," he nodded, offering a hand to take the sword back from Harry. "30 inches should do it." The one he'd given the boy had been 33, which had shifted his center of balance enough to be a problem. Turning his attention back to Ilaria, he asked, "Any specifications?"
"Malfoy!"
"Draco?"
It was an interesting concept, that was certain, and the longer he spent thinking of it the more Harry began to see just what Soren was referring to. It was obvious with the moving staircases and the knowledge of the Room of Requirement. It all seemed to make much more sense when looked at through Soren's eyes, but there was still an aspect that he was unsure of. "If Hogwarts is alive than what about Magic? I always thought Hogwarts was the way it was because of magic."
Harry stiffened, narrowing his eyes in return. "Feel what?"
The melodic laugh that escaped the small Elf was not the reaction Harry had expected. He'd expected an argument. He'd expected Soren to insist or Lothair to demand it.
"And what if I'm right?" Harry countered, his tone holding that icy chill. It sent a shiver through Draco and he was having a hard time focusing on anything other than this new shift in the room. The energy spiked before dropping again, so quickly Draco could have been convinced that he'd imagined it. Despite himself, he felt drawn to it as though fascinated. "Are you willing to draw his attention to these borders? A man willing to hack his souls into multiple pieces? What do you think he'd be willing to do to these lands? To its people?"
Draco glanced back at the man and studied him for a moment. There wasn't pity in his eyes, but a sharp understanding of the situation. Pity wasn't necessary and it certainly didn't serve a purposed. The man before him understood that. "I know."
"So," Ilaria pressed, raising an eyebrow, "What do you think?"
Embarrassment might have been the next step in his thought process, but the sight of the braid indicated that responsibility had not lain with the Elf standing at the end of the bed. Rosalind had taken care of his appearance and he found it hard to find embarrassment in her motherly actions. She had helped Draco and Harry both and, for that, he was beyond grateful.
"Yeah," the redhead scowled, "it's hilarious that she thinks I'm not good enough!"
"Merlin's beard," Harry grumbled, having finally managed to stop the bleeding. His nose was still crooked and looked a right mess beneath the instant bruising and dried smears of blood, but he wasn't overly concerned. "You could wake up like a normal person, you know? Not jumping around like the hounds of hell are on your heels!"
"But you just said-"
Even Draco was caught a bit off guard, blinking stupidly at Harry before he managed to shake off the daze. Sheedra, however, seemed to be completely immune to it as she just continued to glare at them. After several long moments, she finally uncrossed her arms and went to retrieve three plates. Setting them down, Draco didn't miss the fact that Harry's plate seemed to have a good deal more heaped upon it.
"It's going to take me a few hours to organize the procedure," Rosalind sighed, letting her hands fall from her hips. She really didn't want to do this, but there were few on the medical staff that she could trust with such a procedure. At least Harry now understood a little of what he was getting into and that was something. Not much, but something. "There's nothing you really have to do but show up, Harry, though I would prefer if you didn't eat or drink anything for the next couple of hours. The amount of blood we need for the transfusion will make you a bit dizzy and I'd prefer not to be thrown up on."
Harry blinked for several long moments before the pieces seemed to slip into place and he choked back a laugh. He honestly tried to keep his amusement in check, but the look on Gwynn's face paired with his sudden understanding succeeded in preventing such a thing. It took barely any time for his laughter to escape him, filling the area with the rich sound. It had been a long time since he'd laughed so freely.
"Stop feeling sorry for yourself, already!" she demanded, shooting him a pointed look that dared him to argue that he wasn't. It was there all over his face. Pity. "They do not favour him over you. You're the rightful heir to the throne and nothing is going to change that. This Malfoy of yours is just another subject under your rule and he'll see that soon enough."
Lothair didn't bother to validate his comment with a response, dismissing them instead.
"Good Morning, Sheedra!" Harry chirped, having sat up a bit straighter during her lecture and flashing a blinding bright smile in the woman's direction. "You look absolutely lovely today, has anyone told you that?"
"Sorry," he muttered, even if a part of him felt lighter at Draco's continued laughter.
"Perhaps they wouldn't be inclined to skip them if you didn't insist on making them look like fools," Lothair responded, an almost warm tone to his voice. It was a tone that Harry had not heard coming from the rigid Elf. It sounded a bit odd.
The fact that he couldn't decide why he'd ever started referring to him by his first name to begin with only infuriated him all the more.
It was not a little thing to be offered the protection of the realm and Hendrik was hesitant to turn it down. "And the other conditions?"
Harry couldn't entirely come up with a plausible answer to that. He'd tried to assume it was because he simply didn't want to be responsible for another death. His error had killed Sirius. How many others had died because he had yet to stop Voldemort? Draco, perhaps, was merely his chance to actually save someone instead of putting them in danger...though, he was pretty sure tying Draco to him was only putting the blond in further danger. It would be a weakness that Voldemort and even Roland wouldn't miss. Still, the excuse did not sit well with him and he had no other explanation to try.
"It is their only chance, my love." Soren's eyes released their hold on Harry and softened as his attention shifted to his mate. For a brief moment, Harry felt as though he was intruding on a private moment. He had a ridiculously strange urge to look at Draco, all of a sudden, and it took nearly every ounce of strength within him to fight that off. Had it not been for Soren's voice continuing, he might have given in under the incredible pressure in his chest. "There is much more at work here than just a bond. You know what will happen if the boy dies. As much as I wish I didn't have to say this, it's not just about them. This is about all of us."
"I understand that, Remus, but Elves are very hesitant about mingling in the Wizarding world and would not have made their presence known unless James had shown definite signs of coming into his heritage, which we know did not happen. It has often been the case that magical blood has skipped a generations, even going so far as to skip several. There could very well have been the blood of the Elves in the Potter line without James showing signs of that heritage," Dumbledore explained, his features never shifting and never giving away any emotion he didn't want seen. Internally, he was making plans and altering the ones he had already built. He had been sure he had combed through every piece of information on the Potter family, but he had not once found evidence of them being anything other than what was represented to the public. He had not anticipated this. Something needed to be done to set tings on the right path once again, otherwise, plans that had been set in motion years before would have no hope of bearing fruit.
Draco jolted awake with a gasp, wide eyes staring through the darkness to the pale ceiling above him. His heart hammered against his ribs as he pushed himself up. "Shit," he groaned, lifting a hand to brush his hair back, registering the way his hand shook as he lifted it. He'd been having nightmares every night since he'd arrived in this place. Every night he'd seen his Mother and what might be currently happening to her. Every night he'd wake up just like this.
"It's not my fault that they can't handle being put to the floor by a woman."
"Enough."
Silence fell heavily around them, the tension thick in the air around them for several long moments, before Gabriel finally shifted in his seat. "I'm glad to help," he offered, nodding his head first to Harry and then to who he assumed was Draco. Harry, for his part, was still holding Hendrik's glare. "Your mate will be in good hands, I swear."
"Stop giving me reasons to!"
"He's not one of them!"
"What?" he asked, groggily, owlishly blinking his eyes to try and focus, "What's going on?"
Breaking away from appreciating the windows and ceiling, Harry spotted a hallway leading off from the main room and headed in that direction. He felt Draco falling into step behind him without having to look. Reaching the first door, he stuck his head in to find a bedroom. Unlike the main area, this room was fully furnished. A large bed sat against the far wall. Light from the enchanted windows filling the room and highlighting the desk and wardrobe also present. It was nowhere as big as their rooms at Jade Manor, but it certainly was better than anything they'd find in the dorms.
Even in his most errant of thoughts, the rules and regulations that guided an acting figurehead had never been top priority. Be that as it may, Harry's current lack of knowledge in that particular venue certainly wasn't making life at Jade Manor any easier. Harry found no enjoyment in being the center of attention, which, he supposed, completely dovetailed his new determination to prove himself. This wasn't simply about keeping Lothair quiet, but it rather concerned his understanding of his own self-worth. For Harry, his entire world prior to his seventeenth birthday was based loosely on obscure definitions of
I know. I'm terrible at this updating thing. In reality I haven't had anything pressing going on in the last year, so it's really been only laziness preventing me from going ahead and continuing with this story. I can say that I'm going to try harder to get this story going again, but I won't make any promises. Creativity comes in it's own time...granted, I started this story in 2007...so I think it's about time I finish it. I don't want it to be one of those things I'm still working on when I'm grey haired.
Harry hadn't even noticed that Draco had already dressed for classes. Someone must have arranged for the uniform because this one fit the blonde perfectly. Given the change in his physical form, there would have been no way that the old set would have fit.
"It looks like you're lurking in my bedroom!" Harry accused.
"How is that even possible?" Hendrik asked. He'd been born a werewolf and had never heard of such a thing.
Stepping into the room, his feet didn't meet the smooth polished stone he'd just left. Instead, they found soft grass, the earth indenting beneath his weight. The vaulted ceiling was roughly three stories above him if he had to take a guess, and ahead of him was what he could only assume was the royal bathing room. The grass stretched out until it reached smooth stone, polished by the constant flow of water. The stone climbed it's way up, leveling out into various platforms on different levels that contained at least one pool of varying size and depth, until finally it reached the top where the steady flow of a waterfall fell to ensure the constant presence of fresh water. Even greater still, Draco could tell from where he stood that the temperature of that water was not that of a regular waterfall, he could see the wafting steam as it filled each pool and he had a growing suspicion that should he touch it, he'd find it to be the perfect temperature.
Snape sat back in his chair and studied Draco. He was different, that much as blatantly obvious, but Severus wasn't entirely sure how deep the changes went. He had his suspicions given the level of physical changes he'd gone through. No normal wizard's appearance altered to that extent during a magical inheritance. In fact, it rarely altered at all. On top of which, he'd managed to get through his warding spell with hardly any effort. Again, not something easily accomplished.
With the mystery of the first door solved, Draco moved to the left, stopping at the door in the center. Reaching out for the handle he found this door also unlocked. With a slight twist of his wrist the door unlatched and he easily swung it open.
It was Pansy who responded, slipping an arm around Draco's waist. "And why would he need to talk to you, Potter?"
"You're dismissed!"
"It isn't like I had much of a choice-"
Gwen watched the door close behind them, bewilderment lingering all over her face. When she glanced back to her food, she found most of the room looking at her as though expecting some sort of explanation for the abrupt departure. Flushing slightly, she just shrugged. "It's complicated?"
Distractedly, he lifted his wand and cast the appropriate stasis spell. Without compensating for the fact that he no longer needed the wand, his magic flowed through the piece of holly, shattering it and erupting the otherwise docile potion in front of him with a loud bang, startling the entire classroom as he, Zabini, and everyone within a three-foot radius were covered in pale blue goo. Pieces of his wand were scattered around them, a smouldering feather at his feet the only indication that it had actually been a wand.
Harry just stared at her. She'd finally lost it. Snapped. Crazy. He and Draco? Mates? No. Absolutely not. The would be bonded, not mates. It was, by far, the most ridiculous thing he'd ever heard. Just because you share a little blood doesn't mean you're connected in that capacity. Sure, it's intimate, he guessed, but that was it. He stomach turned at the thought of Draco becoming submissive to anyone. He'd absolutely loath the idea. In fact, Harry didn't even know how Draco would react to it and that thought scared him the most. "You're wrong. You have to be."
"That's because I'm a male."
"That went well."
"We within range of Hogwarts when we leave the realm."
ties."
Draco felt the world tilt slightly and he blinked. "What do you mean you can't repair the damage."
"And what of the Prince?"
He'd felt that sort of fear before and he didn't want to feel it again.
Harry didn't have to lift the arm from his face to know who was standing at the foot of the couch. After the embarrassing scene in the conference room, he'd bolted back to his own suite and was currently sprawled out on the sofa with a rather prominent air of disgrace. He figured someone would show up sooner or later. "Go away."
"Potter?"
Long before the Scout could possibly form a response, Roland's slim fingers stiffened around the Elf's vocal cords in an iron grip before ripping his dangerously sharp nails from the body before him, the Elf's vocal cords sill clutched tightly in his fingers. The unfortunate messenger had not had the chance to scream before blood began to flow from the gaping hole in his throat in thick, sluggish waves.
"Roland knew exactly when and how we were transporting the Prince to Jade Manor."
Caught not once but twice, Harry flushed slightly. With no other option, he urged Erebus forward. He supposed he might as well speak to her after having been caught staring. The last thing he needed was to offend her. Regardless of whatever else was going on, he needed her skills. That much, he knew, she had. Only a day after he had spoken with Lothair about inquiring about the Potter properties, the older elf had returned with an envelope containing a list of all the Potter's properties and the contents of their vaults. He'd been assured that they were copies of the original documents in order to avoid anyone discovering that they were digging around. He'd been floored but what the contents of that folder had contained. Among the list of properties, there were documents on who had been responsible for the holdings until Harry had come of age. Sirius had originally been charged with the responsibility, but since he'd been arrested shortly after his parent's deaths, it had shifted to Harry's closest living relative: Petunia Dursley. It hadn't made sense. Vernon had always gone on and on about not having had any compensation for taking Harry in. If they'd been in control of the Potter's wealth there should have been large amounts missing. Hell, he'd have been surprised to find anything left at all.
Closing his eyes for a moment. Soren debated his options. Draco wasn't a wizard anymore and his insistence that he return to school had ramifications that ran deeper than just the anger Harry might be feeling over it. It went against centuries of regulations and that was if Harry chose to remain behind. "Send out a summons to the Council," he finally sighed, earning a surprised look from the other Elf. It had been decades since they'd summoned the Council.
Three days.
"Very well," Dumbledore nodded, motioning to Snape to allow the conversation.
With just that little thought, he could almost feel the blood from his dream coat his hands. He could almost imagine it dripping from his fingers to stain the pristine tiles beneath his feet.
As he glanced around, he half expected to find the basilisk lurking around the corner. There was no sign of it's remains anywhere and Harry wondered if someone had come to collect it. House-elves, maybe? It didn't really matter, he supposed, so long as it wasn't still there lurking in wait for him.
Harry watched as the blond disappeared through the door, a slow grin spreading across his face. He'd take that as an acceptance.
Rosalind was surprised that such knowledge was possessed by the blond and the look on her face spoke of it. It had been generations since the Elves had been frequent visitors to the mortal realm. "I was unaware the Wizarding folk still remember a time when we did." This one sparked her curiosity in very different ways than Harry. Harry worried her in the way that most Mothers did. Her own children had long since grown and left home. Harry had instantly reminded her of them in their youth and had her instantly believing that he was in need of protecting. Draco, it seemed, sparked her more intellectual interests.
Harry's eyes narrowed as Draco passed, storming off down the hall and leaving him alone with Gwynn once more, not hat he even noticed her presence. All of his attention was focused on the disappearing figure down the hall, with each step Draco took the pain in Harry's chest tightened. If nothing else, the insufferable git had made one thing clear to Harry and it had nothing to do with Draco's distaste for him.
Draco watched as Potter grinned, accepting the hand as the girl pulled him to his feet. He watched as Potter lingered, grinning like an idiot, his hand still holding onto hers. The anger inside of him began to swell, washing over him in wave after wave. Unlike the Gryffindor in front of him, Draco had always been good at keeping his emotions in check. Potter, really, had been the only one irritating enough to push him past his limit and that didn't seem to be changing. Still his hand was in hers and something inside of Draco snapped beneath the weight of all that had happened.
"They can't get through the wards," Draco commented, offering the older elf a shrug. "What's the problem if they know."
"What does he mean it isn't important?" she asked, her voice interrupting the quite drone of surprised murmuring that was currently moving around the old wooden table, causing fourteen pairs of eyes to focus on her. "Of course he's coming back. He needs his education."
Several heads around the table nodded at that, falling into the ever-present logic of the Werewolf. It was true. There was no one who knew the Potter's better than Remus Lupin and Sirius Black. The two had been friends with the couple both inside and outside of Hogwarts. Surely, they would not have been able to hide something like that from two of their closest friends.
Soren's eyes rose to meet Lothair's as the Elf stepped out of a long shadow cast by one of the many shelves of books. He could not say that Lothair was completely wrong. Clearly something needed to be altered before they could continue. "Call for Ilaria," he sighed, feeling far older than he had in a very long time.
"Kitchen, here." came another voice.
Harry nodded. There had been times in the past when that would have been an impossible task. It was strange that now it didn't seem so hard. Perhaps it had been watching the blond disappear beneath the rushing current or, perhaps, it had been the fear of finding him dead that had changed his outlook. Whatever it was, Harry no longer saw him as less. He was on equal footing with those Harry had cared about for years. Had it been Ron or Hermione, he would have done the same thing. If saving them had meant being bound to them, then so be it. Somewhere along the way, Draco had taken up a place beside them. He couldn't say when or where, but the deep sense of approval in his chest told him it was the truth.
As he continued to make his way through the halls of Jade Manor he was struck by how quiet the building was. In his recent travels he had not seen or heard another living soul since he had left the High Lords. Soren had mentioned that Dark Elves preferred the night but so far Soren and Lothair had been up and travelling during the often harsh light of day. To consider that this new world was not operating on the same sense of time as the Wizarding world was still quite strange. Despite having been up since the early morning, he could feel his energy increase as the sun moved through the sky. The closer the darkness came the more energy seemed to run through his body.
It took a moment, but Harry nodded, pulling himself away from the warmth spreading through his chest. "It's fine, Ron," he commented, his voice still somewhat distant. "We're just talking."
"Shite! God bloody damn it."
Harry just blinked at him. "What?"
was the first thought. He'd seen them before. They'd been wide in surprise and fear. One memory led to another, as his body remembered the icy cold temperature of the river as he had been thrown into it and the searing pain of the wolf at his back. As his body remembered the pain, Draco sucked in a deep breath and bolted upright, only to have his head connected violently with Harry's, the crunching sound of broken bones and Harry's cry of pain echoed in the following silence of the room.
