WixFic
Present:
Now, there was this person. Who was most likely one of his friends. And they had not only shown they knew who he was but had also put it out there. A true version of himself was out there for people to learn about. It should have been invasive but for whatever reason, it was comforting.
. . .
Harry smiles and suddenly, it’s like something has shifted between them. He’s not entirely sure what’s happening but he just feels lighter.
“Er, hi. Everything is . . . fine? Can I come in?”
Blaise smiles at Harry, reaching out to pat his hand. He pauses thoughtfully, “Harry, will you tell me the truth?”
Nott looked a bit confused before clarity came over him. “Are you talking about that writing thing Luna does with that Smith guy?” Harry nodded.
- instant communication.
WixFic is the brainchild of Luna Lovegood, Zacharias Smith, and Tracey Davis. The Hogwarts alumni are members of 1999’s “Eighth-Year” Class. The trio started the project as an attempt at post-War unity. According to Lovegood, the post-War atmosphere led to an “over infestation of Wrackspurts''. When Parkinson Publishing acquired the Daily Prophet in 2000, a vacuum was created in the publishing world. LSD stepped in and introduced a new form of writing - WixFic.
“Really? Was it an in-depth character study and analysis of my childhood dreams?”
“Why are you so curious about this? People are constantly writing or talking about you. What makes this person so unique?”
He steps back and moves to his sitting room, knowing Potter will follow him in. He sits down on the loveseat and motions for Harry to sit too, but he seems too keyed up and begins pacing in front of him.
This month, much to his utter dismay, the fad was Dirigible Plums. He silently cursed Draco for introducing her to Luna as he pushed the soup (?) around.
Potter’s “notes” were a whole case file.
“Are you sure, you don’t know who this is? Because, I know none of the others do, but I have a small inkling of who it might be. And I think you do too.”
Nott froze. He shook his head, straightening in his seat. “Yes. I did want to be one. But not many people know that.”
Harry was startled out of his reverie by the sudden question. Blaise had a habit of dropping all pretenses of pleasantry. There would be silence or a lull in the conversation and he would jump in with a very direct (sometimes invasive) question.
Harry finally comes to a stop in front of him and pulls out a sheaf of parchment from his pocket. He drops them on Draco’s knees and sits in the armchair opposite him.
“Draco, I have been obsessing over this for weeks. And I’ve been going around asking people if they’ve written it, even though some part of me suspected it was you all along. I had hoped it was you. Your writing makes me feel the way it feels when you’re around me. I like that feeling.”
Suspect # 4 - Pansy Parkinson; The Journalist
Theo’s studio was quiet. This was odd for a Wednesday afternoon, but Harry wrote it off when he saw a sign on the blackboard -
Suspect # 1 - Daphne Greengrass; The Publicist
Draco nods shyly. They gather their things and exit the apartment. Draco locks his flat and turns to leave. There’s an atmosphere of anticipation around them, but Draco’s not worried. Dinner could be something more, or it may just be two friends catching up. And if Harry casually holds onto Draco’s hand the whole time, well he’s not going to complain.
“ I wanted to talk to you about something. Is everything okay? You look . . . frazzled.”
Harry knew why he wanted to know. But it was difficult admitting truths about oneself out loud. And he certainly did not need to tell Nott.
He’s glad to be back home though. He drops his bag off in his bedroom and goes to check his Owl Box. Draco’s only been gone for a week, but from the state of his post, it seems like he’s been missing for months. His Owl Box is bursting at the seams. The attached Owl Treat Feeder, which only needed to be refilled every 3 months was empty.
Draco’s been back for five minutes when Harry shows up. The Potions conference had been such a bore. He had attended in hopes that he could meet Ro Lux, an American Potions Master, who had made strides in counteracting the mood-related effects of Wolfsbane. Lux dropped out at the last minute due to a sudden onset of Spattergroit. All in all, it had been a complete waste of time.
of it anyway. Harry looked to be debating something. He got this furrow between his brows and his fingers seemed to be permanently attached to his temple whenever he was coming to a difficult decision.
Harry let out a frustrated sigh and brought him up-to-date on the why’s and what’s of his predicament. “You know, today’s post was actually about you,” he added as he finished.
. . .
Silence filled his sitting room. Draco was starting to slip into a panic. He didn’t know what was going to happen now. It was out there,
At this moment, he was on a quest to unmask a WixFic writer, who apparently had a scary amount of insight into Potter’s psyche. And he was debating the merits of hiring someone to find this person or to undertake the “investigation” himself.
“I got drunk one night. It was a couple of weeks after Aquilla had come home. Blaise had stepped in and demanded Theo take a night off. He took over for two days, switching off with Astoria and Greg, just to make sure Theo got some sleep. Theo had come over, just that afternoon, and we had spent the entire time reminding ourselves of the “good ole days”. I told him how proud I was of him and that I was beyond happy for how he had turned out to be. Naturally, I embarrassed him enough for both of us to get terribly awkward and the solution had been to get absolutely blasted on Firewhiskey. When he left, I was still feeling maudlin and came up with the brilliant idea to write down whatever was feeling. I passed out with my quill still in the inkwell.” Draco paused for a second, summoning two bottles of Butterbeer. He took a sip, before continuing.
“Ah, yes. I had forgotten Luna might have done these already. I’m sorry to say these might be a miss this month.”
Naturally, the series was not about people, but something inanimate. That was the only detail he had and would provide when asked about his work.
Harry was baffled. “What does that have to do with anything?”
Harry frowns. It’s not like the thought hasn’t crossed his mind. Of course, the first person he had wanted it to be was Draco. And then when it led him to his friends, a small ember of hope had been kindled with him. Which only grew when he realized it must be a Slytherin. But as much as he wants it to be Draco, he’s also afraid of what that would mean.
He sighed, running his hand through his hair. He settled back into his seat, steering the conversation to writing, writers, and writing workshops. Astoria swiftly pulled out a brochure for an upcoming crime/mystery-themed one in Muggle London. He finished the meditation session and headed back to Grimmauld.
“Nope, not a word. Although the art thing sounds interesting. Dean might know more about it and most likely already has qualms about licensing rights or something like that. What are you looking for?”
Lovegood Smith Davis
“Was. I was writing about you. Not anymore. I’m taking a break,” he added hurriedly before Harry could ask.
“Potter, even if we do know this person, why does it matter who they are? From what you’ve told me about them, it’s not like they’re out there slandering you or your friends. They just want to be anonymous. Why not let them be?”
He looked around at the empty room. Nott had turned to art after the War. After he was disowned by his parents, he started an art studio. Three months after he was cut off, Aquila Nott was introduced to the Wizarding World.
“I don’t want to be like the Dursley’s or the people that said that people like you are disgusting…”
“What did you do that for?”
“Whatever shall we do? we can’t have the hero of the wizarding world be seen like this” Draco hummed coming into the shop half a minute later. "I’m surprised it hasn’t already caused a riot"
“Mr Shurley”
“Its not wrong…Not really but it doesn’t make the same strength of potion same as the pine needles, if you only add six you make a smoother potion, and it tastes better if you add a pinch of nutmeg, Dad always does it for me”
“Sorry” Harry apologised “I don’t have a watch…”
“Mother is fine, father…Well father is father…He learnt his lesson but once an idiot always an idiot…What’s so funny?” Draco asked as Harry started laughing and all at once he was worried that maybe this had been some ploy, a way of tormenting him. He was used to people spitting on him wherever he went but he didn’t want to believe that Harry could possibly be like that.
“James once said that he had a distant family member that was one” Remus hummed thoughtfully “But I have a strong feeling that his ability may be linked to the scar more than family connection, however I don’t understand how it is all connected”
“Youse have a letter young sirs" Dobby answered pulling a letter from out of the depths of his dirty pillow case. Draco sighed slowly expecting it to be from Pansy, she was in Europe at the moment had been sending him almost daily owls about all of the things she was doing and wearing. It was an obvious attempt to draw out jealousy but he had assurances from his father that they would be going to Japan later in the year.
“Um, sorry, I was thinking. I don’t think I’m going to be particularly good at this.”
Harry lay silently beside Draco in the large bed. The blonde was breathing peacefully but Harry could tell that he wasn’t asleep. He had been in a strange mood since the Chimera and Harry was afraid that he had embarrassed him, but he didn’t know how to apologise. The burning in his head was finally fading but he could still remember the words Josephine had hissed and he was afraid though he didn’t know why.
“You and my dad were good friends? Uncle Sev’ told me that you would have better memories of dad than he did, it’s why he suggested that I write to you” Harry told the man who looked surprised by that and somewhat hurt as he asked;
Once everyone had done as instructed Nino waved her hand and silently cast a spell to send all the stools and tables around the room rearranging them until two tables were grouped together with seats for four. Above each table was the name of the group and without questioning it Harry and Draco made their way to the Sigma table. It was only when the whispers started that Harry realised how strange it must have looked for the others for Nino to not only wandlessly cast a spell but also wordlessly. They had grown immune to it during their lessons but Harry could see how excited it made other people including Chao-Xing and Alice as they joined them.
“The pain in your face and voice tells me otherwise, Harry lad, there that shall do it for now, I will come back in a week and see how you are getting on with that, lad, and then we will see about full days” Tobias hummed with a satisfied hum as Harry’s lower back crunched as for the first time he was stretched out of his slump. “I’ve put some mild pain relief potion on the list but if you need it more than two times a day you are to send for me, do you understand Harry? No pretending that you’re okay, that won’t help anyone, understand?”
With a nervous look around the class, who had all stood up with confusion Harry pushed himself back up of his stool and immediately moved to Draco side. The blonde gripped his hand and threaded their fingers together with a smile before pulling him over to where Chao-Xing and her friend Alice were standing.
“Pleasure to have you both in Ravenclaw.” A girl spoke at last drawing Harry’s attention back to the table while a few more students were being sorted. “I am Penelope Clearwater, prefect of Ravenclaw…”
“But I still wish I knew more” Harry sighed not wanting to be a hassle for the Malfoy’s when they were being so nice to him.
“I thought, I remember every wand I have ever sold Mr Potter-Lupin-Snape, and the feather in this very wand came from a phoenix who gave another, this wand is the brother to the wand that gave you that scar…” The man said and Harry swallowed glad that the wand had had such a reaction to him. He really didn’t want to wave around a wand with that kind of connection. “Dear me, dear me, you are a tricky customer, never fear we shall find the right wand for you, I know that it is here…Ah! One moment!” With a flash the man was gone again leaving the Malfoys and Snapes confused all looking at the wand with dubious expressions. The very real fear of not being able to have a wand was coming back and Harry swallowed waiting for the man to return and say that it was no good. A moment later however he was back with a triumphant expression on his face. “This Mr Potter-Lupin-Snape, is truly one of its kind! The wood you see is a not just one solid piece, it is a mixture, Holly, Yew, Oak, and Elder wood from the heart of the black forest. It is a little experiment of mine, in fact, I had just finished it yesterday…Give it a twirl…” Harry nervously reached out to the wand staring mesmerised at all the colours of the woods that swirling up its length. “The core, Mr Potter-Lupin-Snape, is from a rare white phoenix.” The wand tingled in Harry’s hand and then vibrated his hair stood up and with a wave happy sparks of blue and red fireworks shot around the room. “Yes! Yes! I think we’ve got it! Absolutely fantastic!”
“Yes! La-Narcissa” Harry spluttered over her name his cheeks filled with a rosy red colour his hand nervously moving to his neck only to be caught and held by Draco’s. The blonde boy swung their hands back and forth telling his mother all about the game as they walked back to the beautiful manor Harry’s heart full wondering if he had ever been this happy before.
“Yes, father, accidental magic, I was angry” Draco explained quickly giving his father a tiny smile. Harry hung his head pulling on the front of his t-shirt while shuffling his feet saying;“I’m sorry, it was my fault...”
“Oh, well that’s a nice house too, the Grey Lady is a charming woman, though a little sad. I always said your mother could have been a Ravenclaw. Had the brains of a claw but the heart of a lion like your father. Well, no matter, they would be proud regardless of what house you’re in” Nick moved his hand in what should have been a kind ruffling against his head but of course he couldn’t touch him and the fingers went straight through sending an icy chill down his spine. A bell rang loudly and Fred and George hopped from one foot to the other.
“What?!” Harry and Remus both hissed together looking at the dark-haired man.
“I’m glad I’m here” Harry replied with a little chuckle his arms secure about Draco as they looked up at the ceiling. “There is a real chance I could have died before making it to Hogwarts without you”
“You’re a cute one” Harry chuckled positive that the bird was going to fall asleep on him and he found that he wouldn’t care if she did. A beady eye continued to watch him, and she let out a shrill, irritated noise when he stopped stroking her. “Sorry, sorry. I’ll keep stroking you”
“I sometimes wonder about that” Lily said quietly but not too quietly that the letter didn’t pick it up and Harry found himself almost smiling though there were tears collecting in his eyes and he was holding on tightly to Draco and Narcissa. So tightly that he felt that he might actually crush their hands if he wasn’t careful.
Harry drowned out the following conversation between Draco and Seamus, knowing that it was everything that he had already heard. Both his friends were excited about the upcoming year but Harry was terrified. He had only bad memories of school and school kids and the last year learning at home had been amazing. He had wanted to beg Remus and Severus to let him stay home and continue home education, but Draco was excited about real school and he couldn’t bear to be separated from Draco.
“Well what do you think? You have an eye for fashion my dragon”
“He wrote to me after Harry did. He said the same things to me, and said that as an old friend of his fathers I should be able to convince him to go back where he belonged and that it was for the greater good” Remus muttered somehow managing to keep the growl out of his voice though he could feel the wolf beneath the surface. The wolf had taken a liking to Harry when he had been acting as Greenfield and it had hated the smell of bruises Harry always seemed to have clinging to his body.
“You look very much like your grandmother, the Black hair and the gentle features about your mouth and nose. I was your families healer for many years, in fact I was there at your birth” Tobias told him and Harry swallowed thickly not knowing how to respond. “It is good to see you once more”
“What is your favourite animal, Dad?”
“Harry Potter is happy and healthy with Lucius, Narcissa, and Draco. Draco is instrumental at keeping him happy” Severus answered with complete honestly and Minerva gave a small, pleased nod relaxing into her chair. “My question; What did you know of the abuse Harry had suffered?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You threw mud at my son! You hit him on the head, he has a mark!”
“Not right away. But after knowing you for a while. It wasn’t much of a secret, to be fair, not many Harry’s in the wizarding world, much less with bright green eyes. Plus, we’ve seen your scar once or twice” Both twins answered motioning to Harry’s forehead. His scar was almost always hidden by his thick curly fringe but every now and then he would run his fingers through his hair revealing the scar. He did so now, causing Seamus to suck in a breath.
For half an hour he tried without success while Draco was making steady progress the cold feeling growing stronger and lengthening until it was almost touching the dummy until finally, he let out a whoop of joy. Harry’s eyes flew open and he saw his friend’s doll swaying ever so slightly. Harry’s remained perfectly still but he was happy for his friend. “Did you see Harry?”
“Your lessons for today are cancelled” Nino announced breezily as they entered her small summer house. She threw them both a beautiful purple coloured scarf with the emblem of a hummingbird on the hem. “We’re going to go watch the Hummingbirds play the Celtic Legion”
Draco wonders if he should interrupt or get worried. This wouldn’t be the first time that Harry’s randomly barged in with that look on his face. The night Granger had given him his new owl had resulted in three hours of pacing, with increased mumbling before Draco had to force him to stop. He had sat him down with a cup of tea and began describing the brewing process for his modified version of a Calming Draught. He was just getting to the good part when Harry had interrupted him and spilled the entire Owl Saga.
“Sure, it won’t take long anyway.”
Draco removes the stack from his lap, placing them on the table to his side. He swallows and wipes his hands on his knees. His mother would be appalled with his behavior -
“Yes, I am.”
Suspect # 6 - Draco Malfoy; The Potioneer
“Potter? What are you doing here?” Theo asked as he stumbled to a stop.
“Well, it’s not me.”
Draco doesn’t really know what to say, except - “I like that feeling too.”
“Because either they really see me or I am just that lonely that I have spent weeks reading into something that doesn’t exist,” was what came out of his mouth. Harry froze. That was
“So, do you want to see it?” he asked, interrupting her Potter Spiral.
“After I woke up and went through the usual fuck me for drinking routine, I decided to read whatever I had written. It wasn’t terrible. I was still editing the thing when an owl came in with whatever WF I had been subscribed to. It was an impulsive choice to rewrite the entire thing and submit it but I did it anyway. So that first piece about Theo was posted.”
“Yeah, it mostly is. Aquila’s sick. Some sort of Muggle flu. But I can talk for a couple of minutes?”
“Okay. So it is someone we both know then. I told Hermione I knew this person. But she was convinced that I was just bored and found something new to obsess over. Why does no one ever believe my instincts!”
“I take it Daphne has talked to you then.” Harry sighed and brought out his hastily hidden notepad. Might as well drop the aura of mystery. Damn Daphne and her meddling ways.
“Because. Because they know things and… because I just want to know, okay? I don’t have a good enough reason,” he trailed off.
“Harry, just give me the damned thing,” she interrupts, throwing her hands up in the air.
“I wrote about you because . . . well because I was tired of everyone writing you the wrong way. Really, it started as an annoyance with people refusing to see beyond the Chosen One thing. Then it turned into something else. Harry, I would apologize, but I’m not really sorry. I was careful to mostly skip the real things. But the thing was, once I started writing, I couldn’t stop. It’s just, it was easy to pretend you got everything you deserved when I was writing about it. Because you do deserve everything you want. And I liked writing about you being happy,” Draco sped towards an uncomfortable stop. He was beginning to ramble, the argument had become circular, and really, was it his fault he couldn’t explain why if he didn’t understand it himself?
So, he hunkered down and produced a long-winded letter describing his current predicament, asking for a meeting - with the promise of an all-expenses-paid dinner, and a warning about Astoria’s Dirigible Plums kick.
“Well, for one, I am allergic to raspberries. Second, the way this person writes about the whole process is way too detailed. Which means that either you know them or they have an enviable imagination.”
“Probably. I had some questions I wanted to ask you. Now, I don’t think it’s you but due diligence, right?”
“Pleasure to meet you. Master Black” Blaise said bowing smartly and Harry, remembering the lessons both Narcissa and Lucius had been giving him, responded with a bow of his own.
“How do you do?”
“Like Achilles” Harry laughed rolling his eyes, referring to the largest of Lucius’ prized Peacocks who flounced around the gardens almost always on display, before dutifully taking the first of his daily potions. Severus had tried his best to make them tolerable but there was still a bitter taste to the blood cleansing one. “He was practicing Japanese when I left. He really likes Professor Ninomiya”
“See you later! You’re in my first lesson this morning!” Nino said waving a small chunky hand completely unaware of the tension that seemed to have formed over the three at the arrival if the muggle studies teacher. For his part Quirrell didn’t seem to be aware of it either and Harry felt somewhat guilty for his reaction towards him. The man couldn’t help that he smelt strange, could he? He probably didn’t even know, and it couldn’t be easy to be a teacher with a stutter like that. Resolving to be nicer Harry flashed the man a smile and then hurried over to the Ravenclaw table looking forward to the lessons that he was about to start.
Surprisingly both Lucius and Severus had been understanding of his past when it had been reported but Harry supposed that they knew more than anyone what it was like to be judged by past mistakes and they seemed to want to give him a chance if he could get over his nerves. Harry gave the man a smile inching forward in his chair.
Goblins, Harry thought as they stepped out of the fire and into the grand reception of Gringotts bank, were some of the most interesting creatures he had met in the wizarding world. Lucius had given him a book about them and Harry was surprised to know that although the wizarding world trusted them to look after all their money they were often treated worse than dirt even by people who were considered to be light wizards. In his book it had told him about the various rebellions and Harry agreed with Lucius that there would come a time that there would be another one. His family manager Tormuld met them at the door. He was only a half goblin with less harsh features but he still had the large ears and sharp teeth.

“Shall we head to class”
“Thank-you for coming, Professor, Draco has not stopped talking about you all summer. Thank-you for agreeing to teach Harry as well. You remember Draco’s uncle, Severus Snape. Severus this is Professor Kazumiko Ninomiya”
“Everyone starts with the basics. Now until our next lesson I want you to go over what I showed you today and I am gonna give you a book to read…Let me just find it.” A canvas backpack was at the man’s feet and Harry watched as he reached inside and brought out an A4 sized book. The front cover was wrinkled, and the pages were yellowed but Harry could see that it was some sort of music book. “I brought this when I first started learning, the songs are a bit dated now, but it has all the basics and gives a good description of what we will be learning in the coming weeks.”
“I’m glad you’re feeling better Uncle Severus” Harry smiled hugging the man tightly and burying his face into his neck. The herb and spice mix were stonger there and he breathed it in as Severus awkwardly patted his back.
“You would let me test it?” Remus gasped staring at the man who was staring down at an ant on the floor as if it was the most interesting thing he had ever seen. A faint trace of red was in his cheeks however and Remus felt like smiling.
“That you have less manners than a common pig. When you hurt somebody the first thing you should do is apologise” The blonde growled spitting venom at the twins. Harry stared open mouthed not knowing what to do or say. His cheeks were flaming brightly while his insides felt as though they were churning with a nest of snakes. He could barely draw breath and yet his lungs were hurting, like he had been breathing too hard for a long time. His head was spinning and the looks from the twins was making him want to throw up.
“Testing, testing, a one, a one, two, three…Okay, I guess it’s working and I’m sure you’re already rolling your eyes and telling me to get on with it” James’ voice came through loud and clear and Harry looked at Remus who was indeed rolling his eyes. “So, I’m brown bread, dead, god I hope it was something cool and not getting caught up in one of Sirius’ schemes…Okay, I know that I was just as involved with those schemes but…Cool and Heroic I hope they lined the streets for miles crying as they held my coffin”
“Lord Potter too, he may not have been as bright as his good lady but he had some sense” Severus opened his mouth to protest but instead Lucius handed him over a letter that was yellowed with age. The messy, almost illegible script of his childhood tormentor stared up at him and he wanted to throw it back at his friend but morbid curiosity kept him reading. A clock ticked steadily as Lucius ate his bacon and eggs and, although he would deny it to his death bed, Severus had to swallow a lump from the back of his throat as his eyes moved over the last line. “He was a child Severus, a spoiled rich kid whom had been doted on, we know how they can be...What he did to you was awful, but he has paid the ultimate pric...”
Draco smirked as he watched the muggle trying to speak but only making a low murmuring sound. He always loved watching his father use spells. Lucius Malfoy wasn’t the flashiest of spell casters his movements were always graceful. His slender fingers caressed the silver handle of his wand as his steel grey eyes stared at the muggle who had stepped back against the wall. Harry was looking torn between afraid and excited and Draco could well understand those feelings he was certain that Mrs Figg must have given more information in her letter to his mother than Harry had to him and it must have been bad to send his father into such a state. While his father was staring down the long necked muggle Draco moved forward curious about the cupboard that held Harry’s bedroom.
“Tell mother that Harry is in too much pain from the brace, he can’t walk”
“Thank-you...Um...Sorry...What is your name?” He asked wanting to ask what she was but deciding that that would be very rude. The little creature’s smile grew wider as she pointed at her chest and said;
“Aunt Bella would be just as happy to kill us as them, for not following the dark lord”
“I want to do well at school” He said softly with a shrug and Severus gave him an approving smile squeezing at his shoulder. Harry flushed a little under the gaze and it only got worse when Remus looked just as proud.
“Why don’t they teach the truth about Merlin?” Harry asked when there was a lull in the conversation over dinner. All five of the adults, Nino having come to join them this evening, turned to look at him while only Lucius wiped his mouth with a starched napkin and answered him.
“Muggles? How extraordinary!” Pansy’s eyes seemed to widen as her mouth fell open ever so slightly. “I’ve never even spoken to a muggle”
“Uncle Vernon says that it is a waste of good gold when I am fit enough to carry the bucket and I don’t mind, I like the walk in the mornings.” Harry admitted truthfully as the first row of houses came into view.
“I’m Godric Gryffindor…Apparently, I din’t want to wear it, but me ma’ insisted”
“Excuse me?”
“Some pumpkin spice cake, Harry dear or perhaps some ice cream”
“I dunno, Ares once pooped on my head, I swear he laughed about it, I was almost positive I would never feel clean again” Draco said with a shudder causing Harry to let out a chuckle glad but was glad when the owl moved from his head back down to his shoulder. They made their way down to the breakfast room and found Lucius, Narcissa, and Snape sitting around the table tucking into a healthy breakfast.

“You mean, my betrothed?” Draco soured even further. He had always known that he had been betrothed to Lord and Lady Potter’s son Harry but he had never seen him, in fact, there were rumours that he had died along with his family though the court advisor Albus Dumbledore assured them that Harry was merely in hiding until the ball away from political rivals that might seek to harm him.

“An unforgivable? On top of all your crimes, you used an unforgivable?”
(See the end of the chapter for
I am so very sorry that I dropped off the planet. Honestly I never meant to but I do have a legitimate reason. About a month ago I was rushed into hospital with chest pain. I was having a heart attack they did a bunch of tests and decided it was a one time thing but needed to have another test in a few days. Got to the appointment and it turns our it wasn't a one time thing it was caused by blood clots. They thought at the time it was due to the AstraZeneca vaccine.
“Not as much as I would like. Castiel and Michael are the only two that even write anymore. Though I do keep an eye on them as much as they will let me. Anyway, Harry, you should be going to lunch. Read through the book and I will see you on Friday.” Chuck set about clearing away his things and Harry quietly said goodbye as he put his own guitar in its case and hurried to the dining room the case in one hand and the book tucked under the arm.
“You must be Mr Potter’s uncle, please come join your wife” Lucius said rather calmly pointing his wand at him and although the man paled as he saw it going cross eyed at the tip he remained enraged.
The little bat heard his cry and paused flapping his wings so he could stay hovering above his head. You are Boris the Brave?” It asked startling poor Boris who hadn’t known bats could speak. “Y-Yes, I am Boris…But I’m not Brave! I am a coward!” He said looking at the bat who was now buzzing around his head. It wasn’t how he had imagined it at all. Instead of something dangerous, the bat was rather cute with silky black wings and a fuzzy soft belly.
“You are an omega are you not?” Severus growled his top lip curling before he thrust out three letters. The top one was addressed to him and he stared at it in shock blood bubbling through his ears. He had never gotten a letter before!
“Hey, can you come to every lesson? Snape isn’t so bad with you here”
(See the end of the chapter for
“…So, I already did the main will this is another just for you. Lil’s is doing a will for Snape. Yeah, I know, but Lil’s doesn’t think he’s altogether a bad dude and well you fell in love with the greasy git so he really couldn’t be all bad” Draco sucked in a breath his blue-grey eyes growing into wide discs as he looked from his godfather to Remus and then to Harry who shrugged helplessly “And don’t deny it! I’m dead! You can’t lie to me anymore. Maybe if you’re both there together you can sort yourselves out and maybe give it another go without friends getting in the way I hope so, because well, Lil’s is giving Snape everything so he can make a blood adoption potion. Harry is going to need a new father…Or Two new father’s…Wink, wink, nudge, nudge…And before you ask why you and not Sirius think for a minute. Sirius is great at being the fun uncle, but he is not father material…”
Okay, I was going to make Brighton or Blackpool the place Harry wanted to go but to be Honest Skegness was just funnier for me to imagine the Malfoys going. Skeggy (For anyone that might not know) was/is a popular tourist destination for not rich families, and would have been popular at the time Harry Potter is set, not that the Dursleys would have gone there.
“I’m sure he was just being dramatic on purpose. The rainbow snakes are known for being flamboyant must be hard not having anyone to talk to” Remus chuckled jovially while Severus’ dark eyes moved over the path the snake had taken. “Sevvie, what’s going on in that big brain of yours?”
“Will it hurt Harry?” Narcissa asked cooing ever so gently to the boy who had stopped sobbing but was now sniffing loudly. The neckline of her dress was soaked with the tears he had shed but Narcissa held him just as tightly.
“Yes, they live by the banks of rivers, like the Grindylows they like to pull the unsuspecting traveller into the rivers. But a little politeness goes a long way. If you see a Kappa you bow to it. You see the top of his head? When on land the bowl is filled with water which must remain on its head for it to stay hydrated. If you bow to a Kappa it will always bow back and the water will fall from the bowl. Now, when you have done so you have the advantage and you can then runaway” Remus told him gently his face glowing with excitement as a creature with the head and upper torso of a horse and the tail of a sea serpent swam passed the glass. It was beautiful, if a little eerie, and Harry gasped in delight.
“And yet I’m the one walking with my friends and you appear to be alone.” Draco hummed smoothly motioning to Alice and Chao-Xiang. Ron scowled his face turning red, as he opened his mouth to speak however, he was cut off by Seamus and Pansy coming towards them followed by another Gryffindor Harry vaguely recognised from last night. “Irish, Pants, good to see you.”
“Being of somewhat sound mind hereby decree that this is my last will and testament. All other wills before this one are null and void and so forth. Right that’s the formalities out of the way. I guess if you’re hearing this, I’m dead. Don’t waste time crying about it, I can only hope that it was a good death and that Lily and my son are still alive. On the advice of Dumbledore, we are going into hiding today, there is something about a prophecy and such, I dunno but he said that you-know-who was gonna come after us and yup that isn’t good news, best if we make ourselves scarce and all that. All of my titles and monies go to my wife Lily Potter and to my son Harry James Potter if she is as dead as I am...”
“I need to brush my teeth and wash my face. Do you think I should have spoken to Dad?” Harry asked following Draco to the bathroom and leaving the other boys to look at each other. Harry wasn’t nearly as good at ignoring people as Draco, but he was determined to be better at sticking up for his friend. Draco was going to get a lot of people bullying him just because of who he was. “Do you think he was upset I wasn’t a Slytherin?”

I received a comment telling me that this was too fluffy and that there was no real danger since everyone harry meets are on his side... I want to know if everyone feels that way?
I posted my Fairy Tale story it is called ‘Once upon a time’ I hope that you read it 😊
“Ugn? Well, you stop calling me Potter, we have another shower and then we think about it. Next time though I probably wouldn’t want it in a pretty public shower” Harry answered sheepishly looking around the pretty public space they were indeed in. The words seemed to stir something in Draco who blinked slowly saying; “Next time? So you intend for there to be a next time?”
“I’m sorry”
Urgh...Is this part crap? I’m so sorry >.< I need to explain Dobby and Lucius during the war but this part didn’t want to come out properly >.<
“I was casually speaking with my colleague professor Flitwick, enjoying my morning cup of tea before having to deal with the dunderheaded brats, when Dumbledore came over and asked if he might have a word. He spoke some drivel about Quidditch and the game that is being held. When I finally returned to my tea Filius had gone to his office. I admit that I was careless, I should have checked for additives but I was not expecting to be dosed by my esteemed colleague, almost immediately I found myself agreeing to let him come to Harry” Severus snarled his fingers itching to his wand as he glared at the headmaster who was standing silent but uncowed. His eyes were as sparkling as ever and Harry had to wonder if the man was altogether sane. “We came in through the floo in Lucius’ study, he was already sorting through this mornings mail. He was startled by my appearance and that of Dumbledore and wasn’t quick enough to react before Dumbledore used the Imperious curse…”
“Stop apologising. What were you dreaming about?”
“Oh? And what did that overgrown oaf have to say?” Severus asked with a touch of a growl to his voice. He looked as if he were only moments away from stalking out of the great hall to find the giant of a man and Harry gave a smile touched by his concern.
“Dobby found his way into Harry’s room this morning, will you put a ward over the room Dobby is in please to stop him from getting out? I will get a healer from Saint Mungo’s to see to him as soon as possible” Lucius asked gently sitting back down and Jinx was soon bobbing her head up and down.
“They are holding hands.”
“I haven’t learnt it, didn’t need to, I wasn’t planning on giving old Volde a sponge bath...” Harry sorted at his own joke and to his surprise Draco chuckled along actually washing Harry’s back. His anger from earlier was all but forgotten. He poured some soap onto the sponge and then brought it down onto Harry’s back washing him slowly.
“Maggie, please, I’ve only just gotten him I have no intention of signing him away, now shall we sit and eat?”
“Ow” He moaned rubbing his scar and causing Draco to look at him with worry his pale eyebrows lifted.
“Just that you spend an awful lot of time calling me pretty Blackmore, unfortunately you’re not my type, but thank you.”
“Harry suggested the theatre.” Draco shrugged settling himself into the wingback chair opposite his father. Lucius was still buried behind the paper, but his knuckles were white and he was almost vibrating with the need to say something. “Is there something you would care to say father?”
9916 1713 8172
“No, they won’t. Father has the best lawyers Harry! And he has the truth, Dumbledore looks like he has finally cracked and is starting to show that. He drugged a teacher, used an unforgivable and tried to break into your mind. If you hadn’t been practicing with Uncle Sev’ who knows what he might have gotten you to do” Draco gave a mock shudder but in reality he could still imagine what it had been like to watch what was happening but not be able to do anything. He was glad that Harry hadn’t fallen for the tricks Dumbledore was spewing but it must have been hard on the boy. “Everything will be okay, you’ll see, for now just forget about it and think that you are about to go to your first Quidditch game!”
“Where is Nino meant to be meeting us?” Draco drawled coming over and holding Harry’s hand as they stepped out of the room and joined a throng of muggles heading to the gates of the tower.
“Yes, sir” Harry spoke absently, stepping into a pair of dove grey slippers that Draco had given him. They were warm around his toes and the soles were cushioned making him feel like he was standing on a cloud. He was about to follow Lucius but the blonde stopped taking a soft nightgown from the back of a chair. Lucius helped him into it and then tied it around the front once done he lightly combed his hair with his fingers and then together, they made their way to the door that led out to the large landing. The only light came from the lantern that Lucius was holding and Harry made sure he stayed as close as possible. He wasn’t afraid of the dark, the light in the cupboard under the stairs was often broken, but he felt like an intruder in the house.
“Masters Harrys. Youse is okays?”
“Father is skilled at almost everything he sets his mind on!” Draco enthused happily even if they were being thrashed by his father and mother in their game. He had been amazed when Lucius had come home from the ministry earlier that day, changed into warmer robes with a hat and scarf and announced that they would be having a three-team snowball fight. Snape had some how been convinced to join, though the potion master and werewolf were acting as their back-up. “But we can win this Harry, so long as you still have our flag”
“Malfoy.” The boy spat his voice deeper than Draco’s or Harry’s. Harry didn’t recognise the name Blackmore, but he had a feeling that he had seen this boy somewhere before. “What’s two Ravenclaw’s doing in Slytherin territory? Bet your daddy’s upset that his little princess wasn’t in his house. Well good riddance, everyone knows the Malfoy’s have gone soft…”
“Stop it!” Harry whined grabbing his pillow and slamming it into Draco’s face. Not hard but hard enough to shut up the blonde boy. Draco huffed his hair flopping over his face before his eyebrows narrowed. “Sorry!”
“I-Indeed? H-H-How od-dd…” Quirrell looked at Severus who was watching him with a closed off expression. “Very…Nice…”
“They slept together.”
“She is also the reason you have your heart set on your trip to Japan before going to Hogwarts next year, does my Dragon have his first bloom of love?”
Sorry, is this boring >.< I’ve been so busy the last couple of days but I promise, Ollivanders next and then the train ride to HOGWARTS. It’s time these kids were in school!”
“You told him…”
“I did not say I didn’t approve, in fact I think it is rather clever of you to start a friendship with the young hero of the wizarding world, there maybe some families in our circle that would not agree however I have very pleased with you” Lucius of course would think of what it would do for the Malfoy family and Draco had thought of it as well but in truth he had been bored and interested by Harry and he wanted to see what he was like.
“If you like, but after we have met the Parkinson’s for lunch” Narcissa said halfway through a conversation with Pierre who seemed to be nodding and agreeing with everything she said. Draco had a feeling that by the time they had left Harry would be having enough clothes to fill his walk in wardrobe.
“What…Is that?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Remus risked a sidewise glance at Severus. He had changed little from when he was a child though he had perhaps grown into his nose. He wasn’t attractive in the strictest sense of the word, he never had been, but Remus had always felt a pull towards him. His dark sarcastic humour, his intelligence, and his nibble fingers when he had worked with potions ingredients. When Black had pulled his ‘prank’ and almost killed the dark-haired teen Remus had been mortified, pulling himself away from him terrified of seeing the fear and hate in his face. He wished more than once he had spoken to Severus wanting to explain but he hadn’t and no good came from trying to change the past.
“I have no idea how you can forgive me, but I promise your forgiveness will not be misplaced Harry” The potions master said and Harry hugged him ever more tightly before pulling away and eying the package still on the table.
“Oh I’d love a hot chocolate as well if you don’t mind” Hestia said her eyes still moving around the home as the twin doors opened and they entered a huge welcoming hallway that very much reminded Harry of the big house he school at taken his class too. The walls were lined with huge life sized paintings of people who looked a lot like Draco with blonde hair and grey eyes. They were all posed with stiff backs their hands regally resting on the heads of statues.
Hogwarts was as magnificent as it had been when they had visited with Harry’s father’s and the view from the lake made the rather pointless boat trip worth it. Hagrid kept trying to get Harry’s attention, but his brown-haired friend ignored him talking instead to Pansy and Seamus. The oaf looked upset though Draco cared little. He had no time for people that hurt his Harry and the giant of a man had been the one to deliver his friend to the Dursleys and that was unforgivable in his opinion.
“Perhaps we shall, later, for now though we have an appointment at Master Pierre’s. Will you be joining us Pansy?”
“Sorry, father, but he is so thin!” Draco almost huffed his pale cheeks growing pink while Harry smiled swallowing down the bacon. He was happy his friend cared about him but he had to admit that his stomach was starting to feel painfully full.
“You didn’t Harry, not at all, in fact it is rather nice to talk about them. There’s nobody alive that remembers I had children or a husband, they just think of me as the dotty old cat lady” She chuckled smiling at the locket before putting it back under her clothes. Harry gave her a weak smile scraping his tongue over dry lips before saying gently;
“Yeah…Harry, ready for bed?” Draco asked and Harry nodded his stomach dropping as he realised that he would have to sleep alone. The boys would think it was weird if they shared a bed, and the bed wasn’t big enough for them both. He hadn’t slept alone since being with the Malfoy’s and he didn’t think he could cope with it now. “Which bed should we use? I guess it doesn’t matter, but you like to be near a window so you can see the stars so I suppose we should use this one?” Draco motioned to the bed that had the best view of the large bay window and Harry was aware that they were being watched with bewilderment.
The song Harry sings is Fare thee well or Dink’s song…I really can’t find the original source except that it was likely an African American folk song and is about a woman whose lover had left when she needed him, but the version here is taken from the one that Rob Benedict sang on Supernatural, and his version was beautiful.
Harry winced as he woke to an arm slapping him in the face as Draco wiggled around at his side babbling in his sleep about Chipmunks stealing his chestnuts. Harry smiled at his blonde friend and then noticed Hedwig fluffing out her feathers in an irritated manner. The snowy owls head was bobbing up and down staring pointedly at the window.
“I believe she said she would be near the Chimera enclosure” Lucius answered his top lip curling ever so slightly as he guided Narcissa around a muggle tourist that had stopped moving and was gazing up at the high walls. Harry felt nervous as eyes turned to watch them but soon enough, they were stepping through another door that muggles didn’t seem to see. A bubbly witch, sat in a ticket booth, smiled at them as she waved her wand to count them in taking the money.
“My dear you are babbling a little and confusing the boys” Narcissa hummed gently rolling her bright blue eyes as she took a blueberry muffin from the wicker basket on the table and broke it apart with her fingers before feeding the Pixie birds that were sitting on her shoulder. Harry hadn’t noticed them until now and he gave a smile as a pink bird took a blueberry into its beak.
“Never, they always start out strong but they can never keep the pace. Of course the press will be all over them because they have just signed that Johnson fellow” Magenta said with more confidence as her daughter and Harry looked at the other two adults feeling uncomfortably like a spare part.
“Thank-you, Draco, but...Dumbledore is here, he will try to take me”
“And you…Don’t care?”
In the end I have and although I have a few symptoms still, I am on the road to recovery once again!
(See the end of the chapter for
“I don’t know your source Potter, but they were greatly misinformed. I was engaged to Miss Greengrass, but we decided quite early on that it wasn’t what either of us wanted. And you and the Weaslette…” Draco tried but he really couldn’t stop himself from wrinkling his nose at that. He had never understood the appeal of the freckled girl though he had known that a lot of boys in his Hogwarts days had thought her beautiful. For his part she had reminded him too much of Harry’s mother and that would have been a rather disturbing coupling.
“Pansy dear, where is your mother? I was expecting to see her”
“I am getting to that Draco, please stop interrupting me” Narcissa said quickly but she was smiling at her son to soften the words.
“Of all the creatures you could like, why snakes, Harry?” Draco asked as they were stood in front of a magically sealed enclosure where an emerald green snake was sitting on a rock his eyes fixed on them. It wasn’t that Draco minded, he found it rather amusing that Harry Potter the boy who lived liked snakes which was the animal of Slytherin house. Harry shifted uncomfortably his cheeks flushing in an adorable way while he cast nervous eyes around making sure nobody could hear them as he whispered;
A loud howl sounded from their left-hand side and Remus stiffened just a little his face going pale now. Harry looked to see where the howl had come from and gulped when he saw a huge grey and white wolf with black markings around its blue eyes staring at them as they walked. He didn’t understand wolf, but he didn’t need to, to know that it was warning the werewolf to stay away. Harry moved closer to Remus and took his hand giving it a gentle squeeze which was returned almost immediately.
“We shall need to go to the hall of records and see what the so called prophecy is and then I will have this  letter checked by Flitwick to have him confirm it has not been tampered with and then we hand it over with our evidence to the ministry” Lucius answered softly. The legal way was slower than what he was used to but at least he would have Harry safely away from Dumbledore. “This at least will confirm that neither Lord nor Lady Potter wanted Dumbledore near their son. Have no fear my heart Harry will be staying with us”
“You did, but clearly I didn’t listen” Remus stuck out his tongue in a childish manner and then turned to look at Harry with his light brown eyebrows lifted on his forehead. “What did you want to speak to us about, Harry?”
“Yes, Aunt Petunia” Harry said bobbing his head before going to the pantry and getting the sack of potatoes. While he was carrying them back to the kitchen he didn’t notice Dudley’s foot until it was too late and he was falling forward his face smacking into the cupboard the potatoes going everywhere. The noise was enough to bring Aunt Petunia coming back into the kitchen shouting;
I’m alive! And back…Seriously I am so so sorry for being away for so long. Covid-19 is not a joke guys, it is absolutely awful, and I was one of the lucky ones. I have scaring on my lungs and am still recovering. It’s slow but I’m getting there, they still aren't sure of the long term damage but my doctor and nurses were absolutely amazing. Please listen to the advice being given and stay safe.
“Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, at your service, sir” The ghost bowed and Harry gasped as his head slid from his shoulders almost coming completely away until it caught on a flap of skin which had clearly given the ghost his moniker as Nearly Headless. “I am the resident ghost of Gryffindor tower”
“Here you go” Remus said taking the coins from his wallet and handing them over with a friendly smile. Robertson latched on to the smile gratefully though Harry could see that he was seriously trying to work out how somebody as friendly as Remus was with Severus who was scowling like he was about to set both the ice cream cart and seller alight with his mind. “Come on, Severus, Harry, the Kelpies await” Remus chuckled licking his ice cream and guiding them away from the relieved looking Robertson and Severus let out a long breath.
“Harry dear, it is quite all right, it was an accident and nothing that can’t be cleaned with a little bit of magic” Narcissa said gracefully dropping to her knees in front of him and taking his hands in her own. She coaxed him to look at her and Draco watched the scene with an awkward ache in his chest. He had made so much mess that the elves often refused to clean it out of protest until he was made to apologise but he had never been so frightened of the consequences that he trembled the way that Harry did. He looked to his father but Lucius was looking out of the window his hands behind his back. His back was rigid but Draco was positive that the man was shaking with anger he could feel it pulsating off of him.
“We had help…A boy…The very boy the Dark Lord sought to destroy. He is ours now, he believes we are his friends…Dumbledore the old fool left him with muggles…Left him alone and abused…We used Draco to get close to him, encouraged him to write letters to be ‘Friends’ with him. He was so abused that he leapt on Draco...It was so delightfully pathetic” Narcissa wept inside hating herself for the words that were leaving her mouth. Harry would never know what she had said about him but she would never forget and it cut her deep. “He would follow Draco to the Dark Lord himself…”
“Harry?” A voice called out as a door opened throwing some light into the room. A tall figure in a grey bathrobe was almost visible against the light and Harry blinked fumbling around for his glasses as he apologised as quickly as he could. His heart pounded against his ribs as he thought of the times he had woken the Dursley’s with his bad dreams and the way they had reacted. Dudley had called him a baby, Vernon had said he would give him something to scream about and had used the belt. It had done nothing for his dreams but make them worse.
“You’re more than welcome, now go, Draco is simply dying to show off and have you fly with him” Lucius waved him away and Harry let the broom slowly moved upwards towards his blonde friend. It felt like nothing he had ever done before; it was so easy and yet there was a certain amount of focus needed to turn the broom. The wind through his hair and over his face felt so natural so right that he had the feeling that now he was up here he would never want to be on the ground again.
“Harry! I wish we could spend longer together! But I am sure that we will see each other again soon!” The girl said hugging him tightly and swaying him from side to side. Harry patted her back a few times but was very relieved when Draco pulled her off him.
“What has you so tickled Harry? Something you can share?”
“Jealous Malfoy?”
“Nopes not yets but we knows he is being looked after, Little Master, he won’t worries youse again”
“I can see them, what are they for?”
“Just half a cup of tea if you will” Tobias said with a smile popping on a pair of glasses before pulling out a w long thin wand which had an ornate decoration of roses swirled around the handle and up to the tip. It was much more delicate than he would have expected from the man. “I have always liked roses, they are delicate but tough, rather like you have had to be, okay, Harry, I’m going to cast a little spell on you, now don’t worry it is quite painless, just a little tickle, are you ready?”
“Tell me what Draco? Are we having fun? Mr Grub and Mr Thomas, you seem to have had a little accident, please allow me to clean you off and perhaps we should talk to your father. My wife was rather fond of that vase after all” Lucius appeared like a spectre his words icy, the smile on his face as dangerous as a snakes as he looked at the two boys who had paled even more dramatically at the appearance of the Malfoy lord.
“Yes, mother” Draco gave a little glance to his maid and then his own reflection before allowing himself to be led out of the room.
“It is true, brat, it wasn’t my place to tell you”
“You need not convince me, Lucius, you get me a way to get into Azkaban I will talk with Bella”
“Dragon…” Narcissa whispered reaching out to clutch at his hand as Lucius rose from his chair and swept out of the room without another word spoken. Perhaps he had been too harsh, but Lucius had been cutting from the moment the first article appeared in the paper and Draco had had enough.
“Okay, next question, what is your favourite food? Mine’s butterscotch and whiskey sauce drizzled over creamy ice cream!” Alice’s eyes were practically sparkling as she spoke about the ice cream and Harry had the strangest desire to eat it himself.
“I need to speak with Lupin privately, but I would be happy to be your father, Harry” The words were gently said and Harry felt his eyes burn with happy tears before he jerked forward and wrapped his arms around his neck breathing in the spicy scent of potions. Severus was still against him for a moment before he relaxed and gave him an awkward hug his large hooked nose pressing awkwardly into his neck. The sound of Jinx blowing her nose into her pillowcase broke the moment and Harry gave a little laugh aware that his own eyes were suspiciously damp as he pulled away from Severus. He was genuinely surprised to see that Severus was looking a little flushed with emotion and although he was not tearing up his eyes were shinier than they normally were. “The potion is simple enough and thanks to your mother I have all I need. I could have it ready by this weekend. However, I do believe that Remus and I should speak before then”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You are correct as always, Pansy, Harry’s true first name is Perseus but he was brought up in the muggle world and Harrison was better fit”
“I don’t take as long as Draco, he takes hours.” Pansy said even as she was getting down from the bed and making her way back through the door to her room, which was Draco’s, not that he used it anymore.
“Yup, just thinking. We should head to the study” He answered happily and Draco nodded taking his hand and leading him out of the room leaving the three adults to chuckle fondly. As the door closed Harry was sure that he heard Narcissa say something about ‘inseparable’ and ‘cute’.
“Take care of yourself, we will write every day if you want.”
“Very good, I knew she would like you” Narcissa chuckled clapping her hands together causing Harry to look from the bird to the woman standing with her back to the fire. She was wearing a two piece outfit of soft blue tweed with a lighter blue top that was finished at the neck with a beautiful butterfly brooch. “This is the owl we said you could have. The Malfoy’s have always favoured eagle owls but last year a snowy owl found her way into our owl house. We left her free to do as she pleased and she ended up laying several eggs but only one of the chicks survived against all odds. She is a fighter like you, perhaps you are the reason her mama came here, we were going to sell her but I think she will be  much happier with you”
“Gryffindor!”
“Not one for Quidditch Harry?” Thesidious asked with a knowing smile and Harry gave him a shrug saying honestly;
“Hope you weren’t expecting a gift, you get enough out of us just living here...”
“Sorry doesn’t tell me where you were boy”
“Did the Witch learn to love herself?” Harry asked breathlessly his eyes shining as he listened to the tale. Earlier during the ritual, they had touched on the old legends but it had mostly been in Latin and although he was improving it didn’t often feel fast enough to learn everything there was to know.
For the most part everyone else is in the same houses otherwise…>.<
“It’s no trouble at all, Harry dear, you are family and Blacks take care of family” Narcissa said with a gentle smile caressing his cheek in a way that she often did when he had bumped his knee or was being awkward. Harry blinked slowly again his green eyes shining with something close to happiness. “You must be brave Harry and remember we will be with you all the time”
“I accept Severus Tobias Snape and Remus John Lupin as my fathers” Harry announced swallowing nervously as Lucius held up the goblet and presented it to him.
“Are you still sulking about?” Severus’ voice jerked him out of his thoughts and Draco turned away from the fountain he had stopped watching awhile ago.
“Out on the north field one of the Pimpled Pugskins have a case of the yellow spot. He will be back soon, how are you, Harry?”
“Who would be stupid enough to try and break into Gringotts?”
“Well if Harry is in Ravenclaw that is where I will be! I refuse to be in any house without him. However, we get sorted…We will be together, right Harry?”
“The will is exactly as it should be Albus. As for Lily’s spell woven into the paper completely fine and above board. It is her magical signature, I have no doubt about that. I would recognise it anywhere. She had a head for spell crafting. I had often hoped she would study for her mastery...” Filius blinked and then blew his overly large nose overcome with grief for a moment. He pushed is large poker dotted handkerchief back into his pocket and gave a watery smile. “In my opinion everything should be fine”
“Well this is Septimius Malfoy” Harry hummed thoughtfully peering at the statue that was holding a scroll and had a large nose that seemed to be almost comical in relation to the rest of his face. He was wearing a toga but it didn’t seem to leave much to the imagination. Almost all the statues were in various stages of undress but this one had some seriously perky nipples that, like his nose, were too big. “So, we have to go back to the right opening and go through until we find the Gemini twins, they are pointing the way to the fountain”
“Dray don’t be a brat. Sorry, Seamus just ignore him” Harry said as the twins and Pansy laughed at the look that was floating over Seamus face. At Harry’s words Seamus relaxed. Draco let out a laugh of his own.
“Perhaps not but who am I to disallow the son of two Marauders to perhaps cause some havoc in the walls of Hogwarts?” Severus allowed his lips to curl into a smile his own eyes closing as Remus let out a bark of laughter.
“Are you ready?” Severus asked as they came back into the room and both boys nodded happily matching grins on their faces. “Very well, Harry, you will come with me and Draco can travel with Remus. We will go to my quarters”
The summer king laughed at her and her perceived notions of beauty. To him his spring bride was as beautiful as ever, he said the light in her eyes would never dim, the joy in her heart would always be there. Age did not remove the beauty of her soul and he kissed the bride twice on the lips, his hand caressing her cheek. The beauty that the spring held was in the simple joy of living. The spring bride proved the goodness of her heart by forgiving the witch of winter with her last breath. The witch screamed at the death, the sound so anguished that it broke the ice covering the world and ended the winter spring coming once more. With the first appearance of the flower the Bride awoke. She and the winter witch, became close friends. They share the well on Orkney, the bride drinks in the spring and the witch drinks in the winter”
“I’ll come with. Might see if Pants and Irish are about.” Draco got up from the bed and stretched in a cat like manner with his arms lifted above his head before he dragged his fingers through his hair. They were just making their way out the door when Pointer muttered,
“Beyond my own experiences with an abusive parental figure you mean. I have been reading a great many muggle medical books in childhood mental health” Severus admitted his sallow cheeks burning brightly at the admission. Remus had no doubt that his eyes would be full of love for the man in this moment. How anyone could miss the loving nature the man possessed was beyond him. “The wizarding world is sadly lacking. I never had much of a childhood myself, I was expected to be an adult too soon, like Harry, I feared that if I didn’t research I would not be able to help in the way that he needed”
“Yes!”
“Don’t be, yes there is a great deal of school rivalry between the houses but all the houses have their good points...” Lucius told him calmly a knowing look coming to his pale grey eyes and Harry couldn’t help but ask;
“Is he the king?”
“No, mistake my dear boy! You are Harry James Potter. Only son of Lord James Fleamont Potter, Lord of the Village of Privet and surrounding counties” The old man, Boy was guessing was Dumbledore said brightly with a happy grin never leaving his face. “And betrothed to Prince Malfoy”
“It feels amazing.” Draco said pleased as punch that he had gotten his wand so quickly. He did a few more flicks and lights danced merrily while Harry felt both Remus and Severus’s hands coming to rest on either of his shoulders.
“Are you sure, Severus?”
“I can’t help it if you were attracted to my animal magnetism, Potter”
“No, I’m sorry, Luc’ I should have asked for more…”
“And what did you do to your house elf, Lucius? Did you kill it? It would be the first…”
“No, I would very much like you to be here with me for this Harry” He said his finger lightly running over his name in the delicate script of Lily Potter. At the touch the letter jerked and shuddered in much the same way  it had at the bank and Harry watched as lips formed in the page.
“Yes, this is Perseus Harrison Black. Harry this gentleman is Pansy’s father Thesidious Parkinson. He attended Hogwarts with Lucius”
“You should have seen the cuffuffle at Hogwarts the other day!” The twin on the left said in a sing songed as they waited for the green flame. Harry went stiff and Draco moved closer taking his hand and ignoring the looks that the twins gave at the action. “Auors, the minister of magic, and Lucius Malfoy came sweeping into the great hall and informed everyone that Albus Dumbledore was no longer headmaster. His office was cleared, Hagrid…The grounds keeper was bellowing that it was a trick by you know who and that Lucius was in league with the devil. Thought he was gonna be carted off until Flitwick told him to shut up. Which is really funny cause Flitwick is really tiny and Hagrid is like half giant or something. Nobody knows what it was all about…”
“Forgiven him? And what to they have to forgive him for?” Lucius growled speaking for the first time as he moved to stand at Harry’s side his hand coming to gently rest on his shoulder stopping Harry from clawing at his neck. Harry didn’t know if it was intentional or not but somehow it was calming. “Those muggles you put him with had him sleeping in a cupboard Dumbledore”
“Aunt Cissy, are you okay? Moony said you had a headache”
“I know, Pops” He sighed trying to smile but failing. His mind healer had been able to explain why he was so scared of something that should have brought excitement. It was hard to step out of the comfortable, warm bubble that had been created in manor. That he was afraid that if he left then he wouldn’t be able to go back and that he would end up going back to the Dursley’s.
“Not if you can’t see them, Moony” Harry shook his head quickly causing Remus to smile “Do they have snakes?”
“Okay, Lily made sure of it…You can't see but I’m sticking my tongue out…Another thing. Watch Dumbledore. I have no idea what it is but Lily has a bee in her bonnet about him and I have to admit he’s been putting the willies up me a bit. It’s the way he keeps looking at Harry…Like he’s not seeing a baby…Speaking of which, here’s Harry, say hello to moony Harry”
“Yes, but that is because he is an idiot, I am not. I have been developing a similar potion myself and I believe that it will work, however I have not had a werewolf to test it on”
Harry woke early on Saturday morning with his heart lodged in the back of his throat. Severus had sent an owl telling him that the potion was ready late last night, and it had taken him hours to sleep. He didn’t know why he was so excited when he logically knew nothing would physically change but for some reason, he felt a giddiness inside of him. He had spent the last three days getting to know Remus as a person and found that he liked the werewolf immensely. He was quiet but highly intelligent and had a vast knowledge of dark creatures. He told him about Wendigos, Kelpies, and Vanir always making sure he told him how to defeat them.
Severus barely spared a glance up from his potions journal when he heard the portrait to his private quarters opening and closing. He had situated himself in front of the fire his robe removed as he relaxed. There were only three people that could access his rooms uninvited. Himself, Remus, and Harry and since Remus was currently on a mission of sorts with Lucius, trying to find out more about the horcruxes, it had to be Harry. Sure, enough his son and godson were soon walking into the small living room giving him a smile. The smiles came more readily these days and Severus couldn’t help but return it before finishing the article he had been reading and closing the magazine.
“The...Do they have snakes? I’ve always liked snakes...”
“Draco?”
“A long-time” Remus muttered sadly, a potion like that would be an amazing thing, he would like nothing more than to be able to keep his mind during transformations. Severus let out a scoffing noise, Remus remembered the noise from when they were young, it was the sound the slytherin let out whenever he thought the rest of the world was being slow and stupid on purpose.
“Remus, are you okay?” Harry asked when the Malfoy’s and Severus had left them alone in the lunchroom. The man was looking at the empty table with an unreadable expression on his face his fingers curled into balls. He had barely eaten anything at lunch and Harry sensed that he felt uncomfortable.
“Rocky please inform Minister Fudge that he is required immediately” Lucius said to the ancient house elf that was wearing a smart black and white pillow case. There was a crest on the front in silver and green silk and Harry recognised it as being he same symbol as one they had passed on the stairs when they had left the beautiful flower room. The elf bowed low and then clicked his fingers vanishing with a crack causing Harry to jump.
“Because…He said that I must have cheated on my homework because all the answers were the same as Dudley. Dudley had copied mine, I didn’t cheat” He growled, it had been the last time he had truly tried on a piece of homework. Until then he had foolishly believed that if he got good grades the Dursley’s might like him. It had only gotten him into more trouble, more so when the teacher had accused him of turning the wig blue though he had no way of proving it was him.
“Only if you are”
“It’s okay, he’s cute, like a doll, or he would be without those hideous glasses. Mummy thought for sure it would be your Father’s bastard, its so much easier for a man to hide such a thing. Mummy says she never suspected that Narcissa was pregnant but it’s clear he’s a black” Pansy rambled in the same way she always did when she was amongst friends and family. There was no harm in it but Draco hated the thought of anyone thinking bad about his mother.
“What do I think about the Plums? I’d rather not say.”
Draco swallows uncomfortably as he shuffles through the pages. He did not think that his friends would find his WixFic name; he especially did not expect Harry to find it. Even more for him to have subscribed to everything he wrote.
The truth was complicated for him. It had always been that way. Most people didn’t care about it unless it was telling them something they did not want to hear. Harry had learned early on that truth-telling would only get him in trouble. A horrible thing to learn, and even harder to put into practice. He was honest to a fault (when he wasn’t clouded by tunnel vision).  So he learned to tell people the truth in a way they wanted to hear it. And as an adult, he had perfected the technique.
. . .
Six years later, he was now running (quite successfully, in Harry’s opinion) an art therapy program, that catered to both magical and non-magical folk, with Dean Thomas.
Draco shakes his head, steeling himself before he looks at Harry’s face.
“Why?”
“My notes? On who the writer could be? You see, I’ve narrowed it down to someone from Slytherin. The amount of detail that went into describing the “atmosphere of the common room”. And the way they wrote that one piece on Nott. Speaking of which, I haven’t-”
Harry would rather sit through a 5-hour lecture by Professor Binns on the highlights of the impact of fashion on the Goblin Wars than try to arrange a meeting with Pansy Parkinson. But he needed to know, so he had no other choice than to get Ron to do it.
To which he received the following:
“Okay, I get where you were going with other people. But Draco, you wrote about me. You are still writing about me. Why?”
“She did. You know it’s not me. And I even have proof,” she said triumphantly, pulling out this week’s work from QAT. “I have never seen you make jam.”
“Not much. Between the studio and Aquilla, I don’t really have much time for authoring or whatever. Besides, I’ve never been one for reading. I much prefer visual mediums, as should be fairly obvious,” he concluded, casting a careless hand out at the room surrounding them.
Suspect #2 - Astoria Greengrass; The Life Coach
He had been one of the first people she had taken on as a client. And at the time, it had been an important step in unifying the public. A business relationship between a War Hero and a member of Slytherin House had done wonders in public perceptions of her Housemates. But, as time went on she sometimes questioned the wisdom of taking on such an endeavor. To be fair, most of her work with Potter was quite straightforward. The usual contentions with the Wizarding Press Corps, event scheduling, charity management, and so forth.
“Dumbledore sent you? I had imagined that he would send you earlier”
“Everyone knows what time of year they would like to be married, Lucius, you knew before you asked me, if I recall”
“You cannot change the past Severus, my dear friend, I know that as much as you, but we can both work to be better. Know that in her final moments she was still your friend” Lucius clasped him tightly on his shoulder his grey eyes warmer than they normally seemed and Severus managed a smile nodding his head. He had given the photo of himself and Lily to Harry who had happily taken it to show Draco before putting it in his bedroom when he had been sent to bed.
Harry laughed as he and his group of friends played the many party games that had been put out for the children. Bobbing for apples was a little different in the wizarding world as the apples tended to bob and fly around their heads and they had to jump to catch them. Fred seemed to be the better twin at the game though George wasn’t a slouch either. Draco and Harry had teamed up with Harry, still being the smallest and lightest, sitting on Draco’s shoulders which had prompted Pansy and Seamus to do the same. That had turned into a game of balance where Pansy and Harry were playfully trying to push and shove each other out of the way to get the best apples. When neither of the teams had wanted to give up Jinx had appeared to scold them for being so reckless. They had played find the cat’s tail after and then trick or treat. Trick or Treat was a fun game involving a tree stump with a dozen and one opening. They each had to put in a hand and see if they could pull out the treat. Pansy had shrieked when she had pulled out a spider until she had realised that it was a gummy sweet. Harry had pulled out a slug and thrown it at Fred who had carefully pushed it back into the stump.
“She is first cousin to the queen” Draco shrugged slowly leading him through the gate while Pansy reluctantly let him go. “Most pureblood families are related”
Can the person who keeps leaving me nasty messages please kindly take a hop, skip and a jump out of my comment section? I know you’re a troll with copy and paste but yeah please go away and read something you do like? Thank you 😊
“Harry! Watch this!” Draco called flying up before slowly jerking his broom downwards to create a zigzagging effect as he moved towards the ground. Harry focused himself and then copied the movement laughing with joy as he did so. “Try and catch me!” Draco zoomed off towards the colourful hoops that reminded Harry of the bubble blowers children played with and lowered his body and followed suit. Draco had more experience on the broom but Harry was smaller, lighter, and it wasn’t long before he could press his fingertips on the blondes back.
“Nones of the elven survived. It sents them insane” Jinx shuddered violently her large eyes filling with tears and Remus immediately apologised to the elf.
“I know, but you can’t blame me for worrying more so as you are so close to Hogwarts”
“He enjoys what he does. Did you ever personally know him at Hogwarts?”
“Severus…I…” Whatever Remus may have been about to say was stalled by Harry and then Draco falling into the room through the floo, they were followed quickly by the Weasley twins, Pansy, and Nino and a man they didn’t know.
I have a question…A small one that won’t really affect the story until later, but I have been playing around with the idea in my head…I have Chuck in the story from Supernatural and I am thinking of bringing Dean, Castiel, Sam and basically a bunch of others as exchange students. I have a whole plot thought out that Bobby is the head of the American school and instead of a frankly stupidly risky way of bringing the schools together in the Triwizard cup they do an exchange programme…Honestly having the characters wouldn’t change anything it would just give me a chance to show my love for Dean/Cas and maybe help my Chuck reconnect with his son…Anywho as I say it won’t matter would just love your opinion…
“Fond? You’ve practically stolen him Harry, he follows you as soon as he sees you in the garden.” Draco laughed and Harry grinned thinking about the Peacock he had taken to calling Francis. The bird was the youngest of the Malfoy peacocks and had taken a special interest in Harry loving nothing more than to sit with him having his neck stroked. “I have an owl, Ares, my family has a lot of animals though I wouldn’t call them pets really.”
“I trust you. But I couldn’t afford...”
On the Second day of Christmas my true love gave to me...
“I get too sick, plus I like the feeling of being on a broom, and I wasn’t alone, my fiancé was with me. We made a holiday of it...At least when he wasn’t covering Quidditch games”
“That is something only romantics and poachers believe, Lupin, the feathers of a Pegasus are fragile and not much use in anything. There is only one potion where they will work and that is to soothe colic in babies” Severus said drily his eyes rolling in a fond way “If you are to be writing a book on magical creatures be sure to get it correct”
“The true Chimera died out along with the Greeks. They have the head of a lion, the tail of a snake and the middle of a goat. The creatures here today are creatures of alchemy. There is only one wizard in the entirety of the wizarding world that has managed to successfully create them. Nicholas Flamel” Severus answered pointing to a sign that depicted a brightly coloured painting of the creature he had just described along with a blurb about Nicholas Flamel with a picture of the man himself. Like most pictures in the wizarding world this one moved giving a wink and a bow. He was an extremely old looking man with watery grey eyes and less hair on his head than he had on his chin, however his smile was bright and cheerful and there was a mischievous sparkle in his eyes that made them seem younger than the rest of him.
“Books next?” Pansy asked linking her arms with both Harry and Draco guiding them towards Flourish and Blotts. They entered without fuss glad to find that it was almost completely empty so they could grab the books they needed quickly. It didn’t mean that they could get out of the shop quickly though as Harry spent a long while looking at the charms and potions books, so much so that even Severus and Remus were urging him to finish.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I wasn’t going to, he would rather chew his own arm off than court you” Hermione laughed airily “Even if the Malfoy’s have changed sides or whatever, they are still into the whole pure blood thing and I can’t imagine Draco raising birds like Colly birds or turtle doves, can you?”
“Crow” The girl said with a jerk of the head her lips thin lines before the pair let out laughs and then moved forward. “It’s been a long time Crow”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of course, how else could I bore you? Are you not going to introduce me to your friend?” She said grinning at Harry as she looked down on him. Like Draco she was taller than he was and Harry tried to stretch out his back wanting to appear taller as Draco gave an apologetic smile.
