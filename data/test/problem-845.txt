“Five points from Gryffindor for being nosey!” Draco called from Harry’s room. Harry rolled his eyes.
“Harry, I think he’s going to kill you today,” she whispered, taking Harry’s hands. “Are you sure you want to marry him?”
Draco cupped his face. “I would never. Now, what do you need?” He asked, leaning forward and kissed Harry gently.
Before Minerva could even bother to open her mouth, the door to her office slammed open once again, this time a potions professor marched his way into the office.
“I was going to ask you tomorrow when we had our own little Easter dinner and then your parents kept asking us about marriage and-fuck Draco, I just want to marry you and if we’re married we can share quarters at Hogwarts and I can hold you all night and Draco, I want to spend the rest of my life with you,” Harry said, taking Draco’s hands in his.
Harry grinned. “He’s absolutely infuriating. More than anything, I love that moody git. Even when he scares me more than Voldemort ever did.”
“Yes,” he said, a scowl now on his face as well. “A stupid little lion that was crying. She’s mean.”
“And he’s sitting happily in Hufflepuff where he belongs, the boy wouldn’t survive in Slytherin, I’m still unsure as to how he survives with Pansy as his mother,” Harry stated. While everyone in all of Hogwarts were sure that Harry and Draco absolutely hated each other, that wasn’t entirely true. While in front of the students and faculty, Harry and Draco were enemies, in the private rooms of their offices, the two had actually become wonderful friends. Neither were absolutely positive how it had happened, Harry reckoned it started when Draco had run into Harry when the Gryffindor was moving into his quarters, and for the first time since eighth year, saw one another. Draco had awkwardly helped Harry pick up his box that he had spilt and walked with him to his new living quarters.
“Aside from that, we haven’t had a real conversation about marriage, but, I’ll be honest. Draco could ask me at any time and I would say yes. I would love to be married to Draco for the rest of my life and I think right now we’re just comfortable with one another and that’s all that matters.”
“Let me finish, Potter,” Draco said patiently. “It’s a potion where if you drink it, slugs come out of both ends. It was actually inspired by that little botched slug spell you attempted to cast our second year of Hogwarts, Weasley.”
“Five points to Gryffindor for helping out your fellow student,” he said, winking at Aaron. Once the little girl was calmed down, Harry walked the two Gryffindors back to their rooms before he returned to his own where Draco was already fast asleep. Harry smiled before he climbed into bed with him and kissed the side of the Slytherin’s head softly. Hopefully they wouldn’t wake up being the topic of everyone’s discussion.
“He cast a stinging hex! It wasn’t even his partner that he cast it on!” Harry said, smacking his boyfriend’s hands away from him. “Why are you being grumpy?” He demanded.
“Of course, Molly would stop hinting at me that I needed to get back together with Ginny, Ron and Hermione would stop trying to hook me up with random Ministry friends, and best of all, I’d have you in my bed. I’d say it wouldn’t be too horrible,” Harry finished, kicking his feet up onto the couch. Draco came around his desk and walked towards Harry before he looked down at him.
“I told you, Potter, Slytherins are winning the Cup this year. You and your cowardly Gryffindors are getting far too cocky, and the Slytherins deserve to prove that we are in fact the superior house,” the lanky man said with a sniff.
“Well, I reckon, I don’t know.” Harry scratched at his head. “I think- I want to take some time to find myself. My entire life I’ve been told I needed to defeat Voldemort, but after that, I wasn’t really left with any real direction.”
Potter nodded and stirred a spoon around in his tea. The silence was nearly deafening as they sat there. Draco had no idea what to say, every single thing he had to say to Potter was suddenly out the window as soon as he cast a glance on the unruly black hair that he had once loved so much. Not that he had ever let Potter know, of course.
“Has she forgiven her son for getting sorted into Hufflepuff yet?” Harry asked, thinking about the poor eleven year old boy who was still getting howlers from his mother. His twin sister, on the other hand, was sitting very happily in Slytherin, just how their mother wanted.
“Mine, I don’t trust anything you try to give me to drink,” Harry said with a sigh. “Although, I will warn you, I have a boggart hiding in my room at the moment and I’m still not entirely for sure where it’s at.”
“Would you even believe me if I told you no?” He asked, coming up and picking up the stuffed Ferret. “Aw, Malfoy, it looks just like you,” Harry cooed.
Draco raised his eyebrows confused before it hit him. “Oh, no! I slipped a potion in his pumpkin juice that had slugs coming out of both ends. You only try to scare a potions master once.”
“You’d want me in your bed? Is that right?” He asked and Harry gave him a sly smile. “Where did you get this confidence?”
Ginny coughed. “Well, I think I’m going to go play some quidditch, you all have fun,” she said and kissed Luna’s cheek before she fled.
“What’d you mention-Malfoy?” Ron said, looking at the two men sitting uncomfortably close to one another on Harry’s couch. Draco coughed and rapidly stood up.
With that, Bella pulled a typical Malfoy move and dramatically left the café and apparated somewhere else. Draco presumed she went to the manor to blow off steam to her grandmother, something the girl did often.
“If you let that unruly mess of hair out of that bun I will slip a potion in your food that will have slugs coming out of both ends, do you understand me?” Draco hissed and Harry let out a slight whimper.
“Well of course it does, it could be one of the reasons why Harry has been so happy these last few years,” Hermione reasoned, taking a sip of her firewhiskey.
Potter reached into his hoodie and pulled out a small black box. “This was supposed to be yours nineteen years ago.”
“You, Malfoy, are a  liar, a fantastical, insane, liar,” Harry said between kisses. “But, I agree. Dress me up and you come with me to the Weasleys’ house for Easter lunch.”
“Ronald! Rose is trying to sleep!” Hermione shouted from another room. Harry grimaced and leaned back from the fire call, scared that Ron would reach through and strangle him.
“If you say so, now what exactly are you doing?” Harry asked. “I’ll just get you back and take twenty points from Parkinson’s kid tomorrow.”
Draco pursed his lips for a moment. “I think I can handle that,” he said. He gave Harry a soft kiss just as someone knocked on the door to Harry’s quarters. “I’ve got it,” he said and kissed Harry again before he climbed off of Harry’s bed and answered the door.
“Well, don’t worry, nothing is going to happen between Draco and I. He’s definitely not interested.” Harry sat across from the two and crossed his legs.
“Draco, I know for a fact that you do not have any work to do, you finished it last night after yelling at me for not grading those stupid defense papers,” Harry said, flicking Draco’s nose. “And we aren’t going to your parents’ house until later this evening for dinner. Which means we are having lunch at the Weasley’s. Together.”
“Did you bring that husband of yours with you?” Lucius inquired. Draco nodded, unable to speak. “Good, bring him in. I want to have a word with him. And you, son, go to your mother and console her. She is devasted, you wore such a frilly dress.”
After the meal the beggar took his guitar and hummed, seemingly lost in thought. Draco took the time to look at his husband properly for the first time. His gaze glided over the ragged clothes that suggested a well-fed and strong body underneath.
Suddenly the streets became loud. Horse hooves thundered on the pavement. People jumped apart as a wild knight galloped on his horse right across the market and towards the pottery stall.
The beautifully painted ceramic vase, a gift from the eastern continents ambassador, shattered into a thousand white and blue pieces. King Lucius was quite fond of that vase. Maybe the splinters could be used in a mosaic. It would be a shame to waste the beautiful ceramic.
“You’re flouncing your leg and it’s bloody annoying. I can’t concentrate, when you do that.” Malfoy looked pointedly on Harrys lap. Harry followed his gaze and truly, his leg bounced with increasing speed.
Just what was Potters objective? Why was he suddenly interested in Draco? The blonde had a very bad feeling about it all. That definitely wasn’t the last he had seen of the stubborn Gryffindor.
As much as Ron admired the courage of his king and friend, he thought he was being too stubborn. Could love make Harry really that blind?
Slowly, the blond prince's lips formed a smile. "That's good, because you can't get rid of me. We are married, after all."
Harry looked at his friend seriously. "He's in the little hut where we used to hide from Voldemort. I want to let him live in poverty for a while longer, then he'll forget his bad habits. As a prince he was too much pampered. The way he is now, he does not make a good partner for me. But I want to give him a chance. I love him very much."
“Harry, you’re rambling”, Ron said amused. “I’m not sure, I really want you to realize this, because it’s Malfoy. But you can’t help what you feel and who you have feelings for, right? So, Harry. Have you noticed, you know very much about Malfoy without actually speaking to him, but by observing him?”
“Harry Potter, it’s so nice to see you.” Luna answered dreamily. “I see you’re wrackspurts have gotten away. I believe it’s thanks to your lovely company.” She peered around him at Malfoy, who sat stiffly and eyed the food suspiciously.
Firing one single servant wasn’t enough though. The room was jam-packed with rich and noble men. And all were leering at him like he was some very tasty pudding. Draco wrinkled his nose in disgust. He hated being treated like an object. And all those men didn’t want him. No, they just wanted his body, his pretty face. They wanted Draco as a trophy. And his father would give him away all too willingly to the man who paid the highest price.
“You don’t even plan to get married anytime soon! Or do you have a special someone right now?” Granger demanded to know.
“Yeah, you’re right”, Ron conceded. “It was more talks of ‘Malfoy’s up to something’ now it’s ‘Some part of my body stands up for Malfoy’.”
“Coming to the second item on the agenda. Hermione, please tell us about non-violent communication.”
Potter smirked and said amused “No, no, go on, please. You find something that rhymes with sarcasm and makes sense, and I’ll be an utmost gentleman tonight.”
“I have a free period now. Where do you need to go?” Harry asked when they exited the infirmary, freshly healed and thoroughly scolded.
Then she distributed more badges amongst the scarce club members. On the badge was a picture showing two figures fighting each other. Then they changed, shaking hands and smiling at each other while a heart popped up above them, reading “make love, not war”. If Harry squinted and turned his head just a bit, the figures almost looked like him and Malfoy.
Blaise nodded and smiled goofily. Draco had never seen his friend that happy. “Neville is the love of my life. I don’t know how I deserve him.”
“There, there. Good boy.” Harry said and before Draco could protest, carried him to the fireplace. Quickly he threw the floo powder and shouted “The Burrow!” while holding Draco close.
The prince turned around, dug his head under the pillow and grumbled, "Quiet, who's screaming? I want to sleep! Guards, servants, maids, chase that screamer away!"
“Yes, yes. Uhm, would you be so kind as to comply with my, uh, husbands request?” Potter asked, seating himself beside Draco.
He entered the common room and found the red head immediately, entranced in a game of chess with Neville. Looking up, Neville cried “Harry!” relieved to get a distraction. He was losing rather spectacularly at this point of the game and the chess pieces were having some sort of strike.
„Well, Harry’s got a point“, Hermione came to the rescue. „I think he got his ears pierced and he’s going for a more natural look with his hair. Last year his hair was glued to his head with gel“, she observed.
Lucius was outright furious. Not only had his son humiliated some fine noble men with excellent marriage prospects, but Draco also gave up his chance of becoming the spouse of the most influential men alive. And all the riches Gryffindors king housed! That was it. The prince needed to be taught a lesson.
Harry looked at the Slytherin table to a certain blonde haired boy like almost every day. When the emerald eyes locked with silver eyes reflecting the morning sun making the silver sparkle, Harry suddenly knew he was in love with Draco Malfoy.
“Yeah, but it feels so intimate.” Harrys cheeks flushed. Draco stared at him wide eyed. Merlin, that man was cute.
Then emerald eyes followed the movement of Dracos hands which where currently drying the silky white-blonde strands with a towel. Harry forgot to breathe completely when he saw tattoos – black ink making the skin on both arms even paler. Damn, that was hot. Harry swallowed loudly startling the blonde boy to look up.
Draco had already experienced many festivities in his father's castle. But he had never seen such splendor and could not help but marvel.
“Oh, yeah. It’s about a secret agent called James Bond. Is this your first time going to the cinema?”
Potter looked into Dracos eyes and Draco searched for any kind of insincerity. All Draco could see was honesty and hope, it made hope bloom in Dracos heart as well. Potter just wanted a soulmate, somebody to be there. But maybe someday, Potter could come to love Draco for who he was.
Molly forced the prince to eat two bowls of soup. Then she sent him to bed immediately. The chef had already adopted the blond boy.
Draco tried to bake a pie. He was very pleased with the end result. He had not made a skirt, but at least he had made something to eat.
“Yeah, I live to entertain”, Draco said drily. “I’m really surprised, everybody is taking this situation much better than I expected. I thought, I would have been disinherited and hexed seven ways to Sunday!”
Draco's eyes widened in fear as the horse did not slow down and he jumped to the side in fright. The horse kicked against the stand, which fell over.
“See there, a hero!”, Draco exclaimed sarcastically. “Come closer, my Lord”, the Slytherin prince encouraged.
“Draco, please calm down. I just want what’s best for you.“ Lucius tried desperately to stop his son from destroying the roman knight’s armour, his favourite piece of art in the whole castle – and that’s definitely not because of the silver peacock adorning the metal, mind you.
Astoria gave Harry a calculating look and then latched onto Draco. “Actually, yes. But it’s good, that you’re here, Potter, because I can inform you now, that Draco will be staying here tonight. He has some debts to pay, you see.” Draco helped Astoria stand up and she clutched tightly onto his arm.
Those were the thoughts running in my head as I walked through the Forbidden Forest towards my inevitable doom.
"Don't you dare touch me, Scarhead," Draco hissed and turned his back to the man. Too exhausted from the exertion of the day, he soon fell asleep, dreaming of emerald glittering eyes turning into thoughtful forest green.
"You are in a beggar's house and this screamer is your dear husband," the beggar laughed happily. "Get up, the day has come, we have much to do," he said and sang on.
They lay in each others arms, Dracos head on Harrys chest, while Harry drew random patterns onto Dracos back with his fingers.
"The river belongs to the Thrushbeard, the fields belong to the Thrushbeard, the forests belong to the Thrushbeard. And me? I belong to the beggar," Draco said to himself bitterly.
“If you’re not already sharing a living space, I would advise in moving in together. Well, then” the employee stood up, to shake their hands and show them out. “Here is your marriage certificate. I wish you all the best, Mr. and Mr. Potter.”
Draco groaned and buried his face in his hands. Harry outright laughed. “You alright, Draco?” They were standing in front of the door now.
The two men before him wanted only his beauty anyway, and not him as a person. If he went with them, he would be just a beautiful bird in a cage like in his father's palace.
"We only have this one," replied the black haired man. He tapped the space next to him and said, "Come here."
“You heard, what he said in there. He wants to break the bond! He’s yearning to finally get rid of me.” He took a shuddering breath. “I–I should go, pack my things. Thank Molly for everything in my stead, will you? I don’t think, I can take to say goodbye personally.”
Over summer break Draco had realized he had taken a fancy on Potter. Not only was Potter a boy, which his erotic dreams reminded him daily of, but he was his archnemesis, too. One didn’t fancy ones enemy, is just wasn’t done. Especially not when ones name was Draco Malfoy.
Harry laughed. “Should I carry you then, princess?” Without waiting for an answer, Harry scooped Draco up into his arms. Draco squealed and flailed with his arms. “Let me down!”
The next thing I perceived was the scent of earth. Slowly I could hear voices from excited Death Eaters, until Voldemort hushed them.
As soon as the prince stood in the courtyard with the beggar, the beggar grabbed his hand and put a wooden ring on the prince's finger. Then the beggar clumsily took his hat off in greeting to the king and dragged Draco away with him.
Draco was stiff as a board as Voldemort hugged him. His face flickering from disbelief to disgust to horror.
He rushed to the floor where all unmarried ladies had already gathered, pushing against each other to get into a better spot. Then, Neville turned his back to the waiting crowd and threw his bouquet high in the air.
Neville nodded solemnly. “Really. He lost a bet to Blaise.” Everyone but Harry cried out in delight.
Draco did not respond to the king's words or hands, but he did not evade the touch. Harry took this as a good sign and continued.
“What?” Hermione frowned at the same time as Harry grumbled “Why is Malfoy kissing everybody but me!”
“You listen here, you little shit. I don’t care if you saved the whole fucking wizarding world or that you are the Chosen One. Nothing, absolutely nothing excuses you sacrificing your stupid dumb arse like that!” Draco hissed menacingly in my ear.
„Father also didn’t like my interpretation of the family motto. ‚Purity will always conquer’. I believe it has nothing to do with blood purity but with purity of the heart. A heartless being like the Dark Lord can never win.“
‘The day seems very successful’, the blond found and laughed happily at the thought of what he could buy all of today's earnings. Draco could prepare a real feast and the beggar would be very proud of him.
“So you were actively ignoring me!” Harry accused him. He already knew it, but it kind of hurt a little nevertheless. “What did I do, that you’re treating me like this?”
Normally I would worship his body more, would lick every inch of Draco and suck evidence of my love and desire onto his pale skin. But today I was desperate to get rid off everything that separated us as soon as possible. I needed to feel him, needed to reassure myself that we were alive. I did die today after all.
He felt miserable. Hopeless. He would never find love. All he will ever get are men who were after his name and political influence. He would be damned if he let the tosser with his emerald green eyes and his kissable lips get the better of him.
“Oh, but he did.” Harry grinned. Then his expression got serious. “Your father really loves you, Draco. He was so sad, you wouldn’t get your own family, when you stay married to me.” Harry grasped Dracos hand and squeezed it. “I told Lucius about Teddy, my godson. He is your cousin, you know? He’s the grandson of your aunt Andromeda. I planned on adopting him, when I got more stability in my life. If our relationship holds, we could be a family together. Teddy won’t be a child of your own, but he shares your blood.”
“A simple promise isn’t going to cut it this time, Harry. I need more than that to trust you on this.” Dracos eyes were hard as steel. I knew, he meant it.
Draco was startled by this touch and pulled his hands back. Immediately, the brown haired man was at his side and touched Draco's arm. "Blaise, do not frighten the poor child," he said to his companion. Then he turned back to Draco, leaned against Draco's face and breathed into his ear "My name is Theodore Nott and this is my business partner Blaise Zabini. What is a beautiful child like you doing in this crummy market? Such beauty shouldn’t be wasted in such a place. Wouldn’t you like to come with us?”
"Yes, Molly. I baked them so many times before ...", the blond interrupted himself immediately and tried to blink away the tears that were coming up.
Damn, I wanted to kiss the sneer away. I sighed and rolled my eyes dramatically, because Malfoy insists we pretend to still be enemies. “Of course, your majesty, let me be you’re humble servant.” I said, my tone mocking.
Up in the air, Harry let this mornings events replay in his head. Malfoy was very subdued this year. He made no comments against Harry, played no pranks. He ignored Harry, not even meeting his eyes in a staring context in the Great Hall. And Harry was sick of it.
Staring at his own hand as if it was something foreign, Harry made his way to the Quidditch pitch. In the free periods he often flew to get his head free.
Draco sighed and pinched his nose. “Great. I’m sure they hate me for dragging you into an unwanted match.”
“Gentleman, I had hoped that with aging you would become more mature. But apparently, despite adulthood, you have the mind of a kindergartener.” McGonagall admonished the boys. “Maybe you should be treated as such.”
He nearly had a heartattack when the blond prince announced he chose Lockhart. But it was all just a trick to get rid of the slimy bastard.
Confused Malfoy took a seat several tables away from her. “No, Granger. I’m interested in Linguistics Of Various Educationsystems, you got the title wrong.”
It was apparently Ginny’s turn, now. She squinted at her parchment and nodded before mindlessly scrunching the paper up and tossing it aside. “Harry, you’re an oblivious idiot. Just go and snog Malfoy, already. I know you want to and honestly, it would be hot as fuck. I ship it!”
“Well, you both look wonderful,” she said, smiling, Draco, would you like to come sit with Ginny, Luna, and me?”
“You’re the only one,” she said, rolling her eyes. “So, how is it with Harry? Does he do that weird thing where he tries to scare you constantly?”
“You said Easter lunch with the Weasleys,” Draco seethed, staring at the Burrow in front of them. Wizards flew around the house in a wild game of quidditch while a group of people sat in the garden watching them.
“What do you mean? We’re friends, so what?” Harry asked, shrugging his shoulders. He stood up and poured both Ron and Hermione something to drink.
Honestly, he didn’t know why to think. How is one supposed to act like when they just discover that the love of their life basically soils themselves on a daily basis- and by choice?
Giving another yawn, Draco shuffled back into the bed, Harry quickly opening his arms for the other to fall right into before falling back to sleep.
The boys looked surprised but nodded in understanding- Teddy was at a good age where others usually started on how to use the loo.
“Okay, so when you need to go poopy, put the seat down and pull down your pants and knickers- you can take it all off if you’re more comfortable doing so.” Harry explained.
After a while, Draco’s diarrhea slowly lessened and he started to pass small chunks of solid feces instead. Harry on the other hand started to become more gassier as he passed more liquidy poop this time.
Harry still grins whenever he thinks of the face Ron made when he learnt that his little sister was dating one Pansy Parkinson- whom had also made amends with Harry and who he considers one of his close friends now.
Draco looked at him with great worry, confused on why his lover was trying so hard to keep himself from soiling himself.
It more tissues to throughly clean off the splatters of diarrhea on the back and between his lover’s thighs, making the blonde’s face become hotter when Harry gave special attention to his balls.
Harry felt his body tighten out of instinct, at first not wanting to do such a private act in front of others.
“Potty training the Muggle way is actually much easier to learn than the Wizarding way. I admit, I learned how to go the Muggle way long before I did the Wizarding way. All you have to do is hold it in long enough to sit down on the seat, after all.” Draco rolled his eyes.
Harry had heard him and grinned even wider. “So it’s only me who has witness you doing this? That’s great- it means that you’re comfortable with only me, right?”
With that, the couple decided it was time to change into actual clothing before finally starting their day with wards, flowers and garden gnomes.
Seeing this, the little girl screamed bloody murder and thankfully both boys came in to the room running as soon as they heard her. They had arrived just in time to shield her from the toilet exploding (also caused by her accidental magic).
Harry heard his lover fart and chuckled as he threw more sticks into the fire. “Nice one, babe.” He called out, letting out his own gas in reply. The blond looked up from his book to give him a wink.
“Ok, now who’s hungry?” Harry asked, watching the two men he loved the most in the world with a large smile on his face.
Draco turned to the side, seeing the apprehension in the other’s expression. The blond nodded. “Of course you can join me, Harry. But make sure you take off your clothes like I did or they may get dirty.” He warned.
So after finally getting Draco to agree, Harry chose the best campsite for them to stay at for one day and one night. Then they would leave the next morning.
But thanks to Draco’s help and encouragement, Harry slowly became more comfortable in pooping in places other than their toilet.
Harry’s face became hotter as he quickly closed his legs once more. “Yes, it usually is.” He heard Draco snort and when he looked up, he couldn’t help but share a grin with his lover.
Draco paused before he raised his eyebrow at him. “Are you really asking me about my loo habits while we are both in class, Potter?” He said hauntingly, crossing his arms across his chest unamused.
When Draco was finally all clean, Harry dropped the now yellowish brown tissues into the bushes behind them. He also casted a Olefacio minuere directly on Draco to rid of any lingering stenches left behind.
“Honestly, Harry. I don’t know why you are surprised. Professor taught us this in first AND fourth year.”
Other than a few small poots, Harry felt like something was keeping his arsehole from opening up more, kept him from letting anything else to come up.
Draco blushed as he looked back at his boyfriend, meeting his gaze straight in the eyes. He saw nothing but love and acceptance in them. “Really?”
Harry nodded. “Of course! In fact, what was that burp-fart thing you did? It was completely adorable!”
Teddy then announced that he was done and if he could watch the telly (the little boy loved watching the moving and talking pictures in the wide screen and wished electricity worked at Andromeda’s house).
A few more farts shot out, making the little boy giggle some more. “When that is done, make sure you-ooh….you cast a spell to cancel out any sounds that come out- it’s not polite for others to hear you.” Contradicting to his words, Draco let out another bubbly fart just then.
There was a nice, cozy-looking set up to the side, with hammocks, cushioned chairs, a table and even a sofa laid out around a circle of arranged rocks and logs- which he assumed was where their campfire would go later.
“And I thought I couldn’t fit anymore food in my stomach.” Harry sighed as he let his lover feed his another s’more.
Dumbfounded Harry said “Fancy, yes. But I thought, you just found me attractive. You never said, you loved me. Do–do you love me?”
Yawning, Harry opened his eyes. Sleepily he gave Draco a sloppy kiss. “G’morning, love.” It wasn’t fair, how Harry never got hung over like Draco.
“Draco”, Harry said softly. Draco shook his head. He felt fingers gently prying his hands off his face. He looked at the floor. “Draco, look at me, please.”
The beggar went outside the door. But he did not close his eyes. So he could see that the prince was really very, very beautiful. His white skin without blemish, his blond hair golden in the morning sun, curves in all the right places on his slender body.
The second thing Draco felt was the throbbing in his back and –please forgive the crudeness– his arse. Not only that, his head was throbbing painfully, too. He shouldn’t have drunk so much yesterday. Wait. Yesterday was the party, that meant today…
The King of Gryffindor was never happier than at this moment. This was also shown by the radiant smile he wore on his face.
Harry entered the kitchen and ruffled Dracos hair, which earned him an indignant shout of “Don’t you dare touch my hair! Not everybody can pull off the birds nest look, you know!”
What wasn’t normal either, was Harrys increased interest in Malfoy. Well, after some selfreflection and an intervention from Ron and Hermione, he could admit, he maybe was a liiiittle bit obsessed with Malfoy in sixth year. BUT, he was right! Malfoy was up to something. Now, he had an interest in him of a different kind. That kind of interest, that makes its appearance in his pants. And dreams, very livid, wild dreams that made Harry wake up panting in a pool of wetness.
And really, as if I ever would walk away. Draco was the drug I needed to live, to feel. I was utterly hooked.
Harry laughed good naturedly. “No. But I am from an enemy country and wanted the chance to talk to you before getting directly thrown out.” He took off his mask and Draco was overwhelmed by intense green as he looked into the most beautiful eyes he had ever seen.
How could Draco face his husband now? Potter and his beautiful, stunning green eyes and his rough beard and his gruff voice singing silly, happy songs.
Turns out, Ron was the expert on feelings in the trio. He was very perceptive when it came to others feelings (just his own feelings were a bit problematic, just look at him denying that he likes Hermione). Hermione was the cleverest of them but tended to analyze feelings on a too logical level. Also, she had Arithmancy now, so Ron would have to do, Harry thought.
Draco became very hot at the sight of Harry Potter. He had to get out of the hall before someone else, at worst Potter himself, recognized him.
Draco looked away, willing his cheeks (and other regions) to cool down. “Yeah, I’ll wait in the kitchen” he murmured and fled the bedroom.
“Ew, I don’t want to get sick. Whatever makes them so happy all day is surely contagious.” Malfoy grimaced.
How could the blond do this to him? Harry thought the prince had changed, but apparently he still craved luxury and being spoiled.
He found it very amusing that the men were so easy to manipulate. He sold a lot of goods and was very happy about it. Even though he was a little sad that none of the customers attached much importance to the quality of the pottery, of which Draco was actually very proud.
Draco knew that it would probably be better to accept the girl's help. After all, he didn't know his way around the market. The flowers were fine too, but right next to the fish stall, their lovely scent was disturbed. Draco was very proud of his pottery. The jugs were very beautiful and would sell well even if people had little sense of aesthetics.
As two noblemen approached the pottery stand, Harry's eyes narrowed. He did not like at all what lustful looks the men gave Draco. They literally undressed Draco with their eyes. And the blond seemed to like it even, the way he flirted. All these touches exchanged between the men and Draco were anything but innocent.
The millet soup seemed rather bland to him. So the prince looked for more side dishes and found some herb pots by the window. He used them to season the soup.
Draco melted in the beggar's embrace. He was very stiff at first, but the warmth of the other man and the security offered by his strong arms made him relax. He had never felt so secure before. And then the kiss so tender and loving that it took his breath away. He gasped and the beggar took the opportunity to stick his tongue in his mouth.
“I didn’t know you cared so much, Weasley. So, you’re noticing things about me. Is it perhaps, that you’re interested in me and fantasize about me in a skirt while making out with your girlfriend? My, you are so lewd.” Malfoy drawled.
“He is a little spoilt, I give you that. But that’s nothing he can’t grow out of. When we`re married I will teach him how to handle the personal properly, don’t worry. And I can wait. I don’t have a sense of fashion whatsoever, but I respect that Draco is a man of taste.“
"You will," replied the beggar stubbornly. The man gave Draco a hard look that didn’t tolerate disobedience. "Because I command you."
Harry grinned triumphantly and embraced Draco. Slowly, almost shyly, he gently put his lips to the prince's. After a moment Harry became bolder and pressed against Draco's lips with more pressure. Carefully he ran his tongue over his lower lip.
My arms and legs were going limp. Before I could crush Draco under my weight, I rolled onto my back, pulling him into my arms. I tested my magic again, cleaning both of us windlessly.
In front of the hut he found flowers. He stuck them on his dress and a few more in his hair. Draco still had so much dignity after all that he wanted to look good even in misery.
Unsuspecting, Hermione entered the common room. She was in good spirits because she had just finished her homework for the next three weeks and could now spend the time revising her notes. Of course, her notes were colour-coded.
“I dearly hope, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, that you’ve learned to coexist peacefully. However, not one snarky comment, one jinx or hex against the other nor any kind of physical aggressiveness will be tolerated. If anyone witnesses such, you will immediately hold hands again. I’ve altered the charm, so that every professor in this school can order you to hold hands. Hold that in mind, gentleman.”
Draco could smell Harry and Salazar, was this intoxicating. This wasn’t good for Dracos heart. Or other body parts, for that matter. He could feel the rippling muscles beneath him. And, shit, something hard pressed against his hip. Draco wriggled again in a poor attempt of getting up and his own morning erection brushed against Harrys. The blond moaned and immediately froze in shock.
Harry held Draco tightly in his arms and rubbed soothing circles into Dracos back. When the blonde was calm enough, he said “Father wants to speak with you. Is that ok?”
It was like our regular sex, but at the same time, it was completely different. Maybe my senses were heightened from the battle like my magic was. Maybe it felt so much more emotional because I died.
“Because Draco insisted on throwing Blaise a big party. And it had to be a week in advance so they could recover until the wedding. Today they are at the spa to get face masks and manicure. I wanted only a peaceful get together, that’s why Blaise allowed us to have a tea party today.” Neville smiled contentedly.
Burping and farting was fine. It was just different with pooping- that was more intimate, made him feel more vulnerable.
Draco’s pout deepened. “I still don’t understand why you like it when I do that sort of thing so much.” He huffed.
After about 15 more minutes, Draco jaw dropped as they entered through the ‘shield’ that Harry had casted yesterday and saw where they would be staying at until tomorrow.
“URRRRRPP!” Harry let out his own belch, sighing at his patted his stomach. “Excuse me.” He said sweetly, as he winked at his lover and grinned as his godson giggled.
"Uh, Draco? I don’t think you’re the only one that got affected. I think dinner's finally starting to hit me too. Is it okay if I go next to you?" Harry asked, not really waiting for an answer as he was already taking off his pants.
Draco was looking at Teddy and spoke, “Now Teddy, because you’re only starting with your training, you may not be able to wipe yourself well enough and that might cause you to get a rash or even sick. So when you’re done, make sure to call someone to help clean you, alright? When you get more used to it, then you may try to clean yourself. But for now, please ask for help. Here, I’ll help clean Harry right now.”
The couple then decided to spend the night together (completely innocently) in the Room of Requirement where they could snog and cuddle together with complete privacy and no interruptions.
There was one instant when while they were both cuddling in bed, he had accidentally farted and unintentionally dutch-ovened his poor boyfriend. And it had reeked- probably due to all the food he ate over the last few days had festered inside his gut.
“Ooh…I feel like a pig.” Harry groaned, lowering the band of his pants a little to keep it from pushing against his bloated belly.
“Ah, wait. In order for us to be completely comfortable with one another, I should fart too!” He said.
Harry gave her a soft look as he stood up and walked towards them, casting cleaning charms on himself.
“We are not getting into that conversation right now,” Harry said and stood up. “Now, let’s go to your rooms so I can get a drink and you can explain to me how calling you Professor Mafloy is deserving of taking ten points from a first year.”
“Someone needs to talk to him,” Hermione hissed, looking down at the man who was currently passed out on her couch. Harry’s glasses were cracked, he was wearing sweatpants that Hermione was quite certain did not start out the colour that they currently were, and a baggy Falmouth Falcons shirt.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Don’t be so dramatic, Potter, Mother simply adored you, Father tolerated you, which is much better than what he’s done with my latest partner.”
“Well, Potter, thank you for the drink but I do believe it’s time I retire to my rooms,” he said, brushing off his pristine trousers.
Harry let out a soft laugh. “I’ll make sure to remind him that,” he said and kissed Draco again. “Love you.”
“Honestly, Gentlemen, you have been colleagues for three years now, don’t you think it’s time to be done with these petty arguments?” She asked tiredly. “The two of you should have left all of this behind after the war.”
“Hermione just realized that Draco is a potions master, I reckon,” Harry said cracking a smile. “And now she’s grilling him because he’s an academic and she is too.”
Harry smirked. “You weren’t mad when I left it on your neck this morning,” he said, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist. “So it’s fine, just use a glamour tomorrow. Now, I’m tired, it’s nearly midnight, I’ve been grading and I’m ready to change into something comfier.”
Draco looked at Harry and the two grinned at one another. “Ron, he’s kidding,” Harry said with a chuckle. “You wouldn’t be able to handle ‘Cissa even if you tried.”
“Promise, just you wait, we’re going to win just like Gryffindors do every single year,” Harry said and stood up. “Now, it’s past curfew so let us get you back to the common area and you go up and get some sleep.”
“You mean when he lied about recognizing me? Or what about eighth year when he apologized to all of us for letting his parents influence him? You have no idea who Draco is anymore, he’s an amazing person,” Harry exclaimed defensively.
“The Boy Who Lived stared a family with the weaselette.” Bella scowled. “It all made sense after that. SO, I’m sorry
“You’re welcome,” he said, a small smile on his face before he looked at Aaron. “It was a good call to ask for help, Mr. Evans. Professor Potter is excellent at calming down cowardly lions.” He carefully set the tray of tea on the small coffee table.
“Then we’ll talk,” the blond said, ignoring his annoyed daughter who trudged behind him sullenly. “Come along Lysandra, train,” he said, trying to keep the nervousness that flooded his heart from creeping into his voice. Lissy nodded her head and followed after her uncle to the train.
“But it seems that you’re already ahead of us,” Ron said dryly. “Seriously Harry, the ferret?” He demanded.
Bella rolled her eyes and elbowed her father in the ribs. “Remember what we’ve talked about? I don’t really want to meet him, I kinda hate him, this is for you.”
Lissy nodded. “I love you, Uncle Draco,” she said before wrapping her arms around Draco’s neck and hugged him tight. The older wizard stiffened for a millisecond before he relaxed slightly.
“Well, this is the first time Harry has ever convinced you to come to a family function and none of us know very much about you, or your and Harry’s relationship for that matter,” Hermione stated. “You can’t blame us.”
A slow smile grew on Harry’s face. Draco pulled him off of the couch and took Harry’s hand in his and dragged him out of the office. “We’re going to get caught,” Harry laughed.
“Whatever you pick out--within reason, Draco Malfoy, I will not let you put me in a dress or some stupid outfit  that makes me look like a ponce. Got it?” He asked and Draco grinned before he pinned the man on the bed.
“I’m sorry,” Potter blurted out. “I let everyone fill me with those stupid thoughts and I shouldn’t have.”
Draco gave his ex an apologetic look as he quietly cursed his daughter for leaving him alone. “I’m sorry about Bella, she’s been planning that speech ever since her first owl was returned.”
“Well, that does put a damper on things, doesn’t it?” He mused and looked at the prefect, still staring at the men in shock. “Aaron, you can take a seat if you would like.”
Harry smiled and took Draco’s hands in his. “Thank you, I know you like when I have my hair pulled back and Ron told me he heard you threaten to chop my hair off if I came down the aisle with it down.”
Draco couldn’t seem to look away. He was still so beautiful, so… breathtaking. The blond couldn’t help but go back to
Tommy nodded and followed Harry back to the Gryffindor commons. Once Harry was absolutely sure that the young boy was okay, he headed straight to the dungeons to find a certain Potions professor.
Draco sighed and kept quiet as he watched Potter talk with his son. If it was for him, why did it hurt so much?
“So, does this mean that I’m stuck at the girlfriend table?” Draco drawled, taking a seat next to Ginny.
Draco chuckled and followed Harry out of his office. “He started crying as soon as I took the points away,” he said, a small smirk on his face.
When Harry first brought up the idea of camping, Draco had flat out refused. Being in the middle of nature, far away from civilization gave the blond hives just from the mere thought of it.
“Yes. Now we have these facilities. Especially when Muggleborns began arriving in the Wizarding world, the restrooms we have today became even more welcomed- if not just so it would make those who were raised in the Muggle world more comfortable.” Hermione nodded.
Draco huffed but a smile laid on his lips as he played with the dark strands, letting it slip through his fingers. “I know you’re waking up, Love. I actually thought you would sleep the whole day away.”
Unable to help himself, he let his hands fall lower, gently cupping the other buttcheeks in his palms.
“UURRP! Ahhh…that was great.” Harry burped, groaning in satisfaction as he dropped down on the sofa, patting his full belly. They had just came home from dinner, after celebrating their first day of living together.
Draco grimaced but he wasn’t surprised by the other’s reply. “Please tell me you at least brought some tissue with you for us to use?” He begged, not wanting to use leaves like he heard some other Muggles did while camping (he shuddered at the thought of his bum being massacred by the roughness of wildlife).
Harry then let out a louder whimper and Draco felt a sudden wetness spreading on the front of his own pants.
He watched the other squint his eyes slightly as he looked down, his entire face twisting in concentration as he gave another push with a short grunt.
Harry gasped as he saw his lover’s messy state, liquid poop dripping down Draco’s derrière and legs, pooling on the ground.
Taking a deep breath, Harry gathered all his Gryffindor courage and decided to just do it. If Draco could relieve himself unabashedly in front of Harry on a nearly daily basis, then so can he.
He would normally never pass gas anywhere that wasn’t in the privacy of their home, but out in the woods as they are, surrounded by only the wildlife around them, Draco had never felt more free.
And Harry did not have a job, but he was the secret benefactor of two orphanages- one in the Muggle world and the other in the Wizarding world- which he and Draco would visit once in a while.
Storing any lingering thoughts away in his mind, knowing that he will come back to examine those later, Harry now focused solely on his love, leaning in as he placed a sweet kiss on the other lips.
While Draco washed the dishes, there was a slowly growing puddle forming underneath his bare feet, streams of urine dripping down his legs.
“Thank you, Harry.” Draco said softly, nuzzling his nose to the other’s shoulder. “Without you, I would have never even imagine camping could be like this.”
Suddenly the sound of a airy fart filled the air with a hissing that quickly made any thoughts floating in Harry’s head quickly halt and suddenly Harry’s only focus was on Draco and Draco only.
Harry grinned as he kissed the other again. He suddenly felt a pull from his bladder, which made him pull away. “I have to go to the loo first- you go ahead.” Draco nodded as he got off the bed, heading towards the kitchen.
“Ok, so the first thing to do is that when you feel like you need to go, make sure to go to the loo first. We got you a mini version so it would be easier for you to use.” Harry gestured towards the little seat that he and Draco had gotten earlier.
“Not even your mother?” Harry asked in surprise. He then remembered during Draco’s lesson on how he wondered why the blond never hide anything when he relieved himself in front of Harry.
Draco looked at how happy Harry looked and finally he could feel his own lips lifting up to a small smile. “I supposed so.”
During his History Of Magic class, Harry, who was slowly nodding off like usual, suddenly lifted his head and looked at the Professor in shock.
Harry wondered about Draco’s words. From the start, the blond had never seeked for privacy or wore/done anything to hide what he was doing from Harry.
Harry nodded. "Yeah, and maybe since it was you’re first time eating food made on the campfire, then maybe that- ugh..." Harry stopped what he was saying when his own stomach suddenly began to cramp. Very badly.
“Sorry about that.” Draco apologized, his piss starting to tamper off. Teddy looked down at the puddle, his mouth in a cute small ‘o’ shape.
“Are you alright Harry? You were a bit quiet there for a moment. Is something wrong?” Draco questioned.
The khaki pants began to bulge out, trying to accommodate the ‘butt baby’ that was making its home in it.
Harry didn’t understand why he couldn’t stop thinking about what had happened. Even as he stared up at the ceiling, all Harry could see were pants bulging from fecal matter and he swore he could hear all the pops and splatters that accompanied it.
Fairy lights hung everywhere- still turned off due to it was still morning, but their glass sparkled in the sunlight. And lanterns also filled the area, turned off as well but it gave Draco security knowing they would have more then enough lighting during sundown.
His lover wore a light blue cashmere sweater paired with a form-fitting khaki pants that Harry loved since it showed off his significant other’s arse perfectly.
But the thought of actually soiling himself in the wizardly way was a bit too much for Harry still. Reminded him too much of his childhood and how he had been degraded for it.
Draco raised his free hand to carefully grab one of Harry’s hands and bring it behind him. He heard his lover let out a gasp as he brought Harry’s hand to cup over Draco’s own mess in his pants.
Draco gave out a tiny grunt as more diarrhea shot of out of his own rear end. "Are you okay, Harry? Yours don’t sound very good." He asked his boyfriend worriedly.
After they finished with the rest of their breakfast, Draco started with the dishes while Harry cleared the table and put everything away.
“Wow, this looks delicious.” Draco complimented, his stomach growling from hunger as he looked at all the food.
Harry groaned. “I already did- he said he was visiting his Muggle in-laws in Canada at the moment and won’t be able to come here until next week.”
Harry’s heart warmed as he tickled the little boy’s belly, making him laugh out loudly. “More than you’ll ever know, Teddy.” And it was the truth. Harry loved Teddy and considered the little boy as his son.
In the past 8 years, Harry had learned many things in his new world and learned to accept the differences between Wizarding World and Muggle World.
Harry watched the various emotions flit across his lover’s face (fury was one that stood out the most).
Keeping those thoughts in mind, Harry finally felt his arsehole loosen and with an audible gurgle from his stomach, a loud fart echoed through the room.
Harry sighed when he realized that it was only his boyfriend and started to pull his shorts up. "Oh, it’s only you, love. Thought for a moment the shield had gone wonky and that you were someone else.”
After the war, it was Harry’s testimony that kept Draco and Narcissa out of Azkaban. In fact, they got off pretty lightly- the only punishment was for both of them to be on probation for one year, which included Narcissa being under house arrest and Draco needing to attend 8th year at Hogwarts during that time.
Giving a yawn, Draco laid his head back down on the pillow, smiling when he heard Harry mumble into his chest as he nuzzled his head against him.
Just as the blonde moved to leave, Harry had grabbed his hand to stop him and still laughing, tugged the blond back on the couch.
After a light dessert of creamy fruit salad, the trio went to the living room where Harry and Draco cuddled on the couch while Teddy sat on the rug in front, watching his tv show.
And it helped that his lover was one of the most powerful wizards in history and had a natural talent in wandless and wordless magic.
„Thank you, `Mione“, Harry sighed relieved to know that he wasn’t the only one noticing things about his school rival.
The truly scandalizing part was Dracos previous announced engagement with Astoria. While the article expressed its understanding, that of course Draco would choose the most eligible bachelor before her, it also drew Draco as a money hunting man who deceived not only poor Astoria, but also Harry. Well, it could be worse.
Grudgingly, Harry followed. Malfoy did the same, but shoved Harry brutally aside when he passed him. Stumbling, Harry mumbled a tripping jinx. Malfoy barely held himself upright. And in the next second, both were shoving and pushing each other rather heatedly.
Actually, the king was dressed quite simply for a royal. But his attitude and his aura were those of a true king. Unbridled and wild, yet elegant and authoritative.
“Thank you, Mione. I think it’s better, if you give us some time for ourselves now.” Potter said and gently ushered her and the rest of their friends out.
“You are old enough to act like a mature adult, Draco. You should have married years ago, but I granted you your freedom. I accepted that none of the young gentlemen I introduced to you were of your taste. But now it’s time for you to find a partner as long as you are so pretty.“
Draco very carefully handed him the old clothes through a crack in the door and now he had nothing on anymore.
All Harry saw were coquettish looks, flirtatious touches, blushing cheeks and lips curled into a lascivious smile. And none of this was directed at Harry. None of this was ever given to the beggar in the hut. The rage in Harry piled up as he watched as strange men tampered with his Draco, his property.
I felt myself getting irritated and rather angry. Before I could explode though, Malfoy used the general commotion of the class ending to shove me and bite my neck. He kissed and licked the abused skin briefly and all my anger evaporated.
Shit, he was crying uncontrollably now. It was clear from the start that Draco could not have a happy end, because he did not deserve it. He should have known better. “Merlin, I was so stupid for hoping I could have a family, with Harry and Teddy. I was so happy, you all welcomed me and I found a home here, too. But I knew I would never fit right in. You’re all better off, without me.”
Ron gently elbowed him in the ribs. "There he is," said the redhead, pointing with his chin toward a flower stand.
Slowly a smug grin spread over the prince's face. He was well aware of his good looks and obviously it was still his strongest weapon. With a little flirting he would certainly sell a lot of goods.
“You should have listened to the whole, conversation, silly. I said, I was tired of it, because I had trapped you in this marriage. I wanted to break the bond, to set you free. I wanted to give you a choice. I hoped you would still choose to be with me, but out of your own free will and not because you didn’t have another option.”
As I contemplated whether moonlight would make Malfoys hair appear more silver than that golden tone like right now I was interrupted from my musing by Ron who sat down opposite me, effectively blocking my view of Malfoy. Now that was just rude.
She launched into her lecture about how Harry was apparently attracted to the same sex but had to suppress this side of himself because of his childhood circumstances. Now, it seemed like Harry unconscientiously lusted after Malfoy. Again. Because already in first year Harry used the romantical tactics of a kindergartener – apparently Harry was pulling pigtails – to get involved with the Slytherin. Harry’s protests of Malfoy starting it first and how he had only defended himself were promptly ignored. Hermione explained that it was okay to have sex dreams about boys and getting an erection from it, because it was a natural physical reaction for a teenager.
“Oh. It was wrong to make fun of you in that way. I’m sorry, I’ll take responsibility if you let me. The way I see it, we have two options. We’re trying to get on with our separate lives whilst satisfying the bond with minimal contact or we’re trying to make this work and get to know each other. I know this all started as a joke, but I want to give this, us, a fair chance. Especially, if we’re soulmates. What do you say?”
Before anyone could move or say something Molly Weasley bustled forward hugging a shocked frozen Draco. “Oh, you poor dear. Trapped in an unwanted marriage! But our Harry is quite the catch, so please give him a chance. At least you didn’t get Ron as your soulmate, that would have been a disaster.”
Even Draco could not stop smiling. He leaned over to his husband and kissed him on the chin that he had insulted so badly a few weeks ago.
With these words, music resounded and people danced. But the king indicated to the servants with his hand that they should serve the food. In the middle of the movement, however, the king paused and suddenly stared intensely at Draco.
“I’m sorry! While searching for a way to break your bond I found this spell, that could enable same-sex couples to receive children of their own, if it’s real love. I wanted to tell you normally, I swear. But I drank so much and you told me, you really wanted to have kids and I just kind of performed the spell. I wasn’t even sure that it worked.” Hermione said helplessly.
Harry carried him until they stood in front of a restaurant. “Have you eaten pizza before?” Harry asked.
“That’s what I’ve said, do keep up.” Pansy met Draco’s eyes and startled. Looking guilty, she made to run away. “Pansy, you cow, stay where you are!” Draco screamed and stormed after her.
A few minutes later Neville and Blaise followed, hand in hand, smiling sappily at each other, eyes shining with tears of joy.
But before my fist could connect with Voldemorts not-really-there nose he just dissolved into thin air.
After breakfast Harry said, “For today, I thought you could meet Teddy. And tonight I want to take you out on a date.”
Reluctantly Harry made to grab Malfoy left hand, but Malfoy quickly snatched his hand away. “I’m lefthanded, you oaf”, Malfoy hissed and held out his right hand.
“Yes, and you have to swear you won’t hex me or I won’t tell you”, Blaise said eyeing Draco like he was a wild animal.
“I’m getting old, my feet are killing me”, Draco whined when they finally left Andromedas house. He had a very nice chat with his aunt while Harry distracted Teddy. Draco liked his aunt very much, she was headstrong and sweet at the same time. Their chat was cut very short though, because Teddy demanded Dracos attention after only twenty minutes.
“It’s just so absurd, when you think about it. Our relationship is just like one of those shitty soap operas we watched on TV.”
Rested and after an extensive breakfast, as Molly insisted, the world did not look so terrible anymore. Draco threw himself into work and to Molly's delight he was a real help in the kitchen. In fact, the cook never let anyone touch the pots, but after only two days, she entrusted Draco to cook on the stove by himself.
The more days passed, the more restless Harry became. Where had Draco disappeared to? Had he gone with a nobleman after the fiasco at the market? Was he dead? The mere thought made Harry sick.
"Even you, Molly. Please give me a moment with Draco." Ordered the king when the cook did not move. Reluctantly, she obeyed, leaving the blond boy alone with the king.
“Aw, sweet pea! Of course, you deserve him! You are the cutest and most perfect couple in the whole world, it’s disgusting, really. And now off you go before I vomit!” Draco shooed his friend out of the room.
Suddenly wide awake, he wrenched his eyes open. Fuck, what time was it? They had to pick up Teddy from Andromedas, to get the adoption settled.
Ron looked helplessly at his friend. Harry held his breath captivated by the sight of Draco. His green eyes wide in wonder und warm with love. He’s got it really bad.
The jugs smashed on the ground, the plates broke. What was not yet in shards was crushed under the horse's hooves.
The two were strolling a few feet behind Harry and Draco who were bickering happily with each other. This morning Harry took Dracos hand naturally without being punished to do so by one of the teachers. Neither boy had noticed the difference in their handholding.
"You should have seen him flirting with all those men. He never flirted with me like that and I am his husband!" Harry tried to explain himself.
Draco was convinced that his father would calm down after a while and forgive him. It was always that way. Draco would simply stay away from his father for a few days. At some point, father would miss him too much and spoil him again.
As he held up the snitch in a victory pose his eyes met Dracos. The Slytherin nodded in acknowledgement and smiled lightly. Harry, overwhelmed by a flood of emotions, only grinned back goofily.
Potter and Draco stared at each other for a while. Each taking a moment to assess the other. Draco had to admit that Potter was gorgeous in his form fitting grey suit and pale pink necktie matching Draco’s dress. Since when was Potter that fit? Momentarily the blond got lost in very distracting thoughts.
The first thing Draco felt as he slowly awoke from his peaceful slumber, was the warm body, that was wrapped around him. Sighing contently, he snuggled closer into the warmth. He took a deep breath, relishing in the familiar scent.
The Slytherin prince eyed the floor, which really didn't look very comfortable. Annoyed, he sighed and lay tentatively in bed with the beggar, who grinned at him cheekily.
Any further discussions were broken off by sudden silence and then exclamations of awe. Prince Draco floated into the room attired in a white dress with gold embroidery of various flowers. In the middle of each flower was a gemstone that reflected coloured light into the room. Over that he wore a coat of golden velvet with white fur on the collar. His long hair was braided with a golden ribbon. A tiara with coloured stones surrounded his head. But the most beautiful thing about the prince was his face. His skin almost as white as the fur, his cheeks pink and his mouth tinted red. The grey eyes, bordered with golden powder, looked like liquid silver. He was breathtaking.
The steel melted to the liquid silver I loved to get lost in. “Do you really mean it, Harry? You would marry me?” Draco asked, hope in his voice.
The beggar stretched and yawned. He went to the bed in the corner of the room and said to Draco, "Come to bed now.”
Instead of answering Draco drew me into a filthy kiss and rolled his hips against mine. Moaning I grabbed Dracos perfect arse and squeezed. I instantly grew hard.
Mmh, what would be catchy? My wand was broken, so I needed something that would give me time to get my hands on a weapon.
Dracos tears startled Harry out of his rigidity. He took the blond into his arms and held him tight. Harry petted his head and whispered “I’m so sorry. Please don’t cry.”
Even after classes he was dragged into the library again. Extremely bored Harry turned page after page of his Quidditch magazine while Malfoy diligently did his homework. Harry hadn’t read a word of his magazine, focusing instead on Malfoys body warmth and the soft pressure on his hand.
“I love you Draco Malfoy. I’m so happy we can be here together now.” Harry told the other truthfully, radiating out all the love he had onto the other.
And Victoire loved her Uncle Draco. As in, he was her first love. He was just so pretty even though he was a man and even spoke to her in French- like her maman!
Harry demonstrated as he spoke and let out a sigh in relief as his urine hit the bowl. “Make sure you aim correctly so your pee doesn’t go everywhere.” He warned.
Absentmindedly, Harry wordlessly and wandlessly casted another Olefacio minuere, although he wasn’t sure why since the only sense that was working for him right now was his sense of sight.
Harry chuckled as kissed the top of the blond head’s hair. “Adorable.” He sighed as he push out a good fart himself.
A torrent of gas bursted out and small turds of poop followed, with loud plopping that could be heard landing in the toilet.
He was later told that mostly pureblood families still expelled their waste this way, more out of tradition then anything else. But there were halfbloods and even muggle-borns who preferred the wizarding way of going as well.
Harry shook his head when he saw the other narrow his eyes at him. “I don’t mean it in a bad way, just…ohhh?” He said helplessly.
“Harry?” The other wizard suddenly snapped out of his stupor before finally noticing his lover was right in front of him now, nice and clean with no evidence of what just occurred earlier. Green eyes looked up to meet the familiar grey eyes that he loved so much.
They had just just gotten together in their relationship a few weeks before. They came back from Hogsmeade where they had gone on their second date.
As for Ginny, her only wish for Harry was she hoped he’d found someone to share his life with so he wouldn’t be taking care of Teddy alone. At the time, they had already broken up but they actually became more closer than before since they had also came out to each other as gay the same day they broke up.
Even as he memorized the wonderful vision before him- Draco truly was the most beautiful man Harry had ever met- it did nothing to quell the thoughts that continued to float in his mind.
Because of this, most people just stuck to the first spell which came in handy during times when Harry had to change his godson’s Teddy’s diaper or when he and his lover were dropping arse between them.
Draco paused in slathering his toast with marmalade as he narrowed his eyes at his lover. “I was not aware that we’ve run out. And what exactly happened to my pint of strawberry and peanut butter ice cream?”
The saying, ‘True love is when you can fart in front of each other’, was something that the blond soon found out to be true.
Colored in soft ivory, the large tent stood tall at about 6”10 and could fit at least 8 people inside. With the flaps open, he was delighted to see an actual bed inside! With everything from puffy pillows and a comforter that just begged for one’s body to be wrapped in.
Half-Giants. Flying Cars. Werewolves. Dragons. Blood Quills. Love Potions. Horcuxes created by homicidal egomaniacs with no nose.
“The topic itself is practically taboo to them.” Harry said as another violent fart came out of Draco’s arse at the same time.
Draco blushed, biting his lips although failing to keep the wide smile from appearing on his face. “You’re such a sap, Harry.” Leaning in, any more conversation was quickly lost in the night and replaced with moans and the tangling of bodies becoming one.
Draco was still reeling from what had happened. After a few moments, he finally found his voice. “I thought you were laughing at me and was thinking I was disgusting.” He murmured.
But now, Harry stared at the pants not because he was admiring his lover’s arse. Instead he stared as urine streamed down, leaving dark trails down the pants before making a good size puddle on the floor, surrounding Draco’s bare feet.
