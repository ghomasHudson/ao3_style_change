Harry quickly began feeling angry at the woman, as she dismissed her classmate’s questions, called Lupin a half-breed, and kept ignoring Harry’s raised hand. He noticed that all of the raised hands came from Gryffindors, and looked towards the other end of the room. The Slytherins were quiet observers, eyes flickering between the students and Umbridge as if it were a tennis match.
?” asked George.
George raised a hand. “Nonsense, we actually had something already planned, we would just have to rush a bit but, hey,” He patted Harry on the shoulder, “we would be helping our favourite investor.”
“Well, at least I got that one,” muttered Draco, frowning at his wand as if it were its fault that the silvery mist he cast never seemed to agree on a form. The hawthorn wand obviously didn’t do anything under the glare, but Harry still felt a bit bad for it.
?" repeated Hermione.
He blinked and frowned a Ron, who retreated his hand to grab a scone. “What is it?” he asked, picking at his own food. The sudden revelation had left him less hungry, somehow.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No,” admitted Harry, but even then… “You would tell me, right? Even if the Order tried to keep quiet-”
“Quite the opposite.” Draco placed his hands on Harry's shoulders, his smile turning into a mischievous grin. “Think about it, I can assure she knows nothing about what you and your little band are up to."
Harry raised an eyebrow. “I understand the other three, but toads? Neville’s is always getting lost.”
This time, the Slytherin didn’t even spare him a glance, his dark eyes fixed on Harry. “I assume you haven’t glanced at the Daily Prophet yet.”
"Wait, so we can name Slytherins too?" said one hesitant student.
“So we let him die?!” yelled Harry, making the girl flinch.
thought Harry.
Like across the Great Hall as well, so easy to spot. “He broke up with me,” repeated Harry once again and this time Ron spat out whatever he was drinking and Hermione didn’t even seem to notice the drops falling on her plate.
The blond seemed to remember his parents because his eyes travelled back to Lucius quickly. But the man was still looking at the group, slightly raising his eyebrows before he leaned towards his son and whispered something. Draco blinked at him, doing a double-take on them and saying something back.
“The first one that jumps to mind,” said Draco, pointedly ignoring Harry’s disbelief. “Is when I got upset at my father because he wouldn’t buy me a new broom.”
me?” finally echoed Draco, and there was a tremble to his previously steady voice that alarmed Harry. “Then… if I asked you to leave everything behind and run with me, would you do it?”
“Everyone has bad days, Ron,” tried Harry. He didn't like seeing his friend like that, so defeated.
Harry frowned in confusion, but when Dudley merely repeated the motion he copied it, wondering if he had something on his neck. And at that moment he remembered Draco’s sharp teeth sinking into it a few hours ago and felt colour rise to his cheeks, realising why everyone had been acting strange.
The blond scoffed. “I’d rather have her disposed of. But yes, it’s necessary."
Harry poured himself some more pumpkin juice, calmly sipping at it as he witnessed Ron's frantic race against the clock, as he hurried to finish his essay before lunch ended.
It was late when Harry parted ways with him, after successfully avoiding the rest of the student body all day thanks to empty classrooms. It was Draco the one to stand up, fix his clothes and say he had things to do, and Harry had reluctantly agreed, only because he had something to do too.
Everything but the mechanic dummies.
“Oh, you too?” asked Cedric. “She asked me to meet her at the Three Broomsticks but didn’t say why. Needless to say, Cho wasn’t happy when I told her, even when I asked her to come along.” He shook his head and let out a sigh. “But I’m sure both of us will be forgiven later, right?” he said, bumping Harry’s shoulder with a fist. “Cheer up! And let’s get out of this rain before we get sick. We have a match coming soon and I want a redo of last time. No dementors this time.”
“Is the Gryffindor Hero forgetting his ways and finding amusement in deceiving others?" teased Draco, poking his chest with a finger.
Sirius hummed. “Well, you will be doing something now. A letter just arrived-”
Harry frowned at the nickname. That hadn't been fun. "Yeah, maybe."
“Okay, sure,” breathed out Harry.
Blaise snorted into his glass of water and Ginny glared at him. In proper Slytherin fashion, Blaise faced her with the raise of his glass and a sly smile that made her narrow her eyes.
“Sorry, I was distracted.” Harry grimaced apologetically, letting the blond go. “Were you leaving?” he added, feeling a bit disappointed.
, thought Harry, glancing at Blaise again.
Harry entered the common room feeling as if he walked on air. Despite Myrtle’s unfortunate interruption at the end, Harry couldn’t help but grin like an idiot as he remembered the way Draco had blushed, how he had brushed his hair and looked at him. There was hope, beautiful glorious hope for him.
“I don’t have to explain myself to you, Granger,” said Draco coldly. The expression he had on his face was a familiar one and Harry wasn't surprised when his next words were,  “I’m taking my leave now, I’ll see you later, Harry." And with that, the blond spun on his heel and walked away.
“Yes, I just wanted to talk with you and Sirius.”
are dating,” she said slowly. “You are telling me that."
Harry hurried to grab Draco by the arm before he could walk into the cave and get himself killed. “That didn’t go well last time,” he said when the blond frowned at him.
“Yes, sir,” jabbed Harry. “But I think I will get started on my assignments before. There are too many things to do."
“I haven’t read this one,” said Hermione, her fingers stopping on one book Harry couldn’t see well from where he was sitting.
Malfoy shoves him and Harry stumbles back but doesn’t let go of his grip, sending the blond into him. They are inches apart now, and Harry can see every wrinkle on Malfoy’s face as he twists his features into a snarl. “And that was all your fault,” hisses the blond harshly. “It’s your fault I have become a disgusting

The party reminded Harry a lot of last year's, to celebrate the result of his trial and Ron and Hermione's selection as Prefects. It was pretty much the same, with the table filled with food, a red banner and the members of the Order. Harry knew very well that the party doubled as an Order meeting, as he could see Moody in a corner talking quietly with Remus and Mr Weasley. It made sense, since Sirius had told him that all members had been quite busy, now that Voldemort was more active.
“You are related to Tonks too?” asked Harry in surprise.
?” asked Sirius, giving everyone a weird look. “Why am I the only one angry about this? You know it’s not right."
One chapter to go! I'm already working on the next part, but I'll most likely start posting it next year. I'm quite excited about this one (!!!)
Harry smiled at him. “Great.” He gently squeezed the arm on his grip and frowned when he noticed that the fabric was way too thin for the weather. “You are going to freeze to death if you go out like that.”
“Why not?”
"Have you come up with a way to stay underwater for that long?" asked Draco. "There's less than a week left, now."
Since breakfast wasn’t an option, unless he felt like subjecting himself to spell damage by Parkinson, he tried to approach him during Care of Magical Creatures. But Hagrid was still having them take care of Nifflers, which were cute, but also liked to run around stealing stuff, making one having to chase after them.
forest.
“Are you done now?” asked Ron, lowering the hand he had fakely coughed into. “Because I think Neville is about to faint," he added, jerking his head towards the shocked boy, who kept rubbing his eyes as if he had just woken up.
“I didn’t do that,” mumbled Harry, feeling his blood rush as the idea crossed his head. He stood up quickly, extending a hand to a startled Draco with an embarrassed smile. “Er, Defense?"
“He did the same thing during Yule” snickered Ron. And then he yelped. “Hermione!”
“No idea,” admitted Harry.
“You just
Anyway! Hope you liked the chapter! Kinda short but the next one will be way longer haha
“Hey, what’s your problem?!” asked Ron harshly, but the girl all but ignored him, blazing eyes fixed on Harry with fury.
“Sirius, the broom only has two years, there’s no use buying a new one,” said Remus, who had met them outside the inn for
“Wouldn’t want to interrupt your silly date,” jabbed Ron, parting from the wall with a groan. He stretched and gave Draco a serious look. “And by that, I mean that I’d rather die than be caught between your flirting again."
thought Harry, finally pouring the vial into his cauldron. Then he paused.
The second thing they noted was the flutter of green and dark robes and a warning yell before Parkinson marched over from her table and shoved a newspaper at Harry’s chest harshly. “This is your fault!” she hissed, stepping forwards again and being stopped by a sudden hand on her shoulder as Blaise caught up with her.
as it is, it’s real,” muttered Ginny, face resting on her hand. Harry knew she was still a bit angry, frowning whenever the twins cooed at him. But when he asked Hermione about it, she just shook her head and said she needed time.
Mr and Mrs Weasley shared a perplexed look. “Well, Hermione has always been a very smart girl,” said Mrs Weasley.
The first thing they saw was the noticeable absence of Umbridge’s awful pink. Her spot had been rightfully claimed by Dumbledore, who remained calm in the middle of the chaos. His eyes caught Harry’s as he walked in and looked away perhaps a tad too quickly.
Harry blinked at him. “Really?"
"You," said Harry, grinning when the one spot he had been looking at finally rounded the corner. He opened the door, smiling at the newcomer as he folded the map, the small spot named
"We are advancing quite well, so don't worry." Hermione glanced up at the clock and hummed. "No much time left anyway."
If it weren't for the many eyes around them, that is. The rumours of Harry holding secret meetings had been only diminished by the rumours of him and Draco being together, and of the latter having been the one to rat him out.
It was an unfamiliar situation because, despite their years at Hogwarts, this was probably the second time they had been alone together, after detention during their first year. Third, if he counted their meeting at Madame Malkin's.
Harry did, and not a moment later he felt the world twist almost painfully around him, the Headmaster’s arm pulling him harshly into what felt like a void, with no light and no air, only a pressure that made him feel his eardrums might explode.
Parkinson scoffed at him. “Going all soft on us now, aren’t you?"
of their material."
It was a harsh reminder, brought down like the cold rain.
Harry felt numb. That's the only word he could come up with to describe what he was feeling as he walked to the castle with Luna. Numb. Part of him was surprised he wasn't crying, that's what people usually did when the person they love breaks up with-
Ron raised an eyebrow. “Why are you doing that now? Isn’t he going to help you tomorrow?"
“Stop looking for him, someone might notice,” mumbled Hermione, not without a trace of humour in her tone. Harry turned towards her and raised an eyebrow. “You are not exactly discreet, Harry.”
“What is
He went back to watching the blond as he studied, noticing that the blush hadn’t disappeared, and fell asleep after a while, waking up to fingers absentmindedly threading through his hair while their owner read about Charms under his breath.
Draco raised an eyebrow. "Broad?"
“Well, that’s how I learned how the trial went. You know I don't subscribe to the Prophet, and I can’t spend all day next to the wireless.” Sirius sighed. “It was Moony who told me, but Arthur did bring it up again after the dinner we had.”
Draco shrugged. “Just in case." He let go of Harry and fixed his clothes. “I’m off, then."
happens."
Harry felt his cheeks warm. “Er, thanks,” he managed, trying to ignore Ron’s snickering. Fleur beamed, said farewell to Hermione as well, and walked away. “How did she know?” asked Harry to his friends.
Harry stared as the Slytherins settled around a table at the other corner of the room. Slughorn stood by them, but he only had eyes for Zabini, ignoring Parkinson, Nott and Draco in the same fashion he had ignored Ron and Hermione.
Before giving Malfoy a chance to say something that would make him kick him off the tower, Harry lifted a finger and sent him a dark glare. "I can't deal with you right now, Malfoy. Stay quiet or so help me God."
Sirius raised an eyebrow. “Why did you agree, then? Just to prove me wrong?"
One look around proved that, indeed, it was a supply cupboard, filled with barrels, buckets, brooms and whatever else Filch might use. "We didn't kiss inside the cave," pointed out Harry with a grin. "And I didn’t know it was a supply cupboard."
Hermione raised an eyebrow at him. “Harry, that’s very kind of you, but I don’t think you, well...."
By the time the twins and the crowd disappeared, Ron was dozing on the couch and Harry had managed to finish his essay. As he rolled up the parchment, Ron suddenly sat straight, looking at the fireplace, “Sirius!"
But before leaving him with Sirius, Dumbledore had asked him to try and get close to the man, and surely Slughorn wouldn’t appreciate his invitation being rejected.
“Your friend lives here?”
“You know what?” said Dean as they had lunch. “Maybe I don’t have to keep studying, I could just leave it like your brothers, Ron.”
“She cornered him after Potions. Zabini seemed startled, but he agreed quite easily.”
vial of poison then,” suggested Ron.
The girl grinned. “Of course I would. Is that even a question?”
“You should stop being a bully, Big D, she sounds like she doesn’t like that.” From Dudley’s expression, Harry could tell he had already thought about doing that, so he added, “And you should do something nice for her.”
. And now Harry was thinking of still going after the trap despite all that. So of course Draco was glaring at him defiantly and of course Harry wrapped his arms around him.
Harry chuckled. “I actually could have used this a few hours ago. My hair wasn’t looking really formal.”
" Ron threw the girls an annoyed look "- haven't been very nice. Won't even talk to her."
, that you
Harry watched as she walked away, catching up to Parkinson, who had stopped to wait for her with a curious expression. Luna seemed as tranquil as ever when Parkinson started talking, so Harry was more intrigued than worried about the odd combination.
Mrs Weasley almost dropped a plate when he walked into the kitchen. “Harry, your hair."
“Are you calling me vain?"
There were people waiting for him, all standing in a circle, faces hidden behind masks and bodies covered in dark robes. And in the middle, face bruised, lip busted and blood trailing down from his nose was a man with long dark hair. Harry wanted something from him, but he refused.
Angelina ignored him, glaring at Ron. “I don’t want to hear nothing else about resigning just because we- We didn’t even lose the match! Get depressed when we do! Are we clear?"
Harry thought about the only wealthy house he knew, “The drawing-room?"
Harry shrugged. He really should be trying harder to find a date, since apparently, the Champions had to open the Ball. But he couldn’t find it in himself to try. “Maybe you should go with Seamus and ask the angry friend.”
But it was all a hypothetical situation because Harry couldn’t tell him about that just as he couldn’t tell him so many other things. “I hate this,” muttered Harry, and Hermione nodded in agreement despite not knowing what he meant.
Mrs.Weasley looked surprised. “Harry, dear, are you seeing someone?”
, and Harry is turning his back on us, dating the son of a Death Eater, who, like his father, is probably also a
“I did,” shrugged Draco. “Until the next Tournament, perhaps,” he added with another grin.
"Er, hi," said Harry.
“Who?” asked Harry, glancing around the entrance to the Great Hall.
The captain seemed angry. “It was that thug Crabbe, he whacked a bludger when he saw you with the snitch." Angelina shook her head, and then seemed to let it go. She grinned and patted him in the back. “But we won! Nicely done, Harry!"
Harry took a deep breath and went to stand next to Malfoy. The blond raised an eyebrow at him but didn't stop crushing his ingredients. Harry looked both ways, making sure Snape was far away from them before he leaned in and whispered, "Are you okay?"
By the time the front door was finally knocked, Harry and the Dursleys were gathered in the living room in silence; Vernon with his newspaper, Petunia with a magazine and Dudley with his eyes fixed on the television.
“Could you-?” Draco shook his head as if to clear it and looked at him rather seriously. “I want to learn the Patronus Charm."
“Would you like a napkin, Harry?” came a smooth voice from his right, startling Harry into attention.
“Yet you are smiling,” countered Harry. “But on a serious note, we don’t have to do that anymore."
. Snape doesn’t usually give extra lessons, does he?"
“Don’t,” whispered Draco, and Harry froze at the tone. “Don’t say it, not now, when every second with you feels like a betrayal to them. I don’t want to hear it.”
“I didn’t tell you about what I was doing that evening,” finished Harry, rubbing the back of his neck. Of course hiding stuff from each other would lead to this and could have led to worse if Draco hadn’t said anything now. Things would have been resolved so much quicker if they had been more open with each other.
. Harry’s eyes fly open as he remembers where he is, who he is with, and he is welcomed to the sight of Draco Malfoy curled up next to him, blond head resting on Harry’s chest, one hand just next to it, and the most peaceful expression Harry has ever seen on his face.
," came Nott's voice. There was a clear warning on his tone, but Draco ignored him, his stormy eyes still fixed on Harry.
’ it said and Harry felt like laughing because he really wasn’t.
“Them?” asked Harry. “You can see something?"
“Yes, that’s the most valuable thing you own, I’d bet. Especially since I made it. So-” His eyebrows furrowed. “Will you stop that?”
As he waited for the exam to begin, Harry tapped his fingers on the desk and glanced around. Draco was sitting near the wall, fiddling with his quill, and happened to turn around just as Harry looked at him. The blond blinked and raised an eyebrow.
Ron grabbed her by the shoulders. “Hermione,” he said gravely. “They barely looked at me. I third-wheeled for three hours while they flirted with each other the entire time. I’m never studying with them again."
“What?!” she blurted, not paying attention to Dumbledore’s speech for perhaps the first time ever in her life. She leaned forwards across the table and whispered harshly, “What do you mean he-? But, but
Harry looked at him. “For both of our sakes, Neville,” he said gravely, thinking about Draco. “I really hope it works.”

January came and went quickly, along with bad news and loads of homework. After the Death Eater breakout from Azkaban that had shaken the magical community, the D.A members had become even more determined to learn. Which was good, but the breakout also gave place to an odd tension between the Slytherin members and the rest. Harry had been worried about a possible conflict, but the matter had been solved rather quickly by Zabini.
“I believe there’s no need for that,” said Draco coldly.
"Yeah, well-" Ron's face had gone red. "Can you blame me? She's perfect."
That makes Harry stop trying to escape. Malfoy looks almost innocent; there’s no sneer on his lips or the more recent frown twisting his features. Instead they are relaxed, pink lips gaped as he breathes, sharp nose pressed into Harry’s shirt, pale eyelashes resting over his cheeks. Disturbing his slumber feels like a crime.
Nott laughed again. “Oh, you are,” he said, giving Draco a pitying smile that turned into one of contempt. “You are, and I have no business associating with the likes of you.” He paid no mind to Draco’s flinching and snatched his wand off Crabbe’s slack grip, then turning around towards the door.
“And that’s okay, sometimes people don’t talk,” continued Sirius, giving him an awkward pat on the arm. “But it will be fine, alright? I’m sure it will, just give him some time now-”
As usual, kudos and comments are very very appreciated, and I'll see you on Thursday!
“I didn’t-” said Harry, but closed his mouth immediately because what could he say?
“Nothing.” Draco shouldered his bag. “I just have to go now."
The notice had appeared in the Common Room’s notice board the morning of the last day of the Easter Holidays, in big bold letters that spoke of its importance and made all the students exchange worried looks.
“Well, summer was quite harsh for him,” said Hermione. “With his father’s trial and the raid on his house, perhaps he changed his mind… I mean, I can’t even begin to imagine how he must be feeling about all this.”
She had come out with a schedule, because of course she did, for practising spells and running laps around the school.
“Did you get stood up, Harry?” asked Zabini without slowing down. He walked next to a serious-looking Theodore Nott, who didn’t spare Harry a single glance.
"Not yet," muttered Malfoy.
“What if Pince comes?” asked Draco, taking a step back until he hit the shelf. “She would kill us."
Draco turned to look at him as if confused, raising an eyebrow as if there was something wrong with the question.
(See the end of the chapter for
Parkinson pouted at him mockingly. “
“And Seamus got scared of her third-year Slytherin friend,” finished Dean, looking very amused.
Draco’s shoulders rose into a tense line, and he didn’t turn around but he didn’t leave either. The silence stretched, like a standstill in the middle of a duel.
“What do you mean you have to go see him?” Harry turned around, finding Ginny giving him an incredulous look. “Harry, don’t tell me- After all he did?!” she asked harshly.  “Shouldn’t you be happy he got what he deserved?”
Draco grinned at him. “I didn’t say anything. It’s healthy hair, I’m sure.” He started shoving Harry towards a corner of the tavern. “Come on then, let’s get this over with so we can-”
"Git." Harry smiled at him. "Good luck."
PD: Just a little advertising, but in case you didn't know, this is the second part of a series! Please make sure to check the first part as well!
“Oh, shut up, it’s not my fault the song is catchy. Besides,” he sent Harry a teasing grin, “I’m sure one of us liked the songs more, right, Harry?”
Hermione sighed. “I know, I shouldn’t have suggested that."
"Yes, Harry, you have told me," said Hermione patiently, in a tone that made obvious she was rolling her eyes again. "Now stop swooning."
He closed his Potions textbook, knowing he wouldn’t get further without asking Malfoy. He glanced towards the Slytherin table, where the blond was writing on a piece of parchment. His grey eyes flickered up, meeting Harry’s. Malfoy gave him a brief tentative smile before turning back to his work.
A sudden pop startled him, followed by two different arms around his shoulders.
“It’s not much,” said Harry, suddenly embarrassed by the gift. “But it reminded me of you, since its-”
“Since when do you need my backup?” retorted Draco, rubbing his leg. “If I find a single bruise, you are dead to me."
. Because I do have one, not like any of you losers."
warn him against it. He should have listened."
Luna smiled dreamily. "We were just here to wish you good luck."
He laughed, then pointing at one of them. "Don't eat those, I think they are from Fred and George."
Hermione nodded. “And explains the Defense book."
“Don’t be silly,” mumbled Ron. “She was walking by, you know I like it when they walk, and the words just slipped out."
"You changed your clothes," noted Harry uselessly, but not without relief. The last thing he wanted was for Draco to get sick out of this. He approached the table but didn't take a seat, instead hovering by one end. He took a deep breath. "Listen, Draco-"
Sirius barked a laugh. “It was Mundungus the one who overhead you, I didn't say a word." He paused, looking a bit serious. “Which reminds me, don’t tell anyone that I knew and didn't stop you, alright? I’m already in trouble for my little escapade."
“Not anymore,” said Mr Weasley, scratching his chin. “Did he say anything else?"
“...Draco,” let out Harry as the blond stood up. The jump his heart had done when he saw him turned into a pitch fall when he took him in and noticed. Noticed just how pale Draco looked, how red was the rim around his eyes, how dark the circles under them.
“Well, that was...” started Hermione once Umbridge stopped and a few hesitant claps were given before Dumbledore went back to his speech.
After finishing, Harry fell silent, looking at the blond expectantly. Draco stayed quiet as if taking everything in. He looked troubled, but there was no mistrust on his eyes, and that relieved Harry.
Harry was honestly tired of not being told things.
“They didn’t tell us. Not directly,” said Fred, taking out a- “I present to you,
“What?! You haven’t read those?” Ron seemed perplexed. “Me and Ginny grew up with those! Babbity Rabbity, The Hopping Pot!”
” said the girl, tapping the glass jar calmly despite the trembling beetle inside. “Afternoon.”
Am I obssessed about Draco's name being the same as a constellation? Yes. Will I ever stop? No
“Can you stop sighing to yourself every two seconds?” said Ron, giving him a light shove. “It’s getting annoying.”
?” asked Sirius, breaking into a bark-like laugh when Harry didn’t say anything. “Oh, Godric, that’s-"
"If it's something, I only think of you when I look at it, and not of some dragon,” said Harry, being rewarded with a pleased smile. Harry grinned back until he realised something. "Wait, it
The Gryffindors had woken up to a menacing sign on the common room notice board, just next to the posters looking for testers that Fred and George had hanged. The Education Decree 24 not only disbanded all existing groups but also banned those without approval under the threat of expulsion.
Sirius grimaced. “What can I say? I definitely don’t see him running around with you and your illegal group, for starters."
“I mean, do you have any idea of what you would like to do?” asked Harry, reaching for a chocolate of the box Draco’s mother had sent him for Easter. The blond hadn’t gone home, choosing to stay to study for the upcoming exams. Of course, Harry was also part of the reason and he felt very proud of that.
“Most of the time,” said Harry, thinking back to his third-year, where the woman had actually shown some talent on the field. Then he thought about his last class and grimaced. “Umbridge had a field day with her on Monday. Even I felt sorry for her."
Home.
Ron relaxed and went back to eat, this time biting into a small cake.
Harry had no idea. He had begun to notice Nott more, in the same way he had kept an eye out for Snape during his first year, but came up with nothing important. All he knew about Nott is that he was the only member of Draco’s group that never approached Harry when Draco did or even talked to him in any way. He was also the only one that hadn’t join the D.A, and Harry wasn’t sure if it was because he had rejected the offer or because he hadn’t been offered in the first place.
“I assume that means there’s nothing outside,” said Draco and Harry added another line to his mental list of sayings wizards didn’t use. If it got any longer, he could write a book and give it to Draco.
“Does it look the same?"
"I know," said Harry softly, reaching to hold Draco's elbows with his hands, then rubbing up the back of his arms. "Why didn't you?"
anymore."
“What do you mean?” whispered Ron, blinking when Harry looked up at him with a raised eyebrow. “He’s been suspiciously quiet for a while now."
“But why?” asked Harry. From what he knew, the Wizengamot was a huge deal.
All but one of them, who sat on a table near a window, chin resting in one hand as the other hovered over a parchment with a quill.
“I was raised as a muggle. I didn’t even know I was a wizard until I received my letter.” Harry smiled, opening his mouth to tell him about the raining letters and Hagrid's apparition. But that would involve telling him about the Dursleys taking away the letters too.
“Well,” started Harry, feeling a bit puzzled. “Because I already know how it has to go, like how it has to feel-" Harry blinked at the realization. “That’s brilliant."
“That man... He taught Molly and me.” Mr Weasley huffed in annoyance. “Didn’t give the time of day to those that didn’t have an important name or such. But he was not a bad teacher by any means, so don’t worry, Hermione, you will be in good hands.”
Draco trailed behind them, making sure no one strayed from the group. He grinned at Harry as they passed by them.
“Don’t you have something else to do?” said Draco without taking his eyes off the essay. “Instead of staring at me."
“You are surprisingly superficial.” Despite his words, Draco smiled smugly. “But yes, it would be. And there have been incidents before, so only my father tends to them."
the blond didn't impede him from
"No."
The doors to the Requirement Room had just opened to let the last group out when a series of gasps and a new set of steps made Harry look up from his parchment in alarm.
Malfoy fully stopped obliterating the unicorn horns to look at Harry in confusion. "What?"
“Paint?"
The silence seemed to stretch uncomfortably, and Harry found himself calming down, enough for him to look up. He was surprised that Malfoy hadn't jumped at the chance to taunt him, and by the frown on the blond's face, he wasn't the only one.
Harry sighed and sat up. “Well, I said that I couldn’t go to Honeydukes with them-”
“Not only the eyes, huh,” grinned Sirius. “And I think Ron mentioned something about the Hospital Wing-"
“Like what?”
Ron ignored him. “Was the door open or closed?"
"Of course you will," said Harry reassuringly. She was a great girl, she would definitely find someone good too. Unless she didn't want to. Harry blinked. "Unless you don't want to date anyone at all, that's fine too."
“...Dumbledore could be wrong.”
“Myrtle!” called Harry. “I have to get the egg underwater and then what?”
“...Harry, we have to leave,” said Hermione after what felt like minutes but had to be longer, as Harry snapped out of it and noticed the table clearing out. Across the Hall, Blaise was doing the same for Draco, whose eyes flickered up but didn’t meet Harry’s as he stood up and left with them.
“Ten points from Ravenclaw, Fawcett.” A girly squeal broke the silence. “And ten points from Hufflepuff too, Stebbins!”
Malfoy scowled. “Perhaps I should have.”
“Show him,” said Moody, startling Harry a bit. It was weird to think that he didn’t really know the man. “He’ll find out soon enough."
Ginny’s right eye twitched at the comment, but Slughorn didn’t notice that either, too eager to get the conversation going where he wanted. “Now that we all know each other, Marcus was just about to tell us about his uncle Damocles, Damocles Belby, who, as you might know, is an outstanding wizard.”
"What am I supposed to do with this?"
, Ron,” said Hermione. “It has to be something
?” repeated Harry. “Does he think we are going to build an army or something?"
"You are related to Draco?" asked Harry.
The mental image of his godfather dressed in a bright red and gold suit made Harry snort. Then he looked down at the scarf between his hands and felt the fabric again. It was probably the softest thing Harry had ever felt. “I like it," he decided.
His search was interrupted by the apparition of Padma and Parvati, clad in turquoise and shocking pink robes respectively, followed closely by McGonagall.
Draco looked at him funny. “Did you run all the way here because you heard I got jinxed? Wow, Harry,” he smiled, “I feel loved.”
Sirius looked troubled, “I don’t like this Harry. I don’t think I ever will." He raised a hand before Harry could protest. “I can only trust you with this and ask you that, when the moment comes, you remember where your loyalties have to be. Please, promise me that."
Harry felt that
he was talking about. Part of him knew he should be amused by the whole event, but he wasn't. Not at all.
Ron seemed reluctant to answer. “I’ve been practising, because,” he paused, as if unsure. “I want to try out for Keeper, since I have a good broom now, and all."
Harry began trying to catch Draco’s attention, either by holding his gaze or smiling at him. It was extremely hard because the blond avoided even looking in his direction most of the time. The first time he managed had been during Potions on Friday. Their eyes had met across the room, over the fumes of a cauldron, and, before the grey eyes could leave again, Harry smiled. It was brief and probably very awkward, but it worked. Draco blinked at him, before looking down at his cauldron again. It wasn’t something huge, but it did feel like a change, and Harry had already known it would take time. And he was ready for that.
, Harry." He looked darkly at the entrance of the cave and raised his voice slightly. “A very
“Not a troll, huh?” said Harry, wiggling his eyebrows.
"So loyal," mumbled Ginny. It was honestly startling to see people dropping matters as Warrington and Bulstrode had done, but Harry was glad they did.
,” called Harry, unsure if he meant it.
rushed to open their books.
"Fine," sighed Harry.
Rita Skeeter smirked at them as they came close to the table, eyes glinting in an almost hungry way and fingers cringing as if looking for her acid-green Quick-Notes Quill. “Well, isn’t this a lovely surprise?"
“Mind sharing with the class?” They turned around, finding Ron giving them an almost offended look from where he was seated. Hermione looked at Harry, asking for permission, and passed on the short letter when Harry just shrugged. There wasn’t much to see after all.
“I must ask you to accompany me on an errand before,” said Dumbledore enigmatically before turning to nod at the Dursleys. “Until we meet again.”
“But we can trust Smith?"
“Mate, remember last year? He tried to have Buckbeak killed, for Merlin’s sake!"
Ron gaped at her. “Viktor Krum reads romance novels? What-”
“Yeah,
not.”
Harry advanced. "Draco-"
God. Draco would be even more upset than Hermione. He would call Hagrid insane, to which Harry wouldn’t be able to argue against this time, and then call Harry insane too for agreeing to
She did. “
Draco hummed. “Not sure what you mean, Granger."
Harry was probably smiling dumbly. “Good.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Handsy," mused Draco, looking a bit flustered. "I'm trying to learn, you know."
Hermione pursed her lips, “He hasn’t, but-”
He immediately covered his mouth in shock and turned towards Hermione and Ron slowly, already picturing the face of utter betrayal and disbelief on Ron’s face. That day, however, luck seemed to be on his side, because Ron and Hermione were still bickering about house-elves and Merlin knows what else. Or, to be more accurate, Hermione was lecturing Ron on the situation of the house-elves, while the ginger groaned into a scone. Ron caught his eyes on him and grasped at the chance to change the topic with the desperation of a drowning man.
"Professor-" His smile died when he noticed the man's blackened hand. "What happened?"
“I see,” said Draco sadly. “So you can’t."
of a father’s steps-"
Harry cut him off. “Alright, so he gives speeches and doesn’t lie. So far it’s better than Fudge, so what’s the matter?”
"I guess he wanted to apologise for what happened during class." Harry grimaced, already regretting mentioning the man.
,” said a posh voice that made Harry crack a smile and turn around. Draco had his blue scarf on, the colour bringing out his eyes perfectly as he gave Harry a white grin. “Hi."
Draco met his gaze with a sneer. “Got anything to say, Scarhead?” he said, the barest intonation in the nickname almost making Harry lose the battle with the smile tugging at his lips.
“So chivalrous,” mused Draco, as if he hadn't been fishing for that. He grinned at Harry. “Very well. Shall we go, then?” he asked brightly, then frowning when Harry gave him a grimace, “Unless you have something else to do."
“Crush, not cut?” Harry read under his breath. Although the official instructions clearly said to cut the sopophorous bean, one look around told him that it wasn’t an easy task. Ernie’s bean slipped from under his knife and flew across the classroom, hitting the back of Padma’s head, and even Hermione was scowling at hers.
Parkinson's nose wrinkled. “I thought I might ask, do you remember what happened in our first class with Mad-Eye?”
“What is it?” she asked, visibly startled. “Are you alright?"
“I got your letter,” said Sirius, once the three of them checked the room was empty and knelt before the fireplace. Harry ignored Hermione’s glare and told Sirius about his scar. The man hummed, “I doubt it’s anything to worry about. Didn’t it hurt last year as well? Must hurt more often now that he is up and running again."
The blond’s pale face went pink. “Oh, shut up. I’m not worried,” he said, looking away. “I just can’t let you embarrass the whole school.”
Remus waved a hand in dismissal. “Nothing you have to worry about, Harry. Now, come,” He bent over to grab the trunk and then straightened up with ease. “We don’t want to be late.”
Harry shrugged him off and walked further into the room. It looked better now than it had last year, almost as if time were slowly reversing every day that passed, sending it back to its golden age, when it had once been the most beautiful room of the house.
It was the sudden approach of a shark what startled him out of it. He was running out of time.
. Lucius in Azkaban, Narcissa devastated, Draco...
Harry grinned. “He has a point, Ron."
The wind howled on Harry’s ears, the field nothing but a blur as he zoomed through it. He and Draco were neck and neck, almost close enough to crash with each other. The Snitch seemed to twitch in air, moving back and forwards in place in a matter of seconds. Harry extended his arm at the same time Draco did. The golden glint moved again. It was mere centimetres away now.
Hagrid had been concerned about him, throwing Hermione a questioning look. She had only shaken her head sadly, and Hagrid could only pat him in the shoulder and try to distract him with the Third Task.
"Is the Golden Hero betraying his duties in exchange for kisses?" he asked with pretended shock. "The wizarding world is doomed".
The match went on, and Harry’s search grew frantic as Ron let through two other goals and the crown groaned, but the snitch was nowhere in sight as he circled the field again. He crossed paths with Draco, who had been doing the same, receiving a grin that would have made him linger if it weren’t for the new goal Pucey had scored.
“Yes, it’s-” Draco looked around as if to make sure the rest weren’t paying much attention to them. Satisfied, he leaned closer to whisper in Harry’s ear, “I saw you in the station, with a
“But you don’t have to avoid them anymore. Surely you have better things to do than hiding at the owlery,” said Malfoy bitterly, looking away from him.
The silence lasted only a few moments, until Parkinson seemed to snap out of shock and recover her posture. “Draco, he’s just-” She grimaced and reconsidered her words. “I’ll go talk to him. Vince, Greg, let’s go.” The boys didn’t immediately follow, too busy throwing puzzled glances towards Draco, and Parkinson had to drag them out of the room.
“Oh, then it’s all good,” said Draco brightly, smiling thinly when the other two blinked at him. “Why are you looking at me like that? Of course it’s alright. Who cares about the
“How bad could it be?” said Ron.
“Right,” said Malfoy, looking away. “See you then, Harry,” he said quickly, before rushing down the stairs.
“It’s safe, don’t worry,” assured Harry.
“It might be in your best interests to move somewhere else as well,” said Dumbledore, not pausing to hear the man’s retort. “For the meantime, I have placed two members of the Order in the vicinity for your protection.”
Once they were all set and the car started moving, Remus closed the partition between them and the Aurors and looked at Harry. “The Ministry has given you top-grade security status-”
“Good answer,” said Draco with a grin. “Before I go, I have to ask.” He seemed to hesitate, biting his lower lip for a moment before continuing, “How did your firecall go? Do you feel more at ease now?”
Harry shook his head energetically. “No, no one. I don’t- Er, no.”
“Know?” completed Cedric with a smile. “I’d like to say it was due to my observant nature, but in all honesty is because of Viktor.” He let out a brief laugh. “Ended up being quite a gossip that one, against all odds.”
“Heliopaths,” provided Harry.
He found himself alone most of the time. Ron being a prick and not even glancing at him, and Hermione trying to keep up with both of them and her study schedule.
Ron laughed and hugged her back. “And did you see her catch? She left Cho in the dust! She was so angry she threw her broom!” He raised a finger at Harry. “You better watch out, your spot is not so sure anymore.”
“Yes, that’s him,” said Harry.
and then look at me accusingly. And I’ll have none of it!” declared Sirius. “So you and I are going to prepare something nice and hearty, and at the first comment about my maturity, I’ll let her know we did. That will show her!”
PSA: This is Part 2 of a Series!
Before Harry could even say hi, the blond had crossed the space and sat next to him, giving Harry only time enough to register that the grey eyes were actually silver before pulling him into a kiss. Harry forgot about the hour he had to wait and lost himself to the soft and warm sensation, wondering how he could have gone so long without it.
There was another moment of silence as Hagrid blinked at him. “Yes,” he finally said in an odd tone, nodding his head vigorously. “The thestrals. They were a bit hungry." Hagrid chuckled awkwardly. "Uhm, did you like ‘em?”
“Chins up,” said a commanding voice behind Harry. Coming from the other side of the Hall, Parkinson led a group of new Slytherins, who followed her like soldiers, giggling at each other as they kept their heads up.
Harry kicked him. “So, Hermione, Griffith claw?"
“Why?” asked Lee.
“No, mother. It’s fine,” said Draco in a cool voice that added to the picture of stillness that was not
“What do you mean you know he’s not?”
“Oh,” said Harry dejectedly.
"Because you provoked him!" snapped Ginny. "Showing him that!"
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Then?"
Silence stretched as neither of them spoke.
Draco came to his side, Myrtle floating behind him. They watched as Harry knelt beside the bath and submerged the Golden Egg under the warm water. Draco placed a hand on his back, and send a withering look at Myrtle when she started to come closer. She giggled and kept still.
“The first years!” exclaimed Hermione, standing up. “We have to show them the way! Let’s go!"
Before Harry could open his mouth to ask, in a very alarmed voice, what had happened, the answer came flying around the corner just a few meters behind Draco. Made of red, orange and yellow fireworks, a dragon was on his boyfriend's tail, intangible jaws opening and closing as if wanting to swallow him whole.
Harry could only stare back, trying to come up with the correct answer. For him, being a blood traitor wasn’t bad at all. It was something good, even. But how could he say that when Draco seemed so shaken by the very idea?
"Shit." That's what he looked like. He dragged a hand over his face, then raised it to push back his hair and look at his scar. It didn't hurt at the moment, didn't bring any dreams, but right then Harry would have done a lot to know what Voldemort was thinking.
“Oh, right. You mentioned something like that at the Ministry too,” said Mr Weasley, sitting down again.
"Sure."
The fur is soft and alive under his fingers, and without as much difficulty as he first expected, Harry falls asleep with the sound of another breathing next to his.
“What is going on here?!" came Remus' voice, loud enough to break through the ringing. He and Sirius had appeared next to Harry, the first stopping between him and Mundungus.
Harry frowned at that. "Ron, I don't think-" He paused, eyes doubling back on a blond head. Nope. Wrong shade. He kept looking. "I'm sure she's fine."
, Harry. That wasn’t even a position until now. I’d rather not get on her bad side."
“Oh, did he?” asked Sirius, looking at Harry with amusement.
thought Harry. “Draco, this is Sirius-"
The suddenness of the movement made Harry turn around hopefully, deflating when he saw it was just a group of younger girls. One of them, that he was sure was in Gryffindor, pushed her way to the front and smiled at him.
around the floor thinking about where to go next. There was no need for thinking now. He only had to follow Draco’s steps, and let himself be lead wherever the blond wanted. It was easy, like flying, and for a moment Harry felt as if he had been absorbed by the same gracefulness the blond always portrayed.
waiting, lest they go back to ignoring you again,” spat Malfoy bitterly at Harry’s retreating back.
Draco opened his mouth to speak but closed it when Grubbly-Plank passed by the groups, handing sketches made by other students for them to correct. Once she was gone, he turned towards him again. “At what time do you think she will let you leave?"
Harry flushed. “Yes, but then the cup turned out to be a portkey, and, you know.” Harry sighed “They are probably going to keep it away.”
them,” tried Harry.
He didn't know who moved first, or if both of them did, but the small gap between them was closed and a pair of soft lips were on his, and Harry couldn't bring himself to think of anything else as he fluttered his eyes close.
“Naturally,” grinned the blond, giving his hand another squeeze before stepping back. “See you later, Scarhead, and do not fall off your broom. At least not before your actual practice, I want to be there to see that."
"Just break him out, you asshole," muttered Harry at the reflection. But that wasn't a good idea either. As long as his father stayed away from them, Draco and his mother were safe. Safer. Even if it hurt them.
After Fred and George were dragged out of the room by Madame Pomfrey sporting long beards, Harry glanced around the room, trying to figure out who else would step forwards. Instead, his eyes crossed paths with a pair of grey ones, which seemed to have been doing the same. The grey eyes seemed startled for a second before the pale eyebrows over them furrowed in suspicion.
Harry hummed, bringing his tankard up. “For you, maybe,” he mumbled against the rim, earning himself a light kick in the shin. He lowered it and grinned at Draco, “Fine, let’s go there. In Summer.”
“No, I mean, I was going to ask you about him. How is he?” Blaise came to a sudden stop, dropping his arm. Harry continued, “I haven’t spoken to him since July.”
“Ah! A Gryffindor Champion! That would be great,” mused Seamus.
“How could I forget?” asked Draco, letting go of his hand as the crowd became thinner. “Potter almost died on that occasion. Imagine how
,” said Draco.
“I should-”
“That’s not what I asked,” cut off Harry. He searched for his eyes again, trying to read what was in them. Because he would do anything for Draco if he asked, even something as painful as letting him go, but he needed to know. “Do you want to end this?”
Harry hummed. "Not really."
it is. The hair.”
Malfoy.
Harry saw Draco fly past Crabbe, pausing for a short second, so brief it would be easily missed if one hadn’t been staring at him.
“But we didn’t see Mundungus,” mumbled Hermione, looking a bit sullen.
“I would wait sitting if I were you,” said Goyle, a hint of amusement on his deep voice.
“Listen, I’ll pester Snivellus about it next time I see him, alright?” Sirius spoke up again, giving Harry’s shoulder a squeeze. “I’ll mention that Draco hasn’t been in contact, but if you want my opinion, I think it’s probably because of Narcissa.”
“Er, no,” says Harry smartly, wondering if he should be pushing the other away. Malfoy merely sighs and raises to his elbows, letting Harry catch a glimpse of his bare chest, his mind fully stopping for a second before he notices Malfoy is curling his arms around him and shivering.
“Harry, I’m not
Thanks for reading, I hope you liked it!
The whistle of the train cut him off. Mrs Weasley jumped from where she was holding a conversation with her husband and Remus, and went towards them. “You better hurry! Have a lovely term, Ron, Ginny, Hermione-” She gave the three of them a hug before turning to Harry. “You too, Harry. If you ever need-”
Harry shoved him. “Don’t be a git. Where have you been, anyway?"
Harry frowned but didn’t rise to the bait. “Are you alright?"
Harry had only gone to the owlery once, but it had been empty. The owls had looked down at him, as if reproachful, and he had stared back for a moment before leaving.
"What are you staring at the map for?" asked Ron, trying to take a peek over his shoulder. "Is it safe to go out now?"
Sorry for the wait! I couldn't find time to post before, but here it is! I hope you enjoyed the chapter! Please let me know your thoughts! <3
"Harry," said Lupin diplomatically. "How did this happen?"
Unaware of Harry’s dismay, Draco picked out one truffle covered with dark powder, then turning to Harry with a smile and raising it to his lips in a silent offer. Harry blinked, accepting it without taking his eyes off Draco, which meant that the instant grimace he made wasn’t lost to the other.
cousin knew it would go wrong."
“All the Hufflepuffs are going on about Diggory,” said Seamus, seemingly not very happy. “I wouldn’t have thought he would risk losing his good looks.”
, did you know?” Myrtle sighed. “Two years ago he-”
“Ron!” hissed Harry, feeling his face warm up. But the damage was already done.
“Sorry, Hermione, there’s no time.” The man was grinning wildly now, eyes sparkling with anticipation and Harry wanted to smack him. Before he could say anything else, the man was already standing up, only his shoeless feet visible. “I’ll contact you later!”
(See the end of the chapter for
She walked away, but Zabini threw Harry one last look before going after her. The same one he had thrown at him after giving him a copy of the Daily Prophet.
“Yeah, he is.” Ginny sighed and looked at him with a thin smile. “Malfoy isn’t bad either. I do have to admit that at the start I thought you had gone crazy, but,” She shrugged, “He really seems different now.”
It puzzled Harry and made him rethink his answer. The reason he had omitted three names hadn't been pity, as Skeeter viciously suggested, nor fear of Draco breaking up with him, like Hermione did. No, back at the Three Broomsticks Harry had only been thinking about Draco's face whenever he received a letter from home, or when he spoke about his childhood.
“No, Sirius, they do this time,” said Harry. “Lucius Malfoy recognized you at the platform. He must have been the one to tell the Ministry."
Draco always gave them a wide berth, silver eyes purposely never passing over them, as if repelled by their very existence. The Room hadn’t wheeled them closer again since their first meeting, and Harry wasn’t sure if it was due to Draco or himself.
“Hi,” said Harry, parting from the wall. “I thought you weren’t allowed to say that."
“All right everyone!” clapped Angelina, walking in already changed into her red robes. “Let’s get to it. Fay and Katie, grab the ball crate for us. And, just so you all know, there are a few people out there on the stands, I want you all to ignore them, alright?"
“We can help, mate,” said Ron. “Just tell us.”
I'll see you soon! Happy Holidays in advance!!
He opened his eyes. It was still dark, and he was walking down the long corridor of the Department of Mysteries again. The door opened to another corridor and at the end of it was a room with many shelves, filled to the top with white spheres that looked like Trelawney’s crystal balls.
“If I’d say yes?" asked Harry.
. He looked at Mrs Weasley's sad eyes. Now he understood why she had asked about him.
Ron choked, his pale face going red. Harry patted him on the back, sliding a glass of water towards him. After downing it entirely, Ron spoke with a strained voice. “I’m not- I’m not envious of him. Not another word.”
Harry looked towards the table Draco shared with Crabbe and Goyle. The blond was already measuring his ingredients carefully, a focused expression on his face.
“Put. Your. Hand. On. My. Waist. Mister. Malfoy,” deadpanned Harry.
The group rushed through the station, probably being an odd sight to the other passengers, for the old-looking Tonks and the dark dog pacing next to them. Sirius seemed quite happy of being out of the house, wagging his tail and barking at passers-by. Once they crossed the wall to the platform, Harry’s attention left the group completely. Even if the station couldn’t have been more packed than it was every year, Harry felt that it was too crowded. When Lupin, Moody and the rest of the Weasleys joined them, he hadn’t found Draco yet.
Hermione looked up at him. "Not what?"
” cooed one of them.
Dinner that night became a small party. Mrs Weasley had hung a scarlet banner that read
, Granger," interrupted a voice behind them, followed by a set of snickers familiar enough to make all of them grimace in anticipation of the bad things it preceded. Once it had been insults and mean commentary, now it meant that but also fewer points for your House and sometimes even detention.
He wasn’t sure how he had done it either, he just knew that one second he was blurting out a
I forgot that its Thursday, so I'm late oops! Hope you liked the chapter! As usual, kudos and comments are very very appreciated! See you on Monday!
Harry took his sweet time pretending to straighten his clothes. "What was what?" he asked, trying to keep his tone neutral and begging that Snape was talking about his latest Voldemort dream and not the very real memory of Draco kissing him before leaving for his common room after a long study session.
Some time must have passed when he woke up because the conversation had moved from numbers to words again. He didn’t open his eyes, listening in their conversation as fingers thread through his hair.
“Right now, buying me time to talk to you.” Harry grinned proudly when the man closed his mouth and frowned. “So shut up.”
Harry rolled his eyes and walked to the door, checking the map just in case before opening it and letting the four students standing outside in. “You are late."
“What did Kreacher say?”
Malfoy pulled a disgusted face. "As if I would ever cheer for a
George shook his head. “There are no rules that prohibit making or testing products. I know my rights."
That didn't make any sense. "Umbridge's stupidity affects all of us," said Harry. "It's not just about defending ourselves, it's about the examinations as well. Didn't you hear Parvati?"
Most of the class went to look at the course aims again, and shortly after other hands were raised and whispers started going along the classroom as Umbridge explained herself.
“Wait, Rita Skeeter was involved?” asked Bill.
The wand of the dummy flew through the air, and Harry walked over to gather it and put it back in place. "That was good," he said, returning to Draco. "But you are losing speed with the arm movement. It's too, uhm..." Harry fumbled for a word.
Harry wondered how Sirius would take praise from a Slytherin.
“He is
“And he would start giving me detention."
“Sorry,” said Harry again, because something about the blond’s expression wasn’t right.
“Make it twenty-five, then,” resolved Draco easily, cocking his head to the side. “And I can go on and on. I don’t know what you are playing at, Potter, but perhaps think of your housemates. A few points more and there will be nothing to take away.”
Harry didn’t answer immediately, transfixed by his eyes once again. It was rather mesmerizing how they could go from smooth silver to unyielding steel in a matter of seconds. “Yes,” he resolved, grabbing both of Draco’s hands to pull him closer. “But, you didn’t need to call a favour, I would have done so anyway."
there,” she said rather harshly.
It was clear, from the glare he received, that Draco didn't share his amusement. "No, it's not funny, Potter.” Draco crossed his arms and scowled at him when Harry smiled. "It's not funny at all! That thing chased me for hours!"
“Of course I have,” said Hermione, rather defensively. She glanced at Harry, sighing when he nodded at her to keep going, “I was wondering if you managed to invert the last chart-"
“Apparently they overheard us because Parkinson turned around and sneered at the Chocolate Frogs we had grabbed,” explained Hermione, pointing at the blue box, “ Zabini told us we ought to grab some of those."
“Right. So, what were you going to tell me?”
Zabini laughed loudly, startling the nearby Slytherins. Draco swatted him in the arm but kept his lower face hidden behind a pale hand, his shoulders trembling. Harry hurried to wipe the juice from his chin and looked away before he embarrassed himself any further.
"Yeah?" said Harry, feeling lost. "What did you think I was talking about?"
"Me neither," confessed Harry. If Hermione had been angry, then Ron would probably be too. And then there was Sirius. He sighed and tried to compose himself. "But we can figure it out together," he said, gently squeezing his boyfriend's arms. "I mean, you said it yourself once. That the people that matter have your back? I have yours."
, Potter, I don’t like you at all,” he says harshly. “I wasn’t going to attack you last night, you could have left- you
Except that the chandeliers were broken, the fireplace was dirty and the piano- Actually, the piano was just fine, just a bit dusty. The one at Draco's house would definitely not be dusty, knowing Draco.
Sirius had warned him; it
The blond looked troubled. “Harry, there’s something I think I should tell you."
"Worked it out," countered Hermione.
“OH NO YOU DON’T, LADDIE!”
“Children use it to draw, it has different colours."
The blond hummed, tapping his fingers on the stairs’ railing. “Meet me at the library during break tomorrow. Let’s see what I can do."
Hope you liked the chapter! See you on Thursday!
He didn’t tell them how much it hurt every time they passed by each other at the halls, and the blond wouldn’t even spare him a glance. Or when their eyes met during Potions, and the grey ones would only pause for a second before continuing their path.
“He’s
Draco Malfoy, the same one that used to saunter around, chin raised with pride due to stupid ideals of blood purity; that Draco Malfoy had been kicked out of his high throne and thrown to the ground he had once sneered at, what was in his eyes below him, below Harry, even below muggles.
"He's been concerned about you two," explained Hermione. "When I told him you weren't talking anymore he was very upset"
There was another hiccup. “What goes around, right?” Mundungus leaned over and tapped the photo with his stubby finger. Tapped Draco’s face with his
“You fancy her,” said Harry in horror.
They watched from the stairs how the stubbly hand of Umbridge kept searching around, as if sure there had been something there.
Harry frowned. “Me? But I hate Malfoy.”
" muttered Ron. "So complicated."
they were good looking.”
Almost wanted to publish this tomorrow so the dates would match (lol).
"Not chivalrous at all," declared Draco, stepping back and tugging Harry by the hand without meeting his eyes. “Come on, you are breaking curfew," he muttered.
“Hogwarts’ two biggest enemies,” mused Fred. “
“Parkinson,” said Hermione, hands clasped together on the table. "What do you want?"
Harry hummed. "Well, he hasn't predicted my painful death yet, so yes."
Hermione hummed. “Well, what is clear is that he can’t be leaving the house anymore." She pursed her lips. “Dumbledore
Draco hummed. “Just be careful, Harry. I’m sure she is waiting for a chance to make you miserable, especially now that she has more ways to do so."
"And- Malfoy is on the move! Is it the snitch? Chang follows just behind!"
“Maybe Private Drive is alright," deadpanned Harry.
“Harry, live a little! You are acting like Moony.” Sirius grinned at Remus, who just gave him a glare in return. “Oh,
Harry grimaced. Draco
“Definitely the toughest one yet, but I’m sure I managed,” Hermione’s smile turned into a grin, “And I’m sure
“You have been a bit weird lately-” Draco gave him a serious look. “More precisely, the past week. I do understand if it’s something you cannot talk about, but if it’s related to me-"
“Where is Pig?” asked Ron once he reached them.
“Do you have a question on the chapter, dear?” asked Umbridge after ignoring Hermione for several minutes.
"Not yet," lied Harry. He flickered an imaginary bug, and pull,ed his hand back, not-so-accidentally brushing a delicate cheek.
“She called her a toad?"
With that in mind, he approached the shelf next to his bed and took out only those he thought could come up handy, to then store them on his trunk along the new ones for the term and the one Tonks had gifted him. He dutifully examined all of them, pausing only when he reached the small blue book. He took it out and held it in one hand, his thumb stroking the cover.
It had been exactly one week since The Quibbler’s article had been published, the morning after their victory against Hufflepuff. A copy of the magazine had arrived to Harry’s hands along with numerous letters that varied from calling him insane to expressing their utmost support. Knowing that there were more people out there that believed him felt truly good, but Harry would have to admit that watching Umbridge going around the hallways, looking irritated and snapping at people that talked about the article, was what really had made his week.
“No,” answered Harry, then berating himself for that when everyone gave him a weird look, with the exception of Hermione that looked concerned. “He didn’t mention the exact sentence and I didn’t want to press for details, you know…”
“I’m not going to Dumbledore,” said Harry, and it was final. “Listen, it’s just two more days. I can endure it."
isn’t dating anyone. And if he is, it’s probably just another
"Is that allowed?" blurted another.
“What are you doing?” asked Harry, trying to decipher the contents of one of them. He quickly noticed they were the same Draco had been staring at until just a few moments ago. Harry had thought that he would take a break from studying after the match, but he had been wrong.
"I see you didn't drown," drawled a posh voice behind them.
“All the attendees of your
“He is what?!” exclaimed Ron, halting on his steps. “I didn’t know."
Malfoy shook his head. “Friends with Potter.”
For a moment Draco only gave him an odd look, as if confused by the question and then by Harry himself. Then he hummed. “Sometimes I forget there are things you don’t know,” he said softly, as if thinking aloud.
“That’s brilliant,” said Harry, noticing how his friend seemed relieved by that. “Wish I could go watch the tryouts, but, you know..."
Ron groaned. “We will be fine."
“Too sweet.”
Malfoy was an absolute git - it was a fact-, and his face was very punchable - Still objective, Hermione would definitely agree. His face also was very pointy and very pale, like Ron said. But, unlike what Ron said, he didn’t look like a pointy goblin, because Harry had seen goblins and they were absolutely hideous, with too-large-for-their-face features, too sharp angles and creepy shiny black eyes.
“The ballroom?” tried Harry, figuring that’s what rich people have in their houses. Or at least what the ones on stories do.
" replied Harry.
Harry reeled back. “Dumbledore?"
Ron nodded. “Dad said they only searched the premises until the day of the trial and they found nothing. As far as he knows, they didn’t return.” He rubbed his neck. “So, it’s not because of them that he is not writing.”
Harry hummed. “Yeah."
The girl gaped. "But, Professor-"
Harry shrugged. "It turned out well," he grinned up at him.
; the neutral tone that wasn’t normal, the blank look in his face and the stillness of his eyes that were so unlike him as the dark circles under them-
“I don’t think he’s dead,” said Remus, but his gaze had gone to the Wanted Posters stuck to the walls of the destroyed building. There were faces and names Harry recognized, like Bellatrix Lestrange and her malicious grin, or Artemius Nott and his bony face that reminded of his son. But the one Remus was looking at was someone unfamiliar.
Harry nodded, gesture pointless because Draco’s attention was solely focused on the silver stag as if it were telling him a very important secret. Harry shuffled on his feet, nervous but transfixed by the odd scene, and the way the light seemed to reflect on Draco’s eyes.
Harry grinned, feeling strangely smug. "Are you going to take points from me?"
Malfoy licks his lips, his tongue a flash of pink that draws Harry’s eye, and then his mouth shapes into a circle, “Only Snape.”
Draco frowned. “Of course I will, but perhaps not for the first days. I reckon my mother will need some help and she’s hoping we can see him before the trial.”
It wasn’t until an hour later that the compartment door opened quite harshly, startling Neville into dropping his frog. Draco stood there, looking irritated and as handsome as ever. “Potter,” he said, flashing a white grin that made Harry sit up straight.
"What the-?"
“And a letter would be pretty solid,” said Ron.
” muttered Harry, feeling his face warm. A tail wagged against his side and he looked at Sirius.
"They?" asked a hushed voice, the only warning Harry got before there were hands circling his arm. "What did he say liked the dark?"
Of course not, I’m not a savage." He frowned at Harry when he started laughing. “What is wrong with you two?"
Harry didn’t want a break. He wanted to hit something, preferably Mundungus Fletcher’s face, but he let Sirius draw him away from the escalating discussion. The door closed behind them just as everyone else joined in, muffling the noise and leaving them to the silence of the corridor.
“Exactly! 10 points for Gryffindor,” said Hagrid. “Now, thestrals-"
Hermione spoke first. “He will come around, Harry,” she said softly. “I’m sure of it."
Until it was ruined by the sound of harsh laugher approaching, that is. Recognizing the voices of Dudley and his friends, Harry sat up straight, dropping his smile for a neutral expression.
“That’s my business and my business alone, Theodore."
Harry tries to shift away, but the mouth curls up to bare its teeth and the wolf growls. "I can't sleep here," protests Harry harshly. Ron would probably freak out when he doesn't see him in the morning, Snape would probably come by early, the bed was old and dusty, and, "You will jinx me if I stay here!"
“I thought you were enjoying the Ball,” said Harry, as they passed by a large stone statue.
"Potter," said Malfoy stiffly after the silence prolonged a bit more. "Are you planning to come here every time you have your picture taken?"
“No,” said Harry quickly, trying to read him. “Did you see what I saw?"
"Oh," said Malfoy, and Harry
Harry glanced at his side, where Sirius had joined him and was too looking at the tapestry. The expression on his face was hard to describe, the same one that appeared whenever his family was brought up, a complex mix of hostility and resignation.
“Yeah, Grubbly-Plank says she will be fine.”
Now that he knew Draco, Harry recognized the words as a white flag, raised with uncertainty in a discreet offer.
Ron had been surprised to see his mom and Bill when they gathered back at the Great Hall for lunch. Then he had grown pale when she asked him about his exam. Fred, George and Ginny joined them as well, and, after a while, so did Hermione.
“I think,” said Lupin slowly. “That the Ministry might have found a way to get inside Hogwarts."
, Moony, live a little. You are acting like Harry.”
Draco raised a questioning eyebrow. “Late for what?"
The blond’s eyebrows furrowed. “Excuse you?”
Myrtle pouted. “But don’t you want to listen to the egg? It’s very important, you know!”
“...Right.”
Next to him, Draco let out a sigh, then stepping back to stare at the empty spot the Patronus had left as if looking for any remains of its presence. Which reminded Harry of something.
"Get used to it," said Draco, stepping back and pulling Harry towards the castle by the hand. "Hurry it up, Potter, I'm starving."
Harry shook his head. “I know he won’t. Which is why I’m asking you.” Malfoy scowled at him, so he quickly added, “I’m not asking you to write it or anything. Just a quick check. Come on, you do owe me for the ink."
“He wishes-
And that’s where he is. Wand tightly on his hands as he goes through every possible spell that could work in this situation. Teeth gritted to not let any sound get out as he hears the creaks of the planks as the wolf approaches. Every expletive he knows being screamed on his head at him, for being an idiot, in the distinctive voice of Hermione.
“Malfoy?! Draco sodding Malfoy? He is a git!”
Malfoy took his time to answer him, neatly tying his roll of parchment and beckoning his owl over. "I hardly need company to send a letter. And shouldn’t I be asking you the same thing?"
“It’s no bother, professor,” said Harry. “You are taking me there, so it’s the least I could do.”
Draco wasn’t taking notes, he didn’t even seem to be listening to Snape. His eyes were on his desk, fingers still rolling the quill. Spin it once, then spin it again. Harry hadn’t seen him do that before. He hadn’t seen him not pay attention before either-
“It would have bothered him more if I did,” drawled a posh voice behind them that made Harry drop his frown. He turned around just as Draco caught up with them, taking Harry's side as they walked. “You see, Harry is quite fond of my face as it is. Isn’t that right, love?"
“Harry,” said Sirius sternly, placing his hands on his shoulders and looking at him. “You are not a bad person, you are not going to hurt anyone, you haven’t hurt anyone."
Ron snorted. “I mean, if I didn’t know better, I would expect them to exchange blows at any given time, so that little exchange out there was low profile for those two.” He chewed his food thoughtfully, but at Hermione’s glare he passed it down before speaking. “Besides, it would be weirder to see Harry not talking back at him.”
thing that no one could have predicted, all while making sure that Crabbe and Goyle nodded along. Harry was sure the boys had no real idea of what he was talking about, but it worked.
Two intakes of breath made him turn around, finding Ron and Sirius with equal grimaces. “Mate,” said Ron. “That doesn’t sound good.”
“Not all of us can have skin as thick as a troll’s,” said Draco haughtily, this time avoiding Parkinson’s kick.
you afterwards, we have to win."
The last one brought change as well, marking the end of his days with the Dursleys and the start of his life with Sirius, once he was picked up. He was surprised to hear that it would be Dumbledore the one to do so, but pleased nonetheless.
Malfoy raises an eyebrow. “Is that why, then? Because you think of yourself as some sort of saint above the rest of us?” There’s -
“Are you quite sure you won’t be needing the Potions book?” asked Remus, bringing Harry’s attention back to him and the shopkeeper.
Harry wanted to argue that he wasn’t, but he glanced at the pale hands still over his and his throat went a little dry.
three cakes."
“Right,” said Draco, studying Harry carefully for a long moment. Then he shrugged and started correcting his sketch.
is being stupid," retorted Parkinson. "He just needs time to realise that it was all a big mistake."
“Do you think we keep him around because we
There was a bark in response and some people on the station turned their heads towards the odd group, letting Harry finally see through the crowd. Draco stood by his parents. Harry couldn’t see Narcissa’s face from that angle very well, but he could see Lucius and Draco perfectly and the resemblance was, once again, striking. They had turned towards the group and Harry saw Draco’s eyes recognizing him, the familiar softening of the edges and the brief smile that rendered Harry thoughtless.
Draco didn’t look up when Harry sat next to him, frown still directed towards yet another book. After a moment he sighed, closing it and reaching for another, finally noticing Hermione sitting in front of him. “Granger,” he greeted tersely, sitting straighter.
behind,” said Harry, because he wasn't. He had a pile of work, sure, but it had gone back to normal size after he started working with Draco. He opened his mouth to say just that when something else caught his eye. "Ah, Hermione, look!"
Whispers reached his ears and he halted on his steps, looking at the students passing next to him to enter the Hall. They weren’t trying to hide their whispering at all, openly giving him weirded out glances and talking loudly enough for him to hear, as if daring him to say something.
“No. We shouldn’t be friends... nor talk again.”
There was a great variety of products, some recognizable like the Skiving Snackboxes, now in a more professional looking package, and others completely new.
He told them about the owlery, about the warm kiss and the cold bath of reality that followed, in the form of Rita Skeeter.
” Neville’s eyes were wide open. “Since when?"
With a smile, he opened the door to the room he had shared with Ron last year. The walls were still covered by the faded green wallpaper, but instead of two beds, there was a single bigger one, at the bottom of which was his trunk. He shrugged off his jacket and threw it over his bed, then as an afterthought he took out the
"I was just trying to share a laugh!" protested Mundungus.
"She is scarier than Hermione," mused Ron, as they walked out of the changing room.
“I like it,” said Harry. Malfoy snapped his gaze back at him and Harry felt his cheeks heating. “I mean, I like it here,” he stammered, looking away towards a wall. “The owlery. It’s very, er, comfy,” he tried, immediately wanting to smack himself. The owlery was a stone-cold freezer, in no way comfortable.
He stopped to address the other Slytherins before exiting. “I can only hope you three are smarter than him,” he said coolly, and then slammed the door shut.
He didn’t stop when Harry called after him, so he followed, the snow making it hard to run.
“Either way, you will be fine, Harry,” said Draco, taking a chocolate of his own and bringing it to his lips, along with Harry’s eyes. “I’m sure the Auror Office will be quite pleased to have the Great Potter among their ranks. Who knows, maybe they won’t even ask you for your NEWTS,” he said slyly, before taking a bite.
Harry laughed. “You are so petty, come on.”
So it rested there, threatening, accusing and hiding Harry’s fate while he tried to keep as far away from it as possible in his small room.
“Romance,
The plan was fairly simple, which surprised Harry, who had been expecting something terribly complicated like those convoluted plans from the spy movies Dudley liked to watch.
A bit late, but it's still Thursday here! Hope you liked the chapter, even if it was a short one! Kudos and comments are very much appreciated! I'll see you next update!
From his other side, Hermione passed an arm around his shoulders and smiled. "Yes! Everyone will be here, and you didn't hear this from me, but Mrs Weasley is baking
“He is doing fine. Just stay away from him, Potter.”
The Prefect’s Bathroom was enormous, even among the other big rooms of the castle, and quite luxurious. It’s most impressive feature was the bath, big enough to be called a pool and with a fountain-like structure on one of its corners, that held multiple golden bath taps.
They remained in heavy silence until Ron leaned forwards to grab another serving of bacon and Hermione huffed at him. Harry watched them bicker, eating through his toast. He would have to tell Sirius about Lucius having identified him, but sending another letter could be too risky. He had sent one to him last week, and Filch had almost caught him.
a prince- Is he single?”
and you have a chance. That’s what I can give you, a chance to fight back.”
“I think you are already
Seamus glowered. “I tried asking a third-year Ravenclaw to the Yule Ball. I have seen her at the library before, and she is very pretty and seems nice enough.”
Harry blinked. “With what?"
“Hey, Harry.” A familiar voice snapped him out of the silly idea and he turned to find the friendly faces of Neville and Luna. The first was holding a pot with what was definitely a magical plant under one arm, and the latter wore her usual dreamy smile.
"Don't talk about him,” said Harry coldly, startling the table with his tone. He stood up, glaring at Sirius. “Don’t you dare say
Well, The D.A had a good run. I considered keeping them secret, but in the end, it sort of made sense to have it go this way for me.
“Hi,” grinned the man as the three of them knelt before the fireplace. “How are things?"
A bit of a short chapter today! I'll see you on Thursday (as long as my work doesn't catch up to me, that is haha...ugh. I'll do my best!)
Harry laughed. "Sorry, sorry." He squeezed the blond's hand and smiled at him, "I just like you a lot."
“Listen,” continued Draco. His lower lip was free of his teeth now, a small red mark left as sole evidence of uncertainty on his otherwise eerily calm face. “I thought I could do it, but I was wrong. I can’t. It’s not correct.”
The blond got to his feet as McGonagall started lecturing Moody. His usually well-groomed hair was a mess, and his neat clothes were all dishevelled. His face was red with embarrassment and anger. Looking ready to strike back, he directed a scowl towards Moody, but it faltered when his eyes met Harry’s.
Harry exchanged a look with Hermione, who seemed confused by the question too. “Well, Ron, I live here,” he said.
“What happened with the twins?” asked Harry, taking the spot on the couch next to him.
"Because she leaves me less time to do this," said Draco, leaning forward to plant a quick kiss on Harry's lips. It was sweeter than the apple and over too soon in Harry’s opinion. The blond smiled at him. “Since we are skipping dinner, why don’t we visit the library and get started on the essay?"
Harry felt an odd combination of embarrassment and happiness at that. Because god-knows-what Sirius had been saying, but it was also a reminder of what Draco had done. For him.
“Fashionably so,” said Zabini with a wide grin, that stretched as the people around the group gasped in horror. He was probably enjoying the attention, even if it wasn't friendly at all.
? Are you aware that that is
Harry rolled his eyes at the obvious lie. “Right, he is behind me.
“You most certainly do,” said Harry, because that was
was what they had called him, and Harry didn’t like the man at all, but he didn’t think he liked the boy his father was in that memory either. As arrogant as Snape had always said.
“This is not about sides, Malfoy, but your pride.” Triumph roars in Harry’s chest when Malfoy gapes at him before turning his head to the side, away from his eyes. Harry grips his wrist tighter and presses him further into the wall. “Voldemort did this, don’t you hate him for that?”
Ron noticed his expression and shook his head in amusement. "Mate, instead of worrying about that, shouldn't you be worrying about next week?"
“Couldn’t you have written that in a letter?” asked Harry, voice slightly raised in frustration. “I haven’t heard a scrap of news from you. If it weren’t for Draco I would have gone mad."
“I saw him get spoon-fed today. Honestly, poor guy. No one knows what happened to him.”
Sirius opened his mouth again, but he suddenly grimaced and glared at Lupin, who Harry was sure had just stepped on his foot. "That’s a wonderful idea, Molly," said Lupin. "I'm sure the boys will be happy to see each other more."
“I’ll be fine,” assured Harry. “You told me to pick my fights, didn’t you? That’s what I’m trying to do."
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Or just concerned about her friend being asked out by a guy she doesn’t even know.”
Fred gestured angrily. “He isn’t even supposed to be patrolling around here. That’s Ron’s job."
"You are not a Death Eater," he says to the wolf, which says nothing in return. Harry takes that as an answer and nods, accepting that he had been wrong.
“There’s only one open Floo at Hogwarts,” continued Harry. The idea had already settled on his mind and once that happened there was no going back. “And it’s in
But Draco gave him a silent nod and slowly placed the towel on Harry’s hair. He seemed to take in a little breath, his chest puffing just so slightly before he started pressing down gently, carefully squeezing tufts of dark hair with the towel.
“Why is my dear cousin here?” asked Sirius suddenly. He was frowning now. “Did you tell him-?”
“Then you shouldn’t have hidden us in a bush.”
“A hippogriff?” repeated Umbridge, scribbling frantically on her clipboard.
“No, I don’t think he is,” said Harry. The thing is that he hadn’t even asked, because Draco hadn’t written yet, but he didn’t want to tell Sirius that. “You know how it is with his father...”
Apparently, being ostracised by the whole school was getting to Harry, because he picked up his things and walked over to Malfoy. The blond looked up at him cautiously, a pale hand already reaching for his wand.
“He is not,” said Harry.
Ron nodded. “Just by the register,” he said, pointing behind him. “Mum’s there too, she’s buying Ginny this weird thing called a Pygmy Puff. It’s this fuzzy ball that barely moves.”
“No!” exclaimed Harry and Draco at the same time. “Sirius, that’s really
“Oh, he did.” Draco shook his head as if to calm himself, then taking a deep breath. He sobered up and gave Harry a curious look before glancing away.“Very arrogant of him, honestly..." He sighed.
try to come up with a new dream every day."
“What you want, of course,” answered Draco, in the way he said things he considered clear. His silver eyes peered up at Harry. “Surely you have an idea.”
“You three are quite dramatic,” said  Zabini. “The professor is not that bad."
"Not just any Gryffindor," muttered Draco. He frowned at Harry's grin. "Besides, it's still better than a Hufflepuff."
“Were they at the Ministry?” asked Harry. “The Death Eaters.”
“I’m not scared of that
“Reasons, Granger,” answered Draco, then glancing at Harry. “Unless Harry requests me to sign, I don’t plan to do so."
Another problem that came with January had been the probation that Trelawney and Hagrid had been put on, because every single one of their classes was now supervised by Umbridge and her stupid pink clipboard.
“Still unresponsive?” asked Harry absentmindedly. Draco was wearing grey pyjamas, of a very soft fabric that could only be silk. They were only pyjamas, but for some reason, Harry found them terribly distracting, just like his neck.
"But I can't be with you, Harry," said the blond, unshed tears threatening to spill from his eyes. "I have duties as a son, and I can't leave them behind."
“Why would he go to the Hospital Wing?” asked Ginny, dropping her arm from Ron’s shoulder to cross both of them. “He lost
“Oh,” said Draco, reaching up to touch them. After a pause, the blond cleared his throat. “Thank you, Harry."
"We need to kick out the Slytherins," muttered Ernie, arms crossed over his chest. The rest of the group that had congregated on one side of the room and kept glaring at the rest of it shared nods of agreement.
Harry didn’t need to be told twice. He picked up his wand and made way towards the door, careful to step away from Snape.
“Not the
“Don’t you dare lecture me about
“The matter, Harry, is that even if hiding things is not lying, it’s still not a good thing for a Minister to do.” Sirius scoffed. “And that’s what he is doing, trying to keep morale high saying that The Ministry remains strong and having The Prophet bring your name up at any opportunity instead of telling people how in deep shit we are!”
,” he said. “Since you are so knowledgeable on the subject to the point you don’t need to pay attention, perhaps you could tell us about nonverbal spellcasting?”
Harry hummed and reached to touch the coarse material of the tapestry. “Not even from the Order?”
“He's very clever. Helped me a lot last year with Potions.” Harry smiled at the memory. “He didn't want to, at first, but we made a habit out of it. I helped him with Transfiguration too, but I don’t think he needed it that much." Harry looked at the name for a moment. “He has pretty eyes."
And a significant portion of the room seemed troubled.
Harry’s face heated up. “No, of course not- I just didn’t buy the book, or anything.”
“Because Dumbledore made us swear that we wouldn’t,” confessed Hermione.
“Buildings?"
It was ironic, really, to the point Harry could have laughed, but instead he is just frozen in place trying not to feel sympathy and failing. Did he ever expect to feel bad for Draco Malfoy? Never, but he hadn’t expected him to become a werewolf either, so what’s another odd thing to the day?
“Bugger,” said Harry bitterly, suddenly understanding Parvati all too well. And before he could stop himself, he said the rest, “He
Hello again! Hope you liked the chapter! If you did, please leave a comment, I love reading your thoughts! I'll see you on Monday!
“Kreacher,” called Draco. The elf whimpered to let him know he had heard, but neither Harry nor Draco looked away from the other until the latter found his answer. He paid no mind to Kreacher's pleas and said, “Call Sirius Black.”
There was a heavy silence, that lasted until it was broken by a clap. “Right, we are just going to go," said Fred, nudging the first years to start walking again.
The carriage suddenly started moving, and Harry looked towards his friends. Sometimes he forgot there were other people around, to his great embarrassment. Surely, the others were staring at them, Parkinson looking amused while Ginny scowled.
“One bite of our Nosebleed Nougat and you will be on your way to a nice break on the Hospital Wing,” added George. “Any takers? They are cheap."
Harry wasn’t able to suppress his grin. “I will,” he said. The golden liquid danced inside the vial, looking exactly like what liquid luck should look like; shiny and promising.
"Yes," said Harry, smiling at him. "Unless you want us to go back to hating each other's guts."
“Unless Lucius does know,” started Moody, his electric-blue eye examining Harry. “He might be using his son to get inside your head. Inside the Order!"
"Of course." Draco reached out to hold the end of Harry's scarf, looking at it thoughtfully before his eyes flickered back to Harry's. "Green really suits you."
“Shut up, Ron,” said Hermione, placing a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “Perhaps he was busy, and this isn’t exactly a place for a conversation, is it?”
Harry felt strong relief, followed by... confused anger. “And you didn’t tell me?!”
The blond blinked at him in bewilderment, making Harry hurry to explain himself. “Er, I passed the task of the Tournament- You already know that, you were there. And the prize was an egg- which you
Sirius went on with his story, and Harry listened without really doing so. Part of the weight from the past days had been lifted from his shoulders, but now it sat heavy on his chest.
“Flattery,” mused Draco, raising an eyebrow. “You should try that with Snape, perhaps he would stop giving you extra homework."
boring, Granger."
Instead, he pressed a kiss on his face, just by his ear, and was shoved back lightly by a red-faced Draco, who held a hand to his ear and tried to frown at Harry.
Draco glowered at him, and it felt as if they had jumped back a year, but way worse. "You are one to talk," he spat coldly. "Pretending I'm the only one trying to hide. Do your friends even know we talk?" He took a step closer. "Have you told them?"
He didn’t hear Draco’s reply, only his steps as he approached him. A yell and the sound of a scuffle behind him made him glance back. Crabbe and Goyle were holding back a furious Nott, who tried to free himself.
"Oh, nothing. Just remembering how we met. Still hung up about that, aren't you, Malfoy? Jumping at the first chance to grovel.” Ron sneered in uncharacteristic malice. “I find it pathetic, but, hey, maybe
. You can't be dating someone like
Harry grimaced. “Listen, what Ron said-”
“Bye,” mumbled Harry, watching him go. A weird feeling settled on his chest, making him feel uneasy. He hurried after him on a whim. “Wait, Malfoy-!”
"You are already great," mumbled Harry, refusing to let go and pressing a kiss to his cheek. "No more learning."
bit. “So, what do you think?”
It was an unfair question. “Draco…” was the only thing Harry could say, because both of them knew the answer. It would be impossible. Harry couldn’t just leave everyone behind, leave the war behind, despite how much every fibre of his being wanted to say
Draco looked up the shelf, grin growing when he saw the bottle. “Sometimes I forget some people are barely taller than a goblin,” he said. He brushed by Harry and extended his arm to reach the shelf, his robes moving out of the way and letting Harry notice the small constellation pinned to his jumper.
“Plenty, but I might
“Don’t be late,” added Hermione. Then she paused and looked at Harry with a slight frown. He didn’t like the way she looked uncomfortable. “Harry, I think you should talk to Lupin-"
” mused Neville as they watched the Slytherins walk away.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “More than offensive spells?"
“Neville said that?” whispered Harry, surprised at the boldness.
A voice stopped him from walking into the alley, and he turned around to meet the angry eyes of Remus, his friends and Sirius tailing after him.
That was completely wrong “He did nothing!” snapped Harry, feeling a bit guilty when Ginny looked betrayed. The girl didn’t know anything, so it was understandable that she was confused, but Harry didn't have time to explain. “Ron, Hermione, can you-?”
“Yes, well, tonight can’t be.” Mrs Weasley gestured at the three teenagers to get out, Ginny and Ron harshly and Hermione with a smile.
Harry rolled his eyes, taking one look at Draco’s proud grin and raising his wand. “
“Yeah,” said Harry, not wanting to tell Ron what he’d rather do with that time. “Hermione, what was the correct weight of Griffith claw? Ten or- You
Malfoy's grey eyes narrowed. "I'm sure you know how dreadful your company is. Think of the owls."
Harry was waiting by the entrance to Hogsmeade, drumming his fingers against the short stone wall that ran all along the path to the castle. It was a very cold day and he couldn’t wait to get inside any shop. He glanced up and smiled when he saw Draco approaching, dressed in black from his shoes to his gloved hands, in deep contrast to the paleness of his hair, eyes and face. The only touch of colour on him was his blue scarf, that seemed to brighten his eyes when he smiled back at Harry, and also when he blinked as he noticed something else.
"Is he better than Trelawney?" asked Draco, looking down to meet his eyes. It seemed like he had forgotten his anger momentarily.
“They did sign."
a few mistakes and the last thing Harry wanted to do as captain was kick his best mate off the team.
“Don’t beat yourself up, these results are really good!” Sirius patted him on the back, giving Harry a proud smile that made him feel slightly better.
relationship?"
the way. If there’s anything I can do to make sure the others are prepared, then I have to do it."
“Yes, of course,” said Draco, standing up. He glanced at Harry, who noticed he seemed a bit tense, and then followed Nott. Both of them disappeared behind a shelf and probably kept walking because Harry didn’t hear any conversation start near them.
Harry watched his friends leave the castle along with the rest of students and sighed. Hermione had made him promise to start with the egg immediately after they left, so he had a tiring day ahead.
“I think we should start with Sprout’s essay,” started Hermione once they had finished. “And then- Where are you going?” she hissed when they stood up.
turned into
“Apart from breaking curfew and carrying dangerous objects,” said Draco easily, seemingly unfazed by Harry's arrival. “Hand them over and leave before I have you scrubbing floors for two weeks."
“I’m just trying to practise, Potter,” said Draco innocently. He then gave Harry a mischievous smile. “The amusement I may get from your face when you get stunned is just an added bonus."
“Sir, you are hurting him,” he said, trying to not convey how appalled he was.
Harry wanted to say yes, but a thought crossed his mind. “No, it’s fine,” he said, then rushing to explain himself when the blond frowned, “You already helped me with the Potions essay, I’m sure I can manage with the rest."
“Good to see you, Harry. I see that you have been well,” he greeted brightly, placing one arm around a disgruntled Ginny’s shoulder.
supply cupboard. What the hell, Potter? First a cave and now this?"
“You better not,” said Harry, half-joking, half-serious, because two years ago the idea would have never even crossed his mind, and here he was now.
. Listen, I really don’t have time. Dinner is about to begin and if Umbridge doesn’t see me there, she’s going to suspect something.”
From her tone of voice and the smile on her lips, Harry knew she had meant it as a jab at him instead of an observation. But Harry gave her a grin that let her know that wanted it or not, she had been absolutely right.
“He said he would explain,” said Hermione, giving Harry back his two letters. “If it’s not now, then you two will talk when term begins. So let’s just wait, Harry.”
“Excuse you?” came a posh voice, making them halt and turn around. Draco, Parkinson and, surprisingly, Luna Lovegood were standing by a wall just outside the Great Hall, looking at them, the first two in amusement and the latter in her usual far-away way.
Harry grimaced and fell back on the armchair, hiding his face in his hands. “I don’t want to hear it.”
Draco was quiet for the first moments, as if busy finding his pace, even when it looked like he had it from the moment they began. Then his eyes flickered to Harry’s and he smiled. “You are not so bad."
, you say Fudge has an army of them?"
“Yes, we believe so,” said Lupin, giving Harry an amused look. He cleared his throat and adopted a business-like expression. “Fudge’s been using his influence on the Daily Prophet to discredit you."
“Just because they felt like it,” protested Hermione, gesturing wildly. “And now you are giving him, what, private classes instead of learning with the rest of us?"
They walked into the kitchen together, Harry feeling like a weight had left his shoulders. He wouldn’t have wanted to leave Grimmauld Place still angry with Sirius. He had just taken his seat between Ron and Lupin when he noticed that the table was once again silent and looking at him.
Harry hummed. “I wouldn’t count on that." The woman seemed as unpleasant as Snape, perhaps even more.
“Shut up, Myrtle!” hurried Harry, calling their attention to him.
“It’s because they
“I didn’t see you on the train back," said Draco.
“Thanks, Ron,” muttered Harry as Sirius howled.

“Just a

to it?"
“Believe me, Harry.” Sirius was grinning again. “I don’t want to know what you and my cousin are up to, but if one day he ends up visiting this house, I at least want to have the peace of mind that you will know what to do.”
“Well, it’s bloody not!” Draco spun on his heel and then reeled back when he noticed where they were. Harry had recognized the door and already knew what to expect, but Draco hadn’t been there before.
His cousin gave him an awkward shrug before crossing his arms. “I dunno, it’s just weird,” he said in his slow voice, which now reminded Harry a lot of Goyle’s. “You are not coming back?”
“Yeah,” lied Harry. His homework situation was desperate, but he didn’t want Draco to stay up late, or see the cuts on his hands fresh after detention. Harry cleared his throat. “Besides, we can meet to study during the weekend, right?"
He had been guided out of the Great Hall by Professor Tofty, who suggested he went to the Hospital Wing. Harry did, because he was too worried about Sirius to care about going back to the stupid exam. He had run up the stairs. Professor McGonagall had been sent to the Hospital Wing the day before after she had been attacked for helping Hagrid when Umbridge and some others had tried to arrest him. He needed to talk to her, the only member of the Order at Hogwarts.
“Draco!”
“Harry, there you are,” said Bagman. “Feeling alright? Confident?”
Malfoy looked away. “I’m fine, Potter.”
“Bugger off,” snapped Parkinson when Harry told her to correct her posture, making Luna giggle when she complied anyway. There was a noticeable improvement among the students as time went on, Neville loudly celebrating when he managed to disarm Ron, and Crabbe and Goyle laughing every time they disarmed the other.
hunny-bunny. Right, Harry?"
The windows of the house were dark, like its neighbours, but the front door hung off its hinges as if it had been kicked in. Harry took out his wand and followed the Headmaster.
Harry laughed at how petty that was and looked at the blond's profile as they walked. His cheeks were tinted pink again by the cursed cold, but his hand was warm in Harry's. Without knowing what he was doing, Harry squeezed it, and his heart almost stopped when Draco squeezed back.
, you cow."
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Don't you have Divination?" he asked.
“Yeah, but I didn’t think you would leave
“Someone is in a rush,” said Hermione.
Ginny scowled. “Of what? She’s a cow.”
“To the library after lunch? I don’t think so,” said Harry, stepping closer to him. “Come on."
"Bugger" she finally said, sounding surprised. "He
She left then, leaving Harry to stand in the middle of the hall, feeling lost.
He told him that he missed him as well, and that he couldn’t wait to see him again, and his quill hovered over the parchment as he thought about writing three more words. In the end, he wrote his name at the bottom and sent it off with Cepheus.
The blond looked at him in surprise. “Friends?”
"Your idea?"
A huff. “Of course it is, the Protean charm is NEWT level at least."

Malfoy fixed his clothing. “Yes, to look for you.”
Harry walked into the bedroom he would be sharing with Ron feeling frustrated by Fudge’s stupidity but relieved by Sirius' support of his intention to join in the fight against Voldemort. When he removed his jacket, the untouched envelope fell to the floor. Harry blinked at it, feeling dismayed again.
“We know,” assured Mr Weasley, “We are surprised you are taking this so maturely, son. I know you had a particular dislike for the boy."
Remus hushed them into the car. “Don’t bother the Aurors, Sirius,” he said sternly as he helped Harry place Hedwig’s cage next to him on the seat. It had been magically enlarged to fit more people, to the point it now resembled a modern sofa.
“You are becoming insufferable,” muttered Hermione against the rim of her cup. She shook her head and sighed. “Ron was right.”
“Ow! Harry, what the hell,” hissed Draco, giving him a smack on the back and then drawing in a sharp breath when Harry kissed the same spot. “Oh,” breathed out Draco, one of his hands holding on Harry’s shoulder while the other went to the edge of the sink. “Alright,” he whispered and raised his chin, giving Harry better access to his neck.
Harry felt his stomach do a turn as the realization hit him. Narcissa Malfoy knew about them, which wouldn’t be a problem if the opposite hadn’t been the only explanation Harry had for Draco’s strange silence.
Moody reached them, opening a path between the small crowd that had gathered. He looked down at the ferret that trembled in quiet fear, before turning towards Ron. “Did he hit you?”
“You should hear Molly,” mumbled Lupin, but his face seemed more relaxed now. At least as much as it could, because the man always looked tired.
-” Her eyes widened as she turned to look at Harry.
"I think it's very different, mate." Ron looked up from his eggs and bacon, suddenly looking a bit uncertain. "About the practice, do you think we could meet up earlier, and practice a bit? It’s my first practice as Keeper, and, you know..."
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Isn’t that a good thing?”
, it had been rather easy for him.
thought Harry.
“My name,” finished Draco, looking up at him. “I- Thank you, Harry.”
Draco's agreement had been a bit hesitant. He had been quieter lately, more aware of their proximity when they studied together. He hadn't mentioned what happened at the bathroom again, and Harry hadn't asked either, not wanting to push him away.
?” asked Hermione.
“Is Harry okay?” he heard Hagrid asking Ron and Hermione.
“Again with this,” muttered Hermione, calling the attention of the group. “They are not real, Malfoy."
Harry beamed. “Are you coming to our meeting, then?"
Sirius frowned. “It was, but I seriously doubt his will be burned like mine."
That made Harry grimace. He hadn’t thought about that. He hadn’t thought about much, to be honest. The future seemed so far away right now, and so unclear. It was easier to focus on the now, on their little alcove and the expensive chocolates. He sighed again.
Lupin cracked a smile and looked at Harry. “And you are convinced Draco can change."
To the dismay of the others, Harry offered to assist Draco off the carriage once they stopped near the gates, jumping down and extending a hand.
"Yes, alright," said Harry. Then he looked confused, "And how do I do it?"
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Dudley, you were there when my godfather told your parents I would be living with him.”
“Hello, cousin,” came Sirius’ voice, and Harry turned to find his godfather leaning against the entrance. Judging from the dishevelled appearance and the bags under his eyes, not being able to leave the house wasn’t good for him.
“That’s
“Spare me, Harry. This isn’t your fault, you didn't’ jinx me. In fact, the one who did was a brute called McLaggen, so perhaps you could jinx him back for me.” Draco grinned at him and held out his hand. “Now give me your cloak, I want to look at it.”
Hermione gave him a soft smile. "He said that two people that look at each other the way you do shouldn't be kept apart."
Malfoy was biting down his lip, the corners wobbling.
"Honestly, Harry." Hermione rolled her eyes in exasperation, then crossing her arms and shaking her head at him. However, when she spoke there was clear amusement in her voice. "He just bats his eyelashes and you go with his every whim."
stab her, Draco,” explained Harry. “It’s a saying, means to betray someone."
There was a moment of tense silence as the Slytherins shared a wordless conversation, and then Warrington and Bulstrode exchanged a look, glanced at the unconscious form of Umbridge and finally shrugged. "Not my problem," grunted Warrington, letting go of Ron and walking away from the baffled boy.
Ron studied him carefully. “You are not fooling me, Malfoy. Your Slytherin antics won’t work on me!” he declared with a triumphal smile as he moved the piece.
“Not even in You-Know-Who?” asked Ron, making both of them laugh. “Can you imagine him just opening the damn thing, putting it on his eye and then-” He gestured a punch to his own face. “
“He can walk on his own, thank you,” said Sirius in a haughty tone as he pushed Harry across the barrier.
It wasn’t hard to picture after Harry’s own experience with the media. He could imagine the titles, the rumours and the jokes at their expense, at Draco’s expense. He took in the blond’s features and managed to say, “Is that what you want?”
“Please, Hermione” Ron clasped his hands as if praying. “You are the smartest person ever, please save me from them."
"It's Scotland," retorted Harry. "Summer doesn't exist."
“What do you mean you
Despite it having been asked before, this time the question caught Harry off guard. Because instead of demanding and expectant, it had been asked with the fear of a person that already knew the answer and didn’t want to hear it.
Ginny pursed her lips. “He likes blondes, so there’s that.”
Harry nodded, offering a hand for support as the blond climbed up gracefully. With how easy he made it look, Harry found it weird Draco needed any help, but he wasn’t complaining.
“Why?”
So as soon as they started, Harry made sure the recipient of unicorn horns was
“How could I not, mate? Have you seen her?” mumbled Ron.
But Draco hadn’t done anything. Harry was sure that if Draco had wanted to sabotage the interview, he would have found the way. But he hadn’t even asked Harry not to do it. And neither had he crossed the street to the tea shop where Umbridge might or not be. Even now that he had gone to Hogwarts, Harry was sure he wouldn’t do anything either.
“Not without reason” pointed out Hermione. “And what did you say?”
Harry sighed and looked around the room. It was as decadent as the rest of the house, the green wallpaper starting to peel off. “So, how have-."
and stormed up the stairs. The boy looked startled for a moment, mumbled something about him 'not being able to stop the twins either way' and then left his parchment on the couch with a defeated sigh. “There’s no point in doing this without her. I don’t know anything about moonstones and whatever one might use them for."
. Is that how breakups go?”
"Was it Smith?" tried Parkinson, her act so convincing Harry was starting to believe it wasn't one. When Ernie scowled, the girl sighed. "That's the only one I know. Apart from Diggory, of course," she added, glancing towards the older Hufflepuff in question.
“Where is Hagrid?”
“You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, I believe?” continued Umbridge.
Grimmauld Place was an old house, dark, decadent and with an off-putting house-elf; and Harry loved it. He had spotted Sirius on a table surrounded by many others before Mrs Weasley had intercepted and directed him upstairs.
Harry smiled at the formal tone. “You are
Had Harry ever expected to carry Malfoy’s clothes? No, but he hadn’t expected him being a werewolf either, so what’s another odd thing to the day?
"What took him so long?" repeated Ron, giving her a bewildered look. "Hermione, the list you gave him was longer than my last Charms essay," Ron chuckled, his eyes going to look at Harry. His smile immediately died. "
But the letter stayed the same. His name, a single line, no signature. No signature! Harry clenched his teeth, left the letter on the bed before he could crush it and paced in circles around his room, now that he had the room to do so. “Damn it, Draco,” he muttered, feeling angry for a hot second. He glared at Hedwig. “And damn you too!”
ridiculous."
There was no softness in the way he opened his mouth against Draco's, almost hungrily. Thin fingers threaded through his hair, tugging him forwards roughly to deepen the kiss, head tilting to give him more access. One of Harry's hands found a bony hip, the other arm bent against the wall as if trying to phase through, wanting to be even closer. There was a sharp scrape of teeth against his lips, followed by a lick, fast to leave just as Harry was to follow, and then he was licking into Draco's mouth and it was weird and wet and
“Draco,” he started, but left the words hanging as he walked by him, not knowing what to say. He glanced at his boyfriend’s profile, at his tense jaw and tired eyes that didn’t look at him. “I’m sorry-”
“I don’t know, Dudley, I didn’t really stop to think.”
Hermione sighed. Ron had been ranting about last night from the moment they sat down, nearly half an hour ago. She looked up from his book and threw Ron an annoyed look.
“Yes, actually,” said Draco, looking at him curiously.
“I will,” lied Harry. He watched as the twins nodded their goodbyes at the rest, kissed their mother and walked out of the room.
“Then it’s public, Harry,” sighed Draco. “How many people are going, exactly?"
“WHAT?” blurted out Ron, quickly checking Snape hadn’t noticed him.
obvious,” grinned Hermione.
“You knew,” he hissed once the door to the office opened. The Headmaster didn’t seem surprised as he rounded his desk and met Harry’s gaze calmly.
“Does he play?"
“Yeah, sure,” said Harry, a bit startled again. Draco had a certain way to strike him dumb. He watched as he descended the stairs gracefully, poised back and head raised like a noble. "You too!” he yelled after him, receiving an amused wave in answer.
“I told you; we have to make a good impression.” Sirius walked into the kitchen, rolling up the sleeves of his dress shirt. “You will see, Molly will walk in here with three or four dishes and start saying that you
"Yes," said the Slytherins.
The motion seemed to catch Draco’s eyes for a second, his gaze flickering to it briefly before looking up again, a slight frown settling on his face. It could easily be read as annoyment, but Harry knew better because he was also trying not to grin at the other.
Malfoy's robes were black as most of the students', but the vest and shirt underneath were an immaculate white and Harry didn't know much about fashion but he liked the contrast. He was linked by the arm with a pink-clad Parkinson, whose eyes wandered around the room as she talked to him, probably gossiping. The blond leaned down to meet her whispers, his lips stretching into a marvellous grin that Harry found himself copying.
“You would have brought the news for him after a trying day, when he probably already felt guilty about what he had done.” The Headmaster shook his head. “No, it occurred to me that he deserved the rest.”
With that, Harry said goodbye to the Weasleys and Hermione and went with Sirius and Lupin to search for the Dursleys. They weren’t hard to find, as they stood very close to each other at the corner of the station, throwing suspicious looks at anyone that walked by.
Draco looked as if he might refuse for a short second, then raising his wand with a trembling arm and pointing at the empty space of the room. Like the many times he tried before, he took a deep breath, letting his shoulders relax, his arm and voice steady when he spoke, “

The door to their compartment opened suddenly when Draco and Ron were on their third game. Fay Dunbar paused as she looked at them, clearly surprised.
Harry had never been more certain of something as he was of needing that potion. He wasn’t the only one. More than one head had perked up as Hermione spoke, and when Slughorn announced that he would be giving a vial of Felix Felicis to whoever brewed the best Draught of the Living Dead,
Malfoy pursed his lips. “Perhaps, but I won’t cause trouble."
“I don’t,” admitted Sirius. “But at least she’s not Bellatrix."

“Where?” asked Harry, raising an eyebrow.
“Those are
"I'm not with you for your name."
"Wolfsbane," he says aloud, filling the silence of the room and the wolf only looks at him quietly, moon eyes big and unblinking, so unlike what Lupin had been years ago when he had forgotten to take the Potion that would let him retain some mental faculties, not human but not a crazed monster.
“Are you sure?” asked a hushed voice.
“Well, that can’t be good,” sighed Draco, glancing around the tavern. “It’s almost time,” he stated, standing up. “Let’s see if she’s here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Then gradually developed feelings for each other," explained Hermione.
Hermione folded her hands on the table. “Malfoy."
Ron followed him upstairs quietly, sitting down on the end of his bed when they reached their dorm, face lost in a mix of confusion, disgust and fear. Harry himself felt a bit shocked. The antagonism between Gryffindor and Slytherin was, after all, part of Hogwarts natural order. Because Slytherins were sharp calculated words, cold sneers and untraceable sabotage, and Gryffindors were decent human beings. Harry had never heard a single nice comment about a Slytherin from his housemates in his three years.
to be a trap-”
Now, clear your mind." Snape didn't give him time to do so. “
Voices were raised, eyes were rolled, insults were thrown and things started to look very grim for the tranquillity of the lion House. Harry, who had wisely chosen to remain quietly sitted on the rugged floor, was already planning a way to sneak back to the dorm when someone else stood up to save the day.
“It is,” said Harry.
Mrs Weasley looked furious. “We did tell you!” she yelled. “You probably just got blacked out drunk and forgot about it, like you forget your duties!”
Harry hurried to fill the pool, not wanting to keep Draco and Myrtle together much longer. If they started bickering again, Harry would have to open the egg to give his ears a break. He made sure the water rose close to the edge before closing the tap.
Smith gulped. “Showing your true colours now, aren’t you?” he hissed, voice strained as he raised his chin away from the wand. “Just like your father-”
“Where is he? Where has he gone?” asked Harry. The elf only laughed again and Harry wanted nothing more but to get across and punch him. He felt the galleon shudder in his pocket but shrugged it off. “Kreacher, I’m warning you! What about Lupin? Is anyone else there?”
"Better me than you," retorted Harry.
“Did you remember something else?” asked Harry, not able to stop himself.
It seemed like every student of Hogwarts was either openly sneering at him or giving him the cold shoulder. Harry was used to it from the Slytherins, but today a
Hermione refused, chastising him for not organising his time, and Ron whined.

Draco scrunched his nose. "As if I'd ever help a

It was… disheartening to see the state of both shops, places that formed part of Harry’s first good memories, and even of his latest ones. Some time ago, a time that now felt far away, Draco and he had talked about going there together. Now those plans were as destroyed as the front door of the shop, whose torn hinges felt oddly ominous.
Harry didn’t look at his friends until he was sitting on his bed, rubbing his face with his hands in frustration.
“Ah, hello,” said Hermione, then blinking at the three of them.
Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper, stopped the course of the Quaffle Angelina threw, immediately passing it to Warrington, who zoomed past Alicia and Katie towards the small figure of Ron. Harry clenched his teeth as the Chaser drew nearer.
. Harry rubs his neck, feeling less angry now. The wolf had acted scared, sad, had recognized Harry and let him stay with him. Was that all wolf, or was it Malfoy?
“Let’s say next Wednesday at the same time, then,” cut in Harry before another argument about the time would start. He glanced at the clock again. “We can decide on the next meetings there." As everyone left the room in small groups, Harry kept checking the map every time to see if someone was outside, then glancing at the clock.
With a sigh, he left his glasses on the table and curled beside the small book.
“The zoo?” repeated Draco.
“Padfoot, the train,” warned Remus, and Sirius stepped to the side to let him give Harry’s shoulder a squeeze. “Take care, Harry, and do try to avoid trouble.”

Harry frowned at the chessboard in deep thought, before moving to pick up one of the pieces.
you could help me now."
Harry let his head fall against the back of the couch with a groan. “I’m an idiot.”
“There’s no need to show off."
“Merlin, Potter. Watch where you are going!” hissed Malfoy, out of breath.
Just before Draco
There was a silence as Harry left the box next to his cushion carefully in order to grab the one he had brought. “Not flowers, but I know you like toffees, so, well...” said Harry lamely, giving him the pale green box. He glanced at the ceiling again, knowing it wasn’t enough.
“That’s enough!” barked Lupin, standing up too. “Sirius, I’m warning you."
There were figures floating near the middle, held by ropes and surrounded by a large group of merpeople. Treasures for the champions to rescue.
Draco blinked at that. "I didn't tell you?" he asked, sounding surprised. "I'm sorry, I must have been a bit distracted."
Sirius paused for a moment, then frowning slightly. “I assume dear Draco told you this,” he said slowly, looking at Harry curiously. “And if he saw me at Hogsmeade, do you think he would tell his father?"
(See the end of the chapter for
The man looked uncomfortable. "Can I speak to you for a moment, Harry?"
Neville blinked. “But-"
“About what?” asked Ron, happy to look away from the menacing Bouncing Bulbs they were supposed to be working with.
If Snape knew, he should have told the Order, or at least Dumbledore. That made Harry pause because the Headmaster hadn’t mentioned anything. Either Snape or Dumbledore was hiding things and Harry was inclined to believe one of them more.
A hand gently pulled his face forwards, until most of his field of vision was made of Draco’s mesmerizing silver eyes. “I told you you could try to get more,” he murmured, so close Harry felt the movement.
Ron might have found Malfoy’s constant correspondence with his parents something to mock, but Harry felt bitter about it.
Harry blinked. “Is he here too?”
The answering laugh didn’t clear anything up, but it made Harry smile to himself again, glad Ron wasn’t around to make some snarky comment about him being smitten. Which, he had to admit, would be completely true.
"That's not funny, Harry," said Draco, shoving him away, but another smile appeared on his face.
Draco pursed his lips. "If you say so."
“Why the long faces?” said the man, having stood up from his conversation with the twins to come stand by Harry. “It’s supposed to be a party, come on!” He smelled strongly like firewhisky, which made Harry exchange an amused look with his friends. Mrs Weasley wouldn’t be happy.
One thumb traced the scars over the back of Harry’s hand. “And what are you going to do?” asked Draco. Harry looked up at him, finding him frowning at the scars.
he hasn’t,” muttered Sirius. He was glaring at Harry. “So this
So Harry thinks about what he can do, his eyes fixed on Malfoy’s for any sign but only seeing his own doubts reflected in them. Malfoy’s new condition can’t be taken away, nor can their past, but the future is something else.
“Stop calling him
Snape looked down at the class. "Antidote to Weedosoros. Page 278. You might have to try it, so I suggest you do
“See?” said Ron to Hermione, almost victoriously.
Harry… didn’t want to think of Lucius Malfoy. “And you trust him?” he asked instead. “What if he’s lying?”
“Oh, are you going to deduct points?” laughed Harry, sobering up when Draco didn’t say anything. “Wait, really?"
Harry grimaced. “Quite."
Harry stopped at the bottom of the stairs. “It's not?” he said in a quiet voice that made his godfather drop his grin.
“It’s just like a normal Telescope but it punches you in the eye when you try to look through it. Hermione had an encounter with one the twins left at home,” said Ron, giving her a glance. “Quite a blackeye she got.”
“I really don’t,” said Malfoy, looking a bit nervous.
“I know
Harry leaned on the window, watching as his best friend and his
“I think she’s right,” said Ron later, at the common room.
“But will I die?” cut in Harry, because at that point it was just routine.
Something fluttered inside Harry’s chest. “Is that why you gave this to me?”
