"First, I'm going to get some clothes. Know anywhere good?"
His words caught the attention of Alana, Attinna, and Aquatta who had railed around Ariel, demanding to know the why's and how's and when's of this adoption tale.
"You may find it hard to believe," the Dark Lord continued smiling broadly, "But Ariel knew me when I was nothing but a pudgy little orphan. Back before I knew of my magical blood or I knew of my greatness. Back when I was languishing away in the muggle world, Ariel found me trying to steal from her personal collection. And though she could have easily drowned me then and there, she didn't. Instead, she taught me two of the most important lessons I ever received as a child: First, she taught me there is strength in numbers." (This garnered a tittering of laughter. With his return to power, his followers were in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions.) "But most importantly, she instilled in me a passionate pursuit for immortality. And if it wasn't for her, I can honestly say, I wouldn't be the great wizard that I am today."
Ariel clinked her cup into the width of the wine bottle before she swallowed the whole of the content. Within seconds, she felt the blood in her body warm and her brain cells start to buzz pleasantly.
"You never asked," Ariel said with a sly wink as she dipped her head to steal a sip from her teacup. "Besides, you were way too young to hear about my pirate days."
No sooner had her feet crossed the invisible threshold into the cave did the cold winds cease completely as if never existed and the freezing climate was replaced by a warm tropical atmosphere. She paused, catching her breath, allowing the cold to thaw from her body while she stared into the impenetrable darkness that lead to the bowels of the cave.
"Of course." She said with a sniffle. "Any song in particular?"
They rolled off each other, got up from the dirtied cloak which Snape cleaned with a flick of his wand and handed over to Ariel. She took the cloak and gave him a wicked smile as she wrapped herself within the cloth and secured it above her chest with a simple knot. "This is so warm!" She observed with a shudder. "You might not get this back."
"Nagini." He hissed out in parseltongue as he poked his pet in the hood. "Nagini wake up."
His mouth clamped tight with disappointment. His insides broiled with envy. Why couldn't he be special? He knew he was special. He knew it in his bones. So why was every adult he ever came in contact with trying to squelch his potential?
Draco thanked him, then Ariel then ran into the kitchen, desperate to be done with these menial tasks so he could go home and spend the rest of this miserable year as far away from the Dark Lord as he could.
"Really?" Bellatrix said more shocked than relieved.
"Soon."
"Uh-huh. My poor dad had to wear a bra just to fit in."
What's the problem? I finally meet the woman of my dreams and it turns out she's the Dark fucking Lord's fucking idol, that's the problem.
Ariel made herself laugh as the sickness in her stomach grew denser. You are bottom of the ocean floor putrid whale shit, Triton's voice sneered in her ear. Suddenly, he was at the table too. Only he was glaring at her, piercing her heart with unyielding contempt. I know, she thought sadly as she shared a laugh with Lord Voldemort.
The three of them got dressed, paid their tab, said their goodbyes to Ruth, and were on their way out of the door, to brave the brisk blackened trip back to Hogwarts. Harry was the last one to exit the bar but, when he turned to follow Ron and Hermione, he felt his body collide into someone else's.
They were both, secretly, dreading this day for years now.
Draco gave him a mischievous grin. "She didn't sound like no one."
"No offense taken, mate." Harry agreed, turning his attention back to scratching the area behind Ruth's pointy ears.
Ariel scoffed, then pinched his nose playfully. "You need to sleep more, ya dork."
"Oh, God." She moaned. "Say my name again."
She waited for him in the garden. She sat at a round little patio table, watching two albino peacocks wander through the manicured backyard freely until eventually one of them got tired of being followed and attacked their companion for no discernible reason. Shrieks were made; talons were drawn. The squabble ended as soon as it started with one victorious and the other cut up, missing tuffs of feathers, red streaking the immaculate white body.
"Don't worry mate. The second you turn seventeen, we're burning that shithole house to the ground," avowed Ron.
"No," Tom said, quickly, almost disgusted by the idea of being related to those morons. "They're just kids that live with me at the orphanage."
"Absolutely."
He chuckled, relieved for the distraction. "I doubt it." Though the more he thought about it, the less he was sure. His mom never talked about her parents and when she did it was to point out his grandfather's bastard-ways and how it was the "family curse": for the women in their family to fall in love with bastards and for the men to grow up into bastards. "Although, I can't say for sure."
He lifted his head and begged, "Say my name again."
"A sword no but a wand yes," replied Tom with a jackal's laugh.
"…This person attacked and killed five of my followers without so much as lifting a wand?" His voice was stained with rage, confusion, and intrigue. "How can this be?"
Did Potter find another Horcrux? He asked himself with wild fear.
Anger radiated within him daily, hourly, constantly, and with no one else to turn his anger on, he unleashed it onto his fellow orphans. Because if he was going to be miserable then so would they.
Snape took the crown and studied it. It felt real enough and everything about the crown, from its intricate design to the loud rippling waves captured in the center-most sapphire of the crown, told him it had to belong to mermaid royalty.
"I'm afraid I must leave," he announced with audible regret when he returned to the moonlight lagoon.
Narcissa hugged the bottle into her chest, trembling with fear, as the Dark Lord stepped over the threshold and closed the door wordlessly. Her mind raced with images of her violence and death as the sounds of the locks clanked shut. He stood there with his white-spidery fingers tightly wound around his hook of a wand. All pretenses of dignity and courage fell away from her as he put a silencing charm on the room, concealing her to whatever fate he had in store. She started to quake with unmitigated fear as he slowly approached her bed.
But Harry wasn't going to let him win. That's why his left hand started to crawl over Draco's thigh, like a spider waiting to startle an arachnophobe with its presence. He looked into Draco's face, expecting to see fear or disgust, but he was shocked to see Draco's face went slack as he stared down and watched Harry's hand travel over his thigh and find his hardened crotch.
Hermione and Ron glared at the closed door, their nostrils flared, breathing hard.
Eventually, Snape was dismissed. When he went home he found Ariel was reading in bed, eagerly waiting for his return.
Ariel didn’t hesitate. She looked him in the eye and said, “We both know that I can’t help you kill a child.”
But his internal monologue was interrupted by the sound of music.
Voldemort turned his head and peered up at her from the floor. "Really?"
"What?" Snape said when he opened the door to find Draco's slumped against the brick hallway wall. "Oh, Lord. Draco you look…"
"Yep," Hermione smirked. She pulled her wand from her pocket and asked, "Wanna duel about it?"
Ariel nodded, proudly. "Pretty cool, huh?"
"What are you so happy about?" Hermione said from behind the Daily Prophet.
"Wow. I haven't slept that long...in my entire life."
"Sod off."
She turned away but Draco hesitated to follow her. He searched for the Dark Lord's eyes, to make sure it was okay first, but the only one in the living room when he looked was Nagini, coiled up and snoozing on an armchair. His stomach gurgled, louder, begging him to eat but his gut warned him against the idea. You can't eat now! You must flee! Danger is near!
Snape pushed the crown back towards her gently. "You don't have to pay me. Last night was plenty."
"I am."
"You know, you're welcome to come and meet your aunts if you want," Ariel said to the back of his head.
"Little shit," Snape muttered.
"Wow," Ariel breathed. "How old were you here?"
It didn't help, Narcissa suspected, that this creature—this pseudo-siren—was beautiful. Extremely beautiful in fact. Though she doubted this meant anything to the Dark Lord, Narcissa knew this only served to enrage Bellatrix more.
With that, Voldemort rose to his feet and said, "Come along Ariel."
"Uh-huh."
"Yeah, he used to teach the subject too," Voldemort said in-between sips. "Oh, that reminds me…I need to call a meeting soon. I got to introduce you to the troops." He nudged her with his elbow playfully and said with a laugh, "Can't afford to lose any more followers to you now."
"I need you to take me somewhere."
She turned her head. Young Tom was back in Voldemort's old robes. His face blurred back into Voldemort's then in a flash returned to handsome visage that currently regarded her like she was the most important creature in the universe.
Ariel listened to his speech in teary-eyed silence. When he finished, she plunged forward, wrapping her arms around his neck and told him, after a thousand kisses, "Yes, yes, of course."
“Does she despise anybody that isn’t you?”
It was such a bizarre concept to the former mermaid, whose species, as her people liked to joke, were considerate enough to turn into seafoam once they died, thus sparing the bereaved the responsibility, and torment, of having to care for the dead. She couldn't imagine her corpse spending the eternity, entombed, in the cold ground like that. But even in her unease, she found the custom fascinating. "Wow…"
"Damn." His face dropped. He appeared mildly disappointed. "I lost the pool." Noticing his follower's visible incomprehension, he explained, "There's a bet going around on when you'd beg her to marry you. I guessed around New Years'."
"But you have a much prettier reading voice than I." He argued as they got up from the table to relocate into the living room.
"Perfect. After that, I don't know. I guess look up some old friends." She gave him a sly look when she added, "Possibly go on a date with this young, golden throated professor I just met. If he ever gets around to telling me his schedule."
"Bellatrix."
Ariel stared at the book the wind caught in her breath. She opened the cover and saw a stamp that read property of the libraries of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She was already crying, spotting Tom Riddle's signature on the borrowed/ returned column. Wordlessly Narcissa opened the book to one page specifically which beheld a second envelope which bore the word 'mom'. "I found it when I was decluttering the house."
Ariel pinched him in the upper arm. "You're such an asshole." Tom feigned as if she had stabbed him and she pinched him again harder to which he let out an actual yelp of pain. But then they dissolved into fits of laughter and for a moment it felt like old times.
Narcissa winked at Ariel before she pulled a half-drank bottle of wine from her robe's pocket and poured a generous serving into the two teacups. They toasted silently before they both tossed back the contents, laughing as they coughed up fire and poison.
She drew a sharp breath, preparing a scream that would've blown every last one of them to smithereens, but Voldemort silenced her by taking her by the upper arm and swearing, quickly and with vehemence, "They're not going to hurt you! They're not going to hurt you!" She looked him in the face then gawked at the shambling masses of half-decomposed, half-falling-apart corpses. "Trust me. I've trained them not to."
“Ssssomeone’s coming…” Nagini warned.
"My Lord, you're—is this you're way of saying I have your blessing?"
"Did you? Look at your life. Your only friends are murderers and thieves. Your husband's a Death Eater. You claim to be miss ethics but you don't seem to mind lying to your sisters about me. You have a voice so powerful you could probably rule the world for good but you waste it getting fucked by some greasy half-blood—"
"Hello?"
"Fine, then you drink it," Harry replied, handing her the drink.
"I am," she confessed. She lifted her head and said, "Severus told me what you…wanted to ask me."
"And I would never make you," Voldemort said with a loving smile. Then with a quick kiss on the cheek, he announced, "I really should go. I love you, mom. Tell Severus I'll see him soon."
She led him into the next room where a red-headed woman hovered remained bound and silenced hovering above the polished floor. Underneath her shadow laid the contents from her bag scattered around by Bellatrix. Garbage mostly. Magazines, forks, dead flowers, mini vials, seashells, bottle caps, driftwood, an old black robe, and an unremarkable amount of money. He turned his attention to the woman and discovered—he knew her face.
"Oh, my cod!" Ariel cried out, in-between dry coughs and shudders. "This is some good shit."
"Professor…" She started slowly as she read from the magazine. "Serve-us Snap?"
"It's my own fault. I keep staying up late to read." He half-lied. Half-lies were good for him. Nobody, except her, got anything close to the truth out of him.
Voldemort stormed inside the shack with his wand drawn. He stood in the doorway, waiting for an attack to come. His eyes darted across every inch of the room, searching for this foe. Minutes passed. "Reveal yourself," he ordered the empty room.
"Yeah," she said with another sad laugh as her eyes teemed with tears. She looked to the side in embarrassment but then saw the flowers and she gave them a closed-lipped smile. "Thanks for the flowers."
"Oh, Tom…You look like you haven't slept in weeks."
"Sixteen." Sixteen and a half was more accurate but he doubted he'd live to see seventeen.
"You might as well start on the kitchen," Voldemort said flatly as he handed Ariel a teacup full of dark purple wine. "After that, you can leave."
Snape turned his head but hesitated. He thought about lying. To spare her. But then he thought against it, thinking it would be an insult to her intelligence to lie to her when he knew she likely guessed the truth, and he told her, "Where else but a cave?" A lapse of silence passed before he said, "I'm sorry darling."
"Do you Severus—" Attina asked the man in a black suit with the pink rose in his lapel, as the ten of them stood waist-deep in lilac waters.
"I know..."
So they went.
“Yes.” He sighed, rolling his eyes, looking more disappointed with himself than with her. He glanced at her and upon noticing her baffled expression, he said, “I would never force you to do anything you didn’t want to do, Ariel.” With another roll of his eyes, he muttered, “God, I’m going soft.”
Tom barely remembered the other two children and when they approached the rock he sat on and discovered Tom was talking to a strange lady with blood-red hair and a fishtail swimming in a dim watery cave, he didn't chase after them as they ran away screaming.
"I'd like that."
Voldemort stood back up and looked at Draco, who was doing his best to not look like he wasn't scared shitless. He cleared his throat threateningly.
The old headmaster gave him a tender eyed smile, his face glowing with endearment. Then he tilted the neck of his bottle towards Snape and asked, "Will you drink with me now, Severus? As per an old dying man's request?"
"I am not a mean drunk," Hermione protested.
She was still humming, loudly, when she walked down to her kitchen and a horribly familiar voice greeted her from behind, "Good morning, Narcissa."
They did this position for several minutes without talking, overcome with intense desire neither one of them had felt in years. Then Ariel pushed him over, flipping him onto his back and climbed on top.
"Ariel, I'd like to introduce you to my family." Voldemort said as he gestured to the first row and informing her as they strolled by, "This was my maternal grandmother. This was my maternal grandfather. This was my maternal uncle…" Then they veered towards the tree, towards the little square grave marker, which bore only the name 'MEROPE' and the numbers 1907-1926 and he told her, "And this…was… my mother."
Harry followed him and slide into an unoccupied booth directly in front of Draco.
Snape arched his back and dug his erection into her. She kept hold, her fingers looped around his waistband as her head tilted back as another gasp rushed out of her. The idea of there being a white stain on the front of his pants from her pleasure burned him wildly and he rolled himself on top of her, showered her neck with kisses, her moans filling his ears with ecstasy. He might have burst then and there but he set his mind against it and paused from his kissing to whisper in her ear, "If you can wait my dear until we get to my office, so that I may fuck you properly on a bed, I promise you, Miss. Ariel I will do my absolute best to ravage you thoroughly."
Ariel grinned but her eyes drifted down to his mouth and the smile faded at the corners. "You know what the first thing I thought when I heard you say my name?"
Dumbledore batted the lightning bolt away, back towards him. Voldemort had to leap out of the way to avoid being hit and the white lightning shot out of the house, into the backyard, where it made contact with the trunk of the tree that Ariel slept beneath, leaving behind a vicious, gaping, smoldering tear.
"I wouldn't dare lie to you, My Lord. If anything, look at tonight."
"Oh, I'm so jealous, I've always wanted to see a basilisk. What was her name?"
He said it so matter-of-factly she wanted to cry but instead she gave him a small apologetic frown then let out a heavy sigh. What am I getting myself into? She thought as she looked down at the powder sitting the palm of her hand. She looked up, her red lips a tight line of worry, and told him, “Good-bye, professor.”
Severus's heart broke immediately. For he didn't know. But of course, he lied. "No. You are not going to die. Not tonight."
Dumbledore smiled at him and after a small pause asked, "Did you have a, somewhat, lovely break?"
"Oh, I thought we could take tea time to my place." He replied, off-handedly, as if he wasn't fantasying about gutting Lucius like a fish. He hissed for Nagini then added, "That way we could give Bella, Narcissa and, heh, Lucy a chance to get reacquainted. As a family."
"Yes."
"Aw, a sister day. Sounds delightful," he said with a grin, his head turned slightly towards the bookshelf. He had finally spotted the book he needed out of the corner of his eye. A slender black spellbook for which held the curse he needed. He grabbed the book with one hand and turned to leave, telling Ariel, "Well I won't keep you. I hope you enjoy your day. We should do lunch soon."
For a while all Ariel did when she got her legs was stroke them, her hands running up and down the contours of her new limbs, her teary-eyes unblinking as if the moment she looked away they would disappear on her again. She remained on the ground, on Snape's cloak, who took a seat beside her but kept his eyes away from her.
Ariel watched him then turned her focus to the venomous snake who was wriggling its way back towards her. She watched the predator slink onto the back of the couch and stick its blink-less face into her own, expecting praise. Ariel, fearing nothing, raised her hand and lavished gentle affections onto the viper.
The ghost child glared at him, two tears in his right eye and one in the left, but he kept looking into the mouth of the cave, wondering what it would be like to be swallowed up by a black hole.
"That's terrible." Narcissa agreed. "Was your friend…?"
"Hey, baby," called out a janky-looking wizard into her ear as she passed by him and four other similarly dressed wizards smoking together against a brick corner. He made loud kissy noises at her and cried out obnoxiously, "I love your hair. Love to see what color your nipple hair looks like."
"Ooh."
"Don't talk with your mouth full." Voldemort snapped, his constant fury breaking through.
Chapter Six: Voldemort's Hero
"Wait," Narcissa spoke up slowly. "So, this potion not only disguises your voice but it can transfer magical properties over to the drinker?"
"I know!" He said with a good-natured laugh. "I have definitely changed a lot since you last saw me. But then again," He gestured to her legs. "So, did you!" He took a step back and appraised her. "Wow. You haven't aged one bit! It's a good thing too. I almost didn't recognize you without the tail." Then he turned his head over his shoulder and addressed a stupefied Bellatrix, telling her with great reverence, "Bellatrix, I'm delighted to inform you that you are in the rare presence of royalty." He gave Ariel a flourish of his pale arm and announced, "This is Ariel, former siren princess, daughter of King Triton, granddaughter of King Neptune, and…" He turned his head back to Ariel and added somewhat tenderly, "A childhood hero to yours truly."
"I already asked her," Voldemort's irritated voice cut in. "And she's not going to kill you. So, you can stop slobbering on her already."
"You didn't." She stammered out as she used her sleeve to dry her face. "I just—I didn't—I didn't realize how much an impact I've made on you."
"I did." She scooted closer to him. He tensed, afraid that the closer she would get, the closer he would be to coming undone but didn't move away. "It seems me and you have a couple of things in common."
A silence drifted between them. Their eyes veering away from the other, too embarrassed by their impotence and self-loathing to be able to offer assurances. Until, Snape broke the quiet by asking, "Do you want to be a human?"
Snape pushed her hand away playfully then drew in to deliver a passionate kiss. They stood there, holding each other tenderly for a few heartbeats until Snape pulled away, used his head to gesture towards the door they stood in front of, and whispered, "This is it."
"Oh, I saw your copies of Potions Heads Monthly. That reminds me, I really want to introduce you to one of my followers. Good guy, kind of boring but I think you'd hit it off. He actually edits for that magazine."
"To see if I could get my land-dwelling crush to kiss me in three days without using my voice."
"Fair point," Snape replied quickly. "But wouldn't it be easier for you to ask her yourself?"
"I think we should."
She glowered, quacking with rage. He smiled, victoriously until Ariel threw her entire body at him. He reacted fast, but she caught onto him, and when he disappeared he took her with him.
She blinked at him but before she could answer Dennis's voice cried out, in confusion, from behind, "Do what? I didn't do anything."
His heart stopped. He's
"I thought you didn't care about her opinion." Little Tom retorted.
The atmosphere of the room changed profoundly. Silent fear died out to give way for murmurs of intrigue and eventual applause. Draco forced himself to clap despite the disgust that stabbed his stomach. If the Dark Lord liked someone, that meant they had to be fucked up beyond reproach and here he was practically gushing over this creature whom Draco couldn't help notice hadn't lifted her gaze away from the table as if embarrassed by the attention.
“Would it be inappropriate to ask you,” he said after he took his first sip, “If you slept well last night?”
What's the problem? Asked a secondary voice.
"Exactly," said Voldemort in a voice so flat and devoid of emotion it turned the hairs on the back of Snape's neck into porcupine quills. It didn't help in Ariel's sweet voice with her angelic face it only doubled his dread. Then in a brighter voice, he said, "I'm Aria and you're my sister Adella and we've been held hostage by Lord Voldemort for the last 4 months."
"Yes, him. Now I know you're only trying to do your job and I respect that, I do, but if I could just speak to this man for a few minutes…" Ariel started but her sentence trailed off as she watched the strange man lowered himself to his knees until his black eyes and her blue eyes were at the same level.
"I swear to you, nobody thinks any differently of you for your attachment to Ariel," Narcissa said. "We are all still so very terrified of you in every way imaginable."
"But...um...you know, I was thinking... it is pretty pathetic that my number one nemesis is still a child. I figured, eh, his birthday's a month from now. He can fight me like a man."
Tom's smile disappeared usurped by a scowl. "No." He said firmly. "And I don't need any."
He punctuated his statement by letting go of Draco's chin, leaving behind two red indents from where his thumb and index finger dug into him. He then raised his wand-carrying hand to above his shoulder and flicked it forward.
He got up and addressed Snape for the first time. "You better have good news."
Something crashed behind her and when she looked over her shoulder she saw that the cave—their cave—had fallen in on itself. Boulders filled the entranceway sealing it off to all, no doubt crushing the hundreds or so inferi that resided.
"Vicious lies," said Adella as she swam over to embrace her sister.
"For Poseidon's sake..."
Voldemort turned the book so that the book was split open to his last page. She caught a full view of the cover and recognized the ancient runes at once. Necromancy. Magic so dark it sent a shiver to her core just looking at the book. "I wanted to speak to your son."
Ariel nodded again, gently recoiling her spit-covered hand from Bellatrix's grip as she said with a sympathetic shrug, "These things happen. You weren't the first person to kidnap and I doubt you'll be the last. At least, now we both know."
Together, they walked over to the fireplace. Snape performed Wingardium Leviosa to remove the boiling cauldron from the fire. Ariel extinguished the flame with a glass of water found on his desk. She stepped into the fireplace and gave Snape one last adoring smile. "It was nice to meet you, Professor Severus."
"It's—it's like he's—" Bellatrix sputtered; her fury was too fast for her own thoughts. "Fangirling."
Ariel sniggered. "Mine."
Bellatrix's head shot up high enough for her to peak through her errant locks of hair to cast a stunned look between the pair. Ariel nodded and smiled at her reassuringly while Voldemort gave her a hard look that said, bitch, you are so lucky.
When he woke up the world was black and there was something covering his face. He thrashed for his wand then shot upward, pointing his arm straight out at—Ariel.
"Really?"
Even as he led them away from the comforts of the summer sun to the coolness of the cave, they believed his lies.
Ariel chuckled, then pecked his nose. "Got any floo powder?" She took the crown from her messenger bag and pushed it towards his stomach. "I'll pay you back I promise."
"Because! I—I think…" He stopped and sorted his thoughts, searching for the right words to explain what he was feeling. It couldn't be dying. As he said, he was never going to die. And he couldn't be dying because Potter's still in school and if he was near a Horcrux he would know. So why did his head hurt? Why did his stomach feel like it was in knots? And why the hell did his heart, which he swore didn't exist up until ten minutes ago, feel like it was floating around in a milky way of contentment?
But Voldemort didn't turn his head. He continued giving her this hard stare like he was only now realized her defiance.
"That depends. What's your definition of 'best behavior'?"
"It's a graveyard."
"My Lord," Snape cut pleadingly. "Ariel is the love of my life. I adore that creature. I want to spend the rest of my life earning her love, worshipping her the way she deserves. And should she decide one day that she isn't happy with me anymore and does leave me I'll be grateful to have her in my life as long as I did."
"No," Voldemort said, his voice soft with a genuineness that Snape had never heard, or expected from the Dark Lord, before. "No, I meant everything I said in there."
The giant cobra dropped from the ceiling and fell into Ariel's lap but she continued to lavish the beast with pets like Nagini was merely a friendly dog.
Draco watched, numbly, as Snape whispered something into her ear. Ennui swam through him like a virus. Here was this woman, the only person in the world who could possibly be spared by the Dark Lord's bloodlust, sobbing, looking utterly sick with fear. He knew the sounds of utter, hopeless fear. He knew those frightened tears like sleet or rain. But if she—Lady Ariel, Miss Hero, the Dark Lord's Favorite—was scared shitless, how was there any hope for him and his family?
"Oh." It came out in a soft breath of a moan. Then she gave him an intrigued smile that could have chipped an iceberg. "A man of more than one passion, I see."
"Of course I—Ariel I love you more than I love anyone or anything in this entire universe. I love you more than I love myself and I love myself way too fucking much." Ariel smiled so hard her face looked like it was going to crack down the middle. "I can't believe you didn't know that by now." He said, offended.
"Eh, I'll do it right before class Monday." Ron shrugged. He looked up at the glass ceiling which bore a beautiful, clear, cloudless Fall sky and inhaled deeply. "It's a good day."
Ariel gave him a tucked-in lopsided grin. "That's very true. You were always good to me."
Snape stood quietly, suppressing the urge to smile and the innate fear growing in his chest while he gauged Voldemort's reaction.
It took sixteen bodies for him to admit he couldn't murder his problems away and he finally fled to the one place he knew nobody would look for him.
Neither of them waited to hear the rest of the announcement before they pulled each other into a passionate kiss cementing their decision to spend the rest of this Hellish lifetime together, whatever that might entail.
"You don't have to keep thanking me."
"I will if you tell me about Voldemort's plans," Harry said.
"Y-you scribe to Potions Heads Monthly?" He asked.
She held his gaze then said, "You don't have to do this." She grabbed his hand and squeezed it tight. "Please. Let the boy live, Tom, please. You don't have to be this person. You're better than this, Tom."
It went this way for months.
"Thanks," Ariel said sheepishly as she took a swig from her cup to dull the pain in her backside from where she fell. She glanced around their new location and knew at once Narcissa chose to start the tour with the in-home laboratory. Her eyes widened with delight spotted shelves upon shelves of jarred ingredients all of which were kept labeled, alphabetized, kept evenly apart, and, most impressively, completely dust-free. "Oh, my cod…Your lab is…gorgeous." Ariel punctuated her awe with a sharp gasp for her blue eyes found a giant golden cauldron sitting against the corner. Her heart nearly exploded from her chest as she drew closer and discovered, "Oh, my fucking COD! Is this the Deluxe Circe Self-Stirrer 5000?!"
"Now," the Dark Lord began as he started to walk slowly around the table, "At first, when I found out, I was furious. Absolutely furious. After all, how could we lose five members in a random Thursday morning squabble, right? But then, I found out who the person responsible for such an attack was…" The Dark Lord turned on his heel and started back to the chair. Everyone waited with bated breath as they watched him return to his chair and rubbed his chalky hand against the ornate back of the chair before he turned his attention back to the room and said, "Then, that's when I realized—this was my fault."
"Why are you doing this?"
"I love it."
"I'm not worried she'll betray us. She's made it very clear she despises his actions more than anyone. But... I'm worried... I'm worried when it will come time to...she won't be able to live with the guilt."
"That depends. What day is it?"
Chapter 27: Love and Rage
Ariel made a derisive snort. "I might as well be." Then her angry face contorted as another crying fit came over her. She squeezed her mouth in an attempt to make the tears stop but he quickly succumbed to weeping and the two men had to watch, helplessly, as she croaked out, "I loved that boy so much." She buried her head in her hands and moaned, "I loved him so much…" She lifted her head and told them, "I would've adopted him in a heartbeat if I could've. If it wasn't illegal…If I had legs…you have no idea how often I fantasized about what I would've done…I would've taken him away from that awful place…" She let out a sad laugh. "I would've kicked the crap out of every worker in that shithole orphanage and then I would've loved that little boy 'til my last dying breath." She wiped her face with her sleeves and forced out a bitter laugh, "I guess I still do. God, what's wrong with me?"
Only then, he thought to himself bitterly as he made his way alongside the breezy lakeside of Hogwarts, will I finally be—
She looked to the ground and said, "shit." She turned to her right and began rummaging through a red cloth bag which was teeming with magazines. "I was hoping you were the man I was looking for."
"I just want to see if he could make it sound sexy," said Arista as she made her way to embrace Ariel. She glanced over her shoulder, her bright orchid eyes blinking curiously at the young man who hung back at the edge of the lagoon. When she let go, she asked her sister, "Aren't you going to introduce us to your shy friend?"
Ariel turned her head over her shoulder and gave him a thoughtful smile. "Yes and no. I mean, I won the bet but the prize wasn't worth all that much to begin with." She whipped her head back to the chopping board and said, "But isn't that how it always goes? You sacrifice everything for something you think you want, just to get it and realize, this isn't what I wanted at all."
"I know! You must be excited! Now you'll have two sons!"
"You're welcome to have some, but sadly they haven't invented an allergy potion yet that gets you drunk," Tom lied after another gulp.
Ariel let out a hearty laugh in spite of herself. "Well, I see your views on sex and love stayed the same."
"It should be. It is 200-year-old vampire wine after all." Narcissa informed with faint pride as she poured herself a second cup.
"This is about you achieving apotheosis! Don't lie to me. I know you, Tom. You want so badly to be immortal you’ll take the whole world down with you! And exploiting people's hates and fears into getting what you want!"
"Don't come near me." She ordered, snapping her head at Snape who, every time he tried to draw closer to her, to whisk her somewhere safe for the look of disdain in Voldemort's eyes petrified him to his core, he was forced away like they were two opposing magnets. Then she whipped her head at her son, mouth opened ready to use her voice but he was too quick.
By the time midnight came, so did Ariel. Six times. She also came to the sleepy realization, half a second before she passed out from sheer exhaustion, was that her infatuation for him had doubled—if not quadrupled—in that one night. And she knew it wouldn't be long before she would be truly deeply madly in love with this man.
"…Draco Malfoy…cleaned something?"
"He-who-needs-to-get-stabbed-in-the-face," giggled Alana.
"I got you something."
AUTHOR'S NOTE: MAD SEX SCENES AHEAD
It was the start of the spring semester and Dumbledore was pissed.
"Tattoos are, technically, scars."
"Are you sure?" Dumbledore inquired, incredulously. "I mean, this is Voldemort we're talking about. Voldemort can't love. Direct-descendent from Salazar Slytherin, the product of date rape potion, soul split seven times, talks to snakes, can't feel love. That's his whole thing, right?"
"Oh, I know you swear. Because make one mistake—one tiny mistake and…" He chuckled darkly then told a terrified Greyback, "Well, let's just say. If you think I'm scary…wait 'til you meet her."
She opened one eye and discovered a glass of water floating in front of her. To the right, in a chair in the shadowy corner, sat Voldemort.
"There's no way I can go to class today. I haven't slept in weeks. I'm so run down I'm convinced if I stay awake another hour, I'm going to literally drop dead. I need a sleeping draught." Snape would have told him no had the boy not added, with the most desperate little voice, "Please."
Ariel turned to the dementor and told it, "Open the cell."
He didn't even flinch. He merely met her glares with his own.
"God, you're worse than a cat in heat," Voldemort remarked, half-annoyed and half-amused by the obvious lechery in her face.
Ariel shook her head, grinning. "Swear to Cod. He literally pooped his pants."
Narcissa waited a few months after the war ended and a few months more until Snape's injuries healed to visit them. It was nearly six months when she dropped by Spinner's End.
His eyes rounded with mild surprise. "Oh wow. It's been six weeks." He let out a small, delirious chuckle of a man who had discovered he had unintentionally done something naughty. "That's a new record for me." But when he caught her worried eye, he exhaled pensively and said, "You look like you're on your way to the beach."
"Because…" He started then stopped. He almost told her the truth. He never told adults the truth if he could avoid it. Yet this adult—this mermaid, who despite being a different species than him was still older than him and thus considered to be another odious adult to him—was threatening to break his self-imposed rule of never telling anymore what happened at Wool's.
“Was a perfect gentleman.”
"Good morning to you, Lord Voldemort." He returned as they shook hands and headed to the living room to conduct business. "Though I can see, you are having a great morning already." He let out a knowing laugh then asked. "How much did that little chew toy set you back?"
“And I want you to know…” He whispered as he lifted his head to look her in the eyes. “You were the best mother a bastard like me could ever ask for.”
She shook her head eyes still focused on the dark ceiling. "I was there for a kid who needed me." She turned on her side to face him and gave him a small but genuine smile. "Not my fault that kid turned out to be the evilest wizard of all time."
It started off an idle, mundane day for Lord Voldemort. Such as it happens during war. Not every day's going to be all meetings murder and mayhem. Even Voldemort had do-nothing days.
They glanced around to see they were all grins.
They were wrong, of course.
The content from Ariel's face faded into unmitigated cockiness. "Wanna bet?"
Voldemort beamed at her, like it was the only thing he’d ever wanted to hear. “Great.” He said with a breathy laugh. “Let me clean all this first and,” (he looked down at his blood-caked robes) “Myself. And then, we can do…breakfast?”
"Oh really? That's how it seems. Maybe he wishes his son was more proper and friendly." Draco was starting to lose it and dug his nails into the palms of his hands. "You have no room to talk Potter! Let me remind you who actually has a father here. Yours left you behind and let
The two stood face to face with each other, it being night again. Harry had found Draco sneaking out again and took this chance to maybe get Draco to at least show interest. But he knew the boy was stubborn.
Harry smelt more like black tea and firewood, Draco literally fell in love with the scent. He could barely smell it on the sweatshirt, but now that he was chest to chest with Harry, the scent was as clear as day. Harry's arms touched Draco's legs and couldn't help but to think how soft they were. Like what did this boy use for lotion? They were really soft, like really soft. The first few times it was on accident, but then after the 3rd time it was on purpose, and he laid his arms on Draco's pale smooth legs. Harry thought his legs were way too soft and pretty to be out freely in weather like this.
source of light?! We don't have any light!" He yells. "She's talking about the moonlight Malfoy." Harry seethed with crossed arms.
"Anyway, I bet you can't say 'my name is Harry Potter' in French!" Harry thought for a good minute and groaned. "I don't even know French!" Draco snorted in a very un-Malfoy manner. "How don't you know how to speak French?! It's literally so easy!" Draco says with a small twinkle in his eyes that Harry catches. "Okay, then teach me how to say 'my name is Harry Potter'."
It was so random but Harry had a feeling Pansy was the one who initiated it and Draco just took that chance to spite Harry. Maybe Harry could confirm that Draco likes him.
"Exactly, now all we need to do is keep walking left." Draco explains and Harry nods. They start walking left and within 7 minutes, the air started getting colder. "Bloody hell it's cold!" Harry rolls his eyes and eyed Draco's appearance. "Yeah well, no one told you to walk out your room with barely any clothes on." Draco quietly seethed and was mentally planning Harry's death. "Shut up Potter! No one asked you to wake me up and ruin my rest with your little savior adventure." Harry glared at Draco and scoffed in the direction of the blonde.
that Draco finds he can tolerate it quite easily. Plus Potter's taken up the guitar recently, so there's that. He's not very good, but it's sickeningly endearing hearing him trying to strum and sing along to
“In you come, gents. Don’t be shy,” called the old man, brandishing a small silver musical triangle. “Sit anywhere you like. I’m Fordus McPartlin—but please call me Ford!—and I’m a Magi-doula. I’ll be your guide to the final weeks, days and minutes of your miraculous and extraordinary journey from pregnancy to fatherhood.” Fordus beamed widely at them as they all glanced furtively around and then took their seats. Draco opted for a chair—there was no way he’d get back up off the floor by himself if he tried a bean bag, though they did look extremely comfy.
“You’re… you’re fine,” Draco
going to think hard about whether he’d try to find out who the father was, and that he really, really hoped they could stay friends, because he was beginning to like Draco, quite a lot. It was an awfully great deal for Draco to process in the space of sixty seconds, and so Draco ended up saying, “Well, I like you quite a lot too,” and kicking himself because what the fuck,

to be okay.”
At breath number twenty-two, a bare chest presses itself against his back with a mild zap. Draco freezes, not daring to breathe or move a muscle.
Of course, so too faltered his spell; there was simply no hope for it. And it struck him, as Fordus gave a sympathetic
“Er, I suppose we can head back home then,” Harry said. “The wind’s beginning to pick up.”
Pansy snickered as Draco’s face coloured and a broad grin crept onto Harry’s face.
"Give over you prat," Draco chided, levitating the teabags into the bin, "and don't mock it before you've tried it."
Malfoy put his mouth close to Harry’s ear, his voice like honey. “It’s the
He'd lit a pile of dry leaves at the base of the railway bridge. They crackled to life, and Draco'd laughed and grabbed my wrist and pressed me against the fence.
Out in the corridor, Potter lets out a groan. Merlin, does he even realise what he sounds like?
Potter's fingers traced the crease between Draco’s thigh and groin. "So, I can’t touch you? How's that gonna work, mate, you want me to wank you off with sexy magic vibes or something?" Draco snorted and then thrust against Potter, letting his erection introduce itself finally to Potter’s hand.
Draco led Harry by the hand to the guest bedroom. Earlier, Draco had explored the house and finally found where Harry had unceremoniously dumped all the baby clothes and bedding and rattles and, of course, all the blue knitted things—he was quite amused at how wrong Molly had been about
"Seems safe," he shrugged.
Harry's face colours, and he immediately scrubs his hand through his hair.

“He didn’t glare at me or mention my past mistakes, so I think it went alright.” Draco didn't want to get his hopes up, but he couldn't pretend it went badly either. “Give me a moment. I need to Quick-Quotes a special menu for you to bring out to his partner.” Draco retrieved his charmed quill and some Floyd’s headed parchment from the small office at the back and began to dictate.
“Yeah, sorry about that. That sort of shit happens to me a lot. You’ll get used to it.”
“What is it?”
In the end he decided just to choose a memory he'd used before and hope for the best. Either way he was undoubtedly going to badly embarrass himself. And in front of Patronus-prodigy-Potter to boot.
His eyes widened as she sobbed. "Who is saying such things to Mrs Potts?"
——— [o] ———
James went next. “Thank you for saving my daddy when he was a baby. I’m really sad you had to die though. I hope we can keep visiting you here. It’s sorta nice.” James turned then and punched Teddy in the arm, and Teddy said “Oi, git,” and Draco rolled his eyes.
Potter also says nothing. The clock ticks, the hands bearing their names dead centre in the trouble zone.

"I think I understand," Draco cuts in. His blood is boiling, and it almost makes him forget the intense itching all over his body. "Joanna, can I just ask you one more thing? And please answer me honestly. I am an expert Legilimancer, but I'd really rather not invade your mind."

"Potter," Draco said warningly, "if you're going to stand there snickering at least have the decency to shove your head into a
"What was that, Potter?" Draco questioned him.
Harry grins. “Nian monster. Okay.”

. Draco throws back his head and cries out, the loose treble of it soaring into the air and followed almost immediately by a lower tone, Potter's lusty moan, as their thighs interlock and begin to move together. Potter's gorgeously hard, and he's pressing soft gyrating thrusts into Draco's crotch, their bare cocks urging together, lubed by a whispered spell, insistent,
He tongued her folds, pressing it flat and swerving it in between her lips and against her clit furiously. Her insides vibrated with delight as he continued to lick her thoroughly. She whimpered, her hands rushing to the top of his head, signaling to him to get as close as he could. He grabbed her by the thighs and pulled her closer to him until she felt the bridge of his nose furrow her mound while his tongue swished, circled, and kneaded her.
"Merlin's beard," said Voldemort with a small proud chuckle, "You're speechless. I left a siren speechless."
But the burning in her chest, nausea in her blood, and the stabbing pain in her hand told her otherwise.
"Every year it's something!" He raved from his desk, throwing his bad hand in the air while his good hand cradled a bottle of Firewhiskey. "Every year! Merlin's beard I can't wait to die."
Then she turned around and revealed the loveliest face and the prettiest smile which she delivered onto him, welcomingly. His face went cold with fear.
Greyback could only whimper submissively as Voldemort lifted his weight from the man's throat. Greyback gasped, coughed, trembled, then gaped as painful oxygen rushed to his bruised lungs. Voldemort crouched down, slowly, relishing the fear and agony that surged within the werewolf's face as he desperately, but ineffectively, tried to thank the Dark Lord for sparing his life.
“She knows I’m screwing Severus, right?” Ariel asked.
"Yes, it's an honor to give you my room while I'm away," Draco said hurriedly like a man on his way to confession he didn't want to make. "But I want to throw this out there: all that stuff you see on my walls…it's for a project."
Ariel was utterly speechless. She merely stared at the undead army in thunderstruck agog as they groaned and rasped hungrily and roared at the irritating light and meandered about mindlessly.
"You always knew I'd be great in whatever I did." He said after a while. She glanced at him. He was wearing an arrogant smile.
After a while, once the shock wore down, did Ariel push herself from the ground, her knees wobbling as she struggled for balance and straighten her back. Once her knees were still and she looked down at her own feet, her toes wiggling against the soft, damp fabric, did she smile. And from that smile came an explosion of joy.
"That's because you were always good to me." Then, he said, his voice soaked with a tenderness he wished he showed more often, "And I'm forever grateful that you came into my life."
Ruth bleated, lazily, as if to say, I'm just a goat what do you want me to do?
There were a few, audible gasps.
She gently touched Snape on the forehead, who dutifully continued to lap up her throbbing genitals, and when he stopped to see what she needed, she said with a pant, "Please fuck me."
"I got them," Bellatrix said with cruel pride. "But," her face turned from joking to serious, "she has no ID. And the ridiculous part, My Lord, she didn't even use a wand."
Look at you, a voice in his head said. A piece of shit like you actually did something decent for once.
However, despite Draco's disbelief, he couldn't stop the smile that etched on his face. His fingers shook slightly but that wasn't unusual. Quite normal actually. Harry had such a big impact on him, and he kinda liked it.
All while Harry was becoming all mushy with fondness, Draco still stood in the hallway with extremely flushed cheeks. He reached to touch his lips and could still feel Harry's lips on his. It was so weird, but the good kind.
The two boys were both in their nightclothes since they were sneaking out during nighttime when everyone else was asleep. Harry undoubtedly did have more clothes on than Draco; who had worn some high-waisted black shorts that had soft material on the inside. And a long-sleeved blue striped shirt that rested right above where his shorts began. His hair was untampered with and quite bouncy. It looked thicker than it did before now that he didn't have gel in it. Harry didn't pay much attention to his attire, but now that he had cooled down a little and there was more silence, he just noticed Draco's appearance.
Harry thought it was weird, but kind of cute. It was cute if the reason behind all his tenseness was because Harry was staring at him. Harry wouldn't have taken Draco for the shy type but he's proving him otherwise.
Draco's head laid on Harry's chest, and everything seemed to disappear as the only thing he could hear was Harry's heartbeat. It was slow and weirdly soothing. Draco wouldn't mind staying like this, but that would also be embarrassing. Draco's scent was very addicting, and Harry really tried to not sniff it too much, but how could he not when the blonde boy was so close to him. He smelled like the scent vanilla Carmel latte.
"I fancy you too.." Draco stood there, still processing what he was hearing. He usually has some sort of comeback for everything, but at this moment, he just couldn't find any words.
If he has to be brave for both of them, then so be it. He has no problem in doing so. As long as he isn't wasting his energy on someone who doesn't feel the same way. Which he hopes isn't the case.
(A/N: I'm aware he didn't receive the map until his 3rd year. But it makes the story end faster so... yeah 💀)
Like if he kissed him? It certainly wouldn't kill Malfoy. And if he was wrong about everything, he will back off and just accept Draco may never reciprocate the same feelings he has for him.
He had some evidence to back it up but he wanted proof. Once class was over he and his friends chatted while walking towards their next destination. But their conversation ended when he bumped into someone.
Harry narrowed his eyes in confusion at Draco's reaction toward his girlfriend when he found that he looked quite annoyed. He looked as if he didn't want to be there at that moment.
Harry pulled him in and hovered his lips over Draco's, but stopped before their lips met. Draco's eyes widened and his fingers found themselves gripping on Potters sleeve.
She stops and turns to the enemies. "We're here. Now good luck." She says and Draco looked at her as if she just murdered his mother. "Wait what?! We don't get any light?! Or directions?!" Harry furrowed his brows at the forest which was illuminated by the moonlight that was extra bright that night. "No Mr. Malfoy, you do not receive any extra source of light." Draco scoffs and walks up to her. "What do you mean
save you. Pathetic to be honest." Harry wanted to hex him but decided against it. "The only thing that is pathetic, is you Malfoy." Draco's eyes sharpened and his nails were definitely creating marks.
"Stop it, the both of you! You both have gotten in trouble for the same thing as last year. Have you not learned your lesson?" She asked and both boys stood quietly. She nods her head in realization. "Okay, I know exactly how to handle this." She raises a brow at Draco who looks to be unsteady.
The wind blew a little colder and so Draco brought his legs up to his chest and rubbed them as he leaned his head against a tree. He swore he was gonna get frostbite out there but there's nothing much he could do. "Say Malfoy..." Harry had a question that lingered on his mind for a while. Draco rolls his eyes instantly when he hears his voice but still responds. "What?" Harry thinks for a few more moments before asking, "Have you ever been kissed before?" He genuinely wanted to know if his enemy had his first kiss or not.
"No one asked you, Potter! So shut up!" Draco spat venomously at him, leaving no room for kindness anywhere. He turns to McGonagall and looks annoyedly at her as he taps his foot. "And how do you go about us only having the moon as our light source? And where do we even go to find the spring water?!" Draco had so many questions that weren't getting answered and his nerves were just growing by the second.
"No your dating her because you don't want anyone to know you fancy me," Harry says with zero hesitation. Now, this was the risky part, but he just had to follow through. No matter what Draco's insults were.
The two boys continued to walk a few minutes more but then a groan was heard by Draco. Harry raised a brow at him and looked at him annoyedly. "What is it this time?" The sarcastic tone had Draco on the edge of snapping at him but he holds it back for later. "We are going nowhere! We probably aren't even going north!" Draco fully stops and looks to be refusing to move another step. Harry rolls his eyes and shrugs. "So? What do you want me to do about it?" Draco narrowed his eyes at the raven and sneered.
"No I can... you're pretty good at potions." Harry bit his lip and did not expect himself to say that. "Damn right I am." Draco gloatingly says with a small smirk. The two continued to walk as Harry spoke up. "I bet you'd hate to smirk." Draco rolls his eyes but drops the smirk on his lips. Draco shivered as the weather suddenly dropped and his limbs were now freezing. "I bet you'd hate giving me your sweatshirt." Draco was about to smirk, but then remembered he wasn't supposed to.
Harry noticed for the first time ever, Draco looked shy and was blushing furiously on top of that. This boy couldn't get any cuter to him. He finally had his first kiss and it was absolutely divine. It was not only divine because he did it with someone beautiful, but someone not expected. Draco felt the same way, he had no idea kissing felt that good. But he figured it mattered who you were kissing, and he assumed it would probably only feel this good with one person. There was only one person who had managed to make Draco's heart soar sky-high.
Under Draco's breath, he muttered, "And he'd still look better than you." No one heard him. No one, except Harry. Of course, he has to strain his hearing to hear but he heard what Draco had said.
Was the goal to caught his attention? Or to prove that he could get a girlfriend before him? Or maybe it was an attempt to make him jealous? If that was the case, he has succeeded for once in his life.
Draco slipped past Pansy and managed to walk away from the verbal fight without anyone noticing him. Well, all except Harry. Before he disappeared, his eyes met Harry's but he immediately turned his head away.
Does this mean Draco likes Potter? Were his observations correct? The chance of Draco liking Potter was becoming higher and higher the longer Harry observed his actions and body language.
"And who are you to make such accusations?!" Draco furrowed his brows and crossed his arms. "I do not remember asking for your opinion." Draco snarled and rolled his eyes at the boy.
"Oh please! I bet you'd run off crying if I actually fought you." Draco provoked with a condescending smirk. "Remind me who won last time we fought?" Harry sharply retorted. Draco snarled at him but remained the same. "I would have won if you weren't a part snake." Harry stomped up to Draco and glared hard at the boy. "Oh yeah? I bet you if you didn't have your dearest daddy's money, you wouldn't act all big and bad."
( 2nd year )
Or not that surprised because so many people have a crush on that boy. Harry doesn't think Draco realizes that everyone knows how much the girls adore him.
"I just don't see any connection. You don't even look like you like her that much. If I didn't know better, I'd say you're dating her without having actual feelings." Harry held his chin up and lifted his brow.
"And how do you know how to navigate us using the stars?" Draco walks toward him and points upward. "My mom taught me how to read the stars in case of an emergency." Harry nods in realization. "So how do you know which star will lead us there then? They all look the same." Draco rolls his eyes at Harry and shakes his head. "They actually don't look the same. And the star that will lead us is Polaris. The north star. All I have to do is look for the angle degrees and constellations of the stars and I can easily lead us to the spring water."
He stands at close eye level with him and starts straight into his grey eyes. "You don't feel anything? Tell me that with your own words then." Draco once again became paralyzed when Harry grabbed his hand.
"Yeah... the dark forest..." Draco says lowly under his breath as a shiver goes through his body at the memories of last year. McGonagall nods at Draco and turns to Harry who rolled his eyes. "Mr. Potter?" Harry looks up to meet her eyes and nods. "You two need to collect the dark forest's spring water. And you will come back not bickering with each other. You will be back in no less than 1 hour." She explains and Draco has made a mental note to put Professor McGonagall on his bye-bye list when he blows the world up.
He doesn't want Draco to be with her. Nor does he want to watch his crush dealing with someone he doesn't even like. He doesn't even know how the couple came to be. It happened over the summer.
"Anyway, see you around Malfoy." Potter was quickly out of Draco's sight and returned to his room with the biggest smile he's ever had. He kissed Malfoy, and he absolutely loved it. His lips were so soft.
As lunch ended and everyone left, Harry had caught Pansy flirting with Draco while he was walking with his friends to his next class. He felt a little jealous but she was his girlfriend.
He grasped the map and scanned the map not so
His eyes glance from Pansy to Harry but it diverts so fast that you'd have to be closely watching to be able to have caught him. But it was a good thing Harry was very observant and caught on to this.
"Have you?" Draco asks with a raised brow as he scans Harry's face. His features were illuminated by the moonlight and quite frankly, Draco found it hypnotizing seeing Harry's already bright emerald eyes glow even more. It looked magical to Draco. "Umm no.." Harry replies and turns to Draco who turned away when Harry's eyes met his. Draco's eyes no longer looked grey but looked like a glittery silver. A color that mimicked the moon.
Harry just couldn't believe he even got the chance to do that. And he wanted to do it again, but he wanted to talk to Malfoy before that happened, so maybe he could get more of a reaction out of him.
Harry blinked at Draco and tilted his head. He wasn't stupid, he knew what Draco was about to say. But he wasn't gonna embarrass him since he felt the same way. He also didn't like girls, at least not in that way. Harry saw Draco shiver again, even with the sweatshirt on, and looked to be really suffering from those shorts on. His eyes landed on Dracos hairless slim legs that evidently didn't have any muscle. They actually looked quite fragile. As did his arms too.
One, he's planning on something revengeful and nasty. Or two, he fancies Harry. Harry knew these two were very different and the second option was very far-fetched. However, he still thought it was possible.
There's no way Draco Malfoy, Harry's enemy would say such a thing without only hatred toward the boy. He had to feel something more. More than just hatred. And Harry was certain this wasn't one-sided.
The forest was dark but the moon really did light up the place. It would actually look beautiful if it wasn't for the dead plants and scary-looking trees. Harry stops and looks around in confusion. "Where is north?" He asks and Draco does the same. "Uhh, how would I know?" He rolls his eyes and just continues to walk. "Fine, let's just walk in a random direction then." Harry says and kicks the dead leaves on the ground.
"Struggle to…?" Potter prompted after a few moments.
Draco laughed drily, "Oh, alcohol: best known motivator of one Pansy Parkinson. And speaking of the

Or perhaps, he thought to himself with a smirk as he landed on the cobblestones of Diagon Alley, he needed to call on someone who had an especially wicked way with words.

“Let’s go,” said Blaise, pushing the door open.
but the words wouldn't form in his mouth. A cacophony of laughter and expectant banging erupted around him, and the world tilted and jolted violently. Harry's whole body tensed against the sudden movements. His mind caught the end of a spell, scarcely audible above the intensifying din.
Draco sighed, both in exasperation and relief. He’d had a knot in his chest for the past few days, and though it was likely heartburn in part, it felt a bit like worry too. What was worse, is that it had meant he’d been in no frame of mind to practise the charm.

Draco tried again to speak to Potter at the break but he couldn’t catch him alone. He was deep in conversation with Neil and Langston one minute and then laughing with Francesco and Sam a few minutes later. As he drained the last of his tea, Allison sidled up to him.

with his parents, and Potter just stuck out a hand, black with dirt, and he thanked Draco.
"I'm- It's not a good time. I'm actually in the middle of something."
“Pregnancy can cause many changes to a man’s body, as you well know. Your partner may feel insecure or need reassurance about how his body looks. On top of that, sexual desire during pregnancy varies from man to man. Your pregnant partner may be less interested in sex, or more interested. Discuss this in your pairs, and remember to both be open and receptive to how each other feels about this.”
Harry exhaled heavily. "Are we in yet, or are there more barriers?" he asked.
. Snape had the Mark, and he could cast a proper corporeal Patronus. It was a doe.”
She lifted them up. "What are they supposed to be, darling?"
"I don't think anyone will ever find the answer to that, Potter. But if they do, I'll be the first in line to ask why the buggering fuck I've been head over heels in love with Harry Potter since the speccy idiot rode his broom around a fucking Hungarian Horntail at the age of fourteen." He clears his throat which has become extremely parched all of a sudden. "That sort of display of valour just...
But by far the best thing about being flatmates is that Harry Potter, first thing in the morning, is an unintentional thirst trap.
He's there as always. In my dream. In the blazing glare of that blasted railway station, scuffing the toe of his trainer into some imaginary dirt.
"What are you doing?" Harry blurted, goosebumps rising over the skin of his neck and scalp. "I mean, don't stop, I like it. But..."
But Draco doesn't feel any different. Just a bit... empty.
. Prickly? But different. That’s what’s odd. Not odd you liking your belly, that’s, well, that’s understandable. It actually does suit you. How’s that for open and receptive?”
“And that’s okay! You guys can do what you like. You were a couple for years, it’s understandable you both still have feelings for each other. I’m happy for you. Well, happy-ish.” He gave a listless chuckle.
"Well, aren't we clever!" Potter sits forward in the chair. "So how did we manage to disarm it without realising? Wait," he grins, "it was my magical healing spunk, wasn't it?"
The Magi-doula’s voice interrupted them. “Right, fellows, back to your seats, or your cushions. I have some slides to go through on hypnobirthing.”
"Oh, thank you
Sitting atop his neatly folded shorts, t-shirts, and smalls, was a thick folder with '
there and then, they did agree to meet up again during the week for a smoothie at Energising Elixirs, and a good old gossip about their classmates, new and old (apparently Sam had let slip that his big brother Oliver was dating Puddlemere’s coach, and one of Goyle’s clients revealed that Terry Boot had had a face lift), and Draco went back to work after that lunch break with the biggest, stupidest smile on his face, but at least he now knew why he was unable to explain why to Suada.
At the addition of her own honorific title, the kettle emitted a pleased puff of steam. "The unfortunate thing is, as Kreacher so... um,
Draco nodded. “No one was more surprised than me that Harry showed an interest.”
He’s got more used to it now. Now he knows that Potter just doesn't possess the ability to get himself fully dressed until approximately sixty seconds before he leaves the flat, and Draco has got very good at diverting his attention to toast and orange juice and feeding Angus, their owl (
Walking back through to the living room, he spotted his luggage by the door. He crouched down and wandlessly extended his magic, attempting to run a diagnostic which he would have normally done with his wand. Detecting only a simple locking charm, he focused his mind and firmly said

But. It sort of
“You’re gonna be an amazing dad,” Harry said then, and Draco shrugged.
"Oh, for fuck's sake!" Robards finally barks, throwing his hands up. "Get yourselves to Mungo's right this minute! And just be thankful you've both got a spotless record."
Draco stared at him a moment. "Harry, of all the strange—

"No!" Draco snapped. The git clearly hadn't been listening to a word.
"Feels nice," Draco says, wanting to reassure Potter and encourage him to keep petting his hair.
"Well, if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black," Draco retorted hotly after Harry had just branded him 'unreasonable'. In any other situation he'd have laughed at the idiom, particularly considering the kettle was a Black family heirloom, and so he technically

is he so neat?”
He couldn’t Apparate, and walking to Harry’s place was too far. He wondered if he could contact Harry somehow. Did the hospital have an owlery? But that would take too long.
"Of course. I've got a tasty dish in mind, using my succulent home-grown aubergines."
Potter stares at him, blinking madly, the gormless twit.
, thought Draco.
Draco held his gaze for a moment, until the sound of the toaster broke the silence. "It's a lovely thought, Harry, and I'm up now anyway. We can eat in the garden, it's a beautiful morning." He made his way out to the garden.

conducive to the establishment of a happy household."
Until third year, when the opportunity arose for his costume-making skills to come to the fore. Gryffindor were playing Ravenclaw, and it was the perfect chance to give that twerp Potter the fright of his poor charmed life. Draco spent an entire week making costumes for himself, Vincent and Gregory, using the length of black cotton and some second-hand robes he'd purchased on their Hogsmeade trip the weekend before.
Potter blew across the surface of his tea and then took a noisy slurp. “You having a boy or a girl?”
“Yes. Yes, of
Fordus looked between the two of them, beaming. “How
“Oh? And where are they? Are they alright?” Harry’s shoulders tensed. “I’m here with Ginny and Luna. Merlin. I haven’t seen them for a good hour. I should check that they’re okay.”
"—says it's a private matter. He was very insistent." She sounded almost as pissed off with Malfoy as she was with Harry himself.
The problem was Harry had no idea where on Earth to go. He'd never actually been abroad except on missions, and there'd been little time for sightseeing or trips to beaches on those. He'd had a weekend away with Ginny one time back when they'd been a thing, before work and conflicting social diaries, and frankly a large degree of disinterest in any sort of intimacy—and an even larger degree of disinterest in the opposite sex (on both their parts)—got in the way. And besides, they'd only gone camping in Dorset, so he wasn't sure that counted as a proper holiday. Particularly when he kept waking up in the tent in a cold sweat shouting for Ron and Hermione. In hindsight it had maybe been a bit

. The kitchen was slowly filling up with steam as they exchanged terse epithets.
Potter's neck and ears were red. “Yeah, I’m sorry, I just couldn’t hold back. I haven't really felt like doing that… sort of thing for months now. It’s nice.”
Seconds later, Draco's zipping up his bag when the bathroom door opens again, and Potter's looking angry.
Luna’s touches felt lovely too.
Draco expected Potter to look embarrassed and perhaps even apologise. He was already thinking of ways he could help Potter fix his garden make it look beautiful for his first Midsummer in their neighbourhood.
"What is it? Something about the case?"
I love you.
Harry gaped at her.
“Ooh, do you? Wait. Why would you do that?”
cruel had I known about your upbringing.”

Blaise was busy rolling a joint as Pansy held up a small compact and carefully lined her lips in bright red.
“Yes. Clearly. Time well spent in Agyness-fucking-Deyn’s knickers. Did you knock her up too? Is that why you’re here?”
Most likely simulating a rather lewd act with his hand and mouth. Fucking tosser.
"That went as well as you'd hoped, I suppose?" Draco asked.
“Oh. Well, then I suppose—even though I don’t feel I’ve done much to deserve it—I’ll be very happy to accept your offer of dinner.” Draco thought he did quite well at keeping the eagerness out of his voice, right up until he added breathlessly, “It would be a pleasure.”

He looked around at the children's faces. James' hopeful expression tugged at Harry's heart; at eleven years old, James was at that funny age where he didn't always want to spend time with his younger siblings, nor with the grown-ups, and so Harry had grown to cherish the moments when he relaxed and let himself just be a kid. Albus was scowling at Harry—
“Fuck, look at you, Malfoy,” Potter rasped, and Draco was so turned on it wasn’t funny, the feel of Potter’s touch on his exposed sensitive skin going straight to his dick, and then, right on cue, the baby kicked. Hard. Potter pulled his hands away.
"Harry!" Draco repeated, looking shocked. "What's got into you?"
Draco could have kissed him!
"So, I imagine you know the basics. Happy memory, incantation, wand movement. Where do you think you have issues? And can you cast a Patronus some of the time and not others, or not at all?"
Potter grips Draco's hand tighter. His short fingernails dig into Draco's palm. The tiny hurts of it are distracting and a little arousing. "Auror Robards sir, I really don't think that will be necessary—" Potter pleads.
"Ah, of course. Well, we shall have to get working on a beak and tail for you too," she said kindly, running her fingers over the tangled knot of threads and fabric and placing them in her lap.
"I’ve told you not to question my brilliant plans,
"Draco Malfoy," she cried, "and Hestia the kettle."
Draco spluttered. He didn't want to hear about Potter's hair appointment or his love of Martin Miggs even though he adored the comics himself. “As wonderful as that is to hear, Pans, what about the lawn? What about the hydrangeas and rose bushes? Is he going to work on them?”
“Er. We all. As a group. All stay in touch…” Draco took a gulp of tea.
"Rude!" Potter laughed. "But accurate, I suppose. I was well suspicious of you a day or two ago, and it's embarrassing to admit but I, er, wanted to see what you were up to before approaching you again. In case... um..."
Twisting his body, he found he could barely move. Invisible bonds had been spelled across his thighs, chest and right arm, pinning him where he lay. A sickly, cloying smell filled his nostrils. Smoky and sweet.
“Oh, that doesn’t bode well. Not well at all.”
Draco took care to ensure the jus was rich and glossy, the Gurdyroots were perfectly caramelised, the chips were charmed to stay crunchy and hot, and of course the steak was seared to perfection, pink and juicy in the centre. He took equal care over Chang’s dish, patiently ladling the fragrant herby stock into the rice spoonful by spoonful and flambéing the scallops in firewhiskey and chopped chives.
——— [o] ———
After Draco claims sweet relief from Potter's skin, he detaches himself and takes a seat to await Robards.
Potter was laughing again, and Draco felt nothing but relief to see it. "I'll ensure you get an Order of Merlin for your brave sacrifice," Potter said, popping the rest of his peach wedge into his mouth.
"Tormented!" Harry exclaimed. "Tormented in my own home. Lowest in the pecking order after a Potions Professor, four children, and two striped Kneazles!"
“Where does she work?” Harry asked.
Harry rolled his eyes. How could he have forgotten about James's toad? He'd tried to persuade the boy to choose an owl to take to Hogwarts, but James had fallen in love with the squat creature with its dour mouth and speckled hide, and after that there was nothing to be done for it except pay the requisite sum of Galleons. And actually, James was only just back from his first term, so Harry supposed the poor warty thing had been out of sight and out of mind.
The clock ticks loudly. Draco notices the Potter and Malfoy hands edging into the 'In Trouble' segment right as the door swings open and Robards marches in.
“No, neither of us knew. Harry wanted it to be a surprise.”
“He wants to talk to you before he orders. Something about the guest he's with having some dietary requirements?”
object with documented provenance and steeped in Black family legacy, and... and at least she's not an ugly monstrosity named after a tacky Disney character—"
“You’ve been to the Silken Glove? I’ve never seen you there.”
Malfoy then, not a ghost. But haunting nonetheless. The slash of a scar across his neck and chin. Harry feels sick.
He's just as annoyed as Potter is about the need to touch. Of course he is. It's inconvenient, it's embarrassing, it's a pain. But he's also sort of dreading the curse being gone. Will Potter ever touch him again?
And it's not long before sleep begins to pull him under, leaving him with a lingering feeling of how much he's in love with Harry Potter.
He walked out of the kitchen without waiting for a reply and served table six their meals. Draco couldn’t deny the pride he felt at the impressed looks on Potter and Chang’s faces. He was certain that they would be able to find no fault with their food. Well, as certain as he could be.
It all falls into place then, for Draco, and he says calmly, "And when they wouldn't stop you disposed of Trista with Joanna's wand and framed Joanna for her lover's murder."
"It's the truth, Potter! I know you've noticed. That's the only thing that makes it feel better."
“Cho Chang? Your date the other night? Tell me you haven’t forgotten about her this quickly.”

A slight but appreciable paranoia tickles the bottom of Harry’s spine as he whooshes through Floospace.

might have been a more fitting term—looked like it had never been mowed, and the beautiful flowers that used to be visible right throughout the spring and summer before Potter moved in were all dead or covered with weeds.
“Oh, do piss off, Potter,” and Draco couldn’t help laughing too.
He was looking at Malfoy, really looking, at every swish of his hands, every bat of his eyelashes, every movement of his mouth to the lyrics. Harry smiled wider than he ever remembered. He closed his eyes, and he danced, and he didn't let go of Malfoy's hand.
"Harry," Draco agrees, eyes darting away.
Potter shifted in his chair and flexed his fingers, looking down at them. They looked strong and sturdy and… Draco had to look away. “I may not have thought that decision through fully. Though I reckon these hands will be full enough once the baby comes. I can’t imagine I’ll have all that much time to meet blokes, at least not until Junior heads off to Hogwarts.”
Draco couldn't help the sting at the implication. He'd very much thought the kiss
Draco had always liked things to be just so. Ever since he was a child he'd placed great importance on how things looked, always striving to maintain the most positive and appealing image for the outside world. And that was reflected in his house and garden.
He heard Malfoy say something to Kirana, but he couldn't make it out; and the bits he could make out he couldn't understand. There was a strong possibility he'd addressed her in either Balinese or Indonesian.
"Trickery! Trickery and subterfuge!" Hestia shrieked, before quickly regaining some composure. She fixed Mrs Potts with a stern glare. "You

hadn’t told his colleagues, or anyone for that matter, about Potter having a baby, and a whole week had already gone by. How odd.

spoken about everything that's gone between them (save for that ghastly time Draco tried to apologise, and Potter did little more than nod mutely and look away), but their unspoken forgiveness on past events has been tacitly acknowledged in the unspoken and deep trust they have now. The way they're now protective of each other, taking actions to help rather than hinder.

Draco chuckled. "Yes, Harry. Yes, it very much does. Now, if you'll disrobe."
But of course Potter had taken one look at Draco, grabbed his towel, and ran.
"Correct. That'll be the Absolut vodka, splash of pinot grigio, Vok peach liqueur, peach puree, topped off with sparkling pinot noir—which gives it that pretty pink colour—garnished with a peach wedge. And the secret tangy ingredient? A dash of DeKuyper Sour Apple Pucker." Potter gaped at him. "Oh, and I almost forgot... the very lickable vanilla sugar rim."
Hermione was nodding now in agreement.
. He quickly pulled on his shorts.
“Ah. This is true,” Draco chuckled. Then he had a thought. “Hold on, Potter. Won’t Chang have something to say if we have dinner together?”
It's been like this for almost a week now. And though he's getting used to this back and forth dance of skin against skin, small shocks exchanged for merciful respite, it's still been awkward and confusing, and he's not sure how long he can keep it up. A tension has been creeping beneath Draco's skin, and it's not the curse.
Draco stared blankly at Potter for a moment. There was something in the simplicity of that statement that caught him off guard. Why
"Yes, you could turf
She grabbed her toy wand and ran around, waving it and hooting with glee.
“I’ll find out who the father is, if I can. I might just keep the information to myself for a bit though. Do you think that’s selfish?”
"Honestly," Draco sighed. "I'm not sure I even know myself. I noticed a small beach spa here on Sanur that was hiring and offering training on the job. At first it was simply a nice change from mixing cocktails and opening beer bottles, which I'd begun to get weary of, and I got to choose my own hours, too. Plus it's the other side of the island from the Seminyak strip, so I was less tempted to party every night, and believe me, there's plenty to tempt a man there." Draco winked and was very satisfied with Potter's answering chuckle. "I suppose I stuck with the massage therapy gig because it's something that makes me feel properly useful—I genuinely believe it goes some way to improving the health of my customers, rather than destroying it in the way that alcohol can." Draco lifted his glass and raised an eyebrow. "And it has its perks. I get to hang around on lovely beaches, keep up to date with the hottest gossip from the other beach vendors, and some days, if I'm lucky, I get to feel up some very attractive— Oh fuck, I need to shut up."
"You can?" James sniffled. "How?"
What made things worse was that Smith seemed to know this. “I heard your street is no longer worthy competition this year, Malfoy,” Smith said smugly, as the cheese assistant passed him a wrapped boule of Edam. “What a pity.”
"Tell us where it is," one of them hissed. "Do not try to deceive us. We know it was you."
“Right!” said Potter. “Bit suss. The bastard’s probably not pregnant at all. Bet he’s just got bad gas.”
And he was nervous too about this antenatal class he was on his way to. His Healer had emphasised the importance of first-time parents attending, and whilst he was excited to share his happiness with other expecting fathers, he worried what they might think of a former Death Eater raising a child by himself. Things had improved a great deal over the years, but he could still feel the weight of people’s judgement when they saw his Malfoy hair and his Black bone structure. He didn't even need to roll up his sleeve.
can think again: I didn't come here to stare at the back of some muppet's head." She turned to face Harry and Pansy, pouting. "Besides, why shouldn't I get to be up higher; I'm shorter than Pansy!"
Draco relaxed and tried to put thoughts of Potter’s lush lips out of his mind. After a minute, Potter came through with a tray. He passed Draco a mug of tea, decaf apparently, offered him a biscuit straight from the packet (chocolate Digestives) and began chuckling.
A grin spread across Draco's face. "That can't be his real name."
"Bloody hell," Harry grizzled, eyes still closed but frowning deeply. "I'd only just nodded off!"
Harry nodded and said, “Yes.”

And so it went on. Robe alterations and enhancements for the Yule Ball (he had to raise the hemline of Pansy's dress at least four times before she was happy that it was sufficiently risqué enough to draw Theodore's attentions), costumes for the Halloween night at Hogsmeade in fifth year (thankfully they managed to squeak that event in before Professor Umbridge put a ban on all fun and festivities), and well of course, there'd been seventh year.
——— [o] ———
But Draco's face still itched, his lips still tingled hot, and within his mouth his tongue ached. It was like being on fire, and thinking back on it, it was all they could have done. It was the only way. Potter's face had simply angled upwards, and Draco's chin had come down slightly, and they had kissed, open-mouthed, desperate for touch. Wrapped in each other's arms, skin to skin, hot flesh to hot flesh.
it made sense why Draco kept neglecting to tell people about Potter. "That Granger’s always been a wily one. Fierce too," he said, rubbing his cheek.
Draco cringed. His words wouldn’t even bother a child, let alone someone like Potter.
“And that better just be spilled beer I feel running down my neck,” Draco added haughtily, though his mouth quirked into a smile.
Written for the @drarrymicrofic prompt "Haunt me in the night" by HOLYCHILD.
Draco wasn’t sure how to respond to that and opted for “You’re right, that is hilarious.” Interestingly, Potter had gone a bit red and was now cramming a chocolate biscuit in his mouth. Draco sipped his tea. Then said, “Eoin and Allison are good sorts, aren't they? And I find it so refreshing that it’s him having the baby, I've never come across that in a heterosexual couple.”
"Six actually. I hardly saw him in seventh year. Not many tormenting opportunities. "
