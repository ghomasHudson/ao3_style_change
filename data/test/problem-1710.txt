“Yes they’ve bloody told me why! God, you’re all impossible! Letting this monster do what he likes!”
Harry gave a small smile as pouring over the Marauders Map every night finally proved fruitful. Malfoy had been suspiciously well behaved in the evenings that week, returning to the Slytherin common room after dinner and not leaving until breakfast the next morning. Now Harry watched as Malfoy snuck out of his room at 11pm. He thought he’d be headed for the room of requirement and frowned as instead he saw Malfoy’s footsteps trace a path to the bathroom. He couldn’t think of what he could possibly be doing in there in the middle of the night. Maybe he wasn’t the only who chose the unused girl's bathroom as the prime potion brewing place. That would be perfect, if he caught him in the act of brewing the potion. He wouldn’t even have to force the secret out of him. He’d just stun Malfoy, take the potion and the book to Hermione and get her to find the antidote. Sorted.
“I’m not asking you out, Potter. I was proposing a long hard fuck out here in this lovely summer evening.”
He kissed him back, hard, and Harry realised quite how out of his depth he was. He’d never felt this before, the lurching of his stomach, the butterflies, the goosepimples on his arms, the hair standing up on the back of his neck. The world was falling away below him and there was nothing he could do about it.
“Clear,” he whispered and they crept around the chair. “You lead. You know the mansion. Get us out of here as quick as you can.”
Draco kept his eyes down, not wanting to know which faces were watching the display, which ones would never look at him the same again.
“Well,” Lucius said. “You’ve surpassed all my expectations by actually getting out of the dungeon. Did Evans have a stroke? Did you find him collapsed and step over his body?”
As Draco got close to finishing his meal Harry got nervous. He hadn’t forgotten the mortification of that afternoon. Of what Draco now knew. He didn’t know whether Draco was going to pretend it never happened. But if he was going to do that, what on earth was he doing there? Did he want to be friends?
Draco undid his trousers and let them drop to the floor with his pants. Harry pulled Draco back towards him, groaning at the feel of their naked thighs and cocks together. He wanted more of Draco’s skin.
The malicious look in Draco’s eyes as he watched him was making Harry so hard it hurt, his own fingers weren’t helping the matter. They were nothing compared to Draco’s but it had been so long it wasn’t taking much. Draco watched Harry get breathless and flushed with clear satisfaction. He started stroking his own cock in time with Harry’s; matching the death glare Harry was giving him with one of sheer enjoyment.
Ron caught him as he fell towards the floor. Grief consumed him. His parents. His godfather. His mentor. His lover. All they had lost. All they still had left to lose.
“Who is the lucky woman? Man? House elf? You might want to consider that you just have a teenage crush, Potter. I know you’ve been brought up to think that the world revolves around you, but I can’t think of anyone spending that much time directing your affections.”
The prosecutor had finally finished reading out Draco’s alleged crimes when Harry came back to reality.
Draco bit down on Harry’s hip and released the spell. Harry wailed loud enough for the whole school to hear.
Harry drew a slow breath in then continued, the sight of his cock disappearing into Draco’s arse destroying his last sane thought.
“I was more hoping you’d take him to see a teacher, Harry, so you could resolve this without violence?”
Draco whimpered and Potter gripped his throat harder. Draco’s cock throbbed in response and he nodded.
“Stop whining” he muttered under his breath and the congealed blood fell away. He flicked his wand and the skin started to knit itself back together.
Harry was quite surprised when Draco did get out of bed and stood stark naked in front of him with his hands on his hips.
He skimmed it. Harry watched the double take as Draco registered the name on the form. He looked up and stared at Harry. There was no horror there though, his face in a perfect blank mask.
He closed his eyes to avoid his glaring eyes in the mirror and washed all traces of Draco off his skin.
“You know what people do just before war time, Potter? Especially when it’s very likely that one of them is going to end up dead?”
He moved his hands down and opened his legs, pushing a finger inside himself. Draco came and sat opposite him on the bed, watching the pained look of mortification on Harry’s face that he was really doing this, and worse, that someone was watching.
Harry rolled his eyes but did as he was told, working himself back and forth on Draco’s cock, bringing himself agonisingly close to the edge and groaning in frustration. Draco was grinning at him, a mad look in his eyes that just drove Harry higher.
Harry knew Draco was baiting him, but that didn’t mean it wasn’t going to work. Their childhood rivalry stepped in, marching past Harry’s shyness and kissing Draco square on the mouth. Draco grinned.
Draco’s mouth twitched into an almost smile but stopped just shy of it. He walked around the table and waved the dirty plates over to the sink. He stopped in front of Harry’s chair and put his hands on his hips.
Draco just looked bored at Harry’s outburst. He guided Harry back into the water to wet his hair, then took some soap of the side and started massaging it into Harry’s unruly mop. Harry groaned.
Harry thought he might be dead. Fucked to death by the son of a death eater turned masseuse. What a legacy.
Harry realised now what Draco had to do. He would have sank to the floor if it not for the spell. His heart broke for Draco. For his headmaster, who, he now realised, really had known this was happening all along. And let it continue, to protect Draco.
Draco clearly thought the same as he waved his wand. Harry groaned in pain as he felt his bones and muscles spring back into action.
The scream had chilled him to the bone. A woman’s. So like his mother’s. He shuddered and tried to refocus. They reached the landing. There were four doors to chose from. One was ajar and Harry could see a dim glow coming from the room.
Draco looked at him to see if he had any intention of moving. Harry did not. Draco nodded approvingly and relaxed back against the side of the bath.
Draco raked a hand through Harry’s hair and tossed Harry’s glasses onto the table. He looked at Harry thoughtfully. Harry kept still, scared if he said the wrong or moved in the wrong way that Draco would run.
“I’m not sure that there is.” Harry had tried multiple times to understand the game that he watched from his seat on the Dursleys’ living room floor, a book balanced in between his knees, trying not to move an inch or make a sound.
Harry stared at the sight of his cock disappearing inside Draco’s arse. He fucked him slowly, trying to keep the invisible wall at bay. His nerves shattered every time he hit it.
“Sorry, humour me. Are we still holding to article 256 of the justice laws that any time in Azkaban less than 10 years can be served as Ministry service time instead with the supervision of a willing allocated mentor?”
He imagined half Slytherin house waiting for him in the room of requirement, cameras out, ready to tear him to pieces.
Potter dropped Draco back down on his feet, sliding his hand down Draco’s pants and grabbing his cock.
Harry started to move, quickly realising that Draco putting that thing up his own arse made the vibrations travel through to his cock and although they were dull, Harry could still feel them driving him higher. He moved as he was told to, angling Draco’s cock just where he wanted it and moved faster still, feeling his body’s own need take over.
He heard Potter lean down and rummage in the box of toys, lube and condoms that sat in the corner of every cage.
He moaned as Malfoy started to suck him off, bouncing his cock off the back of his throat, gulping, sucking, and generally putting Harry’s efforts to shame. And then the toy began to move inside him again. Harry grasped Malfoy’s shoulder. You shouldn’t be able to grin with a cock in your mouth, but Harry was sure Malfoy was managing it somehow. It fucked him slowly, still fairly small, but it felt divine, and it hit just the right place.
Malfoy stood up, not looking the least bit concerned at the wand pointed at his chest and started to walk over to him, a look in his eye that told Harry he should probably be running. Harry knew he should cast it now, something, anything...
Harry groaned as he felt himself come round slightly and realised he could hear the shower running. He thought he’d better go in there really, he was supposed to be watching him after all. Not that he really had a great chance of stopping him if he tried anything, but still. He winced as he felt the afterglow still making his body tingle, it shouldn’t be like this, he shouldn’t like this...
Draco rolled his eyes and pushed himself up of Harry, grabbing his wand and cleaning himself up. Harry regretted every saying anything. His obsession with what Draco was up to was apparently still burning, underneath the lust. Draco was pulling on his clothes. Harry couldn’t find the energy to move.
He shuffled down in his sleeping bag trying not to kick Malfoy in the process and not get stuck in his sleeping bag and make an idiot out of himself. Not that he cared what Malfoy thought.
“Shh, I swear blow my cover Potter and I’m screwed. This is the best job I’ve had in ages don’t screw it up for me. Just take your damn clothes off and get on the bed in case anyone comes in.”
“If what? If you had your fingers in my arse?” Draco chuckled. Draco moved his other hand to Harry’s cock “Maybe next time.”
Harry could feel his heart racing at the prospect, he knew it was stupid, and he knew that he shouldn’t, and he was really going to try not to...but...he knew that part of himself was already resigned to letting Malfoy fuck him again. He knew from past experience that Malfoy was all too good at turning his no’s into yes’s, and that before he knew it he’d end up naked on his back with Malfoy buried deep inside him, moaning filthy things in his ear and he’d be screaming the place down. He hated his body, how it yearned for Malfoy; how it shivered at his slightest touch and even more, how it refused to react to anyone else’s. He hated Malfoy for doing this to him, he was sure he’d never had the slightest thought in that vein until Malfoy had taken him - against his will as Harry would always insist - and made him his.
Draco snatched his father’s wand from his fingers and snapped it. He picked his newly adopted wand from the floor and pointed it at his father. His hands shook, his mouth open, like he was trying to force his lips to speak the spell. Nothing came out.
He threw the orb of light into the lamp on the ceiling and stared around, dumbfounded. The room was full of the cages they’d seen being transported, with the miserable looking animals still inside. They looked just as startled to see him. He flicked his eyes round the room again in case he’d missed something. He hadn’t. There was no woman.
“Hello,” Potter said quietly, probably very aware of all the eyes on them, on all the clientele that we finding excuses to come closer and closer to their cage.
The house was lit by a single lamp hanging to the right of the front door. The house was otherwise in darkness from what Harry could tell. He winced as their shoes crunched on the gravel as they crept towards the door.
“I got back early, luckily for you.” Draco kissed him softly on the lips. “You still not talking to me?”
“I can’t handle how naïve you are sometimes Potter. It’s adorable.” He rocked Harry’s hips back and forth. “Speaking of, get these off.”
Draco reached up, and to Harry’s horror ran his hand through the wet mess on his face and smeared it through his hair. He laughed at the look on Harry’s face.
They went their separate ways at the staircases. Harry crept into bed and closed his eyes, falling into a blissfully dreamless sleep.
“Come on, Potter, don’t keep me waiting...I have better sluts I could go to, you know and they’re much better behaved...”
He soaked himself a while longer. Fantasising about what would happen if Draco were to come and knock, let himself in at that very moment. Come in and find him naked in the bath. Draco would call out to him, then find him in the bathroom. He’d smile, an unguarded, genuine smile, and his clothes would fall to the floor.
Ron made a disbelieving noise but Hermione kicked him under the table. Malfoy’s forced attempts to be nice just made Harry believe him even less.
Harry pulled back Draco’s sleeping bag, pulled off his top, and groaned at the pale skin he exposed. Draco kicked off his trousers and Harry pushed his hand into his boxers, wrapping his large hand round Draco’s cock.
“Honestly, Potter, you don’t like me cruel, you don’t like me being nice...how do you want me?” Draco had his hands on his hips and one of Harry’s fluffy white towels wrapped round his waist. His hair was still mostly wet but still managed to look better than Harry’s did even when it was dry. His skin was glowing from the sex, it always did, making him look even more attractive.
“The son of Death Eater, and worst enemy in the school is telling me he wants a shag. How, in hell, do you expect me to relax and not think this is some elaborate joke?”
“Yes, there’s two of you, wandless. We don’t know who or what they have in there. You will not approach. I’ll send a team in in the morning.”
Harry cleared his throat and stood up. It created the excited scandalised whispers Harry had expected.
The lack of a clock on the wall was disorientating. There was light from outside, but Harry still would have killed for a watch. Something to cling onto, to measure, count. The days weren’t enough. The amount of times he’d come in his own bloody hand were enough. He needed Draco. Desperately. He craved no one else, nothing else in this state than Draco. He was all he’d ever known in terms of a lover. All he ever wanted to know. And the guilt was tearing him to pieces. The order. He’d let so many people down. And now everyone would know. What a monster he was for... Loving, yes loving, that bloody death eater.
Harry apparates. The wind and sideways rain hits him in the face and nearly sends him flying. Major grabs his arm. He thinks he’s sober again now.
“Do you have any other coffee?” Harry asked the teenager sitting behind the glass staring at his phone.
Harry nearly wept against the door as Draco let go of his cock and knelt down in between his legs, spreading his cheeks with his thumbs.
The only way to tell what Malfoy was up to, was to go to Mr Weasley and ask him if everything he’d said was true. They’d go there this afternoon, and then he could decide how to feel about the whole thing. If Death Eaters didn’t burst through the door any minute, called by a letter from Malfoy. God what was he even thinking, letting this happen?
Harry kissed him again, hard and long and moaned into his mouth before resting his head in the crook of Draco’s neck, revelling in the smell of sweat and sex and the heat of Draco’s body against his own.
Draco jumped up, nodded, and led the way out without a look back at his father. He took Harry straight to the front door, where luckily only the order were waiting.
Harry tuned out as Hermione tried to explain the rules of Rugby to Ron. Harry’s attention was fixed on the streak of platinum bobbing along in the crowd ahead of them.
“They’re threatening to break the borders because we’re tightening security. They say no one is taking them seriously and unless you speak to them personally, they’re going to break the 50-year treaty and smash the border to pieces.”
“Oh my god,” he desperately clawed around with his hands for something to hold onto but only found Draco’s shoulders. He leant back on the wall and let himself drop into the blissful head of Draco’s mouth.
It stung, it burnt, but fuck, it was delicious. He pushed his arse back against Draco’s hand and gasped again.
“Are you a Veela?” Harry blurted, as it occurred to him. He used to think about it before, at school, when they learnt about them. Their pale seductive skin, their ability to make men fall at their feet. Maybe he had fancied Draco at school.
Harry groaned. It had been so long since anyone had touched him. Draco smiled and tilted his head, running Harry’s cock across his cheek and flicking his tongue out over the head. Harry was staring at his stunning ex-arch nemesis playing with his cock, a smug smile on his face. The cat that got the cream. Draco traced his fingertips over Harry’s balls and Harry jerked his hips. Draco raised his eyebrows and smiled.
Harry caught himself staring at the tiny imperfection on his assistant’s head, transfixed. He’d quickly looked away when Draco had sat up, finally bringing the conversation to a close.
Harry gave up trying to understand and leant back against Draco, letting him snake his arms round his waist and holding him tight. His heart beating far faster now that it was mid orgasm.
“A good dancer is a very appealing quality in the opposite sex you know, you boys should pay attention.”
Harry managed a few more seconds before he wretched. Draco took his spit dripping fingers and stroked them over his cock. Harry moved his mouth back to Draco’s cock but Draco grabbed the back of his head.
“Yep.” Harry disentangled himself from Draco and pulled his clothes back on fast, trying to catch his breath, looking at his watch again. “That was possibly irresponsible of me.”
He pulled back his lips and smiled approvingly at Harry. He imagined he looked a dishevelled red mess.
“No! Of course not. Can you imagine? I’m just saying maybe you shouldn’t feel so awful about it. Crushes pass.”
Potter ran his hand inbetween Draco’s legs, playing idly with the silver butt plug that the last dom had left in him.
Harry did as instructed and Draco cried out loud. Harry realised he wanted that sound almost as much as he wanted the tight heat around his cock. He did it again and again then flipped Draco onto his back.
Harry resisted the urge to tell him that he didn’t give a flying fuck about the giants, and that the most beautiful man he thought he’d ever seen was currently slipping through his fingers.
Malfoy quickly pulled off the Death Eater’s hood from his head, realising what was causing the confusion before Harry did.
“Oh fuck. Oh hell.” Draco swore, riding high, so close, if it wasn’t for the spell he knew it’d be now. He groaned in frustration.
Harry didn’t reply. Draco finished folding his clothes, zipped up his suitcase and walked back over to him.
Draco turned off the shower. He transformed what rags he’d been using as blankets into a towel and dried them both off.
“But how, Harry? He can’t have laced anything at meals without giving him it to the whole table, and I don’t see anyone else in Gryffindor house swooning over him.”
Draco just grinned at him. He’d mentally coined the phrase wizard Viagra when Draco had used it on him before. It wasn’t like the one Draco used so often; the one that tightened around his cock and stopped him from being able to come. He could get himself off as many times as he liked, it just never satisfied him, minutes later his cock would be throbbing with need again. It was cruel. He’d only left him unattended with the spell for a few hours before...but a few days?
He didn’t move from his seat though, didn’t say a thing, just sat continuing to feed Malfoy his breakfast.
“Morning, Harry,” Hermione chimed. She was generally a lot more spritely than Ron who just trudged into the room and collapsed onto the chair opposite Malfoy.
“They’ve got subtle differences. I’m sure if you went to Slughorn he’d work out which one it was straight away.”
Harry was expecting him to summon him to the room of requirement but suddenly he heard Draco’s voice behind him.
Draco took out the beans and a handful spilt out onto the work surface where Harry had ripped the bag opening it the first time. Draco turned round to give Harry another condescending look.
He handed them out, getting curt, silent nods in return. He turned back through the window into the bedroom. He put his coffee down on the table next to the lightly glowing prophecy globe. He ran his fingers across the glass. Draco imagined someone had put it there to justify this whole thing. Harry was a friend to all of them, and he was sure Granger wasn’t the only one feeling outraged at the mere proposal of what they were putting him through. God knows where Weasley had got himself to.
“I’ll take you to Maldives and spend the entire time shagging you on a sun lounger under a palm tree and feeding you cocktails.”
Draco. Fucking. Malfoy. He groaned. Had the last of his drink and leant on the wall, looking down out over the forest and the stars twinkling in the sky.
He walked over to the coffee machine and flicked his wand at it. Three mugs jumped down off the shelves.
“You don’t want a partner that likes you. You’re sick of people fawning over you and pandering to your every desire.”
“Fuck, Malfoy, I…” Harry’s heart beat was pounding in his ears. Every fibre of his being shouting yes and no at the same time.
“It does.” Harry felt a twist of nostalgia for the Weasley’s warm family glow. The cheer and love in that tent. He missed it. He made a mental note to go and see them soon when he got back.
“I like to eat nice food, and since I’m no longer in a position to cook for myself, well. What about you, do you like to cook?”
He woke up feeling particularly warm and comfortable in his bed, until he realised quite why he was so comfortable. Draco had wrapped himself around him whilst he was asleep and was now quite happily fast asleep on his shoulder, his arms locked tight around his waist and his legs intertwined with his. Harry inwardly groaned, this was really the last thing he needed.
“I feel so angry. I... I feel angry that I’ll only get to kill Lucius once. It’s awful. I know it is. But its all I can think of.”
“Minister? A word?” It was one of his deputies. Major. He clearly had not been drinking, and had a serious look, one that Draco immediately clocked.
Harry pushed on the door Draco indicated and found himself in a very large bedroom. He decided that ‘suite’ was probably a better word. Draco walked in behind him and grinned.
Harry didn’t know where to start with the barrage of questions so instead lay silent as Draco poured the warm oil on his back and started rubbing it into his muscles. He stifled a groan. Draco was good at this.
Harry let out a content sigh. The weight of Draco on his chest was blissful. Harry didn’t ever want him to move.
Draco didn’t answer, he was too busy ripping off his clothes, now that he’d transformed the tap into a shower. Harry jumped out of the way of the manically cleaning broom.
“Mmm it looks good too.” He moved them fast, till Harry’s cock was leaking onto the sheets, his hips bucking wildly against Draco’s fingers.
Harry pumped Draco’s cock and groaned as Draco came hard in his hand, swearing and squeezing round his cock, sending aftershocks shudder through Harry’s body.
“Well...yeah.” Ron shrugged. “I didn’t want to write to mum and dad and make them think we were stupid or something and couldn’t handle it. So I thought I’d wait for you two to get back.”
“Demanding brat,” Harry slapped his arse and Draco shuddered. “I think we’ll take this nice and slow.”
Harry woke up to the usual 7am cacophony of alarms going off. He looked at Draco lying on his chest and froze in horror. Draco frowned at the noise and pulled the blanket up over his head, still half asleep.
Draco gave him a knowing smile. They pulled up outside the flat. He supposed he’d at least managed to have a slight conversation with Draco. Draco stumble slightly as he got out the car. At least he wasn’t the only tipsy one.
Harry came in rough jerks, gasping his breath and crying out, every thrust from that thing drew it out, sent him higher, till eventually he collapsed onto Draco, a limp mess of limbs in Draco’s arms.
Draco was babbling and Harry loved it. He bounced him on his cock a bit more, delighting at his squeals every time he dropped him, then whirled him round and bent him over the couch. He grabbed a bottle of olive oil of the side and poured it generously over Draco’s arse.
He looked up. Draco was the most relaxed Harry had ever seen him. All his airs and graces were gone, his arms hung loose at his side and his head tipped back. Harry pushed his lips down further experimentally till Draco’s cock brushed the back of his mouth. Harry’s cock became painfully hard. Draco let him go at his own pace for a few minutes before grabbed his hair and pulled his head up.
No, he’d feel much better when he was back inside the Order Headquarters (or Sirius’ place as he liked to think of it) with all the protection and disguising spells in place. That and the promise of a soft warm bed was making Harry walk to the door so fast that Hermione was struggling to keep up with him.
“Fuck. “ Draco grinned at Harry, his eyes sparkling. “How longs it been since you got laid, boy wonder?”
Harry was getting increasingly anxious about Draco. He was losing weight, not that he had any to lose, and was letting his high standards of appearance slip. Not that Harry gave a fuck about Draco’s hair not being quite as glossy as before, but it was worrying. He was quiet, too. Nowhere near as feisty, practically silent in class and eyes down in the hall way.
The room was buzzing with activity as Mrs Weasley prepared them a feast. Spoons stirred and knives chopped away. She stood in the centre of the room with her apron on, her hands on her hips and a determined look in her eyes. Doing what she did best.
He felt Malfoy’s hands on his waist as he turned him around and tried to keep control of himself as Malfoy pushed him back hard against the door. He heard the metal handcuffs fall to the floor with a clatter.
He said it as if Harry had any power of movement. He picked him up and carried him downstairs again where Lucius had left his broom waiting for him on the table. He carried him outside into the cold night air and put him in front of him on his broomstick.
Draco groaned in protest but Harry moved over him to kneel either side of his shoulder. Draco leant up, eager now, opening his mouth in the most obscene picture. He gasped as the heat of Draco’s mouth engulfed him. Draco grabbed Harry’s hips and pulled him closer, gagging on his cock but still pushed forward.
Draco cleaned himself up with a flick of his wand and let himself fall down on top of Harry on the floor.
“Fucking hell,” Harry said eventually, steadying himself on the couch and experimentally standing up. Draco turned in his arms to face him, a wicked grin on his face. Harry allowed himself a small smile back at him even though his cheeks were burning bright red.
He tried looking down, at Draco’s abs tensing under his shirt, as he sucked, trying to avoid the reality of who’s cock he was sucking. But he wanted to look. He wanted to see the expression on Draco’s face. He needed to please him. Needed to know what he liked best. To burn the image of him with his lips parted, flushed and panting into his brain forever.
“Potter...” Draco sighed in bored tone, “If you don’t start fucking yourself with that I’m going to come over there and fuck you dry...”
Harry’s breath hitched and he pushed back hard, his hand tight on Draco’s hip. He fucked Draco slowly in the steam, living in that second only for Draco’s cries and that blissful heat around his cock.
“I lost the war and I gave up my friends to Voldemort cos I’m a slave to my death eater lover and my aching cock.”
Harry demolished the rest of the stew and dumplings in minutes. Hangovers always made him ravenous, and he hadn’t dared to try and have any breakfast when he first woke up in case he brought it all back up again.
Harry didn’t think he was sleeping. He often woke up in the night to find Draco wide awake, eyes open and staring at the ceiling. He’d sleepily try to comfort him, but Draco would just kiss Harry on the head and tell him to go back to sleep. He didn’t try to reason him with him anymore, there was no easy answers here. Harry was learning the hard way that the lines between good and evil weren’t always are clear cut as he’d always assumed.
“But before you arrest me it’s all above board. I legally changed my name, and there’s no law against disguise spells. Not unless you’re impersonating someone.”
“Wouldn’t want everyone hearing for themselves what a desperate little slut you are for me would we?”
Malfoy flicked his wand and Harry felt a tightening in the base of his cock. He cursed Malfoy to hell and back around his rope.
“Easy there, Auror Potter,” Malfoy drawled, apparently unconcerned at having Harry’s wand thrust in his direction.
“I’m not a fucking virgin.” These things just kept coming out his mouth. His kiss with Cho was as far as he’d got with anyone.
The group erupted into giggles as she leant forward to spin it again. Harry was only half paying attention to who was about to have to snog the Slytherin brat and was watching Ron doing a victory dance on the other side of the room.
Harry breath caught in his throat and his cheeks flushed but he did as he was told. He squealed as he felt not Draco’s cock but three of his fingers pushing hard inside him.
Harry pulled his eyes away from Malfoy. He thought it would be easier to go along with the pretence.
He felt the tip of Draco’s hot cock on his arse, slick with lube. Harry’s breath caught in his throat.
Harry tried to resist the urge to strangle him and turned back to the door. It opened and he tried to act surprised to see the pair of them walk into the room, still in their pyjamas.
Dumbledore wasn’t surprised to see him. Harry had a feeling Dumbledore had a map of his own. The door opened before he had chance to speak the password.
“How about you tell me how desperate you are for me to suck you off and take that horrible spell away.”
“Why shouldn’t I? You’re a coward...a spy for the Order? More like hiding behind daddy’s sofa till the war is over...you disgust me...”
Harry blinked in bemusement but did as he was told as Draco mixed various bottles at the table in the corner.
Draco dragged his teeth down Harry neck and reached to stroke Harry’s cock. Harry whimpered at the teasing light touch. The toy began to move with Draco’s strokes, slow and growing deeper as the toy grew inside him.
“Oh baby. You poor desperate thing. Just get on your front, Potter, and let me give you what you want.”
“So do you. I can wait till I stretch you enough to get my cock in that tight arse of yours. You’re not going to be able to sit down for days.”
He put on his clothes and shuffled down to breakfast with Ron and Hermione. Hermione didn’t say anything, just looked him over quickly to check he was okay.
Harry did as he was told and Draco squealed, so Harry did it to his heart’s content, filling the apartment with Draco’s squeals and cries as he shook above him. He lost count of the amount of times he would have come by now, if it wasn’t for that wretched/amazing spell of Draco’s.
Harry hit the button for the top floor. He waited for Draco to press the button for the fifth floor. He pressed the door close button instead. Harry raised his eyebrows.
Draco gasped as Potter twisted the plug, moving his hand slowly on Draco’s prick. God. Draco could come like this. Potter’s hands on him, barely doing anything. He could come through bars of the cage, streams of it. He was sure. At least he had the spell to save his embarrassment, as infuriating as it was.
Harry nodded, now he’d got up the idea of Draco being in his bed was unthinkably stupid. Draco finished the pastry, pulled his clothes back on and walked to the door.
“Draco please. Please. I need.” His please were muffled by Malfoy’s hand. Malfoy pumped his cock harder.
They both winced. Harry was mortified. Now that his heart rate had settled and the had adrenaline seeped away, he saw this for what it really was. An embarrassment.
Harry glared up at him and missed a step, tripped and fell on Malfoy. Malfoy laughed, cruel as always.
He froze as he saw none other than Draco Malfoy walk through from the treatment rooms wearing a therapist’s uniform. He should bolt. He couldn’t. He was pinned to the chair in horror. Draco didn’t notice him at first and walked to the desk take Harry’s form from the receptionist.
Malfoy watched the raven haired boy with satisfaction; he knew it had been a good purchase. He saw a lot of Harry usually when they fucked, but not all of him, and now he could stand back and watch him writhe and it was the most beautiful sight...maybe second to Harry screaming, for whatever reasons. Screams of pain and pleasure pleased Draco just the same, something Harry knew all too well.
Harry look in horror at Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange standing in his kitchen. Ron and Hermione were both bound and gagged, forced to their knees on the floor. They were both looking at him in equal horror.
Draco threw Harry the cloth over. Harry caught it without comment and ran it across the dusty table and chairs. Draco floated the plates over and hunted through the cupboard for some knives, forks and glasses.
“Jesus fuck Potter.” Draco joined him on the floor, panting. He leant back against the wall of the closet and pushed his hair, wet with sweat, out his face.
“I’m sure when we’ve won the war that the ministry will be able to afford the best shrink going for him.”
Harry was actually thinking that Draco’s hands are the things that must be enchanted. He bit back another sigh as Draco started working on his thighs.
“No,” Harry blurted and groaned at himself. “I mean I…” Harry stumbled. He could not think with Draco’s hand on his dick.
Luckily, he saw no one, and just remembered the way to the prefect’s bathroom. The password hadn’t changed. He locked the door behind him. The water was already running, and the perfumed soap drifted through the air. He wished he’d have used the few minutes they were apart to pull himself together, but his brain was still mush. He took off his clothes and hung them on the hook next to Draco’s, already a little breathless at the thought of seeing Draco naked. And wet.
Harry started to scream as Draco released him. He felt his orgasm washing over him, one last hard stroke and a slap to the arse from Draco and Harry was done, crying out and shaking before he let himself fall down on the bed.
“Ron’s right, Harry,” Hermione said. “Even if Voldemort has, for some inexplicable reason, entrusted his plans to a 17-year-old boy, I don’t think Malfoy’s going to give away some vital clue about them over dinner that you’ll be able to hear from two tables away.”
This at least made Harry’s hands move, he’d done it once before when Harry had done something particularly bad, though he couldn’t remember what. It had been single most painful and pleasurable experience in his life and he had no desire to repeat it.
“Um...” Harry said, looking at the loaf of bread in his hand, unsure of when he picked it up. “I guess yeah. Do we have anything?”
Draco had a terrifying poker face. Harry had spent the entire night with his face buried in his pillow in humiliation at what he’d let Draco do to him. Facing the facts that there was no love potion. No reason for the heat the coursed through his veins whenever he saw Malfoy. Whenever he bloody breathed. Yet when Harry walked into the great hall Malfoy let his cool gaze slide over him and onto the next person without even a twitch of his lips.
“Mmm,” Draco grinned and slowly let his weight drop down, groaning as Harry’s thick cock stretched him.
“Right, you don’t like nice. You like gone. Well after a couple of days we can go to the Burrow and then I’ll be right out of your hair...”
Draco just smiled at him and pulled him tightly up against his body. He yanked Harry’s head roughly to the side to start kissing and biting on his neck. Harry cringed at the mewl that escaped his lips.
“You feel real fucking good like that Potter.” Draco slowly stroked Harry’s cock back hard, started to rock his hips.
Harry shuddered, pulling Draco tight up against him, groaning as his now hard cock pushed against Draco’s thigh.
Harry just glared at him. He couldn’t help but look at him now though, as he was feeding him and Malfoy was looking up at him with the biggest eyes...God he should have just let him fuck him earlier. He hated to admit when Malfoy was right about things, but right now it probably would have helped him think a lot clearer.
Draco just grinned and Harry spun him around, pushing him down over the table. He had to take the opportunity to admire Draco’s arse. He spread Draco’s checks with his thumbs and pushed his fingers back inside the already stretched muscle, groaning at the sight of how it stretched, at his fingers disappearing him Draco’s arse.
Hermione jerked her head back to Harry as Draco walked past her desk. Harry smelt it too. The same perfumed aroma he knew was on his skin. In his hair. Shit.
Besides, what exactly was he supposed to do if Draco tried anything? And what exactly was he supposed to be trying? Harry knew Ron had his reservations about him being there, but he’d had ample opportunity to kill him already and really, what else could he be doing here that would be more of a threat?
Harry sighed in relief as he touched his broomstick down onto the tarmac, hearing a similar noise from Hermione as she touched down next to him. They’d been gone a month and Harry was exhausted, he hated sleeping in tents. The fact that they were tents that might be about to be ripped apart by Death Eaters in the middle of the night whilst he was sound asleep didn’t really help. They took turns taking watch, and it wasn’t that he didn’t trust Hermione, but he still didn’t feel completely safe.
“How the hell would you know?” Draco spat at him. “You’re just a naïve silly little boy who thinks he can take on Voldemort single handed and save us all. Maybe I don’t want fucking saving.”
But once again Draco had seduced him, used him and humiliated him and strolled off like it didn’t mean a thing. Harry wished he felt so casually about it.
He knew he got rough when he was this turned on, this passionate. It flicked a switch in him, it always had, his dick took over, and he just wanted wanted wanted.
Harry sighed and paid for his food. Draco wasn’t long behind him and Harry pulled out the muggle smart phone they’d given him and opened the maps app.
Harry pulled up a chair next to him and laced his fingers through Draco’s. Draco gripped hard as Mrs Weasley began stitching the skin back together.
Harry didn’t know this house at all, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that they were moving away from the front door. He turned forward to see where they were headed and swore under his breath. Draco had come to a stop in front of the open door to Lucius Malfoy’s study. Lucius had his back to the door, his hood down for a change, his white hair spilling down the back of his black robes.
Harry was too shocked to even think of untangling himself from Malfoy. He had a tight grip on Harry’s waist anyway, so he was pretty sure he wasn’t going to be going anywhere anytime soon.
Harry gulped and added another finger, groaning at how Draco’s arse tensed around the intrusion then relaxed.
“Yes. Yes. Please. So good.” Harry flexed underneath him in pleasure. The fullness, and that it was Draco, was threatening to make him come untouched.
Harry’s eyes widened and he stood frozen, torn between pushing his hand down harder and running as fast as he could in the opposite direction.
Harry was beyond grateful for Hemione not throwing a million and one questions at him. About his sexuality, his preferences, what he was going to do about it. She was shocked, but she wasn’t appalled. She didn’t know what he’d done last night.
Harry blinked at the stark answer. At the only person who’d ever told him they thought he couldn’t do whatever he set his mind to.
Malfoy was perched on the end of his bed. He wore a black polo neck, dark green boxers and black socks. Nothing else.
Harry crumpled the parchment in his hand, flushing bright red. His darted his eyes around the classroom but everyone else had their gaze fixed on their text books. Snape caught his eye and raised an eyebrow. Harry blushed even harder and looked back down at his desk. Mortified.
“So you locked him down here?” Harry tried to make normal conversation; tried to be the Harry he’d become, sensible Harry, adult Harry, thinking about things in an organised manner and not as if they all just resolved to the look in Draco’s eyes as he fucked him. He nearly slapped himself, where had he been keeping all these thoughts? He hadn’t thought about Draco properly in months. Hadn’t thought about sex in months for that matter and just the sight of the boy was turning his mind back to that of a 16 year old.
The cold air started to prickle at his skin and Harry cleaned himself up and put his clothes back on. He checked over his reflection in the mirror the room had helpfully provided him with, trying to flatten his hair. No chance. His cheeks were a flushed, but other than that he thought he’d pass for normal.
Harry did as he was told, as by now he was past arguing. It had once again gone too far and he knew there was no going back.
Harry frowned, trying to work out if Draco was doing anything illegal. He was distracted by Draco’s hands moving to his thighs. He tensed.
“I brought you something...” Draco said and Harry instinctively moved back. Usually when he said that he’d brought him something that would hurt in a new and unusual way, and while Harry knew he’d enjoy it, scream and beg him for more, his initial instinct was always to back off.
“Ah fuck!” Harry nearly over balanced, groaning at the feel of the back of Draco’s throat contracting around his cock. Draco sucked him hard and eager. “Jesus Draco that’s so good... Oh... Oh... God.”
He couldn’t stop thinking about the pressure of Malfoy’s body against his own. About the goosebumps that had prickled down his neck as he’s whispered in his ear.
The green light burst from Snape’s wand and hit Dumbledore in the chest. The green light lit up his pale face for a second, a frozen wrinkled death mask, before he dropped to the floor. The paralysis spell released and Harry fell to the floor. Draco was the only one that looked down. Harry couldn’t read his expression. All he saw was that he was shaking, before a dark cloaked arm wrapped round him and guided him away.
Draco pulled his head over and guided his cock in between his lips, pushing his head down. Harry let Draco hold his head as he slowly fucked his mouth. Every few strokes he pushed at the back of Harry’s throat, keeping eye contact, watching him struggling, retching, the spit running down his face.
“You’re so fucking stupid, Potter...” Draco laughed in his ear. “Don’t get me wrong now, you’re gorgeous and you’re amazing in bed...but you are so stupid.”
“None of this is fair, Harry. I’m sure Dumbledore isn’t using you. And maybe he isn’t telling you everything, but maybe that’s because we
Malfoy kissed him hard and slow, pinning Harry against the side of one of the sofas with his weight, holding him tight with his hand and his thighs. He had clearly done this before. A lot.
Harry gave in. Something inside him cracked. It didn’t shatter, be didn’t break, but he knew the first crack had appeared in his resolve. His sanity.
As Potter got closer Draco thought surely he wouldn’t murder him in public. If he wanted to kill him he’d have picked a much subtler place. Even Potter wasn’t that bloody stupid.
Harry, love, baby and beautiful were all words Draco never used. It was then Harry realised something was very very wrong. His eyes flew open and he what he saw made him nearly throw up all over Draco’s chest.
“I feel like if you were going to kill him, you’d have done it by now. Don’t let him do anything stupid.”
“I’ll trade you...” Draco gave him an evil smile and undid the rope around Harry’s wrists, only to wrap it round his head.
Harry pushed his head straight back down, wanting it so badly. He put his hands on Draco’s arse, pulling him in further.
Harry stared at him for a few seconds and was about to say something when Hermione started shrieking at Ron. Harry could just about make out something about human rights and neglect before she raised her voice even further and Ron started backing away up the stairs with Hermione chasing after him.
He climbed out from under the grate, his feet felt like lead, sounded like lead, in the now silent office. This place, a beacon of hope and security for so many years, felt cold and dark. He knelt crawled across the floor to Dumbledore’s body, unable to bring himself to his feet. He lay across him, his head on Dumbledore’s chest. The intricate beading of Dumbledore’s cloak began to dig into Harry cheek. He didn’t care. He wept.
Apparently this seemed more like praise to Draco than it did to Harry, as Draco was positively beaming as he led him upstairs, wand at his back.
Harry laid him down on the metal table. Molly flicked her wand at the lamp, it burst into light and swung round to shine on Draco’s arm.
The hot air from Malfoy’s breath hit Harry’s cheek. Harry had his wand to Malfoy’s throat. Malfoy had his wand to Harry’s waist.
He sipped on his water. Just for a moment he had glimpsed past Draco’s work mask. But they’d both been tipsy, it was Christmas, and Harry doubted it’d happen again. The hangover was looming, and a grey cloud was descending over Harry’s world.
He thought this was the first serious conversation they’d had. Back at Hogwarts it had been straight up fucking and nothing more and Harry was starting to think he’d preferred it. Even if it had been torture, quite literally, at some points.
The sobbing came to a gasping stop and Harry realised he was alone with Malfoy in the bathroom. Malfoy whirled round and glared at him.
Harry conceded, currently trying and failing to put the key in the lock to his door. He threw the key to Draco. Draco caught it with one hand and opened it easily.
“Oh Malfoy…” Harry winced at the bruises, cuts and scars that emerged as Draco washed the layers of dirt from his skin.
Draco wanted a camera. Wanted something to freeze this in time, so every time he had a bad day he could see Harry Potter, with all his toned muscles from Quidditch, with his messed up hair and his bright green eyes sparkling with pleasure, fucking himself on his cock, with what could only be described as wild abandon.
Draco fucked him ruthlessly, pumping his cock hard, and Harry screamed as he felt himself hurled towards the edge.
Draco turned to putty in his hands, compliant and willing as Harry fucked him slowly, stretching him and enjoying the tight velvet heat inside him.
They lay in the gold glowing light of their sleeping bags staring at the ceiling listening to the rain pound down on their newly enchanted tent.
He knew what he implied. The Malfoy name was dirt. Draco was a happy scape goat for the survivors of the war to take their grief and anguish out on. No one in their right mind would take on Draco as any sort of assistant or apprentice. It would completely ruin their reputation and business.
“God you love it rough, don’t you? ‘Spose you have had a bit of a fucked up childhood. We’re a perfect match. You’re going to love choking on my cock.”
She gave him a sceptical look, like Harry couldn’t even manage to make a cup of coffee on a bad day.
He heard the sound of Draco doing the same opposite him. It was erking him that none of this seemed to be bothering Draco at all. He’d been planning on being the righteous one and putting on a brave face whilst Draco whinged all weekend.
Harry let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding and sagged against the wall. He considered turning around and punching Draco in the face.
Harry opened the fridge, it was indeed full of everything needed for several weeks worth of full English breakfasts.
“That’s the plan.” Draco gave her a fake cheery smile. “Come back if you come up with something better.”
Harry swallowed greedily, ignoring the gagging, desperate to please, to take everything Draco gave him. Draco yanked his head back and Harry gasped his breath back, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
She ran up the stairs to meet them, glancing at the Death Eater on the floor before stepping over him to get to Harry.
They both looked bored enough that Harry could rest assured they’d been fooled. He had no idea what to do about this. He’d never had this problem before. With Cho he quite liked her. He’d really wanted to kiss her and hold her hand, but it hadn’t felt like this. Blind obsession. It wasn’t normal. Ron didn’t stare at Hermione like this. Sure, Ron and Lavender had been attached at the lips for a few weeks, but that was different. At least two people had been equally participating in that obsession. This was creepy and weird.
Harry tried not to be too alarmed by the sight of Draco in the Death Eater robes. The other way he had feared he would go during the year where no one knew what had become of Draco Malfoy.
Draco’s lips twitched and he threw a locking spell at the door. He pulled himself up and wandered lazily in the direction of the showers. Harry gave the door another nervous look then followed him into the bathroom.
The woman’s scream came again from the room with the open door, amplified and shrill. Harry ran forward into the room, ignoring Malfoy’s hisses to slow down.
Harry felt his mouth open of his own accord and despaired of himself. Why did he always submit to him like this? He was an adult now, why was he still playing Draco’s childish games?
Harry spluttered and tried to put his hardening cock down to the warmth of their sleeping bags. Draco grabbed a fist full of Harry’s hair and kissed him hard.
“Don’t look so scared, I told you, I can’t have murdering the Minister of Magic on my ledger when I’ve just skirted round a trip to Azkaban.”
Harry cock bobbed hard in between his legs. His whole face burned now. Draco smirked at him. Harry was pinned to the bed by his stare. He tried not to shake. Draco was delighting in his awkwardness and Harry knew it. He tried to take a deep breath and pull himself together but the breath caught in his throat.
“Fuck. Fuck. Oh…” He knew he was going to come soon. It was inevitable. This was the best damn thing he’d ever felt in his life.
Harry lay down on the cold stone. Draco crawled on top of him, and he needed to be inside him more than he’d ever needed anything in his life.
Harry couldn’t form words. Enjoy wasn’t the one he wanted. He wasn’t aware it was possible to feel so exhilarated and satisfied, yet so ashamed and humiliated at the same time.
Draco waved his wand and the rope whirled from round his head, wrapping itself instantly round his wrists again. Harry didn’t much care anymore, he just let his head drop onto the mattress as he felt the thing sending him into a state of ecstasy. He could feel it moving, swelling inside him...he was vaguely aware that he was letting out a low groan.
Harry jumped out of his skin at the thudding on the door, then closed his eyes in despair as he heard Major’s voice on the side of it.
He pushed open the door to the spa and walked in. The wind chime above the door jingled at him. Melancholy banshee ballads played from the stereo in the corner and several customers were lying back in recliners having their nails done.
“Keep still.” Draco touched his wand to Harry’s wrist, whispered a spell and Harry’s hands stuck firmly to his sides.
Harry didn’t bother to try and deny it. He was fairly sure Draco knew everything from his sleeping to his bathroom habits. There’s no way he’d be able to sneak a boyfriend past him.
Harry turned and looked desperately for Ron and Hermione. He was flustered, sweating and still had a slight erection. Malfoy looked completely unruffled.
A low growled meow perked his interests and he followed Draco in, leaving the door open and keeping half an eye on the paralysed Death Eaters.
He’d had this before. Then it had been Voldemort’s voice. The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end.
Harry laughed and looked at his books that he’d neglected to kick of yet, that were currently creating a damp patch on the upholstery that he was sure he’d get a bollocking for later.
It was a long ride to the Malfoy Manor and Harry felt himself reluctantly relaxing back against Draco as they flew. Draco kissed him briefly on the side of his neck, his arms were already wrapped round Harry; the only thing keeping him on the broom in his still somewhat jelly state. Harry winced. All he could think of was Ron and Hermione’s faces looking up at him...the horror in their eyes.
He was still suspicious though, as when Malfoy yanked him sideways into a broom closet by his collar his first reaction was still to put his wand to his neck.
Harry was glad Draco and tied him up, because now he didn’t have to worry about what he was meant to be doing with his hands. He knew it was only simple magic, that really, if he wanted to, he could break his wrists free. He left them where they were.
Draco just sat down and gave him a small patronising smile, as if he was following Harry’s orders purely out of politeness. Implying that if he wanted to, he could break out of his chains at any time. Harry was fairly sure that he could, which was why he was particularly suspicious of what he was really doing there.
It brought Harry great relief to see, that Draco, and after a year, had been reluctantly accepted into the ministry. He stood now talking to the other PAs. Harry dreaded to think what they spoke about. Probably the nightmare of trying to organise people like him. A band played in the background. A far more reserved affair than the rock band they’d had at the Yule Ball. The memory made him cringe. At least he’d come a long way from sitting on a bench alone with his best friend.
Harry put his coffee down on the side next to Draco’s empty mug before he sent it flying across the room.
Draco pulled back with a pop of his lips and stood back up. He kissed him again and Harry kissed him back eagerly, groaning as he felt Draco stroking their hard cocks together.
“Oh yeah, Molly, can you check the back of his head. I stitched it up but... You’d better check it.”
“Shut up, Malfoy. I was going to tell you, Harry, but you know I can’t contact you when you’re away. He turned up here in the middle of the night, banging on the back windows and demanding to be let in. Kept going on about him being a secret spy for The Order and how he’d come here to warn us.”
Harry nodded, throwing his cloak around himself and walking down to Defence Against the Dark Arts. He slid himself down in his usual desk, hoping he didn’t look as flushed as he felt. He couldn’t look Hermione in the eyes.
“What, these handcuffs?” Malfoy pulled them out of his pocket. Harry frowned at him, he hadn’t even noticed him pick them up. Nevertheless, they needed to be on before they came in.
“You’re struggling with this, I know. If it makes you feel better, look at it like this, at least now you’ve got no choice.”
“Bend over.” Potter moved to the side and pushed him down over the stool that Draco was sure wasn’t there a minute ago. Bloody Potter. He put his weight on it.
Harry’s experiences at kissing had not been amazing. Paranoia sparked that he was going to be crap at it and he’d give Malfoy another reason to make fun of him. Malfoy grabbed the back of his hair, hard, pulling his head back, hovering his lips over Harry’s. Harry flushed as a whimper escaped his lips.
“You’re…very welcome to…” Draco managed through the long continuous moan that seemed to be coming from his mouth.
Harry nodded reluctantly, wondering if he’d still be conscious if the pain continued for half an hour.
His heart twisted, were Ron and Hermione safe? Who else had they killed to get this far? Harry prayed no one had stood in their way.
Harry cautiously stepped into the shower, thinking that in fairness, he was now covered in half of Malfoy’s dust and could do with washing it off.
He turned round and found Draco was giving him the most innocent of smiles, as if they were the best of friends. Harry rolled his eyes and stepped out of the shower, surprised that he could even manage to stand. He grabbed a towel and walked back into the bedroom, drying himself off. He knew that he was supposed to be watching Draco, but right now he couldn’t bear to look at him.
“Your powers of perception are still sharp I see. Steal the Death Eaters. If you’re plan has worked the ones they’ll have left behind here are thick as shit, they’ll not know me from their own.”
“Ron?” he called back over his shoulder at the last minute, thinking he might want to know what he was walking into, but he got no response. He rolled his eyes, presuming they’d probably gone back to their room to “cuddle”. It worried him that his first thought was how - after a month’s trekking and camping around the country side - Hermione had the energy. He quickly shook the thought from his mind and knelt down to open the trapdoor, thinking he might as well find out for himself.
It vanished from the parchment. Harry’s stomach turned. He was sure this was just a school boy trick, probably from Malfoy, but after his experience with the diary in second year he was wary.
Harry sighed in relief and relaxed back into the chair. It was all going to be okay. Hermione would fix him, and Malfoy’s childish little trick would be over. He jumped as she dropped a pile of books on the table.
He despaired of himself. This was exactly what Draco was setting this up to look like; that he was secretly a spy for the order, that he was changed, that he was lovely, and let Harry fall flat on his face for him before...
He looked at the clock: lunch was in half an hour. There was barely time to panic. To decide whether or not to go. His stomach churned. His cock hardened at the thought of being in a room alone with Malfoy again, let alone any of the things he wanted to do to him. It was probably a trap. A mockery. Blaise had probably been peering over Malfoy’s shoulder when he wrote it. Well Harry hoped they had a bloody good laugh about it too. He gritted his teeth. His blood churned. He stared at the passage they were meant to be reading and didn’t read a word.
Now Harry had established there was no threat and dropped his wand, he realised that he was in a very small space with his…He couldn’t complete the sentence. Sexual partner. Fuck buddy. Death eater wannabe. Malfoy. Small space with Malfoy.
“Oh hell.” Harry grabbed at the stone floor with his nails, desperate for something to hold on to. He switched for Draco’s hips, noticing that if he pulled Draco down at a particular angle Draco’s breath hitched. And it felt fucking incredible.
Now he was in control Draco felt himself get there almost instantly, burying himself balls deep in the poor boy and hard, making him shriek, in what..? He didn’t know, or care really.
“Not beyond repair!” Hermione was sulking in the corner. Both of them had refused to leave to go and eat their dinner.
“Potter,” Draco leaned closer and drawled in his ear. “It’s very normal. Don’t be embarrassed. Turn over and let me do my job.”
He knew it was fruitless. Draco wouldn’t put his family in danger. Anything Harry said would cast doubt on Draco’s allegiance. Hermione grabbed his hand and squeezed it tight. He was relieved that someone knew what was going through his head and shared it with him. Knew his heart was ripping apart as Draco walked across the bridge towards his mother.
“The thing is though,” she said tentatively, “it’s been weeks now. I don’t think it would still be working. Unless he was constantly slipping it to you.”
Draco pushed on Harry’s shoulders. Harry met Draco’s challenging gaze but gritted his teeth and did as he was told, ignoring his own yearlong aching cock and kneeling down on the bare concrete of the basement. Draco raked his hand through Harry’s hair and guided his head towards his cock. Harry didn’t need the encouragement.
Draco yanked down Harry’s trousers and pushed his face into Harry’s bulging boxers. Harry’s eyes rolled back into his head.
Eventually they touched down outside the Malfoy Manor. It was turning out to be a gloomy day, and although the rain had managed to hold off whilst they’d been flying, Harry could feel it starting to drizzle. Malfoy let Harry slide to the floor and stood up, pointing his wand at him.
“Yes,” Draco hissed in his ear. He kissed and nipped at Harry’s neck as Harry did what he thought he was supposed to do. “Ah
Draco hissed in a breath in anticipation. Harry teased him, running the tip of his cock over Draco’s arsehole.
He waited until Hermione had come to stand next to him and tapped his broomstick on the floor three times, still feeling a slight sense of wonder as the houses in front of him moved aside to let 12 Grimauld Place appear in front of them.
It surpassed everything. Every wet dream, every fantasy, every night spent pumping his cock with the curtains round. Harry couldn’t even compare the two in his head. The heat of Draco, the weight of him as he pushed against him. He shuddered.
Harry ended up with a prawn mayonnaise sandwich and a packet of salt and vinegar crisps. It reminded him of terrible school trips when the Dursleys ‘forgot’ to pack him something and the schoolteacher had to give him whatever they could find for under 3 quid.
He watched Draco raise his arm in slow motion, watched him shaking, trying so desperately and failing, in what he had been tasked to do.
Draco cast a warming spell on his dinner and began to eat in the hostile silence. It was not the worst one he had ever endured in this dining room. Not by a long shot.
Harry knew from sharing an office with Draco for a year that he was silent almost all of the time. That when he made a noise it was because he wanted to be heard. So, when Draco pushed his chair back with a curdling shriek against the wooden floor Harry jerked his head up.
“Look, Malfoy. I won’t tell the teachers. I don’t need to know why. I just need to know what it is so I can reverse it.”
Draco moved his hand from Harry’s cock and traced circles across Harry’s ribs with his fingertips. Harry squealed. Draco laughed.
They crept through a living room, the dinning room and a kitchen before finding themselves back in the hall. Harry frowned at Draco. There was nothing out of the ordinary, in fact nothing magical at all to suggest a wizard or witch lived here. A door creaked upstairs and Harry nodded to Draco.
Harry blushed, despite there being no one there to see. He’d never touched himself like that before.  Draco always did it.
He was exhausted. Finally, after he finished eating a desire to sleep set in for the first time since he’d arrived, and he curled up in Draco’s bed. It didn’t help that it smelt of him. That gorgeous mix of sweat and aftershave that drove Harry completely mad. He fell asleep grinding his hips hopelessly into the sheets.
He shook his head at his own delusion and hopped down off his bar stool. People seemed to be leaving. Draco came back over to him.
Draco grabbed the rope and pulled it tight, pulling him back onto the bed. Harry scrambled to keep up with him so the rope didn’t pull too tight round his neck. He sat and watched Draco undress, dipping his fingers into the pot as he watched Draco slowly reveal his pale skin. He was still so lithe, so beautiful.
“Fuck, shit.” He cursed behind Harry as he pulled on his boots, followed him out of the tent and over the hedge.
Harry cried out. Jesus but it had been a long time since anyone had done this to him, let alone done it well.
This time when Malfoy kissed him he didn’t bother to pull away, he gave in and kissed him back, letting the flood of emotions that went with it hit him full in the face. Every time he tried to fight against Malfoy he just ended up winning anyway, what was the point in resisting?
Draco had a black eye. Harry had a bloody nose and some blood in the corner of his eye. His jaw ached.
Draco stepped back off him and Harry heaved in a breath, trying to get his bearings. Draco took his shirt off and threw it onto the floor. Harry stared. His bearings were well and truly lost. Draco’s skin was so pale it was almost translucent, his waist slight, with a thin dusting of platinum curls on his chest, in between his legs. The dark mark glared up at Harry from Draco’s right forearm, and Draco didn’t seem to care if Harry saw it.
Harry’s gaze snapped to Draco’s. Draco was looking at him blankly and pushed his thumb into the curve of Harry’s foot when he didn’t respond. Harry cried out then bit his tongue at the delighted look on Draco’s face.
Malfoy didn’t comment, just sat quietly, letting Harry feed him. As Harry looked back to him he thought he saw a slight sparkle in his eyes that said he was just as desperate as Harry was. He wondered vaguely what kind of excuse he could make. This was certainly new thinking for him. Before, at school, the only thing he would think afterwards was “never again” and whenever the next time was, Malfoy had initiated it. Now he was planning it himself, admitting to himself he wanted it to happen. It made him feel ill.
Draco walked in shortly after him. Snape didn’t say a word, much to the disgruntled murmurings of the class. Anyone else would have been in detention for a week.
“Reckless...you could have ended up locked in here with us and burnt to death,” Hermione said, staring at him hard.
Draco was in heaven. He’d gone slack on the stool, letting Potter do whatever the hell he wanted with him, as long as he kept fucking him he didn’t care about how.
“I know you don’t have one, Potter, I know what you do every second of your day. I’d know if you were seeing anyone.”
Harry could barely breathe. Every time Draco moved it felt like he would come, but he couldn’t. He had never been so glad. Harry knuckles were white as he clutched the plastic coated mattress.
Malfoy had long ago let go of Harry’s hand. He was keeping it on Malfoy’s crotch completely of his own volition. Harry took a deep breath and pushed his hand down, his heart skipping at Malfoy’s gasp. The bulge grew under his hand and Harry’s fascination with Malfoy’s rapid breathing took over his nerves. He pushed his hand under Malfoy’s waist band, wrapping his hand round his hot cock.
Malfoy held his wrist up and shook them and Harry heard the metal clink. Harry was speechless for a second, trying to make sense of the situation, and trying to adjust to being back in Malfoy’s presence again.
Harry bit down on the back of his wrist as Draco pounded his arse, the obscene slapping sounds mixed with Harry’s shaking cries filled the dungeon.
Draco was stroking his side, smiling almost lovingly at him as he started to scream, the thing still growing bigger inside him. Draco curled himself around behind him, wrapping his arms round his waist and holding him still; feeling him shaking in his arms, still stroking his side.
He sighed crawled into the tent for protection. Draco followed shortly after and they sat, almost knees to knees, and eat their sad petrol station dinner.
“I’ll make some tea then...” Harry started, not really wanting to sit in between Ron and Malfoy who were currently staring daggers at each other.
“Yeah, yeah, ah...” he moaned as the toy stretched him again. He grabbed onto Draco’s hair tight as it pushed hard on his prostate.
“Oh Potter. I guess I was just a little younger that you when I discovered how much I liked bouncing up and down on Blaize’s cock.”
“God, Malfoy.” Harry muttered. He grabbed Draco’s arse and pulled Draco him down hard against his waist.
He cried out loud as the wall disappeared and he started to come, harder and longer than he ever had, digging his nail into Draco’s hips, fucking him hard and erratic as he came in long shudders inside Draco’s arse. He grabbed Draco’s cock, pulling him over with him. Draco shook and shuddered, groaning loud as he came in Harry’s hand, with Harry still pounding out the last of his intensified orgasm on his arse.
“What? Dressed appropriately? I’m not a moron, Potter. I have no desire to freeze to death in the Lake District because you can’t control your temper.”
Draco groaned and brought his hand up to shield his face. Harry dimmed the lamps. Draco was a mess, a skinny, bruised, filthy mess. Harry had to exercise all his self-control not to go back up the stairs and blast the death eaters to kingdom come.
He was trying to make his way over to the blonde, but every few steps someone caught his arm, desperate to speak to him. There had been too many galas lately, too many hours spent with his politely interested expression plastered on his face. He accepted another champagne. And another. Still trying to get across to the hall towards Draco. He excused himself for what felt like the tenth time to get to Draco. This time he ignored the voice calling him back.
Draco fucked him hard, his palm coming down on Harry’s leg again and again until they both covered in sweat, sliding against each other, their skin coming together in wet slaps.
Potter stroked his finger from Draco’s temple, down his cheek bone. He undid the gag. It fell to the floor with a clack and Draco smacked his lips together. He wished Potter had left it in, it had been serving as a very good excuse as to why he hadn’t said anything incredibly clever and cutting yet.
Harry threw another orb of light at the chandelier that hung over the hall. The Death Eater had Draco by the neck with a wand to his temple. Another stood behind him in an identical black robe. He couldn’t see either of their faces.
Draco squirmed, tightening his hands on the bars of the cage. Desperate for Potter’s touch. Anywhere.
They watched in mystified horror as the muggles unpacked the cages one by one and took them into the house. They never saw the owner.
“Oh…” Harry’s mouth was hanging open as Draco moved, the tight heat sliding up and down his dick leaving him breathless. Draco kissed him, pulling on his lips with his teeth, running his teeth down his neck. Harry began to move with Draco, his hand on Draco’s back guiding them together.
Potter kept his hand in between Draco’s shoulder blades, holding him down on the stool as he fucked him. Potter fucked him fast, his hand coming down on his arse every now and again, catching him off guard.
He picked up his wand and Harry closed his eyes, dreading to think what he was going to do. The spell washed over him and it took a few moments for it to take effect. Harry groaned when he realised what it was.
Harry put his hand on the wall to steady himself. He groaned as Draco wrapped his other hand round Harry’s cock, slowly stroking as he slowly fucked him with his fingers. Draco kissed and nipped at Harrys neck with his teeth.
Harry’s eyes would not stop finding Malfoy in the corridor between classes, in the great hall at meal times. He already knew Malfoy’s timetable from before, when he was trying to work out what he was up to. He found himself taking shortcuts, that were actually detours, that would lead to him walking past Malfoy on his way out of class.
“He made you act crazy Harry. This entire time. From brewing reversal love spells, to stalking him round the castle…”
Draco didn’t look back. How could he? There was no mental messages now. Harry imagined there were far too many powerful wizards and witches here to intercept them. No more clever games, no more torn parchment messages, no more being dragged into broom cupboards, no more smirks. No more dancing. Draco was taking his place next to his father.
Draco put his fingers on the glass and gritted his teeth. Wanting nothing more than to go in there and throw boy wonder over the bed and fuck him till the house shook. He took a sip of his coffee.
He tried to compose himself and not hopelessly rut against Draco’s stomach. Draco touched his wand again, slippery gel covered Harry’s fingers. He took a deep breath and moved his fingers inbetween Draco legs. His hand was shaking as he pushed a finger inside Draco’s arse. It was hot, tight and inexplicably soft. He had sort of done this before at least. He moved his finger back on forth, trying not to pass out at the thought of what was going to happen next.
“Hi!” Harry called, heading for the kitchen rather quickly, trying to make it apparent that he was happy for them to have some time alone whilst he got himself a drink. He flicked on the kitchen light and smiled as he looked around, finding that everything looked much the same as when he’d left it. The other Weasley’s had gone back to the Burrow for Christmas but since Harry and Hermione were away Ron had offered to stay there for them.
Malfoy flicked his wand at him and the Death Eater went flying over the balcony and landed on the hallway floor with a sickening smack.
Harry nodded. He took a scrap of paper off Draco’s desk and scribbled his floo address on it. Draco grinned.
He was running his thumb down the contents page of his text book in Potions that he realised what must be going on.
He shrieked as Draco pushed inside him. Draco didn’t mess around so much this time, just held his hips still with a tight grip and fucked him hard. Harry was whimpering, he was so sensitive every stroke was making him want to scream. Draco’s hands were tight on his hips as he fucked him, letting out his usual low guttural moan as he did.
“I’m not bluffing,” the Death Eater said. It would be my absolute pleasure to send this brat to hell.”
He walked quietly up the stairs, unlocked the door with a whispered spell and let it swing open towards him. The guard sat with his back to him. Harry stunned him, yanked him back into the cellar and closed the door quietly again. They paralysed and stripped him. His glared at them from the floor as Draco slipped on the robes.
Harry’s brain seemed to have shut off, he couldn’t accept what had happened, how he felt, or what he was going to try and do next. In the meantime it seemed to be in his best interests to just do whatever Draco wanted.
Draco was glad his face was pushed down into the stool now. He reached behind him and pulled his cheeks apart. He heard several groans from the crowd behind him.
Draco coughed and Harry watched as Draco proceeded to bring up a liquid that looked very much like a Veritaserum and spit it into the sink. He sighed as he realised that they were back to square one, that Draco could have been lying the entire time.
“Don’t be so bloody ridiculous, how stupid do you think I am? That you’d come waltzing in here without a wand? That you somehow lit that chandelier without a wand? Jackson, search him.”
He pulled on his dressing gown and gave Draco a shove, remembering that he was supposed to be watching him.
“What, would you have had me drink that properly? You know what that does. If it had worked I would have told them that yes I came to save your lives but also I had a particular interest because there was a certain boy I wanted to fuck?”
This was how Voldemort had risen to power. He realised that now. Fear, manipulation, luring people in, holding friends and families to ransom. That and the promise of power.
He had no idea what he’d agreed to, but it caused Hermione to shake her head at them both and make a quick exit diving into the girl’s bathroom.
“God help the Dark Lord if I was such a bad liar,” he whispered in Harry’s ear as he finally took his hand.
“Would you like a straw?” Harry drawled at him. Malfoy glared at him. Harry smiled, glad to be annoying him.
Even given the seriousness of the situation he’d found himself pulled into, winding Granger up still made him feel better.
“Malfoy!” one of the Ravenclaw’s Harry didn’t recognise said as it landed on him. “You have to…” she picked up the card from the deck. ‘Kiss for five minutes…”
They were in the library several weeks later when Hermione finally admitted defeat, closing shut the last book and emitting a cloud of dust that clung to her eyebrows.
Harry moved him faster, crying out as the heat pulled him closer, the delicious pressure, the sound of Draco moaning above him every time he pulled him down hard on his cock.
“God your arse, Draco. Fuck!” Potter cried out loud as he pushed harder, deeper, and Draco just took it, moaned, pushed back. “So good. I could fuck you all night.”
“Then let’s go.” Draco leaned forward and started fucking himself on Harry’s cock, slow, so Harry felt every god damn inch of that tight grip around his cock.
It was then he realised Malfoy was no longer behind him. He swore under his breath and turned around slowly.
“You feel so fucking good,” Draco muttered against his lips. “Gonna come inside your perfect fucking arse, all mine then.”
“Whatever...” Draco was looking round the room distractedly, examining the various magical objects that were stacked on the shelves. Harry jumped as he heard two pairs of footsteps on the stairs.
Harry muttered darkly under his breath, scribbled his assent on the rsvp and threw it on his out tray.
“I’ll wash up,” Harry immediately volunteered, wanting to get away from Malfoy for a moment. He was fucking with his head just by being close to him.
“You’re not gonna jump, are you, Potter?” he froze at the sound of Malfoy’s voice behind him. “Wasn’t that bad, was it?”
“Oh god. Draco yes!” He came inside him, his fingers digging into Draco’s slim hips as he shook through his orgasm.
The reality of the situation hit Harry and he went to grab his wand. Malfoy already had it in his hand. Harry went to smack him again but Malfoy caught his wrist, he went to struggle but Malfoy whispered a spell he didn’t catch under his breath. He felt his whole body turn to jelly and he slid down to the floor.
“Oh...” Harry brought out his wand and broke them. Draco took his hand and let Harry help him to his feet.
“I mean,” Harry said as Draco rested his forehead against his. “I was thinking more dinner…somewhere nice?”
Malfoy stood on the stand, looking resigned to the inevitable, leaning his forearms on the gold filigree. He looked at Harry hard, his grey eyes nearly burning through him, until the judge called out his name.
Harry kicked off his jeans with a little more attitude than Draco would have liked and went on to push down his boxers. Draco walked around him, inspecting him closely. Harry squirmed, both need and embarrassment coursing through him.
He picked up his beer, swigging it as he tried to remember where the toilets were in here. He couldn’t remember. He needed air. He gulped in the fresh air as he walked out onto the turret, breathing it out slowly and trying to settle his whirring mind.
“I never agreed to be your god damn boyfriend, Potter. I never agreed to any of this. I’m not a fucking Gryffindor. I don’t do the whole self-righteous hero crap. I am who I am.”
The smell of coffee filled his nostrils as he kept it balanced on his chest. It brought him round a little from his tipsy stupor. He looked away quickly and took a swig of the coffee.
It was the slightest whisper in his ear, but it woke Harry in an instant. He tensed. Draco had slid into bed was leaning over him, stroking a finger across Harry’s forehead.
Harry paused, then moved his hands down to Draco’s arse, easily lifting him up and and letting him drop back down on his cock.
Harry needed him closer, he undid Draco’s dressing gown, sliding his arms round his waist, pulling into him tightly. This was why he never let Draco kiss him. Sure, he was hard, but that wasn’t what was driving his urgency. He desperately needed to feel Draco tight up against him, to keep him close, to feel his arms wrap round his waist in return.
“You think I don’t know that?” Draco shouted then closed his eyes and sighed quietly.  “I can’t turn against my family, you wouldn’t understand.”
Harry paused for a second then did as he was told, throwing his clothes into a pile on the tent floor. He went to crawl into the warmth of Draco’s sleeping bag but he stopped him.
Draco took his hand away and kissed Harry again, hard and deep. Harry raised his hips to meet every one of Draco’s rocks, desperate for more contact, for anything he could get. Draco ran his hand through Harry’s hair.
“Relax. Let me take you.” The words turned Draco into putty and he felt Potter’s fourth finger slide inside him.
“Nothing. It’s fine. Hang on.” Harry grabbed the tip of his wand from the back of his throat and carefully extracted it.
“So angry, Potter, aren’t you? That I came and reminded you of who you really are...” Malfoy whispered in his ear as leant up against him, pushing him back against the kitchen counter. He leant up to stroke a finger down his cheek. “So much pent up rage and denial...it’s not good for you...”
“No,” Harry said eventually, pulling himself together. “Not at all. I just didn’t realise you worked here, Sam. We know each other from school.”
Harry let Draco lead him around the room. Let him spin him back and forth. Harry reveled in being close to Draco again. It had been two days. It felt like months. Maybe Hermione was right.
voice, startled him and he whipped round, lost his footing and fell, down what appeared to be a very long set of stone steps. Harry was sure he hit every single one of them on his way down, with every pointy part of his body.
“Distraction. We fed them bad intel that our safe house is up in Scotland. They’ve sent everyone but your father and a couple of lackies up there I believe. The Order are outside. I’m waiting for the allotted time, and I’ll get us out of this basement, get past the Death Eaters, take down the wards, and get out of here.”
Major was ashen faced and out of breath. He wasn’t usual one to overly panic. He was a rational man.
Harry sighed, picked up their plates and walked over to the sink, hearing the handcuffs clink as Malfoy dropped them onto the table. Harry turned on the tap and squirted some soap into the bowl, trying to stop himself imagining Draco throwing him back onto the table, clicking the handcuffs around his wrists and fucking his brains out.
Harry whipped round onto his back, horrified that someone would have heard Malfoy come in, but there was no sound from the other boys.
The parchment incinerated with a tiny puff of black smoke. Harry swore under his breath and sucked at his singed fingers.
He pushed open the bathroom door and frowned. The shower was running but Draco was standing by the sink, bent over.
“So, what are you going to do? When it comes down to it. You’re on opposite sides of the battle, he kills one of us. You kill one of theirs. Then what?”
They were both silent for a few minutes. Harry concentrated on the sound of knives and forks scraping on plates and not on the look on Hermione’s face. She went to turn her head.
It was pitch black inside and silent, from what Harry could hear. They stood for a second, listening, before Harry cast a small ball of light that sat in the palm of his hand. Draco followed him in. They were standing in a large hallway, steps rose in front of them to the second floor.
“They’re pissed because the Ministry are restricting what they can take back and forth over the border.”
“Look, you’re taking up half my seat.” Draco slapped his hand down on Harry’s thigh. “It’s called personal space, Potter.”
Light exploded in Harry’s head as he came violently. Draco held him up against the wall tight by his neck all through his spasm and tremors, seemingly unconcerned by the cum that came from Harry in endless threads, covering Draco’s trousers.
He edged closer to Malfoy, backing him up against the sinks. The Slytherin was reaching behind him for his wand.
Harry slid in next to Draco, grateful tears forming in his eyes that Draco was alive, that he’d managed to extract him safely. This was all he had thought and dreamed about since Draco had apparated away with his mother all those months ago.
He swallowed down Draco’s cock like he’d been dying to for so many lonely nights, wondering whether it was inappropriate to keep having these dreams about Draco when he didn’t even know if he was alive for god sake. His cock hadn’t wanted to hear it.
“Harry, why has he got your dressing gown on? Looks more like your bloody boyfriend than your prisoner...” he muttered.
They walked over to the edge of the campsite, that just happened to back onto the drive of the house they were meant to be watching. Through a great deal of privet hedge of course.
“Maybe we should go some time,” Draco purred in his ear. “You wanted to take me out right? We could go to some muggle club, and you could spend the entire night grinding that righteous cock up against my arse.”
They had grown up, supposedly. Malfoy’s hair had changed, he wore it shorter these days, hanging casually as if never styled. Harry didn’t believe it. Malfoy was dressed in blue jeans and a black polo neck, muggle clothes for their muggle training, maybe he had a few wrinkles around his eyes, but their colour, piercing grey, and the glare that he gave Harry for taking his time flicking through the pages…well. They might as well have still been in school. Maybe Morgan was right.
Draco grinned as Harry started to scream and wrapped his hand round his cock, biting down hard on his shoulder. Harry screamed as he came even harder than before, trembling as he felt Draco satisfy himself. He went limp and let the wall take his weight for a moment.
Harry got up, stretched, then grabbed his half of the tent and took it off the train. The bitter wind nearly knocked him sideways. Malfoy hopped down beside him and they looked around at the empty train platform. The one bathroom had a padlock on it. The shutters on what Harry assumed usually was the café were down, without any signage about when they might possibly be open again. The night was already drawing in. They walked out onto a mostly empty ‘main road’ with no shops except a petrol station across the street.
Harry knew he didn’t really care and just thought Harry’s annoyance amusing. He’d seen Draco when he was truly enraged and wrathful, and this wasn’t it.
Harry didn’t reply, just gave Draco a small smile and slid down into the bath. Draco held his hand out to him and Harry swam over to him, letting Draco pull him in his lap.
Draco shrugged. “Being an order spy in the Malfoy Manor under your father’s nose isn’t the safest of occupations.”
Harry didn’t need telling twice, he rocked and pumped his cock till he was sure he’d have come a hundred times, if it wasn’t for that damn spell.
Harry followed Draco into his house, barely even looking around, just keeping his eyes on the tails of Draco’s robes, making sure he didn’t lag behind.
It was the exactly the same time the next day when Draco pulled him into the same closet and shoved him face forward against the wall.
Draco reached out blindly, finding Harry’s face and flinging himself on him. Draco knocked Harry down onto his back, making sure any part of him that hadn’t been bruised by the steps didn’t feel left out.
Harry’s heart thumped in his chest. He couldn’t do this. Could he? He was already so far in, what was the harm of falling a little further, just this once?
Harry did as he was told. Malfoy straddled his hips and stroked Harry’s cock a few times with the oil. Malfoy bit his lip, looking down at Harry’s cock as he stroked it. Harry groaned, never wanting to see anything again that wasn’t Malfoy straddling his lap and biting his lip.
“You’re the one that’s late!” He’d meant it to sound casual, but it came out petulant. He tensed all the more.
Harry mewled in protest, so close to the edge, so unwilling for this to be over. Draco kissed his side, light, butterfly kisses, and Harry shuddered.
Potter gaze didn’t slide away this time. He carried on staring. Holding Draco’s gaze as he picked his way across the room, around the cavorting couples, the cages, the tables. Draco lips worked around the plastic of the gag in his mouth, wondering whether to make a run for it. He knew Potter shouldn’t be able to hurt him in here. The cages were warded, the idea being that subs could only let you in if they wanted to. But this was Potter. He’d defeated the Dark Lord. He could probably destroy the cage with a snap of his fingers. The thought made Draco positively hard.
“The tip off says their meant to be arriving with the illegal goods between midnight and 1am, but we should probably keep an eye out.”
It took Harry a moment to catch his meaning, then he laughed, wondering how Draco knew what his Patronus was.
Draco let out a silent scream, sure if Potter held him there any longer he was going to pass out or break through the spell. If that was even possible.
“Okay, you can. Just untie my hands...” Harry was far too cautious about Malfoy and why he’d really come here, to let him keep him restrained like this, as much as he might otherwise like it.
“Tap!” Draco ran to the opposite side of the room and stuck his head underneath it. “I can’t believe there’s been a tap here all this fucking time and I didn’t find the it!”
“I made your eyes water.” He kissed Harry’s temple lightly, brushing away a tear dripping from his eyelash.
Draco nodded and downed the bottle, lay back and closed his eyes. He looked tiny and frail in Harry’s bed as he fell asleep.
He compliantly opened his mouth and let Harry pour it into his mouth, locking eyes with him as he did, flicking his tongue out to catch the last drop. Harry thought he might die on the spot. Draco opened his mouth to show them it was all gone.
He leant down and kissed Draco’s neck, letting his body weight drop onto Draco, pinning him down on the table.
Malfoy whispered something under his breath and the thing started to vibrate and swell in size. Harry’s eyes widened and he went to move away but Draco’s hand was already firmly on his hip.
Draco ignored them and went over to the two-way mirror that gave him a perfect view of Harry tearing his hair out.
Harry watched Draco across the hall. He looked even more tired and drawn out than he did last night. Harry’s heart hurt. Draco was lying. He was better than this. He knew it. And it was tearing him apart. Draco knew what would happened if he switched sides. Draco’s parents would be dead in a second.
“A hundred wet teenage dreams,“ Draco mused and brushed his fingers through the dark hair on Harry’s chest. “Let’s see how true to life they were.”’
“You look good flushed,” Draco told him, before taking his cock in his mouth and reducing all of Harry’s previous sexual experiences to the awkward fumbles that they really had been.
“Well you’ve already paid ahead, so if you can find a space, pitch right up!” He laughed at his own joke and went back in the toilet block.
“Don’t be ridiculous. There are going to be casualties. Losses. Both sides. This isn’t a one-man war. Even if you did kill Voldemort, even if we win, his parents will be held to account. He will be held to account. Where do you stand then?”
Harry drank his cordial slowly as he waited for Draco to finish eating. Draco was methodical, with table manners Harry could only dream of, dabbing at the corners of his mouth with a napkin he’d found from god knows where in Harry’s kitchen.
He swiftly sat opposite to Hermione, his back to the Slytherin table, before his thoughts became too physically obvious. It was quiet at the Gryffindor table, just them, a few first years, and a scattering of students across the other tables. Harry had got bored of staring at his alarm clock at 6am and decided to give in and go to breakfast early. It was the first time he’d seen the Great Hall before 8am.
“Also, I went to back to my dorm and wanked myself dry thinking about fucking your Gryffindor arse. I’ve been warming up to the idea since then.”
“Ah yeah, there, there, that’s it…” Draco gasped and pushed his arse back hard against Harry’s hand. Harry groaned, his cock throbbing painfully.
Steam was already filling the room and Draco beckoned Harry over to him under the water. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry and Harry let out a happy sigh, not caring if Draco mocked him for it, and rested his head on Draco’s shoulder. Draco didn’t comment for once and kissed Harry on the side of his head. The held each other under the water, the silence between them saying more than they ever could.
One by one the Death Eaters turned and walked away. Narcissa’s hand was on Draco’s back, guiding, as if she knew that at any moment he might turn and run for the other side. He went with her, softly, head down. At the end of the bridge both Narcissa and Malfoy turned back to look at the school. Harry was too far away to catch the direction of Malfoy’s gaze.
Harry was trying not to shake underneath him. He was harder than he’d ever been in his life and struggling to catch his breath.
As Draco stilled and gasped for air Harry shoved him onto his back, grabbing the back of his head and pushing it towards his cock. Draco opened his lips and sucked eagerly.
“Poor little boy wonder.” He pulled his fingers back, moved over Harry and pushed his hard cock back inside him.
Harry rolled his eyes; for all the times Draco had fucked him, he still didn’t understand why he’d chosen him or why he found him attractive at all. Simpering girls and their mothers who thought he was a hero found him attractive. Draco Malfoy...god knows why.
In Harry’s fantasies there would be some reason he could trust Draco, blackmail, an unbreakable vow, a reason they could be together. In reality there was absolutely no reason to trust Draco. Yet he was showing no resistance as Draco pushed him back against the sinks, plunging his hand inside his trousers.
Harry groaned but tried to do as he was told, sweat beading on his forehead and his chest as he flung himself back and forth, dragging Draco’s cock over his prostate.
Last time pointed out that he could just do wandless to one of the seniors they had shushed him down and told him to keep quiet about it, especially with the rest of the squad. Harry hammered the peg into the cold hard soil.
“Because I’m not a tramp, Potter, and my mother instilled certain standards of cleanliness into me.”
Harry bit down on Draco’s neck and picked up his pace, flying high on the pleasure, on the sound of Draco crying out beneath him with his every thrust. He was getting used to the wall now, the times between hitting in were getting shorter, he just gasped and carried on, pounding Draco into the table, regardless of how blue it was making his balls. It was so good. Too good. Nothing in the world had every felt like this soaring euphoria.
Harry whimpered as he pushed down another inch, catching his breath, wondering how the hell he managed to take it all last night.
“Nothing wrong with a pretend wife. I was meant to have one of those. She was a lovely girl, from France.”
The memory haunted Harry’s dreams now as it always had, but it wasn’t his old friend and headmaster falling to the ground that played on Harry’s mind the most. It was the expression on Draco’s face, torn, anguish, desperate to do what had been assigned to him, to make his family proud…his completely in ability to do so.
Seeing Malfoy at a muggle train station carrying half a tent was pretty bewildering. Harry had to admit Malfoy was blending in better than he’d expected, wearing dark blue jeans, walking boots (Harry was surprised to see these had some wear on them) a slate grey fleece and a dark green waterproof coat. He had a black knitted beanie pulled down over his platinum hair. The tent was packed in a ruck sac. He carried a steaming take away cup of what Harry imagined was coffee.
Draco grinned at him, like he knew exactly what he meant, and carried on getting himself off. Harry realised his hands were hanging limp at his sides. He had no idea what to do with them. He moved one to Draco’s chest, tracing the lines of bubbles that rested on the fine platinum curls. He took a deep breath as Draco moved faster, trying to hold himself back. Draco smirked knowingly.
“They thought because of your use of it in the Triwizard cup you were obviously part of the movement.”
Harry let himself go. He fucked Draco erratically as his body took what it wanted. Draco’s arse clenched hard around his cock and that was all it took. He cried out loud, pounding into Draco’s arse, burying his head in his neck, coming what seemed endlessly, shuddering and twitching as he came.
Draco kissed the top of his head and began to massage his shoulders. Harry melted into him, letting himself enjoy a moment of serenity.
Harry didn’t dare to ask why the one he’d just got didn’t count as a proper fucking. He looked around nervously.
Harry groaned as Draco dug in his thumbs, tsking at the tightness and giving Harry another dose of the oil.
Harry just blinked at him and tried not to come all over Draco’s hands. His eyes were rolling back in his head, his back arching when Draco whispered the spell under his breath.
His heart thumped in his ears and he hoped to god some back up was on its way. He knew he should have waited.
Harry cried out loud as he came, hands tight in Draco’s hair as he fucked his mouth and came down his throat.
Harry swore under his breath. They were five minutes away. He couldn’t tell Malfoy. Not that it was even his fault.
He didn’t know why he was being so honest. Though he supposed there was little point in lying about it. He was pretty sure Draco knew all this already.
“You are both twenty-five years old. Twenty-five. Yet I receive constant complaints of your squabbling and disruption of every project you’re put on together. And now, look at you both!”
“Okay. Don’t approach. We don’t know what they’ve got in there. Come back with the photos tomorrow. We’ll take it from there.”
He told himself he musn’t complain. Draco actually made an amazing personal assistant, far more competent than his last one. Better than the scowling ruiner of social occasions Draco thought he might be. How he managed to be so polite, knowing how some of the people spoke about him, was beyond Harrry. As time went on he liked to think that they were beginning to accept Draco. He insisted on Draco coming everywhere with him. Always on at his side, his diary always to hand, manuscript, quills, and a supply of Harry’s favourite chocolate frogs on hand. He’d learnt quickly that a hungry Minister was not a happy Minister.
Harry tried but all that came out was muffles. Draco grinned and pressed up against him once more, biting the most sensitive part of his neck that he’d carefully left exposed. Harry wrapped his arms around him tightly, pulling him in closer, breathing him in. He felt himself running his hands all over him. Good wasn’t the word to describe having Draco so close to him again, the word was sinful.
Draco yanked Harry’s head to the side and ran his teeth down Harry’s neck. Harry thought he might ruin in his pants.
“Are you kidding? Your bed’s awful, you seriously need a new mattress. Don’t tell me, it’s the same one that’s been there since you took over this place?”
Draco’s hard cock jutted into Harry’s thigh and he arched back against it, wondering if today was going to be the day.
“I’m not sure. He’s pretty strong. I’ll try my best. I think I already made some good progress at the house.”
He had a mental block on sensible thoughts. He couldn’t begin to process his sexuality right now. He wanted Malfoy. Malfoy was a Death Eater. He hated Malfoy. This was all he had on the subject.
Harry tuned out as the list went on. He was replaying that moment when he was hiding down low, under Dumbledore’s office, watching Draco standing with his arm outstretched, wand trembling in his hand as he attempted to perform his mission from the dark lord. He remembered Bellatrix at his side, her arm around his waist, whispering in his ear.
Draco raised his eyebrows in the way that usually meant Harry really should have just done as he was told.
They dumped their bags in the hold at the end of the cabin and found their seats. Harry groaned inwardly, the carriage was jam packed, save for two seats next to each other with tickets sticking out the top.
“Fuck!” Draco screamed, and, to Harry’s  relief the spell broke and he felt this blissful release wash over his body as he came, shuddering, into Draco’s arse.
“Holy fuck!” he cried as Draco pushed himself down on his cock, shimmying his hips so he was fully seated. “Draco!”
It was late when Harry got home. The sun was coming up over the high rises as he looked out from the windows of his flat. Despite Major’s weather protection charms he had still somehow got soaking wet. He was drenched and shivering. He ran himself a steaming hot bath and threw his wet clothes into the basket. He shuffled round in his dressing gown and cleared up the coffee cups, looking for a while at the space where Draco had been sitting on his sofa. He’d missed his chance. He was sure.
Harry groaned that Draco was once again going to make him pleasure himself, hammering the point home that he wanted this, needed this, that Draco was in no way forcing him and he only had himself to blame. He was so close though, that there really was no other option, so he pushed himself down on Draco’s hard cock in one smooth movement, crying out as he did, only eliciting a grin from Draco, not even a hiss of pleasure.
Harry stuck his fingers up at him and chucked him the binoculars. Draco caught them and they shuffled round each other in the tent.
Draco’s face was golden in the glow from his sleeping bag. How he could look so innocent and be such a nightmare Harry had no idea.
“What are we doing?” Harry blurted. He couldn’t help it. It was peaceful, and warm, and Draco was lovely and naked and soft against his wet skin, but his mind was still screaming in objection.
It was only when he realised the circle had gone quiet and looked down at the bottle when he realised it was pointed at him.
“What? I like it both ways.” He rocked his hips and grinned. The biggest grin Harry thought he’d ever seen on his face. “Oh yeah. That’s good.”
“We regret to inform you that due to staff shortages, there is no trolley services or canteen trolley available on this service. Our sincere apologies.”
Draco grinned at him in triumph and swooped down on his cock, sliding it straight to the back of his throat and swallowing for all he was worth.
“They didn’t think it would be wise, as cocky as they seem, they weren’t about to go and attack a house full of adult members of The Order.”
“Oh yess....” he cried as Harry’s tight arse finally undid him, he waved his wand as a lazy afterthought.
Draco turned on the coffee maker and smiled as it happily buzzed and distributed coffee into the two mugs.
He glared at Malfoy over his cauldron. Malfoy looked up and mouthed ‘what’ at him over his cauldron.
Draco moaned in his ear and rested his head on Harry’s shoulder, making sure Harry caught every sigh and gasp coming out of his mouth.
“I told you. I know what you’ve done. I don’t know if it was a prank, or something Voldemort told you to do, but I need to know the reversal potion.”
A rational voice was trying to tell Harry that he had to see Draco on Monday. And great many other days after that. If this all went horribly wrong, if he was reading this wrong, it would be a disaster. Draco gave him a small smile and laced his fingers through Harry’s, dragging his thumb up the palm of his hand. Harry tried to tell his cock this was not a sign to stand to attention.
“Yes! Yes! Fuck yes!” he cried, coming hard and shaking against the door. Harry felt the tremors down to his toes and his fingertips, trying desperately to gasp some air into his tight chest. With a finally shudder Harry came back to earth and gasped a proper breath in, wincing as Draco slid his fingers out.
What irritated Harry most was how Malfoy strolled through the door like he hadn’t a care in the world, whilst Harry stood there with his nerves on edge, every muscle tensed. Bastard.
Harry tried to gasp in vain, his head spinning, adrenaline through the roof, his eyes rolled back into his head, trying to scream against Malfoy’s hand. Harry could swear he was floating. He was light headed, higher and harder than he’d ever been in his life.
Harry held Draco down, one hand on his shoulder, one on his hip, and fucked him hard and fast. He was losing control, his body tensed, spasmed and thrust how it wanted, deep and hard into Draco’s willing arse.
Harry clenched his jaw and didn’t rise to the bait. The effort was clearly visible and caused Malfoy to smirk at him. Harry took a deep breath.
“Hermione?!” He heard Ron’s voice travel down the stairs and winced as Ron flicked the bright hall light on that Harry had put there to try and lighten the mood of the hallway. Mrs Black had been removed from the wall in a particularly boring month last summer but her presence seemed to linger on in the dark hallway.
This seemed to spur Draco on, and he moved his head faster. Harry’s legs shook with the effort of keeping him upright.
Harry realised he was going to have to say something to get them all to leave. He got rid of the silencing spell. Draco sucked harder on his cock.
“Shut up, Potter...” Malfoy snarled in his ear, grabbing his hard cock through his trousers, Harry groaned at the contact, could feel his body giving in already. “You think I came all this way just to save your stupid lives? Just your’s actually, think I’d let them kill my little pet? No chance...It’s been far too long as it is, since I’ve been buried inside your tight little arse, Potter...”
He groaned in spite of himself as Harry moved faster, he could feel himself getting close...so close...but it just wasn’t quite...he sighed in frustration.
“Have I ever told you?” Draco said as he threw the last of his clothes on the floor. “That I’m a bit of a clean freak?”
“That’s it Potter. Work for it. Fuck yourself on my fingers. Pump your cock. Do some work for a change instead of standing there like some blushing virgin.”
“Oh...Draco...Draco...god I love you…” it was out of his mouth before he realised what he was going to say.
“Are you kidding? Harry that potion could have killed you. It was reckless of me to even try it, they’re not reputable potions Harry, not approved, they could have done anything. I don’t know what I was thinking.”
“Of course not. You think powerful wizards walk through here often? Coming through for a mani pedi?” Draco laughed. “People don’t pay enough attention. They don’t care who I am. Which suits me just fine.”
He found it double locked which was strange, he couldn’t remember them leaving anything down there of value. He picked up the key from the shelf and clicked open the lock, opening the doors and making his way, wand raised in front of him, down the rickety stairs. He held his lit wand up to see that the contents of the cellar appeared to be the same, apart from a bundle of clothes in the corner. Except that it wasn’t a bundle of clothes, it was a person.
Harry did as he was told, feeling himself thrown hard against the invisible wall again at the feel of Draco’s arse stretching around his fingers.
“Fuck! Ah!” Harry did, crying out, scratching his nails down the floorboards as he came all over the floor.
Harry tried with all his might to break out of the paralysis spell. He had to do something. He couldn’t just stand here. His wand hung like a limp extension of his arm. It wouldn’t be moved. Dumbledore shook his head at him through the grate. He could see Draco’s face above him, twisted with anguish.
“God, Potter.” Draco panted in his ear. “You have no idea how much I’d like to just fuck you right now. While you’re this tight.”
Harry stepped back. He didn’t trust himself in such close proximity to Malfoy. There was something about the way he spoke, smirked, smiled, the way he drawled. The way he fucking stood. God. He was smitten. It was disgusting.
Draco didn’t bother trying to reply around his gag. He couldn’t think past Potter’s large erection that was pushing into his leg.
He knew Draco was just screwing around with his head, he’d never before shown any sign of affection or wanting to treat him like this, he’d never wanted to share a bed, cuddle and have real conversations before. Either that, or being locked up in his father’s house, had truly made him crazy. Or changed him, a very small voice said in Harry’s head.
He found the place and waited, questioning himself as he always did about whether he’d remembered the location correctly. The bricks began to shift with the click clack sound of magic Harry could only dream of understanding.
As Harry sat down and laced his boots back up Draco disappeared into his bedroom. He wondered what on earth he was doing until he came back with a silver shirt and set of plain black robes. More subtle that the dress robes he’d worn to the party.
“I feel like I’ve been dreaming about this for months. You down here, like this.” Draco reached for Harry’s wand and slicked his fingers. “So pliant...”
Eventually Malfoy shrugged, smirked, took a gulp of his drink, and walked across the circle. Someone squealed.
Harry laughed, putting his hands on Draco’s shoulders, moving slowly, carefully, gasping, learning. He started to move faster, lifting and letting himself drop down on Draco’s cock, squealing every time he did. Draco lay beneath him, biting his lip, clearly trying not to take back control.
“Or do you really detest me that much that the only way you can imagine feeling anything but loathing for me is a love potion?”
People were staring. Of course they fucking were. It wasn’t every day that you saw Saint Potter flouncing round a gay bdsm club. Everyone was sworn to secrecy, you made the unbreakable vow to even get into the place, swearing not to talk about anyone or anything you’d seen inside. So people wouldn’t talk about it. They couldn’t. But people would
The tight heat on his cock was incredible, like Draco’s mouth but, more intense. Draco put his hands on Harry’s shoulders and rode him hard. It was all Harry could do to sit and stare with his mouth agape as Draco moved above him, that same grin on his face. He was still struggling with the idea that this was happening, that Draco would make himself this, vulnerable? Like Harry would feel in that situation anyway. Draco didn’t look vulnerable at all as he took his pleasure.
“I’m screwed, Potter. From all directions. And not in the fun way. I’m starting to come to terms with it.”
Harry froze. He couldn’t breathe. He realised now it was very obvious where this was headed. But he really wasn’t sure whether Draco wanted to snog him or punch him in the face. He still wasn’t certain.
Harry resisted the urge to throw himself over the books to hide his secret from him. He knew Ron wouldn’t give the books a second glance. He handed them some sandwiches.
Malfoy raised himself up and pushed the tip of Harry’s cock into his arse. Harry gritted his teeth and tried not to grab Malfoy’s hips and pull him down hard onto his cock like he was dying too.
“It’s a shame it's so important that I remain at Hogwarts, or I’d leave this ridiculous class.” Malfoy rolled his eyes dramatically and put his hand on Harry’s waist.
“These clothes just won’t do.” He waved his wand and they were gone. To Harry’s surprise Draco walked to his wardrobes instead of towards him.
“Oh, thanks,” Hermione smiled, “We’ll go and do our packing then and we can head off. We should be there by lunch.”
Harry tried to look as innocent and baffled as possible. Luckily Snape strode into the classroom and saved him.
Two more boxes were unpacked but the contents were obscured. Harry snapped a couple more pictures of the men, the van and the license plate. The men got in the van, slammed the doors shut and drove off into the night.
“I’d let you. My answer is still the fucking same. Now, would you please step aside? I’d love to hex you to kingdom come, but father is rather keen that I complete my education, and I wouldn’t want to get expelled.”
Draco washed his hair and Harry melted back against him, feeling like he might slip down the drain at any moment. They continued their silent shower, dried off, and walked back into the dorm room. Harry was still struggling with the concept of Draco being in the Gryffindor tower, let alone his dorm room. He was about to get dressed when Draco got back on the bed and put his arms out to Harry. Harry gave the door one more nervous look then joined him.
Draco kissed him through the steam, long and lazy. Draco was bliss. His mouth, his hands, his smell. His fingers that were back on his cock, stroking him again.
“Sensible. If you want me to stop, bang your hand on the floor. Safe words don’t really work when your mouths full.”
Harry was shaking as he stood on the front line, flanked by his best friends, his class mates, his tutors, as they stood tall in front of the castle. He hadn’t seen Draco since Dumbledore’s office. It burnt in his chest that he didn’t know where he was, whether he was safe, but he finally understood what Hermione meant. At the end of it all, there was the war, and he was going to fight in it. He knew what side he was on. Draco, well. He couldn’t make that decision for him.
“And it sounded like the biggest load of bullshit I’d ever heard. I didn’t know what to do with him, Harry...”
Harry glanced up at the train time display, sighing when he saw the train was due any minute and he definitely didn’t have time to go and get himself a coffee.
The Death Eater looked perplexed as his wand crumbled to dust in his fingers. Harry had a second to enjoy the indignation on his face before Malfoy snapped his head back against the Death Eater’s face. The Death Eater searching Harry span round and Harry yanked the wand from his hand. He petrified them both and Malfoy got up from where he’d been beating his Death Eater to a pulp on the floor.
Harry ignored him and dug out their binoculars. He wrestled with the hedge until he got a good line of sight.
Draco pulled off Harry’s boots. Harry felt oddly exposed, and also paranoid about when he last washed his socks.
He thought of the least sexual thing he could imagine. He thought about the time Hagrid had taken him out to the Forbidden Forest to help him shovel Centaur manure into a giant wheelbarrow. Hagrid swore it was the best fertilizer he’d ever used in his life. Harry had spent the entire three hours breathing through his mouth and trying not to pass out. The memory worked well. His body relaxed, more intent on repulsion that arousal, and Harry managed to close his eyes without the imagine of Malfoy popping up again.
“Night,” Harry sighed and lay still on his back. He closed his eyes and despite thinking that he wasn’t at all tired, seemed to drift off to sleep straight away.
“Fuck.” Draco collapsed on top of him, wresting his chin on Harry’s chest, smirking at the mess he’d covered him in.
Harry breathed out hard. He desperately wanted to pull Draco up against him and snog him properly as he’d been dreaming of doing since yesterday’s encounter.
“They sent me out to scout around the town, we’d got word of some Order activity nearby and they sent me to see if I could make anything of it.”
Harry squirmed. He was still rock hard and the promise of Draco’s mouth was almost too much to resist.
“You know if Voldemort didn’t want you alive I’d have reduced you to ash by now. I can’t stand the sight of you, you pathetic little coward.”
Harry wasn’t concentrating, he only really paid attention now in classes he thought would be useful against Voldemort. Dancing his way out of a fight wasn’t a tactic he’d considered. That was why he’d been staring into space when McGonagall told them all to choose a partner. It was also why he and Malfoy now stood in the middle of the dance floor looking at each other with identical expressions of horror.
Draco squeezed harder on Harry’s throat till Harry could barely draw in a breath. Draco lifted him with strength Harry thought he’d couldn’t possibly have. It must be a potion. A spell.
Draco moved faster, his face still inches from Harry’s, eyes still locked. Harry stared up at him, at his flushing face, contorting with pleasure, mouth open and grinning as he pounded Harry’s arse hard and just how he wanted. Harry groaned, shaking underneath Draco, his cock jumping every time Draco’s stomach brushed it.
Hermione frowned. “I don’t think we have much choice. He can stay here, but not locked in the damn basement.” She glared at Ron. “One of us will have to stay with him at all times, though.”
Draco cut him off with his mouth, grabbed Harry’s wrists and pulled them behind the chair, touched his wand on the table and whispered something under his breath. Rope lashed round Harry’s wrists.
Harry pushed harder, ignoring the gaging. Ignoring his body’s protesting. His whole body wretched and Draco yanked his head back.
Harry supposed he might as well. He put his hands on Draco’s sleeping bag, his hands shimmered gold, it passed from his hands and spread across the folds of Draco’s sleeping bag. Draco groaned.
Draco adjusted his hair in the mirror, flicked his wand at his trousers, cleaning them perfectly, turned, and walked out.
“Of course I’m interested in you!” Harry deliberately side stepped the question and laughed, blowing on his coffee.
Harry still didn’t understand why they had to get there so early, or go half way across the country for a stake out. Surely there were officers closer who could take this job. Either way Harry was reluctant to drag himself out of bed on a cold January morning to go sit in a tent with Draco fucking Malfoy.
But they were going to the Burrow - and soon - and then if everything Malfoy said was true...maybe it would be alright that they were fucking. He cringed at his own thinking. This was exactly what Malfoy wanted him to think, and it could all be a complete lie. And he hadn’t even told them about Malfoy not drinking the Veritaserum. He knew though that if he was going to tell them at all, he should have told them then, now there was no way. He was part of Malfoy’s conspiracy now.
Draco grabbed his arse and pulled him down harder. Harry moaned, tangling a hand in Draco’s hair and biting Draco’s neck.
Harry just moaned louder, hoping that would be enough for Malfoy as he writhed on the sheets, curling his knees up to his chest.
Potter moved his hand up to Draco’s hair and pulled him back up, kicked his stool out the way and threw him face first against the bars again.
“Oh, if it’s proper cooking I’ll do it,” Hermione got up, ushering Harry back to his seat and taking out her wand.
He grabbed Draco’s cock with one hand and pushed a single finger inside Draco’s arse hole with the other.
Harry had never felt so intimidated. He had no idea how Draco was doing it, when he was the one telling Harry his schoolboy crush secrets.
Draco yelled out, grabbing Harry’s shoulders hard and he came, fucking him so hard Harry’s eyes rolled back into his head.
He thought he was going to get a smack in the face for daring to touch Draco’s hair but instead he earned himself a low moan in his ear and a hand around his leaking cock.
“If you’re his best friend why did he never tell you he was getting fucked seven ways to Sunday by a Slytherin?”
“Malfoy, don’t,” Harry said in the sternest voice he could muster, following Draco up the stairs. He didn’t know why he bothered, he knew it had been a while, but he very much doubted Draco’s refusal to listen to anything he said would have changed.
Harry moaned, rubbing his cock up against the sheets. He’d been close before with the toy, now it was agonising.
Harry grinned, he felt good. He was full, complete, and soaring towards an incredible orgasm when the spell pinched around his cock.
The room came back to him, throbbing music, the shrieking, the laughing, the drink. He pushed back up of Malfoy quickly and resumed his place in the circle taking a generous drink of his beer.
Harry flushed deepest red and Draco knelt in between his legs and ran his thumbs up the inside of his thighs, holding his cheeks apart. Harry’s cock throbbed painfully between his legs.
Draco ran his teeth down his neck as he pushed down Harry’s trousers. Harry’s breath came in short bursts.
Draco rubbed down Harry’s chest, his pecs, moved to the side of him to stroke down his abs. Harry couldn’t breathe. Draco’s fingers skirted just shy of his boxer elastic and it took every bit of Harry’s self control to keep his hips on the table. He tried not to shake. Draco swiftly took his hands away and moved to Harry’s arms. Harry relaxed a fraction. That was okay. That meant Draco was nearly done, then Harry could shove his erection into his baggy work trousers and no one would ever be any the wiser. He doubted he would even see Draco again.
“What? I distracted him! He didn’t notice you come in, didn’t hear the screams of his friends and he definitely didn’t hear as you dragged them in here. What more do you want?”
He opened his eyes and saw Malfoy looking back at him. He looked surprised, but it wasn’t the same looks of horror that he was sure was on his face.
At least it used to. Now it just made him pissed, he was a better wizard than him, he had no right threatening him like that. He had no right at all to make him feel any of the things that he did, and yet...
“Oh they did say you were hot headed, Potter. But I couldn’t quite believe my luck. The boy who lived and the blood traitor with him. It’s my lucky day.”
Harry looked at Draco pleadingly, he never touched himself and Draco knew it, not like that. He couldn’t bring himself to, no matter how desperate his body was. It would be admitting things to himself that he really wasn’t ready to.
Draco grinned and came all over his chest. Harry groaned, his cheeks burning, covered in cum and sweat.
“Draco, we’re needed...elsewhere,” he said, looking at Harry. “A few days, we need to leave in half an hour. Be down in the hall. He stays here.”
“Well come on then!” Malfoy shook his hand waiting in the air for Harry’s. “You do know how to dance don’t you?”
Harry sighed and did as he was told, letting Draco massage the cream into his hair. Draco whispered something and Harry felt his scalp tingle.
“Because...” Harry tried to put it into words. He wasn’t really sure why he was bothering, Malfoy clearly didn’t really care and just wanted to know so that he could manipulate him further. “Because you fuck me like you hate me...”
Harry stared, gripping the sides of the couch to keep control and not throw Draco to the other side of the room and fuck him senseless. Draco bounced, slowly stretching himself over Harry’s cock.
Draco didn’t comment, just discarded them onto the floor and took out his wand. He conjured a bubble of water and soaked Harry’s feet, inexplicably keeping both their legs and the sofa perfectly dry.
“I was not whinging,” Malfoy huffed, trying to negotiate picking up a cup of tea with his handcuffs on.
Draco snapped his hips down fast and Harry gasped. Draco smirked rode him faster, the smile on his face widening as he got himself off. Harry’s body ached from tensing. So ready to spill over.
He heard Ron walk past and into the showers, followed by the dragging footsteps of the rest of the boys.
He shuddered at Draco thrusting in his mouth, at his moans, at the tight grip he had in his hair. And that pressure in his arse, intense and unrelenting. He grabbed Draco’s legs with both hands to stop his hands from wandering to his cock and getting himself off. He didn’t want it to be over soon. Didn’t want it to be over ever.
He wasn’t sure about the next part. But he knew it wouldn’t be good. No, he was not going to fall for this.
“Probably not,” Harry sighed and went back to his paper work. He found a Christmas party invitation insistently sparkling at him. He’d kept putting it to the bottom of his papers, but it seemed the time was coming where he couldn’t ignore it any longer. It had started spitting glitter at him every time he touched it.
“Someone’s talked. There’s more of you traitors lurking then we realise.” He tightened his grip on Draco’s throat. “I knew you when you were just a boy, Draco Malfoy. Oh. Such promise. I wonder when the rot began.”
“I should have never gone with them,” Draco said eventually. “I don’t know how I could be so stupid.”
“Of course they did.” Harry sighed. “God, Draco, how many years ago was that? How does anyone still remember that?”
“I haven’t since the end of the war. I don’t like wearing masks to those places, and Malfoy’s aren’t exactly welcome.”
“That’s so good. Potter. Fuck. Yes.” He gasped as their hips met. “Mmm, “ he shuffled his hips, making sure he was fully seated. “I like that.”
He chanced a look at Hermione. She looked delighted and scandalised all at the same time. Harry was hyperaware of Malfoy’s every movement as he walked back to his place in the circle and sat back down. He looked utterly dishevelled. He smirked at Blaize sat next to him and took another swing of his drink.
For a while Harry had thought this personality was just another sex toy to use on him because he knew it drove him wild, and the more pleasure he gave him, the more he knew that Harry loathed himself, and Malfoy loved nothing more than to humiliate him. But then Harry had started thinking that it came a bit too easy to him, sometimes the look of pure hate in his eyes as he fucked him was just a bit too convincing to be fake.
Draco gave him a smile, put his mug on the side and got up. Harry was terrified for a second that Draco was going to leave, but instead he lifted up Harry’s feet, sat down on the sofa, and placed them back in his lap.
Harry gritted his teeth, knowing any effort he made to stop Draco would alert Lucius to their presence. He didn’t want this hanging over Draco for the rest of his life. The chair spun round. Harry instinctively darted back from the door before Lucius could see him. Draco wasn’t so fast.
“Well. You’ll be please to know I’m planning to escort you from this hell hole. I trust you’ve no objections this time.”
“Wouldn’t you rather I got on my knees and sucked you off?” Draco sucked on his neck pointedly. “Do you think I’m good? Have you imagined face fucking me with that righteous hero cock of yours? Do I choke on it? Swallow it down?”
The door slammed and Harry swore. Draco burst out laughing under the sheets. Harry pulled him up and pushed him onto his back.
A cool breeze passed over Harry’s skin and Harry found himself clean. He ran a hand through his hair and found it not only clean, but decidedly softer than usual. Harry frowned.
Draco slowly coaxed open Harry’s lips. Harry let him, let him ravage his mouth and bite his lip between his teeth, let him grind his hips down against his. He’d never been this hard. Ever. He was clinging desperately to Draco’s arse, the only thing he really had to hold onto, but all it did was push Draco’s crotch into his own, sending the sensations out of control. Draco rocked his hips and Harry had to stop him.
Harry desperately wanted to kiss him. It seemed trivial after what had happened last night, but it was the reining thought in his brain. Not a blow job, or a fuck, or whatever else Malfoy had spoken about last night. He wanted Malfoy’s tongue in his mouth. Their bodies pressed together hard. He wanted the heat back. The pressure.
Draco waved his wand and Harry’s clothes were gone apart from his boxers. He put his wand back on the table. He sat astride Harry’s lap and Harry groaned at Draco’s hard cock against his own. He rocked against Draco instinctively and moaned at the sensation.
“I’ll do it,” Harry said reluctantly. His body wanted it, sure, but his mind certainly did not. “You two probably want to spend some time together.”
Harry was sitting in the girls’ bathroom at midnight frowning over a cauldron and seriously regretting his words. The mixture in his cauldron looked like wet soil that had been lurking at the bottom of a drain for several months. It smelt much the same. He was trying to contemplate whether his stubbornness and loathing for his new ‘feelings’ about Malfoy were worth drinking/eating the sludge at the bottom of his cauldron when a pair of size four patent shoes came into view. The sheen on Hermione’s tights glistened in the candlelight.
Harry closed his eyes and let Malfoy clamp his mouth down on his, if only so he’d stop talking so much filth that Harry was worried was entirely true. Harry’s plan backfired, Malfoy’s kisses were as filthy as his words. Harry pushed down Draco’s trousers and pumped his cock, his chest tightening at the idea that he could ever have all that inside him. And that he wanted it. He wanted every fucking inch. He moaned into Draco’s kisses and Draco pulled back, chuckling in his ear.
Harry cast a silencing charm round the bed and grabbed the toy from where he’d hidden it at the back of his dresser drawer.
“You don’t say. Let me just have a look down here, I wanna see how it looks inside you, how much progress we’ve made on your tight little arse hole.”
