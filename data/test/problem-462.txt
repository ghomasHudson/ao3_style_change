Also I always imagine Harry's scar as larger than the film and more like how an actual lightening bolt looks. I saw 2 pieces of fanart on Tumblr that show what I mean so I've put them in as well. Being completely honest I don't know what the etiquette on that sort of thing is so I've put their @ to give them credit (please let me know if this isn't correct).
Draco scoffed at this and wrinkled his nose as his cup of pumpkin juice contained large amounts of pus from a troll.
Harry didn’t stop walking or turn around or say anything. He just walked down the stairs with a much too happy smile on his face. He found his friends sat on a sofa in their Eighth Year Common Room.
With no choice as to where else they could go, they begrudgingly sat next to Harry, Ron and Hermione.
The rest of the lesson was spent discussing with Professor Erinys what they had and hadn’t covered as a class so she could figure out the best topics to cover first. It felt like a lot of admin and it made the class pass pretty slowly. That being said, Harry wasn’t entirely sure whether it was the uneventfulness of the class making it pass slowly or the fact that, from where he was sat, facing Professor Erinys meant Harry had Malfoy in his field of vision the entire time. Malfoy, who had spent the past half an hour spinning his wand around in his left hand under his desk. Harry felt mesmerised like a cat watching a laser. A couple of times Hermione nudged him and broke him out of his trance, forcing him to pay attention to the discussion happening, but mostly he just watched Malfoy.
“I was under the impression, Parkinson, that your helping me was to remain between us. Wouldn’t want to tarnish your reputation by letting people think you’re going around helping Gryffindors.”
When Harry looked up, he met Malfoy’s eyes again. It didn’t escape his notice that they both had flower tattoos for their mothers.
“Oh Harry, I’m so sorry you’re having to deal with this. Whatever it is, Ron is right; you can tell us. It doesn’t matter if you don’t tell us for days, weeks, or months. However long it takes, we’re here for you.
“What’s in Hogsmeade that has to do with the party? Seamus is getting the booze and the house elves-“
About 20 minutes into the film, Malfoy leaned over and whispered into his ear, “He looks like you, you know.”
“The Potter family is a pureblood family. Sacred-28 or not, I had to learn your family’s history including your grandfather. I would say I’m surprised nobody ever told you but then again you have been a bit preoccupied over these last few years and whilst Sleakeazy is a miracle worker, I doubt even it would have been able to help you take down You-Know-Who.”
After some protesting, Harry managed to convince Hermione and Ron to leave the room and eventually, found himself once again sat in silence with Malfoy.
“Sorry I-” Harry stammered, suddenly noticing the scars he caused on Draco’s torso back in Sixth Year. “I’m sorry Malfoy.”
“Clothes? This better not be to do with your entertainment Pansy I swear if you make me put a skirt on or something...”
The three of them headed down to the Great Hall, Ron and Hermione having a conversation about who knows what whilst Harry got distracted by looking at the castle around him. Every direction he looked he could picture a different student being attacked during the battle. He could hear their screams. He had hoped that after having the summer away from Hogwarts would help him forget about everything he saw but these things rarely went Harry’s way...
That evening the rest of the students arrived. Harry was somewhat disappointed that they wouldn’t get to go on the Hogwarts Express with everyone else but when he thought about the crowd of people on the platform he was thankful that they had arrived by Portkey. McGonagall had wanted to allow them extra time to deal with the emotions of returning. The memories Harry had of the castle last year were less than pleasant and he knew that his fellow Eighth Years had it worst of all. They had been the ones stuck here with Snape and the Carrows all year. Seeing innocent First Years tortured by the cruciatus curse. Hearing the screams of the children who had been brave enough to speak out against Voldemort and were facing the consequences.
Draco looked up to see the intense green gaze of Potter again, who had just spoken and was clearly waiting for a response.
“Wow, Granger. Clearly you’re finally living up to your title as the brightest witch of our age.” Malfoy drawled on his way past the trio and up the stays towards his and Harry’s room. “And Potter, you better not have made a mess of the room before I’ve even gone in.”
He found Ron and Hermione in the corner on a little squishy sofa and went to join them. Just as he opened his mouth to speak, Hermione quickly started questioning him. “Harry are you okay? Everyone seems to be talking about something you said last night but Pansy made everyone magically promise not to reveal what it was to anyone who wasn’t in the room so nobody can tell Ron and me what happened. Do you want to talk about it? Was it about the war? Was it-“
Harry loaded up his plate full of food and ended up listening in on a conversation between Lavender, Padma and Anthony Goldstein who were sat a few seats down on the other side of Ron and Hermione. They seemed to be trying to work out the most likely couples between the different students.
Malfoy simply nodded and then the room settled back into awkward silence. Which was very uncomfortable, if Harry did say so himself. In an effort to distract people, he quickly shucked off his own shirt to reveal his own tattoos. For a second, Harry had forgotten about the various scars that littered his chest from various moments in the last decade. Until the whispering began. And the pitying stares.
“I haven’t dated anyone since Ginny if that’s what you want to know.” Harry didn’t mentioned that, whilst he hadn’t dated anyone per say, he had certainly hooked up with lots of muggles in clubs and bars over the summer.
He didn’t think he had ever noticed before how long and thin Malfoy’s fingers were. Hermione would have said that he had piano hands. They were such a stark contrast to Harry’s hands, which were tough and calloused. Malfoy probably used some poncy hand cream. That must be it. There was no other explanation. Why else would Harry have noticed them? It wasn’t like he had some sort of hand fetish, if such a thing existed. He was sure if Ron took that much care over his hands then he would notice. Or Dean or Seamus or Neville. That must be it. It had nothing to do with the fact the hands in question belonged to Malfoy.
The same thing goes for people. When you meet somebody new you may not hit it off but the more time you spend together the more you get used to their presence and they grow on you, albeit like mould in some cases, but you get used to them nevertheless.
Pansy was the first to speak next. “Since Draco has been so kind as to share details about his poor, pathetic love life, it seems only right that a Gryffindor also joins in on this lovely conversation.
I told myself this would be a light-hearted almost cliché fic yet I’ve already sprinkled in some trauma and angst for Harry to deal with. Which wasn’t intentional however I’m also a firm believer that fans of the Harry Potter series as a whole disregard the trauma Harry has even from non-war related incidences way too easily and that he deserves everything and more in this world. I would go as far as to say that Harry Potter is my favourite character in the Harry Potter franchise which is surprisingly uncommon given he is the literal main character.
I would recommend watching LK2:SP just cause I mention it a lot but if you don’t want to just know that if the Lion King if Lion Hamlet then Lion King 2 is Lion Romeo & Juliet without the tragic ending.
After Pansy was satisfied that Harry was stocked up with enough Sleakeazy to last a couple of months, the two of them began to walk up to the castle.
He thought, as he walked up the stairs, that that was probably the record amount of time he and Malfoy had spent in a room together without arguing. And whilst awake. Although Harry didn’t think he would be surprised if Malfoy argued in his sleep.
They watched the rest of the film in relative silence with the occasional gasp or moment of laughter.
“He really does! A mess of black hair, ridiculously green eyes and an obnoxiously large scar on your head that is basically what you’re known for. You’re practically twins.”
Harry had thought he noticed Draco’s eyes snap up to him just as Pansy mentioned his breakup with Ginny, but he was now staring at his plate so Harry wasn’t entirely sure.
“Well, that doesn’t bode well for any of us. I daresay a thinking Potter is hazardous for all within a 1-kilometre radius.” Harry looked up and saw that Malfoy had his signature smirk on his face. It certainly managed to rile Harry up just as much as it had in the First Year, even if it was now without any real anger.
Hermione thought a bit more before Ron nudged her: “I don’t want to agree with her but Parkinson is right ‘Mione. Besides, NEWTs aren’t for ages if that’s what you’re worrying about.”
“Merlin, this is painful to watch,” Malfoy sighed. “Don’t get used to this treatment, Potter, but there’s a hangover potion on your bedside table.”
Starting something new is difficult. It can take time and lots of practice but eventually, you realise that it has become familiar. It wasn’t as difficult, and it becomes second nature and you forget how it ever felt alien to you.
“No. But it could have been.” Harry had to laugh at that; for a house that prided themselves on being cunning, they were so predictable. He supposed that’s what happens when you watch them intensely for 6 years.
“No, I’m fine I just- I figured since we’re going to be sharing a room for a year I might as well get to know you.”
After the war, this had been a rather difficult task for Harry as closing his eyes just gave his brain to play a morbid slideshow of all the horrors he witnessed during the war. Hermione’s screams at Malfoy Manor. The sight of Fred’s lifeless body on the floor of the Great Hall surrounded by sobbing Weasleys. Sometimes he took a potion to help him but most of the time he just let the memories play, knowing eventually exhaustion would take over and he would sleep.
Both Harry and Ron had sent Thank You letters in response (in Ron's case, following much persuading from Hermione) and that had been the end of the correspondence. Hermione had somehow managed to somewhat befriend Pansy through their letters and despite not being thick as thieves, they were definitely good acquaintances and got along much better than they ever had in the past, handy given they were now roommates.
Harry broke from his trance when he felt a hard kick to his shin from Hermione who had definitely noticed him staring. Harry hoped that she hadn’t realised what he was staring at but this was Hermione so she almost definitely knew.
Whilst the rest of them had been moving the furniture, Neville and Hannah had filled everyone’s mugs with hot chocolate and were handing them out.
Harry vaguely felt his hands start to shake as his breathing began to rapidly increase. He frantically looked around the room but everyone seemed to be doing their best to not stare at Harry so they hadn’t noticed his sudden distress. For the second time that day, Harry felt his stomach churning and intense nausea. As he was looking around, Hermione must have spotted him because the next thing he knew he had Ron and Hermione on either side of him; sitting him down, rubbing his back and telling him to keep breathing. Zabini, normally cool and collected, looked unsure as to what to do in this situation.
“They were always going to end up together. With that kind of tension? Even if it was between their two sides, there’s no way that doesn’t lead to any sort of sexual encounters.”
Harry wasn’t sure if he had missed something important. Had he zoned out during a conversation with her? He didn’t think so but he was so often caught up in his own head nowadays that it wouldn’t surprise him.
“Look, I’m the one sharing a room with him, not you, and whilst I’m by no means thrilled about this decision, McGonagall knows what she’s doing so she clearly had a reason for doing this.”
Harry pondered saying a quick Good Morning before deciding that that was a step too far in the ‘act civil to each other’ thing they had going on at the moment and so returned to his search for a mug. Eventually, he found them and was surprised to find a note from McGonagall inside the cupboard as he opened it:
He didn’t look up as he drank, refusing to meet his friends’ eyes although he did hear Hermione let out a scandalised ‘Harry!’ and Zabini snigger something about ‘the Golden boy not being as golden as everyone thought’.
hadn’t even crossed his mind as a possibility for what he revealed. He hadn’t thought anyone would ever find out about that, let alone his entire year group.
Eventually, Zabini spoke. “I believe that as Potter didn’t find out the piece of information during the game, he is exempt from the rule preventing the rest of us from speaking about it. So, when he wants to, he will be able to talk to you about it.”
“Was a Death Eater, Ron.” Harry sighed and rubbed his eyes with the bottom of his palms. He loved Ron but Harry was just too tired to have this conversation with him right now. He just wanted to go upstairs and unpack.
Harry said goodnight to them and that they would chat more tomorrow but that he was tired and wanted to go to sleep. And so he headed upstairs to his dorm, not without first being warned by Ron to watch out for traps Malfoy might have planted, eliciting an eye-roll from both Harry and Hermione, and found himself stood outside the door to his room. He paused to take a breath before walking in where he found Draco finishing unpacking his belongings. Harry got himself ready for bed as did Draco, neither saying a single word and tried his best to go to sleep.
So random unnecessary details for this in terms of film, I went with Lion King since it came out in 1994 so only 4 years prior and the VHS release was 1995. DVDs became a thing in 1996 but the Lion King DVD wasn’t released until 2003 hence why I stuck with VHS tape. I would have gotten them to watch something more suited to their age group however I really wanted them to watch Lion King 2 because a) it is amazing and b) it has some relevant moral lessons that I feel like McGonagall would have appreciated. Consider this your encouragement to watch it if you haven’t already. The song One of Us is an ABSOLUTE BOP and you’re missing out if you haven’t heard it.
It seemed the group was still discussing the film with Zabini, Seamus and Parvati comparing how attractive the different lions were.
Harry spent most of the meal picking at the food on his plate. He couldn’t help but feel nerves eating away at his insides although what he was nervous for he wasn’t sure. It certainly wasn’t the start of classes. In his procrastinating cleaning up Grimmauld Place over the summer, more often than not, Harry found himself flicking through his school textbooks. He was by no means reaching the level of knowledge that Hermione possessed but he finally felt he was starting to make sense of the theory behind classes like potions and transfiguration. Only took him 7 years… Funny what you can do when you don’t have a homicidal maniac after you. He didn’t think he was all that nervous about his new roommate. He wasn’t happy about that arrangement, but Harry knew that Malfoy wouldn’t try anything. Not whilst both McGonagall and the Wizengamot were still keeping a close eye on him. If anything, Harry was relieved to be in room with less people. He loved all of his Gryffindor friends: they were like family to him, however he would be glad not to have to listen to the snoring of both Ron and Seamus. Those two could give even the noisiest pigs a run for their money.
As it happened, their slow pushing had meant that all the other seats had been taken up so Harry was left to sit on a sofa with Malfoy. Pansy came over to sit with them although she claimed she could only sit on an end so Harry had to scooch along closer to Malfoy who was stretched out on the long end part of the sofa.
I think that is the angst over with for the time being (was this chapter even that angsty? Who knows)
Harry hadn’t had any lessons with Malfoy that day so the next time he saw him was in the Great Hall for dinner. Malfoy, Pansy and Zabini seemed to be surrounded by Gryffindors at the Eighth Year table, with Malfoy looking thoroughly unimpressed by this, and Harry wasn’t sure if him going over and sitting by him would make his mood better or worse. Before he could plan somewhere else to sit, he was spotted by the group so headed over and ended up on the bench directly opposite Malfoy.
“My name is Aletheia Erinys. You can call me Professor Erinys, Professor Thea, Professor, or anything else that you don’t think will earn you a detention.” She paused and looked around at all of them, a slight smirk on her face.
Thankfully, Harry didn’t have to drink at the next one (which was Seamus asking ‘Never have I ever sucked someone’s toes). He was definitely on the wrong side of tipsy and guessed that he had drunk more than most people if not anyone. As he hadn’t actually been watching anyone, he wasn’t confident in this. He looked around the room to gauge how other people were faring.
“Nope. Absolutely not. You’ve had your fun Parkinson but I draw the line at make-up. There’s no way you’re putting this muck on my face.”
This turned out to be a mistake and he realised as such when he saw the glimmer in her eyes but it was too late. She had started asking him questions about his ‘love life’. Anything to try and make him squirm or break his ice cold exterior in front of Harry.
to keep a secret from us.” Ron finished his ‘speech’ by clapping his arm on Harry’s shoulder in a display of brotherly love.
“Blimey ‘Mione, let the poor guy breathe!” Ron interrupted, causing Hermione to sit back from where she had been leaning forwards in her seat whilst looking quite embarrassed.
A/N (08/08/21) - I have edited this chapter slightly so that the abuse mentioned is committed directly by the Dursleys rather than an extra person. Because of this I have changed it from sexual abuse to physical abuse as I personally felt this was a more likely scenario with the Dursleys. I have adjusted the tags accordingly
Zabini’s question seemed to have opened the floodgates for sex-related questions. Which didn’t bode well for Harry.
“He’s a meercat. Which aren’t all that dissimilar from ferrets. Hence, you are most similar to Timon.”
Harry had intended to use this time to get his Charms essay finished. He’d done most of the work but it was by no means ready to be handed in. Pansy, however, had other ideas. He had just brought his books down to one of the tables in the common room early on Saturday morning when she appeared beside him out of thin air and suddenly announced:
He tried to leave their room as quietly as he could – he really didn’t want to deal with a snarky Malfoy at this obscene hour – and headed down to the common room. One of the perks of their space being just for Eighth years was that they had a miniature kitchen space in the corner. There were only really a couple of kettles and a machine for making coffee however for the students who had not grown up around muggle appliances, these were daunting enough to use. It had provided quite good entertainment for the muggle-borns and half-bloods on the first day watching all the purebloods attempt to figure out how to get the kettle to work.
Before Harry or Malfoy responded, the rest of their year group sat down at the table and the conversation was effectively ended.
“So how come you’re marrying a woman, then” Dean asked, causing all the Gryffindors to go quiet again and look at him.
Zabini seemed to be inspecting Harry’s face before he responded simply with, “I assume you know that I can’t say anything about what was revealed to anyone who was in the room”, before sparing a glance at Ron and Hermione.
Two hours later, Harry found himself walking around Hogsmeade with Pansy Parkinson. He already had a handful of bags of clothes, some of which Harry hadn’t even seen yet. He was pretty sure Pansy had bought some stuff for herself as well with his money and was now making him carry it around for her but he couldn’t bring himself to care.
didn’t bode well, Harry thought. Malfoy seemed to be nonchalantly leaning against the arm of their sofa, inspecting his nails. For reasons Harry couldn’t fathom, he found himself wondering which questions Malfoy had had to drink for.
As Defence was actually a subject Harry cared about, he got his parchment and quill out ready, just in case he needed to take notes. Whilst he had done some reading over the summer and would say that he was very confident in all the NEWT level content, he felt it was better safe than sorry. That and it was bound to make Hermione chastise Ron for not taking his own notes as well which was always amusing. Harry loved Ron but just like brothers, he also likes to wind him up and tease him.
The film continued mostly in silence (with the exception of a very audible gasp when Kiara suddenly said “You will NEVER be Mufasa” to Simba) until the final fight scene when the lions all realised that they were the same.
So Harry spoke. He spoke about how he had watched Draco in Sixth Year and his attempts to kill Dumbledore were half-hearted. That he was there in the Astronomy Tower that night, how Draco’s wand was lowering before the other Death Eaters came in, how Draco was no different than Harry other than the side of the war they were born on. He told them how Malfoy had the opportunity to give him up to Voldemort, knowing full well that it was Harry especially as he was with Ron and Hermione, and didn’t.
This caused the common room to burst into laughter, and Goldstein to turn bright red, and even Harry found himself chuckling despite himself.
The Eighth Year table went quiet as everyone waited to hear Hermione’s verdict on a party. It seemed everyone knew that if she agreed, then it was with good reason and they would be able to justify the party to McGonagall when she inevitably caught wind of it.
Just as Harry was about to reply, he saw Zabini enter the common room. He didn’t exactly know Zabini but he knew enough to know that Zabini would tell him straight what he revealed last night. He wouldn’t beat around the bush awkwardly. Without overthinking it anymore, Harry caught the boy’s eye and gestured for him to come over to their corner.
“Fine. But no students from other year groups because I know no matter what I say, there’ll be drinking and the last thing we need is McGonagall getting annoyed at us because we’ve enabled underaged students to get drunk.”
This led to the birth of the Eighth Year of Hogwarts which, in short, was the same as being in Seventh Year but with extra freedom and other perks such as having their own individual common room and only having to share a dorm with one other person. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, he had been paired with...
The first week of term had passed and Harry didn’t think he had exchanged any words with Malfoy other than the occasional Thank You after receiving a cup of tea or a terse ‘Yes’ in response to whether their homework was due that day. It was easy yet Harry found himself strangely missing their childish bickering. So many things had changed lately that it would be nice if just one thing felt familiar and comforting, even if that ‘thing’ was daily arguments and fights.
As soon as the credits began, the room erupted into chatter with those who had grown up away from the muggle-world asking how the muggles had made the film without magic. Dean, Hermione and some of the others did their best to explain how the animation process worked although their explanations weren’t anything more than its lots of drawings one after the other.
Harry realised that sometimes whilst he was talking he had started crying. He wiped the tears as best he could with the heel of his hand. “Great,” he muttered “now I’m blubbering like an idiot. I’m sorry guys I didn’t mean to get like this.”
As Malfoy was taking him up the stairs, Harry thought how soft Malfoy’s hair looked. It looked much nicer when Malfoy didn’t coat it in product. Was Malfoy growing it out? It was almost at his shoulders. He could probably plait it.
Whilst Harry had been surveying everyone else in the room, it seemed Hermione and Ron had gone off to bed. At least, Harry thought, he wouldn’t have to keep ignoring  ‘Mione’s disappointed glances in his direction. The others seemed to have realised, too, that this meant they were free to tease Harry without getting told off by ‘mini Minnie’.
’? What had Harry said? He remembered the beginnings of the game of Never Have I Ever although he didn’t remember anything after Hermione and Ron left the room.
Harry quite liked silence. He was good at being alone in his head with his thoughts. Unfortunately, those thoughts were all currently centred around one Draco Malfoy. One Draco Malfoy who looks much taller than he remembered. Harry himself was 5’6 (5’7 at a push) but he had thought Draco was only around 5’9. Now he looked slightly taller than Ron who’s like 6’2.
the hottest of the men. He has the rugged look going on. That bad boy turned good persona. And the dark hair…well mane, with the green eyes is a winning combination.” Parvati was saying to Seamus’ shaking head.
“When did you expect, Goldstein” drawled Malfoy. “Potter was hardly going to be shagging someone in a public place whilst being hunted down by a psychopathic murderer. We all know Potter has a death wish but I doubt even he would want to be found by Voldemort whilst he was rimming some random person’s arse.”
The room went silent. Nobody else had drunk, so all eyes were on Harry. Fortunately for Harry, he was so drunk that he wouldn’t remember any of this by the morning. Unfortunately for Harry, nobody else was as drunk as him so they
The pounding got infinitely worse when suddenly a loud voice that was far too cheerful sounded from his right.
He spoke so quietly, Malfoy barely heard what he said. When he realised what Harry was referring to and bitterly said “yes well
“Potter, you look as if you’ve been letting a first-year practice shrinking and enlarging charms on you. I think some of your clothes would fit a hippogriff they’re so large.”
Harry opened his mouth but then closed it again, unsure what to say. This seemed to satisfy Malfoy who let out a quiet laugh almost without realising what he was doing. They sat there in silence for what felt like years before Harry eventually decided to take advantage of their room being empty and went to get dressed.
“No, I just have the sudden urge to go to Madam Puddifoot’s Tea Shop. Yes of course it’s about the party. Honestly, thank Merlin you weren’t placed in Ravenclaw. You wouldn’t have even been able to get into their Common Room.
He felt Malfoy’s gaze on him and tried to find something to pay attention to until he looked away. Eventually, he felt that gaze subside and heard a quiet “Thank you”. Harry snuck a glance at Malfoy and saw that he was engrossed in a book. Harry tried to read the cover but all he saw was the word ‘Potions’ before the book shut and the blonde boy was looking at him again.
By lunchtime on Saturday, Harry was already exhausted as a result of both trying to keep up with a determined Pansy at 10 in the morning and then his brain working overtime trying to figure out what he should do. All he had concluded was that he would quite like to skip out on going to the party altogether, but seeing as he had promised to talk to the house-elves about providing food, he didn’t feel not attending was an option. Definitely not if Parkinson had any say in the matter.
Pansy’s words stuck with Harry for the rest of the morning. He knew Ron and Hermione would be supportive so telling them wouldn’t be an issue. But he also knew that if he didn’t tell anyone, there was less of a chance of the Daily Prophet finding out and all of this blowing up in his face. That and he just knew Hermione would try and force him to read some weird book about ‘Safe Sex for Homosexuals’ or ‘The History of Being Gay in the Wizarding World’, which if he was honest, wasn’t something that excited him. He knew enough protective charms to prevent the former from being an issue and for the latter, well, he had already read about Dumbledore and Grindelwald in that awful book by Rita Skeeter and if he was honest that had been all the reading he ever wanted to do about random old gay people in his lifetime.
“Yes because helping the Saviour of the wizarding world would definitely be the worst thing I’ve ever done. Not trying to sacrifice him to mean old snake-face”
When Harry headed down to breakfast the next morning, he was under the impression that he had a free period today until lunch. What he wasn’t expecting when he got down to the Great Hall was McGonagall telling all the 8
“That you’re gay. Or at least not straight anyway. You could be bi or pan or- but anyway the point is I know and I’m guessing that none of your friends do. I know we haven’t exactly had the best relationship but I’ve been through all of the crappy awkward coming out before and if you ever need anyone to talk to about it, I would be happy to.”
Harry headed over and put the kettle on. Mrs Weasley used to give them cups of hot chocolate and tea during the summer when they got particularly weighted down by their memories of the past year and Harry liked the wave of calm he felt whilst sitting there sipping from his mug, even if it was only momentary.
He was just attempting to decide what he should wear (something that was immensely difficult when you suddenly had double the number of clothes) when he heard a knock at the door followed by a sharp “Potter have you managed to dress yourself yet?”
He thought some more and realised that without really realising it, most of the spells he had cast over the past few months had been non-verbal and sometimes wandless. He had spent so much time in Muggle areas like clubs that he hadn’t even stopped to think about taking his wand out often. He knew that that was something that took most wizards many years to master. Even he had struggled with it in his sixth year. He remembered the torturous lesson with Snape and suppressed a shudder. He knew that his time without a wand had helped him harness his abilities, but he hadn’t realised quite how much. He added ‘
“I’m not saying that - I’m just highlighting that just because the hat sorted you into a house doesn’t mean you only have the traits of that house. McGonagall wants to promote inter-house unity.”
I will be updating the tags as I go but have currently included ones I know will definitely apply at some point.
“That? Don’t worry about it mate. Truth be told, summer was so crazy and we were all trying to deal with our own grief and emotions as best we could that it’s hardly surprising that we don’t know every little thing the other did. We’re never gonna be mad at you for keeping secrets from us. Just so long as you know there’s nothing you feel you
The rest of lunch passed without Harry having to talk to Malfoy or any of the other Slytherins although now instead of just thinking about Malfoy’s hands, his brain was stuck on ‘foreplay with Malfoy’ which didn’t bode well for Harry’s attempts to forget about the blonde git.
“No I’m not putting a skirt on you, Potter. Not yet anyway although thank you for the good suggestion. No, we need to get you some new clothes because, to be honest, you dress worse than a homeless person.”
“Show us them” somebody shouted. Seamus’ was a small shamrock on his arm that he apparently got whilst drunk after an Irish quidditch match. Parvati had a tattoo of a lotus flower on her back. Harry didn’t really want to show everyone his tattoos. Over the summer, he had amassed quite a collection; the Canis Major constellation for Sirius, a tattoo of the moon for Remus that changed to show the size of the moon at that moment, a stag surrounded by lilies for his parents and many others either representing people he has lost or completely random designs that he just thought looked decent at the time.
It was agreed that the party would take place on Saturday night. That way, they had all of Saturday to get any homework done and Sunday to nurse any hangovers.
They wandered over and sat by Neville who chatting to Dean about something he had read in a Herbology book. Dean didn’t look particularly interested in the conversation topic, but it was clear that he was doing his best to make Neville happy. They both smiled when they saw the trio and started asking what each of their new roommates were like. Hermione was sharing with Pansy Parkinson, Neville was with Michael Corner from Ravenclaw and Dean was with sharing with Goyle.
“But I was there. I was obviously in the room given I said whatever it was I said. So you can tell me right?” Harry stared at Zabini imploringly and Zabini stared right back.
“Who says I did this for you? Maybe I just wanted you to get to fully experience the shitshow that will happen when you appear in public after all of your drunken admissions. Besides, it wouldn’t look good for me if I left you stumbling around sicking up on every available surface. People would say I poisoned you in your sleep and my public image can't take that blow.”
Harry hadn’t been there long when somebody suggested that they play some drinking games. This was met with varying levels of agreement however they ultimately decided that it would be a good idea for helping everyone relax and force some ‘inter-house bonding’. Harry zoned out during the discussion of what game they should play, instead deciding to occupy himself with getting a large glass of firewhiskey. No matter what they chose, he had a feeling that he wouldn’t willingly play unless his inhibitions had already been lowered by some alcohol. Apparently, they had settled on never have I ever and were already starting to arrange themselves in a circle. Harry took the nearest armchair and only when he looked up did, he realise that he was sat directly opposite Malfoy who was flanked on a 3-seater sofa but Pansy and Zabini.
By Friday morning breakfast, Harry started to regret wishing that this year would become more exciting when Pansy decided to suggest a party
“I take it from the conversation I walked in on earlier that you talked to Granger and Weasel about-”
for us. You want us to sit around plaiting each other’s hair and telling each other about the people we have crushes on?
Harry saw that whilst Malfoy looked grown up like an adult, he was still the same child who got scared in detention in the Forbidden Forest in their First Year and ran away screaming with Fang.
Before Harry knew what he was doing, he was grabbing the second mug out of the cupboard and getting started with making the drinks. He silently went and placed Malfoy’s mug in front of the blonde boy before going over to one of the leather 2-seater sofas near the fireplace.
At this, all the Gryffindors turned to look at Draco who was currently finding the wall behind Harry’s head incredibly fascinating.
Ron just kept staring at the oval-shaped scar left behind after Harry and Hermione went to Godric’s Hollow. After Ron had left them.
“You don’t want to deal with the questions from your friends, especially around how and why we started talking in the first place.”
Zabini walked over slowly, his face trying to hide his confusion behind a façade of nonchalance. “Good morning Potter & Co, to what do I owe the pleasure?”
Harry supposed that she was still struggling after the war. For a long time, nobody knew what had happened to her after her attack. Some people speculated that she had died whereas some said she was fine but had moved abroad. When she had come back to school, it had caused quite a stir but nobody asked her about it so Harry never really found out what happened.
Malfoy was just about to retort when Pansy threw a cushion across at both of them and the glare they received shut them up instantly.
Harry decided it was his turn to go. At least then he wouldn’t have to drink. Eventually, he came up with “Never have I ever called somebody the wrong name whilst hooking up.”
Harry laughed despite himself and Malfoy looked almost surprised that his comment had gotten a positive response from Harry and hadn’t angered him. “She wishes I spent that much time with a book.”
Draco sat down at the Eighth Year dinner table. Unfortunately, on the opposite side of the table was one Harry Potter who was currently staring Draco down with the his incredibly bright green eyes. Draco did his best to ignore this and turned to Pansy who was sat next to him.
“Draco Bloody Malfoy! McGonagall put you with Malfoy! Doesn’t she know you’re a war hero? You deserve better than this! And I thought getting put with Zabini was bad...”
Suddenly feeling self-conscious about walking around the room in his pyjamas and grabbed a jumper from the end of his bed. As he pulled it on, he realised it was one that Andromeda had leant him when he had gone to visit Teddy during the summer.
Harry gulped and then snapped his head back up, hoping neither of his friends had noticed him staring at the blonde but they were still talking about McGonagall’s motives behind the dorm pairings.
Zabini and Pansy were both talking to each other secretively in low voices, glancing around the circle every now and then. They both suddenly were looking at Harry and smirking.
Somebody dimmed the lights and whilst the trailers were playing, Harry found himself thoroughly enjoying the domesticity. It felt like he was part of a giant, albeit incredibly dysfunctional, family. He was even sharing a blanket with Malfoy although ‘sharing’ would be a stretch as Harry had a tiny corner and Malfoy had the rest completely covering himself.
“I would ask what you mean by people knowing without you telling them but Merlin it feels wrong to ask you about it when you’re clearly drunk and have no filter. You’re not even going to remember any of this in the morning. Go to sleep, Potter.”
His “errrmmm” in response was enough for Pansy to fling the door open and start critiquing the options he had laid out on his bed, occasionally muttering something like ‘you really are blind’ and ‘I’m surprised you can get dressed in a morning’. Eventually, once she had decided that he looked the perfect balance between looking effortless and put together (which was a simple pair of tight-in-the-right-places black jeans and a loose dark green shirt with one too few buttons done up for his liking), she ‘gave him permission to go down to the party.
“Yes, thank you, Potter. I get it, you don’t have to keep giving me more reasons. I suppose you’re quite like the squeaky girl lion.”
“Okay let’s just keep going everyone.” Hermione interjected, clearly trying to get her evening of ‘inter-house unity’ back on track.
“It used to be all the time although I guess when I started Hogwarts it was only in the summer. I wouldn’t have even known half of it was abuse if it wasn’t for the mind healer I had to see after the war. Did you know that some abuse isn’t physical? Apparently I was also emotionally abused. Most the time it wasn’t that bad. It was worse when you gave a reaction so I suppose after a while I just got numb to it. A couple of times when it was really bad I passed out from the pain, you know. I don’t even remember all of it. I would just wake up with a new injury.”
And once again, it was Harry who broke first. “Thanks again for the potion this morning, Malfoy. Today would have been ten times shittier without it.”
It was a couple of minutes before Pansy spoke up again; “Don’t worry, Potter. I’m not about to go shouting from the rooftops that I spent the morning on a shopping trip with you. As far as my friends and anyone else is concerned, I was on a date this morning with a girl I met over the summer and you were, well, you can say what you like. I don’t mind that you don’t want to broadcast that you’ve spent time with me.”
Harry is expecting more silence so is surprised when Malfoy speaks next. “Have you ever told anyone before tonight?”
A couple more rounds passed where Harry had to reveal that he had, in fact, had a threesome, had sex with somebody he didn’t find attractive at all because he wanted to get laid
“It’ll be good for everyone to let loose a bit. Think about something other than schoolwork or” she paused awkwardly “last year”
He supposed he was right. He didn’t know the first thing about dating. He wasn’t sure he ever had. Ginny and him never dated properly cause the war kind of eliminated the possibility of popping into Madam Puddifoot’s Tea Shop.
Draco simply raised an eyebrow at her as if to say ‘there are never going to be any juicy details in that relationship.
This didn’t stop Harry from reaching a hand out to see whether Malfoy’s hair was actually as soft as it looked. This turned out to be handy as when Malfoy suddenly seemed to lurch forwards, Harry gripped onto his hair tightly in an effort to hold on. After Malfoy had regained his balance, he cleared his throat slightly. If Harry could see Malfoy’s face, he would have noticed that Malfoy’s cheeks were slightly flushed. But he couldn’t.
“Finnegan I’m pretty sure even the muggles in Australia are aware that you and Thomas are shagging. No not you either, Weasley. You and Granger are pretty obviously together as well. I think what we need is some juicy gossip. Someone we don’t already know about like…Potter.”
Harry searched her face for a second and upon realising that Pansy was more stubborn than Hermione and Ron combined, gave in:
Harry forced his aching body to move, ignoring its protests that it would throw up any second, and found the bottle. He quickly downed the potion and layback whilst he felt it take effect. He let out a small groan before moving to sit fully upright.
As a result, Harry was forced to sit through lunch hearing about a party he didn’t want to attend and eating lots of food so he had enough energy to even be awake for said party.
“Well, we know you and the she-weasel broke up. I’m pretty sure everyone in within Wizarding Britain knows that. Merlin knows the Daily Prophet went on about it for a solid month. Although I suppose what with you eradicating all evil from the world, you have rather cruelly robbed them of all news-worthy stories so it really is the least you could do.”
Malfoy looked up at him briefly before carrying on attempting to move the sofa by himself. “Does it look like I need your help?”., Harry regarded him for a moment before responding. “Do you really want me to answer that or would you like to maintain plausible deniability for later?” Malfoy stopped pushing again and leant against the sofa in his effortless nonchalance that Harry always envied him for. “My, my. Big words, Potter. Does Granger know you’ve been eating her books?”
Pansy didn’t say anything else in response to Malfoy but Harry couldn’t help feeling that even though she hadn’t had the last word, she had definitely won that ‘argument’.
And he was actually succeeding so far. His first lesson of the day was Herbology and he managed to stay focused on what Professor Sprout was talking about for the entire lesson. However, after Herbology was Defence Against the Dark Arts…. with Malfoy.
By the time Harry walked up to Charms, all he could feel was relief that this lesson would be Malfoy free.
From what Harry had heard, Lavender and Padma were convinced that Ginny Weasley would hook up with Pansy but end up with Luna, Neville would either get together with Hannah or Zabini; Padma thought Hannah whereas Lavender thought Zabini (Anthony thought that Nott was a contender however the girls dismissed this saying that Nott and Neville wouldn’t be compatible).
He sat down at the Eighth Year table before almost bursting out laughing. He had just run away from the classroom because of Malfoys
In the end only Justin, Susan and Malfoy drank. When Susan drunk, Terry Boot began to look very awkward and once again, Zabini and Pansy were smirking and whispering to each other, probably about whoever's name Draco accidentally said.
At this point Pansy perked up. “Yes dark messy hair and green eyes is a very attractive combination. Wouldn’t you agree Draco?” She nudged Malfoy with her elbow and as he clearly hadn’t been paying any attention to their conversation simply replied “sure”. This seemed to be enough to satisfy Pansy although Harry couldn’t think for the life of him
“What was it I said last night that has everyone’s knickers in a twist? Everyone is looking at me as if I’m an alien and Ron and Hermione weren’t there so don’t know.”
“Maybe they’ve changed over the Summer,” Hermione suggested whilst pouring Ron a glass of pumpkin juice, not trusting him not to spill it over his jumper, “maybe they’ve grown up and stopped being such bullies.”
Hermione kept looking at Harry, trying to get him to join in the conversation but she only managed to get him to say a couple of words. When they got to the Great Hall, they noticed that another table had been added in addition to the usual 4 house tables and the staff table where the rest of the Eighth Years that were awake were sat.
badly, had sex within view of unsuspecting onlookers on purpose, slept with a married person (which in his defence, he only found out
“Well, if you ever meet these hypothetical men, please feel free to send them my way Potter. Now if that’s all, I’d rather like to stop discussing my love life or rather, lack-thereof.”
As Harry went down the stairs, he had a brief thought that it was strange how he hadn’t seen Malfoy getting ready before the party since they shared a room, but he just assumed that Malfoy didn’t want to go to the party or hadn’t bothered to change.
made a joke earlier that day about how the two characters they related to fell in love with each other.
Years that starting that morning, they would all have compulsory Muggle Studies workshops in order to help ‘break down prejudices’ and ‘bridge cultural divides’.
“Well raised to believe in the ‘bad side’. Given the next to impossible task of killing the older leader of the other side. Cocky in his skills especially when younger. He-“
There is implied childhood abuse in this chapter. The actual abuse isn't described but it is still there. If you don't want to read that bit then stop reading after "Harry hated the awkward silence so once again his brain provided him with a totally logical solution: just start talking." The chapter ends pretty soon after this so you don't miss anything important.
“This? These tears? They are not a weakness.” Hermione comforted, moving in closer to put her arm around him. “They show how strong you are and how strong you’ve been. And one day when you’re older, you’ll look back and know that you were strong enough to overcome what so many people wouldn’t be able to in their wildest dreams. What happened to you made you stronger.”
“Merlin help us, Potter has lost the plot completely. Should I contact St Mungos? I’m sure they’ll get a room with padded walls ready for you in no time.”
He looked over at Malfoy, the other drinker who hadn’t revealed their tattoos. Malfoy happened to look over at the same time as Harry and their eyes looked. Harry thought they exchanged a sort of ‘I’ll show mine if you show yours moment and he must have guessed correctly because then Malfoy was pulling back his sleeve.
He spoke on Narcissa’s behalf and the Wizengamot gave her 6months house arrest at the Manor. Harry was just about to leave the Ministry when he saw Draco, whose trial was next. He looked…not like a scared puppy because that made him seem weak. Harry thought he looked incredibly calm and composed. Almost too calm considering his father had just been sentenced to life in Azkaban. His posture was good, his hair was combed to perfection. Anyone who didn’t know him would say that he looked relaxed and confident about his trial.
He had half a mind to laugh at Pansy’s joke, however this did not feel like the time to encourage her any more.
It was just as Harry almost shouted this at Hermione that Malfoy walked in. He stopped in the doorway, clearly realising that he was interrupting an incredibly emotionally charged conversation.
Harry sat back down on his spot in between the 2 Slytherins on the sofa. He saw Ron throw him a pitiful glance but his and Hermione’s seat was cramped enough so Harry couldn’t move any closer to them. He turned his attention back to the screen where the sequel was just about to start.
When they got up there, they set to work moving all of the chairs and sofas into an arrangement that would allow everyone to see the temporarily conjured screen. When Harry walked in he saw Malfoy in the corner, trying to move one of the very large L-shaped leather sofas by himself. “Do you need a hand?”
“Oh c’mon Granger. Surely even you can see the benefits. Just tell yourself it’s for the purpose of ‘Inter-house bonding’ if that helps you sleep better.”
Almost as if they had sensed they were being spoken about, Pansy, Draco, Blaise, Greg and Theo Nott walked into the Great Hall, all laughing quite loudly but going silent as soon as they realised that they were being watched.
He’d teared up at the time when he saw the label had Lupin written on it in smudged ink. It was slightly too large for his short frame and had a couple of tiny holes in the cuffs but he felt comfort in it nonetheless. With the exception of the map, the cloak and the photo album from Hagrid, Harry didn’t really have any belongings to connect him to his parents and, whilst Remus isn’t a blood relative, he always acted like a father to Harry. Despite almost solely wearing hand-me-downs his entire life, Harry was glad for once that his clothes were preloved.
Harry grabbed his mug out of the cupboard and went to close it again before his eye caught sight of another mug with a large ‘D H’ on the side. Strangely, it was decorated identically to Harry’s own mug, just in a dark forest green shade but almost all the other mugs in the cupboard had their own unique pattern.
Whatever Harry was expecting, it wasn’t that. His mind felt like it was racing yet blank all at once. All he could do was ask a small “anything else?”
Harry quickly found the mug that belonged to him. It was a deep midnight blue and had gold enchanted snitch and quidditch brooms flying around with a large ‘H P’ on one side.
But what was there to fall in love with about Malfoy. Harry would admit that the bloke was good looking. He was tall, he had nice hair and there was something very attractive about how precise his jawline looked. He always looked impeccably dressed too but that didn’t mean Harry could ever fancy him. Anyone would look that good if they spent as much as Malfoy did on their clothes. And there was nothing about his personality that Harry would want in a partner. Malfoy was way too high maintenance and they would argue every single day. It’s not like there could ever be a spark there, Harry thought. He was just a fit bloke and Harry could appreciate good looks. He was just a fit bloke who shared a room with Harry and was currently lying only a couple of metres away from Harry.
Unfortunately, it was not Pansy free and no sooner had he sat down at his desk than she sat down right next to him.
Padma Patil went next and said, “Never have I ever gotten a tattoo.” Again, Harry had to drink (much to Ron and Hermione’s surprise) along with Parvati, Seamus, and Malfoy.
Incase anyone was curious, I've added a picture (I think...) of what I imagined Harry's shirt looked like. Except imagine more of a dark forest green. And with black jeans not whatever those shorts are...
Once he had mustered up his Gryffindor courage Harry told them. He told them about how confused he had been when he was younger because he thought people were supposed to care about their family. He told them about the pain and how he had woken up almost every day, until he turned 9, and cried as silently as he could because he was so scared of upsetting his uncle and it happening again. He told them about how some days he wished Voldemort would show up and kill him so that he didn’t have to spend any longer at the Dursleys. How he envied Cedric and then felt so sick with guilt
After the war, McGonagall decided to invite the old Seventh Years back to redo their final year after all they had been a small year group in the first place and with everything they’d been through in the past year she wanted to ensure they all had great futures in front of them and whilst potential employers would undoubtedly be sympathetic about their lack of NEWTS, she wanted to make sure they went into the world as not only able witches and wizards but also functioning humans in society and not the impulsive teenagers that they are at present.
When Harry listened back into the conversation on his other side, he realised that they too were discussing relationships. However, they hadn’t quite moved on from lions yet.
They spent the rest of the 10-minute break refreshing their drinks and running to the loo before sitting down to watch the sequel. Before they had watched the first film, when McGonagall had told them what they were watching and somebody else had mentioned that it was a kids film, the common room went into uproar. Harry noticed that clearly, the first film had won them over because nobody let out any complaints about having to watch the sequel.
“No,” Harry said, a little moody that Malfoy was being such a prick about his suggestion. “I just thought- you know what never mind what I thought.” Harry grabbed his wand and went to go meet Ron and Hermione before breakfast but just as he was walking through the door, he heard a voice.
didn’t want to go to a Hufflepuff orgy or want to see Cedric in that way. Fred and George had just nodded knowingly and left Harry to splutter. Harry still didn’t know how they had managed to realise that Harry had a crush on Cedric before Harry figured it out himself but if anyone was going to, it would have been those two.
Eventually, Harry won because Zabini said a quick “fine” before taking Harry over to a quieter part of the room.
At this point Ron was bright red, just staring at Harry whilst opening and closing his mouth like a deranged codfish.
Eventually, they reached their room and Malfoy deposited Harry onto his bed. Only then did Harry release his death grip on Malfoy’s hair.
Malfoy looked at him for a moment before replying, “I already told you, Potter, I didn’t do it to be kind. It was purely for my own self-interest.” He paused before adding, “although for both of our sakes, try to refrain from drinking that much again. I don’t want to waste all of my potion supplies on you and I daresay you didn’t benefit much from your inebriation either.”
He blamed the sheer amount of alcohol he had consumed thus far and the momentum of the game on the next question. Of course, he also blamed Roger Malone who asked the question. Either Hufflepuffs weren’t as friendly as he thought or Roger was just incredibly tone-deaf. Either way, it was this combination of things that led to Harry drinking after “Never have I ever been physically abused.”
“A Malfoy does not marry for love. And given the events of last year…it’s a miracle anyone wants to marry me at all and so I have to accept anyone willing, whatever their gender.” Malfoy turned back to his food. He was really in the mood to have a long discussion about his future platonic-marriage. He half hoped that the Gryffindors would go back to having their own conversations about whatever it was they talked about, and ignore the Slytherins. But when was Malfoy ever that lucky.
Draco was a different matter. Harry had spoken at his trial back in July. He’d heard that Narcissa Malfoy was on trial and had wanted to go and speak on her behalf, even if the motive behind her actions was just wanting to find Draco and not actually to save Harry. Ron and Hermione didn’t think it was a good idea for him to go but told him that it was his choice. "Of course", Harry told them, he wasn’t going to go, but then changed his mind at the last minute on the day of the trial.
“Sleakeazy. It’s a potion for your hair, Merlin knows you need it. Invented by your grandfather if I’m not mistaken, so it should be able to combat even your unruly hair. After all, it probably was what the potion was designed for.”
When Harry awoke the next morning, he saw that Malfoy’s bed was already empty. Assuming that he was already gone from the dorm. However, Harry was wrong. He realised this when two moments later a dripping wet Draco Malfoy walked out of the bathroom towards his side of the room. Harry made a slight noise when he saw Malfoy which caused the blond git’s head to snap over in Harry’s direction, realising that he was now awake. Neither said anything for a few moments.
Although Harry hadn’t seen who else had drunk, from the fact that most of the reactions seemed to be about him he guessed it wasn’t many others or at least nobody surprising.
“Don’t strain yourself thinking this early in the morning, Potter. I can hear you below-average sized brain whirring away from here.”
Eventually, Harry ended up with a pair of glasses that looked almost identical to his original pair. He hated to admit it but Pansy was right. Wizarding glasses were simply better. The lenses were self-repairing, which would have been handy countless times over the past few years. The lenses were also ‘smudge resistant’ which, to quote Pansy, would “Stop you looking like unsightly grease-ball and more like a functioning member of wizarding society”. Harry wasn’t convinced that a few fingerprint marks had an impact on his ability to function but he decided not to push it if he wanted to make it back to the castle anytime soon.
Harry’s thoughts troubled him all the way back to their new Eighth Year common room and then up to his room. Luckily for him, Malfoy was nowhere to be seen, allowing Harry to get ready for bed and have an early night. Today had been exhausting and they hadn’t even had any classes yet. How he was going to get through a whole year, Harry had no idea
“I’m aware that many of you spent the past year or more fighting in a war and will have defence skills that students taking their NEWTS under normal circumstances could only dream of. One or two of you could probably just do my job for me and teach the rest of your peers. But just because you’ve gotten proficient with jinxes the past year, you might not be as quick and powerful when it comes to shield charms or vice versa. Some of you might be great at understanding the theory, but struggle to put those ideas into practice. My job for the next year is to make sure you’re all talented at all aspects of the DADA curriculum and for some of you, beyond the curriculum. I’m aware that your study of this subject over the past 7 years has been disjointed and, to put it bluntly, downright crap in some areas.” She let out a small chuckle under her breath and continued. “Whilst I know that one more year with another new teacher isn’t going to stop your education from being disjointed, I’m relying on you all working with each other as well to make this year go as smoothly as possibly. Think of me more as a guide to help you target the areas that you as a collective but also you as an individual think you need the most work on. With that said, I am now going to give you your first task; write down on a piece of scrap parchment your name, a specific topic, spell or area of the course you feel the most confident in and the one which you feel the least confident in. Once you’ve done that, leave them at the end of your desk and I’ll collect them all from you at the end of the lesson.”
Harry knew it was bad to judge a book by its cover, but he was surprised when he saw their new teacher walk into the room. She looked so young Harry thought she could have passed as another Weasley child.
They’d both accompanied him up to his room and were lounging in his bed when he finally came to the decision that he would tell them. Malfoy wasn’t in there and Harry hadn’t seen him since this morning so he doubted he would show up in the next 10 minutes.
Throughout the rest of the day, Harry had noticed the effects of their film morning bonding. In Charms, almost half the pairs were now made up of students in different houses and in Herbology everyone seemed much more ready to help each other out.
Harry was dreading whatever it was McGonagall had planned. The last thing he wanted to do was spend the morning playing monopoly whilst most of his year group still stared at him like he was made of fine china. He was surprised to find that he didn’t actually hate what she had planned for that day: watching movies. 8 years in the Wizarding World and Harry still found it funny how excited people who only knew the wizarding world got when watching something on TV or a film. He wasn’t quite convinced by McGonagall’s choice of the Lion King. He vaguely recalled when it came out a couple of years before and all he knew was that it was a film for kids. Not for a bunch of seventeen-and-eighteen-year-olds.
“Never have I ever received a lap dance.” Harry drank, although his memory about that evening was foggy.
“Ha ha, Malfoy. With quips like that, you should pursue a career in comedy. That is, if being an enormous git doesn’t work out for you.” Harry shot back. He had missed their sarcastic jibes this term mostly. He didn’t mind trying to be friendly to Malfoy but it was nice to feel like some things hadn’t changed.
I wish I could say it will be lighthearted from here on out but knowing me it probably won't be. BUT if all goes according to plan, the angsty bits should be 15% of the fic at most. Hopefully, this is the last of the angsty sad content for a while.
“No”, Zabini replied softly. “It was just that. Everyone was ready to murder Roger after he asked, you went to bed and Pansy made everyone magically swear not to mention it to anyone else outside the room. Nothing else was said other than the fact it happened.”
He hurried over and took his seat. There was still a few more minutes until the lesson actually began (a point which Ron was grumbling about) so the rest of their class was still trickling in slowly. There was also no sign of their teacher so far.
“What’s pathetic,” drawled Malfoy, “is that you seem to think that having had a hangover is some sort of achievement or sign of maturity. Some of us adults can actually hold our liquor.”
Ahhh my life is so hectic I’m barely managing to squeeze out these tiny chapters. I keep meaning to write some in advance but I never have time. Sorry these updates are tiny
They both laughed before settling into a strangely comfortable silence. Harry was surprised at how easy it was to joke with Pansy. She had always seemed like the sort of person who could give but not receive insults and would be insulted the instant somebody insinuated something negative about her. It was a pleasant contrast to the somewhat sad and disappointed looks he received from Hermione when he was particularly sarcastic. He loved Hermione but she wasn’t always the best at taking jokes, especially around sensitive subject matters like the war.
Harry did not enjoy shopping with a purpose as it was so shopping with a purposeful Pansy Parkinson was his idea of hell.
. What alternate universe was he living in? He knew he had always been hyper-aware of Malfoy but that generally tended to be surrounding any possible nefarious plots or evil schemes, not because Harry thought he had nice hands.
Harry almost choked on his pumpkin juice at that, which caused Malfoy to mutter “how dignified” under his breath, and spluttered out; “there’s no foreplay going on.”
Once breakfast had finished, the Eighth years all headed back to their common room to set up the VHS tape with varying degrees of excitement.
“No.” Harry replied quickly. Had it been too quickly? He didn’t want her to think that he was trying to hide something, but Pansy looked at him for a second and didn’t say anything else.
The other year groups would be arriving tomorrow, and Harry wanted to make sure he was awake early enough to enjoy some peace and quiet in the castle before they got here.
If Harry had felt nervous fighting Voldemort, it was nothing compared to the chill that ran through his bones when he was under Pansy’s watchful gaze.
In terms of timeline, Simba’s Pride was released on VHS on October 1998 which is a month later than this scene occurs. For the sake of my fic let's all just assume it came out a few months earlier. Cool? Cool.
Harry raised his heavy eyelids halfway open only for them to shut again. He furrowed his brow and curled in on himself, this new position somehow soothing the nausea.
“Maybe they weren’t when you were 11 but now you’re 18. They’re probably not even the right prescription. And, as uncouth as it is to mention nowadays in polite company, they’re muggle made and simply not as good as wizarding glasses.”
If they managed to keep it up throughout the year, Harry thought he might actually pass his NEWTS with grades higher than a T. He was sure that Malfoy being a poncy git in their lessons had to account for at least 12% of his poor grades, in potions especially. All he wanted was to get through the year with as few life-changing events as possible. But then again, when was Harry’s life ever peaceful….
“Which is that by putting Harry and Draco, two people known for feuding with each other since they arrived at this school, in the same dorm and they are able to be amicable with one another then it will set a good example for the rest of the school.” Hermione interrupted, walking down the stairs that led to the girls' dorms. “I think that after everything we went through during the war it is important not to make enemies over trivial manners such as what house you belong to. We’re not that different from each other. After all, Harry was almost a Slytherin and I could have been a Ravenclaw”
He decided he would wait a few weeks, at least until the novelty of his being back at Hogwarts had worn off for the younger years and they no longer desired to keep within a 50-metre radius of him at all times, listening in to his every conversation.
That Draco Malfoy saved his life, despite putting himself at risk by doing so and that without him, the war might have ended a very different way.
