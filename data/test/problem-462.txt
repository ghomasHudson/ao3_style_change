“They’ve got a special way of finding us,” Harry says. “Something about trained owls that only need to recognize our magical signatures to find us. I think if they wanted to reach me they would have by now.”
Harry doesn’t know what to say so he nods, and then looks for Draco, but can’t seem to him in the slightly crowded living room.
"Let me try," Malfoy said, pushing away from the rail and advancing towards him.
“Pictures of what?”
Harry thought he was having the worst day yet, and he had defeated a dark wizard in his life time.
“Haha, Malfoy. It’s for Fleur.”
"What?" he exclaimed. "It's not my fault Harry suddenly lost his mind!"
“Of course.”
“Pansy’s not celebrating Christmas,” Draco says, thumb moving almost rudely over the lip of the glass bottle in his hand. “That’s why she’s not here. She’s seeing someone new. They’re Muslim, or something.”
Harry slumped onto his side as they both stared at the ceiling and struggled to catch their breaths.
“He made it then?”
“So,” Harry sucks in a deep breath. “So it smells like cinnamon and I’m sure your lips taste like hot chocolate and firewhisky, and I want to make sure. Just in case.”
And it’s so fucking quiet, Harry thinks. He hadn’t noticed how quiet it could be in a small building like this until Malfoy’d gone out, and now he’s left alone with nothing but the occasional sound of creaking floorboards. He’s half-tempted to switch on the radio again, just to having something fill the void.
“Oh,” Harry looks behind Hermione’s shoulders but he can’t see much. “You would see what I got you.”
Harry almost started sobbing. "But I've watched them all."
“Oh?”
“Because you want to. You thought of it too.”
Outdated, but it works just as fine as Malfoy jumps from channels before finding what seems to be the right one.
Malfoy has his head resting on Harry’s side, though he doesn’t stir when Harry slips out of his bed. He slides on his pants, and shirt, and opens the window.
“I am,” Malfoy holds out his camera. “I took one of you.”
She laughs. “What? No. A bunch of us are wrapping presents at our flat. I thought you would like to join.”
Harry may or may not have used some of his wandless magic to prop a teenager up as he almost slips, hanging on to the edge of the wall with weak, pale fingers.
But he’s standing in a flat somewhere far away, where it’s cold and only warm when Malfoy is this close to kissing him.
“My place. I’ve got something to show you and I spent too long wrapping it up for you to say no.” Draco pauses, blushes, running his thumb over Harry’s hand. “Unless you want to say no. Which is perfectly acceptable.”
It is dark out, and bloody cold. A slight detail Harry hadn’t thought of thoroughly as he’d thrust on his simple coat over his auror robes.
Harry held his breath. "There's no need to bother. Really."
Harry turns and Malfoy’s holding a stack of pictures in his hands. “Tiananmen Square. Only a few months ago.”
"You what?" harry asked.
“I’m sure it has been,” Harry says.
The only items personalized are Malfoy’s photos, and when they both cast Lumos, the images are the first thing Harry can see. Here, Malfoy hardly hides the magical photos. They hang from frames, and the films hang from clothing lines along his kitchen.
His eyes fly open, and he sits up perhaps a little to hastily.
Malfoy laughs. “You don’t have to. Circe. I should have taken a shot of that.”
“Yes. I suppose I understand what you mean,” Harry says. “There’s something more electrifying about the wall more than. Well. The Square was horrific. Hardly any of the aurors made a difference. It was all so last minute, and awfully difficult to access the international portkey.”
“Good for you, mate.”
Malfoy’s fingers left his hair entirely. “Perhaps it’s not meant to be. Would you still like the potion? I could owl another one to you. I have plenty at home.”
Malfoy’s hands still over the wrapping paper he’s just pulled out from nowhere. “What?”
“I’ll see you around,” Harry whispers, running his fingers through Malfoy’s hair just in case this is the last time.
“Fuck, Malfoy,” Harry turns away and runs his fingers through his hair.
“Oh,” Harry says, and he’s certain there’s a furious blush of color on his cheeks.
"What did I do?" Ron protested, looking at him with his wide eyes.
"I'm relatively experienced with hair, Potter. Let me try."
“Pansy Parkinson,” Harry looks up, and their eyes meet for a moment before Harry’s magic almost slips from him, and he continues to a tie bow around the ball before he allows it to roll under the tree, a tag with Teddy’s name on it secured at the top.
Harry watches Ron disappear into the kitchen, perhaps looking for Hermione. Harry tries to lift the ball with his wand but it seems to resist any sort of magic, so Harry holds it between his hands and wills it to remain in its form. However, the moment Harry’s grabbed a sheet of wrapping paper, the ball transforms into a pair of scissors.
“Merlin, I should have had another drink.”
His long finger touches the line of Harry’s cheekbone, traces it back and forth. “It’s a little faltering here. I think you should maybe touch it up a little.”
“Yes, I haven’t had the chance to climb over the wall yet.”
“You do always find a way to get what you want, Potter.”
“Hey, Ron,” Harry smiles, picks up the ball. It turns into a mistletoe, Harry lets it go before anyone can say anything.
"The video of Malfoy, and his stupid hair, and his stupid voice."
"Jealous, Malfoy?"
They are nude, or partially nude, and some lean against surfaces as Harry had leaned against Malfoy’s window.
Harry winced. "I hate you."
They stand looking through the pictures Malfoy had taken, and he shows Harry some he took on magical film, and the tanks that had rolled through the streets as though monsters from a low-budget horror flick.
Hermione rolled her eyes. "Is this about the video? I knew I shouldn't have sent it to Ginny. I just thought that one braid would look really good on her hair."
They share a half-laugh. Harry is half-suspicious the hot chocolate’s been spiked.
Harry closes his eyes, and he thinks of kissing Cho or Ginny. He thinks of what Hermione would say, or what Luna would say, having both been terrified over something the Malfoys had done to them.
“More than.”
Harry finds himself smiling, and then Malfoy pulls out a spare set of covers and pillow, and he lays them over the bare couch facing his fireplace. “This should do, I believe.”
“I heard you’d gone away,” Harry squares his shoulders. “I hadn’t known you’d ventured onto the wrong side of things twice in a life-time.”
“Don’t be silly,” she waves her hand. “I promise I won’t look. Besides, you can leave those behind and work on some others. We just thought it would be less lonely.”
“Oh, thank Merlin,” he hears Ron say from somewhere behind him.
"And," Harry says, feeling comforted by the thought that she may not be listening, "I still don't know. Sometimes I think of the things he said to me about my parents, and to Ron and Hermione, and I just feel so angry."
Harry marks the next few days by Malfoy's take out requests. Malfoy asks for caesar salad with grilled shrimp and garlic bread, he's craving pan roasted fish with romesco sauce and steamed broccoli, he wants fruit salad but without any melon or grapes, he's dying for crepes with comte and jammy red onions. Harry goes all over the city, sometimes to two or three restaurants to patch together Malfoy's requests. It passes the time.
Harry wanted to be at his side. He wanted to be the other father, raising their baby together. They mightn’t ever be a couple, but Draco thought he could get used to that, given time. Having Harry in their lives was everything. “I’ve got another appointment with Mediwitch Hayes in a fortnight,” Draco found himself saying. “You said you wanted to tag along?”
She took measurements and Draco’s weight, and pronounced herself happy with everything that she saw. “As far as I’m concerned, you’re having a textbook pregnancy,” Hayes told Draco, smiling. “And how are your energy levels? Did you find the Energy Extension Elixir helped with those?”
alright. He didn't need Harry. Draco had money in his vault, he had family and friends who would help him, and most importantly, he was enough. He would love their baby enough for the two of them.
"It's similar to a croissant but it's been laminated with butter and sugar and the sugar caramelizes as it bakes."
“You’d curse our poor child to a Hufflepuff fate before they were even born?” Draco quipped in reply, looking down at the collection that Harry had already amassed. “I’d have thought that you’d be burgundy and gold all the way.”
"Go ahead."
Malfoy turns to look at Harry with an expression like he's going to say no, then his eyes sweep the kitchen, the several bowls and books, the butter and flour and cranberries and cucumbers and jars waiting on the counter. "I—yes. Slice the crusts off the bread?"
-hell,” Draco growled, trying to pull on the slate-grey trousers he been wearing previously, and realising, with a sinking heart, that Sticking Charm on them had broken. Worse, he didn’t have his wand! He’d left it in the kitchen where he’d used it to brew their tea. There was nothing for it. Draco made for the door, and gave Harry a shout. Fuckity-fuck-
"Er, I like the donuts Sadie brings on Friday's," Harry says, a smile creeping onto his face. He really does hate it, doesn't he? He hates the intense stress and the endless hours and being one of two brown people in the whole department.
“You want to be bonded?” Draco asked, the scepticism of his question curdling Harry’s confession. “You want courting gifts and matching bloody robes, and Lucius – you rememeber, the convicted Death Eater, the man who tried to have you killed – for a Father-in-Law? You want the handfasting spell and our magic woven together for the rest of our lives?”
"Mate, I've eaten three," Ron says.
"You're very judgmental about egg whites."
Should he wake Harry by going down on him? For a second, Draco through that’d be sexy, and he had half-crawled under the quilt before he changed his mind. Draco liked a hot shower after sex, and possibly Harry felt the same.
"Ah! Look at this one!" Malfoy starts cackling, "The flexing muscles! I can't even!" he wheezes out between bouts of laughter.
Somewhere in his twenty-four years, Draco had dismissed kissing as a childish, teenage thing; something to be done and dispersed with as part of foreplay. He swore that he’d never be that closed-minded, not ever again. Kissing – with Harry, anyway – deserved his attention and plenty of devoted practice. It deserved to be enjoyed for its own sake.
"Leave me alone. I've never had sushi before."
Malfoy bends down and scoops up the shaggy mess of fur and coos—actually coos—"Silence, wretched creature," while Harry watches agog, realizing his jaw has dropped.
Harry is surprised Malfoy likes something as tender as hand holding but then again, based on the way he kissed Harry last night, Harry might need to reconsider his expectations about Malfoy and tenderness. Malfoy's hand is warm and dry and every once in a while he rubs his thumb across the back of Harry's hand. Harry scoots a little closer.
He gave the smart-suited elf waiter an order for a chamomile tea and a coffee and rearranged the silk serviette in front of him, all the time keeping his eyes on the door in case Harry appeared through it. Café Quendryth had been a wizarding institution for over a century, and it probably hadn’t changed much over that time. It looked identical to the occasions when Draco had visited with his mother as a young child. Narcissa had much preferred Quendryth’s sedate, dignified atmosphere to the more plebeian Fortescue’s around the corner.
Harry shrugs. "I don't know. It's hard choosing all new stuff. You wouldn't understand, you inherited all your stuff."
“Please don’t,” Draco answered, meeting Harry’s lips halfway, and gasping into them. Fuck, but Harry was a good kisser. Draco supposed that he ought to have known the other Seeker would be great at this. The wizard kissed exactly as he flew; wild, impetuous, and uninhibited, and Draco felt the edges of his reality start to slip away.
Draco knew about flying. He knew about drinking, and take-aways, and forgetting to call Mother as often as he should. He didn’t keep regular hours. He wasn’t
“It does,” Draco answered, choosing no to offer up additional information.
Harry’s brow furrowed, and Draco almost felt sorry for him. “I took advantage,” Harry answered, pulling his hands out of his pockets, and wrapping them around himself in a defensive gesture. “Thing is Draco, I like you… Have done for a while.” He paused, looking wretched. “But we can’t fuck again. I’m not ready for you – for this,” Harry said, motioning to the breakfast that was starting to burn. “I don’t want anything serious.”
"S'a nice jumper," Harry says, running his hands up and down the soft fabric on Malfoy's back.
He hands the basket to Harry and says, "You should probably go up alone."
Ron walks out of the hallway shirtless and scratching his stomach. He's got obvious sex hair and as he walks to the fridge for a butterbeer Harry can see he's got scratch marks down his back.
Watercolours of magical creatures covered another wall; dragons, hippogriffs and phoenixes. Best of all, however, was the cot. If anything, it looked better than it had done in the emporium. The protective runes were carved deep into the grain of the wood, and as Draco ran his fingers over them, he felt the enchantment, protective and powerful. Molly Weasley had made a quilt, and Harry had placed it inside of the high wooden sides. It was apparent that Harry had done his very best to make everything just right for their baby, and the results were breathtaking.
Harry gets the can opener and a saucepan and starts warming up his soup, stirring miserably while he thinks. In the last several months when Harry spared a thought for Malfoy and the testimony he had given he assumed Malfoy had witnessed a lot of death and destruction. He didn't think of Malfoy afraid to act too gay around his father and all his awful friends and their resident murderous sociopath. Knowing Malfoy lived with several homicidal homophobes makes it so much more real to Harry that Malfoy was
"No, I am a connoisseur. And you are a cave troll."
Harry wanders to the nearest aisle of fabric. Every section is neatly labeled and Harry appears to be in the P's—Ponies, Poppies, Potter… Harry silently prays it's ceramicist themed and pulls out a bolt of fabric. It's printed with a pattern of glasses and lightning bolts. Harry groans and suddenly there's Malfoy, standing at his shoulder, laughing at him.
"Yes, so let's skip the horrifying trip down Voldemort Lane for today and get back to kissing because there are plenty of ways for you to see I'm different now, one of which is that I previously would have only bruised you with my fists, whereas now"—Malfoy puts his lips back against Harry's neck—"I use other methods."
Harry spends the afternoon curled up behind Malfoy, breathing in the soothing smell of his hair and feeling the movement of his ribs underneath his hand. Hagrid's visit reminds Harry there are other people in Malfoy's life that ought to know he's in hospital, namely Malfoy's mother. He probably should've realized sooner, but Harry's never had parents to contact when he's been injured so it didn't occur to him.
"Ministry sent me out. I thought you were bringing all the furniture?"
Draco kept his face passive, not wanting to betray the strong feelings of disappointment that washed through him. It was unaccountable, really; the idea of his living at Grimmauld Place and raising the baby hadn’t ever come up before, yet Harry’s dismissal of it felt painful. Molly looked to be getting ready to counter Harry’s last comment. Her face was the very picture of exasperation, and her husband and children looked to be getting ready to make a snappy exit.
"Uh huh."
Draco wanted to play Quidditch for England. He was at the top of his game right now; fit as a flea and flying like his life depended on it. Having a baby meant he’d miss a whole season of play, and when he came back, he’d be out of form. He’d be slow, and out of shape. Louis St Clare would take the Pudd’s top spot and he’d end up warming his backside on the sub’s bench.
Daringly, Draco was bold enough to venture a question as they dug into their Baked Alaska Pudding.
"This is your fault, you know," Harry says, pointing at Ron.
Malfoy says yes. Then, looking slightly panicked he says, "Give me thirty minutes."
“Mate, are you sure you’re okay?" He asks, but Harry
“Just fucking get on with it, Draco,
“Alright,” Harry murmured, softly. “Tell me, love, if it hurts.”
Draco sent his best Malfoy-scowl flying in Harry’s direction. He’d been studiously avoiding thinking about both those two issues, and to have them both brought up in one sentence felt grim.
Harry cut him off. “Draco,” Harry said, shoving his hands down deep in his pockets. He looked sheepish and the colour was high on his cheeks. “You-you shouldn’t have gone to all this trouble. I’ve got plans… Ron and Hermione. I’m meeting them at the new café in Chimaera Park… I should go.”
He goes back to his flat to drop off his things before he Floos back to St. Mungo's, hoping Malfoy will be awake.
"In."
“There wasn’t anything to tell,” Draco answered, amazed that Pans could bring the most significant news of his life back around to herself. Still, that was Pansy Parkinson. Humility hadn’t ever been her forte. “I didn’t tell anybody. The sex… well, it was Potter. The original glittering Gryffindor. It was every bit as good as you’d expect… It's just that came after it wasn’t quite as hot. Harry made it pretty clear that it’d been a mistake. There’ll not be a bonding ceremony, Pans. We’re not even in a relationship.”
the Mondrian. You wouldn’t have had a chance otherwise.” Draco stepped away, and leant against the counter. “It was an extremely well-considered decision that I've made, coming to live here.”
"You distracted me first," Harry says.
Ron lets go, and Hermione is fussing with his hair and his clothes, and making sure he is, in fact, all in one piece, but Harry knows he’s fine. He knows what he has to do.
With that, Marcus made for the door.
"Yes. Yes I am. Gay. And so are you. And maybe Andrea."
Other Harry turns on his side slowly, tucks his head under Draco’s chin. Harry can’t help but notice the fingermarks on his hips, wondering if they’ll turn to bruises the next day. A sunbeam pokes through the curtains, muted by the gauzy fabric but glowing on the two sweat-shiny bodies on the bed. Draco’s hair gleams in the light.
"Suppose you think you're too good to eat with a Death Eater? No, no, of course, you are. Can't have your adoring fans thinking you'd share crepes with—"
Malfoy opens the door for Harry and waves him in. "Get ready to taste
healthy relationship.
"I'm glad you apologized to Neville," Harry says. "I don't know what to think about you doing it for me."
"And you've always made sure to listen to Hagrid, have you?"
Harry sits down at a cast iron table that looks like it's been dragged in from the garden. As he does, Yip seems to feel his business is also done and curls into a small puff of hair in a tiny bed beneath the table, Lord Yipslington embroidered on it in gold thread.
"I liked the salt on top. I've never had salt on top of a biscuit before."
headline yet, but it was only a matter of time: in under a month his tummy had gone from looking like he was smuggling a Snitch to looking like he was hiding a Bludger. The speed at which their baby was growing was a little startling, and a little brilliant too, and Draco hadn’t known that his body could change as fast as it had.
“And that is brilliant to hear,” Hayes answered. “As I’ve said to both of you gentlemen before, there isn’t a right or a wrong way to become parents, and all family shapes are equally valid. All that matters is that your baby comes first, and that is undeniably the case with the pair of you.” She paused, and searched through her sheaf, pulling out a parchment sheet with a triumphant flourish. “You’ll both be extremely happy to know that I’ve received the results of the tests that I performed on Harry. The pair of you have uncommonly strong magical signatures gentlemen, and ones which compliment each other very well. Basically,” she said, pushing the parchment over towards them both, “your little witch or wizard is likely destined to be a very powerful wix one day in the very near future.”
Harry hops off the counter and goes to the cupboard to find the kale. There's only one bunch of large green leaves so Harry doesn't have trouble finding it.
"Well, isn't that something," he says finally, still pink-cheeked.
Draco didn’t know what to make of that, but he was gratified that Harry had been so prompt in making the appointment. Merlin, but he hoped that Potter hadn’t been spied buying a baby book. The
"Hello dear heart."
"I don't know who that is but I won't stand for you besmirching my Fiori di Sicilia extract, it's about to make this cake utterly divine."
"I'm not awkward!"
"No, I'm not angry."
No, Draco isn't eleven anymore. He's an adult. An adult who doesn't need to impress anyone, least of all Harry Potter. He's an adult who will make crepes for breakfast because he likes crepes. And if he doesn't scale the recipe down it's because there's only one egg and one cannot split an egg in two. Not because he's making crepes for Harry Potter. He's simply making an abundance of crepes, he thinks, whisking the batter rather vigorously.
"Stick around, Potter," Malfoy says, before finally kissing him.
Harry rolls his eyes. "Of course you are."
"Do keep up, Potter." Perhaps a spell for repelling posh gits as well, preferably one that roughens them up a bit.
After rubbing its soft fur against his legs until he gives into pets, Petrol walks over to the next cupboard door over and meows at it, rubbing its face against it. Not wanting to risk crossing the cat, Harry shuts the double doors with the albums and board games, and opens the small door.
They drink their tea with milk and dunk their apricot pistachio biscotti and then Malfoy says, "What would you like for dinner?" and Harry's cupboards are bare so he says he doesn't know and they go back to the grocery store to buy a cauliflower, ricotta, capers, red pepper flakes, a lemon, farro and some unbelievably pricey parmesan cheese. And then Harry buys a heavy and expensive ceramic casserole dish he's certain he'll never use again. Malfoy combines all these ingredients into a cheesy baked farro studded with deeply roasted cauliflower that Harry eats three helpings of.
“Fruit tarts and soup are going to become the foundations of your diet. It’s really not as bad as it sounds.”
"Yes, yes alright that could work. You won't forget the preservation charms? And the warming spell for the tea?"
"I think," Harry says, "Neville gets to decide what would make him feel better, not you."
"Do Italians eat pasties?"
Harry's so happy in the sunshine, a little drunk on wine with a full belly that he says, "That was a great pasty."
"Potter, come look at these substances trying to pass as food."
It really was. Magic and Muggle flowers bloomed in two large beds, and the lawn sloped gently downwards around the trunks of two ancient oak trees. It was sun dappled, and shady, and Draco could envision the three of them spending many happy hours there, picnicking on a blanket and kicking a ball around. It’d be a different sort of childhood to the one that he’d known, far more relaxed and safer.
If Draco’s answer had been unconventional, then Judith’s professionalism masked her confusion. “But of course,” she replied, leading the two of them back to the ostentatious fireplace. “Two down, and one to go.”
"Then he told me my family was Punjabi and that's why he was making dal makhani. Because it's Punjabi."
“While on the subject of leaning on people. Talk to Ron and Hermione. Stop saying no to dinners and drinks. Go Muggle, if you need to avoid the press. Stop closing yourself off to the world just because you don’t think you’re worthy. Trust your friends. They need you just as much.”
a wizard – and so he cast a Cushioning Charm inside my tee-shirt! I virtually died of mortification on the spot, but Harry didn’t mind a Sickle. He’s got this bloody baby book –
"Er, Ron invited him."
"This is very delicious porridge," Luna says.
"Yes, I think it's time for dessert."
Mother gave him a concerned look from across the table. “My dear. I don’t remember you liking mustard to that degree,” she said, casting her eyes over his plate. “Do be careful! You’ll give yourself heartburn.”
"I'm learning about Muggle fashion. Muggles wear sweatpants."
"More than a bit."
Greg was right. Draco was setting himself up to be hurt again, hurt badly. Harry, as oblivious and heartbreaking as always, carried on speaking. He didn’t understand that he’d cut Draco far deeper than even the scars of the Sectumsempra spell.
Greg answered for him, because he was a mate, and because he had Draco’s back.
Harry doesn't know what to do. He follows Malfoy around the greenhouse, quiet while Malfoy rambles to himself about the various arrangements he's considering until the basket is overflowing.
"Ooo how was it?"
name on the top of that prescription, Harry, not yours! We’re not bonded – not even a couple – and even with your Order of bloody Merlin the Apothecary won’t hand you that potion! It’s totally against the law.” Draco groaned. “And I
“My trousers don’t fit,” Draco answered eventually, knowing that the anguish in his voice was quite out of proportion with what he’d actually said. “Not one single, lousy pair. I’m as round a ruddy cauldron, Harry,” Draco elaborated, “and I’m not even halfway through! I’ll be the size of Wiltshire by the end. I’ll be the size of the bloody
"I think what Ron is trying to say, is that anger isn't a sustainable or enjoyable way to live, even if it's completely justified."
Draco nodded, and followed her down the corridor. Her office was warm and welcoming, and there were pictures of several rather pink and very new babies pinned to her wall. A month ago, the sight would have horrified Draco, but today he found their screwed-up, new-born faces heartening.
have fibbed downstairs about the reason that I brought you to Grimmauld Place.”
Looking at his co-parent, Draco tried to make out if the other wizard was dissembling but Harry didn’t look like he was fibbing. Harry’s face was as open and as honest as always.
Draco made a noise of disagreement. He’d fancied getting his nose bloodied by Lewandowski last season and hoped he’d still get the chance when he got back on his broomstick. “What about St Clare?” Draco asked, albeit half-heartedly. “He looked pretty sharpish on his Nimbus after I got grounded at the end of last season. Grabbed our winner right out of Lewandowski’s fingertips.”
Malfoy sighs. "Must you ask difficult questions?"
, could it? Sickening fear gripped him. It couldn’t be. He was only halfway along, and his baby was far too small.
"I won't be taking any further comments or questions until you've actually eaten some."
"No come
Ron whistles. "What a trip."
, a Muggle movie that Harry had claimed was a must-see classic, although Draco couldn’t for the life of him understand what was so alluring about godfathers. He’d had a revolving clique of faceless Ministry wizards in the role, men under the sway of Lucius’s influence, and they’d vanished like the breeze the moment he’d been convicted.
"I mean it, Harry," he says, voice low and strong. Then he pulls Harry into a searing kiss. Not his usual slow and tender meandering kiss, but hot and sharp and breathtaking. When he pulls back Harry is dazed. A lot has happened this afternoon, first Luna dropping the word
"Apparently not."
Harry follows Ron's advice. He gets another cup of tea, wishing it was the chai he's now addicted to instead of Earl Gray. And then he tells Ron everything he can about his trip to Diagon two days ago—where they went, in what order, how much time they spent at each shop, anyone they saw or spoke to, what the clerks looked like—and Ron takes quick and efficient notes. When they're done Ron says, "Do you want me to walk with you to Kingsley's office?"
"So 'ave they caught the person responsible?"
"D'you want me to let your mum know you're in the hospital?"
Trust Malfoy to have milk fresh from the bloody cow. Harry grabs a bowl and spoon and he's about to start eating when for some unfathomable reason the words, "Are you having any?" come unbidden from his mouth. Harry shoves a bite of wheaties in his mouth to stop any more awful questions coming out.
"Cast a cooling charm on the cake, Potter. I need to make the glaze and I can't pour it over a warm cake, it will be too runny."
"Yes of course, poor Potter," Malfoy teases before kissing him.
"Who said I was straight?"
Draco grit his teeth, remembering how he’d thought his luck had changed, and the cold bite of humiliation when he realised that Harry hadn’t wanted him.
"Good egg salad, too," Harry says. "I like the gherkins."
Harry keeps quiet about his egg and cress. "I'm surprised you'd make pasties."
“Oh,” Draco gasped, as his lover’s long, slick strokes ceased. A delicious look of attention crossed his face, and Harry’s fingertips made very precise, very sensual circular motions.
Elianna glided into the room, feathery and graceful, but Draco frowned as he unhooked the message from her leg. It wasn’t the note cancelling their rendezvous that he'd expected. Instead, it was the very last thing that he’d ever thought Harry would have gifted him: a copy of today’s
"How charming," Malfoy says. "As it happens I prepared some soup. Mr. Weasley, would you like to take a break for lunch?"
Harry laughs and kisses Malfoy again. It's almost easy, laughing and kissing Malfoy.
"That part I knew actually."
that medicine. I’m supposed to start taking it tonight.”
When Harry tries to point out that Malfoy's opinion on his mattress is not required because Malfoy will not be sleeping in Harry's bed, he gets pink again and then flounces off to the pillows, where he advises Harry to get "
Adrianne had already magicked Narcissa’s sherry and Draco’s water to the green drawing room, and the pair of them sipped their drinks and swapped pleasantries while they waited.
Truth be told, Harry’s visits were the highlight of Draco’s days. Though he’d Flooed several times to Pansy’s, and to the Manor – it was terrific fun, both witches waited on him, hand and foot – Draco had found that he preferred staying at home. His pregnancy had seemed, one day, to become conspicuous – Harry said he had ‘popped’ – and Draco feared the attention that going out would likely bring.
Malfoy pronounces
"Cabbage is cabbage."
Luna is quiet for a bit, brushing her fingertips over the rose petals as she walks. Harry glances back up at Malfoy but he's still a ways ahead of them on the path. The peacocks have wandered off but the giant cats are still at his heels and Harry watches as he bends down to pat one without breaking step. He looks so… human.
Harry takes to inspecting the rooms he didn’t pay much attention to the day before. He looks through the bathroom cupboards — much better stocked than his both in general toiletries and everyday potions. He turns the shower head on just to check the pressure and is left in wonder at the steady spray, questioning how they managed it, if this is indeed the same Grimmauld Place with its shitty Wizarding plumbing from centuries ago.
“More,” Draco commanded, his voice shakily urgent. “Feels brilliant.”
"I put persimmon in your porridge
He decided to send Elianna back without a reply. Whatever game Harry was playing, Draco wanted no part in it.
"So you've told me."
Luna pulls some raw meat out of her bag and holds it out to Harry. "I thought we might make a trail of meaty gingerbread crumbs."
He rolls the dough carefully and cuts it into generous rolls, happy with the spiral, and leaves the buns to proof for another hour or so. The sun is coming up now and Draco is contemplating a second cup of coffee. And maybe he should make some bacon to go with the cinnamon rolls.
“And then, just when things were starting to get better, and against every odd in the sodding world, you’d become my friend, I fell off my broomstick! I felt like I’d been fucking cursed, Draco. Felt like the life that I’d clung to with the very edges of my fingertips was slipping away from me! You were in the
Perhaps, Draco hoped, things would feel a little clearer in the morning.
with them.” Draco gave Harry a shrug. He needed to be honest, and he might as well start now. “Don’t worry though. I’m… We’re not going to ask for anything. Not your gold, your time or even your name. You're not beholden to us... I heard you, Harry, back on the night I got pregnant. You said you didn’t want any surprises. That you weren’t ready.” Draco swallowed; his mouth dry. “And you said that sleeping with me had been a mistake. And that’s fine, Harry. I
Malfoy gently maneuvers them so Harry is lying on his back, Malfoy leaning over him sucking soft kisses onto Harry's mouth. Wisps of Malfoy's hair are escaping the half ponytail Malfoy is wearing and Harry blindly reaches up to pull out the hair tie, letting Malfoy's hair fall to tickle his face. It feels so good Harry does actually moan this time and Malfoy pulls back to smile at him.
He pulled a gorgeous yellow shirt from the front of his wardrobe, one he’d brought in Muggle London earlier that week, and stood in front of the mirror, holding it up in front of himself. It’d be fine. Today wasn’t anything special. It was only brunch. It was only Harry Potter.
"Oh that sounds lovely. I've always preferred covered spaces to wide open ones."
He is lost in the way Other Harry’s back arches, and his hands grasp for the bedsheet under him, the way Draco whispers praise to him, and his hands run over Other Harry’s side reverently. Draco pulls Harry up by the hips until he’s on his hands and knees and Harry feels the urge to grab Other Harry’s hands. To close the distance between them and just hold his hands down while Draco fucks into him, hips stuttering, eyelids fluttering in pleasure. He very nearly does, when Other Harry looks up like he’d done earlier and his eyes stop exactly where Harry is, even though Harry knows the Cloak can’t fail.
As soon as Malfoy gets up from the table Yip leaps from his bed to follow. Once outside, Yip starts circling Malfoy, yipping playfully, and soon the giant cats are slinking over with the peacocks waddling not far behind. Luna bends down to coo at all the animals, letting the cats lick her hand and even patting the peacocks on their heads so Harry feels a repelling spell might be in poor taste at the moment.
The witch hurried out of the door, and Draco felt a coil of anxiety roll through him as he lowered himself backwards onto the pillows.
"There are no vegetarian options," Malfoy says mournfully.
"Well if you'd stop talking—nghhahh."
"Do you like being an Auror?" Harry asks Ron.
Harry wasn’t wrong at all. He’d had a great time at the restaurant. He'd snorted inappropriately at Harry’s impressions of the other Puddlemere players, gossiped about the other witches and wizards from their Hogwarts year, and even the Carbonara had been to die for.
"You look like a Flobberworm," Harry says.
"Oh but you do like to help people, don't you, Potter? And am I not worthy of being helped?"
"Fine," Harry says.
Harry stopped dead at Draco’s words, and turned on his heels to face him. “Don’t go yet,” he urged, giving Draco’s forearm an urgent squeeze. “Stay with me a bit longer,” Harry cajoled, waving his hand in the direction of Diagon. “We’ve just met our baby, got our due date, and been told they’re healthy, Draco! We should be celebrating, not slinking off back home.” Harry laughed, very taken by his idea and Draco felt all his willpower leave him. “My treat,” Harry continued, “anywhere you fancy. Come on! We’re both hungry, and I’m not ready for this morning to end yet.”
"Get me the cocoa," Malfoy says.
Ron shakes his head. "I think this is a rich people thing."
"That has tomatoes in it, Potter."
A quick
The two of them made their way slowly through Wizkids, and Draco felt a little overwhelmed by the choices on offer. There were complicated looking pushchairs that could be charmed tiny and hidden in a cupboard. There were Quidditch themed mobiles to hang above cribs, and there were charmed toys, magicked to make patterns dance across their child’s ceiling.
the light and thanking Merlin that the Manor house-elves had made up his bed and tidied his room. He’d have to send his mother flowers come the morning. He’d never moan about her interference in his domestic matters ever again.
Harry shrugs. "Guess I'm into emotional intimacy."
He practically holds his breath until he gets outside, where Malfoy is waiting for him on the pavement. They walk to Harry's flat, both of them holding bunches of flowers instead of each other's hands. As Harry opens the door to the flat Malfoy says, "I think we need biscuits."
"You keep it on the stove? But food splatters!"
Besides, they’d be busy. Greg had Quidditch to play, and Pansy had Theo and Cygnus. He ought to go to bed. Get some rest. Enjoy the quiet while he still could. That was what Mother would say, had she been here.
Somewhere along the line, his luck had changed.
. "Why?"
Ending his pregnancy meant that he wouldn’t have to tell Pansy, who’d only want to fuss, and faff, and want to throw him baby showers. Draco didn’t feel ready to have those conversations.
Hermione's eyes light up. "That is exactly the kind of blood purity nepotist shite that makes me want to train flocks of birds to peck nonstop at its participants, but if you're telling me you'd swing the votes for me then I'd say I'm game."
"Thank goodness you're here," Malfoy says. "I need you to Apparate the cupcakes to the party."
Other Harry leaves the house shortly after Draco, and Harry rushes into the bathroom for a shower (and if he indulges in a ridiculously short wank, he can’t bring himself up to feel much guilt after his earlier actions) and down to the kitchen to eat.
Malfoy huffs out a small laugh. "Yeah maybe."
As soon as Millie left, Greg closed the door behind her with a wave of his wand.
"Fine by me," Harry says.
"Right, this is me enjoying Potter fabric."
"Works for me," Harry says.
that ended the Cookery Charm and then Draco watched as he Levitated the charred, still-smouldering pan to the sink.
why I called you around… I didn’t mean to do that.”
He can’t find a blank piece of paper but does find a French Onion Soup recipe Luna gave him months ago and he’s never even tried, that happens to have a blank back. Harry smiles fondly after a quick glance at the ingredients: onions, garlic, bay leaf, Port, Worcestershire sauce.
“I need my bloody wand!” Draco yelled, feeling very cross with himself and the world in general.
"So what's up with the Thestrals?" Harry asks.
"Fine."
Harry picks out some large white and gold narcissus and wanders around for a long time trying to figure out what else will go with it until Neville appears to take pity on him and picks out some small feathery green bits, shaking his head at Harry while he rings Harry up. Harry walks back to St. Mungo's with it, getting kindly smiles from older women on the street like he's a good lad.
Now though, it seemed the rules had changed, and Draco wasn’t sure if his heart, or his nerves, were ready for the challenge.
"They're dishes, Malfoy. No one's aiming an Unforgivable at you."
That made Harry stand himself. He palmed the stiff bulge in his trousers and gave Draco a once-over that burnt with an intense heat. “That might just be true. Bloody hell, Draco. If you could only see how good you look. I don’t know how long I’ve wanted this.”
. Which, good, Harry thinks, a person should be nervous if they tried to get someone's beloved pet executed and then invited that someone to tea.
"If only we had a Pensieve," Ron says, "Then you could see The Tongues."
All of a sudden, Draco felt more confused than ever.
bloody hormones and stupid,
Draco couldn’t help but look at Harry as he answered. The other wizard’s eyes were wide, and filled with affectionate concern. Harry leant over and gave his forearm a fleeting squeeze. “None at all,” Draco answered. “I’m feeling better than I have in weeks. The morning sickness has tapered off now, and I’ve got a lot of more energy… I’ve even felt a few little flutters which is exciting. No real movements yet though.”
Draco preened with the praise and he turned for the door, pulling his shirt over his head as he did so. He flung it back in Harry’s direction, and the other wizard caught it with ease. “Excellent reflexes Seeker Potter,” Draco admired, opening the door with a flourish. “Now, are you going to hurry the fuck up Harry?” he asked, “or do I have to need to start warming myself up, all by my lonesome?”
"Shut up."
"I'm not sure I like lasagna," Harry says, thinking of Aunt Petunia's dry and rubbery version.
"Stick around, Potter, and you'll find out."
Ron shrugs. "I don't know either. You'd think I'd be angrier, but honestly, I'm sort of tired of it. We survived, you know? I mean, really think about that, we made it out alive. When I think about Fred—" Ron swallows hard and Hermione rests her hand over his. "Fred would go bonkers if we carried on being miserable. He'd want us to be happy."
The night is dark, and the shadow of excited people continue to crowd the wall. Harry moves closer to where the guards stand, before it’s too late and the only way to get across would either call for secretively hexing innocent muggles, or risking apparition.
“It’s down. For good. The government too, it seems.”
“No, I mean. It doesn’t scare you?”
“Yes.”
“Ah.”
Malfoy was watching him with a calculated look. "Refill?"
Harry sighed. “Honestly. Just throw it over that chair.”
Harry circles the island in the middle of the kitchen, and when he leans back with his legs stretched forward, their boot clad feet almost touch.
Malfoy’s got his hand on the door knob, and he fishes his keys out from his pocket, and unlocks the door. “I’ll set up the couch.”
“You heard me.”
“You’re only in your twenties.”
Malfoy laughs. “Oh, I can imagine it does.”
“Are you sure?”
“Very.”
“Shut up.”
“It wouldn’t be the worst. So what?”
“It was.”
Because this wasn’t anything near pornographic. It was simply pictures of men, and it captured them in their natural state. Sitting on stools against a simple backdrop, hugging their knees, natural light filtering through a nearby window.
Hermione swats his arm. “Don’t be rude. I’ll have you know Draco has got quite the hands for wrapping paper.”
“Likewise,” Malfoy smiles, and then carries his steaming mug to the Christmas tree where he engages in conversation with who the fuck knows.
They are intimate, which make them far more scandalous. Of men. Of course they are of men, but they are of men of every color, and men of every shape.
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Come on then. Who can say no to the Savior?”
“All right,” Draco huffs, and his fingers are on Harry’s cheeks, just like that. And Harry can only think of those fingers wrapping presents and curling ribbons, touching his cheeks like Harry’s made of tissue paper.
Harry floos to Hermione and Ron’s flat after carrying an assortment of presents.
doing outside?"
Malfoy's long fingers were in his hair, and Harry couldn't move his eyes away from Malfoy's face. It was so close to him now, that even in the dimly lit balcony, he could see the silver irises that he had emblazoned in his mind in the past few days.
“Your humor hasn’t aged as well as you have, it seems,” Malfoy says, and Harry thinks he can’t be hearing things right over all the loud chants of the people around them.
“Yes,” Draco snorts, looking up from the kitchen tiles to look at him properly. “And I’ve no idea why I just told you any of that.”
Malfoy tucks away the first album, and then he the sets the other on Harry’s lap. “I might go down to the store. You can look through these if you want. Or leave. I don’t care.”
“Will you come with me? Wherever I choose?”
In between the crowd, it’s hard not to recognize Malfoy’s blonde hair. Yet the unfamiliarity strikes him in the jarring contrast between himself and the muggle contraption he holds in his hands.
“Oh,” Harry says, and Malfoy slides his mug towards him, and Harry’s just grateful he’s got something to hold onto. “That’s good.”
"That's understandable, too." Hermione lifted a cup of tea to her lips. "I have an idea."
His heart hammered against his chest, and he reached down and touched himself. He looked up into Malfoy’s hungry eyes as if daring him to make him stop. Malfoy wasn’t an idiot. He took Harry into his own hands as he settled on his lap, legs on either side of Harry.
Harry watched in surprise as Malfoy pulled out his wand and conjured another glass. He poured firewhisky from the tip of his wand into the glass, and then levitated it towards Harry. "Cheers."
Harry stands up and moves towards the nearest window. Peering out, he realizes he sees nothing beyond the building right across from them. The bricked wall and the perfectly spaced out windows. It reminds him of something from a Hitchcock film.
“Want one?”
Harry takes a deep breath, but he inhales some of the smoke, and it does nothing to ease him. “On occasion.”
Harry ignored the tingle down his spine. "Is that supposed to change my mind?"
Harry doesn’t know what to do so he does what Malfoy says. Even when Malfoy gets really close to him, and it seems as though the flash will blind him. But it doesn’t, and Malfoy steps back and nothing’s changed.
"Poor, Potter. Can't handle everyone's attention even after so many years of infinite fame."
Harry snorts. “I’d prefer you didn’t. I was wondering. I thought you two were a packaged deal.”
Harry self-consciously ran his fingers through his hair. "Yeah, I know. Didn't bother with it. There's no way it will ever stay in place."
“Then keep it,” Draco stands, mug clutched in his hand. “I’ll be over there.”
“Do you know when they’ll call you back?”
He uses his wands to levitate the box of perfume from where he’d left it by the fireplace. Malfoy watches, as he begins to wrap his own set of presents.
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Come on.”
“No, thanks.”
Malfoy clears his throat. “Right. Goodnight.”
But as soon as he traveled back home through floo powder, he reached for his phone and looked through Mafloy's videos until he found a new one. Posted only five hours ago. Harry's skin tingled as he ignored Hermione's advice and clicked on the new video.
“Are they?” he takes a moment to look up, from whatever he’s doing, just to send Harry a smile.
"That chair," already held a few of Harry’s ties and coats, but Malfoy did as he was told.
“You look so good,” he said. “Your hair.”
“Malfoy,” Harry breathes. “I’m not sure.”
“So you haven’t changed.”
“Yes, what would happen?”
“Were you?”
“Here,” Draco’s eyes fall to his lips. “And here.”
Malfoy shrugs. “Join me in the kitchen?”
It had been a week since Ron had sent Harry the link, and so far, he'd been able to restrain from watching any more of Malfoy's video. Hermione had owled him that morning and asked if he would join her in one of their favorite muggle cafés.
Harry doesn’t know where he’s following him to, and it’s hard to pay attention. For while the crowd had thinned at the wall, the streets are flooded with them. Little groups of people, drunk or simply intoxicated by the night, huddle around the streets as though it’s daytime.
"I think you should try it anyway, and see what happens."
“Of course, who do you take me for?” Malfoy frowns, all serious until he cracks a smile. “Come on, then. I’ll found you a place to stay.”
Malfoy glanced down at where Harry's fingers wrapped around his arm, and Harry let go as if Mafloy's robes were made out of fire, heart racing at the sudden feeling.
They climb down the wall, which isn’t very difficult. Harry’s becoming immune to the flash from the camera, the way he used to squint whenever it popped in the corner of his vision.
“Oh.” Malfoy looks down. “Does that bother you?”
"You seem drunk."
“What’s it saying?”
Harry knows he’ll have to owl half of them to his friends, and the rest lug around to the Borrow on Christmas day, but he likes having some under his tree before the big day. He thinks it reminds him somewhat of the Gryffindor common rooms at this time of year. The Weasley jumpers that arrive a little early, and the smell of hot chocolate and marshmallows. Even, the taste of Ginny’s lips and the warmth from her gloved hands as they sat by the fire place. Though at that point in time, he must have had more things on his mind then who would next be kissed underneath the mistletoe, which someone would eventually charm to hang over Seamus wherever he would go. It hadn’t, if Harry recalls correctly, improved the poor lad’s luck in getting kissed any further than he would have preferred.
“That’s an improvement.”
His hair was pulled back in a simple, single braid. Harry would have felt disappointed if the braid hadn't sat so casually over one of Malfoy's shoulder, loose strands escaping its hold and framing his sharp face.
They stop by a small building not too many blocks away from Malfoy’s office. “I live just here.”
“Oh.”
Malfoy’s fingers run over the side of the wall, but Harry only sees this because the door is still open a crack, and the lights from outside allow him a glimpse of the room just before the door shuts and the room is filled with dim, red lights.
The armed guards relax their grips on their weapons, and some go as far as to smile and chat with the people who hang around the wall, as though waiting for someone, a loved one, to cross over. Finally, a reunion. And it seems to be just that. The reunion of relatives once divided by an Iron Curtain, then materialized into metal and graffitied brick.
Malfoy turns his head to glance at him. “Let’s go.”
“Not without a portkey.”
“I was not whispering,” Hermione says, coming up from behind Harry, thrusting a mug of hot chocolate in his hands. “I don’t do whispering.”
Ron points at him. “We’re going out for dinner. Just you and me. Drinks and everything.”
Harry wants to grab the cigarette and toss it out the open window. “No.”
They stand doing nothing for a few seconds before Harry shakes off his coat, and then his long auror robe so that he’s in slacks and a rumpled white shirt.
“Ah.”
“Do you?” Malfoy asks. “They’ve quarantined the manor, did you know? I’ve got nothing to return to. Not truly. Father is locked up and may as well be dead. Mother, she’s somehow gotten away to Paris. I haven’t seen her. Obviously.”
Harry glared at him, but it quickly ebbed away. "I don't feel like arguing."
“It’s amazing, isn’t it?” he hears someone say in English. It’s an American accented man, eagerly jotting things down into a scrappy notebook. “I was sent here just yesterday! I can’t believe how lucky I am!”
“Fancy seeing you here,” Malfoy says in that familiar drawl of an unamused remark.
He releases a short laugh. “That sounds dramatic, doesn’t it?”
“Not as bad as you think,” Malfoy says after a while. “At first it was strange, but then you adapt. I reckon I’ve got a unique perspective, and it’s different for everyone. The most I’ve had trouble with was work. We couldn’t get any of that Tiananmen Square business published anywhere. No one wanted it, in case it provoked any outbursts here. Yet people have heard it, and look where we are.”
“You’re being dramatic.”
Harry took a step forward. “Will you come with me?”
“Yeah,” Harry looks up, smiling. “Pity, huh?”
So he found more. He found a lot more, and it seemed like Malfoy had picked up this hobby ages ago.
Malfoy produced a potion and tried easing that into Harry’s hair. “It’s almost better.”
“Likewise. Potter.”
Harry looked up. "There's a new one?"
“I’m aware,” Hermione says, with a cheeky smile. “I thought with you two under one roof, some of your skills might rub off onto the rest of us.”
“Don’t be silly. Come in.”
When he finally looked up, Hermione and Ron were both still staring at him.
Malfoy huffed a surprised chuckle as his tongue left a fiery hot path down Harry’s neck. “I’m leaving a mark.”
Ron had sent him a link via text (something he must have done with Hermione's help because he severely doubted he could have managed that task on his own. Besides, his thumbs were too big, and Harry made sure of always mentioning so), and captioned it with, "You won't believe your eyes."
Malfoy slides a plate across from him. “I’ve got toast and butter.”
"I have a solution for your obsession, although Ron is supposed to help, but he seems incapable of believing that you are in this deep."
“No offense, but I’ve gone on plenty without that, Potter.” He looks into his camera again, but he doesn’t snap a picture, he just looks through the lens.
“I assume you’ve been living on this end.”
“Oh,” Harry lifts the tea cup to his lips. It’s slightly chipped, but he doesn’t mind. “You’re right.”
He resumed his position against the rail, and Harry found a comfortable bench to settle in. He watched the city's lights as they flickered and zipped around beneath them. The night air was refreshing, and he found himself relaxed enough to take several sips of his drink until his glass was empty and he set it aside.
“Goodnight.”
Malfoy continues to crease his wrapping paper, taunting. Like a child.
The presenter is German, that part is clear, Harry realizes. But Malfoy’s bent almost uncomfortably, even with the volume up, just to listen.
“You’re burning up,” Malfoy breathed, giving another thrust if his hips. Harry tossed his head back as he gripped the sheets with his fingers.
"The what?"
Malfoy’s fingers brush his, and the cigarette is stolen from his fingers. “Do you fuck men?”
Harry can picture Malfoy standing behind a camera, capturing these photos as though it was no big deal. As though he wasn’t breaking the rules or leaving a mark. Harry thinks Malfoy’s leaving a mark. Harry thinks he’s losing his mind.
“Thanks. I owe you.”
“Unlike you, I have manners, Potter.”
“Not high enough.” Malfoy smiles, looks down where he’s got a box perfectly wrapped in white and red paper.
Harry runs his fingers over the sides of the photo album. “I’ll stay here.”
He tosses the shirt away, but Malfoy tosses it back. “I like how it looks. It brings out your muscles.”
"Just don't watch his new one."
“No,” Harry says, maybe too loudly. “No, I mean. Yes. I want to.”
He’s sitting across from Harry, and his long legs are intrusive as they stretch beneath the narrow table.
"Then I will. Pleasure seeing you again," Malfoy set his glass against a ledge and walked past Harry towards the door.
“Here?” Harry looks up, and it’s difficult not to notice the difference between this building and the manor.
“They’re wonderful.”
“Oh.”
Harry’s slightly confused as he holds the gift in his hands, watching Draco’s retreat as though he’s on the field.
“Where would you like me, then?” and Harry’s pulling his thin shirt off his chest before he can think himself out of it.
They linger by the west side for hours, it seems. Malfoy can’t seem to run out of film, and Harry can’t seem to get sick of the view of Malfoy shooting photos of Muggles. The crowd thins by the end of the night, and by the time they climb over the wall back east, Harry’s half drunk on fatigue.
“With her fiancé, I’d presume. Why? Should I mention she’s earned a new admirer?”
"I don't want to."
Malfoy’s cheeks flushed, even in the dark, and he scowled at Harry. “I’m not sure I follow.”
“No.”
“Don’t,” Harry says, before he can catch his tongue. “I mean.”
He looks around him but the flat’s bare, as it was last night before Malfoy’s shut the lights out.
“No, I haven’t been seeing anyone since,” Harry eyes Draco in mock suspicion. “How much are you selling that for?”
"Mate," Ron dropped a hand on Harry's shoulder. "You're fucked."
And it still makes no sense to Harry, how Malfoy’s become so nice.
“Oh, it’s you,” Malfoy’s sharp voice is an awful reminder of reality. “I was wondering who it was Hermione was whispering to.”
“You just,” Harry takes a deep breath. “You just creased that wrapping paper and now you’re laying it underneath the box so when you wrap it around it will show.”
“Yes. That.”
Malfoy tears his eyes away from the radio. They are cold and piercing. “They should.”
“Yes, Potter. I need you to get there as soon as possible. We’ve been given instructions that there is no chance of the loss of lives. We doubt there is cause for such concern, therefore I believe you’re fit for field this evening.” He pauses, as if he can see Harry’s half-empty bottle of firewhisky by the coffee table. “Are you?”
“And tea, of course.”
“Nonsense,” Malfoy smiles, and the camera’s flashing in Harry’s direction before he can breathe. “Go on, take your shirt off.”
But he didn't stop. He didn't stop until the videos stopped, and he let out a loud, shaky exhale.
They leave the red room behind to take the stairs up to an even darker room. It’s an office of sorts, Harry realizes, when Malfoy casts a Lumos.
“Where?”
“I see you’re in uniform,” and Malfoy’s eyes do more than just look. They skim over every detail of Harry’s uniform. “You still haven’t mastered an ironing charm, it seems.”
Malfoy pulled back. “Too much?”
Malfoy applies a generous layer of butter over his toast. “With everything going on I think it’s safe to assume the streets’ll be a riot.”
“You speak any German?”
“I just mean,” Harry wipes his sweaty hands across his jeans. “I mean. It must be terrible.”
Harry slumped in his chair and cradled his own cup of tea. "How could this help? If anything, it will only make matters worse."
“Oh,” Harry breathes, and his legs push him forward so that he finds himself examining rows of hung up film.
“All right, all right. Let me in.”
Harry laughs. “No. You’re right.”
Hermione’s head of perfectly coiled hair pops from the fireplace. “Hello, Harry.”
“Old,” he sighs, leaning against a kitchen counter.
“The wrapping?”
Then he straightens up, and goes back to the tea and coffee.
“Done?” Harry shoves his shirt back on.
Harry turns. “Good morning.”
"Are you planning anything?" Harry asked with narrowed eyes.
“Shut up.”
“Oh.”
That earns him the attention he seeks. “Show you around?”
“Potter.”
He wakes from the sound of fluttering wings and a pecking beak. When he peels his eyes open, there, the ending to a possibly new beginning.
Harry didn’t bother speaking again, so he just nodded.
“The confessing stuff,” Harry lifts his bottle to his lips, takes a long sip. “Hermione half suspects it’s a charm I’ve made up. Or something we’re taught during Auror training.”
The screen eventually turned black, and Harry was forced to take his eyes off. He needed more. Initially, he thought he could use this against the pretentious git the next time they had to come face to face, but his feelings rapidly changed from frustration to utter fixation. He needed more.
The man on his screen had achingly familiar blonde hair. It tumbled down to his shoulders, until his long, pale fingers twisted it back into a complicated hairstyle. Harry watched the procedure with rabid attention as Malfoy babbled on in his notoriously sarcastic tone. He spoke to the camera with ease, and often made silly jokes. Harry could hardly breathe.
Harry wakes up slowly, like he’s woken for the first time as a newborn child. The sun rays flit through the windows and warm his bones before he stretches his muscles, still laying on the couch.
“The wall is falling,” Dowson had said, quite stoically for an international crisis.
"Yeah, yeah."
“It’s not that. I know you’re a boring git that never dates,” Harry answered, standing to pick up his wand from the side table. “I don’t want any other surprises. The sort that arrives nine months after the event. I’ll cast the charm.”
"Harry," Malfoy says, voice quiet.
The two of them talked for another half hour, and Pansy admitted that she was thrilled to be an aunty. She told Draco that she’d buy his daughter all the chic little girl outfits that she wished she could have brought for Cygnus. “Not you as well,” Draco snorted. “Mother said exactly the same thing, and I told her what I’m telling you: Harry and I don’t know who they are yet. We don't find out gender until twenty weeks in.”
Harry doesn't. He's not sure Malfoy could say anything that would make him feel better about calling Hermione a Mudblood for six years, but Malfoy looks so smug when he thinks he's won so Harry says, "You have to mean it."
"Do you know how many times Crabbe and Goyle tripped me? Or Malfoy jinxed me? They'd take my school books and trash them, threaten to kill Trevor, they said nasty things to me about my parents… Harry, I thought you of all people would understand."
"Actually it was Draco. We weren't sure at first, because of all the damage Voldemort left on the property but it's really ideal. Did you know Thestrals can digest dead plant matter?"
It's another one of Malfoy's signature slow kisses that leaves Harry feeling like he could melt and when Malfoy starts to pull away Harry can't resist grabbing his shirt and pulling him in again for another.
“Stop, you prat,” says Other Harry. “We knew this would happen. I took every precaution. They just don’t know that.”
"Based on the damage we found, I'm expecting to keep him here for at least a week."
"This bottle cost the same as a pint. Now why don't you shut up and take a few sips?"
"Christ Malfoy, what are you on about?"
the spell and helped him down from the table after he’d had a moment to compose himself.
The two of them ate shortbread, and Arthur sipped his tea, making a sigh of approval as he sat back in his chair. Draco could sense there was something the older man was holding back. It was only when Draco vanished the crumbs from the splintered wood of the table top that Arthur finally spoke.
"What do you think of this one, mate?"
It dawned on Draco that Mediwitch Hayes had gotten the wrong end of the wand. “Oh, no,” he insisted. “Harry and I… We’re not
? Harry sucks in a harsh breath. He remembers the last time he saw Narcissa Malfoy, crying into a handkerchief trimmed with dainty lace, as the Ministry delivered her house arrest sentence.
Malfoy sticks his nose in the air with a snooty sniff. "I have standards."
“Gods,” Harry said, sounding impressed. “You totally sure you’ve got enough space in here? Bloody hell Draco. This room is bigger than the entire house I grew up in.”
“I told you I wasn’t. There was so much going on back then,” Other Harry says. “But I think so. Either today or tomorrow.”
"I was only saying it was weird. You have to admit it's weird."
Draco felt embarrassed, like he’d been caught in a fib. It wasn’t fair for Harry to pick up on the witch’s comment and to make him blush. “You’re supposed to be looking at the racing brooms,” he replied brusquely, trying to avoid both the subject and Harry’s warm gaze, “but instead here you are, stood there like the world’s most hapless voyeur! How long, might I ask, were you standing there?”
, I’ll admit that hearing that our baby was a bait to trap you into a relationship didn’t feel amazing. You and I both know that it isn’t true. I could have done without bloody McLaggen sharing his ten Sickles either. But I’m a big, grown-up wizard; I expected Rita Skeeter to be vile. That’s how she sells newspapers. 'Wizard has a baby' doesn’t have quite the same emotional grab, does it?”
"I'm not a wine snob
"D'you think?"
Draco inhaled a breath. There was one obvious question to ask. “What does your book say?”
"Come here," he tells Malfoy.
Harry would be an entirely different sort of father to himself, of course. He’d be all charmed bubbles in the bathtub and tickle fights. Harry would be pet Pygmy Puffs and one-on-one games of Quidditch in the garden. Harry would be fun, colour, and activity, whereas he’d be serenity and calm. Something sad twisted in Draco’s tummy and, all of a sudden, his cheery mood dropped. In another world – another universe – Harry and he would likely have made a pretty spectacular job of parenting together.
"No, some cabbage is dull with bruised and wilted outer leaves and no discernible taste whatsoever, and some cabbage is glossy, with crunchy tight outer leaves and a beguiling sweetness."
Harry laughs. "Thanks."
"You're ridiculous," Harry says, kissing his forehead. He runs his fingers through Malfoy's silky hair, only it's not very silky right now. "Your hair's greasy."
will say we’re a couple. Ask when we’ll be bonded. Ask what name the baby will carry... You ought to put out a statement or give an interview. Tell them we’re no such thing. Whatever you need to do, Harry.”
It was, but Sixteen St Mortimer’s Place wasn’t even remotely acceptable to Draco. He could tell that from the get-go. He’d no sooner move his family there than he would move them to the moon. It was in central Mayfair, so he’d be surrounded on every side by the worst kind of nouveau riche Muggle, and the road outside was busy with noisy traffic.
Harry doesn’t bother being careful or silent as he gets up from his chair and leaves the kitchen in a daze, not knowing what to do with himself. He sits, staring at the photograph-covered wall, eyes jumping from familiar smiling face to familiar smiling face, processing all he’s learned. He hears Draco get home and wonders just how long he’s been sitting there.
The Weasleys and their bonhomie would be a part of Harry and their child’s life that he’d be forever excluded from. Draco took a sullen sip of his fizzy water; upset at the path that his thoughts had taken. “I’m only surprised Weasley didn’t spontaneously combust,” Draco said, knowing that he sounded a little mean, but not able to help himself. “I’m sure he was appalled when you informed him you were having a baby with the Ferret.”
that Louis St Clare might win International Seeker of the Year, a prize that Draco had been coveting forever. Draco had imagined getting on a broom, wondered briefly whether he’d even get it off the ground, and had sobbed until his head had ached. Harry had told him off for upsetting himself so badly and then brought him a cup of sweet tea, told him that he’d be back in the air in no time, and then kissed Draco on the forehead.
"Yes you were right, as always."
"Actually, that sounds great," Harry says, perking up at the thought of dessert.
“How long have I been entirely sure? Only since you walked into my drawing room, Draco. It was blatant at first sight, my darling.” Mother leant over the table, and she brushed a gentle finger across the side of his face. “Your hair is glossy, and there’s a softness about your jaw. It’s very handsome. I meant it when I said you looked wonderful, Draco. You do. Pregnancy obviously suits you.”
Harry’s heart threatens to spill out of his parted lips.
Moisturiser or not, Harry focuses back on the conversation, silently following Other Harry and Malfoy to the kitchen.
Harry almost laughs at the thought of ever looking through a brochure for an antique shop and finding something he loves, but Other Harry perks up as Malfoy walks back into the room.
He wants to make something special for breakfast. Something besides porridge. Only Potter seems to love porridge, so perhaps something like porridge, something like… polenta. Polenta with cream and honey and the special Fiori di Sicilia extract Draco owl ordered that smells like citrus bathed vanilla, and a fan of sliced blood oranges. The red blood oranges will look very pretty on top of the yellow polenta and golden honey. He hopes Potter likes it.
"So…" Harry says awkwardly, "You work here, then?"
. Always Pure. That’s all the old families were brought up to think about, Harry. Those are the values Lucius tried to instil in me. You don’t have children because you actually want them, Harry. First and foremost, they’re your heirs, born to strengthen your pure, unsullied family line.
how much he wanted a family.
Harry had pressed his hands into the side of Draco’s belly, and he’d sung the words “little darling” to their baby.
Draco, already emotional, felt a bit overwhelmed by Harry’s words and so he didn’t reply. Instead, he placed his own fingers through the other man’s and knit them together, wanting to share in the special event.
“We had our sixteen-week appointment this morning,” Draco said, all his embarrassment vanishing with the witch’s kind compliment. He thought back to the
thank you so much for reading! this is my first 50k work and i'm so happy to share it with you!
They were the same words that Mother had used, and just like with Narcissa, Draco wasn’t sure how to answer. Arthur had been so kind and welcoming to him, when he’d had every reason to show abhorrence, or simply show Draco the door. Draco didn’t want to lie to this man whose decency and integrity felt real and instinctive. So, Draco put his mug down slowly, considering his words. It wasn’t as if there was a chance of being overheard. Harry had gone to play Quidditch and to mess about with his friends, and Draco wanted to be honest.
Draco imagined her playing tea-parties with his mother, and her listening while he read to her from his old, childhood copy of Beedle the Bard. The elevator came to a clackety halt on the ground floor, and Harry paused, letting him leave first. Merlin, but he was always so gentlemanly and considerate. Draco had no doubt that their daughter would be the centre of Harry’s universe.
Draco had told the elf that she was welcome to go back to the Manor if she wished, or even strike out on her own, but she had demurred. “Adrianne wants to help with Master Draco’s new family,” she had said, her velvety ears trembling with indignation at the idea of being sent away at such an exciting time. “Master Draco will be needing every bit of help that he can get.”
“Molly?” Harry said, knocking on the door.
“Where’s Granger?” Draco asked, looking furtively over to where Ron was sat beside Ginny and Oliver Wood, laughing over some shared joke, and supping Butterbeer. “Don’t tell me that love’s young dream is on the rocks?”
Harry nods, his cheeks bulging with wheaties, not that Malfoy can see. He's facing the hob carefully lowering eggs into the pot of boiling water. There seem to be four different recipes in progress, judging from the open cookbooks across the counter. Anyone else's kitchen would look a disaster but Malfoy has everything set up in neat little stations, ingredients gathered round a cutting board or bowl, cookbook nearby.
Draco snorted. “Don’t tell me that Mother Weasley has been any different, Potter. It’s the chief hobby of any witch of a certain age to guess a baby’s gender and to make predictions. The Muggles didn’t call them wise women without reason, Harry. Did you ever actually listen in your History of Magic lessons?”
Breath caught in Draco’s throat as he read the headline twice, not daring to believe what his eyes were telling him.
Harry doesn't know what to think of Malfoy anymore. He had scoffed when he first learned Malfoy would be testifying against Death Eaters, it had seemed like just another way the Malfoys planned to slither out of real consequences by any means necessary. But then Draco testified against his own father. The
"So will you be pretending to enjoy a sad supermarket sandwich today or would you like some lunch?"
His mother seemed to understand. “There was no mistake,” she said decisively. “Your union was a sacred one, blessed by Merlin. Wizards have long lifespans, Draco, and perhaps once he meets your daughter he will feel differently? You’re a striking, clever man, and the other parent to his child. Give Harry time. Has he been solicitous and gentle with you?”
Harry kisses Malfoy's soft pink mouth, briefly, because he knows how tetchy Malfoy gets about his timers, and steps back.
Malfoy tips the chopped garlic, olives, capers and parsley into the pan which hisses and sputters as it hits the hot oil. The oil pops and burns the back of Malfoy's hand. He swears and sucks on the spot.
"Well?"
Harry shakes his head. "Were you listening the whole time? Were you just laying in bed pretending to be asleep for hours like a complete fucking psychopath?"
And let me remind you it's the singular food I have made that you have disliked."
Draco couldn’t abide how kind Goyle sounded, how caring, and so his reply was tetchier than he would have liked. “Fine,” he snapped back. “The potion, I’m alright, just- I need another potion. A different brand.”
His coach wasn’t pleased with the result. “You were within six inches of that bloody Snitch,” Johnson shouted, spittle flying in Draco’s face. The owners weren’t pleased either. “You’re out of goodwill with the fans,” they shouted. “They need to see a win, pronto!”
Harry sounded so certain, but Draco didn’t – couldn’t – trust what he was hearing.
Draco nodded. “I've had to take a couple of afternoon naps,” he admitted ruefully, “but this one here has been looking out for me. Brought me a tonic made from Wiggentree leaves that perked me right up.” He risked a mischievous smirk in Harry’s direction. “Harry here is quite the Mother Hippogriff. He doesn’t let me do a thing for myself. He’s always rushing to get me another tea or
There's a palpable calm in the kitchen despite the activity. Malfoy moves around the kitchen in an almost lazy way, the same way he handles a broom, Harry thinks, before catching himself watching Malfoy again and pulling a cookbook over instead.
Malfoy folds his arms and does his signature sniff and sticks his nose in the air. "I am right."
Harry flips the page. "Mashed fava beans with escarole," he reads aloud, "I don't know what any of those things are."
As he'd eaten it, Draco had felt entirely guilt-ridden. According to the baby books that Pans had sent over his baby was currently banana-sized, which was comical, considering how rotund he looked in the mirror. Then Draco had made the fatal error of skipping ahead to the end of the book. The final fruit had been a pumpkin, the notion of which had left him reeling. That he, a wizard of standard size, was able to grow a whole pumpkin-sized person felt fantastical, and rather a lot like magic.
, you’re pregnant and then suddenly Harry’s everywhere; the best thing since Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour-bloody-ice-cream! Malfoy, you’re my best mate, you have been forever, and I don’t want to see you get hurt again.”
Harry smiles. Hermione has recently come out as bi and Ron is on track to become 1999's Best Bisexual Ally.
"You were the one who was all, 'must be hard to have Lucius as a father,' and 'what's the big deal Harry? he only tried to kill us.'"
"Oh, have you not heard?" Luna says to Draco. "You must still be reading the
Malfoy shrugs. "I'm quite wealthy, yes," he says, turning down the sheets and getting into bed.
He knew he wasn’t likely to forget the date of his appointment, or the location, but he wanted to keep it in sight. The appointment represented something meaningful. Draco supposed it was the first step on his journey.
"I am a gossip column addict and you are, unfortunately, a person of interest in society."
Ron puts an arm around Harry's shoulders and Harry breaks down for a moment with a sharp inhale and tears in his eyes. He wipes at his face trying to take deep breaths but his chest won't cooperate. He settles for shallow breaths as Ron squeezes his shoulders and says, "It'll be alright, mate."
Nodding, Draco answered. “I couldn’t have asked for better,” he said. “A bit much in the beginning, though he’s calmed down a little now. Every night his owl came tapping at my window. Nothing has been too much trouble.”
Harry gingerly climbs into Malfoy's narrow hospital bed, curling up next to him. Malfoy pulls Harry's arm across his chest and then seems to fall asleep immediately. Harry breathes in the scent of his hair, untainted by the sanitized smell of the hospital. He can feel Malfoy's heartbeat underneath his hand and it's enough to fall asleep.
"Of course you do," Hermione says, using her exasperated voice. "Would you say I don't know anything about being Black?"
He wants Harry to have real pajamas and real tea and a really delicious breakfast in bed made by Draco so that Harry gives him that half smile Draco is addicted to.
"You don't have to earn them, Potter," Malfoy says sharply.
“Bloody hell,” Harry murmured, before pressing a kiss onto his shoulder. “At least you’ve got your form back in the bedroom.”
“I’m not in love with Harry,” Draco said quietly, humiliated because both he and Goyle understood he was lying. “We’re making the best of it! We're co-parenting. It doesn’t matter what’s between us, long as our little one is loved.”
Looking at the label, Draco realised that Harry had brought it from Frobisher’s, one of the old wizarding places near Diagon. That also meant it’d been made specially to order. It wouldn’t have come cheap either.
"I don't have a cat."
"Oh no," Hermione says. "What's wrong?"
spell, and Harry’s mouth broke out into a wide grin every time he looked down at the picture. “I was expecting to feel overwhelmed – overcome – but not this massive surge of love.” He shook his head, bemused at himself. “December the tenth,” he added, referring to the due date that Hayes had given them both. “You’ll be giving birth during the European Cup finals.”
The Mediwitch only smiled. “Many witches gain clairvoyant abilities as they get older,” she replied. “She might very well be correct.” With that, she shook both their hands. “You are doing tremendously, both of you” she said, looking between Harry and Draco. “Whatever you’re doing, it certainly seems to be suiting the pair of you. I’ll see you both at twenty-weeks.”
“It’s good news,” Draco answered quickly. “I’m excited. Going to be a dad, Pansy! It’s all a bit overwhelming.”
“Draco,” Harry said again, but this time it wasn’t a question. His voice was a whisper, a mere murmur of noise; his hand was still curled around the base of Draco’s neck. Their knees pressed against one another’s, and time seemed to slow down, thick as treacle.
"Because I have every right to be! If you think I'm going to sit here and try to prove to you why I deserve to be happy—"
"Listen very carefully, Potter. I did not invite you here to pass judgement on my every action. You're here to make sure I'm not murdered in retaliation." Malfoy says slowly, enunciating each word like he's explaining something to a toddler. "But since you seem to think you're the ultimate decider of everyone's just desserts, let me clarify for you that I am not asking for anyone's forgiveness, not Hagrid's, not Luna's, and most certainly not yours."
Harry expects Malfoy to laugh, to tease Luna for saying something weird and absurd, but Malfoy just hmms. For a while there's just the sounds of tea sipped and cutlery clinking.
The thought of Petunia Dursley putting spices in anything is laughable, almost as laughable as the idea that she'd make a dinner for Harry.
Malfoy smiles and it's only a little smug and anyway, Harry minds less now than he did before. He wouldn't say it's cute, because he hasn't had some sort of insanity-producing lobotomy, but it's slightly less annoying than it used to be.
"What are you talking about? You're not vegetarian."
“Yeah,” he says, and stops himself, watching Hermione walk back into the room, face still just as worried as when she left.
"What?"
Before many more minutes, Harry had guided them to the destination that he’d had in mind. It was a small Italian restaurant called Fratelli’s. Set back from the path, the building was made of soft yellow brick, and covered with ivy. Harry guided Draco towards the door.
“The baby, Harry, she’s- Harry, I think-” Draco began, but he couldn’t make the words come.
He slips on his wool slippers and fumbles his way to the kitchen to brew a strong cup of coffee in the Italian stove top espresso maker he got himself for Christmas. This morning he'll use the Italian espresso beans sent along with his vegetables and the other goodies Draco gleefully added on to his farm share. That's why Draco chose this farm, because they work with other farms and cheese makers and old Italian grandmas who hand-make their pasta and tiny shops that have been air drying their cinghiale since the Renaissance so that Draco can check a box on a beautiful handwritten form saying yes, he'd very much like parmigiano and polenta this week.
Malfoy looks up from the cookbook smiling. "You remembered."
"Get me the cocoa."
Harry finally arrived at ten minutes past, and he stepped into the café, his face broken wide into a smile and his arms wide in greeting.
Before he knew it, Greg was breaking the
Malfoy does in fact straighten up on his pillows with a happy smile the moment he sees the white pastry box.
“Apologies for that, gentlemen,” Hayes said,
"How did you—never mind." Living at the Burrow is not conducive to keeping secrets.
he read, leaning against the cabinets, feeling annoyed at the fluttering in his chest.
"You don't have to worry," Harry says, climbing into the bed with Malfoy and spooning him from behind.
Harry looked unsure, so Draco took his hand and placed it back where it had sat a minute before. Harry swallowed, and rested his palm on the curve. Magic coursed from him, and Draco felt the deep devotion and warmth of the other man deep inside his bones. Harry loved their baby already, there wasn’t a single shadow of a doubt.
his living room.
“Just looking at you, is all,” Harry replied, smooth and alluring. With that, Harry spread his palms over Draco’s shoulders, and pushed him down gently onto the seat. He hardly had time enough to squeak out a noise of enjoyment before Harry was positioning himself above him, all brawn and commanding strength as he climbed between Draco’s legs. “And I’m not going anywhere,” Harry finished, shifting his body downwards until his and Draco’s lips were nearly touching. “Not if you don’t want me to.”
Harry looks around his kitchen forlornly for twenty minutes before he decides take out is the only palatable decision for tonight and owls Ron for his preference.
"You're sorry?"
It was too late to rescind his invite now. Their baby was, after all, half-Potter and if Harry wanted to be involved, Draco couldn’t deny him.
"Is this a date?"
Malfoy agrees, yawning on his way to the floo. The fire crackles green and Malfoy disappears from view.
Malfoy's standing over him, framed by the sun and holding a bottle with two wine glasses. "Are you hungry?"
Nodding, Draco focused on making the teas, adding a sugar for Arthur, and a splash of milk for them both. It felt odd, seeing the patriarch of a pure-blood family in such a domestic setting. He doubted that he’d ever seen his own father in the kitchens of the Manor. The wizard had only deigned it necessary when he’d felt one of the elves had needed a telling off, or when he’d had a special guest from the Ministry arriving with whom he’d really wanted to make an impact. Anything household had been squarely Mother’s territory, and not part of Lucius’s remit. Draco picked up the mugs, and placed them on the table, enjoying Arthur’s contemplative company.
"And that merit was?"
He takes the pot off the heat, leaves the spoon in it, and wipes his hands on the tea towel over his shoulder, again. He flattens the piece of paper down on the counter numerous times, but it always folds back over slightly every time his hands leave the worn-yellow surface.
“Mistress Cissy, Master Draco,” she announced, “if you would be following me to the dining room? As requested, Beef Wellington is served.”
"Why?"
“Better to know,” Greg said, as if it were that simple.
There’s a weight in his chest. A soreness that feels old, like a scar that still throbs from time to time or a broken bone that never healed quite right and gives him grief whenever the weather turns. He thinks of the joy in the face of Other Harry. Of the story told in photographs on the mantlepiece that tie clues together in his mind, of just how different this Harry’s life is. The photograph where he passes a Quaffle over to Teddy who flies towards Malfoy with it under his arm; the photograph where Hermione and Malfoy sit in a room he doesn’t recognise, and he stands in the background, holding a baby shaped bundle, smiling; the photograph of him and Malfoy with a small black kitten on the floor in front of them.
those memories, though. It was time to leave them in the past.
Harry, git that he was, seemed to want to lacerate his heart. Rather than Apparating away, he simply stood there, and carried on speaking. “Last night was a mistake,” Harry explained, compounding Draco’s humiliation with every word. “Too many shots of Firewhisky and not enough to eat. Bloody
“People talk and talk about Harry being a hero,” Draco added then, not sure why he had to justify himself, only knowing that he ought to, “but nobody knows about his good heart. That’s when I knew I loved him. When I knew he’d never let me down. I’m sorry,” Draco finished. “You asked a simple question. You didn’t want a diatribe.”
Draco made the decision to head back home to Half-Moon Place. What he really needed was a few days away from teammates, away from friends, and away from the ever-present risk of running into Harry Potter. The other wizard was a hard-working man – the under-21s had mounted a superb Quidditch season – but Harry was often to be seen in the canteen, or out on the Pitch, and Draco didn’t trust himself around him.
Malfoy tastes a measured sip of wine and licks his lips slowly. Or maybe it's Harry's brain that's moving slowly.
He wonders what Neville would think of Malfoy apologizing for Harry's sake. He wonders what the difference is between remorse and responsibility. He wonders which or both or neither of these things is a necessary first step to an apology. He wonders if Malfoy's right, if demanding suffering from people who've committed bad acts is a warped sense of justice. Eye for an eye and all that. But maybe guilt isn't the same as suffering—and Harry wonders yet again, can someone feel bad about their actions without feeling bad? Harry certainly never has.
Draco would have told Goyle to mind his own business, but Millie arrived back then with a fresh bottle of wine and a soft drink for him. He had to be content to scowl in Greg’s general direction as he sipped the drink, and to listen to Millie natter on about their bonding ceremony, and the various guests that Mummy wanted in attendance.
’. Draco chortled at the sight of it. Harry was right. The babygro certainly was charming, though Draco was loath to admit that aloud. The outfit looked teeny in Harry’s big Seeker’s hands. How could any human be that small? It felt incredibly bizarre not only that they did, but that one would be arriving to live with them in only a few months. “Shall I add it to the pile?” Harry asked. “Have we got enough newborn clothes?”
He sips his coffee, thinking. The Ministry is clearly trying to send him a message, or else hoping to catch him out in some wrongdoing, but they'll be sorely disappointed. He's not going to let Potter intimidate him or goad him into doing something stupid, he thinks, getting the buckwheat flour out of the cabinet. And though Potter will be spending the foreseeable future at the Manor, Draco refuses to cater to him.
Harry watches Malfoy add oregano and red pepper flakes to the pan before adding a tin of tomatoes. He stands at the stove stirring for a bit and then demands Harry cast a cooling charm on the tomato sauce while he tips the risen dough out onto the counter and starts rolling it into a rectangular shape. Harry can't stop watching his capable hands with his long slender fingers and the realization makes him want to groan except then he'd have to admit to Malfoy he thinks his hands are a bit sexy. So he watches quietly, as Malfoy dollops the sauce thickly over the dough and cuts the edges into thin strips that he folds over the sauce in a fancy braid, looking especially pleased with himself at the result.
He doesn’t have long to focus on that, though, because his other self walks in after Malfoy, babbling away words Harry’s brain can’t quite catch because he’s too entranced by what he’s seeing. None of the things Harry is bewildered by are unexpected. Of course, he’s seen the pictures. He’s searched the house. Not unexpected, but not easy to take in.
“Mmm,” Draco moaned, relishing the entrée, and half-wondering whether it would be socially acceptable to order another plate. “Yummy. Can’t believe that I never knew this place existed before. The cuisine here is exquisite.”
Draco felt his face flush red. Greg, the silly git had no idea about Draco’s internal mortification. Merlin, this had to be one of the most embarrassing things that had ever happened in his life. It ranked high on the list alongside being Transfigured into a ferret, being caught wanking off Cousin Everard when he was fifteen, and the time he was bitten by Mother’s pet Crup.
"Oh sure, you'd be at the Manor Gates daily would you?"
The kitchen is quiet in the sudden absence of Malfoy's whisking.
Without warning, his whole body juddered, and his prick twitched eagerly. Draco’s climax coiled outwards from the head of his penis, spreading through his middle and limbs while he gasped and panted. His head swam, his back arched and the blood pounded in his veins. Semen wet his and Harry’s bellies as he fell, irretrievably, over the edge. Draco shook, and trembled, losing himself in the waves of his orgasm.
"My fault? I didn't make you tongue down Malfoy."
Harry shakes his head, still chuckling. "I wasn't offering to adopt Nagini and run away together. It was just an offer like, hey, maybe we don't have to kill each other. This Malfoy thing is harder. I never wanted to snuggle Voldemort."
"You take responsibility!"
alright,” he answered, some of the heat leaving his voice. “It’s just a spot of food poisoning,” Draco clarified. “Last night in the restaurant? I knew when I was eating it that the chicken was suspect. I’ve half a mind to owl the chef.”
Draco was glad he was sat down. His legs felt wobbly, and there was a flickering at the edges of his vision. Knowing that headlines were imminent, and the reality of them actually existing were too different things. Merlin, but his mother would read this, and all of her highborn friends. Harry made an irritated noise, and spread the paper out in front of him.
“Okay,” Harry said then, voice quiet but thoughtful, “so I might
"Do you want to stay the night?" Harry asks, surprising himself. "Just to sleep I mean. I'm not ready to, uh—"
"Does it strike you as ironic, making poverty cake while you're filthy rich?"
"You pillock," Malfoy says under his breath.
"No. Er—boyfriend," Harry says, realizing it's true.
Malfoy is currently finessing some skin off the snapper fillets, working quite gingerly with a knife so Harry doesn't send a Stinging Hex at him.
There is no rushing, though. The kisses get deeper, dirtier even, but never quick and desperate, the way Harry is used to. Harry is entranced, ashamed and completely and utterly ruined by the fact he can’t look away, not even when his cock (wilfully ignoring Harry’s inner turmoil) finally comes to life when Other Harry throws a leg over Draco’s body and bends down to kiss him, again.
"Malfoy's at the hospital."
"You wouldn't believe the amount of parchment I had to fill out to get a single Portkey, with additional parchment promising I would not Apparate anywhere, nor fly via broom, magic carpet, or vespa. It was this thick," Malfoy holds his thumb and forefinger as wide apart as they'll go. "And I'm pretty sure they're only letting me go because Saint Potter is forced to accompany me. So, no, no aperitivos and taralli in an outdoor cafe in a cobbled square."
Ron looks up then, his expression strangely relieved. "When do you start?"
but something else is still bothering him. "It's so weird that
Draco nodded his consent, and Harry let his palm curve over the edge of Draco’s belly, slowly moving it until it lay over the very roundest part. He looked so handsome, and Draco’s breath caught in his throat.
"Yeah well you like mine and according to you that's worse."
"It's suffering, needless pain, endless torment!"
"Wet and ready, you know? Just primed for eating out, excuse me, eating."
Gods, but he looked so
"Stop. No. No more tongues."
"Where'd you get this vase? I don't have any vases."
When Harry's licked his plate clean, Malfoy asks with an air of trying too hard to sound casual, "So have you dated any boys?"
The front door opens for Harry as well but there's no Malfoy on the other side. Harry waits just inside the door in the empty hall for about two minutes before he decides he's not going to wait around like an idiot for Malfoy to find him.
"Did you know you were gay?"
Harry nodded. “I’ve made him tell me about it a dozen times,” he answered, eagerness blatant “I’m excited! A little bit nervous too.”
After the bedroom, sight unseen, Malfoy starts insisting on the kitchen. In fact, he barges his way into Harry's flat somehow and starts objecting to everything he sees in Harry's kitchen.
“That’s superb news,” Hayes replied, her quill writing Draco’s answer in his notes, “though you might feel yourself needing to up the amount that you’re taking as you get into your third trimester. The bigger that your baby gets, the more energy and magic they’ll use.” She shuffled the notes in the file. “Oh yes,” she said, “I asked last time if you were wanting to find out the gender. Did you get a chance to think about that?”
"Then why are you any less Indian because you didn't grow up eating curry?"
Harry took a deep breath, like he was going to say something else, but instead he began to kiss Draco once again.
"I'm sorry your mum's not well."
"You're not getting out of this," Harry says, trying to sound firm.
"I'm not being 'churlish'. I had the bare minimum of necessary nutrition fed to me, usually in the form of scraps. The first time I got to eat until I was full was at Hogwarts. So if it didn't come in a discounted, dented tin of soup, it wasn't on my plate, alright?"
“Mistress Cissy has been smiling all day,” Adrianne responded. “She says that the Manor misses its heir, and that she does too. The elves agree with the Mistress.”
"We'll move him to the long term care floor in the morning and you can visit him then."
Draco’s breath hitched. His heart was beating everywhere, all over his body. “Give us a chance,” Harry repeated, and then he leant in, bringing their lips together. It was chaste, a barely-there touch, but shockwaves ran though Draco.
, do you think that will be too spicy?"
Harry narrowly avoids telling her he'd rather die again than buy Potter paraphernalia. "Er—thanks, I'll keep looking."
"Merlin help us," Malfoy says, resting his arms on Harry's shoulders and looking pretty pleased himself.
Malfoy takes Harry's dish over to the sink and Harry, like he's Lord Yipslington's understudy, follows. He stands behind Malf,y, panicking about how awkward he's being until Malfoy says, "Dry the dishes," and Harry has a task to devote his attention to. He stands next to Malfoy at the sink and dries the dishes very thoroughly, watching Malfoy's forearms as they scrub.
Draco’s mind raced. He hadn’t expected Harry to ask that question, but he wanted to say yes. Had it been Harry who was carrying, he’d have wanted to get to know the baby before they were born. That was part and parcel of what they’d agreed. Make this fledgling détente work, one way or another.
"You're ridiculous."
Gingerly, Draco got to his feet and scuttled back through his bedroom. Should he call his mother? He couldn’t imagine her dignified person sitting beside him at St Mungo’s. She'd be out of place, and frightened, and just entirely wrong. He remembered how upset she’d gotten when she mentioned the Room of Lost Things, and Draco knew he couldn’t put her through that again. Pansy would flap and squawk, and make a drama out of a crisis. Greg would be as useless as a chocolate cauldron. Draco groaned. Who was he trying to trick? There wasn’t anyone in the world that he wanted except Harry.
To his surprise, no such telling-off occurred. Instead, the witch fumbled in her patterned tapestry shoulder-bag, and pulled out a rolled newspaper. “Those utter cretins,” she muttered, her fingers white where they were clenched around the
"I'm telling you that I'm not going to hurt you. Do you understand?"
"I used my Bensdorp double dutch cocoa powder. Not all cocoa powder is created equal."
Draco looked down at his plate. He had rather slathered the condiment all over his food. Draco hadn’t been able to resist. The little one had been craving spicy foods, and Draco couldn’t help but oblige them. He supposed this was as good a way to share his news as any.
"Since when do you call me Harry?"
"Potter, I shared a dinner table with Fenrir Greyback."
. And flavorless. They don't even taste like potatoes anymore, they just taste like
Making his excuses, Harry walked over to where Draco had been sat, and held out his hand to him. “You look like you need a drink,” Harry observed. “I know I could do with one."
"You go shopping for antiques? What are you, eighty?"
"What a guy."
bedroom,” Draco answered him. “Your clothes can live in Sirius’s room if you wish, but not you, Harry. Not you. You asked me to take a chance on us. That’s what I’m doing.”
Right now, Draco was still too angry to play nice.
falling for Potter’s charms.” Huffing out a breath, Goyle shrugged. “And there’s never been anyone else for you, has there, really? Not since you were an aristocratic little shit with a rod stuck up his arse.”
“There were a lot of pages in the book about magical signatures, and our magic combining together,” Harry said with a shrug, “and if I’m being truly, entirely honest, I didn’t understand most of it.” He smiled then, a genuinely fond grin, and Draco felt his heart skip a beat. It ought to be illegal to look that attractive, and he
“Oh no,” Greg cut in, clueless and cheerful as always, “you’ve got the wrong end of the wand! Draco and me, we’re not… I’m not into blokes. I’ve got a girlfriend. Millie Bulstrode? Been together years. Going to have a big bonding ceremony next year.”
"Just start the water."
"I think I'll get them. But not the mugs. I don't want matching mugs."
"You have so many bottles. What are all these for?"
Malfoy stands up from the table and Harry thinks he'll storm off but he goes to the counter top where he gets a mixing bowl and the flour and starts angrily measuring cups of flour. Harry wishes they could go back to the part of the morning when Malfoy's soft sweater was underneath his palms.
“Circe… I, erm…” Harry began, backing out of the room. “I’ll be back in a moment. Draco. Arthur.” Harry said, nodding to the Weasley paterfamilias, almost as an afterthought. “I promised Ron that I’d help him with that- that thing.”
Harry wakes up to the buzz of his wand in his pocket and after several months of being an Auror, that's enough to jolt him awake, roll out of the hospital bed and throw on the cloak as the door to Malfoy's room opens. He stands out of the way in the corner while a Trainee Healer in bright purple robes runs a series of diagnostic tests on Malfoy, presumably understanding the series of faint lights emitted above Malfoy's body as she takes notes. She leaves without waking Malfoy and Harry follows her out the door.
"'M'sorry I snapped," Harry says after a long while.
Harry, entire Saviour and general golden boy, came bounding up the stairs a moment later. As always Harry was perfectly in character: his green eyes were wide, and he appeared dreadfully flustered. “Whatever’s wrong?” Harry asked, casting his eyes everywhere around the room, searching for a problem to be solved. “Is something wrong with the baby? Do we need to Floo to St Mungo’s?”
"Hullo again," he says, sweet and cheerful.
Draco swung around to face his co-parent. Bloody Harry and his high-mindedness! “Salazar!” Draco hissed, shaking his head heatedly, “Frobisher’s? Near Diagon Alley? It’s
There were other faces that Draco recognised. Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan stood somewhere green, laughing into the camera, chinking their glasses together. Neville Longbottom, looking far more beardy that Draco remembered him, stood outside one of the Hogwarts Greenhouses. Merlin, but there were even pictures of Hagrid, his hair greyer nowadays, but otherwise every bit as scruffy as he’d ever been.
Greg was silent for a minute. He fiddled with the label of his bottle, tearing off little strips before he cleared his throat. “I read the
Fortunately, his morning sickness – though why it was called morning sickness, when it happened every hour Merlin sent – was starting to lessen. Unfortunately, it had been replaced with an insatiable need to pee every hour. Draco spent his hours reading, watching Muggle movies – and crying at the sad bits – and wearing a hole in the carpet between his settee and the bathroom.
"Do you always ask questions to which the answers are immediately apparent?"
Draco couldn’t control his shakes, and he felt himself quiver all over. He’d come like this; come with Harry’s mouth on his penis. He knew he would. He was already close.
Harry still thinks
After the quilt expedition Malfoy appoints himself Harry's personal shopper and flat decorator.
“You’re absolutely sure?” Draco asked doubtfully, sitting down gingerly on the bed. Courtesy had been learnt at his mother’s knee, and it felt very difficult to shake off. The idea of a twenty-minute nap, however, did feel very appealing and the mattress was very soft. He masked a yawn with the palm of his hand. “I don’t want to be ill-mannered.”
“Hey, Draco,” Other Harry says. “Furniture or kissing?”
"All-righting?"
"You really didn't need to bring so many," Harry says.
Malfoy looks at him speculatively, like maybe he too is trying to find the right words to not hurt Harry and Harry likes the thought, thinks maybe it's a good sign. He shuffles his feet a little closer and rests his cheek against Malfoy's shoulder. Harry's nose is just about even with the dip between Malfoy's clavicles and he takes advantage of this fact by kissing that small soft space.
