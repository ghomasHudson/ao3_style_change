With slower movements than a 150 year old wizard, Harry rolled himself out of bed and into the shower. He let the hot water unknot his muscles, simply standing under the spray as his skin took on a rosy-pink hue from the heat, and he continued to stand there until the water ran cool.
charm in our less-sson that it was - was like this translucent sil-silvery blue. Almost - almost like the color of a faded pa-patronus. But m-m-mine didn’t look like that.” A look of panic at the admittance flashed across her face. “Mine was more white, with flashes and swirls of other colors. Like a - like a rainbow.”
Hermione let out a long sigh sigh beside him, drawing Harry’s attention back from his thoughts. “Harry, I’m going to go notify Draco. I’ll be back in just a moment.” However, before Hermione could get up from her chair, Harry was tightly gripping her hand, trying to hold her in place.
Snape’s deep baritone, edged in scorn, cut through the relative silence that had fallen around them. “Somehow this is your fault.”
Pushing through the protesting of his body at simply having to move, Harry pushed himself up, careful to not put any further weight on the man below him and began to quickly shove away the smaller debris surrounding the pair. What felt like a lifetime later, Harry finally moved one last small broken board, his eyes instantly falling to Snape’s battered face.
Shrugging into his winter cloak and looping a warm, gray scarf around his neck, he left his quarters and headed down to the quad. Today was the first Hogsmeade weekend that Harry was chaperoning and he had the pleasure of chaperoning with Snape of all people. Not that Harry minded of course and he sensed that Snape didn’t actually mind either as much as he tried to deny it.
That comment hung heavy in the air until Minerva leveled a steady gaze at both men. “Powerful indeed, but do either of you have any thoughts on how neither of you are dead right now?” she asked bluntly.
“Harry! Severus!” Poppy nearly squawked as her head snapped up from the parchment in her hands having heard heard the hex leave Harry’s lips, certain that Snape should not be taking any type of hex at this juncture, however minor. However, Snape just ignored her, instead continuing to stare intently at Harry.
Snape’s dark stare held Harry in place, his voice a deadly calm as he spoke. “Potter, I was a Death Eater and a spy for nearly as long as you have been alive. Targets on my back are nothing new.”
Harry could swear he saw a shine in the woman’s eyes as if she were holding back tears. He didn’t have long to study them though because Minerva quickly pulled Harry into a tight, motherly hug. The gesture made Harry drop Snape’s hand as he moved to press it lightly to the woman’s back, trying to give her some sense of comfort.
Glancing over to where Snape sat, back against the rubble the pair had been buried under and dark eyes glaring at the Auror trying trying to check him over, Harry sighed in defeat knowing that Ron was right. “Alright. Do me a favor though. Don’t let Hermione tell Draco,” Harry requested quietly, knowing Ron would tell Hermione about the events of the day as soon as possible seeing as Harry, curses and near-death experiences were all involved. “He has enough to worry about right now. I’ll floo him tonight once everything is settled.”
The girl smiled brightly in return, presumably at Harry remembering her. “Yes, sir. Novalee Bishop. I just forgot one of my note sheets after class.” She motioned to the table she had occupied a short time ago and sure enough, a small piece of parchment was still on the top. “I apologize for interrupting you.” A light blush rose on her cheeks.
“Now off you go,” Harry said, dismissing the class with a wave and carefree smile at the bunch. The students packed themselves up and left the room with a practiced efficiency and a few cheerful ‘goodbyes’ called out on the way to their next class and soon Harry was alone. He moved around the desk to take a seat in his chair, opening one of the textbooks in front of him to start going over the notes for his next class -- the fifth year Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs.
Dark eyes blinked a few times while Snape tried to orient himself through his lingering daze from unconsciousness. “Poppy -” the name was slowly enunciated, “- why does it feel...as if my face...is tingling?” Snape asked, his voice sounding even deeper and rougher than normal.
from what she told us, so part of the intent had to be protecting Snape and I.” He paused, shaking his head briefly hoping the action would magically slot everything into place in his head but knowing there was no chance of that. “But something else had to be there too since any shield spell I have ever heard of before is worthless against the killing curse -- and that one clearly was anything but,” his hand flipping between Snape and himself as proof of the statement.
Snape held up his hand to stem any further questioning from the woman for the moment, shifting his attention instead to the mediwitch now standing between the two bed, hands on her hips and disapproval clearly evident in her features. “One moment, Minerva. Poppy, would you mind if I sent a very mild tickling hex at you.”
was a active medical class charm. Those types of charms should never be able to be be blocked. The medical charms were created specifically that way, the wand movements and enunciation very deliberately woven together so that as long as the person was still alive, the charms should have some impact.
Snape’s dark eyes bore into Harry’s and had this been another time, Harry may have actually been intimidated. But as it were, he was exhausted and couldn’t find it within himself to be cowed by the still-prickly man. “In my defense, it worked didn’t it?” he bit out.
With another, gentler push from Minky, Harry decided it would be easier to not argue with the small creature and returned to his place on the sofa, but not before first stopping to select a book from his shelves since he wouldn’t be getting any classwork done after all. The cushion sunk around him as he situated himself and opened the heavy book in his lap, beginning to read Anatolus Anatoly’s
Harry felt himself frown as soon as Draco mentioned the other Healer’s name. “Anderson is still out to get you?”
Taking a chance to open his eyes, Harry snapped them shut again as he hissed in pain at the bright sunlight assaulting his vision, making his head spin viciously. Trying again, knowing he needed to understand what happened and find Snape, he opened his eyes again, this time slowly cracking them open to adjust to the daylight. Once they were fully opened, he was happy to find that his glasses were still on his face and intact. Thank Merlin for small favors.
Also, for what it is worth, I'm not writing them both pregnant for the hell of it (read: to feed my MPREG obsession). I have actual reasons that we'll get to outside of my admitted love of pregnant Harry and pregnant Snape.
It was Snape’s turn to answer this time, weariness clear in his voice. “Minerva, I can tell you that by the time I made it to my chambers, I wasn’t up to much logical or conscious thought at that point. I may have a very high threshold for pain, but there is only so much one can ignore before the act of ignoring becomes unbearable itself. It was easier to simply allow my body to succumb to the pain.”
It astonished Harry that with as many people as were milling about Hogsmeade, no one saw the person. “What about a magical trace? I felt the Dark magic. There had to be some trace of it left,” the frustration clearly evident in his voice.
This blast pulsed outwards, shattering the side wall of the Three Broom Sticks, burying Harry and Snape under the debris, and knocking down students and other patrons throughout the street with the shockwave. Novalee fell back at the force as well, a scream escaping her lips as all hell broke loose in the street.
It was if Harry’s name passing his lips was the last fissure needed to break the dam holding back Draco’s emotions. “Why the bloody hell didn’t you tell me you were attacked? You clearly aren’t bound to an infirmary bed, so I can only assume you are still capable of a floo call.” Draco’s hand were pulling at his short hair now as the desperation and frustration and crippling
Harry let out a rushed breath of pure relief as Snape’s eyes slowly blinked open. “Thank Merlin! Can you sit up?” Harry asked, quickly looking around to see if he had enough room to help the other man up into a better position. There wasn’t a lot of room, but Harry pushed a few more boards out of the way and helped as best he could get the other man upright. “How do you feel?”
. This is technically considered an offensive spell since it incapacitates your opponent, but was still suggested as a defensive action and would serve that purpose brilliantly, preventing your opponent from cursing you by temporally taking away their ability to move, giving you ample time to further disarm and subdue them. What this shows is that defensive magic, what we will be studying this course, is made up of many different parts. There is no one set type of spell class that is the only thing considered ‘defensive’. Defensive magic includes both spells that do have a sole purpose of protecting the caster with little to no other ill-effects on the opponent, as well as offensive spells used to neutralize a threat. ‘The best defense is a good offense’ as the Muggles would say.”
“I...you’re....no, it can’t be.” Poppy just shook her head and then her wand as if that will miraculously change the outcome before running the charms once more, certain that something wasn’t correct.
“Yes, unfortunately. I overheard him talking to Maribelle, one of the Medi-witches up in Spell Damage, that ‘the Death Eater scum wasn’t worth the air he breathed’. Wasn’t too hard to guess who they were talking about on staff,” Draco scoffed. “I always suspected it with the schedules and rotations Anderson gave me, but now I at least have it confirmed that he’d prefer me rotting in Azkaban or more preferably dead.”
In a somewhat rare display of brotherly affection between the pair, Ron pulled Harry into a tight embrace. “I don’t know, mate, but I’m happy you still are. We can figure out the rest later.”
Shuffling out of the bedroom and into the kitchenette, Harry turned on the kettle and started the tea steeping short moments later. The rich spice was welcoming as he grabbed the mug gently between his hands and inhaled the warm, comforting smell.
Cradling the mug to ensure he wouldn’t spill, Harry shuffled his way over to the sofa, allowing himself to sink into the warn leather. Since he had a bit of quiet time before Draco would be returning after his shift, Harry figured he could work on reading through the research parchments for his advanced theory class, still not ready to try focusing back on unraveling yesterday’s events just yet.
With is eyes closed still, Harry finally paid attention to the other sounds around the room again, having pushed them out of his mind when he first awoken to the blinding light and white ceiling of the infirmary. Turning his head to the side, he finally cracked open his eyes to peer at the bed on his right, but he couldn’t see anything telling as Madame Pomfrey was standing between the two beds with her back to Harry, obscuring his view. Turning his head slowly back to Hermione in an effort to not make the throbbing worse, he asked, “Who’s that?”
“What are you doing here?” Harry asked, surprised to see his old friend at the staff table. “I didn’t know you were teaching this year.”
Harry felt a deep laugh bubbling up at the absurdity of the moment. Here was Snape, the bane of his younger years, complimenting him and sounding genuine, despite trying to come off otherwise. “Don’t sound so surprised, Snape. I never was the complete dolt you thought I was.” Quirking his eyebrow in a poor imitation of Snape himself, he studied the man and finally shook his head, hair falling into his eyes. “I should have known you would have been watching.”
“Just humor me, please? Your head is still bleeding and I would prefer if my co-Professor -” Harry smirked as Snape’s eye twitched at that statement, “- did not perish of blood loss.”
As the killing curse was absorbed, the bubble flashed in shades of green, going from dark to light before  the bubble pulsed once and broke apart around Harry and Snape. The bubble didn’t just dissolve away though. Instead, just as Novalee had mentioned earlier, it split into hundreds of ribbons in a rainbow of colors that swirled quickly around the two men, starting out farther from their bodies before swirling closer and closer until at the last moment the ribbons danced over them like silk flowing over the dips and curves of their bodies. It was then that the ribbons of magic dissolved straight into both men followed by a powerful burst of something - some sort magical force - centered in the pair.
a young child, which he steadfastly refused to do.Novalee studied Harry for a moment, as if she was reading more into his words than what was actually said. “Well if it matters, I think you did brilliant earlier! I’m really excited for this class.”
Harry sent a reassuring smile to Neville with a quick smirk shot over to the older man before standing. “Leaving so soon, Potter?” Snape inquired in his trademark deep drawl.
He then thought of a new memory, one of his happiest memories to date and called out the spell again. This time when his stag erupted from the tip of his wand, it glowed brightly and was nearly a solid silver form. Again, he let the animal prance around the room, nosing at different students until Harry cut off the spell again.
Moving quickly, Harry took a step closer to the man to see if he was alright, but a pale hand stopped him from getting closer. “Don’t,” Snape snarled out, his head resting in his hands. “Just give me your damn hand.”
“You’re done, Novalee. Go ahead to open your eyes.” Bright blue eyes blink open at Harry. “You did perfect,” he praised, smiling widely, receiving a tentative smile in return.
“Well, by the time I got back to my rooms from Minerva’s office, I felt like I had been trampled by a herd of scorned hippogriffs and that feeling unfortunately didn’t get any better after sleeping. I was nauseous and dizzy and it was like I could feel every nerve and fiber of my being.” An involuntary shiver ran rampant through Harry as he remember just how miserable he had felt. “I didn’t start feeling marginally better until a couple hours ago, although I wouldn’t claim to feel ‘good’ even now. I’m still exhausted and sore.”
Back in his rooms, he quickly changed into a pair of jeans and a well-worn jumper, putting away his books and class notes in the study. Casting a
With a glance at the older man, Harry asked, “Ready?” Snape just nodded curtly in return, but his hand tightened almost imperceptibly in Harry’s own. Before Harry and Snape could make their escape though, Minerva
“I’m fine Minky. Thank you.” As Harry spoke, he saw the elf’s large ears droop in distress at her assistance being refused, so he was quick to add, “I will be certain to call you as soon as I do need anything though.” That must have appeased the young elf as she soon nodded once and disappeared with another
“So nothing stands out? Nothing at all?” Poppy asked again, the frustration with the lack of any sort of substantial information to explain what happened to both men clear in her voice.The room was silent, waiting on either man to speak. It was Harry that broke the silence with another small shrug. “Nothing stands out at out of the ordinary, at least given the circumstances of the last day. However, I guess I didn’t feel...right today. Really since last night.”
Snape let out a nearly undignified snort at Harry’s comment. “Of course I would. I need to know if you are adequately preparing them for my course. You have done, dare I say, passable.”
Leaving Snape to further theorize or whatever he was actually doing, Harry turned his attention back to Hermione and Neville, content to just sit back and listen to their friendly debate on the pollination habits of several rare plants Neville had been researching in the Amazon. As they continued to talk, the words became a soft buzz in Harry’s ears as he let his mind wander, flitting idly from one random thought to another.
Poppy once again reminded both men that they are to stay in bed until she says otherwise before retreating to the other side of the room where a couple open chairs are, Minerva following closely behind her. After that, the room slipped into a relative quite with only hushed voices in easy conversation creating a soft murmur bouncing off the walls.
Raising his wand to set the room to rights, the spell was on the tip of his tongue but Harry stopped himself before he could utter the words, the room before him a glaring reminder that his last attempt hadn’t worked out so well for him. Maybe his magic was suffering lingering after effects from the attack yesterday, just like his body. Deciding he better not risk all the parchments becoming confetti, Harry called for Minky.
“I am really just Harry Potter, a normal man with a not so normal past that surprisingly fell in love with magical theory and spell crafting who would like to share that passion and knowledge with all of you.” He paused for a moment, grabbing his cup and taking another quick drink.
If you happened to miss the MPREG tag and that isn't your thing, you probably want to turn back now.
As Poppy continued her diagnostics, Snape’s eyes fluttered open at the same time a deep, pained moan escaped his lips. “Good to see you awake, Severus,” Poppy commented as she quickly summoned a blood replenishing potion, pressing it into Snape’s limp hand. “Drink.”
The young girl was crying softly as Minerva ushered her into her office, staring at her feet that scuffled along the stone floor. She paused for a moment as the door shut behind her before lifting her head just enough to look around the room, her eyes landing on Harry and going wide before she sobbed out a broken, “Professor Potter!”
“Piss off, Snape,” Harry shot back with a grateful smile, happy that some things about the man had not changed, mainly his snark.
As I've mentioned before, but it deserves to be mentioned again and shouted from rooftops, you are all the best! Thank you for taking a chance on this story and sticking with me so far :D
Sitting up a bit straighter in her chair, she cleared her throat, the action reminding Harry a bit of Hermione. “Sir, a patronus is commonly used as a defense to repel dementors, which suck the happiness from a person. So if you are holding to a happy memory, they cannot feed off of you properly.”
“You’ll live,” she proclaimed. “Although don’t you even think about moving a muscle, Severus. You lost quite a bit of blood from that head wound and until I’m satisfied that you are as in best possible health given the circumstances, you are staying put.” She leveled a hard glare at the man before turning her attention to Harry. “Lay back, Harry dear.” He complied without complaint, too tired to put up any sort of fight even if he had wanted to, settling himself against the pillows.
It was Snape that spoke up. “Now, I think we need to look at the memory. I have never heard of a shield react the way that Ms. Bishop described. That is just not how standard shields function.”
Harry heard his name called moments before a warm hand fell upon his shoulder. “How are you settling in?”
Morning would come soon enough and he needed his wits about him to survive his first day of classes tomorrow.
“Humor me,” he deadpanned. “Please run any medical charm you can think of, even ones that seem unlikely to outright impossible. There must to be something we are missing to explain the lack of effectiveness of the active magic. The more passive magic -- the diagnostic charms -- appear to be working perfectly fine, but something is blocking the more active magic -- the magic tied to spells and charms and hexes meant to cause a physical reaction in the body.”
“Madame Pomfrey thinks that both your episodes are related to the spells yesterday,” Hermione added almost as an afterthought, answering the question Harry had been trying to string words together on his uncooperative tongue to ask. He simply nodded slowly in return. It would make sense. Thinking rationally, there was still too much that they didn’t understand about the magic that was created when all the spells -- old and new -- converged, let alone when that magic was absorbed into both himself and Snape right before the burst of magical energy seen in the memory.
Not one to mince words, Minerva continued as handed over the cups. “Now, I will tell you what I know after talking to Mr. Weasley and then I would like you to both be here when we meet with one of the students. I had already talked to Mr. Simon’s myself earlier today, but he wasn’t able to really provide much insight outside of what we already knew.
Well that was one less thing for Harry to worry about this morning. He had planned to have house integration as an important part this course, but the students had already taken that out of his hands.
Morning had indeed come quickly and before Harry knew it, he was showered, dressed, finished with breakfast and waiting in his classroom nursing a cup of strong coffee -- surprisingly Draco’s influence after the man developed a taste for the dark brew while balancing late night shifts at St. Mungo’s and studying.
This chapter seriously did not want to be written -- to the point that I rewrote parts of it more times than I really care to admit. So I apologize for the epic delay in updating, but I wanted to get the chapter to a point that I was mostly satisfied with. Hopefully the scenes came out well enough.
“What does this mean?” Minerva’s voice cut in from near the end of Snape’s bed, having followed Poppy over when the exchange of hexes began, her gaze shifting between both men. “Severus?”
Poppy looked around at the other faces in the room, but everyone aside from Snape appeared just as uncertain as she was for where this demonstration would be heading. Deciding to trust the man she had known for countless years, she gave a quick nod and a quiet, “I suppose,” before beginning to giggle like a schoolgirl moments later, Snape having wordlessly cast the jinx.
Looking over, Harry saw Snape smirking at him. This is one thing that Harry still wasn’t used to though; this new  side of his old Potions professor. The man was no longer the hard-faced, dour, spiteful man that Harry grew up knowing. The war had changed him, just like it had changed everyone. But for Snape, in his mind he hadn’t been meant to survive, and yet here he was. Nagini’s bite had nearly cost him his life, but he managed to escape death and that experience irrecoverably changed the man both physically and emotionally. He was no where near a warm and fuzzy teddy bear of a man like Hagrid, but he had softened too, much to Harry’s astonishment.
“He slapped you well and good across the face, Professor,” Neville clarified from the end of Harry’s bed where he was still sitting, safely out of direct striking distance.
In all honesty, the memory stirred more questions than answered for Harry, his mind whirling as he tried and failed to put the pieces together. Casting a glance to Snape to see how he was fairing, Harry noted the slight pinch of the man’s lips, which he had come to associate with Snape’s concentration face. “You have that look, Snape. What are you thinking?”
The room before him was glowing in a soft yellow from the sconces on the wall, which he had earlier charmed to light whenever he entered the quarters. The glow was heightened by the fire crackling in the hearth, its warmth eclipsing the slight chill that had settled in the early September night air. With a wave of his hand, grateful for his knack at wandless magic, he reset the wards and added a silencing charm for good measure out of habit. Shrugging out of his robe, he hung it on the hook beside the door, bending down to remove his boots before setting them below the robe and then surveyed the room in greater focus.
He managed though, but would not have succeeded without surprising help in the form of one Severus Snape. As the Defense and Spell Theory course was intended to be a companion course to Defense Against the Dark Arts, the practical course which Snape had been teaching since he returned two years prior, the pair had to work closely to ensure the compatibility of their course structures and materials.
“And you also realize you have never been able to lie to me, right?” Harry asked with a crooked grin at Hermione’s minor discomfort at his questioning. Harry knew she was checking up on him and thinking about it, he was actually surprised it took her this long.
“I agree,” Minerva cut in, taking the vial with the memory from Snape and walking over to the pensieve in the corner of the room. She poured the blue wisps of memory into the bowl before looking back up. “Harry, Severus, shall we?” The two men nodded, getting up from their chairs and walking over to the Headmistress. A moment later, all three were diving into the memory before them.
“Well, everything looks fairly normal,” Poppy remarked, studying the resulting numbers and figures on the parchment floating in front of her. “Both of your magic levels are fluctuating a bit, but not to a dangerous point that I think we would need to intervene and not really any more then they were yesterday right after the attack.” With a practiced flick of her wrist, the mediwitch sent the parchment flying into her office be placed in the appropriate files. Tucking her wand back into her apron, Poppy turned her attention back to the two men occupying the beds. “Now, do either of you remember anything?”
The Headmistress paused for a moment, readying herself for the last announcement she had to make, knowing all attention on her would be lost momentarily. “With that said, please welcome Professor Potter who has graciously agreed to oversee this new course.” At that, the hall erupted in chatter and cheers, with more than a few students stunned to silence, openly gaping at Harry as he sat among the other professors as if they hadn’t noticed him sitting there all along.
sounding from some corner of his chambers and no parchment to be seen. Setting his mug on the side table with a furrowed brow, Harry gingerly got up from the sofa and made his way towards the room currently serving as his private office.
, Harry thought as he looked back over to the other bed, his heart rate jumping with worry for Snape as he seemed worse off than Harry seeing as Poppy was intently focused on the man. Harry’s mind was whirling. It was too coincidental that they both ended up here again after everything they went through yesterday, right?
, Harry thought. Odd, and disconcerting that the spell was having absolutely no affect on rousing the man. Curiosity (and worry) got the better of Harry. He needed to know what was going on. “Poppy?”
“The only thing I would change for what Miss Bishop stated is that the patronus works to repel a dementor, not necessarily because the dementor cannot feed off of the happy memory you are holding to, but because a patronus is not a living entity. A patronus is purely positive emotion with no ability to feel negative emotions and thus a dementor has no power over it. So the happier the memory, the more powerful the patronus and the greater the repelling force. Now watch.”
Pulling back, Ron looked Harry over once more with a critical eye, noticing the myriad of small cuts and angry bruises forming along his friend’s face and neck before disappearing under his shirt. “Look, you need to go get checked out.”
Harry felt his blood boil, just like it did every time that Draco let slip that Healer Anderson was making his life miserable. The other man tried to pretend that it didn’t bother him, but Harry could see past the pretenses and see the hurt flash across Draco’s features. But Harry had long given up threatening to use his fame to get slimy man sacked as Draco would turn him down time and time again and Harry was not dumb enough to bring the blonde’s wrath down upon himself by going behind Draco’s back.
“And finally, as we continue to reform the Hogwarts curriculum, I am pleased to announce that we are adding a new course this year -- Defense and Spell Theory. This course will be a requirement for all first through fifth years and taught as a companion course to Defense Against the Dark Arts. You will find this course appropriately on your time tables which your house Prefects will pass out after the feast. For the older students, there will be an advanced elective of this course if you so choose. If interested, please see your head of house as they can further discuss the course requisites and assist you with scheduling.”
Harry let his mind wander for just a few moments more before dragging himself off the floor and into his study.
“Correct! Five points to Gryffindor. While I was able to cast two corporeal patronuses, the differing level of positive emotion behind them was evident. The first, while visible was still very weak and would have been little defense against a dementor for long, let alone several at once. The second though was much more powerful, the shape more solid, due to the increased positive emotion I put behind it -- the happier the memory. So you see, knowing what a spell does is one thing, but understanding the theory behind the deeper purpose and overall spell formula can help to change the effectiveness and in the end, mastery, of it.”
“Now Severus, what does this mean?” Minerva asked again, but this time her tone left little room for argument or further delay.
!” Harry could see the spell hit Snape square in the chest, a sizzling red light streaking from the wand tip, but nothing happened -- not even the slightest twitch.
I do apologize for the bit of a cliffhanger, but I didn't like ending it at any of my other possible points.
He looked up to see that the students were being led out of the Great Hall by the Prefects with many of the professors slowly following behind to either their personal quarters or the house common rooms for those assigned as heads of house. Harry watched as Snape walked away with the crowd, presumably to the Slytherin common room to cover the start of term house notices, his robes billowing behind him the same way they had years prior.
With one last squeeze, Minerva pulled back and raised her hand to gently pat Harry’s cheek as if to reassure herself yet again that the boy was still here. Once she was satisfied with Harry, she turned to Snape and to Harry’s delight, the woman pulled Snape into the same tight hug. The other man’s eyes went wide at the contact, but he made the same small gesture as Harry had, gently patting the woman’s back as she held on tightly.
“Hiya, Harry,” the tall man responded with a wide, happy smile, clapping Harry on the shoulder before sitting.
Harry opened his eyes and looked up at the woman through the fringe of hair falling over his face. “I have no clue. Everything is a blur in my head after I heard the spell. All I -”
though told Harry he was better off going to sleep and not bothering his boyfriend at the late hour.
“I had a similar experience. The best I could describe the sensation I experienced would be a dulled but constant
Time passed in that odd way it does when you’re stuck somewhere you would rather not be, where it feels like hours have passed when in reality it had merely been just a few minutes. At some point, Harry cannot honestly be sure when, Neville came in with a nervous smile, although making himself comfortable at the foot of Harry’s bed. After a few questions making sure Harry was relatively fine, or as fine as could be, he fell into quite conversation with Hermione.
“We don’t know much yet, Poppy, but there are a few students that I plan to question,” Minerva interrupted, hear voice carrying through the large room as she swept through the infirmary doors, her facial features hard as she surveyed the scene in front of her.
Harry rolled his eyes at the backhanded compliment. Only Snape could praise you and try to cut your ego to ribbons at the same time. “I appreciate the vote of confidence, sir.”
Knowing Snape could change his mind at any minute, Harry stood up, the blood rushing through his legs and held his hand out for Snape. The other man eyed it suspiciously and didn’t make any move to grab it. Instead, Snape attempted to pull himself up alone, but only made it a few inches off the ground where he had been sitting before a wave of dizziness hit him hard, knocking him back down.
Harry gently squeezed the fingers that were back in his grasp. “‘s okay, ‘Mione.” And it was. From what he remembered, fuzzy as his memory was, there was most likely little else anyone could have done in the situation. Even he didn’t have any clue he had been about to pass out.
While, Harry had gotten used to waking up alone more days than not since the school year started, he still wished this morning could have been different after, well, after everything. But he chose not to dwell on that fact, mainly because even thinking hurt right then, the inside of his skull throbbing with each beat of his heart.
Pushing that thought away -- he would evidently have time to theorize about that later -- Harry focused again.
At this point though, all Harry wanted to do was get out of his clothes that still displayed dirt and flecks of debris as proof of the day’s events, down a vat of pain potion (or a more reasonable vial), and fall into his bed for the foreseeable future -- the rest could wait until the morning.
Magic tickled against Harry’s palm as he waited for the wards to recognize him and the door of his chambers to swing open. Harry was exhausted, the events of the day weighing heavy in his bones and sore to the point that even his hair hurt, the deep ache having steadily increased throughout the evening, his prior pain potions from Poppy long worn off.
charm has a goal of producing a corporeal patronus is one thing, but understanding that at even a very base level, the charm itself means ‘I await a guardian’ helps to build the knowledge of the purpose behind the charm -- to produce a protective force. Diving deeper than that, the charm only works by the caster thinking of their happiest memories. Does anyone know why?”
Things did not go as Harry intended though. Instead of the papers gently floating into Harry’s outstretched hand, there was a muffled
Harry did as requested, being as gentle as possible as he maneuvered the dead weight that was Snape in his passed out state. He did want to cause any more damage to the man than had already been inflicted that day. With a final grunt, Harry deposited Snape fully onto the infirmary bed before he stumbled backwards from the effort, the back of his legs hitting the bed behind him and causing Harry to sink heavily down onto the mattress, his balance shot.
“Right now though, we are going to leave the dirty work, as the Muggles say, to the Aurors, although I want you both to stay vigilant. There are still too many unanswered questions, although I do feel that our students and school are safe at this time.” Minerva paused a moment, taking a deep, steadying breath before continuing, “Our bigger issue right now is figuring out what happened. I am more relieved than either of you can imagine that you are not, at this moment, dead. However, with events like this, the unknown of how you survived an attack like that is almost as worrisome as the actual attack itself. With the level of magic hanging around Hogsmeade after the attack and the recollections of the events I have heard so far, I’m a bit concerned that neither of you are actually displaying any -- unusual -- side-effects.” Minerva’s words echoed Harry’s own concerns that had taken up residence in his mind since he pulled himself for the pile of rubble hours earlier.
“D-Draco?” Harry licked his lips nervously. “What are you doing here?” he asked, his voice shaking slightly with nerves or exhaustion or a combination of the two as he watched his boyfriend carefully. Draco didn’t move though. Or speak. He just sat stony-still in the armchair, eyes frighteningly narrowed, his face giving nothing away.
Turning, Harry saw a familiar shade of red towering about the other heads of the crowd. “Ron!” he shouted, standing up from his post in front of Snape and taking a few quick steps towards his friend before swaying violently on his feet, his sense of balance momentarily shot.
Fortunately, Poppy returned before Harry could argue further, so he pushed Snape’s comment to the side and focused on what Poppy was saying as she handed over several potion vials, more than ready to be out of the infirmary.
Neville gaped at the older man, surprised by Snape’s sudden appearance and apparently still intimidated the man. Trying to break the sudden tension at Snape’s appearance, Harry spoke up. “Don’t mind him. His bark has become much worse than his bite. Don’t let him try to fool you.”
him, did you?”Another laugh bubbled up from Harry at Draco’s reaction. “Kiss my ass, dear,” Harry replied, flipping the other man off for his remark.
Hermione mulled Harry’s word over before giving a curt nod in return, her thumb gently rubbing the back of Harry’s hand until his tight grip loosened. “Okay, Harry. ” She didn’t necessarily like Harry’s request, but she could respect it.
“Yup. I have a date with my floo. Don’t miss me too much.” Harry winked at Snape, internally cheering at the look that crossed Snape’s face and the light blush coloring the man’s cheeks at the comment. Not giving the man time to come up with a retort, he bid goodbye once more and escaped the Great Hall.
Finally looking up from the results, first looking at Harry first and then Severus and then back to the parchment before her. “You’re pregnant.” The statement would be so unbelievable -- so impossible -- for the mediwitch if there weren’t four back-to-back scans to prove otherwise. “Both of you.” She looked between the two men once more, eyes then falling to the parchment grasped tightly in her hands once more. “But it can’t be. Wizards can’t get pregnant.”
Everything then snapped into place as the fog suddenly cleared in his head, setting in a bone-deep panic. Someone had cursed them! Hell, not just any curse by a fucking
After that, Hermione kept up a string of quiet, mostly one-sided conversation, whether out of anxiety or just to pass the time, while never letting go of his hand. Harry took comfort in the warm grasp, knowing that the contact was as much meant as reassurance for him as it was for Hermione.
“Harry,” a breathy voice called and soon Hermione was coming into almost-focus over him. “How do you feel?” the words rushed past her lips as she squeezed his hand.
Surprisingly Snape didn’t argue. He just kept the fabric pressed tightly against his head, eyes slowly surveying the scene around them. “What happened?”
Continuing to focus solely on the young girl in his lap, Harry spoke as softly and reassuringly as possible. “Would you be willing to give us your memory so that we can look at it a bit closer, Novalee? That way we can see what all happened to help make sense of things.” She nodded in assent without hesitation, although a small tear escaped down her cheek.
While Harry had been helping Snape drink, Poppy had moved closer to the edge of Snape’s bed, eyeing the man over once more with a critical eye. “I’m very happy to see you awake, Severus.”
“I’m not even late, Snape,” Harry countered, pointing to the giant clock above them. “The students were scheduled to leave until 10 and it is three minutes to. You’re just impatient.”
The picture on the right side was of him and Draco, sneakily taken by Ginny at Ron and Hermione’s wedding the year prior. The men had snuck out into the orchard to get away from the noise and press of bodies for just a few moments. They had found themselves by the old willow tree near the edge of the Weasley property and had taken a moment to snog each other senseless. Unbeknownst to them though, Ginny had quietly followed the pair and snapped the picture before sneaking just as quietly away.
At first, the woman was silent, eyeing the pair with a practiced eye. Soon however, her stony features cracked and her face flooded with warmth as relief washed over her at seeing the two men still relatively in one piece. “Thank the Gods you are both alright!”
“Welcome to another year at Hogwarts and an especially warm welcome all first years. I do hope that you find your time here educational but memorable all the same,” the Headmistress greeted the room with a warm smile, standing in front of her chair at the head table. Since the end of the war and officially taking her post as Headmistress, Minerva McGonagall had softened, for lack of a better term.
The trio held their breath as the memory continued to unfold before them. The moment that Novalee’s spell and the killing curse collided, it was as if everything stood still, frozen in time. Novalee’s spell surrounded the pair in a bubble, much like a standard shield, but unlike a standard shield the bubble was opaque, obscuring Harry and Snape from view.
Ron chimed in again. “I will fill you in with all the details that I know in a moment, Headmistress. The short version is someone sent the killing curse at them. We are still trying to work out all the details.”
Not long after, a quiet shuffle against the stone floor alerted him to a new presence in the room. Looking up, he saw the small blond girl from his second year class. “Miss Bishop, correct?”
Bringing her wand around, she began the same scans over Harry with a practiced focus. He closed his eyes as the gentle warmth of the magic soaked comfortingly into his skin. “How are either of you alive?” she eventually ask in astonishment, dropping her wand arm down once the scans finished, her eyes flicking between both men as the implication of Harry’s prior words came back to her.
It surprised many, Harry most of all, that he found a passion for spell crafting and defense theory as opposed to practical application after the war, but it was true. Understanding how different magical elements -- magical energy, language of origin, intent, nature of crafting and so on -- could be combined in the creation of a spell and analyzing how one small
Draco must have finally seen the pure exhaustion that Harry was sure was written all over his face and for that, Harry let out a small sigh of relief. “Fine, but you have a lot of explaining to do tomorrow, Potter,” his tone soft as he spoke, the undercurrent of worry still clearly behind the words contradicting the request. Draco’s thumbs gently rubbed along the lines of Harry’s jaw, running slowly and softly over the scabs and stubble. Harry leaned into the touch, letting it be the calm comfort he so desperately wanted in that moment.
“Can we just leave it at that for now?” Harry pleaded, feeling like he was edging closer and closer to collapsing on his feet at any moment.
“Theory is an important part of any discipline because understanding the why and how behind a concept often makes the application and mastery easier. For example, knowing that the
“Look at you being all prepared. I thought you were a Gryffindor, love. I didn’t know you knew the meaning of being prepared.” Even through the flames Harry could see the playful glint in the other man’s eyes and the underlying pride and pure love Draco had for Harry. That look did funny things to Harry’s insides and made his cheeks rapidly flush.
The Headmistress gently squeezed his shoulder. “We are very happy to have you back, Harry. I did want to inform you that each professor is assigned a personal house elf to assist them with whatever they find necessary, be that meals or cleaning in your quarters, assistance with delivery of items to other staff members and so on. Minky has been assigned to you, so just call for her if you need anything at all.”
Stepping carefully out into the foggy room, he toweled dry and shuffled his way back to the bedroom, pulling out a worn pair of jeans with holes at the knees and an equally worn oversized jumper. Comfort. That’s all he wanted right about now.
“With that out of the way, you should know that the goal of this course will be two-fold. Firstly it will be to discuss in detail the actual theory behind and magical structure of spells related to their application with a special focus on defensive magic. Secondly, and what I am most excited to share with you all, it will be to learn to analyze how the intent placed behind a spell can change the overall outcome, sometimes even taking a normally harmless spell and making it quite destructive. With this information, you will all put your studies to practical use in Defense Against the Dark Arts with Professor Snape, so do try to make me proud,” Harry said with a playful wink in the general direction of the class and in return he did see a few students quickly blushing scarlet. “Now, lets see what you all remember from last year. Can anyone tell me why spell theory would be so important?”
Poppy was standing next to Snape’s bed, but her eyes were glued to Harry as he sat slumped forward on his bed, elbows on knees. “What happened, Harry?” she asked with an urgent, no-nonsense edge to her voice. “I do not want to risk running any diagnostics on either of you just yet until I know what I’m dealing with.”
Frustrated beyond measure, Harry tried to focus on his surrounding for a moment. He still had a heavy weight bearing down against his back. It was solid and did not feel like a body pining him down, so Harry didn’t believe that to be Snape. No, it felt too stiff, almost like heavy boards or something as equally sturdy. But how could that be? What actually happened?
Poppy’s hands smoothed over her apron in thought as she took in Harry’s words before turning her attention to the other bed. “Hmmm, Severus? What about you?”
Ron looked at Harry again, clearly weighing his options and knowing that Draco really should be notified -- the pair were as good as bonded if you asked him -- but in the end giving in to his best friend’s wishes. “Sure thing. But I’m blaming you if he comes knocking down my floo threatening to hex my bollocks off because he wasn’t notified since he
so she could be heard over the cacophony of the students, the Headmistress bellowed, “Quiet! Quiet everyone!” It took a few moments, but once the volume in the hall lessened to a satisfactory level for the woman, she finally said in a lower volume, “Let the feast begin.”
Harry watched as Snape’s eyes flicked to Hermione before quickly locking back with his own. “Undoubtedly. There was already a strong shield cast by Mr. Simon surrounding both Potter and I. We could see it quite clearly in the memories we reviewed last night. The spell that Ms. Bishop cast had to have mutated, for lack of a better term, the shield. When Potter and I absorbed the magic, merlin only knows what that mutation did as our bodies and magic took it in.” Turning back to the mediwitch who had been oddly silent through the exchange, Snape added, “Poppy, please rerun your charms.”
Looking back at the prone form of Snape and then to the distressed face of the mediwitch as she looked over the still unconscious man as well, a mad thought crashed over him. Carefully swinging his legs off the bed, Harry ignored the sputtering of Hermione behind him and Poppy beside him as he took the four short steps to get to the edge of Snape’s bed. Before really thinking better of it, Harry pulled his arm back and slapped the man’s face with a powerful
charm and misspoke in the moment. But that isn’t an incantation I have ever heard before and based on the how the spell reacted, that was new magic.” Snape shook his head, letting his astonishment clearly settle in his facial features. “Ms. Bishop will be a force to be reckoned with if she is creating new spells that powerful as a second year.”
Just as it was when Harry was a student, the trays and platters of overflowing food appeared before his eyes until the tables were groaning under the sheer weight piled atop them, delicious smells assaulting his nose. Oh, he had missed this. Hermione may hex him five ways to Sunday if she ever heard him admit this aloud, but nothing beat the Hogwarts elves’ cooking. Even Mrs. Weasley’s cooking didn’t hold a candle to the spread before him.
Harry laughed, not surprised that her password would be something feline related, just like Dumbledore’s was always very predictably sweets related. “Thank you, Headmistress.”
She ran forward as soon as the words were past her lips, falling into Harry’s lap and crying harder into his chest. “Shh, shh, Novalee. It’s alright,” Harry softly spoke to the girl, having recognized her the moment she looked up. He held her closely, rubbing her back in gentle slow circles, offering what little comfort he could provide to the young, distressed girl as he looked between Minerva and Snape’s solemn faces.
Nodding in agreement to Snape’s explanation, Harry added, “I don’t remember much of last night outside of finding Draco in my room and him putting me into bed, and even that is a bit hazy. This morning he gave me a pain potion, but like Snape said,” he paused, briefly flicking his eyes to the other man, “it felt easier to let my body and mind succumb to the pain and basically pass out for however long I needed. My head hurt too much, along with my body, to really consider any other option at the time.”
“O-o-okay,” she stammered out, slowly sliding off of his lap and taking a few steps towards the door. Pausing for a moment, Novalee looked around the room once more, here eyes going from Minerva to Snape and finally back to Harry. “I-I’m glad that you both are okay,” she finally said, voice hoarse, before she hurriedly made her way out the door.
Minerva blanched at the information. It took her several moments to regain her composure. Clearing her throat and looking directly at Harry, knowing the young man was more apt to listen to her, she said sternly, “Harry, Mimsy will be taking you and Severus directly to the infirmary. You both will let Poppy do a complete check of you both and you will not leave until I have come back to check on you both myself. Do you understand me?”
That, along with the sweep of Draco's breath on his skin, had Harry's heart pounding in his ears and the blood rushing southwards. Unlike before, Draco's eyes were darkened now. Dilated pupils and heavy breathing — far too reminiscent of Harry’s daydreams for comfort.
Ron threw his hands in the air. "Well clearly, this Dragon guy makes you lose all common sense so I can't—"
Without even realizing it, Harry's hand had shot onwards and was now squeezing one of Draco's over the countertop. Both of their eyes zeroed in on that small point of contact. Then Draco's silver orbs met Harry's own and it was Harry's turn to go loose-tongued.
With that resolution in mind, he chose the tightest white t-shirt he owned and put it on. It stretched a tad uncomfortably around his chest, but it also made his pecs look sharp. Harry was willing to endure it. '
It is as dark and mouldy as I remember from my childhood — when Mother made me attend her great-aunt Walburga's funeral — if not
The infiltrator had somewhat come to his senses by now, and was glaring weakly up at Harry with bloodshot eyes. He looked close to breaking.
. Frankly, Harry was just glad Draco hadn't heard his name from the news of his too-many-to-count arrests. That, again, Hermione had saved him from. Unimportant right now.
"I think it was last year," Hermione piped in, ever the perfect consigliere. "We went to that club to celebrate your birthday? You pulled a hot, long-haired guy in leather pants."
His men had chosen a dingy and evidently abandoned storehouse. Harry's expression crumpled in distaste, especially after getting inside and breathing into the stale air of the place. Looking around, it was just as mouldy and falling apart on the inside as it had seemed from the outside. The soldiers were already there.
"What about the shop downstairs?" was what came out of Harry's mouth next. Where was he going with this? Absolute dolt. "It's yours, right? Scorpius mentioned you having a shop."
The Weasleys were distantly related to the Potters, and had worked together for as long as they could remember. Their joined families called themselves '
"Hey, I hope y— Oh, the..." Draco trailed off. Harry whirled around to find the blond staring at the sparse dining table, then at the sink in surprise. Grey met green again shortly. "You didn't have to."
He detached his head from the top of Scorpius' and held him at arm's length to ask, "Do you know how late it is? Where were you? Daddy was so worried about you."
Harry eyed the weapon incredulously, then directed his stare at Ron. "You've got to be joking. I will not have a
displeasure, something that surely showed on his face. He grabbed his drink in order to ignore the lack of warmth. The lack of
"Where did you find Scorpius?" Draco asked after a while. Harry would have missed it if he hadn't been staring at the man's lips. "I asked him, but his answers were..."
The man of Harry's dreams blinked at his son, before stammering, "Umm... Sure. If— if he wants, I mean." Then he turned to Harry, "You're welcomed to join us."
a monster. A little boy with a backpack was wandering the inside of the storehouse like he owned the place, unconcerned about the murderous looking men staring at him.
The charged atmosphere dissipated immediately. Draco looked away, a faint pink tinting his ears. After silencing his phone, Harry cleared his throat and started walking away.
"It's okay, daddy. I was exploring and nice Mister bought me ice cream, so I brought him with me," Scorpius answered with a bright grin.
I step into the kitchen one morning to see Potter hovering over a pan, a look of concentration on his face. The whole situation is funny in itself because Potter
Harry was suddenly left alone as Scorpius dashed into the adjacent kitchen. Not that he minded. His eyes had landed on the subject of his recent daydreams. Harry's heart leaped to his throat.
He wanted to look absolutely riveting. Luckily, the evenings were much colder still, even in June, so Harry could wear his favourite leather jacket. He was going for a
' still on his lips, Harry stepped out of his shower to check himself out in the bathroom's mirror. His hair hung in wet ringlets over his forehead, dripping water. A little vigorous towelling and Sea Salt spraying later, it sat artfully messy on top of his head. When it came to shaving, Harry decided against it. That faint hint of stubble gave him a sexy look, in his
or something, cracking his knuckles soundly. "He's probably a spy from one of those pesty rival gangs. Let's ask him who he works for."
Even though he now had me stay in his house, that didn't stop from bringing his one-night stands over every other night. All Muggle men that he'd picked up at random gay bars and that he would Obliviate after.
I didn't feel anything special about it, but Potter's expression is one of hope and longing and I can't help myself. I seal our lips together again, more roughly this time.
By the end of the meal, Scorpius had started to yawn like he hadn't slept in years. Even Harry yawned a couple of times just by looking at him.
Should he just leave it to Ron and drive back to his house by himself? It was so tempting. Harry doubted he could think clearly when his brain was practically melting anyway.
, finally turned to look at Harry with shockingly silver eyes, and gave him a warm smile. Harry felt weak at the knees. Blondie was
to Draco. It was simple for the win. A pair of black jeans ripped at the knees, black leather boots and his father's wristwatch later, Harry deemed himself good to go. Hermione talked him out of wearing sunglasses, though.
... Harry could do that. He stepped out of the kitchen and found a large mahogany table situated in the middle of the dining space. Harry bet its hard surface would be ideal to sprawl a certain blond on.
Harry grimaced at the stains on the kid's face. He pulled a handkerchief from his pocket — one that he was glad wasn't covered in blood for once — and used it to wipe Scorpius' mouth area clean when he finished his ice cream.
If there was a kid that looked happier to be eating ice cream in a stranger's presence than Scorpius, Harry swore he would become a priest free of sin. The little guy was far too unbothered for his own good, sitting on a bench in the park in front of Fortescue's Parlour and swinging his tiny legs back and forth, getting ice cream all over his chin.

"It seems we aren't," replied Draco in a sombre voice. He wasn't sure why Harry was suddenly being so friendly.
They'd been working together for almost three years now but they'd always been assigned to different departments in the Ministry of Magic, with Harry being in the Auror Office, and Draco confined to the Hit Wizards.
“Come off it, Potter,” Draco said, the ghost of bitterness and pain shining in his silvery grey eyes. “Don't pretend like you haven't heard the rumours. That's well beneath you.”
And you of all people should know, Potter. I was a complete nightmare to you back in Hogwarts. I don't know how you ever put up with me. And I certainly don't deserve or expect your apology.”
“The ones where practically half the Ministry believes that I'm hatching some nefarious plot to exact revenge upon the Ministry for imprisoning my father? That I'm feeding my father inside information even though I haven't really spoken to him since he was imprisoned? That I'm planning to somehow resurrect Voldemort and raise an army of dementors?
Minerva’s mouth drew into a tight line. “The Aurors tried that, Harry. However, the magic was masked. They are trying to separate the mask from the underlying magical threads, but it seems the mask was more complex than anyone on site had ever seen, distorting the signature beyond any sort of recognition. It will take patience and time if they hope to unravel it.
that echoed through the infirmary, silently praying to whatever Gods were out there that Snape would forgive him the action.
Hermione’s eyes drifted to the other bed as she spoke. “Professor Snape. Apparently he collapsed too. Neville found him outside the Great Hall and brought him in right after I got you here.”
finally had an outlet. “Twelve bloody hours, Harry! Twelve bloody hours of no floo call...no owl...no damn patronus. At least I knew you weren’t dead or I would have been more out of my mind than I already was. Dear Merlin, I -” but the words died off and Draco was out of the chair and standing in front of Harry in a mere blink of an eye, his hands cradling Harry’s face as he turned it this way and that to catch the firelight, having finally noticed the disheveled state Harry was in. “What the fuck actually happened?”
“Very good, Miss Bishop. Five points to Slytherin.” The young girl blushed at the praise as Harry continued his lecture. “Yes, while a patronus can be used in other instances, such as sharing messages with others over distances or when face-to-face communication is simply not possible, the original intent of the charm was to repel dementors, among other dark creatures. Focusing on the dementors though, since their purpose is to suck out a person’s happiness leaving the victim to relive their worst memories, the charm is created by a burst of positive, happy energy essentially used to counteract the dementor’s power.
Harry ran his fingers through his hair and groaned. It was impossible to roam the school without the invisibility cloak tonight. Even under cover of the cloak, would Draco be able to make it to Harry’s room? He looked at his watch – it was two in the morning already. Harry turned off the light. Just like he had promised Draco, he opened the door of his room for an inch very carefully… he sat down on his sofa and waited in the dark. Minutes passed.
Taurus Malfoy wailed, Pinkie shrieked one last time – and in slow motion the two of them tipped over the now open edge of the floor. The raptor flapped his powerful wings and rose up into the night, his claws drawn into Taurus Malfoy’s chest.
“Oh, he’s an absolute darling!” Josh winked at Teddy who seemed to enjoy the attention and raised his arms towards Josh, obviously wanting to be picked up. Harry felt a sudden pang of jealousy, when Josh lifted the baby in his arms and cuddled him with affection.
“Thanks for that comparison,” Draco sneered with a grin. “Well, I’ve given you a fair warning… if you still insist – how about going to the ball with me?”
A huge white board appeared in front of them floating in the air. Kingsley, McGonagall and Flitwick all pointed their wands at it and murmured incantations – and in a trice the white board was covered with pictures, words and numbers.
They were alone. Draco still hadn’t put on his robes again and seemed to quietly admire his shirtsleeves. Harry was suddenly nervous, his whole body itched. He had never felt like that when being alone with Draco during their morning routine at the common room. Why was that? He needed to say something, anything to break that awkward silence.
Harry was really glad when everybody was done with lunch and he could leave their table without giving the impression of running away. Which he had seriously considered. The conversation had been a hilarious mixture of absurdities and embarrassments and he was quite relieved to have the afternoon all to himself. But – maybe he did want some company for his trip to Hogsmeade after all? Preferably someone who would neither talk nor ask stupid questions? He decided to fetch Otto and accompany his pet in the air on a broom. Otto was usually fast asleep until lunch time but ready for fun in the afternoon.
“Yeah, you’re probably right… but if there ever was a reason to convert, it would be Josh, he’s the coolest. When Charlie brought him to the Burrow, even I was crushing on him.”
Oh, well. It was time to face the issue like a true Gryffindor: He was gay. At least that seemed to be very likely. Could he be totally sure of it as long as he had never actually been with a bloke? Maybe reality did not live up to his dreams? Maybe it would not be so very different from being with Ginny after all? Maybe he was bisexual? Or pansexual? And the final question – why had yet another issue in his life to be more difficult for him than for the average guy? Harry sighed.
The interior of the hall had been rearranged for the festivities. Most of the furniture was gone except for the staff table, leaving the middle space empty for the opening dance. Students had started to gather around the room close to the walls, which were draped in rainbow-coloured hangings. Candle-lit pumpkins were shining from above and trays with mugs of spiced apple juice floated around.
Hermione sighed. “I’m afraid so. And that’s driving me mad…” She sat down heavily on the unmade bed.
“Yes, Ronald, we are your parents. No reason to scream like a madman.” Molly Weasley said to her son with raised eyebrows before she addressed Flitwick, “Good morning, Filius!”
The three girls grinned at each other and Harry was unsurprised to see that Cass was as easily making friends as he had expected her to do.
“I don’t need a babysitter either,” Snape grumbled out like a petulant child.“Again, I’m aware. But I will have Ron after my arse if I don’t leave soon and Minerva will have my head if I don’t drag you with me. So we are going back together.” With a small shrug, Harry added, “Plus, Ron said they hadn’t caught the guy yet, so we aren’t exactly safe here.”
“I’m perfectly fine, Potter,” Snape ground out, holding his glare. Harry snorted in response, taking note of the man’s still paler-than-normal complexion.
Harry smiled at the girl, warm and comforting. Keeping his voice soft still, as if he were speaking to a scared animal, he continued, “Thank you. Do you mind if I capture the memory for you? It won’t hurt a bit.” She nodded again.
Poppy was not paying attention to her captive audience though, especially the stares of both Severus and Harry trained on her. Instead, she just kept running the charms, one after the other, brow furrowing  further at the results floating next to her. Without a word, Poppy turned, wand still held aloft, and began running the charms over Harry, the room eerily silent as if everyone were even afraid to breathe.
Draco took just one excruciating second to respond, "No, it's been just me and Scorpius ever since my wife died."
I still am, I realize. Just because me and Potter smooch sometimes doesn't mean I'm more than someone whom he lives with. Although, we haven't kissed in a long time either.
"Oh err..." Harry stammered, grasping for something less illegal than the truth. "It was Knockturn Alley, just down Diagon. I was checking a piece of land I wanted to buy and Scorpius happened to walk around that area."
Draco's head popped from behind him, scaring the living daylights out of Harry. He tried playing it cool, sitting down on a chair while Draco placed the plates and other utensils around the table. His eyes followed Draco's every move, committing them to memory for...
jacket potatoes. It seemed that Draco had gone above and beyond to fill the table with all sorts of food. Even marinated mozzarella that made Harry's half-Italian heart

"No, we couldn't," Granger replies firmly. "We couldn't have saved him. You can't control Fiendfyre, Harry."
The first thing he noticed were the clothes. Draco was wearing a brown, snug-fitting henley, sleeves bunched up around his elbows, and greyish slacks that hung low on his hips. Tantalizingly low. He had an apron on, but sadly, it was not the pink one Harry had seen that early afternoon. This one was plain white.
it. That combined with the view of Draco's plump rear when he bended over had Harry scrunching his eyes shut at the unbidden variety of graphic images suddenly flooding his brain, each more enticing and inappropriate than the last.
"You're so smitten, Harry," Hermione declared from the couch she'd plopped herself on. She was smirking. "It's not like you."
"Scorpius!" the man called, closing the remaining distance between him and the kid, falling on his knees and gathering the little one into his arms.
The curt greeting was so nonchalant and didn't give Harry any answers. But then again, he hadn't exactly
It's not a wise decision. I stare in horror at my hands that are almost translucent against the hard floor —
Hermione burst out laughing as Ron turned a little green around the edges. "Can we stop talking about your dick?" he pleaded. Then at Hermione, "Stop laughing, you. Back me up a little. We can't let Harry go meet that man alone."
Finding no appropriate excuse — even though he was the literal Don — Harry sighed and relented, "Yeah, alright."
The witty banter continued for another five minutes or so. Most of it consisted of Harry deliberately making a fool of himself just to hear Draco laugh. Divine music to his ears. Harry relished in each and every one of Draco's snickers, wishing he could drink them along with the Hennessy on Draco's lips. In one too many occasions, he had to grip the edge of the counter for dear life, to keep from flinging himself at the handsome sod. All the while, they had subconsciously inched towards each other. One last lean forward and Harry could—
I have this mad urge to comfort him. But when I step closer to do so, my vision blurs as the room tips funny. I reach for the counter to steady myself.
The request never came. Instead, Draco threw his eyes at the sidewalk in front of his shop and asked, "Is that motorbike yours?"
Draco became in his mind's eye. Harry found himself hanging onto his every word, letting the sound of Draco's voice lull him into a peculiar state of both peace
at me. Whenever Potter tries to coax Teddy into allowing me to play with him, an expression of fear and trepidation overtakes the 5-year-old's features.
He looked about Harry's age, and was obviously Scorpius' father — he had the same platinum blond hair and a long, aristocratic nose. Harry couldn't see his eyes from that far away, but they were shut tight anyway and
' Harry caught onto his own thoughts and flushed. Had it been that long since he'd gotten laid last?

had unanimously chosen her as their consigliere. Although, Hermione preferred to be called "royal advisor" instead.
'. Perhaps that was the man's store that Scorpius had been talking about. Above Scorpius' shoulder, Harry could see the strap of a pink apron that rounded the man's neck.
When the silence stretched, Harry looked up to find his best friends gawking at him. Ron looked like he'd lost all hope, while Hermione appeared mildly amused. He frowned at them. "
"Exactly," his wife adds, looking at Potter with motherly eyes. "We're here for you, Harry. You can tell us anything."
When Harry wrenched his eyes away from the man's midsection and tried to remember how words worked, all breath escaped from his lungs. You see, eye contact with Scorpius' dad was impossible at the moment because the man's eyes had ventured down and stopped on Harry's bare chest. Or well, the
Granger is the only one Potter agrees to see from time to time. She shares my opinion that something is very wrong about Potter's mental health, but the pillock won't listen to either of us.
I'm a promise-breaker, I know. This update took a lot more than I thought. And next update might take just as long cuz I have to prepare for uni. Anyhow, hope I got you hooked to the story because there's definitely so much more to come.
That stole a handsome snicker from Draco's plush lips. "How about we start over?" he offered, stretching his hand. "Hi, I'm Draco Malfoy."
Harry Potter?" He sounded shocked. Harry nodded in response, amused at the reaction. "I've heard your name associated with the brand."
Using his body to hide the view from Scorpius, Harry turned his head to give the guys a baffled look that screamed, '
guessed it was not from the heat. If there had been any doubt that the man was actually straight — at least, straight enough to have a
Harry hated car rides. Especially when he wasn't the one behind the wheel. It felt like he was being babied instead of shown respect. He could take himself places too,
Draco sat beside Harry, leaving a chair's space between them. Whether Harry appreciated or despised this safe distance, he wasn't sure. His appealing host poured them both a glass of cognac, pushing Harry's glass towards him.
Harry felt uncharacteristically touched at the gesture. It had been a while since he'd been in a child's presence. His godson, Teddy, was 14 years old now. Old enough to understand Harry's "job". He tried distancing himself from Teddy as to not let his godson meddle with stuff too dangerous for him.
Not waiting to see Vince get dragged away, Harry stomped on his unfinished cigarette and walked towards the child. None of these brutes could be trusted with a kid. Better deal with it himself.
," Harry interrupted him, and fished his phone out to find the article he had searched a few hours ago. "I found on Google that it is a constellation. Scorpius too. Maybe it's a thing in their family."
Scorpius trusting Harry, holding his hand, brought forth flashbacks of the time Teddy was an infant and Harry was engrossed with him to the point of obsession. Teddy had been the rock in Harry's life right when everything else was falling apart. He suddenly regretted pushing his godson away.
Before long, Harry's unwillingness to leave created this thick silence that neither him or Draco dared to break. They simply stood there, looking at each other for what could've been hours or mere seconds as far as Harry's lust-deprived mind was concerned. He studied Draco's every feature like his life depended on it and found a stray eyelash just above his left cheekbone.
It hasn't been easy. We fight even more now that we share a living space. Bickering comes as easy as breathing to us.
! Nobody ate dinner at this hour. In his defence, he had been too mesmerized by the pale beauty to think straight.
He gathered the empty dishes in a neat stack and placed them on the sink. Loading the dishwasher was an option, but Harry didn't know if Draco was one of those people who fussed a lot over dishes, washing them by hand like Hermione did. He decided not to test his luck.
"Dinner will take just a moment." Draco busied himself with the oven mitts and headed for the stove. "I hope you like jacket potatoes," he said over his shoulder.
Between ringing the doorbell and knocking on the door, Harry chose the latter. For whatever reason. Not five seconds after his knock, he heard the pattering of feet from inside the house. The front door was flung open to reveal a barefoot Scorpius grinning up at him.
"You can talk to us, mate," Weasley rushes to reassure his best friend. "It's better if you let it all out instead of bottling it inside."
Potter pushes me away too. Or at least tries to. But unlike his lackeys, I don't treat him like he's made of glass. I don't follow him around, begging for his attention. What I
learning how to use skins for that text (and future text messages between Draco and Harry) so show me some respect 😤😆
' and Harry was their leader. Still, he didn't want Ron, his right-hand man whom he'd grown up with, to treat him differently.
Luckily, Scorpius had said or done something that attracted his dad's attention, saving Harry from saying anything else.
"Hello, sir," the kid greeted him with a toothy grin. Well, there were more teeth missing than not, but it still counted for something.
. Harry could stare at him all night without getting bored. And the interest was obviously mutual, it
to shuck his leather jacket off and hang it. It was warmer inside anyway, plus the jacket looked like it belonged there.
Still a little startled (and concerned) from before, Harry barely found his voice to croak, "Please, it's no bother."
Harry huffed another sigh, and decided to let it slide. Instead, he threw a look outside the window.
"Harry Potter, nice to meet you," he said, giving Draco what he hoped was his most dazzling smile. A pair of admiring grey eyes fell to his mouth so it must have worked.
Another celestial chuckle. "No, I don't bake for my shop. After Astoria, I hired employees to do that. Keep her dream alive, y'know? But I only know how to bake cookies. I don't like sweet things that much, anyway."
Surely, a lousier conversation starter didn't exist. He was a sorry excuse for someone who made business deals on the fly on a daily basis.
Harry stared down at the kid's grasp on his hand dumbfounded, but Scorpius paid him no mind, carrying on half-running merrily to keep up with Harry's large steps.
Somewhat lost in thought, Harry followed his line of view and beamed. "Yeah. Why? Fancy a ride?" he asked, wiggling his eyebrows.
"When's the last time I got laid anyway?" Harry asked thoughtfully. He couldn't even remember — a testament of it being
great room that you wouldn't believe fit in the small-looking apartment, let alone left space for others. Living room, dining room and kitchen all in one. The decor Harry recognized to be bohemian style, but without indoor plants. Warm tones of beige and brown greeted his eyes, from the fabric of the couches to the round coffee table. A tall bookshelf stood against the farthest wall, filled more with trinkets than actual books. There were framed inspirational quotes on the walls, such as '
Normally, Harry would have thought of this type of interior as repellent. Now though, he liked it. The atmosphere in there was so welcoming, so
With one last look at Draco's house, Harry turned to Elvendork and hopped on it. Might as well get out of here and go placate Ron's worries.
arousal. Their hands would brush whenever they passed things around the table, adding more fuel to that fire. Harry had to constantly keep forcing some
It was this frenzy of worries that caused Harry to lose focus and almost jump out of his skin when Draco returned.
A minute or so later, Scorpius walked closer to Harry's leg and raised an unbearably small hand to wrap it around Harry's pinkie.
Harry turned to look at him even as he put the fag between his lips and lit it. Ron rolled his eyes, irritated.
"She died at childbirth. Her health had always been frail and doctors had advised us against trying for a child, but she wouldn't listen. Desperately wanted to be a mother. A day doesn't go by that I don't think of her. She would have been a better parent to Scorpius. Today... You have no idea how scared I was when his teacher called me. I often wonder if I'm a good enough father for—"
Harry watched Draco exit the great room towards presumably Scorpius' bedroom. Left alone, he thought he should at least make himself useful by putting the dirty dishes away. In other words, it was either
It made Draco laugh so hard, he almost choked on his drink. One more excuse for Harry to touch him, patting Draco's back.
But when one ran a business as precarious as he did, problems were bound to form, like persistent rocks in one's shoe. Harry was on his way to fix one right now actually, and hating every second of it.
"Daddy! Nice Mister is here," was his greet-turned-shout. Not to Harry, but to his father who was presumably busy somewhere in the house.
travelling on Sirius' motorcycle, when it was just him, Elvendork and the open road. Heaven. Should someone question how much Harry cared about his godfather's most precious possession, that someone would have to know that Harry has only ever bought two tracking devices: one for Teddy and one for Sirius' bike.
Trust the lawyer to have seen right through Harry. They had grown up together — he, Ron and Hermione. Had spent years in boarding school, sharing basically everything. But Harry was aware that
in front of him sent his nerves on edge and Harry cursed himself for acting like a teen girl with a crush.
this house, every nook and cranny. The wooden floor, the fuzzy rugs, the black-and-white motifs on the curtains — all of it.
He looks up at me with those vulnerable green eyes and I feel like it's the right thing to do. I press my lips to his chapped ones, feeling him melt under it.
Some drug-selling, a side of alcohol smuggling, gambling that was more often illegal than not — the list went on and on. The Potters were a notorious name in Britain, especially after Harry took the matter into his own hands.
. He stopped in front of the bakery, right next to the streetlight, killed the engine and hopped off, removing his helmet.
" thing didn't go well with the Mafia theme. At least, Harry didn't think so. Even for a healthy, 32 year old bloke, love was a far-fetched concept and the gang provided enough occupation for his hands as it was.
The silent treatment doesn't last. We meet accidentally in the kitchen one night at 3am and a conversation is inevitable. The specky git is a surprisingly good talker and listener. We bond over all sorts of stuff, which would be disturbing if we were the same people we used to be.
Sentimental as though that statement was, Harry knew that he meant every single word. He tried to convey as much certainty and encouragement through his expression, his touch. Hell, he wished he could physically
Instead of doing that, Draco just stared at him for a long, meaningful second. Then he replied with a husky "
However, Draco didn't seem to mind. He even brightened up a little when he explained, "Yes, it was Astoria's childhood dream to own a bakery. I just helped open and manage it."
For the second time that night, Harry's hand reached out to Draco without forethought. He picked the eyelash between his thumb and forefinger, the rest of his fingertips grazing Draco's cheek when Harry pulled his hand back.
them. Especially Draco's. It rolled lavishly from his tongue, like a sip of old wine that made him feel fuzzy and warm, in the best of ways.
The man rose slowly from the ground, picking Scorpius up and balancing him on his hip. Harry could now see the apron in all of its pink, frilly glory. The front read '
I'm just a means of comfort to Potter. We snog and cuddle like Hufflepuffs because he likes it and I tolerate it.
he did that, I still don't know. Maybe his hero complex activated once more and I became his charity case. I've been living with him for almost two years now.
While his gaze inspected the surroundings, Harry could feel Draco's eyes raking over his body. He pretended not to notice, instead choosing to silently bask in the nonverbal praise. When their eyes met again, the blond was biting his lower lip uncertainly.
"Right, Scorpius. But then, why didn't you go home immediately after school?" Harry asked him, growing more and more concerned about this kid's thought process. If he wasn't lost, then why did he enter that gloomy storehouse?
Of course he had already told Hermione and Ron about Josh’s findings, but thought it best to fake surprise, because he did not want Josh to be in even more trouble for having told Harry first.
Flitwick nodded eagerly, “Ten points to Gryffindor, Ms Granger, well done. That is exactly what we will practice today, changing the colour of fabric by use of
! Just look at Harry! How much easier would his life have been without the heavy weight of tradition on his shoulders?!” She shook her head and added, “I sincerely hope, that the four houses will be nothing but a faint memory when you’re headmaster, Harry!”
“We were actually talking about Carter’s sister, she’s on the swim-team – a very confident girl,” Harry said, “she tried to pair Carter and me off, can you believe it?”
Professor McGonagall looked doubtful and Harry shared her scepticism. Only after Dumbledore’s death Harry had realized, how very little he knew about his mentor.
“They are all here to lay eyes on my immaculate body wrapped in nothing but a speedo, of course,” Blaise said with a grin, slapping his naked belly. Harry and Tommy laughed, they had decided on wearing T-shirts with their trunks for the lesson.
Laddley stared at her, he looked positively dumbfounded. Then he murmured something that might have been ‘Good evening’ and left.
“Ms Silver is kind enough to tolerate my company while walking her dog,” Snape said with a little bow to the lady at his side. “I just try to show her around, take her to nice landscapes. She is not yet familiar with Hogwarts’ artwork.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, “and of course, he’s right. I would never have survived the last few years without support.”
“No,” Draco interrupted, “Listen, Harry, I’ve been thinking… even if I make it back to the Room, I can’t stay in there forever… it’s driving me crazy, with nothing to do but worrying… feels like prison already.”
Looking at Bellevue Beach Harry was pleased to see Headmistresses Da Ponte and Darknight strolling along the waterside. Apparently the abduction had not spoiled their favourite painting for them. He found the sight of two elderly ladies walking hand in hand rather touching. On the far end of the beach he spotted Daisy. She threw a stick in the air which Pinkie retrieved above the waves.
. Let me have a look… ah, excellent, just as I had hoped for, Mr Malfoy is wearing a white shirt again…”
To his utter embarrassment Harry blushed. Those fucking contagious Malfoy-blushes! Did Hermione know about his and Draco’s morning encounters? He wouldn’t rule it out, although he hadn’t told anybody. Hermione sure had a way of comprehending relationships that was far beyond Harry’s abilities. And, yes, Draco and Harry still spent every morning at the common room together, although their routine seemed to have shifted slightly since last Sunday. Draco had, as he put it, conformed to Harry’s dress code– meaning he was wearing pyjamas and a dressing gown. And although Draco still brought along a book, he was much more talkative than before. Each morning Harry became acquainted with a very different Draco Malfoy, a person he hadn’t known before and liked better day by day. They might talk a bit, tease each other or watch the sun rise in silence – Harry had to admit he felt utterly comfortable in Draco’s presence. Except for the uncomfortable truth of being also… well, sexually attracted. Probably because of seeing him in pyjamas.
“I could tell them, that I’ve heard unkind rumours about Tharros and want to stand up for her! Miming the gentleman, that’ll do the trick!” Ron said proudly.
