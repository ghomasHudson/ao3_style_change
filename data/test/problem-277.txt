This doesn’t seem to be an acceptable explanation.  “You are a kind wizard, Harry Potter,” Firenze tells him, too tall, surely lying.  “But the forest is not yours to rule.”
It’s surreal to hear this said when he’s only packing a bag.  It makes Harry laugh.  Draco grins at him, showing his teeth.
“Kazamagram,” says Oliver, distracted.  “I thought that I’d turned off notifications…”
“You should stay,” suggests Harry, his mind blank and his instincts prim with exhaustion, looking at the angles of his face.  “I’ll put you up in the spare room; we’ll do something in the morning.”  By this, Harry realises, he can only mean have some breakfast.
“Probably,” says Harry.  His laugh is the perfect portrait of self-mockery.  “But I spent the night – that’s what I remember.  You looked after me and you made me breakfast.  We’d been together for Christmas Eve at Teddy’s and that was Boxing Day and then we spent New Year’s downstairs.  And then we broke up.”
“I represent us on the action group,” Harry tells the wizard, waiting for the catch, holding his wine.  He was put up for it instead of volunteering, but he’s been trying to make the best of it he can.  It’s embarrassing – most departments have sent their head and/or a senior member of staff with stake.  Harry can never remember who the Mysteries representative is.  He talks to Kingsley and Percy about the drafts they’ve been given and pretends that they’re not confidential.
James sits up, watching him with a frown.  Harry can guess what he’s thinking – all Sirius has ever done is pay attention to Lupin.
“They must be so kind to each other,” Draco tells him unkindly, holding him down, and maybe Harry just wants to know what Ron and Hermione are like; he knows every single other thing else.  He doesn’t want to see their bits and he doesn’t imagine them now.  “Or maybe they’re not.  Maybe there’s a whip.”
Harry – feels annoyed about this, because Andromeda’s made clear where Lupin stands.  “We should talk to Luna about Teddy’s wand,” he says as they stand up, deciding that he won’t keep in the thought after all.  “She’s about to start crafting.”
But then he takes the ring in his fingers, and it strikes Draco that Pansy would have loved it.  She never would have chosen it, because she always tried to hide her love of everything pink and frivolous, and that’s likely the most ridiculous thing about this ring – certainly moreso than the nature of the metal or the stones.
“You are
“Please.”
Draco has one hand in hair that’s too thick to exist, like an animal’s winter pelt – and then he’s tracing wizarding embroidery on the collar of a robe, which Harry Potter should never have found a taste for, teaching post or no.  He sighs, because it isn’t supposed to be like this.
“That’s enough, Lily,” now James interrupts, sounding stern.
, playing a game, and that means that neither of us has to play it anymore.”  He’s breathing, losing control.  “I don’t
“Because I love you,” Draco admits, his expression accusing, closing his fingers around Harry’s hand.  “You fly like a starling.”
that he said at the end.
“I’m not sure that policing by consent is a relevant consideration, inside family,” Malfoy remarks smartly as they enter an unflooded stretch of path.  “Our private homes are each its own authoritarian state.  Some much more fascist than others,” he jokes.
On the platform, James prefers to find Percy’s daughters, the cousins he’s closest to, while Lily has her own little friends, not related at all.  Albus heads off to find Scorpius and say hello to his idol, Mr Malfoy, who will have been told about Harry’s divorce by his son.  He looks up without Mrs Malfoy by his side, and Harry’s surprised to find that the expression on his face is sympathetic; they share a nod, and Malfoy shares a nod with Ginny too.
“I’m going back for Ron,” said Hermione shortly, and Harry couldn’t stand upright, the room turning.  “With any luck, he’ll have calmed down your dad.”  With a
“I don’t care what that therapist thinks,” she goes on, leaning forward to pick up a cake, giving Harry a view right down her cleavage, which he doesn’t need, thank you.  “I’d kill her again in a heartbeat.”
,” Harry mocks him, a snigger in his nose as Draco whines, working a heel into the bed, shifting so that Harry’s hand has more room between them.  He speeds up.
…”  Harry shook his head, swallowing.  “He’s only trying to help, but by the time we’d sat down he’d cooked up this mental plan where we’d have everyone round for Easter here at Grimmo.”
“I…”  Lupin struggles for words, standing up.  He’s lost.  He apologises to his son, for so many things, “I’m quite terrible.”
“He took it as a point of pride, that we could at least get James’s son to the end.”  Sirius goes on, wry, “If not unscathed, then…  He never wanted to be a father,” he finishes, his broken heart palpable.
As an auror, his mind ticks easily through the logistics: Hogwarts permission slips are enchanted, and there are forgery-detecting spells which any sensible authority would use in a case like this.  Direct fraud seems unlikely, even vanishingly so.  There will have been a conspiracy – between the children, absolutely, who will have needed Ginny’s signature, unless they found a way to Harry’s, and someone to receive it.  Permission slips are usually a matter for each student’s head of house.
He imagines changing course; he imagines sitting in the library with them.  He imagines his dad sitting back into one of the armchairs with his hands behind his head, feet on the footstool.  His mum will be writing letters at the desk, which is hers these days despite being a Black antique, ebony inlaid with bone.  She’ll be sitting there with parchment, quill and violet ink, Harry imagines, a few completed letters folded up beside her and another tall stack of sorted correspondence.
“I’d happily return the favour,” Draco insists, all curled up and using his legs to grab at Harry’s sides.  “Mm –”
“Why is Albus fighting with Scorpius?” is all Harry asks, because he likes to think that his daughter, at least, will have life sussed out.
He even likes the title, Harry realises.  It’s informative.
,” he says to her, as though addressing people respectfully is in fact rude and unpleasant.  “Do sit down.”
“Yes,” James accepts.
he casts, hawthorn wand in his fingers with a flick.  He turns away as Potter goes stumbling backwards.
Potter laughs with a joyful little titter, right on cue.  He ruffles up the back of his hair, which is so much like Harry’s.
Half of school was here and some of them still are, drifting out into the garden
Harry feels like he’s gone somewhere else in time, as though he’s in the wrong place, or that he was before.  It’s disorientating, using the cloak.  He shouldn’t have done it.
Potter rolls his eyes, finally taking a glug of his own punch.
“Professor Snape and I had absolutely nothing in common.”
“Don’t you
Harry hears his voice sound almost like it does up at school, when it needs to.  He doesn’t dwell on it.  He lies down first, shuffling Draco down with him then rolling to smother the thoughts out of him, all the cold, kissing Draco’s cheek near his nose, burrowing to kiss his pulse.  A hand receives his head, much too weak.
The snakes on the centre mat writhe to meet those on the matching tureen of steaming puttanesca, when it appears.  Harry tells them all to calm down, and he doesn’t think about the fact that he’s hissing.
in chickenscratch, insecure handwriting that’s clearly a boy’s.  Worse, there are several, a dozen, a score even, maybe, from Sirius, the handwriting familiar, the parchment well thumbed, the paragraphs long, and Harry can’t read another word, packing everything away and sitting there on the rough wooden floor of the shed at the end of the garden.
His dad shrugs, and Harry remembers his conversation with Moony, the night before the memorial in May.  “We’ve been in the air for hours,” his dad says, as though this isn’t interesting at all.  “I needed something to keep me occupied.”
Harry’s mother gives her son another squeeze.  “We’ll see you both at lunchtime, won’t we?” she commands, before turning around.  “
It’s quarter-past-six in the pub, and George looks Harry’s dad in the eye.  They both look like Gryffindors, Harry thinks; he can imagine them young and in school.  They don’t look much like Harry and Ron.  Ron’s a Gryffindor at work, Harry thinks, while he himself tries to be neutral.  At Grimmo, Harry likes to think of each one of them as Hufflepuffs, their swords all hung up and Justin Finch-Fletchley taking their place.  Doing it right.
He’ll realise later that he’s never spoken like this to his mum and that it seems out of character, for her to shout at him back.
“Oh.  Right.  Dunno,” Harry says, meeting his father’s murky, watchful eyes.   “I never know,” he jokes bluntly.  “Ignore her and hope she goes away?”
Hermione arrives not long after this, looking harried and in her own world, breaking up the conversation by immediately launching into a long explanation of something she’s read and is clearly thinking through.  Harry’s never thought to question whether the things that Hermione rattles on about are wizarding or muggle, at any particular time – and nor has he ever much considered that someone might find it rude, as George’s weary expression seems to imply (“Hello Hermione,” he says sarcastically.  “How are you?”).  Harry’ll need to run interference on the decorations, he supposes.  That’s fine.
Jaw clenched with an expression of utter spite, the dream of Sirius turns on a heel and starts storming out of the room.
“Is James really here?” Lupin asks eventually, a spark of genuine emotion in his eyes.
And Harry laughs and corrects him, “That I’m in love with you.”  Because that’s something no one ever told him.
Harry is entirely taken aback.  Andromeda’s looking at him with hooded eyes and a thin expression to her mouth.  They’re Bellatrix’s features, Harry knows, though his memory of Bellatrix is vague enough that he couldn’t say how anymore.  She looks a lot like Sirius too, Andromeda, when she laughs, and her build reminds Harry of him much more than Narcissa or Draco, who must have got the same genes as Regulus.
Andromeda turns back to look at him, amused.  “There’s no need to bite my head off, Harry,” she says, ending the argument.
“Harr–” Draco shouts suddenly, the sound choked, but it isn’t much help.
“Oh,” reflects Neville, not looking repentant.  Cheeky git.  “Sorry, Haz.”
The man is scowling at his father and at Black, who’s still grinning.  His arms are crossed, and he’s angry, surely, just angry.  It’s what most of his emotions turn into.
Draco’s wrist feels like it’s going to crack; Harry has to let it go.
They’ll need a few more maps, if they ever do anything like this.  For now, the size of the map doesn’t matter, because there’s a much larger fold-up of parchment in Harry’s bag, along with a bottle of blue-black ink.
He also doesn’t like to think this.  It’s confusing.
“No reason; I just…”  Harry looked around the ball room, the flood of people dancing to whatever this music was, the groups of people laughing at the tables.  The lights were dim, and he felt tired, all of a sudden.  He didn’t recognise half of the guests and he didn’t understand it.  “There’s so many people here,” he said stupidly, looking at them.  “And now you’re here.  Why isn’t Malfoy here?” Harry found himself asking again.  “He’s our mate.  I swear he’s Ginny’s mate.  Why can’t everyone be mates?”
For a moment, the man looking at Harry seems startled.  Then he catches on, and a slow smirk spreads across his face.  “Draco told you,” he realises, freckly.
“Do you remember how you were feeling,” Draco took another tack, hiding the old Mark back against his jeans, “when you were shopping that day?”
“Dad, are you going to marry Mr Malfoy?” Lily’s demanding, white-faced and desperate, with no sense of reason or proportion, unaware that he and Ginny will need to stay married for another eighteen months.  The idea’s for the whole thing to be quiet.  “Are you a Slytherin now?  I don’t want us to be a Slytherin family!”
Matías was nodding at him, frowning manfully like an epic hero.  He likely knew about the time in 2006, but he didn't bring it up.
Malfoy ducks his head for a moment, acknowledging.  “It’s possible that we turned her into you,” he says dryly, meeting Harry’s eyes.
the man is saying, and he looks impossibly young.
Brows knitting again, Sirius doesn’t say anything.  Buckbeak seems to be digging for a worm.
“Your Cousin Draco’s a nice man,” Harry tells Teddy in the reflection.  This isn’t true, by any definition.  “Nicer than he was,” he corrects.
Draco recognises the drawing room of number 12, Grimmauld Place.  It looks nothing like it does now, all faded opulence in black and muddy gold, the windows shuttered against daylight, dust dulling the stone of the hearth.  There are two sofas, in much the same arrangement that there are two sofas now, but these are moth-eaten and high-backed.  Black sits deeply into one of them, feet on the coffee table and a letter in his hand.  There’s a snowy owl perched on the back of the sofa beside him – Hedwig, Draco remembers, the post owl – clawing dark chenille with her head tilted to accept the absent scratch of Black’s fingers.
He wants – he wants to believe that the wyvern isn’t Harry at all, but a vision of Harry and him.  Potter and Malfoy.  Lily Potter’s Harryowl and Draco the dragon, always, from that time when they were both perfect, grown up into something that no one cannot love.  It’s never even had to be
Harry snorted, and for some reason Draco found himself remembering where this adventure had begun, with them both in a shed and Harry in a Surrey understairs cupboard.  He’d said nothing, at the time, but Draco had a feeling as though he’d confessed just as much as he’d heard, leaving the air thick between them.
“The hat gave me a choice too, you know,” Albus is interrupting him, turning red around his freckles.  “I chose the baddies.”  He’s never told Harry this.  As far as Harry knows, he’s never told his mum.  “You weren’t supposed to follow me.  I was trying to leave home.”
,” Lupin quotes, as though anything Black might say would amuse him today.  He doesn’t comment on the rest of it.  He and Draco are both sitting to one side of the hospital bed in comfortable green chairs, their robes and skin about clean enough, though Lupin was the one to cast
Harry answers her question.  “
Arthur would have been able to work it out from this description, if he hadn’t already known.  It’s a bit of a cheat, but for now Harry counts it as telling him.
Now, Harry will always be Godric’s man, but he likes to see himself as the Sorting Hat these days, when he teaches Defence against the Dark Arts: a beaten-up, worn sort of thing who cares less about inter-house rivalry and more about putting things in the right place.  Doing things in the right order.
The dog seems to woof again, turning.  By the cold, Harry’s sure that his mum means anything to do with the UK.
“Do you see a lot of Harry?” Lupin asks, as though afraid that he’s going to be bitten.
Harry barely recognises Teddy in Ron’s shirt, the next day.  Ron’s clearly in a joking mood, because it’s the same shirt that Harry tried to wear out in October.
And Dudley’s always been in touch with Luna, so Harry supposes that he should have seen this coming.
“As they say,” interjects Sirius, sardonic, making Harry titter.
“I told you a lot of things, back then,” says Harry now, cautious, a pair of frowning black eyebrows beneath dark hair.  He’s told Draco a lot more since, and Draco’s sometimes exchanged the favour.  He’s a leaky bucket, Harry, with his thoughts and with his secrets.  “I haven’t seen you in three months and now…”
Lupin’s watching him, and he doesn’t seem to agree.
Moony screws up his face, looking bitter.  “Sirius has always been the worst dog,” he tries again, scornful, looking down.  “The barest hint of affection and he’ll eat right out of your hand.  I’ve always known how to play him –“
This was when they had the conversation that Harry recalled at the pub.  It grew out of somewhere and moved into Hermione saying –
Draco’s grin pulls around his teeth.  “But must you say it when I’m tired and full of cheap wine?” he demands, absolutely impossible to please.  “My ears are ringing with arguments from fuckers,” he uses Harry’s word.  His eyes are soft.
Promptly, George even pretends to be tromping through undergrowth, pumping arms, a heavy frown on his face as though he’s about to throw a gnomish tantrum.  James sniggers, and when the joke’s done George changes tack.
“I wouldn’t mind a girl,” says Hermione archly, patting Ron roughly on the back.  “And we’re going to wait and see – but yes, that sounds lovely.  We can call him or her Burny, for short.”
This made Sirius laugh, down his nose for variation, while Harry felt a hot stab of anger.  He didn’t need
Draco shakes his head.  Poor thing, Harry thinks; he does look turned on.  “Like I could catch you and keep you and you wouldn’t weigh a thing.”  He glances over Harry’s shoulder.  “And you look well in a flock,” he states, not really mocking.
Lupin is smoking a cigarette, and Harry still means to buy Draco that pint.  The smell is acrid here, near the window.  There’s an odd sort of tall metal teapot, maybe, on the red table, an empty rack for toast and a jar of jam and used plates.  Other things; a newspaper?
“You were you.”  Draco steps in close, and he looks so different to Harry now from when they were teenagers, worn in like a pair of favourite shoes.  He traces Harry’s hairline with his fingers, drifting over scar and then eyebrow; Harry shivers.  He pushes his glasses a touch up his face.  “You were working.  You shouldn’t have brought me, really,” Draco chides, meeting Harry’s eyes.  “A little woman would have been better.”
, like Lockhart?
He thought…  It’s been a better week.  “
“What?” Harry finds himself laughing, even as Draco does the impossible again, making the bed squeak, and the mattress feels too unstable for this.  “Nmph – I’m not doing that.  Shut up.”
Harry swallows, imagining himself walking away, dressing while a naked someone sleeps.  While they wake up, roll over and ask him to stay a bit longer.  It’s actually a memory, one of many.  “I don’t use words like that,” he grumbles, wiping crumbs on his jogging bottoms.
Black isn’t listening to Draco, and seems to think that his godson is hilarious.  His laughter is deep and rough as he ruffles Harry’s hair, or splats it with his hand in any case.  “I proclaim you one-hundred-and-five!”  He’s completely off his head.  Harry slouches down beneath the force of his palm.  “Supreme Mugwump!”
The problem is that Draco doesn’t know where to stand.  He keeps his feet on the stone floor, in the end, the cage between him and the veil, the pole leering over his head.  He conjures a hoop of iron to encircle his feet.  It isn’t much, but he feels a little better.  There are no true shields that he can cast to protect him which will yet allow him the use of his wand.
The spell does nothing, and then the man is bellowing, “SIRIUS!”  He’s frantic as he lowers his wand.  He seems confused for a moment, lost as he contemplates the arch, but he divides himself and calls again.  “SIRIUS, CAN YOU HEAR ME?”
He wondered where Luna and Neville had got to, before remembering how much he’d upset them.  He spotted Angelina, Alicia and Katie laughing with a Weasley witch cousin at one of the tables, but didn’t think that he’d be welcome to join them.  There was a group not far away from the dancefloor, all wizards in robes, and Harry thought that he could see himself at the centre of them – but it wasn’t him, in fact.
” Draco bites out, on his last nerve.
And – that’s who this man is, Harry thinks.  Not Professor Lupin.  Not yet.  Not Romulus Lupin from the papers.  He’s Uncle Moony, still trying.
They all laugh, and Lily throws back her head.  “I’m very popular,” she says, and it’s charming somehow.  “Thank you for looking after our son,” she adds, leaning forward and touching Kingsley’s arm and he turns bashful, somehow.
Draco’s soul was thick with darkness, no matter how much he might want to bleach it clean.  And even then…  It was 2004, and Draco felt younger than he had at fifteen.  He didn’t know what he was doing, and there was no one to explain, no one to hide things from.  He needed that; he needed to be told that whatever he did, he was wrong.
“I trust you,” the woman says, shaking her head.  It’s utterly bizarre.  She drops his hand and twitches a finger at his eyebrows.  “You’re crap at the Unforgivables, I can tell.  And don’t tell me that I can’t; I get enough of that from the rest of them.”  She grins at him, mostly with her eyes, patting his upper arm quickly like a mother.  “A cup of tea at yours, Mr Malfoy,” she suggests, “and a floo to our son.  I’ll catch up with James and Moony later.  Why’s my Harrybye not in London?”
And the thing is, Harry thinks to himself, he
“I thought to myself, thank
He’s only wearing jeans and a t-shirt, rather than useful smothering robes, but he forces himself closer, into the heat which is crisp on his arms and his hands and his face and he thinks –
And they lie tangled up together afterwards, summoning the covers back.  Harry’s not jabby at all, but is instead as comforting and warm and heavy in his wires as an oversized stuffed bear, like the one that’s still sitting in Harry’s chair, actually, which was apparently transfigured from a hand towel.  Only he’s better, because he’s Harry Potter, who’s always been better at everything.
“It’s lovely,” Petra says, peering inside the wonky greenhouse.  “Are those orange trees?  Amazing.”  The trees are in flower; Kreacher does more work than he should, looking after them.  Harry uses spells; it’s still not clear if there’ll be fruit.  “You could make whisky marmalade.  Or marmalade gin.”
over Harry’s
Hand in front of his face, Draco caught maybe five of the walnut-sized knots, and it was only then, squeezing them, that he realised that the dragon was a plush children’s toy.  Squeaking, but quite animate, it took flight over Draco’s head, corkscrewing through the air to land awkwardly on Potter’s desk.  Papers slipped from their piles.
Harry can’t help the warm feeling that fills up his chest.  He knows that Flitwick daydreams about Hermione taking over Charms, but –  “I’ve been telling everyone that he should be famous,” Harry says.
“No one raised anything with their head of house before the end of term,” James counts off, and Harry has a prickling suspicion that he does in fact know what they’re talking about.  “There have been a few letters from parents, but only the usual suspects…  The OWLers and the NEWTers have done excellently.
Besides, Granger’s boyfriend isn’t listening.  “He’d tell me to trust my instincts, Harry, if he was here, but I don’t know what those are.”
“We don’t talk about that era,” Lupin says plainly, droll and in vibrant spirits, it seems, despite himself.
Draco glances at it cockily, seeing straight through Harry’s motives.  “It couldn’t go in the other room or downstairs because of Ron,” he says easily.  His expression is mocking, beneath a mask of sincerity.  “You’ve apparently told Granger several times that I remind you of a spider – she thought because of my venomous wit and tendency to appear out of nowhere.”
Dumbledore begins, and Harry feels sick.
” Draco swore, jerking onto his back –
Dad doesn’t reply.
With a turn in his stomach, Harry wants to go home.  He doesn’t want to be here, doing this.  He doesn’t know what he’s doing.  He feels like he’s being Harry Potter, and he doesn’t want to be him.  He wants to be back at the house in his bed and a Hufflepuff, holding his insomniac boyfriend close until he feels warm.
“Ron, it’s Sirius!” Harry tells him, pointing at the bed and climbing off the floor.  “He’s awake and he’s in a bed in Mungo’s!”
They look at each other for too long.  Malfoy’s expression is searching, his mouth closed as though he’s holding in a question.  Harry feels trapped.
is for calling Lily a drunk,” Harry’s dad is saying, and it seems disproportionate.  This violence – for something so long ago.
“You were a
They bungled the operation because it would have been a greater risk not to try, and the moment came.  They had the help of Draco’s mother, the Polyjuice and the contents of Harry Potter’s backpack – and they got the stone away from the plotters – but the rest of the raid was a mess.  They were seen, and Lucius Malfoy tried to cast the Killing Curse on his son.  His wife took the hit without words, apparating directly into the line of fire, disillusioned such that her dead body fell to the floor looking mostly like carpet.  On Lucius Malfoy’s next attempt the curse rebounded, and it was Harry Potter who got Draco out of the building, unable to disapparate but alert enough to keep his head, grab hold of Draco’s wrist and tell him sharply, “
Flustered, Harry stares at him.  Draco stares.  Harry waits for the tension to start fizzling out, or for them to suddenly remember who they were at sixteen.
He doesn’t want to know any more.  Clearly his stalking has been about as comprehensive as it always was.  “Yeah, all right; fine.”
Much closer, however, Draco’s eyes gleam with wickedness, and he and Harry had sex before breakfast, because Draco was sitting in bed all elbows and knees and his eyes were the same colour as the sky when Harry opened the curtains (“You’ve just come back from the shower,” Draco didn’t complain at the time.).
be sober.  “This is a great party,” he gushes.  “That was a great speech – I loved what you said about the way all roots matter, because of the
Harry doesn’t realise what he’s getting himself into.
“Stop
“What’s the problem?” Ron asks, and Draco supposes that he at least has always been pragmatic.
They’re approaching the dining table, so Draco orbits away from them towards the hearth and its floo.  The room’s walls are a warm, snowy white, which gives him nowhere to hide as a figure in stark black.  Fuck, he thinks.  What the fuck did I do?
admit it.  You always did and always will nurse a tricky little pash for the lovely Alice Dearborn.”
,” he states damningly, “was anything said to me to challenge the views of my parents.”
Thoughts turning, eventually, to what it would take to create a better mowing spell, Harry’s still watching when Ron swings around the dining room’s doorframe.
“Stop
Potter said something to her, face in her ear and his arm sure around her waist.
And then – “Harry’s not come home yet,” Ron reminds Pansy dryly, not looking up from the file.
Everything in the veil is part of it, Draco remembers.  The vanished objects that return are only ever sharing the infinite space that Black stands in, winking into another dimension that Draco can’t see.  Those that don’t return are becoming something else, somewhere else.
He came up with this long after everything with Ginny.  It took him a year, to work it all out.  He’s always been slow.
Granger is not recovering, shaking her head and playing with the whipped cream floating in her cup.  “I cannot believe that you’ve done this, Draco,” she says.  “You have to write it up,” she goes on, waving her spoon and compulsively eating half-spoonfuls of white.  “With Harry’s mum and dad, I’m sure that we can get him cleared, and it will just have to be one of those things, like the Fairy Isle Incident of 18…  Oh, when was it?  1824?  No.  No.  Oh, anyway…  Twelve years in the veil; three accidents – it’ll be a question on the History of Magic OWL.  2008.  At least when they broaden the syllabus beyond all those wars wot we won, rah rah rah, and won’t
Or perhaps that was him.
Harry doesn’t look at her, keeping his eyes on his father, who’s scowling, clenching his jaw.  “It didn’t work,” he says measuredly, “but then there was this thing with our wands – and there he was, my dad’s ghost right in front of me.
Draco took Harry Potter’s jaw in his fingers, watching his mouth to be sure that he wasn’t joking.  Of course he wasn’t.  He’d heard about the cousin, but not…  “Why on earth are you telling me this?”
As Mrs Figg puts down the telephone, the tension in the room becomes palpable.
“It was because of Kreacher,” Harry says tiredly, and Lupin seems startled.  Draco thinks that he would more likely follow Kreacher into a rebellion than James Potter, if it wouldn’t have killed him, as Harry has decreed.  “He hurt him dreadfully, and Regulus gave up his life to get revenge.  We found it all out not long after you and I, er…”  He waves a hand through the air.  “Argued.”
The patronus form can only reflect something drawn from the caster, Draco recalls.  It may mimic one’s animagus transformation or that of another, in the rare circumstance that either are known.  But if it does not reflect the self, then the patronus recalls the caster’s image of another person, rather than offering true insight into their soul’s nature.  Else – well, those are the current working assumptions surrounding the spell.
,” Pansy immediately retorts, as though she can’t help herself.
More often than not, Harry’s sure that he couldn’t say when he fell in love with Malfoy.  Watching him now, fiddling with the charms, trying to find the right combination, Harry thinks that it must have been on that first dark day they got together.  It won’t have been the sex, though that was something in itself.  Malfoy fell asleep in Harry’s arms, his old enemy, unconscious and vulnerable for five solid minutes before Harry joined him – and people had held Harry before, but that sleep, at the start of things, was the longest that Harry’d ever held anyone who wasn’t a baby, since Cedric’s corpse and Dumbledore’s and Dobby’s.  It was like they’d become different people.
Harry blanched, and Draco felt him flinch.  “You – you never said that they knew,” he accused.  “All the stuff I pulled you into…”
It’s a sign of Granger’s earnest engagement with this moment that she sets the next mug of tea going with her wand, rather than faffing around the kitchenette by hand.  She’s told him a hundred times that the ritual is the point.

who drew the line.”
” Harry suggests to the unicorn; its tail flashes.  He has a feeling that Ron and Hermione won’t be able to get out of work.  “
,” Harry said solidly, kicking him again.  His cheeks were turning pink.  “Dickhead.”
“No you didn’t,” scoffed Parvati Boot, making Terry laugh – apparently everyone tries to pronounce it
“Yeah, probably for the best,” Granger’s boyfriend agrees.  “Though I like it,” he promises.
” Granger said, remembering.  She looked relieved, pushing her hair back a little as though she wanted it behind her ears.  It sprang forward.  “Thank you, Draco,
Harry grits his teeth.
“I’m quaking,” says Draco sarcastically, his nose sharp and angular, his eyes telling him to have some actual tact.
“Did you book a big bed at this castle?” Harry asks, not sure if he wants to be there or here or drinking champagne, certain that all three lie in his future.
Lily looks at him.
He cuts himself off, feeling stupid, embarrassed, out of control.
James looks at Sirius over the rims of his glasses, as though he’s finally caught on that something’s off.  He tucks a hand between his knees, still crossed.  “I thought that we were leaving the poor girl out of it,” he warns.
Unlike the Department of Mysteries, the Ministry of Magic’s Auror Office is full of people, in uniform robes, none of whom spares them a glance.  Its domain is a large open room, which smells of coffee and parchment and only a little bit of something like blood.  One of the walls hosts a sober array of framed photographs, accompanied by the legend,
” Granger said, already looking as though she wished the room would swallow her whole.  Her boyfriend covered her hand with his, there on the table between the empty glasses and the beermats.  “It’s, well, it’s difficult to explain…”
It’s the end of June, but Harry feels a breeze and imagines that it must be fresh outside with it.  Pleasant.  Both men are wearing dressing gowns.  Lupin is properly clothed in tartan and slippers, while Sirius is barefoot and wearing jeans as pyjamas, which Harry doesn’t think about.  The maroon quilted thing that should be tied across his bare chest is somewhat coming loose, but he looks boyish to Harry in this disarray.  He’s terribly handsome, more than he ever was after Azkaban, but that's only a curiosity.  Lupin’s much more Harry’s type.  If it could be said that he has one.
Draco’s sarky mirror remained just inside, cracked and bitter.  “Someone looks pleased with himself,” it said as Harry passed it, as though Harry was reaching above his station.
he used to spend the holidays as the lovechild of Arthur Weasley and my Aunt Petunia, watching muggle soap operas and keeping the others caught up on the details.”
” Draco accuses as Harry sinks in, but the acid’s all escaped him, and he’s not trying to be hurtful.  He gives up on wanking to pull at Harry’s hair, the lazy git, turning pink, breathing harshly through his nose as Harry makes him twitch.
“Though I don’t see how they guessed,” Harry grumps, “when he was just…”  He rolls his eyes.  “She told me not long after…  There was a thing in the news and it was her way of starting in on how she didn’t give a damn.  I’m not sure I believe her.  And I didn’t want to rethink everything,” he reports, “just because…  But, well, maybe they got away with it when people thought that you had to be a drag queen or dress as a sailor or – whatever, but anyway, it is
Grangers now, rather than one?”
“I’ve driven a car,” Harry disagrees, even as his dad agrees yes.
Something gulping pulls at Harry’s throat.  “I don’t know; we were on holiday,” he admits.  He can’t remember what Lupin said to him; he might have said something useful.  “The aurors are looking into it.”
, ᛖ.  But Draco always makes Harry think of the dawn, and the dawn has always calmed him – so instead he casts a few more marks to make
He explains that the stone may have given Lupin back his youth, keeping him on the same line as James Potter, because that’s the only explanation Draco has to offer at this precise moment.  He’s not certain of its accuracy, but it suffices for now.  Youth, and then time beyond the veil, resulting in the body that Lupin’s been given, of around thirty years in age.
From under Sirius’s arm, Harry’s eyes catch on his mother’s, and he sees fierce love in jade green.  Despite the pensieve, he can’t believe that his eyes have ever looked like hers, and he knows that this is the reason why a man is dead in the ground.
It would be on record somewhere, Draco supposed: an attack on muggles in central Salisbury, November 1997.  There’d be a list of the dead and the perpetrators, the names of Sara and Amy Chaudhury crisply printed on beige parchment in ink.  Another record for the piles on somebody’s desk.
"No, sorry –”
He mocks himself, standing under the late April sky and the canopy of Dean.  He doesn’t know what he’s doing.  He doesn’t know what he’s done.  His eyes itch, and there are words on his tongue, but he can only hear say that Harry Potter loves him.
Rather than responding, Draco takes a step closer, his eyes solid on Harry’s.  Then he speaks: “Never have I been so tempted to use legilimency without asking.”
“There,” Luna said to the bowtruckle, in her dreamy sing-song voice.  “It’s over now.  I’m sorry.”  She picked her way back to the tree and set her branch at its base like a wreath for the dead.  The creature fled up into the many branches that waved, still attached, under the blue Siberian sky.
Harry’s dad casts
From where, Harry doesn’t ask.  He also doesn’t point out that they’ve just
“Ah, no,” Draco says, still holding his phone, already on his feet.  “The school is very clear that parents are not allowed to turn up as and when they like, especially not to interfere in disciplinary –”
“What –?” Harry tries to begin.  There was the Sorting Hat; there was Dumbledore; there was Harry and his house and his friends, hexing and shouting at him…
Watching Harry carefully, Sirius appeared to make a decision, there in the coffee shop.  He sighed, not reacting at all the way that he should have done.  “You poor child,” he said, his gaze piercing.  He picked up his muffin and set it down by Harry’s cup of tea.  “Eat this and stop worrying so much,” he commanded, as though Harry was breaking his heart.  His eyes were full of sympathy.  “It’s going to be fine.”
There’s an odd feeling in Harry’s chest, something like sadness and something like pity.  He really doesn’t know what they’re on about.  Dockers Dearborn is Caradoc, Neville’s uncle whose body was never found.  But then –
At four o’clock in the afternoon, on the thirty-first of October, 2008, in expensive jeans, a white t-shirt and his aviator jacket – a look which Draco has recently described as
"The hell are you doing?" Harry Potter asked, his grip loosening on Draco’s black muggle clothes.  And yet he was reacting with desire, his eyes blowing to a dark tunnel focus.
“Yeah,” Harry says, because maybe he does.  “Maybe,” he goes on, because that feels important.  “I dunno, mate,” he says, shaking his head over his pumpkin juice.  He’s chosen the vegetarian option today, a Spanish omelette, because he only has the roast out of habit.  “I’ve been obsessed with Malfoy for more than a decade, I reckon.”  It doesn’t seem odd to talk about him, now he’s started.  “Best turn-out in the world, when something happened.”
The edge of Harry’s folding case of mirrors is hard in his hand, digging in much like his wedding ring, which clacked against the case when he grabbed it off the nightstand.
With a wry smile, Hermione rolls her eyes.  She’s entirely poised, Ron’s engagement ring glinting on her finger.  “Like life,” she suggests, before giving him a look.  “We told Molly that we thought we’d leave the wedding till after –”
She almost makes him laugh.
“Harry,” says McGonagall again, dismissing him from the meeting, because she always has a lot to do.  “I don’t need a full set of references for two days’ supply work.  I trust your opinion, and checking the registers will take me less than five minutes.  Besides,” she adds, and it’s bizarre.  “There are a few things on which I’d like to hear his thoughts.  He’s quite the authority these days, to those of us in Transfiguration.”
He remembers Lily’s toy now, yellow with brown stripes and red cheeks, the size of Lily’s torso and head.  “Oh right.”  She loved it the moment she saw it, Harry could tell, and he’s never known how to tell her he loves her.  She’ll have it up here in Hogwarts.  It’s cute.  A bit odd.  Japan was their last and final family holiday, Harry supposes, and in a moment he wants to go back.  “What’s that got to do with a shopping centre?”
Draco drifts away as they get into the back and forth.  It goes on for a while, and in the corner of his eye Harry watches his unspeakable slink among groups of people he cannot possibly know.  He likes to piss off the old-guard Slytherin dads, but he’s wearing robes, here at this party, and he fits in.  Posh white wits are welcome anywhere, really, and Draco’s very funny.  Everyone knows that he’s come here with Harry, but this only makes him an entertaining pet.
“Hm.  And what’s his story?” asks Tone, as though he hasn’t been put off.  There’s the sound of the toaster, interrupting the pop beats.  Harry’s not sure if he’s fully woken up.
Text sent, the phone’s thrown away.  It clatters to the floor, because it’s never clear whether Draco knows the value of material things.  “Imagine my corrupting that,” he tells Harry wickedly, his eyes flat like a snake’s, his body so much stronger than it looks.
“Well, there’s one for you to keep,” Draco replied, content.  “Call it a souvenir.”
“I just think it’s a shame,” Granger said, taking another sip of cream and melting ice through her straw.  “They’d be so…  Do you think that he’ll ever?”
From what Harry can tell, Lupin lasts about a month.  It’s good going, Harry thinks.  He used to call it good going if he lasted a month.
“No,” he croaked truthfully, lying on his side and hurting.
In any case, the boy sighs, climbing in past her through the doorway.
A muggle
And here there’s the paw print.  There’s a postscript.
”  And here she makes an appropriate face, which is disgusted.  Ron nods as though he understands.
“Draco,” Granger says, too calmly.
When silence falls, it’s heavy and thick.  McGonagall is looking at the ceiling, clearly taking comfort in her sherbet lemon.
For a moment, the mirror shows Harry the door to his Hogwarts bedroom and then it shows the bedroom of his and Draco’s flat in number 12, Grimmauld Place.  The angle of reflection – by design – means that he can see where Draco is tucked up in the great grey bed, reading a book, surrounded by walls which will soon be sage green.
“You really wanted things out of your hands, didn’t you?” concluded Harry then, barely easing his way into the question.
“I’ve got crisps,” Harry says, continuing the hunt.  Draco loves crisps.
“What were you saying?” demands Harry then, back to the point.  “Voldemort.”
fit, and then…”
” Harry sneers, and Draco’s sure that he’s never heard anything like it.  He wants to intervene, but he doesn’t know how.  “For me to grow up just like you?  A bully and a thief?”
There’s a brief exchange when things have calmed down, from which Harry gathers that the older boy goes by Alfie.  He’s introduced as Nebuchadnezzar von Herrschenberg the thirteenth.  Harry supposes that Alfred might be a middle name.  He’s not sure how to cope with the idea that there have been twelve other Nebuchadnezzar von Herrschenbergs in the world, though he’s struck by the desire to watch Draco keep a straight face when he hears.
Because he’s being honest, Draco’s expression softens, and he looks so
They make it to Harry’s bed eventually and collapse, Draco in his underwear and Harry in his nightclothes, shuffled on quick.  Hours later, Harry wakes in the dark from a dream of Draco fucking him, which feels a lot like doing the fucking himself, likely because his unconscious mind only has limited reference points.
.  Not the way that Harry does to see these other people, in his dreams as in the past.
“You don’t need to sop to me,” Malfoy complains, because Harry can’t win, and Harry’s old enough to recognise a sulk.
Green eyes blaze at him.  “Anything would be better than moping around being
“I don’t know why you put up with me,” Harry insists, breathing in a shudder, wishing that he knew how to sound more like a man.
Harry swallows, looking down at the end of his chips and his pie and his pint.
“No it hasn’t,” Draco dismisses him anyway, blunt, not looking away, lying to his face.  “You’ve not shed a single tear,” he goes on the offensive.
He needs to fix this, Harry reminds himself.  Reality is less important.).
Harry Potter’s instincts were to keep the details quiet, as things went along, because there was something off with it all that he couldn’t put his finger on.  Draco wanted the adventure to be done with, but he returned the man’s memos – ignoring the fact that Potter had signed and sent in the remittance claim at the end of their first day together.
“It’s the middle of term,” Harry points out, emotion in his chest.
“We were hoping for the other,” Hermione chips in, crunching at a leftover, slightly burnt crust of pizza.
“I thought that it meant we were dating,” Harry tells Draco, thoughts full of him slipping off his slippers.  He looks up.
A muscle ticks in Ron’s jaw, the way it always does when they talk about Dominic and Ange.  “We’re still calling them her mum and dad,” he instructs.
Seamus guffawed, but Dean shook his head, clicking his fingers and pointing.  “I’ve been there!” he agreed.
Harry feels certain that at least some of the blank parchment must be letters to and from Sirius.  In the file with the newspaper clippings there are many more completed crosswords than there are pieces of correspondence, and the capital letters never match Lupin’s hand.
“Merlin, it’s hot,” Harry says to himself, surprised, his muscles aching as he slips from the broom.  There are lights in the distance and the headlamp of Sirius’s bike is beaming bright as he descends; Harry has to squint as it blinds him, trainers sinking into sand.  Above him there are hundreds of stars.
“Right,” agreed Harry, looking guilty.
“Me and my mates reckon we were all born too late,” Teddy tells him, flicking through the images, and Harry feels sad for him, because this cannot be true.  At his age Harry was four years out of a war.  “Look; I did this one on a filter.”  He hands over the phone.  “I thought that it was too naff to post.  Who does filters anymore?”
,” Pansy interrupts, and her cheeks are flushed when Harry looks at her.  “You’ll make a lovely mouse.”  She switches tack, ducking her chin to her shoulder, into fur.  “You can throw me down too,” she suggests, batting her lashes, and she makes it sound like innuendo.
And that’s it, Draco decides.  He’s leaving.  None of them have paid him the least bit attention since Lupin said hello, and no one will notice if he leaves, so he’s gone.
invite her?” Draco demands.
And Harry’s thought the same.  The thing is, Harry wants to believe in Albus Dumbledore, the wizard on the card from his first chocolate frog, the first thing to see him make a friend.  No one in the mirror was there to give him a present, but Dumbledore gave him a cloak.
His mother’s patronus was a small thing, Draco remembers.  A quail if not another game bird of some kind, easy to miss as it whipped and wheeled through the sky.  It was almost like a snitch, Draco thought, ever hunted and waiting to be caught.  It was the part of her that was always watching, always responding to changes in circumstance.
They’re all looking at him.  The man who’s not Harry looks startled, like a rabbit; Hermione’s face is in her hands.  Ron’s frowning, concerned, and –
Harry pauses.  The point of this sinks in.
Granger ignores him.  “
my fucking
There’s a shuffle of fingers – a click, Harry imagines – and then it feels distracting, insistent, intimate and odd.  Harry focuses on kissing the man in his arms, the touch of skin and bone filling his mind with softly pornographic images of Draco Malfoy’s body moving, lean and blond and hungry and brutal.  It makes him grin and fall into a kiss again, because it’s such a lovely fantasy.
”  Harry imagines that he can hear it being underlined.  “Done.  What’s next?”
Harry looks around them, at the trees and the cloudy sky, bluebells on bluebells while the birds sing.  “I want us to be here, Draco,” he says, his green eyes cautious.  “Where it’s nice.”
Harry swallows when the longing kicks in.  The first night that Hermione brought him to dinner at Grimmo, unexpectedly, Harry only remembers that he’d been having a bad day
“Yeah, well,” said Granger’s boyfriend now, puffing up.
Annie didn’t want AJ to take it, last they spoke, but Miss Gray the Year 5 teacher was suggesting that they should try for one of the nice schools in Chelmsford, which would effectively sort AJ into Ravenclaw or Slytherin.
“You’ll be glad to know that I take a stand on hexing muggles,” Harry’s dad is saying, unlike anyone who’s ever come into this house, and Harry feels terrified by how much he loves him.  It’s not a feeling which ends well.
Sirius looks at him.  He seems to have caught on.  He pushes hair out of his face, and he’s so
“I’m not asking for anything,” Harry Potter continued, earnest, green eyes and glasses.  “I said I owe you, didn’t I?”
” the voice bellows, and there’s the sound of apparition.  “The WASPs.
Dropping his eyes and then glancing to meet Harry’s, Draco takes a measured, resigned sip from his flute.  He grimaces almost invisibly as he swallows.
Granger rolled her eyes, shaking her head as she looked back to her boyfriend.  “Ginny’s a big girl,” she told the man.  “She knows him as well as we do.  If it was going to happen, then it would have done.  That’s all we can say.”
It was a lie, Lupin’s stuff about Sirius.  Perfectly designed to put Harry off.
It’ll be his head where the hair is thin, Harry thinks.  Ron’s started wearing a bobble hat from November through to spring like a baby.
“Shh-hh,” Draco says, scratching fingers into his hair and kissing him while he’s still blinking – removing the glass to the table where it skitters hard.  “That was me,” he apologises.  “I wasn’t thinking.”  He’s talking about letting Harry read his texts.
, but Harry kept this fact to himself.  “What sort of vine’s Hermione’s wand?”
“Will you talk to him about it?” Hermione asks with empathy, as though it’s possible that this could happen.  “I mean,” she returns to chastising, “not when you apologise for calling him a proxy of nearly
“We’re all glad that you aren’t dead, dear,” Andomeda comes out with eventually, as though it pains her to intervene.  She gives Harry a look.  “Too many people are.”
She’s biting her lip as she sits down, and Harry’s stomach sinks.  He’s not going to like whatever it is.  “I’ve been thinking,” says Hermione unnecessarily.  “I’ve spoken to Ron, and he says that he’s fine with whatever I want to do...”  She rolls her eyes.  “But he also said that we should tread carefully and that I should talk to you and that I’m not allowed to
“And has it been Kreacher?  Usually?”  Draco didn’t know why he was asking.
It was the sort of thing that no one expected to happen, and certainly not twice in the space of twenty-five years.  The deaths were accidental, for the most part, pure bad luck and collateral damage in a bumrush of a fight that stunned the soon-to-be former Professor of Defence against the Dark Arts and generally incapacitated the group of former Death Eaters, who had not allied themselves to the plot out of faith in their fallen master, not in all reality, surely, but out of desperation as their names sank down into infamy.
“Ron!” Harry shouted at him, because it was Ron.  “I’m calling Ginny cheap.”  His cheer sank as he realised it.
“I don’t even fancy her!” Harry declared, even as spilt blood was being siphoned off his face.  The aftershock of battle was making him shake.  There were tears in his eyes and he wanted to apologise.
Professor Dumbledore is pacing in front of his desk, fingers smoothing the end of his beard.  He’s wearing purple and orange, and he looks sprightly, alive.  Adrenaline floods through Harry’s nerves, and he doesn’t know how to react.  Every reason that he’s here escapes from his head.
She lapses into silence, after this, frowning.  She squeezes Harry’s knee and sets her head back against the headboard, squeezing her eyes shut, in the end.  Harry thinks that he can see every one of her emotions.
“What progress,” says James, before he fills his mouth with pasta.  Harry gets the impression that he won’t be passing on the information, which is likely good for Grimmo’s accounts.
Now he hears her voice again, telling him to
He needs to do work on the wards, full stop.  He needs –
Like Bill, Remus is wearing dark colours – heavy boots and tar-coloured jeans, a deep brown roll-neck jumper with an ugly cardigan over the top.  His skin is covered in heavy, patchy freckles as though he’s been spending days outside.  They’re almost the same colour as his hair, which is gleaming gold-blond.
Draco opens his eyes, not seeing anything.
“You getting sick of Kreacher’s love and attention?” Harry jokingly accuses, instead of talking to Teddy about any of this.
It takes Draco about seven seconds to work it all out.  He makes a face, but he doesn’t say no.  “I knew that this was going to happen,” he complains, glancing at the mirror’s frame on his side, back to the glass, to Harry.  He’s not talking about the party, which means that he’s talking about…  “You can’t resist coming up with these little ideas of yours to save the world – and now
“Mine’s set to go,” Neville insists, looking betrayed.
They’ve given up on social distance between them.  Harry’s been too busy keeping up with bumping arms and fussing at the gap between Draco’s collar and his scarf.  Putting Draco in his hat, though he hasn’t today, because this quidditch bit isn’t part of the date, if this is a date.
” Malfoy swears at him, low, his eyes like darts and his expression livid.  “In case you’ve forgotten, I’m the one who lives with
Right on cue, before Draco can react, the floo flares to life and Granger’s boyfriend emerges, holding a parcel of what might well be meat, wrapped in white paper.
,” he spits heavily, biting his hairline, and Harry cradles his head, willing his own hand wet.  Draco licks his tongue into his ear, scraping teeth when Harry jumps, swearing, overdoing the spell.  He does it again; it feels like filth and Harry can’t help his reaction.  “You want no one to acknowledge that you exist,” Draco breathes, dark and quiet, goading, “but when
He’s had enough, he decides, though, looking.  He’s moves Draco’s hand to his own stiff erection, showing him what to do; he sets him higher on his back and shudders as Draco complains, watching him in anticipation, biting his red lip.
Harry can imagine him in the common room, deep in an armchair by the dying fire, his mum holding her knees in another like an owl, both of them grinning at each other.
“It was fine,” Harry promises, turning down his mouth in dismissal.  He’s glad it was him, instead of his father.  The bloke was pretty rough.  “I never saw him again.”
“Who’s that?” Harry asks, confused.
Pansy wouldn’t have judged him, that’s the thing.  The Parkinsons have always been clever, and Pansy the cleverest, as far as Draco is concerned.  She would have understood.
“And the rest of us,” Narcissa confirms, as though it’s quite the joke.  Draco sometimes wonders about the way that his mother was raised.  “But we cannot let the
“I’ll have you know that he’s the one who came onto
And the man keeps chanting as they swirl into new existence, some of the noise left behind but most of it brought with them.  They appear with a pop, but the keening, high-pitched hyena’s laugh of a man terrified out of his wits is much louder.  It’s enough to send
,” Draco agrees, his own hair flopping at his temple.
Taking another bite of his sandwich, Sirius returned the chair to solid ground, raising his eyebrows.
For a while, there’s silence – warm, though Harry doesn’t trust it.
Draco nodded, because he did.
With another glass of wine, Harry doesn’t head outside.  He returns to his office, which is only up two flights of stairs.  Passing his desk and his bookshelves and Puff, who’s perched, maybe sleeping – though he wakes at the sound of the door and breathes pompoms, making Harry smile – Harry goes straight through the door at the back, into the holder of his position’s private rooms.  The wards are stronger here.
James Potter watches his son escape from the room, his eyes dark as he glances at Draco.  There’s something in his expression, but Draco doesn’t know how to read it.  He may also have figured out that Draco is full of shit.
There’s a sound of a snort, a guffaw that’s not from the memory, and it’s from his dad, Harry realises, glancing at him.
“It’s your wardrobe,” Harry finds himself mumbling.
he pauses, breathing out.  His tone is entirely calm and entirely bitter, and Harry thought that he’d only ever sounded like this after Sirius died.
Harry’s waiting for him to report that Cho’s divorced whoever it was at her wedding and come out as gay.  “You’ll have to figure it out,” Harry decides, because a line is needed, suppressing a laugh and feeling like he’s winning again.  He pats Draco’s warm chest twice, to be patronising and because it feels nice, pulls down the brim of his hat and takes his leave through the front door to disapparate.
It doesn’t take until the morning, inevitably.
he hears himself agreeing with them.  He’s the bride’s first mate, and Hermione’s the captain, and the wedding will be like they’re on a voyage after buried treasure (“If that’s how you want to imagine it, Harry.”).
This is a good point.  Harry gave his children mirrors to take with them to school.  He keeps them close at hand, a fold of four in his own back pocket, on the table at the moment.  “Do people still put ads in the paper?” he tries instead, mostly joking.
…”  Sirius scoffs archly, almost making Harry laugh.  “It’s a good thing for you, because it’s obvious that Lily –“
Harry looks at him now, turning just his head and frowning.  “I’ve said something wrong,” he comes out with.
Her green eyes are distraught, glazed with tears, and Harry recognises them as his own.
Now, there’s a story to this, which comes up rather too often to Draco’s mind.  It involves a lunch and Molly Weasley, an argument and a flight to the Forest of Dean.  The moment that he alludes to it, Draco feels like a cad, because it doesn’t lack for significance, no matter how much he and Harry make jokes about the whole business.
He is not at all convinced by this suggestion, nonetheless.  As far as he can remember, Sirius Black caused a huge amount of fuss when no fuss at all was needed, acting out when he could have easily sat through a few more dinner parties and walked away at eighteen, twenty-one, twenty-four…  James Potter and Lupin seem to be much the same in this regard, seeing a dead man everywhere for want of seeing him anywhere and for want of seeing him in death.
“I’ve talked him down from describing it as consensual self-prostitution,” Ron offers, drinking a beer.  “We’ve had Teddy round,” he explains.
There’s no reply to this, in any case.  Harry wrinkles his nose, remembering the mess that his godfather gets himself into when he’s flirting.  “He’s broken your heart,” he finds himself saying, a flint-spark of hard anger inside him at the thought.
These thoughts don’t make sense, Harry realises, as they come out of him.  And yet –
He feels like a teacher from the 1960s, telling all these Ministry Slytherins,
McGonagall doesn’t quite let him leave.  “Madam Granger and Mr Weasley will be arriving ahead?” she double-checks.
A complete and utter bastard, James is frowning guilelessly, and he smiles shortly.  “Uncle Moony will be safe home soon,” he declares, as though he’s decided, looking Harry in the eye, desperately posh and clipped and drawling, no genuine warmth to his voice, Harry tells himself.  “I promise you.”
Draco looks lost at the comment about Harry’s father, so Harry waves a hand to tell him not to worry about it.
“Harry,” Lupin says, looking at his friend and then back to the man’s son, crossing the remainder of the floor and turning mild, greeting Harry with a handshake of all things, two hands to Harry’s one.  “Harry, it’s you.”  He doesn’t seem to know what to do with himself.  “Look at you.  Merlin,” he says, “I’m so sorry, I…  I’m sorry.”
Ginny’s giving him a look now, as if she can see from his face exactly what he’s thinking.  “Go and contemplate your emotions,” she instructs, as she likely should have told him ten years ago.  Her eyes are flat earth as she puts up her guard.  It’s so much like Draco’s, though Ginny’s resting expression is soft.  She’s Draco’s opposite, really, only ever putting on a guise, her kind heart needing to be hidden.  “Then come with us to George’s.”  She rattles this off briskly, putting distance between them, leaving Harry because he long ago hurt her, always and ever again, his own heart surely something other than kind.  “There’s live jazz.  I’m rounding everyone up.”
Piss easy.”  Another shrug.  It’s as though he’s
There was silence for a moment, and then Granger’s boyfriend seemed to take offence.  “Mum’s been in a much better mood since Percy had his second,” he insisted, ripping open one packet of crisps and eating as he talked.  “Nothing happened at Christmas and you saw her at the weekend.”
Harry frowns at her.  He’s just explained –
when Harry pulls back.  It’s a kiss.  It’s Harry’s first with someone other than Ginny since over a year before they got together.  It makes his heart flutter violently, and there’s a lightning bolt slicing up his face.
Draco mouthed, making a face.  His eyes were wild and wide, for a few moments more.
When Harry arrived at Draco’s flat that night, he fell out of the floo so drunk that he couldn’t stand up.
“My cloak?” Potter suggests, for some reason, looking pleased.
“You all right?” he asks.
It’s pathetic in the extreme.  “Potter, you don’t trust him because he grew up with more than two galleons to rub together.”  The coffee is sinking in now, and Draco’s mind is clear.  He should probably change out of his dressing gown, he thinks as he moves to find some toast.  “He offends your sensibilities.”
Teddy’s only just gone upstairs.
There’s another option, Harry supposes, but he knows that the floo won’t be able to help him with it.  Mr Ollivander and Luna are coming today, and they won’t be taking seats at the front.  They won’t be flooing up, and they certainly won’t be apparating, because Ollivander can’t risk anything like that, not even a portkey, not for years now.  The Cruciatus won’t let him suffer it.
“I did it for an easy life,” Draco counters, bald.  “And that’s what I got.”
“I….”  The old wizard is spluttering, embarrassed, going red.  It seems clear to Harry that he doesn’t actually remember.
“I’m not sure that’ll work,” Ron remarks, leafing through papers.
, spiralling up and Harry thinks that the idea is uncanny, but it might be the Orbital, the M25.
It was a strange desire that he felt at eleven, he reflects every time in the dream, to see himself in the immediate impossible moment.  To see an image that he could only ever grow out of.  His desire wasn’t a dream of discovery, a fantasy for what could come next, but for his own world to be unreal, for himself to exist in another.
ago,” Harry yells back, too comfortable in Draco’s bedroom – always so fucking comfortable.  His voice is cracking now, deep with tears.  “I was still at the Ministry; why are you…”
.  “My office is a catastrophe.  I need to fill out an incident report for the Nowhere Room and conjure new carpet.  Atria and Oratories has samples.”
He looks like a proud and impossible sneak thief who’s bullied his way into Draco’s flat – because he’s a father who looks like his
“What are you doing with that cloak?” he asks blearily, sitting up in bed because Harry forgot to apparate somewhere else.
They wake up for lunch, and Harry gives head to someone packing cock for the very first time, with very little planning, insisting on Draco calling him
He watched Harry do all this, Draco, sharp eyes glinting while his mouth didn’t move.  He remained leaned against the wall by his side of the bed, a black spot set against a great square of grey, against white.  Always so casual, with one leg cocked; always so posed, his arms crossed behind his back.  He looked to Harry like part of an abstract painting, a circle or a line.
“Shall I make a pot?” Potter suggests, drawing his blood-red brimstone wand and waving it in short flicks absently towards the cabinets.
“To do
No, Harry thinks.
has dragged it all…
“We’re not the only ones who’ve noticed.  Other people…”
The morning after Lupin’s return, at half-past ten on Wednesday the twenty-sixth of March, 2008, according to the clock on the wall, Draco finds himself highly agitated.  Harry appears while Draco’s still in his dressing gown, drinking coffee and working his way through some toast.  The school holidays go on till the weekend, and Harry’s likely claimed to the others that he has work to do, but for now he’s here, casual and rambling in Draco’s kitchen.
As it is, Harry’s been more focused on Malfoy.  He’s been sitting on the Polyjuice revelation for two weeks.  “I mean, all right, Malfoy’s gay.  Fine.”  He’s come to terms with this now.  He’s had to share the information so the story makes sense; he doesn’t think that Malfoy would care if Ron gossiped.  “I mean, it tracks out.”
“No, no, you need to get it out,” Ron insists, pedantic, chinking Harry’s glass with his own inappropriately.  “You’ve at least three months’ purging ahead of you, I reckon,” he says like a dad.  “You rant and rave and froth, mate,” he instructs him.  “We’re here.”
“Young Teddy,” Draco greets his cousin, with a nod to Andromeda.  He’s never entirely joking with these formalities.
James Potter looked at him, blinking as though Harry was a stranger.  Harry recognised the feeling, because he’d been feeling it for months, on and off.
And yet he also had absolutely zero sense of etiquette.  “You done that before, then?” Harry asked, as if to continue the conversation.
Ron’s leaning towards him, pink but more in control.  “We were having a round of kinky chemsex before you arrived,” he excuses his wife, sniggering, and Harry thinks that he must be joking.  “I’m sure that you can resurrect your old appeal,” he manages to tell Harry, as though the joke is on him.  “You’ll need to woo him,” Ron suggests, very seriously.  “Like you said.”
“You’re not a shit –” Harry says, still reacting to what’s being said, his sweating hands full of soft knitting again, dark green, to take his arms.
“What are you doing for Lord Mountbatten’s birthday?” Draco changes the subject.  He means Teddy.  Harry loves that he knows that both dates are close in April, though it’s a slip for him to admit it.
With a wry grin, Harry deflects.  “Why don’t you go and ask your aunt?” he suggests, nodding over to where Granger’s talking with Lily Potter and Angelina Weasley.  He offers the shell for Teddy to take in two hands, attention but little fear in his frown.  “Watch that you’re careful with it, right?” he says.  Teddy solemnly accepts, walking slowly across the grass.
It was that corruption of innocence by which the war was won.  It was that corruption of innocence which Dumbledore must have known that Harry was capable of, no matter that Harry was too thick to see it coming.
He trailed off, laughing, apparently unable to finish his sentence.  Breathing hard, he pressed all of his fingers to his eyes underneath his glasses, clenching his jaw before he spoke again.
“Yes you can.”  Harry, curse him, knew well that Draco remembered many things.
Albus says that he hates the comparisons, but Harry can’t believe that this is true.  Two years as a reserve was enough for James to give up entirely on the idea of competing with his parents’ legacies.  Harry has secret hopes for Lily and Gryffindor, because he wants to make Minerva proud – even if Minerva says that she’s proud of all four of his children.
He shakes the man’s hand.  Potter’s grip is, inevitably, firm and secure, just like his hazel-blue gaze.  “I appreciate the sentiment,” Draco tells him.  “I too spoke out of turn.  You are an excellent duellist.”
She doesn’t look like a painting, Harry tells himself.  She’s not writhing or jumping or trying to cover herself up; she’s sitting on an elegant settee with her ankles crossed.  The baby covers most of her front.
“He has done nothing of the kind!”
It’s nice to listen to him, Harry finds, thinking that maybe Liz’s radio bosses know what they’re about after all.
Katie Bell is bisexual, apparently, but not looking for now.  George and Angelina have always had an agreement that their marriage isn’t sexually exclusive, but they don’t tell Harry what this means in practice, and he cannot imagine how it works.  They seem happy.  Lee Jordan brings his own group with him from the media – oddly dazzling when he arrives, not talking about his old tarantula.
With…”
As for Pansy, she blinks.  “You took him back to that place under your aegis, yes?”
“Did it, now?” comes the short reply.
, sweetheart,” Draco croaked, in pain.  He didn’t resent it in the least, whatever had been done to him.  Everyone else had had a good time; he’d seen it.  What was he, as a casualty?  He wished, he wished deeply, that Luna would punish him more.
Later, Harry’s cooking, and Draco’s looking at his phone.
The thing was, Draco possessed the very vivid memory of Granger dancing with Viktor Krum in some rather splendid periwinkle robes.  He’d been spitting with jealousy, and Pansy had arched an eyebrow at him every time that she’d caught him glaring.
Finally, there’s a file of correspondence.
.  Words don’t seem natural to him, self-expression.
“All of them,” answers Hermione, because she can’t resist a direct question.  Though she’s exaggerating, really.
“All right,” Moony interrupts, not saying more, not promising anything yet.  He looks like he regrets what he said in the dark.  Good, Harry thinks.
And in three years, Draco’s never thought of posing that very practical question to the research that he’s been conducting.  It’s beautiful in its simplicity, its audacity.  It’s –
It was then that Draco felt his eyes burn.  It was only the half-bottle of wine that he’d drunk, surely, he thought, and he breathed through it.  Eventually the feeling died back a little.  He scolded himself, because this usually only happened when he was trying to knock one out in his own shower, now, this year, in 2006.  Here he was, one false move away from ruining what had been a very decent fuck, and the next one that Harry so clearly wanted.  All because he didn’t like to think of the past, when it was hardly as if it could hurt him.  Stop it, Draco, he told himself, stop –
Smirking, James is serving himself lunch, a bowl popped in from nowhere, and Harry feels stupid, standing up on his own.  Reluctantly, awkwardly, he returns to his chair.
James scoffs on the other side of the drawing room’s coffee table.  “The balance has gone,” he says, as though Harry is being obtuse.  They’re surrounded by golden sunshine-yellow.  “I’ve seen you; you’re constantly correcting for it.”
“Always late at night,” Harry agreed, a gleam in his green eyes.
, when Harry needed him, and –
Eyes narrowing, Remus seems to realise that he is not being asked an idle question.  Dumbledore is waiting; he goes on.
about his own thoughts on Malfoy, and Ginny’s fiancé might think –  “Yeah,” he just about manages, when Matías glances at him, feeling panicked.  “He’s – different.”  He’s not different at all.  “He’s all right.”  He’s the best thing Harry’s ever encountered, and it took fifteen years to take it in.  “He’s coming with Luna,” Harry remembers to tell Neville, who nods, clearly chastened.
He thinks about going home to his flat, but his heart is pumping, a little sickly, and in the end he goes downstairs.  He takes each step one by one, because no one, not even him, would risk apparating to the veil room.
Feeling up the small of Harry’s back, putting Harry on hooks, Draco says nothing for a long time.  Then – “You told me that you wanted to be someone else,” he says, not answering the question, going somewhere different, talking about a morning they spent in the Forest of Dean.
They both died young, Harry and his dad.  They both died for friends and family, supposedly.  They both died at the same curse, the same hand.
Harry shrugs, even so.  McGonagall doesn’t take long, and then people are moving in their seats to stand up, making noise but not chatting.  Cameras flash and everyone is in their best robes.  “Something coherent with a couple of jokes,” he reports to Hermione, as they stand up too.  “That’s what I was asked for.  I think I did a good Harry Potter, don’t you?”
“An aficionado, are you?” James proposes anyway, picking up on this and pushing.  He turns on the bench and crosses a leg over his knee, tucking his hand underneath it.  “I like the early work.  It’s always nice to meet another –”
Draco’s eyes drop to Harry’s mouth, his hand sweeping even as he brandishes his fork.  “Your face is
There was no quidditch being played during lockdown, Harry will remember, which was hard for everyone in their house.  Ginny’s Magpies were bored and Ginny was bored with them, looking up exercises for her players to do in their gardens while cajoling them about diet, because they had nothing else to spend their money on, without parties, without brooms, without life outside.  The children thought that Ginny’s teaching was boring, and said so – too much cajoling about essay style and no animals running wild in the classroom – but they enjoyed the mandated daily exercise, which Ginny made sure to tell the school.
They’re down on stone – Draco can feel it under his knees – and there’s an intense, brilliant flush of
He didn’t swear, Harry Potter, as a rule.
to go back to Hogwarts, so I never got Potions, and Hermione and McGonagall had to drag me through Defence, Transfiguration and Charms.  Arthur did me a favour.”  He rolls his eyes, as if he knows the next question.  “And, no, I don’t want to work at the Ministry forever, but for now it’s perfectly fine, thanks.”  Fanks, or not quite.
“I need to go back to the Department,” Draco comments, though it’s not actually true, or maybe it is; he can’t remember.  They join an orderly queue.  “I made him practise on half of his clothes.”
a risk.  But this is a Gryffindor match, and apparently that’s part of the deal.  The boyfriend’s eyes are lit with adrenaline, nodding his consent to the sale.  He’s grinning, almost on his toes as he proudly presents his Gringotts debit card, making the most expensive purchase that he’s ever made in his life.
He’s not sure why he’s saying this, Harry.  He’s not sure where he is.
In a moment, Harry recalls that London only boasts a single all-wizarding five-star hotel, and this can’t be it because they’re much too high up.
” Draco snaps at him.  How hard is this to understand?  “If it weren’t for Harry…”
Potter says nothing, holding Lily, who’s squeezed her eyes shut against the side of his head.  He offers Black a serious look.
“You have to figure out how things might’ve happened,” Harry continues, glancing up.  He’s sitting with spread knees like an oaf; Draco’s slouched back elegantly and as Harry watches, he casually hooks one leg over the other.  “Attractive people can get away with more.  So it’s useful,” Harry concludes logically, “to be aware of who’s attractive.”
Harry could feel the tears swelling in his eyes.  It was a stupid question, he knew, and he was embarrassed for himself.  But everyone was so happy, here at this party, and Harry wanted Malfoy to be happy too.  All Harry ever did was make people sad.
THE END.
“Nearly everyone ends up with someone from the village, Prongs,” Lupin points out mildly.  He’s picking up the paper that was tucked underneath the edge of his plate.  It seems to be missing the outer fold – the front and back page.  Harry spots the extra sheet in front of Sirius.
, Merlin burn them, fucking –
“If you like,” Harry says despite himself.  There’s a flutter of excitement in his heart at the thought.  “Once I’ve had some practice,” he insists.
He sees how the next few years will go, at Easter, and he thinks that he’s seeing it right.  The kids will come down to number 12 between terms and see Ginny in Hogsmeade whenever they like, both her and Harry at quidditch.  It’s easy with magic; there’s the floo.  Ginny’s cleaned out the very last of her things, clearly happy in her house or at least the location.  She’ll buy somewhere soon, Harry expects.  She has wealth of her own, which makes all of this easy.
Now they’re both crying, and Draco thinks that he’s been waiting to cry these tears for ten years, which is forever.  He huffs a breath from the back of his wrist before he speaks, circling back because he doesn’t know what else to do.  “Luna poisoned me, I hope you realise.”  He says it approaching a joke, brushing his hand through Harry’s hair, fingers twitching.  “It will take some effort to keep up.”
“Ready or not, Perce…”
“I’m just glad that she made a decision,” George tells him, very open.  James studiously doesn’t reply.  “She’s never known what she wants.  Either that, or she can’t admit when she’s lost.”
“Which of course led me to find out that you’ve been raising Teddy’s father’s friends from the
again,” Teddy suggests, resolutely good-humoured in the morning, even when he’s hungover.  He does a voice, sending the message.  “
In August, when James’s OWL results come in, Ginny finds them frustrating.  They’re a calculation, in the end, based on his marks from the first to fourth years of Hogwarts.  Unlike the muggles, the Ministry makes clear in a shirty little note, the students of Hogwarts will be keeping what they’ve been given.
He’s very close to the edge when he speaks again, at last, Draco Malfoy.  “I could fuck you and call out the name of your father?” he suggests with a grunt, as though it’s absurd, the dirtiest joke that’s come into his head, distantly related to Harry’s line about ghosts.
“Why aren’t you in Scotland?” Draco snaps, frozen where he stands by his bed, still dressed.
“What’re you doing here, Malfoy?” Harry snaps at Draco, who finds himself cowed against the arm of the tan leather sofa.  There’s no wriggling out of the accusation in his green eyes.
“Good Gryffindor, Harry,” is Hermione’s reaction, wrinkling her nose.  Her clothes are creased from the day she’s spent at her desk, lucky cow.  “What is that stuff and how much have you used?  You’ll have scared off the cats.”
The man shakes his head, sloshed, holding out an arm for her to fall into.  “It’s been a long time,” he says, and he seems to have an inkling that Granger doesn’t.  “And it’s early yet; let him sulk for a bit.”
Harry’s less drunk than he expected to be, though everything’s fuzzy and warm.  Everything feels light, and he’s enjoyed the bouncy room a lot (“Potter, stop bouncing at me –”
With a sigh, Harry tries to let it go.  He rolls his eyes, shaking his head, sniffing and blinking quickly.  “I don’t care,” he decides – and he tries to be reasonable.  “It’s not like Ron’s ever told me how long he spent pining for Hermione.”
in this context,” he says, not looking up from the paper, and he might have forgotten Harry’s here.  “It would make me a very happy old bastard indeed.”
,” Lupin snapped, and it was at James.  Nobody listened.  Lupin pulled his wand as though forgetting that he couldn’t disapparate, before crossing the room and tutting in frustration.  “Lily, keep him here,” he said, not specifying who.
He looks down at the village and the manor house, and it’s all the same place, the buildings and the land.  It looks like a map from up here, and Harry knows how to read maps.  He thinks he knows the way.
He should fuck off if he’s fucking off, he thinks – and it’s the first of September.
That’s the difference between playing as an amateur and working as a senior professional, he told himself at the time.
“Yeah, I know,” Harry says, the room too bright around them.
She sighs, gathering strength.  “Tell me that you haven’t brought Harry’s dad back from the dead.”
“Oh Ron.”  Granger’s rolling her eyes; Draco can tell.  “People always say that about women in positions of power.  She’s no more cut-throat than a wizard would be.  I suppose you’d say that Robards made it to where he is by acting like a happy little lamb?”
“So,” Lupin finishes.  “Is it Sirius Black, the one who’s here?”
“Obviously, it was outclassed by the moment when she said I do,” Potter concedes, irritated, adjusting his glasses.  He was expecting a laugh, Draco thinks.  “And then when
He takes after Andromeda, Teddy, in appearance, most of the time.  Even Bellatrix too, with his darker hair.  The boy has been interested in appearing as himself for the past few years – in part, Draco suspects, because he’s not allowed to use his metamorphmagus skills at his muggle primary, which seems to enjoy sending letters home about hair dye.  Draco suspects that this will all change when the boy goes off to Hogwarts, but Teddy also possesses a stately kind of centredness which reminds Draco of Andromeda if not his own mother, so he can’t imagine the boy ever becoming prone to vagaries.
“I’m very angry with you,” Sirius says, his tone deep and self-mocking, as though it hurts him to be earnest.  His skin is pale in the night, his hair like ink, and he looks regal, impossible to disturb.  His hand rests on Buckbeak’s neck, still stroking, as though any displeasure he feels will result in Harry being gored.
They get there in the end.
Well.
“Oh, complete fucking bollocks, mate.”
I fancy?  And the answer, as always, as forever,” he finished with a flourish, “it was Hermione Granger.”
For a long, certain instant, Harry gets the upper hand, wrenching his wrist free, grabbing his dad’s elbow.  He moves to disapparate, swishing his stick of holly even as a shoulder slams into his, hard and shocking.  The world turns, and he sees the drawing room appear around them –
Draco took a glug of his pint, trying not to despair.
Draco’s eyes are hard and pale like stone, like the sky at dawn, blue-grey-white, the weather ever changing, the colour of everything new.  Caught up in the moment, the day that this is, Harry finds it difficult to breathe.  He can feel the movement of lungs in his chest.
Kreacher’s informed him that Granger and her boyfriend are holed up in the library, both just returned from work, so Draco treads cautiously up the stairs to the sound of voices.  He pauses on the landing.
“We were all certain that his was Lily, but now she was a fox, now she was a doe, now she was a hawk…”  Lupin rolls his eyes, just a touch, as though this is a very James Potter thing to have happened.  “The doe seemed rather egotistical and she was a fox by the exam, so that was what we went with.”
“Yeah.”  He bounced on his toes for a second, nodding as though he was making sense of something, reaching a decision.  He didn’t answer.
“You never saw him in school,” his mum goes on, not letting him go.  “He did loads of stuff like this, messing around.  He turned his hands into treestumps – came to a test with toadstools for knuckles and still he made top of the class.  Drove me batty,” she promises, squeezing, and Harry can imagine exactly the feeling of indignation.  “He goes looking for trouble,” she promises, and Harry can’t look at her.  “Something like this was always going to happen – it used to happen every three months.  I’ve been telling Padfoot…”
At Hogwarts, as Harry steps up to the platform in front of Dumbledore’s tomb, there are several more bright flashes of light, and Harry knows exactly what they are.  There are more than there were for Neville, maybe, though this is likely only Harry’s perspective, the feeling of being under scrutiny.  Knowing what they all want to see.
They go for a walk in the mountains, along the path from Moony’s bench and his tree.  Sirius tells them that this is the plan, and somehow Moony only emerges when it’s already time to go, everyone showered and dressed.  He and Sirius take the motorbike, to a catcall from Tone while Harry’s dad pretends to wipe a tear from his eye.  Sirius revs the engine; Moony ignores them as they drive off, saying something that makes Sirius laugh.
Harry hasn’t used the resurrection stone on Draco, Draco reminds himself, and he shouldn’t use it ever again, because the thing is powerful beyond the telling.  The elder wand lies buried.  And so even if Draco knows the theory, there is very little chance that he would be able to find his way out the veil if he fell inside.  He
“And I’m not a dog,” Sirius replies, as if to say,
Lupin states dismissively, and Draco remembers to keep his own feelings in check.
“Er.”  Teddy is a little pink, and his voice seems higher than usual, now.  “Me and Harry like to wind up Cousin Draco sometimes.  Once we pretended that a hinkypunk ate my toe.”
Harry pulls away from Sirius and Buckbeak, moving into roots where they break up the ground, backing up to a tree, which Harry thinks must be an ash,
“Nah.”  Sirius wrinkles his nose, changing gear without pause.  “Remus was only gay in the eighties.”  He says it definitively, darkly, and Harry finds himself blinking again.  “I wasn’t on the scene and there was a

“You don’t
“I want to go home,” Harry finds himself saying, and it comes out of him half-choked.
James looks at her, wry.  “You might as well be our daughter.”
, Potter?” he despairs, gesturing again.
Instead, he carried on explaining, because it was all at the front of his mind and it was late, so he wasn’t able to assess whether or not it was time to shut up.
“You look exactly like your father,” a wizard is saying to him, later.  “But you have your mother’s eyes,” he adds sagely.
Draco remembers Harry Potter’s patronus very well.  He remembers it running him down in third year, the sensation of it much like a giant Fizzing Whizzbee crossed with milky hot chocolate.  Unexpectedly euphoric.  The stag was terrifying, hurtling through the air, but Draco can imagine it majestic at rest, proud and short-tempered, the perfect prize for any discerning killer.  James Potter.  Of course.
February wind is rushing in through the door, though it closes when Harry gives it a look.  Around them, the hallway is a warm, cheerful pink, which Harry picked though everyone thinks it was Ginny.
He looks like he loathes everything that light has ever touched, and he stinks of cigarette smoke.
“Draco did all this because he loves you,” Hermione says, and it hurts like a knife between Draco’s ribs.  “Everyone sees that, so no one’s going to say…”
Sensibly, in Harry’s opinion, Malfoy doesn’t respond to this.
He’s looking at Harry as though he only makes life difficult.  “I’m fairly certain that I’m about to be put on a portkey.”
A great deal of mock sincerity.  “The time for backpacks is passed, Padfoot.”
he thinks.
tiny Harry agrees, sounding older than six.  Intelligent.  Much quicker than Harry thinks of himself being.
“He didn’t
“Let’s,” agrees Harry, in his posh voice.
His dad is smirking, when Harry looks at him.  “Has no one explained to you how wizarding photography works?”
They stayed in bed until dinner time, though from this day forward Draco only ate with the rest of the house when he was invited, at least until the end of this story.
and it had been
– identifies as bi and called him a fucking embarrassment.
“Fuck off; get away from me,” Draco hears his own voice, sinking his forehead into the crook of the man’s neck.  “I’m not safe.”  Harry smells like the seaside, buckets and spades and starfish and sugar.  Draco thinks that he might be dreaming.  “Go back to Hogwarts.  You can’t –”
“Oh, I see,” Draco says.  “Yes, this is a terrible idea.”  Harry’s not even sure what Draco’s doing here, besides catching them.
, the short E, ᛖ.  Its colour’s a flinty black-blue, and Draco’s arm is red.  He’s calmed like a jolt to the chest.  “I dare say that the sunstroke isn’t helping,” she chides.
Draco has no idea what he means.  “Pardon?”
There’s a road to one side of him, railings on the other, and Harry’s sure that his father is inside their domain.  He can’t see where, but that makes sense.
Harry nodded.  “I thought so,” he said with the faintest of smiles.  His next question was soft.  “How many people is it who know?”
“You know full well,” Draco tells him, “that I expect to be a prodigy at every task I set my mind to.”  His tone is partly distracted, and Harry knows that his eyes are on the road, his own mirror.  “This is, as ever, emphatically humiliating, both as I am forced to recognise my own shortcomings and as you prove yourself naturally superior.”
Harry should have talked about these things with Ginny over the years – the reasons why he’s never quit.  She used to tell him that he should talk about his feelings more, whenever he did.  Like that time in school when he thought that he might be possessed.
When Draco turned off the water, the man smelled only like a dog, which was a mild improvement.  He moaned, leaning heavily on Draco’s shoulder, his head hung and his eyes closed.  “’ve you seen Draco Malfoy?” he asked in a slur, before laughing as though this was some sort of joke.
He went back to the bar, despite himself, because the dancing crowd was belting out Weird Sisters hits from school that he’d never known the words to.  There was someone new there, who recommended him Jägermeister again.  Realising that Ginny and Matías must have ordered too much and none of these recommendations were genuine, Harry felt low, entirely unnecessarily.  He asked for a whiskey instead and let his ears steam, a burn in his throat as he rambled away, his water and the glass left behind.
“Who said anything about taking?” Rosmerta suggests in the Broomsticks, as Harry pulls the pouch of floo powder from the back of his jeans.  “I only want a look.”
“What
”  He’s waving a hand, fiddling with his burger to take out the salad and resettle the bun.  “
Harry shakes his head.  It’s been a while, he supposes, but it’s not unexpected.  This time of year, when the heat starts to settle, he’s usually dreaming about Cedric or Sirius, one thing or the other.  This morning it was the other.  “I’ve always had nightmares,” he explains, his throat tight, which makes him cough.  “Everyone has nightmares,” he manages, before taking another swallow of cold.
His mum snorted with a wink just for Harry, moving her cup to be given some coffee.  “
And you think that a cupboard is enough to put me off?  I used to wank over Lee fucking Jordan and his quidditch sneers, Harry, and I’d had my father in my ear since birth, telling me that Zabini and her boy were tolerable company, but they’d never be like us, never never no.  You’ve not seen it, how insatiable I truly am.  I’m…
As the unicorn canters to a charge, to a blitz, to the night, Sirius lets out a sound of sheer boredom.  “
“That makes no sense –” Harry tries to interrupt.
When he dares listen again, Sirius is saying something else.  “You know how it goes,” he’s concluding, long-suffering.  “Some of us are born to be strapping and manly…”
Potter snatches him into a full, back-slapping embrace, laughing again.
“I know that there are other people in the world,” Harry tries to explain.  “And Lily, don’t…  I’m still me?”  She sobs again, breaking Harry’s heart.  “We have a lot in common,” he tries to explain to his sons.  This might be true.  “We were bumping into each other.  We’ve not even decided that we’re dating.”
, do you?”
“It’s because Ron’s a mess,” Harry manages, and – and he finds himself returning to solemnity.  “He’s never cried about Fred.  He gets stuck.”
They whisk through the business, and Harry supposes that if Hermione had been there, or Draco or maybe even Ron, they might have paused for longer on the question of how everything came about.  Harry too might have taken in a few more of the details, question marks and implications.
,” explains Sirius, the words tumbling out of him with honesty.  When he says them, he’s not looking at Harry like a child, but still as though they’re close, as though Harry’s his godson.  “He deserted.  He left behind his sister and her husband – his best friend from school.  All his other mates and his nephew…”
“Oh mate, no,” Granger’s boyfriend tells Potter kindly, holding out his own glass for the man to fill up.  Draco shuts his eyes, just for a moment, his fatigue overwhelming.  He’s still perched on the end of the sofa.  “Sirius – we only knew him a few years, poor bastard.”
“One won’t kill you,” he says, standing closer to Draco than a second ago, his features quite legible in the slanted light from the house.  “Though I often think…”  He spins out the thought with his other hand, his own cigarette idling through the air.  “It may well be the addiction that makes them soothing.”
“You sold out your entire house,” Lupin repeats, with nothing but the slightest frown between his eyes.
“Don’t be absurd,” is what he says, sounding posh.  “None of us knew what we were getting into.  Frank and I used to drink ourselves stupid, going over what we’d made you all sign up for.”  This is the first word that Harry’s heard about it.  He has no reason to believe it’s not true.  “You’re happy, you’re safe and you’re alive,” his dad goes on, shrugging, glancing at Tone and the breakfast, the house.  “What more could any of us have wanted?”
Nothing.
That night, Harry dreams of the Mirror of Erised.  Again.  Not for the first time.
“Sit down, Potter,” the voice of a Slytherin dad cuts into Harry’s spiralling thoughts.  It’s reality, again.  “And for Merlin’s sake, stop gawping.  You’ll be the one to give it away.”
Thick-coated and solid, sober in its expression, wild and predatory: the white wolf has escaped Harry’s wand to land on the flagstones with menace, and it makes Puff whip clumsily away to his perch.
Sometimes, when he’s two or three miles in, thinking of nothing, Harry sees a centaur from the corner of his eye.  It’s easier in early September, when he’s running in the light.  They always keep watch on him.  It’s because centaurs believe that there are better things to come one day, after death, which makes them suspicious of Harry and his choice.  They revere him, Harry fears, because they think that he’s given up on Valhalla to rid the mortal world of Voldemort, or something like that.  He’s not entirely sure that they’re wrong.
“I remember the hand,” says Draco shortly, his expression unreadable.
Harry glances at him.  Draco’s put his wand back up his sleeve, and he’s feeling up the trim on the door with an appreciative hand that Harry would rather prefer on his leg.  Anywhere.  Particular places.  “I dunno what you mean,” Harry says, turning back to the road, watching for signs.
The ash tree is behind Harry, still, its roots under his feet.  Wand in hand, Sirius is looking at him with his forehead knit in concern, and it’s difficult to tell his age in the darkness, though he looks broader and taller than when Harry first met him.  More like he did after regular meals, though he doesn’t smell of booze right now.
By the time that the ceremony was finished, Harry was both in a horrible mood and starting to feel a bit bored.  Fidgety.  He’d been to a few of these things now, and they were always the same.  By the time that the breakfast was done and the band was starting up, Harry was down several glasses of fairy wine, sitting with Neville and Luna and Liz, two tables from the top.  He should have recognised that he was on the edge of misbehaving, but Ron and Hermione were sitting with the rest of the bride’s family.
"Malfoy, don't do this…"
, all black hair and glasses and righteousness, bright eyes.  His
“That is what I said,” Draco confirms.  There’s too much blue in here, he thinks.  He shouldn’t have bought all the furniture at once.
Her boyfriend sticks to practicalities.  “We still on for the weekend?”
Somewhere or other in the Department, Hermione Granger works on time, because she has experience with its manipulation.  At the same time, she has the sort of body clock that brings her into work between 8:10 and 8:25 every morning and sends her home between 18:05 and 18:20 every evening, taking lunch about halfway through.  She became a girl by age eleven, a woman around eighteen.  It’s the spring of 2008.  Granger’s well past twenty-five now, and will likely not quite become a wife before the age of twenty-nine, but it’s all in hand.  Her boyfriend is known to be looking at rings.
says Dumbledore shortly, and Harry is certain that he knows what they’re talking about.
The man’s expression doesn’t change, and his question seems to be the same.  He gestures with his wand, quite dangerously.  Sparks emerge, but he doesn’t seem to recall the spell to produce letters.  Draco reads his lips.
He spends fifteen minutes idly contemplating what he and Neville might do with the duelling club, for the two final sessions before end-of-year exams.  And then he heads outside early, the rolled up scroll in his hand.
“Dad, what’s happening at Christmas?” James asks, the words weighted.
Around the time that this stopped feeling like some sort of play that he'd found himself lost in, Draco was finally paid the money that he’d been promised by the DMLE.  It felt like a very bad joke.  Vespers had been right, after all: in the wash of the goblins moving gold around grottos, these galleons were going to make no difference to his life whatsoever.
“That’s exactly what your mother would say,” his dad is telling him, narrowing his eyes with assessment.
“You do remember,” Draco says, because it’s as easy as thinking it, in the dark, and Harry Potter is an idiot.  “You didn’t expect this today, so it’s not at the front of your mind.”
The rooms are ostentatiously large, more empty than full, painted a snowy shade of white which was supposed to be stone (“I thought that it would be a nice neutral, but it’s rather pale, isn’t it?”).  The furniture belongs to this snowscape, its wood pale ash, and Draco says that he hates it, but Harry doesn’t at all.
Malfoy’s not here, Harry reminds himself.  Obviously he’s not.
There’s a hex being thrown at him, when Draco comes back to himself in 2008.  It’s not the Killing Curse, but he doesn’t know what it is.  “STUP-!” he shouts desperately, the spell barely breaking from his hawthorn wand.  It won’t work; he knows that.  It won’t –
.  He rests a hand on its fissured bark and looks to the branches, hanging low near his head.  There are bunches of winged keys, seed pods, not really green but glinting in the moonlight, ready to be caught.  This could have been Draco’s tree, Harry thinks, in another world, where he was never torn in two.
“You grew up with the
and a
“You sent me a text,” Harry remembers, wondering why magic’s always hurt him so much.  “Does that mean I’m special?”
She covers her mouth with her hand on saying
Draco must know that he’s missing, Harry thinks.  He’ll be thinking through the places that Harry could have gone.  He’ll put a stop to all this.  He’ll catch them
“He’s the only gay man you know,” Teddy says, brutal.
“He should
“He didn’t –”
“I’m taking you on a walk,” Harry reminds him, hands full of deep red knitting, always nervous to be held.
Harry has no idea what this letter’s about.
It feels like returning to reality after fantasy, and Harry has a feeling that this is what the past six weeks have been.  A fantasy he’s dreamt up in his head.  Or maybe that’s the past twenty years.
Potter grins at him, because he’s a shit – but Draco’s mother shoots him a look to quell trolls.  “You should know better than that, Draco,” she says shortly.  “One does not mock an important alliance.”
Harry found himself getting wound up, pressing the fingers of one hand into his eyes.  The other was holding a drink.
The six of them go for a walk after Puddifoot’s, because everyone’s slightly too hot and too caffeinated and dried out from sugar.  They should have asked for a jug of water, Harry thinks, but he kept waiting for someone else to make the suggestion.
“It was my fault,” Lily says, tutting, one hand on heart and the other bouncing off her husband’s shoulder.  “I lost a friend at the end of fifth year,” she explains to Harry and Draco, “and Moony was a dear listening to me harp on about it every time that we had Prefect’s.”
” he said shortly, refusing to read anything into the question besides Potter’s crude manners.  “You?”
The part of Malfoy well trained by Department seminars wondered why Potter had gendered the thing.  At the same time, the part of him which had grown up self-obsessed with dragons remembered that there was something about crests and tail shapes, all of which stood for most species.  It could be sexed, probably.
Teddy’s only clumsy on occasion, but when he is it tends to be catastrophic.
James is older than Harry was when he lost Sirius, now.  Remus died at thirty-eight.  Arthur’s still going, but he never left Misuse of Muggle Artefacts, which these days is practically defunct.
“Audrey, help!  I’m being –”
a dog – an old part of the contract, from at least the eighteenth century.  Harry thinks that it would have made his Uncle Moony laugh, if only ever darkly.
“Yeah;
“He’ll be all right,” dismisses Sirius, turning away.
“Dockers Dearborn?”  The name makes James laugh, scratching up the back of his hair, not catching Harry’s beetle.  He looks perplexed, his expression a caricature of the emotion.  “Where’s he come from?”
Harry’s heart sinks, and this is it, he imagines.  This is the moment that his mum, last of everyone, says that she loves him for reminding her of James Potter, no matter that they’re not at all the same.
– and Teddy stands up straight, putting down the knife.  It’s incongruous in Harry’s never fitted, slightly shabby kitchen, a massive wooden table at its heart.  The walls are teal blue.
“Ah,” accepts James, looking at him in the irritating way that he does, as though Harry’s very much a surprise.  “Yes,” he agrees, popping his glasses slightly higher up his nose.  He’s laughing a little, adjusted in an instant.  “He sounds like a good start.”
Chilling ice cold as these words sink in, Harry turns to see Draco Malfoy, white-blond hair thinning in much the same pattern as Ron’s – they could have a competition – slouched in his Slytherin scarf and a long, black muggle coat as though he’s cold, hands in his pockets.
” says Hermione in barely a breath, turning her head.
For the first after-match social of 2020, 2021, Harry no longer has a wife to pick him up.  It takes becoming last one left with Malfoy for Harry to remember it.
” Harry says behind him, rustling covers though he doesn’t get out of bed.  “You’ll bring it back here, won’t you?”
“This doesn’t make sense,” Harry finds himself saying, not sure where or who he is.  He walks out into the hallway of his own accord, past someone in the way.
“Shut up.”  Lupin’s smiling as though he doesn’t want to, half a laugh escaping him as he tips his head up to the ceiling for guidance.  He looks off-kilter, moved.  “I had to think that it was Padfoot, you jumping prat, for over a decade.”
Without a thought, Harry moves closer to get a better look, pulling his glasses off his face to clean them.
“Most things in this life are nothing but noise,” says Sirius after a moment, insistent.  James is watching him, so carefully, looking for answers.  “Other things, when you hear them, it’s –”  He frowns and sucks in breath, Sirius, looking at nothing, down the hill, breathing in and breathing out.  “The rest doesn’t matter.”  The last thing he says takes Harry entirely by surprise.  “I think that I would do this every year until the very end of things.”  His elbows are on his knees and he presses the heels of his palms to his forehead, breathing in, hitting himself before he looks up.
“Children plural?” Harry’s dad is quoting, oddly serious, as though the rest is unimportant.  Harry thinks that this could have been 1985, 86.  This could have been his life, sitting on the stairs, the Dursleys only ever a perfunctory visit at Christmas.  He finds that he’s biting his nails.
Draco looked at Harry as if to say that this was his fault, no question.  He, Draco Malfoy Esquire, would be taking
Eventually, of course, Harry made his way downstairs.
Ridiculously, James leans into the gossip, putting down his pint.  Harry cannot
Granger’s boyfriend sighs.  He puts down his quill and there’s ink on his fingers.  “When you saw us in school,” he starts again, from somewhere else.  “Who did you think was the centre of our group?”
“He’s too much of a prick,” Harry complains, moving to the rant so easily that Draco has no time to point out the obvious.  The words come out of him as if they’ve been waiting in his head longer than James Potter has been returned to the world.  “Trying to get us going with stories of what him and that lot got up to; chatting up Hermione, when, you know,
“No,” is Potter’s response.  “It’s not…”  He sighs, apparently overcome with the difficulty of describing what happens after death.  He’s staring at the table, into nowhere.  Draco can almost feel it; hear the whispers.  “You can’t
He sounds remarkably scathing and spiteful, but Harry’s taken up with Draco Malfoy, so it’s easy to let this wash over him.
me that she…”  He’s talking to the air, gesturing uselessly.  It’s difficult to argue with the dead, Harry thinks.  “If I’d been aware, I would have been very nice, but I would have explained that I saw him first and she could keep her hands
Oh right,” he continues in his own voice, younger somehow, emphatically plucky and sincere.  “How did that work?  I didn’t even know that Moony was…
“Or I could apparate,” agrees Teddy, not even joking.  “Like an elitist, mugglephobic twat.”
Pansy smiles sweetly.
He also grunted like a dog when he came in Draco’s hand, stomped on the ground and breathed as though he’d just pulled out of a hundred-foot dive.  His jizz was somewhere between a geyser and a spring as it shot out and slopped over Draco’s fist.  His fingers seized deep under Draco’s collar, curling to find hidden skin.
– but Teddy manages to catch it, the instant before his father figures it out.
, Harry,” Draco insists, rolling over and rubbing Harry’s arm, holding his head and kissing him between the eyes.  “Something else,” he declares, as though that’ll solve it.  “You’ll have heard Granger’s
He’s not sure he dares try to read these letters, if they exist.  He can figure out what Sirius means, at least, asking about fig rolls – there was an invitee who couldn’t come to the Order's reunion party, back in April.  He has a feeling that the question
Puff, the ridiculous enchanted dragon who breathes rainbow pompoms.  He and the canary would find themselves on good terms, Draco thinks.  “I had no idea that that ghastly thing was still alive.”
Sitting in the armchair in front of the bay window, Auntie Dromeda sips her tea, cup hovered over the saucer.  “Holidays are stressful,” she observes, and it leaves Harry confused.  “Draco drove?” she suggests, with a swallow.
Harry remembers this joke, Moony fancying Draco.  It’s something that Sirius came up with when he first returned from the veil, to try and make Moony jump.
do,” Draco mock-complains, hoping beyond hope that the boy’s use of
Eyes secure on his, entirely colourless, everything surely occluded, and Merlin knows how, Draco smirks.  He doesn’t move an inch.  “Precisely,” he says without intonation, and he isn’t calm at all.  “He made the choice to run, and then he ran.”
Something breaks, and layers of occlumency stitching snap like jaws, forcing Draco out of Black’s feelings, out of his senses and the smell of moss, out of his memory, out of his mind and back into himself, retribution hard and fast, pushing so that Black can follow.
Granger and her boyfriend are in the doorway, mute, and Draco wants them to get
He seems to be committed to this character assessment.
It was both beautiful and sad, somehow, Harry thought, the way that Draco transformed himself.  It got to him that morning, because he was watching, and he wasn’t sure he’d seen it in the moment before.
“It hardly matters –” Sirius is saying.
And she keeps looking at him, pausing, something glancing between her eyebrows.
“What’s so funny?” asks Sirius suspiciously, looking between them, a man again.
“Neither of wants –”  Ron’s gesturing vaguely, talking loudly, and Harry thinks that he means a threesome.  Harry likes to think that they’d ask him first.  He’d say no, he reminds himself, drinking another swallow of wine.  “And you don’t think that us consuming lesbo porn would count as a ho –”
“Yeah,” agrees Harry, feeling supported, though he’s not sure what this means.  “I’ve no interest in replacing Ginny,” he goes on, promising, thumbing his warm wedding ring by accident.  “You can tell the others that, if they ask.”
for your pining over Sirius, not when he may never yet come home.”
When he’s gone, Harry looks at Malfoy.
“You didn’t need to buy me a ticket,” Lupin goes on, looking around the busy room and up to the curves of the gilded, domed ceiling.
“It’s
Draco recalls some of what went on at Christmas with the Weasleys.  His impression at the time was that the whole affair had been very much par for the course, but apparently it’s put Harry off.
At Ollivander’s side, against the wall, not sitting on a chair, hidden in the depths of the corner, there’s Draco, looking small and like he wishes he was smaller, dressed in black, holding wine, pointy and sharp and silent, most likely.
“– but another time.  In the next couple of weeks,” she pulls the loops of the bow.
They both stare at the splinched boot, Black holding it up with an astonished look on his face while Draco stands as close to the platform as he dares to see that it’s true.
He puts down the photograph and strides forward, bold.  His right hand is extended firmly in front of him, set for Granger to shake over the débris of time on her desk.
” he tries again, but it doesn’t work.
“Stripped it and sold it,” Lupin says without looking, spiteful.  “What did you expect?”
“Well, you don’t know that she’s gay,” Malfoy says, eating one of Harry’s leftover chips.  This is a joke, though the fact of it might be true.  Half the world’s gay, Harry’s slowly finding out.  Malfoy found out in December that Hermione –
He wants that.  He wants Draco instead.
” Malfoy demands, quoting him the way that he likes to, the dickhead.  “
.  No sensible reason apart from to sabotage his own happiness, and Draco is quite irritated that he’s done it.  “He could still be here if you hadn’t…”
At the age of twenty-two and six months, Harry was married and trained as an auror, eighteen months away from holding a baby in his arms.  He was sorted.  He was living in his godfather’s house, the way that Teddy is – but his godfather was dead, the house was inherited, and he could have bought his own if he’d liked.
With a forced breath, Moony clearly tries not to react, but he doesn’t quite smile and he doesn’t quite frown, and Harry fears that he might have made him cry again.  His hair is golden in the sun, but his age shows as he swallows.
More than anything, it isn’t the man’s clothes or his appearance which makes Draco think that he is in no way at all Harry Potter.  It’s the man’s divided attention, when the Potter Draco knows has only ever been singularly focused.
…  It hurt to know that all the secrets he’d kept were for nothing, that he could have done it this way all along and it would
“D’you think that’s why he died?” Harry asks softly, looking to where Draco sits, cross-legged in the middle of the mattress.  It’s more comfortable here than the kitchen, though the windows face north and never get the sun.  “Did I make him feel trapped, d’you think?  If he could’ve only held on…”
As the Easter holidays come to an end, Harry appears in his flat one more time.
They never used to row.
(“Harry, what are you doing?”).
“Don’t you dare –”
, till now, but he’s been picking strawberries; he’s relaxed.  “Teddy,” she says smartly, “you’re so posh.”
He goes for a walk around the quiet suburban streets, passing by the skate park, where AJ and Max and their mates are all riding.  He passes through to the grassy field, where there are old rusting white football posts and bins telling dog-owners not to leave their litter, and he sits on a bench near the under-8s playground to watch the clouds in the sky.
With a risen pair of eyebrows and a twitch of his glasses, Harry’s dad grins and turns into a stag.  It’s familiar, because Harry’s been seeing it every other morning for weeks.
Pulling his hand free from the duvet, Harry closed the distance between them now and stroked fingers through Draco’s hair, gently, thumb resting at the edge of his eye.  Draco could feel it when he blinked, all of him unsettled.  “Gotta say,” Harry said, tapping the pad of that thumb, looking down and smiling with lines in his skin.  “I definitely wasn’t expecting that.  I was expecting, you know…”  He affected a snooty voice.  “
Draco is losing patience.  “Then you’ll be glad to hear that he very rarely thinks about himself at all.”
So Harry doesn’t kiss him, but he does put a hand on his thigh right there and grope.  It’s easier when he’s not wearing robes.
This should have been the end of it, but Lupin pushes on.  “An easy life raising the dead?”
Harry feels it as Draco steps closer, urgent and certain, reassuring.
But Andromeda’s looking at him calmly, and Harry can only think of her suggestion in not so many words that Harry isn’t family.  Which means that it isn’t his place to say anything.
Though presumably not, if the point is self-destruction.
It feels entirely awful to be left, Harry acknowledges, his hand left tingling and cold.  It feels fair, nonetheless, at this stage of his life.  It feels familiar and he knows what he’s getting into, he promises himself as he drifts back to sleep.
As a first reaction, Teddy frowns, his legs settled over the armchair’s low arm, his energy all static.  Harry’s breath seizes even as he wants to tell him to sit up.  But then –
Marriage is the centre of some people’s lives.  Draco doesn’t know when he forgot.
Maybe that was why Harry spoke again now.  “Sometimes I don’t know myself where I’ve been,” he came out with.  “That’s bad, isn’t it?”
– that we’d be friends for the rest of our lives.  The Marauders,” he mocks the name.  “We make it ten years, and then in less than twenty-four hours two of us are dead, so I think, and one of us is revealed to be a spy and a murderer.  And after all that there’s me, asking myself how and why for longer than we were ever friends.”
“Malfoy!” James Potter carols, his face alight with humour.  “There you are.”
, whatever it is that Harry thinks he can’t explain.  He doesn’t care, because he just wants his Harry to love him, and to tell him how to love him back in a way that doesn’t make things worse, the way that his love always has done.
“The baddies wanted him dead as a baby,” Gary relates, and Harry supposes that this is accurate.  “He thwarted that attack and every other since.  Saved the world at the age of seventeen.”
“As opposed to?”
himself for the Dursleys…
is all that Harry can think.
Ginny’s always been comfortable with her body; she keeps in perfect shape.  She likes to show herself off.  Harry always did find that attractive, even as he became increasingly frustrated with himself for not completing the picture.
Another turn of booze swings through his head because he hasn’t yet eaten today, and Harry shuts his eyes, tasting sugar, trying to imagine cool water and maybe a frog, hopping and whimsical (“Let’s live a little, Harry…”).
Harry looks up at her.  Her brown eyes are dancing, and she’s grinning, holding her husband’s hand.  Harry finds himself laughing, because he’s never read Ginny very well.
Part of Harry which can only be disturbed by hard violence accepts that this demonstrates, in the end, that Teddy’s mature for his age and that he likely could’ve coped with starting Hogwarts this year.  This was what Andromeda meant about Teddy getting distracted, because the Statute is only going to pinch harder, as everyone in his class starts talking about their next school.
Harry wants to tell him that Lupin never found it easy, as much as he remembers.  He’s not sure that he ever saw him and Tonks happy together.
are, in the building for once.
This – is not true.
“Yes!” declares Tone, pointing at him, and for some reason he takes charge.
It takes no time at all to cross the grass and snatch up the front of Draco’s robes like a snitch, to feel and hear him inhale with urgent force before their mouths meet, an instant earlier than Harry expects because Draco pushes up close into him, burying a hand in his wind-battered hair.  The kiss makes everything Harry’s feeling flare brighter, and it’s brilliant; he does it again, a third time, feeling that feeling of diving.
“There was no time,” Draco flares up, looking off into the living room before he possessively lands his elbows either side of Harry’s head.  “One of the fanatics would have nabbed you.”  He’s looking at Harry down his nose, intense, his mouth set in a frown.  “You would have found the shrine eventually, but by then you’d only be getting out after fifteen years of stalking or a suicide –”
He reached over beyond the edge of the parchment, picking up the volume on wandlore.  It was dog-eared and tatty with use, which Harry was embarrassed by, there in the cool morning.  It was covered in the wrapper for Madam Catchlove’s
“Moony,” the man demands, transfixed by the veil.  He’s carding fingers through the back of his hair, emotion in his jaw.  His voice is rough from shouting.  He might as well be talking to himself.  “Moony, don’t just stand there, you prat; we need to try again; we need…”
“I’m allowed one pack while I’m away,” she defends herself, as though Harry’s judging her.  He glances again, and she’s breathing out as though experiencing release.  She shakes the packet of cigarettes in question.  “Can’t poison the kiddies,” she seems to joke, leaning slightly towards him, and it’s true that the cardboard packet is threatening that this is a risk.
As it is, he eases them down to their sides, and somehow it’s his leg between Harry’s two, his heel pressing and rolling into Harry’s tender ankle and making him shiver.
“We were all rather poorly behaved.”
“I do miss Tonks,” Harry’s saying for now, leaning back again against the sink.  “She was fun.  I think that she was more like her dad than Auntie Dromeda, so I can’t work out if she’d have raised Teddy to be like her, or if he’d have eaten her alive.”
Draco can see what the image reflects, more clearly now than before.  Its head, wings and tail should be bright gold, he thinks, gleaming here under the moon, blinding when its jewel-like scales have a chance to reflect the sun.  The creature’s chest should be white, but softer than this, to cast the beast in the same colouring as a cougar.
Draco blinks, holding still.  This man is a complete fucker, he thinks.  “She plays chaser for Puddlemere United,” he answers.  “Why?”
fit makes me think that
“You play quidditch?” Draco asks, not sure why he’s surprised.  Of course Harry Potter’s mother plays quidditch.  It simply annoys him, because until now, even with the hair, she hasn’t been reminding him of Ginny Weasley at all.
With a twist in his heart, Harry remembers that this is another can of pixies.
Harry swallows again, not sure what to do.  He lets himself slump lower, making Draco huff and shift and accept him somehow, despite his sharp edges.
“And then I thought,” Andromeda pitches in, as if Harry hadn’t been the focus of her thoughts at all, “if we’re having Harry, why not Teddy’s Uncle Ron and Auntie Hermione?”
There’s a tongue against his own, and it’s charged with something eldritch.  Draco’s eyes are closed, his arms digging into bladed shoulders as his hands grapple with hair that’s
“Draco, when we talk,” Harry was saying, here and now, too quickly as he leaned on the bed, “it’s like I can be a different person.  When I come here, it’s like I step out of myself and I’m…”  He didn’t seem to know.  “And I don’t know if it’s something that I could be but I’m not when I’m with other people, or if it’s something that you make me, but it’s, it’s important.  You’re important to me, and I don’t think it’ll stop.”
Appearing in the warm yellow drawing room, there was wet blood dribbling from Harry’s nose, dampening his lip.  He sniffed.
No one says anything.
It was a man, it was a man just like him.  It was Harry Potter and Draco was familiar with his technique, the stops and starts and snickers, his fidgeting, nervous fingers, the muttering – “
It doesn’t work.  “Ron pointed out that you’ve always liked to watch them,” Draco relates, his voice low, and his gaze is impossible to look away from.
It was clear, nonetheless, that Luna disagreed.  “Don’t use my name like that, please.”  Her blue eyes were dreamy and wide, damning.  She was wearing her bridesmaid robes, oddly pretty, her hair glossy and full around her shoulders.  With professional make-up it made her look placid and uninteresting, most likely straight, and that pissed Harry off for some reason.  “This is an important day for all of us.  Ginny was my first love too, you know,” she said sagely, pushing a finger up her nose.
“Morning,” James says once he’s stretched, bouncing on his toes.  He’s taking in the mess of the table, presumably searching for a cup of cold tea.
Funnily enough, Draco does.
“It was an uphill struggle,” Lupin reflects, as though Draco should care.  “He was fighting his own slippery sense of what decade we were in, and I had already failed to pass muster in 1981, so I was no help at all.  He had a dream for the end of the war…”  He shakes his head.
a garden gnome,” she spits proudly.  “Professor Longbottom,” she corrects herself.  “And this family will never be broken, Albus Potter,” she recovers her thread.
Neville went at the start, before Dennis Creevey and the other siblings shared their few words (“This memorial will be for the young,” McGonagall said, in a planning meeting months ago.  “Hogwarts is a school.”).  Ginny’s spoken for Fred, and Harry knows he should have realised that this is the reason she’s here, instead of on tour or skipping the day to be with George.  Percy and Audrey and Molly and Arthur are somewhere in the crowd, to listen.
Taking a deep breath, which he releases, Harry’s ears tune into the sound of the indicator.  He watches the cars, he judges his distances, he’s cautious, and he turns easily into a gap, pressing the accelerator gently to catch up with the traffic.  It’s the simplest thing he’s ever done.  His heart is thudding violently.
“He’s only a baby,” James Potter points out, with resentful duress.  His expression is closed.
They all rose to their feet.
Sara Chaudhury of Salisbury said yes to everything, because she wasn’t a ghost, by the strongest definition.  She wasn’t here to haunt them; she was just here.  That afternoon, she pushed her child’s buggy into the sacred circle, concealed by the traffic island’s flowerbed, and only smiled as Harry Potter threw down the ashes and bid her farewell.
“You really are different at work,” Draco’s continuing – this is an amused observation.
Teddy Lupin is spellbound.  “What kind of poem?” he asks.  “Can you read it?”
He enjoys buying it anyway.
“You’ll want to hear –”
He broke off at this point to roll his eyes.  Draco wasn’t sure whether or not he was supposed to laugh.
When they first arrive, however, she’s distracted.  Her wand is in her hand and she’s watching something flitter through the trees.
“So, I am not sure of the best place to wait,” Draco finishes, looking towards the door that leads out of the chamber.  “I have a flat, but I would never suggest…”
Draco’s agreed to help with Granger’s engagement ring.  “Yes, yes,” he dismisses, disapparating.
“But why?” Harry asks him, fiddling with the collar of his t-shirt.  He doesn’t understand.  He ends up saying it.  “I don’t know what you expect,” he admits, meeting the dark of Draco’s eyes.  “If you were at my mercy, there’d be no kinky sex.”
speech,” Elphias Doge is saying to Harry’s face, shaking his hand, Harry’s one in his two.  “You brought a tear to my eye, dear boy.  Albus would have been so proud.”
, fuck him, the fucking nobody, who is he?
It’s as though Harry’s passed a test.  He cannot believe he’s passed a test.  He –
“He has business abroad,” Harry makes up, and it’s easy, when he does it.
I’m not allowed to go through any of it until the whole lot’s been vetted, but I should admire this absolute relic of a television set, which Sirius made run and get pretty good reception.
“All right,” James agrees, narrowing his eyes as though confused by Harry’s tone.  “I mean, your mother and I never had much to do with her, but she was around from time to time.  She had a sister in the Ministry who couldn’t be seen conspiring with Moody,” he recounts.  “And her husband was very well respected in the Office.  One of the first assassinations.”  He says this easily, but it’s nothing that Harry’s ever known.
“Oh, look, that’s Mildred!” James remarks suddenly, surprised, looking at the cat, caring a great deal.
It was an old dream – old-fashioned, even, tinted sepia.  They’d take a house in Cannes, him and Pansy, or somewhere less déclassé.  Pansy Malfoy would wear exquisite cat-eyed sunnies, of the sort that she loved, and she’d smoke cigarettes from a holder as long as her wand.  She’d ensnare new prey every month and pass over the scraps when she grew bored, and they’d host thousands, him in blue and black and her in pink and white.
“And I too,” Kingsley replies.  Somehow it’s clear that the joke is on James.  “Indeed, I heard such an awful many good things, once upon a time.”
The rug flashes down over Harry’s father, wrapping and pressing, marking out the shape of a man, who seems to have been thrown down too.  A flood of water sweeps over the rug in a rippling, heavy wave.  It crests into foam, crashes transfigured into earth, and a man is buried under the clod.
As he came into focus, Matías’s eyebrows were raised.  As Harry stumbled over his feet, he looked past Harry’s head and clapped him hard on the shoulder, leaving his warm hand there, steady enough to orbit around.  “Ron, my new bro,” he shouted, sounding ineffably cool.  “You’ve lost something.”
Harry glances down, and the black leather’s thickly streaked with mud.  The trousers too.
Harry asked why this hadn’t come up four years ago; Ron gave him a sarcastic look.
Black had accepted the idea with a shrug, but seeing it written so baldly now makes Draco cringe.
“A twat,” came the distracted reply, not seriously.  It raised a laugh from the group.
He comes back with red cheeks and bright eyes before it’s all over, an angry set to his jaw and a scowl as though he’s been shouting, but Harry doesn’t think about this.
There’s a cage of iron in Draco’s hand, much like the cage that he conjured for his new pet canary.  It has no base, however, and it’s perfectly spherical by design, hanging from a pole that he’s affixed to the wall of the veil chamber.  The pole stretches out into the whispers, ending as close the veil arch as he can manage.  From here the suspended sphere hangs over the step up to the wooden platform, mere feet from the edge between life and death.
“Bisexuals can call themselves gay; how does he self-define –?”
He thinks that he might hear his dad.
He keeps his own secrets, and no one knows all of them.  It’s Harry alone who knows where all three of the Deathly Hallows lie: Draco can only suspect about the elder wand; McGonagall can only suspect about the invisibility cloak.  Ron and Hermione can only suspect about the resurrection stone.
” Harry comes out with, and he’s never revealed this before.  It doesn’t sound good; he has to keep going.  “Proper aggressively,” he insists.  “In a tent,” he describes.  “I had no idea what was happening; I thought he’d had a break.”
Seeing him, Draco wiped his eyes, and resolved –
Luna shook her head, shuffling over to encourage Draco’s head down to her shoulder.  “He doesn’t realise that his cousin feels that way,” she said.  “It’s very complicated.”
Harry sounds exasperated.  He disentangles one hand to push his glasses up his nose, all of him silvery in the night time.  His chest is rising and falling visibly.  “Can you not get out of your head for five whole minutes?” he asks a little shortly.
she said, and Draco cut.
Lupin rolls his eyes.  “I stopped hiding,” he says.  “Or I tried to,” he concedes.  “Harry had to give me an earful.”
Draco laughs incredulously, a glorious titter high in his nose.  He doesn’t interrupt.
“I’m afraid that I shall have to withdraw from our arrangement,” Draco decides, adjusting his wand in his sleeve.  There are appearances – there are
,” she says, and Harry imagines her stealing the quill back.  “It’s
He looked over his shoulder, and he realised that the Weasley witch cousin was his mum.
And Pansy makes another face, looking around the sports field for an audience.  “Take my arm,” she suggests, standing up, pulling a wand from somewhere inside her coat.  She looks him up and down sceptically.  “Try to act expensive for the lobby.”
Harry doesn’t want salmon.  “Have you eaten today?” he asks instead, still annoyed, because he knows that the answer will be
“We’re going out,” Harry insists, looking up from himself, imagining the scars behind the stretched cotton of Ron’s shirt.  He’s sure that this is how people pick each other up.
Taking in the tall height and strength of the unicorn, which is nonetheless clearly not here to fight, Harry supposes that he hasn’t needed protection in a long time.  But he’s always needed something to believe in, for when the battles came anyway.  Once upon a time he believed in his dad.  Then he believed that he could live with doing whatever he had to.  Now he believes in something beautiful, and he thinks that it might be magic itself, maybe life, maybe virtue, maybe innocence.
“Harry!” someone accosts, making Harry turn around.  Emerging from the crowd is a wizard in his fifties whose name Harry will remember in a minute; he only remembers that he’s a twat who’s somehow ended up at Harry’s rank in Improper Use.  White.  “Mr Malfoy,” he adds genially to Harry’s date, with not nearly the respect he deserves.  “We were just talking about the inquiry,” into race and the Ministry, is what he means; Harry’s not sure who’s
.  Harry tries not to feel anything, surprised by how vividly he expects Draco’s office to be covered in blood, irritated because breaking into the Ministry’s nothing to get excited about.
Harry finds himself thinking for the second half of October, he fears quite homophobically.  Certainly panicked; he doesn’t think about sex with Ron or Hermione at all, even as everyone’s told to stop eating out and stay in to help out instead.
The first week of term is the first week of term.  It’s speeches, mostly, more than lessons.  Excuses from students about their summer homework.
For some reason, this makes Harry laugh.
Harry doesn’t bother asking what the flaw is.  He’ll have to find it himself, or else he’ll never be able to fix it.  It’s annoying.  His bloody father.  Bloody Malfoy.  Bloody Lupin.  Bloody – everything.
It makes Hermione laugh, Harry’s expression.  She pokes Ron in the arm.  “Rose’s year are all on Hogsmeade negotiations,” she explains, taking pity.
The man is watching him, his expression canny, full of confusion, and Harry can read it as easily as breathing.
Harry neither looks at him nor drops his wand.  “At least it’s clear that the wards work.”
Harry flinches, and it all goes haywire from here.
This is the wrong thing to say.  If they could have waited five more minutes, for Merlin’s sake…
you –”
“That’s not what happened,” Harry says before he’s thought it through.
“Come and sit with me and your dad,” she insists, pressing one hand to his cheek, too soft.  Her other is tight on his shoulder.  She hovers over the figure in white – so very gently – until there’s room for them both, climbing up and sitting with her back to the headboard, knees hunched to make her look like an owl.

“But you are,” Harry says feebly, pointing.
“Harry, that is unfair and untrue,” says Granger, bringing silence.
The portkey returns them to Grimmo’s drawing room, where they’re met by too many people and a heavy, dread-filled atmosphere.
clever,” he spits, unexpectedly candid, the words a deep burn of affection.  “He knew that I’d always try to let him keep it, if I ever fucking –”
he writes to Ginny, changing his mind.  He wonders if she’ll know one way or the other, by the end of the Ravenclaw match.  He wonders if he’s making a mistake.  He’s mostly just acting, in this moment, because he doesn’t want to send the note where he tells Draco they’re cancelled.
.  And –”
“Yeah,” agreed Harry, not sure what they were talking about, but he took Draco down to the cellar.
Harry swallows.  “Well, I’ve always appraised people.  I didn’t think it was strange,” he returns to his thread, looking away.  He shouldn’t have called it strange, he realises.  “Then we went into lockdown, and I realised that the people I missed most around the Ministry – the clerks and the archivists and people in the lift – they were all fit young men.  I’m a perv, it turns out,” he admits, still panicking about it now.  The counsellor said that he shouldn’t call himself a perv without defining what he meant.  “I like my place of work to be full of nice young things for me to look at.”
The next morning, Draco blinks his eyes open and stares up at the ceiling.  He can feel the sheets of the bed around him and it’s dark, mostly, because the curtains are heavy and the windows face north.
It’s for this reason – and for this reason alone, he tells himself – that Harry enters the dark dining room, approaches the window and takes in the sight of his godfather and Lupin finishing their breakfast outside, both facing the garden with their feet up on chairs, tubular and red.
“Fuck, Malfoy’s right,” Ron observes, amused with his wine as Harry flicks through the book.  The ribbon marks
” he says clearly.  “
“Will he be going to the atrium?”
Less than an hour later, around midday, Draco appears at the door of number 12, Grimmauld Place, not wearing a coat so his nose and his cheeks have gone pink.  His jumper’s a deep, dark green.  Harry arrives in the hallway, alerted by Kreacher before the door lets Draco in.
“I don’t understand what they’re doing,” Harry tries to explain.  “I don’t understand…  How am I supposed to keep them –?”
“You’ll have to make up your own mind on Malfoy,” Ron explains when they’ve calmed down, even as Harry finds himself rolling his eyes.  “He can be difficult, yeah?  But us three all like him.  Have done for years now.”
, but today he can’t quite manage it.  The command is loud in his head as he flicks a finger, walking by.
"You must have been so..."
“Ooh,” says Tone, ironic.  “Gorgeous
me –”
Draco doesn’t relax, frowning at this question.  His breath is hitching, and his knee kicks like a rabbit.
At this point, Harry looks at Luna.  It seems obvious that she has an opinion.  Her eyes are wide and blue, looking back at him.
Teddy’s eyes glint in preparation for the argument.  Ginny’s always said that they’re exactly alike.
They make good time, and it’s dark and warm when they land on the beach, hours later.  Harry’s been navigating with his compass and his map and his fingerless gloves, and with any luck they’ll have found the right island.
The smoke is warm and bitter in Draco’s mouth, not unpleasant, though he has a feeling that he rather prefers breathing.  He thinks that he can feel the drug of it going somewhere, but he’s not certain that it’s
“Reel him in with a treat,” Pansy continues, “a few presents, dangle his friends in front of his eyes and then
“Oh, it’s a
He sounds like a ten-year-old child, Harry thinks.
“He used people,” Malfoy says plainly, staring Harry down, his voice deep and cold.
“Yeah,” Harry says, because he knows this.  It’s not Lupin’s belief; it’s true.  The connection has always made sense: Harry knows what it’s like to go without fruit, to taste an orange wedge at school because the dinner lady’s caught on that his packed lunch wasn’t packed, so she’s snuck him at the end of the queue for sausage pie and carrots and chips and syrup sponge, the fruit pot an extra because it’s 12:35 and there are spares.
On Friday night the next week, Harry decides to go out.  He’s eating a marmalade sandwich with a shop-bought beer after work because he’s already eaten half a meal at the Ministry, and he thinks to himself that this is not how one finds a man for whispering in corners and doing things with cocks.  He keeps thinking about Malfoy and Malfoy’s coming round tomorrow; Harry doesn’t want it to be weird.  Teddy’s going out for Friday night, he’s been informed; he’s been upstairs since Harry came home, getting ready.  The country’s out of lockdown, but there are reports that London might be moved into Tier 3.
be, the way that he once would have been.  A muggle in an expensive jewellers is looking at him differently from the way that he did when they first walked through the door, but Draco doesn’t care.  Who’s this bloke to him?  Tosser.
Harry doesn’t know whether it’s a courtesy that she finished packing while he was away, or an inconvenience that she’s left so many boxes behind.  They don’t belong to each other anymore, so he doesn’t know why her stuff is still here, belonging to him.
His mum and dad even appear then.  They’ve been busy for most of the night,  shaking hands and getting to know each single person who’s come through the door, telling stories.  It’s looked exhausting, to Harry, but they both look like they could go for another hundred years, chatting with each other as though they think that each other’s the best.  His mum’s bubbling with laughter and hitting Harry’s dad on the chest.  He’s grinning like the sun, arm loose around her shoulders.
