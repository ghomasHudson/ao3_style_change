And in some ways, it doesn’t seem right. Potter’s an arse, and it’s clear to him that their “school rivalry” was worse than just some petty fights. Draco was horrible to him. It explains Potter’s immediate reaction to seeing Draco in St. Mungo’s, at least.
Draco stares at Potter, eyes wide, until the memory fades into nothingness. He recalls Potter’s words about them being stuck together, and it sends him reeling.
Harry’s heart stopped. Then it started again at a racing speed against his sternum. Harry sat up, stretching out one leg to give Draco space, and pulled Draco down to meet him.
“So you are on this case, then,” he heard from behind him. He turned around. There was Ron and Hermione, both looking worn out, their eyes puffy from tears. Ron was wearing the same black dress robes he had worn at Fred’s funeral. Hermione had a navy blue skirt suit on – since she worked in the legal department, she had more of a selection than Ron. Ron was leaning forward towards Harry, bracing his elbows on his knees, his hands dangling, limp and lifeless. “So, you’ve been protecting the ferret this whole time?”
Again, Wilkins shook his head, but there was a thought growing in his wide eyes. “You don’t think, sir-? No, young master could never, he loved master and mistress!”
“Even though he hadn’t spoken to them in years? Only to, out of the blue, show up, wanting to reconcile?” Harry pointed out, hating himself for recognising the logic behind the conclusion. But Wilkins was shaking his head so adamantly that his ears flapped against his cheeks.
Harry, who had been setting his glasses on the bedside table, froze. Malfoy’s words hung in the air, waiting for a response. He took a deep breath, then another.
This time, it was Draco who rose and made his way over to Harry. He pulled the other man to his feet and angled his face just so, Harry’s arms around his waist as he buried his hands in Harry’s hair, their lips meeting and sending a spark through both of them. This time, instead of pulling apart at the shock, they let it carry them through, the kiss deepening, slow and tender even as they held each other closer. When Harry’s lips moved to Draco’s jaw, to his neck, they were both trembling as wave after wave crashed into them, their emotions, their wants and needs and desires unleashed. Draco felt everything Harry did, the thrill and the heartbreak, the relief and the joy, the loss and the discovery, all at once. And he knew, he knew Harry felt everything he did, because Harry murmured in his ear, “I’m here now.” They kissed the tears that fell down each other’s cheeks, whispered promises as hands explored skin, found each other’s lips again and again as night began to drape its pale curtain around them.
He led them down the path, eventually coming to the baffle gate and the path winding through the old trees to the small clearing in the woods. Now, in winter, the grass wasn’t as green, and the trees were barren. There was no yarrow and borage in the shadows. Embarrassment crept up the back of Draco’s neck as he noticed now the ivy pulling off the old stone walls, the dingy windows, the moss heavy on the roof tiles. But when he looked over at Harry, he saw the same expression of wonder that he’d had all those years ago, sweeping away the embarrassment.
Malfoy, of course, was already there. Leaning against the parapet, his back to the door, he didn’t move when he heard the door to the stairs close behind Harry, nor when Harry took off the Cloak and cleared his throat to let him know he was there. He stayed like that, arms folded on the waist-high wall, his white-blond hair glowing pale in the moonlight. Harry shifted his weight awkwardly. Finally, Malfoy spoke.
“Well, there are only two types of people who work for HU,” said Harry. He held up one finger. “People who think they’re God’s gift to the world and two,” he held up a second finger, “people who really are God’s gift to the world and are too selfless for their own good.”
“You sure?” Harry asked. Draco nodded. Harry beamed up at him and proceeded to half-drag Draco up the stairs to the master bedroom.
Hermione wrung her hands. “I don’t know who else it could be,” she said, “but they didn’t mention them by name, so it really could be – ”
“Who punched you, anyway?” Draco asked. One of his hands fluttered up, as if to try and touch, to check the broken nose. There was a slight crease between his brows, a frown tugging at his mouth. Harry shrugged.
. You haven’t been with him these past couple months. He really has changed, for the better. He’s a good man, Ron. And I really, really like him.”
“The biscuits, Draco.” Still, Harry didn’t turn around, didn’t lower onto the soles of his feet, just stayed stretched out like that as Draco stood there and stared. Draco swallowed and licked his dry lips.
He sighed and continued, “But we were young and foolish, and in our reckless rage we tried to hunt down the man who led Voldemort to you and your parents. He was our friend, once. When he escaped – framing us for his murder in the same fell moment – he said that he had had no choice. But Harry,” he looked down at his godson then as Harry sat curled against Remus’s chest, “you always have a choice.”
Draco threw his arms in the air with a strangled sigh. “If I knew, I’d tell you!” he exclaimed. “As it is, it’s been a week and all I know is that I always know where he is, that when he hurts I hurt, and that there’s a lot of bloody paperwork involved! We had to file as a ‘magically bonded relationship’ with Robards, and if I have one more person ask if I’m having ‘intimate relations’ with Harry, I will scream.”
September passed without much incident. The other eighth years were perfectly happy to accept Draco into their fold, although Hermione and Neville had their reservations. They weren’t openly hostile, but Draco felt their glares following him, especially if he got too close to Harry. So he kept his nose down and tried to focus on his school work. That was what he was here for, after all.
“Well, he apparently doesn’t hate me,” Harry pointed out. He looked up at Draco over the rim of his glasses, his green eyes sparkling with laughter. “Although I have to admit, I’m more of a dog person, usually.”
Draco tried his best to make the lie sound true – “Yes.” But the word still fell flat in the charged air between them. Harry looked away, biting his lower lip.
“Yes, sir,” said Kellen. She pointed with her self-inking quill at the plate, which still had a bit of jam-covered toast on it. “We suspect he Apparated away. We searched the house – he isn’t here, and the wards only let Malfoys Apparate or Floo in and out. Wilkins had to get us in before we could lift the wards on the drawing room Floo.”
Draco frowned. “You live with this boy?” he asked. When Harry nodded, he let out a series of incredibly imaginative curses under his breath, most of which Harry didn’t understand because they seemed to be in French. “And your aunt and uncle don’t say or do anything?”
Harry stiffened. Draco sighed and pushed himself away, out of Harry’s arms, to lean back in his chair with an exhausted sigh. Harry’s hands fell to his sides, his expression unusually stoic.
The kettle began to whistle. Harry jumped up and took it off the stove, busying his hands with pouring the water into the teapot while his mind raced. He set it and the mugs on his desk, moving aside books and papers as he did so. He could feel McGonagall’s gaze heavy on him, watching his expression – he had never really learned to hide his expression, his mind an open book across his face.
He woke a little while later to Harry’s arms around him, still nestled in the circle of Harry’s arms, rising and falling with each deep breath. He nuzzled against Harry’s collarbone. Harry chuckled, the sound rumbling against his ribs. He ran his fingers through Draco’s hair, and Draco hummed, content.
Kellen paled, her eyes widening. “You’re not actually going to kill each other, are you?” she asked timidly.
Harry banged his hands on the table, pushing away from it and sending his chair screeching back. “Can’t you just let me live?” he shouted. Hermione jumped again, and Ron put a hand on her shoulder, glaring at Harry. Harry got to his feet and began pacing, scrubbing his hands through his hair. “I… I finally found something good in my life, and you say I’m out of my mind!”
“Of course it matters, I can’t stop thinking about it!” Potter also drew near him and Draco tried his best not to look like he was about to pass out.
“Yeah they can’t just-” Oh shit. This was his father’s doing. Of course it was. Who else would sentence a magical beast to death for a simple misunderstanding.
The dark lord came to my house again to remind me of my task. As if I could forget. I don’t know how you’re able to say his name. I can hardly talk in his presence. I’m actually rather surprised he didn’t kill me after how much I stuttered. It was just him and I this time, and that made the whole thing much more terrifying. Aunt Bellatrix practically leaped into the room after he had left and gave me a hug. Which was extremely disturbing. She’s over the moon that I’ve gotten the “opportunity” to do this task. It’s as if she’s pretending she doesn’t know the whole thing is a punishment for my father’s failure. She kept giving me tips on how to slyly murder people and Potter, she had this excited look in her eye that made me realize just how many people she has killed. I’m living in a house with two murders. I’m guessing it would’ve been three if my father was still around. Well at least I can go to Hogwarts now. I have never been more thrilled in my entire existence to get away from this place. I cannot wait to be out of his presence and free to actually talk to my friends again. I know I could still talk to you, but you don’t count. We’re not friends. We’re worst enemies (who kind of sort of are in love with each other maybe?). Oh, my mother’s calling. She sounds sad. I am leaving her alone with the dark lord and her...sister. I better go.
“What did it mean?” He wished desperately that he could see his face so that he could pull him into another kiss to show him exactly what it had meant to him.
“Nothing. Nothing, just-” And for a second Draco thought Potter was going to take a swing at his face but instead he pulled him closer and kissed him.  Harry. Potter. Kissed. Draco. Malfoy. And Draco’s heart absolutely melted. A small part of Draco’s brain was screaming that this was a terrible idea, but the rest of him was too busy kissing Potter back to care. His mouth was warm and his lips were so soft and perfect. This was perfect. Draco’s brain had gone fuzzy with joy. It seemed perfectly natural for their mouths to open and for them to sweep their tongues inside each other's mouths. Draco felt like he might fall over, his knees were shaking and the rest of him was practically vibrating with excitement. As their tongues touched Draco couldn’t stop the little sound he made at the back of his throat.
“I have something for you.” He brought his eyes back down to look at him, carefully he took a thick envelope out of his robes and handed it to Draco. He took it, raising his eyebrows and bringing his fingers to the seal to open it. However Severus shook his head sharply.
“I’m here. Just thought I saw something.” The two of them appeared and Potter slipped out from the alcove to join them.
“It’s fine I suppose.” Her face quickly broke into a wide smile. “At least you both have stopped acting so stupid.”
Draco followed her out of the cafe, giving a small wave to the waitress who had gone to clean their table.
“I had it under control.” Draco snapped, crossing his arms. Why was it that Severus always deemed to show up at the most dramatic of moments?
“Shite, are you hurt? Hang on.” Her footsteps retreated hastily. She was going to leave him out here, she didn’t want him coming back inside because he was a miserable excuse for a human. Honestly he didn’t really deserve to be let back in.
“Busy.” His tone was flat and he spoke almost in a whisper. Merlin, why was Severus always so dramatic?
“Is something wrong?” Severus asked, he looked sort of pained Draco noticed. He had never been very good with the feelings.
It feels strange writing to you now knowing that you’ve finally read all of my other letters. I think I might actually give this one to you, as there’s really nothing for me to lose anymore. I was angry, extremely angry, with you at first. A part of me still is. Though after quite a bit of contemplation I have come to terms to why you read all of my letters. I’m sorry I botched the obliviate. I don’t think I was trying very hard to do it correctly and now you’re paying for my mistakes. I hope you can forgive me for that. I don’t know how to be around you anymore. It scares me, you know everything about me, and I still don’t know that much about you. I was speaking to Ginny a few nights ago, and she told me that you hardly ever talk about yourself. And when you do you always seem to be uncertain. I have no idea what your family is like, you told me you wanted to be an auror after Hogwarts a while ago, but I’m fairly certain that you were lying. If it is alright with you, I would like to get to know you. We haven’t spoken more than a few words together since that particular incident, and I was wondering if it would be easier for the both of us if we write to each other instead? Sure it may seem incredibly sappy and a bit stupid as we sleep a couple feet away from each other, yet something tells me that this is a good idea. Normally I’m full of terrible, reckless ideas, but I don’t feel a looming sense of dread so I must be right. I won’t be offended if you don’t want to. I merely wanted to try, because I miss you.
Draco nearly spit his coffee all over him. A date? Merlin of course this could be a date. Draco was only sorry he hadn’t been the one to ask Harry on a date.
I do hope I do not have to deal with your insufferable presence when I go shopping in Diagon Alley with my mother and father. I remember last year I saw you, although I didn’t know who you were at the time, and what an annoying being you be on my life. I really thought we were going to be friends. Obviously that didn’t work out. But I am merely writing to tell you that I will be in Diagon Alley tomorrow, and you better not be there. I don’t want to get in a fight with you before school even starts. It makes a bad impression. Although you wouldn’t know anything about that. You certainly don’t seem to care what sort of impressions you make on anyone. Honestly you should’ve been expelled by now. That’s besides the point. I better not see you until September 1st. Who knows. Maybe I’ll get lucky and you won’t come back to school at all. Actually you need to come back to school. You’re my one true enemy.
“Don’t splinch us please.” Draco glared at him and was about to flourish his wand, yet he felt a prickling at the back of his neck. That was when he should’ve left. He should’ve gotten them out of there as quickly as possible. Yet his stomach squeezed and he lowered his wand, searching.
I should feel triumphant. I bested the golden trio after all. Except I don’t. There is a weight on my chest that I don’t know how to explain. Though I’m sure father would be bloody thrilled. I insulted Granger in front of the Quidditch team and made a fool of the blood traitor. I should probably stop writing these letters. They seem to be messing with my head.
“Ron! Ron, stop it, we’re going to get in trouble!” The laughter subsided and Draco snapped his wand out and was prepared to jinx Weasley with the same curse when Professor Moody came running, his wand raised as well.
“Er-I can I guess.” Draco hadn’t really been looking forward to this part, best to get it over with now.
“Flying I guess.” Harry closed his eyes again and took another breath. Draco tried to breathe normally as well.
“I-” Draco started. Then warm hands pulled him closer and Draco couldn’t think of anything else to say. He was shaking again. And he knew Potter was too. He reached a hand to run his fingers through Potter’s hair, however he immediately yanked it back when he heard voices. Granger and Weasley. Of course.
Draco put a hand to his mouth as he flung the letter into the sink. What if Harry was dead. What if he was dead and never coming back. What if Draco never saw him again, what if-. Draco screamed in frustration and tore the letter in half. He stared at the ripped letter for a second before picking up the pieces. He blinked hastily. He was not crying over Potter. He didn’t care. He didn’t care if Potter lived or died. This was childish. He was being ridiculous. Potter was his enemy. He should want Potter to be dead. But he didn’t. He wanted his friend back.
“NO!” A shrill voice shot through the collected voices. “HE’S RIGHT THERE!” Screams began as people surged towards where Harry and Ginny had begun sprinting towards the fire places.
“Oh come on, you’re going to be alright.” Pansy said, rolling her eyes. Most of her worry was gone now that she saw Draco acting as his usual self.
“Draco.” she began, her voice quavered and she glanced over her shoulder. She shut the door silently and sat on his bed, drawing in a breath. Draco studied her face for any sign of what was going on.
“You didn’t!” Ginny squawked, rising to her feet. “You went to the address didn’t you? Are you insane? You could’ve been fucking kidnapped!”
“I know.” He did his best to smile convincingly. Apparently it was enough to convince his father who left with that same excited gleam in his eyes. After several minutes of lying face up on his bed and doing his best not to cry, he got up and decided to write a letter to Luna. She was the only one who knew about his feelings for Harry. He couldn’t bring himself to tell his friends just yet. Although he had a feeling some of them probably suspected by now. He had a tendency to act a bit mad around Potter after all.
“Shoo, damn. Don’t look at me like that.” Draco glanced over his shoulder, ready to make a run for it, but he was caught by the back of his beck and he let out a small gasp.
“Find a way to escape. Find the order, they’ll help you. Tell them the whole story. Hermione will probably have already told some of it I gather.” He snorted softly. Draco wanted to die.
Neither of them said anything. Draco was fairly sure Severus thought he was incredibly stupid for letting his heart get the best of him.
“Alright. Yes, that’s enough I believe you. Here.” He unlocked the door with a wave of his wand and he faced Hermione Granger. It hadn’t been long since he had last seen her, yet she looked incredibly different. Her eyes had dark circles under them, almost like they were bruised, and her face had that hollow, sunken look of someone who had not been eating. Draco blinked.
“Fuck you.” He said, surprised at the amount of venom in his voice. Harry flinched and dropped the box. It fell to the floor with a soft clack.
“We aren’t ridiculous.” Draco snapped, rubbing at his temples. Great. Now he was getting a stress headache. Maybe this whole thing was ridiculous.
She waved her hand in the air. “Yes, Draco. His aura. It gets stronger when someone is experiencing strong emotions.”
She shrugged, “That’s exactly what I mean, the way he looks at you, and talks about you when you’re not around...it’s kind of obvious.” She glanced around the common room to make sure he wasn’t in earshot, even though it was a little late for that. “And he’s nice, and sweet, and you should really give him a chance.”
Draco placed the letter with the others and hurriedly slid it under his bed. He glared at Severus’s owl as it continued to fix him with it’s intense stare.
That’s what the message said. Shite. The only thing Granger had to say about this whole situation was shite. Which was true, clearly, but bloody unhelpful. He ignored the stitch in his side as he flung himself down the stairs. Honestly he was surprised Filch hadn’t come running by now. His heart nearly stopped when he saw a hand stick itself out of a classroom and wave furiously.
“We… Draco and I… we were, er, snogging, and er….” His cheeks burned. God, why had he brought Hermione into this? He should just bury it all deep down, keep a stiff upper lip about it, and…die alone. But then he thought of Draco, and his heart broke a little more. “I think there’s something wrong with me,” he said finally. “I want to kiss him, I guess, I want
“Except this time, I actually want to be with my partner,” Harry said. Draco turned to him, his expression caught between teasing and loving.
Harry turned, his expression so fond and earnest it made Draco’s heart break. “I forgave you a long time ago,” he said quietly. “We were kids, Draco, trying to be what the world expected us to be. Now we get to be who we want to be. Nothing else matters.”
“But, sir, he doesn’t have anything to do with Ivanovich,” Harry protested. He took a step to the side, shielding Malfoy from Dawkins’ view. Dawkins’ eyes narrowed. “He told me so himself,” Harry insisted, “he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. He had no idea who Ivanovich was.”
“Wait. You saw? I knew it was you! I knew I heard something that night!” Draco’s grin at the realisation crumpled almost immediately, uncertain. “Are you just saying that because you saw my Patronus? Because you don’t want to hurt my feelings or – ”
Harry sat down as they waited for the water to boil. McGonagall pursed her lips as she folded her hands in her lap. Harry narrowed his eyes. That was her bad news look, he would know it anywhere and it never ended well.
Draco frowned. “Those words can never leave this room,” he said. “I can’t have my good Slytherin reputation besmirched by such slander.”
Meeting Draco’s friends had gone slightly better than Harry thought it would. Pansy Parkinson had burst into laughter at first, but when she explained it was because Draco had had a crush on Harry during their school years and wouldn’t shut up about ‘Saint Potter’, Harry immediately liked her. Draco had then forbidden Pansy and Harry from hanging out together, but Pansy had waved him and promised Harry that she would call him with all the juicy details later. Blaise Zabini, an elegant man that Harry remembered dimly from their school days, simply looked at Draco, then Harry, and back before saying, “Is this really all you wanted to talk about? Can I go now?”
“We love you, too,” said Draco. He wrapped his arms around Teddy as he stood and kissed the top of his head. Harry smiled at them, the skin at the corner of his wrinkling adorably. The sound of their children’s laughter carried through the open window with the warm summer breeze. Harry’s magic flowed with the breeze, caressing his husband’s cheek lovingly. Draco’s heart in that moment was so full, he thought his ribs might break trying to contain it all. There, in that old cottage kitchen, their lives were complete.
“I don’t think anyone really thought about how hard it was. She was only 11, she didn’t know what was happening.” Luna shook her head, and to Draco’s surprise anger flashed in her eyes. “I can’t believe no one noticed. An adult I mean.”
She nodded. “And Remus is going to go with him, the two of them are going to try and find any horcruxes while they’re at it.” She rubbed at her eyes and Draco wondered when she had last gotten a full night of sleep. And he still had no idea what the bloody hell a horcrux was. Hermione’s explanation had been so confusing he had given up on trying to follow after the first several minutes of what sounded like a class lecture.
“...I don’t bloody care, help me! I’m not equipped for this sort of thing!” Ginny’s voice came through the pool of his own thoughts.
Well hopefully Hermione knew what she was talking about. Apparently she had gone back to her own home to experiment with wards, and in doing so she had discovered the trick to getting them to fall from the outside. In her haste to get back to Grimmauld place before the rest of them woke up, she hadn’t been paying attention. And a snatcher had cursed her. She managed to apparate to the front doorstep, practically bleeding out. Since then she had regained some of her color, but without a blood replenishing potion she was still extremely weak.
“Don’t be sorry.” his father said. “Be better.” Draco stiffened. Be better. He had done his best...He thought he was doing everything right. But...but Granger had gotten the better of him. No, not Granger. It was Potter’s fault. Potter was distracting him. He was probably doing that on purpose. Of course. Potter wanted him to fail. He wanted to bring ruin to the Malfoy name.
It feels good to not be on my own. I didn’t realize how much I appreciated having other people to talk to, but I really do. It feels nice not to just ramble on to you all the time. No offense meant, but you can’t talk back to me. I wish I could send these letters. Perhaps I will one day. If the war is over and all is well...maybe I’ll send these to you and you can find it in your heart to forgive me. We’ll never have what we once did, yet I can’t help but pray we might somehow still be friends. Part of my heart will always belong to you, and I think that means I’ll be able to let you go. I think anyway. I got to Grimmauld place tonight. You never told me Kreacher was your house elf now. He was very happy to see me. I asked him if we wouldn’t mind cooking something for us (Hermione got a little testy about that, not sure why) and his face broke into one of the biggest smiles I’ve ever seen. He’s a damn good cook. Blinky’s food hasn’t been so good in the past few years, probably due to stress. The dark lord always scared the shite out of her. I can relate. We didn’t do much planning today, and for that I’m sorry. Luna said we need to rest, even though none of us have done much quite yet, and most of us found ourselves agreeing. Hermione didn’t say anything about it, just pressed her lips into a thin line and went off to go do something. I think she’s lovesick. I saw her writing letters, Potter. I mean sure, she could be writing to her parents, or cousins, or someone else...but who writes letters to those kinds of people? No no no, letters are meant for love. Try and convince me otherwise. I bet she’s writing to Weasley. Okay I’m sorry. It’s honestly none of my business. I’m merely trying to keep my mind off bigger matters at hand. I should be thinking of a way to rescue you, I know I know. But everytime I think of possibilities my mind wanders to the fact that you don’t remember me. And fuck it hurts so bad I can’t even breath. I’m serious. Before writing this letter I began listing possibilities (even though Luna told me to rest, sorry love) and I had to stop because I got this tight pain in my chest. All of a sudden I couldn’t breath and everything became fuzzy. I ended up ripping the paper to shreds. I mean who am I kidding. None of my ideas are that bright in the first place. Clearly. Sorry. I don’t remember what I was trying to tell you. I guess the main idea of this whole letter is that we aren’t going to give up on finding you. And after our brief rest today, we will be working to the bone until we find you. We’re not just finding you because you’re the only hope of this whole thing, trust me. We’re going to find you because all of us love you dearly, and we cannot imagine a world without you. Even though a world where you don’t remember me hurts like hell, I think a world where you didn’t exist at all would be unbearable. Shite. I’m so screwed.
“You can’t help me,” Malfoy whispered. Tears spilled over, dripping down his hollow cheeks. “I have to do what the Dark Lord ordered… or he’s going to kill
“Just a few minutes ago, Mrs. Weasley,” he said. He joined her in the kitchen, which was overflowing with food. Charlie looked up from shelling peas at the kitchen table and nodded at Harry, who raised a hand in greeting. “Is there anything I can help with?” Harry asked Molly. She shook her head, waving her wand for a stool to scoot out for him as she turned back to the pots on the stove.
“Yeah, I do. I love you. Wow, that’s wild to say out loud, especially since it’s only been two months. You don’t have to say it back,” he added quickly, but Draco cut him off.
He had never been to the Black residence, not even as a child and Walburga Black was still alive. His mother did not like her aunt much, and Draco didn’t blame her, based on the stories he grew up with. In any case, it looked like Harry had done his best to remove every trace of her and centuries of traditional Pureblood taste from his new home. Maybe the furniture was the same, just reupholstered – the claw-footed, bottle green velvet sofa gleamed in the light from the tall windows, an antique rug covered the polished floorboards, and a leather armchair was positioned next to a small end table covered in old copies of
Ron scowled. Nonetheless he said nothing. Taking that as acceptance, Hermione turned on Harry. He immediately surrendered. He knew better than to try and fight Hermione.
When he continued, his voice was so quiet that Draco had to lean forward to hear him. “She said that I was never really in love with her to begin with, that I had already given my heart to someone and that it was doomed from the start. I tried to deny it, but she was right. It’s like… our relationship was infected, and we could never heal from it, because how can you heal when you can’t see the wound, only the infection it has caused?”
Draco lowered his hand from his mouth, his lip trembling. “I love you, too,” he said, his voice thick with tears and years of longing.
The sun began its climb into the overcast London sky. Draco rolled up the note he had written on a small slip of paper and tied it with a spare bit of kitchen twine. He fed Scorpius, grabbed his wand and wallet, pulled on his shoes as if he was just popping out to the shops for milk. All the while the note burned in his pocket.
. He did not tell Ron that after, he had made Draco come in his trousers. Instead, he simply grinned, scaring Ron more than any details of his date could have. “Really well.”
“Why’d you do it?” Harry asked instead of answering. Malfoy’s brow furrowed. “Take the Mark, I mean. You have been Marked, haven’t you?”
“What happened?” he asked, frowning. Hermione let out a dry laugh and gestured at Harry, who was wondering if he could summon his Invisibility Cloak and hide beneath it forever.
“What are you up to?” He shot her a suspicious look, lost somewhat since she couldn’t see much of him from the fire.
“How are you late to a date in your own home, Potter?” Draco called back. He heard Harry laugh, and was glad the other man wasn’t there to see the soft smile spreading across his face. He stuffed his hands in his trouser pockets as he looked around the drawing room.
Draco blinked, mulling this over, trying to think if he had heard anything about this in the news – but he and his mother had stopped reading
Everyone was screaming run run run run but Draco couldn’t move. He could only blink in horror as Severus stood over him and offered him a hand. His arm was no longer his own as it raised itself and placed it’s hand into Severus’s.
It took Draco about five minutes for him to regret his decision. It was bloody cold up here. And there was this gigantic tube of metal that nearly knocked him out of the sky. For a moment Draco had thought that the dark lord had sent some sort of contraption after him, but he decided that he must be mistaken. Hopefully that was. But he was cold. He was cold and he was lost. His plan to fly all over Britain and find the order somehow was not going well at all. Because how on earth was he going to make it all over Britain without keeling over? He was already exhausted and he had hardly been in the air any time at all. After he started to grow worried that he would fall off his broom from numbness, Draco descended towards the ground when he noticed he was above London.
“Yes, it’s very common in the open wards here. If I had any say in it, honestly, the wards would be made more private, with separate rooms for each patient,” Bryn says bitterly, expression like something sour is in their mouth. “Unfortunately, I don't have any say in that, but I can give you something to aid your sleep, if you would like.”
Draco walks along the opposite wall from Wagner’s office as he nears the entrance of the ward, practically pressing his body against the wall, nervous that Wagner will somehow see him leave. The glass in the office doors are opaque and lettered with the healers’ names, and he knows from Soto’s office that they’re not easy to see through, but he doesn’t want to push it.
Draco isn’t sure how that makes him feel, so he thanks Agnes for bringing tea and promises he’ll talk to her later, and she makes her leave with the tray.
Draco nods and smiles slightly, liking them already, and Bryn continues: “Great. Healer Potter, if you will, I think Draco would prefer to do this one-on-one….”
Harry puts his face in his hands. “I’m sorry. I think they’ve gotten the wrong idea. What did she say?”
“Don’t mention it,” George says, waving it off and glancing at Fred. Harry sighs, resigning himself to whatever it is the twins are planning.
Harry laughs, the image of Isabelle dragging Draco’s pants into his room still ingrained in his mind. Having to return those to Draco was the highlight of Harry’s month.
“You didn’t read it? I’m surprised,” Draco drawls, taking it from Potter with barely a glance to his face. He’s afraid his eyes might linger on the shadows under Potter’s eyes—or worse, his lips as he speaks, which is becoming an unfortunate habit anytime Potter is around.
“They’re fine. She slipped away from them. I have a feeling she ran back into the building to rescue the Pygmy Puffs,” memory-Draco says. Potter pinches the bridge of his nose and sighs.
them before, but he puts them on anyway, and emerges from his bedroom to find Draco waiting by the fireplace with the jar of Floo powder.
He immediately spots Hugo and Rose chasing Teddy, who’s holding something just out of their reach. Percy, trying to get someone’s toddler (whose child is that?) out of the Christmas tree without injuring her. Fred and George, playing Exploding Snap with Fred’s partner and cheering loudly. Fleur yelling at Victoire in the hall for “inappropriate behaviour.” Charlie and Ginny arm-wrestle in the corner, money on the table between them.
“Everyone makes mistakes,” Draco says defensively. He’s not quite sure why he’s defending her, considering he barely knows her—though if he’s honest, it’s probably because he just doesn’t want to agree with Potter.
Basil doesn’t seem to be very receptive, still refusing to look at Draco, and he shifts uncomfortably under Gilderoy’s openly expectant look.
“What did I call you—before?” he asks, voice catching over the words. She takes a deep breath to compose herself, the troubled expression leaving her face as she squares her shoulders once again.
Agnes rolls her eyes and, with a slight shake of her head, plops onto her bed with a sigh. He sits in the armchair that Gilderoy recently vacated, watching as Agnes reaches for her notepad and scratches something down.
It’s stupid to be jealous, he tells himself. Draco will be fine — he’ll probably enjoy whatever it is Fred and George have planned — and Harry will be just as fine, thank you very much. He has Neville and Blaise for company, at least.
Draco flinches, tries to cover it up with a smile, and puts his hands over his ears. So much for the quiet greeting he was expecting.
Unfortunately for Harry, though, that means Rosmerta figured out Harry’s feelings for Draco long before Harry himself did. He isn’t sure if she wants to do something for Draco, or has something against Harry, but she always has a comment or a wink up her sleeve anytime they’re together.
Well into the evening, once lunch has been eaten and dinner is prepared, the beginnings of a headache creeps up on Harry, and he retreats to the garden. He sits on the porch steps, casting warming charms to melt the snow, and relishes the quiet.
He swings his feet over the side of his bed and stretches, yawning, before he reaches for his glasses on the bedside table. His hand runs over the smooth table — and meets nothing, not even close to brushing the thin metal frames. He frowns and opens the drawer, leaning in closer to try and make something out.
Bryn quickly walks him through what viewing the memory will be like and what he’ll have to do to view them. Draco shifts uneasily at the thought of pressing his face into the liquid for a prolonged period of time.
“We’ve missed you too, mate,” Ron says sincerely, eyebrows furrowed a bit. Hermione sets aside her book, slipping her bookmark in before turning to face Harry, eyes curious. It’s the same look she gets when a theory is turning in her mind.
“Was that even a diagnostic charm?” Draco grumbles, smoothing his robes and still refusing to actually look at Potter.
Draco smooths out the wrinkles of his hospital robes with a nervous hand, glancing at the stacks of newspapers that he’s tidied up as much as possible, unable to resist reaching out and straightening them. Again.
But now, sitting a few feet away from her, Draco feels a little sick. He can understand why the trainees don't like being in the ward. Rue is much younger than he initially thought she was, and it leaves his stomach twisting.
” Saul Croaker groans from across the ward. Draco chuckles as he closes his curtains behind him, intending to pick up the paper about his trial again. He stops when he notices a folded piece of parchment on his bed.
Despite it, Draco’s eyes immediately find Potter. He couldn’t be any older than eleven. He’s short and scrawny, with his mop of messy black hair and hand-me-downs, and he’s entering Madam Malkin’s with a nervous expression. Draco glances at Bryn, and they give him a small, encouraging nod.
He’s reminded that part of the reason he became a teacher was to get away from the curious eyes of the public. He’d much rather have teenagers gossip about him with their friends than journalists write terribly invasive articles about his love life.
Ron brightened up a bit. “Oh, the shop’s doing great, especially now that the kids are home for the summer hols,” he said. “George’s alright. A little quiet, to be honest.” He frowned to himself for a moment, then shook it off. “He had this idea a little while ago, around the New Year I think, called the Skeleton Key. The idea was that it could get you in anywhere, no matter what – great for playing pranks on people without getting caught, but as I told him, a thing like that would get kids in more trouble than its worth, not to mention the trouble
“You ridiculous queen!” She shook her head and relaxed back into the sofa, picking up her Dostoevsky and pointing it at him with a grin. “You are so getting drinks with him. I need to know how this plays out.”
By the time Malfoy came down, dressed and hair combed, Harry had set a peace offering of toast and eggs next to a steaming cup of black coffee for him. Malfoy eyed it suspiciously, poking the eggs as if expecting them to eat his fork. Harry rolled his eyes. Malfoy took a cautious bite, then another. Kellen waited until Malfoy had polished off his eggs and half of his coffee before starting in on her questions. Harry knew this must be her last case as a Junior Auror – Robards would be an idiot not to promote her – and that he was on the case mostly as a formality, so he only half paid attention while he did the washing up.
“I don’t care if he got an Order of Merlin, that bloody fucking prick tormented us for six fucking years!”
Draco hesitated. He leaned over Harry, elbows on either side of his head, doubt shadowing his lust-blown eyes. “Are you sure?” he asked. “You- you might not like what you see.”
Malfoy scowled at him. “What are you… I wasn’t buying drugs, you nincompoop!” When Harry only shook his head with a laugh, Malfoy shuffled around to face him better, his cheeks flushed as he insisted, “I’m telling the truth! I was told to meet him here because he had a supply of powdered Erumpent horn. Do you know how difficult it is to get powdered Erumpent horn, Potter? In this country? Bloody impossible, let me tell you, especially after Erumpents were put on the Endangered Species list. But when a client asks for a very specific potion that uses powdered Erumpent horn and you are just a small, self-employed Potions Master, you do what you have to do and – ”
“Heathen.” But Harry smiled. He set out the sugar and sat back down. “By the way,” he said, not looking at Malfoy, “I’m queer too. Bisexual. Figured it out after Ginny and I split.”
“One last thing.” Harry leaned in for a kiss, but just as he did, he reached out with his swift Seeker reflexes and snatched the glasses out from under their hiding place. Draco made a grab for them to no avail – Harry had already sprinted away.
Harry let out a scoffing laugh and ducked his head. “You have no idea,” he said with a crooked smile. “I didn’t know there was a word for how I felt, or that it was different from everyone else. I thought….” He swiped at his eyes with his free hand, looked away to hide the tears threatening to slip down his cheeks. He let out a shaking breath. Draco squeezed his hand, waited for Harry to speak. “When I realised,” Harry continued in a broken whisper, “that I – my experience wasn’t normal, I was convinced there must be something wrong, that maybe being a Horcrux for so long had damaged me somehow. But Hermione assures me that it’s perfectly normal.” He frowned at their joined hands, threaded his fingers through Draco’s and held tight.
“This is a lot to take in,” Draco said slowly. Harry hummed. “I can’t imagine what you’ve been going through,” he added, cradling Harry against his chest, burying his nose in Harry’s curls. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, pressed his forehead against Draco’s collarbone. “But we’ll figure it out. Together. Okay?”
Draco chuckled against Harry’s mouth, one hand on his shoulder as he shifted on the bed. Harry kept his hands in his lap, unsure of what to do, trying to relax, let it happen. The kiss grew clumsy, too much teeth, too fast too soon. Draco pulled away. Harry’s stomach sank. But the other man’s smile was soft, confused but kind.
They all shrugged and muttered that “yeah, that works.” Harry looked over at Malfoy, who was still staring at the fire in the grate. “Malfoy?” he called. The other boy looked up for the first time that night. He looked so tired, Harry thought. “You’re rooming with us Gryffindors. That okay with you?”
Harry sighed. He got up to go and kneel in front of the fire. Draco hesitated, then joined him – Harry’s Gryffindor nature must be rubbing off on him, not that he would ever admit it. Hermione’s eyes narrowed for a moment. Then she turned to Harry and pretended to ignore Draco entirely.
Hermione rolled her eyes, but got up to carry Rose off to her room. Rose began to cry – she had apparently been having too much fun listening to the adults. The minute Hermione had disappeared, Ron shuffled closer and hissed, “What the fuck are you thinking, Harry? Shagging Draco fucking Malfoy?”
“Uncle Harry! Uncle Harry!” Teddy wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck as he balanced the ten-year-old on his knee. “Happy Christmas! Aunt Luna says that my head is full of Nargles but I can’t see them, can you?”
“Do you want to sit next to Hermione?” Harry asked in the same tone he used when he asked Teddy if he was going to behave or carry on having a tantrum. Draco shrugged.
Harry choked on his tea. As he spluttered and coughed, he couldn’t help but notice the smirk that flashed across McGonagall’s face.
Harry flinched. It wasn’t exactly public knowledge that Harry fancied men and women, although there had been rumours in the
“‘Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement,’” Draco quoted, his voice shaking. In any other moment, Harry would have teased him for quoting Tolkien, but now, his heart was in his throat and all he could do was look at Draco with all his love.
Harry chuckled and shook his head at Draco. “I’ve been fine,” he said, raising his voice unnecessarily to be heard. Didn’t he know that Draco could hear him anywhere? “You?”
Harry snorted at this. “Sensitive doesn’t even begin to cover it,” he teased. Draco gently tugged his hair in reprimand with a playful scowl.
Kellen’s eyebrows shot up towards her fringe. Malfoy’s head snapped up to stare at Harry. This time, Harry couldn’t quite make out Malfoy’s expression, but the strange fluttering sensation in his stomach was the same. He took a bite of his toast, hoping that would help settle his stomach.
The nausea passed until it was just an ache in his gut. He pushed his hair off his forehead, passed his wand over himself to wick away the sweat, wiped his clammy hands on his trousers. The kettle whistled. He set about putting the tea things on a tray while the kettle poured the boiling water into a teapot, which in turn floated over to the spot Draco had made for it on the tray. He carried it into the living room, grateful that his hands didn’t shake, not once.
She released his palm and patted him on the cheek. Her usually distant eyes seemed to look straight into him, then, as if all of Harry’s secrets were laid bare before her. Harry’s chest tightened, and he felt his cheeks flush involuntarily as he tried to stutter out something, anything in his defence. Luna opened her mouth, as if to say something else, but instead she turned towards Ginny. “Your turn, Gin! Let’s see those hands!”
“How dare you!” Draco gave an exaggerated gasp and clutched his imaginary pearls as he leaned back on the bed. “I’m strong!”
Draco nodded. He turned back, looking out over the grounds. Harry came and stood beside him, crossing his arms against the top of the low wall. Together, they watched the crowd trickle back from the Quidditch pitch to the castle as the sun began to set over the lake. Harry shivered as the cool wind brushed against the sweaty nape of his neck. When the last few stragglers finally disappeared inside, Draco turned to face Harry.
“I don’t want to lose you again, either,” Draco said in answer to Harry’s unspoken question. “Plus, I’m pretty sure Pansy would kill me if I said no.”
“Want to talk? Outside?” he murmured. Draco tried to swallow the shiver that ran through him, to fight the urge to turn his head and catch those lips with his. He managed to nod again, and stepped back, gesturing for Harry to lead the way. Harry smirked, but it didn’t reach his eyes.
Harry chuckled. “That’s more like you.” Without another word, he pulled Draco’s pants down and off, tossing them to the side before crawling back, his pupils blown wide with lust behind his glasses. Draco barely had time to gasp before Harry took his cock in his calloused hand. He licked a broad stripe up the underside, making Draco moan, before taking him into his mouth and beginning to bob up and down, taking more of him in each time. Draco tried not to buck up into his mouth, even as he tangled a hand in Harry’s curls to slow him down. Harry moaned his approval, sending vibrations down his length. His hand around the base of Draco’s cock moved lower to massage his balls. Draco could not stop his hips from snapping up at that, and when his dick hit the back of Harry’s throat, making him gag, Draco knew he wouldn’t last much longer.
“Not if it’s justified!” Ron yelled back. “Lucius Malfoy was the one who put that bloody Horcrux in Ginny’s cauldron back in second year! He was there at the Ministry when Sirius died! He wanted to turn us over to You-Know-Who at the Manor! He fucking deserved what he got!”
lay on top of Molly’s quilt. He was almost done, and Draco had already put the second book underneath the cot for when Harry was ready. He had warned Draco that if he asked Harry what he thought about the book one more time, he’d chuck the book at him. He reached out, brushed his fingers across the well-loved cover that curled up at the corners. Draco’s gaze was heavy on his skin, but still Harry was silent, unable to get the words right in his head.
Draco was flabbergasted. “How dare you bet on my love life!” he shouted. But Pansy just waved him off. She turned on her heel and strutted towards the bathroom, discarding the bathrobe as she went. Draco immediately swivelled away and covered his eyes with his hands. “Fuck, Pans! You want to blind me?”
Harry let him cry as long as he needed. He held Draco long after the sobs died down, brushed the hair from Draco’s tear-stricken cheeks, rubbed his back as his breathing slowly steadied. He held one of Draco’s hands against his chest so Draco could feel his heartbeat, so warm and immediate, just there beneath the surface.
“Draco Malfoy? You’re dating that little fucker?” Ron bellowed. His face bypassed red and went straight to puce. “After everything’s he’s done?”
Harry shrugged again. “We’re both morning people, we both like to read,” although Draco, as Harry started calling him, preferred classic novels to Harry’s YA books, “and, I don’t know, we both support Manchester United.” Draco sometimes slept in a Manchester United jersey when his clothes were in the laundry, in any case. Not that he would tell Ron that part. “I don’t know, what do you want me to say? I have to spend the whole year with the bloke, we’re bound to get along if we weren’t going to kill each other.”
With that, he stood, pushing away from the table in one sharp, fluid movement. Before Harry could begin to stammer out an apology, the king strode out of the room, flanked by his guards. Harry’s shoulders slumped. He buried his face in his hands and groaned.
a dick move, though,” she added, raising her head to give him a hard look. “I can’t apologise for Ron, but you have to understand – he was upset, grieving, we all are. I’m not saying he should have attacked Malfoy – Draco – like that, but Harry, you have to understand…”
The first time, Harry was five and hadn’t yet learned to hold his tongue. He was out in the market with his aunt and, while passing the butcher’s wife, pointed and said, “She’s going to get the pox,” knowing full well that was a death sentence. His aunt, horrified, apologised profusely to the butcher’s wife, said that he was the idiot son of their cook (a fiction his aunt loved to repeat to anyone who would hear) and that he didn’t know what he was talking about. Later, she tied a strip of cloth over his mouth so that he might “learn to think before he spoke.” The knot was so tight he could not untie it or slip the cloth up or down – it was only when he went to Mistress Figg’s the next day for his lessons that it was removed.
”; pain, and so much blood… He opened his eyes with a sigh. There were tears in Harry’s eyes, just as there were back then when he had fallen to his knees besides Draco, trying desperately to stop the bleeding.
Harry chuckled and Draco grinned. “That’s fair,” Harry admitted. “But Draco’s right, you should probably tell your godmother. You don’t have to tell her right away, that’s entirely up to you. But you know that she, like us, will love and support you no matter what.”
Draco sighed and turned away from Harry, his gaze fixed on the moth-eaten bed skirt. A cloud passed over the sun outside, sending a dark shadow across the room. Draco’s form coalesced, grew more solid beside him, but Harry knew that if he reached out, there would still be no flesh and blood there to touch. So he held his hands in his lap instead.
“So let’s not treat him like he chose Azkaban, alright? The war’s over. Let’s just try to move on, okay?” Harry levelled his gaze at each of the other boys in turn until they all either looked away or nodded. “Right. How about this – we try Zacharias’s idea, and if anyone wants to switch rooms at any time, we can switch. How does everyone feel about that?”
“Who knows,” he murmured. “Piers runs his mouth like his life depends on it, he’s probably got a whole story cooked up, whether it’s true or not doesn’t matter. He and Vince have at least told everyone we – they know that I’m gay. You’ve heard them, they don’t need much in the way of proof to believe it.” He let out a sharp exhale that was meant to be a laugh. “They’re probably telling people you turned me gay. Like I needed any help in that department.”
Draco almost dropped the watch, his hands were shaking so much. But this time, Harry could see the anger burning in his eyes, in the flush rising in his pale cheeks. “Father, I can’t marry her,” he said, his voice steady and firm. Lucius frowned.
it say?” Harry prompted her. Draco lowered his hands just enough to see Hermione’s reaction. She pursed her lips and dropped her head, scanning the text in front of her.
Harry scrambled over to his side of the room, diving onto his bed and picking up Draco’s gift and opening it at random to hide his flaming face. He pulled his knees up in hopes that whoever it was wouldn’t notice the semi in his trousers. Draco looked frantically from his bed to his desk, decided on the latter, and sat down in his desk chair, pulling himself close to the desk and pretending to be looking at his phone. He cleared his throat and called, “Come in.”
When he opened his eyes again, Harry was watching him, and he knew Harry remembered it all. “I tried to ignore it,” he continued, voice barely above a whisper, “but every time, all I wanted was you.”
.” With that, Malfoy sank to his knees, his head in his hands as he sobbed. “Oh gods,” he wept. “Oh gods, what have I done?”
“In the end, Dumbledore did die that year, but not by me. The school fell to the Death Eaters. The Dark Lord lived in our manor, when he wasn’t out seeking more powerful weapons. I could never escape the fact that I had chosen the wrong side, and could do nothing but follow along lest I be killed as well, or worse. Then, there was the final battle. Harry died but came back to life – don’t ask, I don’t know myself – and when he did, he finally killed the Dark Lord. He won the war. At seventeen, he was the saviour of the wizarding world.
Her face flickered, then disappeared. One of the logs cracked as the fire began to collapse in on itself. Harry groaned and flopped onto his back, knees up and feet inching dangerously close to the fireplace.
Draco scurried off to the kitchen. With a flick of his wand, he filled the kettle and set it on the stove to heat while he stood, hands braced against the kitchen sink, taking deep breaths and trying not to be sick. His shirt stuck to his back where he’d broken out in a cold sweat. Distantly, he heard Harry moving about, the creak of the floorboards as he walked around the living room. Draco counted to twenty in his head, then back down to zero.
“Should probably get through this Victoire business first, though,” Draco added, patting Teddy’s knee. “Just like repotting a Mandrake. The sooner you get it over with, the better.”
Harry waited until the flames had died down before he turned to Malfoy. “You obviously don’t have to stay here if you don’t want to,” he said softly. “When Robards gets here, we can arrange something else and…”
“The boy who never takes communion,” he said, his gentle, lyrical voice lilting with his smile. “What brings you to this humble church today? You missed the service.”
The lock clicked, and the door to the compartment swung open. They jumped back, away from each other, Harry letting go of Malfoy’s arm just in time to see the newcomer cock her head and raise her eyebrows.
,” Draco moaned. They both froze for a moment as the words hung in the air. But before Draco could take it back, Harry began to bob up and down in earnest. Draco came with a sob within seconds.
Malfoy crossed his legs, bracing his ankle against his opposite knee, and leaned back in his chair. “Merlin, I don’t know,” he said with a lopsided smile. “I didn’t really think that far ahead.”
Potter’s nose crinkled as his shit-eating grin grew. “Yeah, you don’t seem like the running type,” he said. He stepped a little closer, plucking at Draco’s thermal jacket. “This is nice, though.”
. And when Harry fell to his knees in front of him, looked up at him with those summer sunshine eyes, and asked if he could – all Draco could whisper was
Robards was not happy about Harry calling him on his personal Floo, but once Harry explained the situation, he did concede that this was sufficiently urgent. They came up with a plan just as Harry heard the pipes stop rattling. Malfoy must be out of the shower. Unbidden, the thought of Malfoy’s wet, naked body flashed through his mind, and Harry shook his head to clear the image away – it definitely was not appropriate. He finished his call with Robards, stretched out his creaking knees, then called Kellen to bring her up to speed. She agreed to come by first thing in the morning. Her face had just flickered away into the dying fire when Harry heard the bathroom door open and the light click off.
Ron slammed his plate down on the table, making both Harry and Hermione jump. “What the bloody hell are you thinking?” he demanded. He braced his hands on his hips. In that moment, Harry could see him as a father to the baby growing in Hermione’s belly so easily that he thought someone had spun a Time Turner and landed him in the future. But no – Hermione was still pregnant, and Ron was pinning him down with a confused but furious glare.
Malfoy pushed off Harry’s desk and poked a finger to Harry’s chest, pressing him back in his chair as he leaned in with smug delight.
Harry turned away, leaving Jenkins a trembling mess behind him. He made his way over to the fireplace, where Kellen was conferring with one of the forensic staff. She dismissed the other man as Harry approached. He gave her a side-long look, and she smirked, a dimple forming in her cheek.
Harry sighed. He shifted and waved his wand at the room. Immediately, the room began to piece itself back together – the cracks in the wall filled, the sofa righted itself and shuffled back to the centre of the room, the picture frames hung themselves back up, the bookshelves mended and the books flew back into place. Even a merry fire burst into flame in the fireplace. The coffee table, unsure what to do about the two men in its spot, simply got a bit taller and arranged itself above them. Harry exhaled sharply through his nose. He got up grudgingly, pulling Draco with him so that they could get out of the coffee table’s way, which immediately lowered to its normal height once they sat down on the sofa. Harry looked down at his hands.
Hermione ducked her head, worrying her lip. Harry’s stomach squirmed. “I’m sorry,” he mumbled. “That was uncalled for.”
“So of course they decided to disguise themselves as my ex-nemesis to charm their way into my bed?” Harry smirked when Ron got flustered and spluttered at this. “Besides, I have wards up on Grimmauld Place against stuff like that, and he’s never triggered any of them. So I can assure you, he’s genuine.”
“Alright, alright,” Harry said, cutting off Malfoy’s tirade with a raised hand. He sighed as he considered Malfoy. It was true that, as far as DMLE surveillance was concerned, Malfoy hadn’t had so much as a littering fine since his trial and subsequent probation. There was nothing about him now, even, that would hint at him being an addict – no red-rimmed eyes, no twitching hands, no desperate twist to his features. No, he looked… good. There was a healthy warmth to his pale skin, and while he was still thin, all angles and cutting edges, there was a softness to his cheeks, muscle in the shoulders left exposed above the ropes. His clothes, as ever, were sophisticated and neat – starched white button down and dark trousers, his polished shoes shining in the harsh light. Harry frowned.
Draco wrapped his arm around Harry’s waist so that they could walk more comfortably. “Alright then,” he said, “I guess I’ll keep you around then.”
Draco wasn’t back yet when Harry returned to school the Saturday after the winter holidays. It gave Harry time to do what he would never dare do if Draco was around: he went over to Draco’s side of the room and looked around.
Draco added the chopped carrot to the pan, pushing it around with a spoon to sauté with the onions and garlic. When he finally turned around, he let out a long begrudging sigh.
Harry shrugged. “It belonged to you,” he said. “It wasn’t mine to keep. Besides, I fixed mine, so I didn’t need it.” Malfoy rolled his eyes, the beginnings of a laugh in the curl of his lips.
“Alright. Tired. We’ve been sorting out his parents’ funeral. Who would have thought I would be helping sort out Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy’s funeral?” He scrubbed his face with his hand, a mirthless laugh falling exhausted from his lips. “But otherwise, he’s good. The bruises are healing.” He let out a long exhale through pursed lips as he looked at Hermione over the rim of his glasses. “Can I ask you something? What do you think of all this? Don’t hold back,” he added when Hermione began chewing her lip again. “Just be honest with me, okay?”
“Oh.” Draco traced a lazy pattern on Harry’s chest as he mulled this over. “I mean, technically, he’s my cousin. On my mother’s side. So it’ll be good for me to meet him.”
Harry heard a quiet, disparaging laugh behind him. “Wow, I really can’t catch a break, can I?” Malfoy whispered. Harry shot him a look to tell him to be quiet, but Malfoy only shook his head.
Harry grumbled, but after a minute or two, he sighed and began to talk, his voice muffled against Draco’s neck.
Harry stepped back, away from Draco. He pushed his glasses up the crooked bridge of his nose as he stared at the worn stone floor, the scraps of onion skin here and there. Draco hesitated, then turned back to his cooking as if nothing had happened. After a long pause, he murmured, “Dinner will be ready soon.” Harry nodded and mumbled that he needed to use the loo before walking hurriedly out of the room. He didn’t run, no, of course not. And he definitely didn’t collapse against the bathroom door, didn’t sink into a puddle on the floor as he buried his hands in his wild curls.
The next weekend, having secured an extension on the essay from Professor Ashwagandha, Draco found himself back in the empty common room in the middle of the night. He thought about what Harry had said. He took a deep breath, let it out in a long sigh. He had tried everything else – moments from his childhood, his mother’s smile, flying – but nothing worked, his memories always tainted with horror – the Manor floor covered in blood, the broken look in his mother’s eyes, Fiend Fyre choking his lungs. So he closed his eyes. Took another deep, steadying breath. Thought of what made himself feel full of light, love, happiness, whatever you want to call it. And there, in the quiet of his mind, he saw it – a devilish smile, calloused hands, and summer-coloured eyes.
“Yes, Teddy?” There was the sound of plates being set on the kitchen table, the scrape of a chair being pulled back.
“Tired,” Draco finished. Harry nodded. There had been a few times over the term that Draco had come to tea only to find Harry passed out in his desk chair, and while the nightmares were less frequent when he slept with him, Draco knew that they still tormented him. They had spent too many nights already having to calm each other down from their respective night terrors. The peace the world had now came at a cost, one that still made itself known over ten years later. The wounds would never really heal.
Harry shrugged again. He hung his head as he stared at the bloodied shirt in his hands. “Not sure, really,” he muttered. “Still figuring it out, you know? But even if – no one can know.” He let out a long breath before pulling his shirt back on, the fabric sticking to his sweaty skin.
“It’s like the Yule Ball all over again,” he observed, his voice distant even as his grip on Harry’s arm tightened ever so slightly. Harry looked over at him and smiled.
“Something must have come up,” he said. There was soil in his hair. When Harry pointed it out, Neville laughed. “Oh yeah,” he said. “The third years learned that some plants do not like getting re-potted. Occupational hazard.”
“You shouldn’t have to forgive me,” Draco argued. “I shouldn’t have done all those things in the first place.”
“I’m afraid I’m out of your favourite biscuits,” Harry was saying, stretching up on his tip toes as he rummaged blindly for the Jaffa cakes on the top shelf. His hoodie had ridden up as he reached, revealing golden skin and the dimple of his low back just above the elastic of his pants. His joggers had slouched indecently low, revealing the top few centimetres of tight black boxers. And Merlin, all it would take was one small push…
“Nothing. Everything.” Harry crossed his arms over his chest as he took a deep breath, trying to steady himself. “Last year… last year, after you told me, my scar started hurting, remember?” Draco nodded with a frown. “Well, when it did, I started… remembering. I saw everything. Everything that happened in your world, to your Harry Potter. And it was too much, I couldn’t handle it, and I’m sorry, I ran. I thought I would never be able to face you again. But in the end, I couldn’t stay away.” He met Draco’s gaze, his green eyes earnest as he searched Draco’s face. Draco shook his head and passed a hand over his face.
“I apologise, your Honour,” said Draco. The judge nodded, her face impassive. She asked Draco to outline how he knew George, and whether he or his family had any previous threats from George or anyone else – “Not recently, your Honour, but after the war, we received enough for a lifetime” – before dismissing him back to his seat. When Draco sat back down next to Harry, his hands were shaking like leaves caught in a storm. Harry felt Ron’s glare heavy on their necks. Nonetheless, he leaned in and whispered in Draco’s ear, “You did good.” Draco gave him a tiny grateful smile.
“Hey now.” Harry poked Draco in the chest. “I’m not poor. I’m middle class, thank you very much.” But Draco was still spiralling, Harry could tell by the panicked look creeping into his eyes. He uncurled himself and reached out to take Draco’s face in his hands. “Hey, hey. It’s okay. Yes, you were a dick. But it’s okay. I forgive you.”
Later that day, sometime around one in the afternoon, after Draco had stripped the bed and showered, trying to rid himself of Harry’s scent, he sat down to his lunch of black coffee and a biscuit in the living room. He had barely lifted the biscuit to his mouth when Pansy burst through the fireplace.
, and a twin killed by Death Eaters? But no, it was too simple, too easy, and besides, it was George, bubbly, happy George. George, who didn’t laugh for years after Fred died. George, who, by his own wife’s admission last Christmas, had become somewhat reclusive, secretive even? George, who had designed a key that could get him in anywhere.
.” Harry’s breath hitched in his throat, and he tried to steady himself again. It was as if the other Harry Potter was speaking through him, as if the words coming out of his mouth weren’t his but the other Harry’s, as if he was nothing more than a conduit from one world to another.
Which is how Draco ended up in Harry’s flat at just past one in the morning. Apparently what Harry meant when he said that he knew a place was, in fact, his own kitchen. Harry had sold 12 Grimmauld Place – “It never felt like mine,” he explained as he poured them each a measure of Firewhiskey, “and not to mention it was creepy as hell, even after Hermione and I tried to redecorate.” His new place was a penthouse flat in a converted abbey, situated amidst the lofty roof complete with white-plastered arches still boasting their medieval mouldings, ancient oak beams and floorboards that squeaked beneath their feet. The flat was long but spacious and open plan, cosily lit by mid-century modern floor lamps and arranged with second-hand furniture. A black leather couch and two vintage-looking wing-backed armchairs sat around a stout coffee table with clawed feet, and a desk was pushed up against one of the tall arched windows. The kitchen looked the most modern, but even the butcher-block countertop appeared hand-crafted, and the way the cupboards accommodated one of the vaulting arches made it seem like they had always been there. At the far end, the bedroom was screened from view by the kitchen wall, while another wall cordoned off what must be the bathroom. Draco sat on one of the stools at the breakfast bar in the kitchen and looked around, impressed and strangely nostalgic.
The blood drained from Andromeda’s face. Harry bounced Teddy on his knee and tried to distract the boy from the tension between the other two by stealing his nose.
Harry sighed heavily as he sat back down with his milky tea. McGonagall watched him as she sipped at her own – black, no milk, no sugar. “I haven’t talked to him since his trial,” Harry admitted at last. “And that was seven…no, ten years ago? It’s been a long time.”
“You busy?” Potter asked. He shoved his hands into the pocket of his hoodie, his gaze growing heavy as he considered Draco. “You could come over if you want, I could make you some tea or coffee, get out of the cold.”
“I know,” Draco sighed. “I can’t imagine – yours must be so much worse, I shouldn’t, you shouldn’t have to deal with mine too….”
“Not if you’re going to be like that about it!” Draco crossed his arms when Harry pouted at him. “Your sad faces aren’t going to sway me on this. For Merlin’s sake, Harry, this is more than just you, you realise that, don’t you? Who knows how many other LGBTQ people in the Ministry are struggling because of conservative, bigoted policy? But if Harry Potter says something,
A pale hand shot out and pulled the empty chair across from him out. Malfoy sat down heavily, crossed his ankle over his knee, and leaned his head in his hand as he grinned at Harry.
Draco rubbed at his eyes and sat up, slumping only a little against the back of the couch. “Something must have gone wrong,” he said thickly, “because the next thing I knew I was standing in the bedroom upstairs, wandless, and, for all intents and purposes, a ghost. That first year, I learned two things: one, that people could only see me four times a year, if they saw me at all – I’m afraid I scared quite a few homeless people that year – and two, that I had somehow been sent twenty-one years into the past.
Draco groaned. He ran his fingers through his hair, which he hadn’t had the energy to style properly in days. The strands ran thin and flat through his hands. “Better than the fucking Chosen One?” he grumbled. “Not likely.”
“I want it gone,” Draco breathed. Harry’s eyes widened, but he stayed silent. Draco swallowed again before continuing in a choked voice, “I just… Granger’s right. All this does is remind me of everything I used to be, and you deserve better than this, than me. How could you love me? I – ”
“We’ll go to Dumbledore,” he repeated. “Tell him everything. He’ll know what to do. He’ll know how to protect you. It’s the only way.”
“Alright. Walk me through what happened the last time you were with him,” she said, “since you seem hell-bent on distracting me.”
“It tends to get lost, what with the whole ‘Prince of Death’ thing.” Harry chuckled into his wine. “I really hate that title. Makes it sound like I’m some posh, entitled bast-” He remembered who he was talking to almost a minute too late. He set his cup down, ducking his head to hide the blush.
“I know you don’t want to do this – this – whatever he sent you to do. You could be a double agent, like Snape.” Malfoy looked up, blinking in surprise. Still, he shook his head, biting his lip. Harry stepped forward and grabbed hold of Malfoy’s arm, right over where he knew the Mark to be. Malfoy winced like he’d burned him. Harry frowned.
He didn’t think. He just wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and hugged him tight, his face buried against the other man’s chest. Draco froze. He held the spoon he was using to stir the pasta suspended in mid-air for a moment. Harry was just about to let go and step away, apologise, say he didn’t know what came over him, when there was the clatter of the spoon against the counter and Draco’s arms were around him, holding him close.
The king raised his head, a slightly panicked look in his distant eyes. Harry stifled a shiver, and wondered if perhaps he had overstepped. But then the king blinked, and he seemed to return to himself once more. He straightened up, lifting his chin as he turned to his attendant.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, his voice breaking the heavy silence. “It was just once, but – Ginny, it was like I could breathe for the first time, like my magic was his magic, and it was just for a second, but I – I’m sorry.” The apology came out choked and broken, tears welling up and threatening to spill down his cheeks. Ginny just stared at him, unmoving, unblinking. Draco hugged his arms around himself, holding himself back from going over and pulling Harry back into his embrace. Ginny let out the breath she had been holding, ragged and torn.
“Draco!” Parkinson called, making his way to the front of the crowd. “Just the person we were looking for.”
“They have to learn one way or another,” she replied. Harry let out a dry chuckle and her smile broadened. “In any case,” she said, gesturing at the room, “it looks like it happened rather quickly – no sign of a struggle. Whoever did it got in and out and didn’t waste any time doing it. But how did they get in?”
Draco lifted a shoulder, let it fall. “It had to happen,” he said. He trailed his hand up Harry’s navel, his fingers tracing patterns over his shirt. “I have a lot to answer for.”
Molly rolled her eyes at him with a smile. “Why don’t you two go out and join the party? Dinner will be ready soon.”
“From the other day,” replied Draco. He covered the pan with a lid to let the vegetables steam a bit before pulling some fresh basil and thyme from a jar of water. As he sliced the basil into thin ribbons, unfurling green and bruised from the blade, he added, “You asked me why I didn’t say anything at the Manor. Well, there you have it.”
Praxis: practice, as distinguished from theory; the process by which a theory is realised. (Wikipedia, Oxford Languages).
Harry beamed, mischief dancing in his green eyes. “Be glad I’m on your side now,” he said before leaning in for a kiss. It was meant to be a quick peck, but Draco’s hand on his neck held him there, and before they knew it, Draco was pushing him back into the bed.
“Just go with it, Malfoy,” she told him. “You can’t outrun Harry when he has his mind set.” Draco, who had barely talked to Hermione all term, considered her with narrowed eyes.
“Sod it,” he muttered to himself, setting his glass down on the windowsill and getting up to go confront Harry, there and then. He hadn’t taken two steps towards the other man, however, when Astoria’s hand shot out, seemingly from nowhere, and pulled him down to the floor where a group of them had begun playing Truth and Dare. Draco was about to make his excuses when he saw Hermione do the same to Potter. He sighed and settled in beside the younger girl, his gaze always flicking over to the other pair. Hermione looked concerned, her eyebrows knitted together and one hand on Potter’s shoulder as they whispered together for a moment. Draco strained to catch even a word of their conversation, but it was useless over the din of the party.
Draco looked at him in mock scandalised surprise. “Really?” he said with an exaggerated gasp. “Who would have thought?”
“I didn’t know what to do,” he admitted softly. “But then there was a great crashing sound from the campsite, and they looked up and saw me. For a moment, none of us said anything, just stared at each other. Then there was another crash, and screams, and the sound of people running into the woods, away from whatever was going on at the campsite. I panicked. ‘Run,’ I told them. ‘Go. Before anyone sees.
“But I still want you,” Draco whispered. Harry gasped. His eyes fell to Draco’s lips, a question. Draco gave him his answer.
“Seeing as I cannot trust you to resolve the situation, I am taking this task on myself. Sir Harry here,” Harry blinked at being called sir this early in the morning, “will travel with me to the villages and gather witness accounts, reports from the constabulary, and so on. As it has recently been pointed out to me, it has been too long since I left the palace grounds.” He glanced again at Harry. There was something secret in the curl of his lips then, gone before Harry could realise it was even there. “We set out at first light. If there are no other pressing matters, I must go prepare.” He spun on his heel and, without another word, strode out of the council chamber, the protests of his advisors crashing against his slim shoulders.
Kellen glanced at Harry, then back to Draco. Harry tried to swallow, his throat tight and stomach jittery. “I think,” she said slowly, “that protocol dictates witnesses stay under protective custody until after the sentencing, isn’t that correct, sir?”
“Why?” Draco glared at him, his hands balling into fists in his lap. “Why are you so damn set on helping me?”
Malfoy shrugged. “I expect you keep tabs on me,” he said, waving at Harry dismissively, a heavy silver ring glinting on his finger. “Wouldn’t be a surprise, after practically stalking me in sixth year.”
Harry shrugged. “It’s just the summers now. Although I am planning on staying with Ron this summer before uni. What?” For Draco had sat up, dislodging Harry from his very comfortable position on his chest. Draco stared at Harry in consternation.
As Harry came out of the shower, towel wrapped around his waist, he noticed Draco sitting on the edge of Harry’s bed, still just in his boxers from the night before. He was wringing his hands, his head bowed, his bedhead making Harry’s heart squeeze.
“Oh, I do,” Harry interrupted him, moving to place one finger against Draco’s lips to quiet him. Draco pressed his lips back against Harry’s finger, and Harry groaned in frustration, wanting so much to let Draco suck his finger into his mouth, to do dirty things with it – no, focus. He moved his hand away to cup Draco’s face instead, cradling his jaw. “Let’s take this slow, okay? For both of our sakes.”
“All of my other Senior Aurors are on cases. If anyone else was available, trust me, I would give it to them. But speed is of the essence here. At least do the initial crime scene report, and if it’s too much, I’ll have Auror Singh switch cases with you, but we both know Kellen would prefer to have you on this with her.”
Harry sat up and crossed his arms over his chest. “That’s legal,” he said stubbornly. “I’m basically an adult.” Draco rolled his eyes.
When McGonagall showed them to the eighth-year dormitory, Harry leaned over to Hermione and asked, “Does Malfoy look different to you?” She rolled her eyes.
“Well, I told Ron and Hermione of course. And Neville, although that was a bit of an accident. We’d had a little too much to drink one night and it just came out. And now you.” Harry began pouring tea into their cups to give himself something to do. He could feel Malfoy looking at him, but it was not until Harry had finished pouring the tea that Malfoy said anything.
Draco blushed. He wore a set of sleeveless charcoal grey robes that buttoned up to his throat over his pale, cornflower blue button-down and dark, well-tailored trousers. His hair was pushed back off his forehead, the ends curling slightly. He fidgeted with the heavy silver signet ring on his right hand under Harry’s gaze as he stood on the landing.
Draco smiled tentative and slow. “Never better,” he replied, and was surprised to find he meant it. Harry beamed up at him. Draco’s heart contracted, then expanded to fill his chest, again and again, like the tide pulling a wave in and out against the rocky shores of his ribs. He raised a hand unconsciously to push some of the curls out of Harry’s face. Harry blinked. Draco’s hand froze, but just as he moved to pull away, to pretend like nothing had happened, Harry’s other hand reached up and tangled with Draco’s, bringing it to his cheek. Draco gasped. When Harry turned his head to press a small kiss to Draco’s palm, he stopped breathing altogether.
“You’re being nice to me,” he explained as if telling Potter that water is wet. “You’re only nice to me when you want something.”
“Focus, Malfoy.” Harry knew he should have smiled and laughed at Malfoy’s obvious attraction – he had a similar reaction, after all, when he first met Humphries, only to find out that Humphries was as straight as they get. Instead, something ugly twisted in his gut, sharp and hot like a burning poker. He stamped it down hard and sat down across from Malfoy. Malfoy, who had still been staring after Humphries, finally tore his gaze away and focused his attention on Harry. A small crease formed between his brows as he registered Harry’s expression.
As Luna rolled over to Ginny, who was now forced to focus all of her attention on the other girl instead of him, Harry stumbled to his feet, swaying slightly. “Have to piss,” he mumbled, and tried to walk in as straight a line as possible out to the hallway, lighting his way with a small torch. After a quick detour to the toilet, he leaned against the door to the water closet, trying to get the world to stop spinning. He took one deep breath, then another. He had to sober up, or throw up.
“No,” Harry said quickly, waving off their concern. Ron narrowed his eyes but said nothing. “No, it’s nothing bad – it’s good, actually.” Hermione relaxed with a sigh of, “That’s a relief,” but Ron still watched Harry like a hawk. Harry swallowed. “You see, um, we got a new Potions Master.”
“I will never leave you,” Harry said softly. “Not just because it is apparently physically impossible, but because you are everything to me. I only wish I had figured it out sooner.”
Draco groaned at the prospect. Blaise grinned, apparently sharing the sentiment, but Pansy nudged them both in the ribs and told them to grow up and have fun, which sounded like an oxymoron to Draco. Chuckling, he turned to the bartender to order his whiskey. He blushed slightly when he recognised the bartender, a burly man with a well-trimmed beard, from a one night stand he’d had about six months back. The bartender winked at him but said nothing as he poured him two fingers of whiskey.
Harry frowned. “What do you mean, slow down?” he asked. Draco pulled back more, his smile growing into disbelief. He raised an eyebrow, his ocean grey eyes searching Harry’s face. Harry felt the thrum of his pulse deep in his gut, beating against the nausea building in his twisting stomach. “Show me,” Harry insisted. “Please.”
He Apparated to Diagon Alley and made his way past bleary eyed commuters to the post office. It was late August, still summer really, but there was a brisk chill in the air. Draco shivered, regretting not putting on a jacket over his plain button-down. When he reached the post office, he swore just loud enough for a couple of older witches to give him a reprimanding glare.
Malfoy hesitated. Then, carefully, as if afraid Harry was going to hit him, he leaned into Harry, the whole lengths of their bodies touching. Harry bowed his head. He pressed back, appreciating this small gesture of companionship, even if it was from Draco Malfoy. They stood in silence for a moment, watching the cars below pass through the quiet streets.
After he and Kellen had viewed the memory of the attack – the shortest memory Harry had ever seen, lasting only seconds – several times over, they spent hours debating the details. Auror Tsai, who was on guard duty that day, weighed in on the discussion when they got to talking about the type of mask the attacker wore, since she had worked a case where a serial killer also wore a mask. By the time the clock struck five p.m., they were no closer to an answer, but had probably weighed every option of cloak and mask supplier known to man. It was only when Kellen was preparing to leave for the night when Harry put his hand in his pocket and remembered the vial.
When they kissed, sweet and tender at first, the world came to a halt. Then, when the kiss deepened, grew hungry and passionate and desperate, the world spun on, faster and faster around them as they tore at each other’s clothes, as they moaned into each other’s mouths, as they came together again and again, skin against skin. By the time they slowed, naked and covered in sweat and grime as they lay on the old four-poster bed in each other’s arms, the day had begun to wane, but they still had several hours before the darkness came. Until then, until reality returned, they could stay there, Harry’s head on Draco’s chest, listening to a heartbeat at once new and familiar.
“God, you feel so good,” Harry groaned. He dropped one of his hands to palm at Draco’s erection through his trousers. Draco let out an embarrassing keen and blushed furiously at his own wantonness. Harry chuckled darkly. “Bed,” he growled, “Now.”
“I’m not going to let him hurt you,” Harry repeated, enunciating each word as clearly as he could. Draco sighed and shook his head. Still, he did not move from the circle of Harry’s arms, did not remove his hands from Harry’s waist.
“Come on, Draco,” Harry said. He stepped back to admire his work before turning a determined look on Draco. “It’s one night. And you said you were spending the morning with your mother, so your evening will be free, right?”
With his words, Draco’s form began to solidify. His feet sunk into the thick layer of dust on the floorboards, his clothes rustled as he moved, his hands began to take shape and substance. No longer could Harry see through him – there was flesh and bone before him, not a ghost but a body, real and shaking as he stood. His lips and cheeks grew pink as he stared down at himself in shock. He patted himself down, his eyes widening. Harry let out a slightly hysterical laugh.
“Is everything alright?” he asked, looking from Harry to his mother. Narcissa smiled and waved him off.
. When the mist cleared, however, Harry stood in the Forbidden Forest, in the clearing where the Death Eaters had set up camp, where Harry – Voldemort wasn’t there. He must have been in the Shrieking Shack with Nagini at this point. Draco paced at the edge of the clearing, his mother watching him as she wrung her hands. When Harry drew closer, he could see from his expression that Draco was screwing himself up to do something, a determined but anxious twist to his mouth, the crease set between his brows.
Harry came up behind Draco, who smiled as Harry wrapped his arms around his waist and kissed his neck. He leaned back into the embrace, absent-mindedly stirring the French onion soup simmering on the stove.
“I could ask Pansy if she’d invite Ginevra to her next Wine and Whinge,” he offered, glancing down at his notes to avoid Potter’s surprised look. “That would give you a night off from playing nurse to the Harpies.”
“That is very good to hear,” Narcissa was saying. “I told Draco that teaching would be a good change of pace from him, after working with St. Mungo’s all these years. I’m glad to see that you two are getting along as well, after everything.”
Malfoy gave him his little one-shoulder shrug as he chewed his bite of curry (which he had piled yogurt into because it was apparently “far too spicy, Potter, are you trying to kill me?”). “My ex and I had been together for a long time,” he said after a while. “We just… grew apart. It wasn’t a big thing, and the break up itself was quite amicable. So he gave me Amelia to sort of commemorate our time together.” He took a sip of his water, then added, “He’s in Ecuador now, working with Healers United.”
Malfoy’s laugh was hollow. “Something like that,” he said. “But it’s… fine.” He knocked his shoulder into Harry’s to let him know that really, it was fine. Harry, surprised at such casual contact, felt like his skin burned where Malfoy touched him – not like with Voldemort, but as if he had drawn too close to an open flame. He found himself pressing back, just a little, so that their arms touched. Draco really was incredibly warm – wait. He pulled away. Malfoy said nothing, and if there was a pink blush across his sharp cheekbones, neither of them mentioned it.
Draco cocked his head to one side. His hand fell away, and he leaned back, his lips pressed into a thin line as he considered Harry. “You do… want this, right?” he asked slowly.
“The data isn’t great,” she admitted, “since there are so few documented cases, but based on studies over the past couple hundred years, they’ve found a variety of ways that the bond expresses itself. In most cases, they are able to share each other’s magic, tapping into their partner’s magic when their own source is depleted and allowing them to cast incredibly strong spells together. There’s even one pair that was able to summon a conjoined Patronus to protect an entire town from a Dementor attack as recently as the first war against the Death Eaters.” She pulled out a page of notes she had tucked into the book to hold her place. Scanning it, she found the section she was looking for and highlighted it with a flick of her wand before handing it over to Draco. His brow furrowed as he read her neat but tiny handwriting.
Draco pursed his lips. “Always trying to save the world, aren’t you?” he said, only half-joking. Harry shrugged. Draco shifted onto his side and pulled Harry into his arms without really thinking about it, as if it was natural to hold Harry, as if his arms were made to fit around him like a puzzle piece. “No,” he murmured, “I had to learn the hard way. I’d been coddled all my life. Besides, I certainly didn’t need a bloody Gryffindor swooping in to save the day.” Harry snickered against his neck, his breath tickling Draco’s sensitive skin. “What about you? I’ve gone and poured out my troubles, it’s your turn.”
They climbed the stairs to their room in silence. Harry didn’t let go of Draco’s hand. Draco had just closed the door behind him when Harry crowded him up against it, his hands braced against the wood on either side of Draco’s waist, pinning him there. Draco let out a shuddering gasp, his heart in his throat. In the moonlight, Harry’s face was cast almost in shadow, the light gleaming on his glasses. Draco wanted to touch, to bury his hands in those rich black curls, to pull him closer, but he held his hands at his sides, his nails biting into his palms, still unsure. Harry leaned in, his nose brushing along Draco’s jaw, his breath warm against Draco’s trembling skin.
Draco’s brow furrowed as he puzzled on this. Belief? Faith? They weren’t foreign concepts, not after years of listening in on the priest’s sermons. But Draco had never thought to look at them in his own life, where belief and faith were twisted to fit a man’s needs rather than for guidance. He ran a hand through his hair, felt where the waves were beginning to form – he needed a haircut, but couldn’t bring himself to care, to put any energy towards it anymore. For months, all of his attention, his focus, his devotion was given to the task. He had no choice. He
“It was a nightmare,” Draco whispered, his voice thick with sleep. Harry resisted the primal urge to struggle against Draco’s arms and let himself be pulled down, his head on Draco’s chest, cheek pressed against silver silk pyjamas. “It’s okay. You’re at Hogwarts. It’s December. It’s 2008. I’m here, with you,” Draco was murmuring as he ran his fingers through Harry’s unruly hair. Harry closed his eyes, trying to relax into Draco’s touch, to listen to his voice grounding him here, now. “We’re in your bed, in your room, in Hogwarts. The war is over. We’re professors. I’m here, with you. I’m here. I got you.”
She reaches inside her robes and pulls out a small, folded piece of parchment, dark green ink stark against the page. Draco recognizes it—feels drawn by it—and has to resist reaching out to take it from her immediately. When she does hand it over to him, he decides not to open it with her here, instead placing it near his pillow.
He’s painfully reminded that he’s standing directly in front of the potions storeroom,which is a very compromising situation, especially considering that potions have been going missing.
The pieces slowly start to come together. Draco’s stomach drops. His eyes begin to sting from the stench of the potions.
“Oh, right,” he starts. “The memory specialist will be here around five. I’m staying overnight, so I’ll be here to introduce you to them.”
I know this chapter was kind of different, but I hope it was enjoyable anyways! (Also yes I know this was kind of early to post, but it's 12am where I live so it's TECHNICALLY Monday. No complaints!! Only hugs.)
“Isabelle brought me something interesting this morning,” Draco starts, always skipping right over greetings. “I think she got bored of taking
He obliges Narcissa, adding three sugar cubes, already liking it more just from its scent. He sips it, feeling the warmth of it in his chest and smiles.
The mugs are carried to the sink first, the rings on the coffee table get wiped down next, and he simply vanishes the ashes.
“Very funny,” he replies sarcastically, as Potter stands and sets the newspaper aside. He fixes Draco with a level look, and Draco can’t tell what he’s thinking at all.
uncomfortable, but he doesn’t even think that she can actually understand what’s going on. In all the time he watched her, she hasn’t spoken a word, and she’s unresponsive to the healers when they talk to her.
The room spins, the sink seems to be getting further and further away, the walls stretching and warping. His stomach turns over itself, and panic rises in him—he knows what this has to be, but he doesn’t want it to happen.
Below them, Diagon Alley fills with even more people, shouting and laughing, the sound carrying up to them. At some point, they begin to count down —
He strides across the study, footsteps pattering softly until he reaches the end of the rug, when the heels of his shoes start clicking hard on the wood. He slips his wand back into his holster and reaches for the door handle, swinging it open and stepping into the hall.
“While I can help you adjust to life without those memories and be here for emergencies, I can’t prevent further damage if I don’t know what caused it in the first place.”
They’re standing in a courtyard, a castle towering over them and the sun just beginning to rise. Rubble and debris are scattered across the space. Dust is falling. A ring of school-aged teens stand in a half-circle, bloodied and covered in dirt and sweat. A redheaded girl is sobbing, but the sound can’t be heard. Everything is muffled.
Harry and Draco are often alone together. But up here, overlooking all of Diagon Alley as Draco’s arms wind around Harry’s shoulders, it feels like this is the first time they’ve been truly alone together.
She quietly walks past him, slippers scuffing on the floor, and Draco listens to the sound softening as he nears his cubicle. He almost wants to glance back at her before pulling his curtains closed behind him, but doesn't.
Draco swallows roughly. Potter looks for all the world like this is exactly where he belongs, level-headed in the face of the crisis, guiding the others through it.
Draco goes very still, heart freezing. He blinks at the words, rereads them, not wanting to believe what she’s suggesting.
But there, on his forearm, is the Dark Mark, blurry and washed out, proof of the person he is and the wrongs he’s committed. Bile rises in his throat.
It’s all he has left, and if it’s the key to understanding what happened to him and getting revenge on the people who did it… he’ll find a way.
Draco stares at the note as though waiting for something to change,reveal more information, or restore his memories,
He glances around his study, at the roaring fire, the shadows thrown over the bookshelves and the armchairs. This evening’s tea is still on the coffee table. He’ll have to take the tray back to the kitchens later, but for now, he casts a few simple charms to do most of the cleaning. His company won’t mind.
“What’s this about no mistletoe? Tsk, where’s your holiday spirit, Harry?” a light voice floats over to their booth, and Harry freezes, eyes going wide. Neville hides his smirk with his hand, and Rosmerta gives Harry a pointed look, as if to say that it’s not too late for the mistletoe.
“I’ll pencil it in,” he says sarcastically, and Potter grimaces. Really, he wears everything on his sleeve.
Harry snorts, trying to hide it behind his hand, and evidently fails when the student starts laughing too. Neville elbows his side sharply, muttering something about
“Just making sure you’re alive,” Draco says, the note of concern still in his voice, and Harry breathes a laugh.
And it’s that realisation that makes him wonder what’s stopping him from actually saying something to Draco. From everything Neville and Rosmerta say, and from Harry’s own tentative observations on it, Draco might even feel the same.
“Draco,” Bryn starts gently. “What you’re feeling is completely understandable, and valid. Whether or not you’d hoped to regain your memories, or if you’d never wanted them at all, it’s difficult to have that option stripped from you.”
Impossibly, Potter’s lips pull into a reluctant smile. He glances at Draco, a gleam in his eye that Draco can’t pinpoint the meaning of. But Draco's mouth goes dry—Potter's eyes seem to burn—and he flushes at the eye contact. Nothing else is said between them before Potter abruptly clears his throat.
, if it wasn’t for the fact that they were arguing not five minutes ago, and Draco doesn’t understand what could possibly have turned Potter’s mood away from hostile.
“Soto,” Draco finally settles on. Potter raises his eyebrows, eyes darkening, before he sighs heavily.
“Wait!” It’s Soto, alarm and desperation and anger clear in that one word. Draco instantly feels on edge. “You can’t just
“I’ve been conflicted, truthfully. My mother sent one of my journals from when I was at Hogwarts. It was… distressing to know the kind of person I was,” he admits slowly, not meeting Bryn’s eye.
Draco’s face is illuminated by the bursting lights — his pale skin tinted red, purple, blue, green, yellow — and Harry watches the colours shift.
Harry swallowed, but refused to look away or back down. He could feel his magic crackling and sparking at his fingertips and balled his hands into fists against his thighs. The king’s eyes narrowed.
The Elves nodded, stoic expressions revealing no trace of fear or concern. The king nodded once, then turned back to Harry, who immediately rolled his shoulders back, doing his best imitation of Sirius’s power pose.
“You won’t lose yourself, not with me,” Harry murmured, his thumbs brushing away the tears slipping down Draco’s cheeks. He gave Draco a watery smile. “Besides, we both know you’re too much of an arrogant arsehole for that,” he added with a chuckle. Draco laughed softly, but there was no mirth in it. Harry pressed his lips into a thin line at that. He continued, “I’m not asking you to uproot your life and come back to Hogwarts. It’s been ten years, but I know you better than that. We can try, can’t we? Don’t you want to try to be with me? For us?”
Draco’s scowl deepened as he returned to glaring at the fire. “Potter,” he mumbled. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Blaise roll his eyes. The other boy muttered something that sounded suspiciously like, “Of course.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “It’s Muggle fiction,” he said, handing the book back with a smirk. “I’m surprised you know it, to be honest.”
“Sirius Black and my mother were cousins,” Draco explained as if it was common knowledge, and really, it should be, it was in the public record.
“Don’t worry about it,” Draco whispered, but it was no use. Harry was asleep. Draco sat there for a moment longer, transfixed. Then he got up and went back to bed.
“Have you told them about…me?” he asked, gesturing vaguely. “That I’m here, that we’ve been… that we’re…whatever this is?”
“Merlin, this couch is a health hazard,” Draco muttered. Harry ducked his head to hide his expression, which Draco suspected was because he was holding back a laugh. Draco felt a smile flash briefly across his own face. Just as quickly, though, he felt his heart stutter and sink, and the smile was gone.
“Sweet Salazar, did I really just say that?” Draco wheezed as he tried to collect himself. Harry snickered as he took off his glasses to wipe at his eyes. He cleaned the lenses with the hem of his shirt before hooking them back on with a broad grin.
The kettle whistled, it’s shriek piercing the tension in the air. Harry leaned his head back with a laugh. Draco cursed under his breath and pulled his wand out of his pocket. He waved it at the kettle so that it pulled itself off the stove and poured water into each of the cups. He moved to go and retrieve milk and sugar. Before he could, though, Harry caught hold of his arm and pulled him back.
He left without another word. He stormed downstairs, back into the drawing room, where the couples had disappeared to somewhere more private and Ginny and Luna were laying on their backs, giggling as they passed a cigarette between them. Harry walked right past them.
Harry’s hands moved, started tracing the lines of the lightning down the wings of his shoulder blades. “You never told me what happened,” he murmured.
“I am alright, thank you, Weasley,” Draco said politely. He turned to the other boys behind them with the same stiff, polite smile. “Thank you all, as well.”
Later, after an awkward dinner in the dining hall where Draco sat with Harry and Ron while his friends shot daggers at him across the hall, after they returned to their room and immediately fell into Harry’s bed, after hours of passion and tenderness, they lay together, Harry tucked into Draco’s side with his head on the other boy’s chest. Draco carded his long fingers through Harry’s hair. Harry traced patterns on Draco’s chest, his fingertips skating across snow-white skin.
Draco was twelve when he first heard it. Singing, voices lifted in a hymn, rolling over the Wiltshire fields. He had frowned and followed, ignoring his mother’s advice to stay near the grounds, to never stray too far. Down a narrow towpath, through a baffle gate and a little used dirt road overhung by trees older than memory, he found it. A simple stone building in a clearing with leaded windows and a heavy oak door, propped open to let in the gentle summer breeze. Yarrow and borage grew thick around the edges of the clearing, and the grass had begun to brown in the heat of the day. For a moment, he stood there, transported, listening to the hymn fill the clearing like birdsong. Then, he slipped in.
“I know you are.” Harry pulled away just enough to rise up on his tiptoes and give Draco a quick kiss. “We’ll be alright, though. One day at a time, okay?”
“Oh, before I forget, did you hear? Potter’s leaving the Ministry.” Pansy watched Draco’s expression as she sipped her wine, gauging his reaction to this gossip. Anyone else would have missed it – the flicker in Draco’s grey eyes, the slight tightening of his mouth, the way his fingers gripped the stem of his wine glass a little too hard.
They walked to the Gryffindor common room hand in hand, Harry chattering on about his holiday with the Weasleys at the Burrow while Draco listened with an endearing smile. His smile faltered when they stepped through the portrait hole and his gaze fell on Granger sitting in a chair by the fire, nose already buried in a book. She looked up when she heard Harry, mouth open to greet him, and froze when she saw them. She raised her eyebrows, closing her mouth when she realised it was still hanging open.
“Fine. Doesn’t mean I like the bloke. But you’re my friend, and I want you to be happy. So – and I can’t believe I’m saying this – I’ll give Malfoy a chance. Benefit of the doubt and all that.”
Harry saw a flash of white blond hair from the till. No. No, it couldn’t be. He frowned and leaned around the women in front of him who seemed to be ordering at least a dozen incredibly specific drinks. It was. Harry’s jaw dropped just as the man behind the till looked up at him.
Jenkins shook his head with wide eyes. Harry leaned in, his smile becoming a conspiratorial smirk as he lowered his voice and said, “It was me. Right after he tried to use the
“Yes, but I’m Harry Potter,” he pointed out, lips twitching. “I never had much of a choice – it’s in the job description. I can’t expect everyone else to do the same as me in any situation, because that would be ridiculous. You did the best thing you could have done. Because you escaped, we just might be able to track down whoever did it and bring them to justice.”
Harry shrugged. “I mean, it might not work out, but it’s an option,” he said, trying to wave it off even as he blushed. But Draco suddenly got up and made his way around the kitchen table to climb into Harry’s lap. “Oh, okay, hello.”
“What are godfathers for?” he asked innocently. Andromeda shook her head, but smiled down at Teddy, who was already pulling the jacket on and admiring it with glee.
The door opened, creaking on its rusted hinges, into a bedroom. There was a four poster bed that took up most of the room, faded green velvet curtains pulled back to let in the light through the window, and a marble fireplace with a wrought iron cover. The room smelled of mildew and dust, tickling Harry’s throat with each breath. And there, sitting in a wing-backed olive-coloured chair near the window, was the young man.
This one was slower, chaste at first as they let themselves relax into it. Harry’s heart bloomed inside his chest as one of Draco’s hands curled itself into his wild black curls, angling their heads better while gently pulling Harry closer. He blindly pushed his glasses up to rest on top of his head, then busied his own hands with exploring the silky touch of Draco’s hair, the narrow set of his shoulders. Then Draco licked along the seam of his lips, and his brain short-circuited.
“London’s changed you, mate,” he said. Harry raised his eyebrows at him. “You’re so… I don’t know. Quiet.”
Draco shook his head. He and Ginny shared a look, his stomach sinking as the realisation dawned on him. “No, they’re real,” he said, his voice barely audible. He thought back to History of Magic, of struggling to stay awake as Professor Binns droned on, of rolling his eyes at the time, only to read several chapters that proved Binns was telling the truth. “You see them throughout history, but they’re rare, incredibly rare, maybe once in a generation, if that. But it happened often enough that there was a law passed sometime in the 1400s, I think, that a marriage could be annulled if one of them found out their soulmate wasn’t their spouse.”
“I, uh, might have said I was bringing a friend,” said Draco. Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. Of course.
