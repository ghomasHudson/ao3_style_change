“And is it as my friend, or my superior that you’re asking me about Draco Malfoy?”
“What position do you play?”
She gave him a wavering smile.  “Thanks.  I just needed to get away.”
I’m suspicious.  “Mine?”
Draco knew his voice sounded overly formal, and inwardly cringed, but Cass merely cocked her head at him, and then turned her attention to her Dad.  “You’re sure you’re going to be okay?”
“Yeah, hilarious,” he says through gritted teeth.  “Absolutely a riot, when your wife wakes you at midnight because the tracking charm you put on your best mate’s gone off and you have to follow him through a sweaty bar.”
“Don’t…” Harry said thickly.  “Don’t be nice to me.  Breaks my heart.”
“I have so many questions.”
George thumps me on the arm, but he’s laughing, so I continue.  “I retch, completely put off by the ear, and the gingery hair everywhere, and he uses my distraction to throw a chew toy for Diane.  She can’t help herself, it’s instinct for a dog.  She’s compelled, runs after the chew toy, she’s gone.  It’s just me and him.”   I’ve noticed that a few of George’s siblings have drawn near and are listening to the story, but I continue as though it’s just him and I.  “I’m brilliant, of course.  Spells flying, I’m ducking, weaving, creating a legion of clockwork soldiers that fight him with a wave of my wand.  But alas, every hero has a weakness, and my arch enemy knows mine.  He conjures a jam tart, a thing of beauty, and levitates it my way.  I try to be strong, but I’m just a man, and my attention wavers, for just a split second.  And that’s enough,” I finish, “for the bastard to cast a spell that robs me of all of my memories.”
“On the contrary, I absolutely can.”
Then, he went through the house and completed his nighttime routine, warding each window and door, checking each burner in his lab to ensure that they were off, warding the fireproof cabinet where his potions research was kept.  He checked the floo wards, and then rechecked each window and door, passing the floos and triple-checking them one last time before turning off the gas lamps in order.
“No” he says.  “I’m meant to be here.  I can’t go through with it, Harry.  I can’t give you up.”
Then the floo chimed again, and Weasley stepped out, followed by Potter, who stumbled over the hearth and just barely missed cracking his head on the marble counter.  “Malfoy,” he said,  attempting to sound professional, his face going red.
“Maybe just a quick one,” he says, and he doesn’t even seem annoyed when he’s late.
“I don’t share, Potter.  If we continue this, there can’t be anyone else.”
“So Harry,” she finally says, after consuming a biscuit with great enthusiasm, “what changes need to take place at the Ministry?”
“Mr. Harry?” Scorpius said quietly.
Something changes in Draco’s face, and he rolls his eyes at Harry.  “I want you to remember this moment later, when I point out the irony.”
“Well we knew that we’d only have a limited amount of time in the warehouse where we set up the potions bust.  The wards kept Harry’s partner out, but not for long.  I couldn’t risk anyone finding out what we’d done.”
Lara’s statement so unnerved Draco that he flooed to his lab instead of to his living quarters.  He stood in the lab, the sterile order soothing him, and then climbed the stairs.  He could hear Harry saying, in a worried voice, “…but you’re sure he’s going to come back?”  With a little smile, Draco lingered outside the sitting room to listen.
“You lied,” he said quietly.  “You said we were friends, but you were mean.  You were mean to Ron, and Hermione, and Hagrid.”
“I was fully in charge.  I don’t think that anyone even read my reports, not that they would have cared if they had.  Uncle Wendell told me that I could do as I saw fit.”
?”  She was his oldest friend.  Harry’s heart lurches.  If he falls out with Pansy, Draco will truly have nobody.  It doesn’t cross his mind that Draco's wife-to-be might prove to be a source of comfort.
So what would the Slytherin do, when forced to accept that he’d never have what he wanted, that he would never atone for his previous sins?  For a while, Draco had no idea what the Slytherin would do, but eventually, as dawn streaked across the sky, he understood.  The Slytherin would forget about Harry.  The Slytherin would get busy making a life for himself, one that didn’t need to include something he couldn’t have.  So, Draco resolved, he had his answer.    And he would do so, as soon as he’d had a chance to regroup, find his footing again.  The Slytherin would also indulge his disappointment and hurt feelings a little.  He’d go home to his Mother.
“I…”. He rakes a hand through his hair, and it seems so incongruous with his emotionless face that I reach out to touch his other arm.  He jerks it away, and glares at me.  “Nothing.  Just listen.  Don’t interfere.”
Draco frowned.  It could be any number of things and if the fact that Draco couldn’t narrow it down didn’t tell him everything about the impossibility of their relationship…He wasn’t at all sure how to explain things to Cass, but maybe he could put it off for a while longer.  Little girls deserved to be free of nightmares like the ones that Harry lived through, and clearly, Harry felt the same way, since he hadn’t told her anything.  “And what do you think that is?”
The stress and emotion of the previous days overwhelmed Harry for a moment, and his temper rose.  “Because,” he snapped back, “she’s the most important thing in the world to me, and when you take her away, I want her to feel like someone cares about her.”
“Not at all.  Magical exhaustion, some contusions.  He’ll be fine in a few days.”
“Why not get both?”
“Get loud!”
“Yes, among other things, if they’re within your abilities.”
Something about the tilt of his pointy little face had filled Harry with such a wash of affection that he’d leapt across the room, and kissed Draco senseless.  He was so prickly!  Remembering it again, it charmed Harry so thoroughly, that he was nearly overwhelmed by love.  A glorious burst of happiness bubbled through Harry, and he wanted to laugh with how blissful he felt.  But he couldn’t laugh, he had to stay silent, or Draco would insist that he was right, and Harry didn’t know how to go to bed like a proper Wizard.
Harry looked down at his sweater.  “No hits?”
They barely look at one another as they stumble into clothing.  They both know that this is goodbye.
Draco has a look on his face that Harry’s never seen before.  He draws closer, and for a moment, Harry thinks that Draco is angry with him.  He seizes him by the arms, and gets right in Harry’s face, and for a moment, he thinks that maybe he was wrong that he and Draco were friends.  For a moment Draco looks just as he did after countless spats after Quidditch matches, and Potions classes and…oh…Draco’s lips seal on Harry’s and for a split second, Harry doesn’t think at all, so overwhelmed by sensation and the abstract notion of a key fitting into a lock perfectly, and
“Do you think that someone took my memories on purpose?”
“Thank you, Draco.  Is that why you’ve come?”
“I don’t.  Quite the opposite, really.  We weren’t friends before, but I hope we will be someday.”
“Hermione wants to speak with you.”
He gave Draco a look of such adult wryness that Draco nearly laughed.  “I know about strangers,” he said with a defiant little glare,  “and that’s what you are.”
Her grin was only the tiniest bit cocky.  “Seeker, of course.  What else could I be?”
Kreacher gives me a sly look.  “Master Malfoy is the daughter of Narcissa, and is the last remaining relative in the Black bloodline.  Were it not for the filthy traitor, Master Malfoy would have been inheriting Grimmauld Place and the Black family fortune.”
A voice had startled him from his thoughts.  “Mister Potter.”
That makes me laugh.  “Alright then, whether I’m a prat or some sort of shy weirdo, let’s take advantage of the fact that I’m not having a temper tantrum and get me kitted out properly.  Do you do Muggle clothes as well?”
“You’re right.  He doesn’t care enough to hate me.  He doesn't want me.  And I don’t know if I can forgive him.”
Scorpius regarded him for a long moment, and then gave a tiny nod.
“Harry,” Weasley said.  “Can you say ‘Kreacher’?”  Potter tilted his head for a moment and his lips moved, suggesting he was yelling, but the bubblehead prevented them from hearing the words.  Impatiently, Draco cancelled the spell, and Potter looked thoughtful before sneezing three times.  Draco cast a freshening charm while Weasley said again, “Harry, say ‘Kreacher’.”

. . . So now Draco was in the library reading Savey Insults for the Swashbuckling Rough.  Turning the page he had a blinding realization. His friends were on to something. They were right, completely right. He was going to get Potter. He was going to get Potter good. What had he been thinking before? Making fun of his refined glasses, his distinguishing scar, his messy hair you just wanted to fix. Those weren't insults. They were a cry for help. These, these were insults! This book was a Gringotts vault of sweet digs and snappy comebacks. He could see the look on Potter's face in his mind's eye; brow furrowed, soft mouth agape, his piercing green eyes filled with longing— wishing he had such good insults! A thrill of excitement went down his spine. That gryffindor won't know what hit him!
"Oh, so you did want us to make to make cover?"
Prompt L
Draco sat in the library hiding behind a book and reflecting on the failed events of that morning. . .
Covered in furs we'll snuggle tight
Let's get down an dirty while thestrals
you're a pealing paint veneer
A snitch you can't chase
"Wouldn't that be poor manners? I thought a Malfoy would have higher standards then that."
"Draco, I really like your new insults."
Gunna make you quake with delight
"And what is the hero of the wizarding world hiding from?" Draco asked sardonically.
I like to hear you scream
"Draco dear, I know I saw you. Come have a drink!"
Your messy hair drives me while,
Merlin! Your so deep-oh!
"And you're going to miss your photo opp with the Minister!"
“Not brainless,” he agrees.  “Plus, you had Granger.  She did all of your thinking for you.”
The snake, who’s been napping by the fire, lifts its head in interest.  “Do you only know yellow-haired people?”
“Thanks,” Harry replies easily.  “Do you go to Hogwarts?”
“Liquor, darling.  Don’t be silly.  Also, there’s a bit of quirkiness with the wards.  I’ll pop over about 5 of, and bring you in.”
“Cass is very curious,” Harry said, with a pointed look at his daughter, “and her curiosity occasionally leads her to making unwelcome, intrusive decisions.”
“Mmm,” Andromeda said noncommittally.  “And you’re comfortable that you can remain objective?”
Hermione hesitated.  “Are you sure, Harry?  It’s…kind of a lot.”
It wasn’t easy to floo to Scotland and back in the morning, but Draco knew that the treacle tart sold at the bakery in Hogsmeade was Harry’s favorite.  He packaged up the box, and picked up a quill.
“Huh?”
He rang the doorbell of the only house that had lights on.  A beefy man answered the door, his face harassed and red, and demanded, “What is it?”
Harry examined his robes with reverence.  “They’re beautiful,” he said, running a finger on the silver piping.  “Do I wear these every day?”
“Me too.” Blaise’s voice sounded hoarse too, as though he were also awash in emotion.  “I’m glad you’re back, Dray.”  And then, just like that, Draco was glad he was back too, in the arms of his two best friends.  They made their way to the kitchen and Draco felt himself begin to relax.
“Maybe.  But if you tell me, then I’ll stop asking you to.”
“Oh for heaven’s sake,” Hermione snaps, and I nearly snicker, because ‘for heaven’s sake’ is, frankly, a hilarious thing for a twenty-six year old woman to say.  I expect her to clutch at her pearls next, which is also a bit disconcerting, because I have no idea why pearl-clutching is a thing I’m familiar with. “We’re not going to go force you to sleep with Ginny, but Harry, three days ago, the two of you were together, and, as far as I know, you planned to get married.”
Luna smiles as they both watch Harry awkwardly dance Scorpius around.  He’s still the least coordinated dancer Draco’s ever seen, but he’s unselfconscious and laughing, and Scorpius is shrieking with glee.  “I don’t regret it,” she says, but Draco knows she does, a little.  It was good for Harry to realize that his life could be so much fuller, but it came at the cost of his trust for Luna, and Draco doesn’t think that they’ll ever get it back.
“Alright then,” I answer, and she nestles into the crook of my arm.  She is warm and snuggly, despite her many elbows and knees, and she smells faintly like a biscuit.
He storms away, and I take a minute to collect myself before leaving the cupboard.  Fuck.  Stupid old Harry.  Well, I’m going to stay the fuck out of this, that’s all I know. Cabin in the woods, here I come.
“Of course your opinion is valid, Harry, but you just don’t have all of the facts.”
Pansy arrived at six on the dot, wearing a form fitting jersey dress over dragonhide boots.  Her hair was short and spiky, and her makeup was done impeccably.  A tiny diamond stud glinted in her left nostril.  She looked a lot cooler than Harry remembered from school, and he suspected that her Pureblood parents didn’t approve of her very Muggle attire.
“The ones beyond the corridor that collapsed?”
He sets a cupcake onto the counter in front of Draco, who curses the fact that he doesn’t have a work in progress to focus on.  He looks at the cupcake instead.  It’s, frankly, a beautiful piece of confectionary.  It’s topped with a generous swirl of thick silver icing, and there are little silver stars sprinkled throughout.  The wrapping is a dark luscious green.  “Slytherin colours,” Harry says unnecessarily.  “It made me think of you.”
be with someone like you.  The joke’s over, Potter, get the fuck out of here.”
I shrug.  “I can’t imagine what I’d want to remember.  Even though I resent the hell out of her doing it without my permission, I can’t fault Hermione for thinking it would be helpful.”
“Aunt.  Is something wrong?”
“Fair point.”
“Tea?”
“It isn’t pity,” he said.  “It’s help.  Scorpius is going to be so disappointed if he doesn’t have a birthday party, and that won’t help with his control of his magic.  I have a pile of little kids that I know, who would love to make a new friend, and go to a party.  Why wouldn’t we let them have fun together?”
“Oh, of course, I should have thought of that,” he muttered.  “Harry?  Come out, it’s okay.”  He summoned his wand, and fixed the broken vials.  “See?  It’s all better.  You’re safe.  You aren’t in trouble.”  When Harry didn’t emerge, Draco kneeled and peered under the worktable.  Harry’s eyes looked so…adult, as though he’d seen this before, and knew what came next.  “Come on, wouldn’t you like some hot cocoa?  I would.”
“She’s a whore,” he says bitterly.
fault!”  Harry raised his eyebrows, but looked hurt.  “Okay, fine, Potter,” Harry’s shoulders slumped at the use of his last name.  “Harry.  This might seem a little hard to imagine, but there was a potions incident-”
“At some points in the session, Harry or I might ask you some questions directly, but unless we do so, I’d like you to try to primarily listen to what Harry is saying.  If you react strongly to what he’s telling you, we can take some time to explore it further, but where possible, this isn’t a session for you to rebut or invalidate what Harry is telling you.  Does that make sense?”
“She can, but it'll go faster if it’s me.”
“Tea,” Harry agreed vaguely, and obediently followed Draco inside.
“I can’t think of a better use for the dungeons,” Draco says, and nobody can argue with that, although I do find it a bit surprising that Draco has dungeons.  Once Wendell’s settled, Draco calls for tea, after a brief sojourn to put his son to bed (guarded by a house elf), and let his Mother know that he’s home safe.
“Mother” Draco sighed, looking into her beautiful blue eyes.  She had always been a comforting presence, soothing like a cool sip of water.  Narcissa had always understood Draco, even if she often still forced him to do things he didn’t want.  When he’d been forced to take the Mark, she’d held him as he sobbed, shed tears of her own.  He didn’t want to let her down, didn’t want to let the family down.  But he also didn’t want to marry Astoria Greengrass.  “Was it all worth nothing?”
“Oh, of course, what was I thinking?  Come, Arthur dear, you’ll catch your death out here in the damp.”  She makes it nearly to the door, but then stops.  “I don’t think we have enough clean towels!”  Her voice rises in a wail, but Hermione is by her side in an instant.
“I’m not sure that this is a time for assigning blame,” Astoria shot back.  “I, for one, am delighted to meet Cass, and I want to know all about her.  And I’m sure that Cass has questions for all of us as well.”
“Alright.  Do you want tea?”  I’m at a loss, in many ways.  I know very little of this woman, other than that she tried to hand me over to Voldemort, and that she is being forced into choices nobody should have to make.  She isn’t very friendly though, so I expect that she doesn’t like me all that much.  Which begs the question I ask next.  “Why are you here?”
“Draco!”  I’m delighted to see him.  “You came!  You saved me.”
“I can’t do tomorrow,” Scorpius said.  “Mama’s taking me to the zoo.”
“Weird bad?”
“He grew up in a cupboard.  He had a Dark Lord living in his head.  His girlfriend has been secretly potioning him,” Hermione countered.
“Pansy something,” I say.  “So do you want to go be terrifying at someone?”
“Harry isn’t, actually,” I say.  “Confused, that is.  There’s a lot of stuff I’m not sure about, but there are a good few I know for sure.  And the first one is that I’m gay.  Like, irredeemably.  You can yell at me all you like, but I’m just not going to be into fanny, even if you have a pressing desire for me to be.”  Ron and Hermione are looking a bit gobsmacked, now, and so I watch them for a bit to see what happens next.  Nothing does, and so I continue.  “And speaking of that, I’m not sure why you’re both so invested in my being hetero, but it seems a bit strange, just speaking as an outsider.”
“It wasn’t a test,” Cass said sharply, and Draco longed to correct her, to warn her that she was breaking Harry’s heart every time she rejected his attempt to connect.  “Just review with my tutor.”
“It’s true, ‘Mione.  He kept looking at the door.  Plus, he got into a spat with Parkinson.”
Any normal person would be suffused with warmth, watching two innocent babies, safe and loved, playing carefree after a good night’s sleep.  Draco watched with a terror so great he had to flee the room.
“Harry, I never thought I’d accuse you of overthinking things.” Harry has confessed the kiss to Ron, after Ron showed up with a bottle of Fire Whiskey and a vague mumbling about ‘thinking Harry could use it’.  “Also, I don’t know how I’m supposed to help you.  Hermione’s always been the one to help us sort out this sort of thing.  You know I’m pants at feelings and stuff.”
“Did Draco tell you that?  About the two of you being best friends?”
“Need to go first.” Draco had whispered.
“Fix him!” Weasley demanded.
“That’s not the point!”
“But how?” Mrs. Fortesque looks sad.  “Even if we could manage the fees, we couldn’t cover another salary.”
“I could pay you.”
“I am,” Harry says, and he rushes to his quarters, and wards the doors, and that ends his habit of seeking answers by wandering Hogwarts at night.
It was July, almost two years after they’d started dating, when Harry had begun feeling strange.  Not ill, exactly, just…weak.  His magic had begun acting funny, affecting the way that the wand wood reacted to him.  And he was exhausted, all the time.  He had dismissed it as a reaction to the heatwave that had struck, at first.  Garrick had looked concerned, told him that he should have it checked.  Once Draco and Hermione had also joined the chorus of persistent concern, Harry had made an appointment with Madame Pomphrey, who had continued treating Harry after the war.
“He’s so cute,” Cass gushed.  “I’m not sure how a jerk like Draco could have such a sweet kid.  He must take after his mum completely.”
“Well,” he finally said, “since we’re best friends, I’ll tell you, but you can’t tell anyone else.  Promise?”
“Oh Lord, Kreacher is there?”
“Well…” Hermione bites at a fingernail.  “It’s just that, in the past…I mean, generally…”
“What the fuck is going on here?” The blonde interrupts us, and the sexy smirk is gone completely, replaced by a fairly pissed-off glare.  I’m definitely not going to get to suck him off, I realize.
“So what happened, Scorpius?”
“But there are a number of other social and political factors that need to be considered,” Hermione says, and that’s when I realize that she’s going to turn this into a
“Never mind,” she said, in a feeble attempt to bolster him.  “How’s work?”
I manage to gather my thoughts enough to say, “Yeah, I need to talk to Mill.  That stupid fucker Smith threatened me, and I think he’s going to send Pansy to Azkaban to punish me.  I wasn’t going to do anything, because I’m done fighting fucking wars, but it pissed me off, and I changed my mind.”
“Now,” Harry continued, “you’re going to listen to me as I write this report and tell you about Violet, who turned one of her classmates into a newt, and then we’re going to go back to mine and listen to Spice Girls until Kreacher shouts at me.”   And she did, and they did, and the shadows didn’t disappear completely from Tamsin’s eyes, but she still did an admirable job at harmonizing as they sang ‘Stop’.
“I guess,” Draco said begrudgingly.
“At one time, I’m ashamed to say that I did.  There’s no excuse for it, none at all.  I’ll never be able to tell you how wrong I was.”
“Harry, you’re welcome to stay here until you get your feet under you,” Hermione replies, her big brown eyes searching my face.
“Robards?  Don’t make me laugh.  He’s already retired, as far as I’m concerned.  He was thrilled to have one less thing to think about.  I got him to appoint my nephew as team lead, and then it became easy.”
“I like it, most of the time.  It’s alright.” Draco’s voice was sleepy.  They lay silently for a few minutes before Draco said, “I
Draco considers.  “Bring him, I think.  He’ll give the house elves someone to fuss over.  Right now they’re all crying in the kitchen.”
“Oh Draco.” Hermione looked pained.  “I don’t know what happened between you, but…Harry was shattered when you left.  It was really terrible for a long time.  You have no idea how much you hurt him.”
“No, I think maybe your work keeps you too busy for a dog.  Why would you want a dog?”
“Can’t you get her a solicitor that’s already in England?  If your mate can’t seem to get home to help her?”
“Hello again, Potter,” Draco said.  Potter’s chubby face was suddenly wreathed in an enormous grin as he raised his arms to be picked up.  “No thank you,” Draco said politely, but firmly.  Potter’s arms bobbed for a second, and he tilted his head in confusion before letting out a huffy little sigh and lowering them.  Looking determined, he focused on extracting himself from the towel he’d been wrapped in, and set off to crawl towards Draco.
, he resolved.
“Harry, I know that the press has always been somewhat predatory about you, and that your privacy hasn’t always been well-guarded.  In the past, I believe that you’ve learned to keep a tight control on your behaviour in public, but with recent events, I think I may have been remiss in not warning you in advance.”
“What subject do you like to learn best?”
He leads me to Courtroom ten, and, really, it’s a good thing I did agree to let him come along, since I’d have had no hope of finding it on my own.  There are fifty-odd witches and wizards sitting in the risers, resplendent in plum robes.  They all look decidedly pissed off, which fills me with satisfaction, since they bloody well should be.  Kingsley looks diminished, sitting, surprisingly meekly, in an armchair in the centre of the open floor.  Draco stiffens beside me, and I look up to see Hermione and Ron in the gallery seats.  I place a hand on his arm.  The time will come to sort that situation out, but not until we’ve solved the bigger issue.  Pansy has delivered (fucking) Wendell this morning, and he is strapped into a chair beside Kingsley’s.  I notice that Zach Smith and a few other sullen-looking wizards are being guarded by Aurors in another corner.  As we sit in the witness’ section, I notice Mill in an upper seat in the Galley, and she gifts me with one of her blooming smiles.
Draco’s eyes were clouded as he looked steadily at Harry.  “He’s everything to me,” he said quietly.  “I know that I’ve done wrong in my life, Potter, I know that you have the power and the motivation to completely ruin my life.  But I know that you’re not the kind of man to play into petty revenge.  I would give up anything for Scorpius.  Please, Potter.
“That’s weird.”
“Harry, would you say that you moved away to protect your daughter?”
Draco examined Harry and Cass’ brooms as Harry unshrunk them.  They were a different design than English brooms, and Draco was eager to see how they performed.  He mounted his own broomstick and watched as Harry cast a few safety spells on his daughter.  “Daa-ad,” she moaned.  “I thought we talked about these.”
“What’s a Death Eater?”
And that’s how it transpired that Harry and Draco were left alone in the kitchen.  Draco had long ago gotten past the feeling of utter wrongness that he was in Harry’s home, and had resigned himself to drinking until his heart stopped aching so much.  It hadn’t happened yet; his heart was still clunking painfully in his chest every time Harry pushed his messy hair out of his eyes, but Draco felt that a few more drinks and it would happen.
“Where is Cass’ Mother?”
Malcolm shivered.  Harry silently cast a wandless warming charm, and, for good measure, conjured two mugs.  He reached into his pocket, extracting two sachets of hot chocolate mixture, casting an aguamenti, and a warming charm.  “Do you like hot chocolate?  I think it helps, sometimes, after a hard day.”  He took a long swallow from one of the mugs, and then held the other out.  It took a long time.  Malcolm regarded him silently.  Harry waited patiently, sipping his drink, and holding the mug out.  Finally, the child crawled into a seated position, and tentatively reached for the mug.  When he took a tentative sip, Harry smiled widely at him.  “Better?”  Malcolm shrugged.
“Harry,” Mister Fortesque starts, but I raise my hand, asking to continue.  He closes his mouth and waits.
have a dog? As a grown up?”
His chin rises for a moment, and I think he’s going to say something haughty, but instead he buries his face back into my neck, and says, “I fancied you something rotten, Harry Potter.”
Concerned that something was amiss with Harry or the baby, Draco dismissed the owl without a reply, told his Mother that he’d return shortly, and apparated back to the Tonks Cottage.  He didn’t expect that his Aunt’s floo was open to Malfoy Manor.  Feeling a sense of trepidation, Draco politely knocked on the door.
left.  And now four years had passed, and somehow Harry hadn’t married Ginny Weasley, and he hadn’t gotten his happily ever after.
“Yes.  Well, he couldn’t keep me.”
“Actually,” Harry said, "because my home has quite a bit of ambient magic in it, it can sometimes interfere with the way electricity works.”  He looked around.  “Is Mrs. Powers joining us this morning?”
“And why is it your responsibility to set me right?” Draco’s voice was shaking, damn it all.  He tried to take a deep breath without revealing to Andromeda that he was doing so.
“Yeah, maybe.  You might not though.  Somehow I managed to keep Hermione from killing me, so there’s hope for you.”
When Draco was tucking Harry in, he watched with amusement as Harry fondly patted the bedsheets before climbing inside.  “Harry, why do you like this bed so much?”
“Well, I was never going to marry her.  It was the one thing that I couldn’t give my parents.  I just couldn’t marry her.”
Harry took a moment to register the facts that:
“You don’t know what you’re saying,” Weasley said with a moan.  “Hermione is going to have questions, hundreds of them.  And then we’re going to have a fight.  And only then will she help me come up with a story before she disappears into a library to do research.  I don’t have time for all of that.”
“It won’t hold up in court.”
“We don’t have any evidence of his current actions, but he’s a Malfoy.  Surely your friends have told you about his allegiances during the War?”
“Hermione?”  She nods.
“Thanks.”
Ellen gives me a big mug of tea and a cheese butty, and I gratefully escape through the back door.  The Fortesques have a little courtyard which overlooks Knockturn Alley, and I enjoy myself watching the people bustle along and munching my sandwich.  The door opens behind me, and I turn to see Florean looking hesitant.  “Harry, there’s someone here to see you.”
Better enough, I think, to address the elephant in the room.  “So, if it’s going to take a while to get my memories back, I think I need to figure out a few things,” I say.  Hermione takes a breath, and I can tell she’s been waiting for this.  “But,” I continue, “I gather I’m not the smartest bloke around, and even I can see that my life has been…well…”
With plans finalized, Cass and Draco flooed over to the Manor.  A house elf popped in to greet them right away.  “Master Draco!” The elf was beside herself with joy.  “You is here!  And you is bringing young Mistress of the House of Malfoy!  Madame Narcissa is being in the gardens.”
I sit, surrounded by the leavings of breakfast, unsure what to do next.  I could have my memories back, if I want them.  And Draco has…feelings about that, but I’m not ready to explore them, as uncertain as I am of my own.  I finally rise, and wander, a bit aimlessly.  I find a sunroom, filled with orchids, and it’s here that I stop.  I watch a hawk glide through the sunny sky, until he spies something in the field, and swoops down.  His kill is quick, merciless, efficient.
“Oh,” she seemed surprised that he remembered.  “No, it went fine, he was never going free, he was guilty, but I got him a lesser sentence.  I just couldn’t go back to the Burrow.”
“Fine.  After all, I so enjoy hearing my friends opinions on my failings.”
“Thank you Madame,” Cass said, a little woodenly.
“I understand.” The Goblin, who is remarkably uncurious about my curse, pulls out an enormous book, which he leafs through until he reaches the ‘P’ section.  “You, Harry Potter, were the sole Heir of the Potter estate at your parents’ death in 1981, which was, obviously, held in trust for you by Albus Dumbledore until you reached your majority.  At that point, the estate was valued at nine hundred thousand Galleons.  I have been responsible for the management of the Potter estate for four generations now, and since your inheritance, the Potter holdings are, as of this morning, worth one point four million galleons.  In addition, you inherited the Black estate as the named Heir upon the death of Sirius Black III, which is currently worth around five hundred thousand Galleons.  This of course, does not include the value of the real estate holdings of the Black and Potter families.”
“That’s why I do it.”
“I hope so,” Draco said,  “but we’ll have to wait and see.”  Draco’s jitteriness manifested in a bounce in his leg, until Astoria placed a gentle hand on his knee.  He smiled gratefully at her.  She was truly his best friend, and he was so grateful to be going through this with her.
Cass’ lovely grey-green eyes flashed.  “Why should I?  For nine years, he’s been happy enough to ignore me, and now that his kid, his real kid is sick, he wants me to help him?”
“Hello,” I say pleasantly.
“It was hard for all of us, Mother.  I didn’t see how burdening you with my indiscretions would help anyone.”
“No, I mean it.  Let me help you.”
Draco finds me idly tossing the vial from one hand to another.  “What’s that?”
“Especially what?”
“Oh Draco, there is definitely something I need from you,” I purr.  He looks distinctly annoyed, and I suspect I’ve gone too far, so I walk it back a bit as I continue, “And actually, it’s strange.  Every time I ask about what’s being done to break the curse, people get uncomfortable.  They assure me that they’re working on it, but nobody’s talked to me since it happened.  I would have thought that the Ministry’s people would be doing mind-reading stuff, or casting spells on me or whatnot, but nothing.  They sent me home with Ron and Hermione, and told me that they’ll get in touch when they find something.”
Despite his efforts, they lost the game, and Draco felt discouraged as he skated off the ice.  He was bathed in sweat, and looked forward to a beer, a shower and a few hours of mindlessly watching the traffic from his balcony.  His head was down as he walked the corridor back to the locker room.
“That’s remarkable,” Draco said.  “She’s going to be incredibly powerful when she’s an adult.”
“He’s doing well,” says a voice from beside him.
“Probably not,” I reply.  “But I’m okay with that.”
“Yes, that makes sense.  Go get Ron, take my bed.  I’ll be up soon.”
To his relief, Mrs. Nott chuckled.  “Your name is quite a bit bigger than you are, lad.  We’ll see you at 11:00.  Do you think that you could do something for me in the meantime?”
I mumble a bit incoherently, but manage to find his hand and clasp it in the darkness.  Before I can say anything else, I’ve drifted off again.  This pattern repeats itself for some time, and finally, I awaken to dim pre-dawn grey, able to keep my eyes open for more than seconds at a stretch.
“He was embarrassed when the reporter called him that name.  He didn’t make a face or anything, but his ears got pink.  Then, when you attacked the reporter, he didn’t look mad, exactly, but he and Astoria and Scorpius left right away.  Maybe he’s the sort of person who gets mad later.”
So, even after he’d eliminated the possibility that Harry had been mocking his sexuality, he dismissed Harry’s constant come-ons.  Harry had grown into his fame better, that was all, and he’d learned that flattery and charm worked far better to manage people than scowls and furious bursts of temper.  It was…nearly Slytherin of him, and, while grudgingly impressed, Draco was content that Harry treated him just like everyone else.
“Yes.  I’m not sure I trust her to poke about in my mind again, even if I did want them back.”
I’m not really sure what he means, but asking questions will prompt one of those ‘poor simple Potter’ looks, so I merely nod.  “It doesn’t really matter anyway,” I say finally.  “I’m different now, it seems, but I don’t think it’s a bad thing.  Old me seemed completely fu-” I catch myself just in time as Narcissa raises an eyebrow at my language, “....messed up.  Who wouldn’t want a clean slate if they’d had the sort of life I have?”
After the bonding, he stands to give his speech, straightens his robes, and smiles at the assembled crowd.  Their friends take up two large tables, and they holler their support as he clears his throat.  “We’re here tonight to celebrate two people who love fiercely, even when loving anything at all seems like a futile gesture.  I won’t bore you all with how I was lucky enough to befriend them, as I’ve been told that battles with Mountain Trolls are impolite conversations for the dinner table. Instead, I’ll simply say that recent years have found us all in need of a little hope, and I’ll draw your attention to the best example of that I can think of.”  He makes eye contact with them both.  Hermione is weeping openly, her beautiful face aglow with emotion and love.  Ron draws her closer, kisses her cheek, wipes away her tears.  “Ron and Hermione, you made me a part of a family, something I never dreamed I could have.  We’ve been at one another’s side through all sorts of adventures, and I’m so pleased and grateful that I get to be the first to wish you luck and good fortune as you begin this next one.  To Ron and Hermione!”  As champagne glasses tinkle around him like raindrops on a roof, Harry catches McGonagall’s eye.  She nods approvingly at him, and Harry winks back at her.
“I…um, I was hoping that I could commission a piece of your work,” Harry says suddenly.
“I did,” Harry said cautiously, “but maybe I’ve had a bit of a change of heart.  I feel like your Papa and I are getting along better now.  Speaking of, I should go and make sure Papa is okay with you being here for a bit.”
“Relax, Ronald.  I invited him.  He’s drinking gin, and behaving himself nicely.  Wouldn’t you like to drink gin and behave nicely as well?”  Pansy was grinning at Weasley, but the look in her eyes was a little feral.  Draco had seen that look before, once, as children at the Manor, when a peacock had taken Pansy's sandwich.  Draco had had a terrible time explaining to his Father why they had one fewer peacock.
“Not ‘specially.  My best friend is Damien.”
“You’re sorry?”
“Well, your arse looks like two bludgers in a sack, and you’re not eight months pregnant,” Harry said, a little bite to his voice.  Ron feigned offence, but then laughed, and hugged his best mate.  Harry normally took the ribbing with good humour, but he’d outgrown his last set of magically expanded jeans the week prior, and was a little sensitive.
“I’m not sure.”  Harry carefully picked the offending fish off, and set them on his plate.
“You go, then.  I’ll stay with Scorpius.”
To see the wizard hero standing there
"What? What does that mean?" Draco was slightly alarmed. He nervously wiped his hand on his trousers. should he be insulted or . . .? Harry was stepping closer to him. Draco wouldn't go down without a fight. He should probably insult him again.
We won't get any sleep tonight.
On broomstick we'll fly
"Better hurry, Draco, you'll miss your chance to sit next to Finch-Fletchley."
"If I'd know that's all it took to shut you up I would have done it sooner." said The Boy He'd Had a Crush On For Seven Years.
"Oh . . er . . I would love to, Justin, but you see, I came here with someone. And it would be terrible rude to abandon them." Damn, he was out of practice. Deflecting and redirecting social situations used to come so naturally. Now he sounded like a bumbling idiot.
Won't you tell me you're kink ( I think we're so in sync)
Your licks and strokes feel so divine
You can count on me
Nice try Potter but my are better.
but when he looks me in the eyes
No need to play coy ( I like your sex toy)
In between the sheets-oh!
Don't stop until the morning time
He was already that way. I just put a silencing charm on him.
So, I didn't get to finish my poem for you yesterday.
"Paramore?" Harry chuckled "Draco, what's going on here? Do you even know what you're saying?"
I'm going to jinx him.
As you hold me tight we both know
Just writing lines in detention. I think we got off easy.
You have all the tender sweetness of a blast ended skrewt
Did you rhyme 'us' with 'us'?
Everybody knows it's better when you take it slow
I'll hold you in my arms all this frosty night
(You're bitting sends my heart whirling)
Or  a sex swing
"No!" Draco knew the panic was etched in his face and he hated himself for it. "What are you doing here anyway, Potter?"
Just tell me what to bring
Are you familiar with the song 'Baby it's Cold Outside'?
Prompt C
Shout out to AnxiousGoat for spitballing me through some writers block!

"Poor manners? No, no, you see I simply have a more pressing social contract to uphold."
Let's go all the way!
"Draco they're not funny." Said Greg
Oh bae won't you hold me down
"I didn't need saving."
nauseating.
Only one way you're going to hear that.
Mr. Filch,
(Carol of the bells)
You're so sappy, Potter.
I can see me now, stripped down in glory
Oh Draco the Sytherin
I know you hated the Weasley at first glance
Thank you for reading!
I'm not going to charm the Weasel King!
You feel like ecstasy
(You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch)
Draco almost smiled. The sound of scraping chairs and clinking dinner ware could now be heard. Dread filled the tight garland-adored alcove. The moments ticked away and neither companion made a move but to shift their stance in unease.
Exactly! so I'm going to re-write them into something wholesome.
"Terrified."
Draco the sytherin was a clever, sinful, snake
But only in your dreams
You're reading this poem and what do you hear?
Draco meandered the edges of the room  accompanied only by his drink and self-pity. He couldn't find Pansy. He just wanted someone to talk to, to maybe make the evening bearable. Plenty of familiar faces, however no one was willing to engage him in conversation. The venue had a large center room flanked on either side by a series of hall way and alcoves that broke off a regular intervals. The space was decorated with exhortation amount of greenery wrapped in flashing rainbow-colored lights. The results was
Draco cringed in panic he backed up farther in to the alcove. "Ouch."
You better not brake his heart
Grunts tumble out with no restrain
Gryffindor will win
Prompt Y
Did fall in love that day
"Oh, and what's that?"
Now that we agree let's get our kink on
Dear Draco,
I've got last minute practice tonight. So I won't see you but I'll leave you this to ponder.
Your hair was a mess, your clothes so cheap
What happiness befalls me
When you see me you let out an audible gasp.
Please?
That's the easy thing to do
"I know this will be one magical night!"
“Well, her technique is all wrong,” Draco couldn’t resist saying.  “These cauldrons show signs of cross contamination, and I think she’s omitted the Grains of Paradise completely.  It’s lucky that all she did was make him little.  At any rate, at least I know what recipe she was trying to follow.”
“No, he was a Muggle, as far as I know.  Why?”
She glares at me for a moment, and then says, “No.  Of course I wouldn’t feel okay about it.”  She rattles off rapid-fire instructions for Ron to go fetch Molly to watch Rose, and disappears in search of some books she thinks will help.
“You’re very stubborn, you know?”
“Yes, it’s all
“Fertility charm.  I hope that whatever freakish magic you did took out that entire lab, Potter.  Otherwise, I’m going to kill that fucker myself.”
“Where have you been?”
The restaurant that Hermione chose was Wizard, but Draco was grateful to see her sitting in a secluded booth near the back.  He slid into the bench seat across from her and returned her smile a bit tentatively.  So much rode on this, and Draco had never been good at playing nice.  There was so much history between this Draco and woman and her two friends, and it set Draco on edge.
and how that’s going to change things in the next moment.  It’s like a reminder to ourselves that right this second, we’re good.”
“As you wish,” she says.
“Yes,” Draco said, a little bitterly.  “Passed down because Astoria and I both share a genetic anomaly.  Ironic, really, that for all my Father’s muttering about breeding, I fathered a child with a Pureblooded witch, and we’re still managing to kill him.”
Everything was different here.  She found herself wishing that her Dad’s parents were still alive, or that he had a brother or sister.  Someone who knew him as well as she did, someone who was familiar.  She wondered if this is what it had been like for her Dad, growing up.  She knew that he wasn’t on speaking terms with the Aunt and Uncle who raised him, but didn’t know why, only that they weren’t magical, and it had caused distance.  Had her Dad felt like this?  As though he were apart from everyone else?
“Dad sent him to Hogwarts.  He died, a few years ago.  It was the first time that Dad seriously considered coming back, but Uncle Professor told him to take his bleeding heart sentiments out to the shop and stop moping around.”
“You need to leave this thing with the Slytherins alone.”  He isn’t meeting my eyes.
Returning the file was easy, although the fellow in the Auror Administration Office gives me the willies.  He watches me with a hungry, acquisitive air.  I purposely keep the small talk small, and Mill and I escape painlessly.  As I say goodbye to her, it occurs to me that this society is completely fucked up.  I might be better off just going and living in some cabin in the woods somewhere.
“Of course you didn’t,” Harry soothed.  “What’s your name?”
“We got an anonymous tip about a potions buy from a group of smugglers we’ve been tracking.  We were doing surveillance outside the warehouse where the buy was supposed to go down.  It was all just a routine day, when you pulled something out of your pocket and looked at it, got a look on your face like your baby was on fire or something, and you just took off running inside.  I followed you, but the minute I crossed the threshold, the wards popped me back out onto the pavement, and I couldn’t get in.  I called for backup, and threw every spell I know at the wards, but they wouldn’t fall.  Then, a half hour later, just as backup finally arrived, the wards came down, and we found you inside, unconscious, all alone.”
“No idea.  I’ve been told I have a certain sort of dumb luck.”
“It wasn’t just that.  My Father…wasn’t coping well with prison.  I visited him each week, and he seemed less and less stable, each time I saw him.  He was dying in front of my eyes, week by week.  And he was fixated upon restoring our name.  He was so filled with regret for how he’d let the family down, all he wanted was something to hope for.”
After they leave, he settles Rosie in the rocker on his lap with Beetle the Bard.  The old stories comfort him, and he always reads ‘The Three Brothers’ first.  The little girl’s eyes eventually close, and Harry settles her in her cot, awash with love, and fighting the feeling of being on the outside looking in.
“Freud thought that much of mental life happens beneath our awareness, and that past experiences, especially in early childhood, shape how a person feels and behaves throughout life,” Draco says.
“Pretty fucking spectacular,” Draco supplied.  Harry was laying boneless and sated, but mustered up the energy to life his head and kiss Draco deeply.
There didn’t seem much more to say.  Somehow during the telling of the story, they’d sat on the floor, leaning against the foot of the bed, not looking at one another.  Draco sat silently, finally unburdened of the terrible reasons that had chased him halfway across the world.  He felt empty.  It didn’t fucking matter.  Harry knew now, that Draco hadn’t wanted to leave, but Draco
“Right.  But, like, what would I do?”
“Gin’s the only one with opportunity,” Hermione said.  “Can we test your tincture now?”
“He’s…he’s not okay.  He won’t tell anyone where he’s going, but he’s leaving tonight.  I just got finished trying to talk him out of it, but if he won’t listen to Hermione and Ron, or Andromeda, he’s not going to listen to me.”
“You’re dumb,” she said, gripping the cuff of his long sleeved henley.  She played with the fabric, rubbing her thumb along the texture, just as she’d done as a baby.
“That’s a downside to being a parent.”
“Why would you think that I’d do that?”  He kept his voice gentle.
Of course it would be raining on the day that they laid his Mother to rest in the Malfoy tomb.  Standing in the gardens, his dress robes uncomfortable and awkward feeling, Draco laid the white orchids in his mother’s hands.  The officiant wrapped the shroud around her body, and floated her into the tomb.  As the Latin incantations flowed over him like water, Draco felt desolate.  There was no age limit on feeling like an orphan, he realized.  He had no family now.  Standing straight, the years of training making his posture rote behaviour, Draco’s face reflected nothing.  He’d get through this, he told himself.  Then he’d pack some shit up, free the elves, maybe set fire to the fucking Manor, and then be back in Canada in a day.
.  It wasn’t as though she had any right to be upset with him.
His temper is rising, and I don’t know why it fills me with glee, but I keep my expression neutral.  “For fuck’s sake, Harry, I’m not just your employer.  I’ve considered myself your friend for quite some time now.”
Draco did look.  Harry sat pressed against the wall in the corner.  He seemed determined to take up as little space as possible, and his wide green eyes watched them warily.  He had been almost completely silent the entire time he’d been in the lab, and only acted when compelled to do.  He was a lot different from his baby self.  “I suppose it’s possible.  It’s not like we can just go walking up to their door and ask them, though.  I don’t even know how we’d find them.”
This time, his tears were a lot more plentiful, and he wept into Hank’s back for several minutes, his shoulders shaking and his pain so tangible that Draco felt tears sliding down his own cheeks.  He stayed where he was, uncomfortably perched on the edge of the sofa, desperate to reach out and take Harry into his arms, but a glance at Miriam warned him not to interfere.  He clenched his fists, feeling his nails biting into the skin of his palms.
“I think that must have been the second worst thing that happened to Dad.”
“I was stupid, was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Stumbled upon a Death Eater who had escaped after the final battle, and bore a bit of a grudge for my family’s neutrality.”  She lifts her chin.  “I don’t regret it, though, not for a single second.”
“Alright.  I guess if anyone asks, I can say that we’re trying to help you remember things.”
“Let’s go,” Harry says.
“Dray, we were waiting for you.  Beer?”
“But you don’t know that.  You know, that’s the thing I never expected about being a parent.  I think it’s fair to say that I’ve lived through some pretty scary things in my life, but I was so unprepared for how fucking terrifying it is to have this tiny, helpless little person who depended on me totally.”  Harry ran a hand through his hair, a gesture so reminiscent of him in his Hogwarts days that Draco was instantly taken back.  He remembered vividly the way he'd chased Harry's attention, how seeing his eyes light up with anger had fueled him on to greater heights of prattishness.  He
“Long time.  Is Scorpius okay?”  Draco’s grey eyes, (and how could Harry have not remembered those eyes?), were filled with fear.  He looked good, Harry realized.  He was still lean, but he was nearly a head taller than Harry was.  He’d stopped doing unnatural things to make his hair all sticky and slicked back, and a little shock of it fell over one eyebrow.  He was wearing Muggle clothes, Harry realized, and he found himself bemusedly approving of the way Malfoy’s legs looked in the slim trousers.
“I think so.  Will you write me?”
“And I’ve never been any good at doing the smart thing when it comes to Harry,” Draco admitted, honesty winning over any artifice.
“Arthur, I told you not to answer the door when you’ve been into that elven wine,” a scolding voice said from behind Mister Weasley.  He looked momentarily shamefaced before beaming at Draco, and patting him soundly on the shoulder.  Mrs. Weasley shooed him back into the house before regarding Draco.  “Hello there, dear.  It’s nice to see you again.”
Cass waited for him to elaborate, but he didn’t.  She sighed.  This was frustrating.  It was like learning a new language.  “I’m not sure if he even asked you if it was alright.  If I could stay here for a while.”
Tamsin looked enraged, but allowed Harry to pull her to his office.  She spent the next ten minutes ranting about the size of Nettle’s cock, his beady little eyes, and what an enormous waste of space he was.  Harry made soothing noises, finished the bun, and reviewed his schedule for the day.
“And what gave you the right to penalize these members of our society?”
“Well, she shouldn’t be so interested in my blood,” Scorpius replied, a little imperiously.  “Can I be done?”
, the mind voice instructed.  Yes, right, good.  He returned to Draco’s office, and collapsed into the desk chair.
“We had an agreement.”
I end up at Diagon again, because, frankly, I don’t really
“Alright Potter, since you’re all dressed up, let’s see if we can find something to feed you,” Draco said, and after some fierce negotiation with himself, gingerly lifted the baby.  Kreacher had thoughtfully left dinner, a perfectly done steak for Draco, and a series of bowls of mushy puree for Potter, all under a warming charm.  With only a fleeting thought for his damask chairs, Draco entered the dining room, the food floating obediently behind him.  In the end, he was unable to risk the priceless silk chairs, and so he returned to the kitchen, food trailing behind, and transfigured one of the serviceable stools into a makeshift highchair.  Potter, it seemed, wanted nothing to do with the chair, and persisted in struggling and climbing out of the chair, until a sticking charm secured his bottom to the seat.  He howled in frustration as his rear end resisted his efforts, and registered his dismay by spitting out every mouthful Draco attempted to deposit.
She regards him over her spectacles for a long moment, as the tea pours itself, and biscuits appear on a plate.  Her gaze is appraising, but not unkind.  “I assume,” she says finally, “that you’re here to discuss some unwanted visitors and solicitations?”  He nods, and her gaze continues, unwavering.  She’s sizing him up in much the same way she did when he was eleven.  She seems to realize something, perhaps that this is a test of her loyalty to him.  Will she decide for him, the way that Dumbledore did when he was a child, or that his friends have, now that he’s an adult?  Her smile is gentle, as she says, “The owls are easy.  We already have wards that prevent those who don’t know you from sending correspondence.  The spell can be extended to include those who do.”
One of the things that Draco had noticed about seven-year-old Harry was how slow he was to smile.  It was markedly different from how he’d been when a baby, when his mouth had eagerly grinned, widely, toothlessly, at everyone around him.  At seven, rather than flashing across his face like lightning, as they did in his adult form, Harry’s smiles started with his eyes.  They crinkled a little at the edges, and then one corner of his lip would curl, followed by the other.  These smiles were tentative, and shy, and gave the impression that he hoped no one would notice them. It was like watching the dawn break over the horizon, and, when Harry gifted him with a slowly blooming smile then, Draco felt a strange prickling in his throat.  “I’m fine, Draco,” Harry said, and Draco smiled back at him.
Fortunately, Harry returned with a sleepy-looking baby, who had an untidy mop of cerulean coloured hair. “Draco, meet Teddy Lupin.”
“Oh, yes of course, and then you go home and you and your girlfriend laugh at me.  So funny, let’s humiliate the poof, the
“It’s sound,” Hermione snaps.
Harry smiles, and it’s the most unbearably sad thing Draco has ever seen.  “But Draco, I
“Legilimens.”
“Right,” George said, “Wands at the ready, my darlings,” and he stepped forward and opened the door.  They crept inside and peered around the corner, where a small sitting room lay.  Draco cast a wordless disillusionment charm on them all, just to be on the safe side.  Hermione nodded her approval.
“Well, about that…That’s where the potential conflict comes in.”
dad had with him as well.”
“Despite your unbelievably clear signal, I’m afraid I was at a loss as to what you wanted,” Draco said, and Harry laughed once more.  Draco thought that nothing had ever made him happier than to hear Harry laughing like this, and then Harry stood on his tiptoes, and his lips pressed against Draco’s again.  As he wound his fingers into Harry’s hair, Harry’s tongue questingly traced the line of his lips, Draco opened his mouth, and as the kiss deepened, Draco realized that he was wrong.  That happiness was a virtually uncharted expanse lying ahead of him, with Harry at his side.
I nod.  “I don’t want to be alone tonight, Draco.  Can you come home with me?”
“My Dragon,” his Mother’s voice surprised him.
Draco looked a bit relieved, but he still cast an anxious glance toward the kitchen.  “What happens now?”
“Alright.”  Harry was pleased with how rational he sounded.  He also thought he deserved particular praise for not falling to the floor and begging Draco not to take his daughter away.
“What did they do?”
“So then why are you pushing this so hard?  Why don’t you trust me to make my own decisions?”
“I was the parent who carried and delivered Cass.”  The murmurs gave way to gasps and exclamations of shock.  Harry took a breath and kept his eyes fixed on Cass.  He didn’t want to look at the reporters gathered, didn’t want to see the looks on their faces.  He was pretty sure that Pansy wouldn't let them get away with calling him a freak to his face, but he didn’t want to see them thinking it either.
“Actually,” I say, “I’m not going back.”
“No, probably not.  I think that Draco was sort of like an asteroid.  When you’re sitting there, looking up at the night sky, and suddenly you see this brilliant shooting star, it’s wonderful, you know?  And you feel so lucky to have seen it, like it’s a special gift from the heavens, just for you.  And it burns out quickly, of course, and it’s gone, but you don’t feel sad that it’s over, you focus on how amazing it was while you saw it.”
“Would you like to talk about it?”
Draco steadfastly ignored the voice clamoring in his brain to warn him about what might happen to someone if the coffee pot wasn’t clean.  “Sure, if you like.  I’m just going to go tidy myself up a little.”
“I suppose,” Draco says, but continues, “but I miss the way that you used to glare across a room at me.”
Finite.
“Thanks for having us.”  Harry looked around.  “Where did Cass go?”
“How can you?” Ron gestures to the window.  The owl has fucked off.
“Yes, little duck, I’m fine.”
“Yes?”  I’m still not understanding this reaction.
“Next time,” Draco promised, even as a sick feeling in his stomach reminded him that there likely wouldn’t be a next time.
Despite the lack of conversation, caring for a concussed snake takes up a surprising amount of time, and so Harry’s tired when he climbs the stairs and crawls into his bed.  It’s a different bed than the one he shared with Draco, and it feels lonely and impersonal.  Harry sighs as he snuggles beneath the duvet.
, my brain supplies joyfully, and I desperately, furiously, command it to shut UP about the fucking horses. He’s…hopeful, or something, though, and I sense there’s a part of him that sort of wants to believe that I’m not making fun of him.  But it’s clearly a huge gamble.  I calmly look him straight in the eyes, and wait for his answer.
“Dad, I’m sure-”
After we’ve eaten, and Rose has disappeared to play somewhere, Ron and Hermione look at me expectantly.  I manfully avoid groaning, and meet their eyes.  “Harry,” Hermione says, and there’s something in her tone, something that makes me bristle with annoyance.  “We need to talk about what happened last night.”
“Have you always been this easy-going?”
Harry tugged on one of Cass’ curls as she bounced through the living room.  “Got a second?”
Louise grins and opens the gate beside the counter for me to enter.  She leads me back into a large industrial kitchen.  “Mama, do you know Harry?”
Harry opened his mouth, sat there gaping for a moment, as if trying to think what he should say.
The reply she awoke to was heartening, if short:
“Potter, you’ve grown up!” Her smile was sharp, but genuine, and Harry found himself grinning back.  “I was surprised to hear from Hermione.”
“That’s nice,” Luna had said easily.
“No,” she says.  She must see something in my face, because she says, “I’ve been a bit busy, Harry.  I do have a family, and a full-time job as well as helping you.”
“That’s unbelievably patronizing,” I say.
And then they danced around the room, whooping and cheering, and Hermione flung her arms around him.  Draco stilled, his entire body tense.  “I’m so sorry,” Hermione said immediately.  “I forgot.”
“But didn’t Hermione already try that?”
“A girlfriend!” Molly cried.
“I need to shower.”
“That’s Cass,” Harry said with a shrug.  “She goes with her gut, and she instinctively knows when to trust people.  It also doesn’t hurt that she knows that they’ve been the only family I ever had, except for Minerva.”
There’s a tired-looking woman standing in front of an enormous mixer, adding a giant vat of cream.  “Mister Potter!  It’s nice to see you!”
Miriam grinned.  “Nice try.  I don’t think it’s going to be easy either, but I think it will be so illustrative for you.  I’d like you to imagine, for a moment, that there was nothing at all that would prevent you from getting what you’d most like in life.”
“No, no, I’d like to.  I just can’t figure out why you’d want to be nice to me.”
“Isn’t Hermione my friend?  And Ron?  I’m sure they’d know how to reach them.”
“It’s okay,” Harry says, giving him a hug.  “Cast a quick silencing charm, will you, mate?”
A throat clearing at the door had both of them startling, and Ron grinned.  “I never thought I’d see the two biggest swots from Hogwarts, Gryffindor and Slytherin, heads bent over the same book and not bickering about it.  Look at all our personal growth!”
He nodded.  “I tell them that Papa looks like
“Dunno,” I deflect.  “Maybe she’s taking on a new pet project.”
“No, Harry.”  Something in the tone of Draco’s voice had frightened Harry, and he had stopped fussing and looked up at him.  Tears were shining in his grey eyes, and he said, “We have to end this.”
I smile, and my long-ignored emotions are painful.  “
Dear, Harry
"Eh fine. But you better fucking use a silencing charm" Ron begrudgingly grabbed his pillow and comforter and sulked out the door. As Ron left he continued reading the letter moving to the window.
When we've done our passionate throws
What's that?
No one will will hear us if we do it quick
It's the most wonderful feeling, my dear
On the night before Christmas
Harry dropped the letter to pulls him through the window and straight into an embrace.
Harry dropped his arm, turning to face Draco. His brilliantly green eye swept over the man.
I here you exclaim as I come into sight
You'll come in last place
"Ron I need the room tonight"
"You Potter are the jammiest bits of jam! A blunderbuss, a fobbing lobcock! A pribbling peerless paramore! An unlocked cub! You're a wag and an apoplolly bellibone!"
(O Christmas Tree)
He'll know just how to use
It was probably Dumby.
"Shut up Potter I'm snogging you." He said diving in for seconds.
Dear Potter,
As I slowly take off all your clothes
Are you saying I'm not lovable?
Prompt T
Prompt Q
I'll be there for Christmas
Some ointment and a letter expressing himself
It's Christmas time in Hogsmead
a cock ring
And so I obsessed both day and night
I'll puch you in the chin
"Scared, Potter?"
"Everyone," he said with such sincerity it caught Draco off guard.
You're such a tease. Have fun at practice and wear some mittens.
You really are a sleaze
Vincent shrugged and grabbed Greg's hand."He'll figure it out eventually." Said Greg
When you come, it's ahw
" I . . . What. . . That's not. . . Merlin Crabbe, Ever since you and Greg got together you think you're some kind of love expert." Draco stormed off at a dignified pass.
(Where are you Christmas?)
That Draco my dearest, I will still love you
Thanks you all for reading! It's been fun!
Named the boy who lived, the savior of light
Sounds like a challenge. If you want to cream me just ask, ; ) it still won't help your Quidditch game.
Draco barely managed to hide his surprise at the words.
Oh what fun to pork you when we're rolling in the hay! Say!
Ya got me feeling so insane
Away in a stairwell no time for a bed
Do you want me to jinx him silence for you?
Only a Harry Potter prick will do
For when I kissed him on the lips
Prompt H
Prompt J
Pass it to Granger when you're done admiring my poetry.
My affections, for you I truly adore
No Severus Snape
When you unblindfold my eyes
You ho ho ho
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Harry the Scarhead Potter
Dear Draco,
Or beging on my knees
Your fingers strech down to find your pleasure
oh on your knees
He was down on both his knees!
Let's do it in the snow
"Potter, there you are. I've got some words to say to you!" Draco composed himself and put on his best sneer.
In stairwells
This evening has been
Oh on your knees
Where you reach out to grasp my delicate hand.
I grab my broom and mount to the sky
Is captured in my mind, a perfect still frame
He was one promiscuous rake
The world spined and Draco's mouth went dry at the realization of what his friends had actually been trying to tell him that morning. All thoses years of teases and taunts, he didn't need better insults. He needed Harry Potter.
Pa rum pa bum bum
Kiss and tell
He can take me in the back door
"I hope you'll do more then look." Draco said pulling him in for a passionate kiss.
“A part of preserving that overall image, however, is the way you conduct your personal life, and the company you keep.  I know that most people, myself included, expected you and young Miss Weasley to be married, and I have to say, Harry, politically speaking, you couldn’t pick a better match.  She and her family are widely respected, and their actions during the War have been completely above reproach.”
