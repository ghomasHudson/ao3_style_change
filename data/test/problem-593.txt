– Ginny, you shouldn't...
– WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?!!! – he screamed furiously.
Severus observed the three occupants of the room and turned to Harry.
He went in and looked around, in the background were the first years. He went on his way to
His pain was so great that he was unaware of his magic pouring itself free until he felt himself being violently shaken by the shoulders, but he didn’t react until he heard his name being shouted in despair.
"I'll go with you to the library and then I'll go to the Mansion, I need to take a shower and change my clothes," he added looking at Potter– we'll talk later. You must rest first.
“Good Dobby, I think it's best if you return now. I don’t want those two to be left alone too much and if something were to happen let me know immediately. And tell Kreacher that I entrust Draco to his care.  – he said while looking at him.
Voldemort reread that damn letter for the third time and frowned more and more. He was too frustrated by the content of it and above all because he had not found its author despite having tried all the enchantments and spells he knew and that only confused him even more since the only way that the magic signature was not recognized was because his owner was already dead, but if that were so, then how come it came to him?
"That our little sister is missing a screw and that something is wrong with our future in law – he smirked.
He didn't know how to feel, there was a swirl of feelings inside him and he didn't know which one dominated over the others. He was delighted to learn that he had a son, sad at his possible rejection, melancholic remembering James and thinking about all that was lost from the lives of the only two people who would be important to him.
– I-I don't know, but...i-its. v-very ..p-painful – he managed to say with his voice laced with pain – make it stop Severus – he said stuttering.
Harry looked at the portrait and immediately recognized it. It looked pretty much like the statue there was in the Chamber of Secrets.
He buried his nose in the brunette’s neck while he in turn clung to his arms. After a few minutes, they were both asleep.
Voldemort saw the disgust reflected in the boy's features and stopped his hand. Any other time he wouldn't have cared, and he'd even have done it just to torture him, but, seeing that boy who had the same age as James’s son look at him with disgust made him think that when he had his rendezvous with Potter, he wouldn’t only be afraid but be disgusted as well. He couldn’t begin to explain why that mattered to him. He lowered his hand and walked around him with small steps, analyzing him.
Sirius was divided, he did not want to lose the affection of his little Prongs, but he was also relieved to see that the Dark Lord loved his godson. Harry had him tangled around his little finger. He and James will definitely end up taming him.
Harry watched him annoyed by the insult, but he didn't take the jab, instead, he decided to annoy him.
Harry nodded blushing.
“Yes, I thought so too. I just hope it doesn't go the other way and ends up convincing Harry to go back to Gryffindor.”
“Draco!”  he exclaimed cheerfully hugging the boy.
"And now I want you immediately in the library, you and I have to talk," he said, letting go of the two men with a wand movement and turning around—ah by the way...—he shakes his wand and to everyone’s surprise, Harry was left fully naked. – That will teach you to respect me, young man, I will not tolerate that you speak to me with that tone. Oh, and you are grounded.
"No Harry, this is the point of no return – Fred said – and if we cannot stay with you we will just go someplace else if it's necessary.
– The one I’m sure you fell in love with – Harry taunted. He saw his father's grimace and leaped with joy– I knew it! – he screamed laughing, but then looked at him seriously. – Do you still love him? – he asked with uncertainty.
Malfoy was so focused on his reading that he gave a little cry not very dignified for a Malfoy when Dobby appeared inside the room with a snap.
When he arrived at the brunette's room he opened slowly and was shocked for a few minutes before the scene that received him.
"Harry, I'm Harry—he saw Tom raise his eyebrow and he hastened to explain—I like Harry more than Potter. Besides, why doesn't my scar hurt now? – he asked by scratching on the scar.
– That's why you'll be the first to know...
"Well, Harry...
The blonde listened to Harry’s calm breath and thought he should get up, but Potter's warmth was nice as was the feeling of his body in his arms, so he decided it wouldn't hurt to stay a while longer.
– Do you mean Sirius Black? But he's...
Remus read the letter and his eyes were moistened to see the state Harry was in over Sirius' death. He felt bad to see Harry feel so alone and hadn't gotten over what he had been through, that letter full of tears witnessed his suffering.
Harry took them, surprised that they sure of leaving their family. He then rose, followed by the twins, and without warning, he hugged them both trying to convey all the gratitude he felt towards them.
– You’re right – Sirius kissed him on the lips gently before retreating to the closet to look for his clothes.
Right on target. Sometimes Potter's reactions could be read like an open book.
When Sirius and Remus left the pensieve their expression was one of resignation that changed to one of disbelief when they saw the Malfoy heir pampering a sleeping Harry Potter. They felt so out of place that they decided to point out to the boy that they had already returned. They both cleared their throats a couple of times, surprising the blonde who gave a small jump.
"For your sake, Mr. Malfoy, I hope you didn't hurt Potter, or I'll have to punish you the way you deserve – he whispered dangerously.
– Excuse me, I'm looking for Griphook– he asked in a neutral voice, although inside he was very nervous.
Half an hour later Harry had sent two letters, one for Remus and Sirius and the other for his father.
"Alright, that's enough of this show," he said, staring seriously at everyone, "I came to see Potter not any of you.
–Harry! – Hermione threw himself into his arms – how nice to see you, I hope you haven't been mistreated by your uncles.
He knew the day would come, but he didn't feel ready to face the consequences. Being honest with himself he was afraid to come face to face with Harry now that he sure already knew the whole truth, but he was also afraid to know the identity of Harry's real father, his instinct was telling him there would be problems.
"I was explaining to the hat my new choice and he agreed to resort me," he said innocently.
He walked into the room he shared with the boys and almost immediately regretted it. Ron and Hermione waited for him with their arms in indignant attitude in front of his trunk; it also didn't help that Angelina, Katie Bell, Neville, Dean, and Seamus were looking at him from a few feet back.
“Harry Potter! Explain to me right now what's going on” screamed Hermione outraged and upset.  “You ignore us on the train, you don't make dinner and you don't tell us why and now it turns out you're going to Slytherin!” She said, raising her voice almost yelling at him.
He located the Wesley’s going up and when he thought he was going to leave alone, Fred and George saw him and smiled extensively they walked to meet him.
1) Skint - a British slang term for broke or poor.
– It is... That... that is ... Lucius' son? – he managed to stutter when he found his voice.
Severus walked through the corridors of the dungeons quickly, carrying his wand tightly, and didn't mind hexing a few students and giving detentions if his frustration came down a little bit.
He cleared his throat to catch the attention of his companion who opened his eyes surprised and straightened himself quickly.
They ate between jokes and games at Harry's expense until it was time for selection.
"All right, Harry, come with me to my office, but I don't assure you that what you're asking for is possible” he looked at Minerva and nodded. “Professor, please let all the first-time students sit together and announce that the selection will be taken place at the end of the banquet” he saw that she was going to ask stopped her with a signal. “I'll explain later Minerva.” Having said this, he walked with Harry towards his office.
and fold it. He got up and I look at the boy.
"All right, I understand I'm not as dumb as I look," he said pouting, "I know that for now I shouldn't trust anyone, just you.
When he got back to the house everyone waited for him for breakfast.
“No Harry. You can't see what I see, but…” He got closer to the brunette and whispered, “You're beautiful.”
He was so focused on planning his movements that he didn't see the person coming closer, he bumped into something soft that immediately embraced him. He looked up bewildered and he saw Draco.
Inside the ruined mansion, the Dark Lord walked furiously through the halls looking for Snape. It wasn’t possible that nobody had seen him all day and to worsen his temper Nagini still hadn’t returned from her hunt; they would both pay for making him wait.
"I think it's best for us to prepare for Harry's arrival, he will arrive soon, and I don’t think I have to tell you that you cannot talk about this with no one. – Molly looked seriously at each member of her family while she pondered what to make for dinner. – Good, now with that understood, is time to forget about it for the moment and we make Harry feel right at home. – she turned around and said – Hermione der, help me in the kitchen. The rest of you know what you have to do.
Draco looked at him surprised, but he knew he couldn't say no to him, let alone with him in that state.
– As my lord says – Draco breathed with relief inside.
Draco didn't even wait for an answer, but within a few seconds, Dobby had returned with everything he needed. He took a cloth, dipped it a little in the water, and passed it through Harry’s forehead and neck wiping his sweat.
"Then he may listen to me when I tell him that I am his son and …  he started with excitement but was interrupted again.
Harry decided that he could entrust that to them, anyway, they had to guess the motive since Mrs. Malfoy's disappearance had already been made public. He took a breath of air and began to tell them from the time he met Draco in Muggle Park until they began to live together and meet at Grimmauld Place, without revealing the presence of Sirius and Remus, let alone that of his father and Severus.

"I'm not sure my Lord, but that won't stop me from trying to win his heart," he replied with assuredness.
"Crying...," he repeated, understanding what had happened, "those assholes! –  he saw the elf hit the wall hard and stopped him – I don't care if you want to punish yourself, but first, you have to look for Professor Remus and Black and tell them Harry has returned and to look for us fast.
"You're a monster," he groaned, dropping his head on the table in a sign of defeat.
"I'm sorry Professor, but he asked for it," he said in a tone that was anything but regret or apology.
she hissed with amusement.
Draco and Harry split up and both blushed furiously when they saw the two boys.
Griphook watched him quietly for a few seconds and for some reason that look made Harry extremely uncomfortable. There was something about that Goblin he didn't like.
would have done something to him. He let out a sigh as he went into the shower. He didn't know what to do, on the one hand, there was the undeniable fact that Tom Riddle or Lord Voldemort was his father, but on the other hand, that same person hated him and wanted to see him dead. And he didn't know what to do, if what his dad said in the memories was true, he could with Remus's help bring them back and maybe, just maybe his godfather too, and if he achieved that maybe he could get his other father back, too.
"And what would it be about, young Malfoy?" he asked, straightening out to observe him better.
"And what do you have to say about my son?" he finally asked, with pretended curiosity.
– We'd better get down or Black will come up for us.
"I... I want you to know that I will court Harry," he said firmly, eagerly awaiting the reaction of the older males.
Harry clung to Draco's neck tightly as they made their way to his room.
–Understand that I couldn't risk being discovered, so when I used you to get what I wanted, I got Cornelius to get you out. Of course, you were a great help, you got to be hated in a short time, and so you made my return the only ray of hope in that place.
"Moony!– Sirius screamed outraged.
Tany XD
"Sorry Young Malfoy, I just came to see if you needed anything and to offer you tea and cookies – Dobby watched him restlessly.
"What the Headmaster wants is for none of us to oppose the decision he made to end the war, convincing us that it was better for all because they were no guarantee you would survive the war. – Fred said.
– Kreacher enough! I understand. You hate me for occupying the Black's Mansion and I hate you for Sirius's death. But I called you to propose a truce: if you help me in whatever I need, no matter what it may be, when I defeat Voldemort you'll be free to go with the Malfoys or whoever you want—Harry saw his eyes shine and knew he needed only one thing: to make sure. -But for the duration of the war, you won't be able to tell anyone, absolutely no one what you see, hear or do. Understood?"
Harry was even more lost every second that passed, what news were they talking about? He also knew that Ginny thought she loved him but she was only dazzled by his fame, but from Hermione, he did not expect it, because even if though it seemed strange he noticed that she had taken longer than usual in moving away from the kiss she had given him on the cheek. He just hoped it was just strange thoughts of him.
– Why can't I tell anyone anything? What is the important thing you have to give me? Is it about my godfather's inheritance? – Harry had been so immersed in the situation with Malfoy’s mother he had not realized how anxious he was to get the information he would get today.
"Master Harry is behind the chair crying, but he had told Kreacher not to say he had arrived and Kreacher has disobeyed," he said with difficulty.
"Yes, he's very important to me—when he saw his malicious smiles, he hastened to clear up—it's not what you think, he's like my... father," he said, looking out the window.
Harry was shocked. Dumbledore planned to deliver him to his father so he could kill him, and that way ensure his own life and them…
"Well, you're wrong buddy, they searched Malfoy Mansion and found nothing," he said with a frown, "they only gave him a year for being caught in the Ministry.
"I'll see you at dinner," that said, he left the room.
–Come on Harry, you've been through a lot today. You'd better go to bed. I'll come with you and then ask Kreacher to fix me a room if you don't mind," Draco said, driving the brunette into the room.
clung tighter to his godson’s waist separating his legs more so that the latter would better fit together. They both let out a gentle sigh and that was more than Sirius could bear.

– Si-Sirius – he gasps as he threw his head back exposing his neck more – stop... we-we need to talk about Harry.

"We don't know anything, Harry," hastened to answer Hermione, "that they've been here, they've been here, but you know they don't tell us anything," she said, looking around the room, avoiding, by all means, his gaze.
were phrases that made him feel like he was on fire, but he wouldn't ask his father for his clothes.
When they arrived at the room, Draco closed the door behind him.
He looked at the twins, who looked at him with a serious expression, and then looked at each of the family members sadly before returning their eyes to Fred and George who looked at him with pity but still shook their head. Harry understood what they were trying to tell him, he lowered his gaze and put a wall around his heart and raised his barriers.
But this time Draco didn’t get alarmed and snarled loudly while he got closer to Harry.
He rolled over his side and approached Harry who was instantly startled but smiled at the blonde and immediately turned around snuggling up to his chest. Draco sighed satisfied and embraced the brunette from his waist as he whispered in his ear a good night that corresponded to him with a whisper.
"Oh come on Severus, don’t tell me you worry know like a surrogate father –he spoke with a sneer– but if you want to know I’ll tell you, I was at a friend's house and I plan to stay with him for a few days, it is too boring here.
After Draco left Harry stayed unpacking his belongings. Kreacher had prepared two rooms for Draco and him, but Harry was not happy to know that he could no longer sleep next to the blonde.
"There's always a price to pay Professor, I'm aware that I'm going to lose my friends but I'm going to make sure I win this war," he decided to end that matter once and for all, and he dropped the phrase that would tip the scales in his favor. “For the Greater Good.”
– It's all right. For now, you must rest, I don't know what put you like this – his gaze slid slightly to the
– I need to think about a lot of things. At the moment I will try nothing and... Severus, I'm not stupid, I know you're a double spy– he saw Severus swallowing with difficulty and smiled – I've always known, you never betrayed me, but this is very delicate, so you're strictly forbidden to say something of this to the crazy old man because I could assure you that he's behind all this.
"Is it about Dumbledore's visit?" seeing the twins' surprised face he rushed to clarify – I heard one of Ron and Hermione’s conversation, but it's clear that no one is going to tell me anything," he said sadly.
He still smiled like a fool when he came out of the
Harry took a deep breath but sat in front of his father and with a grimace looked up.
- he asked mockingly.

"Of course.," he said, he had to be careful with Black, "plus potions are very interesting, but you don't know what I'm talking about, so forget it," he ended up with a mockery.
"Will you help me bring them back? – seeing Tom's gaze he hastened to explain – after all Lily is his best friend and she took care of me;  she would be like an aunt to me, a real one not like Petunia – he said, trying to convince his father.
He turned around, picked up his things, and ran.
"I... I... -Harry babbled without knowing how to continue.
Awesome Chapter no? The long-awaited reunion between father and son! stay tuned for the next one shortly. XD
Draco felt like shit, Potter wasn’t in the mood for his taunts or jokes. Whatever he’d seen in those memories left him defeated and completely vulnerable. He was supposed to take advantage but felt no desire to do so.
"Come On, Draco, let's get dressed," he said, pulling on a smiling blond man's hand, "I have to take a bath and I want you to help me choose which clothes to wear, will you help me? – He asked with shining eyes.
_ He won’t mark you, will he?” Harry was alarmed.
A few minutes later Draco watched Harry stir restlessly in his sleep and thought he was almost awake. He turned his attention to his book, but seconds later he began to hear an accelerated breath and a groan of barely audible pain escaped from the brunette's throat.
–Well yes, but Hermione was not the one who confronted Quirrel in the first year, nor the one that killed the basilisk and destroyed the diary in the second, nor the one in the cemetery being tortured, let alone the one that had to fight you alone in the ministry, besides … - but he interrupted himself when he saw the paleness on his father’s face. – Hey, are you ok? – seeing as he didn’t reply he shook the man’s shoulders.
– What the hell is wrong with you Draco? That hurt you know- he looked at the blond in front of him and seeing as the other wasn’t paying him attention he got mad and added. – the least you could do is help me up, don’t you think?
"If I were for me, I would sleep with you every day," he said with regret, "but we can't, so enjoy the minutes you have me at your side Potter because they are unrepeatable. – he spoke with sufficiency. – Many would kill just to be in my arms as you are now and …
Tom watched him for several seconds as he thought of the ironicalness of the situation, for he, his worst enemy, was actually his father; and the boy in front of him, who was his rival at school, was in love with him.
“Are you all set, Harry?” asked Draco following the movements of the brunette carefully.
– My… s-sir, what is it? –  Severus asked a little more recovered from the shock.
Harry woke up with the sun bathing his face, he was very hot, so he decided to take the time to take a walk through the grounds. He got up quietly, put on his glasses, and dressed, then went out the back of the house into the garden. He spent about half an hour thinking about what Draco would be doing at the time and whether he'd remember him.
A look that did not go unnoticed by Harry, but he decided to overlook it because at that moment Ron, the twins, Ginny, and Hermione entered the room.
“Harry, why didn't you sit with us on the train? – Hermione asked with feigned concern.
let out a sigh looking at the blue sky.
– Can you tell us what was going on here Harry? You aren’t thinking of taking advantage of our little sister? - they almost laughed at Harry's panicked face.
He watched with fascination as the brunette shuddered and let out a gentle gasp. His gaze crossed with green eyes and smiled mischievously straightening.
He quickly wiped his face, but the pain and tears kept coming out of his eyes.
- "I hope he’s been given many years in Azkaban," he said, knowing that while that was what he wanted, it would upset Draco.
Harry only got to cover the front and close his eyes tightly to avoid seeing the looks he was getting from everyone.
– Of course I'm no pervert! But I can't say the same thing about others," he said, staring at the man in front of him, "right, Black?
"Enough or I will vomit," Severus interrupted with pretended disgust, "I'm disgusted by so much sentimentality," Severus finished.
– Well, it looks like Potter's here. Could you ask him if I can get out of the room? – he rolled on his back, he was numb by the position.
He took out his wand and made a cut along his palm. The scarlet of his blood glows before a few drops fell on the ground. He closed his palm in a fist to force the release of more blood and carefully slide his palm over the entire lid of the box, which glitters in a pale blue color that quickly turned to emerald green.
He appeared on the banks of the house and walked slowly towards the woman waiting for him at the entrance. When I got before her he smiled at her.
"Harry dear," she said, squeezing him in a big hug, "How have you grown my boy, but do come in its cold outside.”
– Severus says that the Lord wants to see me at noon today.
"How did I not think of this before!"
"You know that if I want a mother back, I have to please him. Besides – he looked at Severus and smiled- Maybe I don't mind being friends with Potter, after all, who doesn't want to be friends with the Boy-who-lived.
– I know that you may not care what happens to her, but please I ask that... I beg you to help me save her, I promise I'll do whatever you want, whatever it is, but please save her Potter, that's all I'm asking." His eyes reflected an intense pain and deep sadness that Harry was tempted to hug him and assure him that everything would be fine, but as soon as he thought that he dismissed the idea.
– I don't know Padfoot. He had been calm, but suddenly he got up from the couch and started walking, he looked very worried.
The problem was that in his life everything was possible; and that was the reason he found himself laid on his back on the bed looking at photographs of his godfather and his parents, missing them and feeling more alone than ever. He loved his friends, but he needed something else... someone else, and not even Ginny had been able to fill that void.
Draco turned around ready to leave but before reaching the door he heard the Lord's voice again.
"Big?" asks Tom, not wanting to know the answer very well.
“Wow, it looks like our Harry has a lot of secrets. We understood that no one could get in there after...– he shut up and looked at the brunette.
"Mmm"— Harry knew he wasn't telling him everything, but he assumed it was personal things—I had to pick up my letter and memories on Gringotts,' he said thoughtfully.
HAPPY READING XD
– Harry before you make a decision you should know that they have agreed because he convinced them that it was best for you and the magical world and if we are sincere we also think it would be best for you but... we know that he won’t kill you, but torture you and we won't let anything happen to you without first doing everything we can to save you–they looked at each other and continued—that's why we decided to tell you the truth.

Harry felt as if he was surging with anger listening to Ron talk that way about Draco.
AUTHOR: VampirePrincess27
Tom felt uncomfortable for a moment, but as he looked at him in that state he could only squeeze him against his chest tightly, wishing with that act to melt him with his skin and keep him protected always.
He smiled maliciously at the thought that he still hadn’t revealed the icing on the cake. "Ah, I almost forgot, this schedule will only be Monday through Friday". He heard a sigh of relief at his side and smiled wickedly at the owner of the sigh. "Saturdays and Sundays there will only be physical training because you will have Occlumency classes with Severus... ". He saw the completely desolate expression of the brunette and pitied him a little, just a little. "And Sunday with Malfoy until no more than midday."
"You won't be alone," he said, holding it firmly holding his chin, "you're my only son, and I won't let them hurt you again," he saw the surprise mixed with joy in his eyes, and he couldn't help but feel something warm stay in his chest—As to what you're going to do, well, I think we can formulate a plan, but one thing I’m sure about is that you’ll return to Hogwarts. I won’t permit my heir to be a good for nothing. – he said warning him with his gaze.
– But that's impossible...because they... they don't... but they have hated each other all along, it is impossible that now Harry...–but he was interrupted by a whisper.
He felt a dagger stab in his heart as he uttered those words, but he knew he couldn’t condemn the Muggle and magical world just because he didn’t want to lose his father.
Tom knew part of that was his fault, so he didn’t have any other choice than to relax and hug the boy in his lap.
A plop rang out in the room.
But Harry didn’t give anything away. He would have before; Hermione has always been able to see the truth in his eyes but Draco had taught him to conceal his emotions so he could empty his mind and surprisingly it hadn’t given him difficulties.
"It seems that we won't have to wait long for me to meet the Lord," he extended the letter that was taken by Sirius, "he wants to see me as soon as possible.
3) Snake a la mode di Voldemort - basically snake in Voldemort's style.  (differs from the original in Spanish)
"But we don't want you to stay," they said together, "the best thing for you is to start distancing yourself from everyone. We don't want to see you suffer any more than you already have Harry, you don't deserve it after everything you've had to live. We couldn't do anything for Sirius but now we won't leave you alone, you can trust us for anything you need.
"Surely the damm bastard hid, like the cowardly snake he is," he said with annoyance.
Remus, Sirius, and Severus only swore quickly and turned around to avoid looking at a naked Harry Potter from head to toe, but some blonde was unable to react like the others and only kept devouring Harry's body with his eyes; his eyes were fully opened and he was opening and closing his mouth like a fish out of water.
– All right, Severus, we can do this tomorrow. Now what I need is for you to go get your godson right now, I need to know if he's been able to do what I asked or if he's located Potter.
– "The master forbade Twynki to say his name until you agree to speak to him without bewitching him"–the elf writhed his hands nervously.
Having been spying on Harry for almost every vacation, Draco was sure the brunette did not exaggerate.
– I... well I...– he started nervously – I would like to try to approach my... Tom – seeing his family's faces of wonder he rushed to clarify – I just want to give him...
"Mine," Harry said as he kissed his pale neck.
– Harry, I know my word probably has no value being who I am, but I think the Dark Lord is no longer interested in killing you. "He saw the face of disbelief of the adults and added – There is something I did not tell you yesterday, the Lord... he gave me the mission to become your friend and take care of you all the time, from everything and everyone, I don't think it was necessary to tell me that if anything that happened to you I would pay for it – he snorted – as if I was going to let anything happened to you.
"Why didn't you say anything?" Draco asked the brunette, his tone between worried and annoyed.
"Of course," he got up and bowed, "Ill take my leave”
thought, "but now you tell me what you've done, I've been locked in my room over the holidays.
– Very good. Could you take on your true appearance and show me the letter again?
"I know you're confused Harry but that's not the strangest thing; When they said they didn't find anything is because they found nothing, no more than some clothes and valuables but from Narcissa Malfoy and her son there weren’t any signs that they been there for along time. – she said pensively.
– What?!! Are you crazy?!! – Draco asked alarmed –Did you not heard him? If you go to the weasel's house he will crucio both of us.
He quickly left the library and climbed the stairs as fast as he could, but without making his presence known.
They came out of the chimney with their bags in their hand. Sirius was so entertaining cleaning the ashes in the robe that he did not notice the scene in front of his eyes, but Remus, being a lycanthrope immediately sensed a scent that even though it was familiar did not belong to Harry. He was stunned to see a couple of young men lying on the couch sleeping peacefully. That wasn't weird, the incredibly weird and almost impossible to believe was who those couple of guys were.
just that and I’ll plead guilty," he said seriously as he writhed his hands nervously.
Nagini, the Lord's huge snake, was screwed around Harry. Her tail was hugged by Harry as if it were a pillow, while Harry rested his head comfortably on the snake and the snake rested his huge head on Harry's hips.
(See the end of the chapter for
– Si-Sirius – he stuttered.
He opened the door of the room and allowed the blonde entry, who curiously looked at the room, only a small bag was on the huge bed. For not being lived in for a long time it was very clean, but he guessed that it had just been cleaned as Potter had been on Privet Drive all the time.
Harry let him go embarrassed and his godfather let out a giggle.
"I didn't expect any less, it's his golden boy," he said mockingly.
"I don't think so, I haven't told anyone, not even the mansion elves," he looked at the envelope with suspicion. – but the letter is from my godfather.
Harry saw them nod and smiled happy. A second later he was caught in a group hug.
"Well, and now let's go before I change my mind – with a wand movement he dressed his son and took him from his wrist to head to the library, being followed by a docile Harry who only stared at the ground muttering a faint
In his Occlumency classes, he went very well, Professor Severus had left him several books with many exercises; the only thing he wasn't doing very well was in etiquette classes, not that he didn't learn but rather that he couldn't concentrate. He wanted to talk to Draco about what had happened between them but with all the things he had to do in the day, he ended up exhausted at night and nothing helped the fact that they had been assigned a room each and quite far away.
"Oh, by the way, Harry, I almost forgot, did you know that Lucius Malfoy's trial has already taken place?" he asked.
"A few days ago, I got a letter from James. I didn't know who It was, but when I got my memories I got a box of them and that's where I knew you were our son," he said seriously, still boiling with rage for his foolish carelessness.
Harry hurried through one of the many corridors there was, but this time they didn't go down to the subsoils but entered a kind of white-walled room, with a desk and a couple of chairs.
– All right, but first, you have to put on your pajamas. I'll get my things; I won't be long.
– For Remus and my... godfather – he ended in an embarrassed whisper.
Harry saw her disappear through the door and felt a huge urge to come in and sit with Draco. He fixed the school robe nervously.
Kreacher watched his master cry silently, he was standing near the kitchen so he wouldn't see him. Gathering his courage, he turned around and headed to the library, but before entering, the door was abruptly opened by Draco.
Draco and Harry were each sitting in an armchair reading a book, outside the afternoon, was falling. Having eaten they returned to their reading and at that time was a blond with a nose buried in a book entitled "Ancient Spells of Pure Blood Families" seeking some mention of Horcruxes, while a brunette struggled to keep reading and keep his eyes open at the same time.
"Master Harry" he gave a look of distrust to the redheads in front of him.
Dear Voldy is getting closer to the truth, and so is our Dear Draco. How will he react once he knows? Is Harry going back to those horrible muggles? Will he tell Granger and the redhead?  Aghh, SO many questions.
Tom looked at him and smiled, knowing what he meant.
"Anyway," he said annoyedly, "talking about this, how did you find out about everything?" he asked with curiosity.
Harry walked down the corridor knowing nothing, feeling only anger, pain, and disappointment. He wasn't aware of his magic was vibrating the armor where he passed, but Snape did.
" Good morning to you all – he greeted with joy, which earned a couple of incredulous looks from the twins.
"It's not necessary–" he was quick to answer when he saw the brunette come down the stairs like a tornado.
"Malfoy will take care of giving him quick etiquette classes, and since there's not much time to teach him to eat the different kinds of food, the least I hope is that he learns to behave like a pureblood on the table even if he still eats junk". He heard his son moaning and burying his face in his hands embarrassed.
Things are getting spicy. XD Happy Reading.
He took a deep breath before picking up the first memory. He knew that after seeing the first one there was no going back, but he had already made up his mind that there was no turning back either. He overturned the content of the memories marked with number one, closed his eyes for a second before leaning forward.
"My lord– he bowed his head slightly and left the room.
"What are you laughing about brat," he said, fulminating him with his eyes.
– Harry, we will understand if you decide not to keep in touch with us after this but...
"Yes, my lord," the two answered with a bow.
The last thing Harry saw before he was transported by the
When Harry and Dumbledore arrived at the office, he made him sit in the chair in front of his desk.
He looked at George who nodded showing his agreement.
– Don't worry Harry, your little secret is safe with us.
– Yeah, Harry, you don't need to kill us for that.
Harry continued to assimilate the information he had just received and from what he had heard from Hermione and Ron it was very likely that they were telling the truth, but still...
He thought. "Lupin" He spat, mad. "You'll be in charge of reviewing all the subjects with Potter and putting him on an academic level that's up to par with his last name; Black you will take care of his physical and magical training, with that I mean physical endurance, sword fight, duel and everything about a quick course to an Auror". He saw the man nod and looked back at his son and it was his turn to smile when he saw the expression of disappointment on his beloved son's face
"I'm not interested in your excuses Potter," he said with pretended annoyance, "Now help me pick the member for the team,” he said while pulling the brunette towards the center.

While they were chatting, Tom appeared with Severus and Nagini near number 12 Grimmauld Place.
Harry felt his heart almost explode with joy as he heard Draco's words, but he couldn't stop crying so he just nodded on Draco's back.
Tom nodded and a few seconds later disappeared.
“Draco!” Blaise and Theo shouted in horror at the same time.
"Nothing for now. If I need anything, I’ll call you. – he turned around and jumped on the bed willing to spend two hours of study, after all, it wasn’t every day you could access such an old book of potions that would surely make Severus green with envy. He smiled with satisfaction.
-There have been too many emotions for you today Harry and interesting discoveries for me. – he said looking intensely at the blond, who just blushed – so why don’t we all take a seat and talk for a moment. After you can rest and explain the presence of young Malfoy at the manor.” He reached his hand to Harry’s back but at seeing the distrust on Slytherin’s expression he added more for the blond than for Harry. – Agreed?
– Well, then get dressed before...
"Come on” Draco rose with a sigh and held out his hand. “Let's go down to eat” They came out of the brunette's bedroom, but before they went out through the portrait he turned and looked at those beautiful green eyes. “By the way, now we're officially boyfriends, at least inside Slytherin” He winced and went into the common room. “But that does not mean I will not hex anyone who gets inappropriately close to you, so warn your little friends”. Having said this he kissed him in front of the whole common room to let it be clear that Harry was his and anyone who wished to harm him would suffer a slow and painful death.
“We believe you, Harry.”
Harry knew he would never get his family back, all he had left lost to him forever a few months ago.
The argument had been so strong that his uncle had run him out of the house, shoving in his face the fact that he already had a house and that he could finally leave. But he still couldn't decide whether he'd moved to Grimmauld Place without the director's knowledge or stay until the return of classes. And while the decision was not made, he was confined to his room, which on second thought was not a bad thing because he had all the free time to sort out his ideas and make a decision.
They all let go of giggles. He felt Draco's soft fingers on his chin and looked up. Draco smiled cynically. At his signal they all circled and Draco took Harry by the waist as he kissed him gently and carefree. Anyone passing by would only see a compact group of Slytherins.
He observed the snake pull out her tongue a couple of times before nodding.
– Ron? Hermione? – he asked in a whisper before looking up at the twins.
Harry left half an hour later with the promise that as soon as he had information, he would immediately bring it to him. Smiling he headed to the common room.
"Have a
Voldemort folded he scroll.
The unexpected visit by the Hogwarts headmaster had made the Dursleys know that he was now wholly orphaned, which had caused them to decide to take revenge for the time they had to endure at home in fear of his godfather's killer. Professor Dumbledore had gone to his uncle's house three days earlier to do the reading of Sirius's will and it was there that unfortunately, his uncles had realized that he had inherited a house and a lot of money even if they did not fully understand it; because what he had inherited was the number 12 Grimmauld Place (a mansion), several chambers in Gringotts full of galleons in his name and against his will that despicable domestic elf Kreacher.
He couldn't help but purr gently as he felt Draco's caresses on his head.
– If you value your life at all you insolent little brat, don't ever express yourself like that again about ... Potter –he spoke through clenched teeth, permeating every word with poison – I could never see Potter that way, he would be like a son to me and...—he stopped at the stunned gaze of the Malfoy heir and knew he would crunch him to the point of exhaustion for making him lose his patience.
– You should know that this could cost you dearly. You are lucky I still need you and I had to say I admire your courage or stupidity, as you look at it, to speak in that manner to Lord Voldemort. However, I must warn you that it will be the first and last time that you’ll come out unscathed- he righted himself and smiled maliciously. – or almost. Crucio!
– Upstairs on the right, first door.
He leaned on the couch thinking of his beloved James. Would Harry be as good at flying as his love? He let himself sink into the memory of the first game he went to see of his beautiful boy with unruly hair.
"Before what, Moony? – he whispered in his ear.
Young Malfoy looked him in the eye for a few seconds before nodding and loosening the grip by freeing Harry from jail from his arms. A prison that from what he saw Harry didn’t mind at all. He took Harry by the shoulders and gently led him to the couch where he sat with Sirius and Draco on both sides, each taking a hand from the brunette.
He saw the blonde leave the room and went to the bathroom to clean himself up and change.
Does anybody else want to punch Ron's face? NO? just me? Alright then. And can Fred and George be any more amazing! I love them.
"Of course, I wasn't mad at you! It's just that...– He twisted his hands without looking at his father. "I thought since I found you and you accepted me in your life. Well, I'd have a normal family vacation. But if you don't want to, then...– He didn’t finish. He felt uncomfortable. Maybe he misinterpreted things.
Greetings guys. here is another chapter. Hope you enjoy it! I just noticed that I deleted the announcement that the updates will be on Sundays from now on so ... yeah.
"Mmm wouldn't be so sure," he said, releasing the boy and walking to a couch at the back of the library, - After all, your performance at Hogwarts leaves a lot to be desired –he continued, speaking loudly to make sure he listened to him.
Remus sat in front of them and saw the scene in front of him with amusement, but then frowned annoyed at Sirius who only made a funny pout and let go of Harry's hand.
took the letter out of his pocket, and stretched it out to Griphook, who set it on fire instantly. Harry watched him curiously.
"No guys, you've already done it. Knowing that I can count on you is a great relief and comfort – he moved slightly uncomfortable – but I want to know if you can tell me what your whole family is hiding, I want to know what does Dumbledore have to do with all of this.
"I'm counting on that young Malfoy," He said with a warning note in his voice that went unnoticed by Harry "Well, I'm leaving. I'll see you on your outings to Hogsmeade, ah! Severus will give them Polyjuice to take to the express.”  He looked at Malfoy and he spoke. “As Narcissa's disappearance has already been made public, there is no point in Severus taking Polyjuice so you will go directly with him. I suppose the Wesley twins will be able to keep you company," he said, looking back at his son.
Hope you enjoy the chapter. The next update will be on the 27th. I could post early but it all depends. Who knows? Maybe as a Xmas present. XD
– No need, stay with me just... a little longer – he didn’t look up as he spoke feeling embarrassed.
Harry didn't wait any longer, he had to know they were planning, and he wouldn't stop. He walked towards the closed door with the twins on his heels, when he was in front of the door he turned around towards the twins and took out his wand.
"He seems to be very comfortable resting so we didn't want to disturb you," he smiled at the boy's blush – but from what I see, you're both very tired so it's best if you head to sleep. We're going to go to rest too, aren't we, Paddy? He added, hoping Sirius would understand the threat implied in that sentence. But judging by his frown, he doubted that he had even listened to him.
"Wait for me here Harry, I'll let Minerva know that you will be resorted last” – he went to the door with a triumphal smile on his lips.
Harry knocked in Professor Snape's rooms and then walked in.
“Don’t worry. We will test the waters with some of them and let you know.”
Draco approached Harry and slowly placed a soft kiss on his forehead and then dropped
“You are right”
– I'm so sorry.
Tom was so surprised that he could not react until a loud burst of magic caught his attention a second before a spell passed by rubbing the right side of his face. He looked up to see a furious Draco Malfoy pointing his wand directly at him as he breathed agitatedly.
– You don't expect me to believe that Malfoy. I'm sure you're coming with more Death Eaters or your father." He thought he saw a look of pain in his eyes, but it was just an illusion, he still had the same look of superiority as ever.
Before he reached his table, he was intercepted by Fred and George who between laughter and jokes took him to a corner to eat.
Tom stopped a growl when he heard the last name, what did blondie have to do with his son? He had barely found out he had a son and that pompous brat was already thinking of taking him. He had to take matters into his own hands as soon as possible.
he opened the window and took the letter. – Out, out, you filthy animal! Don't even think I'll give you something – he saw that the owl look at him with resentment, but he didn’t care
Harry watched them with surprise. If it wasn't for the fact that he knew Draco and his godfather were family, he would have suspicions about it; They were so similar in some things, they had even reacted the same way! The two were feral, saying how they would gradually torture them until they came to their knees to apologize to Harry, and only then would they be killed as the weasels they were.
– Now is not the time, they will soon realize that we are missing, and we do not want to raise suspicions. No one should know that we will tell you the truth, it is for safety I hope you understand...
Harry felt he was stabbed with every word that came out of his old best friend's mouth, but he refused to show it and kept quiet.
Draco walked a few steps to stand in front of the Lord. He stood upright without saying anything and looked at him straight in the eye.
Severus couldn't believe what he had seen; Potter sure had balls to talk to the Dark Lord in such a manner, even being his son, he could have crucio him. But it seems like the brat always gets away with it.
“b-but how did you know? " asked Harry, horrified that someone knew his secret—why didn't you tell me at the time?
Severus looked calm, but he searched the streets for some sign of Aurors in the area or the Order of the Phoenix. They headed together into space between numbers 11 and 13.

– You bastard! “ screamed a furious Draco  – I told you that...
– Hey, you've done nothing wrong! –  Draco said when he saw Harry's blush, "Which reminds me... do you want to tell me what happened? –  he asked, placing a hand on the brunette’s cheek.
-Well, I wouldn't be so sure Siri–he turned and placed his hands on Sirius' arms–you saw them these days, they're so close that they looked like one, they complimented each other in phrases, actions, and decisions.
Draco was nervous, but like every good Malfoy concealed his emotions to avoid being easy prey. He approached slowly, just as he was one step away from the Lord, he looked up and saw him approaching, resisting the impulse to get away from him, he shut his eyes as he saw the skeletal hand heading towards his face.
They got on the train and headed to the last cart, which was always unoccupied.  On his way, he met Ron, Hermione, and Ginny. He looked at them sadly before covering his expression with indifference and following their path.
The two went to bed and took their preferred position, with Harry facing Draco and clinging to his shirt and Draco hugging Harry tightly at his back.
– Of course not! "He said astonishing everyone and earning a warning look from his father that he ignored completely before arriving in two strides in front of Draco and raising him by the arms – no one will punish you, especially since I can imagine what kind of punishments you use. – he said looking at his father. – and ...
"I know, I've stopped trusting him too, I’ve realized days ago that he has been using me and lying to me as well. – he went silent for a couple of seconds, wondering how much he could tell them without giving himself away – I … I haven’t been staying at the Dursleys for a couple of days now.
–Right away my lord”. He bowed and rushed out.
His thoughts were interrupted when he felt acute pain through his chest and unable to help it, he fell to the ground breathing with difficulty. Through his cloudy eyes, he managed to distinguish Nagini near him and Severus kneeling beside him. Blinking furiously, he managed to focus a Severus in shock but ignored him when he felt something running down his cheeks moistening it, so he raised a hand towards his face thinking he was hurt. But when he removed his hand what came out was a clear substance clear as water and then he remembered.
"Of course my Lord," he said, bowing, "I will make sure nothing happens to him.
– Of course Harry Potter sir. Dobby will be happy to help you. You just have to say what Master Potter needs."
- Do not look at the memories that are in the
or not now he would know how far to trust Draco Malfoy.
–Thank you! –  Malfoy smiled and embraced him causing a slight shudder in both. -I have to go now.- Harry returned the hug automatically and when he reacted, he cleared his throat and walked away.
"Wow, it looks like we're not in the mood today," he said with a half-smile as he moved his wand, throwing a
Harry listened to Draco's words and was afraid they would be true, so he walked away with terror from the arms that held him and returned to Draco's arms.
Harry felt as if the air had been taken out of him when he read the last sentence, something heavy settled in his stomach, oh Merlin, his father!
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dumbledore... You...”
– Yes–. Draco wrapped him in his arms – I have to change my clothes. Promise you'll wait for me until I get back to read that book, I don't want anything to happen to you. I won't be long and then you can go to your uncles' house – he said slowly wishing he didn’t hit a nerve.
Hermione and Ron looked at him in awe, though the latter was still a little resentful.
– That mission is not only for young Malfoy, Severus, but I think you already know. I need weekly reports of the boy's progress and any inconvenience that comes immediately let me know.
"b-but Moony – he stuttered – "My little Prongs is... Is... it's - he moved his hands frantically
fallen in love. The problem was that this person sounded so confident that Severus's presence was indispensable before he completely loses his patience.
– All right. That's how it's going to be then.
However, the tiredness and warmth of that body next to his began to make drowsy until he lay on the armrest of the sofa with the Body of the Gryffindor on his.
– Take a seat Potter– He ordered.
Sirius grumble at hearing the word “cute” in the same sentence that went to “Harry and Malfoy sleeping together” that he couldn’t take it anymore.
“Don’t worry, Father, I'll be fine.”
Draco winced in contempt but stopped before saying anything against them.  Instead, he saw an opportunity there that he wouldn't waste.
"Wow, you've got character," he said, taking him by the chin and bringing his face closer, "even though you still look like a scared kitten.
"You're to blame" and he continued, stopping the protest that's sure to come from Draco -" You're the most comfortable pillow I've ever had, and the warmest one" And to reaffirm what he just said, he stuck closer to the blonde’s torso.
“You know perfectly well that you don't have to do any tests” he whispered gently looking him in the eye “With you as a seeker the house cup will be ours.”
– Harry dear, you had us worried. You're hungry? – she said putting a plate of toast in front of him.
– Do they know you're with me? –Harry asked confused.
"It seems to be a Howler," Draco said, untangling the letter, "but I don’t know to whom it …” he stopped letting go of the envelope as if it burned him when he saw who send it and for who it was.  _ Do not touch it!
Harry blushed but nodded before disappearing to the mansion where his real family was.
– I, Draco Lucius Malfoy Black, heir to the noble and ancient Malfoy house, ask your permission to woo your son, Harry James Riddle Potter, heir to the noble and ancestral house Slytherin – he finished bowing his head with respect.
"I need a
– Do you have to go to the Mansion? – he whispered slowly.
read a book of advanced potions.
– Dead. I know. But it was an indication they left me, and I had to do it even knowing it was futile- he deflected his gaze to the ground.
Harry arrived in the Transfiguration classroom with Draco between a few laughs and jokes with the other Slytherins, but his laughter died when he heard Weasley's voice.
– he replied indignantly – “It’s just that …”
Harry smiled cheerfully and looked at Severus in a mute question. Severus seemed to understand why because he looked everyone in the eye and finally nodded to Harry, who let out a sigh of relief knowing he could trust them.
"Judging by your expression when you came in, I have to assume you remember perfectly what happened yesterday," he started, "so then you're going to tell me what happened? And don't lie to me – he was quick to add seeing that the brunette was going to protest – I know that when you got from your "appointment" you immediately locked yourself in that room after telling your elf to get me out of the room. - He stared at him to see his reaction to what he would say – I also know that what got you like that were the memories you saw in the
The banter his uncles gave him wasn't as close as to what he was expecting. They just picked the things up while they were yelling at him that he didn't even know how to use a watch. Harry wanted to reply that if he had one, he was sure he'd know how to use it, but he shouldn't abuse his luck that way, I'd better use it for something else. He'd make the most of it now that they weren't so upset.
Nagini slipped down his shoulders and watched the jars with the memories. She rolled her eyes as a snake could and got down from Tom’s shoulders.
– What does that mean? –  he asked warily – are you threatening me? He said raising his chin.
The rest of the trip was spent between jokes and explosive snap games.
– Only until you fall asleep.
"No. I was just trying to tell you that Harry won’t leave your side and that you shouldn't worry about that but about your feelings for him," he smiled rascally at the boy's stunned look—Even Sirius, who's not a werewolf, has realized your intentions with little Prongs. But what I meant is that when you're with Harry, your smell is... let’s say … suggestive – he let out a little laugh at the child's blush – I must admit that at first I didn't know if it was just physical attraction but now I'm sure what you feel for him goes further, although of course the wrapping doesn't displease you at all and I say it because I've seen you when you see him and...
– With
He turned around and came out of the protections of the Dark Lord's fortress. He looked back a few seconds making sure he was alone, took out the portkey Harry gave him, and disappeared.
"I know, I didn't mean that either. You know I'll miss you, but I have to go," he said with regret.
Harry recalled that Kreacher told him that he had found Draco crying alone in the mansion. Besides, that was the perfect excuse to spend more time with the blonde and just leave his uncles' house once and for all.
“Thank you, Draco, I wanted to do it, but Hedwig is very easy to recognize.”
am," he said, causing Harry to drop a growl. He got up from the table and looked at everyone. "If there are no questions I'm leaving". He saw everyone but his son’s slump figure nod. "Have a goodnight". And he headed to the hallway.
Remus was staring lost at the flames of the chimney, Sirius was like a caged lion walking back and forth throughout the room, occasionally looking out the window and Draco... well Draco was
After saying this, he directed his wand to the center and uttered an ancient spell. He watched the haze glow dimly and a second later both the haze and the protections glowed with an intense gold that blinded Severus for a moment. With a lazy wrist twist, Tom broke the guards into a thousand pieces by cementing the foundations of the mansion.
she gave a threatening hiss and shrunk in the corner.
"Explain yourself before I regret it – he dangerously stoned his eyes. For some reason, he didn't like the boy's behavior.
Voldemort was grinding his teeth in anger, none of them had come and he hated to be kept waiting. He stirred restlessly in the chair, his eyes stuck at the door. He was too restless, so he got up and started walking all over the room.
“Draco!” – Harry exclaimed astonished taking a step back.
(See the end of the chapter for
Voldemort was impatient, it was almost twelve o'clock and there was no sign of Severus, he was about to call Nagini to find out what was taking so long when he saw her slide through the door.

causing Tom's chest to swell with joy when he heard Harry call him father. Smirking slightly, he loosened his grip on his son’s wrist while he thought, “
– We will try to explain as much as we can, but it will be until very late at night. Your job will be to get rid of Ron and Hermione, for now, we have to go.
"Oh come on Siri, they're the same age and about being perverted," he smiled sideways, "I think you should remember what you do to me when we're alone," he said, shrugging his shoulders.

–Really Potter? –  Draco said sternly.
Harry was confused, he didn't know how they had come in if Draco hadn't let them in, and he hadn't told Harry that he had received a letter from the ministry.
"Let this serve as a warning," he said, looking at all the Gryffindors – "anyone
Harry explained to them a modified version of the plan because there were still things they didn't know, and it wasn't time. When he finished, they both smiled and congratulated him on his incredible plan.
They both let out a few giggles when they saw Harry's face.

– Harry! It's black magic, you can't use it just like that. It would drain almost all your magic, that without taking into account the fact that you don’t know how to execute the spell and have an illegal wand in your possession unless you want to receive your parent's visit in Azkaban. He said a tad uncomfortable.
Draco couldn't stand it and flipped the bedside table while the glasses on the fake window were starting to shake.
"All right, then it's decided," he got up content, "you can leave”
"You're right, I even disgust myself. You can go, just don't... look at the memories. - he made himself into a ball with silent tears streaming down his cheeks.
“Shut up and stay out of it!” he screamed with rage and looked at Harry – “Who the hell was it?” – he asked gritting his teeth.
– she hissed tiredly
Everyone was silent as the selection went on, Harry didn't look it, but he was dying of nerves. He swallowed saliva when the last student passed, saw the Headmaster get up, and fake surprise when he was interrupted by the selecting hat.
– Ok. I'll be down in a minute.
"Hmm, I think it's best if we do the Transfigurations homework and get ready to sleep," he said.
“Am I doing the correct thing? Tell me yes, please.”
Luckily, the week had passed without incident, perhaps because Weasley was still grounded and Granger dared not do anything alone. But since nothing is eternal, on a Tuesday after potions Professor Severus had asked him to stay. He told him they needed to talk and that he would wait for him the next day in the afternoon.
the brunette could reciprocate his feelings. He broke up with enormous willpower because he knew there was still a lot to talk about.
"Yes Weasley, listen to know-it-all Granger," Draco said contemptuously, "if you don't want me to send you to the infirmary.”
He didn't even look at them, he went up the stairs and when he opened the door, he placed Harry on the bed and covered him to avoid a cold.
– I'm pathetic, aren't I? Maybe I did something wrong without realizing it and now I'm paying for it," he said without looking up.
"Don't let them touch you Harry or ill cruciate them to exhaustion," he said, reloading his forehead on the brunette.
"Is your intention serious?" the boy looked him in the eye and nodded – My son, does he return your feelings – (1) he asked, not really wanting to know the answer.
"Weasley", he spat furiously “I always knew you had no brains, but at least I thought you had wizard's honor," he said coldly, "there's nothing lower than to attack from behind” he looked with contempt at both boys – “Potter, let's go.” He placed a hand over his shoulder, and they left through the portrait.
"We're free until lunchtime," Draco said, walking next to Harry, "What do you think if we go to the room and I lend you my owl, so you can send news to your dad's friends and your father”.
"You have a second to let go of me Potter or you'll be in detention all year round," he said, causing nervous laughter from everyone present.
Harry didn't know why, but he didn’t like what he was hearing, what the hell did all that mean? If something were to happen? what would happen to him exactly?
"All right, remember everything you learned, I want good grades, but above all, I love you safe and happy. Take care, son.”  and taking advantage of the twins not seeing them as they crossed all the people, he hugged him and placed a kiss on his hair.
– Stand down now, I need to think. When I need you again, I'll call you and there's no need to say what's going to happen to you if this gets out of here, Severus.
– -but... But... did you hear!? "he asked incredulously", he said his name in dreams and... the only thing missing is for him to be living with Voldemort, that would be …- but he interrupted his words when he saw the hand of that oxygenated blond rise on his back to grab his shirt.
"We'd better get down before your godfather does, or we'll have trouble," he said as he took the brunette by the hand, "Kreacher! –The elf appeared and disappeared with the trunk –“ come on.”
"Hi Harry," the brothers said smiling.
He blinked several times getting used to the sunlight, but a black blur clouded his eyes, he tied to rub his eyes but his hands were busy, one hugging and the other being caught under something. He closed his eyes for a few moments, he didn’t remember when he had fallen asleep. The last thing he remembered was... he opened his eyes blushing instantly. His left hand rested on the brunet's hip while his right arm served as a pillow, he felt his breathing accelerate, and, which made it worse because with every breath his chest brushed against Potter’s back. He cursed under his breath for falling asleep. As he could, he wiggled out of the bed before he did anything foolish.
"She's sure you'll agree, glad you don't have to go back to your uncles' house," Fred said.
– Hello guys, Fleur. I didn't expect to see you around, how have you been?" he asked.
“Of course not!” He exclaimed indignantly, that was too much, and he wouldn't allow it. “In case you forgot, my mother was the daughter of Muggles, and I don't know," he said, laughing without humor, “Perhaps that “Coward Malfoy” as you call him is a better friend than you could ever be!” He screamed, angry. He saw with satisfaction as he recoiled from the impact of his words. “At least with him I would make sure that he did not betray me at the slightest opportunity," he said, looking at Hermione as well.
"Then I'll be with you forever," he said, smiling, "and now make some room. Unless you've changed your mind.
Draco quickly looked at his book and realized he had it upside down, he supposed since he took it. He was so worried and saddened by Harry that he hadn't noticed. He turned it around and blushed even more, which made it worse hearing the chuckles of both adults.
"Don't be silly Ron, how do you come up with that," she said nervously.
– What does this mean, Harry? –  Draco said with uncertainty.
Harry didn't let him finish, he pounced over him and tumbled them over the bed, and He took his lips in a searing kiss. When they separated Draco’s, eyes had darkened with desire.
"All right, just because the mudblood protected you with her life," he said, looking at the boy.
” he snorted, shaking his head “
"It's good to know you haven't forgotten who
1.The Word used was "CITA" which in Spanish is used for both Date, romantically speaking, or the more formal Appointment medical or business-wise thus the little teasing by Draco.
Harry felt a blush and smiled foolishly as he watched the blonde put as many clothes in his trunk. Fifteen minutes later the trunk was on the bed with all included clothes, books, and all his belongings.
"What did they say?" he asked, although he had heard perfectly.
"No need, Mrs. Weasley, I'm sure he’s still upset about our little argument the other day – he looked at Ron who had red ears and avoided his gaze – it's best for us to have breakfast. I cannot leave your house so late or Dumbledore might worry, besides I have to go upstairs and fix my stuff.”
They all looked at each other before taking their own directions.
He gently lulled him as he murmured words of comfort, after a few minutes Harry's crying diminished and he raised his gaze and look at Draco.
– Bring me warm water, clean cloths, and a
Harry let out a sigh. How he wanted to repeat that kiss. At night he couldn't sleep well.  He needed Draco by his side and knew that at Hogwarts it would be even harder to be together unless... He jumped up, he had an idea of how to fix that problem and if he planned things right, he could get rid of Weasley and Granger and keep Dumbledore on his side without him suspecting anything.
Severus was alone in the middle of the room.
Harry smiled broadly, at least on something he had not disappointed his father.
– Of course, from what now I see my parents' mansion has accepted that it has two owners, it will not be a problem to enter. I just hope no one has already realized that Harry ran away from those Muggles' house.
"Come on, Siri, we have to take the potion. “He looked at Harry. “Go get your trunk Pup” and that said he took Sirius's hand, and they went to his room, not without first giving a meaningful look at young Malfoy.
-- and he went towards Harry's red lips.
"No Headmaster," Severus replied with clenched teeth, "I'm sorry, but I don't have much free time, among Potter's private classes, all my Dark Arts Defense groups and Potions, plus the Lord's commissions, I don't have much time left to invest in anything else.”
Hello Guys. It's been a long time. This translation kind of went into an unannounced hiatus. I apologize. Updates are going to be every two weeks now. I will do my best to continue translating and giving you guys chapters. As mentioned before, this story is a translation and the original story in Spanish is far ahead so if you know Spanish and want to read ahead please do so.
Ronald you better chill *rolls eyes* and Poor Severus, the multitasker, will he get a moment of peace from his employers? XD
"Yes Mrs. Weasley – he looked at everyone to see if they were paying attention to him and smiled to himself when he realized he was the center of attention – I have to go back to my uncles' house, it's the best thing for me. Although I would be happy if I could stay with you– he watched everyone and smiled when he met the distrustful gaze of the twins—You are the family I never had and before I leave I want to thank you for all the love and support you've given me. You are the only people who have received me regardless of my fortune or name, that's why I know that I can trust you and that you would never betray me like other people – he looked directly at his "friends" and added – thanks Merlin I arrived with a good family.
Draco had arrived at the mansion and explained to everyone what had happened with the Lord and his godfather. Later, the conversation had led to Harry's Occlumance lessons before meeting Voldemort.
"It seems Lucius will receive a worse punishment than what I already had prepared for him," he looked at his son and continued, "well, I have more anyway, I just need to protect them and keep them away from you," he said reproachfully.
Severus nodded slowly and withdrew leaving the Dark Lord alone with his thoughts.
Both looked at each other quickly before turning by putting themselves back to the house but also to the others who were storing the brooms in the closet.
asks George enjoying the boy's discomfort.
"We know you're leaving tomorrow. Mom told us because she wants all of us to convince you to stay and spend the rest of the vacation with us," George said.
He hadn’t finished talking when he saw Harry turn his head sharply and open his eyes like plates.
He wouldn't say it out loud, but the truth was that Malfoy's company was nice. He didn't have to be giving him explanations like with Hermione and Ron, but he also didn't accept everything he said at face value before objecting and giving his opinion. It was nice to have someone who didn't praise his actions as the hero they said he was, or who believed him superior to the others. On the contrary, Malfoy looked at him as his equal, he was not surprised by his fame or fortune and that was something he appreciated of him.
"You don't disgust me, Potter, I just wanted to annoy you. But I don’t think this is the time. Besides, I must clarify that I don't hate you, I doubt that I’d ever really hated you. Don’t worry about the memories, they are none of my business. And just so you know, I won't leave! Not till you have calmed down and sleep, the rest can wait.”
"Ginny, are you suggesting I marry you?" he asked surprised.
– Well, I still don't know how I'll help you if all I know is that you've been spying on me. What do you intend Malfoy? –  Harry asked impatiently. He needed to know to understand why the Draco Malfoy in front of him was very different from the Malfoy of Hogwarts; Although he was vaguely aware that it had been more than half an hour before he had left the house. - Come on, Malfoy, I don't have all day." Malfoy stared without changing his expression.
However, Draco only had eyes for the couple in front of them. One of which was supposed to be dead but at the time he was looking at him as if he wanted to grind him to dust or worse to torture him painfully with his hands, especially because of the way he opened and closed his fists as his eyes shone wickedly.
– I never enjoyed hugging my dad and now that I have you... just a little more, please. Besides, there's no one to see us—he knew he'd won when the body beneath him relaxed. He smiled to himself at how easy it was to achieve what he wanted.
Voldemort squirted his eyes dangerously.
Annoyed by her behavior he took Nagini and together they entered the memories. He wouldn't say it out loud, but he wanted to see James again as he remembered him and his little Harry, only a year old.
"What's the matter, man, you can't take it anymore," the twins said.
His neck almost snapped because of the speed in which he turned recognizing the voice. With great amazement, he saw his Godfather coming down the stairs.
– Still, I have to read it, I can't wait. It has to be before I return to the Durley’s tonight.  - Harry ended with regret.
– Not true. I found something, but you were so focused I didn't mean to bother you. I think I found part of the ritual to put the Horcruxes together with the body. Look, he held out the book and then got up to go get some water to the kitchen.
"Moony close your mouth, you’re drooling. I know I’m good looking but don’t exaggerate.
He turned a corner and saw another wretched soul coming at a bad time, but what could he do if they were putting themselves in front of him, rather than taking advantage of it and removing some frustration.
Harry felt his eyes shrink as he saw his father cry like that. He watched Lily kneel and hug her father. They split up a few minutes later.
– Harry, think about it, if...
He closed the door with a spell and let out his tears. Their betrayal ached in his soul, but more when he saw that he was treated as if he were not being handed over to his executioner in a short time.
"Oh no, that hasn't bothered me all summer –
Harry couldn't believe what he heard. His father was in love with another man and they were going to get married!
"It's not that Ginny," he said with despair, "you're only 15 years old, how can you even think about getting pregnant? You won't be able to take care of a baby, and I'm not going to have a child that way. I don't care if the last name is lost with me, I don't want my son to suffer the same as me...– he decided to play a card that he shouldn't even mention but still did – besides, if Voldemort finds out you're expecting a child of mine, it would be like putting a price not only on your head and my son's, but your whole family's and I completely refuse to do something like that. I value your family to have them killed because of my selfishness.
He took a seat on the stool and Professor McGonagall put The Sorting Hat on.
–Please Potter, save her! what do you want me to do? I don't mind humiliating myself more if you help me save my mother." Malfoy looked at him from the ground with begging eyes and he couldn't bear to see that look of pain on his face.He sighed with resignation.
He was wearing tight blue denim trousers and a slightly tight moss-green T-shirt, it was nothing strange.
"Well, I'm glad everyone is here, and where are the others?" he asked while looking around.

"Of course, it's me Harry–Sirius whispered hurt by the rejection of his godson– ask me what you want, and you'll see it's me, but please don't reject me. – he ended begging.
– Dra-Draco – moaned slowly with his eyes closed.
Harry not knowing what to do just proceeded to follow her. What they didn't know was that there were two people listening to everything.
Harry followed the professor, but before he dared to look at the blonde again, and what he saw left him scared and confused. Draco looked at him with contained anger, he had the feeling that if he could kill him with his eyes, he would have done it by now.
"I would have given my life for them," he said, looking away, "I just thought that... after five years I meant something to them”. It ended with tears sliding down his cheeks, tears that he cleaned with fury.
Here is the last chapter for today, Guys. The schedule I have planned will be a chapter every Friday. It can vary but not by much. I will try to keep it as such. See You Next Friday!
His daily routines were strictly followed to the letter and thanks to that he had gained a little weight and muscles. He thanked that his father had given him the potion to correct his sight, or else he would lose every sword duel just for losing his glasses half-workout. He had also learned a lot from Remus and now he was sure that with a little effort he would compete for one of the first places, even with Granger and Draco.
– Blasted
"Certainly, friend, if we knew anything, we would tell you, besides The Order has been very busy. There have been many attacks near Hogsmeade, and they never stay more than a few minutes – and then he added something with some hesitation after looking at Hermione– it even looked like You-Know-Who wants to keep them busy.
– Thank you Dobby. Just one more thing; it's very likely that later we'll have to appear at number 12 Grimmauld Place with Kreacher, but for anything in the world can you tell anyone where I am, let alone with whom, could you do that for me Dobby? – Harry observed by calculating his reaction.
– What I don't know how to explain to him is what really happened with his parents. I have no idea how he'll take it or if he'll understand – He let a sigh slip away.
Sirius didn't think twice and ran out behind Moony with a smile stamped on his face.
Happy Reading!
"I felt the wards vibrate, is it, Harry? –  he asked desperately, looking around quickly.
Harry who was astonished at the way Draco, a Malfoy, was humiliating himself, kneeling in front of a wizard, frowned with annoyance listening to his last words, and interrupted him scandalized.
Severus composed his mask of indifference but inside he could only wonder how the hell the brat had made him treat him like that.
Although he hadn't changed his clothes, he still looked very handsome, he wore her hair without a hair tie, with tufts of platinum blond hair on his forehead adorning his eyes that were closed, allowing Harry to see his long blonde lashes. He watched his nose, then passed to his thin pink lips that from where he was standing looked so appetizing that he wanted to try them. His gaze slipped down his pale neck, his robe was open, he wore a white shirt with the upper buttons open letting him see part of his chest.
"Don't think that about him," he smiled kindly, " You still don’t know Harry enough, but I can assure you he won’t leave you when he is with Hermione and Ron again. – he saw the surprised boy in front of him and hurried to finish before he scurried off – Before you say anything, remember that I am a werewolf and my senses are sharper – he winked at him.
– Tom hissed in warning.
The class passed quietly, half an hour later Weasley and Granger came back, but Harry was not the least bothered, he was enjoying the class. By the end of the class, he had earned 50 points for Slytherin for being the first to transform glass into a beautiful white swan, Draco had been the other student who had made it and they both smiled mockingly at Granger looking at them indignantly and with a red face.
Tom dropped inelegantly into the armchair, totally defeated. He had no point in denying it, he missed his dunderheaded son and wanted to see him as soon as possible. He sighed with resignation, between his son and James he was going crazy.
"Well, not anymore, from now on you'll be Riddle Potter or well when I get James back and we get married. – he said with assuredness.
"Shut up, you filthy mutt," Severus said with annoyance "you heard the Lord, you'll go with me to the Muggle’s house, and Lupin will take care of Potter," he said, walking out, the faster he'd solve that problem, the faster he can come back— I don't have your time, move!
– Well if that’s how it is, then why don't you move into the Mansion. After all, you say you don't think the Dark Lord is looking for you, at least not for the time being. In addition, you would be closer so I could visit, and no one would know – Draco explained with enthusiasm.
"Well, after my statement I only ask for an
"I'll get my trunk” Harry got up and walked up the stairs.
Harry turned around and saw Draco look at him with angry eyes and pointing the wand at him. He was going to talk, but he was interrupted by Nott.
Everyone looked at him surprised and fearful as Harry looked at him in amazement.
After meeting his Death Eaters and planning an attack near Hogsmeade and a couple of other places Tom was left alone with Nagini.
"Looks like someone's in a very good mood today," Draco said, smiling as he pulled a lock off his forehead.
you’ll be disgusted with me and if you know the truth you will hate me" Harry said in a trembling voice.
– Yes Master Harry. Kreacher withdraws– he bowed and disappeared.
He sighed once more, closed the curtains, and sat on the bed. He took the letter in his hands and opened it to reread it as his partner came out of the shower.
He saw the man stop screaming and move on the floor, but he didn't care in the least.
PRONGS hug himself tighter to that boy's neck, settling more on his purring chest again, while that
"Thank you, thank you, thank you," he said, hugging him louder, "we will be a big family and...
Both boys frantically nodded white with terror. The two had fallen on their butts as soon as the howler started. They didn’t breathe till they saw it disintegrate in millions of little pieces. Nobody dared to say anything, till Remus broke the silence.
"Yes Potter, sit down.” He waited for him to take a sit and continued – “The headmaster is concerned about the influence Mr. Malfoy and in general the other Slytherins have over you.” – he said seriously – “He has asked me to keep you under vigil and to retake the lessons in Occlumency.”
He took Harry by the shoulders reversing positions and he placed himself on top.
Tom turned his head towards the snake surprised, it was so simple why hadn’t he thought of it before.
Seconds later they were engaged in a discussion about whether Ron would try a Weasley product kit. The day passed quietly, with jokes from the twins and threats from Mrs. Weasley. After dinner, Harry would prepare to go to sleep but before he reached Ron's room, Ginny left her room and spoke to him.
Harry had an idea what the blonde wanted to talk about, and he felt nervous, but he still nodded.
– Oh come on paddy, I don't know why you're trying to annoy him. You know perfectly well that he’s close to a nervous breakdown since Harry left the mansion—he said rebuking him—if you keep this up, you're going to make Harry mad at you and then I won't comfort you when he doesn't want to talk to you—he said walking into the kitchen—Come on, let’s get some tea and go to sleep, maybe you could use time in some entertainment," he said suggestively.
Lunch passed peacefully, receiving flattery from the purebloods for his excellent table manners, and blushing every time Draco looked at him proudly.
"I don't need anyone but you, Draco," Harry said, kissing his lips again, but this time tenderly demonstrating his love for the blonde.
After a too tense breakfast for their taste, they went out to "have fun". Even though it seemed that they had been in the wrong game, because the one they were playing was "watch Harry" and not a simple Quidditch game.
"Tell me Harry" he took advantage of the state in which the brunette was and held his hip with the other hand.
"Severus," he said slowly, but with an implicit threat that caused the one named to shudder slightly– you'll take me to the Black mansion right now and I don't care if you can't access it, I'll break all the wards of that old fool if necessary and those Weasley better pray that my son is all right because otherwise nothing and nobody will save them form Lord Voldemort’s fury! “
He watched the boy leave and returned his gaze towards his spy.
– Yes Master Harry–. He said with another bow, but this time, less exaggerated. Harry just smiled, that part was already done, now he was just missing …
– What if I do? –  he taunted, broadening his smile seeing how the Malfoy trembled with fury. – After all, it is my right. He is mine.
"Harry," Draco interrupted, fixed his sight on the green eyes that looked at him in query, and approached slowly. “I... you look beautiful," he said, admiring the beauty in front of him.
The twins looked at him seriously with their arms crossed.
Harry lazily opened his eyes and saw the blond dressed and combing his hair.
Draco choked on the pumpkin juice he was drinking and looked at him horrified.
They were all sitting at the table with faces full of sadness, indecision, and above all guilt. Dumbledore had left half an hour ago and had left behind a confusion, without escape. All were mired in unsettling silence, analyzing every word said by the Headmaster of Hogwarts. No one wanted to make the first move and the silence had already become unbearable.
Remus smiled understanding what had the boy in that state, he turned around to look at the boy.
Severus looked at him with confusion and blinked a couple of times, but he still nodded.
Harry nodded and began climbing the stairs with Draco after him, leaving behind his uncles and cousin but remembered his cousin's look and looked back just to see how he ate Draco's eyes. He stopped suddenly and gave his cousin a furious look, snarling me menacingly.
– Let him go! Don't you dare hurt him because I'll kill you – Draco screamed, trying to free himself from the spell – and you, godfather, how could you?
Hiya Guys, as promised, here is the second chapter for today. The next one will be next Sunday.
Severus winced in disgust but did not deny it.
(See the end of the chapter for
He immediately got up off the couch as he watched Harry wrangle on the couch with his front and neck covered in sweat, his face had a rictus of pain. Draco knelt in front of him and touched his cheek, the brunette was burning with fever. He was panicking, He had to wake him up as soon as possible.
– Of course not godfather, how could you think that. Harry's just my friend, we're not...
He knew that the insolent brat was awake listening to everything and because he didn't want any more arguments with his Moony because of the oxygenated guy, he would tune down his jokes. He received a growl in response and smiled smugly.
"Apparently there's someone who's finally going to keep you inline since not even Remus, Dumbledore or myself couldn’t – he said happily – from what I see, I think he was the only one who also kept James in line. What I would give to have seen that – he kept laughing.
When he looked up, he was someone else, someone Draco would be proud of if he saw him judging by Fred and George's surprise face. He decided that in that game they could all play, so he hid his feelings under a mask of joy that he could hardly feel there and sat down for breakfast with all the Weasleys as if he knew nothing.
"I thought you would be throwing a tantrum for having to be Potter's bodyguard, what's going on, Draco? – Snape knew something weird was going on with his godson and wouldn't stop until he found out.
"Stay with me just for tonight and if you want tomorrow you can ask Kreacher to fix you a room – he turned his gaze to the bed – The bed is very big and I promise I won't kick you.
Harry feeling the contact of something wet on his skin woke up, woke up, overwhelmed, and turned to Draco instantly.
He got rid of his hug gently and looked Harry in the eye. He wiped his tears and took him out of the room by the hand.
“You’re scared– it was an affirmation and he saw a faint blush in his lover.
"But look who it is, the
(See the end of the chapter for
He stopped suddenly when he almost collided with Severus.
"This can't be happening to me– he massaged the bridge of his nose – Draco please think. You know Potter is the son of the Dark Lord, what do you think will happen to you if he realizes you like his son and you want to sleep with him. Even Dumbledore wouldn’t be able to save you.
"I think your brother's right, but we can talk in the living room," Harry said indecisively.
"Will you really do that?" he asked with amazement.
Harry blushed and covered himself in the robe, which only provoked giggles.
and if remember correctly you still have a few left to see, which makes me think that you will.
– Enough! –  Tom said, his annoyance rising.
When he heard someone banging in the door, he let a "come in" as he got up impatiently from his chair. But he looked with confusion at Severus who had come alone and asked.
He smiled covertly seeing both of the boy's eyes shine.
When he finished speaking, he looked with fascination at the faces of shame and pain.
Harry was about to follow her when he heard Hermione.
AUTHOR: VampirePrincess27
– Tell him there's going to be an attack in... mmmm – he pondered for few seconds – can't be near Little Whinging because they could look for Potter and that would cause me problems... near the School either because that could lead them to Potter again... nor Hogsmeade because there were already attacks there," he said with one finger on his chin,-  ah! I know.! Tell him it's going to be near Diagon Alley, I'll send some Death Eaters there to get attention. But the most important thing is that you get something out of the old man," he said feeling satisfied, lying on the back of the couch.
Remus was going to nag at him for not taking things seriously, but the protest died on his lips when he felt a wet tongue running around his neck, and without thinking, he put his hand on scrambled hair getting closer to him. He heard a shocked giggle for a second before they sucked the side of his collarbone.
"Of course he won't, he's just worried, or I hope," he replied doubtfully, "anyway, I don't think they're more painful than the ones he sent when he actually wanted to kill me. Anyway, I must go, or they’ll suspect something is going on and the last thing I need now is Hermione breathing down my neck.
"Potter, you are an insolent brat. !!HOW DARE YOU STOOD ME UP AND LET ME WAIT LIKE AN IDIOT. Oh, but this won’t go unpunished, you’ll see when we see each other. Nobody disobeys Lord Voldemort and YOU least of all. Another thing you had from James, but that doesn’t matter now. DON’T YOU HAVE A BRAIN? HOW DARE YOU LEAVE ALONE TO THE GOOD FOR NOTHING WEASLEYS? You cannot trust anyone. USE YOUR HEAD IF YOU HAVE ONE! And YOU, DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY BLACK, YOU DON’T HAVE ONE EITHER! HOW COULD YOU LET HIM LEAVE ALONE? IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE INCONSIDERATE POTTER THE CRUCIATUS CURSE WON’T BE ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF YOU. I want to see you in three days AND YOU BETTER NOT COME WITH ANOTHER PATHETIC EXCUSE OR I will find you and cruciate your as.. -cough- BODIES TILL UNCONCIOSNESS. Understand?
He saw a large group of Slytherins with Draco in the center giving orders, he smiled and made his way towards him. He passed between the boys and girls and planted a grand kiss on his lips leaving them all amazed.
When he finished breakfast he excused himself to go upstairs to fix his clothes and nodded to Hermione when she told him she would come up in a while to give him a book she had bought for him.
"My lord.” He cleared his throat – I have it ready, I was going to come and show you what I found yesterday; but first, I wanted to find Draco to know if he had entered the Black’s manor. – he gave him the scroll with the information.
"But Moony...–the only answer he got was the werewolf slamming the door when he left the room.
Harry watched them for a few seconds weighing the veracity of his words, but since he found nothing he had to give up. He turned around and went up the stairs to his room.
and well, hasn't the Headmaster been here? I wanted to talk to him–he was quick to add when he saw Hermione's look of suspicion and Ron's frightened eyes.
– I'm aware of your rivalry, but I don't care about that. You'll follow my orders and make friends with Potter until he trusts you blindly. Understood?. – he threatened.
*Insert Pikachu meme* Dun Dun Dun. OMG. So many things happened in this chapter. I am fangirling so much! Guys, Harry is… and James was…. *Runs away*
Harry felt like they were already stepping on dangerous ground and knew there had to be a change of conversation before something happened, except Ron got ahead of him.
Harry let out a sigh and closed his eyes for a moment.
"Father, I know you have to go," he said, looking at him, "but first I wanted to talk to all of you about something I thought," he said, looking at them.
"Relax Ron, I'd would’ve thought the same –

He lifted him up in his arms and took him to his room.
An hour later he was bored so he asked Kreacher for help in fixing and cleaning the Mansion for when Remus arrived. At the time he was finishing up the living room but he was so sweaty and dirty that he preferred to take a shower so he could wait for the blond and they could eat together.
– Yes Aunt Petunia, but don't worry, we just came to pick up my stuff. It won't take long," he said indifferently.
had only given you half an hour, but this is important – his expression passed in a second from being indifferent to one of complete despair as well as his voice. "My father is locked up in Azkaban... I know you're not interested—he hastened to continue before I replicated—but for whom I am here for is my mother—He looks straight into Harry's eyes and spat rapidly— The Dark Lord took my mother! – he sighed - As payment for my father's mistakes."
He shook his head and proceeded to keep it in his robe just like the letter. He didn't know what it contained, but if his parents left it for him then it was very valuable, and he wouldn’t risk shrinking it.
Harry walked towards the door and knocked. He took a breath of air and smiled kindly when Mrs. Weasley opened the door for him.
– Certainly Malfoy, but this information is very personal and... I'd like to see it first before anyone else finds out the truth.
Griphook,
All that longing and pain for being himself the executioners, it turned to anger when he remembered how they had been separated. In his room, nothing had been saved from his fury and right then he swore to find and take revenge on those who had dared to separate him from his only love.
The three expectant listeners blinked in confusion, looking at each other with surprise until a second later Sirius let out a loud laugh as he clapped, causing others to laugh with him.
Draco looked him right in the eye before answering.
“Yes Professor” on the way to the stairs he received looks of surprise, anger, betrayal, sorrow, pity, and some smiles of encouragement.
with all his might to look in the direction of the blond he knew had his eyes nailed to him, like all other students.
Harry was tired. It had been several days since he had returned from the Burrow and had spoken to his father. Every day he received letters from the twins or messages through coins with news about change of plans, visits from the director, sneaky conversations from his "friends" or just jokes.
"I think it's best for all of us to go to rest," Remus said, seeing young Malfoy wanting to kill someone, preferably Sirius, and he couldn't allow it if he didn't want Harry to be upset.
"All right," Tom replied, ignoring the reference to his person, "if you're sure, I'll support you in what I can, it's also an excellent idea.” He looked at Severus and added. “I'll talk to all my Death Eaters who have children in Hogwarts so they know about our relationship, so you'll be more protected, but you mustn’t let down your guard, let alone around that crazy old man," he said seriously.
Malfoy was interrupted by the sound of an apparition that was heard right in the kitchen.
"He's gone for a couple of hours," he saw his pup’s disappointment with amusement – "But he said he would be back for dinner"— the illusion in Harry's eyes was something worth betraying over, even if he had to betray Dumbledore himself and the whole Order. "It seems he still needs to give some orders.”
"o-of course, m-my lord– he cleared his throat before continuing – I will apparate as close as the wards let me.
Ginny didn't look him in the eye, but quite the opposite, she had them nailed to the ground.
"Well if you don't want to tell us no problem, but if you ever have a question or want a consultation, we will be happy to help you," they said, laughing with rascality.
Remus laughed with amusement, finding this guy with his guard down would be hard. Until this moment, he only saw him lower his defenses when he was with Harry.
Tom silenced him with his hand, but it was too late. Everyone had been shocked after he heard it.
“You won't... I thought...– stuttered Harry disappointed.

– Same old Potter. You don't know how to dress properly –
In the end, they had decided that they would stay in the house to avoid unnecessary risks. In addition, Severus had told him that the Headmaster had received a letter from Lupin saying that he had already sent the entire school list to Harry and that he did not need to leave his uncles' house until the first of September; needless to say, the Headmaster was quite satisfied. The chosen ones were Severus and Sirius, who returned in less than three hours with both lists stocked.
When he returned to the room, he found Harry lying on one side of the bed covered up to his neck, and smiled. It was the greatest temptation he had ever seen. He walked slowly to the bed and looked at the brunette for a moment before lifting the sheets and going into bed.
“Harry Potter retract from what you said!” -  Hermione said shocked.
"We will not return to Hogwarts," they said together.
"You may be right, but the most important thing is that things will be faster now," the woman said with security.
– Perfect Kreacher. Could you come back for me early tomorrow? - And since he was at it he could find out if what Malfoy told him was true, - and before you come back for me, I need you to investigate where Narcissa Malfoy is and with whom."
"it’s alright Herm I am fine– He looked at Ron who had been behind Hermione and asked Merlin and all the Wizards that they didn’t betray him.
– Dobby! – Draco screamed with desperation.
He sighed and turned on the grass looking up at the sky. He recalled the day they had been left alone after several days, as Sirius was always present in his etiquette classes overseeing his progress and adding comments here and there.
– Kreacher believes that Master Harry may appear directly at the mansion because it now belongs to him, but if the master has doubts Kreacher can take him with him and appear in front of the mansion's fireplace."
When the door opened and the headmaster came out, Harry came across a look that showed concern, he assumed it was fake just like the others.
Voldemort and Severus looked at him in amazement.
He was trembling with excitement when he poured the last memory. He wanted to know how they had fared in their adventure. Before bowing down to see the last memory he made a mental note of searching the library for that book to read it as soon as possible because the truth is that he didn’t know what a Horcrux was.
"With regard to that..." Harry twisted his hands nervously. “I have a plan to keep me away from Granger and Wesley. He saw the surprise in their eyes when he used the last names to refer to his old friends.

"You have no idea how delicious you look when you blush," Draco said, stroking both cheeks. “Harry, I think we should talk about this.”
– Harry don't be afraid; I wanted your friendship from a young age and I won't lose it to nonsense. Please believe me, you would never disgust me because you are beautiful – He watched the brunette blush and stroke his cheek – and you won't get rid of me so quickly either. From now on I will be your shadow and your comfort.
"What are you going to do now that you know?" asks Tom, trying to catch the boy's gaze.
– You're welcome Malfoy. Just don't try to play with me, because if you do, Voldemort will look like an innocent puppy next to me. Malfoy let out a little laugh that to Harry, who had never heard it, seemed like the most beautiful sound he could hear.
"Come in," he saw his protégé come in and smiled kindly,” Ah Severus, thank you for coming so fast. I won't take that long but take a seat my boy”- he waited and then continued after Severus had taken a seat – I'd like to know what you've found out about Harry, I'm worried about him.”
"Potter, they will be your roommates, Blaise Zabini, Draco Malfoy, and Theodore Nott," he said, looking at them one by one.
– Come on. I'll show you – he took him by the hand, and they went up together to the room where he left the pensieve.
"Could you do that Draco?" asked the hopeful brunette, turning to him.
Everyone kept looking at the stairs with their eyes and mouth open except Nagini who had rolled up in a corner to rest a little mouse she had found.
The elf climbed the steps being closely followed by Malfoy.
Voldemort let out a sigh of exasperation. His snake was crazy, that he already knew, but he wasn’t there for nonsense.
Harry felt his stomach churn but showed nothing more than what was expected of him in this situation.
He got up and went to the kitchen for some water while he enjoyed the blonde's reaction to the knowledge of Harry’s scrutiny. Returning to the room he found Harry speaking to Remus while he leaned on the blonde’s shoulders. He made a grimace but still went and sat next to him.
"I think you shouldn't worry, I doubt that Severus will take it out on you and you won't personally deliver the message to Voldemort," he smiled halfway through knowing who would take the punishment.
Before he gets up, Snape came in and handed him his new schedule.
"You're right, Harry, we'd do it for you too," they said, and they both looked at each other before they nodded.
"Thank you, guys, for everything – he hugged them before standing next to Kreacher.
Harry Discovers the Truth
"Harry," Draco began insecurely after watching the owl leave, "can we talk?" he asked seriously.
Harry nodded and went up the stairs. He dropped into his bed to sort out his ideas and see how he would get to the Leaky Cauldron without doing magic and how could he get into Grimmauld Place. He did not know if there would be protections that would prevent him from entering, or if on the contrary upon entering there would be some kind of alarm that would alert the Order or Dumbledore.
He heard the elf disappear and soon after felt him place the protections around the room. He sighed, opened the book, and began to devour it. He would never accept it but that mudblood and he were alike in some ways.
"I know Potter, but the Headmaster doesn't have to know," he smirked- "I'll see you three times a week. You can bring your homework, books, magazines, or whatever you want to pass the time” – he got up – “You may leave, we start next week”.
"Better than okay," he said, smiling.
– Draco – Harry whispered burying his head in the hollow of Malfoy Jr.'s neck.
– Good Harry. I came on leave before Christmas, I only came for a few days then I go back to Romania, there's a lot of work," he said, kindly.
"I'm not small!" he frowned- “Perfect! He believed everything I said,' he smirked.
A menacing growl came out of the Dark Lord's throat, immediately shutting Severus.
"Of course, Harry, take care” he looked at Malfoy and he nodded. “Malfoy.”
Tom raised his right hand in the direction of the house and with his palm outstretched uttered a spell in parseltongue, where, to his satisfaction, he saw the number 12 appear among the other houses. He smiled proudly as he delivered the next spell, and to Severus' astonishment, a large number of woven silver threads appeared, like a huge web covering the entire mansion.
–You should not worry Sir. Dobby will keep the secret of Harry Potter as his own."
There was too much distance between them and that was something he wasn't going to let happen.
Greetings everyone. TGIF am I right? all thought with quarantine the days don't matter much anymore. *cries* ANYWAYS! We come to enjoy fanfiction to escape that, NO? so enough about that. Enjoy the chapter.
Draco went to the closet and talked to Harry over his shoulder.
"My lord, I haven't tried my luck at Black Mansion, but by chance, I found Potter near Diagon Alley and tried to start a conversation with him, but he threatened me with his wand and I had to...– but fortunately he was interrupted by the Lord before he continued to lie.
–Hello Harry – he spoke softly.
“Draco” he moaned softly.
– Is something wrong? He just gave me the mission yesterday; he doesn’t expect it done already. And by for your expression Severus, I think something is going on – he said with caution.
he hissed with annoyance.
Without waiting for an answer, he took Draco by the hand and led the way towards the door. They rang the bell a couple of times before his aunt Petunia’s horse face appeared.
"Harry, we really thank you for everything you've done for our family," they said together, "for worrying about Ron in freshman year, for saving Ginny in the second, for saving Dad a few months ago and forever being there for us but...

"To hand you over to the dark lord," they said together, staring at him without expression on their faces.
Voldemort didn’t listen to him; he was focused on the feeling he had.
"I'm well Professor, don't worry," Harry answered slightly embarrassed.
Draco was still embarrassed, so he just took his things and muttered a "Goodnight" before heading towards his room.
Tom was about to come to the door when he heard a person running after him and knowing who he was stopped, but he was surprised when something small hit him and clung to his back.
"Of course, my lord," he said with some obeisance, " – and with what pretext would I present myself to the Headmaster?
Suddenly the snake raised its head sniffing the air with its tongue and then turned towards him. Draco was paralyzed for a few seconds before clearing his throat and asking if he could come in. He received a nod from the snake and that made him feel less stupid and less nervous. He approached the bed slowly and before sitting e looked at the snake with indecision before daring to ask.
He shook his head, what the hell he was thinking.
Harry carefully closed the letter and kept it, thinking how strange the clause about not telling anyone was. He had considered telling the director, but that would be risking losing the information and that was something that could not be afforded, especially if it served to defeat Voldemort, although he was not sure about that.
– Oh yes, the weasel and the know-it-all, took you long enough to contact them, Potter. In fact, I don't understand how they're not here with you if you’re inseparable," he said sternly.
– No Harry. Just because you carry his blood doesn't mean you're the same as him. I've known you since I was 11, and I know you couldn't hurt anyone. You're not and you're never going to be like him, and I'm not going to let that torment you, did you hear me? - the blonde ended up decisively.
was supposed to
Ron looked at her a little hesitant yet, but in the end, he gave in.
Nagini was furious as she glided out of the room, but before she left, she turned her head and glared at Tom.
He turned and nodded in the direction of another elf, seconds later a goblin appeared in front of him who asked him the letter for verification to which harry handed over immediately.
Harry had seen it coming, so he wasn't even amazed. The friendship of his godfather, Remus, and his father went beyond any other, so much so that it reminded him of Ron and himself.
"I didn't need to know that Draco–he winced in disgust and continued – it’s up to you what you're doing with your private life, but now it's time to leave, the Lord is waiting for us – he walked towards the door and added – a little advice before we leave. No matter what, do not question him. He is very … let’s just say he isn’t in a good mood. I'll wait for you downstairs, don’t take long.” He closed the door on his way out.
He knew he had to cross a few words with his obligated hosts, but he wanted to see his son sleep for a few more minutes.
Harry lowered his gaze, feeling his eyes burn with new tears, and shook his head slowly. Remus and Draco gave Sirius a glare while the latter hugged the brunette.
Harry walked to him and took him by the cheeks.
He gave a frustrated sigh. All he wanted to tell him was that he already knew, but he wanted to see how far the oxygenated blonde endured jealousy before declaring himself to Harry. He went out the door looking for Remus to apologize.
– What's going on, guys? I was looking for...
The blonde noticed that Harry had woken up since he first touched him and smiled with satisfaction when he saw his arm hair curling, so he decided to punish him a little for trying to trick him. He approached his ear slowly and whispered in a silky voice.
"Let go of my godson, you perverted blond! " he snatched him from the other’s arms and squeezed him against his chest possessively – don't put your dirty hands on him again or I'll blow you back to Malfoy Mansion and you'll be eaten by Thestrals.
"Draco, I'm fine– he got up taking his glasses – This happens to me regularly especially when...
Harry fell asleep at about the same time his head touched Draco's comfortable legs. He watched him sleep, stroking his cheeks and playing with his hair, even though he also felt tired he couldn't help but start thinking about the turn that things would take from now on. He was nervous, he felt that his chance with Harry would fade if they didn't accept him because they were more important to the brunette than he was and worst of all he couldn't blame him if he decided to put him aside.
– Harry Potter Sir. "He bowed and disappeared.
"I'm sure he'll want to know how my day went and whether I've gotten information from you or the others," he said, going that direction.
in the world won't be enough to punish you,” And finally he gave him a fleeting kiss on his forehead.
The streets were buzzing with people shopping, walking in and out of the bank, or walking with their families so that no one had qualms about that handsome boy with brown hair and hazel eyes who looked at the Gringotts Bank that stood imposing before him fascinated.
– That doesn't matter now. I'm going to change. After, could you accompany me to the library? I’d like you to help me with something if you have nothing else planned of course? - Harry ended up insecure.
"Excuse me, my lord – he manages to articulate when he got up – it will never happen again – he looked him right in the eye and added, "I hope you will understand me if I tell you that I just wanted to make sure you didn't hurt Potter.
“I think it is time to retract a decision I made five years ago, and it is essential to correct that mistake. Many changes are coming and this is just one of them. Harry Potter... after five years we meet again.
"Harry," he said, looking at them, "I'm Harry.
Greetings guys. Here is another chapter for you to enjoy. Sorry for missing the update last week.
Harry looked at the group behind Weasley and Granger and saw confusion and annoyance in their eyes. He did not answer, he merely looked at Ron who looked at him with rage.
you mean...– Draco was confused.
Sirius's face turned red, but his answer remained on his lips.
– Well, I think you'd be safer here than in that place and if what's stopping you is the lack of company, well... I could stay with you for the days you have left before you go with the Weasleys. If you want to of course. Besides, don't worry about me, without my mother and father in the mansion, I don't feel like being alone either.
– "Kreacher do you know if I can enter the mansion by appearing inside or do I have to come and go in through the door?
Draco knew what was waiting for him and so he tried to run away from what would be a very unpleasant interrogation.
Exhausted he dropped back into his armchair, though he still had to think what he was going to do with the son James had with that filthy mudblood.
– Will you stay with me? –  he asked in a whisper.
He kept up with those increasingly depressing thoughts until he felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up.
Harry let out a laugh and shook his head.
– You don't have to carry the load on your own, please trust me, Harry. I don't know what you discovered in that letter or what you saw in that pensive, but if they don't appreciate your friendship, let me be the one to support you and helps you with everything that you want.  Give me a chance Harry, let me be your friend and you'll see that I won't let you down – his tone of voice ended up being pleading, but he couldn't care less if Harry agreed.
"Oh guys, we didn't know you were here, everyone’s already asleep.” They looked seriously at Ginny –“You aren’t doing anything improper, right Ginny?
"You didn’t give it too much importance?!" Draco exclaimed incredulously.
"No," he shook his eyes, "no, no, no, no, no, this has to be a joke," a sob, "NO! – he screamed with all his might, hitting the ground with his fists, hoping that the physical pain distracted him from the pain in his heart.
He knew that no matter where Nagini was, she’d listen to his orders.
"Sorry Draco, I didn't think it was so important to you that I gave you my trust. And you're right, the burden they've put on my shoulders is too much and I can't just do it, but I feel like I can't trust anyone, not even Ron and Hermione. I'm afraid that when they know what I've discovered they will hate and repudiate me. I wouldn’t be able to handle that Draco, they are my only friends, the only ones who have shown me affection and I don't want to lose them – Harry was crying when he finished talking.
– Don't call her that! Her name is Lily Evans," he smiled maliciously, adding – or Potter, she is still Mrs. Potter – her father's growl made him smile widely.
Sirius raised his eyes to the lycanthrope and sigh.
– I still don't know if I can believe you or not, but for the moment I'll give you the benefit of the doubt." Harry let out a little sigh and continued. - The time is up, I have to go back, or I'll have more trouble, but I'll see you tomorrow in the Leaky Cauldron at noon."
"Goodbye and thank you," he said, watching him disappear.
"I'm just here to tell you that dinner will be served soon" - he looked at Harry and asked - "Do you feel better Pup?
Harry," Theo said with amusement.
that he had returned to the Death Eaters
"I'm sorry, that's what happens when you spend the whole summer locked in a room," he said with a half-smile, "but when I get back on my game you will end up worse than me – he added with sufficiency.
The Lord was standing in front of the chimney but turned as soon as he heard the door open. He walked before standing in front of his guest, waited for the usual courtesies, and then spoke.
Malfoy chokes on his own saliva and dries his throat as he watched Potter move his hips as his eyesight was lost on his ass.
Vocabulary
– Where is Young Malfoy? Why didn't you bring him with you? – he felt like he was starting to feel upset.
hissed distractedly without looking at the snake.
"Ah, hello P-Potter," he said, blushing, "the Headmaster asked me to let you know he'll be waiting for you in his office," he said nervously, staring at Draco.
"Harry... I – but was interrupted by a few gentle taps on the door " Come in."
– On the other hand, I want you to investigate how to get my old appearance back. I need to get my human traits back as soon as possible, and you are the only one who can accomplish that. Now, take your leave, ill call you when I need you.
Harry fell to his knees to the ground in shock. He didn’t even notice when he was thrown out of the pensieve. He laid on his knees on the hard ground with a perturbed gaze. He didn’t’ know he stood like that until he felt his cheeks moisten and he lowered his gaze watching his tears fall uncontrollably. This had to be a nightmare, he couldn’t be the son of that, t-that… monster.
Translator's Notes
– Sirius stop. You're going to do something silly," he said undecidedly.
a chance, but if things don't go well and he... he doesn't want to hear from me–he closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and he said with regret staring at them—then I will fulfill my mission as the chosen one.
Once he was sure the Headmaster was no longer in the office he sighed with relief and relaxed, but it didn't last too long.
SPOILER ALERT(not really): Could contain grammatical and/or minor tense errors.
He was so upset that he was inadvertently throwing everything in his reach against the door until it opened revealing Remus behind it, who just had enough time to lower his head to evade a jar that was going straight towards his face.
– Ok we'll do it your way. But I’m telling you right now that I will be very close in case things don’t go well.” his tone left no room for argument.
"Actually, very little, almost nothing," he said, "What is a fact is that the boy is too depressed about Black though showing otherwise and from what I've seen things with the Slytherins are going well.”
At that very moment, many miles away in an abandoned and old house, the most powerful dark wizard ever known received an anonymous letter that would change the course of his life and many others.
Remus gave a complicit smile to both and went after Sirius.
Harry Potter lay in his room at number 4 Privet Drive, being punished as was common, after the death of his godfather. Although his punishment was recent, he did not feel the difference since he had spent the time since he came back from Hogwarts without leaving his room. Only to do the chores around the house, eat, and go to the bathroom. The only difference was that now he was forbidden to eat for the rest of the holiday, which would last two more weeks; but that was no problem for him because he had the brilliant idea of changing a few
– I received a letter from him a few days ago asking to be here today at 2 in the afternoon. I do not know the reason why he asked to see me. – he conveniently avoided saying his name.
He had forgotten that Malfoy would wait for him nearby to prevent something like the day before from happening, so he was surprised to see him reclining on the wall in front of the door. Apparently, he hadn't noticed that he had opened the door and seizing the opportunity presented to him, he stared at the blonde in front of him.
Two hours later the room looked tidier and a bag of clothes lay on his just-made bed. He grabbed his wand and a bag of galleons he kept in his pants without forgetting his inseparable invisibility cloak.
– Look, Draco, if it will make thing easier for you, we'll make sure Potter doesn't bother you and so on...
– Come closer – he ordered.
"It's not what you think," Harry said, taking a hesitant step," let me explain.
He passed his wand over his wound and proceeded to open the box. It was lined in red and gold velvet. Inside were four transparent glass jars that clearly contained memories. He watched them for a few seconds and then I call Kreacher.
-Don’t be mad Siri, the thing is that Draco’s chest is very soft," Harry said, rubbing his eyes.
– Guys! I almost had a heart attack," he replied lowering his wand.
Draco turned around, approaching the brunet and hugging him from behind. Harry was astonished, but immediately turned and clung to the Slytherin's chest as the blond stroked his back. He soon fell asleep soundly.
Here is chapter two. Enjoy! XD
"That's better," Tom said, focusing his attention on Harry.
Harry was still smiling when he left the
(See the end of the chapter for
– Remus is on his way; we'd better go to breakfast. What do you think,
"Enough Draco, ignore him," Harry said, clutching the blonde's arm, "Now that I'm no longer with them and they're not famous, they'll look for fame another way," he saw the redhead red with shame and smiled with satisfaction.
found
"Thank you, father, I know how hard it is to get the ingredients for the potion," he said, smiling, "then I'll see you tomorrow."
Draco knew that his godfather was chasing him, but he didn’t think he would go that far to know, that’s why he cursed his own stupidity when he felt the characteristic pull of an apparition.
"I have to acknowledge the fact that Dumbledore protects Potter with everything," Tom said, feeling the magic signatures in the different spells that were weaving around the mansion.
Draco swallowed saliva and nodded.
– Ginny, how can you say that? By Merlin, you're only 15 years old! Not to mention the fact that your parents and siblings would skin me alive, besides...
There was nothing but darkness, but that didn't bother him; what bothered him was that crazy sound. He didn't know why Nagini didn't take care of that annoyance. Against his will, he opened his eyes and immediately regretted it, the light coming from the window hurt his eyes and cursing under his breath moved his hand closing the curtains with violence. But the sound became more insistent, so he had no other choice than to get up.
– Sirius! Thanks to Merlin, I thought I had dreamed it all– he walked the remaining distance and hugged his Godfather tightly.
"If you haven't felt the pain of losing a father and you haven’t had to fight not to see them die then you don’t know what I am talking about. – he saw his intention to reply and decided to shut him up before he did it with his fits – Besides, I’m not willing to fight in a war were at the end people are going to stick with the same ideals: the good guys and the bad guys, the Aurors, and the Deatheaters; those ideals have to end. – He gave them a serious look before he continued – if I let myself be guided by vengeance then I would’ve killed Voldemort. After all, both the Muggles and Wizards have turned their backs on me when I needed them the most, or have you forgotten the mistreatment I’ve suffered since I got home from my uncles or the criticism and sneering I endured all year when everyone took me for being mentally unbalanced or someone who only seeks fame; if I decided to play the role of judge and say “They asked for it” then I would have ended half of the wizards and muggles; and my uncles. – he finished really ticked off.
Draco was going to ask him how he felt, but he saw his scar and was horrified.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Be very careful of what you do Draco – he threatened and then let out a sigh of frustration – the Lord wants you to protect Potter and not cause him harm–he ended up in a serious tone.
"Well guys, it's time for dinner," Molly said, walking through the door with a big cauldron full of food.
"Thank you, Draco, – Harry whispered around the blonde's neck, causing a shudder in the Slytherin.
Harry thought he would find Dumbledore or the minister breaking into his house, but he never thought of seeing such a handsome guy accompanying Severus. The shock was clear on their faces, everyone wondered who that handsome man was. Harry, curious to know who he was began to approach him. He had a certain familiar air that was intriguing to him. Without being aware he had come closer than he initially wanted, but he stood up short when he saw the man's mocking smile. In short, he was sure he knew him from somewhere.
Severus intuiting the same and not wanting to be greeted by a couple of crucio’s explained rapidly.
– he observes the expression of bewilderment on Potter's face and rolls his eyes – it's not just any book Potter. Books of black magic are not only dangerous because of their content but they are dangerous themselves! If you don't know how to fight their influence you can end up being manipulated by them, crazy or dead – He explained seriously, making it clear that it wasn't a game.
Remus smiled pleased at the attitude of Lucius' son and after calming Sirius he approached Harry hesitantly.
Severus had arrived early to perform the spell that would allow him to recover his body and after performing it and taking the potion he remembered nothing.
"Enough guys, you both know its not like that – Remus saw them looked at each other but they immediately turned away from each other. – you are behaving like children and you aren’t, so, please… - but at that moment a huge black hawk entered the kitchen and landed on the table, knocking most of the food of it. They looked at each other in astonishment.
Kreacher smiled with malice upon hearing the voice of his new master. If He didn’t know, He’d have thought he was quite a Slytherin, he wouldn't stop at anything or anyone else to get what he wanted. He nodded and disappeared with a
"Wait, did he write one for me?" He took the letter from Remus excitedly, but if he thinks I am...–but he was interrupted by Remus.
"Do not worry, I’ll take care of it," he replied with conviction.
"Or cry with her," they said slowly.
Draco took it undecided.
Harry sighed understanding what the blonde meant. He knew they were right on one hand, but he couldn’t dispute those arguments, he was too tired and all he wanted was to sleep. He hated being tired all the time.
Tom was silent as everyone discussed the pros and cons, but he had already made the decision.
– Twins? –  interrupted Draco in disbelief, sitting on the bed and looking at Harry.
"Hi Harry," she said, looking at the others, "could I talk to you for a moment?
"Just let me rest with you a little longer," Harry said as he leaned more towards Draco's warm hand, "and I don't want to repeat it again, I'd rather wait for my godfather and Remus if you don't mind," he said uncertainly.
Harry took a hand to his scar and stained his fingers with blood. He quickly took a dry cloth and pressed hard to stop the bleeding.
Malfoy looked at him first with surprise and then confusion.
"I'm sorry to tell you that you're wrong, Malfoy, the letters aren’t for them, they don't even know I'm not with the Dursleys. If they knew, they would have told Dumbledore where I am and I'm sure they would have found a way to force me back with them. but what I have to do is very important and dangerous to waste my time, so I will do it alone, after all...– Harry stares at him deciding whether or not to trust Malfoy.
Harry pulled him closer, gladly receiving that mischievous tongue that searched for a playmate. When they split up, Harry smiled at him.
– Don't worry about that, Harry, I can handle Severus. Now let's get your stuff and get out of here.
“I missed you all day”
Harry looked up with annoyance, his day was going so well that he didn't want to spoil it.
He jumped up and began to circle around the room as a plan was forming in his mind. An hour later the plan was ready to be carried out, but he had to hurry before nightfall. All that was missing was who He would call first, but he thought the sooner he knew if he could count on him, the better. So, with that decided he stood in the middle of the room and I called:
Tom didn't want his son to have any misunderstandings, so gently, nothing worthy of a Dark Lord, but yes from a father, he lifted the kid’s chin and looked at his eyes.
Harry was oblivious to what was happening around him, the only thing he could think of was his father hugging him of his own free will for the first time, so he did what every son does when his father embraces him: he returned the hug.
Harry laughed covertly. He liked seeing his father irritated.
"Severus Snape," his aunt said with contempt as he felt Draco become tense, "I just told him that you'd gone to the house you’d inherited since yesterday morning," she ended up nervously.
"Oh darling, I should say, more than well! – he arrived in the living room and sat down -everything was too easy, everyone has a little bit of darkness in them – he said with certainty. – and they aren’t the exception, besides, I knew how to handle well they ones that could give me trouble.
"Katie and Angelina", Harry muttered with his eyes on the floor.
The twins looked at each other before nodding. They took him by the shoulders and drove him back to the room.
He felt everyone's eyes on his back until he couldn't stand it anymore and had to come down pretending tired.
– Yes, my lord.
Then he understood.
Voldemort read it greedily and smiled with satisfaction at the fact that it was relatively simple and did not require much time.
Harry rolled his eyes but said nothing.
He said goodbye to Harry and disappeared into the Malfoy mansion.
Draco didn't even flinch. If Harry didn't get here soon, he'd go out looking for them at that moment and bring him in chains if necessary. Luckily for both, it was not necessary as at that time Severus came in followed by Harry and his belongings.
to help me," He saw the perplexity in everyone's face and the bright smile on his son's face. He let out a low growl –" Stop with that silly smile Potter; We will see who’s laughing at the end". He saw his son's smile widen and he look at him ignoring the attention others were giving them, "You'll see how
"Guys, you don't know what this means to me," he said, looking at them one by one, "but I can't give you the explanations you want," he said, lowering his head.
“Harry? – Asked Dumbledore, looking at the hat.
"We'd better hurry, I don't think the Lord likes to be kept waiting," he said as he chose Harry's clothes, "I'll pick your clothes and leave them on the bed, then I'll go get dressed," he turned around with the outfit in his hands and placed it on the bed.
He wore black trousers and a white shirt with gold details and closing the ensemble, a green Slytherin robe with the same details as the shirt at both cuffs.
The elf nodded and disappeared.
"Father exaggerated when he sent me clothes," he said, scratching his head in shame, "it's best if I change.”
When they came down, the adults waited for them with cups of tea in the room. Draco and Harry took their seats in front of the adults.
He looked at the guys in the back and nodded. He turned around and went out with his trunk floating after him. He was so upset that he did not realize that Ron had followed him until he felt the magic vibrate and directed towards him. He didn't have time to raise a shield and closed his eyes waiting for an impact that never came. He opened his eyes in amazement and saw the professor in front of him with the wand raised.
Tom mentally thanked the boy for having his eyes nailed to the ground or else he would have to hide his surprise and shut his mouth.
– You don't understand Potter. I don't mean you're not able to read some black magic. I mean
The next morning almost everyone was ready and in the dining room for breakfast, the only one missing was Harry. They heard footsteps on the stairs and turned their heads, the adults released an exclamation when they saw it, but Draco was breathless. Harry was just irresistible.
– Been a long time in the Mansion and you still don't learn what privacy is. What do you want? -  he was irritated by the scare.
“Yes Professor, otherwise I would not bother you.”
Nagini is a whole mood!! LMAO. I love her. XD  See you next Friday and have a nice weekend.
Harry was baffled.
“It better not be what I think," he said, cornering him against the wall, "because you, Harry James Potter," he said, poking him with his finger, threateningly, “
"Sorry Sirius but Draco cannot leave. I'll explain what's going on but don’t kick Draco out of your house please– he ended up begging.
"Don't worry about them Harry, I'm sure they’ll understand," she said, " she said happily thinking that was the only thing that worried him.
"I see that Severus has taught you very well, I can't read your mind. Come closer – he demanded impatiently.
– Wait Potter. I'm not here to fight." He said raising his empty hands.
Hello Guys. I was supposed to post yesterday but my internet provider decided it was a great day to fix some towers. Lmao. We finally have internet. Now, here is the chapter for you to enjoy. Stay safe and happy reading! XD
"Just don't expect us to stay away from you too," they said in a warning tone.
– Potter! I didn't hear you open the door," he said awkwardly.
– I don't know what you're laughing at. Do you like being watched from behind? Because let me tell you, my creep of a cousin didn’t miss the opportunity," Harry said, annoyed by the blonde's attitude.
– What are you doing here brat? – he heard a growl from Draco and watched with fear as the tip of his wand peeked out of his shirt.
"I promise to go fast– he got up off the couch and kissed the brunette's forehead.
Harry wasn't told twice, he rushed out to the dining room.
Harry felt Draco's gaze on him and gave him an embarrassed smile. Draco felt he was short of breath; that smile always wreaked havoc on him, but by gathering his self-control he managed to smile at the brunette.
Remus stared at Malfoy and decided to take advantage of the fact that he was finally alone with him.
– Are you sure you can handle this? Without compromising you or us I mean. – asked Sirius.
Draco watched them leave and soon after felt the protections vibrate. He turned and looked at the adults on the couch, concealed his nervousness, and took a seat in front of them. They were held by the hands, lost in their thoughts; he looked up at the stairs for a second before clearing his throat and looking at the adults who turned his attention to him.
"We also came to spend a few days before Christmas and take the opportunity to bring Fleur to meet my whole family and spend a few days getting to know each other," he said, kissing her forehead.
HEEEEEY you guyyyyyys. I'ts fridaaaay, fridaaaaay. LMAO. Time for another update. XD
Harry was left with his mouth open and an alarm leap in his brain.
The day was splendid. The night before he felt he was suffocating but the day made it all look different and he had promised himself that if things went wrong he would have Draco, his godfather, Remus, his father, and perhaps also his other father with him; so he would handle anything.
Draco nodded slowly but said nothing. He wasn't worried about Severus or the owl, he was worried that Harry would leave in a few hours and he would not see him for two days. He didn't want to be without Harry, but he needed to go out and see his friends, start preparing the ground for when he decides to tell them the truth. Although he didn’t know how to feel about that since he imagined that when they learned the truth they wouldn’t leave him alone, they would protect him all the time and where would that leave him? Harry would probably notice he doesn’t need him and would abandon him to be with his friends.
He was left alone in the room, watching with amusement how he ran up the stairs. He knew that if Lucius Malfoy saw his heir behave in such a way, it would probably give him a heart attack and even more especially knowing for whom he acted in that manner. He turned around and went to complete his little task.
"Potter, you always draw attention” Snape whispered, “Well then, let’s give them a little show”.
That was precisely the reason that had them arguing now.
"All right, so when are we going to look for my parents' Horcruxes and return their bodies?" he asked insecurely.
"Calm down Sirius or I'll get you out of here," Remus said as he approached the bed, "Kreacher was too upset and only babbling something about that he shouldn't disobey you but we had to come and see you," he said, worried, stroking Harry's head, who was still lying on the blonde.
“Answer!” – he screamed, out of his mind “What's next? Calling Hermione, a mudblood? Or befriend that coward Malfoy?” – he asked getting closer to Harry.
Draco watched her with utter contempt and a grimace of disgust.
he corrected himself. "I also desire it, you are my only son, mine and the love of my life and that is precisely why I am doing this son" He cleaned with his fingers the tears that fell down his son's cheeks. "I need to know that you will be as prepared as possible to return to school" He gently denied "I will not leave you to your fate, I will make sure you have protection. But you better than anyone should know that problems are hard to avoid and you have to be prepared."
"Well, what happened?" he asked with real interest, "because the members of The Order have been here, No? – he said observing them discreetly to see their reactions and what he saw he didn’t like it at all. They were hiding something, and he would find out what it was.
– w-we must ta-talk before...
He walked quickly to the back, where an old closet was against the wall. He took out a beautifully decorated pensieve and returned to the table.
Harry blushed furiously as he remembers that day that Draco almost kissed him or so he believed.
"Yes," he said, going up to the bed, "and I'll take care of those who don't yet know that YOU're untouchable," he said, approaching his lips.
"Of course I can read it, the fact that I don't like to use that kind of magic doesn't mean I'm not able to read a bit," replied the brunette upset, turning his back on him.
– You... I appreciate everything you did for me last night if it hadn't been for you...–he let out a sigh—I know the least I owe you is an explanation,  but the situation is very delicate and I'm still not sure I can trust you  Malfoy.
"Well, you know I'll support you in whatever you decide," he said awkwardly, "but your mom opened the doors of her house to me and gave me a family, I wouldn't want to let her down like that," he said with regret, "I know it sounds silly but...
"Of course not Harry–she hastened to answer – if you don't want to, you don’t have to. What I'm saying is that I'd be more than willing to have a child of yours even if you decide not to marry me, of course, you can see it, I won't take it away from you but...
-Dumbledore – if he was expecting questioning because of his comment he received nothing of the sort. – yeah. I expected that. I dint like that he didn’t let me know he wanted to get inside the Mansion, I found out because Kreacher told me. His behavior is somewhat strange, he didn’t offer protection to Draco and his family, not even making sure with
Tom?"
But this answer didn't come so he decided it was best to get out of there as soon as possible before someone attacked him. He turned and had barely taken two steps when he heard a voice behind his back that caused his skin to stand.
They had just arrived in the room when they saw his godfather and Remus appear or rather the fake versions of Vernon and Petunia.
– After everything I've found out I don’t know if I can trust them anymore.
Harry was going to protest, but they disappeared before he could even process what they had just told him. He dropped near a tree, rambling about what the twins told him, and his throat squeezed painfully when he thought maybe he could only count on them.
"Let's go before the effect goes by," he turned around and gave the blonde a quick hug, "I'll see you at night, wish me luck.
He heard screams and laughter, but he remained unbothered, all he wanted was to get to the Quidditch pitch and look for Draco.
“Harry... I like you” he saw the brunette's surprised eyes “and a lot, I... I asked the Lord for his consent to court you,” he said waiting for Harry’s reaction.
Everyone watched the exchange of words in amazement, but their eyes were exorbitant to the sight of Harry clinging to that man.
“What's the matter, Potter? You even deign to answer us now that you're a crawling snake?” – ask Ron with poison in every word.
Read you next chapter. XD
Harry still wasn't processing the information when he saw her turn around and back in. It wasn't until Ron's cry resonated in his ears that he came out of his trance.
But they didn't know they were about to verify it.
Harry's eyes filled with tears as he recalled that he could no longer count on his godfather.

"Well, don’t let me stop you. I have many things to do, and besides … - but he was interrupted by the adults.
Remus stared at him for a few seconds, the fact that he averted his gaze and he seemed to be searching for something on the ground didn't pass unnoticed.
Harry looked at them without understanding what they were referring to, he wanted to know what was going on but when he looked behind them, he found the answer. Hermione and the rest of the Weasleys came very close.
"That, dear, deserves a little toast – she came back with a couple of drinks and gave him one – to us? she said raising the glass.
– If you can still joke, it means you'll recover soon. Nice going little Prongs!" Sirius said proudly.
“It's time, Harry, get up or we'll be late for Transfigurations”
– Harry Potter sir, – his huge green eyes shone with emotion – Dobby is very happy to see him again sir, and know that you are well."
He nodded slowly and raised his glass.
"Hey Harry, you look beautiful, “she said in her dreamy voice, "are you coming with us? – she asked, looking at the other Ravenclaws who ignored her.
– and hissing she left the room in a hurry.
– That won't happen, Harry. You want me to tell you why? – he saw a glow of hope reflected in those dark eyes —because I won't allow it! I'll take care of you and I'll never let you do anything you regret or something that hurts you—he came up to Harry slowly and cradled his cheeks with his hands—I'll always be by your side and I'll always protect you.
“I will accompany you to Gryffindor Tower for your things and take you to your room in Slytherin. Follow me” he turned around and left the dining room.

"Who says we're going to sleep," he said lustfully.
He saw the twins look at each other and then stared at him, so much so that Harry felt under a giant magnifying glass.
Harry composed himself a little more when he saw his godfather take it easy. So he decided that the letter would be dealt with later.
"Guys," Harry started not very sure, but maybe if he took a little risk, he could know exactly what was going on, "I know something is going on...
"So, you didn't want him to hurt him?" he heard a  growl from his godfather but ignored him – didn’t you want to find him to kill him?– he knew he wasn't going to be well off this time, but he had to make sure, anyway if the Lord didn't crucio'd him then the good for nothing black will.
"Voldemort," he answered firmly, observing Draco's reaction.
– My lord, I know you are looking for Snape... I just came to tell you that he sent me an owl a few minutes ago saying that he would be a little late but that he would soon arrive and …
AUTHOR: VampirePrincess27
– I just sent the letters. I hope they'll answer me, at least one of them will," he said with melancholy.
He doubted that Harry, as he was now, would want to tell him what happened o even want to tell him. He held him in his arms until he stopped crying but when he turned his gaze to his eyes to talk, he noticed that boy was aching so bad and he felt his heart tightened seeing him like that.
– Malfoy! –  He brandished the wand ready to attack.
– No more sentimentality or they will find us...
Nagini, who had been sheltered in the shadows, decided to appear before Tom crucio’d the blond and made Harry upset because of it. She slithered slowly and approached Harry’s feet.
"Well Harry, taking advantage of your charity," they said with shame, "we'd like you to take this with you," they extended a couple of shrunken trunks out of their pockets—they're important belongings that we knew they wouldn't miss.
Draco could no longer resist, approached him, and held him in his arms. Harry hugged the blonde hard, resting his head on his shoulder.
– Sirius enough. You've left the poor boy petrified, thanks to Merlin you're not a basilisk.
Draco stayed up longer, thinking of a way to find his mother. When he finally fell asleep, he fell into an uneasy slumber.
- Well, I'm sorry to tell you that if you don't tell me who your master is, I won't talk to him. - Harry looks at him decisively waiting for the elf's answer.
"Yes Professor, but I need to talk with the Headmaster, it's urgent.” He said with the hope that she wouldn’t ask too many questions.
– Seriously Malfoy? - He said slowly approaching him, - Then why don't you dress me? – He asks as he walked to the library, hips swaying.
“I'm not little! You're only a few inches taller than me," he said, making a pout.
Harry turned his head so fast that his neck popped. He watched the sorting hat with astonishment.
– My dear Severus so many years believing that it had only been a physical attraction and today I come to realize that you can love, we both can. But don't get confused Severus, you're an intelligent man to realize that despite potter's great resemblance to... James, you've learned to love the brat – he ended with a mocking smile.
– Draco! –  Severus cry horrified – My Lord, I ask you to...
He let out a sigh with frustration, he knew his godson, he knew that if he didn't want to be found there would be no way to do it, he had no choice but to send him a letter.
"As your three tutors will always be available, it is best for the schedule to be set. Therefore, they will start from 6 to 7:30 in the morning with physical training, from 8 to 8:30 breakfast will be served and young Malfoy will be able to take advantage, then you will study with Lupin from 8:30 to 12 pm, you will have half an hour of lunch from 12 to 12:30, you will continue your studies from 12:30 to 3 pm. Young Malfoy will have the time of 3 to 4 for etiquette classes, the meal will be from 4 to 4:30, the remaining hours from 4:30 to 8 p.m. you will train with Black and finally dinner will be served at 9 o'clock and I must clarify that I do not like to wait". He said looking in warning at his son, but this one looked at him in horror.
"We'd better get going, they're probably waiting for us at the door," Draco said, holding his hand.
Harry nodded quickly towards Draco and left behind Snape.
He was going to approach Remus to see what was happening to him when a gentle purr was heard next to him. He turned to the couch and was shocked. After several minutes that seemed to him to react, but all he could do was squeal a couple of times before shutting his mouth again when he saw
Even though Sirius didn't see Harry like that, it didn't mean he didn't care who approached his beloved godson. So, since Moony didn’t let him mess with the Malfoy heir he would at least observe his behavior to know what his intentions were with his little prongs.
"I must assume that what I have entrusted to you has been understood," he said, more as a fact than as a question.
–Do you need anything else, Young Malfoy? – the elf asked complacently.
"Harry, I didn't want to...," he said, but the brunette interrupted him.
– All right. Get out and tell Severus we'll be out in a few minutes," he said leveling his gaze.
"Perfect, wait for him at the entrance and tell him I want him in my room as soon as possible and you better not delay more or you'll pay for it – that said he turned around and went back to his room.
SPOILER ALERT(not really): Could contain grammatical and/or minor tense errors. Feel free to point them out. LOL
–A friend of Blaise of course. You know, having fun," he added with a smile of sufficiency. After all, Severus didn't have to doubt what he was saying because he had done it a few times.
Tom watched him exit and remembered the day he longed to have a surname of lineage.

– Mmm– Griphook turned and walked towards the back of the room. He traced with his fingernail a crack barely visible on the wall; took a step back and Harry watched as a small door appeared from which Griphook pulled out an ochre envelope. – Your discretion was an important requirement to be able to give you this—he held the envelope to Harry who automatically walked to the goblin and took the envelope with trembling fingers. - It seems to me that the letter I have just given to you and this box answer your last two questions, Mr. Potter– Griphook placed on the table a beautifully carved black box.

Harry forgot everything when he heard the latter. He had been lied to, and not only that, no one thought to tell him anything. He felt a pain in his chest knowing that perhaps, after all, his friends were not what he believed. He was increasingly suspicious of Dumbledore, that just meant that if they were faithful to the Headmaster, Harry had nothing else to do here. With the terrible pain he felt in his heart, he turned around and dropped into bed, he didn't want to hear anymore, he was afraid of what he might discover.
Harry thought it would take a long time to cross the dining room and get to the tower, but all the students looked at them in amazement and walked out of their way.
–We ignore their motives but do not let this bring you down Harry, it's important that you don’t let show what you know, or they will figure out who told you. I know it's hard what we ask of you, but you have to try. – George said and then looked at his brother and they both nodded. – Besides, we have decided to return to Hogwarts to support you and keep you safe while you are under the “care” of the Headmaster.
"Don't worry Potter, Draco will understand when you explain everything," he said with a grimace, "now pay attention.”
once again and there was the result: a Dark Lord in shock and a catatonic Severus Snape.
– You know well that treachery is paid for by death in my followers. But you've been saved for the simple reason that you know where Potter is, which makes me think that you know why I want to find him and therefore he knows I'm looking for him, doesn’t he?– he saw the boy nod and he continued – all right, now I want you to tell me if Potter would agree to meet me.
Harry just nodded, but when they got to the room, he asked Draco to stay with him that night.
"Congratulations! I'm glad you finally made up your mind. Isn’t that right Padfoot?"
Tom frowned a few seconds before pulling out his wand.
Severus snorted.
Remus fixed his icy look on Sirius as a warning. Sirius rolled his eyes and let out a sigh.
Harry nodded in the direction of the boys, but his gaze stopped for a few seconds in a pair of gray eyes pointing at him like daggers. He swallowed saliva and look at the professor who looked at him with amusement.
The elf nodded and he took his two masters by the hand disappearing in an instant.
“Harry Potter!” The Headmaster said authoritarian.
Harry gave a frightened yelp and with sheer reflexes turned around and pointed his wand, to the twins who promptly raised their hands.
He turned around and disappeared down the aisle before everyone reacted. Harry smiled like a fool and said goodbye to everyone to get up to sleep.
– Who-who are you? Remus, why are you coming with this person? Are you Remus? – Harry was confused and afraid of what was going on. I look into the eyes of Draco supplicant – Draco is it really him?
1. The little joke was brought to you by yours truly with authorization from the original author. Like, come on! you always have to make that joke when you can. XD
"Harry, at the pace you are going we'll never finish, and I also think you're just reading half the information per sheet – he talked without taking his gaze from the book he was reading.
Harry closed his eyes when he felt Draco's lips on his own and gasped when he felt his soft tongue stroking his lips asking permission, which was granted, and had to hold on to the blonde's shoulders or his legs would give way. His tongues struggled to dominate, but unsurprisingly, Harry gladly ceded control and instead tangled his fingers into the silky blond hair moaning with pleasure.
"I've never seen a Malfoy lose his composure like this – Remus approached the boy and slowly put a hand on his shoulder – But you have to calm yourself, I'm sure Harry shouldn't be long, in a few hours he'll be back.
He let out a sigh of boredom and rose from the bed to stretch his legs. He leaned over the window wishing he could get to breathe fresh air, but punished as he was he did not think he could go out, his uncles would not let him, which only left him only a way out to attend his date at the bank, and that was... to move to Grimmauld Place. He wanted to leave this house but was terrified of moving alone to his godfather's house, painful memories would consume him.
A throat clearing pulled them out of his fantasy, causing Harry to blush and let go of Draco's hands.
He came out of his reflections when he heard the door open and saw Draco standing in the frame watching him. He smiled and saw him walk up to him, but instead of dropping some joke like the ones he used to say, he kept quiet, staring at him, and to his surprise, the other began to slowly approach without separating his eyes from his own. Harry felt he was short of breath and his heart was beating fast
They both smiled gratefully.
He felt uncomfortable in the same room as the snake and could not help but cast glances at her every few minutes. After about half an hour he thought that if she hadn't attacked him yet maybe she wouldn't, so he risked conjuring up his potion book with a gentle wand movement. The snake merely blinked before she snuggled up again on Harry.
But fortunately, he was saved by the express’s whistle.
Three days had passed after the meeting with Lord Voldemort and the four inhabitants of the mansion had already established a routine of eating breakfast, practicing, eating, practicing, having dinner, and sleeping. It should be said that the only ones who shared a room were Remus and Sirius, but Draco took advantage of the few moments he had alone with Harry to talk or just rest.
"I doubt it very much, if I've learned anything from that boy, it's how stubborn he is," he ended up with a snort.
When the air was needed, they separated agitated.
“Draco! " Harry exclaimed in amazement and then he smirked "Tom didn’t Crucio you?” he asked with amusement.
Harry denied softly before speaking.
Harry blushed and lowered his gaze embarrassed.
Malfoy watched him closely. He still had a trail of tears on his face, his eyes were slightly swollen and his nose was red.
Draco looked at him for a few seconds without being able to believe what he was asking, but then he sighed with frustration knowing that he couldn't deny him anything.
"Don't meddle in this Draco," Severus said earnestly.
Harry was surprised but still smiled gratefully.
Draco inhaled discreetly.
potion. Hurry!
– Who was it? What did you tell him? – Harry was panicking, but he felt Draco's hand squeezing his wrist and taking a deep breath. Although his cousin’s stunned gaze didn’t escape his notice and he frowned.
“Girls?” he asked, gently moving away from them.
"It's not all my fault," he said with annoyance, dropping inelegantly on the couch, "Maybe if I hadn't had a crazy psycho after me all the time trying to kill me, I could improve my grades," he said, ignoring his father's growl.
"We know, Harry," Fred said, "we were just kidding. Even if Ginny realizes you'll never be able to be with her, there won't be anyone who can stand her," they said theatrically.
Fred and George looked at each other with wide eyes. None of them believed that their little sister would go so far, although they were amused that Harry was so dumb and did not understand what their brainless sister was trying to say.
Harry smiled happily that he still loved his dad.
SPOILER ALERT(not really): Could contain grammatical and/or minor tense errors.
– Because of my scar Draco. We have a connection thanks to the scar he left– Draco stared at him and took his hands in a gesture of support – and it seems that he has already learned the truth – he sighed with regret.
– Potter! – he exclaims trying to get away from him. Worried about what he might have heard.
– Don't even dream that I'll let you go to that house alone. We're going to have dinner first, and then I'm going to pick up my things at the mansion. When I return, we'll go get your trunk and we'll be back as soon as possible and then we'll see what to do—Draco said with a look that took no complaints.
The first one to wake up was Harry, something had woken him up, though he didn't know what. When he opened his eyes, he forgot the noise he had heard because with great shame he realized that he was clinging to Draco’s shoulders while he felts the warmth of the other around his waist. His face was so close to Draco’s neck that he could feel the warmth that emanated from his skin and his mouth watered just imagining what it would taste like, it looked so soft he had an urge to touch it. He raised his gaze for a few seconds and saw that Draco slept profoundly, that’s why he believed that if he touched him, he wouldn’t wake up, and it would be just a small graze.
“¡Harry!”
Draco had spent most of the day locked in the library; He was depressed and angry at the same time. Apparently, Harry wasn't missing him as much as he said he'd miss him, as he hadn't even sent him a simple letter to find out if he was okay. Just imagining that the Weasley girl would be stuck to Harry like a tick, made him sick and angry, really angry.
– They will let him hand me over to ... Voldemort," he said in a whisper, "your family will allow Dumbledore to turn me in to be killed," he said with deep sadness.
"Enough Black!" Draco screamed, which made both men leap –I know you're worried about Harry, but if he hasn't sent an owl, it's because everything's fine – he looked at Remus and added – Why don’t you both look for something to distract you until its time to sleep.
– Don't even joke that I'll leave this degenerate in the same room as my godson. If he wants to stay in the Mansion, he'll sleep in the living room," he said with authority.
They were all in the dining room, they had finished eating and now they were fixing the last details of Harry's weekend, who would depart in a couple of hours towards the Burrow.
Minutes later they saw the Dark Lord come down and hissed something to his huge snake, who immediately started to slither upstairs.
Over the next week, Harry had been a little busy, both for classes, homework, and more, and for the constant harassment of the Headmaster, but that didn't overshadow the cute moments he spent with Draco.
“Yes, I only need a few things, but...
Her eyes opened in surprise when she noticed his expensive clothes and his blond hair but more so when she saw their hands intertwined.
"All right Harry, I hear you," he said, crossing his fingers in front of the desk.
Draco felt his heart expand from happiness.
"Of course Harry Potter, sir– the elf smiled and disappeared.
"My Lord," he said, giving a curtsy again, this time more elaborate, "if I may speak to you,"
That said, he moved the wand slightly and the three men protecting Harry flew out in opposite directions and were immobilized on the wall. Harry was only able to watch their family get rid of, unable to do anything, but his protest died on his lips when he saw that he was not hurting them.
