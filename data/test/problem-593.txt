He supposed he should start calling him 'Harry'. At least in his head. Unless … he bit the inside of his lip … unless he decided to stop this madness, this thing with Po – Harry right now. That was what most of his friends would say. His parents … well, no use in thinking what his father would advise.
‘Do you think you’re finally able to move forwards or should I send Dipsy for some Mandrake Draught?’
Now, almost a week later, he was still looking – staring actually – at Malfoy's chin. In every class they now shared as eighth years and during meals when it was impossible to see something all the way across the Great Hall.
Harry tightened his jaw but ignored the comment. It wasn’t the first time his friend had brought up the issue of Malfoy’s wand. Of course deep down Harry knew he should have given Malfoy his wand back a long time ago, but …

Even Hermione seemed interested. Harry, however, was just speechless. He stared at Dean with his mouth hanging open. Draco Malfoy visited a Muggle establishment? He could see the ponce in a beauty salon, sure, but a Muggle one?
The boy laughed again and gave him a nudge. 'Straight on to the big ones, right?' He hummed for a bit but then carefully said, 'I have a magical object which shows me where people in Hogwarts are.'
Magical Healing was a subject that Headmistress McGonagall had added to the school schedule of the eight years. While Draco felt triumphantly, the boy continued, 'I'm amazed with all the possibilities that magic gives us to heal children and how it is so much faster than Muggle medicine. I never considered it before, but maybe I'd like to have a career in healing.' His arm brushed against Draco's as if he was shrugging his shoulder.
Instead of laying him down, he put Draco to his feet and started undressing him. He moved reverently. He ran his hands down Draco's chest and tugged at his shirt. Warm, searching hands slipped beneath the hem, up along his chest and onto his back.

"The Twelve Days of Christmas" is an English Christmas carol. The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin.
Draco wondered how the boy was always able to find him. He didn't want to be an easy score, even though he was anxious to meet the other again. So after diner that evening  he went looking for an abandoned classroom to hide. He found a place that was dirty, and gloomy, and filled with school-desks, old armchairs, a cabinet, and lots of other knickknacks.
His eyes snapped southwards and he discovered that his lower body was covered with a blanket. The woollen fabric felt weird on his naked bits, he thought. Then realization hit him; it must have been Kreacher doing the covering up thing. Mortified he closed his eyes and let his head fall back on the back of the couch.
'I think you could safely say that without my friends I would live like a hermit. Although I do enjoy other people's company every now and then, I like to wander around alone and observe others more.'
Harry closed his eyes, praying for something he didn't even know, and hissed through clamped teeth: 'Yesss!'
Originally beta'd by the lovely spicykittins and Myriam. Any remaining mistakes - from the post-beta fiddling – are mine :)
'Would you please kiss me again?' When the boy did, Draco felt his own smile copied against the other's lips.
‘Have a seat,’ Malfoy said as soon as Harry stepped into the room again and he pointed to one of the chairs in front of the fireplace.
The hand stilled. 'Trust me, Draco, you don't want to know,' the boy answered sadly. 'You wouldn't want me to kiss you, if you knew.'
The boy walked towards the bed and then Draco felt the mattress give way. While a hand scanned the contours of his body until it found his head, the boy responded: 'You can smell them!'
Hands slid down to rest upon his shoulders and, to his surprise, teeth began nibbling on his ear. The hot breath on his ear made him dizzy, and his own hands - as if acting on their own – found a waist to hold on to. Absently he noticed that the other was more solidly built than he was, but then the boy began peppering a trail of tiny kisses along his jaw, distracting him. Draco whimpered and wrapped his arms around whomever it was that kept kissing him in the dark. He bent his head to the side in anticipation and the boy didn't disappoint him. He began nibbling on the other lobe like it was a gingerbread cookie.
And yet, old mechanisms screamed not to trust the Gryffindor. Told him it shouldn't be happening, that it could never work. The Golden Boy & the Death Eater? The Daily Prophet would have a field day as soon as they found out.
‘Don’t be daft, Malfoy!’ Harry second-guessed his decision to come here for the umpteenth time in as many minutes. ‘It’s your wand! You shouldn’t have to live without one, just because Ollivander won’t sell to you.’ He hesitated a moment. ‘Although, can you really blame him?’
'No!' he quickly denied. 'I was just thinking out loud.' He had to keep a clear head in order to find out who this boy was. 'What's your favourite subject at Hogwarts?' That would eliminate a few candidates.
But before she could answer his question, realization hit him. 'The boy!' he expressed, feeling very pleased all of a sudden. Only the presence of Madame Pince, prevented him from running to their usual study corner.
That was probably the reason he had been feeling so weird earlier. It had nothing to do with chest monsters. Nothing at all!
Potter's eyes flashed and he clenched his teeth, but responded: 'She hasn't … we've … never …' He pressed his lips together as if trying to keep the truth inside.
The smell of coffee was coming from the kitchen and Harry debated what to do. Embarrassment told him to hide in his room, but the hammering sound in his head demanded he face his house-elf and get some coffee. He was brave. Wasn’t he? Well, that’s what people always told him anyway.
Harry couldn’t believe the sounds coming from his throat making him glad that Draco had cast a silencing spell so that no matter how loud they got nobody would hear what was happening.
Harry wandered into the kitchen to fix breakfast, Eggs, bacon and fully loaded french toast with the butter, syrup and the powdered sugar, and he put a couple scoops of vanilla ice cream on top of the french toast. Then sprinkled chocolate syrup over it.
Finally after some minutes Draco responds “There was never any reason for you to hide how you felt Harry, cause you see if you had told me this a long time ago you’d have found that I feel exactly the same about you, but I never said anything cause you acted like you hated me so I never saw the point.”
“see this room is perfect for a double nursery. And on the other end over there, that door leads to my room, making this perfect for us to share.”
The next several weeks went by with Harry and Draco going to classes and meeting in secret for a cuddle, a kiss, a quick date and on Hogsmaed weekend would have sex as much as they could until it was time for everyone in Hogsmaede to come back to the castle.
“Just give us a few days to gather all our stuff together and everything and we’ll be there.” Ron tells Harry.
“Keep an eye on him Harry, I have a bad feeling about what he might be about to do.” Snape says to Harry.
Harry sighed wishing he could stay at Hogwarts forever and never leave. Hogwarts had always been the place he’d considered home for the last seven years. It was going to be hard next summer when he would for the first time in his life not be leaving on the train for school.
When I got my letter and the world found out the you were coming to Hogwarts to my Dad urged me to try and make friends with you, so that if You Know Who would come back, we would be able to just hand you over to him. But you were smarter than that, and chose the Weasley boy instead. Which I’m glad you did, cause now if my dad ever tried to hand you over to that Wizard now, I don’t know what I’d do..”
Harry also used the time to look through special pamphlets that he’d owl ordered, both muggle and wizarding, looking for the perfect house for him and Draco to go to at the end of the term.
“Maybe you’ll meet another guy down the road that will love you enough to put love before thier parents.” Hermione said gently laying a hand over Harry’s shoulder.
Morning came quickly , Ron and Hermione went down for breakfast while Harry finished packing his bags and even finished packing Ron’s bag for him.
Sucking in his breath he knew better than to be late, Snape would be furious and would dock hundreds of points from Gryffindor if he was even one minute late, or worse would extend his detention with Malfoy to be twice as long.
“Yes, Mrs. Weasley, I think now that in the wizarding world I am considered of age, I’m going to honor Sirius’s memory . He left me that house and I realized I’d be dishonoring his memory to not use it, I’m going to go and gutt it out and fix it up. Now that I can use magic outside school I’m going to use it to my advantage to make Grimwauld much more livable.”
“Tell me Draco, tell me what you need, what you need from me, I need to hear you say it.” Harry whispers into his ears.
“No. After what you tried to just do, I no longer want any part of you, You are no longer my father, nor will you ever have a part in our child’s life. My Harry is not a Pawn for helping Your image, My Harry is my boyfriend, and the father of my Child, And I will do everything in my power to protect him and my child. For now on, You are Dead to me.”
Harry watched Draco’s face finally reach the point of a smile and he shakes himself. “Harry, if it happens..if I am carrying your..if we are expecting..then we will deal with it when the time comes. Even if it happens that won’t be enough to make me run away from this.”
What perplexed Harry, was Ron and Hermione. They were acting very strangely towards him lately, it was like they never wanted to sit near him anymore. When ever he’d approach them they suddenly have something they had to do elsewhere.
The inside of the store was much bigger on the inside then the outside suggested it would be. The three of them separate in three different directions. Harry went looking at baby clothes, he found a cute onesie that said Little Bludger on it and had a picture of a bludger ball, another one that said I’m a Keeper, that had a goalie on it, Harry found a bunch of little onesies with Quidditch as the theme, he threw a bunch of these over his arms, and grabbed a pack of diapers that had little racing brooms on it and a snitch on the front.
Harry was concerned about Draco’s reaction if Harry were to hang out with Ron like that. Now that he was with Draco he didn’t want the blonde to think something was going on with anyone else.
Harry could hear Draco making a sound almost as if in pain. But then Harry heard Draco stand up to his father.
After one last hug from Molly he pulled away and walks over to a spot and pulled up a picture of Grimwauld place in his head, and was there quickly.
"Potter?" Malfoy practically moaned his name in a scratchy voice, looking up at him with teary eyes. "Kindly get the fuck out of my room."
"Alright class. Good morning, get settled in. I'm Professor Potter and I'm going to be teaching defense against the dark arts. Great class, one of my favorites. You, erm, probably know who I am, but now I want to get to know you. Also, I bet you are eager to get aquatinted with your classmates, so let's go around, say your name, and say something about yourself. Sound good?" Harry addressed the class from his perch atop his desk.
"Always. I got to run and I assume you do too, but we'll talk soon. Have fun with Malfoy." Ron winked.
"Bugger off, Malfoy. At least my hair isn't-" Harry started but soon trailed off as he finally noticed Malfoy's hair. It was longer, collarbone length, and slightly shaggy while still looking perfectly manicured. So high maintenance. It looked so soft and silky, though.
"Well, you could add more explanation to paragraph 4, it's a bit weak, but really, above and beyond work." He assured her.
"Potter, I have never seen anyone man spread as bad as you do." In response to this, Harry had widened his legs with a sneer. He had also went to Hogs Head with Ginny, Luna, and Neville. Had quite a blast. They had all downed a concerning amount of fire whiskey and giggle water. He didn't remember much but he did remember talking about Malfoy a little more than he had wished. But it's alright because Neville was even more wasted than him and Gin and Luna were too busy dancing and drowning in each other's arms. All good.
"What type of noises?" Mcgonagall said as she appeared beside them. "Harry, take Draco to Madame Pomfrey, please." Harry nodded and extended a hand to Malloy. He obviously didn't take it and got up on his own.
"Ian Zeller. Ravenclaw!" Clapping. Finally, now Harry could eat. He had forgotten how delicious the hogwarts food was. Truly to die for. Malfoy barely touched his. Must have already eaten, the idiot. By the end of the feast, the air was warm and bubbly. It would be a task to get the bouncy students to bed. But that was the prefect's problem. Harry needed a bed to pass out on. A comfy couch would do. Even the floor.
Draco’s resulting moan, encourages Harry to deepen the kiss, pulling the blonde closer. Harry’s hands start to lightly explore Draco’s chest as Draco’s groans continue to grace his ears. The sound was like music to Harry’s ears, and everything inside Harry desired to keep Draco making these noises for him.
Draco paused as he had been pulling things from his bag and placing them on a nightstand beside the bed.
Once the house became visible to them, they entered the house carrying their suitcases. He watched as Ron and Hermione took in the newly remodeled house.
But all to soon the boys gave off one last groan and came hard. Their bodies stilled and they waited a moment to give themselves time to catch their breath. Finally reluctantly Draco pulls out and stood up. Draco doesn’t even glance back at Harry as he redresses himself and walks through the doors to head back down to his dorm.
“Lean on me Harry, and I’ll help you to the Hospital Wing.” Harry smiles his legs were fine, but he allowed Draco to help him to the hospital wing.
Over time though fixing up the house started to take longer as Harry felt himself starting to feel sick. Harry was a little worried as to why he was getting sick. But he brushed it aside as he continued to finish fixing up the house. He wanted it to be done before he allowed what ever the sickness was to make him stay in bed.
Surprisingly Snape was very cool about the missed lessons and with homework assignments requiring a potion to be made, Snape allowed Harry to just write a paper on how to do the potion instead.
“You know we should probably get dressed and go down to dinner, after the um work out we’ve done I’m starving, and I’m sure you are too.”
Draco was ushered out of the room while the surgery was performed. Draco decided to do something constructive with his time and took Harry’s class schedule from his bag, and went looking for MgGonagall.
Gazing into the blonde’s eyes, he gives one more slow thrust before letting go of his self control. He starts pounding Draco hard, fast, almost savagely into the floor. Soon the room was filled with the sounds of their moans and cries as the storeroom starts to become filled with the strong scent of good sweaty sex.
“Good. That's why I’m being a bit more nicer to you than normal. That’s my Godson your with, so since he is now possibly carrying your child, then I’m going to do everything I can to help you. But make no mention of it around other people, I can’t have anyone else knowing that I’m being Nice to you.” Snape growls.
Harry sighs relieved. Harry hadn’t really wanted to change how he spent time with his friends, but hadn’t wanted Draco to think he was cheating or anything.
Harry looked at Ron in surprise that he’d guessed it when Ron slid a copy of the daily prophet in front of him.
He hated that Draco had  been with another guy when Harry himself was still a virgin. What if he screwed up? What if he didn’t measure up to the other boy that Draco had experimented with?
Draco quickly made Harry’s robes fall to the ground. The air from the outside air kissed over Harry’s naked skin making him shiver as Draco slowly removes his own robes.
Stepping just inside the door, he takes Draco by the collar of his robes and pins him to the wall with a deep kiss.
“Oh that’s perfect.” Harry breathed as he eyes them to. He looks for a price tag. Then turns to the store owner.
Draco curiously looks over “What could Snape have possibly told you that could influence wither we persue this?”
Standing up he took the letter and smiled it was Ron, asking him to come help them find the house, saying they were just outside but couldn’t see the actual house.
“I didn’t go to the village, I decided to stay here and lend my attention to something a bit more entertaining.”
MgGonagall gave him the assignments and Draco hurried on to all the other classes to collect them, all that was left was Potions and that one Draco could just get an extra one for him when he attended himself.
“I just don’t know how I’m going to get through breakfast in the morning, seeing him after what happened and knowing I can’t change his mind.”
“No we won’t Harry. Some one in the hospital wing overheard Madam Pomphrey talking to me about the pregnancy and then gave me crap about it, and he sent a letter to my dad.” Draco says shaking.
Draco just stares at Harry as if he’d suddenly declared Snape to be his favorite teacher ever or Voldemort his best friend.
Harry’s senses were tingling as the boy withers under Draco’s tongue. When he finally trails the tongue over Harry’s stomach eating the bits of ice cream, chocolate whipped cream and cherries off of him, nice and slowly.
Just as he got accustomed to his finger, Draco added a second finger, easing both fingers in and out slowly, until Harry is moaning in pleasure, at that point Draco increases the speed and depth.
Draco starts to move against Harry’s hands, causing the Gryffindor to smile, and increase the speed before slipping in a second finger.
The spell hits Harry and throws him into a wall across the room, just as Snape comes into the room with Albus Dumbledore and the Minister Of Magic in tow.
“Since you choose to keep this child and you choose to continue to be gay, or tell me who fathered the child, then not only am I disowning you but I’m afraid this means I am also going to have to kill you to keep you from disgracing this family’s name.”
“Oh, Harry could you maybe turn around a moment...or wait for us in our room?” Ron asked blushing scarlet red, his face now horribly clashing with his red hair.
“you don’t have to. You wait up here, and I’ll bring something up here for you. You don’t have to see him if you don’t want to.”
During this final year at Hogwarts without the threat of Voldemort hanging over them and with his father in Azkaban, Harry and Draco had managed to put aside their rivalry and had to the surprise of the rest of the school become friends.
“You guys can have the second master bedroom if y'all want it. Just like my room it is attached to a nice large room that would make an excellent nursery room. Both of our rooms have a door that leds into that one. We can share it for both our babies, between the three of us we can help each other with the babies.” Hermione’s eyes lit up at the idea.
Harry shivers at the touch of the cold ice, as Draco takes every piece and runs it over Harry’s chest, arms and legs until each piece melted when there was no more ice on him, Draco grabs a tub of the ice cream and dips in a spoon and pulls a bite into his mouth before dumping the rest of the ice cream over Harry’s stomach, and then grabs the second tub uses the spoon to dig out a scoop and pushes it into Harry’s mouth, before dumping it onto Harry as well.
Harry glanced at Draco about to deny they did anything, but between the smell in the room and the bottle Snape found, Harry knew there was no way in hell, he was going to be able to lie his way out of this one all he could do was sit there in embarrassment and wait for Snape to punish Gryffindor for this. Snape was always looking for reasons to take points and Harry was sure even if he didn’t punish Draco he’d more than likely punish him. Harry was trying his damndest to think of a way to explain to his housemates how he’d lost the points..when Snape starts talking again.
It took weeks for Harry to finish fixing up the house. But he enjoyed watching the house slowly start to become a home rather than the dim, boring way it had looked before.
“I’ve known for awhile that you felt the same way Harry and I was wondering if since Tonight is probably the last night we’ll be together under the same roof, if maybe you’d be interested in having sex for just this one night, basically one last fling before we move on with our own lives?” Draco asked quietly.
Harry and Draco parted ways before they reached the Great Hall so nobody would notice that the two of them had been hanging out together.
This last part he had said after taking the Wizards wand and extracting the most recently used spells from the wand.
While Harry stretches on the bed, Draco grabs first the bucket of ice cubes, and pours the whole bucket on top of Harry.
“Babe, Ron’s your best friend and I’ve known that for years. I would never think you were doing something with him, just cause you were alone with him or talking to him. Besides I already know he’s not into you at all.”
Harry knew without having to ask that his two best friends had decided to have their own fun tonight and he had walked in at exactly the wrong time.
Draco finally got to Harry’s cock and says “And look, I found the banana.” Just as he covers it with his mouth, licking up and down the base, slurping up the melting ice cream that covered him.
“Do you remember when I fell yesterday and knocked a couple potion bottles off the shelf?” Harry asked nervously.
“Mr. Potter when I left I had ten vials sitting in here, and now I’m seeing two are missing, what happened to them?”
Ron brought Harry a bagel and cream cheese and flask of pumpkin juice upstairs. Harry gratefully ate them and together he, Ron and Hermione headed down towards the train.
And then he felt a small pressure at his opening. His eyes fly open as Draco slides a slippery finger inside him. It was cold, wet and dripping with lube as it slid in to the hilt. Harry gasped at the uncomfortable feeling, but then Draco’s mouth was on his neck, kissing and suckling on the folds of the skin, as Draco starts to move the finger in and out of him slowly.
Inwardly Harry was groaning as working together made it necessary to be really close to Draco causing the blonde’s cologne to waft past his nose, causing Harry’s pants to harden. He smelled so good, Harry longed to reach over, grab the insufferable boy and kiss him. But Harry tries to endure in silence.
Harry choose Sirius old room for his own and put up four portraits, one of Sirius, one of Remus, one of Lily, and one of James Potter. He smiled as each of them moved around, and loved watching them visit each other’s portraits.
Hurt by their response Harry felt tears well, but chokes them back and goes looking for Draco instead.
The whole wizarding world is officially invited to book the date and attend this Huge Malfoy Wedding.
It wasn’t long before Ron and Hermione joined him on the bed looking at him with expectant eyes. He knew they were looking for an explanation of where he had been for so long.
Harry walked into the house and sees Ginny, Hermione, and Molly at the table. Harry quickly made his way to Mrs. Weasley and gives her a hug.
After food, Hermione suggests a shopping trip so the three of them walked outside and stick up their wand hands to call upon the knight bus.
“We remembered you saying that the guy was going to marry someone else after being with you that night, and when we say the paper we kinda just knew this had to be the guy you were with. I’m so sorry Harry. But the idea of staying with you at your place, being able to see you everyday just like when we were in school sounds like a lovely idea. You can be our baby’s Godfather, Harry.”
After a few weeks of them acting like that, Harry finally cornered Ron demanding to know why. Ron looked steadily uncomfortable in his presence until finally Ron blurted out the truth.
One was a truth potion, and the other was one nobody had gone over yet. Harry decided he’d look it up to see what it was later.
“well as much as I didn’t want to be seen, I wanted to be sure that you’d be able to get inside the room, once I was inside.”
“See, that door there leads to your own private bathroom, and that one leads to what I was thinking would be the nursery.”
The Slytherin's eyes widened noticeably. He stepped forward and a wicked smile appeared around his lips. 'You want a distraction?'
Pansy nudged him. The glare he gave her was a rather weak attempt and they both knew it. His fingers were trembling a little, while he unravelled the piece of string.
The boy leaned sideways for a moment and gave him another cherry-kiss combination. His teeth were sharp against Draco's bottom lip.
Draco felt him lean in. He could hear his heartbeat in his throat when the boy breathed against him lips: 'Feel them.'
He hesitated for a moment but then stepped closer and tentatively stroked with his lips against the soft little hairs on Malfoy's chin. The Slytherin gasped and Harry felt how his blood was running faster through the vein under Harry's thumb. Then a strong hand in his hair pulled his head backwards a bit until they could look each other in the eye again.
But what about the clean and tidy room? The furniture was arranged against the walls and there even was a little fireplace, which probably had been hidden behind one of the cabinets. Was this all the boy's doing? But why?
Just as he was dozing off a little, the room went pitch black again. His heart jumped up. It was amazing how just in one week the boy had changed his feelings about the Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder from anxiety to anticipation. The awareness seemed to make the darkness a bit softer, if you could say something like that.
He was finally broken out of his trance when he realized how late he was. He hurried down to the great hall as to not miss breakfast and slid into the last remaining seat, besides Malfoy. Makes sense that not many sat by Malfoy. He wasn't quite a crowd favorite.
The morning sun shone through his window as he got out of the shower when suddenly a crack sounded and a redhead was in his living room. Ron, actually.
"Malfoy, we broke up years ago. She's obviously still a great friend though. Playing for the Harpies. Dating Luna Lovegood."
"Run! Back the way we came." He bellowed at the frightened girls. They dashed off and he hoped they'd make it back safely. The beast was snarling and lunging at him and Malfoy. Malfoy stunned it and Harry used a charm he had learned in his extremely short time in Auror training. They raced off after the girls, swerving through trees and vine. The rain had gotten harder and made everything slick. Harry's shoes had no traction. In unison, they tripped and slammed into the ground. Harry groaned in pain. He pulled himself back up and saw Malfoy's sleeve ripped to reveal blood.
"It's okay, we're okay. Why were you in the woods." Malfoy said calmly, Harry was still fighting for his ability to speak.
"Mione! I've missed you. And that future babe of yours." He patted her stomach and felt quite like a cliche adult. Ron laughed and they all sat down. Conversation broke out suddenly and easily, like they were back in the common room. Everything that could come into their minds they talked about. That wasn't quite true, He left Malfoy out of the conversation. Ron and Harry had downed a few fire whiskeys and Hermione chugged some juice and everything felt so perfect.
"I'm Lola York and I can wiggle my ears." And that's how it went for the rest of the class. All smooth sailing. Until the last question after everyone had finished introducing themselves.
"I'm not sure. What's a fun fact?" Maybe the fact that he lacked a will to live was a fun fact. Or the fact that he drowned his self pity in alcohol and isolation. "I guess I can do a headstand."
"Sure." Malfoy smiled slightly as they set off into the morning air. Hogwarts was truly beautiful on a crisp September morning.
"Don't be sorry! Yer always welcome!" Hargrid poured him a cuppa and got out his box of biscuits. "What's on yer mind?"
"Professors!" A voice shrilly cut through the tension. Rainy and Lola ran over to them. "Oh, Merlin! Are you okay?!"
"Harry! So good to see you!" Neville said, sliding into the chair next to him. He had taken on Professor Sprout's job after she retired.
"So do I." Harry sighed as they got to the doors.  "And Malfoy, for the record, I'm bi." Harry gave the blonde one last crooked smile before walking away down the hall. That went well.
"No, like since the war." Harry cut him off. "It's been five years and I haven't see you in the papers since, well, the trials."
"Of course." He smiled as she handed him the paper. He began to read through it. "I like the way you organized your fact to opinion ratio."
"Merlin, Ron! I'm practically stark bollock naked!" He gestured to the single towel hanging around his waist.
"Uh, yeah." He smiled, having no clue what she said. She smiled back in a knowing sort of way. There was nothing for her to know though. Obviously.
"Rainy said she had heard noises of distress, and wanted to find the source. Lola came with, of course. Ian and Jasper had been the only ones they told about it. I really have no clue what it could be. They are safe, but I think we have a bit of a mystery to solve here."
"Draco, Harry!" Mcgonagall beckoned them over. Great. "As the two new teachers, you have not yet chosen your rooms. Any preferences?"
"Sounded like you had an interesting morning." Malfoy glanced at him over his goblet of pumpkin juice.
Suddenly, a boom sounded as the doors swung open. Hagrid. A line of shivering, terrified first years filled in behind him. At the back of the line was a tall, pale man. It couldn't be. "Is that-" Harry audibly whispered. The blonde haired man followed Hagrid up to the teacher's table as the first tears were shuffled away. He was wearing black slacks and a forest green jumper. They were wet from the pouring rain outside and clung to his lean figure. Harry's eye drilled into him as he gawked at the sight. The man looked up and met his gaze, intensely. It was definitely Draco Malfoy. Of course it was. Why did he always have to ruin Harry's life? Malfoy was panting slightly and still hadn't broke the eye contact as he slid into his seat. The farthest seat from Harry.
"Harry, is that my fucking wand?" Harry choked to find words. First of all, Malfoy just called him by his first name and he didn't know what he was feeling about that, and second of all, yes, it was his fucking wand. How do you tell someone you've been using their wand for years?
After two weeks, Harry settled into a routine. Teaching classes that were actually pretty fun, getting to know the kids, and having tea with Hagrid and Neville whenever he needed a break. He also wrote to all the Weasleys (including Hermione) on a regular basis. Although, he was missing Teddy quite a lot. Harry had became quite fond of the first years, especially the Slytherin, Rainy, and Gryffindor, Lola. There were also these two boys in Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff who always cracked him up. Jasper and Ian were crowd favorites. Once, he saw Mrs. Norris chasing Jasper down the halls and couldn't help but think of his own days of mischief. That's the thing about coming back to Hogwarts. It was like coming back to your childhood home after escaping it all. Good and bad come out of it. Dumbledore's portrait was always somewhere near Harry and Malfoy's little hall. To be honest, he hadn't seen much of Malfoy. They crossed paths occasionally, exchanged an insult or two, and went on their way. It was best like that. He didn't deserve Harry's attention.
Draco was more important than food. The words looked like it had been written with a shaking hand. It was enough for Harry to be concerned enough to not even stop to eat.
Snape spotting Harry there, slides out through a crack, so that Lucius wouldn’t notice him, but leaves the door open a smidge and puts a hand to his mouth to shush him.
The boys continue to sit and talk about the things they did and didn’t like. Time flew by pretty quick and when Draco checked a time piece he had in his pocket he realized it was close to dinner and had been up there since after breakfast.
“Your right, if he were to actually find out, then yes Young Draco could very well be danger, as well as the child. Not just from Voldemort though. Draco’s own father could also prove to be a danger to them both as well when he finds out, especially if her learns that you are the other partner in this. The best thing I can tell is, when he finds out you two need to be very careful, so that nobody finds out.”
Harry woke the next morning to an owl sitting on his bed post preening itself waiting for him to get up and see the mail it brought him.
“Well you see, my parents want to subject me to an arranged marriage and I honestly have no feeling for the girl and they’re threatening to disown me if I don’t comply. Well the thing is, I’m gay and I’ve had a crush on you for the longest.”
Using the spoon Draco spreads the ice cream he’d put on Harry’s stomach over his chest, arms, stomach, and places a nice chunk of the ice cream all around Harry’s cock. He then grabs the chocolate syrup and pours a trail all over Harry where the ice cream covered him from his arms, to his chest, to his stomach, up and down Harry’s legs and then he pours a big glob over Harry’s manly bits.
“Fine, you two can leave, I won’t punish y’all this time, but I will stress next time y’all decide you want to have sex, try to be more discreet and don’t use my storeroom or classroom to do it.”
Besides now that Voldemort was gone, Harry saw no reason for the Order to continue to meet there anyways.
“You have no idea how badly I want you.” Harry whispers as the scent of Draco’s cologne washed over his nose again, once again causing his briefs to feel two sizes too small.
“Fixing up the old Black Residence huh?” The old man mused with that all to familiar sparkle in his eyes.
Harry is surprised that Snape had overheard what he’d told Ron and had actually given Harry something to help. Since when did Snape care? Harry wondered.
Harry then went looking for Ron and Hermione to talk them about cribs, and found Hermione already in the furniture department looking at a pair Phoenix colored cribs that was made of a special goblin made material. Each of them was a different flame color. One had greens and blues in the paint and phoenix feathers on one end flowing like a tail. The other was a red and orange colored one.
Harry fixed his eyes on Draco, and to his own surprise spills out words he’d never have considered saying, but can't seem to stop himself from saying anyway..
Harry mind races as he wondered in his mind if he ought. Should he or shouldn’t he? Could his heart handle touching the man he loved when he knew he would be forced to leave his arms for another person forever?
“Congrats Granger, I see by these bags you must be expecting, how nice. And whose the chap that got you? Surely not the Weasely here? I hope everything goes well seeing as he comes from a poor family and all.” Draco continues.
What if it had all been a joke to him? What if he had just been playing some sick mind game? Harry wondered. Harry let his eyes fall back to his untouched plate, wondering if he should tell him about what Severus had told him about the broken potion, Harry was unsure of how to best explain the possibility to him, what if he got mad at him? What if he blamed him for the issue?
Draco walks over to Harry and dipped his head down capturing the wizard’s lips with his own. Harry moans softly into his mouth and kisses the blonde back with lips full of hunger and greed. Draco’s hand slide over Harry’s arms and down to his waist, snaking up his shirt to caress the small hair that was slowly starting to grow on Harry’s chest.
There was two tubs of ice cream, a bowl of candied cherrys, there was chocolate syrup, sprinkles and a can of whipped cream sitting there.
“Listen to me, if your father tries to come here to mess with you, go to Snape. I know he’s gruff and stuff but he does care about you as his Godson.” Harry says quickly.
"C'mon." Harry began to pull him up and he didn't fight the help. They walked back slowly, with Harry ghosting an arm around Malfoy. He tried to swat him away a few times, but eventually stopped caring.
"Wonderful, we have two available rooms in the left wing? If you boys can handle being that close together, that is." She said with a small smile.
Harry knew, logically, that he still hated Malfoy. Perhaps not hate, but dislike. He would always dislike Malfoy, yet he still couldn't stop himself from staring at the man. It had been a few days since the walk they took and Malfoy had been acting weird since. He didn't necessarily avoid Harry, he just seemed almost scared of him. He never dropped that posh self absorbed facade though. Harry wondered if he ever dropped it. Hagrid seemed to be quite fond of him so he must drop it then. None of that mattered now though because Harry was currently walking to the Hogs Head to see Hermione and Ron.
"Harry! My boy!" Hagrid boomed as he clapped him on the shoulder. Harry finally broke the staring contest with Malfoy to grin at the large man sitting down next him.
"Hello, Harry." She surveyed him with a suspicious eye and a sly smile. "Did you have a good night?"
Either that girl was somehow already comfortable around him or she just simply did not give a shit, Harry liked her. Honestly, Malfoy would probably like her too, even if she was "finessing" him. Merlin, kids are weird.
"You seem to know Professor Malfoy the best, do you think I would get a better grade if I did a mediocre potion and then a good essay or a good potion and a mediocre essay?"
"Really, really!" Harry leaped over to give him a bear hug and they danced around his living room whooping and hollering.
"Merlin, Potter, I didn't think your hair could get any messier, but I guess you have once again proven me wrong."
"Whatever." Malfoy mumbled, but walked over to Harry's door. Harry grinned and they went inside. "It looks and smells like a 14 year old boy lives here."
That night, Harry stared at the moon. Unable to sleep.  He could hear the clock ticking. Suddenly, he began to hear small sounds a destress. Then they got louder. Moans, groans, and whines. They sounded as if they were coming from Malfoy's room. Was that arse jerking off? It kept going and Harry listened for what felt like forever. Then the sobbing came. Okay, Malfoy was definitely having a nightmare and Harry couldn't sleep until he got over it, so Harry would go wake him up. He got up and pulled pajama pants over the boxers he was sleeping in and headed out to the hall. He stood there, staring at the door for quite sometime. Finding the courage or something. But Harry just about busted the door down when a scream came from inside. He found Malfoy tangled in sweaty sheets with tear rolling down his face.
Harry had accepted the position of the Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor with a little persuasion from Hermione and Mcgonagall. And by a little he means they forced him into it. So he could "have a purpose" and "get back on his feet". Harry knew this was all code for "Yer a lazy arsehole, Harry!" but that's okay, because it was true. And he would love to make a difference in his students lives. That is how he ended up sitting in front of a bustling great hall. The student sure were ecstatic to be back. Maybe deep down, he was too.
"Because that's double the work and I want to see if I can finesse a good grade. An experiment, if you will. Professors like experiments, right?"
Harry sighed and turned to walk away. Malfoy followed along like a beaten dog. They walked down the halls like that, Harry leading and Malfoy a few paces behind.
"Oh." Their footsteps echoed in the silent halls. The arrived at the little hallway with the two rooms side by side.
"Come on." He said gruffly as he tugged Malloy up. They were close to the edge of the forest and Harry all but dragged them there. As soon as he made it to grass and behind a boulder, he dropped Malfoy down. Harry cast a few healing charms on Malfoy to stop the blood.
"With her parents. We'll come see you Hogsmeade weekend, but for now Mcgonagall made an exception." He grinned.
"Well, this morning I ate breakfast in the great hall, then I had a few classes, then I went to have tea with Hagrid-." Malfoy mused.
"Bollocks!" Harry cursed, quite loudly. He had dropped the stack of books he was  carrying with a thunk. He knelt down to collect them.
Later, as Hermione started to get get tired, Hermione, Ron, and Pansy left. Leaving Malfoy and him to walk back to the castle. Harry's foot almost slipped out from under him on a patch of ice, but he regained his balance. Malfoy did not. His lanky body flew backwards and he slammed onto the ground, luckily missing the cobblestone and hitting a grassy patch.
"Quiet." Malfoy commanded as he paused. His hair was dripping and practically glowing in the moonlight. "This way." He redirected them. Harry followed. They reached the clearing and Harry's breath caught in his throat. A large beast was bearing its teeth at a familiar pair of students. Malfoy reached out and put a hand on Harry's forearm to stop him from drawing his wand. What was he doing?! The animal whipped its head around to face them and Malfoy sent light shooting from his wand. Harry quickly drew his own wand.
"Oh, alright." Ron sighed, "Oi! Malfoy! Parkinson! Care for a sit?" Hollered Ron. Pansy and Malfoy looked at each other and Pansy nodded to him. She was wearing a form fitting black pantsuit and he was wearing black slacks and a grey button down. If Malfoy hadn't told him he was gay, he would have thought they were on a date, so formal. The trio were wearing light wash jeans and plain shirts.
Harry had taken up the habit of sitting by Malfoy at breakfast. He's not sure why, the only thing that happened was insults being thrown back and forth.
"Rainy is not one to act on impulse. I think there is a good chance it's nothing, but a great chance it's something."
An uneventful week of lessons passed by quickly. He spent more time with Neville. Walks beside the lake and never ending classes. He kept his eye on Malfoy. So he wouldn't get into any trouble, of course. Harry was trying to find peace in the mundane and within himself. He had been banished to Hogwarts to heal and he was failing at even that. It's not like he was getting worse, if anything he has had a pretty good few weeks, but bad days happen. That's life. Right? Everyone struggles. He just struggles a tad more than most.
"I think you'll cope." Malfoy smiled, Harry smiled back. Weird to think he just had a mildly pleasant conversation with Draco Malfoy. He finally got back to his books. He forgot how much he hated studying. Who knew so much effort went into teaching? He did like it though. Maybe Hermione and Mcgonagall were right.
Hogwarts had been restored to its full glory after the havoc of the war, it even had some new touches. Harry had some new touches as well. He had longer, somehow messier hair, slight stubble on his chin, and a closet of muggle clothes. He would pick blue jeans and a jacket over robes any day. Still had the same glasses though.
His first day back. Back at the place where he grew up. Back at the place that traumatized him so deeply. Back with the memories floating in the air. But this time, he was teaching.
"See ya." And that was that. Shit, Mcgonagall is probably thinking the wrong thing. I mean, Harry doesn't even call Malfoy by his first name, there is absolutely nothing going on there. Maybe he should. But he wasn't going to be the first to use first names.
"And what's this about?" Pansy drawled. Her drawl was more sickening sweet than Malfoy's. Malfoy's was like auditory musk and honey. Harry snapped out of his reverie to Hermione telling Pansy they just wanted to chat. Pansy slid into the seat next to Hermione, forcing Malfoy into the seat next to Harry. Pansy and Hermione began talking, rather easily which was surprising, Ron added comments and laughed here and there. Malfoy and him took to staring at each other. Discretely, of course.
"Is that who I think it is?" Ron grumbled. Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson had just walked in. Shit.
"Have a good day, boys." She smiled in that knowing way that Hermione must have picked up from her, and walked away.
"Interesting." Pansy grinned. The night progressed. Everyone started to get a little more comfortable. Harry kept drinking.
"I forgave you a long time ago." Malfoy said with a tight smile. Harry smiled back, awkwardly. They walked down to breakfast and ate in silence.
Mcgonagall had not said anything about Malfoy and him. It had only been a few days but still. Harry didn't know what he was expecting, though. He had finished up grading a stack of papers as the sun sunk down below the outline of the Forbidden forest. Suddenly, heard a pounding on the door next to his. And then a pounding on his door. Harry threw on his coat and flung open the door. Malfoy was already there, accompanied by a soaking wet Ian and Jasper.
Those eleven inches written are a figure of speech really because I'd confused the centimetres and inches in my head :')
He pulled his arm from under the blankets as if there was a Bast-Ended Skrewt underneath and groaned. Stupid Malfoy!
At once Harry forgot all about feeling down. This was brilliant! Why hadn't they done this before? Eagerly Harry participated until they were both out of breath. Dazed he looked over Malfoy's shoulder and then screamed in horror.
His hand went to his pocket but before he could grasp his wand, a vaguely familiar voice said: 'Please, wait, I don't want to hurt you.'
His head tipped back against the couch, he closed his eyes and gave up fighting. As he stroked over his skin downwards again, over ribs and flat abdomen, he pretended his hand was Malfoy’s. Malfoy, whom he’d paid to touch him, to glide his hands all over Harry’s body, to follow the downy soft line of hair to the waistband of his jeans, which were suddenly too tight. Harry fumbled with the buttons, tugged at the fabric and pulled it down. He gasped as the fingertips – his fingertips - tentatively pushed into the dark hair. He couldn’t believe how arousing the image was of Malfoy’s hand touching Harry like this. The thought send a jolt straight to his cock. He shivered and slid his fingers over the hard shaft. His lips parted and a moan escaped. As he imagined silver-grey eyes looking at him – one eyebrow raised – while Malfoy stroked him, Harry felt close to coming. Little thrills of delight started flowing through his body, until he felt release soar through him and spray over his tight abdomen and jeans. He sagged on the couch, his arm limp beside him.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. ‘Ever heard of a Drying Spell, Potter? The perks of being a wizard, you know?’ Impatiently, he pointed again. ‘Or should I consider that proof of the fact that you did indeed bump your head?’
Apparently the Slytherin considered that a yes, because he took another two steps and without hesitation grasped his shoulders and slammed their lips together.
He tried to remember who'd been near, but was distracted when the other shyly added: 'Although I really would like to kiss you again.'
In this part I'd used Jae's Monthly Drabble Challenge #55 - I belong to you en #56 - You must be joking.
Although those quills were quite inventive and erotic – he'd loved to know more about that spell – he'd discovered he'd missed the boy. The soft voice, the sweet kisses and the gentle, yet strong, touches.
‘So now you’re handing out memorabilia? I get to have my wand back from the great Harry Potter?’ Malfoy scoffed. ‘Well, you know what, I don’t want it!’
He scowled at the memory, then tried to focus on The Boy Who Was a Bloody Puzzle, while he strolled down a corridor on the fifth floor. What was it he'd said when he'd fled that classroom? Something about a candy? He'd mentioned a name. Gregory? Jacob? George? George, that's it! That Weasley of course! The one from the joke shop. Oh sweet Salazar! He'd bet Potter ate something from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, the stupid Gryffindor.
"The Twelve Days of Christmas" is an English Christmas carol. The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin.
Harry moaned and writhed on the bed, while admitting to those crimes, but his eyes belied he was feeling very sorry.
Originally I planned for the song to say, 'Six candles burning' but then Draco interferred and demanded answers ;)
A ray of sunshine tortured his eyes. His head was pounding, there was a kink in his neck vertebrae that seemed to be connected with the sharp pain behind his left eye, and his mouth tasted like hell. He wouldn’t be surprised to discover that he’d been drooling. Talking of which …
‘Seems I was right, wasn’t I?’ Malfoy sounded smug, but, to his surprise, Harry detected a little insecurity underneath it.
There would have been a time that just the thought would have made him angry, but this time it gave him hope.
‘Is this the way you treat all your clients? Not that I’m a client or something,’ he said. ‘I didn’t know what to expect, it was my first time after all. ’
He could almost feel that it was the last kiss of that day. Desperately he tugged at the ropes, wanting nothing more than to grab the boy and hold him. He cursed.
Harry squeaked with an embarrassingly high voice when all of a sudden he was naked, with the exception of his pants.

Harry tried to keep his monster at bay but knew he had failed when Malfoy’s hands stilled and he asked: ‘Jealous much, Potter?’
Only when Ginny desperately shouted: 'Harry, I belong to you!', could she suddenly grasp what she'd seen; Draco Malfoy'd looked just as hurt as Ginny had the other day!
He, too, turned sideways and reached out until the tips of his fingers touched Draco’s shoulder. He let them slide over the pale skin to his hand.
Nevertheless, when he opened his eyes, there wasn't anyone to be seen. In fact, everything around him was pitch-black again.
'But why me?' Draco asked, knowing that now he'd only one question left but not caring anymore. He was unaware that his own thumb was stroking the boy's hand.
'Incarcerous manus,' the boy said. Before he could do anything ropes appeared out of nowhere and wrapped themselves around his wrists, after which they pulled his arms above his head and tied each of them to a bedpost.
So there he was, in the drawing room of Malfoy Manor, with Draco Malfoy who was pouring two cups of tea while he politely asked: ‘Raspberry, white chocolate or black cherry, Potter?’
Fingers glided to the nape of his head and pulled him closer. Before Draco's mouth would be occupied, he asked, 'Can't you tell me who you are?'
Draco didn't know what he'd been expecting when the ropes were conjured up but it certainly had not been the exchange of desserts.
Suddenly it rained petals all over his chest and his face. Before he could protest a body pressed against him, crushing the petals and deepening the fragrance as he kissed him again.
Harry expected Malfoy to show him what was behind the curtain but the man surprised him again by crossing the room and stepping outside, through the open door. He stared at Malfoy in obvious confusion. Was he playing tricks with Harry? First he didn’t want his wand back, then he wouldn’t let him leave but served him tea and cake, and now, after a tour about the Manor, he wanted Harry to go outside instead of showing him his working area?
was his moody thought. Well, however it would turn out to be, it had at least started wonderful, if only somewhat frustrating. He hadn't wanked as much in the entire last year as he had the last week.
"The Twelve Days of Christmas" is an English Christmas carol. The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin.
Potter never answered his question. Instead he released his arms and used them to pull Draco closer.
He was still considering how he could refuse that in a … well, chivalrous way, when his mouth opened and he blurted out: 'If I want to have some fun, I'd rather go snog the Giant Squid!'
Draco's eyes suddenly widened as he wondered if Potter had been under the influence of a love potion or something like that. His stomach felt like it dropped a few inches as disappointment washed over him. Who was the stupid one now?
At home? Malfoy was working from the Manor, too? Massaging wizard clients near his rooms? Where they could easily take advantage of him?
When finally something did happen, it was none of those things. Malfoy took Harry's hand and brought it to the side of his face, Harry's thumb against his chin.
He groaned softly. ‘Sorry to have bothered you then, Malfoy! Won’t happen again!’ He turned to leave, wanting to get away as soon as possible, but a hand grabbed his arm.
'It has come to my attention that you've been acting very weird since you've taken a Bludger to the head.' Malfoy cocked an eyebrow and Harry watched in fascination as the action made the little blond hairs above his eye move.
The fantasy was too much, and the feelings overwhelmed him, and he wanted … he needed … his whole body shuddered at the same moment that he realized the truth.
He was disappointed when hours went by without his sight being concealed. Trepidation made him so cranky that his housemates avoided him as much as they could. Only Pansy kept testing his temper, asking him why he'd suddenly disappeared from the library, where he went, if he'd met that mysterious person and so on.
The silence that followed didn’t last longer than four seconds, and then Dean was bombarded with questions.
‘Look, Malfoy, I probably should’ve come sooner, but I – I recently remembered that your wand was still in my possession, so I just wanted to give it back. Sorry it took this long, but with all the after war business … you know …’ Harry fumbled for the hawthorn wand while he rattled on.

Distracted by images of a hot and wet Malfoy, he was startled when the man suddenly stood behind him. He turned around abruptly and slipped on the wet wood. Next thing he knew, he was in the hot tub. Mysteriously, he hadn’t hurt himself, except for his neck, which was killing him again due to the abrupt movement. He groaned while grabbing his neck.
The Gryffindor looked intensely at him as if he was searching some answers. Something tugged at the corner of his mouth but Draco was afraid to hope for a smile. Just when his lungs began begging for much needed air, Potter opened his mouth. 'No, I wouldn't. And yes, I did.'

They stood there for Merlin knows how many minutes, kissing and touching, before they desperately needed some air.
For a moment Draco wished he could do the same; call out the other's name. But then he pushed that thought to the back of his mind. The fact that the boy gave him a soft kiss made that quite easy.
'You could,' the Slytherin replied. Their mouths were hovering above each other and Harry kissed him. It was nothing like earlier kisses. The feel of Malfoy's lips was amazing, their texture and pressure and how they moved slowly against Harry's, the longing almost tangible. Malfoy parted his lips and touched Harry's tongue with his own. When Harry gasped in surprise, Malfoy slipped his tongue into his mouth and began mapping every nook and crevice he could find, with an accuracy as if he tried to store them in his memory for ever.
And then he kissed him. A sweet, tender kiss that took Draco's breath away. He didn't notice that the boy undid his buttons, until he felt cool fingers on his chest, sliding up to his shoulders, pushing away his shirt. After a short struggle he lay down again, the sheet cold against his skin.
‘No, no, no,’ he moaned, not liking where this was going to. But the Firewhiskey – because what else could cause such stupid thoughts? – conjured images of those pale hands on Harry’s tanned skin, and he moaned again. Unable to think of anything else, he wondered if Malfoy’s hands would be rough; calloused from flying his broom during a Quidditch game, or soft because the git probably went for a manicure on a regular basis. But seeing that Malfoy had to work for money, there couldn’t have been many of those in the recent months, so his fingers would likely feel the same as Harry’s. His traitorous fingers, which had sneaked up under the hem of his shirt, moved over his abs in a lazy fashion. He put a little more pressure to it, because obvious Malfoy would be massaging the skin, not caressing. Something in the back of his mind screamed to stop acting so revolting, but his hands wouldn’t listen. They slid slowly over his chest, brushing his nipples, and he shivered at the sensation.
His lips closed over Potter's earlobe and when he sucked on the tender flesh he heard his breath hitch. Potter's reaction made his heart beat faster. While his tongue traced the rim of Potter's ear, his hand trailed the waistband and then moved southwards. He squeezed Potter's cock through the thin fabric of his trousers and found that Potter was already hard. His throat got dry and his trousers too tight. He released the abused flesh he'd been nibbling on because he had a sudden urge to see Potter's face. Their eyes locked. Potter's were wide, the green darkened to nearly black. He looked almost desperate. Desperate for what? Draco wondered. For more? For an escape? He squeezed again and watched with interest how Potter pulled his lip between his teeth.

For a moment there was silence. Hermione expected to be ridiculed but except for Harry, whose eyes had grown even larger, nobody seemed to take notice of her. Even Ron only had eyes for Harry and yelled: 'So when are they going to give you the Order of Merlin, first class. If anyone deserves that it would be you!'
His patented Malfoy glare hadn't worked on her since second year, so he bit the inside of his cheek every now and then, and tried to be patient. Having patience wasn't one of his virtues though.
‘So, do you? Treat your clients this way, I mean,’ Harry repeated. He knew it was a silly question, stupid even, but he had to know how Draco would answer.
While he undid Malfoy’s button and zip, Malfoy cradled Harry’s bollocks through his pants. As trousers and pants pooled around Malfoy's feet, he stepped out of them and kicked them across the room. Impatiently, Harry lifted his hips to get freed from the tight fabric. Instead of helping him, Malfoy pulled him out of the chair and tugged Harry’s pants down.
'Please,' he said softly. Apparently his mother had been right; it really was the magic word. The boy kissed him, not franticly, but sweet and tenderly. It felt wonderful. Draco parted his lips and touched the other's tongue with his own. The boy whimpered. He wrapped his arms around Draco's waist to lift him up and carry him to the bed, probably. Absent-mindedly Draco realized he must have used that spell again, instead of the powder.
'Is it?' The challenge in Malfoy's voice contradicted the insecurity Harry saw in his eyes for just a moment. He started moving his digit over the wonderful soft hairs and asked absent-mindedly: 'Is it what?'
He'd made the joke about George's candy rashly and now he waited for Malfoy to snap something insulting. His movements stilled. Then Malfoy pulled his head up until their noses were a few inches apart and looked at him with an enigmatic smile.
He managed not to stumble on those last words, but Pansy picked up the slightly hopeful tone all the same. She rolled her eyes and sighed: 'Honestly, Draco!'
Harry didn't even notice this time that he unconsciously had lifted his hand again until he almost touched Malfoy's face.
's brilliant,' he gasped and couldn't image that it could get any better. And then warm, wet lips closed around the head and sucked lightly. He whimpered helplessly and threw his head back against the bed. When he started trashing about, the boy held his hips and took him further in his mouth. Draco thought he would have come right that moment had he been able to watch it. The boy pressed his tongue against the vein at the underside of his cock and then started bobbing his head. Draco's world spiralled out of control and it was too much and yet not enough. Never enough.
They lapsed into silence while they ate their cheesecake and drank tea, which Harry found oddly comfortable. But eventually they were finished and when Harry looked up, Malfoy was watching him with interest. His eyebrow was raised as if to encourage Harry to talk.
'Fuck, Potter!' Draco breathed. He pulled the glass from Potter's fingers, gulped it down and tossed it behind him. The glass hadn't even hit the floor yet, before Draco was already straddling Potter's lap and burying his hands in the dark hair to keep his head still. Potter's lips parted, probably to stutter some more but the motion only seemed to deepen Draco's desire. Teeth grazed his lower lip – maybe due to the tremors but who cared – and then their tongues met. Potter whimpered and the sound sent shivers over Draco's skin. He wondered absently if that candy was contagious. He wanted to explore Potter's mouth, wanted to discover every sensitive place, but he was a little afraid that he might be bitten by Potter's shattering teeth. So he let the Gryffindor do the exploring and found out he was well-equipped for the job.
'So today the candy made you feel shivery,' he said, more to himself, 'yesterday … ah, yesterday there was that adoring crowd around at breakfast. Obviously the effect of the candy didn't reach very far, thank Salazar!' He almost murmured the last words and thought about the first two days that the Gryffindor had been acting weird. 'Ah, feeling blue,' he said with a grin at the scowling boy on the sofa. 'You thought you were just feeling blue instead of looking the part!'
Draco tried to stifle a moan when the second cherry was crushed and the Maraschino flavoured liquid flooded his mouth. A third cherry, a fourth … he began to feel a bit dizzy although he didn't know if he should blame the liqueur or the kisses. He swallowed and his tongue slipped out. He licked across his cherry stained lips and was met by yet another cherry.
Harry was stunned that Draco trusted him enough to share something so personal with him. In a way it felt even more intimate than sharing his body. A warm feeling flooded inside his body. Emotions, that were still small and fragile, but could become something more, found there way from his toes to his fingertips.

When he could see again, Draco stared in shock at his surroundings. It looked nothing like the class room he'd found the other day. He would've thought it to be a totally different one, if not for the bed he had transformed yesterday. The room was lit with dozens of candles, all of them white with the exception of six –
Draco paced before the fireplace for a few moments while he pondered on Potter's behaviour over the last four days.
'Well, it's supposed to last only for three hours, so I better look for some distraction in the meantime.' Harry supplied.

It was only then that Draco realized that there was something lacking from his usual treat; the sweet, firm, cherries atop the ice cream, which he normally ate first; sucking at them with him lips around the stems. Before he could voice that thought however, the boy sought his lips again. Between his teeth he held a cherry. Draco tasted the sweetened flesh with his tongue as he tried to work the delicious fruit into his own mouth. But the teeth bit down and the crushed cherry was pushed between Draco's lips. While he swallowed, the other lapped at the corner of his mouth where some juice was trickling down to his chin.
Harry wanted to react but it was hard enough to try and keep his emotions in check when he felt Malfoy’s fingers combing through his hair in search for a bruise or swelling.

He looked at the two of them, but felt nothing. Dean was feeding his girlfriend tiny biscuits and kissing the crumbs off her lips. When Ginny caught him watching them, she smiled. As Harry returned the gesture, he realized that the only feeling in his chest at that moment was happiness for the two of them.
Harry looked into the same silver-grey eyes he’d thought about just yesterday and blinked for a moment. By Merlin, he hoped that he wouldn’t blush. To avoid those damned eyes he let his own travel over the man. A pristine, white shirt, which looked like it had just been ironed, underneath a black jacket, matching the trousers. The man looked impeccable. Like … he had a date? Harry’s chest monster woke up and rumbled warningly.
He didn’t even protest when Malfoy manoeuvred him around so he sat with his back to the cushion, and adjusted the headrest so Harry’s head was lying comfortable again. It wasn’t until Malfoy started talking, that Harry realized the vulnerable position he was now in.
