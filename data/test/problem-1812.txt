I don’t know exactly what she means, but I am confused.  “Even if I wanted to, I don’t have the ability to do anything,” I say.  “ The people that are doing this are powerful, politically.  I wouldn’t know the first thing about trying to outsmart them.  Someone was powerful enough to steal all of my memories.  I don’t think that a summoning spell is going to be enough, if I decided to fight them.”
“I resent your tone, Mother.  I seem to recall both you and Father encouraging me to restore the Malfoy name.  And you certainly didn’t ask any questions when Astoria and I began our courtship.”  Draco continued to watch his Father and Cass.  They were chatting animatedly, and at one point, Cass laughed, her beautiful face looking warm and happy.
She looks at him for a very long time.  Finally, she admits, “No, not all.  About a third.  It’s a direct petition to Mother Magic, and if you fail in your petition, she’ll take the magic anyway, and then refuse to help you.”
Draco had never enjoyed hurting other people.  (Teasing them, yes, finding ways to feel a bit superior, obviously.)  The war had stripped him bare of any desire to exert such tendencies on another living thing.  His actions during the last crazy days of Voldemort’s rule had been full of cowardice, and had begun to change the way that he’d looked at others.  Escaping with his life had seemed such a gift that Draco had vowed, sitting in the barely-recognizable rubble of the Great Hall, to be a force for good, and if not that, to never allow someone else to hurt by his actions.  Which is why it hurt so much to have destroyed Harry as he did.  Especially Harry, who had such a capacity for love, and was so deserving of a life that was full of the adoration he deserved.  To learn that his actions hadn’t nudged Harry toward his family, his wife-and-three-kids that Draco felt he deserved…well, it hurt.
Harry bit his lip for a moment, and then said, “Yes.  I did owe him that, and I made the foolish decision to ignore his due.  It’s indefensible, really, but I was a twenty year old man who had a fairly abnormal childhood.  In hindsight, I realize that the choice I made was quite immature and unfair, but I thought I was doing the right thing at the time.”
Draco watched her go for as long as he could stand, before saying, “Wait.”  Narcissa stilled, but didn’t turn around.  Her back tensed, as though she was awaiting further criticism.  “I could use some advice, if you have time.  I don’t know the first thing about baby care.”
“We can’t take him to St. Mungo’s.”  The mulish set to Weasley’s jaw was beginning to set Draco’s nerves on edge.
He stood, a little stiffly, and took their dishes to the kitchen.  He put them in the sink, a little harder than necessary, and started to wash them.  One cup in particular seemed to have a hint of a tea stain on it, and so he concentrated hard on eradicating it.  As he rubbed the soapy sponge on the cup, over and over, he blinked hard to keep his stupid, foolish tears at bay.
Harry sighed.  “I don’t hate it, exactly.  It was my home for so many years, but it’s sometimes hard to be here.  Brings up a lot of memories.  I’m thrilled that I can show you all of the things I love about England, though.”
“I’ve come to a dead end, with nothing but a bunch of dead rats to show for it,” Draco said, when they’d dispatched Harry to bed, and had settled in the lab.
We apparate to my flat, and I immediately make tea.  I have no desire for tea, but I desperately need something to do other than look at him.  I’m a bit afraid that my resolve will falter now.  I can’t though.  Even if I feel an attraction to Draco, my feet are on firm ground for a change.  I pass him a cup, and wrap my fingers around my own mug.  I stare into the liquid, and ponder the ridiculousness of my life.  Ron had needed to tell me how I take my tea.
“I suppose,” Draco said.  “No point in waiting, since you’ve validated my thought process.”  He conjured a rat, and took careful measurements of its length and weight, then dropped four drops of the tincture onto its back.  Nothing happened, and Hermione sighed deeply.  “It didn’t happen right away,” Draco said.  “Harry was in the decontamination shower when he changed.”  They waited a few more minutes, and Draco muttered, “I wonder,” before casting
Harry was suddenly filled with cold, icy rage.  Normally, he and Hermione bantered away in good humour, but he had always been sensitive about the incident with Malfoy in sixth year, and how it had been a long-running joke between Ron and Hermione that Harry was obsessed with Malfoy.  She’d dismissed his suspicions then, and she was implying now that he’d be unable to perform his duties.  “That’s out of line, and a low blow, besides,” he said coldly.
“I’m kind of disgusting, do you mind if I quickly shower?  Are you cold?  Do you want a change of clothes?”
“At least you were thinking of me.  It was…an olive branch, sort of. I’d hoped that you would write back.”
“Cass, you don’t really want to see this.  She’s going to scold me, and it’s going to make Uncle Professor’s lectures look like a birthday party.  I’ve just humiliated myself in front of the entire world. Could you possibly spare me the further insult of witnessing this?”
Scorpius’ name was called, and Scorpius dragged his Mother by the arm as he raced through the doorway.  “Dean,” he said delightedly, as the Mediwizard gave him a high five and gently placed him on the cot in an examining room.  “I brung you my dragon to see!”
Harry, who was struggling with waves of nausea, put his head between his knees.  “You’re a demon, truly.  Nobody can enjoy that.”
He sat on the other side of Harry, who was now staring straight ahead with wide, terrified eyes.  Harry cast Tempus and Astoria laughed.  “It’s been fifteen minutes, Harry,”
She perched on the arm of Harry’s chair.  “It went well,” she said.  “They’re finding common ground.”
Gold acquired, we leave Gringotts, and walk the short distance to Fortesque’s.  It’s packed with people, and a whole bunch of them come up to me, wanting to shake my hand, or thank me.  One woman asks me to sign her baby, which, Boy Who Lived or not, is a bit weird.  I’m polite, but firm with everyone, and flatly refuse to sign any body parts, but I make sure to smile while I say it, and after the initial furor, we’re left alone.  Ron and Hermione are now openly staring.  Only Rose is studiously looking through the glass cases, trying to select her ice cream flavour.  “What?” I ask them.
Harry hadn’t said anything to Draco, other than ‘hello’, and so he didn’t expect Draco to speak to him.  “I’ve decided to attend your press conference,” he said tightly.
“I think you’re under the misinformation that I walked away from our relationship without a single look back.”
The house elf came into the room, a box in her hands.  “Master Draco, an owl has just been delivering this.”
As Harry started to reply, Draco entered the room, holding a parchment and saying, “Astoria, have you seen the…Potter.”
Minerva had made sure that their quarters had a large enough sitting room to accommodate visitors, and so when a knock sounded at exactly 9:00, Harry took an enormous breath, and cast a nervous glance at Cass’ room, where she’d agreed to stay until he could introduce her.
“Well, it’s just weirdly convenient.  Anonymous tip, the wards kick everyone but me out, I remember oddly specific things.  What if I’d figured something out?  About the Slytherins, and the probation.”
“Draco, obviously, we want to help anyone who’s living with a medical condition get access to the right healthcare for them.  I’d really like to do some research, and discuss things a little further with you.  Could you meet me for lunch tomorrow?”  Hermione’s brown eyes met his, and he saw a flash of empathy.
Oh guys, somehow I totally forgot that yesterday was Thursday.  Working from home for months on end will do that to a girl!  Apologies for the late update, and hope you enjoy this chapter!
“Dad, I want to stay a bit longer.  I want to spend more time with Papa and Scorpius, and I want to go to the Weasleys’, and…I’m not ready for it all to be over.”
Astoria was waiting for them in a wide, spacious family room.  “Harry,” she said warmly, kissing his cheek.  “Thank you for coming.”
“Tell me about your specific judgements in the case of these individuals.  We’ll start with Pansy Parkinson.”
“Okay, thanks,” Harry said.  “Cass, it’s your decision.  Would you like to proceed with the testing?”
Harry made a move to stand up, to run from the room, but his legs were surprisingly wobbly, and he sank back down.  “Professor McGonagall, please.”
“Scorpius,” Draco said stiffly, uncomfortable.  Harry wasn’t sure whether it was a warning to Scorpius about being presumptuous, or a preference that Harry Potter stay far away from Draco's family.
“Because we’re best friends.  Just in case, I’m going to stay close to you.  So he doesn’t forget about me.”
He casts a look at Pansy, and continues, “But we were very lucky, in comparison.  The Ministry was eager to ensure that there was never another Dark Lord, and so the punishments that had been given to Death Eaters didn’t seem enough.  Soon, they started targeting their children, putting them all on probation, but making it impossible for them to survive.”  I’m starting to feel impatient.  I know all of this.
The floo flamed green, and Pansy stepped out.  She was wearing a battered t-shirt and a pair of trackies.  “Darling.  Did I not mention that this is casual?  You’re too buttoned up in those robes, Draco.  What have you on underneath?”  She tugged the clasp of his robe, revealing the jumper and a pair of battered jeans.  “Oh that will do perfectly.  You look positively edible.”  She dumped his robes on the ground, grabbed his hand and threw the floo powder into the flames, yelling ,“Grimmy!”
“So now you can understand why I need your help.  It’s actually a good thing that you’re still close to Draco.  I don’t want him or his family hurt by this.  We’re only here because Cass wants to donate bone marrow to Scorpius.  I need you to make sure that we’re protecting them, and Cass.”
“Yes,” Harry said simply.  The truth was that Hermione’s parents had never returned from Australia after the war.  They got their memories back, but they were quite upset by it all, and their relationship with Hermione remained a bit strained.
Harry smiled warmly, but said, “Thank you for asking me.  I really appreciate the offer, but I don’t socialize, really.”
“How hard can it be?” Draco scoffed, not letting any of his utter terror at the situation to show on his face.
After we’ve eaten, and Rose has disappeared to play somewhere, Ron and Hermione look at me expectantly.  I manfully avoid groaning, and meet their eyes.  “Harry,” Hermione says, and there’s something in her tone, something that makes me bristle with annoyance.  “We need to talk about what happened last night.”
“If you need anything, Hermione can give you our floo address.  I’ll come by on my lunch break tomorrow.”
“Yes,” I say definitively.  “That.”  I've got a fifty-fifty chance of being institutionalized with a story like this, but this place is insane.  It takes me no time at all to decide to give this a go, and if nothing changes, I'll just fuck off to my imaginary cabin in the woods, and they can sort things without me.  It takes a matter of minutes to floo call Luna, who agrees to come over in the morning.
The words hit Harry like arrows.  “Well, it’s old history now, I suppose.  There’s no sense in dredging it up.  I’d rather think about how we go forward.  I don’t suppose there’s any way to gain your forgiveness for what I did?”
“Alright.”  Mister Fortesque looks a bit wary, but he’s such a friendly sort of man that even wariness looks good natured.
Harry cringed at the sound of his name, but he obediently swung his eyes in Hermione’s direction before immediately looking back at Draco.
“Actually,” Draco said, “I have an appointment that I can’t miss on Thursday.  You’re welcome to come tomorrow, but I need help on Thursday at one, specifically.”
Draco knew his voice sounded overly formal, and inwardly cringed, but Cass merely cocked her head at him, and then turned her attention to her Dad.  “You’re sure you’re going to be okay?”
“I wouldn’t ever, I told you that, Harry.  You can stay here as long as you like, and if you wanted to leave, the Weasleys would take you in a heartbeat.”
Harry felt a wave of sympathy for his oldest friend, who still couldn’t muster up the slightest bit of emotional intelligence.  “I don’t think that Ginny and I are what’s bothering you.”
“You’re magical, Violet,” he said solemnly.  “A witch, actually.  I know that this sounds unbelievable, but magic is real, and there are others who are just like you.”
it turns out to be.  The same potion that was administered to Wendell in the Department of Mysteries is in abundant supply, and a woman, who Draco whispers is named Griselda Marchbanks, seems to be in charge.
For a minute, I consider turning him down.  My thoughts are churning like the ocean, and I’m not sure if I have the capacity to deal with Draco’s grief on top of it.  But I don’t particularly want to lie in a lonely bed either.  I nod, and his eyes fill for a moment, before he mutters, “Thanks.”
“Sit.”  It was awkward, and not the effusive welcome Draco would have liked, but Harry also hadn’t thrust his jumper through the flames at him.  Draco perched uneasily on the sofa, his body tight and stiff.  There was an ocean of throw pillows on the sofa, making it difficult to get comfortable.  Draco wriggled a little, trying to surreptitiously rearrange the ones wedged behind his lower back.  Harry soon returned with two jam jars filled with liquid.  Thank fuck, it wasn’t orange.  Taking a sip, Draco realized that it was Firewhiskey, and the familiar bite made his throat sore.  And his heart sore.
Cass’ lovely grey-green eyes flashed.  “Why should I?  For nine years, he’s been happy enough to ignore me, and now that his kid, his real kid is sick, he wants me to help him?”
“We’re working on delaying my responses.  A little bit of exposure therapy.  When I’m worried that the germs in my kitchen will make someone sick, I try to wait to clean it, or sometimes, to only partially clean it.  I’m not strong enough to ignore the bad thoughts, yet, but I’m working on it.”
He hears a heavy sigh, and the hulking frame sinks to his haunches, looks at him with gentleness and says “Not going to make this easy, huh mate?  No, Harry is pretty sure he’s not making it easy.  Ron reaches out to him, and picks him up, carrying him fireman style down the stairs to his bathroom.  Waving his wand at the taps, a bath begins to fill, and Ron sits him gently down on the edge of the tub.  When the bath is full, he removes the blanket, not mentioning the fact that Harry is naked underneath.  Harry feels bereft at the loss of the blanket, especially when Ron’s nose wrinkles and he tosses it out in the hallway.  Kreacher will whisk it away and wash it, and then nothing will smell of Draco ever again.  Ron lowers him into the bath, washes his hair, hands him a sudsy sponge.  Harry looks at it dumbly for a while.  With a world-weary sigh, Ron says “If you ever doubt that I’m your best friend.”  He washes Harry quickly, drains the bath, wraps him in a fluffy towel.  When it becomes evident that Harry can’t comprehend what to do with the boxers, jogging pants and t-shirt that Ron hands him, he heaves another sigh and holds the boxers for Harry to step into, followed by the joggers and pulls the t-shirt over his head.  There’s a bit of a skirmish as Ron wrestles his arms through the appropriate holes and then he looks at him.  “You look like shit, Har.  ‘Mione would never forgive me if I left you here.  Come on.”
“Now,” Harry continued, “you’re going to listen to me as I write this report and tell you about Violet, who turned one of her classmates into a newt, and then we’re going to go back to mine and listen to Spice Girls until Kreacher shouts at me.”   And she did, and they did, and the shadows didn’t disappear completely from Tamsin’s eyes, but she still did an admirable job at harmonizing as they sang ‘Stop’.
He storms away, and I take a minute to collect myself before leaving the cupboard.  Fuck.  Stupid old Harry.  Well, I’m going to stay the fuck out of this, that’s all I know. Cabin in the woods, here I come.
share yourself with us, Harry. You give your time, and your love, and you never once let anyone see any of the things you deal with.  You keep everyone at arm’s length.  You don’t let anyone help you with anything.”
Harry didn’t want to intrude on his friends’ family life, but he, not for the first time, wondered if he should intervene.  Instead, he tightened his hug, and said, “And, you know that you’re my best girl?”
“But secretly,” Draco continued, “I thought that Harry Potter was a hero, and the most powerful wizard alive.  When I found out that I would be attending Hogwarts with him, I knew that he would be my best friend.  As a rich, spoiled little boy, I’d never been told ‘no’ before, and when Harry refused my friendship, I couldn’t understand it.  I wanted his attention desperately, and so I pulled all sorts of stunts to try to gain it.  If he wouldn’t be my friend, he wasn’t going to be permitted to ignore me.”
“His lectures had surpassed boring, and were bordering on fantasy.  The Board decided that it wouldn’t stand, and so they convinced him to relocate to the classrooms near the Hufflepuff Dormitories.”
“You’ll be liked just fine, just not drunk at midnight,” he answers.  I take his hand and smile delightedly at him.  He leads me inside, and we walk for ages until we reach his bedroom.  It’s enormous, bigger than my flat.  He shuts the door, and waves his wand a bit.  Door locking spell, maybe.  I try to help him undress me, but I’m clumsy and my extremities feel a bit rubbery.  When I’m stripped down to my pants, he leads me to the bed and pulls back the duvet.  “Climb in, then, and wait a sec.  Don’t throw up again.”
With a groan, Harry removed his fingers as Draco arched up, desperate to be filled.  Pressing his cock past the guardian muscle, Harry paused for a moment, watching as Draco’s eyes fluttered closed.  His lips were parted a little, swollen and red from their enthusiastic kissing.  Before long, Draco had begun to cant his hips, encouraging Harry to move.   Pressing further inside, Harry fully seated himself inside Draco, and paused for a moment to push Draco’s hair out of his eyes, lay a gentle kiss on his forehead.  “Harry, please,” Draco begged.
Cass gave him a look, but was happy enough to be taken to see their quarters, especially as she met her first house elf, and they were quickly making friends.  The elf gave Cass a longing look, as though she’d like to stay and chat longer, but Harry noticed, and assured the elf that she’d be welcome to return later.
“Kingsley,” I say, with a hint of humour in my voice, “you know that the Prophet isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on.”
The tiny figure illuminated by the hallway light didn’t move.  Harry crouched down beside the mattress.  “Are you hurt at all?”
Three days later, Draco was no closer to a solution.  His Father’s contacts had indeed contacted him back, but none of them had a regular customer for love potion.  It didn’t make sense.  Draco knew that the potions community was a small one, and all of the reputable masters refused to sell any form of the substance.  He’d been so sure that Ginevra would be using one of the dodgy ones.
been their home.  Draco hadn’t officially moved from the Manor, but he had spent nearly every night, every weekend with Harry.  His clothes had hung in Harry’s closet, and Draco had been the most loving, devoted boyfriend Harry could have asked for.  He was supportive and generous, and they laughed and teased and drank gin on the rooftop patio on the top floor.  It was a good life, and Harry loved it, loved Draco.
It was not the only thing he’d learned about his daughter in the five months since the terrible day when she’d apparated through his wards and disappeared.  Draco had been frantic.  He’d called the Aurors, and Hogwarts, and his parents.  There’d been no answer at the Weasley-Granger’s, and Draco had been on his knees in front of the floo, his head in his hands, when Molly Weasley had called him.  Cass had arrived at the Burrow, upset and furious, but she was safe.
“I have to go,” Harry said suddenly.  “I can’t be here, when you tell your parents.  I have to go.  Where can I go?  What do I do?” He seemed suffused by panic, and Draco understood.  Sometimes, the horror of a situation came in waves, each one more overwhelming than the previous one.
That surprises me, especially because, as I consider it, it’s true, sort of.  “Kind of, but not exactly.  It’s like I’ve forgotten things, but I’m not sure what.  I’m pretty sure I haven’t done anything to be guilty about.”
“So,” Hermione starts.  She's wringing her hands and won't meet my eyes.  “The Psychologist and I worked together to bridge the gap between what we know about Magical theory and mind-healing and Muggle psychology.  It was easy to identify the trauma that you’d experienced, and how damaging that had been to your overall mental health.  It took longer to map that lifelong trauma to your magical outbursts.  We spent ages trying to figure out why it manifested when it did, and whether it could be resolved.  The Department Head supervised my work, and I had to report to Kingsley every month.  The entire Ministry was interested in understanding whether you presented any danger to society, and they certainly were interested in how they could use you as a weapon.”  She puts her head in her hands for a moment.  “That was where it all started to go wrong.  I started to, very carefully, downplay the situation.  I was trying to protect your privacy, and keep you from being locked up in somewhere.”
She touched his arm, and he shook his head a little, then smiled at her.  “I’m fine,” he said dreamily.  “Thanks for coming to get me, guys.”
“Maybe we just need to pick a more sympathetic journalist?” Draco asks finally.  “If Lovegood wrote the article and sold it as a special feature to the Prophet, we’d have more control over the tone.”
Harry looked up.  He’d wondered if John had been flirting with him the last time he’d been here.  His work meant that he visited Mungo’s fairly often.  He was a nice looking man, with sandy brown curls, and dark eyes.  He was quite a bit taller than Harry, and broad in the shoulders.  And he was a decent bloke, easy to talk to.
.  He hopes that if he says it enough times, it will stop causing the stabbing anguish in his chest.  So far, it hasn’t worked.  At least, however, Harry is becoming aware of his surroundings, and doesn’t slip again into the fugue state that captured him on the roof.
And then he kissed Draco.  This time the kiss wasn’t a tentative press of lips.  Harry’s tongue was audaciously thrusting into his mouth, and he sucked on Draco’s bottom lip and then he was crushed against Draco’s body, his erection hard against Draco’s thigh.  They kissed and kissed, and Draco’s lips were hurting and chapped, but he didn’t give a fuck, because it was as though someone had told him that he was allowed to have air again.  It was delicious.  Harry pulled away to catch his breath.
“Well, yes, but for different reasons.  He’s going to be awfully upset with me when he learns that I didn’t tell him about you.  He deserves better than to find out by reading tomorrow’s Daily Prophet.”
Soon, the case had been opened, and everyone was happily getting pissed again.  Draco started edging towards the doorway, but his progress was arrested by a bushy-haired witch with fire in her eyes.
“That’s not it, not really.  We just built our patterns when we were eleven.  I was a lazy little sod, who was used to getting my own way, and you were prone to throwing yourself in the path of danger without any consideration for your own hide.  She was the little know-it-all who did most of the research.  She’s good at it, and she kind of likes bossing us around, but it doesn’t hurt her to be reminded that we’re not kids anymore.”
“And the potion smuggler cast some sort of hex on him.  He was found unconscious and taken to Mungo’s.  When he woke up, he didn’t have a clue what was going on.”
When he finally spoke, it was more like a breath than a voice.  Draco leaned closer, desperate to hear what Harry’s heart desired most. “Cass,” he said softly.  “A family.  A proper family where I feel like I’m part of it, not watching from the edges.”    Miriam seemed to ignore Draco’s agonized look.
“I know,” I soothe.  “I wouldn’t suggest this if I didn’t think that they could help.  It’s the only idea I have.”
Harry is different.  He’s put on a little weight, a little muscle, lost the skeletal, foot-in-the-grave look he had when Draco last saw him.  His eyes are clear, and bright.
“Thank you.  I know I didn’t do any of the traditional wizarding culture things.  I got her a book when she was little, but when I tried to teach her any of it, she asked a bunch of questions and then laughed at me when I couldn’t answer them.”
“Oh!” I say.  “Yes, I suppose you should come in.”  I step back, and she gives me a thoughtful look as she steps inside.  “How are you?  How did you get out?”
It didn’t take long to gather all of Harry’s things and put the potions into a charmed carrier that would prevent them from breaking.  Hermione shrunk them all down, and Ron carried Rose in one arm, and guided Harry in the other as they disappeared through the floo.  Hermione was about to follow them, when she suddenly turned back, “Thank you, Draco, for being so understanding.  I don’t think it will take him long to get over this, but I know it will mean a lot to him that you gave him the space he needed.  I’ll be in touch.”
“And a half,” Scorpius corrected.  “I’m little because I have Fanconi Anemia, and it means I don’t grow as quickly as other kids.”
He wakes to the feeling of the bed dipping as someone else crawls into it.  “Wha’ time?” he mumbles sleepily.
no family members.  If it had been Kingsley, I would have had to come up with something else.  Hermione was livid, of course, and then after she was finished shouting at me, she headed off to the research library.  She said she’ll come by around seven, if you don’t mind.”
Please return to my home immediately upon receipt of this letter.  I need to speak to you regarding something of utmost urgency.
After discussing with Hermione, Draco had called Greg, and he’d gone to get Cass immediately.  She allowed Draco to meet them at the Portkey office, mostly because she wouldn’t be allowed to leave the country without parental permission.  She’d been prickly, and standoffish as they waited for the Portkey, flatly refusing to let Draco come with them.  As he’d watched them catch the Portkey, Draco’s heart had been in his throat.
After the initial three dates, Harry had detected an initial softening of Draco’s attitude.  It wasn’t easy and the changes were subtle.  Draco was still prickly and difficult, prone to snide comments and offended silences.  Harry was…smitten.  He liked how Draco was all sharp edges and angles, how it took effort to push past the boundaries that Draco had built up to prevent being hurt.  He loved how, every once in a while, he’d catch Draco looking at him with a little wrinkle in his brow, as though Draco were trying to figure out what the catch was.
Harry looked fucking adorable in hockey kit.  His cheeks had pinked in the cool air of the rink, and his eyes were shining with determination.  Draco longed to kiss his chapped lips, but instead looked away, squared his shoulders and said “There, you look a proper hockey player now.”
“Well, that’s different.  I’d love to see you play sometime.”  Draco coloured.  Harry wanted to see him again?
“First of all, I'm not convinced that Dumbledore didn't lay that out like a fucked up scavenger hunt to train his little pet sacrifice.  And secondly, I only saved the fucking thing because I had friends helping me,” I protest, and then my brain finally catches up.  It’s time to fall back on the secret to my success.  “Draco, can I call Hermione and Ron?”
I remember a red-haired little girl who blushed and ran out of the room every time I spoke to her, and how my love for her as an adult felt alarmingly similar to what I felt for Ron and Hermione, and I remember Uncle Vernon’s harsh criticism of ‘poofs’, and sleepless nights wondering how I could be part of a family that wasn’t mine to claim.
“Do you often find that people are interested in spending time with you when you stun them and kidnap them?”
I shrug.  “Dunno, really.  The healers say my Magical Core is fine, but I can’t really remember much.  Anything from before that I could do wandlessly and silently, I remember, but all of the incantations and wand movements are gone completely.”
They do.  And it’s a slightly poorer, and much more stylish me that floos home several hours later with an entirely new wardrobe.  I survey myself in the mirror and wish that I had time to get a haircut before my date with Draco, but since I don’t, I use a potion I find in my bathroom cabinet to try to make the bird’s nest on my head simmer down a little.  After a few experiments, one of which forces me to shower the whole lot off and start over, my hair looks mad, still, but more ‘windswept’ and less ‘pulled backwards through a hedge’.
As though expecting punishment, Harry cautiously emerged, his back hunched.  “I’m sorry,” he whispered.  “I didn’t know that would happen.”
“You did, actually,” Draco said, uncertain why he was bringing it up, but wanting Harry to know how much his mum loved him.  “You had a Mother who loved you very much.”
“I know!  I just wanted him to have a few days where he had someone on his side.  I expect he’s going to hate me even more when he remembers.”
“Those are all very noble goals, and something that you can work towards, Draco.  But, I want to tell you about Muggle airplanes.”
“It’s true, Draco,” Harry said cheerfully, “I do sleep in a bed nearly every single night, just like a real human.”
It’s still only half ten, so Fortesque’s is empty when I arrive.  Louise is carrying a heavy barrel of ice cream to place in the cooled counter.  I rush to her side and grab it from her.  “Thanks,” she breathes, and she looks delighted to see me.  “You’re becoming our best customer!”
“No!” Draco was shouting now.  “No!  Damnit, Lara, this isn’t to settle a score, or to gain favour from those who hold political sway.  For once in my life, I want to be proud that I did the difficult thing, that I chose the
“Yes, really.  Do you suppose we should get your your broom today, so that you have something to look forward to?”
Nina’s voice echoed through the sitting room, and Luna whispered into Malcolm’s cupped hands.  Harry didn’t really understand Luna’s unconventional version of providing comfort, but he’d seen it in action enough times to let it proceed.  Malcolm’s eyes were drooping, and Luna pressed a gentle kiss into each tiny palm.  “He’s ready for bed, I think,” she said.
“Fuck. off. Malfoy,” Ron bites out, and it feels like he’s going to rip my arm off as he’s dragging me along.
Draco’s childhood bedroom had changed little since he was Harry’s age.  Once he’d started Hogwarts, he’d had no interest in spending time improving a space he spent little time in, and during the war, well, decorating was the furthest thing from his mind.
He found himself returning again the following week to drink tea, and discuss wand lore.  And the week after that.  And before long, Mister Ollivander had become Garrick, and Harry had become Harry, and they were drawing up an apprenticeship contract.  For a time, he’d been blissfully happy.
“No,” Harry said honestly.  “It’s taking every bit of control I have not to grab Cass and run home.”
The next week is a little better.  Harry feels less burdened by his secrets, that somehow, by having confessed his brokenness to Draco, he isn’t as captive to it.  Snape continues to subtly stalk him as he roams the corridors, but he doesn’t speak to Harry.  Harry isn’t sure if he’s relieved or disappointed by Snape’s silence, but it’s comforting to see him, looming like a protective bat, in whatever landscape is nearest.
“Please don’t start saying that, Hermione will have my bollocks if I’ve taught you to call yourself Potter, and say a fairly unbecoming curse word.”
“I’m also surprised.  I was brought here under false pretences,” he admitted.  “If I’d known I’d make people uncomfortable, I never would have come.  To be honest, it never occurred to me that Pansy would be living here with such a…diverse group.”
I open the door and regard the stranger standing on the opposite side.  She has tiny features, close set, and her nose turns up at the end.  Her dark hair is long, hanging lank against her face.  She glares at me, so I stare back, an eyebrow raised, until she says, “Potter.”
Later, Harry would hotly deny that he’d flown over the table and launched himself at the reporter.  He was absolutely certain that it hadn’t been him that was screaming that the reporter was a filthy piece of shit.  But, the press conference had ended rather abruptly after that last, offensive question, and he still wasn’t sure why Greg had sat on him at one point.  His knuckles were suspiciously bloodied for a man who hadn’t caused some sort of a ruckus, and it did seem strange that Pansy was so furious with him that she wasn’t speaking to him at all.
“Merlin, Granger, tell me that someone stopped you.  Tell me that this wasn’t the basis of your entire theory,” Draco pleads.
Two weeks pass.  Harry tells himself: Draco is marrying someone else in four weeks.  He wants to go home. Hermione tells him that he shouldn’t be surrounded by memories.  He stays, the spare bedroom at Ron and Hermione’s bland and impersonal.  Ron takes him flying most nights after he gets home from the Ministry, and Harry stops looking up hopefully every time an owl appears.  They’re never from Draco.
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Harry whispered, squeezing his hand and putting a hand on his shoulder.  Draco felt that endless cavern of misery that he’d somehow awoken in Harry’s bedroom stir.  With a frantic shake of his head, he pulled his hand away.  If he allowed himself to feel anything right now, he’d fall apart and never be able to put himself together again.  He needed to complete this like a Malfoy.  For his Mother.  For his Father, the bastard.
Surprisingly, this honesty seemed to disarm Longbottom, his broad face breaking into a wide grin.  “I reckon he’s no better when it comes to you.  Who am I to stand in the way of destiny?”  With that, he retreated from the fire, and called “Harry.  Floo for you.”
“Whatever.  Goodnight, Draco,” Harry said, kissing Draco a little perfunctorily, and then rolling over so that he faced the wall.
Finally, Mill says, “So, we have long suspected that there are certain probation officers who are prejudiced against Slytherin House and specifically, Pureblooded children of Death Eaters, even though there are a whole bunch of people who didn’t really do anything wrong in the war but are still targeted.  Just about every Dark, Pureblooded family has at least a few members who are on probation with flimsy excuses.”  I wrinkle my nose at that, but she continues.
Finally, when his strength was nearly gone, he spun on his heel and ended up at the Apparation point down the street from Harry.  The little house, still under Fidelius, appeared in front of him.  Climbing the steps, Draco felt the wards accept him, a tingling, comforting wash of magic.  Entering the house, he found it dark and quiet.  Draco stole up the stairs, feeling the bannister solid and warm below his hands.  Entering Harry’s room, Draco inhaled Harry’s distinctive scent.  Draco pulled off his clothing, and climbed into bed.  Harry exhaled sleepily, turning over to wrap a leg firmly around Draco’s, and nuzzling his nose into Draco’s neck.
“Master Harry has returned,” the thing says.  Its voice is deep and gravelly.  I assume that it’s a male, but what do I know?
“Harry, we do need to talk about this at some point, but I don’t think this is the time.  We’re both exhausted and upset, and that’s no way to clear the air.”
“No, worse.  I was ashamed.  We’d been wrong, you see.  All of the things I thought were true, they just…weren’t.  I had to rethink everything I’d always believed.  And after I did that, I realized that Harry had been a kid too, and he’d managed to make choices that were right, not easy.  And that was…galling.  He’d been my most cherished enemy.  I had hated him more than I hated Voldemort, because he was human, and vital, and captivating.  I hated him as much as I was fascinated by him.”
“Yeah.  He has a baby, but he doesn’t have a wife.  It was a surrogate. Sort of.  He wasn’t lying to me.”
“Show off,” Draco accused.  Harry pried open his fingers and, since the bird was a magical construct and had dissipated, seemed disappointed that the bird was no longer there.  “At any rate, there’s not much to tell.  My Mother was eager to arrange a suitable match for me, but at the same time, she’s aware that I’m not interested in women.  This places her rather between a rock and a hard place, as she’s too dignified to mention my predilections, but too uncertain of her place in society to speak to another family, only to have me refuse the match completely.  It means that the two of us are at a stalemate, which means I don’t have to discuss it until she gets too frustrated to be dignified.  It’s win-win, really.”
“I’m not really up to that tonight, Draco.  I am, obviously, a bit thin-skinned at the moment, and I can’t bear to listen to all of the ways that I’ve failed you.”
A sigh.  Rolled eyes.  A hint of the inevitable attitude to come as Cass approached her adolescence.  Then, a sunny smile and a little squeeze around his middle as she disappeared into the kitchen.  “Insufferable monster,” the deep voice said.
Papa sighed.  “I don’t know,” he finally said.  “I wouldn’t have wanted him to take you away completely.  I can’t say how things would have been different, but I think I would have wanted to share you, at least.”
He looks unconvinced, so I kiss him sweetly.  Every time he starts to speak again, I kiss the words away.
It’s a week before Draco opens the shop again.  He’d sent Grace an owl, assured her that she’d be paid full wages, and that he’d let her know when he was ready to reopen.  She sent the owl back with one word scrawled on the back of his letter:
I ignore him, ignore the ache in my stomach at the sound of his voice.  “Harry!  For fuck’s sake, Potter.”  It takes him almost no time to catch up to me, and he grabs me by the shoulder, turns me to face him.
Draco frowned.  “No thanks are necessary, Harry.  She’s our daughter.  I’d do anything for her, to help her succeed.”
Harry, who had frozen at the word ‘punishment’, pushed past her and entered the room.  It was bare, save a mattress on the floor.  The woman screamed at him, “Get out! Malcolm is on restriction, I can’t have you-”
“They’re okay,” Hermione said, a little sadly.  “Molly and Arthur took it awfully hard that Ginny had assaulted Harry like that, and for so many years.  Molly felt that it was her fault, but it was also really hard that her only daughter was taken away from her.  I don’t know if you read about it, it was in the papers of course, but Harry insisted that she not go to Azkaban.  She’s in a secure mental health facility, but it will be years before she’s out.  Ron’s fine.  Says he wants you to meet him for a drink?  Something about you having promised him one?”
He leaned closer, and Harry froze.  Before Harry knew what was happening, Draco’s hand gently caressed the back of his neck, and drew him in closer.  When his lips covered Harry’s, Harry was surprised to hear a little whimper, and was even more surprised when he realized it had come from him.  Draco was still a magnificent kisser.  His lips against Harry’s were soft and firm, and he drew Harry’s lower lip between them and sucked, enough to draw Harry’s breath in a gasp.  Draco’s tongue crept inside Harry’s mouth, and he tasted of fire whiskey and it was lovely, and so familiar, and for a moment, Harry felt like he’d come home.
She suddenly brightens a little.  “Don’t get me wrong.  It was fascinating.  You wouldn’t believe what I’ve learned about magical inheritance and the way that magic manifests in Muggleborns and…” she trails off before she can get carried away.  “Anyway.  It was obvious that your magical outbursts were tied to your emotional state, rather like accidental magic happens in children who haven’t learned control yet.  I found a Muggleborn witch who had an advanced degree in Psychology, and we brought her in to consult.”
Draco cast a quick Tempus, and said, “It looks like it’s time.  Cass, you ready?”  She had her Mind Healer appointment.
“I don’t know what kind of bloke I used to be, but I’d never allow someone to cheat on their spouse with me.”
Whatever had taken Blanket was moving away, and Harry tried to stop crying, but he was afraid, and he couldn't stop.  The voices were louder, but far away.  They sounded mad, and whenever a mad voice came into Safe, bad things happened.  He curled into a ball, and tucked his head in.  This went on for quite some time, and Harry decided he had no choice but to cope with his new circumstances.  He’d lost Blanket, and Darkness, but as long as he had Safe, it would be okay.  He curled tighter into the corner, and let his thoughts drift.  He thought of a little girl, and in his mind, she was beautiful, and her laughter was the best sound he’d ever heard in his life.  He wasn’t sure how he’d managed to dream her up, but he didn’t need to think about why.  Just watch, as the sun played on golden curls.
“No, you did, Hermione, and there’s no point in walking backwards now.  I,” he hissed, “have a sworn duty to advocate on behalf of magical children, and ensure that they get the childhood they deserve.  It’s unfair of you to say that I’d try to remove a child from his home just to score a point or something.”
“No, Dad,” Cass spat, whipping around to face Draco.  “You don’t get to criticize how I’ve been raised.  You don’t even know me!  You don’t know what I need.  You don’t know that my dad is raising me to be a strong woman who doesn’t need to be told what to do.  You don’t know that he is always there, anytime I need support.”
Harry nodded.  “I bet.  Sometimes breathing too quickly can dry it out.  I have a throat sweetie here, if you want to take it.  I’ll have one too.”  Once they were sucking their sweets, Harry smiled.  “You’re doing so well, Scorpius.  I know that it can be really scary when unexpected things happen, and you don’t know me very well yet, and so I’m really glad that you’re giving me a chance.”
“No,” I say.  “Nevermind.  I’ll just go walk it off or something.  Sorry to drag you out like this.”  I feel stupid.  I’ve probably ruined things with Draco, and I’ve alienated my family.  I’m a judgemental arsehole about the person I used to be, but at least he had more people than me.  Hermione said I’m different, but I don’t know how to be old Harry.  I start to walk down the cobblestones, headed vaguely in the direction of the ice cream parlour.
“You’re dumb,” she said, gripping the cuff of his long sleeved henley.  She played with the fabric, rubbing her thumb along the texture, just as she’d done as a baby.
His relief is enormous.  She’s chosen him, chosen his wishes over what others think is best for him.  “Not Andromeda,” he says hastily.  “I need to be there for Teddy.”
“Come sit by me.  Astoria is just putting Scorpius to bed.”  Harry went to sit in the armchair next to Narcissa, wondering if he could just snatch his daughter up and leave.  “Harry, she’s absolutely charming.  Just a lovely girl.”
“Listen, Malfoy, I can’t believe I’m going to tell you this.  You have to swear to keep mum about it, though.”  Ron was alternating between glaring at the baby, and avoiding looking at Draco, much to Draco’s amusement.
“Hi Cass,” he answered.  In another life, they would be hugging, speaking a mile a minute to catch one another up on what had happened since the last time they spoke, but now they were polite.  Draco burned with shame.  He had caused this.  No, he amended.  He hadn’t caused this, but he’d blindly told himself that everything was fine, and Harry had been hurting all along.
“Tell me about it.  What a disappointment, to know that I’m a wizard, but all I can do is light candles and apparate.”
His temper is rising, and I don’t know why it fills me with glee, but I keep my expression neutral.  “For fuck’s sake, Harry, I’m not just your employer.  I’ve considered myself your friend for quite some time now.”
“It’s a nuisance,” Harry said shortly.  “She does it to try to protect me, which is totally inappropriate.  I don’t know what to do about it.”
Giving it up as a bad job, he summoned a house elf.  The one who had guided them to their quarters returned, and looked around the chambers for Cass.  Her disappointment at not seeing her was evident.  “What’s your name?” Harry asked.
Everything was different here.  She found herself wishing that her Dad’s parents were still alive, or that he had a brother or sister.  Someone who knew him as well as she did, someone who was familiar.  She wondered if this is what it had been like for her Dad, growing up.  She knew that he wasn’t on speaking terms with the Aunt and Uncle who raised him, but didn’t know why, only that they weren’t magical, and it had caused distance.  Had her Dad felt like this?  As though he were apart from everyone else?
“How silly of me,” Narcissa said in return, her lips curving into a wider smile.  “May I?”  Draco passed Harry over to her, and, although he uttered a little grunt of complaint, Harry allowed Draco’s Mother to hold him.
Cass took her hospital robes to the attached loo, and soon emerged wearing them.  They had yellow ducks patterned all over them.  “Look Dad,” Cass said.
“It is?” I ask.  “I didn’t know that.”  Draco and I had discussed occlumency early on, during a somewhat tense conversation about how Draco was able to keep his emotions so tightly guarded.
“Your mum asked me to come by,” Harry answered, still feeling panicky and detached from the throb of loss he’d felt, imagining how his life might have been.  “Draco, I’m so sorry.  I…Merlin, I can’t even count all the ways that I’ve fucked things up, but I really outdid myself at the press conference today.  Cass and I will keep a low profile, stay shut up in Hogwarts until the transplant, and then I’ll be out of your hair for good.”
Some time later, Pansy wobbles over to him, and sits beside him.  “Potter,” she says.  “Thanks for, you know, stuff.  You’re not so bad.”
Harry had sat under the tree next to the lake, the place where he, Ron and Hermione had studied, and gossiped and laughed.  He wanted them now, but if he told Hermione, she would insist that he tell Draco.  Maybe she’d insist that he give him the baby outright.  Hermione had always seemed to know what was best, and she wasn’t shy on giving him advice, something he normally appreciated.  But Harry knew that he wanted this baby, and all of his insecurities had screamed at him that Hermione would tell him that he wasn’t capable of being her father.
“Don’t worry, Molly, I washed a load earlier.  There are plenty.”  Molly pats her cheek in gratitude, and they wearily make their way inside.
He feels brave, as he finishes speaking, proud of how clearly he was able to express himself.  (The fact that he has been practicing this speech in various iterations during all of the sleepless nights he’s had since the picnic may have helped.)  But then Luna watches him for a long time, and her pale blue eyes contain emotionless appraisal.  His confidence begins to falter a little, and the self-doubt that he feels any time he tries to ask for something for himself starts to rise.  He can’t keep looking at her.  He can’t stay here.  For a sudden, desperate moment, he wants to take it all back, tell Luna that he’s sorry, that she was right after all.  To beg her to love him in spite of how little he deserves it.  Finally, she says, “Okay.”
“I’ll try.  Did you forget to say something last week?”  Harry tries for a smile, but it falters, and he looks wretched.
“Don’t be silly.  You’re my best mate.  Listen, Harry, now that you’re gay, are we going to have to talk about
Hours later, his back even stiffer and more sore, and his eyes gritty, Draco was nearly certain that he’d figured out the antidote to restore Harry to his adult form.  His eyes flicked to the ceiling.  He knew that Kreacher was likely tired, but he sent a silent prayer to Morgana (and anyone else who might be paying attention) for just fifteen more minutes.  He checked his calculations one last time to be sure the dosage was correct, and gathered the baby rat from its cage.  Taking a deep breath to steady his nerves, he administered four droplets of the antidote to the back of the rat’s neck.  He watched as the rat took a cautious step.  Its eyes met Draco’s as it took another step and its whole body suddenly shuddered.  Its feet started to grow first, the change rippling through the rest of its body as it rapidly grew.  There was a blinding flash of light, which was truly unexpected from a rat, even one conjured via magical means.  Suddenly, the rat squealed, and fell sideways onto the table.  It didn’t move, and Draco hesitantly cast a spell.  As he confirmed that the conjured rat was no longer animated, Draco buried his face in his hands.  He could make Harry big again, but not keep him alive.  He’d need to start over.
“Yes,” she said softly, “you’re in the right place now.”  Malcolm looked up at her, and she gave him one of her lovely smiles.  The boy’s lips quirked, but he looked quickly at his feet before a true smile could blossom.  “Come in,” she invited.  Harry and Malcolm crossed the threshold.
Harry sat very still, and was silent for so long that Pansy thought he wasn’t going to answer.  Finally, his voice so quiet that Pansy had to lean closer, he said, “Pansy, he was The One.”
Harry looked like he had a million follow up questions, so Draco quickly said, "What would you like to do today?  We have a few hours before Hermione comes to give you your potion.”
“You left.  You left and you didn’t tell him that you were pregnant. Potter.”  Pansy’s eyes flashed, and her grip on her wand tightened.
“Harry, we were technically adults, most of us.  And besides, everyone in Slytherin House hated you.  Some of us had been fed so much bullshit by our parents, that you were set up as an enemy long before we started at Hogwarts.  The rest of us were annoyed that Dumbledore turned a blind eye when you blatantly broke the rules.  And then when the Dark Lord returned, there were a lot of students who believed in him, followed him loyally.  If you’d been there, in seventh year, they wouldn’t have hesitated to torture you.”
“Maybe Auntie Hermione would know of a Muggle tutor who could help round out your education,” Papa continued.  “I’ll owl her later.”
“But I don’t have any, not anymore.  I quit my job at the Ministry.  My biggest responsibility now is making sure that the ice cream scoops are cleaned after each serving.”
“It is,” Draco agreed, unable to keep from smiling at Harry’s excited expression.  “I’m about to head over to the Manor to see if Mother needs any help.  Will you be coming with Astoria?”
“I think that you stopped hating me.  I think that you were able to tolerate, or possibly even enjoy being around me.  I think that you cared about me in the way that you care about all of your friends.”
Hermione huffs.  “It hasn’t been kind of shit!”  I raise my eyebrows at her and she smiles tightly.  “Alright, yes, you’ve had more than your share of obstacles, but it’s what’s made you who you are.”  She bites her lip, and I swear I can see tears swim in her eyes before she says, “And who made you think that you weren’t smart?”
Whatever self-preservation instincts he’d honed as a child, Harry was grateful for them now as he managed to force his body to stand, and move through Draco’s home.  He found himself in his bedroom.
“I’ve been covering for him for a while now.  He’s my best mate, and Ginny’s boyfriend, and…he just doesn’t need this being dragged through the tabloids like everything else.  He deserves some privacy.”
“Cass, the situation was unbearably complicated.  For a whole number of reasons, I made the decision not to tell him.  And then we moved to Canada, and I stopped talking to anyone other than Auntie Min.”
“Harry.”  Hermione says.  I still can’t look at her, but the way she says my name is terrible.  As though she’s ruined my life.  Which, maybe she has, but I’ll be damned if we’re going to have any
Just wanted to say thanks so much for reading this fic.  I feel so fond of this Draco, and it was just the tiniest bit of catharsis, having lost my mum last year.  I appreciate those who kudo'd and if you liked it at all, I sure would love a comment.
Draco sniffs, and disappears into the back to start some sketches for the amulet Potter wants.  It’s a point of professional pride to ensure that it’s his best work.  He finds himself in the shop, hours past closing, trying to cram as much of the fiddly magic into the tiny pendant.  He tells himself that it’s because Teddy is family, and because it wouldn’t
Harry laughed.  “Yeah, just a bit.  Anyways, there was a big fallout.  The Prophet was speculating that I was going to be the next Voldemort, and the DMLE were going to arrest me, at one point.  And then my personal life fell apart a bit, and I kind of had a breakdown, I guess.”
“I’m ashamed of myself,” Harry said.  “When I found out that I was pregnant, and realized how rare it was, I couldn’t imagine how people were going to react.  Everyone already paid too much attention to me, with the war, and then when everyone found out I was gay, and then…I think I just hit my limit.  I couldn’t handle anyone knowing that again, I was different.  And I couldn’t risk…”
As it turns out, Harry was just trying to wind Draco up, and he has no opinion on what the baby should wear, so the three of them make it to Hogwarts nearly on time.  Hermione, when they arrive, has a list several inches long that she’s frantically going over, and she’s doing a terrible job at hiding her annoyance at their lateness.   Harry, to his credit, kisses her cheek, reminds her that Scorpius isn’t going to remember whether they started on time, and firmly shoves Ron at her when she continues to witter on.
“Not yet,” he replied, his voice tight.  Tamsin was casting murderous glares at Linden, and Harry edged past the odious man.
“I have to notify his parent,” Harry said.  “Can you possibly wait to rennervate him until his Father gets here?  I think he’ll be less scared.”
The next day, Narcissa arrived to stay with Harry while Draco went to see Lara.  “Harry, do you remember my mum?”
“Nooo,” he says slowly.  “It was weird.  It’s not a curse, though.  I can feel the foreign magic that’s locking up the memories.  It’s like someone has created a vault, and shoved a whole bunch of stuff inside.  I can say for sure that you didn’t do it to yourself, and the magic isn’t malevolent.  It feels like healing magic, almost.”
Later that night, though, after Cass had showered, and tucked herself in, Harry paused in her doorway.  The hall light bled through the darkness, highlighting the gold of her hair.  He admired the delicate bridge of her nose, the sharp jut of her chin.  Her lips were slightly parted, and she’d kicked her covers off.  As he smoothed them over her thin shoulder, and placed a gentle kiss on her forehead, the familiar love and guilt and motherfucking
Draco stroked the dog’s big, stupid, soft head, and then he said, “Harry, you are the kindest person I have ever met.  We can share the dog, okay?”  Draco wasn’t really talking about the dog, and he hoped that Harry understood that, but he didn’t know how to make it clear.
“I’m nearly positive,” Draco agreed.  “I’ve created a tincture of the four ingredients, and we just need to perfect the ratios, then I can create an antidote.”
“Alright,” Hermione said presently, changing the subject gracefully, “there must be a few ingredients that are common to all love potions, right?”
We’re interrupted from further exploration of this topic by tapping at my window.  For a moment, my heart leaps hopefully.  The owl isn’t the same black one that had delivered Draco’s previous missives, but maybe it’s one from the bank?  I eagerly open the window, and the bird holds its leg out imperiously.  I untie it, and open it up, and my heart sinks back to its usual position as I realize that the writing isn’t Draco’s.
“Yeah,” Harry said, his expression fond.  “That’s brilliant.  I assume that they’re willing to work with her via owl?”
It’s a seaside, and a slightly older Harry is kneeling beside the prone figure of a house elf.  As the burial proceeds, I watch his face keenly.  His expression is hard, but within his eyes lies a galaxy of anguish.  It is as though, if he were to allow any of his feelings to emerge, that they would dissolve him completely.  He draws his wand, and inscribes an epitaph on the gravestone.
“I said that if he let me take him on three dates, and he still hated me at the end of it, I’d accept defeat and leave him in peace.”
“Oh.  Right, yeah.”  Harry watched Draco warily.  He wasn’t sure where the conversation was going, which was usually a sign that it was headed in an unpleasant direction
“Honestly, Mother,” Draco continued, in a much more soothing, but still quite angry tone, “as usual, you’ve come to the completely wrong conclusion.  Thank you, for your faith in me.  Harry is a baby, because he managed to expose himself to a number of potions ingredients which caused this reaction.  I was merely a bystander at the time.  He is here because I’m working to cure him, under the direct supervision of his two best friends.”  Narcissa looked relieved, and chastened.  “However, I particularly want to thank you for your oh-so-supportive analysis of my…what did you call them?  Issues?  It’s wonderful to know that, despite everything I’ve done to try to restore our family’s reputation, all of the work I’ve done to regain balance after my train wreck of a childhood, that to my Mother, I’m still just another morally lacking Death Eater.”
Draco sequesters Hermione for a detailed review of her research, and the planned procedure for restoring my memories.  I know I’d be welcome to listen, but to be honest, I’d likely understand less than half of it, and I trust Draco to stop her if she’s doing something ill-advised.
Draco jumps, knocks his vial of ink over, and curses as he waves his wand to spell it back into the bottle.  “Harry.”  His eyes are wide, and an open, childlike expression crosses his face.  “You came.”
“Mmm.” Harry’s declaration is barely acknowledged as his bedmate snuggles in, places freezing cold feet against Harry’s calves, causing him to laugh and wriggle.  Harry nibbles an ear, runs a loving hand over a nipple.  The body beneath his hand stiffens.
“Harry, what’s wrong?  Are you sick?  Is it too cold?  Do you want to go inside?”  Draco was concerned.  The wards on the Manor were really very good, but it wasn’t unheard of that some remnant Death Eater had somehow snuck in and confunded Harry while Draco hadn’t been paying attention.
“No, that’s not necessary.  I can sleep on the floor in Cass’ room or something.  I can’t take Astoria’s room.”
using the baby blanket in the ritual to find Scorpius, even if symbolically.  Draco wears a simple linen set of robes, and he’s so pale, standing there, his hands nervously twisting.  Hermione sets the bowls of herbs atop some of the runes, and Pansy hands her a silver dagger. I note, managing not to roll my eyes, that the hilt is intricately carved in the shape of a snake.  Walking stereotypes indeed.
At the international floo, he entertained a fantasy of Harry running in before he left, making a desperate declaration, and begging Draco to stay.  It didn’t happen, and by nightfall, he was in a hotel on King Street, watching the traffic zoom by.
“What?  What kind of a question is that?”  Harry glared at the reporter.  He was young, barely out of Hogwarts by the look of him, and Harry felt uneasy about the way that he was smiling at Draco.
“Yes.  But this could be my chance to see what it would be like to…to…have him look at me like I wasn’t worthless.”
“You are?” Draco felt astonished and disappointed all in one go.  He hadn’t ever expected to have a chance with Harry, not since he had realized that his distain for Harry-bloody-Potter was a thinly-veiled front for a very different set of feelings.  Still, it was unpleasant to have the rug pulled out from under him, and he felt his face pull down into the blank expression that had kept him safe for most of his life.  “How nice for you.”
“Yes, both parents need to have the same genetic anomaly for this condition to exist.  If either of you had a child with another parent, the risks are much lower, if that’s something that you wish to consider.  But because the baby would only be a half-sibling, there’s no certainty that they’d be a match.  The hematopoietic growth factors will allow us to manage Scorpius’ condition for some time, but it’s difficult to estimate how long.  There’s no guarantee.”
“I felt like my tummy had a dragon inside it,” Scorpius said.  “It was hot and mad, and growling.  I tried to make the dragon be quiet, but it was so mad that it got away on me.  It grew and grew and then it ‘sploded out of my fingers and toes.”  He looked through his lashes at his father.  “I don’t know what happened after that.”
to produce anything less for the most influential man in Wizarding London.  And, in the early hours of the morning, when the delicate work of stacking the charms collapses upon itself, putting paid to the hours of work he’s already invested, he doesn’t have a fit.  He doesn’t throw the stupid pendant into a corner of the shop and stomp to his flat.  He sighs, pushes a long tendril of hair out of his eyes, and starts again.
“I expect so.  Hopefully he doesn’t question her lineage too much.  He liked the fact that she had a star name.”
He pulled out his wand, and spelled them both still before grabbing a recording orb from his pocket.  “Investigator Harry James Potter,” he said clearly after charming the recorder to begin.  “Called to investigate accidental magic at 2 Squire’s Mount, Hampstead.  Subject identified as Malcolm Sanders.  On scene is also two adults, assumed to be Malcolm’s parents.  Evidence of a recently extinguished unplanned fire, as well as evidence of mistreatment of the subject.  As abuse is suspected, Investigator Potter, utilizing Statute 4.7.3 of the Magical Child Protection Act is prepared to perform legilimency on Mr. and Mrs. Sanders.”
“This time last year, I would have told you that I was happy, content.  That I’d gotten the life I deserved after dying to defeat him.  And now, I can’t say the same thing, not with any certainty.  It’s terrifying.”
“Perish the thought,” Harry said, his lip quirking.  His expression became a bit more solemn.  “What’s your number, Cass?”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, and was a little surprised to find that he meant it.  He was sorry for Hermione, who would now have to cause unimaginable strife amongst her family.  He was sorry for Ron, who would have to reconcile the space between his little sister’s duplicity and his longtime best friend.  He was even sorry for Ginevra, who, although her actions were reprehensible, was so desperate to make Harry love her that she did the unthinkable.  Draco knew only too well what it felt like to be faced with unsurmountable challenges from all angles.  Most surprisingly, though, he was heartrendingly sorry for Harry, who, when he was finally adult enough to understand it, would have to cope with the betrayal of someone who he trusted, a member of his chosen family.  “I’ll do everything I can to help you,” he said quietly, and Hermione’s deep brown eyes filled with tears.
“Replace it.  Replace anything I damaged.  Release a statement that condemns the reporter’s inflammatory comments, but apologizes for my behaviour.  Will I have to serve jail time?”
But there he was, his wild hair surrounding that beloved face, a tiny hopeful smile on his lips.  Draco hadn’t bothered to dry his hair and a line of cold water dripped off the ends and down his back.  He shivered a little and simply stood there.  This was Harry’s mission, and Draco could only stand stupidly, waiting to see what happened next.
I keep my stroke on his cock steady, my other hand surrounds his balls, pulling a little, in a way that I know I like.  He groans, and his breath comes faster.   He pulls away from my kiss, long enough to say, “Get on your hands and knees, Harry.”
Cass tugged a lock of her wild curls and sighed.  “Genetics.  Honestly, Dad, all the things I could get from you, and I ended up with your hair?”
“No,” Harry suddenly remembered.  The Custody papers.  Fleeing back to Canada.  The days of crying, and spending hours mustering up the ability to peck out a short email to Cass.  The failure.  “She’s Draco’s now.”
So...that's it for this one.  I want to thank everyone who kudo'ed and commented.  Your feedback is such a tremendous gift that truly, truly brings me incredible joy.  I especially want to thank those who commented on my interpretation of Draco's life with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  It's always a big risk to write about something so personal when you don't have the lived experience, and I couldn't be more grateful to those who helped.
Draco tapped the parcel with his wand, and unwrapped the parchment.  It was a huge volume.  “What is this?”
I concede defeat, and settle onto the couch with a thick photo album.  There’s a couple who could only be my parents.  I can’t remember their names, and it bothers me more than anything else has so far.  I can ask Hermione, of course.  I’m sure she’d know, but
“I miss my stars,” she said.  Harry had spent weeks figuring out the charm that made the ceiling of the Hogwarts Great Hall look like the sky.  The day he’d managed to recreate it on Cass’ ceiling, her smile had been like the sun, and Harry treasured the memory of it.
“They hate me.  They hate me so much.” His little shoulders sagged as he confessed, and his eyes lost their sparkle for a moment.
“Hi everyone,” Harry said, once the noise level had diminished a little.  “I’m happy to see you all again.  Today we’re covering the last bit of self defence, and then next time we see each other, we’ll begin doing some basic first aid.  You’ve all done brilliantly so far, and today will be about showing me everything you’ve learned.”
It’s past two when Harry’s bedroom door flings open.  Harry’s on his feet, wand in hand before his eyes are focused.  As he realizes who it is, his wand arm drops to his side.
“Of course,” she says.  Mill waves at me, and gives me another one of those amazing smiles as she departs.  “Have a seat, dear.”  I perch on the uncomfortable desk chair outside the office, and smile my thanks.  “How are you feeling?”
fucks off, and I smile at Draco, watching him and waiting for him to speak.  He doesn’t.  He instead regards me with such confusion that the smile eventually fades from my face.  “You’re looking at me strangely,” I finally say.
“Well, you were a right cow to me every other time you got a chance.  I was a lot more annoyed by that.  Either way though, it’s all in the past, and I’ve no hard feelings.  Before we continue though, I suppose I need to address something.  In school, you were one of Draco Malfoy’s closest friends.  Are you still close?”
Harry had been proud that, for all of the unexpected challenges his life had presented, that he’d never bowed down, never been beaten by his losses.  That he’d squared his shoulders and stood up, over and over.  He wondered if this time, he’d be able to pick himself back up.  He wondered if he’d care to even try.  He had started to shiver, and even the kids under the bleachers had left, so he rose and began to trudge home.
I take a breath, and then another, and feel myself relax marginally, and say, “Yeah, okay.”  He gradually pushes inside me, inch by patient inch, until I feel his legs against my thighs, and his balls against my arse.  “Draco,” I sigh.  “More.”  He fucks me, gently at first, and then, as he becomes sure that my moans are of pleasure and not pain, harder, faster.  His arm snakes around to encircle my cock, and I’m incapable of speech, offering only a litany of moans and sighs.
Ron gave him a sudden wide smile.  “Thanks, Malfoy, you’re alright.  I’ll take you up on that when things are less mental.  Anyhow, about Ginny…I’ve spoken to Kingsley about the whole situation.  We go back a bit, and he’s a good friend of Harry’s, so I figure we can trust him.  Plus, he was an Auror for years, so he knows how it goes.  Kings said that without some more proof, we don’t have any chance of getting Ginny taken into custody.  I’ve got two ideas, and they’re both absolutely mad.  I was wondering if you could give me your opinion.”
Miriam was waiting for them in a treatment room.  She smiled at them both and beckoned them to sit.  They perched uneasily on the couch next to one another, a wide gap between them.  Harry looked as though he was about to pass out.  Draco looked at Miriam in alarm.  Was it too soon?  Were they rushing Harry?  Draco was surprised, however, when Harry took a deep breath, and then another, and said, “Miriam, I’d like to have Hank come to the session.”
Lucius nodded and bowed low, before spying Scorpius and Cass, and headed in their direction quickly, saying, “Draco!  Bring your friend and we’ll go visit the peacocks!”
“No, no,” Harry said, waving his hands a little.  “It’s Cass who will deserve your gratitude.  She’s the one who’s going through the procedure.  If the situation were in reverse, I just know that I’d be frantic, and I wanted to make sure that I got that out of the way before…”
They returned at 10:50 promptly, Scorpius carefully carrying a brown paper bag, while Draco followed with a cup of tea.  “Mrs. Nott,” Scorpius said excitedly.  “I brought you a present!  And I ate six bites!”
Harry eyed the sink warily.  He had no idea how to unpick House Elf magic, and he could only imagine how Mrs. Number Ten would react when waste water and food particles ended up in her sitting room, or wherever Kreacher had set the drain to banish.  Grateful yet again for the Fidelius charm, Harry resolved to bring the matter up with Kreacher on another day.
“Does it?”  I have no understanding of what she’s saying, but I’ve learned that with Luna, sometimes, just letting her ramble is as effective as trying to follow.
“That’s great, Kreacher, thanks,” I say, and his wrinkly, odd face beams back at me.  “I think I’ll just go have a shower, then.”
“Well, yes, I suppose.  But he was the one who gave information to the Prophet in fourth year, and that
“Of course you didn’t, you just learned magic existed five minutes ago.  Come on,” Draco wanted to extend his hand, but his arm wouldn’t obey his mind’s orders.  With the mental shrug of someone who was quite used to uncooperative appendages, Draco said “Come, Harry.”
The figure in the bed had been…terrible.  It had barely looked like Harry.  His face was grey, and slack, and there were deep rivets on his cheeks and arms that suggested he’d been clawing at himself at some point.  Draco could smell the strong odour of Essence of Dittany.  He’d certainly lost an alarming amount of weight, and with his slim stature, he looked skeletal.  Whatever had happened since he’d come home, it was obvious that Harry had been in agony, all alone.  Cass had climbed into bed with him, wrapping her arms around him, and whispering in his ear.  She’d stroked whatever part of his face wasn’t coated in healing salve, and smoothed his tangled hair back.  It had broken Draco’s heart, and he’d been so awash in guilt and shame, that he started when Greg’s strong arm wrapped around him.  “Steady on, Draco,” he’d whispered.  “That little girl needs you right now.  I know that you’re probably feeling a lot of different things, but you can break down later.  The best way you can help Harry is to take care of Cass.”
Draco’s mind registered the 'him' with a detached little pang.  So it was true.  Harry was gay, and no longer with Ginny, and in love with someone else.  He tried to tell himself to be happy for him.  If anyone deserved to find someone to love him, it was Harry, and he had known that his feelings were unrealistic.
Harry knew that if he didn't intervene, there'd be bloodshed, and Nettle, the slippery fucker, always seemed to find a way to make things look like their fault.  “Tamsin,” he said warningly.  “Come on, I want to talk.”
“Don’t bother your parents.  I’ll stay with the kids.”  It wasn’t exactly how Harry had planned to spend his evening, but he felt like this was important.
Astoria stood suddenly, and moved quickly over to where Cass was sitting.  She hugged her firmly, and whispered something into her ear.  Cass smiled and patted her hand.
“I’ll stop you there, to remind you that atonement is not a goal that we identified for you.  I’ll remind you as well that we agreed that forgiveness for your past choices is irrelevant.  Society will accept you as you are, or it won’t, but the most important thing right now is to continue to put your own needs at the forefront of your actions.”
Cass ran into the room, her expression pinched and, if Draco were a betting man, he’d say close to tears.  “I’m ready, Dad.  Are you sure we have to go?”
“I don’t know if Hermione and I are going to make it,” he blurted out, and then looked panicked, as though saying the words had made it a reality.
And I’m surprised at how nice it is.  Ron’s gotten over being upset about Ginny, and about Malfoy, and he doesn’t even say ‘I told you so’.  He seems steadfastly in my corner, and, when it’s him and I on our own, I understand why he’s my best friend.  As we say goodbye, Ron wraps a big, bearlike arm around me.  “Don’t worry about Malfoy,” he says.  “If he’s too stupid to see what a top bloke you are, it’s his loss.”
“He is,” Snape replies.  Harry nods, planning.  He’ll need to speak to Minerva, arrange for time off.  He’s just considering whether to Apparate or Floo when Snape speaks again.  “I take it that you’re not allowing your current disagreements with your friends to prevent you from contacting Draco?”
The sound of the floo chiming wakes me the next morning.  I can tell it’s early; the sun isn’t even up.  “Potter!”
“It’s understandable,” Draco said.  “Harry, I know how fucked up your childhood was.  Of course you wanted a family to love you.  I get it, but if you’re really being honest, you also wanted Cass to be all yours.”
“I did, Miss Cici!” Scorpius brandishing the dragon.  After it had been thoroughly admired,  she eyed him appraisingly.
“You bitch.”  The man’s face is puce, and he looks as though he’s about to murder us all.  “You have no idea what you’re doing.  You’re dooming our society!”
“My family was once very influential, and my Father…he had some strange ideas about what it meant to be a proper Wizard.  For a number of reasons, your Dad was the sort of person he didn’t approve of.  If he’d not gone a bit silly, he likely would have wanted to take you away from your Dad’s influence.”
“Oh,” Draco thought about it for a moment, and then decided to risk it.  “I’d do anything for you as well.”
“That bitch,” Draco said lowly, and Ron looked for a moment like he might take offence, but he shrugged instead.
“It has nothing to do with Draco Malfoy, sir.  If you consider it a while, I’m sure you’ll see that.”  I turn and leave the office, smiling at Agnes as I walk by her desk.
Harry looked at him with understanding, and that shy little smile from before crossed his features again.  “And you still came to get me.”
Hermione, who was deeply entrenched in some writing something for presentation at the Wizengamot, emerged from her study to get a cup of tea.  She produced some biscuits of dubious origin, and they spent an enjoyable half hour exchanging the latest gossip about their Ministry Co-Workers.  “…and that awful Romilda Vane, you remember her, right, Harry?”
“I’ll give you a minute,” Draco said, and fled upstairs to find Ron absentmindedly shooting brightly coloured fireworks from his wand.  Harry was bouncing excitedly on his feet, arms extended towards the sparks.  As Draco and Ron looked on, he took a shaky step in the direction of Ron’s wand.  “He’s never done that before,” Draco said, a grin splitting his face.
Hermione’s there, with a hastily packed bag, and Harry’s Gringott’s key and a pair of shoes for Draco.  “I’ve made you a Portkey, it will take you to the Order safe house in Scotland.”
“Sweetheart, I wouldn’t have said anything if you hadn’t asked me a very personal question about my thoughts.  We’ve talked about this before.  Your abilities give you an unfair advantage over other people.  It’s very rude to share something you’ve learned at the breakfast table.”
“Can we go see the Chamber of Secrets first thing?  No, wait, I want to see Uncle Professor’s classroom.  And the Library.  And the Room of Requirement.”
The snake seems depressed, and its sarky attitude devolves over the day, to the point where it no longer answers Harry.
“Absolutely.  They control the pain medication, they can bring the best snacks, and if they hate you, they have a number of ways to make things difficult.  Like adhering to visiting hours, for example.”
“Well, not at first.  At first, it was the strangest feeling.  Like the wand knew me.  Like it was an old friend, saying hello.  Then I nearly knocked your house down, and I got scared.”
“How did they manage to keep that a secret?” Hermione asks.  “You’d think they’d want the public to know that they were taking definitive action against those who were Dark-aligned.”
“Perhaps you could go fetch Aunt Andromeda?  I haven’t told her yet.  She knows that Mother’s been sick, but I haven’t told anyone.  I assume that Snape let you know?”
“Yeah, that’s what I thought,” Ron muttered.  He cast a quick spell, and said, “Gin’s magical signature is here as well.  I don’t see anything to help us find Harry, but at least we have more evidence to support our theory.”
“But here we are, four years later, and I’m still a mess, and you’re…well, you seem to be doing just fine, actually, which kind of hurts a bit, but I had to take my shot, Draco.  I know you have this life here, but I need my shot.”
“When I was a kid, I always assumed that there’d be a point where I’d just…grow up, you know?  And I’d stop fucking up everything I touched.  I’m pretty sure there’s no hope for me.”
Draco’s face twisted.  “I don’t need your help,” he snapped.  “Why are you even giving me any?  It’s not like you wanted me to get to know her before this.”
“Yes, indeed.  My Apprentice Master in France, unfortunately, died suddenly, and Garrick was kind enough to allow me to complete my studies with him.  I worked here in the shop until he also passed on, and then I took it on.”
“That’s the extent of it, but it was much more complicated at the time.  My family is an old, Pureblooded family.  We have been wealthy, and entitled, and powerful, for generations.  The Manor you saw today has been in my family for centuries.  People who have power will go to great lengths to preserve that power, and so my Grand-Père, and my Papa were both very interested in how a man named Tom Riddle believed that he could preserve that way of life.”
fault!”  Harry raised his eyebrows, but looked hurt.  “Okay, fine, Potter,” Harry’s shoulders slumped at the use of his last name.  “Harry.  This might seem a little hard to imagine, but there was a potions incident-”
“It’s not really a nice story, and you’ll remember it after this afternoon.  Are you sure you want me to tell you?”  Draco warned, desperately regretting diving into this cauldron of fish.
Draco groans.  Harry slides down his body and takes Draco into his mouth.  When he’s sucked him to near-climax, he parts Draco’s legs, finds the rosebud pucker and encircles it with his tongue.  Draco’s whimpers are delicious.  “Harry” he begs.  Harry’s tongue is determined, plunging inside Draco’s channel, his mouth hot.  His tongue teases, so close to Draco’s prostate, but not touching.  Draco writhes.  “Fuck me, Harry.”
“Mother” Draco sighed, looking into her beautiful blue eyes.  She had always been a comforting presence, soothing like a cool sip of water.  Narcissa had always understood Draco, even if she often still forced him to do things he didn’t want.  When he’d been forced to take the Mark, she’d held him as he sobbed, shed tears of her own.  He didn’t want to let her down, didn’t want to let the family down.  But he also didn’t want to marry Astoria Greengrass.  “Was it all worth nothing?”
“I’ll be going,” Draco said, but Harry didn’t even look his way.  Narcissa waved her fingertips at him, but continued smiling down at Harry.
“It isn’t pity,” he said.  “It’s help.  Scorpius is going to be so disappointed if he doesn’t have a birthday party, and that won’t help with his control of his magic.  I have a pile of little kids that I know, who would love to make a new friend, and go to a party.  Why wouldn’t we let them have fun together?”
“What, Harry?”  Draco knelt down next to the boy, and suddenly, there was a number of crashing noises, as every glass in the cupboards shattered.
“Er…yes,” I reply.  If he’s calling me Master, he’s clearly not about to kill me, but you’d think that Hermione would have let me know that I had some sort of slave.
“I know that England is no longer your home, and I haven’t any right to ask you to stay.  I’m just not ready to say goodbye yet.”
“Thanks, and please call me Harry.”  He followed a bouncy Violet and a sedate, but genial Mr. Powers into the kitchen, and gratefully accepted a cup of coffee.  He smiled delightedly at the cup as it was presented to him.
When Harry returned to his quarters, Greg and Cass were playing exploding snap, and a letter on crisp stationary awaited Harry.  He couldn’t immediately place the handwriting, but it was free of any poisons or curses, so, heaving a sigh, he cracked open the seal.
“Well, I can understand that,” Draco said gloomily.  “I’ve struggled with the same thing since the first day I met him.”
“Maybe,” Draco said.  “He’s convinced that we were best friends at Hogwarts.  I didn’t have the heart to tell him the truth.”
Harry’s smile was a little ragged around the edges.  “I had something, but it isn’t going to work out.”
At breakfast, Cass was surprised when Papa said, “I’d like to introduce you to Scorpius’ tutor today.  If you’re going to be here for some time, we can’t ignore your education, and I wanted you to have some choices.  If you’d rather go to a local school, we can arrange that, although it might be harder to adjust to a different educational program.  Homeschooling is quite common amongst wizarding families, so I thought you could see if you liked Bertram, and we could discuss.”
“I don’t know.  Life my life, I suppose.  A real one, if I can manage it, one that’s not hidden away behind wards.”
“I need you to fuck me, Harry,” Draco breathed, and Harry murmured appreciatively around his cock, and tried to flip Draco onto his stomach. “No,” Draco knew his voice sounded choked.  “I want to see you.”
“I’m sure that you think you did,” Draco says patiently, “but we have a very strict policy about attraction charms, and so we just wouldn’t have sold it to you.”
The weather had finally turned temperate again, when Minerva arrived the following week.  Harry was working in his shop, sleeves rolled up, The Beatles playing on the record player he’d charmed to work around all the magic.  As always when he was working, time had slipped away from him, and he looked up in surprise when he heard Cass shouting from the back door of the house, “Dad! She’s here!”
A few days later, Draco recognized the Weasley’s tiny, strange owl again, and there was another note from Harry.
Harry placed his fork gently down in his plate, dabbed at the corner of his mouth with his napkin, and said, “Cass, get your things, please.”
“No?” Draco raised an eyebrow.  “So you think that you can kiss me goodnight and then fall asleep silently?”
?” Draco finally demands when Blaise stands for ages, looking at him as though he’s something disgusting.
She sighs.  “I agreed to join the Unspeakables three days after the Battle of Hogwarts.  I was sitting with you in the hospital wing, and you were asleep, dreaming.  Your magic lashed out, and took out a wall of the castle.  I knew right then, that the Department of Mysteries would be interested in the sort of power that could defeat a Dark Lord.  I knew that the only way to keep you safe would be to ensure that I was the one doing that research.”
“Right, okay, so Draco and Astoria went on to have a little boy, who they named Scorpius.  He’s four now.  But unfortunately, Scorpius is very sick.  He has a problem with his blood, and if they can’t fix it, he might not survive.”
“Okay, we’re taking you back to Grimmauld, then.  It’s not Tuesday, but if there was ever a reason for Liquor Potluck, it’s this.”
The house elf popped into existence at Draco’s bedside.  “Good morning, Master Malfoy.  Good morning, Small Master Harry Potter.  Would Master Malfoy be wanting tea?”
Unexpectedly, Draco felt the waves of fear receding some.  He looked closely at Harry.  “You’re fine,” he said, his voice shaking.
He’s not my type, too big and burly, but I appreciate the sentiment, and this is the second time he’s let me in without paying, so I widen my eyes at him and grin.  His hand lingers on my back as he opens the door for me, and I am immediately glad that I decided to come.
“Holy fuck, Potter, are you for real?”  I’m not sure how to answer that, but his using my name suggests that we do know each other, so at least I’m right about that.  I’m saved from bluffing my way through an answer, because suddenly someone’s grabbing my shoulder and pulling me away.
“Nope, not a bit.  Draco is complicated, and so he needed a wand that was equally so.  We tried so many, and then finally, he found the right one.  Willow, unicorn hair core, quite swishy.  Cass, when he picked up that wand.  Well, you’ll find out soon enough, when your wand finds you, but it’s a really special feeling.  Like you suddenly belong.  Like you have all this stored up energy that’s finally found its conduit.  Just this…click.  It’s amazing.  And he looked at me like I’d just made all of his dreams come true.”  Harry smiled, remembering.  “That was it.  I was smitten.  Seeing that look on his face was just like that click of feeling your magic.”
“Harry, dear, if I had a galleon for every time Draco left the breakfast table in a temper,” Narcissa said with a laugh.  “And every time, he was just waiting for someone to come after him and tell him that it was alright.  She’s reaching a difficult age, and her emotions are likely to surface more frequently.  She’s upstairs, by herself, struggling with, if my guess is correct, anger, and guilt, and embarrassment at being caught out.  She needs her dad.”
“Yes, it would,” Harry said, his voice taking on a steely tone.  “I’m good at my job, Hermione, and, despite the fact that my suspicions back then were
Harry was at the stove before she’d had a chance to remove her scarf and coat, but Cass was there waiting, and took them to hang up.  When she left the room, Minerva said, “She’s lovely, Harry.”
“You already are,” she whispered.  “Help me get Harry back, and I’ll never be able to repay you.”  The tears spilled over her lashes, and she choked back a sob.
“Okay, thank you for telling me that.  I’m sorry to be so blunt, Draco, I know that this is none of my business, but I want to help.”
Cass shrugged.  “I’m sad for you both.  I wish that things had been different, but if they were, you wouldn’t have Scorpius and Astoria.”
Draco opens his mouth to speak, but Harry raises a hand, his expression determined.  He continues, “It made me realize that what I’ve been doing is all wrong.  I have to figure out whether I can build a life for myself or not.  I can’t keep trying to define myself in relation to other people.”
With a gusty sigh, Draco sat on the floor next to the couch.  He waved his wand and whispered, “Accio Harry’s blanket,” and before long a faded quilt came zooming down the stairs. Resolving himself to a very long, very confusing night, Draco tucked the quilt around Harry’s thin shoulders and settled himself on the floor beside the only person that he’d ever loved.
“Well, if you don’t want me to find some reason to slap a probationary order on Malfoy, you’d better call off your dog.”
“Alright.  Do you want tea?”  I’m at a loss, in many ways.  I know very little of this woman, other than that she tried to hand me over to Voldemort, and that she is being forced into choices nobody should have to make.  She isn’t very friendly though, so I expect that she doesn’t like me all that much.  Which begs the question I ask next.  “Why are you here?”
“Do we?”  I stand, and carry the dishes to the sink, before running the water and grabbing a sponge.  “I apologized for waking you both.  I had no idea that you’d placed a monitoring charm on me.  If I had, I would have discouraged it, as I’m not a toddler who wanders off after a butterfly.”
“Mmhmm,” she said, from the depths of the heavy wool.  “Auntie Min isn’t just here for a visit.  She’s bringing change.”
“Not naughty,” Harry corrected.  “Your magic is working to protect you, and that’s a good thing.  Little witches and wizards are very fortunate to have protection built-in like that.  It’s not your magic’s fault that you’re still learning the difference between things that make you feel upset, and things that are threatening to actually hurt you.”
Draco’s mouth went dry.  She knew.  Somehow she knew.  He looked wildly toward the stairs, considering just fleeing from this.
“Of course it’s understandable, Mister Potter.”  Harry felt a tug on his sleeve, and faintly registered the fact that he’d stood up.  “There’s no denying your integrity and moral fibre.  Is it true that you didn’t want your daughter to be raised by a Death Eater?”
When the secretary left, the little boy regarded Harry solemnly.  Harry motioned to a chair beside him, and the boy scrambled onto it.  Harry took a moment to observe him.  Scorpius’ breaths came fast and harsh.  He was clearly terrified.  “Hi Scorpius,” Harry said softly.  “My name is Harry, and I’m here to help you.”
will do much to scare this person away.  It’s Smith, the guy that creeped me out the last time I was here.  “Potter,” he purrs.  “You’ve been a bad boy.”
I gift him with a tiny curve of my lips.  There’s more that he has to say, and he won’t get a reaction before I understand exactly where he’s leading.  I see a tiny flicker of resignation in his eyes as he mourns my placidity, and he continues, “That’s why I was awfully surprised to see the article in the Prophet this morning.”
“Oh,” Cass said.  “Yeah, sure.  I sort of forgot about school, but yeah, I don’t want to fall behind.  It’s been strange, it feels like holidays.”  Something occurred to her.  “Papa, do you have a job?  I’ve just realized that Astoria goes out to work, but you’re home almost always.”
“I know that the ratios in the potion are right. And he’s so withdrawn.  I mean, look at him, Draco.  When was the last time you saw a three-year-old sitting so quietly?”
“I dunno why she ended up at Ron and Hermione’s…Merlin was it only yesterday?  Feels like longer.  She was furious when she found me there.  Screamed at Ron and Hermione, made Rose cry.”
“Well, you might be a Malfoy, son, but you’re also human.  I’d be shocked if you weren’t feeling something, under all that decorum.  We’ll do everything that we can to make sure that your Mother is comfortable and peaceful.  I’m very sorry, Mr Malfoy.”
“Harry,” he finally meets my eyes, and his expression is unreadable.  Is he angry?  Disappointed?  I can’t place the implacable features, the hint of a sneer on his lips.
I’m nearly there, so close, and by the sounds of his breath, so is he.  His movements increase in speed, until, abruptly, the room is filled with a completely unexpected sound.  There’s a baby crying.  In this room.  We both still.  It’s dark, so I can’t see his face, but he doesn’t seem surprised to hear a surprise infant, but rather, suffused with awkwardness at its timing.  “Draco?”
“Try again.”  Harry didn’t recognize the voice.  He tentatively opened his eyes again, and noted that whoever it was, they’d spelled the lights lower.  He blinked myopically and, when he realized that he was lying down, tried to struggle to a seated position.  He suddenly realized that he had no idea where he was, that a stranger was talking to him, and he couldn’t remember much from before he was here.  He stiffened, and felt a cool hand on his arm.  He felt his glasses being placed gently on his face, and though he flinched, at least he could see a bit better. “Harry,” the stranger, a woman, a British woman, he realized, said.  “You’re safe.”
“Ready for what?” Draco asks dazedly, prompting Harry to kiss him again, before he pulls away and heads to the en suite.
“And you just let him go?  You let him think that we don’t want him?  You let me think he didn’t want me?”  Cass was furious.  How could she be left out of something so important?
“Dad.  What’s the worst part of all of this?”  Her tone was blunt, and Harry knew that if he didn’t answer her, he’d further fracture their relationship.
“Dad,” Cass laughed.  “Remember when my hockey coach called me a hopeless idiot because I was offside?”
“In the nursery.  Do you have a baby somewhere Draco?  I didn’t expect to see a full nursery in your posh flat.”
Draco felt a hand on his arm.  It was Cass.  “I’m going to sit next to Scorpius, okay Papa?” Her voice was calm, but loud enough that Scorpius could hear him over his sobs.
of it.  The machismo ran heavy in the locker room, and although he was pretty sure nobody would fault him for it, he kept any campy inclinations to himself while in Canada.
Draco didn’t bother to try to wipe his tears away.  The world had hurt this man, over and over, and Draco had never once considered the toll it had taken on him.  In hindsight, everything that Harry did made so much more sense.  More importantly, Draco felt the impact of his own actions in a way that had never occurred to him.  They hadn’t been playing on a mutual field.  Harry had never learned how to shield his soft parts.  Harry was nothing
“I understand, Harry.  You’ve just summarized the great struggle of my life.  How do I balance the duality of what I am?  The man and the wolf?”
She flushes.  “Yes, okay.  I thought it was just some sort of…” she waves her hand vaguely, “trauma thing.  And…” her face suddenly burns brighter red, and she looks away.  “And, you usually only come when you take me from behind.”
“I told him that I had had an epiphany while he was in the shop, and could I buy him a drink to tell him about it.”
“Minerva, and Uncle Professor.  They’ve got this.  You focus on having a good time and enjoying your family, okay?”
There’s an older man standing over a cot, waving his wand and muttering something to a quill that hovers over his head, scribbling onto a parchment.  As he hears the curtain, he turns around.  “Unspeakable,” he says mildly.
“Yes, good.  We’re going to yell, ‘Don’t touch me!’  And when we get away, we’re going to run for help.  What if they don’t stop touching us?  What then?”
“Okay,” she said uncertainly.  She took hold of the wand, and gave it a tentative wave.  Silver and gold sparks shot from the tip.  Madame Lefebvre clapped her hands.
The gym was empty and quiet as Harry entered, but he knew it wouldn’t be long before it was full of noise.  He went into the storage room, and pulled out the mats and dummy.  By the time he had everything ready, the bell had rung, and a crowd of laughing and chattering girls had entered the gym.  In the midst of the crowd, Harry spotted a riot of blonde curls and he felt the familiar wash of pride and awe.  A set of smoky green eyes met his, and he sent a little burst of love over, prompting one that came back just as strong in return.
Narcissa gasped for breath, the effort of speaking taking its toll on her.   As her breaths quieted, she finally said, “Since your Father has gone, I’ve been able to reflect on what meaning I wish to have from my life.  You are my legacy, darling.  I want you to have the life you deserved.  You’ve paid your penance, Draco.  You deserve what you want.  You have my blessing, should you find a way to work it out with Harry.”
“Thanks, Dad.  It’s brilliant.”  Cass pulled the cloak on, saying, “Now, if only I had my wand,” and disappeared through the door with Ginger, leaving Harry to worry about what lay ahead of him.
“That’s…”. Draco didn’t know what to say.  It was heartbreaking, really.  For a single moment, Draco allowed himself to imagine what could have been different, before he realized that it didn’t matter, not now.  Harry had left him too, had hidden his daughter from him.  And even if Draco could get past his sense of betrayal, Harry was over him as well.  “It doesn’t matter.  It’s all in the past.”
After they’d sat there a while, Draco basking in the comfort of his mother, Narcissa spoke.  “What shall we do to get him back, then?”
“Mister Ollivander!” Harry exclaimed.  “Sorry to burst in on you like this.  I was dodging a photographer, and just ducked into the first shop I saw.  But it’s lovely to see you.  How are you feeling?”
“It’s fine, Cass, honestly.  From the sounds of things, you have exactly the wand you need.  Besides, I’ll tell you a little secret.  Any ideas on where the basilisk scale came from?”
The joy rises up like a bubble, filling my stomach with tingly excitement, and making my chest feel tight.  I want to weep, and laugh, and most of all, I want to kiss Draco until he loses that smug little smirk.
Draco had never truly atoned for his actions during the war.  Whether under coercion or not, he had taken the Dark Mark, and he had let Death Eaters into the castle the night Dumbledore died.  He’d also been a despicable little shit during school, and had childishly and selfishly baited Harry, over and over again.  Moreover, though, he’d swallowed the teachings of his Father: That muggleborns were filth, that he, as one of the Sacred Twenty-eight was superior to others, that Voldemort’s plans were the only way to right the balance in the Wizarding World.  Harry’s upbringing had been different than his, granted, but he’d always been strong enough to do the right thing, even at the cost of his life, his friends, his soul.  Draco hadn’t sacrificed enough, despite what he’d thought he was doing by leaving Britain.  This was his opportunity to set things right.
As Harry entered the conference room where the press had been gathered, he immediately wanted to turn and flee.  He’d never seen so many reporters, not even when he’d been awarded his Order of Merlin.  The moment they caught sight of them, the sound of shutters clicking was so overwhelming, Harry could barely think.  He turned to Cass.  “Alright?”
“Just Harry,” he muttered, and with a firm grip on her arm, steered her toward the stairs.  Once back in the lounge, with Mr. Sanders sputtering angrily, he pointed unwaveringly at the sofa.  “Sit down,” he said.  Mrs. Sanders opened her mouth, but clearly saw something about the set of his jaw, and sat quietly.
As he stood and kissed her upturned cheek, she gripped his arm, stood, and then pulled him into a hug.  Save Molly Weasley, Harry hadn’t really felt the touch of a mother.  For a split second, he allowed himself to imagine that things had been different.  That he and Draco had been together, properly together, and that this was his Mother-in-law.  The sensation of loss was so great, that it was all Harry could do to endure the embrace.  When she pulled away, he gave her a weak smile, and headed directly to the floo, unable to wait for a house elf to lead him.  He was just reaching for the dish of floo powder, when the flames blazed green and Draco stepped out.
“Er, yes.  I’m sorry?  I can take it back.  Well, I don’t think I can, actually, that man didn’t seem like someone who’d give refunds, but I can keep him.”  Draco reached out to take the puppy back, but Harry clutched it tighter.
“So did they,” Draco agrees.  “Which is why they passed a series of sneaky bills within the Wizengamot to ensure that what they were doing obeyed the letter of the law.  When some of my old housemates started to approach me, I helped them, in secret.  I smuggled people out of the country, and sold some of their family heirlooms to discreetly pay fines, using the Goblins to avoid being caught.  I’ve been very careful to ensure that nobody knew that I was helping them.  When they arrested Pansy on trumped up charges, I acted rashly, wasn’t as cautious.  Obviously someone figured out that I was the one who was helping.  And when they realized that I was seeing Harry, they got worried.  They sent me a warning last week to break ties with him, and to keep my nose clean, or they’d make me pay.”
“Exactly,” Draco said firmly.  “And in the present, I want to be the person who chooses the right side, who doesn’t stand by while others suffer.  I want to…”
Harry looked so devastated, that Draco was unsure if he’d ever be able to recover from this terrible conversation.  “You think I’m saying this because of the potion.  You don’t think I know how I feel.”
Harry looked across the room.  Draco was impeccably turned out, as usual.  His robes didn’t look uncomfortable.  He was calmly speaking to Astoria and Pansy, and Harry allowed himself a good look.  Draco laughed, and Harry felt his hands tremble.  He was still so beautiful.
“Rarer,” Cici said.  “Please don’t panic, just yet.  Let’s just see how the afternoon goes.  She may wake up at any time.”
Harry sighed.  Kreacher had declared unofficial war on their neighbours in Number Ten, after Mrs. Number Ten had sprayed Kreacher’s cat with a hose.  Kreacher had been incoherent with rage, and it had taken Harry nearly an entire day to talk him out of his more murderous inclinations.
“That’s good,” I say.  He’s getting a little frustrated by how little I’m nudging the conversation along, but I’m curious to see what, exactly, his problem is.
“Stop.”  Miriam’s voice was firm.  “Harry, it would be detrimental to your healing if you were to experience another emotional upset in front of Cass, not to mention the fact that it would be quite distressing for her.  Cass is safe, I promise you.  Let her other Father care for her, and we’ll focus on caring for you, okay?”
She reached up, a little cautiously, and embraced him.  As he held her tight, she whispered, “Love you, Papa,” into his ear.  She’d never said it before.  Draco had begun telling her that he loved her early on…an unexpected side effect of suddenly taking full-time custody of one’s ten-year-old daughter.  Cass had been so fragile-looking after what Harry had gone through, that he couldn’t help but spend a lot of time reassuring her how loved she was.  Cass had been demure.  She’d kissed his cheek a few times, and had hugged him goodnight without fail, but she’d never once told him that she loved him.
“Do you think he would have stayed with you?  If things had been different, and he hadn’t needed to marry a lady?”
Harry reaches out a hesitant hand, and gently strokes the side of Draco’s face.  “Goodbye, Draco.”  He spins on his heel, and he’s gone.
“Maybe,” Harry allowed.  “But until you talk to her, you’re only guessing, and that’s not really fair to either of you.”  He took a long breath, focusing on suppressing his growing annoyance.  Ron and Hermione had no idea how bloody
Ron comes down the stairs then, his face drawn and tired, and Hermione goes to him, holds him tight.  She hustles him to the table, just as Harry is placing mugs of tea.  Ron squeezes her hand.  “Thanks for coming,” he whispers.
“Right,” George said, “Wands at the ready, my darlings,” and he stepped forward and opened the door.  They crept inside and peered around the corner, where a small sitting room lay.  Draco cast a wordless disillusionment charm on them all, just to be on the safe side.  Hermione nodded her approval.
The last thing he thought before he fell into an uneasy, lonely sleep was, this could have been mine.
“I didn't expect you to come to my house.  I didn’t know it would be a problem.  I thought you liked children.  And I wasn’t…I didn’t intend for you to…I…I didn’t think that you would be around long enough to learn about him.  I don’t allow him into society.”
“Hey Rosie,” Harry answered, just as quietly.  The little girl standing on the steps had her father’s fiery red hair, and her mother’s brown eyes.  She moved quickly, and burrowed her face into Harry’s middle.  “Alright?”
“Yes, well so did I, until he looked as though I’d hit him when he saw the box.  He’ll never believe that I didn’t do it to hurt him.”
A house elf was summoned, and a tray containing cool drinks arrived.  They sat in the drawing room, as the sun streamed through the windows, sipping the cocktails in silence for a moment.  “Pansy, how is it that you know about gin?”
“Draco, I…I never thanked you for your letter.  I wasn’t sure how to respond to your apologies, but I wanted to know that I really appreciated it.  And I believe that you’re doing the right things, since…well, since.  And what you’re doing for Harry…I just…thank you, Draco.”  To Draco’s horror-filled surprise, Hermione wrapped her arms around him.  Draco stiffened, and she immediately backed off.
It had been a while since he'd had to take care of someone besides himself, not counting the occasional sleepover with Teddy when Andromeda needed a break. Every day he missed Hedwig, for she had been his friend even when the world had turned upside down. He wasn't looking to replace her, and he definitely didn't see Dragon as a pet; but it was so pleasant to know that he had someone waiting for him at the end of the day. Someone sassy and who matches his every comment.
"I need to go see my mother. I have my body again and she must be worried sick," he informed Harry, throwing his clothes on in a haste and leaving a flustered person behind as if it were nothing. The dots in Harry's head started to connect, of course. He knew very well that Draco meant Dragon, from all the teasing Malfoy had done towards his "mundane" name. Still, it was quite shocking to think about the fact that he'd been taking care of, not to mention sleeping with and changing his clothes in front of, Draco bloody Malfoy.
Another hiss followed, but, as Harry started preparing his own food, a soft "please" reached his ears and he smiled. A small victory, but one nonetheless.
He sighed and kept his back straight, whispering answers to Dragon whenever he complained about people looking.
That had been how they'd fulfilled Harry's dreams for the first time: Draco's morning breath mingling with his scent, Harry's morning erection innocently— at first— rubbing against Draco's buttock. The sound that had escaped Draco's mouth as he woke up had been so sinful that Harry had been unable to do anything, to function any other way besides pining him down on the bed and having his way with him until the house was filled with those sounds.
"Uh- Malfoy?" he tried, poking the blond's arm that had an iron grip around Harry's waist. He could see a fainted, scarred impression of the mark that had haunted his nightmares for too long.
"Uh-" he remembered opening his mouth to say something, but his brain had short circuited somewhere between telling his lungs how to breathe and yelling at his prick to stop swelling. "M-Malfoy?" he finally chocked out.
Where it had been comforting before, it felt too hot now; it felt as if he was going to suffocate if he didn't release the tension growing inside his pants at the moment.
"It's the weekend, Potter, just come to bed and let me sleep," the couple last words were muffled by the pillow, as he buried his head in it, but Harry's body seemed to have other ideas. He adjusted his pants, rearranging himself so his erection would stop forcing itself against the zipper.
He looks at Dragon, who has buried his face in Harry's shirt, leaving just his eyes out. He follows the sound of happy, bickering voices and greets his friends.
He came faster than he expected, but didn't mind it much, since he'd been teased for enough time to feel like exploding.
Harry held him as carefully as he could manage, placing his little head on his hand as he wrapped his body around his neck, lifting his shirt slightly so he could cover at least part of the snake.
By the following Friday, Harry was aware of the fact that, very soon, Dragon might leave. His wound, from what Hermione had explained, would be completely healed once all his skin had shed, which, from the fragments Harry had found in his bathroom floor, would be very soon.
Already clean and warm under the covers of his bed, Harry brushed Draco's silver hair from his face, watching him sleep.
A shiver ran up his spine as the memory of the Dark Lord's fingers touching his face that one day in the grave yard, but this was something else: something warm, alive. Dragon. A recognizable weight settled upon his shoulders and chest and his breath even out little by little, "It's okay, Potter. It's over, now."
"Could- could you guys give me some time to process this, please?" he requested, as politely as he possibly could facing such a situation. Hermione dutifully dragged Ron to the fireplace and home they went.
The need for a different conversational topic grew desperate, so Harry just suggested they headed for bed. Dragon had seemed hesitant, but, upon entering the warm room and receiving Harry's reassurance that they could share the bed if it meant they were both healthy and warm, he made himself at home. That's what Harry told himself as he fell asleep, as he heard a faint, "I'm sorry, Potter."
"Yeah," he sighed. He loved his friend with all her peculiarities. And loved the fact that Dragon had interrupted his rant even more.
The food, as usual, was fucking magnificent. Dragon seemed to agree, as he ate his raw meat greedily. Harry worried slightly, as he didn't know enough about snakes- or any reptile for that matter- to make sure whether or not this was was healthy: if he was under or overweight; if he needed to drink or eat something special with regularity or not. He did know that the snake must've lived with humans before, as it was familiar with every aspect of magic and the wizarding world.
His whole day, Harry hadn't been able to go more than half an hour at a time without chuckling to himself thinking about Dragon hissing in disdain as he looked at the food left him. As he usually ate lunch at the Ministry with Ron and the other Aurors and skipped dinner, Harry hadn't been able to come up with anything more elaborate than- as Dragon had named it- a peasant's meal of bacon ang eggs. He was surprised, even, that the snake had requested to eat them uncooked, but he was no expert.
Whenever Ron even stares at him, though, Dragon makes it his mission to insult him in the funniest ways imaginable to Harry: from pointing out the fact that his fly is, in fact, open, to complaining about his lack of manners as he devours the biscuits Harry offered whole. Harry laughs discreetly, avoiding having to translate the conversation.
Ron had questioned his smile at least twice, but had settled for a raise of his eyebrows after Harry had snapped at him and involuntarily set a desk on fire.
From then on it seemed natural enough to share a bed: Harry made sure Dragon, being a reptile and a snob, didn't freeze; and Dragon made sure to always be there for whenever Harry couldn't sleep through his memories of the war. At least, that's what he told himself everyday at work, when a pressure pressed into his chest and made him feel empty and missing the comfort of someone holding him.
At the moment, though, since he was a human, waking up with his arms and legs wrapped around Harry, his naked chest— Harry didn't even know why in the hell Draco slept naked if not to torture him— almost glued to Harry's side, allowing him to feel every breath and beat of his heart, was a lot more... arousing.
Dragon, apparently, did not want to let go— and, although it was warmer, Harry could feel that his skin was still too cold for him to be healthy. As he held on to dear life and forced Harry to alternate between a bite for himself and a bite for the snake.
When the familiar bitter taste rolled down his tongue and was slowly swallowed by his throat, his wrists were untied and he lost no time to hold Draco's buttocks in place, sucking harder, until his cheeks hollowed and he felt Draco let out a strangled moan as the over stimulation caught up to him, his body trembling under Harry's fingers.
As soon as the blonde hair faded away through his bedroom's door and he heard the sound of green flames, Harry ran out of bed, grabbed a handful of powder as well, still shirtless and wearing only his pajama bottoms, stepped into the fireplace and called out for Hermione's address.
"Harry, mate?" Ron's voice comes from the living room, followed by Hermione's criticizing's her boyfriend's lack of manners and casting a cleaning charm.
When he returned and realized he needed to buy some things, however, he only hesitated a second before asking Dragon if he wanted to accompany him to Diagon Ally. He'd seen enough wizards with all kinds of creatures as they shopped, so his snake would probably not cause much commotion. And it would've worked just fine, had he not forgotten he was Harry Potter, which meant everyone stared and whispered, and he could already imagine the next day's papers- hopefully not the front page-
“Just a few staples, I know you’ll have a house full,” Harry reassures her, and, accepting the kiss she plants on his cheek, goes to the hob.  Hermione watches as he deftly spells the kettle on, puts groceries away, and begins to throw together a simple bread dough.  She smiles, her heart full.  He really is so
His face crumbles.  “I knew that the people who were threatening me were involved with the Ministry, but I never knew who, and I didn’t think they’d be so blatant about what they were doing.  I never dreamed that they’d take Scorpius and when they did, I never thought they’d take him to the Ministry.  I thought that it was someone who was acting of their own volition, someone who was taking things into their own hands.  I can’t believe that this is all officially sanctioned.”
everywhere with wild magic, and you don’t have to tell me how awful that was to explain to her Muggle babysitter.  So I had it down, right?  I was keeping her alive, and she was doing cool stuff, and talking, and she was potty trained.  And then I had to let her go to school, where complete strangers were in charge!  I nearly had a nervous breakdown on her first day of pre-kindergarten.  Severus was about to call Minerva to come and dose me with a potion.”
The next thing that happens, starts out relatively small.  Just a few potions vials, jittering in their stands, the clinking noise as they collide with one another sounding loud in the silent room.  The edges of my vision are starting to turn grey, and the room’s grown unbearably cold.  I haven’t got the slightest clue what the fuck is happening, but my desire to grab Draco, Pansy and the baby and get the fuck out of here is turning into a panicked imperative.  “Draco,” I say, and my voice sounds different, deep and guttural.  “Bring Scorpius and come here.  You too, Pansy.”  I’m operating purely by instinct, and I register mild surprise when they immediately obey.  I grab their arms, intending to shove them behind me, and the air displaces with a crash, and we’re experiencing the sucking, twisting awfulness of apparation.
Miriam smiled.  “I’m afraid that it’s a little late for that.  It was actually your daughter who found you.”
But at the time, even if he had known about Cass, if he’d been forced to choose between his responsibilities, he honestly didn’t know what he’d have done.  He hadn’t had enough life experience to gain the strength of his convictions.  And besides, he attempted to convince himself, he
“That doesn’t seem right either.  What the fuck is wrong with this place?”  I’m starting to get upset, and I can feel my magic rolling off me in irritated waves.  “Why the fuck did I bother winning a war?”
“I don’t really have a budget, Draco.  Whatever material you think best, as many protective spells as you can manage to add.  A portkey.  And…no, never mind,” he says.
When he arrived at the apparation coordinates, Harry realized he was near Scorpius’ school.  A number of emergency vehicles were parked in front, their coloured lights contributing to the chaos.  Harry noticed that some of the windows of the school had been blown out.  He used his Galleon to upgrade the emergency to a Code Red, summoning every available Obliviator and Task Force member.  Suitable explanations would need to be provided, as there was no way that this wouldn’t reach the press.
“Sit with me?” Harry asked, holding out his hand. Draco smiled brightly as he sat, put his arm around him, and gave him a gentle, chaste kiss.
“The love of your life,” Draco repeated with a sigh. “You’re mine too, you know. And I don’t worry about Remus anymore. It’s obvious how much he loves that old mutt of his.”
“I’m glad. Stay as long as you like. I love having you here,” Harry admitted with a bashful smile. “I’m headed upstairs. Goodnight.”
“Yes. He was always pushing me to do things I either didn’t want to do or wasn’t ready to do.” Surprise was written all over Draco’s face as Harry took him by the hands and led him to the couch. Once there, he pulled Draco against his chest and carded his fingers through his hair.
“Lockhart raped me in late February. He and I were in an on again off again relationship. He groomed me while I was still a student. I’d like to help you, but he has videos and photos from my time working as a model for adult magazines. Adult magazines he pressured me to work for. But, it’s my word against his, and what he has is enough to create reasonable doubt,” Draco said dejectedly.
“It can be exciting, but it can also be tedious. I work really long hours. The pay is excessive. More than most make in a lifetime I daresay,” Draco said with a sad smile. He loved his work, but he didn’t love the idea that he had so much when so many others had so little. His aunt was a medical assistant and her salary was modest, so he knew how it felt to just get by.
Author’s Note: Surprise! Two chapter this week, and a new tag! So, here's a little short essay for context related to the chapter, and my opinion on ships, Canon, and characterizing Hermione. I wanted to include Hermione in this story, and this idea of how she and Harry meet was too cute to pass up. Drarry is the end game here, so to all the Drarry fans don’t worry!
Of course Harry knew who he was. His movies were something of a big deal to say the least! But, he never expected to meet him. And he certainly didn’t expect to meet him in the manner he did. The story begins on a rainy boring Wednesday as Dudley and Harry walked from the bus stop to the book shop they worked at. All Things Queer and Trans is a cheerful little shop that sells books and merchandise created by local queer and trans artists. The owner, a guy named Charlie Weasley, is pansexual and obsessed with sculpting and painting dragons. Dudley and Harry clicked with him the day they met him, and the rest is history.
“Do you know Draco Malfoy?” Alex asked, her cool demeanor never fading despite the fact she was about to blow Lockhart out of the water.
Author’s Note: Gaye Magazine is a real publication, and I write for them! You can find my articles here: https://www.gayemagazine.com/profile/82381ac6-b298-4b2a-be67-5fd120351380/profile
In light of everything going on right now, I've changed Olivia Benson's character a bit. In this story, she won't be a police officer. Instead, she will be a psychologist and private investigator, hence the significance of this chapter's title. I've also changed the scene in chapter one where Harry tells the book thief he's calling the cops to Harry telling him he's calling Charlie to ban him from the store instead.
Summary: Harry and Draco arrive at Luna's birthday party! Who all will be there? Read on to find out!
“Yes. Several times. I thought it would never stop. Afterwards, he told me if I told anyone he’d show the court photos and videos of my time as an adult magazine performer. Make it look like I wanted to have sex with him.”
“Oh, Christ no! Rolf is so not my type and I’m not his,” Harry laughed, blushing bright red. “He’s dating my friend Luna. The bathroom is up the stairs, third door on your right.”
“He helped me get my first few paying gigs. I started out modelling and appearing in various adverts. I enjoyed that. A lot. It wasn’t long before he was sending me to audition for photoshoots I wasn’t comfortable doing. But, he knew I wouldn’t turn down the work because I needed the money.”
“That’ll be great. We’ll babysit some too. It’s the least we can do for what you’re doing to help Draco,” Harry gave his partner a fond reassuring smile. Draco’s return smile looked more like a grimace.
“Well, I win this one easily,” Ernie began. “I haven’t had a girlfriend or boyfriend since puberty, and if these cheeks fill out anymore, I probably never will get one again.” Everyone laughed as Ernie continued. “I work the most boring nine to five job on planet Earth, and I spend my free time making an arse out of myself in front of well-known public figures.”
“Marry me,” Draco blurted out, his voice thick with emotion. “When this is all over, let’s get married at Shakespeare’s church in Stratford-upon-Avon.”
“We were glad to,” Alex shook both of their hands and took her leave. Liv hugged them, and they promised to keep in touch with her and little Noah.
“Remus told me. I didn’t want to pressure you into talking about it, but if you want to, I’m here for you,” Hermione smiled and squeezed his hand. “We trans folks have to stick together.”
“Hermione would skin both of us,” Harry laughed. “So your aunt would have to get in line. Let’s plan as we go. It’ll be a great distraction while this is going on.”
“Allow me to uncomplicate it then,” Harry got out of Draco’s car, and flagged down a cab. The last thing he saw as the cab rounded the corner was Draco standing in the middle of the street with a heartbroken look on his face.
“Rolf? Are you here?” Harry called as he walked in, Draco following closely behind him. “Please excuse the mess. My flatmate works long hours, so cleaning is seriously neglected most times.”
He tied Harry’s hands behind his back and put duct tape over his mouth. “Get in the trunk.” Harry began to sob when the trunk lid slammed, encasing him in darkness.
“Harry and I had a fight when I told him who was in my house. He left,” Draco sent Harry a look that clearly said no more apologies. Harry nodded and Draco continued. “When I walked in, I demanded to know why Gil was there. I was under the impression we were over this time.”
“Now take my hand. We’re going for a ride. If you scream, if you run, if you alert anyone, I will shoot you, and then I’m going to pay dear Draco a visit,” Lockhart demanded coldly. Harry took his hand, and schooled his features into something calm and nonchalant.
“Probably drugs,” the second guy sneered. “Bet he’s spent half his bloody life in and out of rehab.” Draco’s smile became fixed, and his face a picture of hurt. “Let’s not forget the kind of movies he’s in. He’ll probably bend over for anyone who pays him any attention.”
Harry made some popcorn, poured them both a glass of Dr. Pepper, dimmed the lights, and started the movie. Every time his fingers brushed against Draco’s as he got a piece of popcorn, he couldn’t help but smile. Soon, the popcorn was gone, and he and Draco were sitting very close. Harry looked at Draco out of the corner of his eye, and motioned for him to move closer. Draco sighed happily as Harry cuddled him to his chest.
“Hey, Teddy Bear! You excited for your sleepover with me, Draco, and Mione?” Harry picked him up and carried him back over to where his teacher looked on with amusement.
Draco leans back against Harry and sniffs miserably. “Dragon, I’m not going to lie to you and tell you I’m perfectly at ease. The man hurt you in more ways than one. There’s also a strong possibility he’s hurt other people. And will hurt more. I can’t just let that go. I have to do something.”
“Not at all,” Harry pointed to the phone on the wall and stepped into the living room to give him some privacy.
“I’ve known Charlie a long time. He was my neighbor growing up. My parents died when I was three, and my Aunt Andromeda raised me,” Draco said, showing him a photo of him being pushed in a swing by a young Charlie while two boys stood behind them making bunny ears on Charlie’s head.
“That sort of thing is popular,” Hermione said brightly. “I’m very good with tech stuff. Just let me know what you need.”
