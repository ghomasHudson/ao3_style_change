“It feels like the house… knows me?” Draco asked with uncertainty, shifting from foot to foot.
“Relax, James. You’re so stiff. Feel the music. Dance
“As ready as I’ll ever be for Luna’s extravagance.” Draco nudged open the front door and stood back to allow Harry to walk in first. “They’ll be in the kitchen. Follow me.”
“Harry,” Draco murmured, “you’re having a nightmare. You’re in my flat, you just need to wake up, alright?” Harry thrashed, and Draco pulled his hand away. He knew better than to try to subdue someone who was still mostly asleep, even if he meant it as a reassuring pressure.
Blaise Zabini sat in an armchair next to Draco’s bed, a book propped open on his knees, watching Ron and Hermione’s exchange with bright eyes. He was Draco’s emergency contact, and as such he was called as soon as Draco was admitted into St. Mungo’s and had hardly left his side, visiting hours be damned. He was in a private room reserved for Ministry employees, so visiting hours were only a suggestion.
“See, you’ve got this.” Malfoy turned his head towards Harry’s, his nose trailing up Harry’s cheek. “Feel the music. Lose yourself. Just let go.”
Healer Douglas regarded Harry for a moment before giving a swift nod. “That sounds like the best course of action. And of course I’ll grant your sabbatical, Healer Potter. You’ve been an asset to St. Mungo's from the moment you finished your training and haven’t missed a single day of work since.” Rifling through the papers on his desk, he pulled out a blank sheet of parchment and tapped his wand to it. Ink bloomed from the tip, writing out the verbiage for Harry’s sabbatical. “Three months ought to do it, yeah?” He asked Harry absently, sliding the parchment across his desk. Harry blanched. He thought he’d be lucky to get two weeks off, but a full three months would be plenty of time to help Draco and possibly find a cure.
“It’s always been you.”
“You can use the bathroom mirror,” Draco gestured to the rear of the store, “Or if you don’t mind it, I’m not too bad with Glamours if you tell me what I need to do.”
“Oh, and these cups!” She withdrew three different sizes of cups, all the same brilliant turquoise that seemed to be alive with how the light and shadows caught the curves. They were cups, alright - and while Draco wasn’t sure of the color at that moment, once the cafe was put together and everything in its place, he had to admit that it had a certain charm.
“Then let’s do this.” Draco interrupted, and reached out to tousle his hair over his scar. “You’ll still look like you, but at least it’s not as noticeable.” Harry shot him a grateful look as the door jingled again, and they heard Ron’s laughter carrying through the small sitting area. Luna raised her hand in greeting, and he, Hermione, Neville, and Ginny all made their way over and squeezed into the booth.
“A bit of community service and gold doesn’t seem like enough after what my family and I did.” Draco shrugged. “I’m constantly thinking about what else I can do to give back, to make amends. There’s probably nothing, but it doesn’t mean I don’t think about it.”
The cafe opened up exactly a month later, in a lovely open plot at Number 24 Diagon Alley. Luna had picked it out after yet another dream had revealed to her that “Two plus four was six, turned upside down is nine, and the square root of nine is three, and three is a very powerful number, didn’t you know, Draco?” He had gone with it, and she was right - it unquestionably was a beautiful spot for the shop. The English Ivy climbing up the brick was a wonderful addition to the sign Luna had put up, the very same one she created when she and Draco had first talked about it.
“Did someone die? Is the cafe closing?” Leave it to Neville to come up with the worst possible scenario. Draco opened his mouth to answer, but to his surprise, Harry beat him to it.
, because without his encouragement, this chapter would still not yet be completed ;-;
My other schoolmates, they’ve got their own lives, and I was never really close with them anyways - some of them went through Auror training with me, and they allowed themselves to be corrupted by the ideals of the Ministry.
“Excellent!” Draco picked at the food on his plate, delicately spearing a bite of eggs and inspecting it before popping it into his mouth. “You’ll be able to pick me up a pastry when you come home in the morning, and I’ll be able to bring you dinner when I get off. Seems fair to me.” He took another bite of eggs, larger this time. “Potter, where did you learn how to cook? I mean, a fry-up isn’t my personal breakfast choice, but these eggs are divine!”
“I don’t want to go with him,” he said. “I want to go with you. To… to our house.” Draco looked down at his hands, clasped tightly together on top of the thin hospital sheet. “I don’t… I don’t feel like I know him at all. I don’t like how it feels when he’s around. I don’t want to be around him, or Weasley, or anyone, really. I… at least I feel like I know you.”
The look of relief on Harry’s face was palpable. It felt as though the sun had burst through the clouds on a rainy England afternoon. “I didn’t want to assume,” he said hesitantly, raising his arms to grip Draco’s waist. “I was hoping, though… I didn’t think that what we had was a one off, I figured it was mutual, but we hadn’t talked about it, hadn’t had
Maybe talk to Malfoy.
Was that considered a kiss?
“Have a nightmare that morphed into a panic attack when you woke up in a strange place after drinking yourself into a stupor?” Draco offered, and Harry barked out a laugh.
“I don't need a babysitter.” Draco attempted to swing his legs over the side of the bed, but the sheet became twisted. Giving an enraged cry, he kicked and shoved at the sheets until he was completely tangled up.
Potter seemed to want it just as much as Draco.
“Not deaf,” his voice was low and ragged, “It’s just easier to sign when it’s loud and after I’ve been shouting and singing.” Pulling away, he gave Harry a full smile, then his eyes swept down, a look of appreciation crossing his face. Harry was, yet again, in a v-neck shirt, charcoal grey this time, and had worn the same dragonhide pants as last Friday. He flushed as Malfoy’s onceover.
“Show off.” Draco said flatly as he tucked into the stew. The beef chunks were large and tender, with just the right amount of comforting spice to offset the richness of the broth. They ate in silence for a few minutes, the only noise coming from the spoons clinking in their respective bowls. This gave Draco ample time to think about the afternoon, and consider any and all interactions he had with Harry. He was dying to figure out why Harry was being distant with him.
Because of course that’s what he’d do.
“How are you like this?” Harry looked like a lost puppy as he sat down on the opposite corner of the couch, morosely picking at the seam of a cushion.
As he watched, Blaise moved closer to Draco and draped an arm casually over the couch behind his shoulders. Harry saw Draco stiffen, then relax and Blaise continued whatever conversation they were having.
He reached out to the handle of the sliding glass door and tugged on it, causing it to silently open into the room. The voices from the couch became audible, and it seemed as though Draco and Blaise were arguing.
“Yeah, but…”
“Hey.” Draco interrupted firmly. “Shut up and kiss me.”
“So then… this is my house, not yours.”
“Sorryyyy~” her voice drifted out, and Draco knew she was going back to finish conversing with the plants they had in the back garden. With a sigh, he placed his own wand next to Luna’s and entered the kitchen. He had quite a bit of prep work to do if today’s opening was any indication. Without the Harpies and their endorsement, he still expected quite a few people to stop by tomorrow; their location was extremely centralized.
They worked in a comfortable silence, mixing, kneading, and cutting the scones before tossing them on trays to be placed into the blast freezer until the next morning. With the five of them working, even with Luna’s bizarre need to dance as she was sprinkling the cinnamon into the pumpkin scones, they made quick work of the dough and managed to leave the shop only an hour and a half past closing. Locking the door and setting the wards to alert them to any unusual activity, Draco let himself relax. ‘
“I’m bisexual,” Harry corrected him, “And erm, no one knows, so can you keep it quiet, please?”
Finally, Draco met Harry’s eyes, and Harry could feel his heart thump painfully in his chest as he saw the tears reflected there. “Grimmauld Place?” He whispered, and Harry nodded, pressing a soft kiss to his forehead.
“I don’t know.” The words were mumbled, but were easy to hear in the noiseless kitchen. “I don’t know why I’m still here, honestly. I should…” He looked helplessly towards the front door. “I should just go. I don’t know why I thought this was a good idea.” Throwing back his drink and swallowing several times, he slammed the empty glass onto the counter and jumped at the crash. He began walking towards the door, but was stopped as Draco’s hand shot out and caught his elbow.
“I can add any flavour you want to the regular coffee. Go look at the syrups and choose one.” He watched as Harry left the kitchen, then busied himself with pulling out the scones he needed to bake for the day. He had everything lined up on the counters and the first round going into the ovens when Harry returned. “What’d you pick?” Closing the oven doors, he set the timer before turning back to Harry, who sheepishly held out a small syrup bottle. Draco recognized it immediately, and he could feel the blush creeping up his cheeks.
“You had a great time, don’t lie!” Ron nodded in thanks as Harry set two mugs of tea before them, and pushed the sugar bowl towards Draco. “Now drink your tea and stop being rude to your roommate.”
"You're other hand, Ron, you know the one with the wand," Hermione said.
"Please, sir! I've got no problem switching partners!"
When Harry took the small dagger it seemed to light up. "Curious, very curious." The man said.
She also barked for her minions to grab the golden trio to her office. To her apparently, the whole show was one of her so-called conspiracies and so she was 'interrogating' them. Threatening to torture them if they wouldn't tell her. It was at that moment Dumbledore appeared together with Fudge.
She closed the book, as she crumbled into herself. She crossed her arms on the old brown book and laid her head on top. Feeling defeated.
After an hour of drowning in his own humiliation and the cold water of the shower, he picked up a striped jumper of the colors white and black, pulling it over his head and beginning his search for a pair of pants. He was now back in the Gryffindor tower -having run out of the room of requirement after a couple of minutes of self-loathing- crawling under his bed to see if he had left one there, jumping in the air when he indeed found a grey pair. Putting it on, he then started to search for his socks and shoes. Looking at the clock he realized they weren't going to make it to lunch.
Harry moved his face up and stared at the empty seat on the Slytherin table. He really wanted to see Draco again. Not only was he getting confused without him here, he was also feeling a bit lonely. He wanted to watch as the blond werewolf enjoyed himself on a piece of stag. Wanted to talk to him about nothing important. Wanted to see that adorable little smile Harry kept replaying in his mind.
'Great, can I go to bed now?' Draco thought.
which means channeling, it makes it so that mates can channel their powers over to you. In the book, I read its completely explained everything, inclusive why I could even use them even when we were just kids. I've never thought about me and Ron being mates so I've never bothered to look for it in those books, but it explains EVERYTHING!" Hermione rambled on and on, her voice excited but also a bit distant.
Ron watched her anxiously, still ashamed of what had happened the day he found out about Harry and Malfoy.
"Ah, there is the little devil." He said while holding a key.
For obvious reasons.
Harry suppressed a shiver at hearing his actual name coming out of the blonde's mouth. He felt awkward as he gave a small smile back.
Harry jumped after hearing a loud 'PANG!' and turned to Draco, seeing a big smile on his face even as the liquid spilled itself all over his hand and down to the ground. After it calmed, Draco proceeded to pour the champagne into the two glasses, setting the bottle down and handing Harry his glass.
Or making fun of Granger for being a mudblood, he didn't even considerate the confusion or the pain that came with being bitten. What if she wasn't lucky and her parents had thrown her out?
"He killed my parents…didn't he…the one who gave me this." Harry said while pointing at his scar.
Harry took in lungs full of the delicious scent that was coming from the wolf. It smelt incredible! And a little familiar. He could feel the big wolf stiffen a bit, but he just went back to his ministrations. Petting the oh so soft fur and sniffing the sweet scent.
"Oh, Granger, I can't believe you can be so blind," Draco said, rolling his eyes.
Dammit.
"Dammit, I want you. I want you, I want you,
"-focus more on the Quidditch try-outs." Harry heard Hermione say, and he noticed that he was too busy with his thoughts and staring that he didn't notice Hermione was talking to him.
"No, it won't!" Harry said again. Shaking his head as he kept thinking about the things that could go wrong. It felt like he was filled to the brim with pessimistic thoughts. And even when he heard that little voice in the back of his head that also said
"Victory." Harry breathed out and then the two ran to Ron. "Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on." Harry said.
To his regret, he needed to admit…he was transforming into his mother.
It didn't take long before they arrived at Hogsmeade. The streets still full of life as the light of the sun touched the streets. It wouldn't take long before all the chattering was gone and the street lamps lightened up, only the pure nocturnal creatures going inside the shops, working the late night shifts. The stars were getting brighter and brighter, much to Draco's delight, painting the dark blue sky on one side while the other was full of the bright orange and purple colors.
"Well firstly, I'd like to know what all this fuzz is about? I've never said you're off the team, Mister Potter." Madame Hooch said looking at the students in front of her, who were looking at her with shock and confusion. Much like Harry himself.
"No, you can go first,"
"Oh, mnn, ahh." Draco moaned and he again hid his face in his pillow, hiding his embarrassment and muffling his moans.
"You wish," Harry answered without any hesitation.
The first few tries Harry had almost given in. Luckily for him, it became easier and easier as time flew by. However, he didn't exactly know if that was because of his own self-control or if it was because the blood started to get a little old.
Harry growled again, moving against the smaller one's body to make sure his entire body was covered with his scent, showing everybody that Draco was his.
"Hagrid, why would the animals need precaution?" Harry asked.
"Harry, calm down," Draco giggled. "It's fine really, as long as you like it that's all that matters."
he was just too adorable.
"Yeah, I guess," He said, turning around to open the door quickly retracting his hand as he almost touched Hermione's who wanted to also open the door.
…Alright he didn't do much
"Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats." McGonagall said.
But Draco's laughter didn't die down, only getting louder -much to Harry's annoyance. Maybe he was stupid after all, thinking it would be a smart idea to discuss matters like these. That Draco would appreciate it more. But apparently not!
(See the end of the chapter for
As Dobby scuttles towards the door, Lucius kicks him through it, then exits himself.
She met his gaze with blurry eyes, amazed by the specks of gold mixed in with his ocean blue. She hadn't noticed it before, never having been in such a setting with him until now. They sparkled like tiny stars, bright and intense, hinting at his magical heritage. She wanted to say that she loved him too but she got cut off when he again pressed their mouths together.
He slowly breathed in and out, trying to calm himself before bringing the goblet to his lips again. But this time he took small sips, feeling his eyes turn back to their usual green. When he was done he sighed out in relief, already feeling much better than two seconds ago.
"Oh well spotted." She said.
"Yep. Apparently, it's his lucky day." Harry said smiling at Hermione. "You shouldn't have done it, Harry," Hermione said, she was disappointed in both of them.
"You've no idea what I just found out! I mean it was so clearly there, but you know me with my stupid brain I've entirely missed it." Hermione started babbling, her expression excited and friendly.
"We still need to go over chapter 42 and two whole other classes, so if you mind I would like for you to put your concentration on that, instead of an idiotic
Draco rolled his eyes again at Harry's dramatic tone, to which Harry needed to interject.
told you all about them when you were secretly meeting up with him and our friend! Telling you how happy and content they were!"
Her pants where thrown to the side of the bed, right next to Ron's. Then he climbed on top of her, their faces mere inches away as he looked down. Her hand reached for him unconsciously, landing on top of his shoulder and catching his attention. In response his eyes widened. An idea popping into his brain, Hermione guessed, because he immediately shot off from the bed to search through his clothes.
"I don't know what this means." The guy asked the professor.
"Come on, it's only Hermione," Harry laughed.
Harry's ears perked up at that. His retort on the tip of his tongue, but decided against it. Knowing that whatever he said, it would be a lie. After all, if it wasn't for his problematic thoughts these past few days, he wouldn't have felt the need to swallow all of his blood supply anyway!
"I know that. Now, don't get into too much trouble, I don't want to be owled by professor Pipsqueak again because you and Harry decided it was fun to color his entire classroom pink, you understand me, young man?" His mother said in a warning tone before turning towards Ginny.
The wolf made a growl as to say, "
"What are you waiting for, an invitation?" Harry said smiling. "Eat!"
"Ah! I remember reading something in Herbology! Wait, Fuck, that's for wizards!" Hermione started to panic. "Ehrm… ehh… what do I do! Ahh, Fuck it, I can always try!" Hermione said and her sharp werewolf claws and yellow eyes appeared.
The snake shook his head.
I've worked you open."
"You think this is funny?!" Ron growled, leaning over the table while glaring at the blonde. Harry knotted his eyebrows together as looked at his boyfriend, noticing the way he had leaned back in his chair as he gave Ron a sly smirk. Like he knew something they didn't. Ron –already in a bad mood- wasn't too keen to his boyfriend cockiness but by the way, the redhead didn't jump on him at first chance, he at least seemed to be acting with some sense…huh, he'd expected it to go much worse than that.
Three days, eighteen hours, twenty-four minutes and thirty-seven seconds. Thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty, forty-one…
When had that happened?
"Ready," Ron confirmed, making a face as he waited for the needles to drive through his skin. Harry took a deep breath, trying to scrape all of his control together as he sunk his teeth into the skin. He heard Ron hiss for a moment as he drunk a couple of gulps, before jumping away from the skin and spitting out the blood.
"And have you made friends with the Potter boy?" Lucius asked.
"We're not going to die, Seamus! I'm sure there is a logical explanation for this." Ron said, ignoring the way his stomach constricted as he thought back at Hermione's flushed face, her sharp intakes of breath, her eyes that were almost bulging out of their sockets. Oh no, what if it really was a disease?! What if Hermione was on the brink of dying right now?!
"Let me speak to him." The voice asked.
"Besides, what does foxglove and galy- or gily- buds matter in this situation?" Harry said with a grin. Bumping his shoulder against Draco's.
And of course, Potter took the bait.
Then Harry turned away, shaking his head. "It's gone," Harry said, looking disappointed.
As they made their way to the intersection of the Slytherin dungeons and the Gryffindor tower, they halted. Putting their hands on their knees and ducking their sweaty foreheads, as if they'd been running for ages.
When the winged creature started walking again Harry took the opportunity and asked; "What are they?"
Alright, to be fair; Ron did have the habit to say whatever was going on in his mind. Which wasn't a
And he didn't plan on stopping it.
his father always said. And Harry knew this. Or at least that he was never late. He'd even commented on it a while back in Potions. He just hoped Harry didn't see it as some ridiculous sign that he had changed his mind or whatever and thought he wouldn't show up. He was going to be outraged if he was standing there only to find out that Harry had left before he had arrived, all his work would be for nothing!
"Ron Weasley, sir. But I'm dead awful at Potions, a menace actually, so I probably should just be going-
"Yes,
Draco moaned, gripping the back of Harry's neck in return, his claws out and slightly scraping it. Trying to angle his head better for them to move more freely. He felt lost in Harry's mouth, his head shortcutting as he felt pleasure unlike he had ever experienced before.
"I need some water," Draco said, and picked up Hermione's abandoned bottle. Turning the cap, he swallowed down half of it. His mind clearing of the fog.
'HARRY, WHAT DID WE JUST TALK ABOUT?!'
Upon noticing Granger growling and stalking closer to Potter Draco jumped before him protecting him from Granger. Granger looked at Draco and stopped growling immediately, her ears stood up however when Potter said; "H-Hermione?"
"I don't know sir," Harry said.
"I didn't tell any of you guys when I suspected something was starting to develop between you two either. I respected your privacy. I wanted you to be ready and make the choice for yourself!"
Hermione silently walked into the room, not looking at anyone as she took her seat, much to Draco's confusion. She always greeted him.
"Can I ask you something?" Draco nodded. "Why..." Harry sighed, squeezing their joined hands again, "Why do you want me to drink your blood?"
"Shut it, mom told me to call you. Hermione has sent you a letter," Ginny said. Rolling her eyes in a fond way before laughing as Ron immediately ran for the big wooden cabin in the middle of the woods.
Hermione chuckled, her laughter dying down and being replaced by a smile. She had missed this, the way Ron would go on a whole story that didn't make any sense, putting some humor in it and always managing to make her laugh. Even when she didn't want to. It was one of the things that made her fall in love with him.
They always did this after practice, trying to use whatever information they had gathered from it and make up a strategy for the game. Sometimes they would work and sometimes they would end horribly. It was fun to do though.
"Neville, I'm really sorry about this and don't worry we won't say a thing," Hermione said and took Rons' hand and with it his wand, just like in charms.
"Why should I?" Ron asked.
"Mn," She pressed a hand against her mouth, afraid of the sound that would come out if she let it.
"Never. No one overcomes in here." Hermione said.
"Alright class, I suppose we start the lesson then, shall we?" Slughorn said cheerfully before the door burst open: revealing a disheveled Harry, breathing at top speed with his Gryffindor tie standing crooked, hair in a complete ravens nest and backpack slung over his shoulder.
"No there's nothing wrong! I-I mean, I'm so happy that, that stupid love potion of Romilda didn't work! Now I've finally got a chance to, to…" She stammered making Harry frown, he looked around searching for anybody who could help him out of this situation. Then he saw Malfoy, and all of his focus ended on the Slytherin who was walking between the tables, his eyes downcast before Katie grabbed Harry's head and kissed him.
part of the room, but he'd also lost Tom Riddle's diary. He was so busy with his thoughts he didn't even notice Ginny until Ron spoke to her.
"I believe you, by the way. That the Ministry is conspiring against you and making you look like you're the devils' spawn." Luna said, picking an apple out of her bag.
"So Dumbledore says." Hermione fired back.
When the shift was over both Hermione and Draco had walked back to their dorm and had fallen asleep immediately when their heads touched the pillow.
When the game started Harry and Draco both took off and tried to find the snitch, running through the obstacles as they were on each others backs every time one of them saw the snitch.
"Isn't that what you wanted?! I recall you yelling at me last year to leave you and your friends alone! And now are you yelling at me for doing what you asked of me?!" Draco yelled furiously back, his tears had dried and were replaced by anger.
"Well, you can tell Ronald-
He turned another corner, passing and ignoring some people who were calling out to him.
"How have you been? Got anything interesting to tell us?" Hermione asked. It sounded like an innocent question to most people, especially when she put on that oblivious face. But Harry wasn't fooled, it sounded more like she wanted to interrogate him than anything else.
"But then again he can take himself," Harry said.
" Draco clenched, putting emphasis on the word.
"Why would he hate
Harry thought furiously to himself as he stormed off to his bathroom. He really needed to stop thinking about it, he didn't want to hurt Malfoy again!
Harry bit his lip as he thought. It wasn't something all to worrying, just little things.
Fluff, I love it almost as much as angst.
'Oh, no.' Draco thought, he really didn't want anybody to know his weaknesses especially not if that persons' name was Harry Potter.
"It had this…syrupy scent, sugary even. When I first smelled it, it actually made my mouth water a little…"Harry said, looking into Draco's eyes with something the werewolf couldn't identify. "It had this…
"So, why not give it a shot?" Ron asked after his laughter cooled down, looking at him quizzically. "I mean, I get the distaste on not being able to finish even one sentence with her, been there done that. I'm just saying, that mate, you've been literally overrun by love confessions. I can see it's tiring you, it's tiring me, it's tiring Hermione…so just pick one that seems nice, get to know her and hey, maybe she will be the one! At least you won't get bothered by barbie one and two while you guys are dating even when it turns out you don't like her,"
Harry calmed down after his little outburst, that he himself didn't quite understand, and felt bad for his friend. It was Halloween and Hermione was still avoiding Ron. Except for the Quidditch pitch though, on which she always sat on the stands watching them practice, but always ran away from when Ron started moving towards her. He understood the need for a night at the pub.
Hermione nuzzled Ron for a moment but it was obvious by the silent snores that there was nothing that could awake him now.
"Best not to mention this to anyone Harry." Hagrid said.
"No idea."Harry immediately said, his nerves returning tenfold. Should he really do this? Was Hermione right all along?
"Right. But before you go," She said, smiling and giving herself a pad on the back for her good thinking. She grabbed a little paper bag out of her own bigger bag and handed it over to Draco before turning around and running towards the Gryffindor tower as she yelled: "You can thank me later for that!"
"Both," Draco grinned, squealing –manly- as Harry started tickling him. Screaming
Harry looked at his friend with wide eyes.
She had said, brightly. Her hands pointing at every flower she named with great enthusiasm.
He'd tried in between classes and was happy when he didn't have to hold Draco back, seeing as he would wait for Harry and it seemed that he wanted to talk too. Most times though, he would be yanked along with his friends –even when he tried to withdrawal from them- and watched the happy face on his boyfriend disappear and be replaced by a look of understanding and disappointment. And the times that he didn't find himself being kidnapped, he actually managed to get a few words out but would be interrupted by a teacher or his fans -that were really getting on his nerves- before he could get to the important part.
"Draco."
"What?" She blinked, getting hauled out of her happy-friend-thoughts and back into reality with Harry hovering above her. "No! He tells me those things in confidence! You don't want me rattling to him about how…perfect his eyes are, do you?" She said flustered.
"Neither was I wagging my tail!"
sure as hell didn't seem small.
Thanks for reading/kudos
What the hell was he saying?!
So I wan't to clear something up, if it seemed in this chapter that I'm gonna do something with Voldemort that is not the case.
This made them take a step back, looking rather nervous. "A-as if we would be scared of you, Potter." Goyle said in a shaky tone, making it obvious they were. "Right Draco… Draco?" He said finally noticing Malfoy had already walked past them.
"Oh thank God, I thought you were going to break up with me or something," Draco said, letting out a sigh of relief before standing in front of Harry and giving him a quick peck on the lips.
And Draco didn't know why it didn't worry him as much as it probably should.
And still no sight of Harry. How was he supposed to deal with this without him!
"Well, I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends...to become killers. Besides, dead, the truth dies with him. Alive, you're free." Harry said happily.
Draco was touching him urgently, indicating that: yes, he was probably pent up. 'Maybe a little too much' He thought to himself as he heard his boyfriend gasping into the kiss and…
Thank god that didn't happen! But that didn't mean he didn't need to get used to his new body.
Damn, Harry thinks, he would never get tired of doing this. If it was up to him they didn't need to do anything else. He was already addicted to Draco's hole. His tight, hot little hole. He was getting lost in his thoughts. They were screaming at him to take what was his and it was almost painful to try and press them back. Their ideas were not all that bad though.
"Huh, that's interesting," Harry said, seeming lost in thought for a moment.
"Fine, give me your goblet." She said, on which Harry eagerly gave it to her. She picked up her back, making a small opening to make sure no one sees what's inside of it and grabbing the blood bag out of it. Harry watched almost transfixed as she poured in the blood, licking his lips. After she handed it to Harry, he gulped it straight down.
Harry growled again. He took a step forward not caring that Voldemort was pointing his wand at him, the curse leaving his lips, but when the green light was only a few feet away from him did he move. And he moved fast.
"But why would you-" His smile froze, eyes unblinking, "Oooh..."
"The party of course," She smiled, "Seriously, you guys did amazing! Everybody is having such a great time. I can't imagine how much work you put into this. How did you even manage to get this stage inside?"
"Alright," Harry said, setting down his champagne on the table. Looking Draco straight in the eye, an excited glint shining in his forest green eyes that could make Draco melt in no time.
"So how is it going with your uncle?" She said out of nowhere. She hadn't even realized her mouth opening and closing until after she let the sentence come out of her mouth. Desperate to hear him talk and get back to their old ways where Ron continued to speak gibberish making Hermione all calm and at ease.
An old man with a long beard raised himself up from the table.
Ron picked up his wand and looked at it, his face still contoured into one of anger.
"In what bloody way?! Please enlighten me!" Hermione snapped, as another third-year ran towards the exit.
As Draco woke up, he had a warm feeling in his chest and a shy smile on his face as he thought back at the night before.
The snake started banging against the glass until there were cracks in it. He banged one more time and the glass broke. While Dudley was screaming and crying, the snake was moving towards the exit but before he was out of sight he said to Harry, "
"Training for the ballet, Potter!" Malfoy yelled not noticing the snitch flying right beside him.
He checked Hermione's name, and saw it was about five doors away from him, so he made his way to the door, standing before it he tucked the map in one of his pockets, Harry would kill him if he lost it. He nervously moved his hand to the handle of the door. Hoping he wouldn't see a lifeless Hermione on the other side of it.
He deserved it.
"Sorry," Ron responded.
"Ron, I need to go. Could thank Mrs. Weasley for the jumper and make sure you thank Hermione." Harry said, before standing up and moving to put the fire out.
"MOVE!" Dudley shouted again.
I hope Hermione doesn't seem a bit to mean when she starts arguing with Ron. I'm saying this because I can imagine wrong interpretations.
"I'm sorry, okay. Ron needed a night out and… so did I and it just seemed like a good idea to skip some time by going into the forest." Harry tried to explain but Hermione only huffed at him, pointing her head at Ron.
Harry removed his fingers then, Draco letting out an involuntary moan in the process but his lover didn't respond to it which Draco was grateful for.
" Ron asked a bit louder than he intended to. Harry turned around to face his friend wide-eyed, slightly wriggling with his fingers in nerves for a whole other reason.
"But the only ball I want you to worry about is this...the Golden Snitch." He said while handing Harry a small golden ball.
Draco was in full wolf mode, he was a white small wolf (mind you he wasn't full grown yet) with grey eyes. He ran to his favorite spot howling at the moon. He always went to this spot, at least when it was full moon, it'd be too far for him on foot. He looked into the distance and saw something he'd never realized before. His favorite spot was really really close to Hogwarts.
Harry took a small step back and tried to think of something to say. To make that cute worried frown of Draco disappear.
"What's that you've got, Hagrid?" Harry asked.
"Oh." Draco managed to say.
"…Aren't we going to study? I thought that was the reason why you guys asked me if I wanted to join your study group? Or should I go?" Neville asked, clearly wanting to be anywhere but there as he looked at the two angry creatures in front of him.
Harry began stirring as Malfoy was watching him, it's the last step and if it worked it meant they won a vial of liquid luck.
"I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language." Ron said.
wanted to suck my cock?" Harry panted, his arousal getting stronger and stronger as he uttered the words.
'Don't think about it. Don't think about it. Don't think about it. Don't think-'
Harry Potter.' Draco tried to make the thought seem hateful and convincing, but even he didn't believe it for a tiny bit.
"Yes. You see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket!" Voldemort said.
Alright, let's get down to business. I've got some bad news for you guys, well not really bad but some might feel bummed out about it. As you may have realized my updates haven't been that regular anymore, as in I don't finish before my deadline of one week. This is because I've been writing much more words per chapter, before my min. was 2k but now that had changed to at least 3k, also I try to get into more detail like I tried with this chapter. This means I'm going to move my deadline from once a week to once every two weeks. Now I actually wanted to go to writing chapters and uploading them once a month, but I hadn't predicted that this story was going to take more than a year (happy new year btw) and I want you guys to have some hindsight into when my updates appear and not having to wait too long for them. I still have the warning that the updates could be late thanks to my schedule, but I'm also adding that it will probably take longer when I have big plans for the chapter: as in long chapters, chapters I need much info on or smutty ones. So that those won't be limited. When I get on vacations and stuff I'll warn you in the A/N.
When the doors opened Harry hadn't been prepared for what he saw next.
He had many questions but hadn't dared to ask. Ugh, why did he need to deal with this
Draco looked up at the sky, following the movements of the sun as it slowly lowered itself down towards the earth. Making direct notes of its position to see how much time he'd spent wasting time on trivial things. He was pretty ashamed of thinking back to it. This wasn't how a Malfoy should act, how a proud, confident full blood werewolf should act.
Harry –involuntarily- let out a low warning growl, feeling the outside ring of his iris's change color, finding great effort to keep himself at bay from tearing Hermione off of Draco. His vampire wanting to protect his little wolf from the threat.
“Bye, ‘Mione. Have a good day.” Harry withdrew his head from the flames and sat back on his heels, rolling his stiff neck and shoulders. He really disliked Floo calls, and he was mildly irritated that he didn’t just bodily Floo over to the house.
“Hey James, welcome back!” She shouted, “Want another Bomb Pop?” Ah, so that was the name of the drink. He smiled and nodded, and she went about making him another of the red, white, and blue drinks with a shot on the side. “Eight pounds, love, and let me know when you’ve finished. It’s buy one get one tonight!” Harry handed over the money with a word of thanks and took the shot. Feeling brave, he motioned Alyce closer.
Not quite knowing how he got there, he found himself in front of the fire, a pinch of floo powder between his fingers. Throwing it into the flames, he called out, “Granger Grotto!” and stuck his head through. At once, he was able to see into Ron and Hermione’s shared living area, and waited for his friends to join him.
Very, very strongly.
Hi everyone, happy April! It's been a while but I'm still steadily working on this fic :)
Harry’s face grew impossibly redder, and he clutched at Draco’s hand under the table. Draco could sense an oncoming panic attack, so he began tapping out a simple rhythm with his fingertips on Harry’s leg; something that he could focus on instead of his embarrassment. Before Ginny could ask or say anything else, Hermione came to their rescue.
“Thank Merlin for that.” Draco bumped his shoulder into Harry’s. “Not my type, that’s for sure.” Relishing in the red flush that creeped up Harry’s cheeks, he waited as Harry followed him out of the cafe and locked the doors behind them.
“I would like to hold you to that sentiment, Potter,” Draco responded, his eyes closed, “But right now, you are high on exhaustion, and I am still very much inebriated.” He turned over, snuggling into the pillows. “Ask me tomorrow when I’m sober.” The soft snores signaled that he had fallen asleep, and Harry padded out of the room and into his own, thinking about what he had just offered Draco.
me, not like we’re two separate beings.” He placed both hands on Potter’s hips, and began to sway them side to side. “There you go, just like that.” It was time to up the ante. Draco spun and plastered his back to Potter’s front, and began to grind on him in earnest.
I spoke to Ron about it, once. He wasn’t understanding at all. He thought Draco deserved to rot in Azkaban.
“It’s been five years since they broke up though, right?” Murmurs of agreement came from Ron and Hermione, and Neville continued, “I always thought they were the storybook romance,” he chuckled darkly, “Always thought he was so lucky to have her.”
“Maybe not for normal comas, but the magically induced ones aren’t that strict.” Harry shrugged. “If he’s tired, he should sleep.”
“Ethan,” Draco began, tucking a few stray strands of hair behind his ear, “I’d really appreciate it if you didn’t tell everyone about Harry working here. Or about our… relationship.” He frowned, but Ethan was one step ahead of him.
“Where’s your wand?” Harry asked curiously, watching as Draco rolled the lemon on the counter before deftly slicing it in half and squeezing the juice into the pan.
After they had parted ways that first time, Luna had given him her Floo address and told him that he was welcome to call at any time. Draco hadn’t been sure of that, but a fortnight later when he had awoken from a nightmare that was worse than the others he’d been having, he threw the Floo Powder into his fire and called out the address she provided. He was whisked away and into an extremely round room, full of all sorts of different plants - and had found Luna curled up on a fluffy couch with her arm around a rather large fern, reading the Quibbler upside down. She seemed unsurprised to see him, and patted the spot next to her that wasn’t taken up by the fern. He had sat next to her and she sat with him, quietly humming, as his heart rate returned to normal and he was able to breathe easier. “I have them too,” she spoke quietly, “the nightmares. I know what it’s like. You don’t have to be alone.”
“You’ve been in love with him for years.” Ron said as he and Hermione shared a knowing look. “You were so excited when he asked you out, don’t you remember?” Harry did remember. He remembered how nervous Draco had been, how he had cooked dinner and burned it, but managed to save the night with a delicious Crème brûlée. He remembered Draco stuttering, so unlike himself, when he admitted that he had a crush on Harry, and would he be amiable to possibly accompanying him on a date at some point in time? Harry had responded with an enthusiast kiss, and that had been that - Harry Potter and Draco Black, dating. It was the best day of his life, to date.
Harry ran a hand through his wild hair, giving Draco an apologetic look. “Can’t you just… make something with the coffee you’re making? So you don’t have to do an extra step?”
He took a step towards Draco, who hugged himself tighter, still staring at a spot somewhere beyond Harry. “Hey,” he said gently, reaching out a hand and rubbing it soothingly along one of Draco’s tense arms, “Why don’t you go home, yeah? I’ll meet you there in a moment.”
Harry woke up, vaguely aware of the warm figure pressed tightly against his body. He moved forward experimentally, groaning as his stiffening cock rubbed against the body in front of him. The body hummed, and pushed back on Harry’s erection. Tightening his hold, he rocked again into the body, one hand moving to tangle into the blond hair at the nape of the neck… and his eyes shot open.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t think so hard,” Luna’s voice cut through his daydream, “He’ll come around.”
It turned into a big ordeal; took over a year for the trials to go through, with me vouching for Draco every step of the way. I provided Memories - the Astronomy Tower when he couldn’t kill Dumbledore; when he refused to identify me at the Manor; when I saw him through Voldemort’s eyes, defying his orders while being tortured.
) so he reached back, grabbed Harry’s hands, and placed them on his own hips. “Here, maybe it’ll be easier if you feel
“Healer Douglas kept you late, darling, or were you showing the new recruits the ropes?” He’d ask when Harry arrived home even five minutes late.
He huffed, but allowed me to rest my head on his shoulder before walking me the rest of the way to the loo. He paused, seemingly unsure of what to do now that we were there, but I took the initiative. I pushed myself away from him and made my way to the toilet, yanking at the pajamas he must have dressed me in, and sat down heavily.
“You and your bloody shots last night,” Draco growled, “knew I shouldn’t have trusted a red head.”
“Okay, Draco, let’s talk about what happened.” Harry flipped through the pages of the chart. “You work as a Curse Breaker for the Ministry of Magic. You were hit by a curse while on a job. You’ve been in a magically induced coma of your own doing for weeks. Your body is fine; you had a few lacerations and bruises that I healed when you first arrived, but it appears that you may have some form of amnesia. Is this making sense to you?” Draco slowly turned his head towards Harry, his face transforming into a sneer.
“You think my name is Popcorn?” Harry wanted so badly to be amused, but in truth, he was heartbroken.
He rose to his feet and approached Harry, encircling his arms around the wild-eyed man. “I didn’t tell him because it was none of his sodding business who I may or may not like,” he murmured into Harry’s thick, dark hair. “I didn’t tell him because, who is he? Some random bloke from the streets, trying to get in my pants because, what, he thinks I’m attractive?” He chuckled, feeling Harry relax into him slightly. Pulling back, he looked into Harry’s green eyes, noting the hesitancy, the hope, shining there. “I don’t kiss and tell, Potter.” Draco leaned forward and pressed his lips gently to Harry’s. “But I will tell you that there is only one hard-headed, idiotic prat I’ve kissed in six years, and he’s right here, in my arms.”
No Magical Trace, no Magical Signature.
“Harry, you were worse than me.” Gently, Draco reached out and set a tentative hand on Harry’s knee. “Voldemort may have been in my home, but he was in your head.”
Sniffling, Draco scrubbed at his eyes, effectively ending his pity party. “Well with such a glowing offer, how am I to argue?” He pointed an accusatory finger at Harry. “You are not to tell me what your name is. I’ll figure it out, on my own. Got it?”
, the absolute bellend.
Harry was silent for a moment, and Draco waited, not wanting to hurry him. “I think that there’s a lot on the surface that will work,” he said finally, “but I also think there’s going to be some things we need to work through. Some alone, definitely some together. I hardly recognize you now; you’re so different from the prat I knew at Hogwarts. But…” he trailed off, then nudged Draco to turn around and face him. “I’m willing to work for this if you are.”
It didn’t.
“Dunno what you’re talking about.” Harry shrugged, reaching a hand up and giving the ferret a tickle under the chin. “This is my emotional support ferret.”
“Er, no, it doesn’t.” Harry cleared his throat. “Would be a bit hypocritical of me, wouldn’t it?”
Someone was screaming.
“No, Kreacher, that’s alright.” Harry appeared at Draco’s shoulder. “You can take the night off. Draco’s here, he’ll keep me company.”
“And the wrackspurts are gone, don’t forget about that!” Luna exclaimed and the tension was broken. Everyone laughed, and returned to their croissants, the conversation bouncing between the Hogwarts Greenhouses, Quidditch, the cafe… and throughout it all, Draco continued to hold Harry’s hand.
“Oh yeah?” He turned the oven off and gathered the mugs, carrying them out into the garden before sitting next to Luna and pouring them both a healthy measure of the strong coffee he had just brewed before adding their favorite mix-ins - a splash of milk, and a drizzle of homemade caramel sauce for Luna, and two sugars for himself. “Where would we open this coffee shop, Luna? What would we even call it?”
Draco lowered his eyes to his hands and picked absently at a fingernail. “Then you are well aware of my inclination towards the male gender?”
“No,” Draco said firmly, “You shouldn’t go.” He looked at the group around them. Neville’s face was flushed and Ron looked like he was going to be sick, while Hermione’s face had twisted into something that resembled confusion. Luna was just… Luna, as usual - humming whatever song she had stuck in her head. “I’m sure you all have good intentions, don’t get me wrong.” Holding up a hand as Hermione began to protest, he continued. “You all haven’t seen Harry out of his house since… when was it? February?” He winced inwardly at the admittance of his eavesdropping, but he plowed on. “You’re literally crowding him and asking him hard questions when he’s just trying to be a part of the group. That’s… you don’t do that.” He finished lamely, looking at Harry from the corner of his eye. ‘Why am I defending Potter?’ he thought wildly to himself as silence settled on the kitchen.
It was then that Harry knew that he was royally fucked.
Draco took a deep breath as he walked down the stairs of the stage, watching Alyce and Potter’s interaction. She had just switched his drink out and said something that caused him to stiffen …
“I promised to keep you safe,” he griped, “But you need to be less conspicuous. Can you do that?” The ferret didn’t look like it wanted to respond, but finally nodded his head once in acknowledgement. “Great. Brilliant. Now,” Harry grinned mischievously, “we’re going to have to come up with an actual name for you.”
“Speak for yourself, Longbottom,” Ginny leaned forward, her head resting on one hand, eyebrows raised. “I’m always down for some down and dirty retellings. So, who’s the top?”
Harry set the tea on the nightstand and cast a Stasis charm over it. Glancing at the sleeping man, he made up his mind and let himself go into Healer mode. Another wave of his wand and the diagnostic bubble encased Draco, showing him that while his aches and pains were relatively non-existent, the red bubble loomed over his head, indicating the amnesia was still very much present.
He wanted to Apparate me to the Manor - I told him it would leave a Magical Trace, and just told him to leave me. He gritted his teeth and removed the knife, wincing as a stream of blood shot out. He tore a piece of my shirt off to press against the wound. “Pressure, Potter.” He muttered before scooping me up and carrying me back to the Manor.
“No! No. Well…” he trailed off, thinking. “Yes, I slept with him but no I didn’t
Harry watched out of the corner of his eye as Malfoy made eye contact with Alyce, then raised his hand into an “ok” sign and made two miniscule movements away from his mouth.
Suddenly, Draco really didn’t want to be alone at the front of the store. “Do you mind coming out front, just behind the counter? I need some help with one of the machines, if you can manage.” He made eye contact with Ethan, who just smiled serenely and gestured for Draco to continue doing what he was doing. With a sigh, he focused back on the machine. The bricks of used espresso were too packed into the dispenser drawer and had started crumbling into the machine, which could result in the machine overheating or, even worse, an expensive repair by the manufacturer.
If they did, there’d be a lot more people in Azkaban. A lot more regulations and control; protection for those who are being hunted.
In the end, they let him go with probation - the threat of Azkaban if he set a toe out of line.
Draco pondered this. The Chosen One, hiding away in his house, not seeing friends or doing anything… sounded quite a bit like himself before he managed to pull out of the depression the war left him in. There were still days when he struggled with getting out of bed, but his Mind Healer had given him coping mechanisms and exercises that usually worked to get him out of his funks. Having Luna as a friend was a godsend, as was the comfort of the three people standing before him. He exhaled noisily. “Do you at least visit him?” He asked, wincing inwardly at the personal question.
“Nope, Pirate’s not right either…”
Harry dropped the pitcher he was steaming the milk in, and the frothed milk splattered everywhere. Quickly turning off the nozzle, he swore as he grabbed a rag and began to clean up the mess. Draco couldn’t help himself — he burst out laughing. “Potter, I swear, you are a disaster but that’s why I love you,” he said, kneeling next to him and giving him a swift kiss on the cheek. “Clean it up and try again. You’re getting the hang of it. And it’s one and a half shots for a large.” He smirked. “It’ll become second nature soon enough.”
. Thank youuuu for everything you do <3
He would definitely be back next Friday.
Of course that was the next question Draco would ask. Harry felt his face grow hot and he took a drink of water to give him time to think. The easy answer to that was no, they were not shagging. The more difficult, albeit more honest answer, would be ‘not yet’. “No,” Harry finally settled on, “We’re not shagging.”
” Harry was now nose to nose with Blaise. “You have no right to coerce him into something just because you believe that he’s incurable.”
Even though they had only been together for a month - two months, technically, if he counted the month Draco was in his coma - Draco had always been it for Harry. Breaking up with Ginny was easy; neither of them had feelings for the other, and it was amiable. She knew about his obsession with Draco; anyone who went to Hogwarts could see it, even if Harry hadn’t realized it until after Voldemort was gone. Living with Draco had been eye opening, and dating him had been a dream. A dream that was now slowly fading as Harry poured himself a glass of Fire Whiskey and made his way to sit in front of the still burning fire.
“Well, James, first things first, I know you’re a wizard.” The eye contact was intoxicating, but he willed himself to stay calm and poised. “The magic you exude is extremely powerful, especially around so many non-magical beings.” Not a complete lie; he could definitely feel the tingle of Potter’s magic, but it wasn’t any greater than his own. Taking a chance, he leaned closer and breathed into Potter’s ear, relishing in the shiver it caused. “Second thing,” he continued, “I saw you last Friday, watching me. I saw you run away. And I can
Also yes, I have Draco singing 'Bring Me To Life' by Evanescence xD
I watched, as his face turned from red, to purple, to a bluish-grey - his hands scrabbled at my invisible ones, trying to pry me off, but to no avail - I had the same training as him, after all - I knew the counter-moves.
“I can assure you that I am the real, flesh and bone Draco Malfoy.” Draco picked up Harry’s glasses from the night stand and held them out, still keeping his distance and trying to appear non-threatening. Harry snatched the glasses from his hand and shoved them on his face, eyes now focused directly on Draco.
“But you’re not.” Harry was working himself into a frenzy. His face began to twitch and his knees shook, as though they were about to give you. “You’re not an arse and you’re supposed to be an arse and why aren’t you an arse? Why aren’t you Draco Malfoy?” Shutting his eyes, he rubbed his hands hard across them. “Why aren’t you…”
“Not interested, Granger.” Blaise interrupted. “I’m hungry, tired, grumpy, and I haven’t spoken to my wife in days. I’m sure you’ll send a Patronus if there’s any update. Good day.” He swept from the room, leaving Ron and Hermione to look at each other in bewilderment.
“Are we friends?” Harry looked as though he would be crushed if the answer was no, and Draco swallowed.
Harry could feel his face fall. All of their memories, clearly displayed around the house, both Muggle and Wizarding photos… “Yeah,” he said dejectedly. “If you could, please. Remove the more… couple-y ones from view and stash them in my… oh.” Yet another realization hit him. “Stash the photos in my room. Keep some of the ones of all of us up, though. And,” yet again, his face turned a bright crimson, “Can you move his stuff out of my room and back into his?”
His train of thought was interrupted as Harry reached over and touched his hand tentatively. “You alright?” He asked. “You seem to be in your head. You don’t have to stay if you don’t want to… if you have somewhere else to be.”
“Paperwork is filled out. Don’t you have to take it to your boss?” He held out the papers, and Harry tapped them with his wand, causing them to disappear.
Harry chose to ignore the quip. “Looks like you were marinating some lamb before you were in St. Mungo’s. Statis charm is intact, so it should still be good.” He glanced over his shoulder. “Feel like some lamb shanks? I can make them.”
“No shit.” Harry said under his breath, watching Malfoy climbing down the ladder. The bartender laughed and extended her hand.
It became easier after that. She had helped him find a Mind Healer who didn’t bat an eye at his past, and they had fallen into an easy, comfortable friendship. Luna would get him out of his flat more often than not; whether it was to catch Freshwater Plimpies, harvest random fruits and vegetables from these things called “Pick Your Own” farms, or to walk around outside, not saying much, but just enjoying each other’s company. Draco loved his time with Luna. She was like the sister he never had. She never brought up the past, and was always full to the brim with interesting ideas and tidbits of information.
to talk about it, what with everyone showing up last Sunday and not having any sort of alone time to discuss…”
“Who?” Draco startled as she reached out to pat his arm. Luna always seemed to know when he wasn’t all there.
He danced with the finesse of someone who had been doing it their whole life. Music was his kryptonite, and always had been. Even as a child taking ballroom dance lessons at the Manor, he knew how to move and sway to many types of music, classical or otherwise.  He knew what he looked like and how certain moves would elongate his elegant limbs, and did everything he could to enhance himself. He lost himself in the music, almost forgetting his plan of enticing Potter, as the beat grew heavier and the music fluctuated.
“Seven.” She confirmed. “See you and… him, then.”
“Even after paying reparations?” Harry asked, “After everything the Ministry had you do, after your trial?”
There are perks to being famous, after all.
The shadow of a smile glimpsed across Harry’s face. “Really? I didn’t mess it up?”
me, not like we’re two separate beings.” He removed his arm and moved it down to Harry’s hip, directing him gently to sway with the beat. “There you go,” he murmured, “Just like that.” Without warning, Malfoy spun around and began to grind on him.
He couldn’t.
“Yeah, but…”
Luckily enough, Draco wasn’t one to keep his mouth shut when he wanted something, so after a solid sixteen months of Harry pining, he was surprised and delighted when Draco asked him out.
Dropping his fork with a clatter, Harry started at Draco, who resolutely refused to meet his eyes. “Do you… are you referring to the fact that you’re gay, Draco?” He asked incredulously.
“I don’t need money, Luna.” Harry said finally, and Draco released the breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. “I don’t need to be paid, and I know you — and probably Draco — would want to pay me.”
But Potter had been drinking, and Draco had not, and he was not about to take advantage of The Boy Who Lived, no matter how much he wanted it.
Hermione shook her head apologetically. “You know that I work tonight. Maybe this weekend?”
He relished the control he had on the patrons of The Castle. It was a Muggle club. No one knew the Malfoy name. No one knew what the Dark Mark meant - most of the people who commented on it were impressed with the craftsmanship, and asked who the artist was.
“Not deaf,” he spoke directly into Potter’s ear, “It’s just easier to sign when it’s loud and after I’ve been shouting and singing.” He appraised Potter, letting his eyes sweep across the broad chest and tight dragonhide pants, not hiding the desire in his eyes. Yes, he had dreamed of having Potter above him, around him, tangled up in him, but he never thought they’d make it further than dreams.
“Nah, it probably was,” Ron said cheerfully, “But that’s our Harry. Doesn’t say a damn thing he doesn’t mean. Bet he can’t wait to wake up to your pointy face every morning!”
“Draco saved the last blueberry one for you!” Luna enthusiastically grabbed his hand and pulled him back towards the kitchen. He trailed along behind her, still taking in the cafe. He noticed the sign above the kitchen door before Luna pulled him through, and hurriedly grabbed his wand from his back pocket to place in the receptacle. Draco stared - he usually had to remind his friends to put their wands there, and here was Harry sodding Potter, following rules like he had been to the cafe dozens of times before.
Taking a deep breath, Draco settled himself into baking mode as he whirled around the kitchen, grabbing his ingredients and deftly pouring them into his industrial mixer. For the more showy pastries, he would focus on the weighing of the ingredients, but for the basic batter he’d be using as a base for his flavored scones, he knew the ratios by heart. He held back before flipping the switch, going over his mental checklist three more times before nodding and turning the mixer on “low”. It only needed to mix for a bit before separating the batches and adding the mix-ins. Voices drifted into the kitchen from the dining area, and Draco pressed eight minutes into his timer and walked idly to the sink to wash flour off his hands when he heard something that made him pause.
“Of course I do,” he scoffed, “It’s Draco Lucius Malfoy.” Harry’s face fell, and he shared a look with Ron and Hermione.
Draco hauled me into the manor and cast a lightening charm on me as he carried me up the stairs and to his bedroom. He took me into the ensuite and set me in his bathtub, pulled his wand and pointed it at me. His eyes were bright; with exhilaration or fear, I wasn’t sure. A single whispered word…
“Give me a bit,” he growled, “I need to calm down, and I don’t want to hurt you or anything here.”
“What?” Slowly, he approached the bed, watching as Harry’s movements grew more frenzied. “What do you mean, ‘you’re not real’?” Harry managed to throw himself off the far side of the bed and stood on shaky legs, his eyes squinted, probably looking for his glasses or his wand.
” He began gyrating his hips, not fully flush against Harry’s, but enough that Harry could feel every brush of movement.
Harry felt his heart speed up. This was so much closer than the cage. He was literally standing right next to the stage, and Malfoy was barely five feet away from him. He felt bodies jostling around him, everyone crowding around the stage.
He was a professional, after all.
He wanted so desperately to help Draco, but he had no idea where to start. Being an injury Healer was easy; the diagnostic spell was almost foolproof and there was a potion or a tincture for any physical malady. Brain injuries and damage, though… those were a whole different story.
“All right there, mate?” Ron clapped Draco on the shoulder, causing a wince of pain. “Oops, sorry. Thought that was a green spot.”
Ah, she had told Potter that he was on his way over.
The kiss they shared - scant as it may have been - set all of Draco’s nerves alight. He wanted Potter, possibly more than he had ever wanted anyone else.
Now, though?
“Do you think he’d remember you if you two were… intimate?” Hermione’s tone indicated a clinical question, but her red ears gave away her embarrassment. Ron spat out the coffee he had just sipped, and Harry coughed loudly.
“Precisely.” Draco sighed. “I forgot to empty the drawer after the rush and now it’s clogged up. Do you mind taking it apart and cleaning it out for me?”
.” She fluttered her eyelashes, making Draco blush furiously. Potter was interested… in him?
“There were posters up everywhere,” he enunciated, waving the smaller version that Alyce had given him in her face, “EVERYWHERE, Gin. HOW could you not know?” Ginny straightened up and turned to look at him slowly, one eyebrow raised.
“But that’s what makes them taste good.” Harry pouted behind his mug, which was already half empty.
Harry shuffled his feet, willing his face not to turn red. “I got him from the Magical Menagerie,” he hedged. “Why would Malfoy be there? There were a ton of ferrets to choose from. I just liked him the best.” The ferret preened, nipping Harry’s ear. “Ow, you prat, stop it!”
“Why aren’t you making espresso?” Harry yawned as he followed him into the back. “Don’t you need extra caffeine for… I don't know, energy for waking up at this awful hour?”
“Well, that sounds normal,” Ron laughed, and Harry shot him a scathing look that didn’t hide the fondness he felt for his amnesiac boyfriend. “Go tend to him, Poison. We’ll do our reading here.”
A chorus of boos rose from the crowd, and Malfoy dropped into an elegant crouch, resting his wrists on his knees and glanced around the people in front of him. “Not to worry, not to worry. I still have something fun planned for you all. Who wants to see a show?!” The response was deafening, and with a nod to the DJ, Malfoy rose to his feet and twirled around, his arms held wide. “Let’s get this party started!” With that, the stage flooded with a multitude of different colors and the music began again.
“I have a television!” Harry sputtered indignantly. “Do you expect me to sit at home and just… what? Read?” He shuddered. “I’m not Hermione.”
“This feels so weird,” Ron shuddered as he stepped through the magical damper, “You really work like this?”
Maybe you wouldn’t.
A shadow crossed over Harry’s face, and for a moment, Draco’s stomach clenched. Of course Harry didn’t want to spend more than a day or two with him. Hadn’t they just talked about their explosive past, and how it may be difficult? Wouldn’t it be worse if they were constantly in the other’s presence?
“But just because of what happened this morning doesn’t mean we’re in a relationship.” Harry knew he was digging himself into a deeper hole, but he couldn’t stop himself. “It could have meant I woke up randy, it could have meant I was having a dream…”
So this was the game Potter wanted to play?
Potter.
“Can’t you skive off?” Harry pleaded. “This is so important, we have to figure out what happened to Draco so we can put him back to rights…”
Draco didn’t know they were dating, and this… this was fully taking advantage of the situation.
Harry had had enough. “Leave him alone.” His voice was barely above a whisper, voice simmering with anger. “Don’t come near him again, or else.” A rickety table holding several large Mimbulus mimbletonia exploded, and Harry smiled slowly. “Or else.” He repeated, before turning on the spot and Apparating, ripping through the Zabini Manor wards as though they didn’t exist.
“It would be good for both of you.” Luna was persistent. “I know how lonely you get, Harry. And, you’re the only person Draco trusts to be back here without his constant supervision.”
They evened each other out, to the point where they’d spend long hours just talking, sharing a drink in front of the fire, or even in comfortable silence; Draco looking through case files, Harry reading the latest Quidditch magazine.
“Harry… you know Malfoy is an Animagus. A ferret Animagus.” She stared pointedly at the animal, who had draped itself over Harry’s shoulder. “And you also know that he’s a wanted man; the Ministry has been looking for him for days now! How can you be sure that
“Draco, wait,” Harry panted finally, placing a hand on Draco’s chest and pushing him just far enough away so that their lips were no longer touching. “I don’t want to… I mean, I haven’t, and I don’t want to… yet…”
, it would be unethical to…”
Understanding the dismissal, Harry stomped down the stairs and bustled into the kitchen, slamming the kettle onto the stove. He knew he needed to keep his temper in check; Draco had amnesia, for Merlin’s sake! If he couldn’t get through this, maybe they shouldn’t be dating. Frustration coursed through him; partially at Draco, partially at himself. He knew that Draco was an absolute git, full of sass, but beneath it all, he was a relatively decent bloke with a good sense of humor.
“You’re not real!” He shrieked, attempting to disentangle himself from the blankets. Draco froze.
He had only let himself accept it once he and Ginny had their big fight and she had proved that the feelings Harry had towards Malfoy weren’t completely hatred.
I’m the one who protects the ones who need it most. You’d be surprised at how much violence Voldemort left in his wake.
How many was it now? I thought back to the numerous people, the articles in The Prophet, the ones whose bodies I hid so well that they’d never be found.
“I like having a regular coffee to start the day, so I can sip at it.” Draco shrugged. “Sometimes I’ll add in a shot of espresso, but I’m awake today so I don’t think I need the extra caffeine. Why, would you like me to make you a fancy latte?”
The majority weren’t.
He’d have to lure Potter back and make a move next time.
“Should have chosen a different Glamour,” Harry complained next to him, giving his scraggly, sandy blond beard a scratch. “This is not comfortable at all.”
Did Malfoy kiss him?
“Muggle?” He asked, and smiled when Draco nodded. “Brilliant.” His face seemed to shimmer, and his hair turned back to the messy jet black locks; the lightning bolt scar reappearing on his forehead. Draco noticed that he took a deep, steadying breath and the smile on his face became a bit strained. “Ready for your party?”
“It’s not that I don’t like them.” Draco blew across the top of his hot coffee, and took a careful sip, allowing the smokey, bitter brew to roll over his tongue before swallowing. “In fact, I do like them, rather a lot, and that’s why I try to limit my intake of sugary drinks. The average coffee shop drink is pretty high in sugar, especially the ones with the specialty syrups.”
They decided to have the cafe open six days a week, Monday through Saturday, between the hours of 7am and 2pm. That would give Draco enough time after work to prep the various batters and grind the coffee beans for the next day. Sunday, of course, was their day to spend time at Draco’s flat and think up new combinations and flavors for the scones and muffins.
“You’re mine.”
the wages, we can always donate them to the War Orphans fund, or to whatever charity Hermione is currently working with in the Ministry. What do you think?”
Hermione was silent for a moment. “I don’t think that Draco visiting Blaise is the best idea,” she said. “Blaise has always come off as very…”
“Could just take it off.” Draco suggested mildly, sipping his juice. The look Harry gave him could have melted a glacier, but it only made Draco chuckle. “If you’re uncomfortable, no reason to have it on, right? We’re meeting our friends. They know who you are. Might as well look like you.”
Monday morning, a girl walks into Harry and Dean's room. Without knocking.
But they weren't. Ron was sharing a room with an engineering major called Seamus and a botany major called Neville, and Harry apparently got put in the only two person room in the building, with a film major called Dean. "Wait, you didn't ask for the two person room?" Dean asked him. "No, honestly I didn't put too much thought into that form apparently. I didn't even know there was a two person room." Harry felt, again, like everyone came to this school more prepared than him. "Pretty much everyone wants the two person room. It's the best. You only share it with one other person. I thought I only got it cause my dad is friends with the dean. I'm surprised they gave it to you instead of someone who asked for it. Well, you really lucked out aye?" But Dean seemed somewhat disappointed. Harry figured, it really wasn't the most fair that he got the best room without even asking, in place of someone who really wanted it, but he wasn't going to complain about his fortune.
I said don't get used to it.
"Come on Granger don't fool yourself, you're not expecting anyone to arrive, you're five people sitting in a room and screaming into the air." The blond that Hermione called Malfoy spoke in a slow condescending tone and the smile on his face wasn't happy or kind. Just when Hermione had opened her mouth to retaliate another face appeared in the door, that of a thin and tall bloke with sharp cheekbones and dark skin. "Draco, are you coming or what?" He called for Malfoy, completely ignoring everyone else in the room.
"I'm taking charge of the discussion. I mean, unless you have any objections or you-"
"He's joking, of course we'll join you" said Dean who had just bypassed Ron to talk to the two guys.
"But Harry," said Remus, "I wanted you to meet Albus and Rubeus tonight because they actually live quite near to you university. Coming over here is a long way to go and I know we probably won't be able to see you often during this year, but when I was your age I could always come to Albus and Rubeus' place if I needed anything, and I wanted you to have that too."
"We showed up" said Hermione, "and maybe with time more people will join, I mean, sometimes it's easier for people to join an existing group than to start one from scratch".
"Ooh, yeah, posters, that's a great idea! We should-" Hermione began, but in that moment, walked through the door a fit white bloke with light blond hair and a sharp chin. He was wearing a dark green long sleeved button down and was walking tall and slowly as if they've all been waiting for him.
"I might have to agree with Granger on that one," said Katie, "we know you're mates with that Malfoy bloke."
"Good game everyone, hope you're not too upset that we kicked your arses," said Oliver as they were all gathering their things and heading for the dorms. "You've got an ex pro player on your side, how's that fair?" Said Ron, who sounded genuinely bitter about it. "Sore loser, aye?" Mumbled Katie Bell. Harry gave Dean a look that meant this was their time to go and talk to Katie and Angelina about the meeting and him and Dean both paced a little faster to catch up with Katie and Angelina who were walking in the front of their little group. "Hey, it was really fun playing with you all, you two are wicked players" said Dean. Angelina giggled, "well, you lot aren't so bad yourself. If we didn't have Victor on our side maybe we'd even get a tie." Harry laughed too. Angelina wasn't being snarky, she was just taking the piss. "Well, our friend Hermione Granger and us, me and Harry, are starting a Black Students Association, to talk about things we care about and what kind of actions we can take together. Our first meeting is next Tuesday at three in the meeting room in the Salazar building. Would be cool if you'd come." Dean seemed a little nervous to ask them, but not half as much as Harry would have been to ask that to two girls in year two who only know him cause he just mopped the floor with him at football.
The vote was unanimous. Blaise was now a part of their plan.
"Well, the way she talks in class, if I had to put money on who would start a black students association without knowing I would bet a thousand quid on her." And then, when he saw Harry's still questioning look he added, "you know, she always has something to say back to the professor, like this law is unjust and that law is outdated and this policy is racist. She's right about the lot of it, she just makes her opinions very known is all."
"Dean told me you guys like football and they're out on that football field every day, I thought maybe you got to play with them or get to know them somehow. I really want to invite them to our meeting, I thought if you knew them it would be better if you did it." Hermione seemed a bit disappointed and also nervous, but Harry could only say "I didn't get to see the football field yet" which was true. He didn't even know the school had a football field. Yet again, it seemed that Harry knew nothing and everyone else knew everything.
Hermione seemed to consider it for a second. "All in favour of Blaise joining us for our upcoming action?" She asked
Out of nowhere, Hermione sneered. "Oh, come on, you really think that's gonna work on us? I don't know what's your goal here but obviously we're not letting you in".
Dean had a lot of posters, of american movies that harry didn't know, and also of football teams that harry did know, and he felt glad that he had something in common with dean that they could talk about. Dean mentioned that he and Seamus went to highschool together, so they decided to go over to the other room. The five of them together was better than trying to get along with dean by himself, Seamus clearly brought out the more silly side of Dean and Harry felt more comfortable with ron around. Neville was even more shy than Harry and had a slight stutter. They had an instant ramen dinner together, all five of them in Ron, Seamus and Neville's room, and eventually Harry and Dean went back to their room and got into their beds.
All of Sirius' photos were black and white, so what Albus said came as a surprise to Harry.
"You want to join us?" Said another, deeper voice with a thick Bulgarian accent, and Harry noticed behind the first guy a slightly shorter guy with dark buzzed hair, a large nose and dark bushy eyebrows.
I couldn't wait a week to post this chapter, but don't get used to it
"When I heard of Albus' actions I immediately wrote to him and thanked him for standing up for me in the way that he did. We continued to correspond and eventually met in person as well. Albus is a very distinguished academic, in fact he recently used his connections amongst educators to get me my teaching job. His fight against the university made headlines. Although my name was not published the other universities all knew about my status and would not accept me, which is why I never went on to higher education, but Albus would host me in his home and we would read and talk together, he taught me more than any school could. He introduced me to Rubeus and I introduced them to Sirius and James. When I wasn't accepted at that first uni my friends were furious for me and refused to go without me. All but Peter, who wouldn't give up on his dream school, enrolled there and lost touch with us shortly into his first year. Sirius, the rebellious git he was decided that if I can't go to uni than neither could he, but he couldn't sit still long enough for Albus' lessons, he went on a different path and made the choices he made. Your father however decided to enroll in a different university, which ended up being lucky because that's where he met your mother, and not three years later you were born."
"Although, if I remember correctly, u had the highest grades out of the four of you, by far." Albus added playfully, and Harry wondered how he could know that.
Hermione seemed immediately upset.
Harry thought for a moment.
Hermione, Katie, Dean and Harry all raised their hands.
"And what exactly will they be joining?" Said Katie, "what can five people possibly do?"
And she left the room. Harry felt quite baffled at the amount of information led on by Hermione's surprise visit. She seemed like a very intense person. Harry turned to Dean, still in confusion. "Is, she your girlfriend?" He asked. Dean made a noise between a laugh and a snore and answered "no, she's in my art history class. She's pretty intense but she's wicked smart ,she asked me if I wanted to start a black students association and I said yes. All of that stuff about Salazar Slytherin is pretty fucked up, I mean everyone knows he was racist and they still have a building named after him and a statue of him like his some kind of hero. Plus, it's always good for us black students to stay in touch with each other and be able to talk stuff out together. Make sure we can represent our interests, you know?" Harry took some time in silence before answering.
"He clearly already knows" answered Angelina.
Ron meets Hermione for the first time, and Harry, Ron, Seamus and Dean play football against older and better opponents.
They stayed at the dinner table long after they all finished their meals, telling stories about the past, about Harry's parents, and Sirius, and Harry drank up every word eagerly, wanting to know everything he could and more. It was like Sirius' photos have come to life again.
"Angelina! You're not supposed to talk about actions we're planning with people outside the union!" Hermione looked horrified.
As they were walking out of the Salazar building and past the large bronze statue of Salazar Slytherin near the entrance, Harry saw Draco Malfoy and his friend Blaise sitting on a bench near the statue. Hermione gave them an angry look and Harry couldn't stop himself from asking. "Don't you think you were a little too hard on that Draco guy before? Maybe he was right, we could have been more quite." Hermione turned to look at him with the same angry face. "You don't understand Harry, he wasn't making a simple request, he has a problem with us. He probably doesn't even want us in the building."
"There's Angelina and Katie" Ron pointed at two girls across the field, one very tall with dark cornrows in her hair and one shorter with lighter skin that had light brown curls.
"All opposed?"
"Yeah, we can start a petition to change the building's name, if we get enough people to sign it we can bring it to the dean and request that the name be changed or we take further action, like demonstrating or something." Hermione began racing, writing in her notebook simultaneously with talking.
"Lily was a brilliant young mind" said albus, "sharper than almost any I've known. And your father was as eager and passionate to change the world as she was to understand it. He cared deeply about the ones he loved, more than anything. So did Sirius. They were great and one of a kind people."
As unready as he is, Harry begins law school. Luckily he quickly finds Ron, who is just as unready as him, but in different enough ways that they compensate for each other.
"You're quite right Rubeus, but he has lily's eye colour." Said Albus, looking at Harry over his glasses.
"Where did you know them from?" Harry asked, eager to know every detail.
I would love to get comments from you it's very fun and encourages me to keep writing.
"Right on time" he said nonchalantly at Ron and Harry, who got there a few paces before dean and Seamus, "we were just about to start another game"
"Salazar Slytherin was a white supremacist? Oh, I guess he did leave the school after it was de-segregated didn't he? That is pretty fucked up. So is that what your meeting is about? You want to change the name of the building?"
"What about him?" Asked Katie in her usual impatient tone
"I'm Harry"
This is probably my favourite chapter that I've written so far. A lot of new characters! Hope you enjoy.
When Tuesday came along Hermione had reminded everyone of the black students association's first meeting so many times that it would have been impossible for anyone to forget to be there at three. When the hour finally came, Hermione- notebook and pen in hand-, Harry, Dean, Angelina and Katie were all sitting around the square of desk in the middle of the meeting room in the Salazar building, waiting for everyone to arrive. At three fifteen, Hermione had to conclude with much visible disappointment that they were probably everyone. Harry was unpleasantly surprised. He had seen Hermione talk to quite a lot of people about the meeting over the week, he assumed at least some of them would show. Harry had an uncomfortable feeling that perhaps Hermione's talkative and over enthusiastic nature had accidentally pushed people away instead of drawing them in to her ideas.
By the end of the meeting, Hermione has volunteered to write a poster which Dean will design and Harry will print, and then they will all go put them up together on the Salazar building sometime before the next meeting.
"What does she even want you to talk to them about?" Ron asked, looking after Hermione's tracks long after she'd disappeared into the building. "She's starting a Black Students Association, the first meeting is next Tuesday, I guess she wants me to invite them to come." Harry answered.
As always this took a million years. Make sure to leave any kind of comment and maybe the next chapter will take less than a million years to post
When he walked into the kitchen the odd couple sat at the table immediately caught his eye. They were both very tall men, which Harry could tell even when they were sitting down. One looked fairly old and skinny with long white hair and beard and thin glasses. He was wearing a purple velvet vest on top of a pink formal button down with a thin blue flower pattern on it. The other man was even  taller than the first and much wider, with long black hair and beard. He was wearing a simple flannel shirt that had some fresh mud stains around the cuffs.
Harry's room at 12 Grimmauld place was Sirius' childhood bedroom. Harry never bothered removing the posters and photos on the walls, in fact, he liked them, especially finding pictures of his parents, letters that they wrote to Sirius. The room was covered in memories of them, and of him. Mostly from their youth. When he was a kid, he could spend hours just looking through the photos and letters, it was exciting, discovering his parents' past. But since Sirius died there was something sad about it. The memories ceased to be living, vivid and exciting. They were dead now too.
"I'm glad you're doing alright Harry" he said.
For the rest of the meeting Harry was distracted by the thought of Draco Malfoy and the interaction between him and and Hermione. He couldn't understand why Hermione reacted with such immediate hostility toward his- fairly reasonable- requests. Was it really just her uncompromising determination to claim a space for black students in the Salazar building, or was there something more going on?
It was nearly midnight when Remus said "I wouldn't want to keep u here too late, you've got a long drive ahead of you." And Rubeus said "indeed, indeed." And got up to put on his jean jacket lined with fur inside.
That very same day, during lunch break, Harry saw Hermione again. Him and Ron were smoking on the lawn behind the cafeteria building when he noticed her power walking towards them from the direction of the Humanities building. "Hey Harry, Hey Ron" she said as she stopped next to where they were sitting on the grass. "Hey. Wait what." Said Ron, who apparently needed a moment to realise he and Hermione have never met before. "Ron, this is Hermione, she already knows you cause she's in all of our classes, she's a law major too." Harry said patiently, savouring the confused look on Ron's face. "Oh, yeah, you're that girl who always sits in the front and answers all the professor's questions. And then asks more questions. And probably answers those too."
"And afterwards we'll vote on whether or not to let him in" Angelina added.
"Well, the first step should be to print out posters and hang them on the building, to let people know who this man really was. Not everyone knows about it because it's erased from the school's history, obviously. Once we raise awareness to it people can start getting behind things like petitions and protests and shit." Dean said.
When they finished their last class of the day Ron suggested they head to the dorms. "This school is huge but the dorms are surprisingly small. Do you know what dorm building you're in yet?" Ron asked him "ah, yeah, the Griffin building" "me too! Hey, maybe we're actually in the same room!"
"Well, I think she makes pretty good points" he said, "like the Salazar building. Did you know Salazar Slytherin was a white supremacist, and the school has a building named after him?"
Remus' tired eyes lit up and he smiled a kind smile.
"But that's-!"
"Well, I didn't realize being a part of this union depended on what company one keeps." Zabini said in his signature biting tone. "I thought this was a black students union. I'm a black student aren't I? And I experience racial discrimination just as much as any of you. Sadly enough my friendship with Draco is yet to rid me of that. As far as the Salazar building goes I might even have slightly more experience in that particular injustice seeing as I actually live there. But I guess it's for you to decide whether your union stands for all black students or just the ones whose friends you like."
"Why do you say that?" Harry asked.
"That's Draco Malfoy, son of Lucius Malfoy. Lucius is a major lobbyist for all kinds of right wing legislation. Their family has stocks in pretty much every large company in the country and they like to run things from the shadows. Did you know their family were some of the funding for the Salazar Slytherin statue? Disgusting. I wouldn't be surprised that they're white supremacists themselves with the kind of laws they promote. And who do you think is designated to take over the family's business of lobbying and investing after Malfoy senior? Draco is his father's most prized investment. He probably taught him all of his hateful ways, like silencing black activism. I can't give someone like that the time of day."
Growing up, his aunt and uncle always said nothing would come of him, and as much as he wanted to prove them wrong, after 18 years of hearing them belittle him every day, a part of him believed it too.
Harry only wanted Remus to say Sirius would have been proud of him, and he did. Harry knew it was true, but he still started crying because he wished Sirius would have been there to tell him that himself. He wished Sirius could see him starting law school, tell him he's a stud when he sees him hopelessly combing his hair to try to cover his burn scar and give him a ride to school on his motorbike. Sirius taught him everything he knows about being a man. Remus always had kind words and burning truths and painful realities and logic, and time, and consequences. But Sirius had brown eyes that sparked with mischief and a crooked smile that always let Harry know everything was alright, he stood up for Harry through thick and thin and although he stopped Harry from punching a kid who said "who's that tosser on the bike?" When he came to pick Harry up from school, when Harry said he broke his cousin Dudley's nose for calling him a poofer Sirius said well done and gave him a high five.
Remus had a sad smile on his face.
Hermione spoke in a sharp angry tone that Harry had barely heard from her before. Sometimes when she would get angry with Ron she used a somewhat harsh tone but nothing like this.
Small disclaimer: I don't really watch football and have never played so my description of the game may not come off very accurate. Feel free to leave comments regarding the game and how it could be better written.
Some of the new people Harry has gotten to know over the first couple of weeks of school come together in the first meeting of the black students association. Perhaps some unfamiliar faces may show up as well (finally).
"Harry, boy, you look just like your father, two drops of water you and him" Rubeus said. Harry had seen his father in the photos in Sirius' old room, so he knew Rubeus was right.
"No, Malfoy, we won't keep it down. This building is ours just as much as it is anyone else's, we are sitting in this building on purpose in order to claim this space. And we cannot close the door because we are expecting more people to arrive."
and Hermione…he couldn't do that to Harry, knowing that him and Weasley were so close, he didn't want it to seem like Harry needed to choose between them, that would just be unfair to him. Furthermore, if Draco ever wanted Weasley to
"Yes, quite a bit actually." Draco arrogantly crossed his arms in front of him. A mischievous gleam in his eye that Harry didn't get to see all that often. It was usually at times he was trying to prank him like that time Draco told him Snape was actually a famous ballerina in the supernatural world. Of course he had laughed it off and said
Draco felt himself deflate a bit, unwilling to worry his lover just because he had a bad day. He walked up to him and sat down on the couch, motioning for Harry to sit down as well.
Harry watched, frowning to himself. Draco crossed his arms, looking away again in a grimace.
"Taking the form of a giant spectral dog. It's among the darkest omens in our world. It's an omen...of death."
"Well... thank you. We'll just go..." Harry said nervously, trying to look for an exit.
Draco's breath hitched as the vampire's eyes met his, a dark black slowly filling in the forest green eyes as he stared him down. Draco craned his neck to the side, a natural reaction for a werewolf when facing someone much stronger and powerful than him. Draco figured it was a better option than the 'roll on back and show off belly' thing his wolf was doing in his mind. He didn't know how Harry would react to that.
. He always thought his crush was onesided and would always be that way, but when he felt those cold lips touch his…it felt like a whole new world opened up to him.
Still, why did he react like that? Sure, he found it comforting, being able to smell it as it was placed around the tables of the Great Hall. Had been salivating at the thought of trying to taste it, because why would it smell so good otherwise? He'd even stated it to Hermione as she tried to stop him, making her let go of his hand as he plunged a fork in the delicious looking dessert and bringing it to his mouth. He remembered both of his friends watching him closely, curious as to what he thought about it. Ron had even asked for his opinion, but had shrugged when he pulled a sour-looking face on. So why was he-?
going to apologize. He was going to see Malfoy stalking out of the Great Hall. Why was he talking to himself like that?
"Mr Slughorn we need your assistance."
! Stupid brainless, bloodsucking,
enemy with disbelief. Draco smiling at the annoyance written all over the redhead's face, before said redhead, proceeded to look up at the ceiling while letting out a loud groan of annoyance.
"I know what bloody stalking is, you wanker! Do you really think we would follow you and wait in front of a classroom just so we could catch you doing-" Ron stopped, closing his eyes and swallowing.
"Ron was here?"
"I think so." He answered unsurely.
where said
Mesmerizing…
"Mister Potter, we would never put someone off the team without a valid reason. About you being much faster than the other houses' seekers, thanks to your supernatural gifts, it can be easily taken care of. You just need to wear these shoes." Madame Hooch said calmly, pointing at the shoes that were in Harry's hands. Harry felt relief wash over him, but he still looked critically at the shoes.
With the post-orgasm bliss still fresh in his mind it was even harder not to; being able to quickly recall what happened not a second ago, the way Harry had sucked him. The pleasure and ecstasy it brought him that had completely overwhelmed him. Still able to feel that touch,
"Yes," Harry said, irritated already.
Draco closed his eyes all the while cursing Harry's denseness under his breath.
"Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane." Ron said happily again.
Harry patted his friends head as Ron whimpered. He knew they had been spending a lot of time together in the last couple of days, and he hadn't minded. He had been to busy with thinking about how he was starving, the plans for the upcoming Quidditch match with Slytherin, classes, avoiding certain people who were looking at him strangely…
He just didn't understand. Why would Hermione avoid him for so long? Was it because she realized he was not smart enough to be her friend? Not powerful enough? Did he make her upset enough for her to hate him? Did she found out about his love for her?
The last part Draco heard Lupin whispering to Longbottom.
"Time is of the essence, Ron. And I haven't even counted the arrangments you need to make and how much time that'll cost you. Not to forget that it will fill your whole thought progress with anticipation, leading you to be easily distracted." Hermione pointed out, tilting her chin upwards.
Harry stopped his thoughts, finally noticing that he'd moved towards the exit of the Great Hall, while others were partying or sulking.
"Not as horrible as you think," Harry said, ruffling with his necklace. He didn't exactly know if it would be okay with Draco if Harry told his friends about them. Wasn't even sure if Draco wanted to tell anyone. "It has actually been quite enjoyable."
"Incredible! Okay...to the back, Neville. Everyone, form a line. Form a line! I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny." Lupin said. Draco dashed towards the end of the line hoping the lesson would be over before he got a change.
The next morning, Harry was on his way to the Great Hall. He was still a bit sleepy, and nervous. He had said up the tryouts at four p.m and heard that Madam Hooch was going to attend all the houses tryouts. Harry brought his hand to his mouth as a yawn escaped him.
"I'm sorry I can't tell you." She said before lifting herself up and taking her plate with her.
Harry gasped, his fangs already lengthening.
Harry let his fangs slide down, remaining eye-contact with Draco as he did so. He could smell the werewolf's scent much closer now. The presence calming him down somewhat, making him more sure of himself before he opened his mouth, letting in all that red fluid that he'd been craving to have.
When Draco heard the sound of someone running through the woods, falling on Draco's territory while breathing very fast and hearing growling behind it, he shut off his mind again and started walking towards it.
It was however too late, Draco was already half hard and he kept thinking back to Harry and his beautiful forest green eyes and alluring scent.
"N-nothing, there's nothing wrong," Harry said blushing furiously and looked back down at his plate. But it was too late, Hermione had already noticed Harry staring at something behind her, and when she looked she saw Cho. She huffed and turned back around, with one raised eyebrow and a lopsided smile on her face.
He just hoped his lover would be able to put a smile on his face, though, he highly doubted it as he stomped through the corridor. Standing in front of the closed door, he looked at his ruined shirt for a moment.
"You'll not be going, I tell you! Uncle Vernon shouted. "We swore when we took him in we'd put a stop to all this rubbish!"
Suddenly all kinds of foods appear on the table. There were normal chicken wings, raw meat, insects, frogs and so on. It all appeared right in front of the creature that liked to eat it. But what shocked Harry was that before him a giant cup with what seems like…
that I didn't like to begin with!" Ron started yelling, making the rest of the room fall silent as some creatures slowly started packing their things.
"Have it your way. Juice?" Harry said calmly, handing him a goblet. Hermione blinked. Why was Harry being such a heartless prick?! She looked over at Ron who was surprised as well and mildly put out.
"It's late. It's nearly dark. You shouldn't be here. Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble. Particularly you and Hermione, Harry. After all, it is a full moon tonight. Quick. Quick!" Hagrid said spurring them on to leave the hut.
Hermione liked Ron. As in like-liked Ron. As in love-like Ron, or like-love Ron…was there even such a thing?
"He lies." The voice said again.
"Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention." McGonagall said.
"Therefore, it seems only fitting...
Draco rubbed his chin in frustration as he tried to figure this out. He could've sworn he'd seen disgust as one of his emotions flashing on and off of his face. But he could have mistaken since Harry wasn't making that much eye contact, so Draco couldn't be sure.
"A weapon?" Hagrid said. "Well, you'll want Ollivanders. No place better. Run along there and wait, I just got one more thing to do. Won't be long."
"An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape. Let's have a volunteer pair. Potter, Weasley, how about you?" Lockhart said.
'No.' Harry thought. 'No, this can't be happening.'
Harry calmed down, his eyes turning back to their original color. He looked over at the Dursleys', Vernon and Petunia were dashing towards the direction Marge was thrown and Dudley was on the ground, fainted.
But on the other side, Draco couldn't help but be curious and nervous. Because he
"This boy will be famous, there wouldn't be a child who doesn't know his name," McGonagall said.
"You know the solution then don't you."
"Mind if I take this? I do love knitting patterns." Dumbledore asked, admiring the magazine and smiling at it.
To all the other people it seemed like he was going to puke, they were cheering when they saw that Harry actually caught the snitch with his mouth.
"Go. Take it, you saved me!" Cedric yelled to Harry, but Harry didn't care about that.
"The first time of what?"
He had received a letter back -pretty fast thanks to Pig- he had found himself continuing to write letters to Hermione for the rest of the holidays and had enjoyed that she was writing him back.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco saw all of this happening. 'What a horrible thing to say! Even I'm not that mean!' He thought. 'Alright I probably am, but still!'
Which wasn't really their fault; they didn't know she was about to spill all of her hidden feelings to the other Gryffindor. But it happened so many times now that it was hard for Hermione to believe it was all just a
"My m-moment?" Lockhart stammered, smile fading.
Oh, yeah…golden eyes…
"We just wanted to say hi, so… hi!" A Hufflepuff girl said blushing, but all the while smiling at him.
"Yes, I like you! And you don't have to say anything. You don't have to answer me. I just hope we can still be fr-" Harry said before he felt soft lips pressing against him. He closed his eyes and quickly pulled an arm around Draco's waist, one hand moving its way upwards and placing itself on Draco's cheek as he pulled him closer.
Yep, that's what it was. He was just investigating. Nothing more.
"That's a lie! Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets!" The spider yelled.
She turned around as she numbly moved herself down the line.
"Yes, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't respect my wishes, even if they were cowardly!" She let her arms fall to the side, exasperated. "You don't see me saying that your blood is the only thing Harry can stomach! Who am I to give you guys falls hope of my speculation!"
Because Draco found, that that was exactly what he was doing, not so successfully might he add. Not that he had anything to say about it, he was sure he wouldn't be able to come up with
Hermione stood there looking at them disbelievingly, one hand on her hip while the other was lost in her hair. Her eyes wide and mouth hanging open until the scene in front of her registered into her brain. She quickly averted her eyes towards the door post, holding out her hands in front of her and shaking them really fast to calm her self down.
His eyes rolled back inside his head, body sweating.
"Hey, don't talk about yourself like that! You're not weak or stupid… okay, maybe when you thought I had willingly put my name in the cup BUT that doesn't matter. You've helped me in first year with that chess ability of yours, I couldn't have done without you, or that time with the spiders, or the troll and so many other things. You're maybe not so smart or good at magic but that hasn't stopped you, you are brave and Hermione knows that." Harry said fully convinced of what he just had said and hoped he'd also convinced his friend.
"No! You fucking tell me what's going on right now, no excuses or I sware-"
Draco watched him carefully, giving him one unimpressed lift of his eyebrow. It was an awkward position, his back leaning against the front of the couch as he sat on the ground, right in front of the coffee table -that was currently overflowed with books, paper, and ink as Draco used it as his own private desk- he had his knees up as he rested one of his notebooks on it, in one hand a pencile as he wrote some footnotes here and there and the other not really usable, thanks to Harry's arm draping across his shoulder, making it unable to move as the vampire cuddled him in his sleep. Of course, the turn of his neck in order to look at the vampire properly wasn't what they would call comfortable either.
'Crap.' Draco thought as he felt his composure slowly slipping away. He stared at Hermione with a fearful look. Sure he'd already guessed she had her suspicions thanks to the shirt, but hearing it come from her mouth made him afraid. How did she know? How did she found out? How could Draco have let her find out? Did she tell Harry? Did Harry knew and just ignore it?
"I want this thought erased from my head, Harry," Ron said, holding a hand over his stomach as he gagged.
Now don't think he was superficial, Harry was gorgeous on the outside for sure, but the inside was much like a piece of art. He was kind and decent, caring and considerate, always curious, honest, funny, brave, smart, loyal, humble and above all else so BLOODY OBLIVIOUS!
"What is it?" Harry asked looking straight at it.
Harry closed the door to his bedroom and let out a loud sigh as he leaned against the door.
They hadn't spoken of it much other than,
"As you guys know, I haven't eaten exactly well these last few months-"
"You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?" Hermione asked.
She wanted to tell him, she really did. She felt like a coward, a horrible friend for keeping silent. The logical part of her brain said she should man up and just tell him, she'd always told them everything so why couldn't she say those three simple words?
The golden trio was walking down the corridor after McGonagall's class.
"Ron we must go now." A lady said, probably his mother. The boy had a smile on his face when he walked over to his mother.
"I wouldn't be so judging, I mean you are the one with an inner creature that would love to drink the blood of these students," Hagrid said.
Hello :)
"Well, that was an excellent example for this, but if you don't mind me saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I wanted to stop you it would have been too easy." Lockhart said.
His blood was way better. Way purer. He was sure that if the vampire gave it a try, it would surely be superior to the other one. Why hadn't Harry asked to try his blood anyways? So what if he had fainted and almost got himself killed the first time. Didn't mean they couldn't try again! His father always said second time's the charm.
"Yeah, yeah. You're scared, I get it alright." Draco complained. He knew he was being a dick, but just like she'd said at lunch: it was a full moon, give him a break!
"I did?"
"Jesus Draco! Please stop sneaking up on me it's not good for my heart." Harry said, one hand on his heart as to prove his point.
He knew how to act, how to dress and how to speak in company of high officials. His parents made sure of that, especially when a promotion was at stake. He had lost count of the times his father had brought him aside just before leaving, telling him that he needed to behave nicely and not to bring shame on their family status by having one of his tantrums.
Harry, wanting to hug a wolf as well walked towards the beautiful white one, and when within reach, grabbed the wolfs' neck and started nuzzling it.
"S-stop it H-Harry," Draco laughed, making a weak attempt to push Harry off of him. "I thou-ught you wanted to ta-"
The first night he did this he wanted to free the bird after their little chat but it refused to go. Even when Draco was encouraging him to. It simply flew back to his cage, where the black one was waiting for him. It made his heart ache but also fill up.
Hadn't even felt remotely unprotected or endangered by the knife-like fangs or the blackened eyes, the way Harry had absolutely no self-control over his body anymore.
"Heh?"
"Okay, but still, you want to be my friend?" Harry asked, carefully and friendly.
"Don't worry, me too," Harry said, giving a reassuring smile. Draco pursed his lips confusedly, probably wanting to add something but before he could Harry had pressed his lips against Draco's. The werewolf melting into the kiss straight away.
"He will be fine,"
Harry held the weapon up with both of his hands, it was rather heavy and it didn't feel good in his hands.
Harry chuckled, looking back to how Draco's grimace had turned within a second into a sputtering mess, a deep red blush covering his entire face and neck to the point he kinda looked like a strawberry. His eyes practically bulging out of his sockets as he told Harry he would like that very much.
She smiled when he stopped, turning his face around as he said something to the guy. He lifted his eyebrows up in surprise when he noticed her, smiling and only turning away for a second so he could wave his acquaintances goodbye. She felt a familiar fuzzy feeling bubbling up as she took larger strides towards him. Her wolf buzzing with excitement at seeing her friend, even though it hadn't been that long since she last saw him.
Draco's breathing quickened as he was finally set free. Closing his eyes while feeling Harry's gentle fingers grip him and positioning him in a more comfortable angle. Draco let out a sigh of bliss as he felt a small kiss being laid on top of his glans. He was already quite used to the feel of Harry's mouth, knowing not to startle at the sudden coldness of his lips or the sudden wetness inside. Not like the first time, but he doubted Harry had noticed it then, or now for that matter.
by Medina Goldtand, her big mouse ears twitching every few seconds. Draco turned to the bookcases Harry had disappeared through.
"Dobby, come!" Lucius said, but Dobby didn't respond.
"Because there is no post on Sundays?" Harry said bitterly.
"Searching for my wand," He said, without a hitch.
"Of course I am upset," Draco sneered, "At least I'm not acting like I have been eating cockroaches for half a year."
When he moved to stand up but made a quick decision to flow some pumpkin juice into one if the vails he actually needed for potions.
He'd wanted to try this so badly. To turn the tables for a second and let him be on his knees. Being able to feel Harry's cock sliding into his mouth as he pumped himself over his lover's member. To hear the vampire groan for once instead of making them. He wanted to bring pleasure too! He just hadn't had a chance to. Always being stuck on the receiving end of the sucking motions –not that he was complaining- he never was able to voice his opinions on that matter to Harry. The words dying in his throat every time he saw the need in Harry's eyes.
Draco gasped at the warm fluid coated his insides. His wolf yipping on his hind legs, happy and content as Harry lowered them side by side.
Ron looked like he wanted to protest before his entire faced grumbled as he looked at something behind him, in contrary to Hermione; whose face seemed to light up. Pushing Harry aside as she ran towards the thing, or more like the person.
inside of her.
At that moment Harry and the white wolf heard more twigs snap. Harry was afraid Lupin had turned around and came back, but when he looked over at the bushes he saw a brown wolf coming out, the same length as the white wolf. The white wolf turned around and walked away from Harry and the brown wolf, leaving them alone.
"Sure," Ron snorted.
"What was that for?" He found himself asking, breathless as a smirk splayed itself on his own tingling lips. His hands –that were still holding onto Draco's backside- pushed his boyfriend further up. He opened his mouth in a silent moan when the werewolf in question pressed himself down even harder against his now hard prick.
(btw, Alice is just a made up person that is half spider)
Harry came to a halt at the birdcage that's always been on this floor, but normally there were supposed to be two birds in it, right? Harry held the cage seeing the blackbird ruffling its feathers but not the white one.
list. And at the time it didn't seem all that significant. She'd just have to figure it out by herself.
The blonde twisted on his side, their hands in between them. He looked up at Harry with a hopeful stare, not betraying any of the uncomfortableness he must be feeling. "Was I any good?"
"Sooo, what do you say?" Draco heard Potter ask.
"All she wants to do is snog me. Look. My lips are getting chapped." Ron complained and closed up to let Harry see what he was talking about.
Ron looked very relieved.
No one exactly knew what Neville was, they didn't really care, but they already could see this wasn't going to end well.
"He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. I mean it was only a dream right?" Harry asked starting to get worried.
“James,” he got out finally, “I’m James. It’s nice to meet you.” Malfoy’s grin widened and he used their joined hands to pull Harry in close.
“Here we are.” Draco broke the silence and motioned towards his flat as they approached. Harry eyed the building curiously.
“Sometimes I feel like I can’t handle anything.” It sounded as though Harry was telling him a secret he didn’t even know he had.
Fear not, for it is I who picks up the pieces.
“That won’t be necessary,” Draco sniffed, his snark returning slightly. “I may not remember much, but I can take care of myself.”
“Your flat smells like a bakery.” Harry inhaled deeply, “and… is that lavender?”
Draco would come back, Harry was sure of it. He dawdled around the kitchen, cleaning up the mugs and fixing himself a small breakfast of beans on toast. Confronting an angry Draco on an empty stomach wasn’t his idea of a fun time.
“Thanks, Gin. Have fun tonight.” He turned towards the door as she waved him out, humming quietly to herself. She had a point, he knew she did. Maybe he wouldn’t wear the Glamour. Maybe he would dance. Maybe he would talk to Malfoy… there were a lot of maybes, and he had no idea which direction he was going to go.
They told me that he deserved the same fate as his father.
“Blanket. The floor.” He tapped the floor with his feet. “My glasses, they’re touching my face.” Hesitantly, he reached out and felt around blindly before gripping Draco’s hand. “You.” The colour had begun to return to his face, and Draco felt a rush of warmth. It was actually working!
“Harry… is that
“Monday through Saturday!” Draco replied, smiling at his sleep-rumpled boyfriend. It had taken Draco years to become a morning person, and now he revelled in it. He put some coffee on to percolate before placing his wand in the receptacle and stealing into the back room. Flipping on the ovens, he glanced around at his immaculate kitchen, reveling in the fact that this was
Draco smirked. “Enjoy your wank?” He asked, nudging a cup of tea towards Harry.
“Nothing, really?” Draco sounded surprised.
Draco was safe, and my heart soared.
He lost track of time as he stared into the fire, thinking about the could-have-beens. He didn’t remember falling asleep, and he didn’t remember Draco stealing down to cover him with a blanket as he slept.
“Opening week is very important, after all,” Luna mused, twirling a strand of hair between her fingers, “and we have a lot of ideas to discuss!” Draco nodded and half-listened while she was happily chattering about different flavors of muffins and possibly expanding into a full breakfast and lunch area. He turned down that idea, stating that it was entirely too early to be expanding anything, but let his mind drift as she was explaining how she could use the coffee grounds as fertilizer for the garden out back. He kept thinking about Potter and how he was holed up in his flat without family, only getting visits a few times a week from the same people. Then again, he didn’t know if Potter had any other friends, and it was entirely possible that he was having people over every day. Doubtful, he thought, from how the others were talking.
“So waking up this morning was out of the ordinary?”
“How long have we been together?”
The ferret leapt off of him and onto the back of the couch, baring his little ferret teeth at Harry, before scampering off to Merlin knows where.
“Harry.” Draco said slowly. “You absolute tosser. Who did you think I was talking about?”
“Here’s your London Fog, Ms. Benson!” Draco flashed a bright smile at the elderly witch, handing over the mint green takeaway cup. She had been his first official customer on opening day, and had continued to come every morning that week before work. “Thanks for stopping by the cafe today! I hope your husband is well.”
Coward. Couldn’t even show his face.
“Take me to your room. Maybe it’ll help me remember.”
Harry stared. He had no idea Draco knew so much about St. Mungo’s scheduling and training. “Yeah, a bit.” He sat down and tucked into his food, not waiting to see what the other two did. “I could be doing overnights, though. I may be coming in when you’re going to work.”
“Well, James, first things first, I know you’re a wizard.” The eye contact still hadn’t been broken, and Harry felt incredibly overwhelmed. “The magic you exude is extremely powerful, especially around so many non-magical beings.” Malfoy closed his eyes and leaned closer, his breath ghosting over Harry’s ear, making him shiver. “Second thing… I saw you last Friday watching me. I saw you run away. And I can
“Which Weasley, specifically?” Harry prodded, flipping to a fresh page on the medical chart. “There are seven Weasley siblings. Which one was that?”
“No, it was brilliant.” Draco answered honestly, grabbing his rag and beginning to wipe down the counters. They worked quietly; Draco had full confidence in Harry to get the scones prepped and didn’t need to babysit him in the least, which allowed him to deep clean the coffee carafes and other machines around the kitchen.
The Five Senses exercise Draco does is the same as the one he helps Harry through in Chapter 6 - 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste
“I dreamed of it!” Luna turned and her large, blue-grey eyes stared into his silver ones. “It’s such a good idea, Draco. There’s not a good coffee shop in Diagon Alley, and all you do is stay at home…” she trailed off, looking serene even as Draco’s face hardened and the Malfoy Mask attempted to come to the surface. He felt it and did his best to relax - that wasn’t him anymore. It was 2004, for Merlin’s sake. The war was over, he had made his peace, he even had friends… okay, maybe acquaintances via Luna, but it was still more than he could have ever hoped for six years ago. No one outwardly hated him anymore, and that was as good as he could have wanted it.
“I’m Alyce,” she smiled. “I expect we’ll be seeing you Fridays from now on?” Harry barked out a laugh.
“What I want to hear is that you’re healthy and well,” Harry stood abruptly. “I’m going to have to tell Ron that you aren’t fit to work. I can have Blaise take you home with him, since he and Pansy are still listed as your emergency contacts and they can watch over you, or you can be released and come back to our home and I can have our friends drop in on you to check up on you.”
“More than likely.” He admitted, though he wasn’t completely sure. “I’m… James.” He took Alyce’s hand and shook it. Using his middle name had come easily for him on cases where he had to go undercover, and he decided to remain as anonymous as he could. He made a mental note to create a Glamour that looked relatively close to his actual face so that Alyce would be able to recognize him if he came again. Darken his eyes, remove the scar completely - sure it was hidden under his fringe now but if he wanted to remain incognito then he’d have to cover it up.
What didn’t make sense was Malfoy sliding up right next to Harry, bumping arms, and smiling at Alyce.
“Seems a bit unprofessional, living with your patient.” Draco crossed his arms and looked pointedly away from Harry. “I don’t think you know what you’re talking about.”
Heart pounding, Draco leapt from the couch, wand clutched in his hand, and sprinted to the bedroom door. It was still only just ajar, and he pushed the door fully open, wand at the ready. His eyes swept the room, ready to cast a hex or a Protego, depending on what he found.
to know rule three?”
Not all of them were nice, but then again, there were some jerks during the week too. Today, he had a lady who nearly threw her coffee in his face when he informed her, regrettably, that he had just sold the last of the pumpkin scones. The other customers more than made up for it, however; each of them wished him happy birthday and a few even chastised him for being at work. Being the only person manning the front line was laborious, but he managed well enough. He knew that, besides Luna, his friends wouldn’t be in today because they were at his flat preparing for the not-so-surprise party. He served with a smile, and was nearly sold out of all the scones by the end of his workday.
“I told him I wouldn’t be going with him.” Draco said calmly, picking up his tea and sipping it. “He told me I was being foolish, and that he and Violet could take care of me better than you could.”
“Yes, hello to you, Blaise.” Draco parroted, and Harry knew that he had picked up on Blaise’s name thanks to his own greeting. “I’m up. I’m awake. And I want tea.”
“I expect it won’t be difficult. We do have magic, after all!” Luna waved her wand through the air, drawing out a leafy wreath with the text “Lovegood Cafe+Arabica” in the center. “Looks good, doesn’t it?” With that, Draco acquiesced and they put their heads together to change the idea into a reality.
The Invisibility Cloak has been a key component, obviously - if I cast my own Disillusionment charm, my signature would be all over.
“You chose them,” Harry shrugged. “You said that purple is the color of royalty.”
Harry spluttered, choking on the last of his coffee. “Luna,” he said uneasily, “I don’t know if that’s such a good idea… I mean, you literally just accused me of distracting Draco, how would it be if I was here all the time?”
“Sounds like a plan. We can all let go a little.” He glanced over at Harry, who was still standing in the doorway to the kitchen, looking out of place. “Potter,” he gestured, “Come and have a drink.” Harry hesitated and took a few tentative steps into the kitchen before Hermione stalked over and engulfed him in a bone-crushing hug.
Fuck.
“Potter.”
“‘I have to clean up Sirius’ bedroom’,” Ron mimicked Harry almost perfectly, “‘No, really Ron, go on without me. If I get done early, I’ll catch up with you all.’ Never does, mind you. We’ve all but given up on inviting him places. He just doesn’t want to go.”
“Today is not the day.” Draco said firmly, leading him back into the kitchen. “It is my 24th birthday, and I can think of nothing better to do than hang out in my kitchen and drink with my arch nemesis.” He arched his eyebrow and handed Harry a new drink, inclining his own in another toast. “To new beginnings, and not killing each other.” Their glasses clinked and their eyes met. “On trinque?” Harry looked confused, and Draco chuckled. “Shall we drink?” He reiterated in English.
Draco looked at the clock, noting that it was ten minutes past closing as he went to lock the door behind Ethan. He didn’t make it further than that before Harry was right behind him, arms encircling his waist. “You said you loved me,” he mumbled into Draco’s neck, and Draco flushed. He had said that, hadn’t he?
“Imagine that.” Harry’s throat was tight. He took another drink of his Firewhiskey, coughing as the spicy liquid hit his tongue.
Dressing quickly in a t-shirt, fresh pants, and a pair of joggers, Harry slipped out of his room and down the hall. As he reached Draco’s room, he saw the door was ajar and Draco was nowhere to be seen. Swearing under his breath, he slipped into the room and snatched his glasses from the bedside table, hurriedly putting them on. He noticed Draco’s night clothes in a pile by the bed, and thought he heard noises coming from the kitchen.
“You think he’s willing to settle down with the Wizarding World’s Golden Boy?” Blaise placed a finger on Harry’s shoulder and gave him a sharp push. “You think that what you have to offer Draco is better than what we have to offer; that is to say, the life he deserves and wants to live? You live in a moldy old rundown house that could do with a few centuries worth of cleaning charms. He deserves to live in high class society, not to shack up with the washed up boy wonder.”
"There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid." Potter said.
"H-heat?" Ron stammered.
"Dear students, there is no need to worry. There has been no deadly illness spreading, not some horrible form of diarrhea, nor a last-minute sale of the latest 'Rubby O' Chicken'." Dumbledore said, his tone serious. "I would like you all to keep calm, as well as ask you to leave the students, that had just run out off the Hall, alone. The reason they have run off is private and will not be discussed any further. Now, without furder ado please go back to your classes."
'How am I supposed to act around Draco now?'
"I promise you, Harry, that this time we'll keep in touch with you, again sorry 'bout that mate," Ron said making Harry feel a bit more secure. It was always hell with the Dursleys but last year had been extra hard especially since his best friends hadn't sent him any letters.
"Oh. Well, that's…strange, at least for her." Harry said, frowning. He couldn't recall a single moment when she'd ever squeaked in their presence before.
"Except for you mister Malfoy."
"Oculus Reparo," Ron said. The glasses, which noseband was battered, got fixed.
'O God, please don't let it be something severe!' Harry thought as unfamiliar panic seized him. But it all faded away as he saw a blond-haired boy in Slytherin robes walk towards a spot at the Slytherin table. He sat down and started his meal without looking up and meeting Harry's eyes, his face seemed annoyed.
Draco couldn't even say what he wanted to say before his father interrupted him.
"We have been looking all over for you," Crabbe asked.
Dammit.
"Just the man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come at last." Snape said in his indifferent voice.
When it stopped Harry took a deep breath.
What was he doing?! This was crazy, he shouldn't invade Draco's privacy like that!
"Oh bugger," Ron shivered, head falling against her shoulder as she cupped his stiffening member. He stopped his travelling mouth in favour of moaning up into her ear, encouraging her.
Still, some part of Draco, the part that had been so easy to forgive Harry, the part that loved him so deeply, the part that had driven him nuts on more than one occasion… hadn't felt scared at all. Had been in awe as the dangerous vampire loomed over him. Threatening him.
He felt his face heat up under the scrutiny of Harry's stare. The way he bit his lip shyly and self-consciously making Draco's heart speed up at a ridiculous pace. And wasn't that the stupidest thing of them all? That he still felt those traitorous butterflies dancing in the pit of his stomach at the thought of Harry looking at him like he was now? Shouldn't he be used to this ever seeing that expression every day for over a week? Shouldn't he be happy that his prayers had been answered? That Harry was finally willing to touch him in that way?
