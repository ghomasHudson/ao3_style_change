"May I intruduce for the first time ever," the singer on the stage said after the song had finished, "Mr and Mr Potter."
Sudden panic rushed over Harry. Where was Malfoy, this idiot? He watched Cedric, Fleur and Krum pushing past the others towards McGonnagal and Harry even thought of asking Parkinson, where Draco was, as he looked to the stairs.
"Shush." Harry said.
"Do you really want to see it?", Potter asked and Draco nodded.
Harry got up and tried to pull Malfoy off the stool, but he grabbed the bar.
"So what? Are you going to go?"
"In future, we can do this every day.", he said.
"Goodnight, Malfoy.", Harry said quietly.
"Hey, tiny man." He whispered softly, "Are you ready for your first new year's eve?"
"No, no, they came on their brooms." Bill said.
"He was my godfather.", he said and dried his tears.
Malfoy laughed as he read the text.
Ron opened the door to the Three Broomsticks and the eight friends stepped in.
"Draco, what does it cost? One thousand Galleons?", Harry asked and Draco looked at the price shield.
"Harry. Talk to me.", Draco said and looked at Harry with big, steal grey eyes.
Harry could hear books being dropped to the stone floor not far away.
"After you." Theo said, putting the newspaper on the table between them, "Around three in the morning maybe."
?", she asked.
"I was raised by my aunt and uncle." Potter finally said, "Muggles. They hate wizards and therefore hated me."
"Harry wants to see you.", the other boy
"Is this-" Ron whispered and pointed at the wall. "Blood. Yessss," Malfoy said and showed them his hands.
"Yes, any minute now."
Ron was right. Things with Malfoy were definitely moving into that direction where Harry would eventually have to face his mother.
"But he had to do it." Present-Harry would probably say.
After breakfast, Harry and Draco changed into their clothes, in separate rooms of course, and went back outside with their brooms in their hands. Draco still had his Nimbus 2001, the one his father had bought for the whole Slytherin Quidditch team in second year, after Harry had gotten the older model in first year. Harry was proud and a bit melancholic as he held on to his Firebolt, a gift by Sirius. Harry didn't want to get a new broom - it was still one of the best ones in the world and one of the few things he still had from Sirius.
"Where are you going?" Potter asked.
"Bye Weasley.", he said and let go of Ron's hand. Harry smiled.
Draco wrinkled his nose and Harry grinned. He dragged him down the street while Draco sipped his whiskey.
Harry realised this wasn't familiar at all. This
Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Seamus joined them on their way down into the Great Hall. As they walked in, already many people were chatting and eating. Including Draco. Harry looked at him, but he didn't notice Harry, because his gaze was fixed on his cereal. The Gryffindors sat down at their table and Ron started eating immediately. Harry laughed and took something himself. Every now and then, he looked up to check on Draco. Draco looked up at the same time and their eyes met. Harry smiled and Draco wiggled his eyebrows and smirked, what made Harry blush very, very hard and he smiled even wider. Draco laughed and continued eating.
It was quiet for a while, then Lucius stood up. Harry pulled his head back hastily, hoping not to be seen. As Mr Malfoy spoke again, he looked in.
"Pork chops"
"You really slept there?", he asked and pressed back a laugh. Draco rolled his eyes and snorted.
"I don't know. Maybe I'll wait for you in front of the Great Hall?", Harry suggested and Draco nodded.
"Sirius? Sirius Black?"
Potter rolled his eyes. "No Malfoy, seriously."
"I will." Malfoy said, mounting his own broom.
He knocked three times and waited.
Harry sat down on his bed and listened to the sound of the shower while looking out of the window. Malfoy didn't make it easy for Harry to like him. Harry desperately tried to win sympathy from Malfoy but all of his attempts banged against a wall - a wall Malfoy had built around himself.
", Harry thought and he quickly thought of something to say.
"Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you," he said.
Malfoy didn't answer. He looked back at his hands with an ashamed look on his face. Harry smiled sadly at the confused boy in front of him. How could his family have messed him up this much?
"Alright." Harry said and nodded.
Now, he wasn't in there, so they had the room for them alone. They sat down on Ron's bed and Hermione looked expectantly at Harry, who felt strangely nervous. He breathed out and closed his eyes, practicing what he could say next.
Mr Weasley had made it his personal job to walk around with a bottle of mulled wine and fill everyone's mugs (except for Fleur's). Bill and Charlie were in charge of the bonfire while Ron and George put the fireworks in position. Harry had an exciting feeling in his chest when he watched everyone do their part to make this night the most awesome new year's eve ever. With every half an hour closer to midnight, Harry noticed an increase of tension in the air. Looking into the night, snowflakes slowly settling in Harry's hair, he smiled and closed his eyes. Hermione stepped next to him. Harry looked at her for a second and when she closed her eyes as well, he did too.
"I always knew you had it in you.", Draco said proudly.
Harry looked back up and nodded. "Yeah, I'm fine. Where is his mother?" Harry suddenly asked.
The others grinned. Potter grabbed Draco's free hand and his green eyes sparkled behind his glasses in the light of the fire. Draco couldn't believe he had fallen in love with these green eyes. They talked and laughed for quite a while and it was the best Christmas day Draco had ever had - he almost didn't want it to end. But he was excited about what would happen next.
"Yes, Potty-baby?", Draco asked and looked at Harry.
"Oh, hi." He said surprised.
"So...", he started and suddenly he noticed that getting in conversation with Draco was far easier than with Ginny and it had nothing to do with their breakup, because Harry and Draco had
"You are not weak, Harry.
But Potter's face said something completely different. He actually looked sad. Potter was silent for a while and Draco couldn't believe that he'd actually hurt Potter even though this time he didn't really want to.
They ate mostly in silence because no one knew what to talk about.
"In don't know, Mrs Malfoy. I should probably just go home." Harry answered.
He didn't know why.
Harry walked over to her and sat down in a comfortable chair on the other side of her desk. McGonnagal closed the book she was reading and shoved it aside.
"Not important.", Harry said and turned back to the window.
"Don't pretend it's such a loss for you. We don't even talk outside of this room," Potter said. Draco could see the hurt in his eyes and hugged him.
When Harry and Ron landed at The Burrow, Hermione and Ginny already stood outside and waited for them. Ginny smiled and hugged her brother, then Harry. Harry was very grateful for her friendly behavior even though she sort of knew about what had been between him and Malfoy.
It was really nice seeing everyone again and talking to them. And what Harry appreciated very much was that the band wasn't too loud so you could understand every word your opponent was saying.
Draco turned around to look at Potter, who smiled from one ear to another and looked happier than ever. Draco hasn't seen Potter happy in a very long time. And if so, it was
"I know." Harry said more calmly too, "But I also know it's hard enough for him, even without you making him feel guilty."
"What's wrong, mate?" Ron asked and Harry shrugged.
are freaks." Draco said and was shocked to see that when Potter looked up at him he had tears in his eyes. "Not having magical powers.
"Well open it then."
"I'll miss you. But I'll write. Promise." Draco said.
Harry thought,
"Really?" Harry looked at himself in the mirror, "I think it's too formal."
"So... it's a yes?", Potter asked and looked at Draco with big eyes. Draco kissed him on the tip of his nose.
"Good." She folded her hands in her lap, "But if you touch him without his consent, if you say or do, or if you let anyone say or do anything to hurt him, I will torture you and that person and I will make your life miserable. I would do anything to protect him, you know that."
And she stormed back out of the library. Harry and Ron looked at each other and Ron shrugged. Harry smiled awkwardly at Madame Pince and the two boys followed Hermione. In the corridor, Luna and Neville passed their way and walked with Ron and Harry.
"He says that you need me and that I shouldn't let you go.", Harry told Draco, who looked at him in disbelief.
"Thanks. So are you.", he answered and shrugged. Draco laughed.
"Wha-", before Draco could ask what was wrong, a chilly air made him freeze in horror.
"Like Draco wouldn't have been if it hadn't been for bis father." Harry thought out loud and Hermione nodded while Ron furrowed his brow.
He asked Hermione to sit down and stop being so worried. She tried her best. Harry sat there for two minutes when Neville asked him if they could talk. Privately. Harry nodded and he felt excitement spreading through his body again. Finally he could tell someone.
"I love you, Malfoy, because even though we have been through a lot of hate, you found the strength in your heart to forgive and start to love. You make me happier than I ever imagined I could be. You make me proud I promise I will make you just as proud. I vow to listen to everything you have to say, I vow to be there for you and I vow to trust you and respect you. We've been though all of this and yet here we stand, face to face, holding hand. "
Harry nodded hardly. "I do."
"Just a few minutes ago." Ron answered.
"And always so modest.", he said, "But I meant it."
Harry laughed and rolled his eyes, but Malfoy didn't seem to think it was that funny. He grunted and followed Harry. No matter how much Draco wanted Harry's friends to like him, Harry knew that it took Draco a lot to like them back.
"Writing," Malfoy said.
"You were attacking my room mate.", he said suddenly stern. The boys froze.
They couldn't fly, of course, because Draco wasn't allowed to be on a broom for weeks. Also they weren't going over the Floo Network as well, because Draco wanted to go somewhere that wasn't connected to the Network. Apparating was too dangerous for Draco as well. So - to both their displeasure - they had no other choice but to take Muggle transportation.
"Potter, we were fucking!", he said and rolled his eyes. Potter slided back an inch.
After a long time, Potter came back, as Draco finished his charms homework. He wasn't too pleased.
Hermione nodded. "What did you say?"
"I have never seen you here. What year are you in?" He asked.
Draco laughed. There was only one way of finding out if Potter liked him or not. Draco took all his courage and leaned forward. He could see Potter's surprised expression just before their lips lightly touched. Draco pulled away again. This time it was Draco who licked his lips. Potter grabbed Draco's face, leaned forward and kissed him again. He leaned down, so he lay on top of Draco, his legs on each side of Draco's hip.
"Nothing, nothing," Harry said hastily. He knew better than to pick a fight with Malfoy.
he was sulking. So Draco grabbed his wand, smelled the air and cast a spell. A second later steak, plate and knife and fork floated through his opened window right onto his table. Draco smiled satisfied and sat down to eat when someone knocked on his door.
, so they filled him in. Draco was so ashamed when he heard what he had done - cried on Longbottom's neck, threw up on Weasley's socks, pulled off his shirt in front of them and told them how much he loved Potter and how much he missed him.
"Why did you sent Malfoy to the pub yesterday?" Harry asked.
"Shut up, Pansy.", he said.
"Then come with me.", Draco answered and smiled questioning. Potter smiled and shook his head.
Potter smiled and kissed Draco, who stood up to shower.
"I owe you one, too, then.", Draco said, pleased to find he could talk and answer Potter's kisses at the same time.
"The first one is from when you started going to Hogwarts," Malfoy said and helped Harry lift every other newspaper, so he could pull out the very first one.
Harry smiled to himself and made his way to Ron's room, which he shared with a Hufflepuff. Harry knocked at the door.
"Hold on."
They all shushed him at the same time. "Be quiet!" Harry hissed.
They sat and played with Teddy the whole day, something that Harry appreciated very much and that showed what a good friend Ron was.
Hermione, on the other hand, seemed less enthusiastic, so Ron asked what was wrong.
"Hermione-", Harry said, but she rounded a corner and vanished.
"Is Potter stable enough?" Minerva asked back and Pomfrey nodded. "Good. Then let Malfoy stay."
Saying nothing, Draco kept his arms where they were, resisting Potter's attempts to free himself. Potter must have thought him insane and Draco couldn't blame him, but Potter couldn't leave now.
"Hi." She said, "I'm Anna. How can I help you?"
"Oh Merlin!" Ron said, Ginny put a hand on her mouth and Hermione gasped when they saw what was going on.
After a long time Draco rolled to his side. He couldn't sleep.
Harry started sweting.
not the person I really wanted. And I knew that. Every time we kissed, it didn't feel as good..."
Potter huffed as though he was suffocating and pulled away. Draco was soothed in a moment, however, when Potter slipped off him and rolled to his side, pulling Draco with him, so they ended up facing each other again.
"Malfoy?" Potter asked unsure and sounded nervous.
"I don't know why either. He was
"No, you're not.", Potter insisted.
Harry didn't know what to say. He looked back at the picture and smiled. This picture that caused so many hate. But Narcissa Malfoy managed it to make this picture the most wonderful thing on earth.
Malfoy shrugged.
He pressed his bulge against Potter's. When Potter felt that Draco was
Ron shoved him away and gave Hermione a last kiss. "We'll see each other soon." He said when she didn't want to let go of his hands.
"Draco Malfoy." Harry said hastily to the woman at the front desk.
"I'll leave you to you class then," Harry said.
Draco bent over and kissed Potter hardly. Potter still had his tea in his hand and spilled it all over Draco's pants.
"There you are." Seamus said and laughed.
Harry smiled. Suddenly, Malfoy got up, wrapped his arms around Harry's waist and kissed him. Harry didn't know what that was for, but he enjoyed it. He grabbed Malfoy's butt and kissed him back intensely. Draco broke away and his grey eyes sparkled. He smiled.
Ron looked up, his mouth full with meat and shook his head grinning. Harry laughed.
"Tell us Harry, how was your birthday so far?" Luna asked, smiling across the table.
Then they all grabbed a Coke and walked back to the garden, where Ron put up his chess board and Harry sat down with him to play.
Harry nodded. Then shook his head. What was the point of lying when they could clearly see that he wasn't alright. It became easier to breathe again and Harry buried his face in his hands. He felt Hermione comfortingly rubbing her hand over his back and he looked up again.
Christmas holidays were about to begin tomorrow. Harry had not kissed Draco, nor did they wank off each other in the last one and a half week.
"No. You know what, Potter? You're an asshole! You could never know how I feel. I have never had anyone before. Not one girl and especially no boy. I was raised in a very strict house. I wasn't and I'm still not allowed to have
Kreacher came back home when they both already were in bed. Draco snuggled closer to Potter, who already slept peacefully.
Draco scowled at the page. Ron, Seamus, Dean and Neville sat on Ron's and Dean's bed and watched Harry and Draco curiously. Harry looked at Draco.
Slap.
Vernon didn't seem too grateful to hear these words, and shook Draco's hand rather grimly.
"Sounds like your years at school. Things happened that never happened before since you were there.", Draco said to Potter and laughed.
"What?" Ron asked as if he hadn't understood, and as Draco repeated it, Ron's jaw dropped but he immediately closed his mouth again and cleared his throat.
The death of Draco's father had been the hardest on Narcissa. Since then she'd never left the house, she only spoke to a few people and whenever Draco came over she seemed less and less happy. Today was such a day. Theo and Pansy have agreed to join Draco for a visit.
"Well, come on then.", Dean said and they continued their little war.
"You like me," Draco said.
This was how Potter must have felt all the time when Draco talked bad about his parents. Draco's knees somehow felt weak and he broke to the floor. Potter stood there and Draco felt ashamed.
Ron nodded.
"Oh, yes. He'll absolutely love it."
"Just me.", Potter gritted out, and there was something fierce about it.
Malfoy furrowed his brow and Harry suggested they sat down. So they sat across from each other on Harry's bed.
"Why?" Pansy asked with a confused look.
father.
"Thank you, Mrs Malfoy.", he smiled.
Seamus came running into the kitchen, where Ron and Harry cooked dinner. Harry turned around and furrowed his brow. Seamus had his ringing cellphone in his right hand.
Harry had the whole day a strange feeling and didn't feel right. Something important was missing, although Harry couldn't figure out what it was.
"Okay?" Draco replied confused and raised his eyebrows.
"Aha, so he
Harry now thought of something that might make Malfoy feel better.
It was normal between them... although you could not possibly call it
He shuffled behind her and Ron into the living room where only one glass of lemonade stood on the table and half a bowl of popcorn. Harry realized that the room didn't give away that Malfoy had even been there. Ron made himself some tea and joined Hermione and Harry on the couch, Harry sitting where Malfoy had sat just an hour ago.
"He didn't want to see you.", Parkinson said, but Harry didn't believe her immediately, and Zabini slapped her on the shoulder.
Harry nodded wordlessly, so did Draco. They made their way over the greens and sat down under a big tree. Harry would have never thought Draco to be someone who sat in the grass, but they sat in the shadow of the tree for a while and talked, until it got chilly and Harry slightly started to shiver.
This was the second time Draco apologised to Harry, and really meant it. For Harry, it was such a big deal. He cleared his throat.
"Morning.", Harry said. Malfoy turned his head, looked at him and looked back to the window.
Then he stopped. Four confused faces were staring at Harry and Malfoy with open mouths and wide eyes.
"That's one of the four houses of Hogwarts. In Slytherin are the cunning and ambitious ones.", Harry explained.
He dropped his wand and threw himself towards Potter. Matt did the same thing.
"Yes you are." Harry said, "You're not making any sense!"
"It kind of... broke.", Harry said and didn't want to deepen the question
A picture of the three was beneath the article and Draco pinched the bridge of his nose with his thumb and index finger. This was a disaster. He hoped his parents weren't going to read the paper this day. He hoped the mail would've gotten lost or they would've gotten blind or anything that made them
"Wait a minute, you can do that?" Potter joked, but when Draco gave him a stern look he kept quiet.
She flipped the page. In the next picture was Narcissa herself, Draco in her arm. They both smiled, so did Harry. Draco was so cute when he was a child.
"Well, bye.", Potter said and stood up. He waited with his hand on the door knob. Draco looked up.
"Four days.", Hermione answered with a sad smile.
"Really, it's no problem I would love to take anything off your hands. Malfoy or preparations, I don't care." Harry said.
"Yes, you should go." Nott agreed.
This was the most beautiful article Draco has ever read about Potter. It was so sincere and kind and- just perfect. Draco really needed to see Potter now. Before that, Draco walked into their dorm and put the newspaper in the box. Before he closed it, he had a look at the headline again and smiled.
"What-"
Draco looked up at him and shot him an annoyed look.
"You know, that we are going to the ball together?"
"Will you even survive it?", Blaise asked laughing. Draco rolled his eyes and grabbed Potter's hand.
"Oh, you mean if I read the article about your heartfelt speech and dark secret? I did." Malfoy grinned.
Harry nodded slowly. He wasn't sure if he wanted to do something with Malfoy if he would have to get rid of Ron every time, just to they wouldn't fight. But on the other hand, Harry too had been like that not long ago.
He lay there, feeling full of more emotions than he had words for, until he heard the rustle of skirts and opened his eyes slowly. He suddenly remembered that they were still in the hospital and froze.
"No... I mean yes, it is, but it's not.", he said. Narcissa's brow furrowed.
"Shall I throw him out?" Poppy asked.
Malfoy smiled. He smiled! And then, he flushed. His pale cheeks reddened and he looked more than adorable. Harry's heart skipped a beat. "You're so cheesy" Malfoy said and Harry laughed. His laugh made Malfoy's smile even bigger.
Harry caught up with him and the two boys walked side by side down the street.
"Fine. I'm totally fine.", he answered.
The sun was already shining brightly and the birds outside were singing loudly. Harry took a deep, satisfied breath and closed his eyes again for a moment - just to let this beautiful moment sink in before it would end. And it would end, because Harry shifted slightly, so he could look at Malfoy without turning his head in an uncomfortable position. Malfoy made a sleepy grunting noise and slightly rubbed his head against Harry's shoulder, so Harry could feel the soft blond hair against his cheek. And then Malfoy finally opened his eyes - at first very slowly and tiredly. Then Malfoy closed his eyes again and when he tried to rub them with his hand, he opened them again widely and stared at his one hand in Harry's and his other hand gripping Harry's arm.
Ron sat on the circular table in the living room surrounded by quills and parchment and pictures. Harry joined him.
"But still." Hermione cut him off.
"I thought I could trust that you wouldn't behave like this." Harry replied, his own voice getting louder too, "But obviously I can't."
"Before you open it, I beg you not to say
"What in Merlin's name is this?" Theo asked.
"What, you need three hours?", said Ron.
"No, thanks, Malfoy.", Ron answered and shrugged at Hermione.
"Yes."
With the pyjama in his hand, Harry walked over to the bathroom and Malfoy looked up.
Draco and Potter stood there in boxer shorts and looked at the broken table with their hands stemmed in their hips.
"Are you trying to cheer me up?" Potter asked mockingly.
Fully dressed and still laughing, they went outside where Ron was already waiting for them with a disturbed look on his face, what made Harry and Draco laugh even more. Since the party wasn't visited mainly by wizards, they couldn't arrive in the fireplace, so they took their brooms and made their way through the dark, starry night. Fortunately, it wasn't snowing as much, so the flight was really nice though Harry's hand were freezing when they landed.
"I have, if you're referring to the article about me being in the hospital," Harry said.
"Ferret!", Potter called as he danced into their room. Draco looked up as he closed his trunk and smiled.
"You know the prefect's bathroom on fifth floor?", Cedric asked and Harry nodded.
"Expecto Patronum."
So they would sit and drink and Hermione and her mother would laugh together and talk. Harry smiled and nodded.
After half an hour of flying around and enjoying the feeling - Hermione didn't - they touched back down on the ground in the middle of London. The pub that Hermione and Ron have rented was already filled with people, but just crowded enough for Harry to be comfortable.
Hermione nodded and Harry almost couldn't stand the pitiful look on her face.
He stood up slowly, ignoring the blood shooting in his brain. He took a quick cold shower and stumbled out of the room.
"Also, I would like you to welcome our guests Ronald Weasley-" the pupils broke out in cheers, "and Harry Potter!" The cheers and screams intensified at the sound of Harry's name.
Ron was taken aback. He looked at Harry with big eyes. Parvati had heard enough now, and stood up.
"Do you have everything?", Potter asked and kissed him on the cheek.
"I'm pretty sure, you're not sleeping.", Seamus said.
"I could ask you the same question," Draco replied with narrowed eyes.
"How can you expect me to sit here with this Death Eater and pretend nothing ever happened?" Ron asked loudly.
Harry nodded. "I am."
A branch being blown against the window woke Harry up again. The room was dark now, only the moon shining through the windows illuminated the edges of the furniture. Harry yawned and stretched. When he tried to sit up, his back ached and his tummy turned upside down. He hoped not to vomit again. He realised he had left Hogwarts just like that - without telling McGonnagal, without asking for permission. He hoped Hermione and Ron would do good in covering for him, he relied on them.
and I know that you never know what you're doing.", she replied still whispering and bent forward.
"Are you alright?", Ron asked and Harry nodded wordlessly.
"Yeah." Potter said quietly, "You should."
"Talk with professor McGonnagal?" Hermione asked and Harry knew exactly what was coming next. "Are you in trouble? Why did you have to talk with McGonnagal? What's wrong?"
"It worked.", he cheered.
The minister breathed out angrily and leaned back again.
Theo laughed. "Come on Draco, loosen up a little."
"Neville.", Harry said before Neville closed the door, "Send Luna my best wishes."
When he finally got Ron out of bed, Neville pulled him into the common room where Malfoy half sat, half lay on the couch. Ron turned to look at Neville with big eyes.
"No, Draco. This man can answer to any of your questions about these things.", he explained and Draco nodded. The man smiled.
Draco smiled and kissed him. He pulled the blankets over Potter and lay his head on his chest, listening to the comforting sound of his heartbeat and smiled.
Harry nodded. He guessed they were right.
Draco furrowed his brow.
"You.", Draco answered.
"That sounds wonderful." Mrs Granger said.
"I mean maybe I've fallen asleep there for a while, I don't know." Harry added.
"I won't. Stop being paranoid and drink."
because of Draco. His smile made Draco wanting to smile too.
"So what are your plans for the rest of the week?" Harry asked, trying to avoid the fact that he had fallen asleep while Malfoy was sitting next to him.
"I am.", he said and looked for an elve bringing them their breakfast so Potter will finally shut up.
Malfoy chuckled. "Sure, no problem."
Harry closed the paper and smiled at Draco. This was a real surprise - the
Draco wiped his forehead with a silk cloth. The heat was unbearable. He and Theo were sitting at a cafe on Diagon Alley. Draco sipped his iced latte although it didn't seem to stop his body temperature from rising.
"Oh god you behave like little children." Granted said annoyed.
"Hey, Draco. What's wrong?", he asked again and looked at Draco.
Lucius stopped Draco on his way outside.
"Malfoy." Harry said calming, but Malfoy shut him up again.
Draco grinned satisfied and Ron looked even angrier.
"You didn't, but it's obvious."
"Do that again."
Harry and Teddy took the lift to Level 2, Teddy was allowed to press the button. On the way to his cubicle, Harry was greeted by a lot of fellow Ministry workers and some Aurors. Kingsley wasn't in his cubicle at the time, so Harry went straight to his and grabbed the stack of papers on his desk. He sat Teddy on the desk while he packed the papers into his bag and they left the Aurors headquarters again. As they already were on Level 2, Harry decided to drop by Mr Weasley's office and say a quick hello.
"Your father is not here and you know it. So if you want to tell me anything, do so. He won't find out anything you don't want him to find out.
It's been almost two weeks since Harry and Malfoy did
Malfoy nodded slowly. He got rid of his robe and shoes and slurped over to his own bed.
"Are you okay?" He heard Potter mumble through the dark.
He didn't know where this was going until some of the other students groaned annoyed and shoved their money to Seamus.
He looked around as he sat in the common room and wanted to do his Divination homework. Draco noticed that some frames were already filled with pictures from some students, so he stood up and left his homework on the armchair and walked up to the pictures. He found the Patil twins on one and the Weasley twins with Ron and Weaselette on another. Draco rolled his eyes as he looked at the other pictures. Deep down he wanted to hang a picture like this as well, but he knew he didn't have any good memories that were caught on camera and if so, Draco wouldn't hang them up in the common room where everyone could see it and laugh at him or soil the picture.
They used the Floo network straight to Malfoy Manor where Draco's mother was already waiting for them. To Draco she looked as beautiful as ever, despite her tired eyes. Her hair was up in a tight bun and she wore shimmering black robes. Draco appreciated the familiar cold air in the Manor.
When Harry had finished packing his stuff, he lay down on his bed. He was really exhausted, but couldn't sleep. He missed Teddy. Harry trusted Mrs Weasley with him, she had raised enough kids to know how to do it, but he simply couldn't think of leaving until the Christmas holidays came and not see his godson at all. Harry sighed. This night was going to be a very long night.
"It should be a surprise.", Harry said.
Harry turned around, hastily grabbed a few milk cartons and got ready to leave. He was already almost around the shelf when Malfoy said:
Draco sighed. Because Potter never really did anything to Draco - at least not without Draco doing something to him first. And because Draco now thought he only hated Potter because his father taught him so. But now that Lucius wasn't here anymore, Draco had the chance to do what he wanted.
"Only that you're in love with someone. Come on, Harry. I'm your best friend. Don't you think I noticed you walking around like happily ever after? Tell me. Is it Ginny?", she asked excitedly.
"Nothing.", Draco said quietly and looked to the floor. Potter made a step towards him.
"When we got back and you weren't here I was really worried, Harry." She said.
"Are you nervous for tomorrow?", Neville asked after a while, but Harry only shrugged.
"Well", Harry turned back around to look at Draco, "this is awkward."
Harry gave in. He nodded smiling. "Alright then, I guess I'll see you two at the party."
"That was a very nice speech." McGonagall  said to Harry while he chewed on his chicken, "Are you sure you want to talk to the students later? There may be quite a lot of them."
"I won't be bored, believe me," Malfoy replied and laughed.
Harry sat there at the Gryffindor table, all alone. He looked around until his eye caught Malfoy, who was sitting on the Slytherin table, all alone as well. Harry smiled and checked his watch. He had ten minutes left before he was five minutes early. So Harry got up, took his plate and walked over to the table on the other side of the hall.
Harry sighed and slowly walked towards the door. Harry looked at Nott over his shoulder, but he was busy in the kitchen, so Harry opened the door slowly and peeked inside. As Harry switched on a dim green light, he felt like he'd just entered a completely different world. The room was darker than the rest of the apartment, it didn't have bright beige walls like the rest of the place, its walls were a dark grey that reminded Harry of the stone walls in Malfoy Manor. A Slytherin banner hung on the left, and the big eagle owl sat in it's cage on the right of a window from where you had a beautiful view over London.
"It's creepy to stare at people while they sleep," Malfoy said smirking.
"Black underwear?" Potter asked and Draco groaned.
"Five hundred.", he answered.
"Do you love him?"
"Fine. Alright." He heard Malfoy say, "No need to get your wand in a knot."
"That was exactly my reaction.", Ron explained shrugging.
Draco had asked a few questions about this
"How old was he?", he asked.
If someone would have told Draco that he would some day end up sitting on Harry Potter's couch watching a movie with Harry Potter, Draco would have told them they were crazy. But it actually was kind of nice. Well not nice... but not bad.
Harry looked at Draco, who started laughing.
Potter's friends were actually waiting for Draco in the common room.
"Have a look around." Fred said as someone called for him.
When he opened the door to their flat, Harry felt like his shirt was soaked. He hoped his ice wouldn't already be liquid, so he slipped out of his shoes and hurried into the kitchen.
"You don't like him either, do you?", Harry asked and of course he already knew the answer.
"Malfoy, are you ready?" Weasley asked.
Harry nodded and Snape walked away, his black cloak swinging behind him.
And then Ron came downstairs. Harry and Malfoy were in the kitchen and magically put the food on a tray, while Hermione was still on the terrace. Harry paid close attention to Ron's reaction. Ron's eyes widened and his jaw dropped before he could bring himself to say a word. Harry saw that Malfoy looked more angry than scared - more than Harry had thought he would be. So hidden behind the counter, Harry grabbed Malfoy's hand. Malfoy looked at Harry with a surprised look, but Harry just smiled lightly and looked back at Ron.
Draco clenched his teeth and reached to grab Potter's arm and pull him away from the wall.
"Harry, I didn't expect to see you here.", Hermione said.
"What?" Malfoy asked irritated, "No!"
"How long have you been awake last night?", he asked. Harry swallowed his juice and answered shortly:
In the evening, they visited the Weasley family and enjoyed Mrs Weasley's homemade dinner. I was delicious - as always - and made Harry not miss the food at Hogwarts, though it was really tasteful as well.
"You better leave him alone.", he said.
"Do it.", he said shortly and walked towards the door.
"... as it should be.", he actually said. Ginny laughed.
They had slept for a few hours and now it was eight a.m.
leaned against the wall. How could he have been so stupid and take Matt's hand. That was so unnecessary! Harry knew Malfoy had Potions at this time and he knew he had it with seventh years because Malfoy has been complaining about it every week. But Harry also knew that Potions was Malfoy's last class today. So Harry decided to wait for the class to end. He sat down on the floor, leaned his head against the wall and stayed there, self-loathing.
"Shit.", Draco said, as he opened the window in Harry's room, "Shit!"
The following seconds felt like an eternity. Draco watched Potter fall to the ground in slow-motion.
Draco agreed and they walked back to the group.
"Who are you going with?", he yelled after Hermione, but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle.
They jumped up and went downstairs. Harry was happy to see that the mood has lightened - Mrs Weasley wasn't sobbing anymore and George wasn't shouting anymore. Mr Weasley passed around glasses of eggnog and encouraged everyone to take one, though Fleur declined. They gathered on the sofa in front of the Christmas tree and waited for the wand to decide who should open first.
. It makes sense to be gay when it comes to
"We are here for the trial of Lucius Malfoy." The minister spoke and his loud voice echoed in the courtroom.
"You don't have to pretend that you don't exist," Harry said and Malfoy rolled his eyes.
It was an amazing evening. The whole Weasley family and their spouses were together and their friends joined as well - Seamus, Dean, Neville and Luna. Malfoy's friends came over as well, two hours before midnight. Draco vanished with them into his and Harry's tent and Harry was happy they were feeling welcomed here. Hermione showed Pansy around and introduced her to the people she didn't already know. Harry noticed a slight scowl here and there, but he grinned at the suppression. Draco, Theo and Blaise walked through the dark grounds and talked about something Harry didn't know about. He was too busy with the others to be bothered by that.
"You didn't sleep much either?" Harry asked.
During Herbology he couldn't concentrate at all. Malfoy didn't show up for the whole lesson, nor did he for the lesson after. Harry would like to curse him for being such an asshole. It was 100% a trick that Harry should come to the lake. Probably every student will hide behind bushes and laugh at Harry for asking Draco Malfoy out. Harry didn't plan to go there. No chance Malfoy was going to hurt him more than he already did. But that was just the way Malfoy was - a fucking prat.
"What?", Draco asked and blushed even more.
Why couldn't they understand that he wanted to be alone? Was the locked door and his silence not enough? Draco sighed again, rethinking everything that had happened in the last couple of days.
"We've already had this. They are so green.", Malfoy muttered.
"I- um, I'll go back to Viktor, he just got something to drink.", Hermione said and was suddenly smiling again.
As soon as the portrait closed, Hermione slid closer to Harry and smiled.
They had to understand him, they just had to!
"I didn't know people lived in houses that big.", Harry breathed.
But a spell that electrocuted people? That was one too much. Harry suddenly felt a stabbing pain in his chest, either from standing too long or from being electrocuted.
"Shut up, Malfoy.", he said, his eyes rolling.
Draco rolled his eyes. As she turned her back on him and started talking to Theo and her friends, Draco wasn't offended at all. This was exactly what he was used to.
Harry winked. "Don't worry, I knew you were going to return it."
"Because obviously you don't spend a single minute getting ready," Malfoy said, skeptically eyeing Harry's hair.
"I know you like it.", he said. Harry's cheeks burned again.
Harry's insides rumbled and his heart skipped a beat as he finally closed the distance between himself and Draco. Draco gasped quietly and Harry giggled. His senses were overfilled, Draco's hands grabbed Harry's ass and Harry's hands found their way into Draco's soft hair. The kiss didn't last long, because someone behind them slammed a bag to the floor. Harry was startled and pulled away from Draco.
Draco laughed as well and flung himself over Harry, kissing him softly. Before the moment could last any longer, the door opened and Ron stood startled there.
He took the cage of his owl and with a flick of him wand, he made cage and trolley vanish and reappear downstairs. Draco threw himself on his bed and breathed out.
"Yes it does, don't argue with me."
That seemed to twist something inside the Hufflepuff. She looked up at Harry with big eyes. "But you have a family?"
"But you can't," Malfoy repeated louder, "You can't hold my hand."
"Malfoy!"
"So..." Draco broke the silence between them, but didn't know what to say. At least he got Potter's attention. "How's life going?"
"What is so important that you have to come here to tell me?" Harry asked sternly.
In this moment, the classroom door burst open and Hermione stuck her head out.
"There is no but!", Harry shook his head groaning and left his two friends standing in the corridor alone.
"Hey Harry.", a young Ravenclaw girl said as she passed the two of them.
Harry sighed and kneaded his forehead with his knuckles. "I think so."
Potter looked at him. After a minute, Draco started talking.
The way to the library never seemed to be that far. Draco couldn't stand these two people.
"Let's go," Harry whispered in Malfoy's ear.
Harry smiled. Draco never sounded less self confident.
"See you tomorrow." He said.
"I didn't think you would, have you looked at yourself?" One elve said, staring at Draco with big eyes.
Ignoring Hermione's look, Harry stepped out onto the terrace and raised his gaze to the sky, where dark clouds slowly but surely build a wall between him and the sun. It was getting darker outside and it was obvious a storm was coming, but the air was still as hot as before. Harry loved this kind of weather - when everything was hot and sticky and then cold and refreshing rain was about to come down and wash away the heat. Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
"How is she?" Harry asked, hoping Draco wouldn't get upset.
Harry furrowed his brow. What?
Harry laughed. "Ron! I haven't forgotten who he is and I haven't forgotten what he did!"
"Potter, you jerk.", Draco said laughing and kissed Harry.
Just as Malfoy had left the room, Bond was back. Harry let him inside and took the letter.
"Well then, go get yourself something to drink and enjoy the party." Nott said before he vanished into the crowd of people.
down and grinned at Harry, who ignored him, took his cup of tea and carefully sipped at it.
But Kyle wouldn't let Draco walk away. He put on an evil grin and Harry felt his blood boiling. Now Harry wanted to step away, but Kyle came into his way. Now Draco pushed him away hardly.
Harry had already known about the trial before the Prophet had reported about it, because Narcissa Malfoy told him in a letter about it. They have been writing letters for a short time, but given the time they both stopped. Now they only wrote to each other when something exciting had happened, in this case it was Lucius' trials. Narcissa was very afraid of it even though she, Harry and everyone else already knew what was going to happen. Harry had promised her he would come and give a good word for Lucius.
"You know what?", he asked.
"She isn't in there," Harry said and Ron slowly nodded.
"Oh, yes. Yes, I have. He ate in the kitchens.", Harry told.
"Yeah...", Draco said. He shifted uncomfortable under his blankets.
Draco's parents said goodbye to his friends and together, they stepped outside. Narcissa and Lucius waved after them for a while, then closed the door and Draco, Potter, Theo, Blaise, Pansy and Greg walked down towards the iron gate.
"Yeah.", he said. His throat was dry and he thought he couldn't speak, but he forced the words out anyways.
"What are you doing?" Harry asked confused.
"She denies it. Everything. Tells me she didn't want anything to happen with him but his arm wrapped around her she couldn't explain," Ron answered.
"I'm sorry.", he said, "I know you're not ready for this and I know that you think they hate you-"
"Now do it to me.", Draco said. His voice sounded urgent.
Draco closed his eyes for a second, hoping he would fall asleep right away, but too many things swirled around in his head. The kiss. Potter had kissed Draco! Draco didn't deny that he liked it. In fact, he liked it really much, that was why he'd kissed Potter again. Potter was really good at that - probably the only thing Potter was good at. Draco smiled to himself.
Draco could see his pupils getting wider and giggled. He
"Sorry.", Potter muttered.
Harry nodded. "Of course, how can we say no to this!"
"Draco?", he asked again.
They walked out on the street get some breakfast. Draco grabbed Potter's hand and they apparated. After they arrived in front of a wizarding coffee shop, Draco felt sick. He will never get used to apparating.
He jumped next Potter on his bed.
"Oh Merlin, don't be so dramatic." Theo stood in the door, watching Draco with a smirk on his face.
"Draco. I really like you, but you have to face it already. You and Potter don't belong together. That's nothing but gross and unnatural.", he said with a disgusted look.
remember what I said last night. And I mean it."
"It was a bit chilly, but it was actually very alright." Harry said smiling.
"Yeah, right. I could imagine Malfoy having a problem with that," Dean thought.
"SHIT!", Harry cursed loudly.
"Well, I'm more than fine. I made a new charm this morning," she showed Harry the weird-looking thing on her long necklace.
"What are we doing now?" Draco asked.
"You don't go to parties very often, do you?"
Draco would have teached him, but no.
"I know that he is my, same as your, enemy and I would never consider anything else. I had to play it nice with picking him up from the hospital, because I was the reason he was even in there. I was in a fight with another student and when Potter tried to play the hero, I fired a shot at him to get him out of the way. McGonnagal then rushed right to him and she said I better be there when he gets out of the hospital wing or I would be in a lot of trouble, you know how annoying she can be. Don't even get me started on her. Walking around like she owns the school, thinking she can live up to what Professor Snape did! There is no one greater than a Slytherin, am I right?"
"Was it your idea?"
"Hi", Harry said.
"I'm going to write my parents.", Draco answered.
"It's Sam! He's calling!"
"Harry took me to the zoo.", Draco told her.
"Good morning, Mr Potter." One said.
"Hermione!", Weasley said and she was quiet.
He let go of Draco and cleaned up the mess they had done.
"You look neat," Malfoy said and smiled. Harry smiled too and felt his ears heating up. And now every time Harry was expecting Malfoy to be nice, he was going to be nice. Harry hadn't been disappointed in him for the last few weeks. Malfoy was nice most of the time, he got Harry out of awkward situations with his friends, he wanted Harry to look good, and his smile was just amazing.
"You're really gonna do it?" Theo asked.
Harry watched her running a hand though her hair and turned his head to look at Malfoy as she came close to their table.
"I'm not going to eat this pink fluffy stuff.", Draco said and crossed his arms in front of his chest. Harry laughed.
Harry nodded understanding. They ate in silence for a few moments.
be familiar. Malfoy had never been nice, Malfoy had never been there for Harry. So Harry decided to tell him.
Even after the war, Harry was surprised to see people flinching at the name. But Malcolm shook his head wordlessly.
Harry nodded slowly. So Malfoy was going to stay the night. Okay. He didn't know what he'd expected. He didn't think Malfoy would leave his mother here, but Harry guessed he had somehow hoped that Malfoy would.
"Why do you want to know anyways?"
Harry tapped on the bed next to himself, signaling Malfoy to sit down. Malfoy did so, and Harry asked him what day it was - he couldn't stand not knowing.
"We need to see Professor McGonnagal."
Draco laughed back. "Not a problem."
Draco felt lonely. Blaise, his only friend back at Hogwarts, had abandoned him and made friends with some weirdos from lousy houses. And Potter, who tried to be nice to Draco and who wanted Draco to be nice to him, wanted to sit next to him but Draco couldn't get himself to be seen with this idiot, especially not in the Great Hall where every student and every teacher was present. Draco sighed.
It was a Broomstick Servicing Kit and high-quality Quidditch gloves. This must have cost a fortune. Harry hugged Draco tightly. He got Malfoy a stack of
In the last week of September, Harry and Draco went to the supermarket to buy some groceries for the coming week, and because Harry and Ron have had decided to bake Hermione some cookies for her Sunday-package. As they rounded the corner, Harry grinned at Malfoy's face.
Everyone clapped loudly.
Harry sighed again. This was not how he had planned for the night to go. Of course, he wanted to be there for Malfoy and he still wouldn't have let him go alone, but he was bored and quite frankly didn't really know how to talk to Malfoy about this, because as Harry knew him, he would shut down and get mad.
"Out.", Draco mimicked Nott.
Harry grinned. He noticed Lydia smiled at Draco, of course she couldn't know Harry was interested in Draco rather than her.
"What?" Potter replied loudly and stepped out of the crowd.
"Huh?"
Harry put the paper down and picked up his cereal. Grinning, he looked at the others.
"James! Get over here, your son is crying."
.", Harry said annoyed. He spoke the word "her" like it was something bad they were talking about.
"What are you going to do while I'm gone?" Draco asked and she shrugged.
"Nothing." Draco said through gritted teeth, trying to stay calm.
"You like the watch?" Malfoy asked.
Malfoy shrugged. "No idea."
"That seems about right." Malfoy said, looking at the men again. "Like James Bond." He added under his breath and Harry smiled.
~ Draco"
? Because he is just as strange as his mother was. We never wanted him, but we couldn't leave him on the doorstep, so we had to take him. A shame it was, yes, a shame.", Petunia said loudly.
Draco buried his face in his hands. This was so embarrassing.
"What?", he asked.
"I don't know! If you're so keen on finding out, then go and ask them.", Vernon snapped.
"I think I have everything I need."
Nott swallowed and looked from Draco to Harry and back to Draco. He nodded slowly and flinched, as Draco reached for the door knob.
Draco turned his back to the pictures and went to his dorm room. There he sat on his bed, his legs crossed and looked around. He didn't know what to do. Without Potter talking to him, it was even lonelier at Hogwarts than before. How did Potter become the only person Draco could talk to? Everything had turned upside down. The war had made everything wrong.
Harry and Malfoy shared a look, both wanting Harry to go home. Malfoy wanted him to go home. Harry knew it. They were making their way through the atrium of the Ministry of Magic and Narcissa led the trio to the fireplaces.
They actually had a really good time. Everyone was having fun and they got along even better throughout the evening. There were a lot of Muggles, who didn't quite understand everything the wizards talked about, but at the end of the night their memory would be modified so they wouldn't remember any of the weird things they have heard or seen. The music was loud and fast, they danced so hard they were sweating and the alcohol was going to their heads.
"If I like it?" Potter took Teddy from Granger and kissed his forehead. "I love it!"
"Sit, sit," Dean offered.
Harry stood up, perplexed.
"Promise me you won't punch him in the face.", Potter said as they walked up to the house.
I am sorry you had to find out like this."
"Oh nonsense. Come on, dear."
"He's right.", she said, to Harry's surprise, "These tasks mean to test you in the most brutal way. They're almost cruel."
"We would need a scissor to get them into shape.", Seamus joked.
"Potter, you don't understand. I simply can't tell you now, ok. Now let it go." Harry sighed.
"Potter." Malfoy said quietly and Harry turned around, "I'm sorry."
"Well, anyways", Draco said, "Thanks for the whiskey."
"Morning." Harry's voice was hoarse and he cleared his throat loudly.
Harry just noticed the water dripping from Malfoy's hair onto his black, tight shirt and leaving stains. One drop slowly rolled down Malfoy's pale, soft neck.
Potter blinked. "I just want to be nice, you know. After everything."
"And then you will kiss me in front of the whole school, the cup between us.", he said.
After the feast, the Headmistress announced that the students could meet Harry in her office. She trusted him with that and had said it was basically his office, too. The prefects, Hemione was the one of house Gryffindor, led the first-years to their common rooms. The other students followed. Harry parted ways with Ron, who walked with their friends up to the Gryffindor Tower, and Harry went the other way to the Headmistress's office.
Vernon didn't know Draco as good as Harry did. Only one wrong word and his head would be blasted off. Draco didn't care about the rules.
! Draco laughed as Harry looked down at Draco's cock.
After Draco had finished, he noticed that he forgot his pyjama outside. Well or badly he had to go out there with only a towel on.
Harry grinned even wider. He couldn't wait until they were at home and he could grab Draco's hand.
"You heard what Potter and I just said. You were present. You know me. Have you
"I think it's nice how far we got." He said.
He didn't let himself disturbed by Draco's wand poking into his fat neck.
The Entrance Hall was packed with students too, all milling around waiting for eight o'clock, when the doors to the Great Hall would be thrown open.
"You're insane.", Draco shook his head.
Eighth year was just around the corner and Draco was not excited. It were summer holidays, what once had been Draco's favourite time of the year, because he was at home. Now he hated this time... because he was at home. But he didn't want to go back to Hogwarts, not now. He would rather go where ever Harry Potter was.
"Nothing." She said coldly.
"Draco.", Harry said and took a step closer, "The only thing that could hurt me, is seeing you like this. Close to tears and afraid."
"I- I have to go!" Harry said and stormed off.
"What?" Was the answer coming from the other side of the door.
"The healer asked me earlier if my partner would stay with me." Malfoy said and looked at Harry with a weird look on his face - half smirking and half not.
"I have already borrowed the book and I'm going to read it this evening," Hermione told Harry while she put some potatoes on her plate and started eating them.
"I want to talk to
That was the end of the conversation. Draco checked the clock nervously and was pacing up and down the living room. He decided to take a shower, before he was going to go mad. Stepping into the shower, everything he could think about was Potter. Potter and his emerald eyes that made Draco feel warm and happy. Potter and his sixpack and back muscles that shouldn't even be there considering how scrawny he had been back at Hogwarts. Potter and his stupid messy hair that used to annoy Draco, but now he loved it. Potter was perfect to him.
Potter nodded understanding and Draco smiled. "What are you smiling at?" Potter asked and furrowed his brow.
"Whao, that's dark," was Malfoy's comment.
"I was going to go anyways," Luna nodded and smiled.
"How did you come here?", Draco asked.
". Draco smiled. He opened the paper at page 9, where the article was.
Harry looked at Malfoy and immediately knew something was wrong. "What's going on?" He asked.
He slightly shook his head to make these thoughts go away. Everyone of Potter's group was already busy with their own things. Except for Granger who was talking to Potter. Draco walked past them, slightly touched Potter's hand and left the common room, hoping Potter would follow. And he did. Before they reached the door, Potter grabbed Draco's shoulders and followed Draco inside.
They all made their way up to the tower as the sun set behind the castle. It got dark outside and the many candles in the hallways lit up. The fire in the common room made the room glow in an orangey light and Harry loved how cozy it looked. The few students in there played wizards chess and Ron asked to join. Luna and Neville immediately cuddled up in the armchair and Dean sat down and wrote a letter to Seamus who hasn't returned for his eight year.
"An hour long you'll have to look. To recover what we took.", Harry continued.
Hermione nodded and Harry could see she was thinking about everything he'd just told them.
Harry rolled his eyes. Malfoy whipped out his wand, flicked it and Harry's shirt tucked itself in his pants.
"Go outside then, if you want. I'm looking for my books." Hermione said and rolled her eyes. But Ron was too in love with her and maybe a bit too scared of making her angry, so he stayed by her side.
Harry looked up and rolled his eyes.
"I know." Malfoy said, but didn't sound as if he'd try to sleep now.
"Shut it. One word to anyone and I will kill you with my bare hands, Potter." Malfoy said and suddenly he was the old one again "This" he said, gesturing in the air "never happened. I didn't want this, I didn't want to be nice to you. So piss off."
"Um, Draco...", he said and pointed at the four blue spots on each side of Draco's hip, that came from last night.
"But, I mean- Do you... do you like me?", Harry asked and blushed even harder, but Draco only smiled.
Everyone looked at Lucius, to find out something about this all on his face, but it stayed cold as stone.
"I definitely want to," Potter replied and smiled.
Draco kept looking, but as soon as he opened Potter's closet he got immediate eye cancer and closed it again. So much colour! A thousand knitted sweaters and a lot of red and yellow shirts and blue and green and- ugh. Not one single black item was in there. Draco rubbed his eyes. He grabbed his book and lay back dow on Potter's bed. Draco wanted to get used to laying here. His own bed looked even neater from this perspective. And Potter's was even messier up close.
"What in heaven's name is going on?" Weasley asked.
"I'm sorry, I can only release more information to family members."
"So, who's this?"
"Oh, you know Hermione, she is back in her element and ready to re-read every single book the Hogwarts library has to offer."
Harry walked up to Gryffindor tower, Draco down into the dungeons. Harry named the password to the Fat Lady, who opened the hole and he climbed inside. Hermione and Ginny sat on the couch and watched Ron and Dean playing wizards chess. As Hermione spotted Harry, she waved to him and he sat down.
"I'm not telling you.", answered Harry.
"Don't move." He said and stepped closer again.
"Draco...", Potter sounded exasperated. Draco pressed his lips to Potter's.
And then there was Potter -
Harry laughed and nodded. Lucius eyed Harry and Draco suspiciously through narrowed eyes. Draco smiled at Harry, but Harry knew he felt very, very uncomfortable.
Harry's heart skipped a beat. "What?"
"Why not?" Kyle shouted back.
Harry smiled.
"Don't lie.", said Draco, "Sing."
"If it's hard, just rub it", George had once told Harry.
"Shhhhh!" Malfoy said and put his finger on Ron's lips.
should I pretend you're not here when you're staring at me with your ridiculously big eyes?" Malfoy groaned.
After a minute of silence, Draco sat up and  did Harry. Harry tried to take in everything on Malfoy's face, every expression he gave him, every twitch of his lip.
"Draco.", Potter said and kissed him. Draco smiled.
"Hey. Thanks for coming." Hermione said and Harry was pleasantly surprised by her nice tone.
And just because everyone hated Draco.
"I love you, ferret.", Harry smiled.
and after a while, everyone else joined in. Harry put his head on Draco's shoulder and closed his eyes. This was what real happiness felt like. As Harry opened his eyes again, Ron and Hermione danced by them and gave him a thumbs-up. Harry grinned. Ginny and Dean looked happy as well when they danced, so did Pansy and Theo. Harry's jaw dropped, however, when his eyes fell on a different pair.
