"Partly," Draco said. "It also occurred to me that if we had a portrait made of someone who could fight, we could hang it in Hogwarts and they could rally the other portrait subjects. All those who could actually fight, I mean."
Malfoy didn't look at him. "Fire ahead."
"Yes, sir. The old Charms classroom. It's currently storing broken desks."
Harry laughed, though he was thinking of the Vanishing Cabinet. Malfoy was creative enough when he had reason to be. "Fair enough. Well, first things first. Breakfast?"
"This is genuine, all right - " Potter cut in.
Malfoy picked it up and pulled it over them. "Thank God for wandless magic. And that you can actually do it."
"Meaning you didn't finish it."
"Are you even listening to me?" Draco was furious. "It wasn't part of my assignment to fuck you, you know!"
"What? I - "
Malfoy thrust himself wantonly back onto Harry's cock, writhing. "So good," he breathed, and it was sheer, raw need now - no disguises, no games. "Ah - you could do anything to me right now, Potter, anything - "
Draco gritted his teeth together and found words. "Potter, I haven't duped anyone. Yes, I had an assignment to get to be friends with you. Genuinely friends."
Who knew what the blank stretch of Malfoy's page had to tell? What atrocities, crimes of war had the other committed before whatever had happened that had caused him to leave Voldemort? The truth was that Harry didn't want to know. It was one thing to play games and carry on school rivalries, however bitter they had been and regardless of the fact that it had put them on opposite sides of the bloodiest, most brutal six years Harry had ever hoped to live through. He did not want to know, whether or not Malfoy had changed since, that he had tortured innocent people or been the one to throw the bombs into the Muggle school yard that time, or whatever else he had been involved in. He didn't want to hear it. On the other hand, though, Malfoy's entire future was hanging on Harry's parchment, Harry's investigation. Something within him wanted very badly to believe that Malfoy might not have been involved in anything like that, but even he knew how naïve that sounded. Harry heaved a sigh and dropped the quill on the desk.
"No," Malfoy said smugly. "And you know what else? These glamours were far easier to catch, for whatever reason."
Malfoy slid in beside Harry and put a cup of coffee down in front of him. "Everything okay?" he asked coolly.
"It's me I'm worried about," Harry said glumly. His voice was gravelly with sleep and he yawned again, rubbing a hand over his stubbled jaw.
It was hardly audible, yet Harry heard it distinctly. He looked up at the ceiling, lost in the dark above his face. "I never knew."
"Shut up," he muttered, his face burning. He was glad Malfoy couldn't see him. And also very tired.
More confusion. And embarrassment. "Yes, of course I remember that," Harry said. "What are you talking about?"
Potter nodded toward Draco's empty flute. "Champagne, if that's what you're drinking."
"And it wasn't hard for you to stay so uninvolved?" Hermione persisted.
"Yes - we had always looked for our - ah - chance to rise to power again," Dolohov gasped, wincing. Harry did not know what Malfoy had done to him, but he was past caring. "She did all the work for us."
"Do you?" He kept his voice neutral, reminding himself that he was pursuing a friendship with the hostile git. "Why do you always go, then?"
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the grin expand. "Possible, but you forget - my room is next to Malfoy's. I know the sound of a Silencing spell going off, and I heard your voice in there before it went, mate." Satisfied with having got the last word, Tonks shot him a smug look and closed the door.
"So this is how you would regain power?" Draco said contemptuously. "By trapping innocent students in dreams fed by ambition, dreams that they cannot escape, save by inhumanly strong willpower? By rendering an entire generation of wizards and witches unconscious and dreaming of evil? I call that pathetic."
Harry thought of a few memorable times that this had been made painfully clear to him or to one of his colleagues in the Department. "Yes. I do know," he said, barely above a whisper. There was a short silence. "What time is it?"
Malfoy's eyes moved over Harry's face, and then Malfoy was turning and walking further into the apartment. "Come in," he said, not looking back.
"I think I will take you to the mosque today, after all," Malfoy said thoughtfully.
"One thing," Draco said, attempting to regain some measure of dignity, brushing himself off and avoiding Potter's eye.
Potter didn't smile. "It's classified."
"At least we have magic here."
The light dawned. "That's not at all what I'm saying," Harry said. "I'm not asking you to. I want to be with you. Live with you. Spend my life with you. Or - well - I mean, however long it ends up - it's too soon to say stuff like that, I guess, but what I want right now is to be with you."

"Good thing I'm in shape," Potter joked.
"Let's get out of here," he said. They walked out, coffee in hand, and began walking back to the station. Partway there, Harry nodded toward a seedy-looking side alley and made for it.
Harry's face grew very hot. "I am not," he said slowly, as angry as he'd ever been, "sexually defective."
"Maybe," Harry said. "I don't know where it would be best to go, though."
Lupin regarded him with the same patience he usually employed, but he looked tired. Tired, Harry realised, of not only keeping the tense household headquarters running, but also of keeping most of the individuals in it running. Lupin said nothing, but went to the desk, peering at the woefully short stack of completed reports. "You still haven't done Malfoy's," Lupin commented, his tone carefully neutral.
Harry's control was hanging by a thread already; he began to thrust at a barely-moderated speed, the lubricant easing the way. The warmth was all-encompassing now, his cock surrounded in heat pressing into him in pleasure that was mounting far too quickly. Malfoy was moaning wantonly, fisting his cock. "Touch me," he gasped, his voice even rougher. "My cock - you - "

Harry stood and began to pace. How much of this was his own fault? He knew that his negligence as Ginny's partner was hardly to blame for his wife's aborted bid for power, but he still blamed himself for not having known about it, at the very least. Had he just minimised into manageable levels because he couldn't be bothered to take the time to notice what a problem it was becoming? Or because he didn't care enough, a nagging voice in his head suggested. Harry remembered with reluctance one of many conversations that had taken place in this very room, one that was heavy with retroactive meaning. He had been sitting on the couch reading the paper when she'd come storming in through the front door. The kids were all at Ron and Hermione's; he'd been alone in the house.
He had made his hair even more dishevelled with his gesture, and his clothes were rumpled as though he'd just been napping in them. He wasn't wearing robes, just jeans and an old t-shirt that said MoM Auror Department '11. Both were well-worn and faded, and it occurred Draco that Potter looked rather good in them. He was tall enough, only about an inch shorter than Draco, and had a lean, hungry sort of look to him that no amount of Weasley feeding could apparently undo. It was not the first time he had made this observation. Draco made himself turn away. "You should go and eat dinner, then."
It was all history. The important thing was for everyone to move ahead in the best way possible. Which all sounded very good when one was talking about societies and the larger picture, but how did that apply to someone like Malfoy? Harry thought of this, too, and it made a welcome relief from thinking about himself and his own life.
They mixed drinks and made food and after, went around the screen into what there was of Potter's bedroom. While Potter was fetching their clothes from the other room, Draco got into the bed and shifted over to the far side, leaving room for him. Potter came back and started taking things out of his trouser pockets and lining them up on the dresser. "I see you managed to find the bed," he joked. There was nothing save the bed, the dresser, a floor lamp or two, and a large potted plant in the sectioned-off area.
"Do it," Malfoy commanded. "Go slowly," he cautioned, as Harry positioned himself. His hands were holding his knees close beside his face, eyes on Harry. Harry watched himself disappear into Malfoy's body, holding his breath out of the slight fear that if he didn't, the sensation would overwhelm him and he would lose it right there, before he was even all the way inside. He was not seventeen, he reminded himself sternly. Get it together. Malfoy was all heat, as hot on the inside as his façade was cold. He kept up the agonisingly slow push, watching it, looking at the way Malfoy's lithe belly had creased into tiny wrinkles with his legs bent back so far. Harry's balls settled against Malfoy's arse and his breath gusted out as sensation flooded him. For a moment, it was almost too much. "Move," Malfoy said, his voice strained with the same tension.
"Harry." Draco sighed. "I wish I could. It's just that there's so much else, so much other baggage going into this. Lots of bad personal history. I'm afraid that will come back to haunt us. Your friends don't exactly love me. There are lots of reasons to be cautious."
__________________
Harry didn't know whether he meant for sleep or something else, but it didn't matter. "Okay."
"Oh, I did, Potter. Same alley and everything." Malfoy was evidently very amused.
"I know. Thanks." Harry still felt like a jerk, but also relieved that it was said and done.
Harry Disapparated. The atrium of the Ministry of Magic materialised around him and he hurried to a lift and joined several of his classmates on the descent. The room was already full of people getting coffee or pumpkin juice from the tables at the sides, running across to meet friends after the month's separation, or standing about in groups, catching up. He heard his name and turned to see Hermione, always the first to find him in a crowd, and found a smile spreading across his face. He went to meet them. There were hugs all around and everyone was talking at once. Ron was going on about Muggle cures for various things, Ginny interrupting him to explain the tracking system she'd devised and which had impressed her advisor to no end, and Hermione was mostly trying to interrogate Harry about his own assignment.
Hermione looked troubled. "I don't know what to tell you," she said. "I think that - well, I think that when the sexual stuff in a relationship isn't working, then not much else is going to, either. That's what the experts say, at least. I think it would be nice if you two could find a way to be friends. I mean, if neither of you is happy or satisfied with the other, then you're bound to go looking for someone else, aren't you?"
"Yeah, well, I'm not sure what that was," Harry said. "I guess it was never disgusting in the actual moment, and it got less disturbing every time. But after, you still want to…?"
They were checking their email. Harry had sent another short line to Hermione, adding that he'd let her know if anything happened, read: stop emailing, and that no, he and Draco hadn't killed each other yet.
Potter shrugged. "By now, the war feels like ancient history. Our children never experienced Voldemort or the Death Eaters personally. It could very easily be made to seem alluring, especially to an impressionable sixteen-year-old."
"Show me what!" It tore his throat. "That my wife was a thief? Working with Death Eaters? I don't believe it!"
"Hello," Malfoy said, looking far too relaxed, leaning back in his chair. "Long meeting."
"Mr Potter! Hello!" Startled, Harry didn't move, but he looked around and recognised a lady from down the street two cashier lanes over, a neighbour to the owners of the grey cat. He couldn't recall her name, but gave a feeble wave back.
Draco shrugged, vague. "Oh, this and that. Trying to get my life sorted, that sort of thing. You?"
"An issue with a staff member," Susan said. "I shouldn't really be talking about this, but since it's someone we both know... well, let's just say that one of the top staff has become a little unreliable lately."
Malfoy fell silent. Harry's quill was unmoving in his hand. After a bit, just above a whisper, he asked, "What did you have to do?"
Malfoy started, then got up and saw Harry through the glass. A smile just touched his face, but was quickly replaced by a careful neutrality. He opened the door. "Hello, Potter," he said.
"Just talk?" Malfoy was suspicious.
"Would you mind? Splendid." Arthur beamed at him and looked very much as though he was suppressing an urge to ruffle Harry's hair, for which Harry was profoundly grateful. His heart was still racing and he was feeling as conflicted and strange as he'd ever felt. A spot of silence and solitude doing something wholly menial might be just the ticket. And maybe Malfoy would come back, though he doubted it.
The Middle of Nowhere
"I will expect your full cooperation in this matter," Ginny was saying, her voice low and powerful. Far more authoritative than Harry had ever heard it. "I have your word on this, and I have held up my end of this bargain. It is your turn to act."
Malfoy stiffened. "Where?"
Janus, the caretaker, came in bearing a large portrait frame. "It's Professor Dumbledore, sir," he said, puffing under the weight of his burden. "He requested to be put back in his original spot. Said you wouldn't mind."
Malfoy gave him a strange look. "No, all we established is that you don't speak any Arabic. I can get by. Just keep your mouth closed and don't make eye-contact with anyone."
Malfoy stood quickly and walked to the island counter, his back to Harry. "I said I didn't know for sure."
"I suppose," Ginny said with great sarcasm, "that he was just so hot as a girl that you couldn't wait to get your hands on him. And then - oh, God."
"I know what 'quarterly' means," Harry said irritably.
"I would think it would have to be more elaborate than just Muggle stuff," Harry said, "given that we disguise ourselves as Muggles pretty much every day."
"Mistakes happen. Maybe that was Ollivander's influence. You know he was spy all along."
Malfoy looked around, then chose the corner of a dusty-looking burgundy velvet sofa and sat down gingerly. He said nothing, waiting.
"A couple of hours. I thought you might have just hit your head on the floor or something, but when you didn't wake up, I realised it must have been a hex or something. You don't remember?"
Malfoy sank down the wall and crawled over him, pushing Harry down on the carpet in front of the fire, his mouth already on Harry's, his tongue and lips claiming Harry's in fiercely possessive emotion. Harry's legs and arms were twined around him, moving against him and they rocked together until Malfoy reversed their positions and pulled his legs up, demanding to be fucked. There was lube nearby, and in the flickering firelight, Harry did as he was asked and revelled in the sensation of joining his body with Malfoy's, another act of trust on Malfoy's part. It felt good in every way possible - it felt right, as natural as sex with Ginny had never felt, somehow. This was powerfully intimate, too, looking down into Malfoy's open face as Harry thrust into him over and over again, and it felt intensely good physically, Malfoy's body tight around him, arching as Harry angled toward his prostate despite how recently Malfoy had come. It came upon him suddenly, the pleasure simply growing and growing until Harry was awash in it, the firelight seeming to engrave itself on his mind as he came deep within Malfoy, pushing again and again until he was completely spent.
"Most. There's a conspiracy, Remus." Harry said with strained patience. "In the Ministry. I don't know who's been paid off, but it's working. And this is not what I do. This is not what I want to do. I thought it was paperwork and a few owls and phone calls here and there. Not this."
Potter paused, and the pause gave him away. "I don't know," he said, his eyes sliding sideways across the wooden table. "I… I guess I hadn't exactly thought of it that way before."
"Sorry," Malfoy said. His tone was completely neutral, impossible to read.
Malfoy said, "… Six… seven…" and put down the panel. Without moving, he said, "I should probably watch it for a minute or so and see if it binds properly…"
Harry, his attention still on the four-year-old, remembered himself and pushed again. "Sorry, mate," he said.
Potter met his gaze. "Sometimes there isn't a 'how', I've discovered," he said. "Just do it. Come back."
Malfoy looked over at him, satisfied. "Do you want to call your people and have them take him?"
Draco thought about it, and it did. "Yes." He decided not to comment on the fact that Harry had included Ginny in the general grouping of people that he loved. Perhaps it didn't matter. He placed a hand on Harry's rib cage, not entirely certain of his verbal footing. "Maybe… it was best this way. Maybe if it had lived, it would have died in some sort of tragic accident at a young age. You don't know."
* * *
Ron set down his tray and looked back. "Why's Parkinson staring at you, mate?"
"Maybe they have better coffee."
"That's a pattern. A descending pattern with a complication about the four accounts, or does that not matter for numerology?"
"I don't have anything. Go down to the kitchen. I'm sure there's food in your dish." Harry opened the scroll. Offended, Hedwig went back to the window, probably to hunt, and gave a disdainful hoot that promised a grumpy mood for days to come. Harry closed the window and locked it again and attempted to focus on the note.
"Yes. I wish we had an inside person there, but as far as the Ministry is concerned, I'm the closest thing they have to an inside person in the Muggle financial sector."
"Another one quit today."
Potter treated him to a long, expressionless look. He'd become adept at hiding his emotions when he wanted to, Draco noticed. "I don't know why I'm even talking to you about this, unless it's because you're the only other person I know who's gone through it. I'm sure it must happen often enough, but…"
He had a long wait. Potter circled and fulfilled social obligation after social obligation. Granger was there, along with Weasley, but Granger in particular stuck rather close to Potter, to Draco's annoyance. Had he forgotten that they were supposed to be acting like friends? An hour went by and there had not even been a suggestion of eye contact. Draco's frustration turned anxious despite himself. He would not act like a clingy, desperate, jealous boyfriend. He wasn't even officially with Potter. Then he thought, officiality be damned. The kiss Potter had given him, heavy on tongue and arms, after they'd left the breakfast café the day before was not the kiss one gave a casual lover or fling. He knew that Potter cared for him rather seriously. So why this?
"Okay," Malfoy said awkwardly. There was another short pause. "Were you - you don't have to tell me this, but I just wondered - "
"How long what?"
Malfoy inclined his head. "Thanks to you, yes."
Suddenly Draco's hand was right on his penis, through the tight seaming of the crotch of his jeans. "You love this," he said, that dark sound in his tone that was only there when he was particularly aroused.
"You seem to be pretty good at picking the winning side," Harry said, not caring if it was blunt or not particularly nice.
That didn't quite correspond with what Harry knew. "What? What makes you think that I hate you?"
Malfoy made a sound which might have indicated anger, for whatever reason. "Bored?"
"I said never mind. I'm going back to sleep."
"You have it now." It was truer than he cared to let on.
"Yes, I'm coming, too." Draco pulled opened one of the doors and gestured for Potter to go first. "Shall we?"
Harry shrugged, trying to dispel the heaviness. "We didn't exactly stay in touch," he pointed out. "But we're practically neighbours now, so…"
__________________
"Just what I wanted," Draco muttered and rubbed his temples. While he knew that Potter had it exactly right in that the Auror Department did require his permission to park themselves on the Hogwarts grounds, he also knew that refusing the request would get the full might of the Minister on his case, and they weren't exactly friends now. It didn't help that Potter had married the Minister's daughter, after all. They got along when they had to, and Draco kept himself out of Ministry affairs, particularly after the divorce. Aloud, he sighed. "Fine. How long?"
"Keep talking," Harry said, ignoring this.
Draco shrugged, a sharp spike of his shoulder. He knew that Harry hated it when he was uncommunicative, but something felt particularly bruised at the moment. "What do you want me to say?"
Potter gave him a baleful look. "Right."
And when they got off the tube and walked the few blocks to the house, Harry took him upstairs to their bedroom and they spent the whole of the afternoon there together, and some layer of security that had not existed before, despite their relatively happy situation, fell solidly into place. This was life now, and it was a beautiful thing.
Draco bent a little and gave Albus' shoulder a squeeze. "See you at Christmas," he said.
Draco opened his hand for the key and Potter gave it to him. It was warm. "Whenever you're ready, dear boy," Dumbledore said. "I'll be here to meet you."
"Yes." Harry felt miserable.
Harry wiped the grit from the dirty carpet off his hands and joined Malfoy in silent surveillance. Outside, shadowy hooded figures prowled silently around, sometimes coming alarmingly close to the window. He clenched his jaw. There were too many to attack. He stole a surreptitious look at Malfoy, who was hunched forward, wand resting on his knees, watching the Death Eaters with clenched fists.
"You think so?" Malfoy repeated. His hair was all over the place, tangled from Harry's fingers. Malfoy didn't seem to notice. "If you're going to fuck me, then you'd better know what you're doing, Potter!"
"Yes," Draco said, cutting her off. "Obviously."
He wrote a brief note and left it on the kitchen table. It was inadequate in the extreme, but it was the best he could do. Then, without any sort of clear thought, he Disapparated. He went to Malfoy.
__________________
Now, they eyed each other, both smiling almost sheepishly. This was new territory. "Come here," Harry said.
Harry didn't know how to respond to that. It made sense, though. Lost in his thoughts, he barely noticed when Hermione filled his cup again and got up to put refill the kettle.
"Oh, I don't know." Potter avoided his gaze, taking another swig.
"Well, there is the war," Seamus said. "I mean, just in case you'd forgotten."
Potter's grip on his cock tightened and then he was tugging at Draco's balls, just hard enough to barely escape being painful, and that did it. Draco's breath turned to fire in his lungs and for a moment his entire body hung suspended in the heat of his orgasm. The wet rush followed, spattering Potter's torso in thick globs of white. After a second, he remembered to keep going himself, pulling at Potter's cock. Potter threw back his head and breathed deeply. There was the telltale spasm in his thighs and then he made a tight sound in his throat and thrust up once, a long, single push into Draco's encircling fist, and came.
"I was confused!" Harry said angrily. "I didn't know what it was, all right? I didn't know how I felt. As soon as I did know, I came to tell you. When I woke up this morning, all I knew was that I needed someone to talk to, and you weren't the one. Doesn't that say enough about our relationship right there?"
"Of course not," she said loftily. "Please, Harry. Look, what makes you think you might be gay?"
He looked worse than ever, the circles under his eyes deepening to full-scale valises. His hair was as unkempt as it had been during Hogwarts days, and he looked as though he'd been dragged through emotional hell and back. Draco forced himself to pay attention to the question. "Every other weekend," he said. "Sometimes more, if there's something going on. It's not completely set in stone."
"It's your call," Harry said, going with Malfoy into a darkened alley.
Potter wasted no time obeying. In seconds, he had positioned himself, then gave a long, slow push and was seated as deeply within Draco as he could be. They both moaned and Draco clenched Potter's hips with all ten fingers. Potter began to move, not quite as slowly as Draco had thought he might, but still - it was agonisingly good. Potter's cock was thick and filled him satisfyingly, hard and just brushing by the - oh - Draco gasped, red blooming behind his eyes like fire as Potter nudged his prostate. His cock grew harder even before he let go of Potter to clutch at it, pulling hard. Potter pushed impatiently at his hand. "Let me," he breathed, and Draco allowed Potter's hand to replace his. Potter matched the rhythm of his hand to the speed of his thrusting and it was already good enough to make the best fuck of his life pale in comparison. For one thing, no one else was as thorough as Potter, as concerned that he get as much out of it as possible. He'd bottomed before, but he had to be damned attracted to whomever it was if he was going to come from it. He had no doubt that Potter would see to it that he did.
They traded, pushing their respective wands across the table to each other. Harry closed his hand around the end of Malfoy's and it felt the same as it had. It tingled the way a wand should, but it didn't fit as well as his own, nor did it give him that same feeling as Malfoy's hand had. Malfoy took his and ran a finger down it. Harry's mouth seemed to fill with saliva and his mortification grew too great to bear. He reached across the table and took his wand back, his chair skittering away.
Malfoy was still looking at him as though he thought there was something wrong with Harry. He took the spoon from Harry's limp hand. "You all right, Potter?"
It was almost amusing, given Susan's position. Harry wondered if Malfoy had intended the humour. "Look," he said. "I know this is a bit strange, but why don't we go and get a tea or coffee or something? It's too late to still be working. You can catch up tomorrow."
Potter glared back. "You broke mine once," he said coolly. "It would only be fair."
Harry stood there, not sure what to say. He didn't want to leave things here before he went. "Would it help if I told you that I've never quite felt this way about anyone?" he asked softly.
Potter was there, appearing every time they got into a new frame, sometimes speaking, usually not. Once, he said, "You look like a photograph instead of a painting."
"I know," Harry said between gritted teeth. "I didn't exactly plan it, okay? Let's get out of here."
"Without fail."
"Just Malfoy. It's Ministry stuff." It was a fib, but a believable one, he hoped.
Harry's eyebrows shot up. "It is? That's… different."
Draco made a soft sound and arched up a little. "God, Harry, that - "
Harry did not say that the Ministry's security wards were not likely to have allowed private wards on top of their own. Then again, Malfoy was fairly skilled. "Party of one, is it?"
"And, more importantly, a well-executed get-away," Harry agreed.
Malfoy pulled himself into a sitting position, leaning against his desk. "I want to go home."
"Yeah, I know," Harry agreed. "Although, if you ask me, that would have made Hermione ten times worse to be anywhere near lately."
Finally, Malfoy released him. "Fuck, Potter," he muttered, not raising his voice. "That was close."
Harry gave it back with reluctance, but Malfoy screwed on the cap and stowed the bottle in a drawer. "I did say I would be home soon," Harry said, not wanting to say it.
Still feeling embarrassingly warm, Harry rubbed his knee, thinking how strange it was that it should feel so natural already. "I'm glad you trust me. And I liked you, too. I think it just took me a long time to figure that out."
Harry felt his jaw compress. "I am not the only Auror the Department has. Everyone else has had time off."
"It was nine days, and yes. They would have died if they hadn't."
It became immediately apparent: Potter was sitting at the dining table, his back to the door, with a laptop open on the table in front of him. Draco mentally registered the Muggle device and thought, of course Potter had a laptop and of course he had found a way to make it operate on the Hogwarts grounds. For anyone else, that should have been quite impossible, but of course it wasn't for Potter. Of course. He wore the same jeans and t-shirt, his right hand hovering near the sensor pad while his left… was moving rhythmically below the table. Draco's jaw dropped, eyes going to the moving images on the screen. Squinting, he could see that it was porn, any idiot could have guessed that, but he was dying to know what Potter got off to. He took a step closer, then another. If his jaw could have dropped all over again, it would have: Potter was jerking off - there could be no doubt there - to men. The images were decidedly male. It was pretty tame stuff, just a blow job, but it was good quality stuff. Potter's hand was moving in time with the hand on the giver's own cock. Draco discovered that his mouth had flooded with saliva. He could have been relishing this, having Potter completely in his power like this, but the sight of Potter watching his porn and wanking, coupled with the delicious-looking blow job on the screen, was far, far too interesting for his own comfort. Not wearing robes tonight had been a large mistake. He had not been this aroused in ages. He had to say something, before Potter came or something horrifying like that. What the hell was he supposed to say that wouldn't get him hexed? Draco cleared his throat, wand drawn in precaution.
Ginny gave her a sidelong look. "What, that Harry's not allowed to play hero for once?"
"Neither did I," Draco said dryly. "We'll find out if it actually works. This is completely experimental, and… we don't know if I'll be able to get back. So…"
"Good. They eat a lot of it here. This isn't lamb, though, if that's what you're trying to figure out. It's chicken. Come on." Malfoy had given a jerk of his head, and they were sitting down on a curb.
Malfoy regarded him for a moment, his casual air still rather forced, Harry thought. "What would you say?"
"A… boyfriend?"
"No," Potter agreed, "but less likely things have happened. It just so happens that the National Gallery is missing several of its magical subjects. Unless there are unregistered portraits floating around Britain, or elsewhere, we're missing some people, and it's… well, it's a concern."
Malfoy saw it. "What was that?"
The list compromised only people who worked specifically for the Ministry and with whom he had not yet been able to establish contact. Outside the Ministry, there were also several, but the Aurors were dealing with most of those people. Harry didn't even have a file for those ones. Peter Daley, for instance, who was referenced in another file but for whom Harry did not have a file. Harry pulled off his glasses and rubbed his eyes. It was too early to be thinking, especially when he couldn't concentrate. It felt like there was something larger that he was missing, some small thing that he couldn't put his finger on. But what was it?
Malfoy seated himself on the same stool he'd been sitting on at the counter in the kitchen the previous night and indicated a thin bundle of parchments. "Yes. It's all here. Have a seat."
"I want you," Harry said, and kissed him again, more deliberately still. After a bit, it became necessary to put the coffee down, Harry's hips trapping his forcibly against the wall, rubbing slowly. Despite his mood, Draco felt his body beginning to respond, the way it automatically did for Harry. Seven years was a long time to be with someone, after all. He had forgotten when he'd stopped wondering how much longer it would last, if each particular time they made love was the second-last or maybe even the last, before Harry would go back to his family. He'd stopped thinking that Harry would leave, but not all of the doubts had disappeared with it. But just now, he wasn't thinking of endings; he was only thinking of Harry, of this, their hard-won intimacy and fierce determination to keep it. Harry moved against him, his lips on Draco's ear, his neck, and finally his mouth again as the climax took over in hot release, first in Harry's trousers and then his own. It was not going to be the last time. This tentative balance they'd somehow managed to build with their lives was not about to collapse. Draco wasn't entirely sure that his mouth gasping against Harry's was not so much an act of love as it was of relief. And love. He could admit that to himself, could even make himself say it when it was absolutely necessary. And Harry loved him. He knew that.
"Never, Potter?"
Malfoy attacked his mouth, their cocks bumping against each other's, and Harry was all but scaling Malfoy, he was so turned on. Malfoy was panting. "Do you - " he was interrupted by Harry's mouth and gave in for a second, sucking Harry's lower lip into his mouth, teething grazing it in a way Harry's body chose to interpret as extremely erotic. "Do you know how to prepare someone?" Malfoy managed to ask, his eyes opening, serious in the dark.
"You have good sources."
Harry found himself fascinated. "Really? How? Is it registered under two different names or something?"
This seems to add to Malfoy's private amusement. "Not used to that, are you?"
Albus nodded, still looking back and forth between them. "If I had ripped the canvas, would he have been able to get out?"
Harry shrugged. "Nothing."
"Do you still see your ex-wife?"
Malfoy ignored this and sat down on the edge of the sofa, looking pointedly at the place he expected Harry to put himself. Harry shook his head but grinned and joined him.
"What?" Harry repeated, leaning over his forgotten tea toward her. "What are you saying? Has Ginny been cheating on me?"
Harry stopped. "What?" He looked back over his shoulder at Malfoy.
Harry extricated his arm and managed to nod. Without a word, he turned and went back through the crowd, concealed himself behind a car and Disapparated.
"Certainly," Fortescue said, nodding formally at Draco. "I was just saying that it's like being inside a building where the only windows are the other portrait frames. It's not all that wide, either, but that depends on the picture. Cadogan's meadow is quite spacious; I go there to keep my colour in the winter months." He ignored the other portraits' tittering and went on stiffly. "Some portraits haven't got much room at all, but it all depends on the space they were painted in."
"I suppose only time will tell." Malfoy shrugged. "When do you ever know if you spied with one hundred percent success unless your mistakes catch up with you?"
War Wounds
Harry shook his head. "It's a pretty bewildering maze of random information."
"In general, or tonight?"
Potter gave him a look of open surprise, lips parting. For a moment he seemed lost for words. "Me?"
Neither of them said a word after that. Somehow they got the blankets out from under themselves and fell asleep almost instantly.
"Harry… are you sure?" Lupin's voice was full of doubt, which only angered him further.
Brave New World
PS: Did you see the article about Potter? How the mighty have fallen! Maybe he'd finally go for you. - P
"Can you sit up?"
This was news. Then again, so was the fact that Draco Malfoy worked for the Ministry in the first place. "Okay," he said again. "So where do I come in? You think it's going to Death Eaters? How would they have gained access?"
Malfoy was still in the office, reclining in his desk chair, a bottle of amber-coloured fluid dangling comfortably from one hand. Harry knocked lightly, turning the knob as he did so. Malfoy's head turned toward him. "Clever," he said. "Had that warded just for you."
"I said, it wasn't the only time."
"That you know of."
"Come on," Malfoy pressed. "It feels warm to me. How does it feel to you?"
The stars began to fade as Harry started to get his breath back. Malfoy was leaning against him, breathing into the wall. After a bit, he straightened up. "Scourgify," he said, still panting. The wetness disappeared. It was a thorough spell, leaving even Harry's teeth feeling clean, his clothes a little crisper. He didn't quite look at Harry. "So," he said.
"I thought you thought I couldn't kill Voldemort," Harry said starkly, and felt cold in spite of Malfoy's physical warmth.
The receptionist was unfazed. "It may be that she is in a meeting, sir. If you would like to try again later - "
Harry felt his expression turn to a scowl. "Why would we need to do that?"
Harry shook his head and shrugged at the same time. "Did she tell you about the fight we had the other day?"
Potter smiled. "Okay," he said, and released Draco from his hold against the wall.
Ron came by and talked him into going for lunch. There was a sandwich place that made chicken parmigiana paninis exactly the way Harry liked them, and it was an easy sell. Upon returning to the office, pleasantly full, Harry sipped his latte and thought about going to check on the graffiti again. There was something, and it nearly made his heart stop for a moment. Panic gripped him. The writing read:
The following Friday, Potter picked him up at home in his Muggle car. He'd insisted, once he'd learned that Draco had never been in one. He'd been in magical cars on rare occasion, but they had mostly travelled by Floo and Apparition in his youth. Cars were slow and unnecessary. He approached the navy vehicle with slight apprehension and opened the door.
They were at a face-off, neither of them about to give an inch. Draco recalled his own words to Scorpius a week earlier and suppressed another sigh. Time to be the better man. "Is there anything I can do to help?" The words all but choked him.
"And you would, presumably, also be designing a way to get 'one of us' out," Draco went on, rather pointedly.
He lifted the Key. "As Headmaster of Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardy, I hereby ban you from the premises of this institution. Begone, and leave your frames no more." He spoke slowly, with unaccustomed authority, and it was almost as though someone else was speaking.
* * *
"I know," Hermione said softly. "I know all that, Harry. Especially the family stuff. I know how much you wanted all of that. When you've been through as much as you have, though, maybe it's too much to expect you to just settle down to such a stereotypical life."
"I try."
"Let's talk about it later," Neville said, glancing meaningly at Seamus.
Malfoy gave him a cool look. "Hardly," he said. "Especially as Potter's assignment was to back me up in whatever I chose, and to stay uninvolved with the decision-making."
Ginny had asked him to pick up a new pewter cauldron for the kitchen, as James had decided to try "brewing" Albus' crayons just the previous day. Harry had no idea what sort of magic could make a cauldron and some wax crayons explode that way, but it was rather beside the point now. Ginny had already replaced the crayons, so he was left with the task of going to Diagon Alley to buy another kitchen cauldron.
Malfoy refused to answer, turning his back on Harry to undress. In his briefs, he stalked over to the bathroom, but when he reached the bedroom doorway, he suddenly stopped and looked back, catching Harry's guilty eyes. He went still. "What?" he said, the word laced with something like venom.
"Fine. Thank you."
"Malfoy, actually," Harry said, but did not offer any explanation. "Long story. What do you want to order?"
"Do you have an Angus McLaughlin on your list?" Kingley's voice crackled through the magical interference.
"Potter?" Malfoy's voice was soft, as though afraid of waking him if he weren't already awake.
Harry pushed his glasses up his nose and didn't quite look at her. "I can't really talk about it," he said, looking down at his notes on the parchment. "You're right, though, something's definitely not right here."
"I can get my own," Draco said coolly. Potter knew. It was obvious. He was going to try to be nice about it, let him down gently and then tell Draco why they couldn't be friends, given the circumstances. He didn't need Potter's pity, however, and did not intend to accept it.
"Maybe next time, then. Actually, it's not very hard to make," Harry said.
Harry followed him to the oranges, thinking how strange it was to see Malfoy in such a domestic situation, picking out fruit. It barely registered as the same, pointy-faced git who had been first his rival and then his enemy. None of the remembered images lined up. He remembered Malfoy's face in the cracked mirror above the basin in the abandoned bathroom where Myrtle crooned somewhere overhead, ravaged with fear. He remembered Malfoy's hand slipping out of his grasp as the Fiendfyre raged around them in the Room of Requirement, and remembered that Malfoy owed him a life-debt. How things had changed. The fear was gone. Malfoy seemed like anyone else, if a little more snide, a little more burdened with personal baggage than the average person.
Harry lay awake for hours, trying not to let himself think things that he had no business thinking. Didn't want to be thinking. Could not think, if he wanted to keep his life the way it was. And he… did. He was fairly certain that he did. He was happy. Happy enough. Who was completely happy all the time? That was a myth.
"And my brother and Hermione got to be with you and I didn't. You've made it clear that I'm second-rate, compared to them and always have been," Ginny said.
"What is it?"
Albus gave him a disgusted look and put his crayon down. "All done," he said. Many of the paper peelings from his crayons made it into his hands and many of those made it into the trash before he stomped upstairs behind his mother. Harry sighed, picked up the rest of the peelings and went back to his own.
"I didn't catch that."
"Can I come in?" Malfoy sounded tired, too.
Harry squirmed. "I like being with you," he said evasively, uncomfortable. "I like… the stuff we do. I just don't like that." He didn't say that he was longing for a blow job, himself. How could he, when he didn't want to reciprocate? He understood that this was fair, but it didn't stop the desire. And he had hated it the two times he'd let himself be talked into it. Guilted into it, more like. It was too revolting for words. And maybe he did have a problem, because while he enjoyed the feeling of sex - which he did, a lot - he couldn't think about it while he was doing it. He always felt dirty afterward, and couldn't bear to stay in bed with Ginny, needing a shower in the worst way. He liked the thought of getting off with someone else, particularly given that it was his wife, but there was so much less drama involved in just doing it himself, in the shower. He didn't like touching her there with his fingers, either. He did like her breasts. They were small, but nicely shaped and he enjoyed them. Below the waist was another story, however. So maybe he had a problem. But he sure as hell did not want to talk about it with her, and he didn't really have any desire to make himself like what she wanted, either.
"True," Harry admitted. "Well… in that case, perhaps not." They had already been awake and talking for a bit, but it didn't matter. The Arabic equivalent of a Please Do Not Disturb sign was on the door. No one would bother them. He curled himself around Draco's body again and held him close.
Harry was left with his questions. A meeting that required the Head Auror, an Unspeakable from Intelligence, and the Minister for Magic, which could or could not involve Death Eaters. Why, then, were more of the Aurors not involved? Why such a select group? It must be highly classified, in that case. He wondered who was coming from the Department of Mysteries and abandoned the question immediately: he didn't even know any of them except Croaker, and he hadn't been seen in the Ministry building in years.
"I'm sure it would," Draco acknowledged. "Look, it'll be safer this way, that's all. We'll give them their forty-eight hours, and then if nothing happens, I'll send them away. Okay?"
Draco let their hands brush together deliberately. "Bus," was all he said.
Potter shook his head. "No. I'll go and meet him." He made for the door, then stopped. "Oh. I also need to know if there are any rooms that aren't being used right now. A classroom or something."
The bedrolls weren't exactly in a row, but scattered randomly across the floor. Neville's was closest to the window with Malfoy's the nearest to his. Then it was Harry's and Ron's, but at a completely different angle, and Seamus was somewhere near the door. Seamus switched off the light and everyone got quiet.
Harry turned back to the video and watched the numbers fly upward on the time/date stamp. At precisely five minutes past nine, Malfoy pressed a button and slowed the play to record speed. Muggle patrons formed queues in front of the automatic banking machines, the tellers, the account managers and investment personnel. It was bustling and very busy, evidently a popular time to visit the bank. Suddenly Malfoy leaned forward, his breath drawn. Harry frowned and looked harder to see what Malfoy had just seen. And then he saw it. Or rather, her. A woman in her late thirties, perhaps, with red hair drawn back from her face. She was well-dressed, and although her back was to the camera, it was too familiar. But he had to be mistaken; it couldn't possibly be the person his thoughts had so quickly pinpointed. A second later she half-turned, glancing upward as though aware that she was being watched, and Harry's suspicions were confirmed.
Everything was quiet now, whatever it had been earlier. Harry listened for a moment, then knocked. The door did not shock him. Neither did anyone answer. Perhaps Malfoy had gone home.
Area: Teamwork and Groups. Assignment: To assist your partner (Draco Malfoy) in carrying out his assignment. Details: Mr Malfoy's assignment pertains to the area of Stealth. Without lending your aid to any of Mr Malfoy's charm work or physical disguises, you are to act as the accomplice to said disguise in any way required to support its success. Your behaviour must not detract from your partner's disguise in any way, nor must it take dominance over the attempt.
"And that's why I didn't tell you," Malfoy said flatly.
"No broken dishes or public scenes?"
"It's okay."
"Not if you don't want to," Harry agreed instantly.
Harry dragged his eyes away and pretended to survey the cauldron, though he couldn't see its contents from his chair. "I… I just don't think we should," he said weakly.
The sofa was far too small for two people.
Malfoy's expression grew imperceptibly more closed. "I assume this is where you say things about your marriage and children and that we can't continue… whatever this is. That you aren't going to see me again. And so forth."
Other notes: Separated from Ministry Auror Peter Daley in Pre-War Year II, divorced War Year I. Once seen in public with Ministry of Magic custodian Iain O'Toole emerging from Knockturn Alley.
"I'm fine," Albus said. "Sorry. I wasn't careful."
His timing could not have been more perfect. They were just passing through the heavy gates of the Umayyad mosque as the calls started - a wailing chant, sung live, magnified from the four corners of the mosque's minarets, echoing off the stone. People flocking slowly toward the upper left corner to the interior of the mosque itself, to pray. Neither of them spoke. Malfoy led him slowly through the inner courtyard toward the door. Harry felt as though he were in a leisurely, unhurried dream. A flock of pigeons between themselves and the doors flew off, their wings flapping loudly and mingling with the calls. Carrying their sandals in their left hands, they passed into the mosque.
He looked at the three of them: Potters senior and junior and Draco and stopped, face wary. "Dad, I didn't have anything to do with this," he began.
"Say it, then."
Right. Harry nodded. "Sure," he said, trying to keep his voice light. "Er - just so you know, Malfoy's here."
Musing over this, he turned the corner at the end and discovered Malfoy turning a small gold cauldron over in his hands. He stopped. Malfoy hadn't seen him yet, but -
I'll see you then.
"I was there when he died," Malfoy said, his voice hollow. "I was supposed to be disguised, but he saw through it. He wasn't supposed to be able to, but he did. The fact that he recognised me was what delayed his attention long enough for someone from my team to be able to curse him. He died looking at me, knowing that I was on the side of the people who killed him. He knew, obviously, but I had never had to face him over it. Not until then."
"You strung him up from a Quidditch goal hoop." It was not a question.
"Ah!" Harry gasped. "Ohmy - do that again, whatever you just did!"
"Yeah. It's still on my phone."
"Pity your husband will have to find out this way," another of the hoods said. A heavy hand pushed Ginny down to her knees.
The clearance didn't come. In fact, nothing came, no word from any of the Order's higher-ups. Harry was getting increasingly frustrated, stuck where he was at Spinner's End. There was no news from the war front, no owls to be seen. They had no owl and no way of communicating with anyone outside. The rule during war was that if you scattered to a safehouse following a battle, you were to stay put and wait until official word came before leaving. If no word came, then after two weeks you were allowed to exercise your own judgement. As it was, Harry had no idea if anyone had traced them to Spinner's End yet. The Order had aura samples from everyone, which made tracing relatively simple - which had proven grimly convenient in the few (but painful) instances of betrayal from within the ranks.
"Are we stuck because we're surrounded, or are there other reasons, too?" Harry asked, following.
"I'm almost done," Malfoy said. "There are other things we should talk about." He paused, considering, then said, "But maybe later. After supper, maybe."
"It's okay," Draco interrupted, as Potter's cheeks were flushing. "I would have thought that, too."
Harry found himself dressed in loose, cotton trousers and an equally-loose, flowing shirt that matched. They were both black and fairly innocuous. Still no underwear, but no matter. "Thanks," he said, rather impressed. He nodded at Malfoy's jeans and designer robes. "You going to change, too?"
"Fuck off and die," Harry said evenly, keeping his eyes on the mirror. "And while you're at it, stop looking at me."
Harry spent the remainder of the evening trying not to look like he was looking for Malfoy. He didn't see him anywhere and ended up spending the evening on some of the other reports.
Malfoy's brows rose. "Interesting," he said again. "Less expected." He nodded at his son. "Scorpius Cygnus, after relatives. It's traditional in my family."
Malfoy shook his head. "Snape says it came from the Aurors."
Harry cleared his throat and looked around, but the room was empty. He hastened to the urinals and contemplated what to write in response. It seemed that the game was afoot. As he relieved himself, he pondered the possibilities, then made up his mind. He wasn't really out, per se, but the relevant people knew. And if it all came out, well, he could deny having written it, couldn't he? He went back to the sink, washed his hands, and wrote his response in extra small letters:
Scorpius gave a final sort of smile, took his trunk by the handle and turned toward the train. "Bye," he said. He didn't quite disappear in the crowd; his blond hair stood out and Draco saw him climb on board, his trunk in tow. He didn't know where Harry's kids were sitting, but if he could have hazarded a guess, James was already off with Weasley's oldest, creating havoc, and Albus was sitting somewhere quietly, possibly with Rose Weasley. He wondered if Scorpius would seek them out, or be sought out by others. So many questions, and such an open, unscripted future. He sighed.
Something about the way he said this made the hairs on the back of his neck rise, his danger senses tingling. "What's that?" he asked, his throat tightening.
"Yeah?" Harry couldn't keep the eagerness from his voice.
Harry put down the mobile. "Something's really fucked up here, but I'm not sure what."
"That doesn't exactly answer the question!"
"Stuff it, Malfoy," Harry mumbled. "I overslept."
Draco held out his hand for the champagne again. "Don't be a twit, Potter. Normal people go to Quidditch matches, correct? I'm offering. Don't take it if you don't want it. But if you do, then come. It's not complicated."
"It's always dark in here." Harry's mood was not improved by his nerves.
Harry found his report and cleared his throat. "Uh, Malfoy - with most of these things, they gave me some sort of starting point, things to check on, stuff like that. But I have nothing on you. Just your name, the date when you switched sides and so forth. I'm going to need you to go from the top."
Harry looked him for a moment. "Meaning you have a theory but don't want to say," he hazarded, watching minutely for Malfoy's reaction.
That was distracting. "I see," Harry said, squinting at the teapot.
"Bye," Harry said, but the pop of Malfoy's Disapparition meant that he'd probably missed it. Harry went upstairs, feeling horribly disappointed and empty.
Malfoy was fishing in a pocket of the robes and eventually drew out a small case. It expanded with a word and he opened it, taking out a small vial. He returned and held it out to Harry. "Basic headache potion. It might help."
At first, like always, the streets were deserted. The fire was already dying down, the house more or less demolished. In the distance, Harry could hear the sirens approaching, but it was far too late. He pushed past the Muggle neighbours, none of whom seemed to remember him. Mrs. Figg was dead now, of course, had been for years. She hadn't stayed long after Harry had moved out, anyway. Someone touched his arm.
It was Tuesday, and Harry was busy. Monday had brought another visit to Surrey to follow up, and though he hadn't found anything, it had still taken the entire day. Then the entire morning had been swallowed in the bi-weekly full Department staff meeting, followed by a somewhat mandatory lunch with Dawlish and Jones-Peyton to discuss the case in Northumberland, and now he was struggling through a stack of file work that hadn't been done before the weekend, as it should have been. He was glad that it kept him in his office, and he'd been ignoring his phone whenever possible. And hoping Malfoy wouldn't call, because he had no idea what to say to him.
"I know." Tonks sounded unhappy. "I mean, I don't even know him very well, which I'm sure is how he wants it, given my background and such, but it still concerns me. If only for the Ministry's sake. He's one of the very best in his field, and we can't really afford to lose another potions expert."
It wasn't true. Hermione liked to say that it was, that they were too similar, but Harry had known in his gut that they were far more different than either of them had thought back in sixth year, when it all started. In fact, they grew so far apart that Harry sometimes thought he barely knew Ginny any more. She had stopped playing Quidditch when they found out she was expecting James, and it was not until the year after Lily had been born that Ginny had started working for the Ministry. She had done a year of Auror training, starting when Hermione had done so, after they'd finished their seventh year and taken their NEWTs. They'd joined together and quit together, Hermione going directly into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, while Ginny quit the training program to start one of her own in preparation for the Harpies try-outs. She loved the kids, Harry knew, but had probably been dying of boredom stuck at home all the time. He could understand the jealousy of the media attention, even if he thought it was stupid. "The grass is always greener," he'd said once with a shrug, a thoughtless comment that had cost nearly a week of icy silences and spurts of wrath before he'd been forgiven. She'd taken a junior position under Hermione, who by then was high up in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Harry had been glad that she'd found a position she liked enough to stay in, but he was often not permitted for security reasons to talk about his work with her, which eliminated one of the few civil areas of conversation they seemed to have left by then.
"Of course. Those fit all right?" Malfoy studied Harry, who tried not to flush under the scrutiny.
Malfoy did not point out that he couldn't, at least not without sifting through Harry's own memories and Dumbledore's first. "That won't unmake them," he said quietly.
Draco's glass was still half-full. "Are you leaving?" The question slipped out before he could catch it.
Malfoy nodded, looking both miserable and angry.
"The same," Potter said. "So, Tuesday - where should I meet you?"
"I don't mean to jump on you," Lupin went on. "I just don't want you starting to see enemies everywhere. And I know that you're investigating and you need to be aware of the details and possible connections, but remember, your job is mainly to prove people's alibis and help clear their records. The Aurors will catch any wrong-doers."
Malfoy shrugged, at his most closed-off. "We'll see," was all he would say.
"Nothing," Harry said dispassionately. "Why don't we start with your Mark."
Harry thought about it and shrugged. "Wasn't planning to. Why?"
"Whereabouts?"
"Ron still sleeping?" Seamus asked.
"I don't know," Harry said. "Do you think they know we're here?"
"Pansy. I just got home, and I just stepped out of the shower."
Harry hesitated. "Take care of yourself."
"It was only a suspicion."
Harry's face warmed again. "That was your first one?"
Their hands massaged through trousers, and when Potter got down on his knees, Draco conveyed his appreciation (albeit silent) by combing rough fingers through Potter's hair. It was perfect. That elusive thing he'd never known he'd been looking for, under his nose for the past sixteen years. Later, as he returned the favour, he had time to notice that, while he'd enjoyed giving head before, he'd never wanted so much to do something for another person. Strange that that person was Potter, but there it was.
They were both hard, a fact that had made itself known on the stairs already. Malfoy let go of him and they faced each other for a moment. "Are you ready for this?" Malfoy asked, angling his chin forward as though in challenge.
So much for his face not giving him away. Harry could feel it flaming. "What rumour?" he tried, but even drunk, he could hear how pathetic it sounded.
"I think I do," Malfoy said, watching him closely.
Malfoy gave him a disgusted look. "There's a bedroom," he said, not bothering to hide the contempt. "One bedroom."
"I know. I know that's probably why," Harry said. "I'm just upset. It always seems so real. And on top of that, I need to break up with Ginny and I feel like I don't know who I am or what I want any more, and I don't know what to do."

"Bones?"
Potter glanced at a clock on the wall. "Almost eleven."
"Might as well get it over with." Malfoy stood, straightened his robes, and went to the door. When he reached it, he turned back for a moment. "Uh - Potter - "
He could be intensely stubborn at times. Harry met Ginny's eyes. "It's not a choice," she told him shortly. "Harry, soon would be good. Ron and Hermione are coming over after supper, remember?"
Subject: [none]
"I… well, there's been a lot of stuff, Dad," Scorpius said, stuffing his hands into the pockets of his robes. "It's always something with him. And he just gets on my nerves."
He sounded very calm on the surface, but Harry glanced at him a few moments later and noticed that Malfoy's fingers, clutching the handle of his umbrella, were trembling. He took a deep breath. "Um. I didn't mean to be so vile about it," he said eventually. "Or rude, I mean. I just wasn't expecting that."
"She… wouldn't want to know?" Draco asked carefully.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows. "Who do we trust?"
Malfoy did not attend the trial. Harry heard a rumour that he had not been at any of the trials other than those at which he was required to give testimony. As for his own, Harry had been there. Malfoy had been tried along with his parents, and in light of his father's sins, both his and Narcissa's had faded utterly into the background. Both had been released without sentence. Harry had provided the details of Malfoy's refusal to identify himself, Ron, and Hermione to the Wizengamot before the trial had begun, and knew that it would factor into the sentencing. Lucius had died in Azkaban years later. Harry had never known the precise reasons why, had never asked.
"It's called a joke," Malfoy interrupted, impatient. "You twat. I know that. Your wife died a year ago, and you're Harry Potter. I can't imagine you letting go just like that. Besides, you're far too tense to pass as someone who was getting it on a regular basis. Anyway, this topic is a little too personal. Do you want to talk about something else?"
"I don't know," Potter said. "I don't want you coming with some girl just to keep up appearances, though."
Memory filtered back, delaying him temporarily. His recollection of the previous night was only a little fuzzy. He remembered quite well what had happened. It began to sink in. He looked instinctively for Malfoy, knowing already that he wasn't in the room. He was right; Malfoy was nowhere to be seen. He had no idea what he was supposed to say to him, or what Malfoy was going to be like.
"Four whole days and no mistakes yet." Malfoy sounded justifiably proud.
Still looking away, his throat still tight, Harry said without hope, "It could just be a coincidence."
Harry shrugged. "Could have been worse, I guess. He was… well, he was his charming self. Pure snark. But a bit of honesty."
"Certainly not. I had higher hopes, but you disappointed me in the least of these." Lucius sniffed.
"I know Potter," Draco said briefly. "Just do it. If we don't, he'll just make himself an even larger nuisance."
The taste in his mouth was bitter. "Not exactly," Harry said tersely. "As you said. I've got some thinking to do."
"Sure," Harry said. "Right. Well then, thanks again, and call me as soon as you can, okay?"
"All right."
"I completely fail to understand how your assignment requires you to go to a ball."
Malfoy responded in embarrassed fashion, holding Harry firmly against himself. "I don't think I care what we do. I just know that I want it to be with you."
"And you just - " Hermione shook her head as if to clear it. "Tell me more about it."
"Right." Potter reached for it. "On three?"
"Well, I - " Harry began, but Malfoy cut him off.
"Good man, Malfoy." Shacklebolt opened a three-ring binder and turned paper, rather than parchment, pages. Moody consulted his own small notebook. "All right, then. Let us begin. All in all, Malfoy, you're a very strong candidate. I think you know that."
Christmas? Draco glanced at his desk calendar; it was only November twenty-eighth. "You're going to be here for a month?" He didn't attempt to hide the dismay.
"Who caught you?"
Potter actually laughed, and was as surprised by it as Draco was. He didn't say anything, but Longbottom glanced at him again and began to slide around the table.
"Potter is already talking to Dumbledore, who, despite his own painful death, has already been searching the portraits," Draco said nastily. "However, good as he was, he's elderly and suggested to Potter that we appoint someone to lead the forces of the portrait subjects, should they need to fight."
Potter went quiet, watching the top pull out and re-enter the blond from a different angle. They were clinically clean and hairless, every pore buffed and waxed and gleaming, but they were both impressively endowed and Draco could practically feel the brunet's cock in him. Potter was exhaling through a tight jaw and Draco sneaked a look southward. Potter's hand was creeping toward himself, but he was holding back. And suddenly Draco didn't care what happened. He reached behind himself and found Potter's right wrist and in a lightning-swift move, brought it around to cup his stiff cock through his trousers. They both moaned at the contact and Potter didn't fight to break it, as Draco had mostly expected. His fingers dug in, curling around Draco's balls, his palm pushing into Draco's erection. Draco was still holding his hand in place, and tilted his hips backward, rubbing against Potter's front. The on-screen pair stopped to turn the blond onto his back while the brunet repositioned himself again. Draco undid the button and zip of his trousers with his left hand and Potter's hand got itself inside without any persuasion. His warm hand was pushing elastic out of the way and then his fist was closing around Draco's cock. There wasn't any lube and it was a little rough, but Draco didn't care. He pushed his trousers down to expose his arse, still tight after all these years and turned his head to the side. "Open your jeans and rub against me," he growled.
"And that's why I have friends, idiot," Harry said gently. He came to stand behind Draco, slipping his arms around him. "And the Weasleys. They've asked us for Christmas, you know. Both of us."
Harry made no response. "Ten Privet Drive."
"Not all of them. There's one I've been saving," Harry murmured, his warm mouth working its way down to his collar, back to his earlobe, sucking lightly.
"Yes, I'm well aware of that."
"Would help if you could get online," Tonks remarked. "Let's go find an internet café, then."
Malfoy looked surprised for a fleeting second. Then his expression shuttered and he shrugged, aloof. "I thought it was perfectly mutual."
He strode into the office from his tower quarters and discovered only one parent seated in the visitors' chairs. Joy of joys, it was Potter. Foregoing small talk, he pulled his chair out and sat down. "The letter specified both parents, I believe," he said stiffly.
Malfoy tapped a quill on the parchment. "What we have got," he said, "is another transfer. Exactly when we were there."
Maybe he should email Potter. Draco felt his face twist in something that wasn't quite humour at this ridiculous thought, and reopened one of the client emails to begin formulating his response.
Draco ran a comb through his still-damp hair and attempted to make himself stop smiling, but it was difficult to maintain the act if he so much as thought of Potter. Speak of the devil. Potter appeared in the mirror behind him and walked over, smiling. He pressed a kiss to Draco's neck, just below the ear. "You smell delicious."
"I know."
Harry shook his head and winced as his brain sloshed in a most disturbingly painful manner around inside his skull. "No. I don't remember anything after… well, it's hard to say. I don't even know who I was fighting with, what with the hoods. I think Neville was somewhere close by, and maybe Hermione."
Harry had already tuned him out. Death Eaters. His suspicion was confirmed. Why would they attack Vernon and Petunia Dursley, of all people? The only answer was unpleasant: revenge. Who else would they attack, then, if it was revenge against Harry?
"I'm not," Seamus said immediately.
He woke up disoriented and not sure where he was. A face full of blond hair helped explain rather more quickly than his brain could deal with first thing in the morning, forcing Harry to take rapid stock of his situation. He was in bed with Malfoy. He had his arm around Malfoy, decidedly more tightly than it had been when he'd fallen asleep. In fact, he was glued to the length of Malfoy's back, right down to his… Oh, God, Harry thought. Too far. He jerked himself away from Malfoy in horror and turned over, hoping desperately that Malfoy was asleep and hadn't noticed.
The storm was moving off toward Lebanon. "Good night," Malfoy said abruptly, rolled over and appeared to go to sleep.
Malfoy shook his head. "You can't Obliviate a goblin, Potter. I told you that. And slim to none, on the questioning. That would mean revealing that we were there, and goblins are protective enough that we would be slapped into Azkaban before we could blink. And personally, I have no plans to spend the rest of my natural life doing just that, so let's think of something else."
Harry looked. It was a kindly-looking middle-aged woman, holding a tissue to her nose. "I don't think there could be anyone left alive," she said gently, grimacing from the acrid smoke.
"Well, who sends you these read-outs? Can't you get the info from them? Tell me you have a mole inside Gringotts, Malfoy."
Harry blinked. Looked at Malfoy, who shrugged as if to say that they were Harry's friends and not to expect him to know what to make of them. Then he smiled. "Well, good, then. No issues."
"I don't really get what you're saying," Harry said, frowning back at her.

"You didn't hear?"
"We should talk some more," Malfoy said. It came out quickly, sounding rehearsed, and Harry noticed that the set of his shoulders was rather stiff.
Later, Hermione and Malfoy were fighting through the crowd to get back to the bar and Ginny had taken herself to the ladies'. Harry slid around to the other side of the table to sit beside Ron. Ron still had half a pint in front of him and was gazing fixedly at something across the room. Harry bet he could guess. "Stop staring, mate," he said good-naturedly, but there was something very small that did bother him about it.
Harry winced and didn't answer.
It was Malfoy. Their eyes locked. Harry pushed James' swing, but he was a little late and the push was feeble. Harry managed a nod in Malfoy's direction. He was too far away to really say anything without shouting, but it seemed rude not to acknowledge him somehow. Malfoy gave him a cool nod in return, then turned back to his small son.
Harry suddenly didn't know what to say. How did one explaining appearing at someone's door at five in the morning? "Er - hi," he stammered, feeling like an idiot.
"Dudley? I doubt it. He didn't think so, but who knows?" Harry found the remote and turned on the TV.
"I know," Potter admitted, though Draco hadn't really said anything. "I feel in my gut that it will work, though."
"I am," Potter said. "I know the history between you two, but as it happens, I trust your father and I therefore trust you. I'm going to be watching what happens in the portraits from this side, and I would like to know that someone whose word I can trust will be watching over my son. I know that you have a powerful rivalry, but I also know what kind of passion drives it. Your father and I had it, too, and it ended up serving us well during the war. We saved each other's lives."
"Okay. Fine. Are you still going to walk me to George's?" Potter's eyes glittered in the dark. Perhaps it was just the light on his glasses, but there was a glint of something there that sharpened Draco's senses despite the gin.
Harry concentrated. "Accio blanket," he repeated, straining his energy toward the blanket. His summoning spells only worked sometimes at the best of times, and that was when he had been eating. The blanket twitched, then lifted and skittered over the floor until it was beside the sofa.
The young man held out a hand. "James MacDougall."
Dean's birthday celebration took place in a pub that Seamus had picked, which meant that Ginny found it far too loud and went home early, relieving the sitter. Since she was full of nothing but catty remarks about Dean's wife anyway, Harry was just as glad. Many of the wives had gone home, Hermione included, and as it was Friday night, Harry didn't have to work the next day and could stay late. He didn't know a lot of Dean's work friends, but it was still fun. Ron was in the corner, singing lewd songs with Seamus and Lee Jordan. Harry got up and wandered over to the bar to get another drink.
Malfoy got up and came around the desk. "You're the only friend I have," he said.
"Do you want to get up?" Draco asked serenely. "We hardly have a schedule to keep."
Malfoy looked rather smug. "I'd tell you, but I'd have to kill you."
The glance had the effect of making Harry feel very naked, and suddenly he was self-conscious. He'd barely thought about his body, about changing in front of other people, or any of the related issues in months. Maybe even years. But Malfoy had always made him feel like a loser. He thought of his bony ribs and body hair and wondered if his build was completely awkward and disproportionate. At least he was fit. He knew that much. Trying not to squirm, he said, "Well, what I am supposed to do, then?"
"Damned straight."
"Some. Enough. Come on, let's go shopping." Malfoy was twirling the room key around.
"I'm going to." Potter got up and stripped. It took seconds and while Draco's brain was catching up with the glorious sight of Potter fully nude and sporting an erection to keep him hoarse for days, he managed to get his own clothing off, kicking it to the side before Potter attacked with his hands and mouth - hands on Draco's cock and arse, respectively, mouth on his neck. His cock was heavy and warm in Draco's hand, the delicate skin pulsing and sliding the way it should as he stroked. Potter was as sure of himself in this as he had always been on the Quidditch pitch, as he was while striding around the Ministry, as Draco imagined him in interrogations. He was masterful, and he was so clearly in charge that Draco silently surrendered the lead and let Potter have his way.
"Well, that's what it looks like," Harry said. "But what if they're just really bad at returning calls and there's a completely reasonable explanation for this?"
"Slightly. But necessary. Come on, Potter, haven't you ever seen a CIA movie? Those people act like there are no rules at all."
The office at the far end still had a light on, though it was just a desk lamp. Otherwise, it was dark. Harry could see a figure bent over the desk, longish hair falling forward over the face. He hesitated, then walked the length of the corridor and knocked at the door.
Draco shook his head. "No. But I've heard the trick is to just figure out the rhythm and go with it. I don't think it should be difficult. Tourists ride camels all the time."
"Yes."
"I couldn't."
Harry felt a rush of apprehension. What if he spent time with Malfoy and couldn't stop thinking about… it? What if Malfoy tried something else? He caught himself. Was he really that insecure about it all? Harry frowned. "Sure, no problem. Maybe in fifteen? I just have a couple of things that need finishing. The rest can wait, I guess."
Harry sagged with disappointment and went to sit on his own bed. Flopping backwards onto it, he went over what had just happened. All right. So, he'd felt whatever that had been with Malfoy back at the mosque. They'd kissed. He'd been very happy about that. They'd come back to talk and had ended up kissing again. They'd both gotten hard during it, and Malfoy had freaked out.
Draco grasped after his ability to speak. "My fault?" he repeated, licking his lips. "I really don't see how - "
"Why not?"
"Oh." The heat was returning.
"Fuck." Malfoy's eyes closed, his mouth open, and he rubbed harder, his wrist jerking back and forth with in rhythmic precision.
For Coffeejunkii
She gave a mournful hoot, eyes round and amber and full of apology.
He came to no conclusions, but by the time the light had begun to creep across the eastern skies, Harry finally fell asleep.
"What?" Scorpius looked at Potter senior. "Are you serious?" His face was all pointed angles and full of questions.
Draco closed his eyes briefly and counted to three. "There may be. What do you need it for?"
I'll be back later. I promise. Be back soon.
He didn't answer this, going into the kitchen instead. Opening the refrigerator, Harry took out a loaf of French bread, half of a red onion, a jar of minced garlic, and a small tomato. Ginny stood behind him as he reached for the olive oil and a small bowl. He poured in a little of the oil, then went back to the fridge for basil. He cut some of the onion into very small squares and put them in the oil, then chopped the basil and added it.
"Propinquity," Draco supplied.
The headline was in letters as large as those they'd once used for Potter in the days before the war and subsequent vindication, and were so clearly thrilled to have something to write about Potter again, at last, that they simply couldn't resist the urge to use a font quite that large once more. The pictures were blurry and did not quite focus (proof of the dodginess of the story in the first place, but who would care, given what the headlines said?), but it was assuredly Potter and he was assuredly embracing another male in a manner suggestive of rather more than platonic involvement.
Harry put both hands on his shoulders and bent to kiss him for a long moment, Malfoy clutching at his sides. He drew back gently. "I'll see you in five. I'll have that seat for you."
"You're sure you have to do this."
Potter shook his head. "Maybe we needed this much time for it to work. It's all going to be good now. Come on, let's go and pry our sons apart long enough to tell them."
Harry debated for a moment, chewing his lip. "Can we talk about it tomorrow?"
Malfoy snickered. "I had too much work to do. No rest for the wicked and all."
Harry knelt between Malfoy's feet and looked up at him, meeting his gaze in wordless answer.
Harry shook his hand. It was warm and very smooth, and for a moment he was tempted to ask Malfoy what he put on his hands to make them that way. He abandoned the thought, though, and just shook. "Any time."
* * *
Harry established that he had regained his balance, relaxed, smiled uncertainly and held out the pen. "Hello."
"Twat," Malfoy said, mildly. He reached out and casually got his hand around Harry's stiffening cock through his trousers. "I'd say it's you who can't resist me."
He had to tell her. It would be horrible, but he had to do it. He took a very long, very hot shower, and was both miserable about his unfaithfulness and his apparent gayness, but beneath that, somehow strangely content about the fact that it had been Malfoy. The act itself, in isolation, he could not make himself regret. Were he there again, he would still do it. Harry faced this thought rather soberly, rinsing the shower gel off himself, the stickiness finally dissolving, and knew for certain that his days in this flat were numbered.
It was getting to the point where they were going to say things that could not be taken back. Harry knew this, felt the thin ice. It was too late to turn back now, though. "What is that supposed to mean?"
"Sounds good."
"Six days is too long," he said, and put his hands on Harry's hips and his mouth on Harry's. Everything slid into place for Harry again, a completion he hadn't realised he was missing until very recently. The warmth surged through his chest and he engulfed Malfoy with his arms, pressing his hips, his stomach to Malfoy's as they kissed. Malfoy's arms were around him, too, moving down his back to his arse to hold him even closer. Harry's mouth was open against Malfoy's, but this time he was the first to stretch out his tongue to touch Malfoy's, and the touch sent a strong tendril of desire directly to his cock. He could feel it hardening against Malfoy's, and Malfoy was moving in rhythmic circles against him. His hands were on Harry's face again, far more tender than anything Malfoy had ever said to him. It had the effect of making Harry feel so very important to Malfoy, and the thought warmed him still more.
Harry could not answer. He gripped Malfoy's hand with his fist, though whether that was intended to remove the offending hand or - he winced - tighten the hold, he could not have said. Also, he couldn't deal with Malfoy's wildly varying moods - this Malfoy bore no resemblance to the Malfoy of the night before, broken and vulnerable. This Malfoy was seductive and entirely in control, unless Harry could assert himself more convincingly.
Harry thought of Kingsley and felt a weight like lead settle in his chest. No. Surely not Kingsley. He must have asked the wrong person something he shouldn't have when he'd been poking around. "I don't know," he said heavily. "But there are whole sections of the house that no one ever uses. We can't afford to heat it all, so some sections have been closed off. We can make some temporary wards while we figure things out."
"God." Harry could barely speak, but his hips obeyed Malfoy as though under the Imperius curse, pulling back just as slowly, in equally agonising withdrawal. Malfoy was hard, his cock straining against his stomach, and Harry wanted to touch it, grip it in the same grip that Malfoy's body had around his. He was occupied with holding himself up, but it was a relief when Malfoy's hand strayed to his cock, a fist closing around it. His head was thrown back against the pillow, eyes closing in silent sensation. Harry thrust forward again and Malfoy moaned along with Harry. The lube was warm and slick between them and Harry could not think of anything except that he liked this more than anything he had ever done and already knew that he was going to want it again and again and again.
Harry couldn't bear it. He would have walked, but he had to get away. He Disapparated.
"What?" Malfoy didn't raise his head.
"Good thing," Harry said. He waved to the boys, his stomach full of knots. "See you two later. Don't make a mess with those," he added to James, who had just pulled out Albus' new box of crayons.
The rage was building. "Since when has it become law to be Potter's friend?" Draco bit out, hardly able to get the words out through his wrath. As if Potter was truly capable of fucking up his life even like this. It was beyond belief. Since when were his personal preferences as far as other people were concerned related to his certification in any way whatsoever?
"Not here," Malfoy breathed. "It'll have to wait."
"Predictable question, Potter."
Received: 8:53am, Friday, 9. May, GMT
"Let's get started," Kingsley said, and Harry's attention snapped back into focus. Kingsley steepled his fingers and launched in with his usual direct manner. "It has come to my attention that some figures from the Department of Treasury have not been lining up. As you may or may not know, Harry, a certain margin of error is expected and allowed in any branch of finance. However, it seems that there has been a pattern developing. Certain figures are routinely out, and now that we've noticed, we see that they've been out for years. The Ministry has been losing money, tiny bits of money which, when added up, make for rather a lot of it. I want to know where it's going, and to whom."
Harry gave him a sharp look. "Is that so? Well, you can tell Kingsley that his people missed another one, then. Better yet, tell him that he can go and look to see if, whoops, he missed another rogue Death Eater break-out. I'm tired of this."
Malfoy looked up. "Let's not, then."
Malfoy was still there, as Harry had suspected he would be. All the corridor lights had dimmed, and there was only a reading light on in Malfoy's office. Harry could see him from the end of the hall between the slatted blinds, sitting at the desk, reading. The soft light illuminated the hollows of his cheekbones and made his face even more angular. Like a carving or something, Harry thought, but warmer. He gave himself a shake and knocked at the door.
"Uh, I think so," Harry said, a frisson running through his spine at the implication.
"What makes you say that?"
* * *
"No," Malfoy said musingly, staring into one of the small tea lights. "It's… not the easiest thing to bring up. Might as well get it out, I guess."
Harry let go of the towel and reached for the jeans. "God forbid," he muttered, and Malfoy actually gave a short laugh. The jeans fit snugly, but they fit.
Draco observed him with undisguised curiosity. He'd never thought of it that way. His entire life, he'd thought of Potter as an attention-seeking prat who was never satisfied unless he was in centre stage, full spotlight, all too happy to establish the image of the lone boy hero, saviour of the world as everyone knew it. He knew it just as surely as he knew, in some secret, scarce-acknowledged place that his lifelong dislike of Potter had far more to do with the latter spurning his friendship than it had to do with politics. So Potter hated the interviews and the attention. He made himself respond automatically. "So, do you?" he asked, intending it to be humorous.
He found Malfoy in the library, writing something in a notebook and apparently unaware of Harry's presence. Harry found himself somehow annoyed by this. "Malfoy," he said sharply.
Apparently still not worn out from the thankless and demanding job of being Minister for Magic, Kingsley often came by to consult Harry, give him information, request Auror presence somewhere, or even give Harry himself an assignment in the field. They were rumoured to be close, and they were. During that tumultuous time after Voldemort's fall, Harry had enrolled himself in Auror training with Ron and Neville, not bothering with his NEWTs and somehow become immediately embroiled in helping set up a new government along with Kingsley, Arthur Weasley, and an Unspeakable named David Croaker. Croaker still ran the Department of Mysteries and oversaw the Unspeakables, many of whom worked in such mysterious capacities that no one even knew them as Ministry employees. As a rule, they were seldom seen in the public eye; they were furtive and kept to themselves. Croaker himself was the most tight-lipped of them all, rarely appearing at Ministry inter-departmental meetings and usually sent messages by owl or other, less expected channels. He had provided Kingsley with amazing bits of information about how the Ministry building itself worked from time to time, enough to give Harry the firm impression that the Department of Mysteries was about a lot more than studying weird branches of magic. They had spies in the Muggle world, all over it, they controlled the Ministry building, and they ran an intelligence network so vast that many of its branches were wholly unconnected and spying on one another in other capacities. The overall experience of helping set up the new regime had made Harry vow to avoid politics at any cost, quite relieved to be allowed to return to and finish his Auror training unimpeded. Consequently, it had taken him a year and a half longer than Ron and Neville, and he'd been lonely without them.
"Pick somewhere."
Harry drank his wine, thinking that he'd drunk too much of it already. "Whatever you like."
"I know." Malfoy sounded amused. "I - well, I didn't watch, but I - uh - I heard it, and it sounded like he was - rather talented," he said, embarrassed.
"You make a really hot girl," Harry said, aware that he sounded like a moron. "I hope that's not - I mean, you do. Have you really never dressed this way before?"
He got a roomful of sorrowful headshakes and murmured negations. "They haven't been up here," Phineas Nigellus informed him. "Surely even you believe that we would have notified you or the Headmaster if they had."
He wasn't sure, but damned if he was going to tell Malfoy that. Not as long as he kept acting like not a thing had happened four nights earlier. "He'll come," he said without conviction.
Harry let his arms collapse and settled onto Malfoy, claiming his mouth again. Malfoy put his arms around Harry's neck and shoulders and they kissed for a long time, unwinding together. Harry's limbs slowly relaxed and he felt enormously content. Eventually, he rolled off Malfoy and settled himself beside him.
"Have to. You have no idea how snubbed people get when I don't show up for whatever charity ball they're throwing. Especially if I come without a date." He rolled his eyes.
Rage was beginning to seep through Harry's veins. To betray someone on your own team like that, where it could have easily resulted in Malfoy's death - "Who was on your team?" he demanded.
Harry took it, not looking him in the eye. "Thanks," he mumbled. He tapped a large drop of oil onto the tip of his finger and dabbed it onto his skin, aware that Malfoy was watching him. Malfoy, who wasn't interested in him and never had been and even if he had, wasn't any more upon his discovery that no sex for months meant sometimes a bloke got off a little too fast. Even if by "sex" he only meant those extremely infrequent fumblings of hand jobs from strangers. Harry glared down at his own skin and wished Malfoy were just about anywhere else. What right did Malfoy have to be watching him if he was so virulently uninterested, anyway? Then Harry got it - Malfoy just wanted to make sure he wasn't going to use too much of his precious rose thorn oil. He corked it and handed it back, still not looking.
He looked up to find Malfoy watching him, and realised that he'd missed something. "Sorry?" he said, pushing his glasses up his nose.
There was nothing subtle about the sensation when it came to feeling it face-to-face, though. Harry had been all too aware, short as it had been, of Malfoy's latent power meeting and struggling with and balancing his own even in that short kiss. It wasn't about gender. It was only the balance that had caught Harry's attention. Or so he was trying to tell himself. He was aware that Malfoy was an attractive man, at least to women and a particular sort of men. Not to Harry personally, of course, but in an abstract sense, certainly. The realisation had hit hard upon physical contact, though. He was trying valiantly not to think of it.
Harry stared into the dark above his face. "Sure. You don't think it's something Dark, do you?"
"That so," Malfoy drawled. "Do tell."
Harry was still, thinking it over. Eventually he said, "I don't think I want to be alone."
"I don't know. No. Probably not. Why?"
Harry summed up the situation: he was alone in a foreign country with only his wand, dressed in pyjama pants and a robe. He had nothing else. No money, no identification, no underwear. The situation Kingsley had always told them to be constantly prepared for, only he'd never actually been in such a ridiculous position before. It was obvious that he was entirely at Malfoy's mercy.
Angry, he didn't say. Though it would have been true. "Fine," he said evasively. "How's… do you have… anyone… right now?"
"Morning." It was grudging and barely audible, but Neville looked at Malfoy with surprise, seeming pleased.
Harry's back dipped, arched up again as he pushed back. "… God…" he panted, his voice utterly hoarse.
Draco fell silent, watching him. Eventually Potter put the mug down. "I'm sorry," Draco said.
* * *
"See you then." Harry rang off.
She exhaled. "Better late than never. Maybe this will make it easier to move on, if I'm not waiting for something that's never going to happen any more."
Draco nodded in Potter's direction. "Take care of yourself," he said coolly.
"Well, as I'm not dead and no one has painted a portrait of me just yet, I fail to see how that would be possible," Draco shot back. "If that were possible, I'm sure that Potter would have been drawing pencil sketches of me to have animated already."
"In excess? No."
"I owled you, but it came back with the letter," Ron said. "Which safehouse? Devon's gone now, and so is Northumberland."
got an E and he's mad! He says I cheated but he's just jealous.
"I thought we had, too." Neville was still apologetic. "I just thought, you know it better than I do, and…"
"The law, last I checked, isn't a huge fan of homosexuals," Potter said dully. "She'd use that against me. If she wasn't concerned about the kids. I told you she was going to let me see them."
Potter shrugged. "Same." He unbuttoned the top button of his shirt and loosened the bow tie. "God, I hate those things."
"You'd better let me talk to her first. I have a hunch it'll be ugly."
"Draco," he began.
Draco shrugged. "I have a son, too."
"I'm splendid, thank you," Malfoy said, looking pained at Harry's awkwardness. "Best two weeks I've ever had."
"And even if she had, why men, Potter? I'm sure you didn't just wake up gay one day. Tell me you weren't trying just a little too hard to make it all work. But it didn't work, did it?"
Was Malfoy blushing? His expression looked relaxed enough, but Harry was enough of a body language reader to see that Malfoy wasn't particularly at ease. "Yes," he said. "I guess it does."
Harry was certain. "Yes."
The breath released slowly. "Will you be okay if I go?"
After a few minutes, Draco had looked in every frame on the east and south walls. Potter joined him and ran a hand through his hair in frustration. "Gone," Draco said.
Jackson Crosby
"I'm no woman, Potter." Malfoy's eyes were sharp.
Name: Iain O'Toole
Malfoy had taken him into the very heart of the souq, past it to the edges of the mosque's outer courtyard. He'd spotted, to his obvious delight, a small vendor selling pomegranate juice from a small cart. Harry watched in fascination as two pomegranates were crushed, their juice squeezed out into a plastic cup. It was given to Harry. He went to pay, but Malfoy reached him first. "My treat," he said.
They were both breathing hard, trying to collect themselves and figure out what the hell to say now. "I guess I'd call that adequate payback for the interruption," Potter finally said, panting. "God, Malfoy. I had no idea."
"You got off lucky, scum," Malfoy sneered. "I wouldn't have been so merciful, if I had only been a little quicker. You're lucky Potter didn't allow you a trial - you'd have got the Dementor's Kiss from any jury."
Kingsley hesitated. "We thought that a smaller number might be better, and your stealth skills are really quite - "
"Get on with it, then," Draco said, his throat tight.
He made it without incident. The wards around Malfoy's office shimmered slightly, but Harry didn't get a shock when he gingerly reached past them to knock.
Potter shook his head. "I don't know where you got the idea that you can just assume you know these things about me," he said, and Draco wasn't sure whether he'd stopped being angry or if he'd given in. "You have no right to say these things as though you know me, know my marriage."
"Not as much as Ron did," Hermione said, rolling her eyes, but her smile was indulgent, and Malfoy snorted.
"What?" Draco looked up. There had been a longish silence, and his attention had wandered.
Malfoy gave him a bland smile. "I don't really do polite."
His wards chimed. Harry looked at the clock. It was five-thirty in the morning. There was only one person it could be, and while he did not want to see Malfoy, he was tired of his own thoughts and interpretations of this. He weighed the decision for a moment, then sighed and wandlessly released the wards, going to the door.
Harry looked at him, startled at this unexpected parallel, but Malfoy had already turned toward the fireplace, reaching for Floo powder, and did not appear to notice Harry's reaction. Harry swallowed and went to stand by him. "Where first?"
"It's a new world out there," Malfoy said, reading through the lengthy comments at the bottom of Hermione's file. "It's not open war and it's not peace."
Harry turned on the taps, his hands shaking. He still hadn't responded to the last bit of writing since two days before. He didn't know what to say. He tried not to look at it. He finally had tried to remove the writing, and it was every bit as impossible to remove as the custodians had evidently found.
Fortescue looked blank. An even older former Headmaster, Fernworth, chipped in wheezily. "It's just dark. There's nothing, until you get into the next picture."
Ping. "Yes, sir?" came Cynthia's voice.
For Emma Grant
Malfoy took it. "What happened to your forehead?"
"Do you remember the tall Swedish bloke?" Malfoy asked suddenly, out of the blue.
Draco bent low over him without missing a beat, hips pumping forward into Harry over and over again. "How does it feel?" he asked, his own voice rough, short of breath.
Potter clambered onto him, straddling Draco's waist, and bent to kiss him again. As usual, it got rather quickly more involved and the uncomfortable conversation dissipated into a far more pleasant blend of pleasure and what Draco suspected might be an emotion he had yet acknowledge to himself. They were together. They were what they were, and all was well.
"A sex life?" Malfoy filled in, drier than ever, with another of those dissecting looks. "Really. Colour me surprised, Potter. I thought you were shagging everything on two legs these days."
Harry slipped into the jacket. "Good night." He Disapparated.
Ron and Seamus exchanged a look. Malfoy didn't look up. "It's pretty small," Ron tried.
"You're welcome."
Harry's laugh was unsteady. "You may get your wish," he said, and held Malfoy tightly.
Potter was impatient. "Malfoy, there are really better things to be worrying about right now. The entire reason I'm here in 'your' castle is because I'm actually trying to protect everyone in it, including you and your son and my son and daughter and everyone else's children. I'm not just taking a vacation from my office and life in general."
"And clean up your language. Where are we going, anyway?"
Harry lay awake, listening to them and wondering if there was any way he could talk to Malfoy without anyone hearing. He didn't know what he wanted to say. It didn't matter. The breathing in the room gradually became slower and slower, and listening to everyone else sleep finally began to calm Harry's mind. He didn't sleep, though. An hour or so passed.
"Yes."
They ate breakfast together (after a rather long shower) and went to their respective jobs, and Harry left early just in case Malfoy had come home early, too. He had, and this fact was celebrated instantly, clothing strewn freely about the flat. It was bliss, and Harry knew that it was the honeymoon effect, as Hermione called it, but this time, he was sure. Hermione was always right about these things. It was what he had wanted, after all, though he never would have known that at the time when he and Ginny had married. She would be fine. He had no worries about her. She wasn't the youngest (and only) sister of six brothers for nothing. She would survive.
Malfoy laughed again. "Good try, Potter. Thanks for confirming it. You know the one. Goes to the tune of you and him behind the kitchen at Grimmauld Place and somebody - or two twin somebodies, rather - walking in on someone going down on someone else."
Harry frowned. "What? I didn't quite get that when you were interrogating him."
Harry agreed readily. Later, they got dressed and Malfoy went downstairs with him to find his shirt and glasses. They went to the front door and kissed again. Malfoy unlocked the door and took down the wards.
"Malfoy, I…" Potter stopped, arms still circling Draco's middle. He sounded serious. "I have to tell you, I was hoping all along that this might happen if I stayed."
Malfoy allowed his hand to be shaken. "A debt is a debt," he said. "I won't forget."
"If I still what?" It was very cool.
"Sod off," the other grunted, but stumped off in the direction of the dart corner.
Malfoy silently rose, quite steady on his feet, Harry noted, and ushered them out, locking the office behind him. He also did something that made the office smell of citrus, rather than alcoholic fumes, and Harry said nothing to that, either.
"So you thought I was a snob. That's fair. I was a snob. Still am."
The door safely closed behind him, Harry stared at himself in the mirror. His face was decidedly flushed, his cheeks especially. His hair was rumpled and there were bite marks in his shirt at the shoulder, all of which only served to enhance the foolish grin reflected back at himself.
"Talk to Janus," Draco said. "Have Cynthia organise it." He waved Potter toward the door. "We will need to talk about this prank business properly, Potter."
"Maybe."
Malfoy pushed a bony knee between Harry's thighs and Harry stopped particularly caring whether he was a virgin or not. He wasn't, and he knew how not to hurt Malfoy if - but he was getting ahead of himself. Malfoy was barely touching him, except for his mouth, which was devouring Harry's as though the kiss alone could sustain him, feed him. The hand on Harry's ribs moved a little, and Malfoy's thumb pressed into his nipple. Harry's restraint broke. Later, perhaps he would feel embarrassed for having turned around on the general topic of Malfoy so quickly, but at the moment, all he knew was that he wanted, and how. He grabbed Malfoy's arse and pulled him closer, felt the hardness of his cock through his trousers against his own, and Malfoy moaned.
"There is always a need for a voice of reason that isn't influenced by political position," Hermione said loudly, the words coming out in a rush. "You know that! If we let the Ministry just exist unchallenged, who will question them when they make odd decisions or start acting like an oligarchy?"
Malfoy gave him an interesting smile, one full of some manner of deviousness and layers that Harry would never comprehend and just said, "Sure thing, Potter. Hey, and bring back that book of mine, would you?"
It was the glossy plastic tone of a practised professional. No chips in the façade. "No, that's all right," Harry said. "May I ask why it seems to be so difficult to reach an administrative assistant in the Human Resources Department? Is she off sick, or has she gone suddenly missing, or is her phone disconnected? What is it? This is the fourth time I've tried to get through in three hours."
"Also real," Harry said absently, taking a sip of beer.
They glanced at each other. Shacklebolt nodded. "It's not strictly hypothetical," Moody said. "Potter's actually an Auror, too."
She made her exit, leaving Harry feeling more humiliated than he'd felt in awhile. He hadn't thought that Malfoy would tell Pansy what had happened at Spinner's End, and it wasn't fair that he had told her that. Not that Malfoy had ever been fair, but it made Harry angry nonetheless.
"Yeah, fine," Harry said. "Uh, Dudley, this is my partner, like I said. Um, this is my cousin Dudley, like I told you."
Hi Draco,
His entire body convulsed, his arse clenching around Harry's cock, which only made it squeeze out even more come, and wet globs hit the fuzzy sofa arm as Malfoy orgasmed all over the place, gasping.
Draco was suddenly much closer, his breath hot on Harry's ear. "Keep driving," he breathed. "I know you're too stubborn to just stop and fuck me like I know you want to, so we'll play it your way."
"Thought you usually talked to his underlings."
"Couldn't slice the fucking elm bark the right… why am I ex… explaining this to you. No point. Leave me alone."
"Yeah?"
Potter's face was white. He stood on the opposite side of the hospital bed, staring down at his son, speechless. Pomfrey had been forced to admit that she did not know what had happened to Albus.
He had imagined this, even dreamt it on a few memorable occasions, but it was nothing like the reality of having a real, rather perfect cock right in front of him, in his hand, now in his mouth. His lips closed around it and it tasted exactly the way he knew it would. It wasn't as hard as he'd thought it might be. After all, he knew what he liked. Malfoy was wordless, moaning and writhing shamelessly beneath him; Harry was holding him down by the hip, his other hand occupied with their playful exploration of Malfoy's balls. As he moved his mouth over Malfoy's jutting cock, it occurred to Harry with surprise that he loved this. He did. He loved pressing his tongue there, tightening his lips here, running his tongue over a softly crinkled ball while his hand touched and stroked and tugged, that he absolutely adored giving head. Malfoy apparently had no complaints, either. Harry pressed himself into the blankets and allowed himself to revel in it all. The taste in Harry's mouth changed and suddenly Malfoy gasped, "Stop. Potter, stop."
"Yes, you have." Malfoy was cold, his eyes boring accusingly into Harry like picks.
Harry sighed and got up. He shed his pyjama pants and left them on the floor, walked to the door and took a towel that was hanging from it by a hook. He looked back at Draco where he was still lying composedly on the bed. "Come shower with me?"
"And for getting out?" Draco did his best to keep the apprehension out of his voice.
He explained on the way. Malfoy looked mortified and stared at both hands. "Shoot, I didn't even notice it slipping," he said. "Thanks for covering that."
"Whatever makes you happy," Harry said, still amused. "But yeah, I thought it worked really well. And you're very convincingly feminine, so kudos, I guess."

"Very good," Moody agreed, eyeing Draco with both eyes. "I agree. Full marks."
"And you're still insisting that you're straight? How deluded are you, Potter?" He couldn't help it; the scorn crept in on its own. "Did you just 'not know'?"
Harry was at the door. Malfoy followed and met him there. Harry, feeling ridiculous, held out his hand for Malfoy to shake. Malfoy looked at it. Harry shrugged. "Thanks for the tea?" he tried, feeling lame.
It was less than a minute to two o'clock, and Harry felt like he was on his way to a first date. He was ridiculously nervous and hoping Malfoy wouldn't notice. He could not stop himself from wondering obsessively how Malfoy was going to act today. Would he be cool and detached? Would everything be different? Would it be strained? Harry felt the silver pen in his hand attach to his palm the instant before the portkey activated, propelling him directly into Malfoy's front hall, where he had so recently been.
Harry looked up, then straightened up. "Morning," he replied, setting down his quill. "What can I do for you?"
"Don't be stupid for once in your life, Potter. They have a hostel; they let people stay. I've been there before."
A Gryffindor sixth year was going the wrong way, away from the Great Hall. She was, in fact, walking toward him with a sense of hesitant purpose. "Headmaster," she began uncertainly. "May I have a word?"
Harry pressed his mouth to the base of Draco's ear. "So we're going to have a good Christmas this year. And in the meantime…"
They went to the bedroom. Malfoy stripped entirely and subtly watched Harry as he followed suit. As they kissed again, Malfoy guided him to the bed, wrestling the blankets around them. They lay close together and it felt more intimate to Harry than almost anything he'd ever felt before. The panic of the nightmare was had subsided and he felt almost peaceful, and very sleepy.
The mobile was buzzing against the counter as he emerged from the bathroom, a small towel wrapped around his waist. He sighed and picked it up. "What?"
Potter made a hmm-ing sound of negation into his neck. "Doesn't matter. I did."
His mobile rang, jerking him out of his reverie. Harry snatched at it. "Hello?"
Draco passed him a glass and sat down again. He had just opened his mouth when a woman dressed in violet satin approached. Potter evidently caught sight of the lapel mike first; his expression went blank and the legs of his chair thumped down on the hard wood floor with a final sort of a sound. Draco frowned, determining that he'd never seen the woman before. She ignored him almost completely, leaning across to speak to Potter.
"I'd like it if I or we could have him at least some of the time," Malfoy said. "Not necessarily at the same time. My wife will be fine with that."
In the morning, he got the boys up and made them breakfast. Lily was still asleep, and it was nice to not have a busy two-year-old running around under everyone's feet for a little longer, so Harry didn't wake her. He heard her high, piping voice as he cleared the dishes, Ginny's answering. The boys went into the living room to play. He went to put his shoes on. When Ginny came down, he said, only partially looking at her, "I have some things to do. I'll be back in a little while."
"I'm done waiting for this," Draco said, and Harry needed no further encouragement. With minimal speech, they positioned themselves together and went through the intimate ritual of preparing each other. And when their bodies came together at last, Harry felt as though he recognised the feeling from somewhere, some previous life - that he had always known what it would feel like to be this close, this intimate with Draco Malfoy, and had just managed to forget somehow. It was like stumbling across some beloved thing that he'd lost years ago and only just now found again. Harry trembled, looking down into Draco's face.
Albus Dumbledore was nowhere to be found. A thorough search of the paintings proved futile. Draco ran up the stairs to his office and woke Snape. "Where is he?" he demanded.
His latter suspicion was confirmed. "It's… well, I stopped by the office to grab something," Tonks said, "and I had to go by the seventh floor for something, and…"
Malfoy's hand slipped into his pocket and came out with a USB key, to Harry's surprise. Malfoy's easy familiarity with Muggle technology still made him shake his head, especially considering that it hadn't appeared to have changed his general feelings for non-magical people all that much in other regards. He slid it across the table. "Take it. Potter will tell you what to do with it."
He put his hand on Malfoy's face and touched his mouth to Malfoy's, and it was long and slow. "Don't leave this time," was all Malfoy said, and Harry heard himself say something, and then he was asleep, Malfoy's arms still around him.
"Sure," Harry said, annoyed with himself for wanting to follow Malfoy out. For feeling hurt that Malfoy had left so abruptly. The door closed without another word on Malfoy's part and Harry was left with a report to write. He jotted down a couple of notes but found himself too distracted to write properly. Eventually, he got up and tossed the file on the desk and decided to go for a walk to clear his head.
"I'm not going to ask you to stay," Malfoy said, the words partly muffled by Harry's shoulder.
"That will do," Draco said placidly.
"Where in the park?"
"When did you despair, Potter? That's what I want to know."
"No. I'm just at the point where, because I coordinated things so well, I get to have a little break while they all bond. That's just how talented I am."
Draco swirled his half-glass of champagne around in the flute, tried to think of something to say.
"One of these days, we really will find a time to catch up properly," Neville said, and his look was both understanding and resigned. "Well, have a good one. Sorry about this." He indicated the file. "Maybe it's nothing."
Malfoy stood on the step, looking as though he hadn't slept, either. For a long moment, Harry stared at him, waiting.
Harry sighed. "It wasn't supposed to be like that."
"Moody sent me to a safehouse," Harry said grimly. "Sorry I haven't been in touch. It was surrounded."
"True," Harry said, not having had the benefit of actually reading the book, but having heard Hermione discuss it at length when she had read it.
"They're just impressed because I wasn't even later," Harry scoffed, wincing at the pinch Malfoy delivered to his right arse cheek for that.
"Thank you, Sir Knight," Dumbledore said courteously. "Your warning is appreciated."
Soon enough, he was going to have to figure out what he wanted to say about it, namely to Ron and Hermione, who would be at the class meeting and evaluation the next day. And Ginny. The thought of Ginny made Harry's stomach drop like a rock. If she had been tolerant of his dallying with other girls in light of the thought that he was just playing around before getting down to the business of spending the rest of his life with her, he wasn't sure how she would react to finding out he was gay. And with Malfoy, too. The two of them had probably been more antagonistic toward each other than even Ron and Malfoy, though Harry now knew why on the one count. Perhaps she had met someone in Scotland and wouldn't even care. Perhaps. He hoped.
Malfoy's look was cold. "Do you not have any recollection of your little conversation with Pansy at St. Mungo's?"
If Potter heard, he gave no indication, striding off into the crowd.
Potter,
Malfoy shrugged, smiling. "I had to deliver something here, and it seemed a good excuse." He got to his feet. "Lead the way. I get lost in your Department; it's crowded."
"Okay." Dudley looked dubious, but accepted this. "Dudley Dursley."
He looked a wreck. Draco surveyed him cautiously for a long moment. "Who was he?" he asked, careful to keep his tone curious rather than malicious.
"I will."
"With whom, might I ask?"
Harry blinked at the unexpected compliment, backhanded though it might be. "Er, thanks," he said. "I never thought it was much, but there it is."
Draco rolled his eyes. "Don't get like that. That's precisely why I brought it up. I don't really like talking about things like this, but I figured you might be there - Boy Who Lived and all - and I thought it might be awkward if we hadn't talked about it first. Calm down."
"Interesting?" Ron said, squinting at the parchment. "It doesn't sound like he has to do anything at all!"

Harry hedged. "What do you know?"
"Fine. Now, what's going on? The letter said something about Albus."
"Several, actually," Susan said, and dropped the formality, sitting back. "We just lost two from the Potions Department, and… well, you could say that there's an issue or two there."
Ginny was staying with a friend. Things were on the rocks. Harry could feel the end coming, and that thought used to send him into a panic. In the old days, he would have grovelled until she wasn't angry any more - played the flowers/chocolates/cooking/whatever game she wanted, just to fix things. Now, Harry could hardly bring himself to be all that upset. He was lost in his own thoughts and had no energy to spare for drama.
"Your - " Harry stopped, choking on the word. God. His throat burned in aching sympathy and outrage at the same time.
"Jealous that you've had a chance to try it."
"What?"
"We all have to do that sometime," Draco said.
"Still," Harry persisted. "You were there, weren't you."
"You're gay," Ginny said, still into her hands. "I always defended you. Always. I never believed the stuff people said, especially about you and Malfoy. I should have known. I am such a fool."
"She moved out this afternoon," Harry said. "I came back here when I woke up, and we had a bit of a discussion, I guess."
"Hi, Malfoy," Harry said, as civilly as possible. It was hard to be civil when the very sight of someone put butterflies in his belly and something infinitely worse below. He was tense all over, but trying to be friendly - but not flirtatious or encouraging in any way - at the same time. It was complicated.
"I quite understand."
Harry smiled. "I did, too." He kept his arm around Albus and fell into silence. It hadn't actually occurred to him that Malfoy's son might essentially become his step-son and his kids' step-brother. What a thought.
"Okay." Harry's voice was tight, but that was to be expected.
"Why not?" Harry wondered if Malfoy was referring to past relationships. It was another uncomfortable thought. He didn't know what to make of Malfoy's gayness.
It made sense. Of course Malfoy, with his ingrained prejudices, quiet as he kept them now, would choose a position of superiority over any Muggle. But with a wizard, would everything depend on social standing? With Malfoy, it probably did, Harry decided. "Okay," he said, and dropped it.
