Draco raises his trembling arms and crosses them behind his head. It’s an exercise in restraint, and Harry knows, his eyes flashing and the tiniest smirk twisting his lips.
As of now, Potter has gone back to picking at his food. Draco notices that though he sits among friends, he appears to be just as isolated as Draco, who is sitting alone at the foot of the Slytherin table. The wide berth everyone is giving him clearly extends to the dinner table too. It is made worse by the fact that none of the Slytherins from Draco’s year have come back, all of them choosing to fuck off to France or Germany or some other obscure family estate that can’t be tracked by British wizards.
“What happened?” He asks Harry, voice raspy and weak. Harry gets up, pulls out a glass and casts an Aguamenti into it. Malfoy tracks his movements with confused grey eyes but when Harry holds out the glass to him, he drinks the whole thing in one go. Harry refills it and Malfoy sips at it again before repeating, “What happened, Potter?”
“Who cares?” Harry demands. “Who cares about the sides? Do you mean to tell me Voldemort was an angel? Paid you rent? Bellatrix never used up all the hot water—”
He spears his duck with more force than strictly necessary and resolves to pack his bags and leave the next morning. Saving Malfoy from himself is not Harry’s job.
told me he’s not better! He actually leaned in and whispered that we should talk so I put up a Muffliato and he actually spoke to me. Draco, I…”
“You must hate them,” he says, and clenches his eyes shut briefly before meeting hers. He doesn’t really care anymore about how much these little tells betray.
Draco has little to offer that does not sour the mood. But he tries anyway. He filters his happiest memories for the ones that seem appropriate, the ones that are not tainted by prejudice and privilege. There are few, but they are precious. So he tells Harry about Blaise and Theo, about his own pride in seeing his friends happy, about the time he and Pansy went wine tasting in the Manor’s wine cellars and got blind drunk at thirteen.
Draco closes his eyes. There’s memories, flashes of colour and sound pulsing against his eyelids, recollections of his aunt giggling maniacally as he cast Crucio on some poor Muggle sitting in his cellar with wide eyes and no understanding of what was going on around him, of his desperate attempts to cast a Patronus charm when he was holed up in his own room, of Potter screaming Expelliarmus and his wand shooting out the brightest jet of red light he had ever seen to meet Voldemort’s green halfway.
But when they are all in the room together, everything comes to a standstill. There is no movement. Scorpius finds himself startled by the sound of birds alighting on the windowsill, so accustomed he is in those moments to the statue like stillness. Breaths are cautious, measured. One too loud might bring on eye-contact better left avoided. One too soft might bring on panic better left bottled.
“There’s always the fingering. Slicking up the fingers until,” he presses the heel of his palm into the base of Draco’s cock and Draco is rapidly approaching the edge he wants to hold off just from harry’s hands and his words, “until they’re dripping with lube.” He circles Draco’s hole with the tip of his fingernail. “Doing this, circling the hole until you’re begging for more and then slowly, gradually slide in one finger up to the first knuckle.” He keeps circling and Draco is sure he’s going right out of his mind. “Keep pulling and pushing, pulling out and pushing in, gradually increasing depth until I’m in up till my third knuckle. Until your hole is greedily swallowing me in, pulling me closer, begging for more, begging for it to go deeper.” He scrapes his nails on Draco’s perineum and Draco feels the tears sliding out of his eyes, running down his cheeks. “I’ll push in two, then three, maybe even four. Keep at it till you’re dripping wet and loose and begging for more and the only more you could possibly get is my cock.” He leans in and kisses Draco, messily and dirtily and whispers, “And we already know how that one goes.”
There are endless possibilities for Harry to find love again, and the only thing holding him back is seven sapphires set in platinum, a shackle around his ring finger and Draco’s absolute refusal to hand him divorce papers.
Draco gets up and helps Harry to his feet. While Harry leans against the wall, Draco turns the taps and adjusts the temperature, asking Harry to test it himself. When he deems it appropriate, he turns around and says, “Shower. Then some food if you want. And then bed. Are we clear?”
Harry and Draco haven’t gone beyond the stage of making out. Deep, heavy making out with hands crawling up each other’s shirts and down each other’s pants, making out that leaves their lips swollen, their necks bruised and mottled with love bites, their hair in spectacular disarray, their cocks hard in their tight, constricting pants and their breaths coming in short bursts.
Draco coughs. The guilt threatens to spill from his mouth in tendrils of confessions he should not even think to make. World famous Quidditch player, Ginevra Weasley, benched for the season due to the battering her ankle bone took from a rogue bludger and Draco’s here, having an affair with her husband.
Weasley tuts and casts another Healing Spell and Draco sighs in relief even though a slight twinge remains.
Harry scowls, and oh, this is familiar, because within a second, the nervousness is gone and the aggression Harry keeps sequestered away is leaching into every line of his perfect form. He steps in, and the door bangs shut and Draco knows from experience that Harry has thrown up locking and silencing spells in the same gesture.
Harry looks down at his own glass, suddenly painfully aware of the ache in his heart that has been left by Ron and Hermione’s absence. He’d needed a break from them, sure, but they are parts of him just as much as he’s a part of them. His circumstances seem to weigh in on him all of a sudden. Alone, with Malfoy, in an Italian villa probably constructed with blood money, isolated from all his friends. It’s strange, and foreign and the wine turns sour in Harry’s mouth.
The sound hits a crescendo—his eardrums rattle with it, his breath shakes with it. The parched back of his throat is slaked with the blood of it, and the broken spaces between his ribs echo.
The thirties suit Draco, who has now grown into the sharp angles and planes of his figure, looking lean and distinguished instead of a combination of dangerous edges. He looks chiselled, like someone spent the last thirty years or so carving a masterpiece that they are finally close to finishing.
“I think you’ve had enough,” Blaise says, reaching for the bottle between them, placing it on the floor beside his chair. “That’s your third shot of this shit and your fifth drink since I’ve been here, so either spill why you called me choking on your tears or let me go back home.”
He’d met Salma Rashid, his Mind Healer after the war who had explained cognitive dissonance and self-destructive patterns and PTSD to him in a measured, calm tone that instantly put him at ease. Who had not batted an eyelash when Harry had broken down and asked her one day after some Muggles in London had made comments about his skin that drove him back to his cupboard and Vernon’s smirking derision, to the shame of not knowing where his father was from or the names of his grandparents, how she stomached the way he knew people must stare at her hijab.
“You’re supposed to be taking notes, Harry,” Hermione chastises at the same time Malfoy says, “Something crawl up your arse, Potter?”
‘Wait here,’ he hears Draco say and wants to snort a reply about how he can’t exactly go anywhere in the state he’s in, but his mouth isn’t cooperating.
Potter’s green eyes are dark with the thunderstorms of whatever righteous anger he feels. Dench’s unnaturally white teeth are clenching down on his lower lip. By the time Potter is summoned, Draco is exhausted. Watching one’s own fate be decided in this manner feels treacherous. Feels like sneaking into God’s workshop to hear his deliberations.
“Hello,” he says, voice rough. Draco’s more vulnerable than people think he is. The eyes looking into his, grey like his own, and speckled with blue, are oceans of bottled pain. “How are you feeling?”
They turn to each other at the same moment with matching grins and in seconds they’re jostling each other on the staircase, racing to Harry’s room. Draco pulls Harry in for a long, searching, exploratory kiss that leaves them both slightly breathless in the middle of the stairs and after that it’s an endlessly long period of time– crashing into banisters, leaning against the walls, hands and lips and teeth and tongue on every accessible part of each other’s exposed skin.
The term PTSD isn’t foreign to Harry but he has forgotten what it means. When he asks Hermione, she smiles sadly and says, “Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Harry. The Mungo’s Mind Healer said you had it, remember?”
Potter’s face in the dirt-streaked mirror of a secluded bathroom. Potter outside his Azkaban cell. Potter forcing the guards to undo his restraints after the full pardon. Potter leaving him wrecked more times than he cares to count in myriad hotel rooms in myriad states of undress and debauchery.
They kiss more, mouths opening like winter roses under a radiant sun, and when Harry huffs a very gentle laugh into Draco’s mouth, Draco drinks it in like nectar. Harry is sweet, soft where Draco had not expected him to be so, tough in places where Draco needs him to be. He loses track of how much time he’s spent, tangled in the sheets of Harry’s bed, smelling the clean shampoo of Harry’s hair.
It had been right up there alongside the other worst days of his life– Sirius dying, Dumbledore dying, Fred dying, Ron leaving.
“I also have here Luna Lovegood and Dean Thomas’ signed declarations that though they were held captive at Malfoy Manor for weeks and subjected to inhuman abuse, the accused often provided them and other prisoners—even the Muggle ones, with food, warm blankets and potions to heal their wounds. He did this at great personal risk to himself upon discovery. He never participated in any of the torture though he was subjected to the less than forgiving consequences at Bellatrix Lestrange’s hand for his insubordination.”
“Of course I’m disagreeing!” Draco says. “This is me, disagreeing. Not agreeing. Never agreeing to your absolutely bollocks plan to hang out together for a year! Is that what you want, Potter? For the kind Minister to find our bloated bodies in the English Channel and for the coroner to say that we’ve died by each other’s hand? Is that it, Potter—”
It’s the wrong thing to say however, Harry realises soon when Hermione bangs her hand on the table, an action so uncharacteristic of her that he jumps. “You don’t even eat half your meals, I don’t even remember where your place is at the table! Excuse me if I thought you were going to sleep the day away the way you have the whole of last week!” Her voice has gone up several octaves, her eyes are shining and her lower lip is trembling slightly.
Harry glares. “Well, aside from the residual magic I could feel clinging to my skin when I stepped in there, I was… there.” He hesitates. “In my dreams. In Voldemort’s head.”
“Yes, Harry, Draco Malfoy. Hermione said you both have become some sort of friends. He was here for what happened. Do you remember?”
He can’t meet Potter’s eyes because that damned verdant gaze is too much for him to take. He’d rather not discover unwelcome truths in their depths, find pity or disgust.
He opens his eyes and instead of seeing Harry doing something with his own self for Draco’s viewing pleasure as he had hoped he would, he finds Harry staring open mouthed at his exposed chest, gripping his shirt with both hands and looking so shocked that Draco winces at his own stupidity.
Draco snorts. The Firewhisky sloshes. “For the amount you’re being paid, you have all day and all night and all of whatever’s in between, whenever I want, don’t you think? That is what you signed yourself up for.”
“He… he can’t tell where he is. He thinks he is still in the War. In the tent, or in Gringotts or at Hogwarts or…”
Draco understands. He doesn’t presume to think he understands the true extent of Potter’s trauma but if the horrors he has had to endure are even half as much as what Draco has, he wouldn’t want to share them with someone else. It is in a way ironic that Potter has possibly seen
Draco tries. With maximum effort, he can make himself nod in assent. It’s draining, but it’s a morsel of control that Draco clings to for dear life.
Potter’s uncertain smile in response is successful in its cruelly insistent endeavour to twist its way into Draco’s chest.
Malfoy’s gaze is cautious. “The gate let you in,” he murmurs softly. “The intention charm… it didn’t fail?”
His vision is turning dark around the edges, and the room is spinning until he can’t make sense of anything except the lightning-shaped crack in the plaster on the wall, it’s jagged edges cutting into his brain, until all he can see is lightning scars and lightning spells, dancing in blue and green and red before his eyes.
She smiles. “Not the sort where you say sorry and grovel at my feet." Then she adds as an afterthought, "Though I wouldn’t mind a bit of that.”
Harry pulls him closer until they are almost nose to nose. “Draco,” he says, breath falling in gusts over Draco’s lips. “We’ve kissed once. I would indeed love to have sex,” and at this juncture he wiggles his eyebrows and Draco swats him on the nose, “but let’s please just enjoy this for a while, alright?” And then their lips are on each other’s, mouths slotting together, tongues twining and touching. Draco feels Harry smile against his mouth and sucks his lower lip in before gently nipping it. He revels in the ensuing gasp, wanting to elicit more of those noises, wanting to keep inhaling the sounds Harry makes when he’s being pleasured, wanting to remember the spots where when touched his breath hitches slightly and the spots which touched make his whole body jerk under Draco’s ministrations. He traces his lips gently down Harry’s jaw, and sucks at the juncture where his neck and jaw meet, a smooth expanse of brown skin, unbroken by scars that otherwise litter almost every part of Harry’s beautiful, beautiful body. Harry shudders slightly at the feeling, gripping Draco’s hair so tight that tears spring to his eyes.
Draco stares at him. At this man, with his messy mop of hair and large eyes and long limbs, sitting in his bed, sipping wine while he gauges Draco’s reaction to his tidal wave of words which should not make sense but do. At this man whom he’d hated for rejection out of a petty childhood spitefulness that his father had been proud of and his mother had ignored.
“I’m glad,” Malfoy says, quiet and honest. After last night, it’s not as unfamiliar as it once would have been.
It isn’t like Draco sits around at home, doing nothing. He’s a Potions consultant for St. Mungo’s and the job exhausts him, drives him to insanity and demands every bit of his energy but at least he can keep regular hours. Maybe part of that is attributed to the fact that he can do a lot of his work from home but what it boils down to in the end is that Draco is always waiting and Harry is always late.
Harry nods and very gently pushes further and further in. It hurts more with every second but Draco clenches his jaw and powers through, hoping it gets better. He feels Harry’s balls against his arse and knows he is all in and when the pain doesn’t recede, he says, “Wait a minute.”
Harry’s hands are wandering, with less purpose than they’ve ever had. They trace the jut of his hips, they cup his jaw and Draco shudders at the touch of the warm, calloused palm against the sharp contours of his face. They slide down Draco’s side, and he smiles into Harry’s mouth at the sensation and his head spins when Harry smiles back.
It’s not electric. It’s not even good, if Harry is being honest. His glasses bump Draco’s nose and Harry’s lips are too chapped. Draco is too surprised to reciprocate in time, and what the kiss ends up being is a smushed collision of their faces at angles faces should not collide.
Anything he could want, he had. But he didn’t have compassion.” He gestures to Malfoy’s left forearm, covered by his long-sleeved shirt. “You don’t want to be defined by that thing, right?” he asks. Malfoy scowls at him but shakes his head.
Harry realises after an uncomfortable pause that both Draco and Parkinson are staring at him, twin expressions of uncertainty on their faces.
They lost everything– respect, trust, patience, hope, when those words were said in the courtroom. They lost any shreds or residual bits of those emotions left during the ceaseless fights in the kitchen when they threw words at each other like sharpened knives.
But within moments, the Saviour turned Auror returns and Harry’s jaw hardens, his eyes turn cool and his voice cuts through the air crisp and sharp.
“You want to go sleep if off?” Draco asks Harry after a few minutes. “I’ll let you take a shower now and after, you can go to bed.”
“Where is she?” he asks, instead. Pansy Parkinson was not charged with anything, given that she was not Marked and an abrupt, panicked attempt to hand the Chosen One over to the Dark side did not a valid charge make, especially when the Chosen One handed himself over eventually.
“No one,” he murmurs, looking down at the grain of the wooden dining table. “That’s the whole point. They’re much too lonely.”
‘I think we need to come up with a safe word before we do this,’ Draco says, mouthing at the sweat slicked skin of Harry’s shoulder.
“Of course it was,” Harry murmurs. “You with your talk of us visiting help centres for sexually frustrated men, of course our bond was much too strong for issues as trivial as death.”
“You’re not allowed to find Percy interesting,” Ron says, leaning up on his elbow. “Neither of you. I’m the only interesting Weasley brother when it comes to the two of you. Especially you, Hermione. And Merlin’s saggy left ball,
Harry can’t make his mouth form words, so the sound he emits is a cross between a groan and a laugh. If possible, Draco’s eyes grow even wider.
It doesn’t even happen elegantly—a touch on the shoulder, a glance across the narrow street, a gaze caught and released quickly through the tinted glass of a suspect shop window. It happens as most things do between them—explosively, messily, with a whole bunch of broken glass and creative profanities. In the aftermath of Harry and Malfoy, there is always a wreckage.
“Hello, Harry. Do you think you could handle some very dim light? I know your head must be killing you right now. You can keep your eyes closed if you want.”
Malfoy shrugs now, all forced nonchalance and covert worry. “Probably Paris. I haven’t heard from her for a month.” He traces the rim of his glass and says with a fond smile that quivers at the edges, “She’ll turn up like a bad penny soon enough. She always does.”
“Is there a reason,” Draco begins, trying to be as non-confrontational as possible, “that you act like a perpetual arse to her?”
Her eyes briefly fit to Draco’s assessing and hesitant. He wonders if he should offer to leave. He feels discomfited enough, it wouldn’t exactly be a hardship. “I–“ he begins, but Ginevra cuts him off with a wave of a broom calloused hand.
“Oh.” Malfoy’s voice is small and he sounds like he is bracing himself for a hex the way a first year does in front of a fifth year bully.
There’s a whispered spell and a sweet vanilla smell scents the air. Another and Draco feels slightly dizzy and his belly cleaner.
“For me?” Draco had asked. Teased, just a little. There had been a smile lingering on the edges of his consciousness, threatening to traipse onto his mouth.
“Draco," Hermione sighs, "Go and have fun for an evening instead of being a killjoy for once? Please? Just one evening and its for a good cause.”
In a minute, he’s scowling at himself. First, he misses Voldemort. Then, he estranges his friends. Now, he’s sympathising with Malfoy. Harry has always known something was deeply wrong with him but in the absence of anything else occupying his mind the way the Dark Lord did for the last seven years, it is becoming more apparent than he would like. Malfoy, he reminds himself, called Hermione a Mudblood every time he got the chance. Malfoy, who had signed up to be a Death Eater when he knew what they could do, what they had already done. Malfoy, who even without the ugly arm tattoo is a snide, evil, slimy bastard without anything creditable about him. For a minute Harry stops in his tracks just to remind himself why he has to apologise to Malfoy of all people for reminding him of some cold, hard truths.
With a careless wave, Death gestures to the door of the bedroom swinging open. Harry steps in, unaccompanied. For the first time, Scorpius gets a good look at him. Scorpius resists the urge to ask if there is Hell, and if the creatures residing within it look the way Harry does right now. There’s red puffiness around his eyes, and his usually tousled hair is stringy and lank. His lips, dry at the best of times are cracked and bloody. There are bruises on his knuckles and an inexplicable gash on his forehead that hasn’t been cleaned.
“Let’s go over the finer details of the proposal,” she had said, voice shaky but determined. Draco had acquiesced and they had spoken about it till they were hoarse and only had to review the whole thing once more before presenting it first to the Minister and then to the Council. When they couldn’t speak anymore, Granger had taken to staring off into space and Draco had played with the flames of the fire, changing their colours and turning them into dancing animals with magic.
Harry shudders. He brings his hands up to his face again and presses the heels of his palms against his eyes.
He has beautiful fingers, Blaise. Long and elegant with nails filed to precision framed by manicured cuticles– fingers of a man who has never had to lift even one of them to get what he wants. No, Blaise gets what he wants through charming smiles and being at the right place at the right time and inserting himself into conversations where he doesn’t belong with practiced ease.
He’s talking nonsense, he can’t even hear himself over the rushing in his ears and the screaming in his head. And just before the pleasure gets too much to bear, before he’s tipped right over the edge, Harry stops and pulls away.
Unspoken words, but they are louder, clearer, more of a declaration than anything either of them could ever phrase with sound and meaning.
“Don’t,” Malfoy says. “You reacted the way I would if I thought someone was homophobic.” He hesitates, takes another bite of his pizza and says after a few agonising seconds of delicate chewing, “Gryffindor’s Golden Boy isn’t a homophobe, is he?”
Even with his perfect OWLS and his more than satisfactory NEWTS, he’d been unceremoniously turned away at the door by reputed Potions Masters and received more than one polite letter of rejection from apothecaries, programmes, apprenticeships and the like. He’d been about to give up and move to France with his mother’s blessing, begging England with every step he took to give him a reason to stay.
Draco nods and swallows. He draws his head out of the fire and races back up the steps to find Hermione talking softly to Ron who still appears completely vacant. “She’s coming,” he tells her and the tense set of her shoulders relaxes slightly.
While Harry stares at him, Malfoy stares right back. He doesn’t seem surprised, he doesn’t seem afraid. He just stares, oddly blank before giving himself a slight shake. When he talks, his voice is raspy, breaking on the syllables, “Am I hallucinating?”
He looks at her, certain that she has gone completely insane. “I didn’t even bring dress robes, what makes you think I’m
“Thank you,” he says, unsure how to to convey your mouth around my dick was the best I have felt in my entire life and I never want it to stop.
“Muggle,” Malfoy snorts. “Renaissance fresco artist. You see this place—it should have been a museum. This is where Michelangelo apprenticed. And yet—” He shrugs again, shoulders tight. “And yet it’s just any old house now.”
“I don’t know,” Malfoy breathes, looking at him. “I have no idea. But I think—” He hesitates. “I think I might like to find out.”
I have the time as you very well know. I agree that haste cannot hurt when it comes to formulating the proposal and would like to go over your plans with you if you so desire. I wish I could suggest an alternative but as I am unwelcome in most spaces and you are likely not going to agree to a meeting in the Manor’s kitchen or my bedroom, Grimmauld Place it will have to be. Beggars can’t be choosers.Thank you for your time.
“You don’t have to go back to Azkaban,” Kingsley says. “Not for this. And the Wizengamot would appreciate you conducting yourself in a fashion befitting someone granted this kindness and not land yourself back there due to other misconduct.”
This was when Granger dropped the bombshell. “I want you to spearhead the Pureblood integration portion.”
“I think I’ve had enough of fighting Dark Wizards, thanks Perce,” Harry interjects, cutting off what was definitely going to devolve into a lecture about why he should at least acquire the necessary qualifications for Aurorship.
This time the blush returns and Draco looks away, trying to stop the smile and not quite succeeding. Then he turns back and with a worried frown asks, “Wait. You’ve done it before?”
Finally, when he can’t take it anymore, he balls his hands into fists behind his head and says, “Stop.”
Harry’s magic seems to know him, seems to seek him out, and Draco wants to lose himself in this moment to never be found. If he died now, not only would he die happy, he would die content. It is more than he had ever dreamed of his future entailing and it is more than he deserves, but Draco Malfoy is not a man in the habit of denying himself so he indulges, luxuriating in the feel of his hands on Harry and Harry’s hands in him.
Harry’s lips twitch upward and at first he tries to stifle his laughter but soon he’s shaking with uncontrollable bouts of giggling which Draco probably shouldn’t find quite as adorable as he does.
And then he gently slides his finger along the slit, making draco squirm and moan. “Or would you like to be fucked? It takes more getting used to, but it could be better sometimes. Fucking is all about flying. Taking it feels like an extended moment of catching the snitch. Feeling that flutter in your palms. Feeling it jerk and twitch and knowing you have it, knowing you’ve won. That intense, beautiful feeling, that’s what taking it feels like.” His hands ghost down the length of Draco’s shaft. “That first slide in feels painful, hurts like hell. But there’s this moment, this moment when it just fits in and you feel so full, so deliciously full that you can’t imagine living without the added pleasure. Without the feeling of being connected to that person at a level so intimate and so,” he leans in close and whispers, “so incredibly filthy that you want to keep going till the end of time.” He quickens his pace, “It hits your prostate and it sends shockwaves up your spine and into your entire body, travelling from your arse to your arms to your thighs, to your cock. You can feel it coming, feel the pleasure cresting, feel the pain and the beauty of it right through to the moment when you can’t hold back anymore, the screams, the moans, the clenching and tensing and falling back.”
He can see the way it hurts Draco to be more frugal with his money, how he shies away from certain price ranges, how his face goes dark before going resigned when he sees a particular coat. He’s not poor—Merlin no—but Harry knows Voldemort’s stay had not been easy on the Malfoy vaults and the Ministry’s ensuing punishments and fines have been even harder.
Whenever Draco’s in the room, he sits holding Scorpius’ hand in a deceptively light grip, staring at the other armchair if it is empty, and at the bedspread if it isn’t. He doesn’t talk much, answering Scorpius’ questions about his day quietly, asking none of his own. If the world outside knew, they would be all too willing to judge Draco even for this– his apparent indifference in the face of Scorpius’… situation.
There is no accusation in the words. Pansy would have thrown those same words at him like sharpened knives hurled in a rage with deadly accuracy. Instead, Blaise, well, he– he serves as a reminder. A reminder of a similar evening with a little too much drink and far more laughter when the confession had spilt from Draco’s lips like a happy, dirty little secret. Blaise had only told him to be careful then.
Granger shoots him an odd look. “No one said anything about being gay, Draco. Seamus is probably bi, I mean him and Neville had that weird fling in Fifth Year. But he’s had that raging crush on Dean forever that everyone knows goes beyond being best friends but neither of them will admit to it and it’s all a bloody mess.”
“If your guess is that Hermione and Draco pulled me out of my Healer training for a day to come and speak to you and tell you you’re being an idiot, then it’s right.”
“The night my mentor Albus Dumbledore died at Professor Snape’s hands, Draco Malfoy was on the verge of killing him. I was there, hidden under an Invisibility Cloak. There are Pensieve memories I have submitted to the Minister confirming the same. Draco Malfoy lowered his wand when Dumbledore offered him help and safety. He was willing to betray the Dark Lord, and if Snape had not stepped in, I strongly believe we would not be here today, debating a child’s decisions.
His breath hitches and his throat closes up at the memory. He had been sent down to give the prisoners food and he had, some extra pieces to those who looked like they needed it, extra broth to the ones shivering. Here he had discovered that Lovegood had developed a hacking cough, an inevitability when one is locked for weeks in a damp cellar.
But out of it all what he remembers most clearly is the relief. The relief that maybe the end has finally come, that the impossible task has been taken out of his hands by Potter. And he remembers being grateful to Potter in those moments when the pain hadn’t quite settled in and death seemed to be a blissful fantasy. He hadn’t spiralled, thinking about it, strangely enough. He hadn’t swigged Draught like water. For once he had been able to think about something difficult without passing out.
Draco snorts. “A fundraiser for Hogwarts. The families who could have contributed significantly are all either in Azkaban or in Denmark or Finland or the countrysides of France. Who’s going to pay?”
Draco’s eyes widen and he lunges for the bag. “You’ve been sitting on Weasley’s blueberry muffins for this long? Whatever the fuck is wrong with you Potter?”
“We need to talk,” Draco says after a beat, all sense of humour gone from the words. “What happened in these past few days, the successive disasters, they can’t keep happening. If I could have my way, it would happen ever again.”
Harry draws Draco’s shirt up and off his body, and when his hands aren’t tangled in fabric anymore, Draco reaches up and undoes the clasp of Harry’s robes and watches the maroon fabric fall to the floor in a heap. Harry’s in a black shirt and denims that Draco can’t wait to strip him of, but Harry’s on him again, pressing him back and pushing him down onto the bed.
Weasley shoots him a strange look. “Malfoy, I don’t know where you’ve been brought up but in our world, people do nothing but wait for an apology. Hope it’s a mistake, a spur of the moment thing, want some reassurance. And while he’s been waiting, he’s been drowning himself in whisky of all kinds. His room smells like a bar and he isn’t even sober when he sleeps.”
Sometimes when he is inordinately late, Draco is furious, his rage dripping from the angles of his posture– the fierce jut of his hip, the cross of his arms, the tremble of his lips– which makes apprehension set Harry’s synapses into overdrive. Sometimes he is understanding, taking off Harry’s robes with a sigh and a gentle kiss to his forehead before bringing dinner to the couch. Those times Harry feels like a right arse for the lines of worry that are becoming more prominent on Draco’s forehead and the guilt he feels threatens to corrode his principles away.
He pulls out of Ron’s embrace, drags him by the elbow into the kitchen, stares him in the face for a moment, searching out the spot on his forehead where he had been bleeding to find no trace of it whatsoever and then wraps his arms around his waist and stays there. Ron laughs softly before hugging him back, murmuring you fucking idiot over and over again and Harry knows they will be okay. He has guilt to work through, pain, anger, misery and guilt but they will be okay.
“Would you shut up about my damn villa?” he hisses over the table, taking a little morsel of sick pleasure in the way Harry jerks back. “I can’t help the fact that my father decided property in Siena would be somehow lucrative. He wasn’t wrong, anyway.”
“One beer,” Harry says. “I might be seventeen but it takes more than that to get me drunk, Malfoy. This wasn’t some drunk impulse.”
The first time Harry and him had fallen into bed together, Harry had shut his eyes and cried in the aftermath, curling into a ball on his side and screaming Ginevra’s name.
Scorpius does not answer. Instead he watches Harry pull out his cup from the top shelf and after a moment’s thought, Draco’s too. Side by side, they look innocuous, a couple’s morning coffee, a touch of love, a dash of everyday romance.
Rome is a city of restored ruins and Harry, who is something of a restored ruin himself, appreciates the pride that clings to every battle worn stone.
Hermione shakes her head. “Luna’s not the type to hold grudges. She would be happy to help. If you want, I could get in touch with her.”
“Draco,” the Minister cuts in, unimpressed and annoyed. “We would not spend valuable Ministry resources playing petty mind games with you. And I will remind you that you are in no way getting off scot-free. The fines we demand are a significant portion of your family vaults, at least the ones the British Ministry has jurisdiction over. You will not be able to come back and sustain yourself by being a wealthy and influential philanthropist. Not to mention the hours of community service that you have to commit yourself to. They will not be easy. And a year of exile does mean that you cannot in any way or form return to Britain, not even under extenuating circumstances. You understand the implications of this, yes?”
Harry stares at the blonde head atop the pale blue pillows. Fucking Draco, making him fall in love time and time again, even after six years. He bends down and presses a soft, chaste kiss to the exposed nape of Draco’s neck.
But before he can spiral thinking about Potter and Harry, said individual has discarded the shy grin and looks extraordinarily like Granger when she is gearing up for a long lecture.
Harry is horrified. Hermione is one of the fastest talkers he knows and Malfoy has enough quick wit to put stage comedians to shame. The pair of them talking at each other and then him will undoubtedly give him a headache. But he is the one who suggested it so instead of complaining in vain to the two immovable objects and unstoppable forces he knows, he summons a notepad and a pen from upstairs.
“Yes, I must—the sentence—a year of exile—” He’s beginning to look like a puffed up kitten and that at least, is familiar territory. “Is
“He’s not better,” Draco warns, immediately. He doesn’t want to ruin her exuberance but he also doesn’t want her to live with false hope. “Don’t get your hopes up.”
Instead of admitting defeat the way Harry had hoped Draco would, Draco’s expression turns stern. “Potter, if we don’t talk, I’m not going to let whatever this is get much further. If we don’t have a conversation, there won’t be other things.”
“He’s alright,” she says, but the smile she supplies to accompany the words is strained. “Throwing himself into work as always.”
He doesn’t need to hide it around Harry or Hermione and Weasley and since they are his excuse for socialising these days, Draco has stopped Glamouring altogether. There is no point hiding from them, no point making his past a secret. They are all too well acquainted with it.
Harry gets that. If there was any avenue left to bring his parents back, Harry would not leave it unexplored.
Draco nips at his rim gently and Harry knows that when this finally ends, he will have gone completely insane from the pleasure and the pain. Next thing he knows Draco is sealing his mouth around his soft pucker and sucking, like the motherfucking angel he is, turning his tongue into a pointed end and stabbing it gently into him, stroking his inner walls with saliva and a solid warmth.
When Harry is in up till the third knuckle, he crooks his finger slightly. “What are you doing?” Draco asks, curious.
Harry opens the window to the owl with the daily newspaper, and once he takes a quick look at the headlines, he folds it back up and puts it under Draco’s coffee cup.
Somewhere a bell tolls. Draco doesn’t know if it is the ominous nature of his memory or simply a cosmic joke. He looks away, face hot, eyes burning. There is no solace to be found in faces, so he looks down at the floor.
No handsy caresses, no generous amounts of affectionate words– just calm, gentle reassurance that exists in the simplest things. A shared wand. Subtle charms. The brush of a finger against a fading pulse, trying to take and give strength simultaneously.
“Well, yeah, of course,” Ron says, brow furrowed. “Why wouldn’t it be? You’re as British as it gets, mate. But part of you’s Indian, isn’t it? Even if it’s just the skin for now. Maybe it could be more. You won’t know until you go.”
For some reason there’s none of their usual frantic disrobing and fucking and fighting involved in Harry’s movements today. He’s slower, savouring the kiss, licking into Draco’s mouth and gently pulling him apart at the seams. Draco feels like a teenager, because for fuck’s sake, they are
He finds himself in the library and wanders through the shelves of books, knowing each as intimately as the back of his hand. He has grown up here, learning to read from ancient Potions tomes, words he did not understand, could not pronounce, but got excited by anyway. His godfather, Severus, always knew exactly which portion of the library to send him to when he was in one of his moods. When he grew frustrated by his father’s demands, he would be asked to go and spend some time in the section of Wizarding classics. Folklore, fairytales, myths and scenic imagery always calmed him down. Put him in a better mood when facing his father. When he ranted about Potter with real anger blazing in his eyes, Severus would ask him to go and find the ingredients to some very specific potion found only in one specific book. His concentration would be focused on his work, not on Potter. When the Dark Lord had been here, Severus had looked grave and told him to spend as much time possible learning about the Dark Arts. Not to use them but to understand them.To understand exactly what he was dealing with in every room of his childhood home.
Harry inches his finger slowly in, all the while keeping his other hand on Draco’s cock and though it does hurt like hell, it feels better than Draco thought it could be. He closes his eyes and just lets himself feel, the burn, the pain and the overwhelming pleasure.
She laughs again. He’s almost surprised by how often she does it, except it is quite unsurprising coming from Ginevra. The way she is, the person she is, laughter comes as naturally to her as cowardice does to Draco.
Her brows furrow. “You seem fairly insistent on addressing me as Ms. Richards. I continue to call you Draco– is it something that makes you uncomfortable? I could address you as Mr. Malfoy, if that would help this any. Would a more formal system help you feel more at ease?”
“It wasn’t enough then and it isn’t enough now but what you’re doing here is a step towards being enough someday. I don’t trust you, I never might after all those years and everything you’ve done but the past is the past. You don’t need to atone for your sins or whatever it is you think you need to be doing. You just need to never go back. Do what you do, not just to even the score but just because you can. Because you want to. Do you understand?”
He needs sleep. They’ve made plans to go to the Uffizi tomorrow and Draco wants to get an early start to his day. But right now, hearing the long drawn out muffled cry of Harry’s pleasure, everything else seems to pale in comparison. There can be nothing more exquisite than the sounds Harry is making except maybe if he made them into Draco’s mouth or the crook of his neck as Draco took over the onus of the ministrations that are twisting the sounds out of Harry’s throat in the first place.
This is not the time to dwell on such things, Scorpius tells himself, miffed by his inability to keep the thoughts he has dealt with so well thus far at bay. There is something he needs to tell them that takes precedence over melancholic reflection.
Instead of throwing the comment back in Harry’s face like he is wont to do, Malfoy leans against the kitchen cabinets and says, “I know. I’m sorry.”
Parkinson’s eyes widen and despite the horror churning in his gut at that involuntary revelation, born out of a certain kind of irrational jealousy Harry doesn’t care to admit to, it’s a little funny. Draco almost drops to the ground when she turns on him and screeches, loud enough to wake the whole floor.
he widens his mouth and slides Draco’s cock into it inch by painstaking inch as Draco howls in ecstatic pleasure.
He’d debated in his fading moments that if he weren’t dying whether they’d have severed the bond by now, leaving the rings in a forgotten drawer in an attempt to move on.
Draco would like to tell himself he didn’t whine when that happened but he would be lying to himself. Blatantly.
“I want you buried deep in my arse when I come,” Draco informs him, raising an eyebrow. “If of course, you’re… amenable to that,” he amends.
Draco stares. His words have escaped him. He opens his mouth but he has been stunned into total silence by this revelation. Finally he breathes, “Harry wants it?”
. “I am not here to save your sorry soul, Malfoy,” he says. “I’m not here so you can use me as some sort of mentor when you see fit and then discard me when you decide to ride the coattails of some inexplicable whim. That’s not how this works.”
Instead, he focuses on the sound of Harry’s breathing and the rise and fall of Draco’s chest and tells himself that when the time comes, someone will step up to take care of these two foolish men in his absence.
Draco’s brows furrow. He’s sure it isn’t her fault but he knows how futile it is to say that to someone who believes something is their fault.
If Draco didn’t know that Harry would never do this if he knew Draco was listening in, he’d accuse Harry of putting on a show. But that is perhaps another one of Draco’s tendencies—to find someone to blame even in the throes of an orgasm he shouldn’t be having. Harry muffles what sounds like a name as he shouts and probably comes, and despite the curl of shame weaving through his soul, Draco’s pleasure ricochets off the walls of his restraint and he’s coming too, soaking his pyjamas, his hands, a little portion of the sheets.
Draco shifts closer to her. He wants to be angry because this pain, this suffering, it merits anger. It merits tears and anger and misery but Draco can’t find anyone to be angry with. Except maybe Voldemort but he can’t get any angrier with that bastard.
“I didn’t,” Draco says, because when there’s nothing else to say, the truth works just fine. “He should have left me in the fire.”
By the time the glass is empty, Gianni is wringing his hands together, but Draco notices with some relief he has stopped murmuring about ironing his ears.
“What am I to you, Blaise?” Draco asks, and cringes violently when the words come out pleading and desperate. He turns away when a worried light enters Blaise’s eyes. He can’t handle pity right now, can’t handle the sting of condescension.
When ten minutes have passed, Harry calls out for Malfoy, sends a couple conjured birds flying around to peck on windows. He says he is going to wait, says he is going to not go anywhere till the prat opens the bloody door but there is no response at all. Sighing, Harry sits down to wait, tracing patterns on the marble with his shoe.
a few houses down from his own, not wanting to call attention to himself just yet. He snuck up the drive and pulled an Extendable Ear from his pocket, having learned his lesson from Wisteria Walk earlier that day. It wormed its way under the door and he placed the end to his ear, listening. He could hear moans coming from the direction of the bedroom, and he growled lowly in his throat.
"Honestly, Potter, have some manners." He ate his own mouthful of noodles from the pair of chopsticks he held in his hand. "Anyway," he said after he swallowed; Harry followed the bob of his Adam's Apple as the food went down. "I think that Lucas is sleeping with Edwards, and that when Amelia found out about it, she threatened to expose him at work. He'd lose his job because his bosses aren't gay-tolerant, so he killed her to keep her mouth shut."
"Actually, I am." Harry looked up as Malfoy shut the door and sat down next to him. "This way I can have you all to myself." Harry's eyes went wide and Malfoy smirked. "Now you didn't really think I told you that because I care about your marriage?" Harry didn't say anything, but his expression gave him away. "Honestly, Potter, you Gryffindors and trying to find the good in everyone. I'm a Slytherin; of course I would have ulterior motives."
"Just something simple, like spaghetti or fettuccine Alfredo." He poked his head back out into the room and regarded Harry with a raised eyebrow.
"We can't have that happening, Potter. Merlin, could you imagine such a place?" He sneered as the images ran through his mind. "The Wizarding World would be run by Squibs. Or worse, Muggle-borns."
"Damn Malfoy…" he grumbled, immersing himself in his task again. His last thought before an awry spell whizzed in through his open door and hit his desk, setting it aflame, was
"Come now, Potter, you know deep down that's not true." He regarded Harry carefully, looking for any scratches or signs of a fight. "I didn't expect the Weaslette to let you go willingly."
"So how are we even going to start this search for Edwards?" Harry asked, flipping through more pages of reports and findings the Ministry had on file about him. "We barely know anything about him."
Harry glanced at Malfoy from the corner of his eye to see Malfoy watching him carefully. Silently, Harry pulled out another piece of paper from the folder, and cleared his throat nervously. "It, uh, it says that the Aurors don't know what spell or curse was used that killed her."
He and Harry landed outside of a small building, no doubt enhanced with space expansion spells. They climbed up the steps and into the foyer, noting the location of the exits. Harry pointed to the staircase in the corner and to the magical lifts on the back wall. "We should take the stairs," he suggested.
Instead of the sarcastic remark he was expecting, Harry was thrown when Malfoy's expression turned sympathetic. "No wonder you've been so uptight lately. You need to unwind." He wrapped an arm around the Gryffindor's shoulders. "If you're interested, I could introduce you to a few of my good friends. Just to get your rocks off and return to normal."
"We'll see, Malfoy." Harry pulled out the file on Lucas Tyler; he scanned the pages, eyes finally landing on one name that stood out: Thomas Edwards. "Malfoy, look at this." He held up the paper for Malfoy to see, pointing to the name.
Harry growled and the glass of Malfoy's yard lamp burst. "We're getting a divorce, obviously; I hope you're happy." He shoved past Malfoy and into the house, sitting down heavily upon the sofa.
Scowling, Malfoy walked over to where Harry was standing, pointing at the hallway containing the stairs. "What is it?" He followed Harry's line of sight, but couldn't see anything. "What am I looking for, Potter?"
Harry glowered at the ash that settled on the carpet afterwards. "'Sleeping on the sofa', my arse." He grabbed a bag, filled it with clothes, and
there since Malfoy's office was a couple meters down the hall. When he finally arrived at his partner's office and said as much, Malfoy scoffed. "Potter, how do you know I'm not getting a blow-job underneath my desk at times like that? I don't need you wandering in on us and getting all hot and bothered because you haven't been laid in four months."
"Wonderful, Potter, now let's go and investigate this place." He led Harry down the hall to the door of flat 26B and opened the door.
as he exited the house; the blonde incarcerated him with magical bonds and left him in the grass as he went inside to check on his partner. He was annoyed that he couldn't rush in and stop the man from hitting Harry with
Three hours later, Harry sent the small memo zooming out of his door and to Malfoy's office; he honestly couldn't understand why he didn't just
, said he had finally found someone worth 'fighting for'. Naturally, I asked him about her, and when he said the Weaslette's name I suddenly knew what he meant. He was willing to duel you for possession of her, as it were." He rubbed his temples, and Harry followed the motion with glistening eyes. "Obviously, though, when I learned about this, I began to formulate a plan. I just didn't expect it to work so perfectly."
Malfoy actually smiled, but Harry only caught a glimpse of it before he disappeared back into the kitchen. "If you want to get cleaned up before we eat, the bathroom is down the hall, first door on the right. Towels are in the cabinet under the sink if you're taking a shower."
and saw Harry standing at the end of his driveway. "Well, it took you long enough, Potter," he teased, nevertheless taking down the wards around his property once more.
"It seems, though, that he won't let us proceed with the investigation until all of the paperwork from our previous case is handed in." Malfoy leaned closer and peered at the file on Harry's desk. "I assume that's it?"
"Well, what house number was listed in the file?" Malfoy came to a halt in the middle of the sidewalk, and glared at Harry. "What?"
They walked inside and Harry dropped his stuff next to the sofa in the parlor, sitting upon the soft cushions; Malfoy sat in the chair opposite him and set his wand on the small table in the middle. "So what happened?"
to be the person she's sleeping with." At Harry's gaping mouth and twitching eye, he waved a happy little wave as he left. "Ta-ta, Potter."
"Well, then, may Godric have mercy on my soul if I should deny the Gryffindor Golden Boy, Savior of the Wizarding World, what he wants."
He heard a man's voice groaning Ginny's name and then a few grunts, followed by Ginny's exclamation of "Oh, Blaise!" as she no doubt had her orgasm.
"Don't try to turn this around on me!" he shouted, pointing at his own chest. "I'm not the bad guy in this situation!"
Harry took the model of the Golden Snitch off of his desk and threw it at the wall next to the door, barely missing the head of the blonde that had just walked through the door, and watched as it shattered into a hundred tiny pieces. Draco Malfoy blinked at Harry and then smirked.
, Malfoy. But I might just consider it if you don't do something soon," he intoned, looking pointedly downward to his own groin.
what it means! Ever since we got married you've been distant and quiet; now you're just overbearing and annoying."
"Clearly." Harry surveyed the parlor, noting the discarded clothing all over the place. "This is what you've been doing while I'm gone? Sneaking around my back for a quick lay?"
"Okay, so I think the best place to look is back at the flat where they lived. It might give us insight on their relationship, and we can see if we can't find any more evidence," Harry suggested, taking out the personal file on Amelia Tyler; she and her husband lived at 763 Stutler Lane in London, flat 26B. "Do you want to
"What do you mean, 'what's that'?" He opened the file again and shoved the two personnel files of Amelia and Lucas Tyler in Harry's face. "This hair doesn't match either of the Tylers'. Amelia had strawberry blonde hair and Lucas was a blonde." He brought the hair in front of his face to examine it further. "This, Potter, is real evidence."
"Come now, Potter, you know I don't sully my career with measly paperwork." He waved a dismissive hand in Harry's direction. "I am a man of action, not desk work."
Ginny's affair with me to your advantage?" Harry couldn't help but smirk as the realization finally hit him; Malfoy
Harry's wand was back to being pointed at Zabini. "I didn't tell you to talk," he sneered. "And for your information, she's
"Well, that's a relief." The reply was as sarcastic as they come, and Harry clenched his fist in annoyance. "I merely came to discuss the case we've looming in front of us, Potter. The murder that happened early this week? Shacklebolt suspects domestic violence."
Malfoy mumbled something under his breath and then turned away, a blush marring his cheeks; Harry sucked in a breath at the sight, deciding that he needed to see that blush on the blonde's face more often.
“What project were you discussing with him anyway?” He asks finally, his interest piqued all of a sudden. He was so caught up in the utter wrongness of Malfoy’s presence in Grimmauld Place that he hadn’t even thought to consider why he might have been there at all.
She stares at him for a long moment before giggling. “If someone had told me two months ago that I would trust a Malfoy while I went to bed to take care of my boyfriend and my best friend, I’d have them institutionalised.”
The rage vanishes from his system as instantaneously as it had encroached upon his senses in the first place. What’s the point of being angry in the face of truth? What’s the point driving a stake into a brick wall?
Draco shrugs a little. He sees the logic but he also sees a glaring fault: “You aren’t ready for everything you will be ready for two years from now. Time is a healing process all in itself. There is hardly any reason to rush it.”
Harry, on the other hand, prefers to run his calloused fingers through Scorpius’ hair, massaging his scalp, telling stories if he’s alone and sitting with the posture of the Head Auror in a meeting with the Minister if he’s not.
He tells Harry that he likes to fix things, work with his hands and his wand, find the chinks in magic’s armour and fill them with metal. He knows they both remember the Vanishing Cabinet and Draco is almost certain that Harry will rebuff him or lecture him but Harry places a hand over his clenched fist and says nothing at all.
Harry turns to look at him. A corner of his mouth twitches up in a smile, and oh– how unfair of him– how unfair of this gorgeous, cruel man to do this to him, to smile like that, to weaponise Draco’s fondest memories against him.
“New recruits bothering you again?” Draco asks. Harry had complained and complained about it the last time they’d met, dark mutterings about the incompetence of the children and their arrogant attitudes. “They think they’re Aurors and just because they know the law they can break it,” he’d murmured into Draco’s collarbone and Draco pressed his fingers into Harry’s knotted shoulders. “They think they rule the world.”
“I built up a tolerance,” he explains to Potter. “I’ve been taking it regularly for so long that now it just… doesn’t work. I need a third of the bottle every day or I…” He looks up to see Potter still staring. His expression isn’t quite as hard, more curious than anything. If Draco allows himself, he sees traces of sympathy somewhere. “I have panic attacks. Granger called them that.”
Her eyes fly open immediately and widen at the sight of him. She struggles and tries to back away but Draco holds his hand in place desperately with no idea what else to do. She is scared, probably seeing him as a threat and he has to keep a hand over her mouth. But in the ensuing silence, he starts talking.
That day he went to town to buy groceries for the first time in his life. There had been Muggle money leftover from the pockets of the prisoners, none of the Death Eaters had seen use for it and it had remained in a drawer, locked away in an inconspicuous room of the big house. He had dug it up, taken a breath and come back with food he didn’t know how to cook.
, waiting for men in their early forties to die. I’ll be bloody lucky if it isn’t two! I can’t–” he says, swallowing, “I can’t just
Ginevra’s here with Lovegood on her arm. They’re both wearing different shades of yellow and Draco marvels at the way most couples have chosen to pair their robes to suit each other. He looks down at his own green robes that match Harry’s tie and the brown cravat and wonders if the people looking at them think they’re a couple. The thought makes his breath catch and Harry looks at him with concern.
It hadn’t died even when Harry Potter stopped being independently important, though they both liked to pretend it had.
Harry’s waiting outside the Great Hall with Hermione and Weasley whom Draco is seeing after almost seven months. The last time Draco saw Weasley was in May when he’d been wearing tattered clothes, face covered in soot, grime and blood. Now he looks transformed, standing beside Hermione in black robes. Auror training has clearly done wonders for him and Hermione seems to share this opinion if her smitten and rather awe-struck expression is anything to go by.
The roiling, curling anger finally finds a focus, and he feels his face twist into a snarl, the words coming out almost against his will but horrifyingly suited to his voice and his face and his motherfucking status—
He knows Hermione knows because one day she brings it up in casual conversation. “Did you give any thought to taking Harry to the Ball? He still doesn’t have a date. Like last time,” she says when the conversation goes from Ginevra’s breakup with Finnegan to Potter’s improving grades.
He feels his heart beating in his throat. Potter is looking at him, that same strangely vacant yet intense gaze that Draco had noticed during the Welcome Feast. That look, it haunts him. In his nightmares, in his daydreams, during his waking moments when he catches a glimpse of Potter in the hallways.
He’s taken aback by his own words because he hadn’t really thought them through- they’d just transferred themselves without his permission into the uncomfortable space between them. But Potter nods anyway and Draco feels an odd sense of both relief and finality.
Oh. He just did. He just kissed Draco stupid after Draco confessed to wanking to the sound of him jerking off. He’s solid and real under Draco’s hands and it feels like a blessing Draco does not deserve.
“Can’t we postpone this talk?” Harry asks. He knows he’s being a coward and that admission feels foreign and tastes bitter on his tongue but he wants to avoid this. He wants to avoid telling Draco the true extent of the damage done here, wants to hide from the reality. This moment, this perfect moment with them sharing body heat in a quiet, cozy room with no interruptions, no more unhappy resentment or untold desires– when faced with the prospect of losing it, Harry wants to dig his heels in and refuse to do anything that would enable that. And the impending conversation will do exactly that.
‘I don’t care,’ Draco sighs, closing his eyes and turning on his side. ‘Bought treacle tart on my way home for you from that stupid bakery you like so much. You better eat if you don’t want me to stop buying you food at all.’
He thinks he should go back to his room. Sleep it off. Maybe he’ll wake up tomorrow knowing he has done his part and owes the prat nothing. But when he reaches the door of his room, his hand hesitates on the doorknob. Instead of entering, he turns around and walks over to Hermione and Ron’s room down the corridor. Ron is probably still at George’s but Hermione is probably in. He knocks softly and Hermione’s come in! rings out loudly in the silence of the house. At first she appears surprised to see him and Harry’s heart aches with the reminder of how far he has pushed away his friends. But then she smiles, the quick, bright Hermione smile that puts him at ease instantly.
It was a horrible thought. After four years of following his father into anything, believing the man was god himself, he now could see him breaking right in front of his face. The once proud man had changed the night his old master had come back. And Draco hadn’t undersood at first. Wasn’t it a good thing that the man was back? He promised, after all, freedom and prosperity for the wizarding community. But when Draco sees the broken faces of his family, he thinks he might be the poison and not the Bezoar.
Pansy let the topic go, but Draco believed that she would talk to Daphne in private, making sure she didn’t talk to Draco that publicly again. When dinner rolled around, Draco watched Astoria and Cho Chang closely. They talked quietly with each other, glancing around, and making a piss poor job about appearing inconspicuous. He would have to talk to Daphne about that.
Potter took a deep breath. His face was still discomforted into anger, but Draco ignored that. “Fine,” hissed the green-eyes git. “I am so sorry I’m late. Ron wanted to play chess so I had to stay a bit.”
Only Zabini was not involved. The man just sat down and ignored the tension that had started to bleed into the group. Draco knew that he would have to decide where his loyalties lie in the next few months, as he was friends with Bulstrode and Nott. But Draco supposed he would stay where he was until the last possible second. It would be fitting for him.
Draco had to admire her whinny voice. It sounded very convincing. Maybe almost as good as his own fake sympathy voice.
Daphne poked him in his chest. “Malfoy. My sister has heard about some secret defence group, founded by Potter and his friends. Don’t you think that is the opposite of keeping her safe?”
Draco scoffed. “And honestly, Potter. I don’t understand how anyone could think that you are some great wizard or something. You are so pathetic and stupid that I can’t get over the fact you were actually accepted at Hogwarts.”
He snorted. “What? You think just because you are a Slytherin I will stop reporting you? What do you think will happen if you join that ridiculous group? I’m telling you, if you go through with it, you will end up dead. At least, that’s what your sister thinks.”
Daphne laughed. Her voice was shrill in the empty hallway. She stopped and held his arm to turn him towards her. “You don’t get anything, do you? We might die if she gets caught. So please, make sure she doesn’t join the group. I’m asking as your friend, please.”
Draco pulled out his wand, ready to hex that bastard for calling him a ferret when Mm Pince walked by. She looked at the weird constellation sitting in the room and tutted disapprovingly.
“Well, except me. I would have to talk to Potter, after all.” Draco shrugged his shoulders. His hands came across something metallic in her coat. He felt around it.
Potter had tears in his eyes. His whole body was shaking and his hands were balled into fists. It was rather disconcerting to see the boy who lived having a breakdown.
Potter nodded excitedly. “Yeah,” he exclaimed. “And she told you about the DA in the first place. That’s how you knew about the meeting! And on the same day, you made sure that Astoria would not join the meeting in Hogsmeade by breaking her sister’s arm.”
Sadly, the drama was not finished completely. When he came across Zabini in the dormitory, the dark-haired boy stared at him for a few seconds.
Draco snorted. They were almost at the potion’s classroom. Just a few more steps. “What will happen? You won’t get a pony for your birthday but only a new owl? I don’t think the repercussions will be that bad, Daphne. So please, shut up.”
“The meeting is this Saturday in Hogsmeade,” said Astoria. She smiled at her sister happily, not seeing the dark look that Daphne showed.
When Draco finally spotted Daphne, she was sitting alone in a corner of a room. She studiously ignored Draco’s eyes when he made his way to the Slytherin. Draco had to admit, the girl was a pretty pureblood. Her fair hair and her high cheekbones made her very similar to himself, but, Draco mused, she did not have the charisma and the confidence that he inherited. Not to mention his social standing.
“Malfoy,” Potter stood up with him. He held out his hand. “I know for a fact that you pulled out your wand. Goyle set his own plate on fire and you used that moment to cast a spell at her. Then she screamed. Ergo: you broke her arm. I want to know why.”
“So, darling”, he began. “I hope you will not spill my little secret with anyone. That would be very much appreciated.”
It had been the first time he said those words and meaning them completely. He mostly just waited till the situation blew over and then he and his friends would go on as before. But this time, he was serious. He could see the situation for as bad as it was and he knew there was nothing that he could do to protect her definitely.
He made his way through the almost silent hall. He caught Potter watching him and he gave him two fingers. Potter scowled back.
Pansy glowered at the other Slytherin and promptly started insulting her. Draco could already feel the tension growing, and he was not in the mood for another pissing contest.
Draco’s face heated. “Well, you aren’t special. You’re just some regular speccy git that I have the misfortune to know.”
When he had come back to Hogwarts, his doubt had only grown. He could see the fear in his friends’ faces, the poorly concealed terror and worry about the years that were to come. Draco still thought that the Dark Lord was worth following, but a small part of him rebelled against that idea. Wasn’t that why he so readily agreed to help Astoria and Daphne?
“Hi,” said a voice next to him. Draco turned around, wand ready, when he realised it was only the bastard-that-dared-to-be¬-fifteen-minutes-late.
Draco groaned. “Why do I always end up with destroyed clothes when we hang out?”, he asked her. “Seriously, we should stop seeing each other or I will end up without any clothes in a month or so.”
Mrs. Umbridge laughed like a toad. “Of course,” she replied. “You are my favourite student. I do hope we can agree to work together this year to ensure healthy and good-spirited atmosphere. I hope I can count on your assistance?”
Draco said nothing, but Astoria just kept on talking. She seemed almost giddy right now, her eyes sparkling and her back straight. “You already know where the meetings are held, right? You have told the other Inquisitory Squat members and Umbridge about different possible locations, but I know that you are smart enough to find the entrance. So, tell me, did you know that I might join them anyway and wanted to make sure I am safe anyway?”
Draco nodded mock-seriously. “Yeah. That’s why the first meeting is at the same time you have detention with Umbridge. Potter, if you want to fake times, make sure they are actually possible times.”
Daphne nodded and hugged him closer. She breathed deeply and when Draco started singing along to the music, she started laughing. He supposed he wasn’t as sure in the text as his friend was, but it was nice after all, he supposed.
He remembered when Weasel had gotten a Howler in second year. Now, he understood how embarrassing it might be and he did not want any part in that experience.
Daphne laughed softly. “I knew you’d ask sooner or later.” She sat up and smiled down at him. Rubbing her eyes, she stood up again and hold out her hand. He accepted readily.
Astoria nodded. “Yep, he is correct. And honestly, Draco, I think they really need your help on this.”
And of course, he hated how unconcerned his good friend Zabini was. The man had laughed in Draco’s face when he had suggested to talk about the situation, saying he didn’t give a rat’s ass about Daphne spilling the secret. Draco supposed that was fair. Him and Zabini were, after all, not friends.
The first few weeks, Draco keeps half an eye on the wayward sister. From what Draco watches, the girl spends most her time with Cho Chang, walking to classes and spends her free time playing the violin. It seems perfectly healthy, nothing too serious that he should worry about.
The third moment had been when Blaise Zabini had kissed him on his fifteenth birthday. He had been too shocked and surprised to kiss him back. Zabini had, after they were high on Gillyweed and pleasantly drunk, decided to snog him in Draco’s room. And when Draco finally had been able to breathe again, his mouth had had a mind of his own and nearly snogged Blaise senseless.
Daphne relaxed when he didn’t act furthermore. She put her hand in her pocket again and started to sing along to the lyrics in the little walking man.
“Who did this?” Harry asked him suddenly, Draco jerked awake, this got Harry attention and he realized that Draco was fallen asleep while he was tending to his cuts. Warmth  fluttering feeling invaded him this time.
None said anything for several minutes, Draco hissed several time, because it did hurt but somehow the process made him sleepy.
Fortunately for Harry, the class ended without a problem, only his mood hadn’t improved since Draco ignoring him this morning. He took one last glance at Draco and noticed he was more miserable than this morning. He itched to ask about this but he remembered the cold shoulders, he scrunched his nose, meh.... he didn’t want to waste his time concern about this git.
Ron throw his hand and sulked, “He might as well confess his feeling for him” Ron mumbling softly, Hermione only shook her head and said “Don’t mind him Harry”.
“Ron! You know what happen after the war ended right?” Hermione asked, challenging him to answer back.
Draco glared back at him but said nothing, he was not in the mood for any argument this time. They continued their lesson and once it ended Draco bolted right away from his chair and go to his room as soon as possible, leaving Potter there. The cuts still sting on his wrist.
Harry frowned and expected him to be ignored, but somehow it irritate him when it happened. ‘fine, as you wish’ Harry grumbled and focused back ahead, not long after he glanced back at him, couldn’t help himself to check his rival’s condition through the entire class time.
At first he thought to come to Madam Pomprey and asked for her help, but somehow every time he walked to the Infirmary Room, he stopped himself and retreated back. Once again he doesn’t want to give the satisfaction to the culprit, this is nothing for Draco, he used to being bullied since the war ended anyway.
“I really don’t want to do this, but I need to graduate, so you have to do this right Malfoy” Potter said. Draco glanced from his breakfast and stared at Potter and his two other people, Ron and Harmione, Draco ignored him and continued his breakfast.
“Stop acting like a child Malfoy” Harry said while tending his wound and continued “I hate you before but that’s long ago, when we still a brat. Now we are grown up, put that stupid rivalry aside will you?” Harry said without looking up.
Draco skipped his breakfast and almost too late for his class. When he arrived for Prof. Slughorn’s Class he glanced at his usual table and found Harry Potter was already there. Draco hesitated for a while but his headache and his body couldn’t stand any longer, he need to sat down right now.
Harry just stood there and stared at his retreated back, unconsciously he grabbed his own hand, fingering his scar ‘I must not tell lies’ lost in his thought.
Draco jolt a little bit, surprised at Potter’s question. He glanced to Potter and noticed his genuine expression, and worried? Draco couldn’t decipher.
“Okay class, for the next assignment. I will put you guys in pair” Professor Slughorn said and explained more about the subject, which Draco didn’t paid attention to. The clamor could be heard in the classroom, but Draco only looked to his side, to an empty chair. Surely he will be alone again like usual. No one wants to be with him, a death eater, he thought bitterly. He decided to not give a thought about the pairing, it was useless anyway, he proceed to clean and scrub the blood from his shirt, book and the table.
“Please submit by tomorrow morning” Prof Slughorn said to the class, and all the groans of dissatisfaction could be heard. “Well good luck guys” He said with a smile and left the room.
They all heard about the bullying rumor that happen to Draco and several ex-death eater Slytherins. It was not like Harry would let it go if it did happen in front of his eyes, but so far none have a proof or saw it happen to any of them.
He didn’t aware for how long he focused on the scrubbing, until someone sat next to him, on that empty chair. Draco looked up and noticed it was Potter, “what??” he said unconsciously. Harry looked at Draco without blinking and turned ahead, completely ignoring him. “Git” Draco said in silent, ‘what is he doing here?’ he asked to himself and sat straight, ignoring Potter back.
There, the words written on his left wrist again. Drawing a blood, staining the shirt and trickling to the table. Draco gritted his teeth and covered the cuts with his right palm. ‘Why now?’ he whispered, though he was aware about the cuts and wound that appeared in random times. He just wished that it was not happened during his lesson time.
Draco put his spoon and sigh, he was really tired right now. He couldn’t sleep well last night, someone clearly did want him to go mad. Draco sighed again and got up.
“We are assign for this together Malfoy, I hope you don’t slack around” Potter said without looking at him. Draco thought he must be hate him so much, well I hate you as well. “Fuck off Potter” Draco gritted back
