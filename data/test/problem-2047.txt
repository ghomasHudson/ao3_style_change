"Horcruxes are believed to be objects of utmost evil as they are created by ripping one’s soul apart during the act of murder and sealing it within an object holding great value to the one casting the spell. In reality, one does not have to be evil to create a Horcrux; many wizarding duels are to the death, and you can have a friend stand by ready to recite the spell on your behalf; it is not evil to desire an eternal life with those you love.
“I’ve thought about it,” Draco looked up to see Harry sitting on the couch, nervously clutching a book, “After you went to bed, I couldn’t stop thinking about what you said. I wish-but I guess it doesn’t matter what I wish. Did you really mean everything you said?”
"I just want to pull him off Harry," Draco assured her, "I won't attack him unless he attacks me first." Or, until he made sure Hadrian was safe, whichever happened first.
Of course, the warming charm wasn’t the only thing Harry’s lover placed on him before they left their shared flat, hence the blush. The sound of bells is soft enough, though, that his friends probably can’t even hear them. Even if they did, bells are ringing in multiple places throughout the festival site. Harry shifts again, dodging a pair of kids chasing each other through the snow, and has to bite back a gasp as another soft jingle sounds. Harry wants desperately to go home and have the bells removed, but he’s only been at the festival for five minutes; his lover hasn’t even arrived yet, having needed to stop by his parents’ house before joining Harry.
“What gifts from Santa?” Harry retorted, “I never received a single present from Santa, and I stopped believing in him before I was five.”
The rest of the afternoon and evening passed fairly quickly, and it didn't seem like long at all before Hadrian and Draco were saying good night to the adults and heading back up to their rooms. Draco sat down on the window seat and motioned for Hadrian to sit beside him.
"So you're saying we should start our own group," Draco smirked, "Of course! Who should we include?" He walked over to his bed and flopped down gracefully, beckoning Hadrian to join him.
"I marked the spells I thought you might be interested in," Bella said, "You may want to start reading it tomorrow, because I will be testing you."
One thing Harry had learned after his disastrous first session, was not to make the cockring too tight; it currently fit snugly at the base of his cock, and was enchanted to tighten only when he was on the verge of orgasming. The spell was a tricky one, and not one-hundred-percent reliable, so there was always a chance that he would be able to reach orgasm even with it on. Harry bit his lip as he wondered about purchasing some additional toys; maybe he should chance telling the twins about his habit-after swearing them to secrecy, of course-and see if there were any magical equivalents to the Muggle sex toys. If anyone would know, it would be Fred and George.
"That is the conclusion I have reached," he confirmed, "However, as I informed Draco, we won't know anything for certain until after his birthday; we may even have to wait for Hadrian's birthday to know for sure if they are mates. He could simply be reacting because his Veela recognizes Hadrian as a friend who needs protection.”
“Are you going to untie me anytime soon?” Harry prompted after a few minutes, and Draco grinned as he pinched one of Harry’s nipples, making the brunet yelp, before pushing himself to a sitting position.
“Tell me, Headmaster,” Narcissa interrupted, and Harry shivered at the ice in her tone, feeling grateful when Draco squeezed into the chair with him and pulled him into another hug, “Why have you kept Harry here, in your office, when he suffered from a BASILISK BITE! Don’t you think the nurse should have seen him? I will be registering a complaint with the School Governor’s, as well as the Child Services Witch.” Narcissa spun on her heel without waiting for an answer, “Lucius, I am taking the boys to Saint Mungo’s to have them checked over, and then we will be going home. Be sure to inform the minister about the events this evening, and let Severus know the boys are safe with me, so that he can reassure their friends.” Narcissa softened her voice as she held out her hands for Draco and Harry, who each took one. “Come along, boys; I think an early end to the school year is just what you need.”
“Hmm,” Draco hummed, stepping closer to Harry, “So, shall we go upstairs? I won’t be able to come over tomorrow night; Mother is insisting I have supper at the Manor, and I will likely stay the night there.”
"Piddy!" Lily replied, waving her arms wildly. Tiny blue lights sparkled around them, and Harry laughed in delight; Lily had a habit of using accidental magic to answer questions, just as her older brothers had when they were her age. According to his husband, that was normal for magical children. Speaking of his husband...Harry and Lily had arrived in the drawing room, but Draco was nowhere to be found. James was playing chess against the combined efforts of Albus and Scorpius, and Teddy was laughing at the game while writing a letter. A second scan of the room proved that Draco was not there, and Harry, after turning Lily over to "My Teddy!", headed towards the kitchen, thinking that perhaps Draco was getting cocoa for everyone.
"Um…Malfoy? Can you let go of my hair now?" He asked, "I promise I'll try not to freak out any more."
“Mmm, but this is so much more fun,” Draco replied with a wicked smirk, “Don’t you agree?” Harry mock-glared at the blond, but couldn’t hold the expression. He shook his head again, then started to pull Draco back down for another kiss. The moment their lips touched, the room exploded in chaos.
"True," Hadrian nodded, "But I won't be a stupid slimy Slytherin git; I'll just be a normal Slytherin."
“That is something else I need to discuss with the Headmaster,” Mr. Lucius said darkly, “Narcissa, I am going to find Headmaster Dumbledore will you-”
"I'm interested to see what sort of potions are in there," Draco agreed, "Do you get the feeling that they are purposefully keeping us from the actual journals?"
Harry nodded, bashful now that Draco was looking at him. Draco smirked, and slid his hand into Harry’s thick locks, his expression softening to a smile when those brilliant emerald eyes met his own gaze. Draco leaned in slowly, giving Harry a chance to back away; Harry closed his eyes, and Draco closed the last inch. It was a chaste kiss, just lips against lips, and Draco felt Harry relax into him. Draco parted his lips slightly, deepening the kiss, but being careful not to pressure the other boy. Harry responded hesitantly, one hand reaching up to cup the back of Draco’s neck.
"I-just-shut it you," Hadrian said, before quickly changing the subject, "So, when we get back from Diagon Alley do you think we can go flying? Maybe we can play a Seeker's game."
Narcissa set the picture down with a scowl; if only Dumbledore hadn't appeared their children could have grown up together happily. Instead, all the children grew up with false memories, Hadrian grew up with abusive Muggles who kept him ignorant of his true place in life, and Helena-Hermione-and Lillian-Ginny- were taken from their rightful families. All of their lives were disrupted by that meddlesome fool, and Narcissa made a promise to herself-
"I am indeed," Severus replied, "I apologize for being unreachable for so long, however I had an emergency to help Mr. Malfoy with. Now, what's this about Potter being in danger?" He scowled for effect, "It's barely even summer; I shouldn't have to worry about him for another few months, at least. Did he use un-authorized magic again?"
“Good morning, dear,” Mrs. Weasley greeted him, “You really didn’t have to come in so early, Ginny and I have everything covered here.”
“You’re crazy!” Harry said, once the blond had finished, “How could you-we’re only sixteen, for Merlin’s sake! How can you say you want to spend the rest of your life with me? You barely even know me, and we haven’t even been friends for a year! I mean…this is insane!”
“Why should I let you come? What will you give me?” The voice is pure sex, making my cock throb even harder; a warm tongue laps at the head, and I would be ashamed of the whimpers escaping my throat if I wasn’t already so desperate. “Well?” he demands, “What will you give me?”
“…and if I don’t, then I stop being Santa Clause,” Draco looked at Harry expectantly once he finished explaining about the Spousal Clause.
"Harry James Potter!" she cried, rushing across the room, only to come to a sudden stop when Draco moved to stand between her and Hadrian. "What has gotten into you? First you accuse us of betraying you, then you seek safety with the Malfoy's and beat up Ron, and now you're dating Malfoy?! Have you lost your mind?"
“You are not going to the school,” Lucius countered, “That would be the epitome of foolish Gryffindor behavior and, last time I checked, you were neither foolish nor a Gryffindor. The moment you step inside the school, Dumbledore will have the aurors down on you; even if you manage to escape, Dumbledore will realize you have your memories back, and he might decide Hadrian is no longer useful to him. You, my friend, cannot go out searching for him; you must leave that to Cissa, Draco and Severus.”
Severus spent the next few hours trying to decide what to do, and he finally came to the conclusion that he would have to tell his lord, even if it meant feeling the wrath of his displeasure-the Dark Lord needed to know the truth. The hardest thing to come to terms with was the truth about Potter; how in Merlin's name would he ever be able to explain
"I believe we will work on Bella first," Tom said thoughtfully, "Correcting the damage inflicted by Dumbledore will be difficult, especially not knowing exactly what was done to them.”
“I wasn’t joking,” Draco replied, taking a step closer to the brunet, “I have no objections to bonding with you-although I would prefer to be out of school first-but I would not want it to be forced. For now, however, I would settle for expanding upon our truce, getting to know one another better. What do you say, Potter?” Draco calmed his heart and extended his hand in friendship, silently praying that it would be different this time around. Potter looked from his face to his outstretched hand, then back at his face.
“You can still get off me now,” Hadrian said, and this time he succeeded in pushing Draco away so that he could sit up, “What time is it?” Draco lazily reached out his hand to summon his wand and then cast a Tempus.
"Alright boys, Madam Malkin should be waiting for us in the main room," Narcissa informed them, "Come along." She ushered them into the main shop where they were greeted by Madam Malkin. For the next two hours Hadrian had to suffer through being measured and fitted for robes, and then he had to try on everything that caught either of the Malfoy's fancy. By the time they were done choosing his clothing, Hadrian was about ready to take a nap.
Harry looked like a wet dream, his creamy skin almost glowing against the black silk sheets. His arms and legs were spread and bound to the bed posts, his muscles tightening as he reflexively tested the bonds. His cheeks were flushed, and his wild hair was messier than ever. Draco looked at the ball gag and frowned; he’d have to get rid of that soon, but first…
“Astoria and I will still raise the child together,” Draco said, “Astoria and I were never in love, so this won’t be some hostile relationship where we fight all the time; we will have the child together to make our parents happy, and then we will both be free to find out own happiness. Although, I rather think I have already found my happiness, if you are willing to
“Nothing about a Malfoy is ever normal,” Draco scoffed, “Malfoy’s are exceptional, and above all others. You should already know this, Hades.”
“Every time you won, it was luck,” Malfoy frowned, “Just, circumstances of fate. Luck doesn’t work like that though; it seems almost like destiny is guiding you against the Dark Lord.”
“Good; the potion is wearing off,” Vernon noted, “You have ten minutes to collect yourself, then you will find your aunt and receive your list of chores. You will not be permitted to eat or sleep until they are done, do you understand?”
“Draco?” Harry asked, once the train started moving, “Earlier, you said “our bond”. It’s not a friendship bond, is it?”
"I suppose I can understand that," Lucius said reluctantly, "But how do you plan to do that? I always thought that once the soul was separated there was no way to repair the damage."
"Oh no you weren't," Draco said breathlessly, "You were speaking in Parsletongue, and it was very…I think I need to sit down before I do something to embarrass you again." Hadrian glanced at Draco as the blonde sat down and noticed the faint flush on his cheeks; without meaning to he glanced down and then quickly away, his own cheeks becoming red as he noticed the bulge in Draco's trousers.
At that moment, Harry felt a burning pain in his scar, and he quickly got up from the table. He made it to a small alcove off the Great Hall, and then collapsed as he was pulled into a vision.
“What are your plans, Narcissa?” she demanded, “How do you expect to best Dumbledore when he has fooled the entire wizarding world?”
“Deal,” Draco replied, putting a lid on the inkwell and placing the unfinished letter in the top drawer of the desk, “Breakfast?”
“I agree, but I still think she did a good job of taking care of herself,” Draco said, “She did not let that idiot harm her, and she stood up to Brandon. I believe the hardest thing for Aracely was when her mother did not take her side; she looked extremely shocked by this.”
“Really?” Draco lifted Arden off his shoulders and set him on the bed, then picked up the package and examined it curiously, “Do you think it’s safe to open?”
It was after sunset on the Winter Solstice; Harry and Draco had their wedding-or, more accurately, their bonding ceremony-earlier that morning. After celebrating with family and friends, the two had climbed into the waiting sleigh-it was just big enough for two people, and light enough that it could be pulled by one reindeer-and Crispin had taken flight.
"That was graceful," Draco teased, helping Hadrian brush his clothes off, "You really must learn how to exit the Floo without making such a mess." Hadrian stuck his tongue out at Draco and stepped out of the way just as Narcissa came through.
"Luna and Neville for sure," Hadrian replied, sitting down next to Draco on the bed, "Also the twins. Ginny and Hermione, once we talk to them. We'll have to sound out our other classmates once school starts. Do you have any ideas about who we should invite?"
Before he could question further, Harry heard footsteps approaching, and he looked around for a place to hide; there was nowhere big enough for him to hide, but he quickly picked Dobby up and carried him over to the wardrobe in the corner, laying him carefully down and cautioning him to be silent, before shutting the door and returning to the middle of the room. Harry watched as the doorknob turned, and his eyes widened as he saw Dumbledore enter.
“What are you talking about, Potter?” He demanded, “It’s obvious I won; I made thirty Galleons more than you.”
“Explain,” Grip hook’s gaze was sharp as he gave Severus his full attention, but the Potions Master was not the one to speak up.
“The food hasn’t been sent up yet,” Draco replied, drawing his wand to cast a Tempus, “We still have an hour before supper. My early years were not quite as eventful as yours, so that should give me enough time to tell you about my childhood.”
"If I had fallen for a Muggleborn, my parents would have disapproved, but given him a chance to prove himself; as the youngest I had the least expectations to live up to. When Andromeda chose to elope with that Tonks boy, she broke the betrothal and shamed our family. Mother was able to salvage the situation by offering me as a better match for Lucius, and the Malfoy's agreed to change the betrothal contract. Aunt Walburga, however, was not placated and she forced Mother and Father to disown Andromeda, or face being removed from the family as well. Father set aside a vault for Andromeda, but she was incensed at being disowned and refused any assistance from our family.
"Well, it would be best to tell him now before it is too late," Lucius pointed out, focusing his attention on the brunet sitting next to his son, "Hadrian, what do you know of Veela's?"
"No," Hermione shook her head, "Whatever the Dursley's did to you, I'm certain Professor Dumbledore didn't know about it, and he would never knowingly leave you in an abusive home. I think you must have just imagined that conversation because you still blame the headmaster for Sirius' death, even though you were the one who chose to go to the ministry. You have to take responsibility for your own actions, Harry-and I am not calling you by that ridiculous new name-you can't place the blame with other people." A soft growling sound filled the room, and Hermione's eyes widened when she saw that Draco's eyes had gone silver again, and Hadrian was struggling to hold him back from attacking. "And that's another thing!" She continued bravely-or foolishly, depending on how you looked at it; "How can you be friends with someone who spent the last five years tormenting us, and who wants to attack me even now!"
“Fuck. I’m gonna have to talk to Snape,” Harry groaned, flopping back onto his bed. He didn’t want to talk to his most-hated professor, but he was the only person Harry thought would be completely objective about this. The only problem was getting Snape to answer him without telling the headmaster.
"That's right," Hadrian smiled sleepily, "Now when people talk about their parents I can be part of the conversation; I've never been able to do that before."
"I believe we can use Hadrian," Severus said, "I have been reviewing those memories myself, and I believe that when Dumbledore forced Tom to curse Hadrian it made him into a Horcrux as well; the potion I am developing will allow us to remove Tom's soul from Hadrian without causing the boy harm, but in the meantime there is a spell where you can use one Horcrux to locate others."
"I don't care what Mother said," Draco pouted, "I told you you're staying in here; I want you where I can keep an eye on you. Is it really that important for you to have your own room?" He took his hand away to allow Hadrian to speak. The brunet bit his lip, taking a moment to think before responding.
"Lucius, Severus and Tom are planning most of it," Narcissa began, "However I will be glad to tell you what I know and get your input. When Lucius and Severus return this evening, you can speak to them as well." Narcissa settled more comfortably in her seat and prepared to bring her friends up to date on current events, glad that she was able to speak to them again, even if they were technically just memories.
“About being Santa Clause?” Draco nodded, and Harry smiled, “It’s going to take time for me to get used to all this, but I think I’m beginning to believe you.”
“Not so smart now, are you freak?” Harry’s eyes widened and he turned back to the window, but Vernon was faster; he kicked Harry in the side, knocking the wind out of him-and likely cracking a rib or two-then pulled the boy’s arms behind his back and bound them tightly with rope. Once Harry was bound, he gave him a few drops of healing potion (“Can’t have you being useless.”), then grabbed Harry by his hair and dragged him out into the hallway.
"As if I would ever be scared of you, Potter," Draco scoffed, before turning back to the kids, "Now, what color lights do we want on the tree?"
“I’m back on Privet Drive?” Harry questioned, and Dumbledore nodded, “Oh. This doesn’t look like my room, though-where am I?”
“I was unaware that your parents had an ulterior reason for pushing you to get married,” Draco replied after a moment, “As for me…my parents simply feel that I have been putting it off for long enough, and Mother desires a grandson.”
“You should tell them soon,” Lily urged, “With Hadrian’s birthday coming up soon you will need to prepare.”
“He left all of his belongings at the manor,” Severus shook his head, “As you know, there are certain items he would not leave behind even if it meant the difference between life and death. If you like, I can gather those items and bring them here-perhaps that would convince the Malfoy’s that Potter left willingly and they would not be in the Order’s way while we search for the boy.”
Late one night, the second weekend of seventh year, Harry Potter was having trouble sleeping. This time it wasn’t due to nightmares, but rather his own raging hormones. At seventeen, Harry had no sexual experience other than his own hand-he had been too busy fighting Voldemort, the Great Tosser-may he rot in pieces for eternity-and he frequently found himself feeling sexually frustrated. Wanking was no longer as enjoyable as it had once been, and Harry, not being willing to just sleep with someone unless he had feelings for that person, had no one to experiment with. What he did have, however, was access to several X-rated magazines, compliments of Seamus, who was a well know sex fiend. The Irishman had any type of porn magazine you could think of-heterosexual, homosexual, big tits, big ass, big cock, bondage…Harry had to admit, if only to himself, that it was the last magazine he found the most interesting. He had used a duplication spell on several of Seamus’ magazines with male bondage; some had a female dominant and others had a male dominant and, while he enjoyed looking at both, Harry found that it was the magazines where both the dominant and submissive were males that really turned him on.
When Draco removed his fingers, Harry couldn’t stop the whimper that escaped, nor could he help pushing back to follow them. A firm hand on his lower back kept Harry in place, and then he felt something much larger at his entrance. He focused on his breathing as he was breached, fighting to stay relaxed even as he found himself in a world of pressure. Draco moved slowly, and kept stroking Harry’s erection to provide a distraction from the pain. When he finally bottomed out, Draco stilled, leaning forward so that he could press kisses to the back of Harry’s neck. Draco’s hands moved to Harry’s sides and stroked over them soothingly until Harry arched back against his lover, signaling that it was okay to move.
"After I admitted that I might need to consider whether or not I was gay," Hadrian began, "Neville looked over my shoulder and said that you and Luna were kissing, and...I guess it upset me. Of course, you two were just playing chess, and Neville was being a prat, so...yeah."
"No need," Narcissa interrupted gently, "Tom sent over some money early this morning to pay for anything you might need; you don't have to worry about money yourself any longer now that you have him. Now, let's go to Gringotts and then you boys can be off."
"The magic from my inheritance seems to have started out bond," Draco said, "Normally we wouldn't begin to form a bond until after we both turned sixteen, but it's started early; most Veela's don't get to be around their mate until after the mate reaches the age of sixteen, so this is rather new and not very well documented."
"Um, I'll pass thanks," Hadrian said, "Not a big fan of polyjuice potion. I can wear my cloak though, if you think I should."
Draco hid a smirk at Hadrian’s blush, silently vowing to make the brunet blush more often; it made him look innocent-and very attractive. Draco absently noted his new thoughts about his former rival, and quickly decided he was okay with it; Hadrian was attractive, powerful and interesting to talk to-why shouldn't Draco be interested in him? Not to mention, it was highly likely that Hadrian was his mate, so there was no point worrying about it anyway.
Draco watched as Potter shifted his weight from one foot to the other, and wondered whether he had intended to cause himself such discomfort…a glance at the chains and the dildo-Draco estimated that it was approximately six inches in length and a couple inches in diameter-assured him that Potter had arranged for the discomfort on purpose; there were other ways to experiment with bondage which would have been vastly more comfortable.
“I love you too, Draco,” Harry laughed, leaning up to return the kiss, “Even if you are a spoiled prat.”
"Shh! The boy is upstairs so you'd better be quiet if you don't want him to know you're here," Aunt Petunia snapped, "I suppose you would like the usual status report?"
The scene faded again, and then showed the Great Hall in Hogwarts, where the group (The Riddles, Malfoy’s, Potter’s, Rabastan, Rodolphus and Bellatrix, Regulus, Sirius and Remus, the Longbottom’s, minus Augusta, and Severus) was gathered at what was normally the Slytherin table, while Dumbledore and a group of other wizards-they must have been his supporters, because Harry recognized Arthur and Molly Weasley, Minerva McGonagall and a young-looking Kingsley, as well as Mad-Eye Moody-were sitting at the teachers table.
"Can we talk about why I ran away later?" Harry asked, "And I don't think you poisoned it I just...I don't feel very hungry." He took another bit of the apple and felt a wave of nausea break over him as the welts on his back began to burn; Harry closed his eyes and grasped the edge of the table, forcing himself to breathe evenly as the pain increased.
"Perhaps the one who helped Hadrian escape in the first place can show us where they live," Narcissa suggested, and Draco's eyes lit up as he called, "Dobby!" The house elf appeared immediately and bowed to Draco.
At this point the wizard walked in front of Harry and he beheld the pale visage and silvery hair of Draco Malfoy, whose blue-grey eyes were full of curiosity and excitement rather than the usual disdain he showed for Harry. Then, those silvery eyes met his, and Draco froze, staring before his gaze slowly trailed up and Harry could tell the exact moment that Draco had spotted his marking by the way the blonde gaped and then slowly smirked. "Leave Wispy," Draco commanded, "I can take care of this-wait. Wispy, as Master here I order you to tell no one of this incident, do you hear me? If you breathe a word of this to anyone, you will get clothes."
“Ah yes,” Draco said, “Some of the books are heavy on Latin, and runes are a requirement for most rituals. You can try a newer book, or I can find a book on rune translations and teach you the spell to translate Latin to English.”
“Go to sleep,” Harry said, “I’ll hex you if you don’t.” Silence. Harry felt himself drifting off, only to be woken by his name being whispered again.
“You can read my new book!” Teddy exclaimed, “I saw the movie with Uncle George, and he bought me the book about it! It’s my favorite Christmas story ever!”
"Yeah; shouldn't be a problem," Fred replied just as the door opened, revealing Hadrian and George, the former of which was carrying a small package and smiling in a very self-satisfied sort of way.
Hadrian was lucky as well, because Laurent wrote that some Veela will use their Allure to complete a mate bond when they feel threatened; Draco had started to do that last night, Hadrian was sure, but he managed to snap the blond out of it. Hadrian was glad, because he would have been pissed if Draco used magic to make him complete the bond. By the time Draco finished getting ready for breakfast, Hadrian knew more about what he could expect to happen between now and the time when they completed the bond.
"I believe so," Draco replied, "Mother should be able to fix him right up; how did you know to show up?"
"I took it from my uncles study before I ran away," Hadrian replied with a shrug, "I don't know what's in it, but I'm guessing it's mine-either that or it belonged to James and Lily. I-I'm not sure if I want to deal with whatever is inside it tonight; maybe I should wait until tomorrow to look through it."
“Of course not,” Hadrian scoffed, “I just never thought you’d willingly have a conversation with Luna, especially after the way you were glaring at her earlier.”
"Maybe I don't feel like flying," Draco retorted, "Did you ever think of that? You didn't even ask me Hades."
“Draco?” Harry called out, wondering if he had arrived before the blond was ready to see him; Draco told him five minutes, but the other man may have decided to take a shower before talking to him.
"Oh, I'll get you for that remark Hades," Draco promised as he followed the brunet out the door, quickly catching up to him and linking arms, "You just wait." Hadrian simply gave him a small laugh and a cheeky grin as they headed downstairs.
"I understand your concern," Dumbledore said soothingly, "however Harry needs to spend time with his relatives to renew the blood protection that is within him; if he doesn't go back it would be an insult to Lily's memory, her sacrifice. Don't worry Remus-I will explain everything to Harry and take full responsibility for sending him back. In addition, I will set up regular patrols to check on him so that we can be certain he is not being mistreated by his relative's."
“Hadrian gifted it to him for his birthday,” Narcissa replied, “He found it in a shop in Diagon Alley.”
"Of course not," Draco scoffed, "like I would consent to snog a Weasley-your red hair and freckles would clash terribly with my own more aristocratic features."
"Then what do you want us to do?" Vernon demanded, "We can't beat him as we did when he was younger; the second he starts to feel that we have crossed some line his freakishness comes out and protects him!"
“If Hadrian doesn't want to cooperate you can force-feed him this sleeping draught. I'll see you in a few hours." He nodded at the boys and then swept out of the room, Lucius and the pensieve floating along in a bubble in front of him; once Severus was gone Draco whispered something and the door swung closed.
“Harry,” The Snow Queen-Malfoy’s mother! - said, “I promised you safety last night, and I always honor my word. Please have a seat, and I will explain after breakfast. If, after that, you wish to leave, I will return you to Hogwarts.”
Hadrian looked over at the bed and saw that Draco was beginning to stir, his arms reaching out for something that wasn’t there. After a moment, the Veela sat up, looking around in confusion.
"Now don't be like that," Pansy purred, sliding her arms up to encircle Hadrian's neck, "Draco and I aren't together right now, so he can't get mad at us. It's just one dance Harry."
“We’ll give them a chance first,” Hadrian interrupted, “Right now, no one knows about us, and it might take time for people to get used to it.” Hadrian suddenly realized that he was standing there, having a conversation with Draco while his robe was wide open, giving the blond a good look at his front. He quickly dropped his wand on the bed and began to get dressed in the clothes Draco had picked out for him. He kept his back to the Veela until he was dressed, then turned around to find that Draco was standing right behind him, less than two feet away. “I won’t let you use your Veela-ness to take advantage of me though.”
"And this conversation is better held elsewhere," Fred spoke up, "We don't have any customers at the moment, but that could quickly change. Come on." He led them to the back of the store, where Lee Jordan was going through some boxes. "Oi! Lee! Watch the store for a bit? I'll be upstairs if you need anything."
Draco stood in the doorway of the living room, watching as Harry and Teddy worked on creating their own Christmas ornaments. Harry had talked Draco into celebrating Christmas the Muggle way, and that evidently included handmade ornaments. It also included chopping down a tree (although Draco convinced Harry to let him transport it with magic instead, seeing no point in killing a tree just for decoration; this way, after the holiday, the tree could be replanted.), stringing up lights, and using stencils and a can of fake snow to make winter scenes on the windows. It was all a little odd, but Draco supposed it was charming in its own way. Even if he had no desire to celebrate anything the Muggle way, he would never deny Harry his wish; after learning about the deprivation Harry suffered while living with his Muggle relatives, Draco found it hard to deny his fiancé anything he wanted. Honestly, most days Draco still couldn’t believe he and Harry were actually together, happily sharing a home. They been together for four years now, and it all started with Draco needing a new wand.
“The second option,” Malfoy interrupted, not waiting to hear what the other option was, “I believe in honor and loyalty to family. I can’t imagine letting anyone treat me the way the Dark Lord treats my father. I can’t believe my father lets the Dark Lord treat him like that.”
"Would you like me to tell them?" Draco offered, "I'm sure you're tired of repeating everything by now."
“Draco?” The hesitant voice interrupted Draco’s thoughts, and he carefully set the quill down before turning to face Harry.
“I, Draco Malfoy, accept the oath given by Harry Potter,” Draco answered, “In return for his faithfulness, I grant him access to my own magic, so that we can free the world from the evil that is the Dark Lord Voldemort. I will honor his oath, and protect that which he has given into my keeping with everything that I have. From this day forth, I swear to be faithful only to Harry Potter, so mote it be.”
"I-it-just-you-" Hadrian stuttered, "You know what? Next time you embarrass me, I'm just going to hex you! My father is the Dark Lord and, as his heir, I am owed some respect!" He turned around and glared at Draco as the blond burst into laughter.
All of that meant that Harry had several different components available for wand crafting, and thus each wand was completely unique. Harry’s crafting method was also different from other wandmakers, as the only tool he used to craft wands was his own magic. Harry also enjoyed experimenting with combining different wand cores, and he was one of the few wandmakers that used crystals in his crafting. Because of Harry’s specialized process, it took nearly two weeks for Draco’s new wand to be finished.
“This time I will count, but I will not give verbal instructions,” Draco told him, “Ready?” He didn’t wait for an answer, but began counting as he guided Harry around the room once more; “One, two, three…One, two, three…no, not that way Harry.” Harry flushed as he stepped on Draco’s foot; he lowered his eyes so that he could see what he was doing, only for Draco to reprimand him again. “No, don’t watch your feet; look at me.” Harry lifted his head only for his gaze to be captured by smoldering blue-grey eyes. He missed a step again, but Draco didn’t say anything about it; the blond just continued to lead him around the room in a waltz that seemed as if it existed outside of time.
“Nargles and Nibbles?” Draco countered, “If you let Lovegood have as much input in the wares as she did in choosing the name, you’ll go out of business before the end of the month.”
Harry stripped, tossing his clothes carelessly on the floor, then quickly stretched himself and inserted the vibrating plug and slipped the cockring on before climbing onto the bed. He looked at the ropes for a moment, debating on how he wanted to be bound, and eventually settled for lying on his back. He reached out to touch the rope nearest his left hand, and the soft material slowly wound itself around his left wrist; a few seconds later he felt the rope wind around his ankles and his right wrist, and then he gasped when the ropes pulled taut, stretching him so that he lay spread-eagle on the bed. Harry barely had time to test his restraints, and then the plug began vibrating.
Harry had awoken that morning to find that his dream of being rescued by a Snow Queen hadn’t been a dream at all. The Snow Imp that woke him up had assured him that he was a most welcome guest, and the Her Majesty and His Highness were eager for Harry to join them for breakfast. The Imp-a male named Frost-had then directed Harry to the shower, and left out warm clothing for him to dress in. A pair of grey trousers, a dark green tunic-type shirt with long sleeves, and grey knee-high boots made up his outfit. An arm holster was provided for his wand as well, and Frost reappeared just after Harry secured it. Ten minutes later, and Harry was standing outside the dining room, steeling himself to meet the Snow Queen again-and be introduced to her son.
"Of course," Narcissa smiled, "I will have a house elf bring a few upstairs for you; in the meantime, we have covered the most important aspects of Draco's Inheritance, so you boys can go flying now if you like; a house elf will summon you for tea."
“Dobby is not climbing down!” the House Elf cried, “Dobby is being sorry, but Dobby is not climbing. Dobby is not liking climbing.”
"You're just a sore loser," Draco teased, as both boys flew back towards the ground, "And now you owe me a forfeit...that's in addition to the life debt you already owe me."
"We do have your best interests at heart," Narcissa said, "If this situation is still going on once you turn seventeen then we will gladly allow you to join the Order, but you should enjoy being young while you can. Now, how do you feel about going shopping tomorrow? I'm sure you would like to get some new clothing."
Santa Clause woke up to a bright, sunny afternoon sky on Christmas Day. The night before had gone as splendidly as he could have hoped for, and he had fallen into bed, exhausted, at dawn. Santa whistled as he got dressed for the day ahead; Christmas Eve marked the beginning of his favorite time of the year, and he always woke up smiling on Christmas Day. Today, Santa would be leaving the North Pole for a month to visit his son.
"I didn't-" Draco slammed his hand against the wall next to Hadrian's head, making the smaller boy fall silent; "You are mine!" Hadrian swallowed nervously as Draco grabbed a fistful of his locks and pulled his head back, forcing him to meet angry steel eyes. He silently cursed Pansy, as he realized that, thanks to her actions, he now had to deal with an irate, homicidal Veela...
“You realize that watching someone sleep might make people think you’re a creep,” Harry said, and Draco turned to smirk at him.
“I love you too, Draco,” Harry replied, beginning to lean in for another kiss; they were interrupted by the sound of someone pointedly clearing their throat, and Harry stepped back with a soft chuckle. “I guess you had better go settle your riot.”
Hadrian walked over to the trunk, and immediately noticed there was something wrong with it; his wand was lying in the top, but the other items inside did not belong to him. The books were all brand-new, and the usual layer of rubbish was missing, along with his invisibility cloak and the Marauder’s Map. Picking up his wand, he realized that it felt different; upon closer inspection, he noticed that the wood was darker-this wand obviously wasn’t his. Which made sense really. If what Dobby said was true, then all of Harry’s-Hadrian’s-things would be at Malfoy Manor. Knowing Dumbledore, the wand probably didn’t even work properly, or it might have a spell on it to alert he Headmaster when it was used. With a sigh, Hadrian acknowledged that he was stuck for the time being. He just had to hope that Professor Snape would show up soon, and that the professor would be willing to help him escape. In the meantime, there was nothing to do but sleep.
"To be fair, he probably thought that the memory charms he cast before your deaths would still be in place," Narcissa said calmly, "Dumbledore never did spend much time studying subjects that had to do with death; he always felt himself above such nonsense. I must say I am glad to finally have my memories back, and young Hadrian is finally safe with us."
"Good idea Hades," Draco nodded, "You move on and forget about them, and your dad can worry about the whole revenge thing. Isn't it great that you get to stay here from now on?"
“You can’t avoid him forever,” Ginny said; it was later that night, and she was helping him close up, “His shop is right across from yours, for one thing.”
"I'm game," Ginny said, "And…I'm sorry for the other day, with Ron. Even though I was hurt that you chose Malfoy-Draco-over us, I still shouldn't have stopped him from helping you. Can you forgive me?"
“Are you sure?” Harry asked, pretending to be concerned, “I mean, I know you’ve never taken on anyone by yourself; you sure you don’t need your lackeys help? I’d hate for you to-Oh! Um, hi Mrs. Figg.” Harry widened his eyes and smiled at something behind Dudley, causing his cousin and his friends to spin around; Harry took the chance and pushed through the distracted boys.
"I'd love to Tom," she leaned over to kiss his cheek before standing up, "I'll see you tonight at half-ten."
"I will tell Dumbledore that Hadrian-that is, Harry-is asking to see Lupin," Severus said, "and guarantee him safe passage to the manor. It is unfortunate that we cannot to get him here today, before Draco's inheritance comes into effect; I rather think the werewolf and Veela may have some issues with one another."
Left with no choice, Harry allowed his friends to come with him to the ministry, and he had to admit he was glad that he wasn’t alone.
use a personal slave," Draco mused, "House elves just don't know how to add those personal details that a wizard would…"
“Kidnap?!” Arthur Weasley shook his head, his eyes wide with shock and worry, “No, no, Harry; I didn’t kidnap you! The Malfoy’s are a Dark family Harry; I had to save you from them. I don’t know how they managed to take you from your aunt and uncle’s house-”
“You can get me out of here,” Harry replied and then added, after a moment’s thought, “And Malfoy too, if he wants to come.”
"What? No!” He shook his head vehemently, “You know there's nothing between Luna and me. We're just friends, and she's one of the only girls I feel comfortable just hanging out with.” A pause, then, “Do you think Draco likes her?" Hadrian felt stupid for asking the question, but he couldn't help himself; the two blondes looked cozy and, for some reason, the thought of Draco liking Luna made Hadrian feel…well, he didn't like it, that's for sure.
“I believe my robes from last year will suffice,” Draco replied, holding out his hand and summoning them. The robes were dark green velvet embroidered with silver thread and had soft white fur on the cuffs of the sleeves and the edge of the hood; Harry had gifted them to Draco last year and he shot Blaise a smug smile, happy that Draco liked them enough to wear them again this year.
"I believe he will be here for dinner," Lucius told him, "He is spending the day meeting with various Death Eater's; he cannot make radical changes overnight, so he is working on slowly changing the way things work, and shifting the Death Eater's focus away from you onto Dumbledore. I will send him an owl to let him know you want to talk to him."
“Hey, it’s okay Pup!” Sirius quickly wrapped him in a hug, “This is a good thing; it’s nothing bad! I know it’s a little unexpected, but…Harry, being an Omega is a wonderful thing!”
"We can talk to the twins’ tomorrow," Hadrian said, "They opened their new shop in Diagon Alley and I'm sure they will be there; we just need to avoid the rest of the Weasley's. By the way, when are you going to remove this stupid collar?"
"I want it," Hadrian said, "This dragon is beautiful," he laughed as the dragon sat up, preening, "and has Draco's personality. I don't care how much it costs; I'll get some more money from Tom if I have to."
"Very good, Ginerva," Draco said with a small smirk, "Hadrian is my mate, and I don't take any threats lightly. Which reminds me; tell the Weasel that he is going to pay for the injuries he inflicted on my mate. At the time I was more worried about Hadrian's safety, but Ronald will be held accountable for his actions." He paused thoughtfully before adding, "I'm still trying to decide whether I should punish the two of you for standing back and letting it happen. Of course, that is a concern for another time." Draco drew his wand and conjured a wide armchair; he led Hadrian over to it and sat down before pulling the brunet to sit in his lap.
"Yes," Lucius confirmed, "We will have to work slowly and carefully choose whose memories to restore first so that Dumbledore does not find out in time to stop us. We also plan to try and heal those that were damaged by him; are you aware of any of the details about what happened?"
“Maybe next time,” Draco said, “Harry and I have to finish getting the house ready so that you and Andy can spend Christmas with us. Next time you come over, you can tell us all about the cartoons, okay?”
"If you think of anything else, do not hesitate to ask," Narcissa said, "Now, Draco, would you like to play a game of Chess with me?" Draco agreed, and they moved from the table over to the other side of the parlor, where a Chess table was set up. Hadrian sat next to Draco, intent on learning how to play better-Ron was an excellent player, but a terrible teacher-while Lucius and Severus sat in a pair of chairs nearby, discussing something in quiet voices.
“Oh, right.” Harry summoned his wand- which he had placed on the nightstand- and tapped one of the bells, “Bed.” A dozen or so bells unwound from his hair and gathered in his hand; Harry banished them to the nightstand and put his wand back as well before snuggling up against Draco. The blond’s breaths were deep and even, and Harry thought Draco was asleep until the other man called his name again.
"If so, he must have begun turning her against our family when she first started at Hogwarts, and what purpose would that serve?" Narcissa replied, "He couldn't have known then what would happen with your parents and the Potter's."
“Okay,” Harry agreed, sitting down and pulling his legs up to his chest, “I remember coming home after the Order told the Dursley’s to be nice to me, and then Uncle Vernon locked me in my room. Er…that’s actually the last thing I remember, then I was waking up in the woods. I don’t know how I ended up in the woods, or why Dobby took me to…well, I guess it was Malfoy Manor? I saw Lucius Malfoy, and I think Voldemort was with him. It’s weird though, because I didn’t remember Malfoy at first; did I hit my head and lose my memory or something?”
“Always,” Draco rushed forwards, pushing Harry down onto the couch, “The question is, are you desperate for me?” Draco knelt between his husband’s legs, one hand tangling in soft black hair, while the other slid under Harry’s shirt to caress his stomach.
"I do not want to hear about what Draco has up his ass," George interrupted, "Nor do I want to know what you would like to put up his ass."
“Good,” Luna said serenely, as she slipped off of Hadrian’s lap and stood in front of Draco, gazing at him expectantly, “Now Draco and I can find a way to make sure they don't come back.” Draco was too stunned to protest when Luna grabbed his hand to pull him out of the chair, and Hadrian watched in bemusement as the Ravenclaw led Draco to the other side of the room.
“This wasn’t what I meant by getting to know each other better,” Harry laughed breathlessly, “I thought we would talk.”
"Of course not like that," Draco assured him, turning to glare at Severus, "I read up on it as well-I have been reading up on Veela instincts for the past two years just in case-and I was intending to speak to Hadrian about it in private before we go to bed tonight. Punishment would be something fitting the whatever you did; for example, if you ran off into the Forbidden Forest to play with giant spiders and wound up getting hurt I might tell you not to go to the next Hogsmeade weekend or something along those lines. I really don't have it all planned out-from what I have read it is mostly instinct, however I would never harm you."
“I had a lovely time, Draco,” Luna stood up, “We should be going though, before Daddy starts to worry.”
“Too…slow,” Harry panted, grinning; Draco responded by pulling Harry’s legs up to rest on his shoulders and then leaning forward so that the brunet was bent nearly in half. Draco let go of Harry’s hip with one hand and instead tangled it in dark locks, wrenching Harry’s head up for a kiss. The slight pain and the closeness sent Harry over the edge, and Draco eagerly ate the pleasure-filled screams spilling from his husband’s lips. The tightness around Draco’s cock became almost unbearable, and soon he followed Harry over the edge, filling his husband with his seed. He continued thrusting until his cock softened, then collapsed on top of Harry; he quickly rolled over onto his back before lethargy could sink in, pulling Harry with him so that the brunet’s head was on his chest.
“Just because it’s normal doesn’t mean it’s right,” Hadrian frowned, “Besides-Elena refused to agree to an arranged marriage when we were babies, so what changed?”
“Draco,” Harry said with a slow smile, “I think I can do that.” He tried to pull his hand away, but Draco wasn’t quite ready to release it yet.
“No problem, Pup,” Sirius said, “I’ll always be here when you need me.” He kissed his godson on the forehead, “Always.” Harry smiled up at him, then closed his eyes; he was asleep by the time Sirius closed the door.
"Yeah," Fred nodded, "Just got there last night after Dumbledore visited her parents; she'll be staying the summer."
I hope to hear from you soon, so I can reassure myself that you are well. Stay safe, and know that I am doing everything in my power to rescue you.
"I'm not a possession!" Hadrian argued hotly, trying to free his wrists from Draco's grip, "Just because I'm your Mate or whatever that doesn't mean I belong to-mmph!" Hadrian's protest was cut off when Draco leaned forward and pressed their lips together harshly, his tongue invading Hadrian's mouth forcefully; Hadrian fought against it at first, still irritated at Draco's possessive statements, but then the blond softened the kiss, nipping lightly at Hadrian's bottom lip and Hadrian felt himself melting. Hadrian stopped fighting to get away and tilted his head a little, giving himself up to the sensation of Draco's soft lips moving against his own.
When the hot water hit his skin Hadrian let out an involuntary moan at the way it felt; his relative's hadn't abused him much over the summer until the night Dumbledore arrived due to their fear of the Order members, but they made his life miserable in other ways-limiting the number of showers he could take being one of them. If he remembered correctly, it had been about four days since his last shower, so this was a luxurious feeling for him. He took his time washing his hair and scrubbing himself clean as he thought about what he found out.
"No Mother," Draco shook his head, "Severus really only mentioned it yesterday, and I was not entirely certain if it would apply, so I did not bring it up. Plus, we have been rather busy, what with saving Hadrian's life, discovering the truth about the past and fighting off Weasel's."
"Someone sure is bossy this morning," Draco mock-glared at him, "Don't I even get a kiss good morning?"
“My attention?” Draco asked, and Harry nodded once more. He licked his lips and started to speak, but Draco was faster; he leaned down- the blond was a couple of inches taller than Harry- and captured Harry’s lips in a passionate kiss. One of Draco’s arms wound around Harry’s waist, pulling him closer, while the other hand tangled in his hair, making the tiny bells jingle. Harry found himself mirroring Draco, with one arm around the other man’s waist, and he cupped the back of Draco’s neck with his free hand.
"Careful Hades!" Draco cautioned, quickly moving to take hold of Hadrian's arm; "Are you okay? What happened?"
"I am Augusta Longbottom, and this is my son Frank, his wife Alice, and this little boy, this is my grandson Neville," Augusta smiled down at the boy before pinning Tom with a steely gaze, "We normally don't associate much with families who are known for their affinity with the Dark Arts, but Lily and James have convinced me to hear you out."
"-the Dark Lord is actually your father," Theo continued, "not to mention crazy Bella is the Mudblood Granger's mom, only Granger isn't a Mudblood, and the blood-traitor Weaslette is actually the Potter heir? Next you'll tell me the Dark Lord is all for the mingling of wizards and Muggles."
“You’ve let the Nargles get in your head again, Harry. We will let you out after you give Draco a chance to explain. If you get hungry, I put a box of pastries in your pocket.”
"Well then, we shall definitely have to go before school resumes," Narcissa said, "We should visit Italy as well, and perhaps take a trip to Germany."
“Dudley!” He called, opening Dudley’s bedroom door, “The freak came back; since he cost you some of your allowance by escaping on your watch, I thought I’d let you take care of his punishment. Just don’t kill him, and make sure the neighbors don’t hear him scream. When you’re done, throw him in his cupboard; he won’t eat again until you allow it.”
"See? That wasn't too terrible now, was it?" Draco teased. Hadrian shook his head to clear it before answering; seeing Draco's expression he decided to wipe that self-satisfied smirk off the blonde's face.
Draco wasn’t even aware of falling asleep, but the next thing he knew, he was being woken up by Teddy, who was getting ready to leave with his grandmother. Draco vaguely remembered telling Teddy goodbye before falling back asleep. It was almost noon the next time Draco woke, and he felt well-rested enough to get up.
“You don’t want this,” she said, “And not only because you’re interested in men.” She contemplated him in silence for a minute, then her eyes widened slightly, before narrowing. “Who is he?”
Harry took a last look around his room, then Apparated to the shop, landing in his, thankfully empty, office.
“I loved it,” I agree, “I hadn’t realized how stressed out I was until just now. It was exciting not being able to see you and anticipate your actions; did you see us in the mirror? Or rather, me in the mirror?”
“Yes, Mother,” Draco agreed, following his mother back to the kitchen where Dobby was waiting. He wasn’t going to give up on finding Hadrian-he would never give up on his mate-but he still felt like he didn’t deserve Hadrian. After the way he had treated the boy over the years, then he was powerless to stop the Weasel from hurting him, and now he let Hadrian be kidnapped; how could he possibly deserve to have Hadrian as his mate?
“Oh, wait!” Draco called, just as he was stepping into the hallway, “I don’t remember-did Mother kiss you today?”
“Then you’re an idiot,” Harry snapped, and he was pleased to see Dumbledore’s eyes narrow slightly in anger, “Yes, I was brought there to do a ritual, but it was one I had to be willing to participate in; all the books just call it ‘The Ritual’, and it was created by Merlin and Morgana to unite the Wizarding World against a common enemy.”
Hadrian glared at Draco for a moment, and silently acknowledged that Draco’s silver shirt and dark blue robes would clash with his own outfit, before sighing and snatching the clothes from his clothing-obsessed Veela. He quickly changed shirts, and then pulled the robe on over it all before crossing his arms and pinning Draco with a hard stare.
"There you are, boys," Lucius greeted them, "We have some important information to discuss with you. Do you recall in the memories when Dumbledore forced Tom to create Horcruxes?" Harry and Draco both nodded. "Well, there was a final Horcrux created that no one that night-aside from possibly Dumbledore-was aware of."
Harry’s thoughts followed a similar pattern until he saw the chalice begin to glow, and he felt magic heal the cut on his wrist. Harry kept his gaze on the chalice, and reached out to pick it up the second the glow began to fade; as the submissive for the purposes of The Ritual, Harry was required to complete each action first, as a way to demonstrate his willingness. He tipped the cup and was surprised to find that the liquid inside was warm and sweet, without even a hint of blood in the flavor. He closed his eyes and drank until he felt full to brimming with golden light, and then passed the chalice to Draco. As he did so, Harry caught sight of his own hand and realized that he was actually glowing with golden light; when Draco drank his portion of the mixture, he began to glow with a silver light. When the blond set the chalice down, Harry saw that his eyes were also glowing silver, and he had the brief thought that their glows were probably bright enough to light up the whole clearing.
"Yes," Hadrian rolled his eyes, "I sent her a telepathic message while we were taking a nap.” Draco scowled, and Hadrian laughed before adding, “Luna…she just knows things sometimes-I can't explain it, but she has never been wrong that I know of, and I trust her.” A pause. “So, about them coming over…?" Draco gave him a hard look before responding.
“Okay,” Harry agreed, walking over to the wardrobe Dobby had sent his clothes to earlier; he pulled out a pair of pajamas and said; “I’m going to change in the bathroom.”
“Is that so?” Draco challenged, grey eyes alight with mischief, “Why don’t we make it an official bet, then? One week from today, December 23rd, we will compare the amount of sales we have made, and the loser has to do whatever the winner wants for one day.”
"Potter?" he heard Malfoy's voice as if from far away and attempted to answer, but at that moment it began to feel like all the wounds on his back were ripping open and he let out a loud, pain-filled scream as he felt his ribs crack, before his world was swallowed by darkness.
Draco’s thoughts were interrupted by another blood-curdling scream and he ran back to the bed to see his nemesis writhing in pain as the wounds on his back re-appeared, ripping open and pouring blood. "Bloody fucking hell!" Draco cursed, drawing his wand, "Now what do I-?" He began muttering spells under his breath to try and stop the bleeding, but the wounds just seemed to get worse, and this time he heard as Potter’s ribs broke. Draco finally resorted to using a stasis spell, which would keep Potter alive and stop him from losing any more blood until it was cancelled-by which time Draco planned to have help.
Cleaning up the mess in the kitchen took Harry the better part of an hour, and by the end his hands were covered with cuts and scrapes from the broken vial. Once the floor was spotless Harry considered locking himself in his room until the potion wore off-Dumbledore said to administer it twice a day, so that meant it should wear off after twelve hours-but he knew that Vernon would have no problems breaking down the door. He needed access to his magic so he could escape, but he knew it would be a long time before that happened. Scowling, Harry walked to his uncle's study and knocked on the door. When Vernon called for him to enter he did so hesitantly, and it was with even more trepidation that he closed the door behind him. Vernon pointed to a cup of tea in front of him.
The book listed, Mathias' Book 5, was in Severus' collection, however it was in a language he had never before read; the remainder of the book on Horcruxes was written in the same language, and so Severus was somewhat stuck as to what he should do next. Perhaps he would show the books to Tom; if Tom did not recognize the language, it would be time to pay a visit to the library, or maybe one of the shops down Knocturn Alley. Amadeo and Serilia were Severus’ ancestors on his mother’s side of the family, and they would no doubt have kept records as well, but Severus had never come across them. Of course, his mother had forfeited her inheritance by marrying a Muggle, Tobias Snape, so it was likely that the information was at the Prince ancestral home or a vault in Gringott’s. Severus had never had reason to claim his maternal inheritance before, but perhaps it was time to do so…
"Well, I'm sorry you feel that way my boy," Dumbledore said sadly, "but if you will not work with me then you are my enemy,” Dumbledore’s voice trailed off as he began talking to himself, as if he had forgotten that Tom was still in the room, “I just have to find a way to bring out the darkness which surely lurks within you, and make certain the other teachers see the evil in your soul, but how?" Tom had gotten out of his chair and was slowly making his way to the door, only to freeze when Dumbledore’s twinkling blues eyes focused on him again.
Several minutes later, Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Moody, Madame Maxime, Karkaroff, and the ministry officials arrived. Harry listened with half an ear as they argued, and was relieved when the adults agreed that he couldn’t have entered his name into the tournament. The relief was short-lived, however, when it was decided that he would have to participate any way. As Harry made his way back to the dungeons, Professor Snape walking silently by his side, the only thing he could think was “I’m dead.”
Hours later, after they had christened the dining room table and the window seat in the lounge, Harry lay in bed beside his husband, smiling as he watched Draco’s chest rise and fall in sleep. After several minutes of just admiring his husband, Harry maneuvered so that he was lying with his head on Draco’s chest. Even in sleep, one of Draco’s arms wrapped around Harry’s waist, holding him tightly, and Harry sighed in contentment. Everything he had gone through, all the times he had been forced to go up against Voldemort, it was all worth it because it had brought him to where he was today. As he drifted off to sleep, Harry thought that there was nowhere else he would rather be than this place, in this moment.
Draco had always been handsome, with his platinum blond hair and stormy grey eyes, but now he was...well, beautiful, but not in a girlie way. Draco's blond hair was now past his shoulders and it was even paler than before, almost silvery and his eyes...his eyes were a hypnotic silvery-blue; the blond was taller now too, approximately six inches taller than Hadrian where previously Draco had only been about three inches taller. In addition to the physical changes, Draco also had a powerful aura-Hadrian felt that he could almost see the blond's magic swirling around him.
Spent, Draco let Harry’s legs slip off his shoulder, and then collapsed beside his boyfriend on the bed. Draco rested his head on Harry’s chest, absently tracing the ribbons there as he waited for his breathing to even out.
"I'm not sure," Draco replied thoughtfully, "I haven't hated him for a while now; I just realized I had feelings for him yesterday, but I've always been...drawn to Hadrian." He eyed the redhead warily, "Is this where you give me the 'hurt him and I'll torture you into madness' talk?"
"You go with him, Cissa," Lucius have his wife a kiss on the cheek and rested a comforting hand on Draco's shoulder, "I am going to find Tom and make sure he doesn't do anything reckless."
“We have explained to Hadrian and Draco how dangerous this is,” Narcissa replied with a frown, “They don’t like it, but they do understand why we don’t want them involved.” Augusta gave Narcissa a look that said she doubted the younger woman’s sanity, but chose not to say anything else on the matter.
“That doesn’t matter,” Ginny insisted, “Right now is what matters, and right now Mum wants your ferrety friend to come over Christmas Eve. You’ll ask him.” Ginny fingered her wand in a threatening manner, and Harry sighed.
Glancing up, Harry saw that Draco had also finished undressing, and his grey eyes were eagerly taking in Harry’s naked form. Harry ignored his renewed blush and returned the favor, allowing his eyes to rove Draco’s body, taking in the pale skin and Quidditch-toned muscles. Draco was slightly broader, Harry noticed, and then his gaze travelled down until they landed on Draco’s cock, semi-erect and nestled amongst pale curls. Harry suddenly remembered where that cock would soon be going, and he gulped at the idea of that thickness entering his body.
“From Dumbledore?” Lucius interrupted, “You mean the way you protected your wife and children from the manipulative old bastard? Dumbledore has gotten the best of us all, and we are still trying to pick up the pieces; do you really expect a sixteen-year-old to fare better against him?”
"It is considered a joke," Draco scowled, then brightened as a thought occurred to him, "Why? Did you want me to be flirting with you? Because I have better pick-up lines. For example: Baby, you've got me wrapped around your finger tighter than Devil's Snare. Or: I don't need to look into the Mirror of Erised to know that you're the only thing I desire. How about: Is that a wand in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me? And then there's the classic: Want a ride on my broomstick?"
"It's generally expected for boys to like girls, so it's understandable that you didn't notice before, " Neville replied, "It’s like I said before though-same sex relationships are accepted in our world, and there are ways that you can still have a family.” They were silent for a moment as Neville let Hadrian think it over before suggesting, “Do you want to go check on Draco and Luna? We can find out if the-er, nargles have left."
“You say that like you expect an argument from me,” Hadrian laughed, taking Draco’s hand and walking towards the door, “I already told you, the only reason I didn’t tell Pansy about being mates is because I wasn’t sure if you wanted me to. Oh, I guess I should call Tillie to take down the ward. Tillie!”
“They can’t force her to get married sooner?” Hadrian questioned sitting up to look over at the blond who met his gaze steadily, “In the Muggle world you can be married before you turn of age if your parents agree to it; I’ve heard of girls as young as thirteen being forced into an unwanted marriage.”
“Dobby is waiting for Harry Potter to be ready,” Dobby replied excitedly, “Dobby is knowing where to go. He is making it safe. No one is finding Harry Potter and his dragon until they is ready.” Harry had to bite back a laugh when Dobby called Draco his dragon, not wanting to hurt the House Elf’s feelings.
Dumbledore had no warning before Tom, Lucius, Frank and Bellatrix jumped up and began shooting hexes at the people surrounding Dumbledore; during the distraction Narcissa grabbed Draco, Alice grabbed Neville, and Elena grabbed her two children; the jarring motions had awoken the children, and they were all crying. The women made a run for it, Narcissa in the lead, but they had forgotten about Pettigrew; he sent a stunner which hit Narcissa in the back, and she fell to the ground, losing her grip on Draco.
“I can’t believe no one told you,” Draco said, “Well, when you are in heat, the purpose is for us to procreate. Conception is more likely if my sperm is able to stay inside you for longer, and so, during your heat, whenever I come inside you I grow a knot at the base of my cock to keep up tied together. The knot can last anywhere from a half hour to an hour, and we won’t be able to separate until then.” A pause. “You aren’t uncomfortable, are you?”
“Draco darling, I have returned,” Draco looked up from his book with a smile as his mother entered the library, her hair covered with a light dusting of snow. “Are you warm enough, my dragon?”
"He’s still a little insane," Draco choose that moment to speak, and Hadrian noticed that he was glaring at Luna for some reason, "However, now that he's aware of what happened he is trying to fight it. He still intends to project our works from Muggles, but his methods have changed.”
