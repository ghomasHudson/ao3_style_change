At ten feet away from the cottage, she was thrown back suddenly. The ghostly outlines of ward runes floated in the air for a moment.
Oh, so there was another person involved here. The name sounded familiar, right on the tip of her tongue, but then it escaped again.

“It’s not!” she said, and stamped her foot. Whether it was a stupid English thing or a Weasley family thing made no difference. It wasn’t real.
“Coffee at dinner, Potter,” she said with a finger waggle and set off towards her office, spinning garlands of bats and cobwebs along the hallway as she went. “Don’t forget your costume!”
“They put the first chapter at the end of her last one,” Malfoy said. “You probably didn’t even notice it.”
Draco pressed his lips together. “It’s hardly my fault if you turn out to be competent occasionally.”
“I just don’t know why they chose to do it this year,” Harry said, then swigged some eggnog. Vile stuff. Cloying.
Blaise slowly opened his eyes back to reality.

Astoria dropped to her knees.
Harry stepped forwards and touched Draco’s cheek. Draco turned and rested his head in Harry’s palm, his face finally peaceful.
“You don’t think I should preface it somehow?”
He squeezed Draco’s shoulder. “I’ll take you to a cool place next week, ok?”

Potter, 1. Malfoy, 0.
“Oh, Merlin,” Malfoy groaned and covered his face. He kept talking, but it was so muffled that Harry had no idea what he was on about. He managed to pick out, “absolute prat,” “Jesus H. Christ,” and “wiggly,” none of which sounded terribly flattering.
She wasn’t quite sure about the correspondence or the symbolism of a pony.
“Oh, is that one of your plants?”
“Not like this.”
Draco was looking towards the window. “I came across it as part of my research into immigration into wizarding Britain before the nineteenth century.”
“Lucky to have Auntie Cho,” Marcus said.
Elspeth Montague’s hand shot into the air. “Sir, we’ve already done
Harry groaned and flopped face down onto one of the Conciliatio couches.
Audrey nodded. “Poor boy. He ate so much ice cream in the next week that the elves begged me to cheer him up. They were so tired of making butterscotch and hundreds and thousands and sour worms and marshmallow creme.” She shook her head, dislodging a piece of lavender. “He’s always had an abominable sweet tooth. The elves don’t like to deny anyone anything, but it was too much for even them.”
“I never really understood why my brothers and sister were so obsessed with other people, when there are dragons in the world.” He paused here and stared at Norberta, the current matriarch of one of the subpacks. “School proms were … fun, I guess, because dancing is fun, but putting your tongue in someone else’s mouth seemed kinda weird. But when I had to Polyjuice into someone else during the war—” Weasley won’t reveal whom—“I realized that other people had all these sexual urges and desires like thrumming through their bodies. Which was like, cool to experience for a couple of hours but,” he laughed, and concluded, “How could you ever get anything done?”
“Well,” Pomona said, “Would anyone like to take a look at the carnivorous serpentine maximiliorian?”

She would like a nice pair of eyebrows.
. It was going to become his mantra, he could already tell.
Malfoy had dropped one of his packages, so Harry levitated it back into his arms.
Draco took a breath, sighed, and said, “Yes, fine, I’ll have the imps work up some magical photostats.”
“Good to see you, Draco,” Sirius said. He tilted the whiskey, swirling the melting ice with the amber liquid.
“It’s probably rubbish,” he said and reached for the manuscript.
“You look gorgeous,” he said.

Completely unbothered, Harry walked into a wall.
“Of course not! I just fail to see why a local robbery means that you’ve assumed it’s going to end up at Hogwarts. They’ve probably already taken it down to Borgin and Burke’s or it’s on its way to Shanghai or Moscow.” Draco shrugged. “I don’t see why it’s our problem.”
Harry wrinkled their nose.

She shook her head solemnly. “You never know. That’s what Dad says.”
he read in spindly green ink.
“This year?”
Pansy didn’t understand the details of the latest magicotechnical discoveries, but what Draco was saying was true. Or at least as true as the reports she’d read in the
“You don’t not look like a vampire, with the—”
“Love,” Talbott said, one hand consolingly rubbing her arm. “We can’t be prepared for every contingency of Alina’s magical outbursts.”
She paused here and steepled her fingers together. Harry busied himself with pouring some more tea. She declined with a gentle shake of the head. He dropped a sugar cube in and reached for the creamer.
“Hey, uh, Andy, maybe you want to, er, put that out?” Sirius was edging towards his wand on the table.
“Oh, no, not like that, fuck, sorry, should have—”
Pansy dropped back into the chair.
This was the moment of truth.
Draco shrugged. “I did write a novel in the first week, so that seems like a good start.”
k thx
Thank you for inviting me to your house. Your demonstration of the various corners of the internet was fascinating.
She elbowed him. He slowly got off the bed, which now he seemed loath to leave. She sank back into the pillows, hating how her energy faded almost instantly. Lavender smiled, but it was tight and worried.

The door buzzed. She dropped her phone again, rushed to the door, and opened it. “It’s a blood—” she managed, and then everything went black.
Draco started when he heard his name. He tore his gaze away from Eric, their goth bartender, who had finally managed to transfigure his shoulder blades into bat wings, which was, as Val had attempted to explain, very cool magic but maybe not the most practical while at work, but, let the kids express themselves. Eric had a genius palate—and never resorted to magical shortcuts, which, Val had realized through experience, made hangovers a thousand times worse. They could afford a few shattered bottles if it kept Eric happy.
“I’m not giving it you until you sit up,” he said with a cross look at Harry’s slouched form. “You’ll spill all over the couch and then it’ll be even worse than it is now.”
He hummed a bit and said, “Right, we’re going to have to be invited in. This is really advanced spellwork.”
Almost too honest.
“It’s not half-bad. Once you get past the general flavor profile of piss.”
“Oh, shit, right,” Harry said. He’d completely blanked about warming charms. He cast a quick one over the two of them.
“Oh my God.” Harry groaned. “Ok, no, I don’t play it for my students, and, even if I did, it’s not explicit content and most of these kids probably know what porn is anyway, like, I knew what porn was by the time I was fourteen and I lived in a cupboard and like, didn’t have a computer, so—”
He groaned and dropped into the armchair, lazily waving his wand and transforming a shoe into a chair for Ron.
“It would be a horrible abuse of power to enter a sexual relationship with Malfoy,” Neville said, snapping back into his confidence. “Unthinkable. I’d lose my position at the university and my ability to work for the community service component of the rehabilitation program.”
“Where next?” Draco said. “Can we go to that horrible sandwich shop again?”
He’d been wearing emerald robes, then.
He’d sketched something that looked like a succulent, but instead of fleshy, smooth lobes, these had strange ridges and loops that looked a bit like chain mail.

“I had an itch,” he said.
Why had Draco completely lied about everything? But he’d called him Harry. He’d said Harry. Not Potter. Harry.
At the top of the verge, Draco looked back.
Harry wanted Draco so badly. It was like a huge, flaming hippogriff of desire that threatened to overwhelm him, and he didn’t know if Draco wanted him back. It was like some switch had flipped and all the things he’d been noticing and not noticing about Draco suddenly signified that he, Harry James Potter, was irredeemably attracted to Draco Malfoy.

“Aye,” Hagrid said with a smile. “Damn fine man. Knows right from wrong. And that’s not always the rules. Or the law. You know that.” He loped off after Audrey and said something that made her shake with laughter.
And once when Harry had been staring a hole into the side of Draco’s head at dinner, Draco turned, smiled, panicked, frowned, and then rushed out of the Great Hall.
“Why? Are you jealous, Potter?” Draco smirked and examined his hands.
“Decent eating, though.”
Astoria giggled, but Susan could tell there was a damp patch forming on her flannel.
“You’re working for Nev?” she asked as she shut the final tome.
“We’ll have to go there, I guess,” Harry said. “Maybe we ought to go now.”
Did Draco want something like that too?

Draco shrugged. “Probably not, but who’s to say. I doubt the head auror would be unable to detect a disillusionment charm.”
“Ta,” Harry managed.
Lavender nodded. “Harry’s way too generous as is.”
Maybe.

Malfoy glanced back quickly and muttered something under his breath.
Malfoy dropped his hands and stared at Harry. Harry felt a bit skewered.
And then Harry overslept and woke to a firm knock on his door.
Neville scratched his beard and nodded slowly a few times.
Alina was mouthing ‘piss off’ with a look of unadulterated glee on her face.

fucking Britney and Justin. That O.W.L. class was going to be the death of him.
Her phone rang. She grabbed it from the table, then dropped it. “Bertram?”
There was no labored breathing behind him. Just a moment of silence before Malfoy passed him. Malfoy paused at the top of the staircase, his hair perfectly in place. The torchlight was probably disguising the patchiness of his closely-cropped beard.
“Harry, he did not succeed in killing Albus,” she said and drank her tea. This statement did not seem to reach him at all. Minerva watched him pace back and forth, grabbing handfuls of hair and yanking on them. It did not make a noticeable difference to his hairstyle.

Perry shook his head emphatically, fringe flying out. He was attempting a Bieber, but he had such curly, pale hair that he looked a bit more like a cherub.

Nothing was working out as Lucius had assured her it would.
Draco and Harry collapsed into opposite ends of the sofa.
no employment suggested at present, as community service takes precedent; client has no need of MoM financial support, even given restitutions of Malfoy family inheritance, enough remains for the client to be unemployed for the rest of his life, which was something I said neither the Sociatrix nor the rest of the MoM would look favorably upon because he would need to make an effort to reintegrate into wizarding society. Client continued to look out the window.
“What are you wearing,” he whispered.
“Why not?”
Had he used salt instead of sugar? Had the cream gone off? Maybe the almond note was heresy?!
She was radiant.
No one else had said anything or moved.
Draco pulled the periwinkle robe closer around him and followed her down the stairs.
The sofa dipped down again, and Harry looked over to find Draco sitting there, just a hair closer than Dean had been.
Dear Mr. S. A. U. Lupin,
Harry blinked a bit of glitter out of his eye and slouched off to find a glass of punch. His mouth had been dry since the Malfoy incident. God, why was he so weird around Malfoy lately? He was always putting his foot in his mouth or being accusatory or just … plain strange.
Best,
“I don’t understand why you care so much.”
But Azkaban had changed far kinder people.
“Ok, well, not that one, then,” Neville said. “Then there’s some stuff related to the studies I started in my diss.”
There was a strange noise from the now rather pinkish Malfoy, who seemed to have his gaze fixed firmly on Harry’s feet.
“It’s faster for two if you’re physically connected,” Malfoy said with a little huff. “It’s basic transportation magic, Potter.”
Harry whirled around. Damn it, Padma. He felt the color rise in his cheeks.
She narrowed her eyes at him, pushing out against the edges of her consciousness, but all she sensed was nervousness. No flickers of hate or disgust. Just … nerves. And confusion.

And everything went all black and spotty.
“Hector Yu,” he said. His teeth were so white. “It’s great to finally meet you, Lavender. I’ve heard a lot about you.”
Harry took a deep breath. “I don’t know if the two of you know who you’re dealing with. This is Malfoy. Malfoy!”

“Also, the door never opened, and you can’t Apparate in here, so …”
Astoria Elodie Greengrass had not grown up in a council house.

“So,” Ron said with a smirk, “Hagrid wrote me. About the … demonstration. Of the dance.”
“We’ll need a silver bowl, some oil—”
He cleaned up the parlor, scrubbed everything down on his hands and knees, washing his granddad’s blood down the drain. That was the closest he got to a funeral. They never found his whole body. Just fragments the Ministry wouldn’t let them have.

Jason smirked and suppressed what was clearly the urge to roll his eyes, then said, “I’m sure you remember the ever-detailed-oriented Draco.” He sank into the empty chair next to Ron and stared at him. “This cake is amazing.”
“Yeah, but you’re out there fighting against blood supremacy and racism and homophobia and I’m like, scared to tell my parents I like girls and I teach at my old college.”
╭━ ⋅𖥔⋅ ━━✶━━ ⋅𖥔⋅ ━╮
Taking a shot in the dark (well, more of a viciously educated guess) Harry said tightly:  “You were a Death Eater, too.”
Andre handed him a small green glass jar marked with spindly handwriting. “My grandmother makes it,” he said. “She knew your grandda and I think she ripped off Sleekeazy a bit. Well, more like tweaked it a bit for more textured hair.” He shrugged. “She’s completely unrepentant and she doesn’t make money off it, so, please, even though you’re the heir, don’t sue us.”
Though, this was really him giving Draco The Talk. Kind of, anyway.
“Glad I could be of assistance,” Draco almost purred, his eyes demurely downcast. “Even if you did have to tie me up rather than just ask politely.”
Harry rolled his eyes and kept marking. You’d think seventh years would know your and you’re, but apparently not. He circled another grammatical error and put the end of his red pen back in his mouth.
“It’s expensive,” she said.
Andy looked at the ceiling and scratched her neck.
Draco turned it over in his hands. “Harry didn’t say anything about that.”
Right, focus.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “I have to write seven feet of parchment by tomorrow.”
“Oh, no, I can’t stay,” the older woman who must be Andromeda said, with a quick wave at Blaise, who was kind of stuck behind Neville in the doorway. “Assumed you’d want as much of a lie-in as you could get.”

, and he unfolded the crane.
He wasn’t distracted by cursed abs.
“My,” Draco whispered. “This really is quite impressive.”
“Just thinking out loud,” she said and helped herself to some mashed potatoes.
Then Addie slid into the seat beside her and Padma lost interest in Harry.
“Do you think they’re like, bringing it here?”
There was someone humming at the foot of the bed.
Just a tiny flash of gold near Malfoy’s abs.
and received a terse reply from Ron (
“Really, I shouldn’t have—” Draco said with a weak attempt to snatch it back.
Bit dramatic, Harry thought with a grimace.
He wasn’t sure that he’d get a DJ at the Winter Ball after this, but, c’est la vie. Malfoy started it. And then he was dismissive about Harry’s dancing ability. Which he had, fuck you Malfoy, finely honed in Muggle clubs over the last five years. When Malfoy was off with the Japanese monks or whatever.
He shrugged, as though it made his admission less meaningful.
“Yeah, I can’t imagine wearing a paper bag around Malfoy. He’d absolutely take the piss.”
“He’s changed,” she said.
“Don’t insult my husband,” Sirius snapped.
There was a crack and Otto Pembroke stumbled against the kitchen table. He was the only fucking one who didn’t apparate outside the cottage and knock like a normal person because, what, he wanted to catch Andromeda and Draco summoning demons or feasting on non-magical babies.
Draco cleared his throat and shifted towards her. He pressed his shoulder against hers, then his leg, and each place he touched her, the warmth radiated back.
“Uh, ok.”
“I’m meant to go see Ron and Hermione this month, anyway, so we could just, like, combine those trips, I mean, if you wouldn’t mind staying on their couch or something—”
─────── ⎎ ───────
“Luckily I only have one deluded Weasley on my hands.”
Ron was rubbing his forehead. “Just, please, mate, leave it.”
Padma rolled her eyes at him. “That’s literally exactly what I was saying. The person you’re into at fourteen isn’t destined to be your soulmate.”
It was time to put his foot down.
A smile flickered at the corner of Draco’s mouth, then vanished.
And then Draco was back, hands behind his back.
“Addie’s so into you.”
Ah, they were playing that game today. It was getting close to the full moon.
And he hadn’t even realized how much he’d wanted to kiss Draco, and now it was all he could think about. And it was doing his head right in.
“Ah, Mr. Potter,” he said with a little sigh. “If only that were true.”

“When I think of all the times you’ve ruined me on this table,” Sirius said, sliding his hands down Remus’ neck. Harry groaned and covered their eyes.
“Don’t you have to, you know, write one of your fancy papers or a book or something?”
“How are you doing?” he said, in an attempt to refocus the conversation.
“What a moment. Mind if I take a mental snapshot?”
“Piss off,” Harry said, and then said all in one breath, “Don’t tell your mum I said that.”
“Here, you can have these. They’re like a quid.”
“Jolly good,” Neville said and buttered a piece of toast.
Someone who’d want to have kids with him one day.
Someone who’d be a good father or mother or parent.
Draco fell asleep, curled up next to her, as they listened to music.
He snapped back.
Malfoy was preoccupied with shaking the ash from his shoes.
A few sparks sizzled onto the table.
Pansy agreed.
Then it was Halloween. Since Harry’s schooldays, the Halloween feast had taken on a more mischievous quality as students attempted to prank their professors and the ghosts (a futile enterprise, since they were incorporeal and generally ignored the students) and neck in about every dark alcove. Nearly-Headless Nick floated into through Harry’s desk during his second-year class on the varieties of Muggle currency and invited Harry to his Death Day party in a drone that was barely audible over the chaos his sudden appearance caused.
“Well, that’s much tidier,” she said.
Lavender whipped her wand out and tidied her up, then whispered, “Don’t worry, no one noticed.”
This was a non sequitur, so Remus persisted. “Percy?”
they do. Chuck a Galleon in that
“Dr. and Mr. Lupin, I think, or is it Mr. and Dr. Lupin?”
As he stepped out of his clothes, laying them across his chair, Harry paused and looked out the window. Snow was falling softly across the grounds.
She crossed her arms and squinted at him. He didn’t look ill. His hair looked atrocious, of course, and it seemed like he’d put on weight, but Lucius had become stockier in his mid-twenties so it was probably genetic.
“Shush, Potter, I’ll levitate you back to the tower. You’re not getting up until you’ve had tea and some toast.”
Harry felt a bit faint. “Nope, got it in one.”

“Oh my god, is it that obvious?”
“Not like this.”
“I doubt even Potter or Granger could fault you on that one.”
And if that wasn’t just fucking poetic, Florian thought, and rolled off the couch onto the floor. “Gotta head back to the shop.”
“It wasn’t a lap dance!” Harry wailed. God, how were they all so chummy and against him? His oldest friends! Betrayal! Woe! He collapsed onto the table, hiding his blush in the crook of his arm. “It was a practical demonstration, since someone,” he raised his head to shoot a meaningful glance at Malfoy, “was trying to sink my wizarding DJ idea. They can’t have some old lame-o. They need pop music! Rap! Dance! House! At least something from this century!”
“You and me both,” Remus said. “I was looking forward to a good ramble after Christmas dinner.”
to call her Artie. August also brought the Quidditch World Cup, where Oliver kept a clean sheet for Scotland, who still went out in the semifinals. Even Artie couldn’t cheer up Uncle Ollie.
“We’ve misunderstood something,” Astoria heard as she blinked her eyes open.
“Let’s do some less dangerous experiential learning first?” Marcus grinned.

“Counting the days since you saw me last, Malfoy?” Harry took the stairs two at a time. He vaguely wondered what Malfoy had been doing for those eight years. He hadn’t shown up for eighth year. None of the Slytherins had. Hermione felt particularly put out by that—“it’s not a very good reintegration into society, if they don’t feel safe enough to return to Hogwarts”—but Harry couldn’t find himself to care. Much. He kept imagining he saw Malfoy turning around corners. But here he was, in the flesh, no longer an apparition.
“You can’t solve the whole world’s problems.”
He felt like he was going to pass out.
“I, uh, learned how to bake,” she forced herself to explain. “My, uh, charity work. With the elves. Laundry and cooking and cleaning. No magic. It was hell at first.”
The older professor held up a hand. “Please, Harry. I know you have it in you to forgive him. He deserves a second chance.”
“Oh, very single,” Potter says with a cheerful smile. “I’m really good at third-wheeling.” Magical readers take note: this is a reference to a bicycle, a non-magical two-wheeled human-powered vehicle—a third wheel isn’t necessary! Don’t worry, Harry, we think you’re totally necessary!
Harry muttered, “Thank you,” a bit sarcastically.
Malfoy seemed to think that if he ignored the dancing and the following awkward conversation, he and Harry could settle into a friendship. And it was a friendship. For them, at least. They weren’t any less snarky, but Harry had managed to hex him only once, when Malfoy insisted that French strawberries were, always had been, and always would be superior. Malfoy looked disappointed as bogies shot out of his nose (“What are you, twelve?” he’d said after a singular
“I read a theory that Voldemort probably would have lived longer if he hadn’t tried to, you know. Live forever.”

“Yeah, whatever, Malfoy, it’s the player, not the equipment.”
Harry gulped the water, stared at the card again, turned from the bar, then swiveled back, grabbed the coconut, shoved it in their pocket, grinned at Val, and disappeared into the crowd.
“Draco,” she said.
But then the rest of the group began nodding and shrugging and breaking into separate conversations, Ron leaned towards Harry and whispered, “So, are the two of you together?”
Ron shook his head and licked the chocolate drips from his fingers. People from big families ate so quickly.
“Is it the counterspell from Evilian in the Black library?”
“Such an important question,” Hermione said with a broad smile. Shuo’s shoulders relaxed. “It was hard to convince Ronald of the relative merits of muggle condoms, but he wasn’t ready to be a father at seventeen, and once I told him it was condoms or abstinence, he got on board pretty quickly. Luckily, nowadays, condoms are relatively well-known and understood in the wizarding world. I think it’s maybe a bit more complicated for me as we’re approaching the decision of when we want to have kids. In the muggle world, it’s pretty physically damaging to the mother’s body, but as you know, in the wizarding world, while anyone can carry a child, it has typically been a female role. And then, add on decades of patriarchal oppression in both worlds, and it’s a risky prospect for a woman’s health and career. In a heterosexual relationship, the woman is expected to stay at home with the kids.”
─────── ⎎ ───────
This party was a total wash. Daphne hadn’t invited anyone from Gringotts, Astoria had just stuck to the gays, so it was like Hogwarts 2.0 except for Percy’s boyfriend who obviously didn’t want to suck her face because he was busy debating VAT with the American. Henry. Horace?
“Essays due on Hamlet’s characterization next class. Two feet.” Grumbling ensued, but they all filed out and left Harry in silence. Twirling his quill, he hunched over his desk and began to plan.
“Yes, well, anyway, Hermione learned a lot from Binns and I doubt Malfoy will be able to teach one-fifth as well as he could.”
After the Hat declared Zinnias, Zebbediah to be a Slytherin, the Great Hall resounded with applause. Minerva took her place in front of the high table. Malfoy slipped into the empty seat at the far end. Harry still couldn’t really see him clearly, but his black robes dragged across the floor. This was a school, not a fashion show. His white-blond hair was no longer slicked back but cropped closely and marginally less shellacked than his teen years, and the shadowy glow of a beard softened his pointed chin.
Very friendly, really. A friendly match between school chums.
“That’s—”
Remus turned to the other three. “Which of you was responsible for this?”
He was hiding in a closet with Draco Malfoy, who was pressed against him. Harry was getting a crick in his neck, but he couldn’t tell how much time had passed in the darkness. His left leg started to prickle when Draco elbowed him again and began to ease open the closet door.

“Not like this,” he mumbled, and then realized Perry was still there. “Uh, is there something else you needed, Perry?”
“Don’t you have work?” That sounded a bit pointed, fuck. Ron knew he had a crush on Harry, and he’d even tried wingmanning Florian once, but actually, Ron was less useful than a plate of worms, and somehow that evening at the Broomsticks, he’d ended up staying way too late watching Hannah Abbott flirt with Harry. But he didn’t think Harry hadn’t gone home with her. Harry didn’t go home with anyone. Or they hadn’t gone home with anyone since Ginny.
Meeting with Draco Malfoy a year after his release from Azkaban. Auror Otto Pembroke (DMLE case manager) and Andromeda Tonks also present.
“Nothing,” Malfoy said airily and while staring at the ceiling. “I was just exiting my room when Potter crashed into me. It’s nothing. A coincidence. Sheer chance. Combined with Potter’s inability to look where he’s going. Blind as a bat that one, completely and utterly—” he broke off and looked a bit abashed.
Draco was giving him a strangely intense glare.
“Uh, no. Neville’s doing some kind of charity work where Draco’s like a horrible field assistant.”
Draco sat back up and fluffed his hair with his eyes firmly fixed on the mantel.
“It’s not real, is it?” he asked, his voice growing husky.
Astoria materialized in front of them, hovering several boxes alongside her. “Sparklers,” she said with a smile. “To light on the terrace as midnight strikes.”
“Neville, d’you reckon?” Ron said, around a mouthful of scone.
“Well,” he said after an agonizing minute of silence, “I did not know that being not-heterosexual was an option until a few months ago.”
Lawyers working on it, etc., but I thought, the smartest witch of her age probably has some amazing ideas that the crusty old robes haven’t thought of (or might never think of, Merlin, the hourly billing I’ve been getting).
Just as he turned his face toward Neville’s, there was a knock on the door.
Harry groaned and leaned back. He wondered if he could discreetly unbutton his pants.
“Do you think we should put some kind of cushioning charm down?” Harry said after Teddy had a close escape with a late Ming vase.
“Uh, yeah,” Harry said. “Ok, so it’s a riddle kind of, from this guy in the court of the Delhi sultanate. Amir Khusrow?”
“I don’t think I could dance to Muggle music,” Malfoy said with his eyebrows raised. “There’s so much jumping.” He shuddered dramatically.
He fell silent as he watched Filius try to break it down to ‘Pon de Replay.’ Audrey was bouncing along and clapping, her bottle green hat askew. His eyes flicked to a nearby table, where Claude Oliver-Winger was banging his head directly onto the wood. Wait, Claude? He wasn’t a fourth-year. Whatever, his mum could deal with that.
He wouldn’t—no, that wasn’t what he meant—imagine Malfoy at some kind of—
Hermione was out there with facts and statistics regarding the high efficacy rate of the pill when used correctly, how condoms prevented STIs and pregnancy if used correctly, how anyone with a vagina should always pee after sex to decrease the likelihood of getting a UTI (Harry wasn’t sure how that was related to birth control, but it seemed like useful information), how they could acquire Plan B at local muggle pharmacies, and then Luna opened her mouth and dreamily said, “Never do it on the full moon. That’s when the nargles are at the peak of their power, ready to implant a baby into a willing parent.”
Lavender stuck hers out back.
“It was a private conversation between friends,” Draco said. “I fail to see why I should tell you anything.”
“Wait, babe, it’s your birthday?” Val tapped the button. It had once said BIRTHDAY BOY. The boy was scratched out with a sharpie and there was a series of question marks and then the word FUCK.
The dungeons were fairly quiet, just a few giggling couples shooed off towards their dorms by a fatigued Padma, who, thirty minutes into patrol, was rummaging through her classroom drawers for a sobering potion. Harry drank half and felt his senses sharpening.
“Are you all right, Potter? You look a bit … unwell.”

Malfoy reached into his robes and withdrew a monogrammed handkerchief. Dabbing his eyes, he said, fighting to talk through his laughter, “I didn’t realize you thought about my ass so much during Quidditch.”
Harry exhaled.
“In an invisibility cloak,” Audrey said. Her blue eyes were icier than he’d ever seen them.
She practically collapsed into the empty seat in the Great Hall. Jesus, was she going to have to become one of those teachers who wore clogs?
The next three weeks were absolute torture. Draco seemed to be actively avoiding him and would duck out of rooms whenever Harry entered them. It was like the beginning of the year. Harry felt like his skin was crawling off with the amount of longing that he was doing. Padma teased him endlessly. Even Addie had joined in, ribbing him that he was only avoiding Draco because he wasn’t sure if he could keep his hands off him.
Harry didn’t know anything about medieval popes or whatever journal Malfoy had just name-dropped. Muggle Studies was a fairly modern discipline and not even his—wait—
“Professor Malfoy didn’t explain like, why Hamlet feels so bad about killing Polonius. Shuo asked him twice and he like, didn’t respond. He went all pale and then got really red and started talking about how Puck is a queer-coded character.”
A smile flickered across Draco’s face. “They haven’t assigned parchment since like, the nineties.”
She considered her hobnob. Draco took a lemon biscuit from the plate.
Malfoy shrugged and looked entirely unrepentant. “It’s so easy to wind you up. But I never really know what direction you’re going to shoot off in. Keeps me guessing.”
God, he looked like a shark when he attempted a full-mouthed grin.
Draco took a deep breath. “Your family has always been well-regarded and rather rich, and then they became famous after Fleamont's successes, so there’s usually a file on them in archives.”
“Probably too much salmon,” Harry said at last.
“You know. It’s just, yeah, music.”
“I mean, my wand’s in my back pocket,” she said, spinning around.
Sirius wasn’t even pretending to work and had his ear pressed against the door.
But like, they were just friends.
Completed
“I don’t think that means—” Harry broke off because he wasn’t really sure what it meant. Just better to not say anything, maybe.
(of course, this is if all proceeds as planned and the client faces no recidivism):
She got up and went to the bookshelf. “I think I have a copy somewhere.” She grabbed a thick grey paperback and threw it at him. Harry caught it and turned it over. The cover was pale grey without a picture, just the title:
Malfoy took a step backwards and tripped a bit on his robe.
Harry leaned back in his chair and groaned.
“Does it do something?”
Malfoy pinked a bit. “Well, yes, I didn’t mean to say it wasn’t, or like, to slut-shame anyone.” He folded the napkin and set it on the arm of his chair. “I’m just … not good at it.” The last four words were almost a whisper.
Malfoy cleared his throat. He seemed to be looking away? Harry could guess that it was his profile. His expression was a blur. His entire body was a blur. God, he was going to have to put his glasses back on.
The Dutch baby swayed as Sirius levitated it towards the table. Remus made a noise in the back of his throat, then summoned a trivet and slid it under the cast iron skillet.
Blaise was laconic and said only the following: “I am a polyamorous, nonbinary mage who works for the Unspeakables. You may not ask me questions about my profession.”
loooool i was RIGHT THO
“Uh, yeah, he’s mentioned someone with that name a couple of times.”
Looking up, Harry and Draco saw Audrey and Talbott Oliver-Winger, seated next to each other on the sofa, wands out. The golden lamplight did nothing to soften their expressions.
“Andromeda!”
“I, er... Neville suggested that it might be a good... you know... I didn’t finish my NEWTs and I’m a felon... so, well, anyway, you don’t need a degree... It’s just a set of tests.”
Ah, shit, Harry’d put his foot in it again.
2:01 pm, March 4, 2007
Luna Lovegood,
Harry crossed his arms. Malfoy’s eyes tracked every move. The jumper was wool and rather scratchy on his bare chest. “We could fly together sometime. I bet I’m still better than you.”
“Right, so we’ll pair off and patrol the halls—” there was a general shuffling and Harry, who had drifted away for a moment, found that he and Draco were the only ones still seated. Wait, did that mean he and Malfoy were going to be partners? He refused to meet Harry’s eyes and toyed with the handle of his coffee cup.
“Having fun?” he yelled back, mostly to Elspeth.
“Christmas bonus, honestly. The union ensures that they’re paid fairly, but it’s nice to have a bit more for the holidays.” He continued eating his sandwich. “One would think you’d never had help.”
“’Arry, where are you?” Hagrid leaned towards him and smiled. “You’re a bit odd this evening.”
“Right.” Harry had lost his train of thought. He reached for a sandwich. “Right, yeah, we’ve got to talk. My room, after dinner.”
“I know,” his wife groaned, dropping the pieces into a silver casket on the mantle. “I just hope she starts growing out of it soon.” The lid snapped shut with a booming sound out of place for such a small object.
“Where’s our child?”
With his eyes shut, Draco looked younger and more vulnerable, like one of those paintings of dead saints. He was almost peaceful. If only until his mouth opened again.
In Person
“Oh, how deeply offensive,” Draco said with a little sigh. “Have you been de-fanged recently? You used to be a much more worthy opponent, though you were never particularly talented at verbal sparring.”
“Yeah, I’m sure those pureblooded witches really dig this whole—” Harry managed to make a kind of frantic hand gesture—“whatever it is.” Malfoy’s ring wasn’t on the right finger for a wedding ring, it looked more like a signet, but surely, he had to be engaged to some fellow blood purist.
This seemed like it was too much, and Harry noticed the mask dropping back into place. The small, vulnerable Draco was replaced by the swaggeringly slick Malfoy.
“Nev said he got Hermione levels of bonkers about the whole parchment issue one time.”
Harry’s head began to pound. Clenching his fists under the table, he sputtered, “Malfoy? Here? Teaching?” He tried to practice his deep breathing techniques, but he felt the anger rising.
I believe that legally, the contract could be voidable as both parties were underage (Draco Malfoy being age seven and my client age six) and therefore did not have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, but this would only account for the legal part of the contract, not the magico-physical effects and properties.
“It’s PUN,” Harry said, filching the pen from Remus and scrawling it into four down.
“Hm,” she said, then pointed at a bread roll, which sprouted a lionlike head, limbs, and a tail, clambered over to Posie and bared its teeth in a roar. She squealed and tried to grab it.
“And then for Christmas dinner, we were going to have Andromeda and Draco over, because he’s allowed to come to Grimmauld. Kreacher, of course. I think Ot—er, Nils, right—mentioned that he’s working on an extension of Narcissa’s probationary perimeter, but,” Sirius shrugged, "it wouldn’t be a great tragedy if it were just the five of us. Or six, if you wanted to come.”
─────── ⎎ ───────
Sirius scratched the back of his neck.
“Fair,” Pansy said, and bit into a cheddar scone.
There were several loud bangs, one remarkably sharp and short incantation, and then acrid blue smoke seeped into the living room.
“EIGHT!”
“Champers,” Lavender thought.
mione says its not much u
Literally, Blaise could see his molars.
Harry shook his head and continued to stare ahead, his eyes a bit glazed.
Harry shrugged and reached for another prawn. “Britney and Justin wanted me to, and we watched the music video in class. I had to get it on a DVD, believe it or not. God, I wish I could get the internet to work here, that would be so much easier, like, the things I had to do to that DVD player to get it to work ...”
“Oh,” said Perry slowly. “I see.”
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Hermione let that trail off, and there was a snicker near the door, which then opened and slammed shut and the particles in the room settled back down, and Hermione sighed, stretched her neck, and clicked her purple pen.
The mouths were now falling open.
Malfoy laughed once. “Ah, yes. Yeah. Yep. No, it doesn’t matter.”
“Mère,” Draco yelled out the window, “there’s a ward.”
“Do you need me to get Hermione or Ron?”
“It was completely mortifying when the students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang discovered we only learned English at Hogwarts! Mortifying! Luckily I spoke French so I was able to make friends with a few of the Beauxbatons boys—”
“He alright, mate?” the cabbie had said as Harry had paid, glancing at Draco, who was swinging the bag again while waiting on the curb.
“He’s your responsibility now,” Kreacher supplied.
“Where is Draco,” she repeated, flattening the questioning tone out of her voice.
She’d have to collect more data.
And Malfoy was in Ron and Hermione’s house, waiting outside the hall bathroom, to see if Harry was having massive diarrhea or something. But instead Harry was just crying.
She came back to the conversation gradually to find them discussing Quidditch, so she zoned out again and returned to her own thoughts.
“Oh, fuck off,” Harry said, waving his wand to close the door. “How long were you listening?”
“You gonna be ok?” Neville’s voice was soft and full of concern. Blaise smiled and nodded. It was all fine, fine, fine.
Harry was trying to keep up and said, “Uh, what was that?”
Narcissa sighed. “As much as I’ve loved this chat, the Ministry’s trace should be plottable by about now, so maybe you could take me to my son before they take me to Azkaban.”
Susan was getting sidetracked again.
Filius clapped his hands and cups of steaming coffee appeared. Malfoy fell upon his and downed it in two gulps. Harry could barely stomach the thought of a hot drink. His face was going to slide right off.
“Potter, do you think the Slug Club is a name that would succeed in the real world? No, but at least it has panache. It’s the assonance.”
He’d meet him in the open. With his feet on the ground and his head held high.
Re: Re: Re: ur alcohol
“Must be a Weasley,” Harry snarked, “you sound just like Malfoy.”
“You and I have … very different hair.” Andre gestured to his tight curls. “I mean, Bastian or Draco probably have hair more like yours.”
OK SORRY
Harry shook his head. “Had to spend that inheritance somehow?”
His twenty-sixth birthday had brought a box of fancy chocolates and a gilt-edged card signed with the initial N delivered to Sirius’s Floo.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Wish some people would stop asking,” she said under her breath. Ron mouthed “mum” and refilled her glass.
“Unconvincing, given the introduction to his book.” Talbott flicked his wand, and then Draco had shot out a jet of light, and Audrey was firing back, and all Harry could think to do was to shout “Expelliarmus!”
He was pulling his right sleeve down as though Harry’s fingers had burned him.
“We’re a power couple. At least.”
“And I was going to say he had to stop being such a fucking idiot, but like, he’s such a dick,” Dean said fondly as he watched his boyfriend. “He’s going to be so sick later.”
“I don’t know your life.”
“Which you and your fuckwit husband came up with,” Sirius interjected.
“Uh, the cupboard, mostly. When I was little, anyway.”
They gathered around the tree and Teddy gave them each one present from under the tree. They all ripped theirs open at the same time, cuing a deafening chorus of thanks and admiring exclamations.
Harry closed his eyes. This was going to be a fucking disaster.
Even wrapping his fingers around Malfoy’s wrist—the right one, with the tattoos that Harry hadn’t seen—he was burning. With curiosity. To see Malfoy’s mystery ink. Not to feel Malfoy’s smooth skin and gentle cashmere under his palm.

He brought the kettle to the table.
These conditions listed by OP to the client, who appeared uninterested. His only comment was “Wolfboy?” after the name Remus Lupin was stated. I stated that this slur was not acceptable, at which the client muttered something that sounded like “Squib,” but I was unable to hear it, then shrugged and began staring out the window.
it began.
k sry
The meeting began and Harry felt everything glaze over.
“Ah, no. They’re having tonight at home which,” Harry raised an eyebrow, “I’m pretty sure has something to do with some of the more exotic presents Remus chose.”
“I, uh,” they said.
Love and kisses from Ron and Hermione
“Your parents are on their way from Hong Kong,” Bertram said. Astoria swallowed. “They, er, are taking this more seriously now.”
“Wait, that’s Percy?” The ginger-haired man in the photograph, arm slung loosely around Oliver’s shoulders, was wearing rimless glasses and a tank. When Harry squinted, he could see how reedy, nerdy Percy had grown up to be a fucking hunk, but still? Percy was hot now?!
seems to be key to untangling it, in that the two hearts must be separated
Draco made a few wand movements and the exterior wards became visible, shimmering gently in the dark night.
fascinating!
: Re: Re: Re: Re: ur alcohol
Neville,
“I—uh, sir—we are extremely—” Harry began when Audrey bustled back into the room, levitating several pieces of the pendant in front of her.
Watching Draco was more of a delight than Val had expected. Everything, absolutely everything, that had long ago faded to typical was, filtered through Draco’s face, new and shiny. The drag show had his eyes as wide as saucers. He’d approached Noë Stalgia after the performance and clearly offered some kind of compliment, only to be kissed on the cheek, which turned so pink that you couldn’t even see Noë’s lipstick. Val hid a giggle by swooping below the bar. He was fascinated by the glittering drinks, the swirly straws, the floating fireballs. Val’s favorite was when he’d see someone whose gender performance was clearly not in his wheelhouse—and his mouth would fall open in awe, until he’d realize it was open and snap it shut and whip his head around to make sure no one had noticed. It was kind of sweet, Val thought. Not what they’d expect from a baby Malfoy. He was more like a fawn than a snake.
“That fucker.”
He was being odd, she thought, and turned her attention back to the bowl of banana chips on the table between them. He’d offered to help her in the garden, which she really didn’t want to work on, and thank goodness Ginny had suggested working up a little rain cloud to coincide with his arrival.
“Spotty, weedy, ginger terror? Must be me,” Fred said, sidling up and wrapping his arms around her.
One last look at himself in the mirror. He hoped this wasn’t too much.
“Right, fuck you, Malfoy, I have marking to do,” Harry said, flushed and irritated, standing and grabbing another half-sandwich for the road.
Harry would grind his teeth. How could Malfoy turn everything into some annoying contest?
Harry fought down the heat that threatened to blossom in his stomach.
“I’m ready whenever you are,” Harry said. He’d already changed out of his academic robes and was just in a peacoat, boots, jeans, and a hoodie. It was fucking freezing in Scotland in March. The beanie was necessary for keeping his eyebrow piercing warm against the cutting wind.
He scribbled a note.
A flush spread across Draco’s face. “They made a baby, er, together?”
“You’re very …” Malfoy trailed off. Was he shaking? His shoulder was trembling slightly under Harry’s hand. “Handsome,” he said almost silently.
─────── ⎎ ───────
“What?” Neville managed.
“Who, Malfoy?”
There was a strangled noise from Malfoy’s chair.
“I’ll make us some tea,” she said, herding them towards the door. “And then we can discuss what you’re going to do with the greenhouses.”
All the usual suspects were here: Harry, managing to welcome everyone and make sure that the snacks were refilled; Luna, nodding along as Ginny showed her various wedding dresses in some magazine; Dean sprawled on top of Seamus, who was taking up an entire couch even though he was about five four; Florian trying to look casual and failing while eating a biscuit; Addie, Pelin, and Sequoia were chatting in a corner.
It was signed with a single x and the initials D.M.
Harry was trapped.
“Good job, Ronnie,” Mum said and kissed his head. “I’m so proud.”
￫ date night, once a week ￫ a priority
“And do you know why I love you?”
Pansy broke in with a stern, “And if they tell you they’re not wearing a condom, go home. Don’t fuck them.”
1 more email tho
uGHGHHHHGH
u got weird mate
“You know,” Lavender said as she raised her eyebrows and took a sip of the wine. “Oh, that’s bad.”
Blaise blinked a few more times. “I’m pretty?”
“It’s not that complicated, Potter. I’m definitely, definitely not homophobic because I’m …” he trailed off and held out one hand in Harry’s direction.
Draco snapped his mouth shut.
Her brown eyes widened and then she shook her head. “I have to find Hector.”
“Oh, no, it’s fine,” Blaise said in a bright voice. The goddamn steel ribbing he’d woven around his heart had failed once again. He stared down at his tea. Things had been so good? And now they were fucked? And it was definitely, kind of one hundred percent his fault because he was probably overreacting again, but maybe he wasn’t because it was Draco, so like, how could anyone compete with that kind of cut glass beauty?
“Alright,” Malfoy said and slung the broom over his shoulder. “See you on the pitch at six-thirty.” He was out of the room in a shot.
Everything felt hot and slow.
“Following in the pointed shoes of my predecessor Albus Dumbledore, I shall save the speechmaking for after dinner. For now, enjoy.” She clapped her hands and the tables sagged with roasts, potatoes, sprouts, jugs of pumpkin juice, rolls, and a plethora of steaming dishes.
Of course he was an American.
“They haven’t pulled the cracker yet.” Kreacher folded one of his responses and dropped it in the crystal punch bowl. Sirius raised his eyebrows and nodded at Andy and Remus, as though this indicated that his, or Kreacher’s, behavior was somehow reasonable.
“No tv shows from the 1970s!” Harry insisted.
Harry couldn’t take his eyes off Percy. Molly hovered about him, fondling the arm of his sweater, kissing him on the cheek, turning his engagement ring hand round and round in the light and sending sparkling light across the kitchen ceiling—and she wouldn’t let go of Oliver. She had one hand constantly cupping his cheek or fetching him another little something, making sure he knew how welcome he was. Harry saw Percy and Oliver exchange a loving look over her head and Harry’s throat tightened.
Ron laughed. “If it’s Malfoy, he’ll want to outdo you in the coolness factor, so he’ll bring, let me see … Blaise and … what’s the girl? Parkinson?”
Then it was on the table again.
“Uh,” Harry said. “It’s sort of shoved down the back of my robes and half down my trousers.”
Client nodded after each of the steps stated in section V, but did not make any expression of emotion or further statement. He nodded goodbye when he and OP prepared to Disapparate to the Tonks residence.
“Hnnrgh,” Harry said, and sped off towards the whips. Why didn’t they have a gum section or something? He was getting really hot. But he didn’t want to take his coat off, like Draco had. That would be admitting that they’d be here for a while. He closed his eyes for a moment, but the thumping bass of Eve’s ‘Let Me Blow Ya Mind’ wasn’t very calming.
“I’m not stupid, Potter. I’m an historian of early modern and modern European magical and Muggle history. I published an article on Galileo’s trial last year in
“You already have the authoritative lecture voice down, though,” Ron said.
“So, what were you thinking about?” Angelina bumped her hip into Fleur’s with a grin.
Draco just sighed and said, “I’m not too sure.”
“Just you,” Blaise said, ruffling Neville’s hair on the way to the sink. “Just you.”
“Of course,” Harry said, moving around the table to hug Sirius. They came and hung their head over Remus’ shoulder, a comforting weight. Remus breathed in the smell of Harry’s hair. The child they’d never had, the child they’d always wanted and, in some sense, always had. He and Sirius were the only ones left, and they’d be there for Harry until the end.
“Good to know you have a couple of sexy werewolf doctor husbands as backup.”
Hermione nodded. She really didn’t want to get into the prison reform debate which like, they were on the same side of, but she was more interested in Harry’s feelings than policy right now. She rubbed her temples and wished Ron was there. Ron always knew what to ask to get right to the crux of the issue. But Harry was here, not at their house or Wheeze’s, which she didn’t know if that meant something, but like, they were here. So she had to deal with it.
“I’ve won, Malfoy, you git. I’m holding the snitch.”
“It requires certain potions, but yes, the two of them together made a baby,” Pomona said. “I, er, it hasn’t been germane to my life to ascertain the details of that process, but, yes. The short answer is yes.”
Harry felt as though he was losing his mind.

“Uh, are you coming?”
“Hm, not bad,” he said once the song was over. “What are they called?”
“Sirius?”
Oh, that. Ginny had owled them immediately—lied that she needed some tampons and run down to the public owlery and sent them a scrawled missive and then sprinted back to the meeting—and Hermione had been waiting for Harry to bring it up.
⋅ plan wedding (!!!!)
“Collegial?”
She took his hand—thin, pale, dry—and squeezed it between both of hers.
Andre quirked his head a bit.
“And that just leaves Rubeus and Pomona to the third-floor corridor and Harry and Padma get the dungeons.”
Harry made sure that Teddy was engrossed in dripping butterscotch over a crêpe filled with rainbow sprinkles and peppermint humbugs before flipping Malfoy two fingers. Elen cackled and caused Teddy to look up in confusion.
“Come to my room later and we can plan some activities.”
oiiiiiiiiiiii harry u there
“Uh, not exactly,” Ron said, “There’s uh, someone who like, fixes shit. That’s all I can say. But anyway, it got stolen. Which is bad. Because it’s pretty cursed.”
Classroom activities
“The lists!”
“Or you could come up for a brandy later?”
Draco was in the window, but he was shaking his head rapidly.
“Of course not. I’ll see you at eight this evening.” The flush was back.
￫ finalize BAME student mentorship program grant proposal, form committee of students, etc.
He didn’t even start to feel calm until after a frigid shower and two tumblers of whiskey.
First came the savory course, buckwheat crêpes laden with smoked salmon, chives, and Hollandaise, accompanied by fresh espresso for the elders and peppermint hot chocolate for the under-twelves. Then there was the sweet smorgasbord, in which they spread, slathered, drizzled, filled, and then gorged themselves on sweet crêpes filled with every imaginable topping, from marshmallow crème and Nutella to Valrhona chocolate sauce and salted caramel to fresh strawberries and kiwi. It was amazing.
Harry’s vision clouded. “You what?”
“And they’re choosing to spend it with us because?”
There was a short bark of laughter from behind Andromeda.
“He’s taking some class on non magical culture?”
10:43 am, Feb. 8, 2007
It was completely untenable to live like this, Harry thought as the Easter holidays drew to a close. He’d spent a week housesitting for Ron and Hermione, who’d fucked off to Ibiza (and not invited him, he thought crossly), and when he’d returned to Hogwarts, he’d been ordering all his food to his room, panicking about running into Draco in a studentless castle. Each time he saw him, he was filled with the most horribly animalistic desires—and Harry was terrified, terrified that he’d hurt Draco, that Draco didn’t want him, that Draco could somehow read his mind and see all the depraved things Harry wanted to do to him, with him.
─────── ⎎ ───────
Bill glanced up towards his wife and winked.
Cho cleared her throat. The noise died down. “Yes,” she said, and allowed herself a small smile at the rustle that swept through the classroom. “Today we’re going to practice one of the most useful charms.”
Clinging to his broom, half on and half off, he darted forwards with his hand out, but as his fingers closed around the snitch, Malfoy’s hand closed around his.
He was so handsome and snarky and charming in a kind of shy and yet irritating way, and he dressed well and had a lovely reading voice and was out there educating kids about history and how complicated it was and why being gay was more than ok and he had a great arse in Quidditch leathers, probably great at all times, let’s be fair, and how could no one have noticed all those things in any of the twenty-six years he’d been on this planet?
“Professor Sprout?”
“Well, for a start, you’re not a boy,” Lavender said.
Those idiotic blood purist laws also had less good consequences. Like the fact that Lucius’ imprisonment had annulled the bonds of his marriage. Which meant that Narcissa and all her offspring (and Remus silently thanked the Christian Jesus he didn’t believe in that there was only one) “reverted” to the “responsibility” of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black through some
Harry looked at the ceiling for a minute, then said, “Yeah, that might be nice.”
How could Draco Malfoy have never had a requited love?
Andy shrugged. “You do have to admit that it worked,” she said. “They’re probably making out in the library right now. Finally.”
— “And this is Draco.”
His eyes slid off her face. “Fine.”

“Oh,” Draco said, and flushed. He pulled his robe closer around himself. “And?”
draconis_xx@hotmail.co.uk
He opened his eyes and looked down at the pale fingers rubbing the flannel of his sleeve. Malfoy blushed and drew his hand back. They both looked away.
“Worse than bubotuber pus,” Andromeda said, pouring tea into a cheerful yellow mug and passing it to him. “And they’d always sprout smack between your eyebrows.”
Ron pressed his lips together and then said, “Yeah, technically, you’re not an Auror, or in the Ministry, so you’re a civilian.”
Draco and the second-year he was tutoring blinked at him.
He didn’t know what he was supposed to say, so he just waved (goofily, mind you) at Malfoy, who gave him a half-hearted two-fingered salute, and let himself out. Harry spent the rest of the evening in confused repose. He penned a note to Hermione and Ron asking if he could come around next weekend, sent it off with Ulula, spent some time trying to trim his hair with his wand but that was such a disaster (it looked like he’d been attacked with gardening shears) that he panicked and found himself outside Andre’s door, hoping the older wizard was in.
He was in a nice, but worn, black robe, which, with his hair tucked behind his ears, reminded her of when she’d first seen him in his Hogwarts robes at age eleven, prancing around the Manor lording it over her that she wouldn’t be going to school until next year. And fuck, that reminded her of the marriage contract, but now was really not the place or time, because Draco seemed a few roses short of a bouquet at the moment.
Hi Bertie,
“You know I’m going to start at Hogwarts next September,” Neville said, with great effort to keep his voice calm.
Or better yet, Professor Malfoy.
“We brought some wine,” Fleur said. “I think Molly took it somewhere. But water is fine.”
Draco blinked at him.
Minerva McGonagall led in the first years, who shuffled together in a wobbly line. They were so small. He was never that small. They huddled behind her as she smiled beatifically at the rest of the school and gestured towards the Sorting Hat, which began to sing.
For a long time, Vane didn’t even manufacture potions relating to lust, desire, or sexuality. “I didn’t want to make a product that could hurt anyone. My first potions were simple healing draughts. You can’t overdose on those, or use them in a harmful way.”
“Did you—”
“The BABY,” Harry shouted as Sirius leapt up, “is COOKED!”
Where was Hector?
looolllll
“Oh, I read a good poem the other day,” Harry interjected. Florian’s eyes snapped open.
But it wasn’t their world anymore, and Astoria had what they really craved: social capital. She was one of the few golden Slytherins, profiled in the
So Blaise decided to believe that and followed him to the front door. He swallowed. He balled his hands into fists in the long sleeves. He put his chin up.

Just in bouts of cramping, explosive diarrhea, or days of constipation.
“Wait, wait, wait, Harry,” Hermione said, “I want to chat to Jason!”
“For years, there’s been debate among the animal rights community whether it’s appropriate to ride dragons,” he says, throwing a chunk of meat in a corral. “But since dragons don’t speak human, and we haven’t unraveled the finer details of the korak-roar, eagle moan, or Farnese shriek, human scientists have few methods of delving into dragon psychology. Once you see things from their perspective, their behavior starts making more sense.”
at buzzy new eatery Larunda. Over chicken salad, Potter divulged their latest plans for the latest paradigm shift in the wizarding world.
He was, in fact, sorted. Shockingly. Five days later Malfoy would find out exactly how shockingly sorted and appropriately attired Harry James Potter could be.
Narcisssa swallowed the urge to ask about this Susan, because, irritating though it was that Astoria had turned out to be a lesbian insofar as she couldn’t marry Draco, she was a sweet girl.
His wooden chair let out a whoosh of pink smoke and transformed back into a shoe, dumping Harry on the ground. He collapsed backwards and lay for a long time staring at the dark, broad beams of the ceiling.
Pomona Sprout cracked her knuckles and surveyed the greenhouse. It had been a relentless summer, fighting the overgrown plants back into some kind of submission so Neville wouldn’t be eaten alive—at one point, she might have said not literally, but after Hardcastle’s accident in Greenhouse Six—she shrugged, even though she was only thinking to herself, and grinned.
Sirius raised an eyebrow at Remus. Fine, he owed him an ice cream, because Harry did bring up Christmas.
“I think,” Jason licked the jam off his fork, “I would like that very much.”
Astoria smirked. “We aim to please.”
He started swinging back and forth, then somehow lifted himself up onto his broom. Then he was throwing himself forwards, spinning around his broom (how was this even possible, fuck, his shirt had ridden up), and now he was doing fucking pull ups (he had arms, too? Large arms?), panting out, “Is that enough for you, Potter?” before hanging upside down with his shirt hanging in his face. Harry was clinging to his broom, trying to keep his breathing steady. Just a bit of collegial exercise. Nothing to get too excited about.
And a woman who’d spent twenty-odd years living in the country, so of course she knew that Malfoy’s woolen robes weren’t going to work for tramping around the wilds of Northumberland, but Neville guessed that there had been some, uh, disagreement.
“Prawns,” Harry said, distracted by Malfoy’s sudden appearance.
“Woo,” Harry said and rolled his eyes. “That really gets the people going.”
Harry wasn’t really sure where he was supposed to hold on—shoulders was going to bring the cloak up too high, and Draco’s elbows would pull it back from the front, so he just waited, hovering his hands about until Draco whispered, “Waist, you idiot,” and then Harry thought,

“Yeah, I wish,” Sirius said.
“Merlin,” Draco said, and stormed out.
Remus filled in the squares, then spared Sirius a glance. He actually hadn’t moved, which was a bit concerning, because usually SIrius would have wriggled his way into Remus’ lap by this point of a Sunday morning seduction, so Remus reached for his wand, ran a quick diagnostic, and then sighed.
“Uh, the New Pornographers?”
“Terrible posture, as always, Potter.”
“You’re so sweet.”

“Shit, don’t drink that swill!” Sirius yelled.
Hagrid guffawed, “I remember that! You thought asking Talbott out would break Barnaby’s heart!”
“Er, no,” Draco said, studying his pocket watch again, “Why is Remus coming to us for Christmas? Is he your friend?”
“Maybe something more—” Neville tilted his head and pondered Malfoy, “Breathable?”
♚ love, Sirius
By seven fifteen, Harry was a sweaty mess. Even though Harry had slipped into the seat next to him, Malfoy had ignored him throughout dinner—a prime window to attempt flirtation—in favor of a lengthy discussion with Bastian about the historical development of Ancient Runes. Harry had considered spilling something onto him in an effort to touch his legs, but decided he’d rather not get hexed in front of the entire school. He had to fend off a stream of criticism from Minerva regarding his lack of correct hat during formal dinners. Malfoy hadn’t been wearing a hat, why didn’t she get on his back about it too? Harry had buried his nose in his Yorkshire pudding and nodded a lot. He couldn’t shove Malfoy under the bus though, if he was continuing with this flirtation gimmick.
“And me,” Ron said. “When we were doing the dishes.”
Luna tilted her head.
Andromeda Tonks’ address: The Howes, Otterburn, Newcastle upon Tyne. Andromeda Tonks and the client will be the only persons in residence. Premises secured by Aurors throughout April with wards holding until 2026 or when deemed appropriate to be removed; impenetrable to magical means of transportation specifically carried out by the client independently; owls unable to reach the client at this address unless addressed care of Andromeda Tonks; accessible via Floo Network for those on an approved list (currently: OP, Andromeda Tonks, myself, Neville Longbottom, Remus Lupin; in an emergency, any auror or sociatrix may use Probationary Protocol 45a to gain immediate access to the residence).
At first, she thought she was losing her mind. St. Mungo’s sent her to Dr. Grimke. Dr. Grimke had stared into her left eye, pulled her right earlobe, tapped her kneecaps, flicking her wand over Cho’s head and casting a bright network of purple runes. Then she grinned, said “It’s all your mind, but in a real way,” and explained how there were veils between worlds and some people lingered and some people could feel those people, and apparently, Cho was just one of those latter people and Cedric was one of the former.
Addie leapt to her feet and attempted to transfigure the canaries into paper planes, but they seemed to retain a malicious capacity and drove the students from the hall. Padma couldn’t stop giggling and slapping her knee (which Harry had never, ever seen her do).
No, fuck it, he was proud.
But he wasn’t going to let go of the snitch.
♚ March 25, 2007
Luna squinted at him. “Is it Draco Malfoy?”
Interesting.
“And, furthermore, Potter, the name of the club is hideous—what does this WAF—” Malfoy made a strangled sound and gestured at the air—“stand for?”
“Cho,” Marcus said in a gentle voice clearly reserved for idiots. “You can’t give babies forks. They’re pointy. She could stab herself in the eye. Or stab me in the eye.”
That was enough, he decided, and shuffled past Malfoy, who was still sitting like a right lump on the bench and folding and unfolding his sunglasses.

Here is the electronic mail.
Lavender tilted her head at the shape of the tea leaves at the bottom of her cup.
Malfoy had one hand on the brass knob. A silver ring glinted in the light from the candles along the staircase. Harry felt he shouldn’t leave without giving Malfoy a warning. That he was watching him. That he’d know if he got up to something tonight, or any night.
They were just boys.
“The papacy is an outdated institution and has been since the seventh century.” Malfoy calmly broke a piece of bread and buttered half before popping it into his mouth.
“I’m fine,” she said with a jerk of her head. “How are you? What’s going on?”
Draco shrugged. “The Wingers are genetically incapable of following directions.”
Draco opened it, blinking slowly. He was wearing a green silk robe and his hair was sticking up on one side.
“Can I?” Harry said, tilting his head in preparation.
Draco’s jaw twitched.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and mumbled something that sounded like “ineffectual repression.”

Talbott shot Harry an amused look. “Darling, not everyone has the affinity you do for dark magic tempered by a stubborn unwillingness to give into it.”
“See you boys in the morning,” Minerva said, her eyes twinkling, even in the shadow of her wide-brimmed pointed hat. Harry narrowed his eyes at her.
In a gay club sense, anyway.
What the fuck was Malfoy playing at now?
“How’d you know about Seamus?” Harry said, a bit slurred.
Andromeda turned from the stove. “Really?”
Starr pressed their lips together. Draco looked pained.
She’d tried to break him of the habit of using her title, but it just rolled off his gigantic shoulders with a gentle shrug.

“Oh, you don’t have to come,” Neville said as he rose. “I have to go get some plants and I sent Andy a note to tell Draco that if he wanted to get some extra hours, he could.”
“Malfoy!” Harry shouted. “Concentrate! Tell me what Blaise told you!”
Malfoy’s abs were cursed. That was the only rational explanation. Some elder gay wizard had indoctrinated him into a dark magic that glued men’s eyes to his torso. That was it. Yep. A dreadful ab curse.
“I wouldn’t, uh, do anything,” Harry said at last. “That would be stupid. It would also undermine the work I’ve been doing on, you know, forgiveness and equality and all that shit.”
He looked down at his tea. “You accumulate hate.”

Then he was scrabbling with the paper to see if there was a note.

Neville nodded. “That was actually a fascinating part, because if you ingest the leaves at certain periods in its life cycle, it can modulate your voice tone, which could have relevant properties for trans people.”
Her husband glanced up.
Harry groaned. “I’m trying to find the hair stuff Andre gave me. It’s a fucking tiny jar, and Kreacher’s tucked it away somewhere and—wait, why are you flying?”
“How sharper than a serpent’s tooth is an ungrateful mother,” George said, “You loved the banana bread I made for Mother’s Day.”

He followed Draco back to the main area of the shop, where Starr was standing behind the counter with a huge smile on their face.
He’d almost slipped and said, ‘just ask him,’ but he saved himself. He shouldn’t assume. But it was Justin. It was totally Justin.

When he opened his eyes again, he realized he’d unwittingly cast a Patronus too.
Not that he’d really be dancing. He was going to be there for chaperoning purposes, Ebublio at the tip of his wand.
The roast was, of course, magnificent. Ron had spent the summer after eighth year at the Molly Weasley School of Cookery, and while he rarely had time during the week, his weekend dinners and brunches were the best British food Harry’d ever eaten, Hogwarts elves and Molly included. There were crispy potatoes (“Goose fat,” Ron insisted, serving Malfoy seconds), carrots and parsnips, buttery peas, fresh rolls, salty butter, good hearty ale (Harry had waited for Malfoy to wrinkle his nose and demand wine, but he complimented the beer twice. Twice.), and to round it off, treacle tart with fresh whipped cream.

Malfoy took a small bite. “Lovely thank you.” He chewed. “That’s child abuse.”
After a minute, Malfoy appeared out of the greyness. “Do you want to quit already?”
Starr’s voice entered his internal monologue, and he was brought back to his trying reality.

He’d gone to see Eileen?! So quickly? She usually had a waiting list for months!
“Yeah, doubt that,” Harry said with a wince. “Look, Malfoy, it’s a perfect set up for revenge—he gets this cursed necklace, pretends it’s stolen, somehow it ends up at Hogwarts, smuggled in by Audrey or something, and you get cursed.”
George grunted and put his arm protectively around Angelia. “I think he’s a right shit, that’s what he is. No book changes that.”
“I am not paranoid,” Harry hissed. “Cursed jewelry isn’t fucking good, Malfoy.”
Ah, best push a little harder. “Got any joggers or uh, trainers?”
Harry had a pang in his stomach. Too much black pudding at breakfast.
“Anyway,” Harry said, lowering his voice, “we’ve got an invitation now. We can just poke around a bit and see what’s up.”
“Eyyyyy,” Harry said and made a peace sign. “New year, new me.”
She had just taken another sip of the truly wretched cab when the door jingled open and in walked Neville, followed by Draco Fucking Malfoy.

“You fucking cheeky bastard. Of course.” He half-heartedly swiped at Harry.
“Yes, Potter, exactly. I came across one of the fifth-years demonstrating a rather—” he inhaled—“rude dance for a group of her peers and she said you’d demonstrated this dance in class!”

“I love you. You. Ok?”
Harry would crack before she did. They weren’t going on year three of teaching seminars of stuttering, tongue-tied undergraduates impressed by the youngest LIMS professor (and only Black woman, and, shit, she needed to add BAME undergraduate support/mentoring program to that list). She squinted back at Harry and sipped her tea.
“That’s allowed?”
“Alright, today we’re covering
Hi Jason,
Draco snorted at this reference to a plant that burst into seven-foot-tall electric blue flames when its berries were at peak ripeness, so Neville pushed his luck a little. “It’s the mouth. If you closed it when you stared at gay people, the whole staring thing might be less noticeable.”
“Just through there on the right.”
Malfoy didn’t seem to expect an answer but rose and nodded to Harry and shut the door gently after himself.
Then there was another one.

Four weeks later, she was still at Hogwarts. Filius hadn’t died, but he hadn’t gotten better. He was in a ward at Mungo’s that didn’t allow visitors. She sent him chocolates twice a week. That probably wasn’t healthy. But he hated flowers.
Half-seven, Harry bustled into the Floo and was spit out at Burrow. Unshrinking his presents, he wedged them under the bristling Christmas tree. And then he joined the Weasley fray in the kitchen, slapping Charlie on the back to congratulate him about the birth of a new dragon litter, accepting a glass of eggnog from Ginny, receiving a thorough pecking from Molly, a two-sided bear hug from Ron and George, and a gentle shoulder-clapping from Arthur. Luna tucked a piece of holly into his collar.
He buttered a piece of toast.
Draco had pulled out a small silver cigarette case and tapped it with his wand, which emitted a small purple cloud of smoke with floating green lettering.
“So, Potter,” Malfoy said, a bit twattishly, “let’s discuss this club of yours.”
“ONE!”
“What he’s not saying is that he’s quite good at potions,” Neville said. “Especially the ones that require botanical tinctures or essences.”
“You’ll always have me and Gin,” she said, leaning forward.
Parvati was studying her.
I think perhaps I did not explain the stakes of this contract clearly.
“Otto,” Hermione said. Narcissa’s heart stopped. It was a mistake, in the twilight, not every bearded man with a harsh gaze—but when he took her by the elbow, the flush that spread through her body proved it. “Can we just have another twenty-four hours so she can know what—er, happens with the contract?”
“I’d agree,” Harry heard a smooth voice say, and he realized that Draco had come up with a glassful of champagne.
The Oliver-Winger cottage was brimming with kids and family. The Hogwarts professors slid in and bunched around the snacks table. Audrey bustled in and flapped her hands at them to disperse.
“As if,” Harry said, and grabbed another ham-and-cheese sandwich. “You look weird.”
“Ready, Malfoy?”
Perry tilted his head to one side.
“Why not,” Ron echoed. “That’s fucked up, though.”
“You said it in a nasty way.”
“Oh,” Jason said, “yes, very yes.”
“I didn’t know you baked.”
Elspeth nodded thankfully while taking copious notes. Britney rolled her eyes and dragged her back to their seats.
“It doesn’t make sense to use parchment!” Hermione interjected. “It’s skin! It’s really expensive! Why is it in scrolls?! The codex has been the predominant method for information storage in western Europe since like, the 1200s.”
“It’s French,” Malfoy said, tossing his head. “He’s one of the deputy curators at the Louvre now, so it comes in handy when I’ve got to do research in Paris.”
“It would really be a low point in my life if I came to visit Astoria in the hospital at nine in the morning with my other good friend Harry and I was drunk. Just like, think about it, ok?”
“Wait, what?”
“Well, ta,” Harry said and wanted to kick himself in the face. Honestly, this “ta” business was getting out of control.
“It’s just,” Astoria mumbled between sobs, “I burn Susan wherever I touch her, and when you touch me, it’s like a golden glow. But I don’t want it.”
“It’s a sensor,” Harry said, and then realized he didn’t know how those sensors worked at all and he could just tell that Draco was going to open his mouth and ask, so he pointed at a huge blue dildo and said, “What about that one?”
Harry did crack first, though, and said, “Having a good 2007 so far?”
“Anyway, he recognized me and bought me a drink and he was so funny and weird—I think you’d like him—but anyway, we ended up, you know,” Neville lowered his voice, “hooking up. In my hotel room!”
Harry narrowed his eyes. “Fine. But if it ends up here, you’re buying me a massive cake. German chocolate. Just so you know.”
“It’s fine,” Malfoy interrupted. “I know I’m the one who—”
harry
“God, Ron, if you ever want to give it up and open a restaurant—or just be my personal chef—”
Or something like that.
Draco rolled his eyes and put one arm through Harry’s. “I can’t get lost this way,” he said with a little self-satisfied smile.
“That’s not a real holiday,” Fleur insisted.
Perry nodded a few times. “Thanks, sir.”
“You threw the competition,” Remus argued, “through your unlawful use of extraneous magic that was designed to push events in a certain direction, so I think you’ll find that actually, you owe me the ice cream and the five Galleons.”
They arrived at the Great Hall just as the doors were opening, so they got to shoo the suddenly-hesitant students inside. Cue gasps of delight as they saw huge gold chains spanning the ceiling.
He spent the next twenty minutes cramming more shrimp than was polite into his mouth.
Harry watched Draco’s fingers tighten around the microphone and exhaled.
“Oh, right,” Harry said, as though this were a new topic introduced by someone else. “He doesn’t really say anything.”
Luna had authored a young adult biography about Harry, the only publication he’d allowed in his postwar fame. She’d done the illustrations, too.

“Oh, fuck, my neck!” Sirius yelped as he rolled over in bed.

“It’s nine-fifteen in the morning.”
He seemed to have retreated to somewhere in his mind and curled up a bit more in his chair. “Thanks for the sandwich, Potter.”

“Open it!” Luna yelled back. “I’m busy.”
Harry shoved his chair away from the table and stood. “He tried to kill Dumbledore! He took the Mark! He hasn’t changed, and he’s probably still a snarky little arse who can’t wait to—” he was spluttering and his vision swam as he smacked a hand on the table—“inculcate the youth with his racist, sexist, homophobic, blood purist ideas, and I can’t believe—”

Harry held back a retort. He’d always had a good vibe in the classroom. Always.
“Oh, no, I don’t want to come in, thanks, though, Andromeda,” he said as she opened the door, her eyebrows drawn together. She shouted back up the stairs and tried to hustle Neville inside the cottage, but Neville resisted because he’d not be put on the backfoot, not in this first meeting with Malfoy.
“I think I want to kiss you,” Harry said. The words sounded very loud and his mouth was very dry.
“Tonks’ mum.”
As far as I remember the session, Draco didn’t actually say anything the entire time. Which was odd, because he’s usually … willing to share his views.
─────── ⎎ ───────
Andre moved with a fluid grace that even his limp didn’t undermine. Harry knew he’d been the Keeper at Puddlemere United and then Pride of Portree until the crash.
Harry tried to shove him off with his free hand, but then Malfoy was sitting on top of him, trapping his torso between (my God) extremely strong thighs.
“My father’s are red and my mum’s are blue. We’ve all got purple eyes,” she said, “Me and Claude and Viv and Benny.” She scowled. “Mum says it’s because we’ve got some of each of us in them.”
They shook their head, smiled, and readjusted their beret.
Harry felt a pang at that. It was love, always love, that had got him through.
He paid, tipping one hundred percent as compensation for the box of demonstration items, helped Draco into his coat, got them back to the Floo, all in a vague haze. He didn’t feel like he could draw a full breath until Draco had shut his door.
Fleur groaned. “I keep thinking it’ll wear off one day.”
o rly
Harry leapt up from the couch, snatching a box of sparklers, and bounded out the French windows.
Ednie, the elected representative of the Hogwarts Elf Union, raised a thin finger and said in a high voice. “Owain’s right. Cabbage Roll Thursday had to be scrapped!”
“What?” Harry shot back, “what are you on about?”
Malfoy’s eyes bulged. “You what?”
Padma elbowed him. “I saw that, you prat.” She glanced around to make sure no one was paying attention to them and whispered, “You’re lucky Minnie’s too involved with her roast beef to notice.”
“I was just trying to trim it a bit. And I got a bit carried away and confused.”
The thoughts were wriggling in his stomach. The Malfoy-related thoughts. Though there were no such thoughts. Those thoughts were completely out-of-bounds and therefore needed to be locked firmly away. In a box. Throw the key out the bloody window. Think about Hippogriffs. Or killing doxies.
Harry ate a few more prawns, but they weren’t as appealing as before.
“Uh,” Neville narrowed his eyes and scratched his forehead, “what?”
She nodded seriously.
“Er,” Draco said, glancing at the candles that separated them across the table. “We set that last one on fire, I don’t know if it’s—”
“It is indeed not,” Sirius said with a sigh. He let the front two legs of his chair thud to the earth, then rose and leaned on the counter next to Andy. “Draco is in a fucking mess.”
He paused and took a short breath. “I learned enough to destroy the Horcruxes.”
Boys with problems far too large for their ages.
“Oh, not Winger specifically,” Draco said, “But I’ve been cursed before. I have a few more counterhexes in my arsenal than I did last time. I’m not scared.”
Ron and Hermione’s cottage was a ways outside the nearest small town. The protective wards shifted as she drove up the lane, shimmering in the dusk. Malfoy cleared his throat. Harry was sure he’d been a bit shocked to feel his intentions towards the Granger-Weasley’s magically probed. Ron’s magic had always been a bit overprotective.
“It’s not a spiritual or moral thing. It’s proteins and shit. Some people have tiny bits of stuff that sticks out differently and then you have magic. That’s not a choice or a thing you can be proud about. We didn’t do anything to get it.”
“The Wingers are a member of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. I had to memorize that shit for my father,” Draco said with a grimace. “I know almost everything about Talbott. His mother fled from his father when I was little. I heard she died soon after. Killed by Death Eaters. Probably as revenge for taking Talbott. I think he went to a wizarding orphanage after that. His dad went to Azkaban.” Draco continued in a low voice, “I hardly think this is birthday party conversation.”

“Oh, fuck off, Potter, like you’re some kind of sex god?!”

“Why didn’t you tell me this before?” Harry hissed back, his sweaty hand sliding around on the stem of his wine glass.
“And you play this for your students?!”
Ridiculous Black theatricality, Andromeda thought, while considering throwing the entire box of chocolates right back into the fireplace to incinerate them. She wasn’t exempt.
“She looked like a milkmaid. And then there was the black lipstick phase. I mean, you’ve seen it. She’s still obsessed with strange colors of lipstick. Green, orange, mauve.” Andre’s voice was fond. “But honestly, I don’t think Talbott would have noticed if she wore a paper bag.”
The client appeared alert and watchful but remained silent throughout the meeting.
Pansy shrugged. “It’s just a truth. I’d be excommunicated as a baker if I didn’t think so.”
LOOOOLL
“Absolutely not.”
“Sorry, I didn’t think I’d wake you,” he said.
“Amusing yourself with the buffet?”
Narcissa Black Malfoy Black,
A golden warmth spread through her. Fucking blood magic. “Ok, don’t take this the wrong way, but I feel better when you’re closer,” she said.
A silvery Borzoi clipped into the room, a brown puppy dangling by the scruff of its neck. It plopped the whining puppy into a dog basket and curled up around the little one.
“But Claude’s at Hogwarts,” Draco said.
“Right, Malfoy,” he barked. “Come here.”

He was at the Ottery St. Catchpole fête for fucks’ sake. This was no place to be mentally undressing a stranger. Well, somewhat stranger. Vague acquaintance?
“Anyway, you might be right,” Draco interrupted. He started ticking numbers off on his right hand as he continued, “One, what are Audrey and Talbott Oliver-Winger, respectively Defense against the Dark Arts professor and Head Auror doing with a cursed sex pendant at their home? Two, who knew about this? Three, who was talented enough to break into what is, I assume, a very warded house? Four, why were Ron and Blaise called up here to deal with what should be a routine B&E, if not for the nature of the object in question?” He paused for a moment and then said, “Something’s not quite adding up here. Perhaps you’re onto something, Potter.”
“Multimillionaires hardly count as kept men,” Remus countered. “Rock stars certainly don’t. If anything, I’m the kept one.”
Malfoy nodded seriously.
But they were colleagues. Friends.
Harry turned away for a moment, and then whirled round and cast a sticking spell that glued Malfoy to the chair.
They stood staring at each other for a minute.

“One of us.”
“Oh, DRACO!” Andromeda yelled after him as he thudded up the stairs. His footsteps stopped.
There was a silence. Harry fought the urge to laugh again and leaned against his desk, wiping his hands on his pants. Malfoy didn’t know. What a self-involved ass, honestly. As if they didn’t have wizarding papers in—wherever he had been.
He realized he’d zoned out because Neville looked concerned.

“So, this is lovely, but why are you still worried?”
“Remus’s presents are more of the knitted variety, lovely and lumpy and very warm.”
Harry coughed on his next sip and dribbled some butterbeer down his front.

Andy skimmed the letter and yelped. “Draco!”

She and Bill had left for Norway the moment the dust from the war settled. He’d been working on his dissertation on the theory that the fjords were created by prehistoric giant rune-writing when Voldemort had seized power, and they had field work to do. Then Fleur had started her work in Paris and now they were in Cairo, Bill was on sabbatical, and she got to spend most days measuring amulets for the morphological project, and she’d just heard there might be this—
“If you’d told fifteen year-old me that my true love was one of the Weasley twins, I’d have slapped you.” Angelina shook her head, then her gaze softened as Fred entered the room. “They were terrors. Spotty, weedy, ginger terrors.”
“He does seem to be reformed,” Hermione interjected. “He came around to ours last weekend? Two weekends ago? Anyway, he’s perfectly lovely, and he apologized to me—”
Harry wrinkled his nose. “Weird.”
“I know,” Draco said, resting his head on top of hers. “It’s fucked.”
“If I were truly reformed, I wouldn’t hold that against him,” Draco mused.
Astoria opened one eye, then the other.
“Right,” Harry said, pulling out his agenda. “There’s a meeting every Tuesday after dinner if you’re interested. Usually my classroom, sometimes the Room of Requirement. It just depends on what the agenda is. Wait, let me check, oh, yes, it’s in the Room of Requirement next week.”
Narcissa,
“I guess we should follow?” Parvati didn’t get up.
Hello dearly beloveds,
It was still weird.
“Ok, well, you know how Diwali is usually in late October or early December? When wizarding families emigrated from India to Britain, they wove the magic that built up during Diwali into the pagan rituals of Halloween. Weeks of celebration strengthened the diasporic magical communities that were reeling from violent upheaval and the racial tensions they faced in Britain. One of the big nineteenth-century British traditions was scrying for your future spouse in cauldrons of water or with apples, which was madly popular among the desi crowd. So, like, between finding out the identity of your true love and the fact that candlelight is universally flattering, it’s a pretty romantic holiday.”
The next day brought the students back. Harry spent the day nursing a hangover and hiding in his classroom “organizing” for the start of term.
“I thought he’d forget,” Harry said. “I won it at the fête but somehow I took home his Smirnoff from the tombola so I emailed him about it because I didn’t want him to think I was the kind of asshole who’d like, steal someone’s more expensive prize, but he said he’d be happy with the coconut but I thought like, no, I liked that coconut and it’s not fair because vodka is way more expensive that a coconut, so it’s not really fair?”
This was going to become tiresome. She’d read the books about PTSD and prisons and all those things but being looked at constantly was already wearing her down and she’d be damned if she let her nephew get under her skin, so, girding her mind in the Black armor she’d abandoned years before, she said in a controlled voice, “Didn’t your mother ever tell you not to lurk in doorways?”
Malfoy’s face purpled. “I am not wearing Mudblood clothes,” he hissed.
Luna had done the colorful murals: clouds and sunsets and rainbows and branches of magical plants, reaching and floating across the walls. Couches and chairs huddled together in little seating areas. Then there were the tables, stacked high with papers and files, and down the hall, the rooms that would one day be offices and a kitchen. The toilet was already there, and Florian smirked as he remembered the hot plumber whose mild flirty banter had so flustered Harry they’d suddenly remembered a pressing appointment and fled.
I am going to do some “Google” now.
“As long as you don’t expect us to understand your millennial slang,” Remus said with a sigh.
He tossed the owl a treat and curled up on the sofa.
“FOUR!”
“I’m the moon,” Malfoy said with a shrug. Harry blinked at the sudden burst of light. “My third-years just did the wizard Galileo and how he was sentenced to death by the Pope for his heliocentric views. So the Moon is relevant to my course.” He eyed Harry over his goblet, took a long swig, and then darted his tongue out to lick the rim.
Hermione’s introduction was exactly five minutes long; she’d timed it on her wand and had just finished her final sentence about being happily married to a cis man when the jangly alarm went off.
Shooting him a sideways glance, Malfoy said in a tone of studied ease, “Yes, my second book is coming out later this year. Florian wanted to go over the proofs, and why he won’t just send them by owl is beyond me.”
“It’s a liquid.”
“You don’t see why a piece of cursed jewelry disappearing from nearby a magical school where a high-profile former Death Eater and the Boy-Who-Lived have just been hired to be a little … uh, shall we say, suspicious?”
Bound even though Astoria, encouraged by the Potter-led changes at Hogwarts, had come out as a lesbian at seventeen and sent shockwaves through the upper crust of the magical world.
Harry grabbed his own goblet and downed it. Damn, pumpkin juice. He needed something stronger.
“I worked for months to parse what ingredients, methods, and incantations in traditional love potions were coercive and which could be used or modified only to amplify feelings or emotions that already existed. Once I’d reached that stage, I added elements of veritaserum as a safeguard to ensure that only honest desire could be expressed.” The couple tried several variations, each of which had a slightly different effect. Only one, which turned the couple’s teeth, mouths, and digestive tracts purple, leading to a few days of unusually florid bowel movements, was scrapped entirely.
Pomona scratched her nose. “It’s due, er, next month sometime?”

Untangling themselves and settling into the half-circle of desks, the Gryffindors and Ravenclaws searched for quills and parchment. Next year, Harry was asking for funding for proper notebooks, loose-leaf paper, and ballpoints for his students. Scrolls were always leaping out of his arms and were impossible to stack. And sputtering quills and giant ink blots didn’t help their atrocious handwriting.
“You’ve got to keep them in there,” Owain said plaintively. “They’re havoc on the cabbages.” Padma smothered a giggle by biting into a biscuit.

Malfoy’s brow wrinkled. “Which part confuses your miniscule brain?”
Harry shook his head violently. “Nope. Don’t.”
Neville raised an eyebrow at him and he bit his bottom lip, then said in a sudden rush, “I’ve always liked potions.”
Ministry of Magic, Department of Continuing Education
but then he couldn’t read the smaller text through the tarnished blotches. He ran his fingers over the silver frame of a waving picture of Draco, Pansy, and Blaise. Pansy was hanging off Draco’s side and sticking her tongue out and Blaise was kissing Draco’s cheek, over and over.
“Trust me.”
Draco Malfoy.
But then when they’d accidentally catch each other’s eyes at a faculty meeting, Draco would turn crimson. And that seemed to indicate something else.
“Sex ed, Professor Malfoy, it’s called sex ed,” Britney interrupted. “We did one session in primary, but it was really rubbish and all about abstinence, which, like,” she rolled her eyes, “is really ineffective, props to like every study ever.”
It shouldn’t have worked.
Pansy scoffed. That was the correct response, as though a handjob nine years ago meant something to her heart. And it didn’t, in some ways, it really didn’t, because she didn’t want to see his dick right now, or maybe ever, but there was still a tender spot, that this was more than a toss off in a broom cupboard. It had never been meant to go anywhere, because they all knew about the Astoria thing. The contract thing.
Draco looked pale.
Blaise fought the urge to roll his eyes. Of course he was feeling the same. What kind of idiot wouldn’t want to spend all day kissing Neville. That couldn’t even be a rhetorical question. It was so obvious.
Draco hummed and tested his bond. “Really, Potter, you ought to ask first. My safeword is peppermint.”
Malfoy stared down at his arm and Harry’s hand. “It doesn’t excuse this. I should have known it was wrong. Why I did it doesn’t excuse any of it. I don’t expect you to forgive or pity me.”
And now, the Eminem bridge was a good place for some shoulder work.
Astoria grimaced.
Sirius’ mouth was a hard line. “I’ll go ask Andy what she’s got.”
“I—I can’t touch her,” Astoria sobbed. “It didn't work. She’s going to die.”
Hermione looked a bit confused for a moment, and then swung back into focus with more facts about diaphragms and spermicides.
“I drew this tonight,” they said, slapping the Lovers down on the bar. Val raised their eyebrows at the coconut, then at the card, then at the coconut again. Surely Harry could follow that.
“Old habits,” she said with a wry grin. “Can’t beat the bossy out of you.”
He swayed slowly from side to side, widening his eyes at Malfoy and nodding to encourage him. Malfoy seemed a bit like a statue, but he mechanically began moving his feet. He had his eyes fixed on a point over Harry’s shoulder, but, like, Harry wasn’t complaining.

“Ok, whatever, fine.”
“How do you know he’s changed? He’s good at lying. He probably doesn’t even know that much about the History of Magic anyway, outside of all the pureblood lies his father told him when he was little. I doubt he even paid any attention during Binns’ lessons anyway—”
“What I didn’t understand as a teenager,” she says, “is that there was and is a difference between pure, mutually consenting desire, and manipulating someone into a false or chemically-induced desire. The latter is sexual assault, whether or not it leads to physical sexual contact.”
“Goodness,” Draco said.
“Oh,” the shopkeeper said. “I’m sorry I assumed the two of you were together.” Furrowing their brow, Starr began mumbling and wandered off towards the back of the store.
Harry realized everyone was staring at him. The kids surrounding Draco had parted, and Draco was looking expectantly at Harry.
Harry looked really confused. “Here.” He thrust a wrapped cord and a charger at Draco. “So you can charge it.”

Britney swanned up, her blonde hair rolled into crunchy curls. She kept darting glances at Elspeth, who was clinging to her arm and looked terrified at the punchy beat of T.I.’s ‘Bring Em Out’ booming through the space. Elspeth was wearing some kind of robes-with-mandarin-collar outfit embroidered with phoenixes that Harry could only assume was the Traditional Formal Pureblood Wizarding Attire in Hong Kong. Malfoy would know. Irritation surged through him.
Neville’s face fell.
“It’s just never been something I either felt, or was interested in. I tried sex a few times.” He shrugged. “It was fine, but it seems like something other people get more out of. People who are asexual have a wide variety of experiences, of course. Some people don’t like sex or the idea of it. Other people are more like me, where it’s kind of on par with flossing. It’s ok, but I’m not going to seek it out.”
Harry shook himself and went into the dining room. Andromeda had knocked out the maze of dark hallways that had dominated the Black home in Wales, and now the sitting room, complete with two-meter-tall fireplace, looked into an open-plan kitchen and dining room. She’d kept the dining table that seated fourteen (“You never know,” Andromeda had said once; Harry suspected she just liked having the space to cut fabric for her quilts) and it was set with a miniature white and gold forest, complete with miniature silver centaurs chasing nymphs through the trees, trees with sparkling gem leaves, and a miniature waterfall of Hollandaise sauce.
Hey Hermione,
“You’re a cum doctor?” Harry said, before his brain could stop his mouth.
Strangely poetic, Harry mused, sipping his coffee and watching Teddy’s speedy circumambulation.
“Did you have fun today?”
Draco glared at Neville.
◼Get Greg to hire an assistant
Was Parvati looking around for Henry? It would make sense. You were supposed to find your person and kiss at midnight, yay.
“Finally, you appreciate my ability to plan,” Draco sighed. “I mean, we can start with some reconnaissance work regarding our fellow associate, because I, for one, am not quite sure how she got the job in the first place, and then we’ll go from there. Do you still have your little magical map?”
“Oh, sorry, Malfoy,” he said. “Didn’t see you glowing there.”
Val said, “He has the rhythm of a drunk billywig.”

He might be weird-looking and scarred and not really aware of wizard fashion, but Luna had said he looked amazing and it suited his aura, so, yeah. Fuck that. He was proud of being desi. Of being bi. Of having his dad’s unruly black hair and his mum’s luminous and short-sighted eyes.
She really was pleased. Neville knew he was hot. But inside he was still a bit shy. A bit bruised. But he was so careful and to hear that he’d been able to open up to someone and experience a sexual event and explore his sexuality and it sounded like a good time. She grinned.

“I, er, don’t want to disturb anything.”
Harry sighed. “Lemon creme. Or lemon-ginger. And he only takes one. Whatever, you’re right, blah blah blah.” Resuming his seam-unraveling, he grumbled, “It’s only because he could be dangerous. Like, he could be poisoning the milk or something. He still lurks about. Lurkingly.”
Everyone turned towards him.
Dear Jason,
Draco's mouth went a bit slack and he said quietly, “1757 is when the East India Company solidified its rule in the subcontinent. There was a large migration from the upper classes of Indian wizarding society, with many of those who had trading connections going to where they—”
Draco leaned back, laced his fingers together, and settled them onto the table. “Non-magical people invented the internet.”
“It’s obvious because it’s fucking class, but,” Florian paused. “It would depend on the mango.”
Remus and I have had a wonderful

“Hey,” Bill said in his gentlest voice. That was the voice for bruised knees and broken hearts and miscarriages and shattered dreams. “It’s ok, mate, whatever it is.”
“You’re done,” Andre said, tapping him on the shoulder with his wand.
At faculty meetings, Malfoy would linger near the tea cart and fuss with his cup (even though he took his tea black) or delay choosing his biscuit (even though he always settled on a lemon cream or lemon-ginger biscuit) until Harry had taken a seat, and then choose the one farthest  from Harry. That was fine. If Malfoy regretted sharing his murderous and bigoted past—even if it was fueled by a misguided desire to win his asshole father’s love—and chose to freeze Harry out, that was fine. Addie Murton and Bastian Khan seemed to have taken some kind of intrahouse-fueled sympathy on Malfoy and formed a buffer between Malfoy and Harry, always patting Malfoy’s arm or whispering asides during meetings. At the meetings, Malfoy rarely spoke, just spent them scratching away in a huge bound volume (suspicious).
Draco shot Harry a quick smile. “I have, of course, improved greatly on my fellow professor’s organization—” ah, there it was—“but I appreciate the blueprint he has laid down for curricular reform.”
“Are you using an Extendable Ear?” Remus realized, snapping his fingers at his husband.
I am writing to you to see if you and Dr. Granger had come up with a more concrete plan since we last spoke. Astoria is “willing to do almost anything to get out of the contract”—not, I might add, a legally binding phrase, but my client wanted you to know this in “those exact words, Bertram,” so I transmit them to you and Dr. Granger so that you might understand her feelings about the matter.
Scrambling to her feet for the second time in less than five minutes, Narcissa sighed. “Yes, darling, I can see that.”
Sometimes you just had to figure things out for yourself.
Harry sighed. “I’ve been in therapy since I turned seventeen? Turns out there are wizarding therapists? And I have a muggle therapist, so, like, worked through the trauma of being raised by racist Brits already. But you, what about you, therapy?”
u kno
Blaise scrunched his nose up. “No, like, not us like, you and me. Us, like, gay people. Queers. Bisexuals. Pansexuals. LGBTQIA people.”
A sob escaped her. “Yes, please. I tried giving Susan the ring and,” she pressed her hand against her mouth, “her eyes have gone all grey and she fell to the floor and—I don’t know what—”
“No, no, what’s your question?”
He was a sort of vague badness, she supposed, as far as she knew.
“It’s just not right to put children in these horrible situations!” Audrey hissed. “You two know better than anyone how awful it is to be small and to have people depending on you to do things that you shouldn’t know how to do for years, if ever at all!”
Hardly like the imposing Draco Malfoy who’d turned up his pointed chin and hissed at Blaise that the new order was coming and Blaise had better pick the right side before it was too fucking late.
“Oh, honey,” Val said. “Finish your water and get back out there.”
“If you weren’t so good, I’d think you were having an affair with him.”
“Padma said we should be collegiate.”
Then he was knocking on Malfoy’s door. There was no response, so he banged harder.
“Ginny? She’s famous enough to ensure a small crowd.”
“No, please,” Harry said. “Let us.”
There was a comfortable pause, during which Pansy realized all the tension had seeped from her shoulders. He fucking understood her in a way no one else did. She couldn’t stop a grateful smile from sneaking onto her face.
“I don’t think we need to demonstrate,” Harry said through gritted teeth. “I think they can figure out what it’s for, generally speaking.”
“Oh, yeah.” There wasn’t a reason to read hesitation into anything. The whole overanalyzing thing had severely backfired last time. “Guess we should take this,” she said and bent to pick up the champagne bottle.
Thanks for letting me know about Draco’s confusion. Module 3 is titled “Identity and Biology,” and covers the wide variety of non-magical races (and how human race is a construct with very real and horrible historical and contemporary effects), body types and shapes, disabilities, illnesses and diseases (with a

He shook his head violently.

Harry took advantage of his silence to look around Malfoy’s quarters. The entire room was covered with a plush emerald rug, but it was barely visible between piles of paper and books and clothes. There were two armchairs by the fireplace (how come he got two?).
Harry raised his eyebrows.
“And Draco, ooh, I wonder if it’s a field trip,” Hermione gushed. “We’d discussed that, but the Ministry was being so shitty about permissions, but I’m so glad to see Jason wore them down eventually.”
It was almost like the git could apparate inside the castle. Or maybe he just walked really fast and really silently. That seemed like the kind of skill you’d pick up if you had to live with Voldemort and his intimates.
Harry felt very stupid in the silence that stretched between them.
“Wait,” Pansy said, narrowing her eyes. “You’re saying the internet made you a non-blood-purist?”
“Anyway,” Harry interrupted, “I was thinking about Christmas this year and wondering what you were doing. Wasn’t sure if I wanted to commit to the Weasleys for the entire holiday period.”
Harry groaned inwardly. He was sure that little moue was how he’d wheedled a teamful of Nimbus 2000s from his dad. It was just this side of pitiful.
“Wait—is this—” Harry began flipping through the pages. “Is this a novel?”
“Er, they, the two of them, men, yes?” Draco was twisting the mug in his hands.
One corner of Draco’s mouth threatened to lift into a smile. “Pustulent ones?”
“See you tomorrow morning, Harry,” Andromeda whispered, levitating her somnolent grandson towards the Floo. “It’s lovely that you’ve asked Draco, too.”
(keep sirius, draco, romilda in the loop)

“Oh, no, not like that!” Draco yelped. “No! It’s about narratives of immigration and emigration. Not about like, the Potter family.”
Neville resurfaced and tucked the errant banana chip into his pocket. “Compost.”
Concerning Module 3
Blaise opened his eyes a little wider and blinked at Draco a few times.
Fleur hummed.

“I hardly think it’s bad, since I used it as the basis for my improved curricular reform plan,” Draco said with the hint of a smile. “Don’t get cocky, Potter.”
“Er,” Harry said. He hadn’t seen her since she’d tried to hand him over to Voldemort.  Or hypothetically tried. It hadn’t worked. Harry attempted not to be fussed. “I’m not his keeper.”
Lavender pressed her back against the pilaster. The voice rose louder and louder. She should fucking step away from the stone. She was too good at talking to it, but she didn’t trust her legs to hold up on their own.
Remus tapped his ballpoint against the newsprint, then gasped, “Knickers!”
“Then there’s the issue of the Winter Ball—” Harry snapped back. This was his shit. “Professor Potter has proposed that a wizarding ‘dee-jay’ be hired to play magical and Muggle songs.”
Hermione waited. She didn’t totally have time to just wait around but like, few things were more important than an impromptu visit from her best friend (well, other than Ron, she always had to clarify, but Ron was also her fiancé, which always seemed like it came with the assumption that you had to love that person as a friend and a lover like if you were going to marry them one day and oh fuck, she hadn’t written Molly back about those napkins).
Harry thought belatedly.
“Oh, hey,” Lavender said with a bright smile.
Draco Malfoy
Harry was saved from any further conversation by the sudden explosion of a pumpkin near the Slytherin table. It released crimson canaries that flew around shitting flames and dive-bombing students. McGonagall snapped out of her soliloquy and shot a jet of water across the entire Hall. Students and professors alike gaped.
Harry looked confused.
Draco leaned back. “Potter, wake up. You’ve missed all of Starr’s lovely explanations.”
─────── ⎎ ───────
“Drat!” she cried, summoning them back to her. Luna had taken one of the papers and was reading it upside down.
, but Binns was an institution here. Malfoy can’t replace him.”
, and then they were in the Great Hall, and Harry and Draco were sitting side-by-side in the middle of the panel, facing hundreds of curious eyes.
still a shit.
Draco sat up.
“Oh,” Padma said in a casual tone. “Was it that he proved his loyalty to the Death Eaters after failing to murder Dumbledore by killing Greg Goyle’s suicidal one-hundred-and-ninety-four-year-old Squib grandfather who’d been abandoned by the rest of the family after his witch wife died? Or was it how he used his inheritance to establish an anti-war charity named after the Creevey brothers?” Padma paused and narrowed her eyes at him. “Don’t tell anyone else that. I accidentally opened one of his owls. The man who runs the charity has atrocious handwriting.”
Hermione raised an eyebrow.
Padma sighed. “I’m not really into that kind of lamp ritual, but I’d have done it with you if I’d known you’d never done it. Parvati’s always inviting me down to London to celebrate with her and Lavender. They’re so grossly in love it’s stupid and they always try to divine shit about my love life from my leftover chai.”
“Er,” Harry said. “I’ll just wait outside until you’re done.”
“I’ll teach you about the kettle and things tomorrow,” she said, gesturing towards the kitchen table.
“Er, you asked me if I’d gotten like, bonded to Blaise accidentally? And every time we kiss, you seem kind of weirded out. And then you stared at those lesbians in Costa for a really long time.”
Chair, Department of Potions
Malfoy was scarlet and had his eyes fixed on a point far, far away. Harry ran one finger from his lips down his own torso, never taking his eyes off Malfoy.
Harry’s eye twitched. He spun on his heel and spit, “As if, Malfoy. I’m watching you.”
She opened the door too fast to have not been lurking in the hallway. “Yes?”
“It’s called the Marauders’ Map,” Harry said through gritted teeth. “It’s actually quite a complicated piece of spellwork and my dad and his friends were really advanced for their age to be able to figure it out.”
“It was!”
Eighth year had been a dream—it was what school should have been all along. No one was trying to kill him. Only Seamus and Ron roasted him, and that was always with affection. Turns out he excelled at DADA, Muggle Studies, Charms, and Transfiguration when he wasn’t possessed. He tutored younger students and realized that this—teaching—was what he loved. Dumbledore’s Army should have been a clue, but now he knew, down in his bones, that he was an educator. But more than anything he loved waking up in his dorm and listening to his best friend snore Saturday mornings away. At least until Hermione stormed up the stairs and herded them to breakfast and the library. Harry was usually waiting for her, tucked up with some new Agatha Christie or Angela Thirkell (yeah, he had the reading taste of a grandma; it was all about comfort and coziness, deal with it), and would spring out of bed fully dressed to shake Ron awake before she barreled into the boys’ dorm.
