In other news (I wanted to add this for the last update but I forgot): Tumblr User @futo-mOmO created a lovely fanart for this fic, specifically of the scene when Draco saw Harry die through the Amulet! Please check it out!! https://futo-m0m0.tumblr.com/post/637414115227369472/some-fanart-from-the-fic-draco-malfoy-and-the
Hello, my dear readers! Here I am, with the last chapter before the final battle. Hope you'll enjoy it!
Hello, my dear readers! I'm updating a day early bc I'm having a visitor over the weekend, so I'll be busy tomorrow.
And before you jump on me in the comments: Yes, the letter will be talked about. Be patient, young padawans.

Before you read on, I'd like to point out that I changed the total chapter count for this fic. I went through the file and realised that I double-named some of the not yet posted chapters. Ooops. So, you'll have more chapters to look forward to. The fic has a total of 26 chapters + Epilogue now. (The number here is 28 because of the Author Note I added a while ago).
Thank you for all the love and support this story receives! I'm reading all your comments with immense joy!! This time, I'm back with Arthur's return. This part consists of three snippets and three POVs. I hope you'll enjoy it!!
“Technically, I might not be a single much longer,” Neville said, with a shy smile. “After saying hello to Harry and Ron later, I’ll spend the afternoon with Susan.”
There were still hard days, Draco knew. Both of them had those. There were days when Draco forgot how to smile, or when Harry needed him to firecall because the distance coupled with his fear of loss was just too much. There were times when Draco still felt worthless, and he had long sessions with Healer Jones to dissect those emotions.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco threw his hands up, calling out to the universe. Neville looked apologetic.
... 4 more post-war chapters + one non-canon-related epilogue to go :)
Hello, my dear readers! I'm sorry for the long wait for this chapter! Life keeps being insane for me, and it's hard to keep up a private life next to work. But I finally found a moment to proof-read and post this after I finished this yesterday on the bus. I hope you'll enjoy Draco and Merlin's quest to Hogwarts and our little surprise guest :D
Ron: heterosexual (male - he/him)
Please enjoy!!
Luna: pansexual (female - she/her)
Information on what happens within the suicide attempt scene if you want to skip it:
... I'm sorry? *goes and hides*
“Merlin, I missed you,” Harry breathed into his neck.
Hello, my dear readers! I'm sorry this story hasn't been updated in so long! I usually write it on the bus between work, and work was stressful before we were all sent home, and now that I'm working from home, I kind of didn't come around to writing on it, since there were no bus rides. But now I am officially on holidays and I decided to sit down and write.
So, that leaves only the Epilogue, which you can expect in two weeks time, as always! It will be set 8 months after this chapter. Also, I will give you some more details on future content for this series next week :)
The quote for the title of this installment is by Nathaniel Hawthorne.
Hello, my dear readers! I'm back with the next update for this story, and more drama. The groundwork for this plot development has been laid in the last chapter, and I hope you'll enjoy the outcome. Happy reading :)
I hope you'll enjoy this one! :)
(See the end of the chapter for
That's that :) I hope you're as excited as I am for all the content that's to come.
“This is going to be a bloody shitshow,” Draco shook his head. “Mother is going to want this elaborate, elegant pureblood thing, and the Weasley family will want to make it this cosy family thing, and that’s just going to clash.”
Happy reading :D
Relevant information in case you want to skip the sex scene:
Hello, dear readers! I'm back with the new week! Had another horrible work week with 10 workdays in a row, but somehow managed to squeeze this in between. It's a national holiday today, so I found the time to post it. Please enjoy :) This chapter tells the evolvement of Harry and Draco's relationship from three viewpoints.
Hello, everyone! Here I am, with the last regular chapter of this story! My God, I can't believe we made it here. Amazing. I hope that you'll enjoy this chapter and that it wraps everything up to your satisfaction. It is definitely the conclusion that had me making a lot of plot-decisions throughout the story, and I hope it helps you understand why some things happened the way they happened.
Rosmerta only nodded at them in acknowledgement as they made their way back to the rooms of the inn. Harry had taken to booking a room for the day when they could see each other. “The things I want to do to you when I haven’t been able to touch you for such a long time are not suited for the public eye,” was the explanation he had given Draco, but really, Draco didn’t complain. It was nice, having a bit of an escape with Harry.
I just want to note once again that, though this fight turned really nasty, I don't hate Ron and this is in no way meant to be Ron-bashing. The conflict between Ron and Draco is a problem that's been dragging on and on through the entire series and now it's, quite literally, come to blows, with the help of the locket. It was bound to happen and I think this event is very necessary for Ron's character development.
The first is that I finished writing the actual DIAOA series and am now planning the sequel! For that purpose, I'd like your cooperation. Please follow this
Hello, my dear readers! Back with the new chapter! This one contains an explicit sex scene! If you want to skip it, please look out for the markings - ***e*** for the beginning and ***/e/*** for the ending of the scene. Explanations of what happens in the scene can be found in the endnotes.
Hello, my dear readers! Here I am, back with the next chapter :) I won't keep you waiting, after the cliffhanger last time. Enjoy!
I hope you're having a wonderful holiday, and that this update, as emotional as it is, is going to sweeten it a bit for you. Please enjoy!
“The Aurors would fire you on the first day, babe,” Ginny grinned.
What did he need to see the village for, anyway? If he needed anything, he could send the others to shop for him. This was more important.
Hello, my dear readers! Here I am, with the first part of the final battle. I hope you'll enjoy it :)
They ended up squeezing into their usual table and ordering a round of butterbeers. Harry and Weasley had originally agreed to stay for one drink with the whole group before stealing their partners away for some privacy each visit. That plan had flown out of the window the first time Weasley had actually set eyes on Hermione after weeks of separation - the man had no self-control. Harry at least

not to comment. Instead, he pulled a little box from his robe pocket and handed it to Harry.
Hey everyone! So, a lot of you have been asking for Harry's side of his small (read: big) emotional and sexual crisis. Well. Without further ado, here we go :)
Things were good. Or at least, they were getting there.
The Horcrux draws on all of Draco's insecurities, like the fear that he isn't wanted or doesn't belong with the group and that Harry doesn't love him anymore and convinces Draco that the only way to escape the situation is to disappear entirely by drowning himself. He slips away from the group unnoticed, but Hermione and Harry find him before he can do any real harm to himself. They realise quickly that the Horcrux has a bigger influence on Draco because he had already been possessed by one in the past, so his soul is more vulnerable. Harry approaches Draco in the water and binds him with robes so he can take off the locket.
I hope you're doing okay, in the midst of all the chaos, and that everyone is healthy. I hope this update cheers up all of you who are stuck at home like me and suffering from it! Many people forget that social distancing and self-isolating, as well as the whole social paranoia that is in the air atm, are difficult for people who are already suffering from mental conditions, so please take care of yourselves!
“It would probably be easier on them if we all didn’t flaunt our relationships quite so much all the time,” Luna said wisely. She was now arranging flowers in Yurika’s hair, her actions at complete odds with her words.
Sighing, he opened the door to his chambers, immediately slipping back under the covers and sinking into the pillows. The satin sheets and the mattress was just the right amount of softness. Harry settled in and spent a few minutes setting up his occlumency shields before he let his thoughts take over.
Excited, he grabbed the first two books leaving the chest in the protective care of the private library it was housed in, and carried them to his room. He carefully set one down next to his bed before settling down comfortably with the book for the descendents. Filled with anticipation, he turned to Chapter 1, eyes moving over the words with wonder.
(See the end of the chapter for
Enaretos planned to recruit a scholar and healer that are well-versed in their fields but are hidden from view. Just like the Royals.
“You could both be
“So,” starts Valoweith “we must send a set of troops to the other world to find and bring back our royal family.”
While the salmon is roasting in the oven, he set the table quickly with Aunt Petunia's help and as he was taking out the food from the oven and strainer respectively, Uncle Vernon arrived home. Aunt Petunia hurried to greet him, taking his coat off and kissing him on the cheek. “BOY! DINNER BETTER BE READY AND ON THE TABLE BY THE TIME I ENTER THE PANTRY!!” hollers Uncle Vernon and Harry already knows that he would be getting a beating because he was still plating the food and it was not on the table yet. Dudley and Aunt Petunia wear sad smiles on their faces, eyes filled with pity and unspoken apologies. He gave them a strained smile in return, letting them know that he understood why they couldn't help.
“So please just one healer!” He yelped, raising his arms to protect himself from any more flying medical death weapons.
He decided to first visit the legion hospital to recruit their healer.
“You can get back to work for now my dear, and when I return we can start packing.” She offered Iktix a kind smile and led Enaretos out, the doors closing behind them to protect a secret so dangerous to all their lives.
At the moment Harry was headed towards the library to look for the books his great grandfather had suggested he read. He entered the Lord’s study and took the door on his right into the Potter’s private library. Looking around the vast space filled with books, towering shelves upon shelves, he sure hoped there was a directory. He found the small chest his grandfather spoke of, placed off to the side by the window seat on a glass tea table. Making his way over to the chest, he noticed that it had a very simple design but the wood seemed to be alive, responding to his presence and thrumming with energy.
Enaretos thanked the gods while following her out of the office, but did not forget to question her sanity (in his head of course, he didn't need her scalpels thrown at him again).
“But, Avaren, we cannot continue to expend more sylphs. Your kind are brave and swift in the air, however, they are also our greatest and most talented healers. We cannot afford to lose them.”
There is a word I would like to give the definition of since it is an odd one
“Yeah...yeah I got it” Harry cleared his throat, “Continue”.
The Lulai trees are protective trees that have a mind of it's own. Meaning they protect what they believe is important. Dark elf land is native to the species.The Lulai tree which you will encounter for a brief moment is one of the seven kinds. The colors are in their barks. The Yellow barked Lulai tree makes the distance form the tree to what they are protecting the same from any direction. It is finding the trees that is hard. They appear willingly to whom they think are worthy, otherwise it is dangerous and psycologiacaly draining to find.
“Fellow High Table members, it is a pleasure to see you again under good news instead of the bad for once” Enáretos says as he walks in to take his seat at the High table. Looking around, he realizes that every Archiean, their respective seers and the Goblin representative are all here, and the only person missing was Anagnostis, the royal star reader and seer. Enàretos looks at each member and they face him wearing smiles on their faces as they nod in greeting.
“I had a dream, and I heard two people talking. I could almost see them but I don’t remember anymore. Their appearances are hazy to me for some reason. But I knew that I had seen the building they were in. I saw it in a picture in that book! I went back to the library and found it…... And that picture, those people were
“Dursley, how long have you been planning this exactly?”
“End the war for good? Are you sure?” She asked, her furry brows furrowing as she placed the scalpel back in the drawer.
“Yeah except that he was a tiny little tree branch brought to life by the Fae healers and thought that he was the bachelor that could seduce the King’s two year old daughter.” This only caused Asdern to choke by trying to hold in his laughter and caused Enaretos to stop and just glare at Gryn.
“Precisely!” Anagnostis nods his head in agreement as he finishes.
All Comments are appreciated.
Screamed Harry's thought's
The answer completely threw Harry off “Duds you didn't-” Harry started.
To the right of Anagnostis' empty chair, sat the Arch Satyr, Tassarion and the seer, Xaliv. Tassarion was expressionless as he surveyed the room. His horns fully grown and curved at the end, small ears covered under his unruly brown hair, eyes cold and calculating, he emitted a rather intimidating aura.
Hermione started thinking in earnest when something caught her eye. Harry’s hand.
“And this is why she is your perfect candidate. Nobody knows she is here and nobody can ever know. But I can guarantee she is much better than any healer I know, even me…..and she needs to disappear.” Talian faced Enaretos with that sly, dumb smirk of hers.
It was almost as if someone purposely made the chest appear plain and ‘normal’ to the normal person’s eye. But the intricate crafting taken to the wood had clearly been embedded with creature magic connecting to his own. His fingers reached for the padlock that appeared to have no keyhole,  when all of a sudden, Harry felt a sharp pain in his thumb.
two hours before dawn, not a minute later, is that understood? Both of you?” demanded Enaretos with a hard voice, expression one of steel.
is. The archway is adorned with beautiful, ethereal carvings portraying harmony among the races and the world's other inhabitants. At the doorway to the entrance stand two faun guards. The walls behind them hold statues of past chieftains and seers who have done more than consult, who have displayed enormous bravery by leading the most courageous of soldiers and engaging in the most fiercest of battles. The statues are of the most loyal and spirited subjects to have ever sat at the High Table.
a war…” she smiled sadly as she uttered the last few words.
As promised the Chapter has been delivered to you!! Enjoy!!
There's a few bits of information you lot need to know before you start reading.
Talian released her aura to lightly touch the heavy white doors, urging them to make way. As they gradually opened for them, Enaretos found not an unoccupied garden but rather an occupied one. He could only see their back and Enaretos slowly reached for his sword, stopping when he felt Talian’s hand on his arm calming his movement. Waiting for the doors to close, Talian called out to the person, “Iktix dear, would you come over here?”
“Please, I cannot say anything except that it will help end the war for good!” He swore he felt a strand of his hair sliced as he rolled away from two more scalpels (
I should die a painfull and tortuous death I know. My sister, your beloved editor is in the current process of skinning me alive so fear not i am being punished. But finally here it is a chapter. Enjoy!!!!
“Xaliv! Good to see you as well, and yes, I bring wonderful news, but the actual witness of this will be delayed a few hours. Till he arrives let us deal with other matters.”
. And
'My father will hear about this' is finally here!
Nueleth chuckles softly at the remark and rises, welcoming Anagnostis as she speaks to the table with innocent authority, “We must discuss the prophecy and discuss the methods in which to find and bring our rulers to the palace. Star reader, if you could inform us of the details and the location where our rulers are residing currently, we can start with that as our basis.”
“You just want me to dig you out of trouble don’t you? That’s why your mood changed so fast and you have that awful smirk on your furry face right.”
As usual constructive criticism and comments are much adored!! Please do not be shy
There was a lot that happened over the last two years in my university career that pushed me to focus my energy on school for the most part. Therefore I cannot apologize enough to the community of wonderful readers that have taken an interest in this story, especially for leaving you alone for a long period of time. With the terrible situation of COVID 19 I am exclusively at home due to online class implementation. Hence my return. I have few chapters that will go up for you wonderful readers in the next few weeks. I will not promise update dates since its a horrible crime to not keep a promise and I am clearly wonderful at committing this particular one. What I can say is that compared to the last 2 years there will be a few frequent updates in the upcoming weeks.
The courtyard behind the garden harbors the entrance to the Sky Lair: an archway that appears to be made of glass but in reality, is formed out of frozen air, much like the
The title read.
As went down the stairs to the kitchen Harry sees Dudley sitting at the round table in front of the TV, finishing his letter to Charlie Weasley. Their friendship was a shocker for him. Harry would think that Dudley would be friends with Fred and George, considering their ability to accept anyone who has good intentions despite a bad past. But it was Charlie that Dudley found a friend in, maybe because he's a Dragon trainer back in Romania and he deals with creatures that are “vastly misunderstood” as Hagrid says. As Harry started on dinner, which for today would be roasted salmon with a side of boiled vegetables, Dudley lets me know that Hedwig would be returning with a reply in a few days instead of the usual week, as Charlie was also visiting The Burrow for the summer.
It was relatively calming to gaze upon smiles and glowing faces after seeing centuries of weary faces, worn down by constant battles. It seemed the difference was due to the main topic of the day, a topic that brought hope and the possibility of a better world. “Unfortunately, Anagnostis will be delayed. While we await his presence, let us go over the defense plans.”
answers. School starts in two weeks and I won’t be able to focus on anything,” he scowled, tired of not knowing.
She turned to face him unhurriedly and he could slowly but surely feel something rising within the room.
Whoever they were, Harry loved the grandparent who wrote this one. It was exactly what he needed. Hopefully it could answer his most pressing questions clearly, with no roundabout explanations that only Hermione could understand, thank you very much. Speaking of Hermione, he figured it would be a good idea to tell her about the books. They would probably get through them faster if Hermione knew, even if Harry was the one who could actually read most of the books in the chest.
Enjoy.
We tried hard to recreate the image of Aitherios in our minds through words, so we hope you will read it with a positive mindset and enjoy it.
I apologise for the late update. School started this week so it took awhile to get the chapter edited.
“Our rulers are in another world. More specifically, the Human world. Now, there are two reasons for this: The first is that when the stars started dancing, the lights faded in and out which tells us that the rulers are from another world. This is an extremely rare occurrence, one that I never knew I would witness with my own eyes.”
The last year was just chaotic all in one. Not that this summer's any different from the past ones, but it just got harder without his friends to assure him that none of what happened at the Department of Mysteries was his fault. But it was hard not to think that way, Sirius dead, the prophecy broken, using an Unforgivable, and old Voldy escaping in plain sight; honestly, the bad outweighed any good that happened. To make it even worse, Uncle Vernon seemed intent on taking out all the anger he had to hide while Sirius was still alive, protecting Harry. Getting beaten everyday while his aunt watched helplessly, and his cousin trying to stop him without diverting that anger towards himself, is not the best kind of summer yet. Harry dreaded today's dinner, he was sure that Uncle Vernon would find fault in something and take out his day's stress on Harry once again.
“You want to borrow a healer?”
Huge thanks to my sister who is my wonderful Beta reader and alarm clock for the writing deadlines!!
Just shy of midnight, Anagnóstis notices a sudden change in the stars that were normally calm. He notices the stars starting to dance with each other, their light mixing and fading, crossing each other as if they were doing a váls itself. Their colors changing and just...happiness presenting itself within the stars of the night sky. But the moment the clock strikes twelve, the stars shrivel, as if in fear, and the sky is filled with the moon shining brightly along with the red stars gathering together. Anagnóstis gasps, his glitter gray eyes widening as he watches the stars play a story of disaster and prosperity. In his four hundred seventy-five years of age, he has never before seen such a display by the stars.
if they were from this world, the star’s lights would have brightened while they danced. The second reason is when the war started, and our former rulers were slaughtered, many of our races fled this world for the safety of themselves or their children. Most of them escaped to the human world through a dangerous portal.”
Thank you for taking time out f your precious day to read this story. We hope you enjoyed it.
“Harry. Harry..!” she whispered breathlessly, “ your hand! The rune’s
“High General!” greeted Gryn from his right, his first and second flanking him on each side.
“Yes, Ma’am” his voice shook a fraction when he answered.
“I'll be down soon Aunt Petunia”, he replied as he got up while holding his tender ribs and grimacing when he put pressure on his swollen ankle. At least he could feel his ankle now, thanks to Dudleys' tape that was wrapped around his ankle for the better part of the day.
Year- Stoe
And without further ado ENJOY!!!!!!!!!
“I understand Sir, also now that it is confirmed that both you and the pointy overachiever is departing are the plans for mission Naldievix in effect?”
The Arch Fae Ralael, was as always, clothed in dark colors of nature. Even the glow around him itself, was a dark green. Strangely enough, his eyes were an unnatural lavender. His ears were long and so pointed that it seemed sharp enough to prick one's finger on if touched. His cyan hair was tied in a small knot at the top of his head while the rest fell like a waterfall, against his back.
for this, do you understand what you have done?!” growled Enaretos, his back turned to her
to the end Xaliv, no matter who’s speaking. I have not seen the phenomenon in person until now, but it has always been in the books, my child. Every star reader learns all there is know about the stars and their actions, even those that are most rare and unlikely. As I was saying earlier
“Then why in Onoros’ name would you do this?!”
Enaretos startled hearing the name, whipping his head to face the head healer so fast he could've been one of her flying scalpels, “Talian why do you have a dragon shifter working for you?!” he hissed at her under his breath. Suddenly, her words of not having extra wounds than necessary in a war made sense, “This is dangerous, what you are doing Lian!”
Comments, Kudos, Questions and Constructive criticism is always adored so please don't be shy.I just wanted to let you know that i have started a blog dedicated to Aitherios so we can converse and have more updated on how the fic is coming along. The link is below:
Xaliv, as always, looked liked he was suffering through a quite severe case of constipation. Enáretos was of the opinion that Xaliv and Valoweith would be equally matched in battle for having the least amount of facial expressions. “
“Of course, of course Dudley. Ask your mother to take out the bird from the freaks bedroom after dinner, but make sure he stays out my way son.”
SHOUTOUT to my Little Sister (JUST ASKED MY SISTER HOW TO SPELL LITTLE, I CAN"T- ) who pushed me to write the chapters and then painstakingly edited them for me. I LOVE HER and you should THANK her for the chapters mostly.
The two ladies shared a look and bowed in his direction, “Yes General, of course.”
“Ruegalic, my friend, how does the air feel today, is it different?”
Asdern and Gryn just smirked at him.
As always corrections, suggestions, criticisms, and appreciation is always welcome.
As always constructive criticism and wild comments are appreciated!
Ignoring his friend, Gryn tilted his head towards Enaretos, inquiring, “What are my orders sir?”
Ruegalic the pegasus has a telepathic bond with Enaretos to communicate. They are bonded Partners. There will be more info about bonded animals later into the story.
“Anagnostis foresaw it.” He stated firmly, pulling the scalpel out of his robe and rising to his feet as the satyr shoved the drawer in and made her way to him, arms open amicably.
Beelining to the shelves in red and purple wood, he climbed the ladder and grabbed the chest. Safely back on the ground, he flipped it open and pulled out the first book on top of the pile. Turning through the pages, he stopped when he found the chapter on the Scholar's Veil. He stared at the page for a good minute, eyes increasingly widening, before taking off again, now rushing through the towering hallways.
“Yes, of course. Everybody else has arrived, let us make haste” Xaliv replies as he turns haughtily to lead the way to the High Table.
Harry lifted both his hands and stared in amazement at the glowing rune. A faint silver glimmered lowly, fading away as he watched.
As the kingdom's and Royal family's official star reader, Anagnóstis sees in front of his eyes, a prophecy that has only been written in history books, come alive. He calls upon the Faun guard through the

“It was…...well, I think they are going somewhere. One of them was a general I think. He didn't want to give any details. I don’t remember a whole lot,” he scratched his head in frustration.

“Right hand blue” Weasley called, the audience beginning to cheer on their chosen candidate. The majority was for Potter, of course, but he thought he heard his name at least once.
The jealousy pushed Harry up the stairs, the need to protect kept him close behind Draco. The just pure lust he felt at seeing Draco in that outfit kept his eyes wandering. The rage was still there, making his steps heavy. Still with half a mind to go back and teach Barren a lesson. Draco was probably aware of that, because he made sure to make his way to the 8

year by any means, but then again he had heard many decided to go elsewhere for their last year of education so who knows. Either way, it wasn’t
“Get a better grip.” Draco asked Barren, taking the goblet and throwing the rest of the pumpkin juice in Barren’s face. He turned sharply, and strutted out the door, smirking. Ultimately, that may have not been the best move but he’s only human after all.
“Do” was all Draco could manage back because despite being objectively more level headed than Potter, he was only human after all. Draco felt Potter’s clothes, and his own pants be spelled away so they stood naked, pressed against each other.
“Yes?”
Headache and wrist ache gone, all that was left was the bloody ankle. Sort of literally. She had wrapped it, pressed healing herbs to it and whispered some healing incantations. He would be fine by tomorrow, she said. But even after her diagnosis still stayed. She gave Potter a look before leaning closer to Draco and whispered, “Is there anyone you’d like me to report, Draco?”
Harry had about a hundred questions, but the main one being, “wait- are you- Malfoy are we-“
“I see”
As Draco was walking back he heard voices, no
Weasel had seen the two of them stop and called, “oy, you two. Come on, we’re about to begin.” Potter started walking over, Draco flying right behind him.
he had a thing for Potter’s hair. Sue him. He honestly didn’t realize he had starting to stroke a hand through Potter’s hair until he felt the other move.

“A prophecy doesn’t make you super human, Harry. It was makes you super stubborn.”
“Oh” was all Draco could manage without betraying himself.
“So much” Harry mumbled, sucking on Draco’s skin. It took most of Draco’s will power to bat him off.
Draco, for his part, shrugged off the two goonies who ran to help Barren. His first instinct was to run. All this unwanted attention, Harry
Draco moaned, much louder now, into the wild black raven hair.
Draco rolled his eyes, but pursed his lips too much Harry knew meant Draco agreed, no matter how much it pained him. “Nurse said it’ll be healed by tonight. Plus...remember earlier I said the only thing I’d be riding today is my broom?” He paused to enjoy the beautifully lust filled expression that filled Potter’s face. His pupils expanded, jaw seeming to go slack. “I lied” Draco whispered, nipping at Harry’s earlobe for full effect.
“Oops. My bad Malfoy. It was perfectly good pumpkin juice too. Shame.” Barren sneered, he looked to Harry for approval. Harry had stood up, slowly walking around the edge of the table to face Barren. Draco recognized that look. It was the same expression Harry wore when he looked at his Father in the Mansion. The same look he wore when Draco had flung the Crutiatus curse at him in the bathroom. The same he look Harry wore that first train ride to Hogwarts when Draco had made fun of Weasel.
Potter.”
they’ll never leave us alone and I...a week. A week in secret, to adjust, and then we can...assess.”
Draco smiled down at him, leaning to kiss Harry, threading his hands through his hair. “Ready?”
“That’s enough, Ron, I think.” Granger interjected rapidly. She wasn’t sober, but she also wasn’t stupid.
“Bloody liar” Draco protested, but Harry cut him off again. “Okay, yeah I do want to sleep with you but I...I want more than that. Much more than that.”
Draco tore his gaze away from where he was tracing along the scars on his torso with malice, and to the door. “You can come in.” Draco called, though it might not have come out all that loudly. Either way, within a second Harry had pulled the door open. His eyes wide and concerned. After a moment, Harry shut the door behind him. Through the frosted glass door, Draco could see Harry step cautiously closer to the shower.
year table was in the middle, the center point of the room.
It landed on Hermione.
“I didn’t get their names.” Draco shrugged.
“I’ve lost count.”
“My uncle and my aunt locked me in a closet underneath the stairs for twelve years.” Harry whispered, kissing Draco’s wrist. As though he needed something good to prepare him for a bad thought. “They knew I was magical but didn’t tell me. Not for twelve years.”
“We’re going to be living together, please call me Harry.”
Harry nodded, and Draco felt his hands drift down, floating over his soft skin to gently rub at the top back of Draco’s thighs. Draco immediate blushed, giving Harry and incredulous look.
Harry nodded, exercising most of his will power to keep his hips still. After a moment, Draco placed his hands on Harry’s chest, leaning forward slightly and slowly lifted himself up. There was still too much burning to feel the pleasure of the act yet, but as Draco slowly impaled himself again, he felt his stomach start to tighten again.
The rest of the opening speech came and went, Harry much to distracted to hear any of it. The feast had just begun when Harry slipped out, taking a sandwich with him. The noise was just...hundreds of students in one Great Hall was a stark contrast to the silence of Grimmauld Place. He’d get used to it, just...not yet.
Draco finally caught his eye, giving Potter a cheeky smirk. Draco ran his ring fingers through his hair, adjusting the curls that hung at the front. Harry could only stare back, physically sitting on his hands the urge to touch too strong.
So he thought, by the third “left arm yellow” Granger had accidentally elbowed Pansy in the face, knocking both of them out, nearly pushing Draco over in his very precarious position that was reminiscent of an extreme yoga pose.
Harry looked down, shaking his head. Draco gripped his cup just a bit tighter but quickly loosened his grip. Hermione had a carefully blank expression on her face, “no”. The cup kept glowing, everyone erupted in laughter, Ron looking extremely hurt.
Now, tangling himself with a bunch of his classmates that surely hated him wasn’t on his to-do list, but Luna dragged him up and you just...can’t say no to Luna. So Draco, Harry, Pansy, Granger and...where did Luna go? Just those four were up, standing unsure on the edge of the mat.
There were more murmurs about this, specifically in the eighth year table. Harry sat at the very end, closest to the door, with Ron and Hermione flanking him of course.
The stayed like that for a while, kissing into each other’s mouths with Draco keeping them together. Eventually, Harry shifted causing their erections to brush and Harry groaned into Draco’s mouth. “Let me make you feel good” Harry whispered, pressing one last kiss to Draco before kissing back down his body again.

were near as gratifying then the low, grumbling moan Harry made around Draco’s finger when Draco took him in hand.
Draco spat back, though there was no spite, only hopelessness, hopelessness that poured out in the form of...
“Hey mate” Ron greeted him, the tone of voice warning Harry that there was definitely something Ron wanted to talk to him about.
“Am not” Harry protested, taking the Invisibility cloak out his back pocket and unfurling it.
Draco looked up at him with a look that clearly said, “that’s literally what I’m doing you twat.”
you twat.” Maybe his ankle wouldn’t be so bad. Maybe. 3, 2...he stepped off and
Draco’s vison had become narrow, focused only on the pounding between his legs. Of Harry pounding into him. Distantly, Draco was aware that he was mumbling, maybe screaming, Harry’s name. That Harry was pounding into him so hard, Draco could hear the bed frame slap against the wall. The pound of the bed frame mixed with the sinful sound of skin on skin, combined with the fast, hard thrusts Draco felt pound into him where too much.
“I’ve got plans, sorry.” Draco dismissed, sitting down. He met Harry’s eyes, clearly delighted at how wound up Harry was at the whole ordeal. Really, the dinner had just started. Maybe Draco was wrong, this might be fun after all. Harry couldn’t help bit give a smug smirk at Tom (?) before he turned away.
. But Weasel continued, “last year- or two years ago I suppose all Harry could do was follow Malfoy and now, they’re stuck together.”
Harry nodded, almost going to a hug but realizing that probably wouldn’t be welcome. “I’m sorry, Gin.” He whispered before turning and walking out and of the common room.
I told y'all I'd always update (eventually)
“You said it, not me” Draco retorted before he could stop himself. But to his great relief, Granger actually laughed. Not a full laugh but better than he expected.
“Then do them” Draco whispered back, his long fingers slowly tracing down Harry’s chest intently.
. Draco stewed as he sat in Muggle Studies.
, Draco hit the floor as his socks slid, with some prompting from himself, and he landed with a thud on his back. Potter collapsed right on top of him, his legs apparently taken out with Draco’s.
“I don’t know.” Harry whispered, shame drenching his voice.
“Gryffindor common room. Fifteen minutes. Or I’ll send Neville” Hermione prompted, waiting until Harry nodded before waving goodbye to Draco and exiting the room.
it did.
“There’s so many things I want to do to you Malfoy...for so long” Harry whispered, his fingers slipping under Draco’s waistband, fingers ghosting over his ass, which made Draco shudder.
Harry nodded, pressing another kiss to his temple. “It’s gonna be hard not to kiss you in pubic.”
Draco shut his eyes, feeling very conflicted but also painfully turned on. Harry’s hands teased a bit more before unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, carefully, one by one. Halfway Harry stopped, kissing Draco once and whispered, “open your eyes” against Draco’s lips.
Draco managed to traverse the halls leading to the court yard with relative ease, only once knocking into a disgruntled first year. At last he saw Potter, just where he thought he would, talking to Graner and Weasel-bee. Draco had, without a doubt, learned what a bit of Potter’s habits last year and now it was finally paying off.
gotten Draco into his arms it seemed extremely unfair that Harry would need to fight to keep him there.
“You didn’t trip.” Harry whispered. “Why don’t you want to tell me?”
Harry shook his head sadly and lifted his cup which had stopped glowing.
Their eyes met, Potter’s absorbent green eyes piercing into Draco’s with...what was that? Too much of their bodies were touching. From their thighs to part of their chests. Everything seemed quiet, at least to Draco who could only hear the pounding of his own heart at just how
Draco rolled his eyes, “the bloody hell is that-“ but he stopped when Harry wrapped it around himself. “Pity such an important item looks like McGonagall’s curtains.”
“What was your greatest regret?” Draco asked, alcohol making him cut through everyone, probably the most he’d spoken all night. Some people looked at him a bit odd, most of all Harry who looked at Draco quite...somberly. Harry reached up his hand and gently trailed his fingers down his own face, exactly where Draco’s scars were.
“You’re the one that wants this” Harry reminded him, really trying to restrain himself from just wrecking Draco right there. Or maybe on the door...
Draco rolled his eyes, “Merlin knows why. You looked like you had a dog on your head the entire year.”
Distantly, drunkenly Draco recalls Pansy taking her turn, maybe Dean went and suddenly everyone was looking at Draco.
, a proper kiss, slyly running his tongue over Potter’s lips as he went to pull back. Draco couldn’t tell you how long it lasted because it felt
“The boy-...but you’re famous-“
“What about you?” Draco asked, slightly scared at hearing the answer. “When could I have kissed you?”
Only he hadn’t seen Draco yet. Not that he had looked. He hadn’t. But as McGonagall’s lovely but also seemingly numbing speech, Harry found his eyes scanning up the long, 8
him. Part of him wanted Harry to just let him have it.
“I’ve had enough for the night.” Draco heard himself say, standing up...wait yes there he go, his body was lagging a bit, standing up. “Thank you all for included me, it’s certainly been...memorable.” Without waiting to see if Potter or anyone bid him goodnight, Draco simply walked away. Right through the door to the common room.
“I met some...fans of yours today.” Draco began, playing with Harry’s hand instead of continuing.
“Mate, you answered truthfully, you don’t have to drink” Blaise commented but Draco barely heard, too busy staring at Potter who was looking forlornly into his glass.
“Uhhh” he began, because which one was worse? Truth he could reveal too much but a dare could do just as much damage, maybe he should-
“Thanks-“
Harry broke off after a moment, kissing down Draco’s neck, “no marks, I know” before Draco could remind him. He traced down the scars on Draco’s chest with his mouth, eyes flicking up to check Draco’s face. Draco was just staring at him, hands still held int Harry’s hair. Maybe he felt safer, like he had control of the situation.
“Fuck me, Harry. Now.” Draco moaned, hating how Harry could yo-yo from caring to kinky in two seconds. “I want you in me” he added, satisfied when he felt Harry’s cock twitch in his hand.
“Ah, sucks. Well, see you soon. Oh and...Ginny’s looking for you.” Ron added, before there were foot steps and he was gone.
Draco was laughing too much for Barren to continue, the relief he felt overwhelming. This shithead knew nothing. “Sorry, sorry it’s just...have you talked to Harry lately? We’re friends, I’m not...I’m just trying to get through my last year of school.” Draco explained, trying to regain his composure.
“What? What do you want Draco?” Harry murmured in-between kisses.
. Suddenly there are hands on him, wet, blood soaked hands desperately trying to cover the cuts as though it would make him bleed less.
But eventually they did have to pull back. Draco did first, saying that they had both been gone for too long and people would draw conclusions.
Harry had accounted for hatred, for rolled eyes which there were a lot of, but what Harry hadn’t considered was the looks. Not of hatred, but of
Draco rolled his eyes, “you said kiss the person.”
, he thought distantly as he wrapped it around him, casting a heating charm on his feet and settled on his usual spot.
While Seamus and Dean set everything up, Harry poured everyone a drink, giving himself his own bottle and took a seat right across the circle from Draco. He accepted the glass from Harry-
“Twat” Harry countered smugly, as Draco pulled back. He stayed in Harry’s arms but wasn’t pressed against him anymore. “I’m sorry I triggered this, I was just trying to make sure you’re okay.”
“Harry. Considering your dick is about to be in my mouth, I think you can call me by my first name, Draco.” Harry smiled and before Draco even had time to computer what he had just said, Harry made good on his promise.
“He was not”
Harry looked about ready to kill him. “I’ll walk you back to our room, grab something from the Great Hall for us, yeah?” It wasn’t a question. Draco thanked Madam Pomfrey before crutching off.
“I hate my dad more than anything in the world.” Draco began suddenly, “he’s a repugnant, evil, homophobic man and I’m happy he’s sitting,
“I deserved them” Draco whispered, eyes flicking over to the ledge where Dumbledore had gone off.
Draco rolled his eyes, kissing him back. “No one’s done that for me...ever.”
“No, Malfoy, I’m pretty sure there is.”
Harry bit his lip, considering. “...fine. Okay. A week.”

huff a little,
But he had no time to dwell on the thought for Ron was requesting his presence quite enthusiastically.
Draco rolled his eyes, pushing Harry’s head down so he was level with Draco’s obvious erection. “Thank you for asking but Potter, I swear if you don’t fuck me soon I’ll do it myself.” He had almost said he’d reconsider Tommy’s offer but that seemed a bit too far.
, would say his name. Would keep the lights on. Would come back.
. His knees wobbled and he immediately leaned on his broom for support.
, they both thought, “caring about stupid things? Don’t you just want to say ‘fuck it’?”
“What year?”
morning, wasn’t it?
“I’ll break up with Ginny tomorrow, for good. And this week you’ll see that people won’t hate you.”
Potter” snapped Snape, not looking up from his work. Almost on autopilot, Harry obliged, trudging through the water that was starting to mix with blood through the door.
“Don’t I?” Draco smiled wistfully, and it caused Harry a new kind of pain.
with what he hoped was a look of nonchalance. “Didn’t think I’d see you” Harry commented quietly, with a smile.
As he took it out, Draco hesitated. This was, without a doubt, the brashest act ever performed with such a legendary item. Plus it was Harry’s father’s….Was this too far?
Draco had to look away from the earnestness in Harry’s eyes. “No...I just...it would be so much easier for you, if you just let me go.” He whispered, squeezing Harry’s hand. The hand squeezed back then tugged Draco into a hug, holding him tightly.
Potter had entered the room, slamming the door shut and quickly pressing Draco up against it, slotting his leg between Draco’s, causing both of them to moan at the contact. Draco wrapped his arms instinctively around Potter’s shoulders, pulling him close.
. He got up, slowly facing the mirror which reflected back smooth, untouched skin. With a wave of his hand, the scars were back, and Draco delicately ran his finger up them. He had truly failed at being a Malfoy. He just wished he knew if he stilled cared that he did.
Draco wanted to scream but instead he settled for, “What kind of reason is that?”
“You’ve worn socks, Draco.”
. Since he was shoved by that Gryffindor brat.
. He had the fucking nerve to

, ginger and Granger started walking away from Draco, and Harry coming right his way.
“First one’s at eleven..? Draco, eighth years have the same classes. Pretty much.”
As the professor droned on and
Draco proceeded as slowly, and quietly as possible. Thank Merlin Little Weasel wasn’t there. With each step, Draco felt Harry inadvertently press into him and it put him on edge in more way than one. He almost scolded Potter but then realized that would be immeasurably dumb so he bit his tongue instead.
So taking a deep breath, and looking intensely at the ceiling, Draco grabbed onto the table and pulled himself up. Even without putting pressure on it, his ankle ached. He gently, put it down, audibly groaned in pain and quickly picked it back up. Broom it is then.
“As you’ve decided to show your rat face here” Barren sniffed taking a step forward, “I thought we should introduce ourselves to you.” The taunting edge being burned away by something much darker. Barren was Draco’s height, but definitely more buff than Draco.
“Well- yeah but...I do care about her I just...not romantically. I don’t think.” Harry whispered, starting to squirm. “We’ve, uh slept together and everything but I didn’t really...I hated it. Draco I...FUCK” Harry yelled into the open air in front of them. He stood up, spreading his arms, taking a deep breath and screaming, “FUUUUUCK! FUCK IT!!”
The two stood and faced each other, Harry’s hand twitching for his wand but stopped when he saw Malfoy just standing there, just smiling sadly, one corner of his mouth hitched up almost painfully. The silence seemed to last years, each taking the other in before Malfoy finally spoke.
“Draco”, Harry greeted, his eyes tracing over Draco’s arms, up his chest, and resting on the black ribbon choker.
Harry watched, trying to process everything Draco just said but was even more confused when, very quickly, Draco turned around and kissed him.
Draco leaned over slightly, looking at the daunting drop- he shuddered, the memory of that horrible night with Dumbledore and his own plummet from this spot flashing through him.
Harry kissed the top of Draco’s wet hair, and they both took a breath. The gentle pattering of the water and their breath filled the room. “Two breakdowns in one hour. What an eventful day.”
“Right, Ron. You’re going first then.”
That made everyone’s eyes widen. Did he say that out loud? Guess he did. Not like it was a massive secret anyway. People probably had suspicions.
. Draco then felt himself being lifted upward by strong hands underneath his thighs. Instinctively, Draco wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist. Both groaned as their crotches ground against the other, desperate for friction.
Draco moaned, aroused beyond cognition as he felt himself be surrounded by Harry. Harry thrust into him hard, again and again. “I’m gonna-“ Draco whimpered, but cut himself off as Harry buried himself deep in Draco, who came on Harry’s name. Draco felt himself clench around Harry, his stomach tight, and his vision blur. The hot pulse in him as Harry came only spurred Draco on more.
Because Draco’s done casual sex. He’s done empty classroom, spell prep, sex and it serves its purpose. But it’s always been dark. Quick. Wordless. Not about who but the act.
“Merlin Harry” Draco moaned, grateful he had the thought to put the silencing charms up. The sight of Harry’s fingers disappearing between his legs was almost too much. The fingers were a lot, but not nearly enough at the same time. He reached down, wrapping his long fingers around Harry’s length, stroking it. Harry moaned, stopping their kiss as he fought to regain to control over his breathing. Draco kept stroking lightly, relishing the feeling of Harry’s fingers fucking into him.
“Not afraid an ex-Death Eater is going to kill the Chosen One in his sleep-“
Draco regarded him for a long time, Harry felt like he was being scanned by a laser, before finally looking away. “I chose the right side. You can have the window” and with that he stood up, crossing the room to the curtained off section where Harry assumed his bed was.
“Big fans.”
Too much but not enough. “
Harry leaned in, pressing hot kisses against Draco’s pale neck. He licked the spot where he could feel Draco’s pulse, nipping at it again and again while his hands untucked Draco’s shirt from his pants. His teeth grazed over the black ribbon that adorned Draco’s neck and Potter groaned, tugging at it with his teeth.
This was news to both Harry and Draco. Time flew when you’re having your ankle repaired and almost having sex with your secret boyfriend apparently.
After...however long they were at it, Draco couldn’t exactly tell, they stepped back. Draco still had his hand on Harry’s shoulder, Harry’s hand still lay almost protectively on the small on Draco’s back. It was like a new canvas had been presented in front them. Harry’s motto of ‘fuck it’ suddenly seemed very possible, practical even. Maybe that was why Draco’s hand, resting on Harry’s shoulder slowly traveled to his neck, feeling the soft skin there, his fingers winding through Harry’s raven’s nest of hair.
“No” Harry responded instantly.
“What” Harry asked immediately, the evident hurt like a bucket of cold water to Draco.
“Waiting to finish the job?” Malfoy’s soft voice, empty of malice, finally spoke.
Draco nodded, realizing he had never thought of Potter’s scar as...well as scar. It was always this mark of glory. “I guess you do.” He whispered back.
“I’m not a barbarian-“
. Potter was
Eventually, after a few more thrusts and heavy breathing, both came down. Draco looked up and saw Harry, beautiful, handsome Harry smile down at him. He was sweaty and disgusting but Draco had never felt more attracted to him. Harry leaned down, kissing a dazed Draco sweetly as he pulled out.
to get himself off like this. He wondered how far he could push it.
Immediately, Draco wrapped himself around Harry. He’d seen Draco after they’d fucked last night but this was a new Draco, this was a fucked out Draco and it was one the most endearing things Harry had ever seen.
Draco’s hand gripped the sheets, propping himself back up to watch Harry as he kneeled down again. He placed his wonderfully large hands around the top of Draco’s thighs and tugged him down, spreading his legs. Harry, looking so focused it wasn’t fair how hot Draco found it, licked around Draco’s entrance, muttered a lubrication spell against the incredibly sensitive skin there, then pressed in.
Harry shook his head, finally meeting Draco’s eyes and they both felt a little more weighed down from it. “No...” he answered truthfully.
“I know, love” Harry insisted, quietly. “Well, I know that now. I was a bit...dense.”
It definitely wasn’t the full 8
“I’m a bit tired. Had a long,
“She’ll know-“
, green eyes fucking gleaming. Well, two could play at that game. Fake it till you make it, right?
“This mortal earth above you?” Potter teased.
Harry was sat on his bed, his elbows rested on his knees and head down so Draco couldn’t see his face. Draco’s fingers played with the ring on his finger, debating whether to go and comfort Potter and how he would ever go about that. A pat on the back seemed condescending but he couldn’t just do
almost that boiled underneath the surface of his face almost like he was sunburn from jealousy. His gut felt like there was a black void in it, his vision seeming to be laser focused on what was immediately in front of him, just enough to navigate with the rest of his focus replaying Weasel kissing Harry.
called me your boyfriend” Harry exclaimed, mock offense evident in his voice. But he leaned down, crashing their lips together fervently anyway. Draco moaned, slotting his leg in-between Harry’s and rubbing at his crotch. Harry immediately ground down, lowering his hips so they collided more nicely with Draco’s. Their hips rocked together, not too urgent, more languid. Celebrating their small repose from the day. Even if it was only a little after noon.
“Oh.”
Harry glowered down at Barren daring him to get up. “Have you gone mental? What are you?  A Death Eater now-“
As Harry stood there, hugging the man who he cared so much for, he played the conversation he had to have with Ginny in his mind. And of course to walk around the castle as the Chosen One, the castle where he lost so much.
Draco shook his head, “but Weasel-“
“Break the bloody door down, Harry, I don’t care just
“Touche.”
“If you’re lucky.” Draco answered, but the right corner of his lips curved up so Harry assumed that meant yes. Not that the Great Hall was exactly romantic, but just being around Draco put Harry at ease. He knew Draco was safe there.
Draco rolled his eyes, pretending that his stomach didn’t flutter. “Indeed.”
Draco just collapsed into Potter’s embrace, the last three years, his life really, the cost of it slowly breaking out of him. Through tears or sob, Draco couldn’t fight back, clinging onto the Potter, who held him tightly, refusing to let him go.
Potter was. A flick of his eyes and he thought he was Potter’s gaze flick over his face.
“You tripped. And did
“If you want.” Draco whispered, watching carefully for any reaction from Harry. When there wasn’t an immediate response, Draco almost began to panic. What was he
way that Harry couldn’t help but reach down and frame Draco’s face with his hands.
“Surprised you actually know my name” Harry shot back after a while, stepping into the room.
Well, fuck. Draco’s only choice was to put his right leg over Potter’s right arm and suddenly Draco felt a horrifically noticeable blush paint his face because his crotch was suddenly
. Protect Draco at all costs.
“Morning Draco.”
Harry had arrived in the Great Hall, along with the rest of Gryffindor, relatively early so didn’t immediately worry when he didn’t see Draco. The other houses piled in, taking their seats. The 8
“Calm down Ronald” she scolded, right before Draco sighed, “I’m gay pretty sure you’re safe.”
Sure, there was no one around but still!
Fuck. Fuck
“We’re not first years” Granger pointed out. “No, we’re consenting adults who want to have fun” Dean countered, placing an empty fire whiskey bottle on the floor. “Everyone set? Great. Ron, you’ve so graciously volunteered to go first...take it away.”
“How did you- that’s incredible.” Harry gasped, running his fingers delicately over his knuckles.
“We need single friends, Hermione,” Draco told her.
Hello, my dear readers! Here I am, back with the next chapter! Not much to say this time, so I'll just send you off your way to read! Enjoy :)
Hello, my dear readers! I'm back with the first proper conversation between Draco and Arthur! I've been dying to write this scene from the moment I decided to start this story, and I have been working on this scene on and off all week. I hope you'll like how it turned out :D
Hello, my dear readers! I know it's been a while, but I'm finally back with the first appearance of the Golden Trio! The scene wasn't easy to write, and it gave me (and Merlin) quite a few grey hairs, but I hope you'll enjoy it! :D
Harry snorted, shaking his head, and they exchanged a grin before Harry turned to their friends. “Why, hello,” he said, loudly and with fake cheerfulness. “So nice to see you again.”
Draco is still extremely cold throughout but feels warmer towards the end - if he's really warmer physically or if it's just his emotional perception is up for your interpretation. Fact is that Harry and Draco haven't been physically intimate for months and the return to that makes Draco feel safe in terms of their relationship. He needs the physical proof of Harry's feelings as much as the words to believe them.

“Made you look,” Ryan winked, and Abbas shot daggers at him from next to his boyfriend. Demelza giggled.
“Right…” Draco said slowly before turning back to Ryan, who was grinning at him, raising an eyebrow.
“You would think so,” Zoe grinned, wiggling her eyebrows. “You can’t go an hour without molesting your girlfriend.”

I'm almost certain she actually does, lol ^_^
I tried the teeny amount of Spanish I knew, "Lo siento Mijo, hablo un pocito de espanol. Hablo ingles."
I'm so happy that you managed to get us back in Lainie's good graces. I swear I didn't mean to embarrass her. Good thing you never told her that you tried Legilimency on her, she may have never forgiven us! She seems really happy to be going to Russia, but did you manage to talk to her about New Year's? Again, it doesn't really matter one way or the other, I'd just like to know if I should be planning on her and/or Kisa to join us or if we'll be getting them back a day or two later. You know how much Tabitha likes to keep things organized on my schedule!
5 new Kids from the vigilante rescue
It's just so YOU. It's like your annual gift to me. I can't believe you think it's not romantic! Besides our family, there is nothing more important to me than helping children feel safe and happy, and you give that to me every year. You give it to me pretty much every day anyway, but this annual extra push is wonderful. I know you, and you'd prefer to buy me something big, extravagant, and flashy. It's who you are. And instead you give such a silent and thoughtful gift because you know how much it means to me. What could be more romantic than that?
"This made the boy frown in confusion. 'But mum said you're not allowed to see me anymore.' His father shrugged. 'And that's true, but she needs help and I am perfectly capable of taking care of you until she feels right as rain again.' This apparently satisfied Liam, because he simply smiled and said: 'Alright!' Smiling, his father wasted no time in putting him in the backseat of his blue and white car and driving off."
Giving him something he can feel,
I have nothing if I don't have you (two),
I'm rather looking forward to watching the programme!
I swear, one of these days I think you and I should get shirts made that say: "Not a tour group we just have an extensive child collection."
"Look, it's like I said, I don't want anything from you! I JUST want a child, and you are the ONLY person I feel has a brain cell in their body worth passing on!"
You tossed a photo across the table at him with a little charm to make it fly into his hand. "Photographic evidence. I'm actually rather impressed. How *do* you do that?"
I do hope 10:30 isn't too early for you. I know last night was not a good night's sleep. I really wish you could talk to me about these dreams of yours. What are you afraid of? Do you think I am going to figure out a cause to your nightmares and go rushing off half-cocked like an impetuous Gryffindor to save and avenge my man?
But as I was saying, Harry, you are always gorgeous. Oliver, I haven't had the pleasure of seeing you hold more than a few babies, and honestly, you are breathtaking when you hold a baby. You always have this look of pure love and longing on your face when you hold a baby, and I feel that it's probably a very good thing that we're almost certain to be overrun with grandchildren in the next few years, because that means you'll never have a shortage of babies to hold.
Despite the shock, it really was a great class. I know our kids are amazing, and our nieces and nephews, but I think I had this idea that our worldly children who care about things outside of quidditch and friends and drinking games were the exception not the rule. I was pleasantly surprised at how insightful these young men and women are. I'm really even more excited about full-time teaching next year than I was earlier in the week.
He prudently cast a locking spell on the door before stripping off and getting on the bed. When he was ready, I summoned my bag of goodies.
Harry is leaving for his book tour and while Draco wants him to go be awesome, he doesn't want him to be gone so long.

The last thing I gave her - aside from another kiss on the cheek - just before I pulled free from her grasp and Apparated away with Oliver, was a business card for a different squib contact, who just so happened to be a muggle version of a Mind Healer.
I grinned. "Wait until you catch Harry on a jealous day! Simply LOOKING with interest at a person can provoke him into bursting into flames and destroying the whole world, and I LOVE watching him do it!"
Harry
Love you so much,
Love,
I wandered around for a few minutes trying to remember what I needed to get dressed for, having stripped off before even getting in the closet, so I was completely naked. Aside from my tattoos. I felt like dancing, and started to wonder if I could still bellydance with this enormous bump protruding a mile out from my abdomen.
But anyway, as I was saying, I had Morgana in her carrier and I was signing everything I was saying. Next to me was Jaz - who plans to return home in a couple of minutes - and she was also signing and saying things like: "I miss you daddy, I hope Zaire and the others aren't moping without me, give the babies kisses from me."

"Ah, so he's hoping that I'll pass on the skill in far less time," I murmured in understanding. "As if I can somehow magically just GIVE you the skill and have you be good at it with no practice."

Harry! I just came up with a brilliant idea!
Draco
I loved the ceremony, I loved watching our family get ready all together, seeing the two of you coming down each of your aisles was a dream come true, but I would have to say the dancing was by far my favorite part of the entire day. I danced with my new husbands separately, and the three of us even managed to sway and dance all together for quite a few dances.
Yours Always,
"I'm only going to be the Flying Instructor and Quidditch Referee (plus occasional coach as necessary), and so, I won't need to stay in the school quite as much. I'll be able to pop back here and check on them each day," Oliver promised as I tucked his hand in the crook of my arm and prepared to Apparate us home. We both paused our conversation until after the Apparation was complete, but then continued on, walking toward the stables as we talked.
That's when I discovered that Miles apparently took his newfound freedom to heart. He isn't required to go to Traditions like the rest of the kids are - although he is welcome to join Antonio in magic classes with the teacher you've hired to help Antonio catch up to Hogwarts level - if he'd like - but since the two students are at vastly different levels, working together is honestly more beneficial to Antonio than it is to Miles. So, they've worked out an arrangement in which Antonio has morning classes with her, and Miles has afternoon ones.
IT'S A PUPPY PLAYDATE!!!
That was all the confirmation I needed. Rather than hunt for an intruder on an island full of excellent hiding places, I called for Dibly to find the intruder and bring him to me. Well, the magic of house elves allowed him to know where the bloke was the moment I made the order, and so, I had him on his knees before me in mere seconds. He was screaming in terror at Dibly and I had naturally incarcerated him first thing.
"So... as much as I am utterly LOVING being used as nothing more important than the furniture, I realized something shocking."
Harry,
"YEAH, WE'LL FUCK YOU, DRACO!!! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH THAT THE THOUGHT THAT YOU ARE PULLING AWAY FROM US HAS ME SICK TO MY STOMACH!!!"

And oh! That explains why he always looked like he *wanted* to say something but didn't. I'm dead certain that Yesenia will have to work on talking with him, but that might actually have to wait until Mrs. Litwin makes it clear that Antonio is allowed to talk as much as he wants now. I have a feeling that it will be a long road to recovery for both of them.
Strangely, I was in the mood for parts of the time, but when you tried to touch me, I... wasn't. I have no idea why. That triggered more mumbling against your shoulder and you rubbing my back. I want to want you. I REALLY want to want you. I even managed to push whatever BS is making me be weird about this to the back of my mind and pull you on top of me so that you could have me.
I noticed Viona standing off to the side of him, closely inspecting our wall of photos. "Sweet Merlin Viona! Is THAT what you really plan to wear?!"
And even with that long list of our beloved children, that's not all the people we have in our lives. Our Godchildren, our nieces and nephews, our bonus children and the bonus grandchildren they've given us. My own Godfather back from beyond, his beautiful babies, and their mothers who we literally would not survive without. Draco, your own Godfather being as much a part of your life as he can from his portrait and your brother who may as well be a clone. Our siblings. Our good friends. Our circle.
He snorted in amusement. "How could I forget?!"
The only other thing I wanted to mention before signing off is that while I was out shopping on one of the main islands last night with our Divas, two things happened. First, my friends the police spotted me, and apparently since I make quite the impression, they remembered me from five years ago, and came over to chat with me. It seems that they DID eventually solve the case of the boy in the box by finding the woman who more or less murdered him. She's now in prison and her daughter has been placed in a safe home. So… Justice served.
"Go on then," you bade. "The sooner you leave, the sooner you'll get back." And with that, you gave me a last kiss and pushed me toward the floo.
Or actually, now that I think about it, it's likely there will be four of you. Jaz is never very far away from her cousin-shaped shadow is she?
Harry
Frustrated that he hadn't harmed so much as a hair on my head, he eventually grumbled the question I've been waiting for. "This is useless! Why the bloody hell do we have to learn this?!"
Concerning trying again; do you actually want to try again soon? When we got Viona and thought we were both pregnant, you panicked a bit and started questioning whether we were ready or whether I would regret it. Was that you trying not to get your hopes up? Or were you actually overwhelmed? I will 100% support you in whatever you do, I’m just wondering if now that you know all of our family’s circumstances you’d rather wait a bit since we now have the option.
"Yes, I did know that," father murmured softly, stroking Sebastian's hair. "I was just on my way to the owlry. Do you want to come hunting with me?"
Harry
P.S. Not entirely sure why, but David Bowie was HOT!!! Mmm... And... isn't he the bloke from Labyrinth? Nice!
“And I’m not ashamed of that,” Ryan shrugged. Ginny shook her head, laughing.
Draco squeezed his knee under the table. He knew that Harry was unhappy with his career choice and they were currently brainstorming on how to change that. Weasley had quit only a few months in, deciding on working with the twins at the shop instead - they had opened up more branches and needed the support. Harry, too, considered just throwing the towel, but he didn’t want to do it without a Plan B. They’d written pages and pages back and forth on their enchanted parchment, and some half-cooked ideas were there - working in education in some way, for the most part, the way he had done with the DA, though how that was supposed to look like, none of them really knew yet. Draco had suggested talking to Kingsley and McGonagall, but Harry was still dragging his feet.

This chapter is taking off where the last one stopped. I hope you'll enjoy it and that it lets you escape for a while :)
Enough talk! Enjoy :)
Hello, my dear readers! I know, it's been a while since I updated this story. I apologise. I haven't forgotten about it, I guess I just needed a bit of a break. I'm back with a small chapter. I know it's just two small scenes between our two favourite couples, but I do hope it will tie you over before shit really goes down. Thanks for your patience with me, and I hope the next chapter will be a bit quicker.
Hello, my dear readers! So, I'm back with the next chapter, the final battle and the last chapter containing actual canon plot! I hope you enjoy what I did with it. Please prepare tissues, I have a feeling some of you may be needing them. Also, warnings for detailed description of grief, shock and traumatic events.
... And so the final battle begins. I hope you are ready for the ride, my loyal readers :)
Now, enough of my rambling and on to the epilogue. Please also check out the End Notes for information about future content in this series.
“So, how is work as an Auror Trainee?” Neville asked, with open interest. “Is it as exciting as everyone says?”
And if he was being honest... when had any of them ever really listened to him? He was there, sure, handy in his skills and intellect, but when it came to making decisions, his input was constantly ignored. He had never been as important as Weasley or Hermione, even if Harry had always denied that sentiment. He was there, but he was not
... What can I say? I apologise in advance.
Also, this particular chapter is from Ron's POV and deals with his relationship to Draco. I struggled a bit with it but I hope it's interesting to read :)
“I know we tease you, but I do feel bad for you, mate,” Ryan frowned. “Two months without love from your man. That’s rough.”
“Merlin,” Harry moaned. “It’s been too. Bloody. Long.” He punctuated each word with a nip to Draco’s throat, making him moan.
Hello, my dear readers!
Hello, my dear readers! Happy new year! Let's hope it will be a better one than the last!
for further details.
“They wouldn’t forgive us,” Harry pointed out. “Though I feel more partial to the idea each time you mention it.”
Killian: homosexual (male - he/him)
Enjoy!!
twice, Draco thought. “It was nice seeing you and all, but we have some catching up to do.”
I hope you are all safe and holding on! I am back with the new chapter - part 2 of the wedding, and everything that follows in its direct wake. I hope you'll enjoy it!!
Hello, my dear readers! I'm back with another chapter and the continuation of the Horcrux-Harry problem! I hope you'll enjoy Merlin's solution to it :D
happy Easter! Hope you're all having a nice holiday, despite everything that's going on in the world right now! As a little Easter Egg from me, here's an update :D Hope you'll enjoy this chaotic nonsense X'D
“Yurika,” Draco said loudly, making the other girl look up at him from the opposite side of the table, her expression a bit like a unicorn caught at wandpoint. Luna kept braiding her hair, completely unperturbed. “You’re taking Ancient Runes with us. Please help Hermione out with her translation.”
Hello, my dear readers!
Harry and Weasley looked over when the door opened, and they broke into wide smiles when they spotted Draco and Hermione. Weasley was the first on his feet, barrelling past Draco to lift his girlfriend off his feet and into a bone-crushing hug. Draco rolled his eyes at Harry but laughed when Harry’s arms came around him just as tightly, hugging him as if he was going to disappear.
Hermione tried to pretend that she wasn’t listening, but her face had flushed almost to the colour of her Gryffindor tie.
Hello, my dear readers! I'm back with the new chapter, and I hope you'll enjoy it! It's intense, though. I hope you have tissues nearby.
“Yeah, not for me,” Ryan widened his eyes. “I hate paperwork.”
I'm back with the second part of this story! I was so thrilled by all the positive responses for the first snippet! Thank you so much for all the lovely responses! I do hope you like this one just as much! This time, I'm exploring Merlin's POV.
Now, regarding future material to this story. As promised, I have been working on some things. It is not going to be a full-fledged sequel with a chronological timeline from Harry's POV as I'd originally considered, though. There are various reasons for that, but the most important is that it would be too repetitive. Instead, I'm going to post random scenes as Bonus Material (not in chronological order) - some will be scenes from their future and some from their past or the timeline we already know from Harry's POV or someone else's. I have so far written 5 Chapters of Bonus Material + 1 long-ass two-chapter fic from Ginny's POV. So you have still quite some content to look forward to :) For now, I will keep up the 2 week-rhythm, but once I run out of chapters to post, I'll just post whenever I have something finished. The Poll I have set up a while ago will stay up for me as an inspiration board and for you to send in ideas if you want to.
Summary of the torture scene: Bellatrix, convinced that Draco and the others have stolen the sword from her vault at Gringotts, tortures Draco with the Cruciato Curse to get information out of him. Lucius tries to stop her, if only verbally, but she stuns him to silence him. When he insists that they found the sword and were never in their vault to begin with, she calls up Griphook, the goblin, to confirm whether or not the sword is authentic. Griphook lies and says it's a fake. Relieved, Bellatrix turns her attention back to Draco and tries to extract a confirmation from him that "the boy desperately calling his name" down there is in fact Harry. Draco refuses to give him away and Bellatrix returns to torturing the truth out of him. That's when Harry & Co burst in.
here I am, back with the new chapter! I hope you'll enjoy the path this is taking :)
For now, though, an appointment of mine got cancelled today, leaving me with an opening and a thirst to write this scene. So here we are :D
Harry took a sip of his beer, seeming to choose his words carefully. “The fieldwork is, if I get any,” Harry allowed. “It’s also very… emotionally straining, though? More than I thought. And the paperwork is just plain boring.”
Overview of everyone's sexualities (+ gender identities / pronouns):
Dear readers,
WARNINGS: PTSD
This is a concept I've been playing around with for a long time, since a lot of you have been sad about Harry not going to the Yule Ball with Draco or Draco not being in the lake in the Second Task. I hope this gives you some closure for those missed opportunities :)
“I just want you to look over that last paragraph!” Hermione pleaded. “I’m not sure if I translated that section right, and I wanted to ask you whether -”
welcome to the post-war section of this story :) Thank you to all the readers who've made it this far! I hope you'll enjoy this part as much as the rest of the story.
“Aaaaand we lost them,” Draco heard Ryan say, somewhere in the background.
Warning: This chapter contains a therapy session with references to fear of loss, self-worth issues and past abuse and the effects of such. I tried my best to handle these subjects delicately, but please remember that I'm no therapist myself.
Yurika’s eyes narrowed. Her expression told Draco that she hated him very much indeed, but Draco didn’t care, because Hermione took the bait and Draco was blessedly free to enjoy his eggs and toast.
Hello, my dear readers! Back with a new snippet, and finally, the first mention of Harry (though not yet his first appearance, though I promise he will turn up very soon). I'm sorry it took so long to get there. Too much plot to get through beforehand. You know how it is ;) Anyway, I hope you'll enjoy this!!
Hello, my dear readers! I hope you're still healthy and that you're still holding on, whether you're in isolation or out there working!!
“It’s not like you and Harry ever kept it in your pants in front of us,” Ginny noted. “So stop lamenting.”
Hello, my dear readers! Here I am, back with the next chapter! I'm not going to say much here, I think it's better to just let you read. Enjoy!
Hello, my dear readers! I'm back with the next part of the final battle. Please note that there will be Canon Character Deaths in this chapter.
The third issue I want to address is my twitter account. I got in a bit of a quarrel and had to lock my account because I was afraid people might try to have me suspended or something. My backup account is still open. If you want to follow me, please message me via @IntoBlondPrats2 and tell me who you are, just so I know that you're actually a reader and don't mean me harm. Then, I'll let you follow me under my real account. I'm very sorry for the hoops I'm letting you jump through - I know it might scare some people away, but I had an account suspended before, and I don't want to go through the hassle again. Plus, I'm sort of tired of being attacked. So for now, the account stays locked. Maybe it will be opened again at some point. We will see.
For those who skipped the Sex Scene: Harry and Draco flipped their usual dynamics in bed, causing Harry to show how much he trusted Draco. Their usual banter returned and Draco started to feel more natural around Harry again.
Ryan: bisexual (male - he/him)
(See the end of the chapter for
“Who are not here,” Draco reminded her.
He leaned in to kiss Harry again, and Harry melted into the kiss.
This chapter is a short one, but I hope you'll enjoy it!! Please stay safe.
“I missed you, too,” Draco sighed, taking a deep breath to inhale his familiar scent and sinking into his arms.
Draco sighed. “Is it too late to elope?” he asked.
Many thanks to LunartheDragon, who helped look over the chapter and helped me feel more confident about the tricky sections. In general, she's been a treasure, helping me out and looking over scenes whenever I felt insecure whether the wording was appropriate. Thank you so much, dear! Your help was invaluable!
A word of warning: As you have probably already figured out, this chapter contains physical torture. If you want to skip that part, I will mark the beginnings and end of it with ***pt*** and ***/pt/***. I will put a short summary of what happened in the endnotes.
this is not an actual update, but an informational post with some things that I'd like to put out here. Don't worry, it's not too serious.
So, yes, I decided against it. I'm sure some of you might not like it, but I don't regret it, and my reasons for it stand. I hope you can understand that.
Dear readers,
Meanwhile, I am back with the new chapter and a much-needed therapy session for the boys. I hope you enjoy it! Please remember that I'm no therapist, but all the sessions in this fic were written through my own experience with therapy (single, not couple). Anything that seems unprofessional is naturally on me.
it with complete abandon. When Harry finally pulled away, allowing Draco to draw a shaky breath, the world was spinning for a few instances and he had to cling onto the other boy for support - not that it made any difference, since Harry seemed in no rush to let him go.
Draco looked up at Hermione from his breakfast, glancing at the roll of parchment she was shoving at him with little enthusiasm.
I'm quite happy with how this chapter turned out, even though it's pretty angsty. We're starting to get into the thick of it now. I hope you're going to enjoy it!!
“See you next Hogsmeade trip, stranger,” Ryan teased, and Harry flipped him the bird, which made Ryan cackle. Then, he took Draco’s hand and pulled him out of his chair.
Please note: There is a sex scene in this chapter. If you want to skip it, just look out for the markings ***e*** at the beginning and ***/e/*** at the end.
As soon as the door to their room was closed behind them, Harry pulled Draco against him, meeting his lips in a hungry kiss. Draco returned it eagerly, letting Harry push him up against the wooden door, their bodies pressing together.
“I know,” Draco sighed. “But we’re almost there. Past half-time. It’s Easter Holidays soon, and then there'll be the NEWTS, and then I’m done.”
“Hermione,” he sighed. “You know I love you, but can we please have one meal without talking about our homework?”
Abbas: demisexual (male - he/him)
Hello, my dear readers! I'm sorry for the long silence. My schedule has been horrific in September and I had absolutely no energy to write on this story. It's only recently that this energy came back, and the outturn is this chapter. I hope you'll enjoy it :D
“Oh Merlin,” Draco rolled his eyes. “What are they planning now?”
The second is that I am afraid I might have to postpone the next update by a day. I am very sorry, especially seeing that it's such a cliffhanger. I have work appointments on the next 2 Saturdays and work through the week. I hope I can make it the Sunday in two weeks. If not, please have my apologies. You know the reason.
“Well, it’s hard for them to make plans when they can’t agree on a single thing,” Harry grinned ruefully. “It was like watching an accident happening right in front of you.”
Sex Scene: Harry and Draco have penetrative sex for the first time. Harry reveals that he had a sort of "sex talk" with Hermione in sixth year asking her for information on protective spells because "she reads" and he didn't want to look a fool in front of Draco. Draco sees Harry's scar from when the locket tried to drown him for the first time.
In case you want to skip either the suicide attempt scene or the sex scene, I took precautions. The beginning of the suicide attempt scene is marked with ###B###, the ending with ###E###. Just scroll until you find the marking, and it should be safe to read on (I hope). Same applies to the sex scene, only the marking is ***B*** for the beginning and ***E*** for the end (though this time, it's almost coincidental with the end of the chapter - I will keep the marking for future sex scenes, though). In the end notes, I put in relevant information for both scenes that you can scroll down to read so you don't miss out.
“What does it matter?” Ginny snorted, but she was smiling. “It’s not like they’re going to talk to any of us if they do.”
Viola: heterosexual (female - she/her)
As an answer to a concern a lot of you addressed in the comments: Snape didn't survive the attack because there was no one there to stop it in time. Nagini latched on to kill. In Draco's case, Harry was there to intervene, and then Hermione got them out of there in time to help Draco. If they hadn't, he would have surely died, you are right, but since they were so quick to react, his life could be saved.
(And yes, I know I technically don't have to explain myself, but ... well, experience shows that I do, so bear with me.)
Harry grinned and leaned in to kiss his cheek. “Honestly,” he whispered into his ear. “As long as you end up saying ‘I do’, I don’t care about the rest.”
Killian flushed and looked down at himself - only to find a Hufflepuff tie, the way he was supposed to. He tilted his head at Ryan in confusion.
Hermione: heterosexual (female - she/her)
“I could try poking them,” Luna offered.
“Arsehat,” Ryan repeated appreciatively. “You’re so creative.”
“I know,” Draco said, cupping Harry’s cheeks and smiling at him softly. “But we almost made it. And we’re going strong. Things are going good, right?”
Hello, my dear readers! Happy Christmas! (Yes, it still counts, it's the 2nd Christmas Day in Germany ;))
there, not in the ways that mattered.
Draco: homosexual (male - he/him)
“In the first hour,” Yurika pointed out.
Hello, my dear readers! It's update time again :D
So, we only have one more actual chapter left after this! The one after will already be the Epilogue! Wow, I can't believe we're almost done with the main arc. It feels surreal.
Harry: bisexual (male - he/him)
Hello, my dear readers! I'm back with the new chapter for this one, including lots of angst and plot and dramatic characters on all sides of the story ;) I hope you'll enjoy it! Also, yay me for updating the third week in a row. Please don't get used to this speed lmao. I am on a go for this story and have written quite a bit ahead on my way to work on the bus. I have another chapter on reserve. Everything after that depends on my energy level, as always ;)
“Oh, please,” Ryan scoffed. “At least I’m wearing my own clothes. Killian, mate, welcome to our house.”
“You have single friends!” Zoe puffed up. “There’s me and Carina, Neville, Viola, Yatin -”
PS: This fic has been updated fairly frequently until now, but please don't get used to it. I can't promise to keep the speed up :-X Hope you'll understand.
“Hello, my favourite band of misfits,” Ryan called as he and Ginny approached their corner of the Slytherin table, a goofy smile on his face. His hair and clothes looked ruffled, and both of them were suspiciously flushed.
Carina: heterosexual (female - she/her)
Hello, my dear readers! We're back for the next chapter, and we have a Horcrux to destroy! I really hope you'll enjoy this chapter! :)
Viktor: heterosexual (male - he/him)
Hello, my dear readers! I'm back with the next chapter and the events at Grimmauld Place. I have to admit, back when I wrote it, this sequence gave me a bit of trouble. I hope you'll enjoy it, despite the mess it was to write :)
Hello, my dear readers! I'm back with the new chapter and a surprise guest! Please enjoy :)
Hello, my dear readers!
Zoe: attracted to men (leaning towards nonbinary - they/them) - hard to categorise since they are still unsure about themselves
“True,” Ryan admitted. “Not made for a Ministry job.”
Hello, my dear readers! I hope you're still safe and holding on!! Meanwhile, I'm back with the new chapter and the first part of the wedding! I had to split the proceedings, seeing that the whole thing got out of my hand and turned out way too long. So I hope you'll enjoy the first part of it, because I really, really had a blast writing this bit of the story! :D
My dear readers,
Hello, my dear readers! I'm back with our famed bank heist! Not going to waste any time talking - hope you'll enjoy it! :)
“Tell yourself that,” Ryan patted his shoulder cheerfully, and Draco shot him a half-hearted glare.
Here I am, back with Part 2 of the battle! I'm not especially good with action scenes, so I hope this is satisfactory. Enjoy :)
“I think we’ll just have to figure out what we want and put our foot down,” Harry shrugged. “No way around it.”
Last official chapter! Only the epilogue left. Hope you'll enjoy this :)
“Are Harry and Ron meeting us at Hogsmeade later?” Carina asked, looking at Draco and Hermione over her glass of pumpkin juice.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Honestly,” Yurika muttered. “You could have at least taken the time to button up your shirt properly.”
Until then, please have a nice two weeks and stay safe!
(See the end of the chapter for
“You think they’re going to come up for air sometime in the next hour?” Neville asked, sounding worried. “I promised to meet Susan around twelve.”
Then, there were times when he’d hear Ryan wake from a nightmare. They’d sit together those nights, talking until either of them could fall back to sleep.
We've reached the most difficult chapter I have written yet for this story. Please be aware that this chapter contains a (magically induced) suicide attempt, the mental spiralling that leads up to it as well as some questionable aftercare and explicit scenes. If you find any of that triggering, please proceed carefully.
Weasley was still snogging Hermione’s face off in the background, not bothering.
“Don’t be mean,” Neville laughed. “Harry made an effort to talk at least for half an hour last time before he kidnapped Draco. That was double the time Ron invested. He only waved into the round, grabbed Hermione by the wrist and took off.”
Yurika: homoromantic asexual (female - she/her)
Harry whined but Draco just pressed another finger in. “Quiet” Draco snapped, his whispered transforming into more of a bite. After a few more moments of teasing, Draco removed his fingers from Harry’s mouth and wrapped that hand around Harry, keeping eye contact as he pumped him from base to tip.
Draco heard silence, but also some cheers. Well, that was a nice touch. When he turned the corner, out of the view from the Great Hall, he saw that Harry had followed up. Draco bit his lip, holding back a laugh. Harry was grinning like an idiot, though he was still tense as though he wanted to go back and break Barren’s ankles himself. Harry hurried towards him, walking right up to Draco and pulled him into a kiss.
Of course, that’s when Ron decided to join the table. He gave a curt nod to Malfoy who gave a coy smile back. It really did loads to ease Draco’s conscious that no matter what any of them thought about him, at end of the day none of them were being fucked by the Chosen One. Which sounded crude but body image had always been a
I wrote this as the original first scene to the 'sequel' when I was still planning to write a whole fic in chronological order from Harry's POV. As you can see, it would have been very repetitive, so I stopped after a couple of scenes. But instead of throwing them out, I decided to keep them in to post them here as bonus material.
“They are both going to be there,” Draco answered Carina’s question. “Though I’m not going to vouch for the amount of attention you’ll get from either of them. The last time I saw Harry face to face was January.”
See you in two weeks! Please don't yell at me too much.
Sorry for the purely informational post. I promise the next one will have content again. Love you and hope you have a great day!
This is the last chapter I have written out at the moment, which means from now on, I will cease posting in a two-week rhythm and post whenever I have something written out. I hope you understand :)
Happy reading!
“Right,” Harry nodded, smiling.
They made their way to the village in a large group after breakfast, which led to some delays in their speed. Five minutes in, Carina noticed that she’d forgotten her gold and the twins returned to the school, saying they’d catch up with them later. Luna stopped twice to look at plants. When they finally reached Hogsmeade, they went straight for the Three Broomsticks, and Draco was relieved to find their usual corner booths already occupied by two familiar faces.
I hope you'll enjoy this chapter as much as I enjoyed writing it! I really had a blast with this one. It has peeks into the Drarry wedding (and tons of others) and though I know you were probably hoping for an entire wedding chapter (which I don't have any plans of writing right now, I'm sorry), I hope this can tie you over.
For everyone who skipped the sex scene: Draco and Harry are able to connect emotionally through the physical intimacy, and Draco realises that it makes sense because they have always communicated well with physical touch. It's so overwhelming to Draco that he starts crying in the middle of the act, but he can't understand why.
was enveloped in Harry’s arms before he had even gotten his footing. It would have made him stumble if Harry’s grasp on him hadn’t been tight with desperation.

Four years ago, this story started out as a spontaneous idea that I sprung at a friend in a chat. She is a HP fan but she doesn't read my fics so her enthusiasm was limited. She humoured me and listened, though. So when I posted the epilogue, my expectations were rather low. The response was mindblowing, and it only grew from there. I never expected this fic to become so popular and it's still a miracle to me. I am grateful for every reader I have and so glad you all found something in this series to enjoy.
Hello, my dear readers! I'm back with the next chapter! Not gonna say much - enjoy :)
... And here we are :) I hope you enjoyed the epilogue, and that it was what you imagined! I know some of you wanted it to include the wedding but I'm afraid I just didn't feel that. It would have been too happy-go-lucky for everything they've been through. I thought this was a better closure.

Hello, my dear readers! Sorry for the long wait. Life has been crazy lately, and I haven't really gotten around to this story. Barely managed to squeeze in finishing this chapter today and throwing it out. As I said, updates here might be a little irregular in the future. Hope you understand. Anyway, I hope you enjoy this update :)
So, to head off the wave of criticism that I'm sure will be coming for this plot-decision: Yes, I considered having Draco realise Regulus' involvement earlier, and consciously decided against it. There are a few reasons for this decision. The most prominent are the following:
Last but not least, if you find this chapter triggering in any way, please don't hesitate to seek help from friends, family or call the suicide help hotline of your country. Here is a link with an international overview:
Hello, my dear readers! I'm sorry it took me so long to post this new chapter. I admit, I was a little stuck on how to finish this story, but my wonderful friend LunartheDragon sat down and brainstormed with me over the last couple of days, and now what has been a vague idea finally is taking concrete shape. I hope I'll be able to actually complete this story now. Thank you for your patience, and I hope you'll enjoy the last couple of chapters :D
“Is Potter happy?”
“Left foot red!”
Harry.”
When Harry reached Draco’s waist band he paused, fingers trailing along the edges. ”
Draco felt like there were thousands of words pressed against his chest, the points of the letters spiking into his chest. He opened his mouth and closed it, his hands shaking in Potter’s grasp. His control, his resolve, caught just like the breath was caught in his throat.
It had been five minutes, possibly five years, maybe even five seconds since Draco kissed Harry (
Harry froze, turning to Draco with such raw hurt in his eyes that Draco couldn’t help but feel guilty. He hadn’t meant it to hurt Harry, it was just true. Harry sat down next to Draco and took his hand.
Draco stepped forward, slowly, fully into Harry’s space and slowly ran a hand through his hair, resting it in those wild(ly soft) curls, the other hand traced Harry’s lips lightly with his thumb. Was Potter- no there’s no way Potter would be blushing at this. Satisfied, Draco shifted the hand on Harry’s lips to take purchase in his hair as well before he leaned forward, and just said
“You’ve decided, haven’t you.” She started, looking away from Harry’s gaze. Harry nodded, hands playing with his quidditch robe.
“From?”
Draco’s eyes widened, his mouth stilling, only for a moment before taking a shaking breath and continued. He reached back, widening his knees. He pulled off for a moment to mutter some spells but soon resumed his musings. Harry watched, transfixed as Draco reached behind him. After a moment his eyes fluttered.
Harry sighed, curling in on himself a little. Draco gently ran his hand over Harry’s chest, waiting patiently for him to speak. After a moment, Harry whispered, “when I walk around here...all I see are the people I couldn’t save.”
. They couldn’t last two days in secret, Harry was just too bloody righteous.
Dean explained as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. Which to be fair it was.
mouth lapping and sucking in such a precise, such a
“I’m not really the crowd’s thing” Draco responded, far to earnestly for Harry. It twisted something in him, an ache but also an anger.
“You’re deflecting again” Draco scolded, raising an eyebrow in return. “I’m not- I’m not trying to pry or compare battle scars or anything I’m just...you can talk to me, Harry. If we’re...if we’re gonna give this thing a proper go, I think talking to each other is..”
“Please,
Harry slowly lifted his hips, thighs trembling both with effort and arousal as he slowly fucked up into Draco. Merlin, he can’t believe this was happening. Draco felt himself leaking, warm arousal starting to overcome him.
“Goodnight, Harry.”
“Doesn’t Granger have an advantage? Being a muggle-born and all?” Pansy challenged, though there was no malice in her voice.
“Fine” sighed Draco and with another flick, the bottle spun again. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco swore he saw Harry flick his wand. Why was it in his hand? He was too busy looking at Harry and his slight murmuring until a chorus of “ooooooo”s broke him out. It had landed on Harry.
“I’m...it’s fine.” Draco stuttered, decidedly not used to anyone handling him with such care and affection.
“You’re feeling better then?”
looking approached Draco.
“I just mean that...what if this was just sexual. There’s been tension between us for years, yes you know there has, and we just needed a...release.”
Harry went to drape the cloak over them and Draco laughed. “That’s going to be a tight fit.”
“What..?”
“You can’t be with me, Potter. That’s not how this works.”
Oh the silence. The silence was
Harry lumbered up the steps, eyes wide when he saw Draco then Harry did the most ridiculous thing.
MERLIN” Draco gasped, feeling Harry’s other hand squeeze Draco’s ass
Draco nodded, pressing his face into Harry’s hands. “Someone’s a little jealous” Draco teased, wanting to see what would happen.
“Fine” Draco sighed, “okay.”
“Ginny.”
Barren was not laughing. He stepped even closer so Draco could only smell his repugnant breath. “You may have him fooled, but I know a rat when I see one. Even with your fancy toys-“ Barren reached for Draco’s broom. Instinctively, Draco grabbed his wrist. The broom was the last thing his father had given to him before being locked away in Azkaban, nothing must happen to it. Barren sneered, as if waiting for Draco to fight back, and with one big hand against Draco’s chest, shoved him onto the ground. Draco’s wrists cracking with catching his swift fall and his head banging hard on the floor.
“You know, any criminal activity.” Then, as if on cue, the two followers grabbed Draco’s left arm and forced his sleeve up. Of course, there was nothing except skin to show but this only annoyed Barren further. “You cowa-“
“Show’s over.” Draco spat to the crowd, whipping his robe dramatically. He had an image to uphold after all. As they walked Draco almost felt physically burnt by the rage steaming off of Harry. Checking no one was around, Draco gently grabbed Harry’s right hand wincing when he saw the brusing.
. Potter will ask him to leave to...be with Ginny. He’ll be sexiled. He’ll have to sleep next to Potter, the man he just made out with. The man he was in l-
“One day and I’m already tired of this sneaking around” Draco confessed quietly into Harry’s lips.
Draco gave Potter what was hopefully a smirk, and sat down, legs almost betraying him. Potter just stared at him, grinning a little, like he was in on a secret while everyone wolf whistled.
“Spin the bottle!”
Draco’s eyes were already shut, a smile still on his lips.
gorgeous. I’m interested in messy, unkept, exciting, rough, real love. And-and I’m not saying that- I know we’re just starting off but to...give you an idea, that’s what I need. And I think that’s what you need to.”
These images swirled in Harry’s mind over and over as he stood in wait outside the bathroom, having quickly retrieved his invisibility cloak. It had been over an hour, though it felt like five years, when he finally heard footsteps.
it was.
Potter shook his head, “I was just Harry Potter. Runt whose parents died in a car crash.”
“Yeah! On the
“Potter” Draco smirked, raising his cup and taking a long sip.
. After what was probably just a few seconds but felt like a life time, Draco crossed to Harry and sat next to him on the bed with a few respectable inches between them.
“But we-“
“Bullocks. I would have fucked you, not rimmed you, you utter twat.” Harry dismissed, the humor returning to his features. “Draco, I know you’re looking for an escape plan here, and if I thought you didn’t feel the same way I feel about you, I would respect that but I really, really don’t think it’s the case. Is it?”
“Get up here” Harry whispered, placing his hands on Draco’s waist and pulled him until Draco straddled him. He looked so good up there, Harry had to work not to come on the spot.
“Harry...” Draco began gently, feeling Harry slip his finger out of Draco, mourning the loss of Harry as he stepped back. Draco removed his hands from Harry’s pants, grabbing onto his wrist harshly.
, but not the usual way a suit made him look. He looked expensive because of the detail. Captivating everyone’s eyes with a tauntingly sheer fabric. Not see through so as to still be school appropriate, but definitely transparent enough to activate Harry’s imagination. And Merlin that
Draco gave in at first, the adrenaline rush pushing him into Harry’s arms. After a moment he pushed Harry off, looking around but thankfully no one saw. “Bedroom” Draco whispered, turning and walking away. Harry followed swiftly after, all sorts of conflicting emotions swimming in him.
Draco leaned in, letting his warm breath whisp down Harry’s neck before slowly pressing wet, open mouthed kisses. He purposefully aimed for the love marks that darkened Harry’s neck from last night. They had been glamoured as to avoid attention but were now visible even in the dim light.
“I thought it’d be a little, if ever, until we had...that conversation.”
“Okay Granger, your turn then.” Pansy called, giving Ron a good pat on the head. “Truth or dare?”
What Draco
“Yeah but-...did you know it might not have even been about me? It could have been Neville.”
how his words affected Harry. Around them they could hear the sounds of students chatting, of rushed footsteps and lazy seventh years. So much sounds but
“This is a fracture Mr. Malfoy. A fracture can only be made by external force.”
have been...of course.”
After a moment, or many Draco didn’t know he was too caught in the growing pleasure that make his muscle taunt with desire and he sound of Harry’s muffled moans mixed with his louder ones. After a moment or many of that, Harry broke off, right when Draco was getting ready to warn Harry he was getting close.
Draco just shrugged, his hand absentmindedly rubbing his chest. “It was a nightly routine for a while. Can’t do much wandless magic but…” When he saw Harry’s face drop he felt like kicking himself. “But it’s useful. Now I can’t be late for class, literally it’s part of my terms of returning to Hogwarts.” Draco dismissed, turning to go.
“Possessive git,” Draco murmured but almost melted in relief. They were kissing again, as boldly and needy as before. Harry wrapped Draco’s legs around his waist and picked him up. “Hold the cloak” He murmured in between kisses. His hands secured around Draco’s waist. As they began to walk,
“You nearly had me then” Harry teased, kindness prevalent in his voice.
Casually, Harry scanned his eyes around the room, still on the look for the person who would dare do this to Draco.
Slowly, admittedly somewhat painfully, Draco eventually eased his way down until he was fully seated. He took a breath, and just focused on how
Draco gasped again, his hands gripping onto Harry’s hair again. Not forcing his head, but definitely tugging.
“Off” he whispered urgently to Potter,  kissing the top of his head but definitely pushing him off.
“But if I’m really the Chosen One or whatever, I should have....I should have saved them all.”
Just a lot happens in this chapter...so much.
, he couldn’t help but feel....protective.
“Finger yourself” Harry corrected and held his breath. This was straying even further into unknown territory. He was afraid Draco might run. He wouldn’t blame him.
“Anyway” echoed Draco, fully aware that he was in a room,
Barren shrugged, sneering. “Lucky accident.”
Draco thought frantically, virtually
“Thank you”
had wanted to say was ‘your precious Golden Boy was eating my ass last night’ but decided against it. Opting more to focus on the intense, throbbing pain in his ankle. He tentatively moved it and immediately stopped, the pain making his head even more dizzy. Moving up to his wrists, they were sore and there was a sharp pain that lingered but nothing major. He had a thrumming headache now but he could still see fine so he figured he wasn’t concussed. No, the ankle would be the big problem.
“It’s not the physical pain that really bothers that, “ Draco whispered, unaware of when he started talking. “I’m used to that.” He added, ghosting his fingers absentmindedly over the scars on his chest as he normally did. “I was just so...afraid.  I was terrified to come back here because I know my actions had made this a hell for myself. And I was right. Didn’t even take a full day.” He sighed sadly, rising his ankle before plopping it back down.
Stealing Harry’s Invisibility Cloak for voyeurism? They hadn’t even held hands in public. The only inclination that this might be something Harry would be interested in was when Weasel was knocking on their door and Harry pulled Draco on top, or how Harry reacted when Draco kissed him earlier, or actually come to think of it how Harry was absolutely down to fuck Draco in the Astronomy Tower-
“Actually, you did-“
“I forfeit my turn?” Draco asked hopefully.
“Draco...” Harry whispered. He wasn’t going to ask why because he knew
“Scar head. How thick can you be? You need your hands.” Draco snapped by there was no heat in it, infact Harry could almost swear he heard fondness. Draco held Harry’s bruised hand delicately, waving the other hand over it and murmured something. Harry felt a pinch followed by what felt like rug burn but when Draco removed his hands, all the cuts had vanished. The bruising remaining but it looked a lot better.
Draco’s cheeks blushed, and he brought his hand up and wrapped it around Harry’s base while he started to bob his head. He concentrated hard to hallow his cheeks and keep the rhythm of his head in time with the movement of his wrist.
Harry’s punch landed before Barren could even finish his sentence. Turns out, the guy was really bark no bite as he fell pretty hard, head smacking against the pavement. The students around them gasped, some turning to leave least they get in trouble others starting to chant ‘fight!’
-“ Harry started but Draco stood up, between Harry and Barren.
Eventually Draco pulled back and opening his eyes he saw...the look in Potter’s eyes mixed with the flush in his cheeks made Draco’s cock twitch, the desire to pull him in again too strong. His hands were shaking with want, so he clasped them behind his back, already morning the loss of Harry underneath his hands.
“Then why have you come to my dorm?” Draco asked, hand still clutching his wand discreetly.
Harry, immediately, used the hand on Draco’s back to pull him in, bringing his right hand up to mirror Draco’s hand’s position, gently rubbing his thumb over Draco’s cheek. He felt the heat of Draco’s blush under his palm, their eyes fixated on one another. It was a delicate balance, the tension before a catalyst.
“Who are they?” Harry pressed, squeezing Draco’s hands hard.
Harry watched Draco’s face intently, trying not to be too distracting by the hand Draco had on his cock incase he hurt him. After a while, and enjoying watching Malfoy growing increasingly desperate, Draco finally whispered, “I’m ready. Do it.”
It was only when the door closed that Draco finally whispered, “kiss me first.” But Harry had gone.
Draco shook his head in what he hoped was a casual manner “It’s stupid. I tripped, on one of the table and I...that’s why I didn’t tell you.” When Draco looked up he was met with suspicious eyes.
“Because I want to” Harry shrugged, as though it were obvious.
friction even if it was a slow rhythm at first.
“Is what I’m doing! But you have to listen to me, please, Gin, I’m tryin-“ Harry took a breath, cutting himself off.
After a moment, as they both settled into the after glow, Harry pressed another kiss onto Draco’s lips. “Did you feel good?”
Draco smirked back, tilting his face to the angle he knew made him most attractive and walked slowly towards Potter. “Come here then” he teased, hoping his the pounding of his heart wouldn’t shake his voice.
” Draco teased, smirking that quickly turned into a groan when Harry ground his groin against Draco’s. “
Harry groaned, lifting his head to kiss Draco hard. So hard Draco’s head was sent flying back to hit the wall. Draco winced, Harry didn’t stop kissing him but quickly put a hand behind Draco’s head, cradling his head and rolled his hips extra hard almost as an apology.
“Please” Harry pressed, his large hands moving to squeeze Draco’s ass. The blonde moaned, realizing he had missed how Harry’s hands felt on him.
“What do you have for the rest of the day?” Harry mumbled into Draco’s skin which buzzed with each word.
Draco nodded, propping himself up on his elbows to see Harry better and
“Harry” Draco whispered, spreading his legs wider to accommodate him. “
“Enjoy”
Draco was a planner, this entire escapade had been planned out meticulously if not stupidly. However, it was pure instinct that made Draco reach down and start to roughly stroke himself in his pants. He couldn’t
“That’s cheating-“
“Your face, hot head. Please, just...it won’t help. They already think I’m mind bending you or something. Doesn’t matter what you do, they’ll just twist it so I’m at fault. Let it go.”
“I dare you to be Blaise’ dog for the next turn” Seamus grinned, holding up his wand.
Draco heard Pansy laugh
year welcome back party.”
Draco chided himself, standing under the hot water. His thoughts of self-sabotaging thoughts continued to fall like the water from the tap until Draco was broken out of his trance by a insistent knock.
“I love when you say my name” Harry murmured, his voice low and raspy as he whispered into Draco’s pale neck, making the blonde shiver.
“Yes, fine, okay.”
of Potter being pressed into him.
“Harry?” A voice called, it was Granger. Hell, she’ll know immediately. They’re totally fucked. “Ron says you disappeared after Quidditch, are you alright?”
“You’re just saying that cause you lost” Weasley chimed in.
Harry kneed over Malfoy, forgetting magic for the moment, just focused on the need to stop, stop this all from happening. “I’m- I’m so sorry Draco I didn’t know what it did- I didn’t-“ he stuttered, watching the man who had fascinated him, taken over his life bleed away under him.
“Sorry?”
Draco’s pale hands were a stark contrast to Harry’s dark hair, and he carded his hands through the dark locks. The feeling of Harry’s lips on his was intoxicating. The large hands rubbing his chest paired with the wonderful pressure Harry’s leg applied pushing between his legs was enough to get Draco embarrassingly hard for what they had done so far.
Not quite a strip tease but not quite purely functional either, Harry made short work of the top, throwing it on the floor and Draco was left staring at his
“Really? When would you have letting me start kissing you?”
“Hey. Nice job at quidditch today” Harry responded, leaning against the wall. “What’s up?”
Draco took a deep breath, glancing over at Harry one more time before closing his eyes and screaming, “FUCK IT!”
” Draco’s continuous moans filled the room.
“Which one?” Harry breathed back, getting a firm grab of his ass now, kneading it, pulling Draco into his rolling hips.
invisibility cloak from the Deathly Hallows. Merlin what a tosser. How Harry had managed to keep it secret for
“No” gasped Draco, openly horrified at the thought. Harry nodded, gently laying Draco’s hand on his cheek, leaning into the touch. Draco ran his thumb softly over Harry’s skin.
“To see...to see what I’ve done” replied Harry in a unnervingly small voice.
Harry starred at Draco as though he were crazy which only made Draco more frustrated. “Because you don’t deserve that, Malfoy.”
“So sorry to crash-“ little Weasel started, walking across the room and not sounding remotely sorry, “but Luna had already crashed and I wanted to see everyone.” She proclaimed, plopping down next to- no
Harry was face to face with Barren, who still looked like he was waiting for Harry to praise him. Draco glanced around and saw basically the entire Great Hall stare at them. Part of Draco just wanted Harry to play along with it. It would make it easier. But Draco knew that look.
. Draco melted a little, mind temporarily hazing over before he came back, because he couldn’t let Potter
” Ron sighed, none of them getting exactly what was going on here.
the door closed and Draco didn’t have the worry about the cloak, it fell to the ground and Harry slammed Draco against the door. Instantly, locking and silencing charms were murmured by Draco while Harry spelled away their clothes. Harry hooked the fingers he had inside of Draco, “you’re mad.” He laughed, preening at the way Draco shuddered beneath him.
“Nnyyat?” Draco moaned, lust filled brained trying to keep up. Harry straightened up, shifting his weight on his knees and kissed Draco’s thigh.
he realized, the words coming out before he knew they would. “I want to jump” he whispered, so softly, like in defeat, eyes looking at the ledge.
Draco smirked, tugging Potter’s head up so he could look into those green eyes. “I had planned to tease you all dinner long. Guess Barren had other plans.” And oops, maybe he shouldn’t have mentioned Barren.
Harry sat down on the ledge, looking at the discarded blanket. “Same thing you’re doing I reckon.”
“Why not?” Harry demanded, growing frustrated.
“Stoppit” Harry mumbled, causing Draco to jump a little.
“Then do it” Draco whispered, putting his hands in Harry’s hair and tugging slightly. But he felt the brunette shake his head.
“I don’t have a-“
he could not handle this much sincere affection in large doses. Or small ones, probably.
Both smiled at the familiarity of competition before sitting down. Draco taking a sip because he lost and Harry...in victory, Draco supposed.
“Ah, yes thank you for that helpful advice. Let me just tell them to ‘bugger off’ that’ll fix it” came Draco’s dry reply.
Draco turned around fully and looked intently at Harry who was looking very determinedly downward. Slowly, as to not ruffle the fabric too much, Draco reached for Harry’s hand, running his thumb gently over Harry’ knuckles. Draco was struck, not for the first time, with the thought that he really didn’t know much about the Boy Wonder.
. His warm, large hands on his face, his cock in his mouth, his heat under his hands, and his scent injected into his brain.
Potter shook his head, beginning to kiss down Draco’s chest. “I’ve been thinking about it all day...and admittedly a little jealous. Plus,” Harry reasoned, face teasingly close to Draco’s crotch. So close that Draco could feel Potter’s breath skim his cock. “Plus, I hate seeing people degrade you” he whispered, suddenly a lot more serious. “They’re all idiots.”
And actually, there are clues in Harry's emails, but they are subtle enough that Draco didn't even catch them ^_^
Ugh, I suppose you needed it.
"Maha! Turn OFF the Veela charm!" Harry insisted, prompting Mahafsoun to stand up straight and stop purring.
I was a tiny bit spooked when it seemed like the entire village flinched at that, but I assumed that they were simply horrified by the fact that this so-called man had once abused his son.
This was such a surprising wedding! I felt that since Eris is probably our most stubborn daughter - right up there with Viona and Morgana - well, her wedding would be a lot like Viona's... only on the beach.
He kissed both of our hands before continuing. "Ollie and Draco, I pledged to each of you the entirety of my love, my life, my magic, my heart, and my soul. Giving these to both of you hasn't made them smaller; neither of you are receiving only a portion. Expanding our family never gives smaller pieces of love to the individual parts; giving love only increases our ability to give more. I love you Oliver. I love you Draco. I love you both more than I ever thought possible. I vow to continue loving you more and more, every single day of our lives."
But as I was saying, the actual task is this: Rescue the child. In Russia - in certain places especially - there is a lot of snow for a lot of the year, and so, it is a matter of Pride to be able to survive out there if necessary. Thus, the maze is full of things that might occur in winter, such as a blizzard. The children are sitting in nice warm caves with a fully trained guardian to protect them from - well - mostly from wandering out into the maze and getting caught up in the mild perils.
Let me know what you need please, I can send Muffy to the Ministry with sweets if you'd like which is currently my only helpful suggestion but I'm open to other ideas of how I can be helpful.
he heard he came hard. He felt his whole body tremble, aware of nothing except his hips jerking wildly as he tried to drive Draco to the edge as well.
Draco’s hair, instead of sleeked down, had more volume. He had allowed some the front few strands to curl, while the rest were pushed back. Yes, Draco thought as he admired himself in the mirror, Harry’s going to have a miserable time. And truthfully, Draco felt more like himself than he had in a while.
Potions class, to put it lightly, was never Harry’s specialty. Even if Snape didn’t have an immense bias against him, Harry didn’t think he’d ever be decent at it. It was just too precise. Too tedious. He had gotten so used to dreading the dreary dungeon class that he didn’t even consider it could be anything less than miserable.
, Draco thought as he felt Harry throb in his mouth. This was supposed to be for Harry but he could feel himself starting to swell in his pants. Draco closed his eyes, getting lost in the act of making Harry feel good. Harry was
“Maybe there’s nothing to talk about.”
“Sorry?”
“Harry”
Harry’s pulse raced under Draco’s lips. He pressed, sucked, and bit along Harry’s collar bone while his other hand took Harry fully out of his pants. The heavy weight sat nicely in his hands and he ran his thumb gently across the tip.
Luna walked in, transforming his mug of tea into a pine cone, “it’ll only be worse if you avoid everyone. Pansy and Blaise are coming too.”
“Yeah...alright.” Draco sighed. He’d only go for half an hour, it couldn’t be
“Don’t presume to know anything about a war you didn’t fight in. Or a man you know nothing about.” Harry spat back which was surprisingly elegant given the rage that currently fueled his body.
grade common room quickly, giving Potter no time to turn back.
Draco hurried up the stairs to their room, opening the door with a flick of his wand. He quickly murmured the strongest silencing and locking spells he knew, flinging them at the door right before Draco felt Potter press into his space.
moan into each other’s mouths. Draco smirked in satisfaction, eyes fluttering with the immediate satisfaction of feeling roll his hips back, creating a glorious,
“You have, you just didn’t.”
“Again?”
Draco rolled his eyes, amazed that he hadn’t gotten noticeably hard yet. “We both have Quidditch try outs. And you have a girl friend to break up with” he spat out the last one, grinding down just once to make himself feel better. “The only thing I’m going to be riding today is my broom” he added, with a smug smirk as he rolled off Harry who was watching him with too much fondness for a man who just got cock blocked by his own boyfriend...or, whatever they are.
“Two months is nothing. Not to mention the war, and- there’s a lot to process. Don’t...you can’t beat yourself up for not healing fast enough.”
“There’s...there’s something else” Draco whispered, because he just felt so raw he felt compelled to get everything out.
“Such a filthy mouth, Potter.”
“You know, I think scars are pretty cool.” Harry smiled, lifting his hair to reveal his own scar. “I know people think of it as like...I don’t know a glory mark but growing up with a massive scar in the middle of your forehead...I understand how awful it feels to be looked at.”
Harry almost flinched at the touch, so caught up in his head, but relaxed immediately, almost becoming shy when Draco saw the blood seeping from his knuckles. “Nothing Hermione can’t fix.”
“Rules are simple. You pick truth or dare, if you don’t answer you drink if you don’t do the dare you drink. And these-“ he waved his wand, each of their cups glowing, “are now enchanted so they’ll know the truth and know if you did the dares. Another rule, is that if you take too long to decide....you play your own round of spin the bottle.” Dean finished with a mischievous grin.
“You don’t have to feel so guilty all the time, Draco.”
“This is exactly why we
Draco felt like he had shut down and was in the beginning of a reboot. Affection. Cannot compute. Eventually he stuttered out a, “when are your classes?”
“You didn’t mention that” Harry whispered.
Harry looked up at him in concern, squeezing Draco’s thighs. “You look incredible Draco, I can’t even tell you” Harry gasped, already the heat of Draco around him almost too much.
See? Told you I'd update it. This chapter takes a lot of twists and turns, hope you enjoy! Also comments truly make my day.
“Fuck, Harry-“ Draco whined. It was incredibly lucy that one, the hallways were empty because classes had begun (Draco didn’t have any more classes today and he knew Harry didn’t either), and two that Harry could even fit his hand underneath Draco’s tight ass pants.
So much blood.
Unsurprisingly, being a Death Eater taught you a lot of curses but healing magic wasn’t exactly a big thing. He couldn’t go to Madam Pomfrey because then Potter would know and while Draco may secretly enjoy it when scar head got angry for him, he knew Potter would blow it way out of proportion.
“What? Am I-“
Thought Harry distantly as he swirled his pumpkin juice. It’s not that he wasn’t excited to be back, because he was. But this was also the first time back to the castle after the war. Last time he had stepped foot on Hogwarts ground he lost so many of his friends, everyone had, and frankly he was too busy ignoring the unavoidable memories that came flooding back to him seemingly every new spot he looked. Safer to look down.
grade dormitory. He met a portrait of...nothing. There was no one in there, just a semi elaborate background. Ah well. “Pumpkin” he told the empty canvas and it swung open revealing a common area that was slightly smaller than Gryffindor’s but cozier, if that were possible. Floating in the middle of the room was a piece of parchment titled ‘Room Assignments’. He stepped up, “Harry Potter”. On the parchment, the words “Suite 7, room 2”. Great, maybe not a single completely but the next best thing.
Not for long, of course, Harry returned in under ten minutes with two sandwiches and a plate of biscuits in hand. He set them down, and Draco started eating immediately. They ate in silence, both starving. It was only when Draco had finished his first biscuit that he again whispered, “kiss me?”
“I’m sorry, are you saying that letting you live was a mistake?”
“Oh, am I ruining your fun then am I?”
to have his hand on Harry, at the bare minimum.
“Are you drunk?”
just...”how...when did you...”
“Is that why your wrists are bruised and you have a migraine?” She pressed looking unamused. Potter looked at Draco in concern.
“Not particularly, no.”
. God, how Draco just wanted to tilt his head up only a few inches, kept their bodies pressed-
in his entire
“Do you play Quidditch, Barren?” Harry asked, tightly.
“I don’t hate you, Draco. Sure you’re kind of a prat-“
“Well, why do you care? March into Gryffindor common room and beat them up? I told you, I’m not welcome here. Whatever.” Draco assured, trying his best to appear casual. Part of him would want nothing more than for Harry to stand up for him. Let the whole school see that Harry chose
It probably sounded stupid, and it was out of nowhere, he knew. But he had been wanting to kiss Harry for
Without much further trouble he found Suite 7, and opened the door. A blank space, only the bare furnishings of a couch and table was the first thing Harry took in and...Malfoy. Malfoy was sitting in the window, now staring directly at him.
“You want to?” Harry asked, the hands on Draco’s ass making a very compelling argument.
Harry knelt down, coming eye level with Draco. Harry looked…he had no idea. Before Draco could say anything, Harry leaned in and kissed him. “I don’t want to share you,” Harry whispered after they pulled apart. “I want this-“ He reached behind and gently circled Draco’s hole with his pointer finger. “To only be ours.”
“Get on with it then” Draco dismissed, sounding bored. The three chuckled, and Draco briefly wondered if he had looked this pathetic in his younger years.
year table for the distinct blonde.
When he arrived, Ron was waiting for him by the Fat Lady. Harry waved, willing his temper to cool down. Ron wouldn’t do that to Draco. If he was gonna hurt Draco, Ron would have shoved him off Harry’s broom in the Room of Requirement.
“No. I don’t...I did...feel like that...after the war. Well, after the trial.”
“But the thing is I don’t really know you, do I? Look, this is our last year, a vacation, almost from the last few years, and I’m gonna enjoy it. Can we just say, fuck it? Please”
Harry
Draco looked
“Out of my way then” Malfoy commanded, though it seemed more out of habit than malice.
“Well, we have to leave the room eventually. You have friends, we have Quidditch final placements, we have the 8
“Hello Luna...can I help you?”
“Harry
Draco smiled, feeling himself blush, and squeezed Harry’s hand back. Meeting eyes with Potter, Draco felt the question, the root of all his anxiety about he and Potter’s potential (actual?) relationship, land at the front of his consciousness. “Are we making too big a deal out of this?”
. Then I think you are being
A horrible silence followed and Draco found he couldn’t breathe. “Well...figure it out” came Ginny’s voice, sounding held together. “Please Harry I...you know I love you. And I think...please just give us another chance.” She whispered, before Draco heard footsteps. Peaking around the corner he just Harry standing there, fists clenched, his back looking taut with tension.
“Well...yes. They are.”
move his hips back.
“Would you rather I called you Malfoy?”
“Well pay attention, Potter. As I prove you wrong again.”
Draco just kept crutching, looking straight ahead. “I tripped.” Harry looked like he almost grabbed Draco’s shoulder to make him stop but then realized that would be stupid so he returned his hands to his sides. They didn’t speak again until they reached the room. Draco tossed the crutches and flung himself onto his bed. Or Harry’s. They actually hadn’t decided that yet. Whatever one they had slept in last night.
“You’re too cheesy” Draco teased, though there was no bite.
“What does that mean, Scar Head?” Draco teased, though he was genuinely curious.
“Did they do this?” Demanded Harry, eyes looking deeply into Draco’s. After a moment, Draco nodded his head slightly and he
It took Malfoy another three minutes, Harry should know, he counted, to appear. His clothes had been dried, blood disappeared except for a faint rosy stain, though Harry could have just been imagining it. He let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding.
“You saved my life. I told them that, all of them.”
. Almost worst than Azkaban itself. The Professor was insufferable, Draco hadn’t even managed to catch his name it was so dull. He sat in the back, alone, as no other student would care to sit near him. Even his fellow Slytherins, of which there were quite a few in this class, didn’t dare. Class unity yada yada.
came she-weasel’s shrill reply.
“Can’t it just be getting to know you?”
but he couldn’t help it.
to remind people. I-I was part of a group that ruined people’s families, that destroyed Hogwarts. It took...everything. From everyone. I’m not trying to hide from it, because I have no right to, but I also don’t want to flash a constant reminder in people’s faces.” Draco looked down, rubbing at his dark mark.
“You look so perfect up there” Harry moaned, using the grip on Draco’s hips to pull him down to meet his thrusts.
Harry just stood there, watching Malfoy fight for his life, cut to pieces, shaking with rage and guilt and grief. Why grief?
“Yes.”
This was the second morning that Draco had woken up naked, pressed into the broad, dark chest of Harry Potter. And honestly, he couldn’t complain. Draco blinked, sleep slowly scrubbed from his vision. As the sleep faded away, Draco realized that Harry’s green eyes were staring right into his.
Malfoy’s pale, helpless figure soaked in his own blood, not washing away in the water but turning it red too.
Draco did, blushing immediately with the care Harry was looking at him with. Harry smiled, kissing Draco one more time before continuing to unbutton Draco’s shirt. They both held their breath as Harry undid the last button and pushed the fabric away from the scars. They looked deeper in the shadow of the room. Harry looked down, took a breath, and looked up locking eyes with Draco. Harry’s eyes were hooded, guilt pooled behind his irises. Draco reached up, taking Harry’s hand in his and placed it on his chest, right over the worst scar.
Hermione sighed, rolling her eyes. “Honestly. Slytherin’s may be more cunning, but when it comes down to it, no one’s more thick headed than a Gryffindor.”
“Yes, well I would like it more if you actually started to touch me, Potter.” Which earned Draco another open mouth kiss from Potter.
Harry bellowed, an intense hatred mixed with a shameful bit of fear thrumming through his veins. His eyes were locked on Malfoy, the pathetic, bareboned creature who stood before him as the curse crackled through the air, striking Malfoy dead on in the chest. Adrenaline still pounding through Harry, he felt a breath of relief start as Malfoy flew back, the start of the Cruciatus curse still ringing in his ears as he watches Malfoy fall.
“It’s fine. What’s first day of classes without a minor breakdown?” Draco let out a wry laugh. Before taking a step back, and reaching for the shampoo. Even the bottle alone looked entirely too expensive. When he saw Harry’s raised eyebrow, Draco merely smirked. “If you’re going to keep insisting on pulling my hair, I have to ensure it’s healthy...won’t I?”
“Your scars-“ Harry began, not even consciously, cutting himself just as Malfoy sneered.
“Much more myself” Draco teased back, but it was so genuine that Harry couldn’t help but smile. He did look much more himself.
) Draco firmly reminded himself trying to make himself believe it was true. From where he sat in the arm chair, distantly running his fingers across his lips, he would occasionally make eye contact with Harry. And the git just kept staring back. Draco kept eye contact, a challenge, kept his gaze boring into Potter’s stupidly green eyes because
Harry smirked, rocking up into Draco lightly as he called back, “yeah, thanks, just have a bit of a hangover.” Draco bit harder, using his mental power to
“I’d really like to fuck you. If you’re okay with that” Harry murmured, hands gently framing Draco’s face. The request was kind of awkward, endearing. A little more par for the course.
a hero, Harry. That’s a fact. But that doesn’t make you less of anything else. It doesn’t make you less human, less emotional, less of a prat, less deserving. I know you have your fan club but, Harry,
Draco’s eyes flicked to Harry, smirking slightly before he looked back at the guy. “Can I help you?”
“I’ll wipe the floor with you” Granger challenged back, her competitive side coming out and Weasley shouted in support from the side lines.
as Draco swallowed about half of him. His warm,
“Touch yourself.” Harry whispered.
Ginny considered him, she was biting her bottom lip to try and keep a neutral face. As was Harry, he felt awful subjecting her to so much pain. “Friends. Just...give me some time.” She whispered.
“And I was already proven right” Draco sighed, raising his ankle up. It did feel a lot better though, which was good. “I take it back. Broomsticks are the only thing being ridden today” Draco sighed, feeling immense rage towards a
“Truth or dare.”
Harry scoffed jokingly, bringing his hands to rest at Draco’s waist.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fine” Draco whispered back, desperate to get Potter’s mouth on his and for him to
Harry took in a breath, slowly moving his fingers over it. Draco watched him intensely, fighting the desire to run away because he was so exposed but something in the earnestness which Harry looked down at him, Draco stayed where he was.
hypocritical.” Draco pressed a gentle kiss on Harry’s lips, and whispered, “you could have kissed me since third year because despite being a massive prat, I was so enamored with you. With your goodness. Even if I found it intolerable. You deserve to forgive yourself, Harry.”
Honestly, Draco didn’t even know who was standing infront of him, but based on the way the black haired guy crossed his arms and sneered at Draco, he sure thought Draco did. The man was backed by two others, a smug looking girl and a tremendously tall guy. Partially annoyed at someone wasting his time, partially smug that he had proven Potter wrong so quickly, and partially terrified, Draco made eye contact with the man and raised his eyebrow.
“The trial was two months ago.” Harry whispered, gently taking Draco’s left hand on his.
“You don’t have to-“ Harry whispered but was cut off by Draco’s tongue, and a skillful twist of his wrist. It didn’t take long until Harry was moaning Draco’s name, coating Draco’s hand as he came.
“Yes, I paid a deranged idiot to physically abuse me so my boyfriend would kiss me” Draco retorted dryly. “What are you smiling at?” Harry was
Harry ran his hands down Draco’s chest, this time lifting the shirt off Draco’s shoulders and it too joined Harry’s clothes on the floor. Once again Harry’s fingers arrived at Draco’s waist line but this time they nimbly started undoing the buttons, then Harry fuckin Potter, the Boy Who Lived, took Draco’s zipper between his teeth and tugged. And fuck if that wasn’t one of the hottest things Draco had ever seen.
Alive, but only just so. Even for Malfoy, he looked sickly pale. His white skin contrasted harshly with the dark circles, highlighting the hollow look in his eyes. Harry watched as Malfoy fiddled with the ring he knew Malfoy always wore harshly, not quite worked up the courage to step out fully. Not for the first time, Harry considered the privilege, for he could think of no other word for it, to watch the great Draco Malfoy, pride of Slytherin and man of ice, when he thought he was alone. It hadn’t been intentional, but after all this time, the moments Harry could see the vulnerability that was shocking to Harry in the beginning, Harry had begun, against his will, to reconsider his idea of Malfoy. Yes, he was undoubtably up to something, but the man didn’t exactly seem...happy about it. If anything, the more the year progressed, Malfoy seemed more and more like a skeleton walking.
“Spin again!”
“How did you know I have a migraine?” Draco challenged.
“Just because you want to sleep with me?” Draco pushed, because he felt disgustingly raw with how vulnerable he felt.
“And what’s that?” Draco challenged, sitting down next to Harry. They weren’t touching but the ledge was only so large.
Draco almost had the idiocy to ask. Dean, yes that one was definitely Dean, carried cardboard boxes...what?
“Because you have a temper.”
“Booooo” jeered Dean.
The warm water gently pattered over them as they stood there, Harry gently holding onto Draco, who seemed to give himself over completely. “It’s hard for me to accept affection.” Mumbled Draco into Harry’s chest after a while. “My parents never hugged me. Mother sometimes did when I was younger but...appearances and all that. And anyone I’ve ever...fucked.” Draco spat out, “didn’t care who I was, actually I think they didn’t want it to be me. Or like I was a bet or a dare or a challenge. No one’s ever,
“One of those things will happen” Draco shrugged, nudging into Harry’s chest. Harry immediately wrapped his arms around Draco, holding him close.
Harry watched as Draco, keeping his eyes on Harry, slowly dropped his jaw and stuck his tongue out. He rested just the tip of Harry on his tongue, coaxing along slowly, tasting him. Slowly, Draco leaned forward and Harry bit down
It was a miracle that Harry didn’t come right there. The sight of Draco on his knees anywhere was almost too much. Draco, hair wrecked in his uniform, in the
After a little more, Draco reached down to stroke himself, needing more friction. Harry let him, tightening his grip on Draco’s thighs and the thought of him bruising from Harry’s grip on him made Draco’s toes curl.
“I’m good here.”
Draco looked at him, lips pursed. He tried, he really did, but he could resist everything except temptation. He stepped forward, kissing Harry gently, smiling when Harry automatically responded. Draco pulled back shortly, “can we just...see how things go in private for a while? I...I’ve never done anything like this before, and I...you know, Harry no matter how much you pretend, that the moment people hear about...
Potter just stared at him, as though Draco had given him a clue in something, until he finally shifted, getting off Draco slowly. “Told you socks were a mistake” Potter smiled gently, sticking out his hand to help Draco up. He stood up without it, trying to fix his clothing. “Next time you won’t win on a technicality.”
They had almost made it to the corner where the staircase was, safety, when he heard Weasel mutter, “right funny Harry being roomed with Malfoy.” Draco rolled his eyes, and he felt Harry tense behind him,
Draco didn’t need to look to know that Potter was staring intensely at him. Draco shook his head, standing up. He had been given crutches, which Draco deplored but dignity hadn’t exactly been his strong suit today. It was only when he stood up that he heard his stomach rumble. He hadn’t eaten yet.
“Mind bending me?” Harry repeated, his voice sounding tighter by the second.
Draco was speechless, Harry’s eyes hadn’t left his the entire time and all he could think was that was the most Harry had probably ever talked in one go. Draco could think of anything to respond to that except an inelegant but totally earnest, “me too” before Draco surged forward and kissed Harry. Perhaps words couldn’t convey, but his lips and tongue still could. Draco kissed into Harry’s mouth, his consciousness getting lost at all the points they connected, even more so when Harry pressed back. Their mouths met with enough force to bruise but it still wasn’t enough.
Harry nodded, squeezing Draco’s waist encouragingly. Draco sat up, reaching behind him to grab Harry’s cock. He muttered a protection charm before aligning himself over it. Draco took a deep breath, and slowly began to lower himself onto Harry.
“You’re squinting” she dismissed, “I just needed to hear you admit it before I gave you some treatment.”
“Don’t make me gag, Potter.”
When Draco lays his hand on Harry’s back, pressing them together, instinctively really because Harry and Draco were having an intense, indepth conversation in completely silence. Once their bodies were decidedly pressed together, Harry snapped, his delicate fingers in Draco’s hand suddenly taking purchase and puling Draco towards him as Harry’s lips met Draco’s.
