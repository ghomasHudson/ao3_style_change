Professor Slughorn gave Draco a slight pat on the back. "Perhaps the next lesson will turn out a bit better, you can't expect it to always be perfect. Why don't you both go through the instructions again, see if you can figure out what you may have done wrong." The old coot gave the duo a smile, and shuffled off behind his desk.
Harry watched, enchanted as the statue rotated, revealing a staircase. They entered, Harry smiled gleefully at sparkling, whirling, twirling trinkets around the room. He spotted Fawks, proud and prime and preening. Harry petted him gently, giggling as he was nudged back.
"Better. You will eventually learn how to properly talk to your superiors." Voldemort leaned back leisurely in his throne. "You're here because I need you to do something for me. And if you value your life, I don't believe you'll have much of an issue with it." A slow smile crept up his face. Harry hated him more than he had when the bastard was in his head just a few weeks ago.
The bleeding stopped after a minute, and Draco was able to clean up the blood that had dried on Harry's face. Draco was suddenly reminded of an accident he'd had when he was about eight. He had taken a tumble off his broom and had hurt his head.
"Hagrid was the first friend I had. He's a good person, you really shouldn't hold what he is against him, you know," Harry said, getting himself some tea too.
Harry blinked at him for a minute. "It's a... school... for magic," Harry said slowly, nodding along with his words. Draco's worry subsided somewhat, but the bruise staring him in the face wouldn't let him relax completely.
"Thank you, Headmaster," Draco nodded. His chest felt a little less tight, something he hadn't noticed until it was gone.
But that was Harry with the mind of a child. That wasn't the Harry that was almost an adult, that had hated him for years. Draco didn't think one person could change him so much, but Draco wanted to be better for Harry. Wanted Harry to accept him and be as close as his Gryffindor friends.
His eyes darted around. He was good at looking for escapes, he had done it a lot. He could, now that they weren't holding him. There was a window on the other side of the room, but he wouldn't be able to reach it unless he climbed on the table. He wasn't fast enough. The door they had come through was blocked by the woman and one of the other two.
Harry glared at her, which wasn't nearly as intimidating as it would have been just a few minutes ago. Draco distractedly compared the look to a grumpy kneazle.
"Yes Professor!" Voices rang out. Mcgonagall nodded slightly, and said nothing else on the matter. Soon, the class was busy writing notes, and the only whispers were complaints of hurt wrists and 'what did she just say?'
Draco peaked into Harry's room, which was identical to his own, except his had a color scheme of blues and purples. Draco was a little surprised by that, he expected Gryffindor colors, but perhaps Dinky decided to do something else.
Draco's heart leaped into his throat. After a moment, Harry prodded the side of his head. Draco battled his hand away.
Harry's eyes snapped back to Professor Dumbledore. "A Hungarian Horntail, Professor. I mostly just thought it was terrifying."
The first thing he heard were the terrified cries coming from Harry. The first thing he saw was a small cyclone of pillows and stuffed animals circling Harry. He’s crying, trashing slightly, the knuckles on his right hand white from clutching the bed sheets.
He laid Harry down gently. He pulled the sheets up to Harry's neck, covering his arms and the werewolf stuffed animal he held.
The door shook, before it was ripped off its hinges. A large figure stood in the doorway, walking in to the thumping pattern Harry had heard. The man placed the door back where it had been, more jamming it in place than really fixing it. Harry heard Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia walk down the stairs, and heard Dudley wake up. As Uncle Vernon cocked his shotgun, The man smiled.
"Done eating?" Draco asked him. Harry nodded slowly. "Good. Madam Pomfrey also left a healing balm, I was thinking we should put it on your chin so that nasty bruise will go away," he talked as he walked past Harry -who had lightly touched his face at the mention of the bruise- into the kitchenette.
Draco was thinking similarly to Harry. Something must've been wrong with him, if he was even contemplating the fact the Potter looked 'cute'. At any age, Potter was disgusting.
Draco wiped away tears that occurred at the thought of Harry getting tortured. When he focused back on it, he noticed two parallel lines that connected the Shrieking Shack to the Whomping Willow. Dracco stared at it for a moment, wondering what that meant. Pipes? A watering system?
Harry's lips were soft and delicate. Draco was afraid he would crush them. Harry didn't seem to share his fear. Harry pulled him impossibly closer, making Draco's head spin and his heart race.
"And this is that thing you can't tell me about?" Draco asked. They were almost to the dungeons now, Harry hadn't noticed most of the trip. He shook his head, but stopped when it made him dizzy.
"While the lethal qualities of this creature and it's inability to be domesticated by anyone who does not have the ability to speak parseltongue has given it a Dangerous Creature Rating of XXXXX, it's gaze is not always deadly. By indirect eyesight (ex. locking eyes through a mirror) will cause petrification, or freezing of the victim's body.
"Harry, what're you doing?" Draco asked, walking over and taking the bowl from him. Putting a hand to Harry's head confirmed his guess, and he unwrapped the package Dinky had brought to him.
"What if we do, though? This is our first trip to Hogsmead, and I'd rather have something to look forward to than staring sadly at the Firebolt display every time we come," Harry said, twisting around to look at said display, "and what's the harm, anyways?
Harry hadn't left Draco's room until this morning. He seemed recovered, but Draco still thought the whole incident should have been avoided. This morning had been full of questions about Weasley and Granger. It had yielded few results.
Draco was holding Harry's wrist next to him. Harry's stomach churned with disgust. He dreaded who would be next.
"Dinky, if you would please take these young men to their rooms," Dumbledore said with a smile. He adjusted Harry in his arms, freeing the hand that was holding the bag of potions.
"It was just... on his face this morning. I couldn't think of anything that could have caused it, I was with him the whole night, but Professor Slughorn mention that -"
Professor Lupin looked at him for a moment, assessing. After a moment, he sat his mug on the table and used a hand to rub his temples. "Harry, you probably don't know this, but me and your father were very, very good friends when we were in school," Professor Lupin began. Harry already had questions, but Lupin held up a hand to stop him, "There were four of us, thick as thieves. Your father, myself, Peter Pettigrew, and... and Sirius Black."
Time went by, and the platform slowly filled. He closed the door to his compartment, hoping it'd be passed by. But, of course, that wasn't the case. The door was opened numerous times, once by a tall boy with mousy brown hair, who apologized quickly. Harry wanted to ask him about his yellow robes, but he didn't get a chance before he shut the door and walked away.
Harry sat in the library, writing his potions essay. Trust that to be Snape's first assignment of the year.
"You don't know what hot chocolate is? Why, it is only the absolute best drink in the entire world! Really, it's a crime against humanity that you haven't tried it!" Draco swung his arms around dramatically, not stopping until Harry was giggling. "We must fix this mistake at once! Come, Child, I will teach you the wonders of this world," Draco proclaimed. Wondering when his life had come to this, and when he had become okay with it, he picked up a giggling Harry and took him to the kitchen, where he plopped him down on a chair.
"There we go, m'boy! Go ahead, down it goes," Professor Slughorn said happily, encouraging Harry with a large smile. Harry didn't think it was very encouraging.
"Don't look so sullen, Mr. Potter. Arrangements will be made to deal with the situation. Our students particular habit to gossip has already been dealt with, as I've heard."
Harry's joints ached with how stiff he was. "Look at me, Harry Potter." Harry lifted his head after a moment, comprehending the never-heard command. Blood red eyes stared back at him. "And prepare to die," he whispered.
There was a moment of silence. "What can you tell, Madam?" Dumbledore asked Pomfrey. She shook her head slowly.
, Harry Potter," the man hissed, "I didn't even have to interfere so you would meet your demise; you did it on your own," he said, giving him a cruel smile.
He let out a whoop -only one- and crouched over the parchment. It took a moment to orient himself, finding the exit to Hogwarts where a little dot labeled
"Oh Harry..." Draco muttered against his head. Harry wondered when Draco had gotten so tall, and let his head rest against Draco's chest. But then Draco pulled away, and Harry mourned the loss. He felt safe in Draco's arms.
"Harry, you didn't do anything wrong. I just need you to take this potion, and then you can eat whatever you want. Will you sit down?"
"Mr. Potter, do you know who I am?" Dumbledore asked, crouching down a little to meet Harry's eye. Harry bit his lip and shook his head. Draco could tell he felt guilty for not knowing, so he rubbed his back to calm him down. Harry gave him a shy smile.
A man with a turban, who immediately looked away when Harry looked at him, and a man in all black that gave him a steady glare. Harry looked back at him, ignoring the throbbing in his head. The man eventually looked away, a sneer on his face.
Harry screamed as his entire world lit up green and the man holding him jerked him around. They were in a dark room, but Harry couldn't see anything else past his tears. He sobbed, struggling to breathe from the force of it and how tightly the man was holding him. He punched weekly at the arm, legs flailing.
Ignorant to it all - or maybe just acting like she was - Hermione walked lightly to the front of the classroom, another small bottle of her perfect looking potion in hand. She smiled at Professor Slughorn, though her happy face was mostly obstructed by the disaster her hair had become.
"This is moronic," Draco whispered. Harry lifted his head slightly. The Great Hall didn't allow for much privacy, but the clutter and noise kept them from being heard fairly well.
all the time now. He had almost skipped this Hogsmead trip, like he had the other ones, but Hermione had sought him out specifically, and her sad eyes had guilt-tripped him more than he wanted to admit.
"About Hogsmead. You wouldn't have brought it up if it wasn't bothering you." Harry gave him a blank stare. Draco looked affronted. He opened his mouth but Harry cut him off. "No, don't look at me like that. You always complain about what's bothering you, you've just never been indirect about it. What's going on?" Draco ignored him, moving his queen. He'd have Harry's king soon, but Harry didn't care about that right now. He stared at Draco, waiting for an answer.
Thank you guys SO MUCH for reading!!!! This has been an absolute blast!!! If any of you have read the original, I hope I lived up to my promise of improvement! Tell me your thoughts and have a wonderful day!
Malfoy ran out of brooms first. Harry handed out the last of his, but a few yelling people were still calling for his attention. Draco had a skinny, dark haired man on the back of his broom, while somebody else had taken a stocky, short woman on the back of theirs. Harry flew to an inmate who wasn't calling, but was transfixed on Harry. His eyes glinted.
"Yes," he answered quickly. Harry knew the boy expected him to say more, but... what was he supposed to say? He knew next to nothing about the wizarding world.
Harry did as instructed, sincerely hoping he wasn't going to be incinerated as soon as he jumped through the flames. Fingers crossed, he leaped through. He made it across the other side, falling and scraping the palm of his hands.
Over at Neville's desk, a large pot with a nauseating green glow illuminated his face, along with the face of a very irritated Pansy Parkinson. Professor Slughorn didn't seem to have any advice for the pair, completely astonished by their ruined potion.
Harry stepped in front of Draco, holding his hands up in a placating motion while Dinky trembled off to the side. "Please, Sir Mercy, I'll make sure he won't say anything bad about vampires. He's nice, the family has really changed the past few centuries! Draco's father now advocates for creatures rights, and had been trying to get vampires a better status in the ministry for years now!" Harry explained hastily. Draco furrowed his eyebrows, but nodded along. Such a thought was preposterous, but if it kept him in a warm bed he would tolerate it.
It was difficult to run crouched while carrying Harry, but he couldn't allow himself to slow, or for fatigue to catch him. Harry still hadn't woken up, hadn't moved or made a sound. Draco was terrified.
He gave her a small treat, stroking her behind her ear as he gently untied the letter. He sat back down as he unrolled the parchment.
Harry's head snapped up so quickly Draco thought he may have given himself whiplash. His eyes were full of dread as he realized he would be drinking his own botched potion. He stared at the professor for a moment, his eyes similar to that of a deer in headlights. He looked over at Draco, panic quite clear. Harry wasn't sure why he looked at Draco. He certainly wasn't going to be getting help from the wanker who was filling another small potion bottle. And...were the corner of his lips...twitching?
The horn sounded. Cedric rushed into the maze, followed by Krum a second later. Harry couldn't see the majority of what was happening, the fog covered nearly everything. Vague shapes that could have been anything moved in the hazy light, some so ominously tall Harry shivered. Those were the dementors, he was sure of it.
I'm going to be in Slytherin. All the best wizards go there, and my entire family has been in that house for centuries," the boy said pompously, sharp nose high.
"He wouldn't leave." Madam Pomfrey told him. "Refused to. I didn't argue for long, since I saw how he was with you when he rescued you."
"Harry! Come here!" Draco called out, smiling when he heard the little footsteps thumping towards him. Harry had just gotten out of the shower after they had had breakfast, and his sopping hair hung around his ears and face.
Hermione gave him a scandalized look. "Harry, no! What about when he has to go to the bathroom? What if someone trips over him? What if he barks during one of our classes? So many things could go wrong!"
"I put a silencing charm around him so we wouldn't wake up from us speaking. I needed to make sure you were alright first, and it is much easier without a barnacle attached to my patient," she said with a smile. Harry's face turned red.
Next was by a girl with bushy hair, who smiled brightly at him. She didn't run away, unlike the first boy. "Hello, I'm Hermione Granger. I'm a first year, like you. Oh my gosh," she set her trunk down and rushed to the opposite seat, staring at Hedwig with wide eyes, "she is just
"Nicely done. In fact, this particular batch that I've had you make is supposed to turn someone's age back a year, for about a half hour or so. Some of you will be testing out your potions today. Would anyone like to volunteer for extra cred- ah! Ms. Granger, why don't you come up?"
"Fawks is at his best right now, and he certainly enjoys attention," Dumbledore spoke from behind his desk. Harry looked over, and saw the empty chairs facing the desk. He moved to sit, but Dumbledore held up his hand. "We'll be here for a moment, please continue. Would you like a Lemon Drop?" He offered, motioning towards a bowl.
Red sparks shot up from the far end of the maze, away from where Harry and Draco sat. The fog cleared, and Aurors rushed in. The projection changed to follow the wizards. Cedric lay incapacitated, a skrewt not far away. One Auror took it out, the others lifted Cedric into the air and guided him out. Harry thought he looked dead.
"You have had a very emotional and possibly traumatizing experience, Mr. Malfoy. Those will help your mind and muscles recover from what you have gone through. And use some of that cream I gave you to heal the cut on your cheek, as well," she said briskly, though she had a small smile on her face. Draco nodded, looking towards Dumbledore.
Now they both sat in her office, blood quills in hand. Harry saw Draco's face grimace in pain, and Harry looked at his own hand, reading
"Yes. Though your father came from an ancient Pureblood line, he decided to marry a Mudblood for some reason. Making you a Halfblood," Draco finished, rolling his eyes as though this were stuff Harry should've known coming out of the womb.
Harry's eye twitched. He didn't like the voice. He didn't understand how it was happening, but it wasn't a new sensation by now. Voldemort had decided in the last month that he needed to prepare more, practice more, strategize more, learn more...
Harry cried out. Draco settled into the couch and drank his a little slower, forgetting he was drinking it half the time and just watching Harry enjoy himself.
"Well...I did at first, but Uncle Vernon wouldn't let me have it. And then eventually the entire house was full of them. They flew through the windows and the chimney and the pipes. Uncle Vernon took us to stay at a hotel that night, so that we couldn't any mail from there, but it still came. And then we went to this deserted house in the ocean, and right as it turned midnight on my eleventh birthday, Hagrid burst in," Harry took a moment to laugh, "scared the wits out of my family. Turned my cousin into a pig and everything! It was... the best day of my life." Harry said, stopping abruptly. "Sorry, I didn't mean to ramble. What's the next question?"
Madam Pomfrey spoke to him then, and Harry wondered at why her voice softer than he had ever heard it. "Mr. Potter, I had Professor Slughorn give me a vial of the potion you drank, and it is malfunctioning. You've been asleep for nearly an hour and a half, which is well over the time the effects were supposed to have lasted. There is no telling how long this will last, but I do believe we must let the potion work itself out of your system."
To Draco's surprise, Harry got the concept almost before Draco had told him. Soon he was zooming around the room without any assistance. The practice broom had enchantments to ensure it didn't go above two meters, and the speed was limited as well.
The man smiled wider than Harry thought anyone else had. "I'm Sirius Black. Please Harry, you know me. Let me on your broom, please. I can tell you so much you don't know. Please, Harry!"
He sat alone for a little while, before he pulled out a textbook he hadn't had the time to look over, his potions book. He skimmed the pages, not really paying attention. He was a bit more concerned for Hermione than he suppose he should be, which he didn't really like. He hadn't ever really cared for someone.
His wand trembled in his hand, spinning several times before settling. He followed it until it was pointing directly at the base of a tree. Draco put it away, crouching and squinting. In the growing light, he could see it. A hole, mostly obscured by swaying branches and leaves, a small overhead cover made by its twisting roots.
Hermione frowned. "What's going on, Harry? You've got dark circles worse than I've ever seen." Her concern was accompanied by Snuffles laying his head on Harry's thigh, nudging the limp hand in his lap.
he could at the tree and leaped out of its range. It didn't completely immobilize it, but it did slow it down enough for Draco to make it out with only a scratch on his cheek from a small branch.
"Harry, will you come with me to my office?" Professor Dumbledore looked at him kindly, a reassuring smile on his face. Harry nodded, sliding off the bed and hitting the floor with a slight thud
"Potter, Malfoy, stay." Professor Moody grunted. Sharing a glance, they walked to his desk with their supplies. Moody waited until all other students had left before casting what Harry recognized as privacy charms on the doors. Harry squeezed Draco's arm behind their bags, where Moody couldn't see.
Draco shifted, a hand reaching towards Harry. Harry caught it with his own softly. Draco tugged him, muttering a "come 'ere." Harry went, tucking himself underneath Draco's chin and feeling utterly
Lucius had taught him the Fiendfyre curse two years ago. Harry had never used it until this day. It lashed out of his wand, straight at Nagini who was midair with her fangs out. She was too slow, unlike all the other times Harry had seen her strike with deadly precision.
"Now that the vermin is gone... what were you doing with her, Potter? We're better than that." Draco brushed off his robes where Hermione had pushed him, and took the seat she had occupied, while Blaise continued to lean against the wall.
If they were here, Harry and Nagini weren't visible, likely on the other side of the house. But Draco's dot was there. He put the map away. It couldn't do him any good now. A small, wooden ladder led up to a trap door, likely on the base level of the house.
The great hall buzzed with joy for the rest of dinnertime. Almost everyone was laughing with happiness, with relief that they themselves wouldn't be harmed. Almost everyone.
He had been summoned only an hour ago. The Dark Lord knew something had happened to Potter, though he didn't know what. Severus had been punished harshly for his inability to give information on what had happened. His body was still trembling from the Cruciatus curse.
Harry leaned forward to kiss him again. Draco met him this time, letting the soft kiss sooth his frazzled nerves.
"Lucius Malfoy called Pettigrew the Secret Keeper? That can't be right, Lily and James made Sirius the secret... unless they had changed it without any of us knowing, and when Sirius blew up the street he could've-what if he lived, maybe turned into a rat and-" Lupin stopped himself.
Barty Crouch had, of course, scoffed at the comment of war and told Dumbledore to leave. Voldemort had been cackling for days. That made the house a little easier to live in until school started.
"How does something so small eat so much?" Draco asked, gasping and holding a hand to his chest. Harry giggled. Draco tweaked his nose, smiling.
His mother had cleaned it up for him, much in the same way Draco was doing now. He hoped Harry woke up soon.
He went downstairs, noticing a nice breakfast with toast and bacon already set up for them. A small tray with a few potions and containers sat on the edge of the corner. Finding a note, Draco found himself worrying even more.
Draco laughed despite his nerves. "Yeah, probably. I think Professor Snape makes them all taste bad on purpose."
Draco was woken up by Harry rustling. Harry mumbled something and reached one of his little hands out. Holding shock still, Draco watched Harry as he rolled and slotted himself further into Draco's arms, grabbing Draco's bicep. Feeling possessed, Draco gently ran his fingers through Harry's hair, a sweet smile adorning his face to match Harry's contented one.
Draco had to trust his own magic. Even if he couldn't. He didn't have another choice right now. Harry was waiting for him, depending on him. Draco knew it in his bones.
No one had been injured, and the professors had taken care of the troll without any troubles. The only thing that had happened was that the troll busted up a bathroom. Hermione couldn't stop talking about it for weeks, she had tried to go back to the library that night to research, but it had been curfew.
Snape raised an eyebrow at him. "You really enjoy her company during meals that much? Or her stupid decrees?"
"Lay him down, Mr. Malfoy," Madam Pomfrey said, already casting diagnostic charms before Draco had laid him down. He hovered close by, wanting to reach out, hold him and make sure he was okay, but Pomfrey's work was more important.
"Headmaster?" Draco asked. Dumbledore's eyes flicked to him for a moment before returning to the sphere.
Harry shrugged. "Hedwig was the first pet I've ever had, and I named her after something I found in one of our first year textbooks. I'm no better at naming things than you are, and you're pretty awful at it."
Draco stood motionless for several moments, Harry feeling like lead in his arms. He wouldn't risk trying to stun or harm the snake, but he had to get past it to get to the door.
"How do you feel?" He asked after a tense moment. Harry shrugged. Draco controlled his expression, nodding. "That's alright." Was he... disappointed? He had to be. That should have fixed Harry, should have returned things to how they were.
Hermione sighed. "We can go to the library Sunday, but you have to know it's not a good idea, Harry."
"Are you okay, Harry? You've been so drained lately. I've been meaning to ask, but we never seem to be alone anymore. You're always with Malfoy." Hermione laid a gloved hand on his arm. Harry gave her a thankful smile, sighing.
Professor Slughorn now sat behind his desk, with his stupid cooling charm and anti-humidity charms that made Granger's hair look even more horrendous than usual. Draco turned his heated glare back to his table partner, who was still awkwardly shuffling through the textbook and examining their leftover ingredients, presumably to figure out 'what they had done wrong', as the professor had suggested.
Even that Harry didn't think he could talk about. So he said nothing and let the tears fall. Draco brushed some of them away with the hand that wasn't wrapped around Harry.
Harry didn't sleep. His large bed was very comfy, yes, but tonight it provided no comfort. The moon shined bright in the window, illuminating the large room. Harry waited.
They walked in, absorbing the cozy room. It seemed to be a common room of sorts, with a large fireplace, chairs couches and tables in hues of browns and whites. Draco heard the portrait close behind him, walking further in. Harry went down a small hallway, which opened into a humble kitchen with simple necessities. A door in the hallway lead to a bathroom, Draco found.
injury he'd gotten at this age until he was fixed? That brought up the uncomfortable question of Harry's family who called him 'freak.' Boys did tend to play rough and get a lot of bruises at seven, but thinking about it made Draco uneasy.
"I am too," Draco admitted, "but you are going to be okay. I trust Madam Pomfrey and Professor Snape with my life and yours. I promise you'll be okay."
"Shut it!" The man yelled in his ear. Harry flinched away, gasping. "I told you I wasn't going to be the one that grabbed him," the man snapped to someone on the left. Harry looked over, maybe if he pleaded, maybe if he begged-
Draco nodded, eyes flickering to her and back to Harry. "Mr. Malfoy, there is nothing you can do. You've done everything you can. You should be taking care of yourself, now." She placed a hand on his shoulder. Draco felt his lip quiver, but he clenched his jaw. He thought he would cry if he looked at her.
He had no idea how Voldemort was connected to this, but he knew it had something to do with the book Harry had left in the library months ago.
"Sit down on the couch so I can put this on it, okay?" Draco gestured from the table, but Harry hadn't moved at all. Draco crouched next to him so they were eye-level. "Does it hurt?"
"How do you feel? Any pain? Discomfort?" Professor Slughorn rocked back and forth, running his eyes over Harry to check for any immediate signs of fatal danger.
"Mr. Malfoy, please tell us what happened." Dumbledore said. He gave Draco a disapproving look, probably for going out on his own, but Draco couldn't be bothered. He had gotten Harry back, why should it matter?
Dumbledore be able to find him? Get past whatever protective charms they had placed? What would Draco do if Dumbledore couldn't?
Draco looked at him like he was a madman. "What's going on?" He demanded. Harry took a deep breath and felt...excited, for the first time in years.
"The gem works a little like a call button. If you press on it twice in a row, it will alert me to where you are, kind of like a Point-Me spell. So I'll be able to find you if you need help."
"Draco, I am constantly with Blaise and Theo and especially you. Is it wrong that I'd like some alone time and friendship outside of my own house that isn't bogged down by the
"I can't... some of it is blurry. I could be mistaken about my charms. It all... happened so fast... and I was so concerned about Harry..." Draco stammered, struggling to explain. His emotions had been surging the entire time.
Draco moved back to the Shrieking Shack. He looked at it's image until he went cross-eyed, but only part of the house was covered by the map. He waited and waited, until finally a small, bendy line passed just over the boundary of where the map covered.
"Mr. Potter is already experiencing memory issues. Just moments ago, he did not believe that dragons existed, nor did he know what a Golden Snitch was." Dumbledore looked at them both gravely.
As the last of the students left the classroom, Harry watched Professor Quirrell straighten his back. With a flick of his wand, Harry heard the door click shut. He backed away from the Professor who stared at him. In a moment, his demeanor had changed dramatically from what Harry had known the past six months.
As he was counting the hours in his head, the soft padding of feet met his ears. "Dray?" A small voice asked.
The line passed further into the house. Draco's heart stopped. That was Voldemort's snake, wasn't it? Draco was almost sure of it. And if Nagini was there...other Death Eaters probably were too. Maybe even Voldemort...
She huffed through her nose, sounding almost as if her breath had been forcefully knocked out of her. A small poof of turquoise air left her nostrils, before Hermione's hair grew out significantly, she shortened around an inch and her face rounded out just a bit. The class clapped and she curtsied.
knows what they really are." Draco watched Harry, a smug smirk on his face. Harry nodded slowly, then stood up.
Harry smiled wider, pulling Draco in for a hug. He buried his face into his neck and pretending not to notice when Draco shivered and held him tight.
A table, with different potions. A wall of black flames behind it, and a scroll. Just as had been described.
"Professor Snape," Draco said, moving to the side to allow the man in. He saw Harry glare a little, but a pointed look from Draco made him drop it with a mumbled apology.
Draco took their questions much slower. Most days Harry wouldn't remember anything new, but sometimes Harry would remember little things. What house Neville Longbottom was in, what kind of bird Headmaster Dumbledore had, what his own patronus was.
The boy waved. "This is Neville, he's a first year like us. I said he could sit with us, if you wouldn't mind."
"Honestly," Draco murmured, "you look like a fawn, trying to stay upright and stumbling around, looking at the world through those stupid big eyes." Shaking his head, Draco murmured to himself. Harry thought Draco had consumed to many potion fumes.
"You will fly, tonight, to Azkaban. You will attack it's walls, and free my followers. Pettigrew, you'll have the extra brooms hanging from your own, do not lose them," Voldemort spoke softly, a snake winding around his arm. It hadn't been there when Harry began his second year, but the few times he'd seen it over the summer it refused to talk to him. He seemed more attached to it than seemed normal, but... was anything ever normal?
Draco made sure Harry was out of sight before he turned back to Severus, eyebrows raised. Severus' face was grim and a hand rubbed his chin in thought. "It's worse than I expected," was all he said. Draco needed more than that.
"The Dark Lord has great plans for the next task." Moody said, eyes feverish. Understanding dawning like the flick of a switch, Harry steeled himself. He looked Moody -who seemed to be waiting for something- in the eye, and made his voice curious despite the disgust in his stomach.
Dumbledore remained quiet. Draco was ready to start tugging on his hair again. "Please, Headmaster. I couldn't do anything, I don't know what to do. He's g-gone. Harry's gone," Draco said quietly, staring at his hands.
"The Ministry sure seems to think so, with all those dementors they have everywhere." Harry stood, wiping the snow off his pants. He gave Snuffles a pet goodbye, cast another heating charm on the dog, and dragged Hermione sadly beside him.
"You're wrong. I stay with Draco Malfoy over the holidays. His father used to know a lot of Death Eaters, and he got really mad when the Daily Prophet called him a Death Eater. And then he talked about knowing Pettigrew, and how, uhm..." Harry paused, trying to remember the words. Lupin seemed glued to his seat, eyes as round as saucers.
Harry cried out a little bit, hands moving to his nose. Draco felt awful, but realized his nose did look a little straighter now. Not knowing any cleaning spells that weren't for clothes, Draco got a towel wet and started cleaning the blood and tears from Harry's face.
Draco had been in the midst of arithmancy when Professor Vector's lecture had been cut off by the door opening.
Harry didn't say anything. He didn't think he could. He was frozen in place, eyes flickering between the red eyes and the vibrant green snake that wrapped around his feet. The man pulled out a wand and pointed it at Harry, unwavering.
, though it shook and rained dust as he went down. Draco hurried his movements, able to see the trap door. He was
, Draco thought. Harry had finished his cup-licking it clean- and snuggled into Draco's side, one arm clutching his torso and the other holding Snuffles.
Draco paced in front of the statue, a distant part of him glad that it and Dumbledore would be the only witnesses to his puffy eyes and wrinkled clothes.
Draco swallowed the uncomfortable lump in his throat. He fell into a fitful rest in the early hours of the morning, unable to fall asleep until complete exhaustion took him.
Harry sighed, and nodded. "You're right. Thank you, Professor Lupin. I should get going, I want to study a bit before bed," Harry announced, picking up his bag from the floor.
He called Dinky again. "To Professor Snape, please." She popped away as he noticed Harry lingering in the doorway. He seemed a little less pale, perhaps, but the bruise still stood out on his skin. Draco realized he had forgotten about the healing balm after what happened at breakfast.
Harry stared at him for a moment, hearing the yells of the others growing increasingly distant. They were flying away without him. Harry flew next to the man, Sirius.
"See if it fits," Harry urged. Draco slipped the silver band around his right ring finger, fitting it snugly. The single silver gem shone in the moonlight, twinkling blue in some facets.
"He's really well behaved. It's... it's almost like he can understand us," Hermione said as they walked back.
Now that he was ten and had been able to get his basic necessities out of the way, he was beginning to buy some other stuff that he needed. A new toothbrush made him feel better all over, and a hairbrush calmed his hair down so he wouldn't stand out so much.
Draco found packets in one of the cabinets, using a spell to boil some water. While it mixed, Draco moved in front of Harry. "Hey, why don't we change and then drink on the couch, okay?"
Harry smacked him, which Draco ignored. "She's smart, helps me a lot with my schoolwork. And she is actually a decent person. And, oh yeah, I enjoy her company, unlike some," Harry drawled, raising his eyebrows at Draco as a challenge.
Draco had been more help than Harry had expected. He was happy to play chess with Harry any time he liked, and gave him lots of tips. Draco also knew lots of defensive and offensive spells, and didn't mind teaching Harry when he had the time.
They arrived in the middle of the room. Madam Pomfrey bustled over from behind her desk upon seeing them. "Lay him on that bed there, Mr. Malfoy," she instructed, pointing to a bed next to him. Draco lay him gently, feeling like he was letting go of something precious when he stepped away.
Harry nodded, looking better. Draco kissed the top of his head, feeling like the most natural thing in the world. Harry gave him a shy smile as he walked away.
"Shouldn't we tell Professor Lockhart first? He is the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, he deals with dark creatures all the time," Hermione said, quickly putting her things away.
had faded, but not completely. It was almost gone on Draco's pale skin, but Harry had a darker tone that held it better. "I'm fine, Draco." Harry said quietly. Draco shook his head.
Harry knelt on the cold stone floor. Draco was on his left, while Lucius was on his right. Several others formed a broken circle around Voldemort's throne. The gaps were significant. Voldemort looked angry, staring at them, but there was another glint in his eye, one Harry couldn't place.
"I have found some traces of my own magical signature and darker ones. It came back with a more specific area than I thought it would. They have not moved him far. Currently he is near Hogsmeade and the forest that runs along its edge, around a kilometer in each direction."
Draco placed a few alarms around Harry's bed, and went into his own room to take a shower. Perhaps the potion fumes had gotten to him. He wasn't acting like he should, around Potter.
Hermione looked where he was looking, sighing sadly. "Such a shame our trips are so much shorter than they're supposed to be. You don't think one of those criminals are really going to try and attack Hogsmead, do you?" Hermione looked at him, still petting Snuffles softly.
Overall, Harry had become better friends with Draco over the course of the last school year than Harry could have imagined.
Dinky brought them to where the corridor branched off into a large alcove, scarce of paintings except for one. It held an older gentlemen, with a strong posture, hard eyes and an unwelcoming face. Sharp canine teeth poked out of his mouth, his black hair starkly contrasting his pale skin.
His wand felt better in his hand. It hadn't felt right before, like it was wrong and didn't like him. This was like the first time touching it in Ollivanders.
Draco had no idea what he meant, but he nodded anyways. "What does that mean for Harry, though?" He looked at the potion in his hand. The color did look very similar, if he was remembering correctly.
Dumbledore asked a few questions, some of which Draco struggled to answer. Eventually they circled to Harry's...changes. Which brought up the worrying question of Harry turning back to normal. "I would have to make changes to my current potion to accommodate for the snake venom. It could take weeks, maybe months of experimenting," Snape said quietly.
He couldn't get enough. Harry pulled away and Draco followed him, kissing his cheeks and nose and jaw and anything else he could reach, muttering all the while and listening to Harry giggle.
His head itched, like it did when he was trying to remember something at breakfast. He knew him, he made Harry tremble and want to hide, but he couldn't remember him. He wished for Draco's soft encouragements and prodding, for his smile and nice eyes even when Harry couldn't answer questions right.
The thing was so thin, and Harry agreed that it seemed to be shivering. "Hey, it's okay buddy, I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?" The dog didn't react, but Harry carefully cast the same warming spell on the dog. Immediately, it shook out it's fur, tongue hanging out of its mouth in what looked like a smile. It approached Harry, nuzzling his open hand.
A small rustling of sheets met his ears before a puffy-faced, red-eyed Daphne walked out, head hung low and cradling her arm.
Harry scowled, but did so. He realized how close they were to the Hospital Wing, and quickened his pace. He pushed against the large, swinging double doors with effort. One began to creak open, before it flew open easily and Harry stumbled. He looked back, confused, and glared at a smirking Draco, who had one hand on the door.
Dumbledore rubbed his beard, leaning back in his chair. "Then tell him that he is confined for his own health. As little as you can while making sure you get out alive." Dumbledore's voice was grim, Severus' face even more so.
"Can't you cast some sort of advanced tracking charm? Something that could penetrate wards and charms and things? A Locating charm?"
There weren't any obvious displays of accidental magic, Draco hoped that meant this nightmare wasn't so bad. He sat on the edge of his bed, realizing Harry was whimpering and crying again. Draco felt utterly hopeless as he watched him. Draco crawled under the covers, pulling Harry close against his body.
Maybe Harry was being pessimistic. Maybe part of Voldemort's plan was going to fail. Maybe Moody would blow his cover, and one of the teachers like McGonagall or Lupin or even Dumbledore would find out and stop him. Harry doubted that, though. His and Draco's part had, unfortunately, been implemented seamlessly; starting his encouraging Hagrids interest in dangerous and highly lethal creatures, and ending with some of those creatures being tampered with before their placement in the maze. Harry preyed no one would run into one of the Blast-Ended Skrewts that had been modified with venom and very good jumping skills.
Draco smiled. Harry didn't like it. "My last name. My blood. The Malfoy's are an ancient Pureblood line. That means we've only had wizards in our ancestry. Not a single filthy Muggle among the bunch. We're extremely powerful, everyone looks up to us."
"There is a Quidditch tournament soon. Malfoy, you'll take the boys. Crouch will go with you in disguise. Afterwards, burn it to the ground. I don't care how, and don't incriminate yourselves. Light your own sleeping quarters if you must. Crouch, the mark. Don't be caught, I don't care who you have to kill."
He wasn't about to squander it. He held Harry's jaw carefully, leaning forward slowly and watching for any sign Harry changed his mind. Harry met him halfway, grabbing his shirt and pulling him forward.
Harry made a humming noise. The boy almost sounded like a family Hagrid had mentioned, one of the dark ones.
"Here we go," Draco said, handing Harry his mug. He'd put a cooling charm on it so Harry wouldn't burn his hands or his tongue. Draco had never seen his eyes be so wide.
"Potter? Potter!" Draco called, unsure of what he was supposed to do. He fluttered around Harry, accidentally crushing the teacup that Harry had dropped. Harry slumped on the couch, head at an awkward angle, chest heaving with ragged breathing.
Harry stood next to his bed, which was a four-poster like Draco's, but lower to the ground. There were a few stuffed animals on the bed, and Harry held one of a black dog.
The man that was holding him scoffed and held Harry out. Harry gasped desperately for air, eyes falling closed and head tilting as he was suddenly very light headed. But then sharp, cruel fingers dug into his sides and he was being held like a baby and looking at the woman. She smiled down at him, mouth stretching unnaturally wide across pale and cracked skin.
"Fine, Professor, thank you. Sorry for the confusion, but why am I here, exactly?" Draco did Not Look at Harry who was most certainly Looking at him.
What's her name?" She asked excitedly. Harry laughed a little bit, he'd never met someone so enthusiastic and...nice.
"Don't be an ass, Harry. You look like you're a breath away from collapse." Draco shook him, leading him away from the Great Hall and towards the common room. Harry allowed it because it was near Snape's office and he wasn't actually sure if he could fight Draco off right now. He didn't think he wanted to.
But Harry had bigger concerns. It was Draco's birthday in a few days, and he was rarely allowed to leave the manor and would be unable to get him a gift. Not that either of them had really had birthdays the past few years, but Harry knew Draco would appreciate a gift.
Professor Slughorn chuckled a little sheepishly. “I may have forgot to mention that injuries sustained at that particular time do return. As this potion does not simply change your features, it changes your entire body chemistry from a year's time. This includes maturity through puberty, hair, height, scars, and so on.” Slughorn smiled bashfully, as if forgetting that he didn’t tell the class that an assignment had been pushed back. “Now that we have that out of the way...would anyone else like to volunteer?”
"I... I don't know, Harry. I hope it doesn't though, and I'll be right here if it does. I promise you'll be okay."
Draco's shoulders slumped. He leaned his forehead against the cool tile of his shower. This was useless. Draco pulled himself together and made himself comfortable in his room, settling down with his arithmancy essay
"Lemon drops," Draco spoke, voice cracking. When the statue didn't move, the dread in his stomach grew. "Bertie Botts. Licorice wands. Sugar quills. Blood pops. Sherb-"
Harry stumbled out of the room and to the dungeons. As he was passing the Great Hall, he ran into Draco, who ran after him, grabbing his arm.
He opened his eyes, and there he stood again, holding the stone. His reflection put it in his robe pocket, which suddenly felt a little heavier. Harry reached into his own pocket, pulling the stone out.
He entered a dark room, the only illuminated thing being a chess board where the pieces were all twice his size.
"I just- I just need to tell him, and then I think so." Harry swayed again, dangerously close to falling. Draco caught him and held him tightly.
"My original potion that would've had some effect on Potter before should be done sometime today. I will send that one to you once it is. Have Potter take it, and tell me what happens. I'll start on a new one immediately," Snape said quickly. Draco nodded, still rubbing Harry's back.
The troll wobbled, and fell over. Harry darted pasted and closed the door behind him, realizing how nice the clean air was now that he had it. He took a moment to gather himself once he realized there was no immediate danger.
Their biggest milestone had happened over a week after Harry had taken the potion. Harry had proudly declared that Professor McGonagall could turn into a cat; Draco thought that was a small detail, and was extremely happy Harry had recalled it.
At first, Draco had had to smother his laughter, but as Harry's trembling turned to convulsions he began to worry. He sat up in his chair, leaning over the cursed cauldron as he and the rest of the class wondered if they were about to see the end of the Boy-Who-Lived.
Malfoy eventually came out, robes clean and nose straight. Harry stood up, taking satisfaction in the way Malfoy flinched.
They stopped at a closed door at the end of the hallway. It opened with a horrible creaking, though Harry could see no one in the doorway. Once in the room, Harry was dropped on the rough floor. Crying out, Harry backed himself into a corner, wincing at the splinters that had hurt his hand.
His wand wasn't in his pocket. Panic overtook him so much he choked. Harry's screams pierced his ears. "LET ME GO! DRACO! DRAC-"
"Harry!" Hermione cried out. Her high pitched voice rang throughout the classroom. Professor Slughorn stood on the side worriedly. Like the students, he didn't do much besides stand on the side and watch Harry tremble, though he did prepare another numbing potion along with some other potions his panicked mind thought might be needed.
"Can I ask you something?" Harry's voice was quiet, but confident. Draco nodded, watching his thumb stroke Harry's jaw. "When you said you could do anything for me... did you mean it?"
had worn off, maybe he had stepped outside of where he cast it because he was distracted. Either way, a floorboard underneath his foot let out a deafening creak as he stepped on it. Draco almost dropped Harry from the surprise.
"It's the dementors, 'Mione. I know they're only at the entrances, but it seems like..." Harry trailed off. Hermione gave his arm an encouraging squeeze, and Snuffles nudged him as well. Harry gave a tired smile, slowly petting Snuffles. "They're so
Draco laughed a bit, surprising himself and Harry. He shook his head, pouring himself another cuppa. "I might come to like Hagrid a bit."
"I mean... we could try. He'll be able to see through it, and he's a really smart dog, you know that 'Mione. Besides, you'd rather let him go hungry than risk a little detention?"
"You really should keep your door locked, you know, given all the," Harry paused, "unfavorable company we're keeping now."
Shaking his head a little, he turned away from Draco. Madam Pomfrey cast several spells, a list Harry didn't understand appearing besides her.
"There is no way I just did the stupidest, most Gryffindor thing ever in my family just for you to not make it out of this," Draco muttered to Harry. Dirt fell from the ceiling, choking him as he ran.
"He isn't my lord, Draco. He'll never be. I'm not letting that happen," Harry muttered, stabbing an innocent croissant with a fork.
"Well, Malfoy, I will have to ask you to leave the compartment," Harry said nonchalantly, not reacting when Malfoy stood as well, outrage on his face.
Looking around himself, Draco tried to remember the last time he had it. The living room, wasn't it? Swallowing roughly, Draco walked into the living room.
Draco let out a small noise of frustration. He walked up the spiral staircase, intending to take a hot shower to help his nerves, but he swerved into Harry's room instead. Draco walked quietly into the room, getting an odd twinge in his chest when he realized how small Harry looked in the four-poster bed.
Dinky looked back at Harry, a wide, watery smile on her face. "Yes Sir Potter! You are very kind, you do not need to thank Dinky!"
Harry stopped breathing. He couldn't tell where it was coming from. It sounded like it came from... everywhere. He covered his ears, trying to block it out, to muffle the voice. It eventually went away, and Harry gave a sigh of relief.
"Mr. Malfoy, if you could stop wearing a hole in the rug, that would be appreciated. Why don't you put yourself to use and tell me what happened here?" Madam Pomfrey spoke sharply, otherwise ignoring his presence.
She popped up immediately next to Dumbledore with a bright smile. Draco stood, holding Harry against his chest tightly. He thought Harry might push him away, but he seemed fine curled up against Draco, his little arms wrapped around his neck.
It was dark when they arrived. The manor cast huge shadows upon the grown, swallowing the nature within reach. "You'll both be going to your rooms immediately. There are brooms in there. You've been instructed to practice broom-riding relentlessly this summer. The Dark Lord has plans, and this time you'll both be involved. I trust you won't disappoint him," Lucius told them.
Harry slowed his broom at Lucius's signal. They surrounded the building, Harry following closely behind Pettigrew. Soon they were in position, the highest level of the back of the building. The person Harry assumed was Dolohov went around the front. Seconds after he left Harry's sight, a loud
His eyes were puffy, his cheeks bright red. Silence had descended while Draco worked -there was a lot of blood- but when Draco was done Harry spoke softly. "M'sorry, Dray."
"I trust you to figure out the details, Potter. Do not disappoint me, and do not tell anyone. If you do fail, well... poor Draco will have to pay the consequences, won't he?"
Abruptly, Draco turned, shoved his wand into Harry's face and murmured a quick spell that shrunk his glasses to be proportional to his face. Harry stared up at him, startled and confused. Draco didn't look back down at him, instead choosing to immediately continue walking, leaving Harry to jog slightly to catch back to up him.
They walked down a corridor that seemed to go on forever, taking so many twists and branching off in so many places that Harry knew he was lost within the first two minutes. It finally opened up into a large alcove. Within the alcove sat a throne, tall and made out of what Harry thought was obsidian. It was all rough edges and hard cut, except for the top of the backrest which ended in a curling, looping design.
Hermione furrowed her brow and skimmed the rest of the page. "It doesn't say. There's probably a book on it somewhere though," she snapped the book shut, eyes roaming the shelves. "But, we have to tell the professors. Now that we know what it is, they can do something about it, can't they?"
Harry nodded, pulling the cloak out of a bottomless pocket in his robes. He cast a tracking spell on Snuffles, connecting a blue light between him and the dog that only Harry could see. "When did you learn that spell? It was never taught to us."
Harry lunged to crab a corner of the desk, catching himself as his foot got tangled in his pant leg. He looked up at the professor with a frown, face flaming as half the class cooed and the other half laughed. "Oh dear, those are a little big now, aren't they? Yes, yes..." Slughorn gave a forced chuckle at his attempt to lighten the mood, before quickly dropping the amused expression and murmuring a few words to readjust Harry's clothes
Draco frowned, and grabbed a plate to make it himself. He put two pancakes, some bacon, a piece of toast, and a few eggs on it and slid it over. He realized that Harry wouldn't be able to eat the entire plate at his size. He probably wouldn't have been able to eat it at sixteen, either. But Draco knew that this was what he normally ate -embarrassingly enough- so he went ahead with his gut, ignoring Harry's wide eyes.
Harry stepped into the shower to warm himself. He'd been hearing that voice too often in his dreams. He was beginning to have worryingly dark circles. Hermione was starting to bug him about asking the school nurse for a sleeping drought. Neville said her name was Madam Pomfrey and she was nice, if a bit stern.
"Thank you, Mr. Potter. If you do not mind, I would like to speak to Mr. Malfoy alone for a minute?" Harry was gone before Professor Snape had finished speaking. He didn't scare Harry like Uncle Vernon did, but he never did like being around adults.
He heard a pleased hiss, and a shuffling of robes from behind him. Voldemort clapped. "Well done. You've grown more vicious than I expected, though there is still room for improvement in you. How would you like a special task, Harry?"
"Yeah, c'mon. We can finish our essays after dinner if you'd like, but I'm almost done. Figure we can finish tomorrow, yeah?" Harry looked up from where he was putting his text books in his bag.
"I'm scared." Harry whispered. He was looking up at him with wide eyes. Draco picked him up easily, feeling better as Harry wrapped his arms around his neck and his legs around his waist.
"What happened Harry?" Draco asked, moving Harry's hair away from his eyes and wiping his tears away with his shirt. Harry shook his head, but his sobs were a little quieter now. Draco realized he wasn't going to talk until he calmed down, and Draco didn't want him to be in pain.
Harry punched him. Malfoy fell to the ground, clutching his nose. "Blaise, get him!" Malfoy cried out. Harry looked at Blaise, the dark skinned boy from the train, who took a small step back from him, raising his hands. "What the hell, Blaise?" Malfoy yelled, standing up. His nose was bleeding, the rug and his robes now dotted with red.
"On the train to Hogwar- wait, no, we met when we were getting our robes fixed, in Diagonally. In...Madam Malkin's, right?"
Harry wrapped his scarf tighter around his neck. Hermione walked next to him, fascinated by the shop windows. Trinkets floated, horns blew, clothes twirled themselves, self-inking quills displayed their abilities in an elegant font, tea pots filled teacups with precision. It was the most concentrated hub of pure...
Snape sighed, rubbing his temples. "What exactly did she do to deserve your vengeance? You haven't been particularly violent before."
Voldemort collapsed. The Death Eaters that had been behind him stopped in their tracks. One raised their wand, a
She had to know something more was going on to Harry than just clumsiness, Draco was sure. Draco returned to his meal, setting aside the balm and a green bottle. He was almost done by the time Harry stepped quietly around the corner, pausing at the entryway. Draco wouldn't have heard him if his back had been facing him.
"You will fly immediately back. I expect you before sunrise. Leave." Voldemort waved a dismissive hand, and Harry and Draco ran to get their brooms.
now that he was...normal? He looked down at himself to check. Normal feet, normal hands, normal legs. He looked back at Draco. "Is he..."
Harry ignored that instruction. He set alight flags, lawn decorations, just enough to where no one would punish him for not participating.
"See, but mine if better, watch," Draco said, grabbing Harry's hand and pointing to the gem. "Yours is well, cute, but mine is truly useful," he flounced the hand that wasn't holding Harry's around dramatically. "If you press on this
Harry walked out of the library, slowly moving to the great hall. What did it mean that he could speak Parseltongue? It was a hereditary trait, the book had said, but...that didn't make much sense. Harry looked up at the high ceiling of the corridor.
Draco waited, but as Harry remained unconscious and no shimmer covered him, Draco found his heart leaping into his throat, choking him. "Dinky!" He called, standing with Harry tight in his arms. The little elf popped up with a smile. "Hospital Wing!" He barked. Dinky jumped, taking his hand.
"I-I could be wrong, Professor. That's just something I overheard Lucius say. And even he could be wrong, he was talking about stuff from, like, a decade ago." Harry knew he was absolutely right about Pettigrew being a Death Eater. And he knew Sirius wasn't one, he didn't have the Mark. But he had to convince Lupin about that without giving it away.
on the trapdoor. There was no telling how old this thing was, he didn't want to take a chance by alerting anyone in the house because of a creaky door. He cast notice-me-not charms, a disillusionment charm, another
. Eventually Madam Pomfrey was satisfied. "I would say you owe a very nice thank you card to Professor Snape, Mr. Potter," she said with a nod. "Do try and rest. Today is a Thursday, you aren't expected to start making up for your classes until Monday. I would visit the Headmaster soon." With that, she left behind the curtain and flicked it closed.
- and yanked him close. He crushed Draco's lips with his own, or at least tried to. It was only a moment before Draco was kissing him as feverishly as Harry was. When Harry pulled back, he was breathing heavy and his heart was racing faster than when he'd killed Voldemort.
Daphne screamed and fell to her knees. Professor Slughorn rushed to put a spell on her arm to keep it from moving, and gave her a small potion that seemed to be for numbing. He called over her desk partner quickly, and Parvati assisted her out of the room and into the hospital wing.
"That makes sense. Happened to me too once, a long time ago. I didn't get a nosebleed though, just woke up really confused as to why my head was hurting. I had a big head as a kid, so gravity took me face first," Draco joked, smiling and nudging Harry with his elbow. Harry smiled at him, then closed his eyes and leaned into Draco's hand in his hair.
Harry knew which bedroom Pettigrew slept in. He'd been watching, waiting. And tonight would be his opportunity.
Harry gasped awake, blinking around the room with squinted eyes. It only took a moment for him to find Draco. As soon as he did, Harry launched from the bed to Draco's chair, wrapping his tiny arms around Draco's neck hard enough to make him choke.
"It tastes like farts," he complained, snuggling tighter into Draco and handing him the bottle. Draco set it on the nightstand, wanting to laugh but feeling like he would vomit if he did.
He went to his room to grab the letter he had started last night, returning to the living room with more paper and a self-inking quill. Tossing the old note away, he started anew.
We have to find him!" Draco shouted. Dumbledore gave him a single look, and Draco felt shame filling in as the rage drained. He sat back in his chair, limp. He couldn't bring himself to apologize. Dumbledore didn't seem to expect him to.
"The potion is called Fes-Festina Tempus, and it reverts the drinker to a younger age," Fay Dunbar said quickly, a tall girl with long brown hair.
A single projection hovered above the maze: a camera into the center, where the shiny golden cup rested. Harry hoped that whatever happened, it wasn't as bloody and crude as Voldemort had been in the past.
"Oh!" Hermione exclaimed. She jumped up, and Harry helped move her trunk up onto the rack above his.
Grumbling, Harry drank it while pinching his nose. It didn't even smell that bad, Harry just wanted to make him feel guilty. He handed the empty potion back with a grimace -which Draco was sure was also fake- and Draco set it on the bedside table.
Someone hissed. Harry looked up, finding a man that had blended into the shadows so much Harry hadn't seen him in his panic. He stepped into the moonlight from the window, red eyes glowing like fire.
"Uhm..." Harry trailed off. He'd gotten better at the Quidditch ones, but again, that could be because Draco always answered his own questions if Harry couldn't. He hoped to spark something, but it never did. "That golden ball-thing in that flying game," he said with confidence.
. When had everything changed so much? When did it start feeling like Harry belonged with him, tucked into his arms and sleeping on his chest?
"You will both be sleeping in that room. Once she returns, you will be shown how to get there and the password. Your things will be moved up there shortly. Mr. Malfoy, please do calm yourself, red doesn't suit you as well as it does Fawks." Chuckling, Dumbledore smiled at the two of them.
Draco stepped in slowly, first noticing how much taller Professor Dumbledore seemed behind his desk, and then the two empty chairs in front of him.
"Maybe I just don't know why you continue to prefer the Mudbloods company over ours. Are we not good enough for you, Harry?" Draco sneered. Harry reeled back in his seat. Draco hadn't used that word in private since second year, and he hadn't been this aggressive towards Harry since their first day at Hogwarts.
He laughed almost hysterically as he free fell, before he easily regained control, diving to the ground. It came closer and closer, until he was forced to pull up at the very last moment. His foot skidded across the ground as he flew level. He did two laps around the pitch, letting him momentum carry him as he leisurely flew. Harry eventually slowed, and came to an easy stop.
He felt lonely, and vulnerable. Draco had been safe and protective and had taken care of him. It felt so natural to cuddle and hug him. The fuzzy feeling he had in his chest was still there when he looked at him, but now it felt more mature.
He barked at them, jumped around them in a circle, and cuddled up to Hermione, and then Harry. The happy dog had them laughing loudly for several minutes. "Oh, I wish Hogwarts allowed dogs, he's just the sweetest thing!" Hermione cooed at the dog, who nipped at her.
Harry felt like he was about to collapse. He'd spent weeks working on this stupid wardrobe. He knew his schoolwork had tanked, that his teachers were disappointed of him because of it. He couldn't care less.
Harry realized the gems matched their eyes, and whether or not he had done that on purpose he had no idea, but it made his stomach burst into butterflies, so he didn't say anything.
"Mr. Malfoy," Dumbledore started lightly, "you cannot blame yourself. You do not know how they entered, and currently neither do I. Our priority is making sure they cannot come back and harm more students."
Draco handed Harry the slim package he had kept behind his back, watching with a smile as Harry set it on the table to unwrap it. A thin child-size broom was revealed. Harry's eyes glowed with awe.
Harry didn't answer, paralyzed by fear. He couldn't move. He couldn't twitch, couldn't make a single noise. There was something purely evil and sinister about this man, Harry knew.
Harry walked in front of Dinky and Draco, who had stopped a few feet from the portrait. "Hi Sir Mercy. You never told me you were an entrance portrait."
"No Master has ever wanted to shake Dinky's hand! Oh thank you Sir, so kind! Dobby is true what he says about Sir Potter!" She cried out.
Harry nodded after a moment, though he didn't let go. Draco was okay with that. This may be the last time he would get to hold Harry like this. He was going to savor it.
Harry took a deep breath, and wiped away a few tears. He spoke into Draco's shoulder, muffling his words. "There was a man, and he-his face was weird. And-there was this girl, with really long red hair. There was a lot of green, and she fell..." Harry sobbed a little, "he k-killed her, Dray, he killed her. I don't know how but he di-" Harry cried into his shoulder, and Draco held him closer than he realized he could.
"Come along, Potter," Draco said, his voice unusually soft as he led the way to the hospital wing. Harry quickly followed behind, wincing slightly as he tripped every few paces. He thought he heard Draco laughing at him from time to time, but every time he looked up at the man his face was a neutral as it always was.
The pain stopped, and Draco's chest heaved. He rolled, seeing Harry staring at him with tears streaming down his face. He reached out to Harry with a trembling arm, unable to move further. The one holding Harry vanished through the floo, the other following. The final one shook his head, before a red light was shot at him and his world went black.
"Harry, I'm going to try to fix your nose, okay? I don't know if it's broken but I want to make sure. It's going to sting a little bit, but then it'll feel better. Is that okay?" Draco asked quietly, still pulling Harry's hair out of his eyes repetitively since it seemed to be calming him down.
A house-elf popped into their room, holding out a potion for Draco to take. "From Professors Snapes Sirs!" He popped away as soon as Draco took it from him.
"Have you learned any spells yet? I've read through all my textbooks, and I've managed to practice a few simple ones, though they aren't much," Hermione asked, pulling her wand out of a pocket in her robes.
Draco bumped into a wall as he turned the corner. He didn't care. His mind was on a loop of Harry. How long had he been passed out? How long had they had Harry? What were they doing to him?
The man had been surprisingly quiet while they had rode over the ocean. It wasn't until they had started to see land again that he began to speak. When he did, Harry purposefully let himself gradually drift to the back of the group.
"I... I couldn't take the risk that he would be dead by the time Aurors got there. I-I knew a way in and I was quiet and we got out unharmed. I can't apologize for that, Headmaster." Draco looked back at Harry, brushing hair out of his eyes. He turned back to the teachers. "I couldn't let him down again," he said quietly.
, Snape." He exclaimed, breathing a bit heavier than he would like. He hadn't told anyone else about that, not even Draco. It was embarrassing, in a way, to know she had gotten the jump on him and he had to do something underhanded to get back at her.
Malfoy huffed, and flapped his robes as he walked out of the compartment, Blaise in tow. Harry let out the breath he had been holding, and hoped Hermione would come back soon.
, Draco thought, determination flooding him. He would find Harry, and Harry would be perfectly fine and healthy and not a hair on his head would be out of place.
"You'll get it Harry. Maybe we can continue next year. Professor Dumbledore said I'm going to be working here again next year, as long as my health holds." Professor Lupin watched him. Harry gave him a tired smile. "Harry, this is a spell seventh years are taught. Be nice to yourself, you've been working extremely hard."
"I..." Harry, hesitated, looking at the two of them to see if he'd be interrupted. Draco thought that was rather strange. He couldn't remember a time Potter didn't blunder through a sentence thoughtlessly. "I understand, sir, but what about my classes Professor?"
Harry hadn't moved or spoken. Draco frowned at him. "Why don't you sit down? I'm going to need you to take a potion for me."
Harry sat on a bench underneath a snow-covered tree, looking at the whomping willow ahead of him. Hermione was coming back with butterbear and a steak for Snuffles, who laid at Harry's feet with a warming charm on him. "Sirius," Harry spoke quietly, mindful of Hermione's impending return. Sirius perked his head up immediately. "I'm scared. And I'm angry. Lucius sent a letter to me and Draco a few days ago. He knows what the first task of the tournament is, and he expects us and some other Death Eaters to tamper with it. A lot of students could get hurt." Harry paused, taking a breath to steady his wavering voice.
Harry just sobbed. He couldn't have spoken if he tried. His throat felt like it had been torn to shreds. He wrapped his arms around himself, curling into the tightest ball he could.
She wiggled a blackened nail at him, cooing and shaking her hair. Harry winced as a greasy curl fell in his face. "Aren't you so cute and stupid?" She cackled, pinching his cheek hard enough to break the skin. Harry sobbed quietly, any hope he had fleeing him.
"Yeah, that'd be great. I don't really know anyone either," Harry smiled, "why don't we get your trunk in here so it isn't blocking the doorway?"
He stood in front of it, trying to make sense of what he was seeing. Himself, but...older? He was grown, with a beard, and someone blurry stood behind him.
Draco didn't know what to say to that. It was too many questions, too many variables, too many unknowns.
"Can I sit with you on the ride? I don't really know anyone," she asked, looking up at Harry. Though she seemed confident, Harry could tell she was a bit nervous.
He had to take that chance, and move fast. That was all he could do. The door opened without a problem. Draco was met with dust clouds and rotten wooden boards that made up the entirety of the floor, likely the house. Grimacing a little, Draco crawled out on his hands and knees, coming to a defensive stance with his hand in his hand immediately. There was no one.
Hand shaking a little, Draco pulled the cork off and handed it to Harry. He sniffed it delicately, grimacing. Draco didn't realize he had been holding his breath until Harry swallowed the potion and burped with a cry of disgust.
"Dinky," Dumbledore called out. Dinky the house elf popped into the room suddenly. Though Draco's eyelid was twitching steadily, he suppressed a laugh at how high Potter jumped out of his chair at the sight of the House-Elf. "Prepare a suitable room for these two lads in the Northern Tower. As quickly as you can, dear," Dumbledore addressed the happily tearing House-Elf with a smile.
After what felt like hours -but really couldn't have been- Draco saw small slivers of light in the distance. Without realizing, he had moved to a run. He slowed upon approaching, aware of how loud his pounding feet and heavy breathing may be, especially to a magical snake. He cast a quick
"BELLA!" The person next to her shouted. Harry assumed it was one of the other Lestranges, he didn't care to keep track of them, but by the time they had whirled around to curse him Harry already had a
The projection cut off, but not before the audience saw Krum in pieces, the spider picking a large hunk of the ground and eating it with its pincers.
Harry sniffed, wiping his nose on his sleeve. Draco almost wrinkled his nose in disgust, but controlled it so Harry wouldn't see. Finally Harry was sitting, and took the potion Draco offered him. His worry lessened, Draco picked up the bowl Harry had been holding.
Draco breathed harshly through his nose, glaring at Potter, who, of course thought this couldn't be his fault. Professor Slughorn arrived to peer over their cauldron, which he now viewed with a sort of...disappointment. He shook his head lightly. Draco was fuming. This was all Potter's fault.
"Look, Harry, it's Snuffles!" Hermione left his side, running to the shade of a tree where the dog lay. Harry followed at a more gradual pace, staring at the old wooden shack that was a few hundred feet from them.
"You gave me too many Eyes of Bat. The instructions clearly read half a dozen, and you shoved an entire handful of the tiny things into my palm!"
No, he wanted to be closer than them. He wanted Harry in his arms, tucked into his side. He wanted a grown Harry to smile at him and hold onto his shirt and call him 'Dray.'
Harry moved along the bookshelves, until he finally got to the enormous P section. For some reason, these shelves were sorted by title, not author, but that was convenient enough for him.
Most of the Death Eaters had died. Some had fled. Harry was banged up, but he was sure he'd be fine. He knew he was safe now. A lot of it had been luck; no one had suspected Harry to attack them, even after finding Voldemort's body.
Harry almost snapped his head up in shock. Minister Crouch? Last Harry had heard, the man had been denying any claim of Death Eater presence at any of the sites of ransacking that had happened lately. These ransackings tended to end in death, specifically of those that had claimed to be under imperius during the trials years before. The most recent had been the Avery household.
"Hi Madam Pomfrey." He said quietly, giving a crooked smile in an attempt to placate her. Her eyebrow did not lower. Harry looked at Draco for help, who was pointedly looking at the clock on the wall. Draco would be late for class soon.
"No, I didn't expect you to... a horcrux is very dark magic, Harry," Voldemort murmured. Harry felt Nagini circling around him, brushing his robes closer and closer. Harry didn't dare move.
Draco woke up on the floor, an ache in his muscles. Groaning, he reached for the table to pull himself up, confused when he couldn't find it. Opening blurry eyes, he realized it was knocked over, one mug and spoon staining the carpet, the other smashed near the fireplace.
Draco stared at Harry for a long time, though he never looked up from his plate. Draco realized Harry knew about the teeth, knew that they were wrong. Really, how
During breakfast the third day after Harry took the potion, Draco started the same way he always had the last few weeks.
It didn't take long for him to finish his quiet explanation. McGonagall went to check the wards for breaks or dark magic. Snape to seal the entrances, and Flitwick and Sprout to triple check and block all fireplaces that might have a floo connection.
Harry passed the Hufflepuff banner, looking behind him to see it flapping furiously behind him. He shot upwards, almost going to the clouds before he let himself fall backwards.
The dog almost knocked his head against Harry's with how quickly it stood. "What on earth made you think of the name Snuffles, Harry?"
He couldn't see any other doors or windows, couldn't see anything except a broken couch and the deep scratch marks that marred the entire room. Giant ones, as big as Harry's arm. He whimpered quietly, staring at a jagged one near his feet.
Draco nodded, eyes downcast. It confirmed his own suspicions, but it was still uncomfortable to know. Draco certainly hadn't made Harry's life better. And neither had Severus, come to think of it. His godfather had always been nasty to Potter in potions.
"How did you sleep?" Harry asked after a moment, looking a little awkward. Draco laughed in disbelief.
Draco wasn't sure how long he stayed like that until a throat cleared. Harry jumped, started, though Draco just glared at his godfather, who looked like he wanted to laugh at him.
"The basilisk is a type of serpent, known as the King of Serpents, that can grow on average fifty feet in length. It's ability to kill victims by staring at them had lead to it's deep affiliation with the Dark Arts,"
He walked down the next corridor, hearing the fluttering sounds before he saw them. He stepped into a cavern full of flying keys. A door he hadn't realized was there snapped shut behind him. Harry took a breath.
"Yes it is. Use the power wisely," Draco warned. Harry laughed a little, but then he was too busy drinking.
"This is a very serious situation, and I need both of you to help me. Mr. Potter is vulnerable right now because of his lack of magical ability, I think it best to keep him separated from the rest of the schools population. I'm sure you boys both understand what could happen if this news spread to unfriendly ears." Dumbledore looked down at them over his glasses, waiting for a nod.
Weasley's nickname for him- but accepted the gift with his nose in the air. Harry sat back easily and watched him open it. Thanks to this, he was able to see Draco's hands stutter when he saw it.
"Come along, Mr. Potter." Madam Pomfrey led him to an empty bed, ordered him to sit and stay. Lights flickered and flared as she cast diagnostic spells on him. "Which potion?"
"Now, before we continue, who remembers the name and the properties of this particular potion?" Professor Slughorn squinted throughout the classroom, where several hands had been raised. "Yes, Ms. Dunbar?"
Draco wasn't sure if he'd include that in his report to Dumbledore. It seemed pointless, along with telling him what his relatives called him. Well, unless it meant Harry wouldn't live with his Muggle family anymore. And that would be good, wouldn't it? Draco would have to think about it.
Draco changed his own clothes next, feeling almost like a new man with a freshening charm to get the grime from the tunnel off. Madam Pomfrey had cast one on Harry at some point, though Draco wasn't sure when. This day already felt too long.
"Okay, that's good. Do you-" Draco cut himself off, clearing his throat, "Harry, do you... know why you have a bruise on your chin?" Draco watched closely as Harry reached up to touch the bruise, and winced. His eyes dropped to the blanket and remained resolutely.
His vision started to dim. He heard the man say something, and saw a bright green light come towards him, before it reared above his head and he saw a flash of a pink tongue and sharp fangs.
Huffing, Harry pushed his glasses up his nose for what seemed to be the umpteenth time since they began their walk through the twisting stone hallways. That was something Professor Slughorn had forgotten to shrink, unfortunately. Harry considered taking them off, but considering how poorly he was adjusting to walking with tiny legs, he didn't want to make his probability of staying upright even lower. He just wished he didn't have to push them up every few seconds.
Draco held it in his hand for a moment. This might have fixed Harry completely before everything had happened. It might be completely useless now.
"But Hermione, you love research. And think of all the spells we'd learn! And we'd be able to feed Snuffles during meals and he could sleep in a comfy bed! And he'd be clean and everything!"
Harry's smile dropped a bit. He hoped she wouldn't freak out. "I'm Harry Potter. Nice to meet you, Hermione." Harry held out his hand, and she took it quickly.
"He said that Pettigrew was, uhm. I forget what he said, something about a keeper of something. And that he was a Death Eater. Had the Dark Mark and everything."
Harry nodded, hoping off the chair and walking calmly to his room. Draco felt like he was going to vomit. Harry would wake up normal tomorrow, probably hating Draco. They would go their separate ways, and it would be awkward, and Draco would be harboring affection for Harry that wasn't shared.
Harry's arms trembled as he placed an old necklace on the floor of the wardrobe. He took a step back, and bumped into the makeshift mattress he'd been sleeping on most weekends. Draco was getting increasingly worried about him, and as much as it hurt to know that he was causing Draco pain, Harry couldn't tell him. He couldn't stop.
"It's like that. Like I'm about to faint constantly. I hear these... they sound like screams, when I'm near them." Harry let himself lean on Hermione's shoulder, who wrapped her arm around him. Harry took comfort in it. He hardly had affection, this felt nice. Even Snuffles seemed to be trying to comfort him.
Once everyone had gathered and was sitting in conjured chairs -Draco in the middle, slumping and looking down to avoid looks from his professors- Dumbledore began to explain. He was far too calm, far too put together.
Hermione hummed a little, her brow furrowing. "I believe so, Flitwick taught us some household spells last year that included charms for pets. If he holds still, I think I can make his fur clean."
Some hours had passed and Draco's hand was cramping from holding his quill for so long -McGonagall wouldn't take the situation as an excuse to slack on his essays- when he heard a clang from downstairs.
Draco didn't look away from Harry as he spoke. Even now, the events felt far away. Unimportant. Draco told them he suspected Nagini bit Harry, and that was the cause for the mutations; instead of necessarily harming or killing him, it had perhaps mixed with the potion and changed him even further.
"Mr. Potter, if you will please sit down. I won't be here long." Professor Snape said, taking his own seat in a chair to the side. Harry returned sitting next to Draco, but he moved as far to the edge of the couch as it would permit.
"Would you like to explain why it is my fault instead of trying to kill me out of the corner of your eye?" Harry murmured, a sigh heavy on his lips and eyebrow quirked in question.
"Potter will be vulnerable for another two weeks, at least. That leaves plenty of room for him to take action. I have to give him some information next time he calls or I will likely not be returning." Severus spoke at a whisper, coming to a rest with his hands gripping the back of a chair harshly.
After a moment of regaining his composure, momentarily disrupted by the 'foul mouthed' Slytherin, Professor Slughorn continued his walking around the room, eventually gliding over to his prized students desk. That desk also happened to belong to Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter.
Harry zipped off into the  night, quickly catching back up to the pack. He watched them carefully, though no one seemed to notice his sudden rejoin.
"Yeah, it's funny. He is really well-behaved," Harry paused for a moment, looking at Hermione sideways. "Think there are charms that could let me keep him without anyone else knowing?"
Draco sniffed, refusing to look at Dumbledore. He didn't want to cry in front of him. "He might already be dead."
He ignored the mutations he could see, as much as it pained him. He didn't have the time to worry about it here. Snape or Dumbledore would fix it, but he needed to get Harry back to Hogwarts first, back to safety. He picked Harry up into his arms, carrying him like a toddler with Harry's head on his shoulder. Harry didn't move as Draco placed him, but his breathing was steady. He figured they must have put sleeping charms on him.
"You need to watch him closely, Draco. If anything seems unusual, take him to Madam Pomfrey immediately. Have a house-elf bring you. She knows exactly what's going on."
Draco didn't feel like going down to dinner. He wasn't hungry, his stomach was still churning from the incident. He should write Dumbledore, shouldn't he?
Before Harry could protest, the stern women held up a hand to silence him. Harry deflated slightly, nodding. "Before we get into all of that, take this." She handed him two vials, one an ugly light green and the other a dark blue. He swallowed them both quickly, shuddering. He felt the ache in his bones vanish, the pain from where his injuries would brush against his clothes gone. His stomach felt full and a headache he hadn't even noticed went away.
Harry wracked his brain. Was that a spell? An artifact? Something he had learned about, something a Death Eater had mentioned that he should know? Slowly, Harry shook his head.
Draco held his breath. "His canines aren't poisonous, just longer than an adult’s would be; I could easily fix them with a shrinking charm. The scales," she pointed to dull green patches on Harry's arms and neck and face, "go over his whole body in small patches. They seem like normal skin, just a different texture."
Harry swallowed, and hoped Voldemort didn't hear it. He'd probably mistake it for fear, rather than the disgust it was. "I would be honored, My Lord. What is my task?"
The snake launched at him as he grabbed the handle. Draco slammed the door shut, catching it's snout. It's hissing seemed to be the loudest thing Draco had ever heard as he cast locking charm after sticking charm on the door to keep it shut. He ran down the hall, unable to hear anything besides his own breathing and Nagini beating against the trapdoor.
Madam Pomfrey softened her stare, but only slightly. "Mr. Potter, you realize this is a safe area. You will not be harmed here," she said quietly. Harry refused to look at her.
Draco was astounded by how foolish his headmaster could sound sometimes, really. "Sir, I really don't think I'm the person you want for this. Potter and I don't have any...particularly platonic memories between us."
Harry bit his lip, before he dug into his bag. He handed Hermione a few gallons. "Go to the three broomsticks and see if you can find anything that we can feed it. Chicken or fish or something, and no cooked bones, they splinter and could choke him." Hermione smiled at him warmly, then darted away.
"Should we give him a name, do you think?" The large dog had his head resting in Harry's lap, ears perked in interest.
"A large, black dog, typically seen as an omen of death. I remember thinking all those years how fitting that was, considering..."
"Look, this isn't how I want this to go. I don't want someone that hates me sleeping next to me. So we can sort this out now, or you can sleep with your eyes open the rest of the year," Harry threatened him. Malfoy glared at him.
"What house do you think you'll get?" The boy prompted, seeming a little impatient already. Harry narrowed his eyes a little, unsure if he should keep talking to him.
"Oh yes, I do tend to keep it dim, Fawks gets moody if he isn't one of the brighter objects in the room. Why don't you cast a lumos so you can see better, I'm sure Fawks wouldn't mind." Dumbledore smiled at Harry reassuringly.
The two chatted for a while, before the compartment door opened again. There was a dark skinned boy, and behind him stood Draco.
When he woke up, it was to quiet voices. He sat up, rubbing his eyes and looking at the fuzzy figures. He reached around for his glasses, before they were gently put in his hand. He gave a small smile as suddenly Madam Pomfrey and Professor Dumbledore came into a...somewhat focus.
There was a pause. Dumbledore gave him a long look, and then a reassuring smile. Draco didn't feel much better from it. "The fireplace is completely blocked," he started quietly, "but I'm sure some extra precaution would help everyone's piece of mind. I will go with you, and ward it myself to the best of my abilities."
"Professor Snape will be here some time today, I think," Draco said as he set the balm down. Harry's eyebrows scrunched.
The cyclone started again only this time it whirled fast enough to make Draco's hair flutter, and he stopped that immediately. Instead, he tried what his mom would always do to calm him down when he was worked up. He moved his index finger to circle the ring of Harry's ear. He kept up for a little while, and the swirl of pillows and stuffed animals started to slow.
Harry twirled to avoid a stalagmite, curving along the edge of the wall. He was on its tail, so close...
you? Why do you know me? Why do you care?" Harry turned around to look at him, accidentally making his broom swerve to the left. Harry quickly straightened himself before someone ahead thought to check on him.
Indeed, many people thought it was a silly idea, but Professor Dumbledore had been adamant about making sure the teachers understood the new rules. Now, whenever a group project was introduced, teachers would arrange students from different houses to work alongside each other. Which,  two weeks into the new policy, had already erupted into several arguments.
Harry nodded, watching him closely. Draco touched his face as softly as he could, feeling like if he pressed too hard Harry would vanish. But he was solid, and
"Maybe Malfoy will get you it for the holidays. You two are good friends now, aren't you?" Hermione stood next to him, where he stared longingly at the shiny broom in the store window.
Dudley was pulled from school early. When Harry got home he was greeted by Uncle Vernon  ranting about how the floors of the playground were too uneven, and
Draco dragged his feet. Harry had already changed into his pajamas and was under the blanket, holding the stuffed dog. Draco pulled the potion out of his robe so he wouldn't crush it, climbing in next to Harry. Draco smiled as Harry tucked himself into his side like he always did. Draco would miss this more than anything, he thought. It would be weird sleeping on his own.
The change was miraculous. He seemed like a whole different dog, almost. His hair was trimmed, his fur clean, matted hair gone, teeth almost sparkling white, gunk cleaned out from around it's eyes, minor scratches healed. A few now-dead bugs fell out of his fur, though Harry almost vomited when the dog shook and more flew off.
"No no no no no no no," Draco muttered, lurching to his feet and falling, hitting the ground hard. Sobs shook his body, making him tremble as he used the couch to help him stand. Tears clouded his vision as he stumbled for the exit to his -
"He's angry." Draco said suddenly from his bed. Harry poked his head around his post to look at him.
After a moment, he saw her nod out of the corner of his eye. He let go of the breath he had been holding. "Thank you." He didn't think he would have left even if she argued, but his nerves were so shot he was glad he didn't have to fight.
Panicking, Draco looked for anything Harry could've hurt himself on. Did he hit his head when he fell yesterday? Were one of his stuffed animals stuffed with rocks? Had Draco hurt him? Dumbledore and Pomfrey were going to kill him-
The Hospital Wing was cold. Harry shivered slightly. He thought about casting a warming charm on himself, but wasn't sure how well he'd be able to do magic right now, so decided against it. Wondering why the Hospital Wing was so unreasonably cold, he kicked his dangling feet back and forth. Harry thought it might've been to discourage students.
Harry stopped listening. That dog had to have been Sirius. Harry almost laughed at the fact he had named Sirius after Sirius. This was... ridiculous. Sirius had...tricked him? Deceived him? Used him to get food?
"They always called me 'Freak'. But when I went to Muggle school for the first time, I heard my name was Harry Potter. Then I went to gringotts for the first time with Hagrid, and I learned my full name was Harry James Potter."
Harry went to his four-poster bed, seeing his trunk at the bottom of it. He noticed a moment later, that his bed was next to Draco Malfoy's, unfortunately. On Harry's other side was Theodore Nott, and the other three beds were occupied by Blaise Zabini, Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe.
, the potion that caused this," he paused, "ordeal. Like a muggle vaccine. I found it while I was researching different types of cures. The muggles have advanced in medicine impressively without magic."
Dumbledore had been replaced. McGonagall was now Headmistress, and Dumbledore suspended for a trail against 'endangerment to students.' Harry was mildly curious as to how the events would play out -Cedric had survived, and the tournament did have a bloody history- but it wasn't until another two months in August.
"Excuse me, Professor, but I do have classes I need to attend." Draco was getting a little irritated now, being ignored continuously. He had more important things to do than to contemplate the meaning of names!
He walked out, closing to the door to the sounds of groans behind him. Cracking open the scroll once more, he found his eyebrows raising.
"Were those on your bed or did Dinky get you some toys?" Draco smirked, though he felt a little bad about how embarrassed Harry looked.
"Nah, Malfoy is still a prat, I don't want to owe him anything. Maybe when it gets old and goes on sale I ca-"
"Are you okay, Harry?" Hermione asked gently. They sat on a bench that overlooked the shrieking shack. Harry suspected Sirius would be showing up soon; he hadn't seen him in awhile, and he was missing him.
He knew she didn't believe him, but either she knew him well enough not to pry or felt like she couldn't after the friendship had tapered off somewhat. Harry heard a bark nearby. He turned to see Sirius galloping towards them with his tongue lolling out of his mouth. Harry smiled, tears pricking his eyes.
"I asked Madam Rosmerta for some pork, without bones," Hermione said, looking a bit worried. "I hope they're okay. They're cooked, I'm not sure if uncooked meat is safe for dogs, but she specifically assured me there wouldn't be any bones."
Sirius jumped on him and licked his cheek. Hermione did her custom cleaning and trimming charms and gave him the leftovers of their meal at the Three Broomsticks. Sirius, happy, put his paws on Harry's shoulders and licked his face. Harry had started crying and hadn't realized.
"Yes, Professor?" Harry watched him fumble with the papers on his desk, organizing it in some way Harry couldn't make sense of.
Dumbledore sat at his desk, still in his phoenix pajamas. His elbows on the desk, his head resting on his hands. He watched Severus pace in front of him.
"Hi." He was frozen, unable to look away from Harry's face. It was so different, having him like this. Harry flushed from his gaze, which Draco liked quite a bit but didn't dare say.
"Draco Malfoy, Sir." Draco took a step back, worried about the portrait to his room hating him. He'd known him for two minutes and already knew not to put it past him to let Draco spend the night outside because of who he was. Well... that was fine, he supposed. He'd go and sleep in the Slytherin dorms. Without his clothes, or toiletries, and come back to a scolding from Dumbledore.
"Snakes. I can talk to snakes because I'm...a parselmouth," Harry sighed, leaning his head against the shelf.
Voldemort nearly cackle with glee when they returned, and Harry was sent to his bed with a very full stomach. They had done good, Voldemort had said.
Soon, a small fruit basket had been left outside the doors that lead to the Quidditch pitch, suddenly appearing. Audible footsteps walked away, with no body to accompany them. Not ten minutes later, a large dog lumbered to the area, barked at the dementors, picked up the basket by it's handle and trotted off towards the whomping willow.
"Nonsense, nonsense! I will not hear it! Mr. Malfoy, take Mr. Potter to the hospital wing or I will be forced to take away house points. I will not allow a student to walk to the hospital wing by themselves, and as partners you are responsible for each other. Now grab Mr. Potters things and off you go!" He huffed, watching with a raised eyebrow as Draco collected Harry's bag and cloak and walked stiffly out the door. He made a small shooing motion at Harry then, who sighed slightly before walking out behind Draco.
And if Draco ignored the voice in his head that told him he wasn't only doing this for Harry, well that was fine. The voice couldn't tell anymore else.
Draco took a breath to make sure his voice was steady. "Professor Dumbledore told me I should ask him some questions, since he seemed to be having some-some memory issues, or something." Draco hovered over Madam Pomfrey's shoulder, before her scathing glare sent him back. "It was normal, though I'm starting to think that his family wasn't so nice to him-"
she whispered, and with a snapping sound the sellotape unwound. She handed them back to him, a proud smile on her face. Harry was stunned. They were perfect! He'd been able to alter the lenses enough that he could see with the right prescription, but oddly enough he'd never been able to use magic to fix the frames. He gave Hermione a wide smile as he put them on.
"Hermione! Are you okay? I was about to go and look for you," Harry said. Her eyes were red and her cheeks were puffy but she smiled a little at his concern. Harry then noticed the boy behind her, a nervous looking boy with blond hair. "Hello there."
"You should be finishing up now. Please bottle up a sample of your potion and write your name on the bottle before turning it in! Neatly, mind you! And don't empty your cauldrons yet!" Professor Slughorn announced. Soon the sounds of quills scratching and clinking bottles filled the room. A murmur of voices penetrated the humidity, of people groaning and complaining and wondering just what they had done to make the universe hate them.
"He's a useless teacher, Hermione, you know that. McGonagall is a better choice," Harry said, "you two go and tell her, I'm going to stay here and see if I can figure out what a Parsel-thing is."
He gave Harry his clothes, who changed in the living room. Draco decorated their mugs with marshmallows and whipped cream, and brought them into the living room to see Harry already sitting on the couch and snuggling Snuffles.
Harry backpedaled into the compartment. "No, not at all. Do you need help with your trunk, Neville?"
Draco stopped. That was exactly what they needed. Somewhere no one would go. Somewhere people would be
"Wicked," she whispered, before she started to look a little panicked, "oh that must've been incredibly rude, I'm sorry if it was," she apologized. Harry felt a little better now, and smiled back.
"I'm okay. it's kinda disorienting, my limbs aren't the size they're supposed to be. And I think my glasses are the wrong prescription, things are still blurry." Madam Pomfrey tapped his glasses quickly, and suddenly Harry could see better than he ever had! He blinked rapidly to adjust to the change, giving Madam Pomfrey a grateful smile.
"And your name was?" Harry asked, maintaining eye contact with the boy once again. He seemed pleased by this, and Harry was extremely tempted to look away just because of that.
Draco let his head fall back on the armrest of the couch. The ceiling was a cream color with a smooth texture, and didn't budge under Draco's confused glare. There was an... odd feeling in his chest. It felt like it pulsed underneath his rib cage. His face scrunched up white he thought. He was almost repulsed by the
She nodded at him, her eyes softening a little. "Merlin knows what's happening to him right now. I gave him a potion, it should keep him asleep. A little extra sleep never hurt anyone," Madam Pomfrey sighed heavily giving Draco the feeling she was more worried about Potter than she let on.
He shined the light to the vines around him, and they shrunk away. He made a path out for himself, looking down the dark hallway ahead of him. He turned back to the Devil's Snare, seeing a vine moving towards his ankle.
. It was unnatural. Harry sat up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes as he stared at the trembling door.
For a moment he wondered what the second chair was for, until a high squawking sound drew his attention to a very large bird in the corner, who was nuzzling against a giggling Mini-Potter.
Harry gesticulated wildly as he spoke. Finally, he pulled his knees to his chest, buried his face in his knees and screamed.
Professor Slughorn was nearing their table, and Draco was panicking. The potion had become a woodsy dark green color that was absolutely unacceptable. It was supposed to be a soft turquoise, and just shy of being chunky. At the very least, the texture seemed...tolerable.
on it, but magical snakes were too different to regular snakes. The chance his spell would bounce off its scales was too great. Even if it did land, there was no guarantee it would do anything besides wake it up.
Once dismissed, Draco went to his last class of the day, arithmancy with Professor Vector. Draco was in a good mood as he walked into her class. He hadn't needed to worry about Potter at all, and was assured this matter would take care of itself without his needing to be involved or concerned, and a day where he did not need to deal with Potter was indeed a good day.
He felt stupid saying the password to a statue. He checked his surroundings quickly, only speaking once he was sure no one was around to hear him. "Blood pops."
Dudley ran at him, and Harry wound up his fist. He swung, and put as much force behind it as he could. As he collided with Dudley's nose, he felt something...
"That means that this potion could cure him, but it may also react negatively with what is already in his system. I added phoenix tears, which should ease the entire process."
Draco noticed a piece of parchment on his trunk, folded and addressed to him. Harry wasn't with him anymore, so he opened it.
Draco's head popped up. Harry stood in the doorway, still holding the stuffed dog, curling his toes.
Draco sat down on the couch to read, spending over an hour simply relaxing. He had almost forgotten about the Flying Fiend until Harry suddenly raced to his side, bouncing on the couch and elbowing Draco in the ribs in his haste. Harry snuggled into his side and fell asleep, likely exhausted from his flying. Draco smiled at him tenderly, one hand stroking his hair and the other flicking a few spells so that the book would float and turn its own pages.
"Why don't we relax first? Professor Snape said it would make you sleepy, so it'll be better for you if we're already laying down."
"Potter." Voldemort hissed. Harry rose from his crouched position to stand, but kept his eyes downcast. He hadn't expected this so close to returning from school.
He circled the tree again. He had no idea how close it would let him go until it attacked, but he kept a wide berth. It's swaying seemed to pick up; Draco had the distinct feeling it knew what he was trying to do.
"Erm, yeah, that's me. And sure, I guess." Harry pulled up his bangs, leaning back as she suddenly leaned closer to them than he expected.
Harry eventually decided to lay down, pondering at when Madam Pomfrey would be back. He fell asleep soon after.
Dumbledore nodded thoughtfully. He didn't comment on the dragons further. "Harry, tell me, what are the types balls used in Quiddich and what do they do?" He asked instead. Harry thought that was a weird question. Or at least, he did, until he began having difficulty answering.
"I know all the important ones. You're probably a Mudblood, then." Draco turned his head away from her, making a display of wiping the hand he had shook.
A moment later, he was warming himself in the soft glow of the firelight, smiling as the chill left his bones.
"Draco, sit down and calm yourself," Severus watched him until he did so, shame coloring his face red. "I think he'll remember everything up until the age he is now. Some extremely prominent memories will likely leave an impression for longer. There's no telling if they'll come back when the potion gets out of his system..." Severus trailed off, looking in the direction Harry had gone. "If it changes him back at all," he murmured.
"Your fellow students, who were affected by this creature are being administered a cure as we speak, and will be joining you tomorrow. In celebration, classes will be canceled tomorrow. Take the day to enjoy time with your classmates, your friends. Enjoy it as much as you can before finals come in just a few short weeks. Now, eat!"
Well, he didn't need both of them. But he had to admit, he was curious. "Both." It was probably some silly nickname, like how his own parents called him 'Dragon' in private. If nothing else, it might be decent blackmail for later, if it was embarrassing enough.
Snape nodded curtly, holding out a thin bottle with a wide base, a turquoise liquid sloshing inside. "I believe if Mr. Potter takes this tonight, he should wake up tomorrow normal."
Harry woke up with a gasp. His bed sheets were drenched with sweat, his hair stuck to his forehead. Harry stumbled out of bed, into the bathroom. He started a shower, realizing how dark and quite the rest of the dorm was.
Draco decided after a moment. He laid sideways on the bed so he could watch, feeling a bit creepy as he did so. He didn't care. There was no one to see him. No one to judge him. No one to know that he wanted Harry in his arms, even if he wasn't small anymore.
"Harry, Sirius Black was caught having killed thirteen people, including a good friend of ours, Peter-"
"Harry!" Draco tackled Harry, and then was laying on top of him, but Harry was too giddy to care. Draco grabbed Harry's face and kissed him roughly. Harry let himself relax for the first time in years. It would be okay. He had Draco, and that was all he needed.
"Almost dinner time, 'Mione," Harry murmured, gently blowing on his essay to dry the ink. He was almost done, he'd spend another half hour or so on it and it'd be ready by Thursday's class.
Harry sat on the Hogwarts Express, alone. The station was nearly abandoned. He was two hours early, after all. Vernon couldn't have been more excited to get him away. Now, it was just him and his newly named owl, Hedwig.
"I thought-I was-" he stopped himself. Draco nodded at him to continue. "You weren't... you were gone. And I was-I was hungry, I'm sorry, I won't do it again," he mumbled, almost to the point where Draco couldn't understand him.
Harry snorted, moving a bishop, which Draco quickly took with a rook Harry hadn't noticed. "Blaise still has a lot to learn if he thinks he's going to get one of those seventh year girls to go to Hogsmead with him." Harry shook his head, glaring at the chess board.
"And just who do you think you're talking to?" Malfoy asked, glaring at Harry. He was a little taller than Harry, and perhaps he thought that was an advantage, but if it came down to it, this would be almost a field advantage for Harry in fighting.
Harry slept for most of the day, only waking up for dinner and falling asleep again not long after. Draco took his dreamless sleep potion, holding Harry close. Harry held his stuffed dog. The time passed easily, though they hardly spent any of it in the sitting room. It was an unspoken agreement that they moved their lounging time to Harry's room, though Harry still used the entire space when he flew on his broom.
"Whatever it is, you're going to achieve it. You are so intelligent Harry. Nothing can stop you when you put your mind to it," Draco whispered in his ear, rubbing Harry's face with his ring softly. Harry smiled a little at the memory.
Harry had no idea where he went, now, but he'd once heard Nagini whisper about an old shack in the woods with bodies in it, something about it being gaunt. All that mattered was this was still where Pettigrew spent his free time.
Madam Pomfrey popped into the living room not five feet away from Draco. Poor Dinky looked traumatized. Madam Pomfrey shooed Draco out of the way, taking the towel with him.
His scar was an angry red, and bleeding quicker than Draco would’ve anticipated. He patted it with the rag, trying to stop more blood from getting into Harry's eye. It dripped down the side of his face, a few drops managing to stain his robes before Draco could staunch the flow.
Harry wanted more info about the man. He needed more than what he knew from that short ride with the man.  Sirius had said that he didn't deserve to go to Azkaban, that it wasn't his fault. He had rambled for five minutes, about dementors and something called a secret keeper, about the name Pettigrew and thirteen people. Harry hadn't understood most of it, but he was a little nervous to question a man who was behind him on a broom two hundred feet in the air.
Draco walked quickly, not wanting to leave Harry alone for long for some silly reason. He changed his own clothes and grabbed a different set of pajamas for Harry. He'd almost walked out before he stopped himself. Grabbing one more thing, he darted back. He put the stuffed animal -Harry had named it Snuffles and wouldn't explain why- on the table in front of the couch.
I do apologize if you aren't fond of the 'jumping around' scenes type of writing I do, but that is my style when I think adding transition would be redundant because the audience already knows the information - such that of one character telling another character something they just found out. That being said, I hope you enjoy this chapter!
Severus stood after a few moments of silence, approaching the floor. "I will start the antidote today, but there is no guarantee it will work, Draco."
Draco gave her a strained smile, looking towards Dumbledore. "Headmaster... are-are our rooms safe?"
"Up the staircase, on th- on the left." Draco watched her walk up, Harry floating precariously behind her. Draco flinched the smallest bit when it seemed like Harry would hit his head on the railing or wall, but he made it up unscathed.
Harry looked at him sleepily. His pupils were no longer slits. He frowned at Draco. "Why'd you wake me up?" he asked.
"Draco, I need you to teach me the best offensive spell you know." Harry stared at the boy, whispering to him, not knowing if he wanted Blaise or Theo to hear. Draco raised an eyebrow, leaning in as well.
"Sorry," Harry murmured. Malfoy snapped his head back to look at the mini-Harry, surprised by his words. "I think I'm kinda acting like I had when I was...whatever age. Five or somethin'..." Harry trailed off as he shifted his shoulder, a small wince contorting his face. Harry desperately hoped that he wouldn't have to stay like this for very long. He could feel numerous bruises on his arms and legs, and what he distinctly remembered to be a burn from a fire poker that had turned into a scar. He couldn't remember exactly what made Vernon believe that was necessary, but he remembered it happened soon after Petunia made him start helping with the flower garden in the backyard.
"How could you possibly not know? You're lucky you're a Halfblood and so powerful, or I wouldn't grace you with my company," Draco sneered, watching Harry closely.
Harry shook his head, and returned to Fawks who was nipping at his finger. Harry was reminded of Hedwig, and smiled. He needed to visit her.
is angry, and if we blunder his plans for the final tasks He-He might k-kill-" Draco stopped himself, hugging his torso. His eyes were red and puffy.
Harry quietly ate his dinner, having been given a regular portion since Uncle Vernon was distracted by his anger. Dudley cast quick, terrified glances at him the entire meal, but said nothing.
Harry swatted Draco on the side of the head. "Hey! You come into my room, wake me up in the middle of the night, and then have the
Draco realized he had no way to send the letter; his and Potter's pets were in the owlery and Draco wasn't comfortable with leaving Harry; them going together wasn't an option, if there was a chance a student would see them.
Draco pulled out the tattered looking parchment. Harry had shown it to him a few days ago, all he needed was his wand- where was his wand?
"I asked him about You-Know-Who and as soon as I said his name he freaked out. He grabbed his head and looked like he was in a lot of pain, and then he just-he fainted!"
Harry sat very still, thumbs twiddling softly in his lap. Draco wasn't sure if he'd seen first years hold that still before. "They're my friends," Harry started, sounding a little unsure. "I've never had any friends before, but they're nice to me."
The next few minutes were spent in silence. Harry never realized how far the hospital wing was from the potions classroom. Maybe it just felt farther, since he thought he was taking two and a half steps for every one of his normal ones. God, he hated this age.
Though Draco and Dumbledore exchanged a glance, Dinky wasn't phased at all. "I'm a House-Elf Sir Potter!" She told him happily, dancing on the balls of her feet. "We must be going now! I have to show Sirs how to get into your room!" Dinky held out her hands. Harry and Draco grabbed one each, and all three vanished with a soft
Draco could feel his palms start to sweat. He was beginning to think there was a much higher risk of something going wrong than Snape was telling him.
Madam Pomfrey nodded again, muttering something under her breath. "Please sit, Mr. Malfoy," she told him gently, pausing. Draco backed up, realizing he had encroached her space and had been hovering. He sat on the bed next to Harry, feeling like he would vanish if he looked away for a moment.
He worked diligently, Hermione sitting next to him working on the same essay. She wouldn't be assigned it until tomorrow, when her Ravenclaw/Gryffindor class would first have Snape's class. But that never stopped Hermione from wanting to get a jump on the homework. Harry sometimes wished his work ethic was like Hermione's, but maybe one day he'd get there.
Now with a full stomach, Snuffles trotted happily between Harry and Hermione. The blue light between them was Harry's only indication that Snuffles was actually there. They got to the entrance to the Quidditch pitch, where Harry removed the cloak and the spell from the happy dog.
"I don't want to be a part of this. I did everything you asked. I'll stay out of your way, I just want to be left alone," Harry pleaded. Voldemort's smile grew wider.
The mutt nipped at her. "I think he disagrees with you," Harry said, laughing. Hermione rolled her eyes.
"Why? There hasn't even been anything in the news talking about Death Eater activity." Harry sipped his glass, burning his tongue. Professor Lupin cast a cooling charm on it.
Harry hadn't sustained any visible injuries since the bruise on his cheek a week ago. Sometimes Draco thought he was in pain, but Harry never told him anything. He was more closed off than ever, quieter and more careful than any other child his age Draco had seen.
The statue slowly rotated, spinning on its axis to reveal a staircase Draco gracefully stepped on before ascending to a heavy wooden door with a large griffin knocker.
The map only covered the edges of Hogsmead. Draco almost ripped the map in half when he realized. Still, he diligently searched the names and houses, skipping by
"Yessssssss," Voldemort whispered, then remained silent. Harry waited for him to speak again -he would dismiss him if he was allowed- for long minutes until Voldemort stood and started circling him.
Harry let him crouch in front of him, Draco was glad to notice. He held out the potion. "It's just to help you get some of the nourishment that you need. Then you can eat. Madam Pomfrey just said to take it before breakfast. It's okay." Draco felt awkward and clunky crouching like this, having no idea of what to do. But Harry had stopped trembling and had taken the potion from his hand, so he thought he was doing alright.
In the corner of the room farthest from the snake, Draco could see the top of Harry's face, dried tears visible on his cheeks. Draco felt his heart lurch in rage and relief, almost running to Harry the moment he saw him.
Draco's eyebrows went into his hairline, a smile across his face. "Well well, Potter's finally got himself into some trouble, has he?" Draco laughed a little bit. "Oh, this is going to be fun. We'll practice tonight in the common room after curfew. Have you ever heard of the spell Depulso?"
"No, they didn't. Lucius Malfoy convinced him that we were too young, that it'd be too obvious at school. We're supposed to get Marked in a few years, though, but-" Harry paused,
His brows furrowed in confusion. He looked at the couch, seeing it empty and the blanket tangled around his legs.
The school did not match the enthusiasm of the music. The stands buzzed with murmurs, sounding so much like a beehive Harry shivered. They were all discussing the same thing:
"Couple sleepless nights, I've found that I can do really anything when I put my mind to it." Harry shrugged, enjoying the incredulous look Draco was giving him.
...Don't be mad? Or if you are, tell me about it! I get satisfaction from causing you anguish, I'll be honest. Have a wonderful quarantine guys! See you next week!
Draco held out a hand for Dinky to take. She did so excitedly, almost vibrating with joy when Headmaster Dumbledore grabbed her other hand with a smile.
"Professor Severus Snape, he was the potions teacher at Hogwarts for awhile until Professor Slughorn took over this year. But he's still the best at potions."
Draco shook the thought out of his head. Taking a quick glance to look for McGonagall, Draco decided he was clear, and began running again. Draco had to get Harry, he couldn't afford to run into teachers that wouldn't help him, who would insist he wait in his rooms until the Aurors came and helped.
Harry sat on a random sofa in Malfoy Manor. He was magically and physically exhausted, but the elation in his heart made him want to leap and bound across the room.
Harry strode out of the room, seeing Voldemort at the not far from him. Only Voldemort's surprise at seeing Harry alive gave him enough time to shout, "AVADA KEDAVRA!"
It was a long moment before he remembered that Harry's legs didn't reach his. He froze, afraid to open his eyes. Was he dreaming? Was he dead?
"What'd you do that for?" Harry asked, suspicion ringing out in his high tone. Harry coughed, swallowing a few times. His own voice was throwing him off.
Harry scooped Sirius into a hug and cried into his fur. He felt Hermione lay a hand on his shoulder and squeeze, and that felt reassuring too.
any better than you could before," he paused, stroking his wand like a beloved pet. Red eyes flickered back to Harry, pinning him down. "Would you like to test?"
Harry held his breath as the enchanted harp started to play. The giant monster growled, before it's eyelids slowly started to droop. Soon, it slept, one of it's giant paws resting on the trap door.
Dinky was back within minutes. Draco took the small parcel from her and set it on his desk. She popped away, and Draco sat on his own bed. The green sheets and oak wood made him smile, feeling a little bit more at home in the small space.
Professor Quirrell turned around, slowly unwrapping his turban. For a second, Harry wondered how stupid Quirrell thought he was. He wasn't going to get scared by the back of someones hea-
"Maybe," Draco said, trying to remember what question he was asking. "Right, what house are you in?" Draco had thought this question was going to be pointless, but Harry seemed confused for a second. Draco watched him closely.
Hermione frowned at him. "Are you okay? You haven't looked well, and I've hardly seen you the past two years."
Draco's heart ached. At some point, it had stopped being an obligation, a chore, a necessity. At some point it stopped being only friendly. It had turned into real affection, which he thought Harry returned.
"Did I tell you professor Lupin was going to give me some private lessons to help me with the dementors?"
Harry had to do this himself. "He's never said anything like that, sir. He never talks about when he was a Death Eater under the
Draco wouldn't change it for the world. He buried his face in Harry's hair, wrapping his own arms around the little body. Harry was crying into his neck, though Draco paid no mind to it. Harry was okay, and was in his arms, and Draco didn't give a damn if the Headmaster and his godfather were watching him.
Harry raised his eyebrow before he could stop himself. Her smile turned sour. "Okay, Professor. What would you like me to do?"
He sat down in one of the unoccupied chairs with a large sigh. He was still disappointed from today's lack of success, but he hoped it wouldn't get in the way too much.
Harry sighed under his breath and did so, dropping his bag back in a seat. He was on the sixth line when he heard a whisper behind him.
Draco tugged at his hair harshly, not feeling the pain. Dumbledore always used candy names, didn't he?
"I solemnly swear I am up to no good," he whispered. Seeing the dots and lines and names pop up had to be the most beautiful sight he could've imagined.
People screamed as the chain holding the Hungarian Horntail broke. Cedric Diggory, the Hogwarts champion, leaped towards a rock to cover, not knowing that the dragon had been angered by a powerful curse that had been cast into its backside and not Diggory's transfigured dog.
Draco almost stabbed his eyeball with a quill when several of his alarms started to go off. He launched out of his chair, dismissing the alarms as he rushed into the room.
The floo flared to life, causing Harry to leap off and behind the couch and for Draco to stop speaking. Professor Snape walked out, his robes billowing in a way Draco had tried to replicate for years.
Professor Snape watched his movements, zeroing in on his face. His eyes flickered to the bruise balm on the table, then to Draco in a silent question, to which he shrugged. He had his suspicions, but nothing he could really prove.
Harry let his head hit his wall. Three days. He didn't think Voldemort would want him again so soon. He let out a small grunt of frustration. Would he even be able to go back to school? He didn't want to get mixed up in this. Harry crumpled up the letter and threw it on the other side of the room. He'd deal with it in the morning.
He launched himself at the one holding Harry, a green light entering his vision. The last thing he heard was Harry's crying before his own screams interrupted the sound. Distantly, he heard laughing and crying, but Draco was distracted by the pain that was consuming him. He clawed at his throat, writhing on the floor. The crying became louder.
Madam Pomfrey looked at him for a moment when he didn't say anything. "Are you sure you feel alright, Mr. Potter?"
"You can go back to flying when you're done," Draco told him, worried Harry thought he was taking the broom away permanently. Harry gave him a bright smile, and bounded out of his seat once he had finished eating.
Transfiguration, he unfortunately shared with the Gryffindors. Mcgonagall stared at him over her glasses as he walked in late, but said nothing. Her class began with her silently pacing back and forth, staring at her students. Whispers vanished as soon as her harsh eyes passed them.
"No, Harry, you don't need to do any cleaning. Just eat, relax, and enjoy yourself, it's okay." This time he waited for Harry to nod before he left, feeling lighter and heavier at the same time.
Dumbledore looked at Draco for a long second. "I can't tell any closer, I'm afraid. I will contact the Ministry tonight, and hopefully Aurors will be searching by morning. You should rest, Mr. Malfoy." Dumbledore told him gently.
Harry's frustration reached it's point. "She crucio'd me and who knows how many other students. I just need a
Hermione ran up next to him, before slowly approaching the dog. When he happily put his head into Hermione's outstretched hand, she giggled.
"Festina Tempus. Madam Pomfrey, may I go now? I'll be late to transfiguration," Draco cut. Harry shot him a slightly hurt look which Draco again, pointedly ignored, glancing meaningfully to the clock.
"Indeed, I imagine that would be frightening for someone as young as you were." Dumbledore chuckled.
"I have no idea," Harry told her, before he ran at Snuffles. The two engaged in a small race, that Snuffles easily won. Harry stopped, gasping for breath and laughing as he walked back to Hermione, who was watching the two of them with a warm smile.
He heard Harry flying between rooms and hallways, wondering if there were other things his body remembered but his mind didn't. Maybe he could cast some first year spells, or knew how to play exploding snap.
"Wait, you nee-" Harry dropped the fork and leaped away from the table and was at the doorway before the fork finished clattering. Draco, frozen, watched as Harry trembled. He stood from his seat and grabbed the green potion. "You just... need to take this first, is all. Madam Pomfrey's orders." Draco said slowly. When Harry didn't move, he approached carefully, making sure that Harry could see his hands.
Harry pulled away for a moment to stare at him. "You can do that?" He whispered. Draco laughed at him, tweaking his nose.
Madam Pomfrey poked her head out behind a closed curtain. "Oh my," she murmured, upon seeing mini-Potter. She quickly turned back to the student she had been treating, cast a spell or two, made a quick order to 'be gentle with it less is break again before this blasted potion goes away'.
Harry walked into a giant mansion, Draco on his left and Malfoy Senior on his right. He didn't like the feeling of being herded. The giant double doors opened automatically. House elves (as Draco had taught him about) scurried across the house, making sure to stay very far from the footpath of the three. Mr. Malfoy gripped Harry's shoulder tightly, guiding him.
While Harry sulked and Draco ignored him, an uncomfortable silence shrouded them, only interrupted by Harry's quick paces trying to keep up with Draco's long strides. Harry struggled with his feet and Draco studiously not-looking. By the time Harry had gotten the rhythm of his own legs, he was grateful that classes were still in session. He couldn't imagine the amount of ridicule people would put him through seeing himself in his mini-Hogwarts uniform and his stupid-looking tiny body.
Both boys seemed deep in concentration. Draco was bent over a cutting board, measuring the distance between his slices of newt, while Harry poured over a textbook, making suggestions and comments which were only greeted with disdainful remarks and a sneer.
Harry cheered as Hermione got off the stool, smiling wide. She sat close to where he was in the line, and gave him a thumbs up. He smiled back at her, glad that she was happy with her house.
Harry shook his head sharply. He was sitting on Draco's bed in the sixth year dorms. The moon was high in the sky and a silencing charm kept them from waking up their dorm mates. Harry leaned his head on Draco's shoulder, taking comfort in the arm that was wrapped around his waist.
"Why are you mixed up with this bunch, Harry? What happened?" He spoke quietly into Harry's ear, startling him.
Luckily, his trek was short, down a flight of stairs and a hallway, and soon he was face to face with the large gargoyle that protected the Headmasters Office.
Harry looked at Snuffles, who was sitting very still. His tongue hung out of the right side of his mouth, it looked like he was smiling.
Draco was a little hurt Harry didn't say anything, but he realized that it was completely like Harry to do so. Harry kept things from people all the time, even his closest friends. He had heard multiple arguments about Harry not telling them things because of some stupid Gryffindor reason.
Hermione picked at her nails a little bit, once again giving Harry the idea that she was much more nervous that she was acting. "I learned this once that fixes things. I could try and fix your glasses, if you'd like. I don't think the sellotape will last for much longer." She gave a nervous laugh, like she wasn't sure whether or not she was joking, and relaxed when Harry laughed with her.
Knowing who his father was, it was likely he would interfere in some way with the correspondence. Draco didn't trust that the Aurors would arrive any time soon.
He stroked her gently, listening to her coo in response. He would've preferred a cat, but she was a gift from Hagrid and there wasn't a chance he was going to refuse her.
Harry was in front of Pettigrew's room. His door wasn't even locked. The man was pathetic at using magic as he was at using common sense.
"Yes Sirs!" Dinky was gone before Draco had put his hand down from handing her the letter. Draco pulled out a new paper.
"You're not going to come with us to tell Professor McGonagall?" Hermione asked. She seemed a little hurt, making Harry feel bad.
"This is your fault," Draco muttered disdainfully, sneer firmly set as he mixed their potion seven times clockwise, and then three times counterclockwise, just as they were supposed to. Only, it didn't fix the color of this stupid, pointless, redundant, infuriating, useless, ludicrous, imbecilic, pointle-
She writhed on the floor, shrieking, but Harry didn't care. When her hissing stopped, he forced the Fiendfyre back in his wand. It tried to leave and lash out at him, but he wouldn't let it. He had far more important matters to attend to.
"Why'd the portrait call you Hadrian?" Draco asked, raising his voice so Harry could hear him from the kitchen.
Madam Pomfrey had left a little while ago, ordering him to 'stay put less I glue you to that bed, Mr. Potter' and had then bustled off out the room. He looked down at his feet, chuckling at the fact that they finally fit him. And to think, all it had taken was being shrunk to...whatever age he was to have proper fitting shoes for once.
The sounds of dicing, slicing, mixing, churning, bubbling, hissing and sizzling, of spoons clattering and pages turning all combined to create a cacophony that felt like the very essence of the potions classroom, where the sixth year Gryffindor and Slytherin students stood.
"I-I'm sorry, it's nothing. You can go back to bed, Harry." Draco said softly. Harry nodded, laying back down next to Draco. "Sleep well," he whispered, running a hand through Harry's hair. He was asleep in moments.
"Incendio." Harry pointed his wand into the middle of the pit, watching the vines shrink and scream. Quirrell had taught him that one.
Voldemort sat on his throne, gripping his wand so tightly it looked ready to snap in two. A faint hissing came from his mouth occasionally, followed by a hiss from Nagini. They were too quiet for Harry to hear, which was a little disappointing. Voldemort hadn't been around lately, so Harry hadn't had much time to listen to his plans. Not that Harry would
With a slight grinding of stone, the statue shifted. Feeling elated, Draco bounded up the steps two at a time, banging loudly on the door to his office. Draco wanted to shout and scream to be let in, but part of him -the part that had grown up under his mother and father's grueling etiquette lessons- kept him from doing so. Another minute passed, feeling like an hour. Draco was ready to forgo his upbringing when he heard the Headmaster's voice.
Harry looked back at Hagrid, who gave him another smile, though it wasn't nearly as cheerful as it had been. That hurt Harry, more than he wanted it to. He decided he wasn't going to let others feelings affect him so much. They never had, in the past. But then again, he never had anyone that cared about him.
Draco stepped into the shower, doing his best to ignore a little nagging voice in his head that wouldn't be ignored.
"I'm... Harry, I knew your father, in school. We were really close friends. I-I was supposed to take care of you after he died, but I was framed for murder. I didn't-I'm innocent, Harry. I'm your godfather."
Someone pointed out that the title is similar to dirty words in Latin, and now I've been faced with the unfortunate battle of not being able to change something I desperately want to. But I REFUSE and I will ACCEPT my double-entendre title. Well, thank you to those who reviewed, and enjoy!
Harry's eyes widened, his wand jumping into his hand even as Voldemort raised his own wand. "Avada Kedavra."
"Did you do it?" He whispered, looking around himself to make sure no one else was listening. Harry gave him a humorless smile and nodded. Draco sucked in a breath, slumping heavily as he exhaled. "How're you gonna know someone took it?"
"Hungry?" Draco pointed to the still hot -he loved house elf magic- breakfast on the counter. Harry slowly approached it, taking the seat opposite him but not making himself a plate.
Suddenly the broom gave a hard shake, reminding Draco far too much of first year. Then Harry was almost touching the ceiling and going
Her smile was back to his normal sickening sheen. "If you will please walk to the back of the classroom and write your lines ten times in chalk, Mr. Potter."
"Then it can wait until after dinner. C'mon, I'm hungry. We'll still have plenty of time after curfew," Harry reassured, gesturing to the door with his head. Hermione relented, sighing.
The dragon raged, spewing fire around itself as it flew up, up into the sky. Heat cascaded upon the stands, making Harry and most of the others flinch in its proximity. Suddenly a light blue shimmer surrounded the dragon, and it collided sharply with something unseen. It roared, flapping useless wings and falling back into the arena where it flailed and shrieked its rage. Aurors and teachers flooded the arena, hitting the already disabled dragon with many brightly-colored spells. Harry spotted Dumbledore and Hagrid among the bunch, and let out a sigh of relief. It had been okay. His small act of rebellion allowed him a small smile.
Draco held his breath, waiting for her to move. After what felt like hours, she lowered her head, curling further into herself. Draco slowly let out his breath, lungs burning.
There weren't any spells that did what Harry needed them to do. He was more disappointed than he thought he'd be. His heart wasn't made of stone, after all. When Hermione finally gave up, it was lunch time, and Harry had a lesson with Professor Lupin afterwards.
," Voldemort snarled, lashing out a smell that blew up part of the wall, "has been hunting my horcruxes. But there is one he'll never be able to get to..." Voldemort trailed off.
"Uhm... my head hurts pretty ba-" Harry paused, choking a little on his own words. "I... I was - I was small and-"
"He seems healthy. I... believe they may have hurt him in some way or another, but there were no physical wounds except the puncture marks from where the snake bit him. He's under mild sleeping charms, but I can't tell what mental damage may have occurred, but I did give him a calming and soothing drought. I expect he wasn't asleep the entire time, and I'm a little worried about possible trauma, especially at his mental age."
Hate was clear in his eyes as Draco corked the bottle and shoved it at Harry. Reflexively, Harry took it, lest it crash and break on the floor. Who knew what this monstrosity would do to the floor...who knew what it would do to him.
"Little tired, Harry. The prisoners being freed has had me more on edge lately than I like to admit." Professor Lupin leaned back in his chair, holding his tea in both of his hands.
A small poof was heard, accompanied by a small cloud of green smoke that enveloped Harry. The cloud dispersed quickly. Standing in Harry's place...a boy.
Professor Lupin smiled. "Chocolate?" He asked, reaching into his pocket. Harry laughed, accepting some.
"Petrificus totalus! Immobulus!" Harry began to feel weak as he cast these spells. He was beginning to think his magic was being used up. But that couldn't happen, could it?
Harry looked over his shoulder at the raggedy, horribly thin man. "They threatened my life. Didn't have much of a choice," he spoke, hoping the man was able to hear him over the wind.
"You did well. I am glad I entrusted my task to you." Voldemort's voice hissed around him. Disgust ate at Harry. He was the reason McGonagall had died, and now Snape was the headmaster. He mourned her death, but he would take it over Draco's.
"Fine," she said, rolling her eyes at Harry's laugh. The two walked out together, leaving behind a nondescript, old leather-bound book on the table they had been sitting at.
He heard it. The slightest hissing from above his head, still on the second floor. Draco almost didn't hear it over his own heartbeat.
A tall, black building rose in the distance. Harry hoped that was what they were looking for, after so many miles of ocean. He hated what they were about to do. Harry had thought of sabotaging the mission, using the numerous offensive spells he had learned, but it would be too suspicious. Voldemort would hardly trust him if only he, Draco, and a few others returned.
He fell back, considering the night. He hated himself for letting this happen. Harry was in trouble, and Draco couldn't do anything.
Tears slipped silently from Harry's face onto Draco's shirt. Draco held him tighter as Harry's body trembled.
"I killed Voldemort, and some other Death Eaters that tried to attack me," Draco shouted, but Harry cut him off, "I am so fucking tired of this Draco, and I'm ending it right now. Either you are going to stay here and be safe until I'm done." Harry paused for a breath, a devilish smile gracing his features. "Or you're going to take revenge with me."
He took the first two stairs gingerly. When no sound met his eats, he walked quickly up, pausing at the top. There was a single hallway with three doors. Two of them were open; the last one was closed, at the end of the hallway.
But Harry was fine. He was rolling and diving and Harry was having the absolute best time of his life. Draco double-casted a few charms just in case, though, and let Harry fly for as much as it terrified him.
That was the fourth boy on Harry's boat to the castle, an Irish lad who seemed decent, if not a little chaotic.
Harry grimaced, not sure if he wanted to be sharing a dorm with Malfoy for the next seven years, but what could be done? To the sound of staggered clapping, he sauntered over to the table, seating himself next to someone introduced himself as Theo. They shook hands, then went back to the sorting.
to be there. There was no other way. Draco threw the map into the trunk, putting his shoes and cloak on faster than he ever had in his life.
safe. That was enough. Draco went into the kitchen, feeling a little lost at seeing Harry's nutrient potions and the bruise cream.
It was too late for that, Draco wasn't going back now. Harry had already been gone for too long, he had no way of knowing what had happened to him.
"He-he gasped and clutched his stomach and then just went limp and wouldn't wake up. It seemed like he was in pain." Madam Pomfrey nodded, casting spells Draco didn't know.
"Okay...okay, yeah," he took the potion, holding it delicately. "Why didn't you have a house-elf bring it this time?"
Draco was motionless at this point. Then he launched himself at Harry, and though Harry was having some trouble breathing, he wouldn't tell Draco that. They didn't hug very often, and it was... really nice.
"Death Eaters came into the room while we were sleeping and they took Harry and he's gone now and I only just woke up because they stunned me and cast the Cruciatus on me and I don't know how long they've been gone but they took Harry and I don't know how to find him and if he's alive or safe or close or anything and-" Draco choked, catching his breath and pressing his palms over his hands.
Harry sat on the floor of the little cabin. Wind pounded against the walls, making Harry think the whole hut would blow over any second. He drew a cake on the floor using dust, giving it eleven candles. As the watch on his wrist beeped, he blew his drawing away. "Happy birthday, Harry," He murmured to himself.
. Sitting for so long made him realize it was likely very early in the morning, and he was utterly drained.
"Though, as all three of us just witnessed, once you walked into the room, Mr. Malfoy, Harry remembered not only that dragons exist, but the type of dragon he fought during the Triwizard Tournament," Dumbledore paused, giving them both a moment to digest that information and the implications of it.
Professor Slughorn wandered around the classroom, peering into pots of students as he passed, remarking to each of how they could aide their potion into being a little less runny, a little thicker, to make the color duller or brighter.
After a moment, Sir Mercy nodded. "Continue your father's work, boy. Creatures of all sorts need rights." Sir Mercy watched him until Draco nodded. "Do not ruin my quarters, boys. The password is Wattlebird. Don't forget it." Sir Mercy opened his portrait, allowing the two boys to step aside.
but Professor Snape was the most talented potions master there was. Draco trusted him. Draco doubted there was another option Snape didn't know about.
Harry was used to it at this point. Look out the window while in the kitchen, make sure the door to the living room was closed, and find the inner right pocket of Aunt Petunia's purse while listening for blundering footsteps. He slipped the cash into one of his baggy pockets to go under a loose floorboard he had in the corner of his cupboard. A little bit once or twice a week added up eventually, so when Harry was sent on an errand he had an opportunity to help himself and get proper-fitting clothes. Last time he had gotten brand new socks; they had been heaven on his feet.
"Yes, I suppose. I did want to check out a book on magical aquatic creatures. A new girl in my dorm, Luna, said something about the giant squid last night and I haven't been able to get it off my mind," Hermione quickly gathered her things, glancing up at Harry as she did so.
He had to check. He started to pull away, Harry's hand fell off of his shirt. Harry shifted, and suddenly big green eyes were blinking up at him.
No one raised their hand. The classroom had gone from an eruption of chaos and shouting to utter silence. It seemed that everyone hoped that if they were quiet and didn’t move, the professor wouldn’t see them. Professor Slughorn sighed heavily, murmuring about the mood swings of teenagers. "Very well...here we go, Mr. Potter, come here."
"Okay," he said quietly. "You should take a shower, yesterday was a long day. Do you know where it is?"
Harry cast every destructive spell he knew. The chess pieces blew into pieces, exploded, were cut in half, knocked over, anything he could do to get past them. Harry ran and jumped over the rumble, blasting the door open and slamming it closed behind him.
He wasn't sure if it was his spells, his luck, or some god that had blessed his journey, but he reached Harry and the snake never moved once. He crouched, brushing hair away from Harry's forehead gently. Draco almost gasped.
Harry fell back in the clutter, his heart pounding in his chest, weariness in his bones. But he couldn't rest now. He had to tell Snape.
"Give it too him before he goes to bed. It will likely make him tired. Be careful, Draco." With a nod, Snape left, leaving Draco feeling lost and worried.
Harry was afraid he had broken the man. "That's-that's not possible. That isn't possible," Lupin whispered, standing up shakily.
"No, they're not...'Mione, what's a paresel...thing? The thing they called Salazar Slytherin," Harry asked, peering at the book she held.
Harry looked up from his eyes, surprised. "A school," he said after a moment. That was his usual response, Draco had probably said it enough for him to remember it.
"Mr. Malfoy, I would like to make it clear that you are not to blame," Dumbledore said quietly. Draco started a bit, not expecting the Headmasters voice. "You did everything in your power, which wasn't much. It is extremely important that you came to us as soon as you did. It will greatly impact Mr. Potter's chance of survival, I'm sure."
"Leave us." He commanded the Death Eaters who had been silent. They left quickly and just as quietly. Harry wanted to look back to catch Draco's eye, but he didn't dare. "I think you have proved yourself, Harry. Taking initiative the way you have. I think it is time I trusted you more."
"When we began this potion I thought I could be reassured that even your idiotic self could count ingredients, excuse me if I believed I was working with someone who wasn't a complete imbecile!" Draco snarled at Harry, whose ears were beginning to redden in frustration.
on the stairs and a featherweight charm on himself as an extra measure. He didn't trust the stairs to hold him.
Harry and Draco shared a glance. "You will also be battered relentlessly with learning new offensive spells, and I expect you both to work tirelessly in both areas. To your rooms, now."
Draco stretched from his spot on the couch. A quick spell told him the time; a few minutes to eleven. Groaning, Draco pushed his schoolwork away. The elves would take what he'd completed and leave the rest. He was putting his quill and ink away when he heard a thump from the other room.
"And now I don't know what to believe. Did you kill thirteen people including Pettigrew? Well, I know part of that is
"Mm, I wonder if that could have been avoided by eating slower and not twice the amount you usually do," Draco told him with a raised eyebrow. He had warned Harry twice before giving up. Harry pouted.
He could... manipulate Potter a bit, couldn't he? Get him to think more like a Slytherin. Why not? It would be fun, seeing Harry act weirdly towards his Gryffindor friends while getting along just fine with Draco...
." She licked her lips and snarled at Harry, revealing blackened teeth. "And you should be happy for this, after he
Time felt slowed as he walked towards it. There might be anyone behind it. His father, the snake, Voldemort himself... there was a very real chance Draco wouldn't be coming out of this alive. He wanted to cower; every muscle in his body was yearning to leap back down the stairs. But he couldn't, not when he was this close.
Harry visibly struggled, a crease forming on his forehead. "I... I'm not sure, Sir." Snape nodded, as though he had never expected anything different.
The walk seemed to go on forever. Though he couldn't tell if it was the actual distance, his anxiety, or the cramps in his back and neck that were telling him that. None of it mattered, anyways. Harry still needed his help.
"Hello. We were looking for an empty compartment, sorry," the dark skinned boy went to close the door, but Draco grabbed his arm.
"Now, Mr. Potter, I have some questions. My diagnostics say you're about seven years old right now. Would you like to explain to me why you are so horribly malnourished?" Her stern look made Harry wilt where he was sitting.
He sat at the table for a while longer, head in his hands. He felt calmer than he would have without Pomfrey's potions, he was sure. But he still felt like something was...
Harry tried to imagine the terrifying reptile in front of him. "Why're you hung-" Harry stopped. That was English, he knew that. He concentrated, trying to focus on the hissing voice in his head.
Draco hoped they were sleeping charms, at least. He could break those easily. Draco stood, staring at Nagini.
As the slender blond took her own potion, the same procedure happened. Her hair shortened, her face rounded out, she wasn't as tall, her shoes were slightly clunky on her feet, and her arm was bent at an awkward angle.
Harry screamed before he reined it in. Voldemort had done this plenty of times, he could keep himself quiet. He counted to ten before it relented.
Draco sat on the couch for a moment, head in his hands. He noticed the broken tea cup, and absentmindedly fixed the cup and dried the stain. He'd been with Potter for less than an hour and he was already convinced this would be the death of him.
Umbridge didn't last another week. Food poisoning turned sour, she had left for st. Mungo's and wasn't expected to return the rest of the year. An Auror took her place. It was basically the same, minus the detentions. But Harry didn't care about that. She was gone, and Draco was suspicious but happy, and that was the important part.
Harry pulled out his wand, making a messy upside down 'V'. "Lumos!" He cried out. His wand flickered, a shaky light sputtering before giving out. Harry frowned. "That's...weird." He looked at Dumbledore, who watched him thoughtfully.
"And what exactly happened here?" Madam Pomfrey inquired with a quirked eyebrow, a small glower. Harry gulped as he looked up at her, craning his neck.
The screams were deafening. All around, all Harry could see were the smoky outlines of wizards attempting to put out the raging fires. Harry hadn't been responsible for much of this, thankfully. Lucius had made him and Draco stay in the tent for the beginning, but when it came time to set their own quarters (a decoy, Lucius didn't want to burn the real thing) he sent them to burn tents, regardless of the families inside.
He didn't know what time it was when he woke up again. The alarms went off loudly in his ears, and Draco almost face planted rushing to get out of his tangled sheets. He dismissed the alarms once more and stumbled into Harry's room.
Draco was tempted to mock the snake in his mind, but decided against it. He needed to get to Hogwarts first.
Harry climbed atop the broom and zoomed throughout the chamber. Eventually, he located a key that seemed to move slower than the others. It was larger, and looked older. Harry shot after it, though the key seemed to know it had been spotted.
Draco wasn't sure how long the nurse had been casting, eventually her wand stilled in her hand. She turned to Draco. "The potion is doing what it must. It seems that he is going to be sleeping for a while, I'm going to be keeping a very close eye on him."
"Of course Sir!" Dinky croaked happily, before popping away again. Harry stared at where the house elf had been, still seeming scared and shocked.
"Unfortunately," Draco grimaced, sitting next to Harry. He poured himself a cup of tea, leaning back in the comfy couch.
"Looks happier too. Think we can sneak him into the kitchens, get him some food?" At Harry's words, Snuffled yipped at him, jumping on Harry and putting his paws on his shoulders. Harry laughed as Snuffles licked his cheek, leaving it slobbery. "Eugh, gross!"
"It's okay, you're okay. You didn't do anything wrong, that was my fault," Draco said quietly. He had been too harsh, pushed Harry too much. Usually they went about it much slower, taking time to think about it and explain. He had stressed Harry out. He felt horrible about it. They stayed like that for a moment, before he pulled Harry away and bent down to look at him evenly. He wiped the tears from his face with his thumbs.
He slept like a disgusting, deformed baby atop his bed, which was shabbier than Harry's own. He was partially illuminated by the light gently filtering in through the only window in the room.
"No, and I doubt Professor Slughorn does either. Even making it a priority, it will take over a week to produce, likely closer to two. Maybe discussing things related to his life will keep his memory longer." Severus said quietly. His eyes moved to the bruise balm.
Harry slowly rose, looking at Voldemort for the first time. He looked to be in his thirties. He had dark brown hair and a small beard. He was almost frighteningly pale, his red eyes stared at Harry, forcing him into place. Harry trembled slightly. He wasn't sure why this was so much more intimidating than seeing his deformed face on the back of Quirrell's head.
Draco had barged in the door before he finished speaking, hands red and raw from the wood of the door. Dumbledore raised a hand, but Draco was already in front of him and speaking in a panic.
Harry laughed into his chest, leaning into the hand Draco had curled into his hair. "Ron and Hermione are going to go off their rockers."
"That's all... for me?" Harry asked slowly. Draco nodded, and pushed the plate closer. Harry grabbed a fork so slow Draco thought Harry was trying to tease him or something, with the way Harry's eyes kept darting back and forth between Draco, the plate, and the fork.
Wondering if this would trigger any other memories, Draco forced himself to keep still on the couch as he watched Harry fly in circles around him. Harry was giggling madly, and soon shouts of "Faster! Faster!" filled the air.
Lucius decided not to tell them that the Dark Lord would most likely demand all their time in the next few years. The Dark Lord was gone, now off on the hunt for something Lucius wasn't allowed to know about. Several Death Eaters were still in his home, but they had all been given rooms far away, and had agreed to stay away from the boys this Christmas break.
He made it to the hallway, wondering if he should shut the door and put charms on it to hinder her. He stood for a moment, deliberating, but then Harry shuffled in his arms and Draco realized he had to get out,
"What was the nightmare about?" Draco asked quietly, now moving his thumb in small circular motions on the back of Harry's neck. Harry turned his face so it was hidden into Draco's shoulder, who pretended not to melt at the action.
"Mr. Malfoy, he's been put under some mild sleeping charms, I'm going to leave them for now so he doesn't wake up and panic. We'll discuss the rest of his condition once Headmaster Dumbledore and Professor Snape arrive. I'm going to go contact them, stay here with him."
behind it. Dudley went sprawling, his nose bleeding heavily. Pierce backed up slowly, before running away. Dudley cried, holding his nose.
The bottle was drained, and Harry had a moment to shudder violently. He began to set the bottle down, before he fell down to his knees, gasping in pain. Harry clutched his stomach, and cried out.
One thing he knew was how cruel Voldemort could be, and there wasn't a doubt in his mind that this was his fault.
"I'm not making enemies with Harry Potter, Draco. C'mon, let's get you cleaned up, my mom taught me some healing spells." Blaise grabbed Malfoy's arm and led him into the bathroom. Harry changed into his bed clothes and waited, wand in hand and ears open.
Bellatrix cackled next to Voldemort, clapping delightedly. Her brother and husband, they must be. Lucius had mentioned them to him before, since they were loosely related to the Malfoy name.
He looked back down at Harry, realizing he had stopped stroking his hair. Resuming, Draco sighed. This wouldn't last much longer, he knew. Snape would have the potion ready before he realized it, and Harry would be back to normal, and then... he would be gone. This whole... this whole part of his life would be over.
The sun was cresting the distant mountains when Draco ran out of his chambers, wand in hand and robes billowing behind him.
"Blasted subject. I never liked potions, pointless practice! Always caused too many lost limbs and dead animals! You couldn't even eat them after because they were too ruined by the stupid things!" Sir Mercy exclaimed, "I do hope you fix yourself soon, Hadrian. Stay away from potions, they never did anyone any good!" Sir Mercy crossed his arms, nose in the air. Harry was reminded a bit of Draco at the pose.
"Perhaps you'll remember to count them yourself next time, as is recommended when working with another person," Harry quipped. Draco began to seethe as he realized Potter was hardly giving this any attention! As if this was some first year project and not a potion that would certainly end up as part of their exam! Potter didn't even have the decency to act like he cared! The insolent prick!
"Hm. Well, perhaps you'd also like to explain to me why you were absolutely covered in bruises and burns before I ordered you to take that potion?" She said next, staring at him.
Mr. Malfoy pulled him down to the ground before he could react, and Draco was down almost just as quick. His knee banged against the marble floor harshly, causing him to wince.
Madam Pomfrey waved her hand in dismissal, and Draco briskly walked out. Professor Mcgonagall was going to kill him for being late. It wasn't even his fault!
"No, I haven't tried to practice much, but I've been doing accidental magic for a long time. What kind of spells have you learned?"
Draco looked up. Harry didn't call him that very often. When had he become this nice? "What do you mean?"
He chanced another step, and then another, courage growing alongside his fear as it continued to stay put. Surely an
He leaned against a bed post, a small smile on his face. Harry was tucked under the covers, laying on his side and holding tightly to a stuffed animal of a large black dog.
Harry told Draco he'd meet him in the Great Hall soon. He waited until the rest of the potions class filtered out, then walked up to Snape. "I need your help."
Severus disappeared. Draco sat for a few more minutes thinking their conversation. It hadn't been as promising as he'd hoped it would be. Realizing he hadn't heard anything from Harry since he'd walked out of the room, Draco went into Harry's room. He found him sleeping, cuddling the large black dog stuffed animal.
Every few days Draco tried to get Harry to do magic, though it was still completely unsuccessful. Harry always felt horrible after, thinking he had disappointed Draco, but he bounced back to his happy self quicker each time.
Draco didn't think he loved Harry. But he was positive he was on the way to loving him. He was sure he could.
"I was so hungry! That's not fair!" Harry draped himself across Draco's lap, looking at the ceiling. Draco wondered if he was the reason Harry was acting dramatic. The thought made him smile.
"Clumsy." Harry refused to look at her. Instead, he stared resolutely at a crack on the spotless white tile floor.
"What hou-wait, what? You didn't get it by owl?" Draco asked, stopping his motion of pouring himself some tea.
The pain stopped, leaving Harry shaking and sobbing on the ground, arms and legs still twitching from the effects. He distantly heard shrill laughing coming from all around him.
"I'm not sure," Harry looked away from him, back at the mirror. He almost laughed when he heard a frustrated little huff to the side, barely audible over the noise of the shop. The boy didn't seem to appreciate being ignored. Harry felt all the better about his choice.
What had he gotten into...he needed to end this, soon. Somehow. Or it was going to be the death of him and everything he cared about.
Harry smiled, laughing at Snuffles, who had stumbled away from him to stare at him, face down by his paws, butt in the air and tail wagging furiously.
Harry gave him a thumbs up before the hat covered his eyes, seeing how nervous the boy was. Neville fidgeted where he sat, his knuckles almost white from gripping the stool.
Harry stretched out his hand, and clasped it tightly in it's fist. It fluttered feebly in his palm, and soon stopped. He landed and stuffed the key into the door, hearing a soft
"'Mione, do you know any cleaning spells that are good for dogs? Seems like he could use a bath and maybe a brush, don't you think?" Harry watched the mutt eat with a smile on his face. The dog's ears perked up in interest a bit, but he seemed too interested in the meat.
Draco woke up from the sun attacking his eyes. He tried to turn away from it, but his left arm was asleep. His eyes blinked open rapidly to look at it, finding mini-Potter laying on it. Draco almost reflexively pushed Potter off of him -he hadn't slept with anyone else in the bed since he was six- until last night came flooding back. Draco rolled so he could keep him warm, looking down as he did so. Harry's hair covered most of his face, but Draco could see traces of an angry purple bruise forming around Harry's chin.
"It has come to my attention that you haven't really been absorbing the lesson these detentions are teaching you." She looked at him sweetly, as always. It made Harry sick.
"Do you have a problem, Malfoy?" Harry stood, puffing his chest out just a little bit. Malfoy sneered, and took a step back. Harry got the idea he wasn't expecting Harry to confront him so quickly.
Draco nodded again. Harry had dropped from his broom and was standing against Draco's side, somewhat hiding from Professor Snape. Draco put a hand on his back to sooth him, uncaring of the raised eyebrow his godfather gave him.
