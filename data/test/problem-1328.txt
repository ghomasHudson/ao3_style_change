“Okay, then can I talk about it if you don’t want to?” Harkin questioned as she made Draco look her in the eyes.
“I can talk to Helena, she wouldn’t have an issue with me talking to her, but I must go alone she is shy, and she can tell us where she hid the diadem and who may have spoken to about it and if she knows where they put it.”
They then walked down to the dining room where everyone was waiting for them, and Harry stopped dead in her tracks as she spotted the Minister sitting in one of the chairs at the table. Draco turned and looked at her, and she started shaking her head. “Severus said he wouldn’t tell.” She whispered.
“Which one of my friends did you harm to get in here?” Harry said as he fingered his wand in his pocket.
“Well, there are a few ways. One we find and destroy the last Horcrux, but as for we do not know what it is, there is a second option. We put Harry under a stasis until we can destroy the horcrux.”
Harry asks some questions and doesn't get the answers she was looking for.
“You. You became a prize I can win.”
“You have to ask. What is my specialty, Har?” Ginny grinned, and Harkin busted out laughing. “He deserved it after I found out that he punched you in the face, and then you let him off the hook for it.” Ginny scolded.
“Not necessarily.” Draco then expected Harry to make sure he’s alright. “You aren’t hurt are you?” Harry could see true concern written throughout Draco’s features, something that he rarely gets with anyone other than Draco, and some time Pansy when she feels like she can use Harry for sex.
“I didn’t mean to.” She heard Sirius mutter before the door closed.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t realize there were rules, and who would I know what the rules are. I grew up with muggles in a muggle suburb, where I was treated as if I didn’t exist…” Harry trailed off and stared off into space.
“Harry, you’re awake. How are you feeling?” Hermione asked as she stood up and walked over to the side of the bed.
“Is still Draco, and she can get pregnant again, she has plenty of eggs in her ovaries. She should wake in a little bit, and you can take her home.”
“Yes, she doesn’t interact with anyone. She also doesn’t like being called the Grey Lady; she would rather go by her real name.”
“Mr. Nott, Mr. Zabini, please grab, Mr. Malfoy very carefully, and follow me up to the hospital wing please. Minerva, can you take care of Mr. Weasley?” Severus asked as the Head of House finally made it through the crowd of students.
“Yes.” Draco replied.
“Yes, or that’s Severus’ theory. We can’t be certain until it comes into play.”
“What?” Harkin nearly screamed.
“What?” Harkin exclaimed. “But we’ve been extremely civil.”
“I will fire call Melody, and see if she will come over and check her out. We won’t let anything happen to her or the baby, Draco. Everything will be alright. I promise.” Narcissa whispered in his ear before she pulled away and hurried from the room to fire call Melody. Draco sat down in one of the chairs, and he placed his face in his hands. A few moments later, Narcissa came back followed by Melody, and Draco practically jumped off his chair and rushed towards them. “She is in your room correct?” Narcissa asked, and Draco nodded. The group then hurried up the stairs to Draco’s room, where Harkin was lying down on the bed fast asleep, and Melody started casting diagnostic charms on her. Some of the spells Draco didn’t even recognize from all the times that he has gotten hurt, and he was starting to panic.
“I don’t know, it was closest door, so I just pulled you through it. I wasn’t going to go around by his body that would take longer, and I didn’t want to go anywhere near him,” Harry tried to explain.
“Yes, I think you are right, but I just can’t get past the fact that I feel like I’m a guest in a home that is supposed to be mine as well. I don’t think Lucius will really start to warm up to me until after Draco and I get married. Narcissa just wants to make sure that I feel welcome at the manor, but I don’t because it’s not my home. I don’t have a home, Remi, and I don’t know if I ever will be able to call any place home, I don’t know how.” Harkin whispered.
“You and Granger made polyjuice potion in second year how?”
“And you are my family. Technically or not. You two are the two people I care about most and for the longest. You are my family no matter what. I love you guys.” Harkin stated, and she smiled at them. Draco took Harkin’s hand, and she smiled over at him, and he smiled back. “And I can mix my old family with my new family.” Harkin stated as she brought their entangled hands to rest on her still flat stomach. “I love you, Dray.” she whispered.
Draco got Harry back in the bed and told him to wait here. He will be right back. Draco then made sure to cast a spell that allowed no one to enter or exit the room, and he was then down in the dining room, where he almost drank Harry dry, and he winced slightly before everyone entered. Draco stood there casually with his hand behind his back when they entered.
Harry moved so his erection was resting on Draco’s, and he flicked his hips forward, grinding there erections together. Moans escaped both of their lips, and Draco and Harry had locked their lips together, and Harry forced his tongue into Draco’s mouth the minute it opened. Draco pulled Harry’s hips forward over and over again as Harry swirled his tongue around Draco’s mouth, and finally Harry couldn’t take it anymore, and he took Draco’s hands and moved them to the waistband of his pants. Draco received the message and his fingers started working on Harry’s pants, pulling them off as quickly as he could.
Harry was panting as Draco drew him closer to cumming. “Dray, almost there.” Harry panted. Draco quickened his pace, and Harry’s back arched at Draco’s hand against his back. “Dray, I’m going to…I’m going…” Harry came all over his and Draco’s chests, and afterwards Draco quickened his pace even more. Harry tried to use what leverage he had to meet Draco’s thrusts.
“Yes, I have the rest of my life to be with him. Thank you, Narcissa, for checking up on me.” Harkin said.
“Malfoy Manor. Malfoy was trying to identify me because you cast a stinging hex on me.” Harry said as he looked at Hermione to see how much damage was done, because from the look on her face he had been in some serious trouble and some serious damage had been done. She trusted Draco Malfoy of all people to help her.
“Yes, Mistress.” Cali then went back to work, and Narcissa sat down on the edge of Draco’s bed.
“Love, I’m sorry; I bit your neck.” Draco whispered as his fingers brushed over the skin that was now bleeding, and the blood sped and then started knitting back together. “Whoa, did you just see that?” Draco whispered.
“Yeah, Ron?” Harry asked, knowing exactly what Ron was going to say.
“Harry, if it means that I get to stay with you I will leave everything for you. Without you I don’t know what I would do. How would we have turned out if we didn’t have each other? I don’t even want to imagine my life without you in it. I need you in my life, just like you need me, Harry. Please just stay, with me,” Draco begged as he leaned in and kissed Harry.
“Nothing just that my father is unconscious on the bedroom floor, disguised as my mother, so you decide what’s up.” Draco shouted, and Tonks jumped up of the couch and ran for the bedroom that the boys were sharing. They heard shouting and some spells being cast, and after a while, Tonks came out of the room pulling Lucius Malfoy by a set of handcuffs behind her.
“Don’t look at me like that, Potter. You and Draco put your hands on this stone here.” He said as he indicated the stone with his wand. Draco took Harry’s hand and they placed them next to each other on the stone. Snape cast a spell and a door opened to them. “All you have to do to gain access is place your hands on the stone and it will open for you. But only you and Draco can gain access this way. Understood?”
“Correct again, Mr. Potter. Albus said you would need it, but he didn’t say why, I figured out about the Horcruxes later. Which brings me to the cup. Are you going to destroy it Miss Granger?” he said as he turned towards Hermione. Hermione stepped forwards and placed the cup on the ground and pulled the sword out of her bag.
“Don’t say it. I’ve had worse trust me.”
“Harry, do you and Draco want any breakfast? Since you two didn’t have time to eat before we left. So did you want to eat something or not?”
“You did that?” Harkin questioned. “That is some powerful magic, Draco. You can’t keep that up all day, every day?” Harkin commented.
“Morning, Draco. What’s got you up this early in the morning?”
The Dark Lord was in front of them in seconds, and he started yelling at Lucius. Harry was in and out of consciousness, but she caught the jest of the conversation. The Dark Lord blamed Lucius. “Stop, it wasn’t his fault I did something stupid, and got in the way of Nagini attacking Arthur. It is my fault, there is nothing Lucius could have done to stop me. I’m at fault, not him.” Harry shouted before she felt the rest of her energy drain from her, she had just enough energy to pull the prophecy out of her pocket and let her arm fall. Lucius just barely caught her arm and the prophecy before it almost hit the ground. Harry felt the darkness take her eyes fluttered closed.
Harry woke up, and her eyes fell on a blurry red bouquet of she assumed flowers, and she tried to find her glasses. Someone handed them to her and when she placed them on her face, Draco came into view. “Hey,” Harry whispered.
“How did this happen? How did he get in?” Tonks shouted towards the boys, but they weren’t sure if the questions were actually directed at them or not. “Do you two know the answers or not?”
“Draco, could you please return to the dining room I would like to have a word with you. Narcissa, would you mind staying here with Harry while I talk to Draco.” Draco and Harry both looked at each other and then at Narcissa.
“Which is?” Ron asked.
“Nothing, I just. I have a family, and it’s weird. I don’t know how to deal with having a family. My childhood wasn’t the greatest, and I’ve never had a family. I don’t know how to have a family.” Harkin whispered, and Remus pulled her back into a hug.
“So they can sleep in the other’s common room whenever they want?” Remus clarified.
“Lestrange?” Harry asked as he tried to keep the fear out of his voice. They reached Andromeda’s room and they walked in. Rodolphus placed Andromeda on her bed, and then transfigured the settee in the corner into a crib for Teddy.
“Bloody hell, mate. You sounded exactly like Mione and my mum. Merlin is that a girl thing.” Harry started laughing harder, and Hermione and the rest of the Gryffindor’s joined in.
“South, okay. How far?”
“They’re in the Room of Requirement right now looking for it. You are going to stay here and recover, and you have no say in that. Especially, after our little escapade.” Draco smirked, and Harry laid back down. McGonagall was staring at the pair with her eyes wide.
“What about the Death Eaters that aren’t holding ministry positions?”
Draco laughed at the small joke that Harkin had said, and they continued to work on the essay that Severus was going to assign them before they left class, but Draco was thinking about what Severus might want to talk to him about after class. He knew that it most definitely wasn’t his career appointment because Severus and him talked about how that was going to be something that they were going to do after the twins were born with himself, McGonagall, Harkin and Draco, since their bond was something unique they thought that it be best to talk about it all at the same time.
“Draco, come sit; we have some unexpected guests,” Lucius ordered as he looked around the table and indicated the seat next to Harry, since the chairs across from Harry were occupied. Draco glanced over at the men and then at Harry. Draco could see the fear and worry written across Harry’s face, and he quickly sat down in the seat and rested his hand on Harry’s leg to reinsure him. The meal went about very slowly, and when Lucius finally dismissed Draco and Harry, the pair was more than happy to leave as quickly and quietly as possible.
“I do but I just don’t know what to tell everyone else, or if we even tell them. I mean how would everyone react, or how would some people treat us after they found out. I mean I know that we’re inseparable anyway and some people probably think we’re shagging anyway, but what about our friends and your parents. I just can’t stop thinking about it Dray.” Draco rested his hands on Harry’s shoulders and steadied him a little bit.
“Black.” Lucius said with indifference.
Harry knew who it was as soon as he said that, it could only be one person. Harry’s eyes widened for they were the only part of her body she could move, and she tried to fight the spell, but she still didn’t move. “Harry, calm down, please. I know you know who I am, but until the potion wears off I’m stuck as Draco. I’m going to remove the spell now, and you’re going to stay quiet, got it?” Theodore waved his wand and the spell allowed Harry to move again, and Harry immediately started struggling against the ropes harder.
“Severus just floo called and informed me that Thaddeus escaped capture along with your sister and a group of low level Death Eaters.”
“I know, fawn; I won’t make you go back, and I will do everything in my power to make sure you don’t have to go back. Alright, I promise.” Harry just hugged Sirius tighter, and Sirius let her knowing that she needed the comfort. “It’s alright, fawn; it’s alright.”
“Mr. Malfoy, I believe I said no extracurricular activities while Miss Potter is healing. She is still rather fragile, which brings me to the next thing I have to say. Miss Potter, I have received a letter from my colleagues, and they have come to a conclusion of their analysis of the potion that was spilled upon you last week.”
“You care about him, Malfoy. I can see it in your eyes. You were once better at hiding your emotions better.”
“I’m fine.” Harry shouted that tie, and Narcissa stepped back. Lucius and Snape stormed into the room to see what was going on, and Harry dropped the material so it covered the injuries, but not before they saw them. “No, go away everyone. Now!” Harry shouted, but they didn’t move. Snape actually rushed forwards and lifted the material back up to see.
“I wouldn’t want you to. I just thought that if you were that if you wanted to you could. I wouldn’t make you either way. I just want you to be happy, love.” Draco then pulled her into a hug, and she rested her head against his shoulder.
Harry just laid there, she didn’t know how long she was there, but suddenly the door opened and there stood Mr. Nott. “I’m going to take you on a little trip, and you are going to behave. Understood?” Harry didn’t do anything, but Nott walked up to the bed and pulled out his wand and the ropes disappeared, and Harry could feel as Nott grabbed her ankles and pulled her to the end of the bed. As soon as she was close enough she yanked one of her feet free and kicked Nott in the face and she heard and felt his nose break. He released her and she was up and making a beeline for the door when she tripped. She fell and tried to stop her fall and broke her arm, and she screamed.
“I think it might be a strange magic influx. She wasn't feeling good this morning, and then she looked fine during lunch and transfigurations. But then I told her about my date, and she got really excited and then she fainted.” Hermione stated.
“Why don’t you ask Albus about Harry’s relatives?” Severus said as he sat down in one of the chairs the no one was sitting in.
. She wasn’t telling me everything and I needed to know how she got the injuries she did.”
“Yes, Mother.” Draco said with a quick nod. “What does this mean for Harkin?” he asked.
“And may I ask what you might have been talking about. I hope not her foolish nonsense about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.”
“Oh, so it takes me almost dying for them to come to their senses.”
“Do you want me to start with the injuries that the Dursley’s have caused her?”
“I think that is a fair assumption, which begs the question how did your husband find you?”
“Love, you need to wake up.”
“I had to. Now, will you help me?”
“Thank you.”
“Weasley.” Severus drawls.
The day before they had to go back to school, Melody came to do a checkup, and she cleared her as long as she took it easy and that there will be checkups every third Saturday of the month. Narcissa sat in on all of the official healer appointments, and after Melody left, Narcissa didn’t leave right away like she normally did.
“Not that far maybe only a couple of miles.” Draco whispered.
He feed Teddy the baby food and then carried him back upstairs for his bath and bed time. In the end both of them were covered in the baby food and soaked, so Harry finished giving Teddy a bath and put him to bed in his pajamas, and then he went to take his own shower. When he finished, he got ready for bed, and climbed in bed. He pulled that days paper off his night stand and started reading it. The headline read: MALFOY FAMILY OFF ON ALL CHARGES AGAINST THEM. Harry smiled as he read the headline, it meant that his letter worked, and he hoped that they would never find out per instructions in his letter. Harry started reading the article and it read:
“Yes, I’m afraid it is a Malfoy trait.” Narcissa stated, and Harkin turned towards her and stared. “What?” Narcissa asked.
“Don’t think like that, love. You don’t pick abusive people. People just don’t know how to react to who you are. Your aunt and uncle hated magic which is why they treated you the way they did. Ronald hates your popularity and your fame, and sadly his way of dealing with that is through aggression.” Draco stated.
Draco slipped his tongue into Harry’s mouth, and Draco slipped his hands down Harry’s side and ripped his shirt off. Harry rolled his hips upwards into Draco’s erection. Draco moaned as Harry’s erection grinded against his own. “Harry! My god. Pants… off… now. I can’t stop myself when you do that, Harry. I need you…I need you in me, Harry.” Harry moved his hands down to Draco’s waistband, and undid Draco’s pants. Harry pulled Draco’s pants off and slipped his hand down between Draco’s cheeks and found his way to Draco’s entrance. Harry pushed his fingers into Draco’s entrance, and Draco let out a slight moan as Harry pushed his way into Draco.
“How do we stop it?” Draco panicked, and Harry started screaming. The sound vibrated throughout the room.”
“Never, fawn. Not unless he hurts you first.” Sirius stated.
“Draco, how do you know that’s what she will want? She is strong and independent, dragon. Now, just because you are bonded to her, she will always be able to think for herself.”
“I’ve got everything if that’s your question. Tally slipped Harry’s invisibility cloak out of Ron’s bag and that’s why he was throwing a tizzy. He’s upset that he’s lost Harry’s cloak, and he can’t use it for himself. I honestly don’t know why Harry is still friends with him. I mean he’s probably just sticking around because Harry’s famous. I think last year proved that, not to mention how quickly he jumped on the Harry’s guilty train the other day. Seriously, if I wouldn’t have known Ron was Harry’s best friend before that day I would have never believed it with how quickly he rolled on Harry’s loyalties.” Draco said as he stepped towards from Severus with a small smile on his face, like he just realized something.
“Yes, he helped with the pain and swelling last night, but we came in to get some bruise-healing paste.” Harkin stated as she turned a little more towards Madam Pomfrey than Ginny.
Harry stepped out of the nook and said, “What do you have a tracking charm on me, Malfoy?” kind of joking and being serious at the same time.
“Yes, he went through it briefly, but he kind of lost me in the middle.”
“For another time. Back to the bond.” Harkin dismissed.
“I was joking, Cissy. Are you being serious, Cissy?”
Ginny stepped up to Severus and whispered, “If this has anything to do with Harry I am there, and no one can stop me, Headmaster.” Ginny snarled the last word and walked past him. Ron shrugged as he walked past and Hermione did the same.
Harry then felt the pressure of another body on top of her, and her wrists were taken and pinned above her head. She let out a whimper of pain as her broken arm was jostled. She knew what was going to happen, but she did break his nose and try and escape; she just wished she actually did escape. He was naked again, and he started thrusting into her. The pain was worse than the last time, and she couldn’t help but let out the sounds of pain as he brutally thrusted in her.
About halfway through the game, Lucius walked into the dining room. “Ah, I see they have started a new game.” Lucius said as he lifted Narcissa out of her chair and sat down, pulling Narcissa into his lap afterwards. “Who is winning?”
“I understand, my Lord. Come, Potter.” Lucius stated.
“Yeah, but it’s difficult for change to settle in and have it become the new normal.” Harkin stated.
Pansy’s face was priceless as she turned and stormed out of the room. “So Potter, huh? Well, took you two long enough.” Blaise said. Harry’s head turned and looked at Blaise with confusion on his face. “Oh, come on, Potter. If you look in your eyes while you say things you can tell every emotion that you are feeling in that precise moment. I’m very observant, Potter. I saw what you felt every time you looked, fought, or talked to Draco. Anger, excitement, interest, amazement, lust, surprise, and acceptance. You’ve loved Draco for years, Potter.”
“Why would your father listen to you?”
“No, I am taking my godson into my care. I don’t care if I’m supposed to be dead or not. Someone is coming after him and I want him safe, Remus. Harry and the rest of the Malfoy family are coming home with me. I don’t care what Dumbledore says. Draco, Narcissa, can you come with me please, I’m going to keep you safe?” Sirius asked as he turned towards Narcissa, Draco and Harry.
“I hope not, but Har is now part of my family, so who knows.” Draco said with a shrug.
“I actually was wondering your opinion on these laws, but your defence is sound.” Harkin smiled as she leaned in and kissed Draco’s lips.
“I was going to send her on her way tomorrow for school when I sent you back to Hogwarts. I released the others for I wasn’t sure if Mr. Thomas wanted to head back to Hogwarts or not seeing as he is a muggleborn and still being hunted by the Ministry. Miss Lovegood is in a guest room in the North Wing of the house. Your room being in the South Wing I felt she was safe.” Narcissa said. “I will retrieve her.” Narcissa said as she rushed out of the room.
“Just wear one of your ball gowns, love. You have plenty in the wardrobe over there.” Draco stated as he pointed to the wardrobe with all the ball gowns Narcissa bought her, and went back into the closet. Harkin walked over to the wardrobe and hesitantly opened the door, and she browsed through the dresses until she found the one she wanted to wear. She pulled it out, and she stepped inside and turned towards Draco, who was stepping out of the closet at that exact moment.
“What was unexpected? What did you have me do?” Draco nearly shouted, but relaxed as Harry touched his back as she now stood behind him.
“Draco? If you don’t want to be friends with me anymore that’s fine I completely understand. It happens all the time once people meet my family and that I’m practically a slave in my own house.” The disappointment dribbled out of Harry’s mouth like he had made this statement on several occasions, but Draco just looked at him dumbstruck.
“Love, I’m sorry. I forgot about the bond for a moment.” Draco said as he walked over to Harkin, and he wrapped his arms around her pulling her into a tight embrace. He then pulled them down into a lying position on the bed. They laid on the bed entangled like that until 10:30, when Narcissa knocked on the door to tell them to get ready, so they uncurled themselves from each other and walked over to their wardrobe to get dressed. Harkin picked one of her baby doll style dresses to cover her small baby bump, while Draco went with his normal black slacks, dress shirt, and tie. Draco shrunk their trunks and slipped them in his pocket before taking Harkin’s hand, and they walked downstairs to meet Narcissa, Severus, Hermione, and Theo in the foyer.
“Don’t you want to see if he wakes up?”
“How do you know that?”
“Better. I had to force a calming draught down Draco’s throat when he got here, but Harkin and the baby are in surprisingly in good health considering the way you found her.” Mel said as Narcissa watch her son’s sleeping condition. He was lying on the bed next to Harkin not touching her except with his left hand over her stomach.
“Don’t cry, fawn. Everything will work out just the way that it is supposed to, but just in case.” Sirius said as he pulled her away from him so he could reach into his pocket, and he pulled out his wand and a small box. “For safe keeping.” Sirius stated. “You can take a peek in the box if you want, but it’s for someone else.” Sirius whispered in her ear, and she looked up and knew who he was talking about.
“Sometimes I wonder if you should actually be a Gryffindor.” Draco stated.
Draco and Harry curled up on the couch next to each other and waited for Tonks’ friends to arrive or Draco’s mother to come back. Sadly, Narcissa and Andromeda came home before the Aurors could arrive to take Lucius away. Andromeda noticed the mess in her house as soon as she walked through the door.
“Hey, he got me out of trouble with Umbridge, and he said something’s, and if he can prove he’s not lying I’ll believe him. Why what did you think we were doing? I’m a girl now, it’s not like I’m going to go around throwing punches.” Harry said as she started walking over to the closet striping off her clothes.
“Nope.”
“Talking about Lucius again?”
Narcissa knocked on the door, and the person who opened the door looked almost exactly like Draco’s mother, and she most definitely was not the aunt Harry or Draco were expecting. “Cissy? What are you doing here? I haven’t seen you since I married Ted, and mother disowned me. What do you want?” the woman asked, and then her eyes landed on Draco and Harry clutching Draco’s arm. “Cissy, is this Draco? He grew up nice, and who is this nice young man with you?”
The Healer gave Draco every single spell that he performed on Harry, and the list that was also in his chart that some of the nurses cast on him. “Satisfied, Mr. Malfoy?”
She felt dizzy and groggy as a hand slipped farther down her body and looped around her skirt, knickers and panties, and they were then around her knees. Harry finally found words, and whispered, “Please, don’t.”
“I won’t if I can avoid it. You two will probably be put on a watch list if they find out. Meaning if you step out of line even slightly they will take you down. Now another thing, this potion locks you into any magic that was irreversible before making any chance of you turning back impossible. You will be stuck as a woman forever there is no changing back.”
“Protection spells?” Draco questioned, and then his eyes grew. “Protection spells!”
“When Draco was a baby, I used to bring him in here when I tended to the flowers. When I was done I’d b ring him in here and sit down in this window seat and read to him. Most of the time he would fall asleep on my chest, but I’d continue reading. Did you know that babies can absorb information in their sleep? I didn’t not then anyway, so I read him anything and everything from romance novels to research books in the library.
“Rahr.” Teddy leaned forwards and pecked Harry on the cheek, and then Andromeda scooped the boy out of Harry’s arms. “Thanks, Annie.”
“There is no need for the attitude, Mr. Malfoy.”
“No, dinner is still at the same time.” Narcissa stated, and Draco nodded in confirmation.
“Let’s get some food in you and then take you to your healer appointment.” Narcissa said as she helped them up. They started walking out of the garden when a house elf appeared in front of them.
“Harry, we heard what happened and we were worried about you, and now I’m most definitely worried, why are you in the hospital wing with Malfoy curled around you?” Hermione asked as she stepped around the bed with Ron circling the other direction. Hermione stood on Harry’s side while Ron stood on Draco’s side.
“Yeah, because that is so easy. How do you expect me to do that when you can’t even do that?” Harry asked as she turned around to face the door again.
“Alright, while we are waiting, I’m going to take Harkin for a spin around the dance floor really quick.” Draco smirked, and Harkin stared up at him in fear.
“Sorry, Harry, dear. I’m just glad to see you up and about. How are you doing?”
“That also makes me want to get pregnant even less.” Pansy stated.
“Luna, you can’t ask someone how is dead where something is.”
“Where is Fred? I don’t think I’ve ever seen that two of you apart.”
“Yeah, the sorting hat found it brave and courageous so I was put in Gryffindor. Is that weird?”
“Alright kiddo, num-num.” Harry set the one bottle down and uncapped the bottle that Teddy gestured to.
“You know you are ineligible to be her guardian until you are cleared?” Severus asked.
“I’m your family healer, and we went to school together, of course. It’s not even a question, Cissy. Plus her and Draco look beautiful together; I can’t believe she’s Harry Potter, like damn.”
“Nott as in Theodore Nott.” Hermione gasped.
“Six months ago, when you realized Draco wasn’t you, and you weren’t your father. He’s dead, darling, you don’t have to keep trying to impress him. Children are like flowers, you can only support them for so long before you have to let them grow on they’re own. We need to let our baby dragon spread his wings and fly. That doesn’t make him any less my baby dragon.” Narcissa stated, and Lucius just nodded in response.
Harry smiled, and she whispered, “Thanks Siri.” Harry then turned to see Draco standing off to the side awkwardly. “Siri, I want you to officially meet Draco.” She said as she took Draco’s hand, pulling him over. “Draco, this is Sirius; Sirius, this is Draco. Don’t hurt him, Siri.” Harry stated as Sirius’ lip quirked upwards.
“You shouldn’t know that. How do you know that?” Harkin whispered. “We need to talk to Severus.” Harkin stated as she stood up and pulled Draco from the couch.
“Draco isn’t going to find out. He can’t know; no one can know. Do you understand? No one can find out what he did. Once one person finds out everyone knows, and I can’t deal with people looking at me like that. Promise me you won’t tell anyone what I just said.”
“Yes, she is only at the start of her second trimester, can you let her eat now, Pansy?” Draco stated, and this time it was Pansy that rolled her eyes. Draco loaded a plate full of food for her, and he placed the plate in front of her after.
“It’s alright to scream, Potter. I don’t mind; it’s not like anyone can hear you.” Rodolphus picked up a small knife with no curve, the blade was probably the length of Harry’s pinky finger. Rodolphus then walked up to Harry and pushed the blade into his gut. “The human anatomy is very interesting, Potter, did you know that? I know where I can stab you without it being fatal. I love torture also if you haven’t figured that out, Potter, and I haven’t even gotten to the good stuff.” Rodolphus stabbed him over and over again, and Harry was barely holding in the screams. Finally, he pulled away. “Well, you aren’t any fun, Potter. You don’t scream, do you? I guess I’ll have to try something a little bigger.”
“It’s good to see your, Potter.”
“Already taken care of.” Draco said as he took Harkin’s left hand and kissed her palm; showing off Harkin’s engagement ring in the process.
“I won’t do what Father wants me to do. Not if he gets hurt, Mother. Please, don’t make me do this, I don’t care if I have to do something else I just don’t want to lose him, please, Mother.” Draco did more begging than he has ever done before, just to make sure Harry was safe.
When it reached the top, Draco was about to knock when he heard a faint, “Come in, Draco.” And the door opened before he touched it. He stepped inside and up to the desk that Dumbledore was sitting behind. “What is it that you wished to speak to me about, my boy?”
“Oh, Ronald.” Hermione took Ron’s face in her hands and she kissed him. When she pulled away, Hermione pulled Ron towards his bed and pulled Ron with her. They laid down and curled around one another and fell asleep.
Lucius stared at her as she pulled her hair up into a ponytail until Harry saw he was staring. “What? Do I have something on my face?” she asked as she whipped at her face.
“Yes, sir.” Draco said while Harkin did a quick head nod.
“Love, breathe. You just need to breathe.” Draco whispered in her ear as he rubbed circles on her back.
Harry and Draco looked at each other before climbing out of bed and walking over to the bathroom to shower before getting dressed. Draco pulled his trunk out of his trouser pocket and then Harry’s unshrinking them in the process, and then he opened his and started pulling out clothes for himself that he started pulling on. When Draco was finished, he stood up straight and looked over at Harry, who was standing in a beautiful dress.
“Alright, Bellatrix, where are you?” Harkin yelled. “Come out to play. I know that is what you want, right?” Harkin taunted.
“Thanks, Tally, and don’t tell anyone about this even if they ask you, even me.” Draco whispered back, not trusting his voice, and he took the cloak from the small elf and she disappeared with a small nod. Draco put the cloak in his trunk and placed wards around it so only he can open it. Draco checked the time with a quick tempus charm and saw he missed dinner. He changed into his pajamas and crawled into bed and he fell back asleep.
“No, but Potter’s bookends are going down. With Potter in the hospital wing, and them being together it won’t be long before they start drifting apart, but that’s not the point. They don’t really like me after the whole offering the chosen one up to the Dark Lord thing.”
They reappeared outside the gates of Hogwarts where Snape let them in and they walked up to the castle together. They went straight up to Dumbledore’s office and burst into in. McGonagall was sitting in front of the desk with Dumbledore behind.
“Sure why not I already feel like a doll.” Harry whispered with a smile.
“We have to place him under the stasis charm now. The Dark Lord’s soul is seeking him out.” He pulled his wand and started chanting a spell. “Draco, you have to move now.” Snape said and then continued his chanting. Draco placed Harry down on the settee, and he whispered into Harry’s ear before moving across the room where he wrapped his fingers around the top of one of the chairs. They could hear the distinctive cracking of the wood as Draco’s knuckles turned white against the dark wood.
“The scratches, too. They look like finger nails.”
“A vampire Miss Weasley. Now if you can keep quiet, I shall try and calm the beast within.”
Draco kept going and slid another finger into Harry’s entrance with the same results, and Harry could barely hold himself together. Harry’s hands were gripping Draco’s shoulders so tight that they were started to leave bruises on his skin. “Dray,” Harry muttered, but he couldn’t finish what he was saying. Draco gathered what Harry was trying to say, and he pulled his fingers out of Harry’s entrance. Harry whimpered as the pressure left his entrance, but was soon followed by a moan as Draco pushed his erection into Harry’s entrance.
“You know you aren’t supposed to encourage their talking habits, you are supposed to correct them.” Someone stated causing Harry to look up.
“I figured that might be the answer.” Harry sat down on the bed in the private room Madam Pomfrey brought him to, and she started casting spells. Harry felt like he was there for hours when he heard the door open, and Madam Pomfrey turned slightly. “I’ll see what they need dear. I’ll be right back.” She hurried from the room, and Harry could hear her talking to someone, but he couldn’t make out the words.
“We better head down before one of them comes back up.” She said and pulled away but kept their hands entwined, and Draco examined the dress a little closer and then looked at his outfit. Draco was wearing a black suit with a white tie and black vest, and he found it a little weird that they matched, but he pushed it out of his mind.
“Ah, Miss Parkinson no doubt, but I assure you, Professor. Harry and I are just talking. I felt that our conversation didn’t need the eavesdropping of the entire school since I noticed a small crowd gathering. Miss Potter and I didn’t need the information to be spread.”
“The cup of Helga Hufflepuff. Found in my aunt’s Gringotts vault.” Draco stated as he set Harry down, and Harry leaned against his chest with Draco’s arms wrapped around him.
“We will gather them yes.” Sirius held out his hand to Narcissa, and Draco stood up with Harry in his arms. Sirius escorted them out of the room and found all of their trunks, and Sirius waved his wand and they disappeared. Sirius wrapped his one arm around Draco and Narcissa took his other hand. Sirius waved his wand and they disappeared. When they reappeared they were standing in front of what looked like to be a muggle block of flats in the middle of London. Sirius dropped his arms and walked up to the fence in front of the building and tapped the gate three times, and the building started sliding to the side right in the middle. When the building came to a halt, Sirius strolled forward and indicated for Narcissa and Draco to follow him.
“He is safe for now we don’t know how much time we have before Voldemort takes over. So we are going to bed.”
“And I knew you were there. Help me out of this stupid clothing trap.” Harry said with a huff. Narcissa walked up to her and pulled her into the bathroom where she started unzipping the dress. The dress slipped off with ease, and Narcissa went to work on the corset. Finally after a half an hour, the corset was off, and Narcissa could see all the bruises on Harry’s skin.
“Potter…” Draco tried, but his voice wouldn’t work as Harry pulled the finger out, slowly pushing it in and out of Draco’s entrance. Harry watched Draco’s expression waiting for it to relax so he could push the second finger in, and as Draco’s expression relaxed, Harry pushed his single finger in a few more times before slowly pushing the second finger in, causing Draco’s expression to tighten again.
“I love you, too, Dray.” Harkin whispered.
“Wouldn’t you like to know; now leave before I step out of the shower and hex you.” Draco shouted back. They heard as she stomped out of the room, the door slamming as she left the room. Harry leaned against the shower wall, and Draco slipped his arms between Harry and the wall, one arm wrapped around Harry’s waist and the other around Harry’s hips, pulling Harry back against him. Draco delicately kissed the side of Harry’s neck, and he slowly thrust his hips forwards. Eventually, Harry leaned back in to Draco, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder and tilting his head to the side allowing Draco better access to his neck.
“Yes, my mum and dad were there, and so was Sirius. They were happy and together. Grimmauld looked beautiful not the run down dump it is now. My mum told me that we would talk soon, that we didn’t have time right now, because it wasn’t my time yet. I still had work to do. I had to finish what I started. She was really there, she hugged me and told me to be brave. She said some other things to, but those were private things.”
“What did you do, Severus?” Narcissa shouted as she ran to Draco and Harry’s side. “What happened?”
“Master Harry isn’t doing very well, Master Draco. Her screaming has increased even as Mistress Narcissa tries to help put the healing slave on her wound. I don’t know how much longer Master Harry will stay alive at the progression of her pain.” Tally said and then she noticed the other people in the room and the elf shied away behind Draco. “Tally is sorry, Master Draco. Tally didn’t know you were in company.”
“But not him. Not yet.” Harry whispered.
“Ginny, you shouldn’t take advantage. He might remember what happened, and still come to the same conclusion. I won’t say any more than that, but you shouldn’t be doing this. You’re one of my closest friends but Ginny, this is wrong, and you know it.”
The Malfoy family’s trial came to an end yesterday and the results surprised almost everyone. Narcissa and Draco Malfoy were released without a hitch, but Lucius was sentenced to a year in Azkaban. It seems that the Malfoy family has an angel looking out for them, and they seem to be working in over drive to get them off.
Harkin then leaned forwards and licked Draco’s erection from base to tip where she focused on licking his slit to collect precum on her tongue with a small moan of her own that was mirrored by Draco. She could feel him starting to wake up as his hips started to thrust up into her mouth, and she placed her hands on his hips forcing them to still so she could breathe while working him. She heard a faint whimper at that, and she smirked around his erection, moaning again, sending vibrations through Draco.
“Of course, Dumbledore set you up. Precise little golden boy.” Draco drawled. “It’s no wonder you Gryffindors always win the house cup.
“Ron? Hermione?” Ginny was the first person to come to the realization that they are really there.
“What do you mean?”
“He’ll come around; he’s just torn, but he’ll come around.” Hermione whispered.
“No one told Draco about it, but he knows.” Harkin stated.
Hermione didn’t want to ruin the beautiful moment between the pair, but then Ron burst that bubble when he strolled into the room and said, “We found it, it’s gone.” But his words were more of a shout than a regular voice. Harry and Draco both turned their heads and Hermione could see the tears streaking down Harry’s face and Draco looked as if he was about to cry because Harry was. Hermione grabbed Ron’s hand before he could go any farther and started pulling him out of the room, to his disappointment.
“That is the poison leaving his system.” Severus explained, and then continued, “Draco is trying to siphon the poison out of Harkin’s system through himself. His magic feels that Harkin and or the twins might not make it if she goes through that.” Severus stated as he pointed to Draco’s retching.
“Yes, that would be nice, Professor.” McGonagall walked into the room, and everyone immediately quieted. She continued through the room and to a spot in the wall Harry hadn’t noticed before, the wall opened up like a door, and they stepped inside and the door closed. The lights flickered on and Harry stood there in amazement staring at the room.
“You are right.” Draco stated as Dumbledore stood up.
“You’re a girl now, and your striping down in front of me.”
“There are two options and I hope the first option is the correct option.”
“Everyone is being just so helpful and kind to me with this transformation, and it is a little overwhelming with how much has happened and been overcome in the last two months. I’m nearly two months pregnant with twins, not to mention I’m female. I was kidnapped by Voldemort and raped by one of his followers, who wants revenge on me and is trying to kill me. I am bonded and engaged to my former school rival, and now basically living with him because I am pregnant with his kids. Not to mention that I can’t play Quidditch this year which is going to make this year a long drag, because that was how I could just be myself and have fun.”
“Hey, I was innocent. It is not my fault I didn’t get a trial after being betrayed by one of my best friends. I would have married you if that didn’t happen.”
“Yeah, kiddo, num-nums.” Harry walked down the stairs and down the hall to the lower room where the kitchen and dining room were. Harry set Teddy in his highchair, and walked over to the cabinet, and he started riffling through what he had. He pulled out two different bottles and held them out to Teddy. “You want these num-nums or these num-nums, kiddo?”
“No, maybe I’m lying to Potter and the Dark Lord. Maybe I’m just waiting for both sides to destroy each other so I can live peacefully, or maybe you are right and I’m playing the headmaster. I guess we won’t find out just yet.” Lucius stated as they came closer, and the doors behind them opened. Harry turned, and her eyes latched onto Sirius’ as he was the first to step through the door. She could see the pain in his eyes as he realized this was her, and not the Dark Lord. Harry’s attention was drawn away as she felt something slid past her leg and she realized it was Nagini heading for Arthur.
Harry started making panted gasps as she tried to unbutton his shirt as he tried to drive her into the same state as he was. Soon she gave up and her one hand found it’s way into his hair as the other caressed his shoulder. “Draco…” Harry moaned. “Too many…clothes.” She gasped as he nipped a little too hard against her skin, but she didn’t mind. She felt Draco move his hand underneath one of the pillows, and he pulled out his wand and gave it a flick and their clothes were gone. She just hoped Draco was in a decent mind set to not make them disappear completely, she kind of like this outfit.
“Yes, I know you don’t like me right now, but you will see it my way soon, Harry Potter. Albus Dumbledore is not as he claims. He is the one who placed you in the home of your relatives and left you there, and I can guarantee that he knew exactly what was going on there and did nothing about it. He left you there to endure the pain. If you honestly think that that man is doing any of the things for you, you are sadly mistaken. That man is only doing any of what he is for his own personal gain.”
“Animagus, I actually didn’t know that.”
“Your cupboard?” she questioned, and Harry tucked her face into Draco’s neck.
“One second.” Harry said as he wrapped his fingers into Draco’s hair and pulled Draco in for a kiss locking his lips with Draco’s and then the second that Draco allowed him, Harry forced his tongue into Draco’s mouth. As abruptly as the kiss started, the kiss ended and Harry pulled away and walked out of the room, leaving Draco just standing there in shock. Harry was down the hall and almost to the dining room, when Draco finally realized that Harry was no longer standing in his room. Draco quickly left his room and hurried to the dining room so it didn’t look to weird that Harry was already there.
“Uh, Har, you are a tease.” Draco groaned as his head hit the pillow.
“Yes, Professor.” Ron gulped as he quickly turned tail and ran, and Harkin sighed before turning and started walking towards their rooms. Draco close behind her, and Severus followed behind them both. They reached their bedroom door, and quietly whispered the password before entering. Harkin hurried over to the bedroom door, and she practically slammed it shut, which startled both Draco and Severus.
“Oh, raven, can I fix this for you?” Draco cooed, and Harkin blushed before nodding. Draco leaned over the edge of the tub to grab his wand out of his pant pocket, and Harkin backed away just enough to give him room to cast the spell. “There. At least the pain and swelling should go down. We will have to get some Bruise-Healing Paste from Madam Pomfrey before breakfast tomorrow for the actual bruise, but it shouldn’t hurt as much.” Draco finished as he placed his wand back on his pants, and he pulled Harkin back into his lap. Harkin snuggled into his lap, and Draco just wrapped his arms around her with one hand resting on her small baby bump. Harkin soon fell asleep, and Draco stood with her in his arms and grabbed a couple of towels off the rack before walking back into their room. He placed one towel on the bed to place Harkin on top of before drying himself, and then taking another towel to dry Harkin off before tucking her into their bed. Draco then pulled on a pair of his pajama pants, and he sat up in bed working on their transfigurations essay. When he finished, he pulled out one of their textbooks and started reading it out loud to mostly himself, but also to the twins and Harkin. Eventually he read himself to sleep, with Harkin cradled in his one arm and the textbook lying across his chest.
“Oh course, my Lord.” Snape said as he stood, and the four of them with Nagini following walked up to Harry’s room. When they put two floors between the ball room and themselves, the adults turned towards Harry.
Harry’s one hand moved from the wall and reached for the hand that was wrapped around his hip, slowly pushing it downwards. “Touch me, Dray. Please, I need you to…” Harry sighed as Draco’s fingers wrapped around Harry’s waiting cock. Harry turned his head and met Draco’s lips, and they kissed until Draco pulled away slightly.
“Let me relish, in him caring about me.” Harry sat up abruptly dislodging Ginny from the bed and she landed on the floor.
“Harry, we’ll talk to McGonagall, she could send a letter to them and I’m sure if Sirius and Remus care about you they’ll understand, they’re from magic, right?” Harry just stared laughing at that and she couldn’t stop. “What’s so funny?” Draco asked with a chuckle.
“How long have you and Harry been having sex?”
“No, not yet Severus.”
“Yes, unfortunately, Professor Snape noticed the strain, and advised me to drop the charm for the sake of Harkin’s and the twin’s health.” Draco explained.
“I never said it wasn’t. It is just like how if Harry was still a boy she wouldn’t be able to marry Draco, but would be acceptable if Draco married a woman and saw Harry on the side.” Remus explained farther.
“Harry, I was kidding. I didn’t know that you had a nightmare last night, but I also slept soundly; you didn’t disturb my sleep at all, Babe. Tell me about this nightmare that you keep having,” Draco soothed as he was brushing Harry’s hair out of his eyes, and then entangling his fingers in Harry’s hair. Draco pulled him close and gave Harry a light kiss on the lips as encouragement.
Harry is different now, if only everyone else can accept it like she has, and new relationships are explored.
“Yes, Mr. Potter you may. I will fetch her now, and bring you some different clothes to change into for now.” McGonagall walked out of the room, and Harry sat there waiting for them to return. When they did, McGonagall handed Harry some of his clothes, and everyone stepped out of the room while he changed. Harry finished and he stepped out of the room to see McGonagall, Hermione, and Madam Pomfrey staring at him.
As they reached the front doors Narcissa came out, and started saying, “Lucius who was at the gate, and…” she stilled as she saw Harry and Voldemort standing there. “My Lord.” Narcissa curtsied. “We were not expecting you.”
“Maybe, I don’t know. We can’t dance so I don’t know.” Harkin whispered, and Draco sighed before twirling them in the direction of Remus and Draco switched Harkin into Remus’ arms and somehow managed to twirl them back onto the dance floor with ease. Harkin and Remus then kind of swayed on the dance floor to the music, and he kissed her on top of her head.
“Yes. Why do you ask, Potter?”
“I’ve been better.” she said as she looked towards the door. “Where’s Harry?”
“Better…” Draco moaned and Harry’s fingers tightened in his hair.
He just sits there as Dudley and his friends hold him down and beat him bruising his ribs, every day it’s something new, and Dudley soon figures out to keep the bruises in places that people won’t see unless they see Harry without his clothes on. Harry just wishing one day that it would stop.
“That’s alright, Madam Pomfrey. I’m in no rush to change back especially if it’ll do more damage than good.” Harry stated, and Madam Pomfrey nodded.
“No, but I don’t think that he will spill all his secrets, even if it affects you and Harry, darling.” Narcissa stated.
“What?” Harkin asked as she looked up at Lucius, who had anger printed clearly on his face, which scared Harkin slightly.
“Daphne, how are you?” Draco asked.
“How do they bloom every two weeks?” Harry asked.
“Draco, calm down. She doesn’t want you to look at her any different, so she didn’t want us to tell you, or well, anyone, but we had to. Please, just come out in the hall with me for a little air.” Narcissa soothed her son and pulled him from the room. When the door was firmly shut, Severus continued.
“He has Harry held captive in his own mind, and he’s in there trying to get out.” Draco stated. “I can’t just let him hid in there without doing something about it. He needs me.” Draco said as he looked back at Harry’s face, but the look in his eyes was wrong. There was a fire there that wasn’t Harry, and then there was a flash through his eyes it was brief where he could see Harry in his eyes again, but it was gone as soon as it was there. “Get out of him. Now!” Draco yelled as slammed him into the ground and automatically felt the pain in the back of his head but he pushed it aside. He saw the look in Harry’s eyes and he saw him. He saw Harry there. “I’m going to save you, Harry just keep fighting. We’ll figure something out, I promise.” Draco said and then he watched as Harry slumped in his arms. Draco looked up at Severus and saw his wand drawn. “What did you do?”
“Hello, Dobby. How are you doing?”
“I’m sorry.” Harkin whispered as she burst into tears and tried to escape the compartment before Severus caught her and pulled her into his chest. Harkin cried into his chest until she fell asleep, and Severus picked her up and placed her on the bench.
“How can you trust him, after everything he’s done?”
“Cissa, what did you do?”
“Snape?” Harry questioned.
“Possibly. You are dismissed.” Draco waved his arm and the healer looked at Draco like he just killed his best friend in front of him without a second thought. “Leave, you’ve done enough.” Draco ordered again. And Draco walked over to Harry and he started writing. He wrote in one column the list of spells that he had to perform as the counter to the dark magic. In the second column he wrote the list of spells that the healers and nurses at St. Mungos performed to help Harry.
“You lied, Lucius. You are helping Harry steal the prophecy.”
Draco stared at the letter, and he wondered how he was going to sneak into the Gryffindor common room. Draco already snuck the Marauder’s Map away from Ron, and he was sure that neither of them were going to try and pack up Harry’s things. He just had to find a way into Harry’s room in Gryffindor tower, and that’s when he noticed something scribbled on the bottom of the page.
“Love, I think the only thing you’ll see is concern. They all love you and want to make sure you’re alright.” Draco tried.
“Yes, we’ll go to the Manor first for you to fill out that paperwork, and then I can go to the Ministry for Mr. Black.” Lucius said, and then he stepped through the flames.
“Yes, my mother is trying to figure out how to destroy it.”
Andromeda walked back into the room, and she was about to say something, when she saw Draco and Harry. She stopped in her tracks and stared at the two of them, and she turned to Narcissa. “Cissy, are Draco and Harry… together?” She asked as she glanced back at Draco and Harry.
“Love, why don’t you come sit with me?” Draco said, and Harkin turned around and the cold instantly went away as Harkin sprung out of her seat and into Draco’s already outstretched arms.
“There’s nothing to be nervous about, my dear. I want to talk about the possibility that you can’t get pregnant. This is a major possibility considering your predicament, and I want you to know you will still be a part of this family if you can’t get pregnant. I want Draco to be happy before I care about him producing an heir, that’s Lucius. There are other ways to have children, so I just don’t want you to worry if that’s the case.”
“Unfortunately, yes. And I have no idea what is rolling through his subconscious and if he can fight it off on his own.”
“Ah, Miss Potter. How are you feeling?”
“I don’t know how far I drained him but he probably would have been dead in a minute or two if my mother hadn’t walked in when she did. I heard her voice, the fear, and I looked up at her, and then down at Harry and I couldn’t believe I’d done it. My mother was going to try and help me as long as I didn’t feed I would have been fine. I shattered her dream of having her son alright in the time she left and came back to find me draped over him. I could have killed him, I never wanted him dead, but I was so thirsty.” Draco wrapped his arms around himself as he spoke trying to comfort himself, but it didn’t work, until he felt his mother’s arms around him.
"I’ll be back, love. I promise. And I’ll bring you some homework.” Draco said as he went to get up, and he kissed the top of her head and finished, “Get some more sleep, love. You look tired.” He grabbed his bag and walked out of the room.
“Okay that’s easy enough. I think I’ve got that.” Harkin said.
“Why would you leave something so important somewhere but on your person, Miss Granger?”
“So, it doesn’t mean that I knew that you knew, Zabini.” Harry stated as he glared back at Blaise. Blaise looked at Harry and raised his eyebrow.
“Yeah, I’m tired. Why did you have other plans, Dray?”
“And we won’t have to worry about our children not inheriting anything from us because they were born out of wedlock.” Harkin whispered.
“You don’t sound to convinced, my raven.” Draco whispered into her ear, and he nipped at her earlobe briefly.
“Harry, we have to move this to the shower. Someone is here to see us and Mother’s expression didn’t look like we were going to like this person.” Harry quickly stood up and Draco picked her up and swung her into his arms as he carried her over to the shower. Draco started by washing his hair and scrubbing his body in the time Harry finished washing her body. Draco squirted some shampoo in his hands, and he started shampooing Harry’s hair. She leaned into the touch, and Draco rinsed her hair, and they stepped out of the shower and quickly dried off and got dressed.
Hey, sorry about the wait, but next chapter is here, and i hope that i will be finishing this one up soon and finish posting everything. I think i might have possibly broken the writers block that i had, plus life happened, and stress rather doesn't help writing really. but enough of my babbling enjoy the next chapter i hope you like it.
“I’m not saying I’m not scared. I just am not going to hide in the shadows because someone is after me. Someone is always after me, I’ve gotten used to that in my five years in the wizarding world.”
“I don’t know.” Draco muttered back.
“What has Severus done to our son?” Lucius asked as he turned to his wife.
“Oh, I know. Molly Weasley will get what’s coming to her as well, but for right now, I’m starting with you, Potter. Which in the end will help me with my revenge on Molly Weasley as well.”
“Is that why you care about him so much, because your life is tied to his?” Ron asked.
“I wouldn’t have a clue how to dress even if I tried. Thank you.” she smiled, and then leaned in and kissed him on the lips. She wrapped her arms around his neck and she rolled so she was on her back, and Draco came most of the way with her and then rearranged himself so he was lying on top of her. He slipped his hand underneath her dress, and his fingers played with the edge of her knickers. Harkin took her hand and slipped it up her dress to meet Draco’s and she took the knickers and helped him pull them down. Draco getting the invitation, and he finished pulling them off as she let go and relaxed against the pillows.
“It probably doesn’t help the effect our bond has on one another. I am learning to open up more while she is learning to mask herself more. It is both a good thing and a bad thing.” Draco stated.
“I’m pregnant with twins, Hermione, and the marriage thing is what is bothering you?”
Harry woke up in St. Mungos with a lot of pain in his chest and just all over, causing him to groan. He felt presser on his hand, which made him open his eyes. All he saw was a blurry blob, and he blinked trying to regain focus, when he realized he didn’t have his glasses on. “Glasses?” Harry tried but his voice didn’t work. He started to freak out a little when his glasses were pushed on his face and the person came into view.
“Because knowing you are famous and actually witnessing it are two different things, raven.” Draco explained. “Ronald is the last son of 6 before the coveted daughter, and he finally had a friend that was his, someone he didn’t have to be jealous of because you were his, and the adventures that you went on the first two years were fun and something you did together, and third year happened and you had your godfather after you, so he wanted to protect you. Then fourth year happened, and your name came out of the goblet of fire. Your enemies coming to get you, though everyone saw it as Harry Potter getting away with breaking the rules again, only this time Ronald wasn’t involved, you did this without him. Now he is jealous of your fame and the capability that he can now see of you moving away from him. Then Voldemort came back, but you were the only surviving witness to the horror of his return, and how does ones friend cope with the growing attention your best friend is now getting, attention that you aren’t receiving as well. He pushed you away, because now you are better than him.” Draco stated, and Harkin gave him a questioning look.
“If Draco doesn’t find me first.” Harkin stated with a smirk across her face.
“What happened to her?” she asked as she hurried to the bed and started casting diagnostic charms.
“Sorry, Draco. This is new to me; this potion is incredibly old, and no one has used it in centuries. It was originally used as an abortion potion until they realized how dangerous it was for the women who drank it. So, they banned the use of it for medical purposes, and then later for any form of use, because people were forcing women to drink it in cases of cheating spouses accidentally getting their mistresses pregnant. Your father must be extremely desperate to get rid of the twins if he has stooped this low.” Melody explained, and Draco turned his head with and angry glare.
“I don’t deserve you, my dragon.” Harkin whispered, and Draco smiled at her.
“Harry, what are you doing? My mother is standing right over there,” Draco whispered as he looked into Harry’s eyes and melted into his hand. “What will she think about us?”
“Is it normal for her to be this tired?” Draco asked.
“In the very room that I placed him in. He ambushed Draco and me, but Draco had the upper hand seeing as the Dark Lord hasn’t completely figured out how to control Harry yet. Draco got a message through to Harry, and told him to fight his way out on his own mind. Now, I will wait to explain the rest because I don’t feel like repeating myself when all of the teachers arrive.”
“You remind me of what my mother may have looked like had she not been treated the way she had by my uncle, grandfather, and father. She could have been very beautiful, like you.” Voldemort said as he stroked back a strand of her hair. Harry just stared with wide eyes as he pulled her around the dance floor. He was treating her this way because she reminded him of his mother. She didn’t know how to process that.
Draco just looked him in the eyes and said, “Boyfriends. I think, unless that’s not what you want, because it seems like you rather like kissing me a lot. And I know that I definitely like kissing you, Harry.”
I really want to apologize for not posting regularly. I've been trying to, but it seems life gets in the way. i guess that's what i get for having a polyamorous relationship with my partners. hope you enjoyed. leave comments if you did. i love hearing good things.
“Thank you, Narcissa.” Harry whispered.
joyful, the spirit you spread. A
Draco said, “We’ll be right down just finishing getting ready.” Draco smirked and his mother just nodded, and she stepped back as Draco shut the door as he turned to go back and quickly finish his bath that was going to become a shower.
Draco matched his thrusts inside her with the slow pace he set, and Harry felt as if she was going to explode with passion. “Dray…f-faster…” Harry attempted, and Draco must have understood because his pace slowly quickened until it was a brutal pace. Harry was having a hard time with the sensations and just let Draco have his way, and she just laid there a panting moaning mess as he thrusted into her. Soon Draco’s cumming inside her and they are both screaming out in ecstasy as they finish.
“You weren’t expecting that were you?” Bellatrix laughed.
“I should be asking you what the matter is.” Harry said as he pulled Draco closer to him, and he forced Draco to wrap his arms around him. “What’s wrong?”
“How many plants are in here?” Harry asked as they walked past some plants she recognized from Herbology.
“I am not going anywhere. I will come back every day if that is what you want but I have to take care of this.”
Harry pulled his fingers out of Draco rather harshly and he pulled Draco’s legs up around his shoulders and lodged his erection inside of Draco, causing Draco to scream out. “Harry! My god, keep going.” Draco grabbed Harry’s hips and pulled them forwards, and Harry screamed as Draco thrusted Harry’s erection into himself. Harry took that notion and started thrusting himself into Draco; Draco letting out a small groan as each thrust went into him.
“In the closet for right now, Cali. I will speak to Harry about it when she wakes.”
“Oh, I’m sorry, dear. I guess we should have thought about you being trapped in this room by yourself. Do you want me to tear Draco away from what he’s doing for you?” Narcissa asked.
“For Draco, and our new relationship and the future that we have with each other.” Harry pushed memories of the past week towards Voldemort and moments that Harry had with Draco before then anything and everything that showed the true feelings they had for each other.
“Remus. He looks so sad without Sirius here.” Harkin whispered, and Draco looked up and saw him.
“Harry, what’s the matter? What are you talking about? Of course I want this, why wouldn’t I want this?” Draco injected as he stood up and wrapped his arms around Harry. Harry tried to pull away, but Draco held him tight. “No, Harry, hear me out. Please. I can’t lose you, Harry. I just can’t.” Harry looked at Draco and he saw the look in his eyes that said that he was serious.
“Well, there are many options for that, and being fifth years, we’ll be having talks with our head of house about where we want to go after school, since we’ll be able to drop classes after we take our O.W.L.s this spring, and focus our schooling more onto the career we want to go into.”
Draco heard the incantations being said by Madam Pomfrey as he stepped back and sat in the chair. Draco refrained from reaching out and grabbing Harry’s wrist as that would look strange to Harry, because he would most likely not remember anything after the torture. He would probably be freaking out that he’s sleeping in the hospital wing at Hogwarts. Draco just hopes that there wasn’t any more damage done than that. Draco didn’t hear the incantation coming from Madam Pomfrey anymore and he looked up at her.
“Yeah, I’ll go and get her from class. She has potions right now, so Professor Slughorn will let her leave. Especially, if it has anything to do with you. I’ll be right back don’t ask any questions until either I get back or Andromeda shows up alright?”
She found the nearest bathroom and bolted inside. She barely made it to the toilet before vomiting, and she heard Draco come in behind her, he came and brushed her hair away from her face and pulled it behind her so she didn’t get anything in her hair. When she finally stopped throwing up, Draco pulled her into his lap and wrapped his arms around her, and Harkin leaned into him and wrapped her arms around his neck. Draco leaned in and kissed her on the lips, but she pulled away from him. “I probably smell like vomit.” She whispered.
Draco’s lips kissed down Harry’s length, and he ran his tongue across Harry’s tip, forcing a little whimper out of Harry as Draco took in his length. “Bloody hell!” Harry screamed as his fingers found their way into Draco’s hair pushing him down farther onto his erection. Draco started massaging Harry’s erection with his tongue causing Harry to moan, “Dra…” Draco moved his tongue along Harry’s length causing Harry to cut off his sentence. Draco pulled away after realizing what Harry said.
“Exactly.” Draco said. “So I ask again what’s the potion supposed to do?”
“There is such a thing as blankets, Draco.” Pansy stated placing her hands on her hips. Draco just glared at her and turned back to Blaise.
“And if given the wrong answers?”
“Ah, there you two are. Mel is checking Harry’s vitals then she’ll check Draco’s before he can go inside.” Lucius explained.
“What too much of that in your youth.” Draco joked, but the minute he saw the look in Harry’s eyes he wanted to take the statement back. “Harry, I’m sorry I didn’t know.”
“Whoa.” Harry whispered as the garden came into view. “How are they in bloom right now?” Harry asked as she stepped towards the garden and then she stuttered.
“How can you tell it’s me? It took me a little while to get used to looking in the mirror.”
“Severus, all I see is us.” Draco whispered and he heard as someone rushed toward them, and Draco turned and came face to face with Harry. Draco pounced and pinned him to the ground. “Harry?”
“Harry?” Draco’s voice pulled Harry out of his thoughts, and he glanced up at Draco with sadness in his eyes expecting Draco to tell him that he didn’t want to be friends with him anymore. “Harry, what’s the matter?” Draco’s hand went up to caress Harry’s cheek, and he forced Harry to look him in the eyes. “Harry? Listen to me, please.”
“Draco, have you ever been fuck?” Harry asked as he halted his movement to let Draco answer.
“Easy.” Harkin stated as she started pooling her magic, and she could slowly feel the magic expanding around her until she felt it pause and started to build up around them, pushing against the wards until they broke with an explosion. Harkin wasn’t expecting that as small derby fell from the rafters. Harkin tried to avoid it, and watched as one of the rafters broke free, and fell right on top of Bellatrix, pinning her to the ground.
“I would never deprive my sister of her first grandchild. She always wanted a little girl.” Bellatrix cooed as she placed her hand on Harkin’s stomach making her flinch. “So, until this baby is out, I won’t hurt you. After that I will cut one piece off you at a time and mail them to my traitorous nephew.” Bellatrix screamed.
“She told you that you are vulnerable, didn’t she?” Harry turned his head away from Draco and looked to Snape.
“Say that to the people who let your relatives beat you, and do nothing about it when they knew you were being beaten. What does that say about their government that they can stand by, and know that I child is being mistreated, but sit and do nothing about it. That isn’t how children should be treated. Children are precious and should be cherished. I didn’t want to go after you when you were a child but it was necessary for my survival.”
“Your mother is a scary woman when she wants to be.” Melody stated.
“Now, what is it that you want to talk about, Severus?”
“Harry, do you want to tell us something?”
“Great, so we won’t know if we’re affected until it happened. Did Uncle Sev explain what he did?” Draco asked.
Narcissa looked at Lucius and gave him a questioning look. “Lucius, why do you want to talk to Draco? Can’t it wait until later, when Harry isn’t present here at the Manor?”
“I don’t know. I’ve never liked him and he’s never liked me as far as I know.” Harry said. “Why am I so open about this? You’ve been trying to kill me for 14 years.”
He watched her fall asleep, and then he made his way back to the dining room. Where he walked over to his parents, who were getting the dining room ready for the party that night. “Mum.” Draco said as he walked up to her, and she turned.
He opened the door to find himself standing on the playground at school, and Dudley and his friends were after him. He was about eight. Dudley and his friends finally got him, and they broke his arm. Dudley threatened that if he told his other arm would be broken as well. Harry’s sitting in the principal’s office with the Dursley’s, and the principal is asking him who did it, but he just cowers curled in the chair in fear that his other arm is going to be broken tomorrow if he tells.
“Let’s work on your potions essay shall we?” he said as he took Harry’s hand and entwined their fingers together as he pulled her over to the desk that now held two chairs instead of one. Harry sat in one while Malfoy sat in the other, and Harry looked into his eyes for a moment before they started working on Harry’s essay. By the time it was complete it was almost 7:30 and breakfast was about to start. Harry and Draco had completed it with a very nice analysis of why the potion might have reacted the way that it did, and why Harry might have been changed into a woman.
“Ah, Severus. Have you come with any news?”
Draco looked her up and down, checking her out, before smiling and taking her hand, and he lead her from the closet and down to the dining room. When they walked into the dining room, Harkin froze as she saw Sirius and Remus sitting at the table talking to Narcissa and Lucius. “Siri, Remy.” Harkin whispered, and the two men looked up at her and smiled.
“Yeah, a little bit. I think I will always be insecure about who I am; no one can help me get over that and what happened to me. Yes, somethings can help me forget about it, but it will always be there in my life, and I can’t change that.” Harkin stated.
“Mr. Malfoy and Miss Potter, may I ask what you are doing in here?”
“Sweetheart, you should have these looked at, make sure nothings infected.”
“Why?”
“Is this what you do in your free time, Dray? Sit and read your textbooks.” Harkin asked as she looked at the textbook and started reading the text he was reading. “Dray, we haven’t even covered that chapter yet.” Harkin questioned.
When Draco lifted his head, he turned towards Narcissa, and he asked, “When will dinner be served?” Narcissa turned towards him and glared at him.
“Yeah, same here. I mean really what did he think we were doing in here,” Harry joked as he laughed and Draco joined in. Soon the two boys were kissing again. Just kissing, incase Lucius or Narcissa wanted to come and check on them again. They were kissing for about twenty minutes when Harry pulled away suddenly.
“I may be able to help with that.” Luna said as she walked into the room and up to the settee. “Is Harry going to be alright?”
After he finally came inside her, he pulled out of her quickly, and he cleaned himself and got dressed. He walked out of the room without another word, just leaving Harry tied to the bed naked, covered in bruises and her own blood, and she just knew this was only the start of her pain. Harry turned her head to the side and closed her eyes, and she quickly fell asleep.
“We don’t know why they are here yet. Just give Severus a chance to explain.” Draco whispered back, and he pulled her towards the table.
“Everything is going to be alright, love. You’re going to be fine, I know you are. You are safe I’d never let anything happen to you, I promise.” Draco continued whispering sweet nothings in her ear and the whimpers slowly stopped and the shivers stopped soon after. Draco pulled her closer against his chest, and he moved for the second potion placing them against her lips, and the second potion went down like the first. Draco started to feel like part of him was being pulled from him; he felt this pull, and he didn’t know what that meant. He could feel his magic starting to swirl around him, and then this unknown magic, but he was pretty sure it was Harry’s.
In their third year, when Sirius broke out of Azkaban, Draco was furious with him then to; he said that Harry should have never gone after Sirius, and risked his life like that. Even though he found out that Sirius was his godfather, didn’t betray his parents, and he only killed Peter Pettigrew because he was the one that betrayed his parents. Draco still thought it was dangerous to make that trip, plus Harry saved Ron Weasley that year, too. His stupid rat was Peter Pettigrew, the animagus that he was; everyone that knew that were dead or not saying because everyone thought Pettigrew was dead or Sirius was a mass murderer anyway, why wouldn’t he try and get out of a sentence.
“I don’t care who I bunk with, Minerva. I just know that I have to go back for Teddy’s sake. Don’t treat me special because of who I am or what I did. Bunk me with whoever you want.”
“You see why your mother scares me now, Draco,” Harry said as he untangled his arms from around Draco, and he started walking away, when Draco caught his wrist.
“You will find the complete truth in due time, Potter. In due time. Just let me fix you first, alright?” Draco covered, and he thought he covered pretty well.
“She is safe. There are blood wards that protect her.”
“Thank you, Narcissa, but you don’t have to stay there if you don’t want to.”
“No, he just needs some sleep and he should be good in the morning, Granger.” Malfoy chuckled as he carried Harry up the stairs. “Now, you know where the eighth year dorm is, right?”
“Alright, I won’t push.” Hermione left the subject drop. The next week went by slowly, but it became bearable when Andromeda would bring Teddy to visit, and soon enough, it was time to be discharged and he was packing the night before the train left for Hogwarts. He finished packing and went to bed, where Teddy was fast asleep curled in his covers.
“I think I can handle that.”
“You are family now Miss Potter, I cannot deny that especially when I see the two of you. Which brings me to my next order of business. The two of you officially getting married. I understand your guardianship will be called into question, but I’ve been over the paperwork behind what Dumbledore did in 1981, and he had no right to relocate you, meaning you technically have no guardians, because no one technically claimed you after your parents’ deaths. Black was arrested, and Lupin wouldn’t have been able in his condition without Black. Dumbledore had no rights to you, but your mother had one other guardian she appointed.”
“The Dursley’s?” Narcissa questioned, and Harkin nodded. “Does Draco know? Would he be able to explain?” Narcissa asked, and Harkin nodded again.
“Alright.” Harry turned to Hermione, and she looked like she wanted to say something. “Hermione, what is it?”
“That is best. Severus and I figured out how to reverse the condition she’s in to stabilize her. Both she and the baby are fine. The bond still exists; it’s just stabilized, so she is able to carry the baby. I want to keep a close eye on both of them, every two weeks would be preferable.”
“He is. I can see and smell the fear on you when I asked that. Harry was your first and you didn’t kill him.”
“No, Harry. You aren’t going to implode or anything. You shouldn’t have anymore issues unless it is related to your actual pregnancy. Your families are waiting for you in my office.”
The next morning Harkin woke up to find Draco curled around her, and she snuggled deeper into him trying to get deeper into his smell and warmth. Draco chuckled as he buried his face into the top of her head and inhaled her smell as well. They laid like that for a while until Draco cast a Tempus charm to see what time it was, and they panicked for it was almost 8 o’clock, and breakfast was mostly over, and they should be getting ready for classes. Draco and Harkin jumped out of the bed and quickly headed to the bathroom to wash up before pulling on their school uniforms to head to their first class of the day.
“Where is it?” Draco asked.
He released her and grabbed her hand before they disapparated, and when they reappeared, they were standing outside a house Harry knew from her dreams the previous year. The Riddle Manor. Harry wanted to run, but Nott held onto her broken arm so tightly that she was surprised she didn’t feel any more pain there. Which was probably not a good thing. Nott pulled her up to the house and knocked on the front door, and they stood there for a few minutes before someone opened the door and Harry gasped. There in the doorway stood Voldemort.
“Harry,” Draco said as he pulled Harry on top of him so she was straddling his waist. Harry rested her head against Draco’s chest with her long, raven hair fanned out across his white dress shirt. Draco took his hand and brushed all of her hair to one side, and Harry lifted her head and looked Draco in the eyes. “Lunch?” Draco asked as his hand caressed Harry’s jaw.
“Malfoy.” Sirius sneered.
“Thank you, sir. I noticed that he seemed strained, but he kept insisting that he was fine, and I didn’t want to push him.” Harkin stated.
Harry woke and didn’t understand why she was so warm, and she felt like she was constricted. She tried to turn and found Draco wrapped around her, and she smiled before snuggling into his chest, but something felt off Draco was burning to the touch warmer than he should be, and Harry started to panic. Harry tried to pull away from Draco but his arms tightened and he moaned against the top of her head. Harry wasn’t sure, but she settled herself back against him and wrapped her arms around him and snuggled closer.
“You look so much like Lily. Honestly, I think this suits you better than when you were an exact replica of James. You’re beautiful, fawn. I’m glad you’re alright, now.” Sirius whispered in her ear, and Harry smiled as Sirius pulled her back to get a better look at her.
“Yes, I did say our children, Harry. It means exactly that. Now, stop fussing and kiss me already.” Draco whispered and then kissed the nook right below Harry’s ear. Harry pulled away and climbed off the bed. He grabbed Draco’s wrist and started pulling him to the door. “Where are we going?” Draco asked.
“Wuv you, Hai.” The little boy tried, and Harry just smiled and kissed the top of the little boy’s head.
“That is sexy as hell, Harry.” Draco said as he yanked his fingers out and positioned his cock pushing it slowly into the prepped entrance. Harry arched his back and groaned as Draco pushed inside him all the way to the hilt, and he stopped. “You alright?” Draco asked.
“How long before he can go outside and not worry about being arrest for something he didn’t do?” Harry asked.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to upset your elf. But how was I supposed to know.”
Harry looked like he was thinking, and the he turned to Ron and Hermione. “The day Ron left, Hermione had an epiphany; what was she doing right before her epiphany?” Harry asked.
“I’m fine honestly, Narcissa. I figured out how to make almost anything interesting. I used to count the stairs in my cupboard….” Harry trailed off realizing what she said, and Narcissa’s eyes widened.
“Thank you, Remy.” Harkin stated, and she pulled away and pulled them over to the dining table. Harkin sat down next to Draco as Remus and Sirius sat down across from them.
Harry’s yes fluttered one and they landed on Draco. “Draco, what’s going on?”
“Yes. We couldn’t do anything for her except make her comfortable, and then Draco created a miracle.” Narcissa stated as she stared proudly at her son.
In their fourth year, they had the Tri-Wizard Tournament, the year that Harry realized his feelings for Draco, but not that he felt the same way. The Tri-Wizard Tournament was the hardest thing that Harry had ever been through: the dragon, the Yule Ball, trying to safe Draco from the Black Lake, the maze, Voldemort rising, him killing Cedric Diggory, and then the fact that Barty Crouch Jr. tried to kill him after he got back from the maze that he just survived, and then having to deal with Draco after wards. Draco has chewed him out at the end of every year for something or other, most of the time it is because he put himself in danger and didn’t need to.
Hermione came back a few minutes later with a Healer, and he started casting spells over Harry. “Alright Mr. Potter, I’m going to ask you some question and try to answer them to the best of your ability.” He started asking Harry questions and he tried to answer them but he didn’t remember much of what happened. Andromeda came in shortly after the healer had finished his questions, and Teddy was bouncing in her arms.
She smiled as she slowly opened the box so Remus couldn’t see, and she gasped. It was a very nice silver band with a ruby stone inlayed in the band. Harkin smiled as she closed the box and pulled Sirius back in for a hug. “He’s going to love it.” She whispered in his ear and pulled away. “This one is mine.” Harkin said as she wiggled the fingers of her left hand in front of Sirius, and he smiled as he took her hand to look at the ring.
“Whoa, how did you do that?”
“Are you only acting this way around me because I’m now a woman? You’ve always acted like you despised me.” Harry moaned, and Malfoy traveled a little higher, catching the edge of Harry’s jaw. Harry threw her head back and moaned. “Merlin, what is everyone going to think, Malfoy?”
“How do you know I actually did it?” Draco asked as he stepped away from Severus.
“Mum,” Draco whispered.
“Yes, I will be right back.” Madam Pomfrey walked out of the room, and Hermione looked back at Harry who looked like he was trying to remember something that he was missing.
Harkin tries not to worry about Sirius while trying to handle her new life as the new Mistress Malfoy.
“She is actually a very fast learner.” Narcissa stated.
“Let’s get out of here quickly then.” Lucius grabbed her hand and pulled her from the room and down the hall when she saw someone standing at the end of the hall and realized it was Arthur.
“It’s alright, cub. Let’s have some tea.” Remus said as he pulled Harkin over to the table, and he moved her into a seat. Harkin sat down, and Remus kissed her on the top of her head before he walked over to make some tea. When he finished making their tea, he walked back over to Harkin and he placed the cup of tea in front of her before he sat down next to her, and he turned slightly towards her. “So do you want to talk about what brought you here?” Remus asked as he brushed his fingers through her hair, and he tucked it behind her ear.
“When you just walked away, part of me was missing.” He whispered. “You walked out, and took part of me with you when you did, and now that your back I feel whole again.” Draco whispered.
“What?” Severus asked.
“How is it that you know of the task that Professor Dumbledore gave us, Snape?” Ron charged forwards, pulling his wand out and pointing it at Snape.
“No, sir. We weren’t supposed to be flying, but I was just showing Harry what was so great about flying since he didn’t grow up with it the way that I did. I’m sorry, Professor; I didn’t mean to get Harry in trouble, sir.”
“Because you’re blushing an awful lot.”
“I never thought you did, my dear. I just want you to know that I support you no matter what the results of your exam are this afternoon.” Narcissa said, and Harry rested her head on Narcissa’s shoulder.
“Yes, because you only want me alive now, because I have a piece of your soul latched onto mine. You only care because if I die you are just closer to your own death, and you fear death. I’ll tell you this, just because I prefer not to die, does not mean that I fear it. I will gladly die if it means that I save the ones that I love. Just remember that in you endeavors, and trying to keep me in line. I do expect to go back to school as well. I do need to learn, and you aren’t going to stop me from doing that. I will think on my own and you are going to let me, because I don’t follow the rules, I don’t like them much.” Harry turned on her heels and walked out of the room, but was pulled back into the room, and the door slammed in front of her. She turned and stared at Voldemort.
The next morning when they woke up, they went down to the great hall with the rest of the Gryffindors. When McGonagall saw them she almost practically ran towards them. “Miss Granger, Mr. Weasley. How are you? Welcome back to Hogwarts.”
“Meaning house elves are restocking it for us.” Harkin stated with slight distaste.
“Thank you, mum.” Draco whispered as he pulled her into a hug.
“Harry, do you really want to do this here and now?” Draco ran his fingers across Harry’s forehead brushing some of his hair out of his eyes. Draco leaned down and trailed kisses down Harry’s jaw and neck. Harry let out soft whimpers as Draco laid the kisses across his skin.
“Really, I will keep that in mind. I wish I would have known that years ago. What do you react better with, outburst or calm and collected?” Draco asked.
“Cutting your hair.” They said together.
“Nothing.” Sirius said having a hard time keeping the smile off his face. “Just laughing at how much my fawn is like her father.” Sirius smiled, and Remus gave Sirius a knowing look.
“Harry, what’s the matter?”
“Since it is the Dark that possesses his mind, Harry will be trapped in a small recess of his mind trapped with his worst fears. I hope Mr. Potter isn’t afraid of much and can fight them off efficiently because it may be possible for him to fight his way out.”
“Are you two coming?” Draco stood and placed Harry on the floor, and they walked over to the fireplace. They all stepped into the green flames and appeared in the lobby at St. Mungos. Narcissa walked up to the front desk and asked about Mr. Weasley. She came back over to them, and they followed her up to the first floor and found his room. Harry peeked in the room to see Mrs. Weasley, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny sitting around his bed, and Harry was about to back out when Hermione saw her and jumped out of her chair.
“No, haven’t seen her yet. Snape did.”
“Already brought up with the headmaster and both of their heads of house. They have access to each other’s common rooms and they have their own rooms. Though Harkin had one from before with her gender change.” Lucius explained.
“Don’t lie to me, Lucius. I know how you plan things, and this has your signature all over it, Lucius.”
“Yes, that would be best. That way Sunday can be dedicated to homework.” Draco said as he wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, his fingers sprawled across her still flat stomach, and Harry leaned into his shoulder.
