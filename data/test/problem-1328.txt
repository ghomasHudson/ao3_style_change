The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, was wearing a hideous pink cardigan. Draco noticed with relief that Hagrid had been replaced by Prof. Grubby-Plank on the head table. He tried to catch Prof. Snape's eye without success, he wondered what he must have thought about his sudden marriage to Potter. Surely, he would know by now, he had been a frequent visitor to Grimmauld Place. Draco felt slightly hurt at the prospect, that Snape hadn't thought of checking up on him once.
Mrs. Weasley had tasked him to clear out mould from the master bedroom, he had been tempted to shout in her face for suggesting it, but decided against angering his only potential ally. The Weasley twins, whose names he had learnt as Fred and George, were working beside him.
"Even if you were to get Dumbledore to agree, force a protesting Draco down the aisle, do you think, that Potter of all people, would agree to this scheme of yours?"
Her eyes glistened with unshed tears, her hands tightened on his shoulder. Draco blinked up at her, his eyebrows knitted in a frown.
"Cissy, your sense of humour has improved since the last time I saw you. Marry Harry to - ha - your boy - "
"See, that's your problem, you all think that you're always right, anyone who deviates from your perceived sense of right and wrong, has to be rectified. I refuse to allow you to bully me - "
They were met by wands thrust at their throats and distrustful glares. Draco could hear an alarm going off, the wards had been triggered. Narcissa calmly took a step into the lion's den, tugging Draco by his arm.
Potter stuck his hand out in front of Draco's face. Draco was taken back to the time when he had waited patiently for Potter to take his hand, only to be insulted and have it thrown back into his face. There was no reason for them to be friends now.
************************************************************************************************************************
"Don't be so harsh, my dear. I've come to ask you for a small favour, nothing out of your reach. I am asking for your godson's hand in marriage for my son -"
Narcissa Malfoy seldom expressed any emotion beyond a mild apathy towards life. The only exception being her fifteen-year-old son who was currently sulking in his bedroom. His father had been unpleasant, to say the least, about his less than stellar grades and his constant obsession with upstaging Harry Potter. Particularly, now that the Dark Lord had made a reappearance.
The sorting hat's song made little sense to Draco, it always blathered on about unification, since his first year. He clapped with his housemates, every time someone got sorted into Slytherin. Later, the toad-like Defense teacher interrupted Dumbledore's welcome speech. Draco realized where he had seen her before, she worked in the Ministry, he had seen her on his countless visits to his father's office.
Lucius' ears were ringing, that could be the only explanation. His mouth was agape as he listened to his wife's words.
"We must not be tardy, Draco. Now remember, the Floo connection will only hold for five minutes. Lucius, go ahead."
Potter was fidgeting in his sleep, his hands kept tracing empty patterns in the air. Draco was woken up by Potter's hand nearly taking out his eye. He rested his head on one hand and turned his face towards Potter. Potter's brows were knitted together, his legs were tangled in the bed sheet, and he kept murmuring
Draco couldn't be bothered to hear about how he would get to Hogwarts when his parents were hosting the Dark Lord. What if he found about the marriage, would he let them escape unscathed?
Draco tried to calm himself down. His hand knocked against the ring he wore around his neck. Potter and Draco had hidden their rings, Potter still wore his, on his finger, hidden under a glamour charm.
An hour later, Draco could not bear Parkinson's company. She was still as dumb as rocks, which helped him circle around several sensitive topics. He wondered how she had been prefect. They joined the rest of their friends in a compartment at the end of the train. He was happy to be reunited with Crabbe and Goyle, he had been missing the security they brought with them.
*************************************************************************************************************************************
After showing the first years the sleeping quarters, Draco accompanied Pansy till she reached the stairs leading to her dorms. He was about to climb the stairs to his own dorm when, he was approached by Snape.
Draco had no idea who Pettigrew was, but from Potter's explanation, he could piece together what had happened. He stood next to Potter awkwardly, he didn't know how to comfort someone. He wondered whether getting Granger would be a good idea, she would know what to do.
Draco doubted the sincerity of his words due to the noticeable lack of his mother at his bedside. Lucius seemed to follow his thoughts.
He slowly inched his way to the door, there was really no point in him being there for this conversation.
His parents seemed wary of his quick acceptance, but offered gracious smiles. Draco thought, as his mother hugged him to her chest,
Draco began to feel dizzy, his mother's voice, Potter's angry rejoinders all seemed distant. He lifted a hand up towards his mother in help, before losing consciousness.
"You know, I have been doing some reading on marriage contracts, Mrs. Malfoy. Legally, if I ask Malfoy to stay with me, you cannot contest - "
"And what were to happen if the reckless idiot risked her life? It would mean certain death for Draco."
He is aware of Potter standing up beside him, still clutching his head, and reaching down a hand towards Draco. Draco grabs it automatically and is pulled, unsteadily, to his feet.
“Draco,” he said, and watched the boy turn deeply shadowed eyes to meet his. “My poor boy. I am so sorry.”
A tear forms in the corner of Harry’s eye, falling before Draco can stop it. He traces the path with gentle flicks of his tongue, nibbles Harry’s earlobe, and then follows the tear to the spot just below his jaw. He traces the underside of his jaw and Harry arches up slightly.
He can feel Harry, hard against his own hardness, and rubs gently against him. He feels, rather than hears, Harry’s breath hitch. Harry doesn’t move, trying to gauge the proper response to
“God, I wish we had more time,” Lance says, releasing him. “But give me your numbers and I’ll hit you up next time my partner’s out of town.”
me. You held me and you healed me and you let me sleep in your arms.” He’d clung to that moment for three full days… he would have clung to it forever if Harry hadn’t returned and brought him home. “I do
don’t make any sense. And he’s standing beside what he is fairly certain is Potter’s bed. At least, now, it is made.
Severus shouldn’t have said it. And he honestly hadn’t thought Draco could go any paler; every last drop of color slipped from his face.
Perhaps he will try to get a job in a book shop when this is all over—he feels that he has read at least
The last bit is unfortunately true. What is also true is that when Blaise… kind, gentle Blaise… reached out to touch him, he flinched away, his breath coming short. Draco can’t let Blaise—or anyone—touch him now.
“Of course not. I don’t hate Muggles, Potter. And if I ever did… I was wrong. But…it just seems like it would be hard to be with a Muggle… always having to hide who you are.”
“Yeah… because…” and Draco hates that he is blushing… “Because I really think I’d like to get the insides of my pajamas—and yours—all sticky again at least once more tonight.”
With a swish of Harry’s wand, Draco conjures the papers and stacks them as neatly as possible on the desk. Beside his own books. They sit there, together, crumpled papers and immaculate textbooks… a perfect sort of balance. Or things that have no business sharing the same space.
Harry does… and he doesn’t. His mouth descends slowly this time, but with no less intensity, his eyes blazing green. It starts slowly, a brush of the lips, then a taste and a nibble, while Harry’s hand… his fingers… make gentle love to Draco’s own hand, while Harry’s other hand caresses Draco’s cheek, until Draco can no longer tell where his body stops and Harry’s begins.
He suspects the clothes are a not-so-subtle hint that he should actually go out of the house… further than the garden.
Kingsley was always beside him… one more introduction… one more hand, one more smile… He fled to Romania the following morning.
, at least, should be spending his weekends studying… but how can he when Harry just looks so damn happy tinkering away at that bike?
A chime rings in the distance and Harry Potter looks over his shoulder, his hand falling away. “Here,” he says, and something drops into Draco’s palm. “I have to go… I’m only allowed five minutes. I’ll see you tomorrow, okay?”
Draco’s wondering, too. Over the years he’s learned to work magic with his mouth… but to kiss like a lover? If he ever knew, he’s long forgotten how.
I try to ignore the fact that my house is a mess. I’ve turned the formal dining room into a studio—I like the natural light from the large front windows, and it’s convenient to the kiln I installed in the basement. And I really only want to eat in the kitchen… and be reminded of the meals I shared there with Sirius… and Remus, Tonks, Mad-Eye. Everyone, really. It was like we were one big family.
“Ah, yes, Mr. Potter. Mrs. Weasley telephoned earlier,” he says with perfect Received Pronunciation. “Please, sit down.”
He is fucked in the most luxurious hotels by the highest-ranking members of the Ministry… the most illustrious of businessmen… the most impressive dignitaries. Once, even by a foreign prince.
“Of course, there’s nothing to be done about it now,” Healer Mitchell says, fixing Draco with such a fierce glare that he actually
Draco finds that he can no longer stand. He drops to the floor, heedless of the slippery dampness coating his pajama pants. Heedless of the cold and the hard floor. Heedless of everything, really, because he
Every day people fuck him, use him, hurt him if they want… and Draco lets them because it is his job. Because he has no choice. But just for today, Draco is going to cherish every touch, every moment… because this is
of gay wizards. Or witches,” he adds, fairly, “but it’s been almost fourteen hundred years since being gay was considered… you know, not on. And even
Charlie doesn’t release him, but he blinks… and one tear falls, trickling into his beard, as all the tension drains from his hands. He takes a breath that is at least part sob, but Harry can’t tell how much is relief and how much is regret. Charlie’s next kiss is gentle. Barely more than the brushing of lips.
He isn’t being poorly treated. He could be… there isn’t anyone who would care. But he is in one of the holding cells on the ground floor, not in the bowels of the prison, surrounded by the damp and dark, nor yet in the towers with dementors endlessly moving past him in their slow, menacing circles.
“It’s fine,” Draco says, nearly certain that it is. He is prefers to stay within the confines of his own little sphere—basically the coffee shop, the market, and the occasional walk to the park with Harry. But a bookshop… his eagerness to see that wonder easily overcomes the lingering misgivings he sometimes has about going somewhere new. “A
He rises up on his elbow and looks down at Harry. He threads his fingers through his hair, brushes his cheek almost reverently, and kisses him deeply. Draco tries let the kiss say everything he can’t…
The boy was, indeed, looking up at him… not with lust, but with absolute trust, and Severus gratefully allowed the world to right itself.
Was it when the princess’s planet was destroyed? Or when the fictitious dark lord murders the bearded mentor? Surely it was before the space battle that has Draco gasping and squeezing Potter’s hand for reassurance… even though he
Draco begins shivering in earnest, though he is not sure why; he isn’t really cold anymore. His teeth begin to chatter, though, and Harry holds him tightly, placing a long kiss on his temple.
“I have already spoken with the Dark Lord. I asked that you might return to Hogwarts with me immediately… Draco, forgive me, but the Dark Lord seems to believe I would be putting you to the same sort of use Macnair has been….”
Potter doesn’t say anything else, he just goes back to the stove. Draco sips his tea, feeling fractionally better with each sip, and watches Potter cook. His movements are practiced and efficient, and within minutes he is returning with small plates piled high with scrambled eggs, the sausages, and a few fried tomatoes.
Harry’s run out of words… and out of air to say them with. Sobs wrack his body. Draco just holds on… petting him as his body quiets.
is, but it had better not be one of those new-fangled terms used to insult or intimidate people these days.”
His fingers graze his other arm. “Nagini bit me here… and…” He touches the center of his chest with both hands, half framing, half concealing the shiny oval at the center of his chest. “The Horcrux… Slytherin’s locket… it… Hermione had to cut it off me.”
The mental image Draco has of himself is his head tilted suggestively, one eyebrow raised elegantly, peering at Potter through lowered eyelashes. But he knows damn well that both eyebrows have just shot up in surprise; he’ll be lucky if his mouth isn’t hanging open.
“He. Knows. I. Left.” Draco said, rather unnecessarily, struggling to breathe, struggling to not scream.
"Potter, why are you telling me all of this? If you were hoping for sympathy, you should have approached your
Draco hurried to keep up with her as she took long strides towards her private quarters. A short man, a shop assistant from Madam Malkins, waited nervously for Draco to stand in front of the mirror, before he could take his measurements. Narcissa waited for the man to finish, before she spoke.
Draco kept a poker face for the rest of dinner, he sometimes rued being in Slytherin, where his housemates were so perceptive. He watched with mild disgust as Goyle and Crabbe pigged out, he supposed he should be used to it by now.
There was another batch of silence. Students had started to trickle out of the Great Hall. Draco panicked, and tried to leave, Potter grasped his wrist.
"Draco, darling. Don't you want your family to be safe? The marriage won't mean anything, you will be staying with us and Potter can go gallivanting on his self righteous missions.
Draco decided to take his lunch in the courtyard. Off late, he found it cumbersome to put up a front in front of the Slytherins, he had never been a great liar. He kicked around a pebble while he ate. Potter slumped in the seat next to him. Draco looked around nervously, it wouldn't do to be sitting with Potter.
Draco had been quiet ever since his mother left, this seemed to rattle Potter who seemed obsessed with finding out what Draco was up to. The last day of the vacation was just around the corner. On one such a day, they got their letters from Hogwarts.
Granger had come to investigate on the state of Potter's packing. Her cat was purring loudly in her arms. Her nose twitched. She asked worriedly.
"It's not like I'm dying to marry you, Potter. Besides, Mother has assured me that we will continue to live on as before, this means nothing -"
Draco felt grumpy suddenly, he started trudging back towards the castle. Potter jogged to keep up with him.
Draco was avoiding Black like the plague. He was afraid of being cornered like before. Mrs. Weasley had perhaps, not fully accepted his excuses on behalf of the twins. She usually paired him with Potter in the cleaning activities. Potter had not tried to be speak to him since his offer of a truce had been denied, which suited Draco just fine.
Draco felt a surge of satisfaction at his annoyance, he had always liked his great aunt. He was left alone, while Black went to attend to the visitor, no doubt an important missive from the Order. Draco had just decided to snoop around a bit, when his plans were foiled by the appearance of the bushy-haired Hermione Granger.
"Lucius, I need you to call in a favour with the man in the Ministry Archives. Ask him who gained ownership of Grimmauld Place."
Draco remembered the nights he had woken up in cold sweats, only half remembering the nightmare. Of course, his mother had been there then, easing him back to sleep. He felt a bitter taste in his mouth when he thought about her.
Draco replied sarcastically, his eyes narrowed in a clear sign of defiance. Black chuckled good-naturedly.
Potter seemed disturbed by the single utterance, Draco leaned forward, was there trouble in paradise between the headmaster and his golden boy?
As Draco followed Mrs. Weasley out of the room, George Weasley offered him a friendly pat on the back.
"There's more to this world than what your parents have allowed you to see. Open your eyes Draco, you will see it all around you."
Draco waited for his parents to leave before sneaking his broom out. His father had been unerringly harsh on him this summer, Draco needed a respite from it all. He lost track of time as he zoomed passed the Wiltshire countryside. His mother was waiting for him when he disembarked. He prepared himself for a dressing down.
"Mother, how could you ask me that? I'm just fifteen, and you're asking me to marry a boy who despises me more than you could imagine. He'll make me miserable - "
**************************************************************************************************************************************
Draco debated with himself whether he should reveal what he had overheard. He decided to keep the information to himself for now, and use it to his advantage later, should the opportunity arise. Potter looked fully awake now, his glasses shining under the moonlight. Draco realized he was taking too long to respond.
**********************************************************************************************************************
"Potter, if I were you, I would worry less about me and more about your wand being snapped in two - "
"Draco, we are in the process of managing our affairs. The next time you hear from us, it may well be from fairer seas. Dear, you can't speak of this to a single soul, do you understand?"
Draco couldn't be bothered to reply, his heart was pounding at the prospect at being seated for breakfast across a group of highly trained Order members. Potter seemed to perceive his discomfort.
************************************************************************************************************************
Weasley's hair was glued in clumps, with what Draco could only conclude was, doxy dung. He smirked as his eyes were trained on the Potions book in front of him.
Draco corrected him promptly. He didn't know why Potter's insistence on being friends drove him up the wall. Potter fell silent. Draco sighed in relief when he heard him leaving.
. Blood was flowing freely from the cut. Draco gasped in horror. He gingerly took Potter's hand into his own.
Draco checked that he wasn't being followed, he was carrying a rucksack with few clothes and his wand. He tiptoed down the stairs, this was the only opportunity he would have to escape from this marriage farce. The portraits snored as he shuffled past them. He had made it past the wards into the garden.
“I’m not asking for your permission! It’s inside of me, not you! And I don’t want it there!” Harry’s words trip over themselves.
save you… and I try to go back to sleep. And when I do you’re there in the fire, in the heat of the fire, your hand slipping through mine, and I can’t
“I will not be kept like some sort of a pet, Harry,” Draco says gently, more to soothe the dog than to soothe Harry, whom he would really prefer to shout at. Or possibly hit.
... so much... And it was so dark. I couldn’t see… I don’t know if they’re dead… or in Azkaban… I want them to be… but I don’t know. I couldn’t see! I don’t know
moan, I decided, a deep throaty sound, rising a little into a gasp when I kissed his pulse point with a tiny touch of teeth.
to timing one’s arrival to these things—and Draco is very, very good at it. What is the purpose of the event? What is
The next thing he knows he’s burst through Malfoy’s door. It bounces against the wall… and Malfoy, who had been curled up on the bed reading, looks up, startled and wary.
The kettle boils and Potter brings it over to fill the teapot. “I’m sorry, I don’t have any coffee, only tea.”
Draco’s hand is coated in precome, like silk on his palm. He slides his thumb over the head and is rewarded with an almost desperate, “
Suddenly there was emptiness behind him, and Draco could hear the Death Eater straightening his robes.
“I’ve seen your mother,” he says. “She saved my life in the forest… did you know that? Anyway, I gave evidence and she was pardoned. Completely. She didn’t want to go back to the Manor, though, so she’s in a little cottage out in Cornwall. Right by the sea. She sends her love.”
Please note: Harry is going to talk a little more about his "hook-up" with Muggle in this chapter. I don't think this chapter deserves a "dubious consent" tag... but you might want to proceed with caution if you find conversations about consent and what constitutes consent triggering.
Harry’s scar was hurting enough to roil his stomach, and the nausea that witnessing this scene caused… that was all his.
“This means something, doesn’t it?” Harry asks, not entirely sure he wants an answer… not entirely sure he knows what he wants the answer to be. “I feel… naked.”
When he stops the notes hang, briefly, in the air, before slowly dissolving into the silence. Draco turns towards Harry then, his eyes liquid grey. He closes the piano.
Draco watched his face go from greyish to green. “No!” he found himself shouting, “I can’t eat that!
. He talks about hemorrhage… drained magical cores… premature labor… deformities… and delivery complications.
He was aware of the cold and the dark, then a certain weightlessness… and the stone of the dungeon floor slamming into him.
We do a cursory clean-up of the kitchen first, then take the drawings upstairs—Draco’s suggestion—to look through after Victoire has brushed her teeth and changed into her pajamas.
Draco feels that his coquettish eyelash-flutter is rather lacking, but Potter steps aside to let him in anyway… his face going even redder.
Harry’s tongue brushes against Draco’s lower lip before the kisses slide away, down his jaw, to the spot on his neck that he loves so much. Draco throws his head back, giving Harry better access, and moans.
“How the hell do you know that?” Draco snaps. He feels… loose… as though parts of him might fly away at any moment. Keeping track of all those parts—keeping them contained—is taking almost more energy than he has. He does it anyway.
A moment later he feels the brush of her whiskers as she snatches the treat from his hand, before retreating back against the wall.
Harry pulls up the leg of his jeans to reveal four marks, one almost star shaped, one a small line, the others just dots, on his calf. “My aunt’s… my uncle’s sister’s dog,” he finds himself saying. “Ripper… she thought it was fun to let him chase me. I… I didn’t always run fast enough.” He pulls the material higher, revealing a jagged scar and a badly skinned knee. Tiny stones, black shadows, linger beneath the poorly healed skin. “I fell off my bike. It was old… garbage, really; someone was throwing it away. I’d mended it, but it wobbled a lot. I actually don’t know if it just fell apart or if my cousin knocked me off it.”
“If they find me, they’ll kill me,” Draco whispered. “Snape sent me to you to keep me safe. Please… let me stay.”
Harry’s hand is still safe between Malfoy’s. Malfoy’s head bends a little, his lips brushing Harry’s knuckles.
he is going… and he lands with a thump on a floor that is at least as filthy as the pavement he just left.
Draco stretches Harry carefully, tenderly… as Harry whimpers with need. With a finger brushed against his lips, Draco silences him; he is not rushing this. Harry is tight, like it really
Draco takes another deep breath. “I’m booked for three hours… so as long as I don’t leave here before then, more or less, it’s fine. We don’t have to… fuck.”
Draco was barely sixteen when he was forced into the Dark Lord’s service, and it was the twin mercies of his age and the self-righteous benevolence of Harry
The waistband of Harry’s pajamas is cutting into his wrist and his heart is doing something funny, its rhythm uneven, caught between excitement and terror.
Draco’s mouth catches Harry’s and he nips lightly at Harry’s lower lip until Harry opens his mouth to him. Sneaky fingers slide up under the shirt, his hands ghosting Harry’s ribs and chest, barely touching. He gently thumbs a nipple. “Oh yes. Take it off. The pants too.”
Gryffindorish thing to do… to go messing about in the dark places of Harry’s soul… trying to mend it.
Draco’s throat tightens, but he cannot tell if it’s Elladora’s silencing curse working on him, or if it simply the natural response to unshed tears and unsaid words.
“No one’s arguing with you,” Weasley says. “But no one’s blaming you, either. And… well… I have to say, that
People who were in mourning channeled their grief into rage… and people who were hurting began to seek revenge.
He felt, somehow, that he should be keeping track of the periods of lightness and darkness, or at least the bowls of food… but it seemed daunting. And what was the point? There was no sentence. He was in this cell until someone let him out or he died of the hunger which was now constantly clawing at his stomach.
, as much as looking for the proper book. “This one,” he says at last, holding out a thick book with a picture of Stonehenge on the cover and the words
.” He threads his fingers through Harry’s. “It’s not… that… although it doesn’t help. But vast quantities of beer and loud jokes… That’s not how we…” Draco’s voice falls away.
Victoire as an infant. I wonder if kissing is something an uncle who is not an uncle should even do.
The eyes are glittering now, with unshed tears. Harry blinks and two solitary tears trace his cheeks. “If I kiss you, will I hurt you?”
“They were engaged when…he decided he didn’t want to be a Death Eater anymore. And then the Dark Lord killed him. No one survives for long after they leave the Dark Lord’s service.” Draco felt his voice hitch. “It’s probably only a matter of days, really, before he finds me and kills me….”
Harry clamps a hand over his mouth, determined not to sick-up in the waiting room of St. Mungo’s. The subtle, yet cooling, scent of mint washes over him… masking the cologne… settling his stomach.
. He enjoys the first one, but he feels that parts of the second book hit too close to home; he does not read the third.
When Draco opens his eyes, Harry is looking up at him… his mouth wet and red and in a shape that could be a smile. Or a look of pure awe. “I love you,” Harry says.
“Good morning, darling,” his mother says, as he enters the dining room. He leans in to kiss her cheek. “Did you sleep well?”
The soap is gritty, smells strongly of oranges, and almost magically scrubs away most of the grease. When Harry casts a second cleaning charm over both their hands, Draco can find only the barest traces of black remaining, outlining the swirls of his fingerprints and the lines on his palms. He thinks he likes it. It makes him feel that he has done something
Harry moves down Draco’s chest, kissing and licking and sucking. “Maybe not even here,” Harry says around teeth clamped gently on Draco’s nipple.
“Right.” Harry tries to hide the knife-slash across his heart by turning away from Lance and sliding out of the bed. Luckily his trousers are on the floor by his feet. He pulls them on.
Popular opinion said they deserved it. Popular opinion may have even been right. Draco threads his free hand into Harry’s hair and lets him rest there.
The door is flung open by a barefoot man wearing ratty jeans and a dark green t-shirt with “Holyhead Harpies” splashed across it in bright, gold letters. Round, wire-rimmed glasses…
“Hmph,” the woman says. “You had better not. When the Good Lord chooses to use one of his more unusual molds for a person, why that only makes that person even more special.” She pats Harry’s hand again. “Maybe just needing a little bit of extra care sometimes.”
Draco knows that Potter’s funds are, essentially, limitless, but he’s not surprised to find him not living in some version of Malfoy Manor. He remembers Potter after the War, the last time he saw him… the haunted look that had settled deep in his eyes, and Draco thinks that he wouldn’t have been completely shocked to find him living in a tent in a deserted wood somewhere.
Potter twisted his arm painfully, Draco scratched at his hand with his free hand. Mrs. Weasley looked horrified at the events playing out in front of her.
**********************************************************************************************************************************
********************************************************************************************************************************
"Draco, your mother has laid out the situation before me. I wish to know your opinion before I answer."
Potter was describing the trial in detail, Draco thought that a case of underage magic hardly warranted a full trial with the Wizengamot. He hoped nobody noticed he was listening in.
"We must invoke the old marriage laws, get Draco married to a respectable member of Dumbledore's plethora of do-gooders – "
Draco wriggled under Potter, he was quite heavy for someone who looked so skinny. Potter got up and went to his bed. Draco placed a comforting hand on his beating heart. He wriggled under the covers and waited for his breathing to slow down.
Draco didn't know where Potter learned to give compliments, because that barely sounded like one. He wasn't able to retort though, Potter's retreating form was too far away.
*********************************************************************************************************************************
********************************************************************************************************************************
As they dispersed, the Slytherins made their way towards the Defense classroom. He watched from the corner of his eye as Potter made his way towards the greenhouse. He was curious for his first lesson with Umbridge, he hadn't quite had her figured out yet. In a matter of a day, she had managed to make an enemy out of Potter, if not for anything else, Draco admired her for it.
Potter punched him, Draco kicked back at him. As they scuffled, rings of dust settled around them. Draco felt blood fall from his nose - he tripped Potter.
************************************************************************************************************************
"Pettigrew. He betrayed my parents, you know - he's the reason Voldemort knew where to find them, that night - "
Draco's hand clutched at the silver-green prefect's badge, his father would have been so proud. He sighed heavily. Weasley had been made prefect over Potter, Draco could read the disappointment all over Potter's face as he tried to be happy for his mate.
Draco sat in his old nursery, the light summer breeze playing with his pale strands of hair. The constant manipulation and power struggles in his household made him frustrated. His parents had sorely misunderstood the abject hatred Draco and Harry had for each other. In the past four years, he had annihilated any potential friendship they could have. To his credit, Potter, gave as good as he got.
Draco yawned loudly, he didn't feel sufficiently prepared for the first day of class. He felt paranoid, as though his friends would discover his secret any moment. The ability to use his magic comforted him slightly. He passed a poster put up by the Weasley twins seeking guinea pigs for their experiments, Draco shuddered as he remembered the nasty trick they had played on him.
Draco found himself back in the tapestry room. His fringe covered his eyes partially, as his fingers traced his parents names.
Draco tried to make sense of his father muttering, he seemed to have forgotten Draco. He cleared his throat suddenly.
Draco felt rage at her pity, at her trying to include him in their mundane household chores. He walked away, leaving her spluttering, only to crash into Kreacher. Draco watched in disgust, as he took in the filthy rag tied around his body in the form of a loincloth.
Granger looked disappointed, her dreams of inter house unity, were a long way from being fulfilled. Weasley seemed more at ease, now that Potter and Draco were sniping at each other. Potter cleared his throat.
Harry took his hand and squeezed it tightly, “Are you okay?” he looked at his own large pile guiltily.
If anyone is wondering (and because I love bikes so much myself) Harry's bike, Bess, is a Triumph Thunderbird, in black :)
They arrived at the club while it was still clad in darkness. The building, while not so grand, maintained a sophisticated air. Knockturn Alley didn’t have the negative stigma any longer, the Aurors had cleaned it up quite well after the war and now it was home to wizarding nightlife. Bars, clubs, and various restaurants filled up the narrow street, enchanted lights and windows glowed with warm, inviting interiors. The Knockin’ Kneazle stood at the end of the Alley, watching over it all every single night. The whole alley would come alive during the hours between 10pm and 7am, only to be lost in silence during the day.
Harry laughed scornfully, then took a deep breath, “She kissed me.” He glanced nervously at Draco – he was sure that Draco might let the mask slip for a second or two and show him how he really felt. He didn’t. The façade remained.
The only thing that Harry noticed about the room was the huge bed that almost filled it. Other than that, he was focused on one thing entirely.
“So how are you finding being back at Hogwarts?” Harry asked after some time, breaking Malfoys gaze from the window.
Harry smiled widely, the widest that Draco had ever seen him smile, and pulled him into a tight embrace. Draco gasped slightly at being pulled so close to a shirtless Harry, but held him just as tight as he was being held.
“I don’t know what you did, or what you said, but thank you.” he extended his hand and Draco shook it, almost giddy with happiness because the people that he had spent so long wanting to be like seemed now to accept him.
“Lay down,” Draco whispered, nuzzling into Harry's neck and kissing him oh-so-gently. Harry did as he was told.
“It was legal when I did it. There was a war on, a lot of people did things that they wouldn’t usually do.” He answered with a shrug.
Malfoy stood up, and ran a hand through his snowy hair, “I was wondering if you would like to go to Hogsmeade for a drink?” He spoke slowly. It felt to Harry like he was making a point to be an adult – extending an olive branch almost.
“I don’t know,” Draco smiled, “maybe two? I have to sort some things out with a student of mine.” He grabbed his heavy charmed snake cloak and headed towards the door. Harry followed, it was clear that Draco had to go.
He had two days until he saw Draco for Christmas. The entirety of Harry’s family would be coming over: all the Weasleys, Ron and Hermione, Neville and Hannah, and of course Draco. It was Harry’s favourite time of the year and he wanted to make sure that the house was perfect for everyone.
Draco rolled his eyes but didn’t say anything. Blaise looked between the two with a mischievous smile on his face, “Trouble in paradise, Dray?” his eyes glinted under the club lights.
When that was done and the bedroom was packed away, he took his parcel of books downstairs and slotted them into the bookshelf. He felt really satisfied to be out of a little room and into something that was homelier. He remembered what he had left in his trunk and ran back upstairs.
Draco wrapped his legs around Harry’s back, encapsulating him. They both had more purchase this way, more room to move, to try and break each other's resolve.
There was a whoosh of green flame as the Weasleys started to arrive through the floo network. Molly and George arrived first, their arms full of presents. Ron took the presents and bags from Molly and he and his brother went through to the living room. Molly scooped up Harry into a mothering hug and planted a kiss on his cheek. With a burst of green flame, Ginny and Arthur arrived, with more presents in their arms. They put their cargo onto the table and everyone greeted each other. Arthur shook Harry’s hand and Ginny pulled him in for a hug. Ron and George joked with Kreacher about something at the other end of the room and Molly and Hermione started talking about Christmas dinner. There was a knock at the front door and Kreacher lead Neville and Hannah into the kitchen. Hannah and Ginny embraced and chatted quietly at the table. Neville shook Harry’s hand enthusiastically and Harry took yet more presents into the living room. Ron showed Hannah and Neville into their room and bounded back down the stairs.
“Come here,” Harry groaned, he threw his head back and it hit the desk with a thud, still stroking himself, “Oh, god, come here.”
“You’ll be in Regulus’ old room – right at the top.” Harry said and Ron left, levitating the bag up to the top floor.
Seamus and Dean stayed with Harry for days, letting Hermione and Ron sort things out for Harry so that the media didn't get wind of what had happened - a media storm in the hospital wouldn't help the situation, and as they were listed as his next of kin, they could pretty much say whatever and it had to be done.
“It was built after the war, so that teachers could have better places than they used to,” Harry explained, looking up at the little houses, “but, what I’m trying to say, is welcome home.” He looked Draco cautiously in the eyes, trying to gauge his reaction.
He cleared his throat, and knocked on the door, the present tucked under his arm. There was no answer.
“I’m going to re-regret this in the, the erm… what’s the word?” He looked up at Draco, his eyes clouded and a stupid smile on his face.
That light fluttering feeling in his chest went south and Harry pulled his head away to look Malfoy dead in the face. There was Draco, eyes half-lidded, with that characteristic smirk and ruffled hair. He looked Harry up and down, his eyes lingering on his lips for just a moment too long to be meaningless.
When Draco felt Harry nod his head, he knew that he could start to move more. He began to thrust, slowly at first, to make sure that Harry was comfortable with it, then gradually faster. Harry seemed to lose all sense of control as Draco repeatedly hit his prostate.
Harry looked at the students, and was eager to not demonstrate the curses straight away for his sake and theirs. “Let’s talk briefly about the history of these curses - why are they unforgivable?” Harry asked the class. The students looked to each other nervously, a few whispers could be just heard, and then a tentative hand was raised by a Slytherin student at the back.
Draco nodded, and seeing as how his last class of the day was done, he would like to relax. He met Potter at the table, and they walked out together silently. The corridors were quiet, students were likely cosied up in the Great Hall waiting for dinner, or sat in front of fireplaces in common rooms. Draco hoped that his students were doing the reading for his next class. Potter seemed to enjoy walking in silence, and so Draco kept quiet, appreciating his company and his relaxed manner.
They worked hard on the living room. Hermione put the Christmas tree up, making it bigger until it fit the high ceilings properly. Harry and Ron stood staring at the tree wondrously – it was a beautiful, rich Norwegian spruce. They started placing decorations around it, taking care to not break some of the expensive glass baubles that Hermione brought. Hermione levitated an angel to the top of the tree and took a step back, precisely directing Harry and Ron in their decorating efforts.
The shower ran hot behind him, filling the room with steam. He stepped in and let the hot water run over his muscles. The relief was immeasurable and a sigh escaped his lips. With a vague gesture of his hand, he made the wizarding radio come to life and quiet music filled the steamy room. A gentle but throbbing guitar echoed throughout the tiled bathroom and took the edge off the tension that Harry felt in his shoulders.
Hermione was perched on the edge of her and Rons bed, one leg crossed over the other surveying Harry's choice of outfit with the kind of sincerity that he hadn’t got from Ron. As usual, he was wearing all black, but he’d recently learned the art of layering. And androgyny. He thought he’d rather cleverly paired his leather jacket with an
Draco dropped, ever so elegantly, to his knees, sliding off the sofa with a devilish smirk. It would be the death of him, Harry was sure. Those big grey eyes looked up at him, pale in comparison to the blush creeping over his slender face.
Harry groaned, grabbing at Dracos shirt to get it off him. He was far too clothed, too covered up for Harry's taste. He wanted Draco exposed, wretched, hopeless… eager. He wanted him in any position that would speed up the whole process. It was already becoming too much. They both clawed at each other's clothes in a frenzy, and once Draco was naked, Harry didn’t much care about himself still wearing his shirt.
The Grindylow café was the café that used to be Madam Puddifoots and it was a stark contrast to what it used to be. Where pink and floral patterns had once dominated, a homely and cosy replacement stood. No longer was it the popular spot for young lovers; studious looking people sat with old books and coffee, someone was scribbling passionately onto the longest role of parchment that Draco had ever seen, and there in the midst of it was a very smartly dressed Hermione.
“Don’t worry – he’s being paid a handsome bonus for his efforts.” Harry said, and Kreacher bowed in the corner. Harry motioned to Kreacher’s agreement, and Hermione sighed. She bit her lip and huffed something under her breath. Harry left Ron and Hermione to wrap their presents in the living room. He made his way to his bedroom and sighed. He wanted to make it look good for when Draco came over but he was habitually messy – unlike his boyfriend. He started by changing the bedding and straightening the curtains around the four-poster frame. He cleared the desk of clutter and gave it a wipe down, and did the same to the bedside table that would be on Draco’s side of the bed. He shoved everything into the bottom of the wardrobe and looked around: it would do.
“I was going to write a letter to Hermione, to see if I can influence the Ministry to introduce a scheme so that people like you – like us – could get it at potions shops for free with a card or a pass or something.” Draco explained.
Harry straightened out the blankets on his settee and moved one of his Gryffindor jumpers out of view. He wasn’t sure that he wanted Malfoy to see that he still had reminders of his school times hanging around.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “Only one of? Good lord Potty, I’m going to have to do better than that,” He spoke with a smile and a mock sense of outrage. Harry had learned all the nuances of Dracos tone, and even now it had the power to drive him mental.
The Three Broomsticks was fairly quiet, as Harry had suspected. That didn’t stop the patrons from turning to stare at Harry and Malfoy though. The stares lasted for mere seconds before people turned back to what they were doing. The Three Brooms hadn’t changed at all. The oak beamed aisled roof still gave the building a warm, welcoming atmosphere that always made Harry feel at home. Walking back here made Harry feel like he had never left; like he could walk over to what had been his regular table and see Ron and Hermione pouring over N.E.W.Ts revision or Hagrid drinking butterbeer with the professors. Alas, that was not the case. Neville and Hannah were behind the bar now, Neville had his hand around Hannah’s waist while she arranged the glasses on the side - the very picture of domesticity and happiness.
Draco noted with relief, that his parents were awkwardly exchanging goodbyes with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. He stood up, only to have his path blocked by Potter. He raised his eyebrows at Potter defiantly, what was he playing at.
Draco broke off abruptly, he was taking this truce with Potter too seriously. He sighed loudly before raising his hand in goodbye.
Narcissa pleaded with Draco. She threw a contemptuous look at Lucius, who had refused to participate in the talk from its advent.
*****************************************************************************************************************************
As he wandered in the corridor, Potter grabbed him by his hand and pushed him into an empty compartment.
Potter scratched his nose, he was wearing a baggy shirt, torn jeans and dirty sneakers, Draco wondered if he was dressed like that in protest, but immediately corrected himself when he remembered Potter's usual attire.
********************************************************************************************************************************
"Potter, the Ministry is trying to keep a close eye on Hogwarts this year, don't you see? Don't make their job easy. Control your temper -"
Draco looked at her eyes pleading with him, to trust her. Her hands were clasped  tightly on her silk robe. He had always considered his mother to be ageless, but in this moment, he felt that the past two months had aged her considerably. He nodded.
"You're so naive, Draco. Do you really think, he would protect us? He would lock us up with his Order. No, we need to hold the upper hand, by holding, what he values the most, the life of Harry Potter."
Her expression turned dark at his interruption. She continued, her wand idly making the tea cup swirl.
"Draco, don't be so crude, it's a simple mutually beneficial alliance. Dumbledore is an emotional fool, he won't hesitate to do whatever is necessary to protect Potter."
Draco could feel his cheeks heating up, he clamped his mouth in defiance. Potter waited for him to continue, he chuckled.
Draco stopped in his tracks, he sighed, it had been worth a try. Narcissa's pinched expression was enough to make him walk back resignedly towards the manor.
Draco realized right away that he had happened upon Potter's photo book. He watched as James and Lily Potter were trapped in an endless loop of twirling. He closed the book with a snap, it felt wrong to see such a personal part of Potter's life. He stuffed it back into Potter's trunk.
"Lucius, there's no place for sentiment in a marriage, it will be a marriage of convenience. Potter will get what he needs from Draco, and our family will be protected from the Dark Lord. Look how well it worked for us."
Fred Weasley shut up when he was on the receiving end of Mrs. Weasley's scowl. Potter seemed to be in a daze, his hands still clasping onto Draco's shoulders painfully. Draco made a pained sound and tried to wriggle out of his grasp, Potter finally removed his hands.
Draco shook his head to clear it of the haunting image of Diggory's lifeless eyes, seemingly piercing through his soul.  There was one thing he knew for certain, Potter was going to blow a gasket when he heard of his mother's inane plan. If only, for that reason, Draco, felt a rush of warmth.
Draco shot Potter a bewildered look, Granger and Weasley looked shocked as well. Mr. Weasley placed a hand on Potter's shoulder.
Not one for displays of affection, Narcissa enveloped Draco in her arms. He looked paler than usual and his tired eyes gave away more than he would have liked. She cleared her throat and gave Sirius a pointed look.
**********************************************************************************************************************************************
She left the end of her sentence open and turned back to her room. Potter tiptoed into the room, Weasley's snores echoed through the room. Draco watched nervously as Potter toed of his sneakers and settled into bed.
Draco knew he had been undeniably cruel to Granger in the past, and the past few days had little to change his opinion on blood purity and muggleborns. Black had forced him to think about it, but his father's teachings overrode any doubts he had been beginning to have.
"What was I saying dear, ah yes, I've managed to obtain a meeting with Sirius. Kreacher did always adore me as a child - "
Black's dark hair framed his face, the shadows giving him a sinister look. Draco had always been fascinated by the smudged name on his mother's family tree. He wondered if any of what his mother told him about Black was true.
Mrs. Weasley cleared her throat, she tapped her foot, awaiting an explanation. She must have heard him throwing up. After a minute, her face turned red.
"Tomorrow, after you exchange vows with Potter, you will be back home with us and Potter will carry on with his life. Nothing will change."
Draco wrenched his hands free from her grasp, despite his rotten attitude at Hogwarts, he had never disobeyed his parents, he didn't have to, he always got his way. He refused to meet her eyes, choosing to focus on his shoes instead.
His mother seemed hurt, he had never seen true anguish on her face before this. She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear before grasping Draco's hands.
"We don't know, and until we do, it's safer for you to be here. I won't be able to meet you again before you leave for Hogwarts, I've asked Molly Weasley to make the arrangements for you to be taken to King's Cross - "
It was hilarious to see Fred and George rendered speechless for once. Mrs. Weasley looked at him dubiously, before she gave him a motherly pat on the back.
Draco fell out of bed in his haste to open the door. Potter and Weasley stormed, covered in dirt and grime from their day spent cleaning out the rooms upstairs. Draco's mood lifted upon seeing their dark expressions.
Draco sat down gingerly on Potter's bed. The past few weeks had forced him to grow up suddenly, of all the terrible things that had happened, his parents hosting a madman, Draco could think of worse things than being Potter's acquaintance.
"Draco, I want you to be very careful. Promise me, that you will not try to aggravate your housemates and that you will exercise caution."
Seeing Weasley's face the first thing in the morning, could only be a bad omen, Draco thought childishly. Potter and Weasley were fully dressed, Granger was perched on Potter's bed reading a voluminous book. Draco felt embarrassed in his pajamas and quickly ducked into the shower.
Before Kreacher could reply, Draco heard the door open. Potter was looking at them with furrowed brows.
Draco cut himself off, Potter wasn't listening. Draco wanted to get back to his dorm, he turned around. Potter grasped his hand.
Narcissa was convinced that she had inherited her great grandmother's Seer abilities, usually Lucius humoured her, but he could remain silent no longer.
****************************************************************************************************************************************
"So, you are proposing that we marry off our sole heir to that half-blood Potter, so that he can leech off Draco's 'life force', in exchange for a safe harem from the Dark Lord?"
"As I was saying, we must decide about Draco. It's imperative that we have his best interests at the forefront. I think, it has become apparent that he doesn't possess the grit to be a Death Eater – "
"One last thing, Cissy. Is this worth sacrificing our son? Binding him to someone who could never understand his worth."
Draco sat down next to Potter and watched him from beneath his fringe. He felt awkward sitting in silence with Potter, without the usual push and pull of conversation to ease the situation. His fingers drummed out  a tune on the desk, his feet dangling in the air.
Draco wished he could get a moment of solitude in this godforsaken place. He turned around, meeting Black's unshaven face.
Draco watched as his father was engulfed in green flames. He waited for his mother to go through before taking a deep breath.
Potter was shaking his shoulder roughly. Draco looked outside, they had almost reached. The landscapes outside shrouded in darkness. He got up quickly, he couldn't believe he had fallen asleep without a care.
She bit her lip, as though hesitant to speak her mind. Draco was not going to make it easy on her, he made to leave. She tugged at his robe, he wrenched his hand away.
*************************************************************************************************************************
***********************************************************************************************************************************
Potter's head emerged followed by his body, from underneath his Invisibility Cloak. Draco pointed a finger at him triumphantly.
**************************************************************************************************************************
He twisted the ring on his finger, as his fingers traced the ingredients of a sleeping potion. His eyes began to feel heavy.
All the professors seemed to think lecturing them about the importance of their upcoming O.W.L.s was a just way of starting the year. Prof. Snape was unable to avoid the cliche either. Draco watched with amused silence as he took nasty jabs at Longbottom and Potter, and their potential inadequacy to clear a Potions O.W.L.
Draco could feel his eyelids getting heavy. He tried to speak, but his tongue felt heavy in his mouth. He fell asleep to the sound of Potter's agitated voice.
"Don't you see darling, with a single move, we will be safe from the Dark Lord. Draco will be safe –"
Potter's nightmares were a real pain, Draco thought that Weasley was a lucky bastard for being such a deep sleeper. Potter released huge, shaky breaths before clutching at his forehead.
************************************************************************************************************************
Black sighed, his hand raked through his dark locks. He had been a handsome man once, when his spirit had not been sucked out of being locked up in Azkaban.
For once in his life, Draco wished, the headmaster conveyed his thoughts without the easily avoidable theatrics. He resisted rolling his eyes at the headmaster.
Draco thought it was ridiculous that Potter was so frantic about the hearing, Dumbledore wasn't going to let him be expelled. He tried to imagine a Hogwarts without Potter, Draco smiled. With that pleasant thought in mind, he drifted back to sleep.
Draco snapped back. Their bickering came to an end when they reached the dining hall. Potter was leaving, and Draco felt a surge of panic.
***********************************************************************************************************************************
Draco opened his mouth to protest but before he could get a word in edgewise, his mother agreed on his behalf. He followed Potter into the kitchen.
Draco wished the ground would swallow him whole. Potter was staring at him, he could feel his eyes drilling a hole. An uncomfortable silence followed. Black's laugh echoed in the silence.
For the first time in five years, Draco set up locking charms on his curtains. He put up warding spells around his trunk. He knew how to protect himself, if not anything else. As he lay down on his bed, he pulled out the chain around his neck. His fingers traced the ring.
"You don't seem to comprehend the power of a marriage bond. It creates a magical bank, if you will. No harm could befall Draco's partner while he remains alive – "
Lucius chuckled inwardly with dark amusement. He hoped he would be able to witness Draco's tantrum as Narcissa cajoled him into agreeing with her.
Draco wiped his hands on his trousers before stretching out his palm. Black dropped a piece of parchment on his awaiting hand. It read -
He had friends, of course he did. He was immensely popular among his peers in Slytherin. But this was different. He had never had a friend, who hadn't been pre-approved and selected for him by his parents.
*******************************************************************************************************************************
Draco felt his ears burn, he felt humiliated by the fact that his mother carried his wand with her today. She had been afraid he would create a scene.
Potter had a contemplative look on his face, Draco was taken aback by his reaction. He wanted to bring back the conversation to familiar territory.
Grimmauld Place was an ugly building. It was protected by a Fidelius charm, Draco wondered how Narcissa had managed to circumvent the Secret Keeper. His heart began to beat loudly, he belatedly wondered if he was experiencing a stroke.
*******************************************************************************************************************************
The room was empty except for Potter's snowy owl, hooting in annoyance at its prolonged captivity. Draco looked around the room, something he hadn't had a chance to do in the dark yesterday, there was a single potrait on the wall, the man inside still deep in slumber. Draco scratched at his neck, the robes were uncomfortable.
Draco insincerely offered to clear up before making a hasty retreat. As he went upstairs, he noted Kreacher skulking outside their room. Of course, why hadn't he thought of the house-elf?
A chill ran down Draco's spine at her serene smile. Would his mother be successful in making this marriage happen, his mouth dried up. Draco felt out of breath as he tugged on his robes, he never dreaded meeting his childhood nemesis more.
"Ah that's where it gets tricky, we could ensure the flow of life force to be one-sided, there are provisions for that. Draco, will be safe and sound with us, ensuring the safety of his partner. That's what we will use as our bargaining chip."
Draco felt vindicated by ignoring him, tapping his fingers in a haphazard rhythm on the window ledge. Potter cleared his throat.
Draco stared resolutely ahead and ignored him. The twins were showing Weasley a magazine with dirty pictures, Draco craned his head to look.
"Alright, don't chew my head off. You will need Murtlap essence to fix that, Snape keeps some in his stores -"
"Mr. Potter, as you may recall, Draco is an underage wizard like you, his wand is of no use to him. Nevertheless, here it is - you may unhand him now."
Black and his mother were stuck in a staring match, Draco fidgeted in his seat. They were in a sitting room upstairs, the fraying upholstery was making him feel nauseous. A sharp knock interrupted them. Potter strode in without invitation, he looked agitated and Draco wanted nothing more to escape.
Draco was seated across from Black and Potter, silence shrouded the dining hall. Black placed a steaming cup of tea in his hands. Potter exchanged nervous glances with Black, before clearing his throat.
"Don't fret darling. Just wear your the robes I bought you last week, do you remember - yes those ones - "
Draco stumbled through the Floo, in a disgruntled heap. Dumbledore, the old loon, smiled at him benignly. Personally, Draco, had always thought he was a few cards short of a deck.
"I believe we have reached an impasse Headmaster. As kind as your offer may be, we couldn't accept it. Good day."
Draco shut his book promptly and turned his face towards Potter. Potter had no concept of personal space.
"Since, I'm the one who brought you here, I have to make sure you don't nose around and hear things you're not meant to."
Draco listened in horror as she recounted the betrayal of Peter Pettigrew and how Black was convicted of a crime he did not commit.
They had been assigned to work on the Draught of Living Death, Draco could remember all the instructions from memory considering how much of his summer he had spent glued to the book. He noticed Goyle trying to mimic his steps from the corner of his eye.
"He has asked me to remind you that should there be any cause for concern, you are to approach him or me."
Kreacher gave Potter a short bow before shuffling away, muttering to himself. Draco felt frustrated as he watched him leave, he decided to corner him some other time. He nudged past Potter and entered the room, only to find Fred and George chatting with Weasley.
Potter seemed to have suddenly noticed Draco's presence, he closed his mouth abruptly. Draco sighed dramatically, before trudging upstairs, sad that he had to leave, just when things were getting interesting.
Draco was shaken out of his reverie, he looked at Dumbledore's silvery beard tucked into the belt of his robes. His eyes refused to meet Dumbledore's knowing ones.
Severus picked on Potter relentlessly for the rest of the lesson. Draco watched him leave for lunch in a strop, he didn't envy Weasley and Granger for having to deal with Potter's legendary temper.
Potter and Draco rushed to get away from Snape's quarters. They were in the dungeons, very close to the Slytherin dorms. Draco pulled Potter into a dark alcove before dousing his hand in the Murtlap essence. Potter hissed as his skin healed, leaving only the remnants of the words.
"Your mother has his godfather's life in her hands. All these emotional fools - they always lose - "
"Draco dear, I have had quite an enlightening day today. Come along now, I need your fittings for the ceremonial robes, I think blue would be lovely on you - "
"You can't be that stupid Malfoy! For a brief moment of lunacy, I actually sympathized with you, for what Harry did - "
"Cissy, why must we decide now? The boy hasn't even come of age, surely you're not suggesting the Dark Lord will call upon our underage son?"
Draco realized Potter had a tiff with his friends and had come to him, hoping for some mollycoddling. Well he was going to be sorely disappointed.
Last year, had been confusing, one moment he was creating falsehoods about Potter and Granger's relationship to Rita Skeeter, and in the next, Potter had returned from the third task with Cedric Diggory's body, shouting to the skies of the Dark Lord's return.
Potter was pacing in the room, it was the morning of his hearing. Mr. Weasley, would be taking him for the trial directly from work. He looked like a nervous wreck, with dark circles around his eyes. Weasley was sleeping with his mouth open. Draco, being a light sleeper, was woken up when Potter started to move around. Potter hadn't noticed he was awake yet.
"Severus has graciously divulged the existence of a prophecy pertaining Harry Potter and the Dark Lord.
Fred flicked Ron on the nose. Potter was staring at Draco again. Ever since, he had been cleared, Potter seemed to be in better spirits. He edged closer to Draco before whispering.
Draco expertly shifted the topic to Zabini's new step father, after that. He excused himself once his friends were sufficiently distracted, he needed a respite from the constant lying. He wondered if hiding in the lavatory for the rest of the journey would be a possibility.
"Don't be so dramatic, darling. Draco will listen to reason, he's a good boy, he will do whatever is necessary to ensure the safety of this family."
"Well, then you should know, that she works for Fudge, the very same Fudge who is trying to portray you as a raving attention seeker in the papers - "
It had been a week since the Dark Lord had returned. Lucius had been quiet ever since, only stepping in to make sure Draco understood the magnitude of the current scenario. Lucius sighed, his son didn't have the makings of a killer, he was too soft. He pinched the bridge of his nose before returning to the Daily Prophet. Harry Potter had been caught practicing underage magic in front of a muggle. Lucius snorted,
The Order members slowly lowered their wands, his mother's wand was removed from her person. Potter held his shoulders brutally, while Weasley searched his robes for his wand. Draco glared at Potter, Potter was towering over him, he had grown over the summer.
If anyone was enjoying the party less than him, it would have to be Potter. Over the evening, he had to entertain sympathy for not being made prefect. Draco watched, as he abruptly left in the midst of the festivities. Well, if Potter was allowed to leave, Draco certainly wouldn't be staying.
Weasley seemed perplexed at the semi-friendly tones his brothers had adopted with Draco. Potter's head swerved comically as he tried to keep up with the conversation. Draco scratched his nose before dropping down on his mattress. Potter sat down right next to him.
Draco felt adrenaline course through his veins. He was currently rummaging through Snape's stores. He had disarmed Snape's locks rather easily, he felt rather proud of himself. Potter was keeping watch. Draco's hand clasped around the bottle.
Moody barked at him, Draco felt afraid of his pointed gaze. He tried to hide behind Potter's trunk and prayed no one would see him. Black was attracting too much attention, Draco placed a hand on the dog's back.
Draco smiled smugly, he was wasting his energy throwing a fit when his father would do all the work for him. He waited with gleeful anticipation for the fireworks.
Draco wondered since when Potter sought his company that he was willing to go to such extents. He waited for Potter to speak his mind.
They were walking past Hagrid's cabin now, Draco had never been fond of traipsing near the Forest in the dark. He stopped Potter.
"Potter, why do you care so much, what anyone thinks about you? You know the truth, shouldn't that be enough -"
"Draco, your father and I, we've taught you better than that. This marriage won't mean anything, it's not going to affect your life in any way, it will be purely ceremonial. When the Dark Lord is defeated, I'll ensure that it's broken, you have my promise - "
Draco gave him a pointed look. Potter waited for him to elaborate, but Draco was feeling drowsy. Travelling on the train, usually lulled him to sleep, he took a seat near the window, resting his head on the ledge.
*******************************************************************************************************************************
Draco shook his head to dislodge his current thoughts, his parents were in uncertain danger, he himself was in a precarious position with his house. There were important things he needed to focus on, he couldn't let himself be swayed by
"What are you both doing in this room? Honestly, you boys and your fighting - I've put up an extra mattress in your room. I expect the three of you to behave and get along - do I make myself clear?"
Narcissa smiled, things would fall into place eventually. It was time for her to make arrangements for the marriage, Draco deserved the best after all. Diagon Alley was lovely this time of the year.
Draco had barely ducked his head before Weasley's trunk soared down the stairs, knocking Ginny Weasley aside. Mrs. Weasley, was shouting, Ginny was bleeding, the twins were apparating and scaring the living daylights out of Granger.
Black had taken him to an empty room, save for the tapestry depicting the Black family tree. He registered his parents' names, a gold line ending at his own. Black's fingers traced at the blackened region, where his name would have been. A tense silence filled the room.
By the time, he was done, only Potter was waiting for him. He was dangling his feet, buried in a very used copy of Quidditch through the Ages. He closed the book, when he saw that Draco was out.
Draco watched Potter's anger deflate in a matter of seconds. That's very interesting, he thought to himself. He hadn't realized how easy it was to circumvent Potter's anger from reaching the boiling point.
"Your father's friend has manged to glean that Sirius has been granted ownership of the Black ancestral house. It's all for the best, really, I never cared for it personally - "
Prof. Umbridge's speech was so long and boring, Draco's attention wavered almost instantaneously. He watched Potter's face slump at the Gryffindor table, Draco hid his smile behind his goblet.
Potter shifted in his sleep and turned his back to Draco. It suited Draco just fine, he was getting irritated by Potter's constant distrust, however accurate it may be. A few minutes later, Potter's voice interrupted the deafening silence.
Draco walked on his tiptoes, he didn't need one of his friends to wake up now and quiz him. He changed into his pajamas quickly before getting into his bed. Goyle's snores provided the background for his late night musings.
