“Oh Harry,” was all Hermione could seem to muster up. Draco watched them both engage in a silent conversation and couldn’t help but smile.
It wasn’t as if he were unhappy about his new realization of fond feelings for Draco, it’s just, he didn’t know what that meant about himself. Was he gay?
Once again, he was halted from taking his thoughts about gray eyes any further, this time by a very stern looking Hermione, who had pulled him by the sleeve of his jumper to sit with her on one of the sofas away from the group.
He knew it wasn’t because of anything Draco had said yesterday. Of course, he knew it would be difficult for Draco to face the reality of turning from his parents and fighting alongside him in the coming war. Perhaps that was what consumed Draco in his moments lost in thought. He knew it couldn’t be easy for the other boy to go against everything he’d been raised to believe in, to go against his parent’s wishes. However, he also knew that if his desire to please his parents was steadfast, he wouldn’t have spent his summer tangled up with Harry avoiding the fate they’d chosen for him.
Of course, we all know they're going to have to face themselves and each other soon enough!
Of course, everyone was expecting him to be there alongside Harry because of the bond, but that didn’t mean they were looking forward to sharing their space with him for the remainder of the week.
“I don’t want to hide,” Draco announced suddenly and almost without his own permission. He let out another deep breath, “I mean…I don’t want to pretend at least.”
“Well, tell me, what has you tossing and turning at night? The idea that with a war going on there may not be enough people to sit around and rave on about how brilliant you are, or worse, the fact that your father won’t be able to buy your way out?” Harry returned channeling his own sneer, as he peered over at Malfoy wariness back full fledge.
Draco knew everything was about to change, he and Harry were going to be forced out of their pleasant summer bubble and into reality. They would never get to be those people at the start of a relationship that was full of possibility; falling in love, finishing school together, getting a flat, living happily ever after or whatever rubbish timeline normally occurred for people who were not Harry and Draco.
I hope this chapter at the very least renews your faith in me <3
“Should I suck you properly then?” Harry asked looking up at Draco innocently.
Harry was used to be overwhelmed by Draco and not just this summer, but always. Before, it had been the insults, the coldness, the suspicion that took over him. He’d let himself be consumed by the
What he did know for sure was that two nights ago, just one night after the tunnel, Potter had, secured him against the mattress in quite a compromising position, and just when Draco thought he was surly going to lose his mind from all the friction, Potter had pulled away from his lips, panting deliciously out of breath against Draco’s swollen lips and whispered almost pleadingly, a desperate rasp to his voice, “please, call me Harry, Draco.”
Hermione was flushed a solid pink that extended from her ears across her cheeks to her nose. “I hadn’t thought that me finding out first would upset him, I merely thought that if every other Weasley here somehow discovered it before Harry told him outright…I mean of course Harry would tell me first. How could he not? Ronald’s unpredictable on his best days, he means well but being the youngest boy out of five older brothers means often having a superiority complex…and then with Harry as his best mate…”
Somehow Hedwig always knew when she was needed. Harry knew she was anxious for a bit a freedom as he watched her swoop down more than eager for some long awaited travel. He attached Hermione’s letter and watched her flit away, left in thought over how best to approach Draco after their hours of silence. Harry tilted his head back against 4 Privet Drive and allowed his eyes to drift up to the window above him where he wondered if Draco was still draped, all angles across their bed. The conveyed image alone was enough to drag Harry up, hoping the Dursley’s were distracted enough not to notice him as he slinked back up the stairs.
Draco was lulled from his anxious mind by the familiar warmth of Harry’s weight leaning into him. He looked over at where Harry was now leaning against his shoulder perched next to him on the stairs leading out into the Weasley’s back yard. Draco’s eyes wandered up Harry’s form and lingered on the boy’s lips curved into a soft smile before meeting his eyes, searching.
Anyways, let me know what you think of this one! <3
And so, this old habit they both had of obsessing over one another became renewed. Draco knew he spent as much time thinking of Potter as potter spent thinking of him. He wasn’t stupid, he knew their old rivalry went beyond that of childish jealousy and hatred. What he and Potter shared was special, and always had been even in the strange twisted way their relationship existed.
Look ‘Mione, there really isn’t any easy way to say this or explain it or make sense of it for that matter. So, I’m just going to come right out with it.
Harry attempted to return the favor telling him stories of Ron and Hermione, and of Dudley and his Aunt and Uncle. Anything to hear Draco’s laugh, to see his eyes light up and his head thrown back without a care in the world.
“Why in God’s name did I hear screaming from your room last night, I thought we nipped this in the bud, boy!” Potter’s uncle practically spat at him fuming, “I can think of a few reasons he was screaming,” Dudley spoke sarcastically with an even larger smirk in Draco’s direction.
Harry really laughed at that, “Are we really running that late?”
Harry watched very intently as Draco politely excused himself to get ready for bed. It had been an awfully long night, after dinner they’d all wandered back into the living room to chat some more, and that had been a few hours ago. He knew Draco must be tired, but he also knew that this was an opportunity and he wasn’t going to muck it up.
Draco assumes Harry takes his silence as an invitation to elaborate, and so he continues on, “well I was thinking of taking up a new hobby you see and thought you might have a recommendation for me?” he concedes with a shrug of his shoulders as if to say he doesn’t know where any of this is coming from either.
“Honestly? No. They’re all bound to find out soon enough anyways, and Ron already knows so what’s the real point?”
Harry was yanked from the inner dialogue he’d been having with himself when the pain nestled in his gut became sharper. He knew Draco must have been feeling it too, so why wasn’t he here? For the first time since his musings had started, he began to second guess how the other boy might feel about him, what if for Draco it was just the bond? What if the bond drove his actions, and Harry was overthinking the small touches, the midnight confessions, the startling action to stand up for Harry to his entire family? He couldn’t be overthinking it, could he? Harry thumped himself down on the edge of the bed he shared with Draco, resting his elbows on his knees he slumped his head in his hands.
Draco was pulled from his train of thought as they entered Potter’s very compact room, if you could truly name where they were standing ‘a room,’ a box seemed more fitting. Draco watched as Potter kicked his trunk underneath his diminutive bed and flopped himself down onto said sleeping cot. Draco idly wondered, while awkwardly standing at the door, where he might sleep in such a tiny space. “Shut it, and get in, I’m in no mood to deal with the two of them tonight. I fully intend to try and enjoy this night of peace before Dudley gets back tomorrow,” Potter snapped without looking at him.
He’d checked Hermione, and Ginny’s room, the backyard, Quidditch pitch, and dining room once more just for good measure. He was just beginning to become exasperated and could feel the mild pull of the bond starting to take hold in his gut when he stumbled upon the blonde curled up and tucked away on one of the sofa’s in the corner of the sitting room.
Draco let out a breath he hadn’t known he’d been holding in and began following the large group of redheads towards the train. He stopped short, purely on impulse and turned back towards where Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were standing waving goodbye to the rest of their children as they each ducked onto the Hogwarts Express.
Draco made his way to the kitchen sink, just as Mrs. Weasley re-entered from the back door that lead out to where their makeshift pitch was set up.
He knew he had lasted far longer than he thought he would, and he was doing surprisingly better than their last encounter which had left him with come in his pants after simply giving Harry a blow job.
. Whispering promises in the dark wrapped in the sheets, tangled in each other, bodies pressed close.
Draco longed for nothing more than to stealthily steal away into Harry’s bed and press along the outline of his body until it would be a difficult task to tell which limb belonged to whom. He let out an unmeasured sigh, realizing much too late just how loud he’d allowed himself to be. He internally chastised himself, trying his best to remember that Harry’s best mate was sharing the same small space.
“Okay Harry, up you go, time to find a certain beautiful blonde” Fred sing-songed waggling his eyebrows as he crouched down to help Ron pull him up right.
And Draco pulled the brunette to his lips, knowing full well that Harry was unlikely to make it very long without a kiss and the thought alone made his heart feel full.
“Draco, you’ve really had no word from anyone this summer?” Granger asked pointedly.
Potter’s eyes shot back up and met Draco’s intently, he could feel the brunette searching for something there, and Draco only hoped he could supply whatever it was that he needed. It was in that moment that Draco knew he and Potter were more alike than either of them could admit both to each other and to themselves. And even though that was true, the part about having trouble admitting it, that is, Draco knew he could feel safe sharing this with him.
“Draco,” Harry’s moans were more reckless, and he was begging Draco’s name from his lips which drove the blonde absolutely wild, and also concerned that the Dursley’s might burst into the room at any moment fully aware of their activities. Although, if they were fully aware perhaps that was what was keeping them at bay.
Harry let out a frustrated groan and squeezed Draco’s hand slightly. “I don’t know what it means Ron, at least in terms of all that. I do know that I love him.”
His hand was forced however, when the door was nudged open slightly, and the curly hair and brown eyes of Hermione peered around the side, eyes wide for only a moment before he visibly watched them soften.
“Thank Godric, I didn’t think it would be this easy to find you.”
It was thoughts like these that often-made Harry wonder if the two boys were more alike than he initially thought, which often brought him back to Madam Malkins Robes for All Occasions just five years ago. Harry found himself dwelling on that moment, the one when he’d first met Draco, much more than he was willing to admit. He often found himself down a rabbit hole of what-ifs, only to be pulled out by a touch on the wrist and an inquisitive look from the older version of the blonde-haired blue eyed boy he’d been thinking of.
All Draco could do was grace him with a lazy grin and pull him back in for another fevered kiss.
*****
Harry perched on the edge of their cot deeply immersed in the curling letters of Hermione’s script that addressed the note to him. It wasn’t that he was afraid of her response, it’s just…that he was terrified of her response. Deep, deep down he knew he had nothing to worry about, this was ‘Mione, his best friend and probably the least judgmental person on the face of the earth. However, the thought didn’t seem to do anything to curb the clenching of his heart at the thought that she wouldn’t approve of Draco.
“Did you really have any doubt that I felt the same?”
Suddenly, Severus’s head shot back up in realization. He was apt at charms, surely there was a way to bind Draco to the Potter boy, although, he knew neither would comply willingly, no. Of course, it would have to be done with much finesse, he knew the headmaster would not be too keen on his irrational and plainly selfish plot. Conversely, it didn’t seem to matter to the potions master how any of the parties affected might feel about his plot to keep young Draco safe from the Dark Lord’s plans, it did not seem significant enough that both boys clearly loathed one another, or that Dumbledore would be less than pleased at how this might hugely complicate his own intricate design of Potter’s function in his own scheme against Voldemort’s downfall.
Harry sat up to face him, reaching a hand out, “I know that Draco, I know they’re your parents, but they’re wrong.”
Draco searched the room for Harry, wishing desperately to make eye-contact with him, realizing it would definitely be a little while before he was reunited with him again. His search was in vain, but he knew deep down he couldn’t be too far as the bond seemed content; no pain evident other than his own braying nerves.
Harry felt himself tense briefly and eyes widen, he’d been thinking the same thing on repeat in his mind over the last few days. Hearing the three words spoken out loud between them, spilling from Draco’s flushed lips had sounded like rapture.
Both boys’ let out audible sighs, clinging to each other in the empty tunnel, as the rain poured down around them.
Draco’s eyes were wide again, and his skin was so warm. He looked at Harry with pure want, but there was something else there, something soft. It made Harry’s heart constrict. Why had he denied himself this, why had he denied them both for so long.
The pair had decided to move in together after school. They’d grown accustomed to one another, and Harry had learned Draco’s habits, pet peeves, what made him laugh, and the way he liked his tea. Hermione and Ron were moving in together after all, and well, Harry found he didn’t quite like the idea of living alone or without the blonde git. Harry worked for the ministry as an auror and Draco worked for a private potions firm in London, so it worked out perfectly and seemed only logical that they remain roommates. What Harry hadn’t been expecting was just how often Draco seemed to walk around their flat in Harry’s clothes.
Draco stayed still, not wanting to alter Potter’s decision to open up to him about the terrible things that swallowed him up at night. He knew that it meant something that the brunette had chosen to speak instead of staying silent and leaving the unease between them.
“You must be barking, that charm, that bond it’s messed with your head.”
“So just Draco and Harry then huh? What does that look like exactly Potter?”
“You tell me,” Harry spoke with only a hint of crossness in his voice but daring to reallocate his gaze back over to Malfoy. Harry didn’t really talk to anyone about his dreams, not even Ron or Hermione. It wasn’t that he was ashamed of them, it was more that he didn’t know how to process them. He also knew that his friends would only worry, and they wouldn’t really be able to understand what it was like to relive his Godfather’s death every night, or Cedric’s death, or see inside Voldemort’s twisted mind. Harry didn’t have the energy to try and explain it to them, so he tended to avoid it, and he wondered if he was going to have to derive some way to change the course of this conversation with Malfoy because it seemed to be dangerously veering in that direction.
Draco watched as Hermione let out a deep laugh at that, “Of course he did. He is such a prat sometimes.”
Harry watched a small smile grace her lips, and she pulled him into a hug. “Harry Potter, I don’t think I’ve ever seen you like this. It’s definitely entertaining to say the least, and I’m happy for you. But I mean it, you have to talk to Ronald. Let me know if I can help, yeah?” She pulled back to look at him the smile still in place.
Again, so sorry to leave you hanging! Your comments really do make my whole life, especially those of you who have been here with me through the entire ride! Thank you!!! <3
With a huff Harry looked at the pages of the notebook in front of him truly perplexed as to where to start. How could he even begin to explain this to Hermione? Harry knew she was bound to be a little put out that Harry hadn’t told her sooner, he knew she loved and cared for him, he mused that she was probably the person aside from Draco who knew him best. ‘Mione could read him like no other. Harry knew that even if he didn’t tell her, she would undoubtably be one step ahead of him anyways; she always was. He mused that she probably knew things about him that he hadn’t even uncovered for himself yet;
It wasn’t as if he wanted anyone to notice his silence, or even his return to school. In fact, going unnoticed is what made it so easy to engage in his new favorite past time, gazing at Potter. Engaging in his hobby so frequently helped Draco notice that Potter had become quiet as well. Draco found himself thinking that quiet looked good on Potter, not that he thought Potter looked good of course.
“Hello Draco, where’ve you been all day – I didn’t see you out at Quidditch.”
The effort to escape only seemed to slow the toady down, but as the gap between himself and Potter grew the ache became more sharp. A few more feet and Draco had doubled over; he would have fallen to his knees if the prick holding him hostage didn’t have such a firm grip, holding him upright. Draco was beginning to panic, he couldn’t break free, and he knew it would only be a matter of time before one of them passed out from the pain, except this time they wouldn’t be waking up in the hospital wing.
“Let’s say goodbye to your aunt and uncle Harry, and then I’ll apparate us all to The Burrow safely,” Remus said with a small smile guiding both boys down the stairs.
The weight of Potter’s thigh should be trivial, it’s not as if he’d proposed marriage,
He now had the attention of both Potter and Weasley he mused silently, just barely refraining from letting out an anxious laugh at the situation. Never in a million years did he think he’d be sitting here, thigh pressed against golden boy while his Gryffindor gang worried about him. Not that he was complaining, but he wasn’t sure it would never feel like his normal. He sheepishly shrugged, thinking of how best to answer Granger’s question.
Harry didn’t dare break their gaze knowing that their intense game had again reached a new level. After several long moments of observing one another in silence Harry glanced down at Malfoy’s hands gently resting on top of the book in his lap. With only a moment of hesitation Harry lunged forward and pulled one of Malfoy’s hands into his own before speaking. “The war changed us all, I feel like I can’t even say for better or for worse, just differently.”
“You’ll always be my insufferable Gryffindor Potter,” Draco stated softly knowing full well that his tone was giving him away completely.
Now that Draco had Harry, he knew that for him there was no going back. He knew that he would spend the next thousand years fighting for Harry or die trying.
Draco’s fingers curled experimentally in the brunette’s hair, Potter answered by tugging Draco in closer, fists still clenched in his shirt. Again, slowly, because Draco was not rushing this, he wanted to be able to commit every single second of these moments to memory especially if that was all he was going to have moving forward.
so I’ve been in a right twist over it,” he finished with a slight smirk.
Once again I am so, so, so sorry at how long it's taken me to post!
“Hi,” Draco almost whispered as Harry approached him and he couldn’t help but smile as his eyes were met with silver.
Pansy was like him, to the world she was harsh, cruel, narcissistic, but on the inside, she was just as afraid as Draco and this is what had made them grow close over the years. They had a mutual understanding, and respect between them, their friendship was nothing like what Harry had with Weasley and Granger. Their relationship could barely skim the surface of what the golden trio shared with one another, but it was all Draco had. Well, it was all Draco had, until Harry that is.
“Don’t go,” Harry spoke so softly and with a voice so full of sleep Draco had to really listen in order to hear him murmur an even softer, “please Draco,” with a waver in his tired voice. Draco gazed at him, almost unsure of how to answer him, ‘it wasn’t as if he could really go anywhere now was it?’ He thought only mildly sarcastically to himself, before he let himself consider what Harry was really asking for which was, ‘please don’t not touch me,’ or at least that was Draco’s take on the situation. “No,” Draco said with a little half-smile, “no, Potter, where would I go, especially after you’ve asked so nicely?” He finished before sliding down the bed onto his side and pulling Potter down to rest within the crook of his neck, fastening both arms securely around him and resting his cheek against his soft dark hair.
(See the end of the chapter for
Love you all!!!!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
“Ah, so you knew I’d come looking for you. Thought you could lure me away?”
“Esh Hermione, I think we’re all happy for them,” Fred replied with another laugh.
Harry knew he was done for officially one evening a few weeks after their Halloween conversation. They were all in their usual spots when Harry came down from the dormitories; Hermione curled up in the arm chair nearest the fire with Ron on the ground propped up with his back against her chair, and Malfoy curled up into the corner of the sofa sincerely immersed in a book Harry hadn’t seen him with before. Harry stopped abruptly in his decent when his eyes reached Malfoy, bottom lip pulled between his teeth, brow scrunched up in concentration, cheeks flushed, and hair a tousled mess.
After a while Potter seemed to drag himself back over to Draco, turning back to the group of redheads with one last wave and smile, before walking through the barrier leading to the muggle side of the station. All Draco could do was blindly follow the brunette in front of him, dodging muggles in his wake. Suddenly, they came to a halt in front of an extremely large and portly muggle with a gray mustache and angry red face. “Hullo, Uncle Vernon” Harry spoke to the bulky muggle in a tone that suggested Potter wasn’t exactly pleased to be reunited with this particular family member in the least. Potter’s uncle seemed to only grunt in reply before asking, “that the one we’re supposed to take with us,” gesturing towards Draco. Harry only gave a nod in response which was more preferable than the grunt that it seemed was the only response Harry’s uncle had in his repertoire.
Draco was lurched awake in the midst of a deep sleep by a piercing scream and a painful tug deep in his gut from the boy thrashing beside him on their shared cot. Draco felt panic surge through him, of course he had been shaken awake in the night by the other boy’s nightmares before, but never like this. He was shocked that the Dursley’s however uncaring they were hadn’t barged in at the very least to demand, in Potter’s uncle’s words ‘to know what the bloody hell is going on in here?’ It dawned on him then, how common these night terrors must be for Harry, for his aunt and uncle to ignore the strident screams of their nephew who sounded as if he were being murdered.
Of course, at first Draco had been shocked, he couldn’t understand why he would bond him to Harry of all people; he felt sure that at the very least Severus thought they both ‘hated’ the brunette in equal measure. Although Draco knew his hatred was a thinly veiled façade, but to the outside looking in it would appear that he loathed Harry.
“Come here Draco,” Harry spoke, shattering the silence so softly but with such a gentle disposition that Draco could do nothing but comply, not that anything could keep him from the other boy anyways. Draco pushed off the door and settled himself opposite Harry, their knees brushing as he sat down. Afraid to look up, for fear of what he might see in the other boy’s eyes, Draco took a deep breath, sat back leaning on his hands, and somehow found the courage to meet Harry’s green eyes.
Draco found that he was dragging himself through the motions of who he was supposed to be more and more as of late. Suddenly, after watching witches and wizards being tortured and killed at his kitchen table, he felt sick at the prospect of bullying and torturing the other students on his way to class. He felt himself hold back and let Crabbe and Goyle take the reins as he feigned interest, opting to retreat up to his room whenever the opportunity presented himself. The problem was, that he knew what his father had in store for him. He knew that when he returned home that summer, he was to take the dark mark and become a deatheater just like his father. Draco felt sick at the possibility of it, he knew he could never rise to his father’s level of obedience, he was too cowardly. Draco knew that he could never fake loyalty to Lord Voldemort, he would never be believed, and ultimately, he would be killed, he had seen it happen time and again.
His anxiety had peaked, and the reality that he had no idea what he was returning to had him the most unsettled.
Draco watched as Harry let out a laugh and squeezed his thigh more firmly. “How could I have missed how funny you are? Save all your whit and charm for Grabbe, and Goyle then? What was it that made you deem me worthy enough?”
Draco couldn’t meet his eyes it seemed; Harry twisted his hands to grasp onto Draco’s.
This chapter is a bit lengthy, and hopefully it will persuade you to forgive me! <3
– Malfoy, and I, we’ve been…
“Pigwidgeon” Harry huffs at the portrait guarding the entrance, and rushes in eyes searching in earnest for a quiet boy curled up with a book. However, his search comes up empty and he begins to wonder where Malfoy might be if not there. His brain telling him almost annoyedly that Malfoy has truly spent most of his free time right here in this common room with him. Harry glances towards the spot on the sofa in front of the fire that usually holds a concentrated Malfoy but is now devoid of such boy. His eyes instead dart over to the staircase that leads up to the boy’s dormitories, and his heart begins to pound.
Draco felt as if he were holding his breath, breathing felt too loud in the silence that stretched across the room. He wondered if maybe they were having another non-verbal conversation, or if Harry’d just shocked Weasley speechless, which could be proven a real talent as he never seemed to shut up in Draco’s opinion.
“Draco, I…” Draco watched as Harry ran a hand through his own hair before meeting his eyes again and yanking him to meet his lips in a desperate kiss. Harry began kissing down Draco’s neck and snaking his hands down his sides.
He leaned his head down, tongue giving a tentative lick to the head of Harry’s cock, tasting the pre-come before once again daring to let his eyes dart up for the other boy’s reaction. Harry’s eyes were squeezed shut lips parted and head tossed back against his pillow, and Draco marveled that Harry had never looked more beautiful or hot or sexy or delicious than in that moment. This version of Harry obliviated all of Draco’s best fantasy versions of the brunette in all the best ways, the biggest one being that this was the real living, breathing, flesh and blood Harry Potter, and Draco was about to suck him off.
He found his eyes drawn to Granger, he noticed she seemed intently immersed in something. Draco followed her sightline across the table to where Ron was sat, laughing at something one of the twins had said. Second glance back at the curly haired brunette and he knew what he was looking at, he saw it every day reflected back at him in the mirror.
Dinner at The Burrow was the most entertaining experience of Draco’s life thus far. Of course, he wasn’t counting anything he’d experienced with Harry because those moments were beyond a source of entertainment; they were everything.
Harry watched Draco look bewildered for a moment, and then open his mouth as if to respond only to close his mouth again in silence. The pair were still latched on to one another Harry mused, and used it as leverage to pull Draco into his lips.
“No, Malfoy, that’s just it, I really actually like it a lot. I’m almost finished.” Draco looks back up at potter with wide eyes, “Really?” he asks tentatively.
Harry let out a laugh, and let his head fall back down between his shoulders again. Harry realized in that moment that he was face to face with Draco’s very hard cock. A very telling wet spot had formed on the front of the blonde’s pants, and without thinking Harry leaned down to suck wanting nothing more than to know how Draco tasted.
Their lips met in a visceral open-mouthed kiss, “I’m not gonna last much longer,” Draco panted out eyes fixated on Harry.
Draco knew Hermione wasn’t just anyone to Harry, it was his best friend. Of course, there was Weasley, but that wasn’t the same as what he had with Granger and Draco knew it. If he could win over Granger, he could inevitably win over Weasley and so he had begun devising his own plan for their final week at “The Burrow,” or so it was titled.
He watched her face soften as she gazed at him, taking in what he’d said.
He pulled the button of Harry’s jeans free, eyes never leaving his face as he pushed the fabric down just enough to free his cock and wrap his fingers snugly around the warmth. He watched as Harry let his head fall between his shoulders and let out a guttural moan, dark fringe tickling the skin along Draco’s collarbone.
Without thinking Harry pulled away and began dragging Draco down the hallway, and towards the bathroom. He yanked open the door, pushed the blonde in, and closed it behind them.
Draco closed his eyes, “Harry,” he half breathed, half moaned.
Harry let out a sigh as carefully as he could, careful not to wake Draco. He knew he needed to write to Hermione, and he definitely needed a quiet place where he could take his time undistracted, and without injuring the bond too harshly; he peered over at the head of blonde hair next to him.
, he’d confessed to Draco about writing to Hermione. He felt safe with Draco, and so he rambled on for a while professing his confusion about who he was, and when Draco encouraged him like he meant it, like he actually wanted Harry to confide in him, he kept going. He told Draco his fears about Hermione and Ron and how important they and the Weasley’s were to him.
“No, Potter, I don’t think it was,” Draco retorted meeting Potter’s eyes with a grin, daring to admonish his true feelings for the brunette.
Harry’s eyes snapped up to his at the statement, but still said nothing. Draco took the silence as encouragement enough to continue.
Harry didn’t speak he merely coiled around Draco like a snake, wrapping all of his warm limbs and slivers of skin along his. Draco was helpless against Harry’s touch and could do nothing more than bury his face in the crook of his neck and breath the other boy in.
Draco’s mind was immersed in confusion over what Potter meant, what was he saying, how did he feel, what now?
“Yeah,” Harry gave a slight nod in response, “not like it’s anything important though, never has been.”
“I’ve never really told anyone else about my nightmares, ‘Mione and Ron, they wouldn’t understand, and ‘Mione would just worry and try to get me to talk to Dumbledore or someone else about it. But it doesn’t feel right to talk about it, it doesn’t feel like anyone would understand, especially someone who hasn’t witnessed it.”
Both boys were yanked from their revelry of snogging, doing their damndest to keep all their clothes on, lest be caught in a very compromising situation by someone from the Order. An idea even Harry didn’t relish the thought of, no matter how much he loved a certain blonde’s naked arse.
Nevertheless, he chose a film, and to Draco’s delight he let the blonde pay, ‘It’s your birthday prat,’ he’d said for the thousandth time that day, and not wanting to do anything that might alter the curve of the other boy’s lips he’d sheepishly conceded. However, lucky for him, the theatre was mostly empty as he had suspected and he led Draco to the back of the theatre eyes watching Draco intently, amused by the blonde’s keen interest as his eyes raked over the film immersed in the people that flicked across the screen. Harry almost didn’t want to distract him, he was almost content to just watch him enjoy the movie, but it was his birthday after all.
actually avoiding him. On impulse, his urge to be near Malfoy made him elude Ron and Hermione on their way out of the Great Hall, and dart straight up to the eighth-year common room in search of grey eyes and white blonde hair.
Once again, Harry was pulled from his brooding inner dialogue by a tug at his wrist, “should we stop here for your birthday meal?” Draco asked with a jesting tone, and a raise of his left eyebrow and Harry found himself wondering for the thousandth time that summer how in the hell he was able to lift just one eyebrow?
That was all it took for him, Harry felt himself nodding feverishly as if in response to the most erotic thing he had ever heard grace Draco Malfoy’s lips, and began rutting against the other boy more earnestly eliciting a string of moans from both of them.
Harry hadn’t been able to stop thinking about Malfoy since…well if he was keeping himself in check, he hadn’t been able to stop thinking about Draco since the start of term when their eyes first met. But this felt different, Harry hadn’t been able to stop thinking about him in ways that made his cheeks hot, and his skin prickle. Of course, he still hadn’t really faced himself in terms of what it meant, only that he knew he relished in getting lost in how Malfoy made him feel.
Draco had learned that he was not very apt in the kitchen, something Harry had assured him was in fact true during their time at the Dursley’s. However, Mrs. Weasley didn’t seem to mind in the least. She was very patient with him as she instructed him how to chop up vegetables for the salad, as she chatted away to him about anything and everything.
Please, please, please forgive me for taking so long to update!!!
“I love you Draco.”
“You have been the happiest part of my summer, and I was shocked to say the least. You have surprised me in all the best ways, and I didn’t know Draco. I didn’t know what my feelings for you meant about me.”
Severus stopped pacing abruptly and sat down at this desk, folding his hands and placing them gently atop the apex. He let his mind travel back to his most recent discussion with the Headmaster, and how he’d explained why Potter must return to the Dursley’s each summer despite the Order’s desire for him to stay at the headquarters’; feeling that it was safer, and alleviated the need for guards in Little Whinging each night. He idly wished that there was some place Draco could go to receive the same kind of protection from the Dark Lord. He raked his fingers through his long unctuous hair in frustration, leaning his forehead down onto his desk.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
He reached a hand up to lightly fondle Draco’s balls earning himself a hiss and quick intake of breath from the blonde.
Harry’s hands came up to frame Draco’s head for leverage, looking down into Draco’s eyes brazenly. Draco’s hands slid down the brunette’s back to grip his arse fully, pushing them both into a rhythm that left their breaths coming in pants, and had Harry’s forehead resting on his shoulder moaning into his neck as their cocks rutted together deliciously.
Draco tightened his grip on Harry’s wrists, and arched in to kiss him hungrily. Harry was only too happy oblige him.
“We all need to be allowed that happiness Hermione,” he said with a nudge towards the makeshift quidditch pitch.
Draco knew that Potter was right, it had only lessoned the pain to a dull ache but had not subsided it completely, they needed more contact. Before Draco could act on Potter’s words, he was caught off guard when the brunette dropped his hand, and pulled Draco by the sleeve of his shirt, wrapping him in his arms. Draco almost hesitantly snaked his own arms around Potter’s neck but giving in and pressing his body flush against the other boy’s as the bond prickled and thrummed through his blood stream it seemed, dulling the ache completely, leaving trails of pleasure in its wake.
He set a slow pace, taking Draco’s cock down his throat and slowly sliding back up to graze his teeth over the sensitive head. Draco was shaking and writhing beneath Harry’s grip, fingers white from bracing the countertop so stoutly.  Harry moved one hand from Draco’s hip to the base of his cock and picked up the pace. He suctioned his lips and sucked on the head of Draco’s cock obscenely using his hand to meet his mouth’s ministrations.
After their discussion Halloween night, Draco mused that the two boys had become inseparable, not that he was complaining. Draco knew that his feelings towards Potter were unraveling at a pace quicker than he knew how to handle, let alone decipher, but he liked the way he felt too much to care. Draco noticed that Potter was finding new and more creative ways to touch him inconspicuously; a graze on the shoulder here, a brush of the arm there, and plopping down next to him much closer than necessary more often than not. Again, not that Draco was complaining. In fact, Potter’s boldness only seemed to embolden Draco who was only too keen to return Potter’s soft grazes, and brushes.
Draco let out a soft titter of laughter, and suddenly Harry needed to know what Draco looked like when he came. He needed to know what he looked like sprawled out in the middle of their kitchen with Harry between his thighs. He needed to know what Draco sounded like echoed through their flat.
Harry’s expression was completely blank. Draco slowly began to panic, and instead of waiting just pushed forward into an explanation.
He could feel the other boy let out an audible sigh and relax into Harry’s grasp.
He was pulled from his thoughts like so many other times that summer by Harry. Both of them were meant to be packing, getting ready to leave tomorrow. The idea had been to pack now, so they didn’t have to leave their cot until the very last second, all Harry’s sinister plot.
Draco let out a groan, in his own personal fantasy land the two of them laid entwined on Weasley’s bedroom floor for the rest of the day, undisturbed. However, he knew Hermione was right and if he didn’t want Mrs. Weasley to be the one to come up here and discover them wrapped up in each other he needed to nudge them along. Lest Mrs. Weasley catch them and think Draco’d spent the entire summer debauching the golden boy. The thought brought a smile to his face at the very least.
From the moment they stepped through the barrier to 9 ¾ time slowed to a hazy sluggish blur that seemed to go on around him without any care in regard to whether he was a willing participant in its passing or not.
Harry kissed the junction of Draco’s thigh again, before standing up fully and taking in Draco’s fully debauched form. His pale skin a stark contrast to the dark granite of the counter, patches of blushed red skin coated his lithe body naked except for Harry’s maroon sweater. Draco’s eyes were closed softly, trying to catch his breath; he was beautiful.
He pulled off Harry’s cock, pulling the brunette’s attention to him, “Come for me Harry,” he spoke unabashedly staring directly into his eyes before taking Harry’s cock fully. Harry let out an agonized whimper, tightened his hands in Draco’s hair and came forcefully down his throat.
Draco didn’t really care; he knew he’d live in this reality forever if he could. He never wanted to leave these steps. But he knew, he knew deep down, way down in the deep recesses of his soul, that he and Harry had to face reality. These stairs couldn’t protect or shield them from anything they were bound to face in the next few days. He had to be brave.
Hedwig just stared back at him with a look that seemed to say
“You’ve gotten taller I see, hungry dear?”
Draco accepted his hand and allowed himself to be pulled into Harry’s arms – his smile reaching his eyes now.
Hermione let out another sigh, it seemed the two of them were much more alike than he’d originally thought.
Severus’s mind continued to shift from Albus, to Potter, and then back to Draco who was incessantly the primary anxiety that plagued him on a daily basis. The boy was someone he saw himself in, unlike Potter who was wholly like his own father; arrogant, assertive. Severus knew how Draco portrayed himself, not unlike himself he put out to the world a defense to keep everyone shut out, to only allow people to see what he wanted them to. He knew that Draco’s time was up, he was about to take the dark mark, and become a servant to the Dark Lord. He knew Draco wasn’t ready, he would never fully be ready for what Voldemort, his family, and his name asked of him. And he wasn’t so sure he could stand idly by and let the boy shatter his world, and possibly die in the process.
Draco only falters for a moment. It’s not that he’s taken aback by Potters confession of a desire to escape, it’s just that he was only beginning to grow accustomed to the conversation, and his conversationalist skills have been lacking as of late. Draco thinks for a moment of his craving for more of Potter before he says, “I might have something, just depends on the kind of escape your looking for Potter” the quirk in his eyebrow back full force.
He did his best to partake in the conversation, in truth, he felt very glad to be back at The Burrow. He had always loved how warm it felt, and all the commotion that filled the walls. He’d really never felt more at home anywhere else besides Hogwarts, or unless of course home were a person in which case he felt Draco might just out win both by a good bit.
Draco was intently listening, hoping to gauge Weasley’s reaction for his own conversation with the git, but he was also basking in the reality that Harry was still latched on to his hand. He hadn’t tossed it aside and tried to hide it or shove it off on the bond, he was there facing it all head on; the true fucking Gryffindor he was. The whole idea of it made Draco have to avidly hold back a smile, lest he be caught out.
“Well Harry, is this any way to greet someone you’ve not seen in quite some time?” Remus stated in the laid-back tone, typical of him.
After years of constant vigilance and being on the run Harry never really felt settled. He struggled to relax and had difficulty slowing down. Malfoy mellowed him and brought a semblance of balance into his life that he hadn’t known that he needed at the time. Now, he knew without a doubt that he’d be lost without Draco. Yes, Draco.
to be precise. Draco watched with his back pressed against his closed bedroom door as Harry strode over to Draco’s bed and sat down on the edge, finally looking up at him with eyes so bright he could name them jade in the dark of night. For the first time since he opened the door, and realized it was Harry, Draco began to feel nervous.
“So…how’d that go?” Harry asked voice and eyes bright.
She gave him a pointed look and a nod, “See you downstairs then,” and she vanished, door closing softly behind her.
Draco’s face flushed pink, and all he could do was gaze at him.
Hermione let out a laugh, “honestly Harry, you’re not really doing a good job of trying to conceal any of this are you?” She finished with a wave of her hand towards the two of them, and emphasis on their proximity and quite possibly the fact that Harry was still latched on to the sleeve of his shirt.
“I hate to state the obvious but, there’s no way we both fit in that poor excuse for a bed,” Draco said the half-smile back in place.
“Look, Potter, I, I don’t really know what to say. I mean, ughhh,” Draco let out a frustrated groan at himself and the situation, hadn’t he vowed silence, why had he thought talking might be okay? “I guess since we're here, and neither of us has a say in the matter the least we can do is try to be civil and not kill each other, yeah?”
As soon as his back hit the wall his hands were on Harry, one snaked its way up the back of Harry’s jumper and the other tangled in his hair. They were both so desperate to stay quiet, although it had never been their specialty.
“Getting sleepy?” Draco replied softly stepping in a little closer to the brunette, half-smile on full display.
It’s just that Harry didn’t want to rock the boat. Ever. He loved having Draco as his roommate, he was funny, smart, and most importantly he didn’t mind that Harry was a complete slob. Or rather, he scolded Harry as he cleaned their flat; picking up bits of clothing and tossing out old take out boxes.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry, instantly pulling him in and pressing his body against his own fully. They kissed as if they’d been ravenous and trying to quench a thirst that had been quelling for centuries. After some time, they pulled apart reluctantly trying to catch their breath while still clenching on to one another fiercely.
What do you guys think? They still have a little ways to go but they're definitely being nudged in the right direction!
Draco leaned back too a bit, a little taken a back. “Yes.” He replied sheepishly.
Draco wanted to chance a glance over at Potter, just to see his reaction to all of this. His voice octave was never much to go on as he always seemed to be amped up over one thing or another. After a few moments of battling back and forth with himself, Draco took a small deep breath and peaked over at potter out of the corner of his eye. The dark-haired boy lay just a few feet away from him in the hospital bed next to his, eyes closed, sleeping almost peacefully. Draco gave a quick glance around the rest of the room, and with the confidence that they were truly alone turned on his side, propped his head up leaning on his hand and faced Potter to assess him fully.
“Mate we’ve all known. I mean honestly Harry the way you look at Malfoy, like he’s the last slice of Treacle Tart in the entirety of the wizarding world. It was kind of hard not to notice,” George said grin still in place as he high-fived Fred yet again.
“Harry,” Draco bit out. “Harry, fuck,” the blonde groaned deliciously.
Dumbledore turned to professor Snape with a mindful glance before turning back to face Malfoy and himself, “well, boys,” the headmaster clasped his hands together before continuing, “this is where professor Snape and I leave you be. I’m sure you have some packing to do before leaving tomorrow, we’ll be in touch.” With that Dumbledore nodded his head respectively at each boy before turning on his heel and exiting the hospital wing.
“I have no idea what you mean.”
“Yeah, I will,” and he couldn’t help but smile back.
Harry graced her with an amused smile, “what do you mean?”
Draco nodded at Harry and let himself be pulled into Potter’s side, knowing that their time was dwindling fast and hoping to just let himself enjoy the small amount of time they had left. The only thing he knew for sure, was that he knew nothing. He had not an ounce of an idea as to what he was going to be walking into this school year, but it didn’t seem to matter so long as he had Harry. He’d made it this far already and knew that even if he could he’d never go back.
As Draco laid in his hospital bed staring idly at the ceiling, he reminisced over the shit year he’d had so far. Of course, he would find himself literally stuck to the person he pretended to hate most on top of it all. He shiftlessly listened while Potter exasperatedly questioned the headmaster, choosing to remain mute, nothing he said would truly matter at this point anyways, he was outnumbered in the present company.
I know that was a lot, I’m sorry to get it all out in such a rush, I just, I didn’t know how else to put it. And that’s not the only thing Draco’s admitted to me this summer either…He’s told me, well, he’s told me that he loves me, that he’s in love with me. Again, I know this is probably a shock, I know I should have been writing more, and I’m sure you’re maybe wondering, possibly, why I’m telling you all this now? The answer, in short, is that I don’t really know. In part, I don’t really know what to say to Draco, and I don’t know how to tell you this, how I feel about him, without also telling myself. And that sounds mad, I know it does. And I’ve completely put him off. I mean he also put me off when I avoided his admission by calling him out on what choice he might make when we get back to school and he has nothing keeping him from being dragged home by Voldemort to take the mark. The most peculiar part of the whole thing was that I actually understood where the git was coming from; it being hard to go against his family and all even though it’s become perfectly clear to me this summer that following along with his parent’s choices for him is not what he wants in the least.
Draco gave a small laugh in response to Harry's comment about his aunt's cooking, before turning back to look out the window. Draco began to ruminate on the fact that it would soon, once again, be time to crawl in to Potter’s poor excuse of a bed, and not talk about it in the morning. The past week spent commiserating together, had been suffered in silence between the two of them. Draco spent a lot of time thinking about his parents, and the last conversation he had with Severus before leaving Hogwarts, but sometimes, sometimes his mind drifted over to the things Draco had shoved deep, deep down into the caverns of his soul, willing himself to be able to leave them there especially due to the circumstances.
(See the end of the chapter for
To distract himself Draco unwillingly pulls himself into the present and begins scanning the platform in search of familiar faces, not out of fondness but out of the pressing need to be in control. He did not want to be caught off guard when reuniting with Pansy, or Crabbe, or Goyle. Though he was sure neither of his prior cronies would be in search of him, as last term they’d grown apart due in large part to Draco’s desire to live inside himself and avoid human interaction at all cost. He knew however, that Pansy would not be as willing to set their years of friendship aside and would most likely see right through him as she’d done quietly that last term of school.
The thin and flimsy material of Draco’s pajama bottoms left very little to the imagination, or in his own case left quite a lot to the imagination as Harry’s cock seemed to brush against his own with every stroke of Draco’s hand. Whether unconscious or conscious on Draco’s part he reasoned it didn’t matter, it felt fucking good and he couldn’t help but wonder what it would feel like for their pricks to graze unencumbered.
If possible, her smile grew in size, “How many times must I tell you, it’s Molly, and no – everything is quite finished. You just take this out to the table and settle in dear.” With that she handed him a large salad bowl and ushered him through the door and into the dining room.
“As precious as this is, you two better get a move on, we’re leaving in twenty minutes and Mrs. Weasley is even twice as frantic as normal. I suspect it won’t be me who finds the two of you like this next time, I was only just able to volunteer myself the first time.”
Harry glanced back over Draco’s shoulder at the Dursley’s one last time, all too shocked to speak, which was normally how his aunt looked, but it was definitely new on the face of his cousin and uncle who typically lived for smart remarks.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was true that the conversation he’d had with Harry the previous evening had gone much better than he could have hoped for, but the reality that tomorrow morning they’d all be getting back on the Hogwarts express was hitting him full force like a bludger to the chest.
“No,” he heard Harry sigh out in exasperation. “It’s not the bond, look, I get it. It’s fucking Malfoy, but he’s different. He’s…”
Harry began to recognize that he only began to mind when he grasped just how much he
Harry was lost in the moment, he’d never felt so taken, so raw, so overcome in his life. He was a teenage boy, he knew his hormones should be off the charts all the time, but the truth was that they just weren’t, at least, not until now. He felt like Draco had woken something up inside him, something he hadn’t known to exist, and all he knew for sure was that he didn’t want it to go anywhere; he didn’t want Draco to go anywhere.
Suddenly, Harry’s face scrunched up as he let out another blaring scream his hands fisting the sheets as if seeking relief somehow, and Draco jerked into action. Lifting his hands slowly and gently he took Harry’s face in his hands running his thumbs soothingly down the soft skin of the other boy’s cheeks, “shhh, shhh, shh, Potter it’s okay, it’s okay, you’re dreaming,” he whispered faintly against the other boy’s ear. The touch alone sent a tingling thrill that seeped through his skin and seemed to settle into his bones and ease the ache in his gut, and he knew Potter could feel it too.
Feeling bold he lifts the corner of his mouth in a half smile, “this seat taken?” he indicates with his thumb at the chair across from him. Malfoy’s eyes widen a little as if taken aback by his question, “uh, yeah, no I mean, any seats available to the savior of the wizarding world isn’t it?” Harry rolls his eyes at Malfoy and sits down; this is new for both of them so he’s willing to cut Malfoy some slack on politeness.
“You’re brilliant, you know that don’t you,” Harry spoke into Draco’s hair, running lazy circles along the ridges of his spine.
Also I wanted to say directly to Skylar Johnson....I don't want you to think I completely nicked your suggestion at Hermione admitting something back to Harry in her letter, I just decided to save her confession for a little later down the line! I hope you understand!!
“Professor, if I may,” Hermione hesitated only briefly before looking up at the headmaster with a curious tilt of her head. “How will Harry, and Malfoy make it through the summer? Surely, you can’t intend to send Malfoy to stay with Harry’s aunt and uncle for two months.”
“What are you two up to?” Harry asked a genuine mirth in his tone, and eyes bright as he eyed the pair of them.
Draco couldn’t help but smile softly at him, he yearned to reach out and push his wild locks from his eyes, but he restrained himself.
“You’re bloody beautiful, you do know that don’t you?” Harry spoke into the limited space between their lips. Draco closed his eyes for a moment, breaths still coming in pants from their ardent snogging.
Draco was pulled from his thoughts as Harry continued, laughter dwindled, “I have fears too Draco,” he looked at the blonde earnestly, eyes searching.
He’d thought to take a shower and see if Mrs. Weasley maybe needed some help with dinner. However, his thoughts were thwarted when he spotted Granger curled in one of the chairs outside, trying to seem captivated in a book while surreptitiously sneaking glances toward the makeshift quidditch pitch.
He knew in that moment that he was in too deep. He’d always been content in his friendship with Draco. Yes, the blonde git was handsome, and fit. Yes, he was funny and Whitty. Yes, he was cautious and tedious, and unbearably posh. But Harry had resolved to love those things about Draco as his friend and flat mate and nothing more.
Harry began to wonder where the other boy had gone, hoping he would be back soon as to alleviate the uncomfortable feeling. Before he could dwell on the thought for much longer the blonde-haired boy appeared from Madam Pomfrey’s office with Snape, and Dumbledore just a step behind him. Malfoy had his arms wrapped around his stomach, and a scrunched up look on his face that told Harry, Malfoy was feeling it too. Harry sighed in resolution, realizing that the bond really was there, and Malfoy really was going to have to suffer through the summer at the Dursley’s with him. It gave him a tiny bit of joy to know that Malfoy truly would be suffering right alongside him.
This was something friends did, right? Friends casually touched like this, didn’t they? He thought about Ron and Hermione, and then quickly tried to think about his own relationship with both Ron and Hermione separately, and not the relationship they shared with one another. He loved them both, they were more like family to him than friends, and truly he would do anything for either of them. Though the more he thought about it the more he reasoned with himself that he didn’t want to find any reason no matter how small to be this close to Ron or Hermione. Sure, he liked spending time with them, but did he try to find just any reason no matter how miniscule to be in their presence?...The answer he knew was, no.
Selfishly he almost hopes for it because it will surely mean that the two boys will have an excuse to be seen together without real consequence. Nevertheless, Draco finds himself grateful for every moment that he feels the bond’s dull ache settled firmly in his gut, as it means the two boys are still connected. Draco muses that after all this time, after everything laid bare this summer that they’d always be connected, there’s no mistaking that. But the bond is an almost tangible tether, an invisible string keeping him connected to Harry always. The thought of severing the connection left Draco with an overwhelming sense of panic.
Harry was pulled back to reality as Draco steered the two of them towards the theatre a small grin plastered across his face. It was the kind of smile that filled Draco’s face even though Harry knew he was trying his hardest to conceal it from him. Harry didn’t mind, he’d let Draco pretend but they both knew they couldn’t hide from each other; not anymore.
“Oh, right.” Harry watched as Hedwig once again, eagerly exited out the window, without once looking back.
(See the end of the chapter for
After a moment Harry breathed out a strangled laugh and pulled Draco to him. The other boy instantly curled around him as though it were second nature and the only natural reaction to being near him. Harry breathed him in and was hit incredibly harshly with the notion that not once in his sixteen years of existence had he wished for the summer to last longer, as to not leave Privet Drive. He huffed out a bigger laugh at the notion,
“Of course, I’m a bit bothered that you didn’t tell me about Snape, or the expiration date, but I understand why you were nervous. I couldn’t have been easy to do what you just did.”
I am off the next few days! Yay! So I'll definitely be editing and therefore posting much more often!
Mrs. Weasley beamed up at him, face only slightly pinker than before and Draco couldn’t help but feel his grin grow wider after watching the exchange. It seemed he wasn’t the only one easily charmed by Potter, although if he was being honest everyone appeared to be easily won over by the green-eyed brunette.
Draco let out a breath he hadn’t even realized he’d been holding in and slumped back down.
“Yeah? You really like it,” Draco breathed out.
“I know it won’t exactly be what you’re used to, but neither is this right?”
Harry was pulled from his thoughts as he felt Draco shift beside him, as he glanced over his eyes locked with the other boys; gray met green. Draco reached up and gravity did the rest as their lips met and didn’t part for the remainder of the film.
Harry looked at him for a moment, as if really taking in what Draco had just said.
Both boys exited the theatre with flushed cheeks, swollen lips, and sheepish grins plastered across their faces. They choose to walk along the shops for a while, occasionally letting their shoulders bump, or fingers brush signature half-smiles in place.
With a sigh Potter continued, “He, he’s, well he’s pretty much an exact replica of my uncle if that’s anything to go on,” he finished in a huff dragging his eyes away from Draco’s.
Harry snapped his face back to stare at Malfoy fixedly, but was met with the same earnest gray eyes that had been gracing the blonde’s face since they stepped off the Hogwarts’s express. Harry let out a soft, audible sigh, “you get them to,” Harry spoke with a rasp in his voice that seemed to convey the frustrated conversation he’d been having with himself internally.
Draco realized suddenly that this was Harry’s very subtle way of giving him an out if he wanted it. As much as Draco wanted to walk the halls of Hogwarts hand in hand with boy wonder, there was another large part of him that was terrified of the implications. However, walking away from Harry altogether was completely out of the question.
This is how Harry wanted to keep him always. And why shouldn’t Draco be properly debauched daily? Draco who always listened when Harry had a bad day at work, Draco who made sure their flat was stocked with Harry’s favorite snacks, Draco who let Harry rest his feet in his lap when they watched the telly, Draco who left notes on the bathroom mirror to make him smile, Draco who so neatly folded his clothes into his dresser, and Draco who was always so careful with Harry and their friendship.
“I don’t know when I’ll get to do that again,” Draco spoke sheepishly, cheeks tinging only slightly pink at the admission.
“I know Severus wouldn’t have put himself at risk for me, by bonding me to you just to simply buy me more time. I’ve been thinking about it all morning. You know we’ve spoken about this before, I don’t want to be angry anymore I like who I’ve become and in part I have you to thank for some of that. The hardest part about making this choice was leaving my mother behind, but I know she is too dedicated to my father to ever even consider leaving his side. But I know this is what she would want for me, I know I haven’t been able to speak with her, but I almost suspect she and Severus conspired together on bonding me to you this summer to protect me. I know he’ll take care of her, so I can take care of you Potter.” Draco knocked his shoulder against Harry’s half-smile on display.
“You’ll have to help me with the muggle money, Potter,” Draco said with the grin still intact. And Harry couldn’t help but think that the blonde looked sort of nice when he wasn’t being such a posh git, and then quickly shoved the thought back down into the deep recesses of his mind where he shoved all his thoughts about their mornings. One day he knew he’d be forced to face them, but that moment could wait.
Draco let out a little groan, and finally looked up to meet Harry’s gaze. “I, - I” he stuttered, closing his mouth a look of pure exasperation donning his features. That wouldn’t do, Harry thought to himself.
“I dream about him too,” Harry stated calmly, but heart beating fast.
Harry looked from Dumbledore, to Malfoy, to Snape, and then back to Dumbledore. Surely, the headmaster couldn’t be suggesting that he touch Malfoy, Malfoy would probably think touching him would burn his precious pureblood skin anyways, and what experience with bonding charms could Dumbledore possibly have, was he suggesting he’d been bonded to someone before, Harry thought snidely to himself.
Of course, she would approve of his identity crisis, that was never something he was worried about. But if he was being honest with himself, he knew that Draco had probably tormented Hermione the worst out of the three of them over the years. He and Draco had spoken about it at length, and Draco hadn’t disputed the charges against him. He knew that making amends was something Draco was keen to do, but it wouldn’t be easy. Not for him, and not for the people he needed to confront. Although, he knew out of everyone Hemione would be the most receptive, she was easily forgiving one of the things about her that made her so easy to love.
He knew that he was supposed to hate Potter on paper, but realistically his ‘hatred’ was mostly jealousy, which he had begrudgingly admitted to himself heartbreakingly about half-way through first term. When he first arrived at Hogwarts, Draco had just been so relieved to get away from home. He couldn’t even think about the manor without conjuring up horrifying images of torture and rage as Voldemort had made his childhood home a base for his rise back to power. Draco shuddered at the memories and began to break out into a cold sweat as he tried to shake the illustrations of fear and panic depicted in the eyes of those unlucky enough to meet the Dark Lord in the flesh. He wrapped his arms around himself, as he tried to calm down, a tactic he found himself using more frequently as the year wore on.
‘Mione,
” Draco bit out in a strangled groan, “
Harry eyed his hand for only a moment before lifting his lips into a half-smile and shaking Draco’s hand.
Harry had felt immensely anxious since Draco’s admission yesterday afternoon. It didn’t help matters that they hadn’t spoken or touched since, and the fact that it was barely the next morning meant that they’d hardly made it fourteen hours and Harry already felt as if he would lose it at any moment.
“Why didn’t you tell me the other night, the night we were talking about it?” Harry asked hesitantly, but Draco noted that he didn’t seem angry or upset, just curious.
I'm sorry! I know this one is a little rough, but I promise sunshine and rainbows will return!
With the distinctive twinkle in his eye, the headmaster addressed him, “I didn’t have to tell them anything Harry, I just gave them a necessary nudge in the right direction, and a gentle reminder of our agreement and they were keen to accept.” Harry was briefly reminded of the letter Dumbledore had sent his Aunt Petunia earlier that year that had convinced her to let him stay after he had almost been expelled and wondered if that was all it had taken this time around.
“Wait,” Draco laughed out, “wait,” he held Harry by the shoulders at arm’s length for fear of never finishing the conversation, and it taking far too long to continue his well-earned snogging session for a gift well given.
“Yeah,” Harry whispered back, half-smile perfectly in place.
“Honestly Potter, how you ever find anything clean in that wardrobe of yours is beyond me. Believe it or not, the floor is not a trash bin or a laundry basket.”
. The other part of him wanted to throw himself down at Draco’s pale feet and…
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy’s face donned a twisted-up look of misery as the rest poured out of him, “there were a few times where I was forced to take part in the torture, the first time I tried to resist and my own father was made to cruccio me, and so I learned to keep my head down and hope to avoid being chosen, but ultimately I had to do awful things to people, people I didn’t even know just to amuse him. Even more so because he knew I took no pleasure from it; I loathed every second of my participation.”
They traveled home in their contented silence hands pressed together on the bus ride back to privet drive, the whole while Harry was reveling in the best birthday he’d had in a very long time, if ever. And it was all thanks to one Draco Malfoy, and Harry was sure that the blonde would never cease to surprise him.
Gray met green, and Draco knew his own eyes were silently pleading, “I…”
Harry had yet to go down on Draco, and now that he was down on his knees in front of him, he hadn’t the slightest idea as to why. Especially as his eyes raked over Draco’s pale face, cheeks flushed, lips swollen red, and breathing ragged.
Harry watched as Remus took his place, interjecting his own thoughts on the Quidditch lineups this year, before turning back to face his curly haired friend with a small smile. He knew he was in for it.
Her gaze unknowingly, or perhaps knowingly on her part revealed that she could see right through him, as he’d already guessed she would. She tilted her head at him, as if to analyze him before choosing her response carefully.
“I thought it was strange also, I’d honestly figured that if anything I’d remain at the castle but hadn’t thought that far ahead until after the Weasley’s extended their invitation and it got me thinking,” Draco replied.
As Harry began to move and twist his hand up and around his hard length Draco found the will to move his hand from gripping the brunette’s shoulder to trail down his warm chest, to the button of his jeans. He wanted to make Harry feel the same way he was feeling right now, he wanted to make him feel just as reckless, and mad, and brilliant.
Harry was besotted, he couldn’t think of one sharp whited response. He was at Draco’s mercy he knew, though it was clear the blonde still hadn’t the slightest clue what he did to Harry’s resolve and that just wouldn’t do.
Realization dawned on Draco then, his face alight with it, “you mean about touching,” he spoke softly, timidly putting the words into the space between them. Potter nodded, urging Draco on.
Harry caressed the back of his fingers down Draco’s face to lightly cup his jaw, “hey,” he said softly to bring the blonde’s attention and eyes to his. “It’s okay. We’re fine now.” Draco gave him a half-smile and a soft nod in recognition closing his eyes and leaning into Harry’s space.
Draco’s anxiety and growing fondness for Potter made him bold, after all it had only been a few months ago that this had all began as a game of gazes built from an old childhood rivalry. It was with this thought that Draco built the courage to ask Potter the question that had been plaguing him since he had first challenged Draco to choose his escape.
And Harry had been right; she had tried to feed him the second he entered the kitchen. Always asking him to taste something, try a bite, take a nibble and who was he to deny her. She interrogated him on whether or not he and Harry had been well fed and taken care of at the Dursley’s, and he was left with the feeling that she did not take to kindly to them either. That made two of them at least.
“Is that so Potter?”
Harry grasped Draco’s face in his hands and drank in his expression. The blonde’s eyes were wide, cheeks tinted red, lips full, and his expression was soft as he reached up and wrapped his fingers around Harry’s wrists where he cradled the boy’s face.
“I do not have a lovesick face.” Harry let out what was meant to be an outraged sigh, but he knew deep down that Hermione was probably right, he could only imagine what his face looked like whilst he was off in a dreamland filled with pale skin, red lips, blonde hair, skin…
Potter had also dragged him to a muggle movie theatre as the brunette didn’t read and reasoned to Draco that it was only fair that he get to choose something to aid in their quest of avoiding their own inner monologues for the day. Draco found himself fascinated by the theatre, never having been before, as of course all things muggle related were banned in the Malfoy household. As they ate something called ‘popcorn’ and sat side by side staring up at the big screen Draco found that he was almost as interested in the movie as he was in how their knees kept bumping against one another’s.
Before Weasley or Granger could respond to Harry’s statement they were startled by a knock on their compartment.
Harry could sense that Draco was uneasy, and obviously couldn’t blame him. After getting to know the blonde that summer he knew that sometimes he needed to just let the other boy be alone with himself, with his thoughts.
He felt Harry squeeze his knee gently, “Hey,” and Draco could do nothing but comply with the pull to get lost in a forest of green.
Apparently, some sort of unspoken dialogue passed between them in that moment as the question was followed by a very abrupt and loud huff from Weasley.
“Hermione,” he said gently trying his best to pull her from the soliloquy that had continued on while he was lost in thought.
The room was filled with silence for a moment, and Draco so longed to be able to open up his eyes and pull the brunette snugly into his arms.
Harry began to let his eyes wander around the shop, he knew he was supposed to be engaged in conversation about broom sticks and this year’s Quidditch teams and, and, and…
Harry knew that both boys had a lot to face, that their relationship would never be easy, but he also knew that it would never be boring and that he had never wanted something to last so fiercely. Tomorrow they would have to face Ron and Hermione, then possibly Draco’s mum, then the rest of the wizarding world. However, he knew they had time, they didn’t have to rush, and that honestly none of it really mattered as much as holding the boy in his arms. They belonged to one another now, and Harry knew that he was more than okay with that, and the thought would always leave him aching and desperate for the silver haired boy who had once been his enemy.
Harry pulled Draco with him, and promptly pressed the blonde’s long, lean body flush against the back of the shed and eyed his lips before engulfing them with his own, doing his best to stifle a groan as their bodies connected.
Draco thought back to when he had awoken an hour ago, opening his eyes into the dark gaze of his potions' professor. Before he could even speak in an effort to convey his confusion, professor Snape had hushed him, “later,” he hissed out with an assertive nod in the direction of Potter bracketed in by Weasley and Granger. When he had turned back to face Severus again, he realized he had gone, only to return some twenty minutes later with the headmaster in tow. “With Draco awake, I’m sure it’s only a matter of time before Potter follows suit,” he heard the dark-haired man murmur to professor Dumbledore.
Also, so sorry for the length in posting! Work is terrible, I don't suggest it! lol.
Draco’s face was open as he took in his words, intrigued that Potter was openly acknowledging their game of glancing at one another, and he quirked his eyebrow in response to Potter’s almost question.
“You go in first, distract Mrs. Weasley for a moment and I’ll slip in and sneak upstairs. Then once I’ve gone, tell her you’d love nothing more than to help her with dinner after you’ve taken a shower.”
Draco looked over at him, Potters confession had made him feel a little more brave than before, his revelation about his Godfather and their similarities made Draco feel as if he was seen by him, really seen,  and speaking on impulse, high on the reality that Potter had trusted him first, he spoke.
Hope you enjoyed, as always I love all your comments!! <3
“I came here and met all of you, and I have to say I’m amazed Harry didn’t turn out to be as hateful as you lot. To be quite honest, you’re all lucky that Harry doesn’t hold a grudge against you for the way you’ve treated him his whole life. Luckily, he has someone like me who is only too happy to hold the grudge for him. You’re all terrible people, and if you knew me at all you’d know that’s a lot coming from me, trust me. Harry is incredible, and you’re missing out on that because you’re jealous, again something I would know first-hand.” Draco paused for a moment to clear his throat, and presumably catch his breath as it was clear he had unmistakably shocked himself with his own words, if his facial expressions were anything to go on.
Harry sighed, it wasn’t as if he wasn’t aware how bad the dreams could be, he had woken himself up in the night before with his own screams or been shaken violently awake by Uncle Vernon with threats of real murder if he didn’t shut up. Which reminded him that he was probably in for a vehement lecture when they went downstairs if Malfoy was right about the screaming last night. As Harry’s mind began to turn inwardly on a downward spiral on the evening’s spectacle, Harry was hit with the recollection that Malfoy had nightmares too.
And here we have it, a long Draco chapter! :) I hope you enjoyed...we're definitely getting somewhere with them now! I know I tagged this 'slow burn' but truthfully it won't be too slow, I get too exasperated with myself when writing them I can't help it!
Potter met his eyes, hesitating for only a moment before smiling back at him and replying, “nice to meet you Draco, I’m Harry,” and grasping Draco’s hand in a firm grip. As their hands met, the prickle of pleasure they’d experienced in the hospital wing at Hogwarts returned full force, jarring them both into silence again but not enough for them to let go.
Draco felt his anxiety quirk up, and not for the first time that day either. He knew assuredly that if Harry knew something he didn’t, that Draco would be the first to know.
Draco almost held his break as he watched Harry open up the box, timidly peer inside, and gently pull out the contents.
“No matter, this is the last year before we turn seventeen, and I expect you know that means we’ll be able to use magic outside of Hogwarts next summer. Harry may not, he’s too good, but I’m not above it. I suggest you spend this year working very astutely at learning to appreciate your nephew--you know the one you’ve used as a slave for the last sixteen years. Otherwise, you will undoubtably have to answer to me.”
He rolled them so that Harry’s back was flat against the mattress, and Draco was nestled between the boy’s thighs. He felt so incredibly tempted to roll his hips, giving both of their already hard lengths some desperately needed friction, but knew if he did it would be over as soon as it had begun, and he wanted Harry to remember this; he wanted to remember this.
“I know what you’re asking of me, I know what you want me to say. I just don’t know if I can.”
The instant the other boy sat beside him and their knees brushed Harry knew he was done for, acting on impulse as he always seemed to do, he launched himself at silver hair and onyx gray eyes, losing himself in an instant.
“Draco,” it wasn’t spoken by Harry, but by a very soft-spoken Hermione. Draco lifted his eyes to meet her expression and was met with one of concern. “What is it?” She asked, voice matching her gaze.
“Harry, - I’m, - I’m gonna come,” it was really all the encouragement Harry needed. He moved his remaining hand from Draco’s hip and tried to create some friction for his own strained prick as he keenly sucked Draco’s cock desperate to see him fall apart.
Draco returned the smile, discovering it difficult as always to resist the woman’s kindness and finding it infectious. “I do my best; can I help you with anything Mrs. Weasley?”
“Oh, shut up Malfoy!” Potter says with the full lipped grin he had graced Draco with only last night, “anyways, I was going to say I didn’t know reading could really be like that you know? But I really, really enjoyed it and I’m hoping you’re up to the challenge once I’m finished with this one, yeah?”
He watched as Granger startled a little, probably anxious she’d been caught out, before she glanced up at him with a look of reprieve before her lip quirked up at the corner with a semblance of a smile.
Posting as definitely given me the inspiration that I needed to keep writing and figure out where I wanted our boys to go! Thanks everyone for all the encouragement and feedback, couldn't have done it without you! <3
The boys often left the house early, Harry had quickly educated Draco on all the best ways to steer clear of the Dursley’s and dodge Dudley, after they’d completed their long list of manual labor of course, something Harry’d had to school the blonde in. Turns out Malfoy’s weren’t exactly proficient in the art of cooking or cleaning; shocker. The boys often trekked over to the park at the edge of the subdivision, or one of Harry’s other hideouts where they seldom spoke to one another, and usually were just content to sit beside each other lost inside their own minds. It was in these moments that Harry often wondered if they weren’t speaking because they were in fact content with just getting lost inside the thoughts they’d spent an entire term trying to hide from the ones who knew them best, or if it was because they were too afraid to face the mornings where they worked overtly hard to avoid eye contact.
Draco’d thrown himself down onto one of the sitting room sofas in an angsty huff some hours ago now, and he hadn’t been bothered to even attempt to yank himself back from the downward spiral he’d lodged himself in.
“Shhh, you have to be quiet,” he said with a little laugh as his fingers deftly unbuttoned Draco’s jeans earning him a whimper.
Just as their plan, and several back up plans came into place they were interrupted by the object of Draco’s affections, and subject of their conversation.
It was night four alone in the common room, well alone with Hermione and Ron, but bereft of Draco when he finally heard the other boy padding down the dormitory steps. Well, the sound of someone padding down the steps pulled Harry from his fourth night of sulking and he stared longingly at the stairs in the hopes that a lanky blonde would appear. When he did, Harry tried to keep his hammering heart in check as he watched Draco make his way over to him without making eye contact with Harry.
Harry had his arm up Draco’s shirt and he was grasping onto his shoulder as though his life depended on it, and the room was filled with little gasps, and keening sounds, and Draco never knew if the sounds belonged to him or Harry, he only knew that they were both guilty, not that he was complaining about it.
She looked back at him, shielding her face despite the fact that they both knew she’d been caught red handed.
Harry wasn’t sure how long they stood like that, Draco’s arms latched around him, and Harry’s palms cradling the blonde’s face, but it didn’t matter because a moment later they were both pulled from the revelry by a very strategic cough.
“Harry, dear, do take care of our Draco – and be sure to bring him home with you for the holidays, I won’t hear any disagreement on that.”
“Strange, I know,” he continued, “but there’s just something there, it’s kind of nice…” he trailed off again, cheeks reddening. “He was someone who was also caught up in family dynamics he couldn’t wield himself to, and he wanted an out, an escape, and he found it in the friendship he had with my dad.” Potter quickly cleared his throat ending that particular part of their conversation, not allowing Draco to speak on his commentary about his resemblance to his Godfather, and looked away before speaking again, but this time directed at the sheets of their cot. “What about you then, the dreams, I mean?”
“I love you,” Harry said softly moving to rest his forehead against Draco’s.
“Harry!” He blinked a few times, eyes wide as Hermione snapped her fingers in attempt to pull him back to reality. He really did need to get a grip.
Draco stood in the doorway of the kitchen, eyes wide, as Potter’s uncle started into him, while his very stoic and solid faced aunt teetered on the edge of approval and disapproval in regard to her husband’s actions.
Draco smiled, “I always knew I was brilliant; I just didn’t know you thought so too,” he replied cheekily. Harry let out a laugh at that, “I didn’t either, at least not until this summer.”
At the moment Harry was pretending to be immersed in a very heated quidditch debate involving the twins, Mr. Weasley, and of course Ron. All while avoiding knowing looks from Hermione who was chatting with Remus, or at least pretending to chat with Remus while sending him reproachful looks.
He didn’t really know how he felt about Malfoy; this was true. But not an indifferent indecision, on the contrary his indecision was born from confusion. The confusion born from the fact that Harry knew he was quite mad for Malfoy, just not what that meant for him. Harry always kind of knew he might be into blokes; he was just never really into dating in general. He had pretty much spent the better part of his youth too focused on eliminating evil incarnate to really focus on anything remotely romantic. Which is why he had never really had the time to face the idea that he might very well be gay, and at this point he might actually very well be gay for Malfoy.
The brunette simply nodded at him, lips parted breath coming in small pants, and eyes wide. Draco leaned down to capture his lips in another searing kiss, hands reckless across all the exposed flesh.
However, when Draco finally made it down to the Great Hall for breakfast Harry’s disheveled hair and bright eyes were nowhere to be found. He tried to resolve himself with the thought that at least he would see him that afternoon in charms class and undertook the rest of his day counting down until then. Although, when Flitwick began the lesson that afternoon Draco looked around the realization that Harry was not there making his stomach flip with anxiety. Surely, Harry wasn’t avoiding him. Even when Draco was immersed in the land of Monet’s beam, and morning swims he had made a point to not avoid Harry. Sure, part of that was due to his lack of restraint and desire to always be near Harry, okay all of it was due to that.
Please don’t tell Ron yet, it’s just…I know this will be even more difficult for him to take in, and I want him to hear it from me. Trust me I will write to him before I come to the burrow, otherwise it would probably be quite a shock. Could you imagine!?
Hermione quirked her eyebrow at him for a moment before they both threw their heads back in laughter. They came back down gasping and clutching their chests attempting to catch their breath before bursting into fits of laughter yet again.
“Yes,” Harry replied letting out a shaky laugh in the process, “merlin, yes. Draco, I thought I was going to come before you even got my pants off just looking at you, fuck.”
They finally leave Privet Drive which is bitter sweet for me, and also means were getting closer to the end!...I'm thinking this fic will end with roughly 25 chapters, but don't hold me to it!
If he was being honest, he didn’t even want to consider the thought. He wanted to believe that Hermione would never ask him to do something like that, especially since she definitely knew how he felt about Draco now. He also knew that he needed to be honest with himself and admit that there was the other possibility that she would tell him he was fucking mad and should probably consider checking himself into St. Mungos.
“You don’t want me to,” he spoke with an edge of hurt in his tone.
Or maybe, it wasn’t so much that he couldn’t face his parents, but that he was just scared. Draco squeezed his eyes shut at that thought. Fucking hell, he was scared, of course he was, weren’t they all at this point? Isn’t that why Severus went to all this trouble, because he was afraid, afraid for him at least. Draco felt sure that it took a great deal to scare Severus, which was obviously very telling.
Harry's birthday....although it's not over yet! <3
Harry was silent for a while, before he faced Dumbledore, finally looking up at the headmaster, “What does Ron mean I’m stuck with him all summer, how is that even possible?” Harry stated pretty calmly for someone who had recently been prone to immediate anger.
Harry slinked out of bed first, pulling on Draco’s hand, fingers linked together in order to get him to join him, knowing full well that whoever had apparated into the house would be waltzing through their bedroom door any moment.
Draco couldn’t help but return Harry’s words with a small smile, “Harry, it doesn’t matter to me how you identify yourself. Although, I know what you’re going through I spent the better part of last year trying to figure myself out before I could admit that I was very much gay. There’s no pressure for you, it doesn’t change who you are regardless, and besides, it doesn’t matter to me I don’t think how I feel about you is going to go away…I love you Harry.”
Harry eyed them both for a moment, and though Draco suspected he was on to them Harry said nothing about it.
“What is it Harry,” Draco murmured into the crook of his neck, his favorite place it seemed Harry mused to himself. Again, not that he was complaining. He nuzzled his head against Draco’s and kissed him on the cheek before straightening and holding up the letter.
Draco was pulled from his thoughts, however, when Potter finally looked at him, his wide eyes fiercely green, “about the bond, I mean.”
As warm fingers wrapped around his painfully hard prick, he couldn’t help but groan, and let his head fall back against the cot as his eyes squeezed shut. He Hardly wanted this to be over before it even really began.
Follow me on
Just a Draco chapter this time! I hope you all enjoyed it!
. Watching Harry drop to his knees in said tunnel and unravel him, green eyes locked on gray,
It was clear she could feel his gaze, and she glanced up locking eyes with him. He did his best to convey a sense of ‘not guilty,’ but it was clear he had been caught. He gave her a soft smile and went back to giving Harry the same fond stares she deemed Weasley worthy enough of.
