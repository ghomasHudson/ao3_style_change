"I… I can't sleep," he explained and watched Madam Pomfrey's face morph into absolute worry. "Not like that. Not like before. Just, like, sleepless. Restless, I mean. I feel restless."
"Maybe he was trying to win back Helena Ravenclaw's heart what with killing her all those years ago. It's been a rumor for centuries now so who knows how true it is."
"Okay, alright. I honestly do not understand how you get Os alone in Potions. This is proving hard."
Harry slapped himself in the face mentally. That is where Dumbledore and Snape were so obviously that is where the others would be. But Hermione did raise a good question as to who was then on Godric's portrait? Or was Godric really on the 10th floor? Who was the real Godric? And would the real Godric ever be found?
"Last week I did find Godric's portrait but it did not move," said Malfoy. "I talked to it, tried a few nonverbal spells that were within reason but nothing happened. I do believe that the portrait responds to either only you or Gryffindors."
She nodded. "He also informed me, privately, that you had asked questions regarding the dosage of the potion as well as the antidote."
There are some inaccuracies in the storyline/timeline with the books but for plot's sake (wink wink), let is slide. though it should come as no surprise i have timeline inaccuracies as im free flowing teehee [;
"He… he's different." Then he frowned as he truly heard Hermione's sentence. He looked at her defensively. "He isn't a Death Eater."
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "You expect me to believe you want to be an Auror after that performance? It looked like you'd rather swallow a whole bottle of Skele-Gro than become an Auror."
Harry leaned closer to Malfoy. “But the important thing is, like, why is he always in his lion form? Like, I thought there was a time limit on that or something?”
Ms Granger, yet none of them saw you take some for yourself. Professor Slughorn has assured Headmistress McGonagall that the Potions classroom, as well as the Potions cupboards and storage areas shall remain sealed as there was a breach of security, allegedly."
"Exceptions include Squibs but they're born without magic. And other dark magic exceptions, if we are to include the entire spectrum."
“Maybe we should try burning the painting with Muggle fire,” Hermione said. She was obviously a little upset she hadn’t thought of it before.
A slight glamor charm that Draco had taught him concealed his scar, made his eyes a shade darker and his hair a shade lighter. He really didn't want Draco to know he was here just yet. There were still things he wanted to be mad about and to have a row about, but this
“Yeh can keep ‘er,” Hagrid said as he watched Harry raise his hands to lift the small creature from his head. “She’d like bein’ out an’ about again.”
“And this one is for George… Check the tag, dear, I don’t know who it’s from. Oh! And this one is for little Teddy… Ginny, this one is yours, love…” Molly handed out presents through a system of floating presents to their proper owner. Harry watched in fascination as a small pile built up in front of everyone; Harry’s pile was stacked neatly next to Draco’s.
memories attached. I have to sleep in a bed and suffer through my nightmares and try not to wake my roommates because I don’t want that attention. Most days it’s hard to care about anything, even Quidditch. I don’t know what else to do. My entire life has been fighting You-Know-Who, and now that he’s gone… What am I supposed to do? I don’t know
The house resisted at first, undoing Harry’s work every time he left the room, but magic only lasts through so many sledgehammer blows. Walls were torn out by hand, forcefully opening up space. He wanted to feel like the walls weren’t closing in on him.
Harry had initiated the kiss first. It wasn’t the first time, but it felt more exciting than the first time. The same tingle Draco got when casting a spell shot through him when Harry slid his tongue into his mouth. This was new... and new should feel terrifying, but the change in pace, the change in rhythm, was what they needed right now. No more daily death reports, just each other. Here. Now.
“Do you want to hold him?” Harry stepped closer, like he fully intended to hand over the small child.
The repetitive lyrics blasted from the motorcycle’s radio as Harry and Draco raced too fast down the long, flat stretch of road. They’d received more bad news the night before, staring at the ceiling of yet another seedy motel. More of their classmates and friends had gone missing or died.
forced to fight for their lives! I was made a public enemy before I was barely an adult! I was tortured, often!” He showed her his fist again, the words
“It’s too bad you didn't take on your family’s company,” Nicholas said, quickly recovering. “If your father hadn’t married dirty, you just might have.”
in her house. Harry sighed, knowing this wasn’t going to go well. Narcissa stiffly dusted the ash from her clothes and then made direct eye contact with the two people standing in front of her.
By the time they were done with dinner, no one felt like moving to the living room to open presents, not immediately. Eventually, Teddy got tired of sitting and the low conversation. They all took that as their cue to move to the living room.
Draco only half listened, instead watching Harry with interest. When he smiled, his glasses rode up his nose as it crinkled. And when he laughed at the kids’ antics as they walked home with their parents, his eyes crinkled and he threw his head back a little. His hair was just a little too long, barely brushing the jacket’s collar, and it looked so soft, he wanted to touch it and
“Sirius liked to come down ‘ere and have tea. He always had a million questions, things ‘is parents would never ‘ave told ‘im. Always so curious…Yer more like yer godfather than yeh think,” Hagrid said with a small smile. Harry swallowed a lump that formed in his throat as he stared into the mug of tea in front of him. Very few people compared Harry and Sirius because they weren’t blood, but Harry had absorbed the best qualities of all of the Marauders. Hagrid seemed to understand that he needed that.
They walked up the stairs together before parting reluctantly in the hallway, saying their goodnights and going to their respective rooms. Draco made his way up the stairs slowly, trying to suppress a grin. Once in his room, he flopped onto his bed to stare at the ceiling in wonder, his heart and thoughts racing. He was dating Harry Potter. Harry Potter was dating him. They were a couple. His wildest dream had come true. All of those hearts in his notebooks weren’t entirely useless daydreams.
Turning to face forward, his cheeks warming, Draco pushed away those thoughts. He’d thought he was over this, over
“Harry Potter has caught the Snitch! Gryffindor has won the match!” Dennis’ voice was drowned out by the screams of the Gryffindor crowd. Harry landed amid the two teams, the Hufflepuffs shaking hands and congratulating Harry’s team on their win. Ginny ran up and jumped on Harry, yelling and kissing his cheeks before running off to celebrate. It was only the first win of the season, but it had been the first real game where there was nothing to stop them from only feeling the exhilaration of the game.
at the Weasleys’ in such a long time. He wasn’t sure what to do about sleeping arrangements or preparations or decorations… He went on and on until they reached the stoop.
“But we need to get a tree and decorate it, finish decorating the rest of the house, finish wrapping and stuffing stockings, and prepping food and…” Draco cut him off with another kiss and a mumbled, “Quit stressing.” Harry made a harrumph noise, but returned the kiss with a smile.
,” McGonagall whispered fervently before taking a long drink of her tea. The cup clattered back into the saucer as Harry and his friends stared at her. They shared confused looks before Neville, being the bravest of them, asked outright. “What
“Oh, well, if that’s all then,” he said with a small laugh. Comfortable leaning into each other, it took a few more minutes for Draco to break it. “What happened last night?” he asked. Harry sighed, trying to keep the memories of the horrid dream from coming forward.
“Harry, that battle was just the kids playing with different hexes and charms. No one was fighting,” Hermione explained. “The war is over and you’re safe.”
“You’ll find a way, I’m sure.” McGonagall peered over her glasses at him, a twinkle in her eye that reminded Harry painfully of Dumbledore. He briefly wondered if the twinkling eyes was a characteristic of Head of the school. “You’ve never been conventional and I nothing less from this class.” Harry gave her a small smile but quickly covered it by taking a long drink of his tea.
anyway! leave a comment (they make my day) and a kudos if you haven't already! i appreciate any and all feedback
Harry revved the engine and forced them to go even faster, to get even further away. He wouldn't think about it,
to be an Auror. But now? Things felt less black-and-white and he was unsure as to where he wanted to go and what he wanted to spend the rest of his life doing. He’d never been able to think this far ahead, only able to take it a year at a time, focus on the most recent death plot and hope to make it to the next year.
“Harry! Wait!” Draco called after his boyfriend who was currently walking as fast as he could away from the Manor. Did they think Harry was suddenly one of them because he and Draco were a thing? Did they just so happen to forget Harry defeated Voldemort at a very high personal cost? Did they forget Harry stood in that exact Manor three years ago, listening to his friend be tortured because she was muggleborn? He shook his head, trying to ignore the
“I don’t know what the next step is,” Draco said, each word with space between them, enough space for him to carefully choose the next word. “Do I give up my status? Disown my family? Go back like everything is fine?” When Draco turned to face Harry, he saw uncertainty in his light eyes. Immediately, Harry knew what they should do.
“Didn't your father’s family have a company? Hair products or something like that. After everything settled, I guess it would make sense to get back into the family business--”
, Draco thought to himself. It would be a perfect loft space for someone, with a little work. He’d ask Harry if he needed help with it during the hols. He’d never done things the muggle way before, but if it meant spending time with Harry…
“Please! Have mercy!” a girl’s voice cried out, blue sparks punctuating her words. Several more flashes of light bounced from the walls and a few more words were shouted across the melee. Harry stopped at a corner, laying his back flat against it as he listened. His wand was held tight against his chest, his breathing shallow. There were so many unknowns around that corner, but maybe he could figure it out if he stayed here for a little… He needed to come up with a plan and quickly.
A few sixth years stopped in surprise to see Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy disappear down into the dungeons before hurrying up the stairs. Oh this just
“And what will you do?” Harry asked quietly, even though he really wanted to ask what he would do without Draco. The idea of being with Draco sat weird in Harry’s chest. They’d only been together a few months, shared a few heated kisses and heavy handed make out sessions. They’d spent seven years or so hating on each other. And now… Harry might break if he had to say goodbye.
“I wouldn’t mind taking a ride around on your broom,” Malfoy said, his word slurring together but Harry had no issue understanding him.
Looking for anything to do, Draco stared out the window and Harry stared at Draco. Harry debated what he should say when he blurted, “Come over for Christmas.”
Draco moved towards the door, probably to get ready for the day, but Harry hesitated. He knew he needed to get ready. They did have a long day ahead of them… But the idea of being alone had suddenly become riddled with crippling anxiety. While Molly and Andi had often helped him through his nightmares and the horrible hours following, once they left, he was always alone.
A wedding on the worst day of their life seemed horribly appropriate. But when the world felt like it was ending, what else were you supposed to do?
on choosing the paint alone. After agonizing over paint chips for days, Andi asked why he hadn’t looked at magic paint.
“You don’t say Voldemort anymore.” Harry winced at the mention of his name and all the times he’d scolded Ron for reacting, in the same way, made him immediately sorry.
“He’s so much like Tonks… And add in the mischief Remus used to get up to, with you as his godfather? He’s bound to be almost as bad as Fred and George!” Andi commented, laughing. Harry’s heart panged at the remembered loss of Fred, but he smiled anyway. If Harry raised Teddy to be half as mischievous and brilliant as Fred was, he’ll have honored him well.
They took a few more moments to solidify which plays were the best before resuming play. Without ceremony, Harry kicked off again, flying higher for a better outlook. Dennis Creevey called out the plays as best he could and Harry often heard Ginny’s name called out. They scored a couple of goals, but mostly stayed on the defensive. Ginny and the others were playing aggressively, forcing the players to drop the Quaffle of their own accord. Stopping his search for the Snitch for a second, Harry watched Ginny’s ginger hair speed towards the Hufflepuff holding the Quaffle, feinting left at the last second which made him drop the ball in fear. Demelza quickly snatched it from under him and sped towards their Chaser.
Everyone else took this as their cue to start opening. They slowly worked their way up through the ranks, lots of exclamations of excitement and pure joy went up everytime a present was open. When it was Harry’s turn, he was a little excited to see what Draco had gotten him and had saved that for last.
Harry kept the pace slow and deliberate until Draco was panting underneath him. When Draco let out a small moan, Harry pulled away and grinned. It wasn’t a pure grin, it was the one he had when he was up to something a little more devious.
“If it doesn’t, then I’ll say I was wrong and we’ll get sloshed.” The laugh Draco let out made Harry smile. He pulled him closer, smiling at the light in Draco’s eyes. A tray floated past and Harry placed both of their half-empty glasses on it.
Practices were often windy, cold, and wet as October became November, but Harry pushed his team nonetheless. They were flying well together when they could get Hannah to focus long enough to block the Quaffle. Ginny could often be heard called Hannah “Ronald.” Despite her lack of finesse, she got the job done, and really, that was what Harry cared about.
“Are you sure about that? My money’s on Hufflepuff,” Ginny said as she plopped down next to Harry. Seamus laughed as Dean rolled his eyes and Harry gave her a mock glare. She leaned over and kissed his cheek, but Harry just squinted his eyes more. Nothing good came from Ginny’s sweetness.
“I have a job that requires my full attention during the day. Draco understands, so he doesn’t force me to go with him. And, to be honest, he knows those kinds of things bore me to death. When I get bored, the mischievous Marauder happens to make an appearance.” Harry lifts one shoulder like its no big deal, ignoring the slightly dirty joke he’d made. (It’s true in both meanings, but he
“I know, and I’m sorry.” He glanced briefly at his boyfriend before he started piling food onto his plate. It was evident that he was not offering any more information on his lack of communication with Draco for almost a month, or his lack of appearances anywhere except his Defense classes. And it didn’t seem like he was likely to.
fast. But Harry’s better than that. He slid to a stop barely a foot in front of me and he caught the Snitch. Then the bastard had the audacity to
History of Magic ended without any fireworks. Though Harry had enjoyed the time to daydream, he went to McGonagall to drop the class.
Now that the attention was on him, Andi asked, “What about for you, love?” with that motherly smile that made Harry’s heart ache.
Draco scoffed, turning his head away. “Again, I apologize for ruining your year.” His voice was stiff, his body held tightly.
It felt weird to celebrate something so happy on such a somber occasion. It hadn’t been planned. Not by any measure.
“I never thought about it like that,” he said honestly. The conversation came to a close and Draco watched Harry for a few more minutes, reveling in the quiet clatter of the dishes and Harry’s even breathing.
“The amount of times I’ve heard that…” He shook his head, remembering when every girl in the school seemed to want to go out with Local Pariah Harry Potter.
“Troll! In the dungeon! Thought you ought to know…” he yelled before slumping against his boyfriend who shoved him off, laughing. The eighth years cackled at the impression, but the rest of the Great Hall went up in furious whispers.
“Alright, alright!” Harry held his hands up in surrender, taking a swig from the firewhiskey bottle in his hand before starting his story again.
“Why did you call up the old DA room?” Neville asked, coming to stand beside him to look at his parents, smiling and happy and whole.
“Yes, Mother?” Draco intoned. He didn't bother to move from where Harry had him pressed against the wall. Narcissa stared openly. She wasn’t used to this kind of behavior from Draco, and it had more than stunned her. But just as quickly as she’d slipped up, her face was back into its mask. Her back stiffened and she cleared her throat daintily.
Despite all the incredible Christmases Harry had had with the Weasleys, this was by far the best Christmas he’d ever had, and he’d had it with
“Do you need a hand?” Draco asked as he made his way into the kitchen. Inside, Andi sat at the kitchen table with Teddy in his highchair next to her, peeling potatoes by herself. As she opened her mouth to respond, Molly and Fleur walked in from the meet-and-greet just outside the door. Draco could hear the rumble of Harry’s voice in the background as Fleur excitedly greeted Draco with a double-cheeked kiss. Molly hid any surprise at Draco being there well.
“Good to see you, mate,” Charlie said as he pulled the younger man into a hug. “Remind me to tell you about Norberta’s hatchlings, they’re a handful!” He ruffled Harry’s hair as he moved off to the side to allow the procession line to continue. As he walked into the dining room, Harry could see Percy standing against the back wall, looking vaguely uncomfortable.
“Good,” Harry said with a sigh of relief. “I have missed you, though. Hogwarts isn’t the same without you.”
He hadn’t meant to go so far into how he felt, but something about the mundane question angered him. How could everyone act like the war hadn’t happened? Like it was over and all the problems that came with it just instantly vanished with the death of Tom Riddle? He shook his head and mumbled an apology.
“Harry, don’t, you’ll--!” Draco whispered-yelled, his eyes darting to the...non-existent portrait of Mrs. Black. “What?”
“Anyway, when I got to the kitchen, Draco was having tea and cookies. Dunno why, never really asked. He tried to pick a fight with me after I’d had my lunch. But for Merlin’s sake, I’m tired of fighting, and I told him as much. Told him that if he wanted a fight, he’d have to look elsewhere. Then I didn’t see him again until after the Quidditch match where I caught the Snitch in front of him and bloody
But one Sunday afternoon in late April, rain kept the students inside for the day. Harry stowed the map in his pocket. He'd finally reached a corridor empty of his friends, so he stuck his hands in his pockets to meander down the window-filled corridor on the sixth floor. When the acrid smell of spellwork hit his nose and screams reached his ears, all of the breath seemed to leave his body. The light in the corridor seemed to darken, the oil lamps along the walls the only thing keeping the world from plunging into absolute darkness.
“For goodness’ sake, Harry! I live just a floo away and yet you insist on writing owls like we’re countries apart!” she reprimanded, dusting her Muggle clothes quickly before stepping into the house properly.
“The Defense class is… Not what I expected. Their education has been so sporadic, it’s hard to know where to start I’ve been running rudimentary classes for the last month, just trying to catch them up.” The fourth years had suffered through Barty Crouch, Jr., Umbridge, Snape, and Carrow, all of whom were
“I know your family isn’t… the greatest right now. So I want you to know that you can come stay at Grimmauld Place for the holidays, if you want. At least come over for Christmas dinner, if your family isn’t doing anything. Or… just come visit. Or something.”
this is a really shitty place to end, but i could go on forever about them talking and dancing around each other. this doesnt have a central plot at all.
“I-- I’m nervous, is all…” She picked at her gloves for a few seconds before sighing. “I know, it’s a lame excuse. I’ll try harder.” Harry knew she was ernest and genuine but he turned to Ginny, Dean, and Demelza anyway.
“Professor…” Harry said slowly. His eyes darted to the open Great Hall doors. Through them, Harry could see Draco’s silvery head among the sea of students. They really needed to talk… When McGonagall delicately cleared her throat in that way that demanded his attention, Harry snapped his eyes back to her stern face.
After his confrontation with Malfoy, there were a few awkward attempts at communication passing in the halls and many aborted ones at meals. The only successes came when Harry was on his own. Malfoy seemed to relax a little when Harry wasn’t around his friends. The friendly attempts made them uncomfortable, but Harry didn't mind them. Things needed to heal after the war. His relationship with Malfoy was one of them. They may never be friends, but they could at least be civil.
“Two pints of butterbeer and two shots of firewhiskey, if you please.” He handed her the coins and she set about pouring their drinks.

“I see you made the front page, Draco,” Molly smiled as she handed him and Andi a large bowl of carrots. He ducked his red face to focus intently on the carrots and peeler. She laid her hand on his shoulder, her whole demeanor radiating motherly warmth.
“I…” Harry hesitated. He swallowed, dropping his head to look at his shoes, and started again, “I wanted to apologize. For the way I acted earlier, and the way I’ve been acting since Christmas… It’s unfair to you, and it’s really unfair for me to act like you haven’t suffered too…” As much as Harry wanted to look at Draco, his shame refused to let him look up.
Laughter and the clanging of pots filtered in softly from the kitchen while they stayed wrapped up in their moment.  After a few somber moments, Ron turned to face Harry, smiling again.
Together they slowly stood and stretched the aches from sleeping on the floor off. Harry watched his boyfriend stretch, a slow grin spreading across his face. Draco was his
Wands clattered to the floor and young voices shrieked. Six first and second years scrambled to each other, looking at Harry with wide, fearful eyes. The couple of fourth years standing with them shared a knowing look before dashing off down the other end of the corridor. Owlishly, Harry blinked and looked around the corridor. Where were the Death Eaters? They couldn’t have heard him coming… He shook his head, trying to clear it. Get the kids to safety, then go after the Death Easters. Their safety was more important. These kids needed to get to the Great Hall, they shouldn’t even
Andi made her way in, humming quietly, headed to the small empty hearth at one end of the kitchen. She knelt down, tossing the kindling into the fire, arranging the logs on top. It had been raining for several days, and a chill had seeped into the house that they couldn’t seem to banish.
“I work in a muggle bookstore!” Harry said a little too loudly. Nicholas blinked owlishly at Harry, who swallowed awkwardly. He refused to look at Draco, although he knew he was wearing that exasperated
to get that woman out of his house. He often wrote Hermione for help, sending owls upon owls, until finally, Hermione showed up on their fire grate.
He wandered to the places that had huge impacts on his life. If he looked close enough, he could see the oil splatter from where he’d dropped a lantern in the Forbidden Section of the library. The one-eyed witch that had provided Harry an escape to Hogsmeade. The prefects’ bathroom. The troll painting. The stairs to the astronomy tower.
“Yeah, well, I felt like this scenario deserved a scene,” Harry snarked. When Hermione turned around, she had to bite her lip as Harry pouted.
“Can you get to your dorm okay?” Harry asked, taking a second to catch his breath. Towards the end of their trek, Malfoy had leaned more and more heavily against Harry and though he was wiry, he was not light by any definition of the word.
“Andi said to come on over and we’d start making dinner now, and by the time we’re done the cooking for everyone, hopefully, they’ll all be here. Then we can do presents!”
“You asked me to,” Harry said, shock coloring his voice. “I haven’t missed one yet. I wasn’t going to let a row get in between that. Plus, I was excited to see your exhibit.”
Molly pulled Harry into a tight hug that only a mother can give, already commenting that he needed to eat more and how good it was to see him again. Arthur gave Harry a hug as well, but he was a little more subdued than usual. Fred’s death had hit him hard.
“Gross,” Ginny said, throwing a piece of stray parchment at them. It bounced off Harry’s face. He didn’t even open his eyes to glare at her, and the paper landed in Draco’s lap.
The next day, Harry ran after Professor McGonagall to ask her about the Animagi transformation. She was walking between her class and the Great Hall and Harry had just happened to turn the corner right as she left her classroom. He called her name to get her attention and then ran to catch up, knowing she’d not take kindly to be shouted at.
A crack of thunder startled the two of them, the storm an unexpected visitor. One second, peace. The next, thunder and lightning loud enough to light up their bones. Harry raged with the storm until he collapsed in Draco's lap, sobs wracking his body, his grief sharp and bitter.
“Start paying more people like Arthur Weasley to look into how magic and muggle tech interacts. Arthur seems batshit crazy, but he understands muggle tech better than the rest of the Wizarding world. If his department had more people and more money, they might actually make some discoveries. And fashion! Merlin, the wizards’ fashion choices are horrible. I mean, you remember what Dumbledore wore all the time. I
And the attic was being turned into an apartment in between shopping trips and decorating evenings, which took up the rest of Harry and Draco’s free time. The walls had been cleaned and painted a lovely light blue. Fresh white paint had done up the trim and it was looking more and more liveable. New furniture had been moved in, and after Christmas, Harry intended to do all of the bathroom and kitchen work.
as of update: added about 700 words here! not much needed here in terms of editing, mostly clarification and some small details. I changed buckbeak's ride to the broomstick. it felt less awkward and more personal that way.
“Well, about how to become an Animagus. I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately, and it just seems right. I may not be certain about a lot right now, but this is one thing that feels sure.”
Harry excitedly asked for details about what the world was like, now that You-Know-Who was gone. (Ron didn’t comment on Harry’s lack of use of You-Know-Who’s name, and he didn’t intend to.) Instead, Ron told stories upon stories of the joke shop and Hermione’s parents and what it’s like not being in school anymore. Harry couldn’t help but feel a little pang of jealousy at the variety in Ron’s life. He had moved forward while Harry did the same things he’d done for seven years. Inwardly, Harry laughed at the idea of telling Ron that The Harry Potter was jealous of
, Draco thought to himself. The monster, like a dog, crawled under the table, giggling. Draco had gotten down on his hands and needs to chase the toddler around some more when he saw Teddy’s eyes widen before he was yanked from underneath the table.
“How could you?” she started, stepping closer. Harry immediately bristled. Draco didn’t know about the article yet. Hell, Harry hadn’t known until five minutes ago! “Even after everything that happened, I would think that you would still owl and tell me something like this. Instead I had to find out from
. Harry was pulled from his grief by a high pitched laugh following a green jet of light and a boy calling out, “Take him and go! It’s him!” Half-formed memories of his father standing up to face You-Know-Who flooded back to him.
When the train pulled out of the station, Draco turned to leave. It was hopeless to begin with. Harry was just looking for something to say and he said the first thing that came to his mind. Why would he want--
Hey! It's been a while! I was going through my WIPs and found this! Figured I'd try and finish it while I have the spoons.
“I was hoping to catch you being indecent so I could tell everyone, but instead I found you just being disgustingly cute and domestic. I can’t make a good story out of that!” She huffed but didn’t move.
Thankfully they had reached the castle entrance and Harry helped Malfoy through the door before stopping to lean against the wall.
at me.” Draco let out a laugh as he remembered his entire body turning red at that. Harry had been caught up in the moment, he thought it hadn’t meant anything at the time.
While Hogsmeade trips outside of the scheduled ones were forbidden for other students, the eighth years had a little more leeway. This was the first time Harry was using this privilege but he was glad it existed.
Harry leaned over, whispering in his ear, “It’s so you don’t have to beg to take a ride on my broomstick. We can ride together, now.” Draco laughed loudly, his face going pink. He continued to stare at it as if it were his firstborn, and so the family in the room simply moved onto the next person.
,” spit the figure as he sat up. Light fell on the sallow face and familiar gray eyes glared at him. They were dull now,  instead of the silver Harry remembered.
A part of Harry would miss teaching, which was odd to him because he remembered very clearly being against the idea. The looming Very Important Decision of what he would do after school was starting to get to Harry. Everyone expected him to be an Auror. Before the war, he
, he explained later). His mother did a double take at the sight, but shook her head. That was something to talk about later.
As he broke the cloud cover, Harry felt something inside him snap. He relaxed into the feeling of the magic wood beneath him, words pouring out of him into the emptiness surrounding him without much thought.
Harry knocked on McGonagall’s door later that night. Knots twisted in his stomach. Part of it was nerves. The other part was the fact that he’d been in McGonagall’s office only a handful of times, and most of them were because he was in trouble or had been involved in trouble of some kind.
wafted towards him. He remembered that he’d skipped lunch to try and convince the Room of Requirement to let him teach again.
In a halting, shaky voice, Harry read out, “We are a part of you until the very end.” His hands spasmed as he gripped the pillow. His fingers brushed over something on the back of the pillow. Curious, he turned it over to find four Gryffindor crests sewn onto the back of a soft black back. The shades of of the badges were varying, a prefect badge emblem sewn into one corner, Head Boy and Head Girl emblems are sewn into the other two.
Harry gave him a grateful smile because today, the students were full of questions about the War. He distracted as best he could. It wasn’t his most favorite topic of discussion, but Neville never seemed to mind it as much. The students dropped their games and gathered around the two student professors on the giant pillows.
Memories swallowed Harry and he hunkered over the broomstick, trying to ignore them. As if sensing his turmoil, the Firebolt sped up underneath him and dove into spirals and dips and lifts. As he soared through the clouds, Harry could feel his mind clear and his heart settle a little.
“Until we can get a solid potion going, they all need help any way they can get it. If it worked for Lupin, why can’t it work for them as well?”
Standing from her pile rather quickly, she fixed them with a glare that would make Molly proud before stalking off. Finally he rolled over to look at the man who was sharing his bed, leaning in to kiss him.
“And Harry… I’ll be there for you,” Draco said. Everyone smiled a little before going back to eating their lunch in relative silence.
Harry wanted to apologize to his boyfriend, but he wanted to do it with a clear head. So he urged the Firebolt to go a little faster, a little further. The biting wind and exhilaration of flight helped sweep the worst feelings from his mind. He didn’t know how far he had flown, or for how long, but he finally felt a weight lift off his chest and Harry took a deep breath. It hurt to breathe too deeply, like he’d been underwater for too long, but it helped remind him he was in the here and now. Alive.
“When have you ever done what you were told, Potter? I very distinctly remember your fifth year being composed of you doing exactly the opposite. Even in your first year, you decided the rules weren’t for you to follow. I don’t know why you’ve suddenly decided to go with people’s expectations. It certainly doesn’t run in your blood.”
“Think about it, Hermione. Last year, they had the Carrows. Now they have me, and despite how much I hate it, they view me as a hero. I’m teaching them how to protect themselves in the face of Dark Magic like what they faced last year.”
While Draco and Harry indulged in each other, the paintings across the hall were excitedly whispering. Draco’s speech was the most interesting thing to happen in almost a hundred years, and the current make out session was exciting to be sure. Most of the paintings had left the vicinity when Harry pulled Draco close.
“You’re reluctant to teach.” She wasn’t accusing him or asking him a question, it was simply a statement. Harry nodded, his face screwed up against everything welling up inside him.
,” Harry said to the Fat Lady, who inclined her head as she swung open. Harry walked into the fray of the party, ducking his head to evade notice. Once he’d escaped into his dorm, he grabbed his jacket, wallet, and Invisibility Cloak. The Cloak settled across his shoulders and made his way slowly back towards the portrait hole. Hermione turned her head as Harry slid past her, but she didn’t say a word, she just turned around and continued talking to Seamus and Dean.
“It’s a brilliant idea, Harry.” Neville nodded enthusiastically. Time stretched out between the three of them before Neville mentioned restarting the Duelling Club. “I think it’d be nice for everyone to let out some tension in a controlled manner,” Neville said. “And Harry, you could help out if you wanted.”
Conversation stuttered to a halt when Narcissa swept into the kitchen wearing Andi’s muggle clothes again. Molly gaped at Narcissa, Andi smiled, and Fleur looked mildly confused at the whole thing. Teddy laughed, banging his toy on his tray, unaware.
They hadn’t said those three words yet. It felt much too soon. With everything that had happened in the last year, it felt like too much. And yet…
Exams came and went. All of Harry’s students passed while Harry barely scraped by. The end of the semester came and went rapidly, with exams and outings and Quidditch. With everything happening so fast, Harry almost missed how seamlessly Draco fit into their group. Suddenly, one day, Harry couldn’t remember when he
Madam Pomfrey sighed, looking on at Malfoy and remembering when he was a little boy in First Year, came running into the Hospital Wing after a paper cut, swearing up and down that his father was going to hear about this. What she remembered was Malfoy's friends did not visit him, not once were they around. No one came.
He was constantly dreading the night time for it was when his body would normally go to sleep but his decidedly did not. At first, he dreaded the moment he headed off to the Gryffindor towers to call it a night because that was when his nightmares would flare up. Madam Pomfrey had kindly provided him with numerous bottles of the Dreamless Sleep Potion which had worked wonderfully as he had stopped having nightmares.
Hermione shook her head. "If you had finished your assignment, you would already have 50 reasons and simply need to find the remaining 15. You know you could ask Padma Patil."
, he ended in his mind. He did not want to admit that to Potter, something about it being very dear to his heart. It was true, however, as the last time he ever had peace in his life was when he was 14 years old.
"However, that only happens if you properly know how to read the cards, of course, otherwise they are harmless. But I shall not risk it as Divination is not a real
He went about gathering his ingredients for his veggie lasagna in the pantry to his far left, the vegetables, marinara sauce, lasagna noodles, and, oh sweet Merlin, do not forget the ricotta
Harry thought as he stared. There were pink and white Fizzing Whizzbees, Fudge flies, honey-colored toffees, multicolored Jelly Slugs, No-Melt Ice cream that was Ron's favorites, Pixie Puffs, Cauldron Cakes, peppermint cream that was shaped like the Hogwarts house animals, exploding bonbons, and Harry's favorite, chocolate frogs.
Her last statement left Harry in deep thoughts but those thoughts were crashed the moment his head hit the pillow and sleep enveloped him.
The eyes of a man whose soul had vanished. He knew those eyes, he had seen them in his Father before he was shipped off to Azkaban.
Harry's eyes widened at the comment and he vaguely wondered if Professor Slughorn knew about Salazar and Godric's legend. He knew a lot about the Horcruxes during his Sixth Year, he probably knew a lot about the original Head of his House.
Harry blinked and looked around him. Hermione was eyeing him worryingly while Ron had slowed down his chewing. "Sorry, what did you say?"
"Yeah, from embarrassment. I didn't want her as a partner. In fact, I'd take anybody else apart from her."
Harry scribbled down on his brownish parchment, the scribbling would be intense as if jotting down words and adverbs and adjectives before they disappeared from his brain and then slow down the next minute as if finding the right word, the right simile to make whatever he was writing perfect.
"Maybe try a different angle like the location of Salazar's grave. I found out that Godric was buried right here in Hogwarts."
This time Harry responded to her silent questions. "I did. For, like, the Potions assignment we got that class."
"As a matron, you often see a lot of interactions that go on in the hospital, not just here at Hogwarts but at St. Mungo's and Albus would often bring a friend of his who was constantly injured. Do you know of Gellert?"
Harry jolted. He looked over at her, calm demeanor looking back at him and his eyes drifted off to the floating tray of tea and cakes. He nodded after a moment.
His eyes drifted and slowly blinked diagonally to his left where Malfoy's Potions partner was Pansy Parkinson.
Malfoy smirked. "I learned a lot from Mother about it so everything Professor Sinistra teaches I know. It's a free pass for my NEWTS if I'm being honest. Like how DADA is for you."
His fork froze halfway to his mouth. In truth, he had not in fact been thinking about Ginny nor about Ginny
"I heard that Godric had requested to be buried with his best friend but, like, that never happened."
, Madam Pomfrey! I am sorry for not knowing the right amount of sleeping potion drops I was meant to—"
The sentence was left hanging in the air, waiting for it to land on the ground. Malfoy was pointedly looking beyond Harry's head at the glass painting of a Medieval Healer from the 1400s whilst Harry was staring intently at the green color on his robes.
"If it sheds light on what prompted Godric to change to his Animagus form, then yes, I will. I know for certain that his movement, about 200 years after his death, had something to do with—
Fat Friar popped out of the ground and floated. "Who knows. I never found out. I think Baron knows but mum's the word about that. It's a legend after all. A true one. Sad that nobody talks about it." The ghost spun around. "Must be the vagueness surrounding it."
"Deepest desire should not be confused with one's future, those two are different concepts," Hermione answered. "They appear to come true because your own magic was infused with the Tarot readings."
"Yes, Madam Pomfrey," Hermione agreed and Harry mumbled something or other under his breath. Hermione got the warning because Blaise and Luna had stayed well over three hours when the Matron had specifically instructed visitation was for one hour only.
"I am, like, extremely sad that he found me like that but I think it's best this way. All he'll do is ask about Ginny and convince me to get back together with her and like I don't want to."
Ron cursed under his breath before stabbing his fork into another fat, juicy sausage. "I haven't done none of that. I was busy writing my essay on Everlasting Elixirs."
Harry's lips slightly parted at the hand. He was transported back to First Year, on the train, when Malfoy offered his hand in friendship to which he rejected and here he was, offering, once more, his hand. His heart swelled inside of him and he willed himself to not cry, thank you very much.
Currently, he was on a pasta kick right now. He was finding plenty of ways to cook pasta such as Pasta Pomodoro, Garlic Mushroom pasta, Pesto pasta, Creamy Sweet Corn Pappardelle, and of course, the classic Spaghetti Bolognese and yet he was finding new ways to cook the dish. He had told neither Ron nor Hermione about it, most certainly not Ginny, as they would not understand. Cooking was decidedly a Muggle hobby and was even downgraded to mostly for home-based witches in the wizarding world. Also, imagining The Saviour preferring to cook homemade macaroni & cheese instead of fighting against the bad guys as an Auror would not be met well by the wizarding world in general. Nevermind what Rita Skeeter would even
Malfoy sharply turned to him. “May I remind you why this needs to be of utmost top secret? If it gets out that we are conspiring to solve an ancient legend that the castle barely talks about, it will end badly and I can kiss my chances of living the rest of my life freely goodbye as I will be spending a good odd sixty-six years in Azkaban.”
Malfoy startled, looking towards Slughorn helping a couple of Hufflepuff students, then back to Harry. "How do you know he asked Slughorn? And why him? Is he some sort of expert in dark magic?"
Harry inched closer to the portrait and noticed that the lion’s tale was moving slightly. “Does Godric talk?”
Harry opened his mouth to challenge him, deny it but Malfoy eyes bore deeply into his with a singular raised eyebrow that dared him to prove him wrong. Harry made an indignant noise and looked sightlessly before him.
Malfoy looked away again, gazing up at the effervescent stars. "How'd you manage to cast a Patronus?"
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiyaaaaaaaaa ! we're slowly developing the plot, lol, and i think draco was done dirty when not even jk rowling let him have a patronus & literally nobody else thought, 'hey! draco should be able to cast one!' so i did haha
"Since they were put as Arithmancy partners at the start of the term and have grown quite close," Hermione responded coolly. "Ron, you ought to start on your Arithmancy essay. It's nearly eight inches."
Harry hesitated, "You were quite old when you died. Um, you fell asleep in the staffroom fire and you died in your sleep. The next day you got up and continued teaching as if nothing happened but, like, as a ghost."
They fell into a lull of silence, each studying their respective subjects, and not even an hour in, Harry found himself daydreaming. First, it was the Slug Club supper party, wondering what Professor Slughorn had planned, then to the general idea of Horcruxes and briefly wondering who taught Professor Slughorn himself – was it Dumbledore that taught him? Or had he done his own research? Then his mind settled on the myth of Godric and Salazar. Did Fat Friar tell him everything he knew or was he hiding some information from him? If he did then Harry would have an incredibly long list of people to ask about the legend, and he suspected half the list would include the dead for their had more knowledge than the living.
Parmesan cheese. He added Parmesan cheese to everything it was honestly a crime that they did not have the product here in Hogwarts.
"But it's not true! McGonagall and Pomfrey know the truth. I also told them the truth, it wasn't you."
He never thought he would live in a world where his best friends made it to the bottom of his list when ominously asked who was allowed to visit him while in hospital. "Blaise, Luna, Malfoy, Fat Friar, and Hermione."
"Stop pestering him, Mione," Ron chipped in with his mouth full. "I'm sure we basically got the same talk from McGonagall about Auror Apprenticeship."
"The tale goes that those only of pure heart can cast a Patronus. Somehow it elucidates why my father couldn't cast one yet Snape could. It would always drive my father mad."
"…into a deathlike slumber." Harry startled into the present, finding the classroom dragging their seats behind them as they stood up and went about fetching ingredients, cauldrons, and other necessities.
Today he was experimenting by making lasagna. He had baked lasagna back in Fifth Year but that was the last time. He finally had the chance after having envisioned the best oven model in his mind to be incorporated into the Room of Requirement. Luckily it was, a large silver-grey oven ready for use.
"Of course it is! Slytherins are nothing if not loyal. Betrayal cuts deep to a Slytherin and the fact that the other founders betrayed his loyalty is enough to not want his portrait hung alongside theirs."
Harry got to, his legs shuffling before running out of the Charms classroom and running quickly to the—
"Where is he?" asked Harry looking frantically where he had last seen his Professor. He squinted into the air as if to catch a glimpse of his very, very pale ghost professor but the air was crystal clear.
Harry looked down at their Cauldron Cakes and he wanted nothing but to eat it. Malfoy seemed to be in a bitter mood for not having transformed the Cake before Hermione and he stared hard at it as if by the power of his eyes he could transform it to Hermione’s identical green cabbage.
"What on?" Harry briefly summarized the legend of Godric and Salazar for her. "That's fascinating! I, too, did not think that it was true, merely an ancient myth that was mistranslating in
"Would you like to be partners? You know, inter-House and all? We worked well together during the Yule Ball…"
him. The War had a way of dampening any romantic mood which was a huge wet blanket on their relationship and at some point, Harry felt as if he was in it just because. They had not quite broken up but they also were not quite dating.
Harry chuckled out of his own accord. "Hey, they were angry that they were being treated differently. A revolution had to happen."
He had been careful when opening it, his wand at the ready to protect himself against whatever was going to come out from the door but alas, no such thing came at him. Instead, as he walked into the room and the door quietly shutting behind him, he was met with a massive state-of-the-art kitchen.
Harry looked embarrassed. Such basic information would simply be found in a textbook. "Well, there seems to, like, not be much information regarding the founders' relationships."
"Don't even think about it, Mr Potter," she said and they were back on a formal basis. "You've only just woken up after three weeks, there is no way you'll be walking out of here for at least six days."
"Purebloods, or simply anyone really, spend a large insane amount of time on their readings, on holding onto their dreams so much that it becomes unhealthy because you cling onto empty wishes that were interpreted from a stupid card."
Blaise dramatically touched his chest and tilted his head. "My heart cracks every time I walk into Divination and you're not there."
Heading off to his mid-morning Potions class in the Dungeons, he wondered if he was forever doomed to not excel in this class. At first, he thought it was Snape that made him fail and look, he partially was as he set non-existent rules such as one had to always score an O in his class and if you were not a Slytherin you were basically doomed to fail (Hermione being the exemplary exception). But with the entrance of Professor Slughorn, he was still scrapping through the class. In their last quiz, he scored a P and that was after studying Hermione's simplified notes from First Year until Seventh Year.
Harry began to respond but his throat was dry and he let out a loud growl. In a flash, a glass of water was conjured by Madam Pomfrey and handed it to him gently. He drank the whole glass, unaware of how parched he had been feeling.
"Speaking of, as soon as you're out of the hospital, that's what we'll be doing. After hearing about your potion accident, Trelawney said we absolutely had to begin on our tarot card readings before anybody succumbed to The Force."
"Enough of this!" Hermione had reached her limit. She starkly pointed at Harry with her long index finger. "You go inform Ginny that you no longer want a relationship with her in a cordial manner." Then promptly pointed to her boyfriend. "And you need to come to terms with your best friend no longer in love with your baby sister." With that, she promptly packed her Charms homework and stormed off to the Girl dormitories.
"I'm not suggesting anyone else because that's literally everybody left. Everyone else already has a partner," and with that Hermione spun around in her chair and began her assignment with Luna.
Before lunch, he thought it would be a good idea of visit Rebeus Hagrid. He had not seen the loving tall man in a minute. On his walk from the Gryffindor Towers down the corridors, he bumped into Ginny.
Seeing as he could not attend Slug Club because he was uninvited and was avoiding his appointment with the Mind Healer, he headed off to Godric's portrait. He tried talking to the lion, attempting to catch its attention but it simply looked at him with wide brown eyes. Its tail would occasionally swish side to side and that was the only indication that the lion could hear him.
"The rest I manage," he answered. "Getting EE and A is not a fail to me and sometimes I don't care so much about getting P even if it's in, like, Arithmancy or Charms."
"This rarely happens," said Malfoy, making a right turn and jogging down the corridor. "Usually a wizard or witch will go their entire life without performing The Veil ritual as it seldom transpires. Rumor has it that some choose to come to Hogwarts simply because of Professor Binns." He came to the 4F classroom and pushed open the door. "To simply witness him understanding that he is dead and then perform the ritual."
"During Slughorn's Club, I did approach him to inquire about Salazar's portrait. He said that it had been commissioned but it was never hung. Anywhere."
Malfoy did not comment on the subject change and flipped open his textbook to page 458. "Do you know anything about sleeping potions in general?"
Harry held his gaze, deep green eyes boring into deep silver ones. "Remus is the one who taught me in, like, the Third Year. He said I needed to concentrate on a very happy memory."
“No buts, Harry. This is important. It’s only one meeting that I ask of you. If you do not like them then that is all well and good, you do not need to continue seeing them. If you do like them and feel that they can help you sort through your pain, Harry, then they will be more than happy to do so.”
Harry’s eyes widened and he shot down whatever was on her mind. “Get your mind out of the gutter, that is not what I meant.” He heavily sighed. “I’ll think about it.”
She had come to visit Harry, joyful at the prospect of seeing her best friend after three weeks of laying in the Hospital Wing after his overdose. However, at the threshold of the Hospital Wing door, she walked through but her boyfriend did not. Or rather, could not. It was as if an invisible barrier was preventing him from entering. Madam Pomfrey had met them both at the door explaining the new visitation system and concluded that Ronald would not be allowed to visit Harry… as per Harry's request.
Malfoy raised both eyebrows quizzingly. "Why would you not attend?" Then before Harry could respond, he answered his question with an eye roll, "I presume the great Saviour wants to continue saving lives."
By her tone, Harry knew that she knew that he was going to end his life that night on the Tower but the last line, the last phrase of his letter was the issue.
"You had had a Potions lesson that very day you drank the Draught and therefore concluded you sneaked some of the Potion for yourself. Everyone was questioned, including Mr Malfoy, Mr Weasley,
Ever since he was young, Harry loved cooking. From the moment he could walk, he was handed a spatula, pan, and apron and instructed to cook three square meals daily. Thereafter it never left his system. During his Hogwarts years, he would cook to ease his stress. During OWLS, he would cook up a storm at The Burrow and Molly going ahead and teaching him numerous cooking charms and spells that made a world of a difference. He tried, however, as much as possible to use the least amount of magic in cooking; there was something about Muggle cooking that made food taste better.
"You only have an hour," Madam Pomfrey instructed the following day at Harry's next guest, Hermione. "I will come in that hour to ensure you have left or simply kick you without a warning."
"You won't learn if you simply pass me the ingredients. Besides, what Potions partner would I be if you did not attain at least an EE at the end of it?"
"And the questions about the man who was under the sleeping potion's effects were also because you wanted to be sure?"
Malfoy shook his head. "He's far too anemic to simply keep the lesson. Honestly, this moment is so rare it happens in one out of 657 chances. Count yourself lucky, Potter."
, death was evading him. He could almost equate the situation to sexual tension between him and Death – if death was a person, that is.
"Right?" Harry agreed. "If I could see the lion's tail, like, move but not Fat Friar, that should say something right?"
“Oh.” Harry’s eyes wandered off to where a certain blond would normally sit during meals. He could almost see him, sat with his long fingers poking his fork into a juicy piece of duck, nodding his head at whatever Parkinson or Nott were chatting about. He cleared his throat. “You want to get back together?”
"But, like, Trelawney allowed Blaise to read our futures in class the other day and she seems fine."
That was the problem was it not? That because Harry was always surrounded by people, followed by hundreds of thousands of fans, adorned by millions of people wanting a glimpse of The Savior, that he was always caught talking to someone or other that it was easy to associate Harry as having lots of friends. But he often felt even more alone than the lonely nights he spent wandering the cold halls of Hogwarts during his insomnia-ridden days.
Harry looked down at his palm, raised his head to Malfoy with a million questions dancing on his face.
Professor Binns did not spare him a glance as he packed his sheets of parchment into his bag. "You can find the necessary information in your textbook, Mr Potter."
Malfoy narrowed his eyes but pressed no further. Instead, he asked, "What's your highest grade in a subject apart from DADA?"
"It is," Malfoy responded, diligently stirring clockwise. "He was unaware of the effects of overdosing on the potion as the drinker is meant to have simply between two to four drops, depending on the health of the drinker, but he had much more and he fell into the deathlike sleep until Joan Columbus invented the counterpotion."
He was reminded as he looked at his best friend calmly watching him of Dumbledore's words, of his many, many cryptic words that often made no sense. However, this time, they did. He once said that words were always a source of an inexhaustible source of magic, capable of inflicting and remedying injury. See it was often not magic itself but rather words that were more powerful.
floor. “I’ve been dead for so long I don’t think I can safely say I miss it. I don’t remember the feeling of sun on my skin, or the rain on my face.”
"He was an evil wizard, second only to Voldemort," she said and Harry's eyes widened in shock. "Of course he did not start that way but he ended up that way."
Harry was breathing heavily, still not looking at the Hogwarts Matron. He was seething but right now he had calmed down and a sense of tiredness was slowly overtaking his body.
Madam Pomfrey raised an eyebrow. "A forbidden friend of sorts?" Harry nodded, chewing on his cake. "Not particularly myself but perhaps Albus."
"Harry considers you his friend and as a Pureblood wizard that may not mean much because even friendship has a price. But you know Harry, everything in his life is simple--"
Harry swallowed. The heavy topic of Horcruxes was a lot to explain to Hermione and Ron at the time, and now explaining it do Malfoy would be heavier as he had to explain what Hermione and Ron already knew and a whole lot of Voldemort, too.
"Some things should not be relit like Harry and Ginny's relationship. Would it be fair to Harry to simply agree to date Ginny when he did not love her romantically? It would be fair to anybody."
Harry was impressed. That sounded positively amazing and he found himself angry that even Malfoy could figure out what do to with his life yet he had nothing.
There it was again, the softening of her eyes and her tone purely warm. It reminded him of a mother’s love and a wave of sadness washed over him.
Harry smiled up at him. “Obviously. You can go through walls and I cannot. By the way, does it hurt?”
“It’s so good to see everyone,” Arthur said. Smiling faces met him, but everyone waited with baited breath. “It’s been a long, hard year. Last Christmas was...empty and hard for everyone. We were scattered about the country, awaiting an inevitable battle. There are a lot of people missing from our lives now…” He paused, tears closing up his throat. Molly squeezed his hand as tears filled her eyes too. After he took a deep, steadying breath, he continued, “We lost a lot. But we’re all here now, together and safe. Happiness may still be a little ways off, but we’re together, and that’s the important part.”
. Harry, I spent the last year with Voldemort in my house.” Draco ignored the wince from Harry and barreled on. “What
Inside the locker rooms, his Firebolt sat in a locked case that only Harry had the password to. Harry discarded his robes in a messy pile, leaving only the thin muggle clothes he wore beneath them. The weather was freezing, it was January after all, but Harry didn’t care.
he could do it.” Anger bubbled to the surface as Draco thought about how Dumbledore had groomed Harry for exactly that.
The warm sun and damp breeze helped settle some of the pain that always seemed to dog him, and Draco’s hand in his always helped.
“You lot keep them busy, just long enough for me to catch the Snitch. Any additional goals for us are just a bonus.”
“I’ve charmed these glasses to filter out the worst of the image, so those of you who fought will have the choice of what you face. As for the rest of you, you should face what was done.” His voice hardened, not-so-subtly telling these people he has no mercy for them.
“It’s about time you recognized how brilliant of a player I am,” Harry said, standing a little taller.
hello! so if u ever pay any attention to the tags, youll notice i changed the main pairing. while writing the last chapter, i came to the realization that this isnt a hinny fic. while i adore hinny and believe its an amazing ship, i personally dont see it happening in this fic. in my opinion, very few relationships will last through the war. its simply just too much to return to that simple, childish love harry and ginny shared during their sixth and fifth years. but harry and draco have a lot of similar traumas they can bond over. i dont think this will become a relationship fic, i think i'll explore the relationship as it develops over the course of the story. itll probs be awkward dates in hogsmeade with The Gang and more silent nights in the kitchens. As for Ginny, i honestly dont feel like shes the settling down type.
Normally, they would’ve went their separate ways, back to their own beds. But tonight, Harry didn't want to be alone. After their customary brief kiss, Draco started to pull away to head for the dungeon. This time, Harry tightened his fingers around Draco’s, who shot him a curious look.
“I need help, Draco…” Harry’s voice was soft when he spoke up again. “The nightmares are worse, and things keep happening during the day… Sometimes it’s hard to remember where I am...” His voice trailed off and his shoulders slumped as he seemed to admit defeat. To admit weakness.
“What is it?” Draco responded equally as quiet. He walked back to Harry, feeling like this was a conversation to be had in close proximity. He stopped when they were close enough together Harry could see where Draco’s blue eyes became gray. Harry leaned into him, resting his head on his shoulder with his arms hanging at his side.
“Ah, Potter. Come sit down.” McGonagall waved him to the large chair on the other side of her desk. As he walked towards her, she shuffled the parchments she’d been grading away, folding them neatly with a wave of her wand.
“Yeah, it’s May 1st… or 2nd… Is it after midnight yet?” As he turned again, the sunlight peeking out between the clouds burned bright spots across his vision and he shook his head to clear them.
when I did. We went for a drink after and it was…nice.” Harry very obviously ignored watching Ron wiggle his eyebrows suggestively. This was hard enough to tell him without him making comments, verbally or otherwise.
look on his face. “I work in a muggle bookstore in downtown London. I don’t need to work for a living, but I like it. It’s cozy and calm, and after the war, that was nice.”
“Yes, you always made a quite a spectacle at school.” Harry could hear the smirk on Draco’s face, but the feeling of his boyfriend’s arms around him overwhelmed the need to make a sarcastic retort. They stood together on the bank of the lake for far too long, Draco holding Harry closely. When Harry moved to pull away, Draco’s arms held him in place for a second longer, just long enough to kiss the top of his head. There was only about an inch difference between the two of them, but enough of one that Draco put it to use.
“Mmm…” he responded, trying to remember what exactly they’d been talking about before they’d started this particular activity.
“I had no idea the work and sacrifice it would take to be married to Lucius, to raise Draco. There were many times I wondered if I would ever be enough for her. But having been through it all,” Narcissa said as she stepped forward, and to avoid falling to his death down the stairs, Harry took two steps down, avoiding the ice in Narcissa’s gaze. “I know this much: You? Will never be enough for my son.”
George gave him a hug and a weary smile before collapsing onto the couch in the living room. Harry made a note to ask how he really is later, but was a little more concerned about the lack of Ginny in the room. Ginny missing after this morning meant
“There’s a party in the common room!” Ginny yelled as she ran to the locker room, already pulling her outer robe off. Harry laughed and promised his friends to hurry so he, Hermione, Neville, and Luna could walk back to the castle together.
The morning sun rose slowly over the wide expanse before them, and Draco felt his heart soar a little. For the first time since they’d left, he felt… hopeful. He had Harry. Harry had him. If their world was ending, there’s no one else he’d want by his side.
“Quick, get to the Great Hall. McGonagall will figure out what to do with you,” Harry snapped. The kids picked up their wands, but didn't move from their spot in the hall. Turning away, he muttered, “And where is everybody…?”
Tears froze on his cheeks, but Harry couldn’t really feel them anyway. He hadn’t felt much of anything except the dull ache that lived where his heart used to in what felt like forever. Wanting the ache in his chest to ease, he forced the Firebolt higher, faster.
“I’m sorry,” he said softly, sinking to the floor across from the painting. There were footsteps at the end of the hall, but Harry didn't bother to look.
Across the pitch, Harry spotted the Hufflepuff Beater who hit the bludger grinning. He spun his Firebolt around sharply, already yelling out for Coote and Peakes to do their jobs better before speeding off around the pitch again. Any hint of the Snitch was now lost to the wind after his near miss. A smart play by the Beater, but still annoying.
. He congratulated Hannah on keeping her cool and helping them get their win, giving her a brief pat on her shoulder. She beamed at him and ran all the way back to the castle to owl her parents about the match.
“Enough about me, let’s hear more about the Chosen One. How’s Hogwarts?” Harry knew Ron was the most unsubtle person he knew, and he knew he wanted the dirt on Draco, but Harry was going to make him wait.
“We should get to class,” Harry said into Draco’s shoulder. “I’ve missed all of them for the last few days.”
Draco lifted his pint, his head tilted to the side as he thought. “No, you know, I don’t think he does. I have never seen that man wear pants…”
“Draco Lucius Malfoy!” Narcissa shouted, shocked. Draco stilled against Harry, who groaned in annoyance. His head dropped to Draco’s shoulder.
The walk was short, and filled with prattle from Harry. Evidently, he were hosting Christmas this year. Molly had looked relieved that she wasn’t going to have to fit that many people into her house and she wasn’t going to have to cook. But, it was his first Christmas
“Right then,” Harry said awkwardly, looking at the eager faces in front of him. He was still unsure how to act around children not much younger than himself, but they had a lesson to get to. “Well, if you’ll follow me.”
“Whatever punishment you think you deserve, I’m not going to give it to you. Suffer the consequences of your actions like the bloody rest of us, Malfoy. You don’t get forgiveness or whatever the hell it is you’re searching for by me beating you to a bloody pulp. Find a better way to make amends.” Harry walked out, shutting the portrait behind him. Malfoy may have been searching for retribution, but Harry wasn’t going to start that cycle of violence over again.
“Recently, things have been said I thought I could ignore by maintaining my old balance of turning the other cheek when there was something I disagreed with. I can turn my cheek when people speak against me. I’ve done it my whole life.” He paused, obviously waiting to draw these people in. The crowd shuffled closer, as if they were struggling to hear his perfectly projected voice. “But I refuse to do so when someone speaks against someone I love, especially when the perpetrator claims to love me.”
“Um,” Draco said, swallowing hard. He hadn’t realized Harry had started stepping closer to him, caught up in his stare, until he gently bumped against a wall. Looking around, Draco realized Harry had moved them into the opening of a nearby alley.
“It’s… just a complicated issue,” he said. “I mean… They are a bit ridiculous.” Draco snorted a little as he stared at them. Harry waited patiently to see if he was going to continue or change the subject.
“And that’s another score for Hufflepuff!” Dennis called out in its various iterations as more and more goals slipped past the Gryffindor Keeper. The Hufflepuffs were having a field day scoring, though Harry knew Ginny and Demelza were giving them a run for their money. Harry began to dread the staticky sound of Dennis inhaling to yell out another score for Hufflepuff because frustration was beginning to mount in Harry’s chest; the Snitch was nowhere in sight and they were close to losing as the Hufflepuff Chasers flew circles around Gryffindor’s newest Keeper.
to be normal, I don’t know what it means to be a teenager. I’ve always been a rebel, a fighter, a soldier. And now I don’t know what or who I am… So school sucks,” Harry said lamely at the end of his rant.
as of 3/4/19 this work has been updated! sidenote: i'm apparently playing around with style a bit more, so if you see weird things that feel a little like stream of consciousness,  then it's entirely what harry's think (apparently, i don't make the rules). anything in italics is draco's bc technically this is Harry's story. draco just takes over from time to time. (ironically, i'm not the only author to struggle with this)
Harry Potter, Malfoy?” Harry teased as they approached the castle doors. Draco scoffed, squeezing his hand gently. A few students had walked past them as they came closer and closer to the school. They turned to each other, whispering furiously about Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter holding hands, and you owe me five Galleons, Lucy.
The room seemed to hold its breath as Harry slowly peeled off the paper from the box. It was light, as if nothing was in it. The box beneath the shimmery paper was plain cardboard. Taking a deep breath, Harry pulled the lid off the box achingly slow to reveal a pillow.
“Are we having a row now?” Draco ended his question in a high pitch moan as Harry bit him sharply. Harry pushed himself closer, slotting his leg in between Draco’s.
“Fuck,” he said, scooping his bag off the floor and slinging it over his shoulder as he ran down the hall. He was
in her bone white hands, brandishing it like a collared child. The edges of the paper had started to wrinkle and Harry could see the ink smudging onto her hands.
“And George has hired several werewolves, helping them find places to stay, too,” Ron was saying when Harry tuned back in, taking a drink from the teacup Kreacher had brought in. “We’re trying to get access to the recipe for the Wolfsbane Potion as well. Once we have it, we’ll be able to brew it for the werewolves working with us and to hopefully make it widespread enough for others to afford it.”
“Hello Winky,” Harry said. “Is there any way I could get something to eat? I skipped lunch to prepare for a class…” He ducked his head with a sheepish grin while the house-elf looked at him sternly.
“Thank you all for coming. It’s an honor to introduce this year’s exhibit.” He gave a gracious, practiced smile to the crowd. Harry rolled his eyes, seeing right through his facade. “The past few years have tested us all. There was little time for such things as art and galas. Loyalties were tested. Families torn asunder. Duties were determined and acted upon, at times with disastrous results,” Draco started in his polite voice, the one Harry knew he used when he was up to something but didn't want anyone to know what was going on.
“I’ll draft a letter, and we’ll take it on the anniversary, yeah?” Harry said in a quiet voice. Neville nodded in agreement. Both of them drifted off into their own thoughts about the upcoming anniversary. It was the first he’d willingly thought about the anniversary. It was a little under a month away. There were preparations underway for some kind of ceremony, but Harry had explicitly asked to be left out of them. The idea that it was only a year later was surreal for Harry and it hurt too much to think about.
Lunch ended all too quickly, but Narcissa was reluctant to leave. So Andi invited her along with the rest of the family to finish Christmas dinner shopping before tomorrow.
“Lazy,” Draco mumbled affectionately, tickling Harry’s nose with a feather who absently swatted it away. He couldn’t see Draco’s small smile, but he knew it was there nonetheless.
“You want some tea?” Harry asked, unsure of what to do from here. Yes, they just did dishes, but what else was to be done with a guest in the house? It wasn’t even that late… Too early to go to bed.
“Definitely.” Harry laughed at Draco’s pout and hesitantly leaned in to kiss him. They leaned closer, a small smile on their faces.
When Draco still didn’t respond, his gray eyes blinking owlishly at Harry, he stood awkwardly to leave. As he shut the door, he cursed. Maybe he and Draco weren’t friends like he’d thought. Maybe they were just thrown together by circumstance and now they wouldn’t have to talk to each other. They used to hate each other, so this was familiar territory.
“We can and we will!” Ron said, storming out of the kitchen. Hermione stayed behind, knowing she wouldn’t be able to keep her composure while Ron kindly told Harry he had to get the hell out.
. When Harry’s lips met his, he moaned and immediately pulled Harry closer. He sank his hands into Harry’s hair and
safe now… I spent no time at the manor this summer… And everyone here makes it difficult to feel safe because they view me as
So instead, they shared lazy kisses and quiet laughter for a while after Ginny had so kindly woken them, but they stayed huddled in the blankets together. They knew they would be needed soon for cooking and socialization purposes, but for now they wanted to savor the quiet. Once it reached the point of possibly being considered hermits, they got up and ready. They took their own sweet time doing it, but around an hour and a half after Ginny had woken them up, they were finally presentable.
He sat at the low table in the kitchen, watching the house-elves run around to prepare Harry a plate. There was a scoff from the far end of the table and Harry’s wand was drawn before he could think, eyes locked on the slumped figure. He relaxed his arm a little, but he didn’t put away his wand when he recognized the figure at the other end of the table.
A portion of the old Dumbledore’s Army had come over for tea like they’d been doing once or twice a week since everyone had settled back into normal life when McGonagall had appeared on Grimmauld Place’s doorstep two weeks before classes started. She was desperate to find a new teacher for Defense, as everyone was still convinced the post was cursed.
fair warning: it's gonna get angsty really quick next chapter!! and it's gonna stay that way for a while. because for me, this fic is a way to express how fucking WRONG it was that CHILDREN fought a war because the adults were too afraid. and we get a lot of how harry is and isnt deal with his ptsd (and it leans to the "mostly isnt dealing" category).
“Potter, are you having second thoughts about this?” McGonagall’s tone softened a little and Harry felt like a first-year again, looking up at her.
The open window drew in cold air and someone’s delicate music, wrapping their hot bodies in a softness that wasn't reflected in their movements. Sharp gasps and long moans drowned out everything else, thoughts of war and death and failing governments.
The door creaked open and Harry saw Hermione and Neville peeking their heads in in the mirror in front of him.
“I told him off,” Harry said, staring at the bottle. He wanted to get pissed and do something reckless, he really did, but a voice in his head that sounded suspiciously like Professor McGonagall told him he best save that for the last resort. Tantrums could be thrown any day of the week.
Harry’s change in attitude hadn’t escaped Andi’s notice, and she and Draco often worried about it over tea. Andi tried not to tell Draco all of Harry’s secrets because there were some things best shared in the quiet hours of the morning and in hushed tones.
“Let’s get back before we both get sick. I really don’t want to explain to Madam Pomfrey how we got sick.” Harry started to pull away. Draco dried their clothes, warming them with a quick charm at the same time. As they walked towards the edge of the forest, Draco put an Umbrella Charm up so they could avoid getting soaked on their way back to the castle.
Harry and Draco stumbled into Grimmauld Place, thinking they were being sneaky. Of course, it was hard to be sneaky when they were stopping every few seconds to kiss again. Andi peeked around the corner of the kitchen as she heard the commotion by the door. She smiled softly as they stood in the hallway, the soft light coming from the hall upstairs filtering down just enough so she could see them kiss tenderly.
“Git…” Harry said, leaning back in for another kiss. Draco shivered as the cold of the rain finally started to seep into his clothes and Harry reluctantly pulled away.
“I’m sorry you found out this way, Draco.” Harry leaned into the shoulder not currently occupied by Teddy’s head and Draco wrapped his arm around Harry.
With a flick of his wand, Draco transfigured a rather large sofa from a fallen tree. Harry couldn’t help but roll his eyes at the overt display of his talent in Charms and Transfiguration. They settled onto the “couch” nonetheless, and Draco looked at Harry with steely solemn eyes. Their knees touched as they faced each other. Draco took Harry’s hands in his, settling them in his lap.
If Draco didn't know any better, he’d think Harry was avoiding him. He hadn’t talked to him on the train, once they’d settled back in, or anytime after. Draco worriedly asked after him, and his friends all wore the same worried look but told him they hadn’t seen him either. He’d even tried Hagrid’s hut, hoping Harry might just be escaping the castle, but he had no luck. All through the castle and Hogsmeade over their first week back, and no one but his Defense class had seen him.
“These kids look at me like I’m some hero. Like I wasn’t the same age as them, forfeiting everything they get to enjoy,
“You too, Professor.” The door shut behind him, and he knew he should return to his dorm and get some sleep. N.E.W.T.s were right around the corner, but now he was restless. He wandered out onto the grounds, trying to clear his head. The sun had just started to set as Harry ambled towards the lake. As he walked down, a memory floated to the surface.
“Sorry I haven’t Flooed in, or even written,” Harry said, looking sheepish. “Been a bit busy.” Which was an understatement, but Harry hoped Ron would at least hear him out, if not forgive him.
” he shouted, his hand reaching for the flying wand instinctively. The class gasped and clapped and Harry turned around, swallowing. “Now, er, catching the wand isn’t necessary for this exercise, it’s simply a habit… You want to focus on disarming your opponent, so focus on their wand, not them. The flick of your wrist should be sharp, but don’t focus too hard on it. It should feel natural.”
Harry, standing off to the side with a fussy Teddy, heard the witch behind the counter tell Andi, “You purchase one can, tell us how many you might need, and the can will fill with what you paid for as you need it.” So instead of a dozen cans of paint, Andi and Harry left with six cans of paint. (Thank Merlin for levitating spells.) They very carefully made it through the Floo.
Several stories later, Kreacher was informing them dinner was served. Harry picked up the now-awake Teddy from the pile of blocks surrounding him and carted him into the dining room. Everyone settled around the table and the chatter picked up almost seamlessly. Draco smiled sadly, wishing for the times when his family was like this. A family.
“Things are… starting to bleed together. It’s becoming harder and harder to remember that there isn’t a war going on still. It’s like my memories are bleeding out into my life… Running from Snatchers, waking up at dawn to keep moving... I catch myself setting up the protective spells around my room before I go to sleep.”
“They were a gift,” he hissed. Draco turned to leave the room, fuming. Of course Harry would have laughed at him for it. He’d never fully understood the Wizarding World. He’d never understood what it meant to be a Slytherin in the first place, to have it be a defining factor in
“That’s sweet,” Harry said without a trace of bitterness. It was the kind of story he expected his parents to have had, and it made his heart ache a little. Unfortunately, that was the end to any conversation. The conversation picked up in French again and Harry returned to forlornly making Christmas cookies with too many sprinkles.
Hagrid opened the door with a bright smile on his face. He invited Harry in and quickly set tea to boiling.
“Well… No, I wouldn’t think she would,” Andi said, after a moment’s contemplation. “She believed muggles were beneath her, and therefore anything they thought to do was beneath her.” There was a stillness in the room as everyone sat contemplating what that meant. Harry stared at the fire, thinking of everything he’d learned in his years at Hogwarts and the time he spent fighting away from Hogwarts.
The fire, contained very quickly after it had started, slowly sputtered out as the canvas and frame were reduced to ash.
“It won’t be easy, but I guess I’ll try.” He sounded melodramatic (and he called Harry the dramatic one) as per usual. But there was a challenge in his voice as well, and it made Harry smile. He needed that reminder after spending a long while thinking it was him against the world again.
Anger bubbled in Harry’s chest, much like it did when Aunt Marge had decided she could speak ill of Harry’s parents, who had sacrificed everything for him, for the chance that he might live. Unfortunately, he cannot inflate Draco’s relatives (he’d promised him), but he also couldn’t stand to listen to their talk.
“Thanks again for the pillow. It’s perfect.” Their lips met in yet another kiss of gratitude, but when they pulled away after several minutes, there was else to be said. Harry settled back into the couch, pulling Draco close to him as they stared into the fire. They drifted off together, curled against each other in their Molly Weasley sweaters, a pleasant fire in the background and snow falling softly outside. It was picturesque, and a little sappy, but Harry didn't want it to disappear.
After their first, rather awkward time having a pint (and several shots) together, Malfoy seemed to loosen up around Harry much more easily. Of course, they still
“It feels like everyone else has moved forward since the war, but I’m stuck. The memories won’t leave me alone, and I don’t remember what it’s like to not be a soldier anymore. To not always be thinking of plots to avoid death and how to get me and my friends out of messes and out of danger. I always look over my shoulder, thinking I see Death Eaters… Or when the fireworks went off this summer, I grabbed my wand, thinking I was back at the battle… Too many green sparks… Or that kid’s laugh is just an octave too high and it sounds just like him.”
“Didn’t Granger once say “Fear of the name only increases fear of the thing itself”?” Malfoy asked, perfectly imitating Hermione. Harry wanted to laugh at the perfection of his imitation, but talk of Voldemort left him a little cold.
is, “for anything in the world. It’s just… going to be a not fun situation. It also means you’re going to have to hangout with my friends. Which is both hilarious and terrifying.”
Her oil-paint eyes stared at him for a moment before opening her mouth to scream again but Harry looked her in the eyes with the sort of blankness and ferocity he’d developed in the war. His next words were even and measured, lacking the emotion from seconds earlier. Walburga was getting on his last nerve, and Ron had worn through most of those while they were camping.
“I’m glad you two are getting acquainted,” she said with a smile as the two trays settled onto the coffee table. Draco placed the small child on the floor as he sat on the couch next to Harry. Andi started asking Harry questions on how his first semester as an eighth-year went, and tea time went quickly. Before long, Teddy was curled up asleep on a pile of pillows and Andi was regaling stories of Teddy’s antics, of rebuilding and renovating Grimmauld Place, and of Hogwarts days past making them laugh until their sides hurt.
“I tried to warn you,” the painting said smugly. She turned and walked out of frame. Harry snorted. Draco muttered a curse.
“Harry came into the kitchen looking for lunch one day while I was escaping for a bit of tea and cookies. And I started my usual snide comments with him, but he didn’t respond. At all. And when I asked him why he didn’t fight me back, why he just
Harry offered a soft smile as he set the plate in front of Draco, then he kissed his forehead and sat across from him. They ate in relative silence, the music dancing around the room, the soft popping of the record player soothing the rough edges of their hearts a little.
“Hey,” Harry interrupted gently. “I wanted to tell you that I’m proud of you.” Ron flushed and grumbled “Thanks
“Uh, no. I only know English. I’m trying to learn Tamil, which--uh, my dad spoke. It’s really nice to see you guys like this, a big family.”
The train pulled into the station under late afternoon sunlight. Students streamed from the train, stretching and collecting cases and friends as they went. Harry and his friends were the last off, wanting to avoid any extra attention.
“Malfoy,” Harry said, exasperated. He allowed silence to lapse when Winky brought Harry warmed pumpkin juice and a full plate of food with promises of more should he want some. While Winky handed Harry his lunch, an elf Harry had never met brought Malfoy more tea and marzipan cookies. Malfoy openly stared at Harry as he dug into his plate. Malfoy might be offended by Harry’s lack of manners, but he was
this will probably update rapidly as i'm avoiding all my responsibilities at college, so stay tuned!
” were lost in the rush of eerie green fire. Harry sank back to the couch, staring at the remnants of the social tea Kreacher had put together.
“Harry… Whenever you feel like this, please come talk to me. I’ll help you remember, and I’ll help ground you to what’s happening right this moment,” Draco said, reaching for Harry’s hand. He swallowed the hurt when Harry jerked his hand away.
Draco had waited until almost everyone was gone, wanting to speak to Harry about his offer to visit/stay at the townhouse. He quickly grew disheartened as the station cleared of witches and wizards, and he had yet to catch sight of the Boy Who Lived or any of his friends.
as always, many thanks to my lovely irene who helped me out of a few tight spots here and there. and this time, thanks to emmi and maddi who helped with one scene in particular
“Teddy Remus Lupin-Tonks, you give that back right now!” Draco yelled, running after the giggling toddler who’d snatched a pair of his underwear after toppling over a laundry basket. Teddy had pulled them onto his head, liking the colors and texture of the silk boxers. The toddler was now scuttling around the first floor, having a blast with Draco’s pants on his head.
“Harry?” a familiar voice said. He spun on his heel, coming face to face with his friends. Dennis Creevey looked between the group of kids and Harry awkwardly, before turning to talk to them quietly. Only half listening, Harry heard him tell them to run along and that he’d talk to them later with promises of tea and biscuits.
. It was the first Christmas after the war. His first Christmas with Draco. Teddy’s first Christmas. Andi’s first without her daughter and Ted, the Weasleys’ without Fred, Harry’s without Remus and Sirius.
Another record popped and hissed under the antique stylus, the music barely noticeable in the wake of their sorrow.
When they got back to the motel, Harry could barely wait to get through the door before their mouths crashed together again. His worst fear, he realized as he worshipped Draco, was losing him. So, Harry made sure Draco knew just how much he loved him as the sun set the horizon ablaze, their radio crooning softly in the sweet morning air.
The last present was a long skinny wrapped box, with Harry’s chicken-scratch signature on the top. Draco was confused as he pulled off the very red and gold wrapping paper to reveal a plain box. He slowly edged the lid off, setting it down absently beside him as he stared at what was inside.
When they came to a stop, Harry took a shuddery breath as they turned to face each other. The warmth and progress they’d made together was gone from Draco’s face, the harsh, expressionless mask Harry was familiar with was back in place. It made Harry’s chest squeeze a little to know that he’d been the one to do that.
Andi and Narcissa descended the stairs, Andi looking like herself and Narcissa looking like Andi in acid washed jeans and a frumpy, brightly coloured sweatshirt. Narcissa tugged at it awkwardly before meeting her son’s eyes. It was strange seeing his mother in anything except the “proper” clothes. She looked like Mistress Malfoy then. Now, she looked like his mum.
Harry stopped walking. Draco just called out his family. In front of a bunch of well to do purebloods. At the Malfoys’ most important event of the year.
“Andi, is it possible that Walburga put protections on her painting against Muggle means?” he asked quietly over the din of dinner being served.
“Harry, can you help me with this?” Granger said from one end of the station. Draco spun around to see Harry putting Granger’s trunk on top of the Weasley’s trolley. With promises to see him at Christmas, she left with the redheads. Harry smiled as they left and headed towards the other exit. The exit next to Draco.
The second week of the semester found Draco a little despondent and lonely. Harry’s friends didn't mind having him around, but… It just wasn’t the same without Harry there. It felt more like they were tolerating him than enjoying his company. Still, Draco made a point to sit with them at meals. While it was awkward with them, he couldn’t imagine going back to sitting alone.
“You once told me it didn’t frighten you. Despite everything that had happened, you still felt at home here. Plus, it’s away from the castle, away from prying eyes.”
. “You can specify what day and time, too,” she said, which convinced Harry. Merlin, he loved magic.
Harry and Draco moved into the living room just off the main hallway, leaving their bags to be moved later. Draco gazed around him in amazement. The house looked so
There was the loud rushing of the fireplace in the living room as it lit up green. Not expecting any guests, Harry and Andi stepped into the living room only to see Narcissa Malfoy step from their fireplace. Andi blinked rapidly, like she couldn’t believe her little sister was
today. It’s a simple charm, and it can be very useful in a number of situations. Here, let me show you…” Harry turned and found one of the beat-up dummies standing against a wall, waiting for him to use. He moved it to stand opposite him, a piece of wood standing in for a wand clutched in its hand.
In a flash of movement, with the reflexes of a Seeker, Harry shoved her off the bed with his foot. She rolled off the bed and slid to the floor in an unceremonious heap with a loud squeal. Draco snorted, alerting Harry to the fact that he’d been awake the whole time.
. Her words echoed in his ears as he sank into the chair. Harry wanted to sink into the floor because
“Draco, love, open your presents now,” Narcissa said gently, pulling the two from their little bubble, and drawing attention back to them. Draco smiled a little sheepishly before looking at his own pile of presents. There were trinkets from Andi and his mother and a knitted sweater from Molly. (“It’s the least I can do, love,” she’d said as he thanked her and donned the sweater, much like Harry had done. It was a deep green, with a silver D knit into the front.)
“Always one for a good scene,” Hermione muttered. She turned away to keep Harry from seeing the smile on her face.
, once he got over the nerves. Harry, with his luck, ended up with another nervous Keeper that dropped the Quaffle more than she caught it. Unfortunately, Hannah was the best of the six that had come out.
Everyone at the table shared worried looks over Harry’s head, but didn’t comment. Hermione mouthed to leave him alone, and the other Gryffindors nodded. They remembered Harry in fifth year. and they really didn’t want to upset him anymore than he might already be. Draco had no issues, however, causing a scene with Harry.
“Outside, then,” Draco said surely. He went to grab Harry’s hand but hesitated, unsure if he was ready for physical contact. He didn’t have to wait long for confirmation. Harry’s long fingers quickly laced through his own, his grip tight. Draco started to lead Harry away when Hermione cleared her throat.
“Are you alright?” Draco asked in a low voice as he turned to Harry, leaning close. Concern was written deeply on his face as he searched Harry’s.
his parents were. It wasn’t until Harry looked down at his watch that he realized how long he’d been sat there. He raised his arms over his head, stretching. Fang snored loudly from his bed next to Hagrid’s, and the Bowtruckle had long since fallen asleep in Harry’s hair.
Fifteen students stared at him, blinking owlishly. “Er, now, pair up and settle the cushions around you. Try to disarm each other. I’ll walk through and help you as needed. On the count of three. One, two, three--” The acrid smell of magic filled the air as the spells went awry, causing books to fall and other objects to fly across the room.
“Why not? We have the one from fifth year, I think we should have one now too. Our parents never got a second photo...” Harry knew he was right and that thought made his heart squeeze a little too tightly. He nodded, turning to face Neville once he was done organizing.
Two weeks had been too long. In the last year, they had spent a large portion of it making out on the couch of whoever’s apartment they happened to be crashing in that day. Two weeks apart because of a row was awful, and he wanted to make sure it never happened again.
His friends didn’t say a word as he approached their small group. It was like they didn’t want to startle him away. Ignoring them, he dragged his eyes to Draco. The Slytherin’s shoulders tensed as Harry moved closer, but he was pointedly staring at the book in his hands. Harry knew Draco wasn’t going to turn around, he was too proud for that.
That night, they settled into an old abandoned house in the middle of nowhere, isolated from the rest of town. The door on the old wooden cabin creaked open to reveal a well-loved interior. A worn leather chair sat in the corner, the floral couch worn in one spot more than the others, close to the leather chair. Blue flower curtains fluttered with the breeze the boys had introduced, sending dust swirling across the floor.
“Don’t leave me alone just yet, okay?” Harry mumbled into his shoulder. Draco smiled, wrapping his arms around Harry and hugging him close. Draco relaxed into the hug, relieved Harry had asked him to stay. He didn't want to be alone just yet either.
“What’s going on?” Harry asked, looking at the new Keeper. He tried to keep his frustration buried as much as possible. It was her first game, but she was going to cost it to them if she didn't try harder.
Draco found him in the library staring intently at some pamphlets that McGonagall had handed him earlier in the week, thinking exactly that. Draco could almost see the headache forming in Harry’s head as he stared at the flimsy pieces of paper.
And with that, everyone wiped tears away and started digging in. Laughter quickly filled the room. Plates were passed around, bottles floating around to be poured as asked, some pieces of food flung from Ginny towards whoever she felt like deserved it at any given moment. (Harry ended up blocking a lot of the food over the course of dinner.)
“Hey,” he said softly, grabbing Draco’s arm before he left. Reluctantly, he turned to face Harry again. “I didn’t mean to offend you. It
“Thank you, Hagrid. This means a lot to me,” Harry said as he stood slowly, so as not to disturb to sleeping twig.
When a student further in the back opened his mouth to obviously ask about the war again, Neville stopped him with a look that McGonagall would be proud of.
“If you wanted to go on a date, Potter, all you had to do was ask,” Malfoy snarked from the door. Harry startled, unaware he’d been talking out loud. He turned to see Malfoy standing in the open portrait door. His cheeks were red from the chill outside, and he looked more tired than usual.
The fire steadily ate up the kindling. Once it ate the kindling, it licked at the canvas before devouring it almost instantly. Apparently, magic paintings were
“Yeah, but I couldn’t use the mirror. We were having a row… It would defeat the point of having a row if I’d called you.”
There was a large main room, big enough for a couch and maybe a chair, a TV, and a desk. There was a smaller room just off to the side that could be a small kitchen, a bathroom, and the largest room could be a bedroom…
Despite Harry and Andi’s attempts to cheer the stuffy estate, one piece of furniture left a lot to be desired.
Harry, ever restless, stood and quietly walked from the compartment. He made sure the latch didn't make a sound as he made to walk down the hallway. He didn’t have a destination, he just needed to
Together, they made their way from the Great Hall. Draco was staring straight forward, his chin tilted up in that “I’m better than you” way Harry was used to. Harry, on the other hand, kept sneaking glances at Draco. He was trying to gauge how upset Draco might be and what Harry might have to do to apologize and make it up to him. They walked towards a small grove of trees near the edge of the lake, and Harry hated the gap between them.
It wasn’t until Harry was almost out the door that Hagrid said, “Stop by anytime, Harry. Even after yeh leave Hogwarts. I’m always willin’ to share stories.”
“That was a bloody good match, Harry,” Neville said, thumping Harry on the back. Luna smiled at Harry and said, “Quite a catch, Harry.”
Ron slowly stood, laying Harry down slowly to lay on the couch. He had started to drift to sleep, murmuring questions that Ron didn't have the ability to answer, and it was best to let him sleep this off. If he still wanted to, he could wreak havoc in the morning.
Almost immediately after the glasses clinked onto the tray, Harry yanked Draco closer to him. Their lips crashed together in a messy and brash way Draco had come to love and crave. He threw his arms around Harry’s neck, revelling in the feeling of Harry’s hands clutching his hips. When Harry’s hands ran through his perfect hair, he couldn’t find it in himself to give a fuck.
Their glamours slipped when they thought they were safe in the dark, and really, who cares if someone saw? What better way to start off Christmas than with a front page picture of Harry with his hands up Draco’s shirt and Draco’s hands gripping his hair as he received a hickey?
“It’s weird, isn’t it?” she said quietly into the silence. Harry looked at her with wide eyes. Luna believed in a lot of strange things, but nothing was ever
“Oh Fiendfyre couldn’t ruin charms as old as those, Harry,” Luna said with a faint laugh dancing through her words as if Harry were being silly. “Horcruxes, yes. But charms as ancient and powerful as those?” She shook her head with a smile. Harry looked at her, frustrated. Of course, it seemed simple to her. She was
Without ceremony, Harry burst through the door, startling Draco into shouting. Harry forgot for a moment why he’d run in while Draco’s exclamation registered.
“Just ride it out. Something else will catch their eye soon and they’ll be distracted again. Like fish.”
As he came to rest in front of the stands, a little above them so as not to block their view, a Bludger whizzed past Harry’s ear. He was forced to jerk upward, raising several feet rapidly to avoid a Bludger to the head. The crowd screamed and ducked as the Bludger soared over their heads. It swerved rapidly back towards the pitch, safely over everyone’s heads this time, before one of the Hufflepuff Beaters swung towards Ginny. Luckily, so was too fast for it.
Discussions of papers and assignments and futures drowned out some of the Quidditch talk, and it gave Harry time to just exist contentedly before the match got underway. Once everyone had eaten their fill, Harry called the team to head towards the pitch. The laughter and camaraderie in the small locker room warmed Harry against the November chill.
He thought about what Luna said for a long time, staring at the wall where a door should have been until he remembered he had a class to teach that afternoon.
“Oh, I was in various common rooms throughout my time at Hogwarts for a lot of reasons. They’re not very well protected.” Everyone laughed in disbelief, but not surprise. Knowing his parents and other relatives, it’s really no surprise that he ended up in as much trouble as he did.
Harry readjusted his suit again as he made his way up to the giant museum. It was an old castle full of old art Harry could only vaguely appreciate, but this was the annual Malfoy charity gala and he had promised to go. Fight or not, this was important to Draco, so he would go.
“Well… Yeah. But, I was raised as a muggle and did dishes often because of my aunt and uncle. Even though they forced me to do chores and things, there’s something cathartic about doing things for yourself, like Muggles do. It’s so much better than doing it with your wand.” He smiled at Draco, who nodded only half knowingly. Things were always done
They parted ways and Harry carried his sleeping godson up to his room. As he laid him in the crib, his heart squeezed as he thought about how his parents must have felt about him. Such a tiny human being, not in his life for very long, but who meant everything to Harry. He understood why his parents stood against You-Know-Who instead of running again. Harry would stand against You-Know-Who again if it meant keeping Teddy safe.
“I never asked you to.” Harry rolled his eyes at Malfoy, taking a long drink from his goblet. Harry politely asked for a plate of seconds, and then thirds, all while still ignoring Malfoy, who couldn’t seem to stop staring.
“Stop that right now.” The look of shock on Harry’s face was Draco’s opening, and he took it. “I know you think you have to do everything alone, but that’s not how friends and families work. You have wonderful people who give a lot of fucks about how you do in life, especially emotionally. By not letting anyone in, you’re just making things worse. It doesn’t even have to be me that you talk to, Harry. Just share your burden. Please.”
Tonks laughing. The toddler was tugging on Harry’s shirt, making the grabby hands for up. Rolling his eyes, Harry picked him up to settle him on his hip. Teddy screeched his approval, his hair flashing pink momentarily.
“Draco… It’s not a bad thing. I wouldn’t trade you and this,” he gestured between them, unable to fully define what
“I’m fine, I was just trying to be sweet but you had to go knocking our heads together,” Harry snarked. Draco visibly relaxed and leaned into Harry again.
“We have a long day tomorrow,” he whispered, refusing to break the soft spell that seemed to fill the hallway.
The rest of the afternoon passed like this. Veterans beneath the tree working on essays or grading, bickering, criticizing Harry’s form. It was normal, and they liked it that way.
In a flash, Harry and Hermione were gathering kindling and matches before running to the painting in the front hall. Hermione shoved the kindling between the frame and canvas, trying to get as much in as possible. When she finished, she backed up and looked at Harry.
“Does Draco eat with you guys?” When Harry looked up at his best mate, there was a glint in his eye that was
“Bill getting scratched was kind of a realization. I kind of knew what Lupin went through, but now I
“Just let me know if there’s anything I can do,” Draco said, squeezing Harry’s hand again. Harry squeezed back. Teddy squealed, then, smacking his high chair tray with enthusiasm. Mashed potatoes went flying as Andi scolded him, hastily cleaning up the spattered potatoes while Molly simply laughed. Stories of the chaos children caused started up and carried them through the rest of the dinner.
“Do you speak French?” Nicholas, Lucius’ brother, asked Harry, effectively putting the conversation on hold.
“Understand that this is temporary, but I’m asking you five to take over. We can designate classes and you lot can rotate, but I am at wit’s end trying to find a new professor.”
“I don’t want to be alone tonight,” he whispered. Draco nodded in response, pulling him closer for another, deeper kiss.
The war was ongoing. They couldn’t stop it. Almost all of their friends and family were dead. What else could they do?
Today was one of those days when Neville knocked on the ornate door. The door was never closed, really. Harry allowed other students and professors to wander through as they wanted. It made him feel less pressured to take up every single minute of the students’ time and allowed others to satisfy their curiosity at the Boy Who Lived teaching Defense. Neville’s class had let out early, so he joined in on the games.
“Well, after the first class in the D.A. room, I went to see Winky because I had forgone lunch to prepare. The Room was being testy. I wanted to make sure it opened reliably and without attitude. Not easy, by the way. It was still testy after the Fiendfyre.” Ron nodded sagely, remembering how the fyre tore through the room, leaving nothing in its wake.
“I thought I was finally through with people talking behind my back at school, but this is gonna be worse than anything I went through the first six years…” Draco made a breathy noise, trying to hide the hurt. “I’m never gonna hear the end of this from the team… And Ron is gonna gloat that he was right all this time, and
“I miss him, Andi… And I want to make him proud...” he said in a quiet voice. Tears fell down his face, tears he doesn’t remember if he shed when Sirius died.
The higher he went, the grief lessened and regret seeped in. He knew he’d been harsh with Draco… And they’d left things so badly. Harry knew that Draco had also suffered during the war, but he hadn’t been drafted from the age of one to be the Wizarding World’s saviour! Not even Harry’s closest friends understood what that meant. Because of him, they’d suffered too much… Everyone had…
Of course, with the holidays meant figuring out where to spend them, which Harry had been putting off for a long time anyway. Too many things and not enough brain cells to deal with them at once.
“After I stormed out dramatically and walked down their driveway, Draco tried to defend his mother, and then I yelled at him and then stormed off dramatically and Disapparated.”
“Mum, what the hell--” he started, confusion written in every muscle of his body. His eyes flicked around the room before settling on Harry for an explanation. If it was
“They met at Hogwarts,” Draco said. He could have made it sound like a “duh” statement, but he didn't. He just spun the story. “Mum was hexing an ex-boyfriend’s room and Dad just happened to walk past. She roped him into standing guard while she finished charming his clothes to dye his skin purple ever-so-slowly.”
“Well, dear, I’ve been married to a Muggle-born for a long time… And he taught me to appreciate doing things for yourself like the Muggles do. There’s just something about setting up a fire yourself, watching the match spark and catch on the logs. It’s so much better than doing it with your wand.” She smiled sadly at the memory of Ted, and Harry moved closer with Teddy. Andi stood as the fire finally caught and took Teddy from Harry’s arms before settling herself next to Hermione at the table. Harry looked down at the fire, deep in thought.
“Well, we do need someone to chop the potatoes,” Molly said, breaking the tension. Her tone was conversational, as if this were normal. “Here. Sit at the table and I’ll get you a knife and a cutting board.” She called the items from the cabinets, setting them gracefully in front of Narcissa once they were in hand. Once Andi had showed her the best way to chop the potatoes, Narcissa began to slowly make her way through the sizeable mound in front of her.
They stayed like this for hours, not speaking much. Dinner came around and Harry’s stomach growls loudly. He grinned at the loud disruption and the disgruntled look his boyfriend gave him. Draco rolled his eyes, sending the books back with another flick of his wand. They left together, Draco’s arm around Harry’s shoulder, Harry leaning into Draco’s warmth.
“I want to be with him,” he said, that whine still in his voice. The more he drank, the more pronounced it became. “But if he’s going to be an
!” Obviously, Harry had that kicked puppy look. Ron was usually useless against it, but he’d had enough.
Time was hard to keep track of in this quasi forest, but Draco knew it was a long time by the way his body started to ache from sitting on the log. Harry’s sobs slowly eased off, and now there was just the quiet sound of his ragged breath and the eerie wind that seemed to blow through the false trees. After centuries of waiting, Harry slowly started to speak.
As people left, Kreacher started to clear the table, but Harry kindly told him that he had the night off and was welcome to join them if he wished. Harry and company could clean up the dishes later. Kreacher bowed and thanked Harry in a croaky voice before disappearing, probably back his room.
“Will it work?” Draco asked in a small voice, fiddling with the ring on his finger. Harry ran his hand along Draco’s cheek, looking at him earnestly. Draco’s family may not be the greatest in the world, but Harry never doubted that they loved their son, not once.
After a brief conversation with Dennis Creevey, Harry started to head back to his compartment. But as he turned, he caught sight of a silvery blonde head. Draco was sitting in a compartment all by himself, occupied by a book in his hands. Harry smiled and slid the door open.
The morning before the match, Harry and Hermione were sitting at the Gryffindor table eating breakfast. Harry was picking at his food, reluctant to eat before his match like he had been so many times before. The match was set to begin before lunch, so the Great Hall was mostly empty.
“Draco, lovely to see you,” Narcissa said as she stood to kiss her son’s cheeks. When she pulled back, she gave Harry a slight nod, but at this point, he’d take a hex. It would be the most she’d said to him ever. Draco introduced him to the family he didn’t know and then Harry awkwardly took his seat next to Draco.
Harry looked at Ron for a long moment, pride singing in his chest. Others might look at Ron and say he’s just a follower, that he’s only Harry’s friend because that’s as close to fame and money he’ll ever get, but Harry knew better. Ron was a fiercely loyal friend, and refused to let abuse and mistreatment continue. That’s why he’d stolen the car to save Harry, damning the consequences. This was the most
“We should get the D.A. together for a picture, like the one of the Order,” Neville said, pulling Harry from his downward spiral into bitterness. He hummed, moving to stack the pillows in the corner of the Room. Of course, it’s not like it mattered, really. But Harry was tempted to say on the Room’s good side, so he organized it as best he could.
“I got that much, Harry,” Draco said dryly with a roll of his eyes. Then, he softened again, murmuring, “Do they happen often?” The blond pulled back to look at the Boy Who Lived. Pain was etched into his face, pain that went deeper than the surface.
Molly had, of course, given him a brand new jumper with a large H on the front. He thanked her kindly from across the room, immediately slipping it on. It fit perfectly.
“Oh, happy day,” Harry replied. Together, they all returned to the kitchen and settled in again, smiles on their faces as they finished their dinner.
“Ginny…” he said again in a warning tone. A plan was already formulating in his head. How Draco was still asleep was beyond him. He had a feeling Draco was pretending now, but he continued on anyway. When Ginny still refused to move from where she sat between Draco and Harry’s legs, Harry took drastic measures. He drew his legs up to him slowly, while Ginny prattled on about their plans and what everyone’s been doing since school let out as if there was normal.
“I’ll see you Wednesday for tea with Mum,” Ron said after another long silent pause. Hermione heard him hug Harry. “Love you, mate!”
“I’m telling you that you have never done what was expected of you, so why would you start now?” Harry let out a short laugh. Never in his life had he been given permission to break rules, and expectations, and it was...kind of nice.
He slowly glanced over to, sure enough, see the blonde leaning against Harry, asleep. Harry was tucked against his side, a protective arm wrapped around his shoulders. Draco’s wand rested on the floor next to him, within easy reach of his hand. He snored quietly from where his head rested against Harry’s, and Harry smiled. Slowly, he moved to lean up and kiss Draco’s cheek.
“That’d be nice, wouldn’t it?” Harry asked. He sounded more cynical than he’d intended, but he didn’t bother to correct himself.
“I wasn’t thinking.” She started to respond, but Harry didn't hesitate before launching into his request. “Hermione, do you think you could help me create a Permanent Removal Charm?”
Hermione Granger and Ginny Weasley had been lost the day before, during a raid. At least twelve others they’d known had been lost with them. The World Wide Wizarding Community had yet to respond to their pleas for help.
She gave him an ice cold, polite smile before walking around him down the stairs. “Draco might worry. You might want to head back.”
“That’s a mean trick to play on the little ones,” Hermione said as she hid her smile behind her goblet.
hello! im greatly enjoying this story, even though it's only two chapters long!! i hope you're enjoying it too!
“But--” Malfoy stepped forward and Harry looked at him with a scarily blank face. A little frightened of what he found there, Malfoy took a step back.
Draco gaped at Harry for a moment. He wanted to be offended, to defend his customs like he always had. But his
, it was technically Harry’s fault the Room of Lost Things had been burnt to a crisp but the room didn’t have to pout about it! For Merlin’s sake, it was a
“I love my family, and I always will, but I refuse to stand by as they make my boyfriend feel unwelcome.”
“Absolutely right,” Molly said, brandishing a spoon in Narcissa’s direction. “After all we’ve been through, you two are the perfect balm for everyone. You two will be the poster child for new growth in healing, just you wait.”
“The only other time I remember it being this bad was right after I moved in. He was tearing the house apart, using every Muggle means to make this house livable. I think the work made him feel useful, and helped with the aggression. So, as time went on, his nightmares became less and less frequent. The physical strain seemed to help. But his roommates owled last semester saying he’d woken up screaming several times at the beginning of the year. They wanted to know what they could do for him,” she said, worrying the cup in her hands.
“Ginny, we had to watch you snog at least two people from this group as well as a few other blokes around here, and we rarely gave you shit. Let them be,” Neville said with a laugh. The confidence he’d gained during the war hadn’t waned now that it was over, and Harry thought it suited him. Before, he’d never have considered teasing Ginny, but especially not about her string of boyfriends her fifth year. Ginny made an affronted squawk and started in on Neville, drawing in Seamus and Dean, who had more personal taunts to throw around.
McGonagall had given him a new Quidditch playbook, and a kit to help him create new plays; he didn’t say anything because he had no words, but his smile was worth it to her.
Harry pulled Draco into yet another shadowy alcove to kiss his boyfriend. His lips were currently glued to Draco’s neck, determined to leave a hickey that Draco would surely have to hide. The blond was trying to keep a grip on Harry, his hands sliding over his shoulders and hair, looking for something to root him to the moment.
as of 3/4/19 this chapter has been updated! THIS IS A MUST RE-READ. i have drastically changed what happens in this a) because i felt the relationship was moving too fast and b) it was awkward and c) i wanted a different aspect in this relationship to come forward, so.
“Hey!” Dean cried, looking at Harry indignantly. Harry laughed, shoving bacon in his mouth to avoid having to respond to Dean, who was grumbling about an “unfair Captain.” The conversation resumed normality around them.
Harry headed to the kitchen with the food they'd bought from a convenience store on their way into the little town. Draco wandered into the living room where he found an old record player sitting next to a crate of vinyls. After blowing the dust off the player, he flicked through the titles, delicious smells slowly filling the small house.
As if seeing the agreement on her sister’s face, Andi grabbed her hand and dragged her up the stairs saying, “Then let’s get you out of those stuffy manor clothes, Cissy. Come on, I have some stuff that’ll fit you.” Narcissa argued all the way up the stairs, but it left Harry and Draco alone (Teddy wasn’t paying any attention, so it was the same as being alone).
“That is certainly a love story, Draco.,” Narcissa said. Her soft smile made Draco almost collapse in relief. He hadn’t realized how tense he’d been, but he was secretly relieved his mother was okay with
“Sure, if that’s what you want to do,” Harry said with a grin. As they walked from the kitchen, Harry started explaining the renovations. “We moved the kitchen from the basement up here to make it feel more like a home and less like an estate. The basement is now mostly Kreacher’s domain and extra storage.”
“Oh, those are so easy to break into. We’ll just give you the password,” Harry said off-handedly. “The only one I have no idea how to get into is Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw’s a right bitch to get into, but it’s possible.”
“For old times’ sake,” he said with a cheeky grin. Harry opened the rest of his gifts slowly until all his presents had been opened, save one. Draco’s.
patch note 10.02.03.15: large chunks of unnecessary dialogue were removed to ease the cringe. sentences were added to make things flow better and to create more coherency and continuity. word count for this chapter raised 626 words and is now 6405 words total, making it the longest chapter yet.
With no words, in sync, they found the other's hand, intertwining their fingers as they drifted to sleep, exhausted from it all.
“Draco, meet Teddy Remus Lupin-Tonks,” Harry said, moving closer to Draco. The baby laughed and blew a spit bubble; when it popped, Teddy laughed. Harry tried to draw his godson’s attention to Draco, turning his body awkwardly to manage the right angle. Curiously, Teddy leaned towards Draco, making grabby hands like he wanted to be held.
“It is a good idea, but I don’t want anything to do with Duelling anymore,” Harry told them. “I’m tired of fighting.”
“This is my problem, Draco! Everyone else has their own shit to deal with, they don’t need my shit too.” It was obvious that Harry struggled to keep his voice under control, to keep from yelling at Draco. At this point, Draco had heard enough. He moved to sit in front of Harry, kneeling between his open legs and looking up into his tear stained face.
“Tell them to make an appointment, I’m busy,” he said, running a hand along Harry’s side while looking very pointedly at his mother.
They took small breaks every so often to go up and study the painting, how it was attached to the wall, what might work and so on. Hermione gagged Walburga in much the same manner she’d blindfolded Phineas during the war. Of course, the black expression on the painting’s face gave an idea to the thoughts she had about the “filth” in her house, but Harry was glad to shut her up while examining the painting.
“I’m not sure what to do with this, though… It’s bugged me all semester. It’s got space enough that Andi said I should make it a loft and let someone rent it. Or I could make it into a playhouse for Teddy… Who knows, it’ll come to me.” Shrugging, he turned to walk back down the stairs. Probably to make tea.
“What is it?” Draco asked in an even voice. When he stared into Harry’s eyes, something unidentifiable was reflected in the gray of his eyes.
Seamus asked for the second and third years, muttering that he wanted to teach them as Remus had taught them.
“I’m glad I found you,” Narcissa said, cutting into whatever Harry was going to say. She stepped up onto the landing, moving so she was further from the stairs. “I’m afraid I’ve been unfair.”
in lieu of a shower, catching up with his friends as they loitered outside. Neville recounted his favorite parts of the game with vivid details, Luna adding in her own comments from time to time. They discussed the match the entire way to the castle, but Harry left them to head to the kitchens, promising to catch up later. He was
Elation coursed through him, causing him to wink at a familiar silvery head before zooming off around the pitch again, the Snitch held high in the air.
“That means you and Draco are in charge of last minute ornaments and presents for everyone else,” Andi said, already fishing for her shopping list in her purse. She also handed Harry a second list of people to buy small presents for and any missing decorations. Narcissa and Draco stared around them in amazement while the super important lists were handed around.
standing out starkly against his clenched fist. “I did what I bloody had to to simply survive! What was left of my family was murdered by Volde--” A shuddering gasp shook Harry before he changed course. “You-Know-Who. Friends, people who’d become my family, were murdered. And you think I have a little Felix Felicis in my veins?! NONE of what happened to me was fucking luck,
The ballad waltzed through the beat-up chapel, winding through empty pews. The witch read off the last words of the ceremony, telling Harry he may kiss his new husband. Draco pulled Harry close without hesitation, eyes fluttering closed as they melted into each other.
Harry sat up angrily, fire flashing in his eyes. He’d never had a row with McGonagall but there was a first time for everything, he supposed.
Verbally replying felt like such an effort, so Harry opted for shrugging instead as he dragged his spoon through his oatmeal. After a few moments, he let out a small sigh, dropping his spoon loudly against his plate. Hermione flicked the newspaper down to look at him sharply.
“And, if you’d stop going off to sulk by yourself, we’d have more time for other activities.” Draco knew Harry wasn’t one to dwell, so distracting him for now was a better option.
“You can come peel potatoes with me, love, so Fleur can get to making the pudding,” Andi said with a smile. Fleur grinned at Draco and made her way to the kitchen island to get started. Draco handed Teddy a dropped toy as he sat across from Andi at the table.
Once Hagrid started, he didn’t stop. There were stories that had them clutching their sides in laughter, and ones that ended in Harry’s sobs. But it was
“--But it’s obvious you fancy each other. I still may not trust him completely… but he’s had a lot of his own issues. He deserves a chance.”
“Maybe pretend you actually like your friends and boyfriend and it might make it easier, Harry. Whether you know what’s wrong or not, we can help you make sense of it. You don’t have to do everything alone anymore."
“First round’s on me, Malfoy,” he said. He didn’t stop for Malfoy to catch up, he just made his way towards the door. Harry thought Malfoy had stayed in the castle, as he didn’t hear him leave. Malfoy’s voice startled him when they were halfway down the lane.
apologize,” Narcissa whispered fiercely, tears in her throat making it hard for her to speak. “None of this should have happened. If the people in power had done their jobs, you would know what it was like to be normal. My Draco would know what it was like to be normal. Don’t ever apologize for doing the right thing, even though the system failed you. You may have been a child, Harry, but that doesn’t diminish your achievements. It also doesn’t diminish the atrocities committed by those in charge.”
“Harry?” Hermione called out, stepping properly into the room. A weird sense of deja vu settled over Harry watching his friends coming into the room.
“Speakin’ o’ yer dad… He always go’ away with more with more than he shoulda, but James did learn. Once, in his fifth or sixth year, he had ‘is first detention with me. He said some horrible things, sure. It took time. Not a lo’, considering how much time he spent in detention, but with listenin’ to me ramble, he eventually became a bi’ kinder to me. Still took ‘im awhile to become the grea’ man he became, but he wasn’ all bad.”
“Excuse me, do you mind?” Harry asked, gesturing to the seat across from Draco. “Everywhere else is full.” Draco gave a short laugh but nodded, stowing his book away.
His thoughts were interrupted as the compartment filled with Harry’s friends, all of them chatting softly about holidays with promises to drop by. It had been an early morning for everyone, and by the time the sun was high in the sky, most of them were fast asleep.
The class looked around expectantly, checking every possible corner for what they would be doing that day, the chatter rising with their excitement. He told them to stay put while he got their lesson ready for the day.
“Isn’t there a spell for that?” Draco asked from where he stood leaning against the doorframe. As he spoke, he moved further into the kitchen, crossing his arms.
“How lovely to see you, Harry,” Ron had said sarcastically as he saw his best mate taking shots straight from the bottle, sprawled out on his couch.
“I’ll begin Healer training. I’m wicked at Charms and pretty good at potions… And it just seems the right thing for me right now.” He shrugged, as if the idea of becoming a doctor is easy and
“Draco?” he implored quietly, opening his eyes slowly. Draco stepped from behind Hermione, quickly closing the distance between them. He’d been worried that his face would set Harry back, so deeply entrenched in his memories. Hermione was a friendly face and always had been.
Taking Harry’s hand, he stalked through crowds of people towards the entrance. A few people glanced there way, but for the most part, they were unnoticed. Before, the thought of leaving an event early would have made him sick. Tonight? Tonight, he would much rather drink the night away in some seedy pub with Harry.
When the score reached one hundred and twenty to Hufflepuff, Harry called a timeout, landing hard on the ground seconds after Madam Hooch agreed to the timeout.
time alone, and Ron missed cuddling Hermione without Harry on his other side. Not that he didn't love his best friend, but this wasn’t the kind of relationship they’d agreed on.
“It’s the least I can do, Potter. Have a good night,” she said as she waved her wand, the parchment rolls returning to their previous position on her desk.
“The media attention will be atrocious, no doubt, but you can make a game of it if you really wanted,” Andi said with a glimmer in her eyes that was pure mischief. “Have fun with it. You deserve it. Everyone kind of does after the years we’ve had.”
“Draco, why are we going in here?” Harry finally croaked as he registered the temperature difference.
A few long seconds hung in the air as Harry tensed his legs for kick off. Madam Hooch blew her whistle and he rocketed into the air, flying high above the plays the Chasers had quickly set into motion with Ginny taking point. He kept an eye on his teammates while his eyes scanned the pitch, looking for the Snitch.
and the bad news and slander it would bring. They’d attempted a similar type of crap during the Triwizard Tournament with Harry and Hermione, but it hadn’t caught on. Now they were printing about Harry’s relationship as if this were
“Don’t worry, mate, it’s been busy at the shop too. I’m not going to stop being your best friend after everything we’ve been through. A few months without talking, that’s about a yearly norm for us.” Harry grinned as he led Ron to sit on the couch. George stood with a groan and left with a comment about keeping their hands to themselves. “It’s all good,” Ron reassured him.
Harry set up the baby charms to let him know if Teddy woke up and closed the door halfway. The stairs were dark and quiet as he made his way down them, back towards the living room. Draco sat on the couch facing the window. There was a fire going, crackling merrily in the fireplace. Harry smiled, seeing the remnants of Draco’s attempt at starting the fire like a muggle.
This wasn’t an easy task as they were all veterans, but with the map in hand, Harry was able to evade them. He didn't like avoiding them, but if they were going to treat him like he was one word away from bolting, he didn't want to be around them. With the sun out and the air becoming warmer, it was easier to disappear into the forest and camp out for a few hours with the thestrals.
Andi walked in with a tea tray laden with snacks, another one floating behind her with the teapot and other paraphernalia behind her.
“Why the Room of Requirement?” Malfoy asked absently one day, twirling his quill in his hand as he edited an essay.
Draco didn’t remember ever being in Firenze’s classroom. But knowing his boyfriend, he could see the appeal. It looked and felt and smelled like the Forbidden Forest.
Draco stepped forward and pulled his dismayed boyfriend into a tight hug. “That’s what I was trying to say earlier, Harry, but you had to be dramatic,” he said into his shoulder. Harry gave a bitter laugh again, clinging a little too tightly to Draco.
Of course, he didn't have to wait long to figure it all out because Draco appeared next to him, two glasses of champagne in his hands.
a big thanks to irene!! my lovely friend who helps me with the weirdest problems and is a major help to my creative process esp w these dorks
Hermione’s hair frizzed up the more potions they brewed, but still no results. By dinner, Harry’s glasses were heavily smudged, he and Hermione reeked of a mixture of potions, her hair was the same frizziness as their first year, and they were no closer to getting rid of the blasted painting.
“When the article came out, I wasn’t as upset as I thought I’d be. I mean, you pined over him all sixth-year--”
“While I was at Hogwarts, it became clear to me that there are always choices to be made. Easy ones, like finishing an assignment, no matter how hard it seems at the time. Harder ones, like letting a madman live in my house for almost two years. Or the hardest ones, like learning where loyalties lied. I was told that our house was to be our family. Our loyalty was to the house, and it was our duty to see it prosper. That was preyed upon and corrupted. We were taught because someone was a member of that house, they could do no wrong.”
“Harry…” Draco said, dropping his bag by the door. His boyfriend sat on a log not too far from the entrance, his head in his hands, his shoulders shaking with sobs. He moved to sit next to him, but was unsure how he would respond to touch, so Draco just calmly sat next to him, waiting for whatever it was to pass.
“Harry Potter!” a familiar voice squeaked. Harry looked down to find Winky hurrying over to him, her beautifully embroidered pillowcase billowing around her, and a small smile worked its way through his rotten mood.
Bill shook his hand with a grin, and a pregnant Fleur kissed his cheeks. Molly and Fleur hustled off to the kitchen, while Bill and Arthur stepped into the dining room to get out of the way of the rather large group of people at the base of the stairs. Charlie stepped into the fill their spot, and Harry laughed in surprise.
“I want the house to be bright,” Harry said, staring at the new paint chips they’d collected. “No more dark, cloistering colors. I don’t want Teddy to grow up like that.”
“Harry!” Draco sighed in relief. “We’ve been worried about you,” he said in a low voice, shifting closer to Harry.
“I...had a nightmare.” He said it was if it were the end of the conversation. One and done. Nothing else to see here, Auror.
Last year, there had been no games to play. Only in his third had Harry played every game and won the House Cup with his team. But the exhilaration of the end of the war combined with the first incredible match had everyone in higher spirits. Even Harry couldn’t deny the happiness he felt at flying again and thinking only of the Snitch.
“After all I’ve done for the wizarding world, they’d fail me out of Hogwarts because of a mess they couldn’t clean up?” He laughed again, throwing his head back. “The Wizarding World wouldn’t have it.”
As Arthur sat, Harry stood, clearing his throat. “Happy Christmas, everyone,” he said. “Cheers, to us. To family!” Everyone lifted their glasses and took a drink to hide their tears.
“But you didn’t get to be that way alone. You’ve had help. Even when it seemed like nothing was going right, there were people to help you. You are so much like your father, always looking for trouble. You have your mother’s curiosity as well. Together, those two were dangerous.” McGonagall smiled softly, tears gathering in her eyes. “What happened never should have. It was a failure on everyone’s part, but specifically Dumbledore’s. But it’s a bloody miracle you came out alive, Potter, and I’d call that luck. Lucky that Voldemort’s soul broke off and planted itself in you, lucky that everything played out the way it did. I’m not discounting what you lost. The fact that you stand here today as whole as you can be is lucky. And
“The library isn’t a good place for practicals, and it’s too cold outside. Plus, they have class in here, so they’re comfortable with the space and therefore more comfortable with their spells.” He shrugged, flicking through progress reports he was getting ready to pass out for his class. Since he never gave them tests or quizzes, but he still wanted them to know where they stood in the class, he needed to come up with
The class fell in line behind him as they marched from the Defense classroom. Students whispered excitedly as they walked along the corridors to an unknown location. Paintings shouted out hellos to Harry, ghosts nodded their greetings politely, other students giggled at Harry as he led a line of students towards an unknown destination. They climbed the five flights of stairs necessary to reach the seventh-floor corridor, and the class stopped at one end of the hall containing the painting of Barnabas the Barmy being clubbed by trolls.
Staccato drum beats sounded from somewhere outside as Harry yanked Draco close. Hot breath passed between them as they dragged out a heavy, heady kiss. Tongues languidly intertwined as their hands twisted in clothing, desperate to keep the other close.
Harry let himself space out a little, continue to reminisce about the twins and the things they’d done throughout their years. He sorely missed Fred and how he and George always knew how to light up a room. Their best, by far, was with Umbridge. Pure genius, and Harry hoped that no one ever forgot about it. Students can, and should, stand up to tyranny, even if that tyranny comes in the form of a tiny woman covered in pink.
Dennis’ commentating grew louder as the crowd excitedly followed Harry across the pitch. The Hufflepuff Seeker spun quickly to try to cut Harry off, but she was on the other end of the pitch. Even her Nimbus Two Thousand and Two couldn’t hold up to the speed of his Firebolt.
“Of course! He’s not temperamental.” And that was all Harry said before handing over the boy who was gnawing on his own fist. At first, he wrinkled his nose. Teddy was covered in slobber and the front of his onesie was vaguely damp, but… There was something
“Perfect.” They both turned to watch whatever was on the telly. Draco was drawn into the football game, but Harry apparently couldn't stand the silence.
“Mr. Potter, you didn't have to come all the way up here to tell me you aren’t taking this class. You could have stopped going and been fine. You aren’t even taking the N.E.W.T. for it.” McGonagall sounded a little exasperated that Harry was draped across the chair, interrupting her work. What looked like Transfiguration essays were scattered across her desk, a rubric off to the side.
Once Neville finished his stories, Harry let his students out early with reminders to practice their wand work for their final. Their chatter rose animatedly as they packed up and left the room. Harry watched with a slight bitterness. What he wouldn’t give to be like that again…
“Night, little monkey,” he whispered, kissing his godson’s mousy brown hair. “I’ll see you in the morning.”
“You look great, Mum,” Draco said with a smile. Kreacher grumpily announced lunch was served. Together, as an odd little group, they moved into the dining room. The table was set for four people and a toddler. Narcissa briefly looked confused at the lack of a head table, but settled next to her sister without a word. Harry placed Teddy on one side of him, while Draco took the seat on his other side. Teddy got to eat first, with everyone serving themselves once the baby was made happy.
He waited until Malfoy was through the portrait hole before making his way up to Gryffindor Tower. He lit his wand as he walked, careful to keep it away from the sleeping portraits. Malfoy hadn’t been the most talkative of company, but he wasn’t bad to have a drink with. Even if he seemed to drown his problems in firewhiskey. He’d feel that bad decision in the morning, and Harry couldn’t help but gloat a little at that. Their rivalry might be dead, but he could still revel in the little things.
“I understand, Potter.” Her tone was understanding, and Harry breathed a sigh of relief, thinking this would be the end of it. In his relief, he missed the slight edge to her voice, the one that indicated a lecture. “But you must continue going to your classes, whether you want human interaction or not. The world is unfortunately populated with people.” Without another word and her head held high, she marched into the Great Hall, leaving Harry floored. She didn’t give him detention or a real lecture or...anything really. Shaking his head at his near miss and thanking his lucky stars, , Harry continued inside to the Great Hall. His friends were sat together, all talking merrily. Only Draco seemed more subdued than usual.
“This process is extremely difficult, Potter. It is a miracle your father and his friends didn’t end up with half transformations or worse. But you have guidance and you don’t have to scrounge for the supplies. I know how to acquire them.”
“I’m not sure why I even added it,” he said, shaking his head as he threw himself haphazardly into a chair in her office.
After Harry gave them a brief rundown of the night’s events, there was a stunned silence that lasts only long enough for Hermione to draw air in.
” Hermione said in one breath. Harry had Apparated to Ron and Hermione’s tiny flat in East London. Before Ron and Hermione knew fully the storm that was about to hit, Harry had already gotten his tie undone and had a bottle of firewhiskey in his hand.
Draco made his way into the Great Hall for breakfast, trying desperately not to think about the fact that he and Harry hadn’t spoken in almost a month, that his heart didn't ache for his boyfriend’s smile, that he didn't miss the less awkward meal times.
“Draco!” she said, a wide smile spreading across her face. “I’m glad to see you, dear.” Before he could issue the proper thanks, he was pulled into a tight hug.
“I love you, mate, and Hermione does too, but Merlin’s saggy ball sack, Harry! You’ve moped around here for two weeks! Go work things out with your boyfriend. He can’t actually read every single thought you have. You have to tell him how and why you feel the way you do!” A long silent pause. Harry kicking his foot awkwardly, like a child.
Sometimes, it all became too much. He would escape to try and get the Room of Requirement to open so could properly escape. But a door never appeared. No matter how much he begged and pleaded, it stayed firmly closed.
“I knew your family wouldn’t like me! I prepared for that! I knew they would try to trip me up with social graces, so we practiced! But to insult my
“Are you pouting over tinsel colors, Potter?” The ribbing would have been more digestible if Draco hadn’t insisted on wearing the most gaudy
“You’re not that hard to figure out, Potter,” Draco said with a small grin. The fact that his boyfriend thought he was some enigma was hilarious to Draco. No wonder he was awful at Legilimens; his emotions and thoughts were written all over his face constantly.
Wide open desert surrounded the couple for miles, stretching on, orange and red, ad infinitum. A comforting sight. Harry revved his bike again and pushed her to go even faster, chasing the sun across the horizon.
“Yes,” Harry said grudgingly, trying to hide his smile though Ron didn’t bother to hide his. He leaned in closer to Harry, as if they were planning something. Memories of the many nights they’d sat like this, trying to stay alive drifted past. Harry reveled in how different things were now because
Hermione was always working, and Ron wasn’t even at Hogwarts, and everyone else seemed to walk on eggshells around him, so Harry felt more and more isolated.
Hermione’s response was cut off by McGonagall calling the class to attention. The Muffliato was gone with as much notice as when it had been cast. Harry didn’t pay a second thought to his students throughout Transfiguration. This may have come easy to his dad, but Harry had to focus even more. And today they were focused on the theory behind Animagus transformations. Harry hated Transfiguration theory.
They spent the next part of their morning mostly glued together. Harry showered, Draco providing idle conversation in the bathroom from his perch on the sink. He talked about Charms and what he wanted to do once he was done with Hogwarts, but in an abstract sense, and that he was actually really looking forward to their next semester at Hogwarts. He continued the conversation while Harry dressed in his room, while Draco showered and Harry sat on the toilet, and while Draco dressed. Harry, for once, didn't seem to be in the mood for mindless chatter, so Draco provided it for him.
“Did you just say Merlin’s left nipple?” Harry asked through giggles. Draco glared at him, though Harry noticed he couldn’t keep a smile off his face.
Harry chuckled to himself, choosing not to comment. While it was true that Professor Slughorn was at times worse than Snape when it came to teaching Potions, he still preferred Slughorn despite his small (read: big) fascination with him just because he was, you know,
Harry sheepishly shrugged and Malfoy rolled his eyes at him. He picked up a vial to add the potion into it for examination by the professor.
"That is not going to work," Hermione sharply said to her boyfriend. "Ginny sounded as if she wanted to rekindle whatever romance they had but how do you rekindle a fire that has gone out?"
"Can you think of any, like, singular happy memory in your entire life? Like when you and your mother would watch the stars together?"
"I've never heard of this Racdian." It was true, not once had his name appeared in any books on the syllabus, not even in
“While education might not be of importance to you,” Malfoy grinded his teeth, “some of us need to have EE or above as part of our probation orders.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but the corner of his lip was curved upwards but then instantly turned down. "That day in the Potions when you were constantly asking about the dosage of the Draught, it was because you wanted to know how much to take?"
"It's not that kind of situation. There is no debate on whether one is right or wrong, there is simply no such phrase as 'wonders do cease.'"
“Nothing in the history books jumped out when I read on it last night. It was a day like any other.”
The sand in the hourglass was falling quickly as Harry counted down the days until he could leave the Hospital Wing. He spent his mornings asleep, under a sleeping potion, his afternoons were spent with visitors, mainly Blaise, Luna, and Hermione, and his nights were spent admiring the medieval glass paintings. On this particular night, sleep evaded him just like old times. However, he felt more of a restless night rather than what he was used to. Normally his insomnia would force him out of bed, drape himself with the Invisibility Cloak and march downstairs to the Room of Requirement and cook himself a monster of a pasta dish.
Harry listened intently, hoping that his name (and Malfoy's) would be called. He was the third student to be formally invited to Friday's supper party, Hermione was the fourth, Luna was the eighth, and Malfoy and Nott were the 11th and 12th respectively.
Hermione leveled him with a look that told him he was a colossal idiot. "Of course, Harry! That's where nearly all the previous Headmasters and Headmistresses portraits remain."
"That's it?" Malfoy asked after Harry remained silent. He stared at him, hoping he would add more onto his words but he remained mum. "Goshawk wrote a bucket load of information about the Charm than you, Potter."
Malfoy levelled him with a look. “You would like to name a very real, very serious mission on finding the truth behind the founders of Hogwarts
"Wonderful!" Professor Slughorn clapped, Harry wondering how he got to them that quick when the last time he had spotted him he was at the front of the classroom writing something on the board. "And you, my dear boy, who is your partner?"
this is long overdue -- i am sorry for that. i hit a writer's block with this and to get my block out of the way i normally (easily) write for some other fandom which then i am able to write freely for this one. so hopefully it works out
Harry sat gaping at her. Dumbledore had a lover this entire time? He was not just some old man, wrinkled and cranky and ruining his life? He had someone in his life? Harry snorted. Even Dumbledore had a somewhat successful love life and he was, well, here.
Hermione pointed to his Divination textbook. "I'm sure you can find more information there. Or ask Zabini for more information as I'm sure he's an expert on it."
Harry stood up after scraping his plate clean, and after cleaning up, walked out of the Room and wandered off into the cold, eerie corridors of Hogwarts.
"Potions," Malfoy said, listing each subject with a finger. "Transfiguration, Herbology, Charms, and DADA. Herbology is going to be a pain in the ass I can tell you for sure."
"You don't have to say yes, like, I was just thinking if you wanted some help. Which you may, like, not need but it's there. It's being offered. By me. Like. Um. I am offering my help… if you need it. Erm. Help. That is from me—"
"If you don't properly know how to use it – and I doubt that you do – you will invite all sorts of dark magic to meddle with your magic and bad things tend to happen to you."
Harry wondered, looking around at everyone who seemed drawn in by Draco’s natural charm. Frowning, Harry crossed his arms. (Okay, maybe the frown was more of a pout, but this random stranger would have no reason to pout in an art exhibit.) Draco did have a tendency to go on and on, but he always had a point to get to. Apparently, he wanted everyone to go on this ride with him.
Once the cookies had been finished and whisked away to be baked, the family and Harry retired to the sitting room for tea and already-baked cookies. Harry somehow ended up in a conversation with Nicholas, which was more than awkward.
They passed the time it took Harry to eat like this, terse silence only broken by the clinking of china on china and the thud of metal on wood. Exhausted by the staring contest and full from the warm comfort food, Harry rose and thanked the house elves for their generosity. Malfoy gaped like a fish at him for a minute before speaking as Harry reached the portrait door.
Harry shrugged one shoulder as he answered Neville, “I wanted to teach the fourth years defensive spells. You guys learned easily in this setting. Maybe it was the idea of rebelling that made you good students or that you knew you were safe here, but whatever it was, I’m hoping it’ll work on them too.” He stared around the room a little mournfully and Hermione grabbed his hand, squeezing it gently.
“Well, you did storm off pretty spectacularly,” Hermione said, not looking up to gauge Harry’s reaction. He huffed but didn't shut her down. “Maybe he was going to defend you, but you stormed off before he got the chance.”
Harry mumbled his thanks as he headed up the stairs to the expansive library. Andi watched him, frowning slightly.
“Would you mind?” Draco asked in a small voice. Facing his parents was hard enough during the summer, but the holidays are meant to be about family. Which… they didn't feel like anymore.
“But that’s impossible, I just saw a battle right here! The Death Eaters must have fled before I got here, although I don’t know how… Hermione, we have to find them.”
“But I got you banned from playing Quidditch for life!” Malfoy said, sounding distressed at the thought. Harry leaned his head back to look at Malfoy and their proximity startled him.
“I wasn’t really planning on forgiving you anyway,” Draco said. Harry winced before he registered that his voice was haughty but fond. Harry let out a short, bitter laugh, and finally looked up to meet his eyes.
3/4/19: four more chapters left to update!! we're so close! i lowkey ref'd this post, but here it is!!! http://queenofthyme.tumblr.com/post/163036564716/does-everyone-else-here-agree-that-draco-malfoy-is  i was hoping i would get to use it SOMEWHERE so yay!!
Across the hall, the younger students looked confused. Was there really a troll in the dungeon or was it an inside joke? When should they panic? As if sensing their confusion, McGonagall stood. Seamus only grinned in the face of her withering stare.
Draco met Harry’s eyes before looking down at the green tea towel. He smiled as he stepped forward to take it, accepting a plate as he did. Harry prattled on about mindless things, like the decorations they needed or what presents he wanted to get for everyone; Draco only made comments occasionally and with little snark. They worked like this until Harry was draining the sink and snapping off the bright yellow polka dotted gloves.
“Like what?” he asked again in a low voice. Draco hummed his response, unable to voice it as his breath became a little shakier. Harry leaned in slowly. One hand rested on the back of the makeshift log couch and the other cupped the back of Draco’s head. Their lips met slowly, reverently. Draco melted into Harry, groaning quietly at the slow pace his boyfriend had set. Harry smirked against him, nipping his lip.
He tried to pull himself together when he heard Harry approaching the small living room with dinner.  He wiped the tears from his face and took a deep breath. They both knew the other was scared and tired and wanted nothing more than to curl up in their mothers’ laps and have a good cry, but they pretended to keep themselves together for the other, pretending that everything was okay.
“I’m sorry. I know I said I’d try… But it feels like fifth year all over again. I know something is wrong, but I can’t seem to pinpoint what it is until something goes wrong. I don’t know how to ask for help if I don’t know what’s wrong.” He paused, gathering his thoughts. His face rippled with embarrassment as he remembered. “And now those kids are going to be talking about what a raving lunatic Harry Potter is.
“And you came up here to bother me why?” he said, glaring at her. He hadn’t actually moved his head yet, but Ginny could still feel it.
Turns out he’d overslept after their interrupted evening. He ran all the way to the Great Hall. The doors slammed open and everyone jerked to look at Seamus. He stood in the center for a moment before running towards his friends with a mischievous glint in his eye.
hello! i hope everyone is enjoying this! i guess these arent really a part of a cohesive story?? theyre more of a set of one shots, so dont really expect one to tie into the next!
Harry had fallen into a deeper sleep than intended because the next thing he remembered was Draco gently running his hands through his hair and gently nudging him, speaking softly. “It’s time for lunch, Harry, and then you have a class to teach.” Harry grumbled as he stood and stretched off the sleepiness. Draco quickly packed up their things with a wave of his wand and together, they made their way back to the castle.
Harry liked to believe he was great at hiding his emotions from everyone. Of course, no one had the heart to tell him that he wore his heart on his sleeve and, lately, it was no different. He’d been on edge more. He was more prone to brooding than usual, he was often silent at meals and even with friends, and his lessons were subdued and short. Any attempt to ask him what was wrong was met with “It’s nothing, I promise,” which did nothing to reassure anyone who asked. If they didn't get a sad, dejected response, they were snapped at.
Harry gave a brief speech in the locker room before telling them all to have fun tonight because they
“The timing. Because you can only keep the mandrake leaf in your mouth from full moon to full moon, and it has to be spit into a vial within range of the moon’s rays, there cannot be any clouds on the second moon. If there is, you must start the mandrake leaf over. Then, once you’ve completed the mixture to drink, you must wait for a lightning storm, which is not common here.”
“Talk to McGonagall about what?” Seamus asked, plopping down unceremoniously next to Harry, pulling Dean into his lap neatly.
It didn't work too well, no matter how hard he tried. He still woke up screaming more often than not. He would brush off Draco’s comfort and lock himself in the newest room he was working on, pretending Draco didn't hear him sobbing as he tore through walls.
“Hey, I can’t help that your godson is a Slytherin,” Draco said with a smirk. Harry gave a grumpy “hmph” and Draco smiled wide.
Harry was standing now, looking at McGonagall in the winged chair. As he glared at her, his chest heaving a little from yelling, she took a long sip of her tea before placing the cup and saucer on the table. Her eyes met his, and Harry expected anger or the look she got before admonishing him, but there was only sadness.
“Draco, it’s raining,” Hermione said matter of factly, pointing to the window where rain poured down the windows. The sun had disappeared behind the thick clouds again, deciding to stay hidden for the day. Rolling his eyes in that delicate way only Malfoys had mastered, Draco said, “It might be helpful. Merlin knows it’s cold enough. He’s not going to die from a bit of cold rain.”
“Now Remus… I found ‘im after a full moon, wanderin’ across the grounds at dawn. He was only a tiny first year. If anyone else had caught ‘im, he’d woulda been in trouble. So I invited ‘im for tea and breakfast, then took ‘im back up to to McGonagall.”
The music swam lazily to the surface through the static, drifting through the roar of the motorcycle. Wide open desert surrounded the couple for miles, stretching on, orange and red, ad infinitum. It was a nice change of scenery after years stuck in the endless dark in England.
“They were more common this summer. That’s the first one I’ve had since October.” Draco didn’t push any further, knowing Harry would share as he wanted. And Harry was secretly relieved. As much as everyone wanted to share everything he thought and felt, he wasn’t sure he was ready for that kind of intimacy with Draco. Not yet.
(thanks again to irene whom i love with all of my tiny heart bc she helps me so much and juust ljkdlajdla jda jthis honestly wouldn't happen without her)
After he felt more like himself, after a few more twists and dives, he gently turned his broom back towards the pitch. The descent was fast and hard and brought a grin to his face. He pulled up at the last minute and landed gently on his feet. Breathing hard from exertion, he returned his broom to its locked box. He was a little damp and a little cold, but a quick spell removed all effects from his impromptu fly.
“Well…” Harry launched into a long series of stories about Quidditch and his classes in the old D.A. practice room, and anything he could think of that wasn’t what being back at Hogwarts actually felt like to Harry. Or Draco.
“I have to grab my jacket and wallet, so either you can come with me, or you can just wait here. There’s a party in the common room, so someone might notice you hanging around outside,” Harry threw over his shoulder as he made his way up the stairs. Malfoy didn’t follow, and Harry felt a weird feeling settling into his chest.
“That’s dangerous work, Harry…” At the look on his face, she sighed but relented. “But I can ask around.”
Harry’s eyes drifted to the Hufflepuff Seeker, waiting to see how she was approaching the Snitch. She seemed to be imitating Cho’s strategy. Cho had tailed him all during their match in third year, cutting him off when she thought it was opportune. The Hufflepuff Seeker seemed to understand Harry’s tactics a little less than Cho because she was circling lower than Harry and in an awkward pattern.
