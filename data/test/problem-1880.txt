"This is my son we are talking about, Albus. He's going to participate of this stupidity, but if he gets hurt, you'll pay for it."
The brunette slid his hands to the blonde's ass and gripped it, making a soft groan come out of Draco's mouth.
"I hate you having to do this too, Harry. Merlin, we all do. But i don't want you worrying about me. I want to do this, I'm going to be okay. And you are going to be okay too, but i don't want you only thinking about the others, you need to worry about yourself too. Okay?" He felt Harry nodding against his shoulder.
The other boy hummed softly and nodded, before closing his eyes and letting his body relax on his boyfriend's safe and warm arms.
The boy always took care of them, always made sure they were comfortable, safe; that they were fine and that they felt loved and happy. But it had always been hard to let Harry let them do the same for him.
"I mean, it's pretty obvious how Cedric is way more protective around Harry, Ron and Theo." Pansy explained and they looked at the said boy, who just looked back at his essay and cleared his throat. They laughed.
"Love?" The boy heard his boyfriend's voice, he heard it, but he couldn't focus on it. His thoughts going to what he would do if he gets hurt - if he dies - in the second task because of how Harry couldn't save him. He couldn't - he couldn't - lose Draco. He just couldn't.
"Maybe some adventure." Fred said and he threw himself on the blankets, George did the same and in a matter of minutes, they were all on the floor, blankets covering them, lots of pillows around, it was comfortable. And when Luna and Ginny got back and laid there too, they all felt at home. It was home. They were all each other's home.
"Harry? Are you here? Please, be here... oh." Someone was here. Someone was here and he didn't know who it was. He couldn't understand their voice. He couldn't see them, his vision too blurry due his tears.
"You need to rest. I know you want to help Cedric and I, but i need you to rest, okay? I need you to take care of yourself too. Or to let me take care of you, at least." Harry muttered, his chin resting on the top of Draco's head.
Soon as they got at the room where everyone else was, Draco closed the door and he looked around. Sirius almost fell when he saw Harry and ran towards his godson - who laughed - and hugged him. James did the same, and the two adults were hugging Harry tightly.
It's been a little hard lately, actually. The second task got me worrying a lot about Draco and how I'm going to take him out of there, I'm scared, but it's going to be okay. Hermione, Theo and him had been reading a lot of books that would help Cedric and i during the task, and honestly, i think they already have a couple ideas of what we will do or use during it. Besides it, I'm good. We're all good.
Sirius winked at Harry and in a fast way made a sign of a mirror, telling him to keep talking to him through the object and Harry rolled his eyes and smiled.
"Perhaps we should all rest, it would help, i guess." Theo said and both Blaise and Draco agreed with the boy. Harry needed to rest, they all did.
His thoughts wouldn't stop, they wouldn't stop torturing him - torturing him with all kind of pictures and scenarios of what could happen in the next two months, what could happen during the second task.
"Not really, think i barely slept two hours. Couldn't stop thinking about... this stupid situation." Harry sighed slightly and caressed Draco's hair softly, before kissing his lips quickly.
"How was the meeting with Fleur and Krum?" Draco asked when Harry and Cedric walked into the library and the younger one sat by his side, resting his head on his shoulder.
He could hear parts of muttered words, he could hear Draco's voice. He had to focus on that, because of how calm it was, because of how calm it made him feel, how it made his heartbeat calm a little too.
"Many things are wrong at the moment, my boy, but right now, both yours and Draco's parents are here. Professors Snape, Lupin, Mcgonagall and I were having a... conversation with them before we decided to call you." Draco grinned, feeling satisfied their families were here now.
"It was good, they're scared now too." Harry explained and held Draco's hand, bringing it closer to his lips as he pressed a soft kiss on it.
The wizard world had felt in shock when it went out that "Harry Potter, the only child of one of the most important families to the Wizard World, a fourteen year old boy, was going to participate of the Triwizard Tournament". People were confused, mad, happy and they all had a lot of different ways and emotions they felt about the situation.
Harry was looking at his boyfriend in such a passionate way while listening, carefully, to the words that were coming out of his mouth, while listening to the melody he was playing with his guitar, while feeling such a warm and lovely feeling inside him.
"Hey, look at me. Harry? Love, please don't do that again." Draco said and Harry glanced at him, making him sigh in relief.
"You are really dumb, but you know that, right? I mean, Harry, Remus, your godfather is - literally - one of our professors, Severus, Draco's godfather, is also one of our professors, they're part of your families and you really think that they didn't tell the rest of your families about it?" The boy said like it was obvious - and it was -. Harry stayed in silence for a few seconds before slapping his forehead twice.
Suddenly, Harry felt more arms around him, around him and Draco. It was their friends. They were all hugging him, a group hug. And for now, that's all he needed.
"Me either." Cedric also considered Harry a little brother, he cared deeply about the boy, he loved him. And then there was Ron, who felt the same as Theo and Cedric about Harry. And he knew that his siblings - Ginny, Fred and George - felt the same too. Harry was family. Harry was family for so many people, for so, so many people.
Draco was really exhausted yesterday, but he slept a lot and today I'm making him taking a break from the books, to rest his mind a bit. He's kinda angry, but he's like a cute kitty when he's angry, so i don't really mind it.
"Library night?" They all looked at him, before a crowd of "yes", "sure!", and "Of course!"'s were heard around the room.
He just ran out of the library, he needed to get out of there, so he did. And he ran. He didn't know where he was going, but he didn't care. Not now.
"Hey.. " He felt warm hands softly hold his face, making him look at it. Draco was holding his face, looking at at him with so much love, fear and... concern on his eyes.
"Did you like this one?" Draco had just finished singing, he was looking at Harry all the time, both of them with stupid and sweet smiles on their lips.
"Wow!" A suddenly scream was heard around the bathroom and Harry and Draco separated their mouths. The blonde - still holding his boyfriend on his arms - turned his neck a bit and saw Ron standing there, looking like he was going to explode seeing how red his face was.
"You know, i still don't understand what she's even doing here. I mean, she was supposed to be the new DADA professor, but all of a sudden she and the Ministry decided that she was going to be the "guardian" of the castle. She's literally just walking around, observing all of the students and professors, giving us detentions for literally just being alive. She's useless. And annoying. I hate her." Theo said and the others agreed with the boy. Umbridge was like a plague.
"Everything's fine now, don't worry about it." He put a piece of fruit inside his mouth and started eating it.
"I don't know." Harry mumbled against Draco's neck. The blonde kissed his forehead and looked into his eyes.
"Hey, did you finish your letter?" Draco walked into the library - where Harry was with Cedric, Theo, Blaise, Fred, George, Luna and Ginny - with Ron, Pansy, Neville and Hermione.
"We love you, Harry. And we are a family, no matter our blood difference, we are family. And we love you and we take care of each other. You always take care of us, always, no matter what. You can lean on us sometimes, you know? It is a okay thing to do, little brother." Cedric said calmly, hating the way Harry always neglected himself.
"Hmm, the task's going to start in the next hour. I think we shou-" The blonde stopped his talking by kissing him again.
Harry tried to hold back his smile, but he just couldn't. Not when his boyfriend was so happy like that. So, he smiled too.
"Do you think our families already found out about the tournament?" Harry asked, while Draco was putting food on both their plates. The brunette grabbed a croissant and started eating it.
Harry and Draco only listened to their friends with a soft smile on their lips. Well, they weren't wrong. It was cheesy and romantic as hell, their relationship.
"Get some rest. I'll stay here with you all the time." The boy muttered and kissed his boyfriend's forehead.
"We can make hot chocolate and read a few histories, can't we?" Harry asked and everyone agreed. Reading histories and drinking hot chocolate or eating some comfort food with the people he loved was Harry's favorite thing to do when he was stressed, and even though he was acting calm and trying to keep everyone the same, they now knew how stressed the boy must be feeling.
"I'm right here, Harry. I'm here." He was starting to feel less like the weight of a huge rock was standing on his chest, he could breathe a bit better again. He tried to take a deep breath, it hurt, but he did it. He could feel Draco's fingers touching the back of his hands, making soft patterns there - like he always did, knowing how it helped the boy to feel calmer -.
He could hear his heartbeat, it was beating so fast. He felt so scared. He felt so fucking scared. He put his head between his knees and tried to breathe, but it was fucking hard.
He put the chocolate frog inside his mouth as the room fell in a dead silence, before exploding with loud noises and sentences, of course.
"Merlin, Harry.. !" Draco gasped, feeling when his boyfriend started making back and forth movements on his lap, more specifically, on the top of his dick.
He felt so in peace, so loved and so safe during these moments. In fact, he always felt that way around Harry. Since they were just little kids, Harry always made him feel safe, loved, protected, in peace. He always felt so lucky to have his boy in his life. He loved him, so fucking much.
"Candies and having each other companies." Neville complemented, gaining soft hummers as answers from everyone.
And PLEASE, read the final notes, they're really important! I need to explain some things about this story.
"You bloody sleepy assess, wake up!" Everyone opened their eyes and looked around. Harry yawned and pressed his hands on his eyes for a second, before grabbing his glasses and putting them on. The boy shaked Draco's body a little and the said one woke up too.
All of them had been reading about spells and researching about the topic since they found out about the task, but Theo, Draco and Hermione were the ones that were focusing more on it.
"Hum... oh fuck!... about going back to our room?" He finished his sentence and Harry stopped the kiss, only to look into his eyes, before saying:
"It happened before, the night your name came out of the goblet. I remember Cedric walking you out of the great hall and i saw that you weren't there too, you weren't focusing on anything around you. And when i got where you and Cedric were, you were acting just like you did now."
Harry was sitting on Draco's lap, the blonde was hugging his body like he was a big teddy bear, making Harry feel safe and protected without even knowing it. Cedric was at Draco's right side and Ron was at the blonde's left side; Hermione was sitting on the other couch, Pansy was at her side, holding her wand, thinking about it all. Blaise, Ginny, Fred and George were on their feet, walking around the room, talking about what they could do to the person that put Harry's name inside de Goblet; Neville, Theo, and Luna were on another couch and they were silent. Theo had his wand on his hand, holding it strongly, wanting to kill whoever put the younger boy's name inside that thing.
A soft moan cut his thoughts and he felt Harry moving, without stopping their kiss and in a matter of seconds, the younger boy was on his lap. Both legs on each side of Draco's waist and his arms around the older one's neck.
At that moment, with the person he loved the most, while listening to the voice he loved the most, while looking at who he loved the most, Harry felt in peace. He couldn't think about his problems; he couldn't think about what he would do next week; he couldn't remember the awful feeling of not being able to breathe; he couldn't focus on nothing that wasn't here, right now; he couldn't feel anything, but love and care from his boyfriend. He couldn't feel bad. Because, right now... right now, Harry could definitely say he was fine. And that would be true. Because, he was. Right now, with Draco, just two people who loved each other so, so much, Harry was fine. He was safe. He was protected. He was loved. He felt that way. Draco always made him feel that way, no matter what; the situation, the moment, if Draco was with him, he knew things were going to be okay.
"Morning... " Harry yawned again and he put his arms around his boy, cuddling closer to him. The blonde pressed a kiss on his forehead and kept stroking his soft hair.
They stared at each other for a few seconds, thinking how lucky they were to have each other; thinking how badly they loved each other.
Draco started relaxing even more and he couldn't even keep his eyes open anymore. Harry noticed it and smiled softly.
The book says a lot about Panic and Anxiety attacks, and i don't know, but perhaps that's what i had. A panic attack. But, I can't be sure. I didn't have another one after that night, although if i go through another one, I'll let you know and I'll go to Madam Pomfrey. But i don't want you to worry about it, please. I'm fine, okay? Promise.
Harry couldn't stop thinking about the song since the night he went to the Prefects bathroom, put the egg underwater and listened carefully while the words came out.
"Untill that happens, we all just want you both to keep taking care of each other and making sure you and your friends are safe and okay." Lily said, putting her arm around Draco's shoulder and squeezing it softly. Draco could see through her eyes how concerned she was about Harry, he understood.
"Well, we have a plan then." The blonde took Harry's hand on his own, brought it closer to his lips and pressed a kiss on his knuckles. He then, put their hands down, still holding it together, and kept caressing Harry's knuckles carefully.
"Of course! Bubble-head charm is the best option for Harry and Cedric to use during the task. How didn't we think about it before?" She looks at Draco and Theo.
Cedric took a deep breath and took the chocolate frogs box from Harry's hand, he grabbed one and put it in his mouth. Harry chuckled and rested his back on Draco's chest.
"I still can't believe i won." Harry said suddenly, his voice was sleepy, he was. The blonde kissed the top of his head and smiled softly.
They were okay. Draco was okay. Draco was safe. He was alive. He was alive and safe. He was here with him.
"They're probably gonna worry a lot, just like we do." Hermione explained, looking at Harry with a soft look on her eyes.
"I think i can deal with that." He muttered and rested his head on Draco's chest, who made a soft and satisfied sound before closing his eyes. The brunette closed his eyes too and they both fell asleep during the next minutes.
"I will, but it was not my name who was forced by someone inside the Goblet, i want to participate, i want to do this, Harry doesn't."
"But i trust you, you know? We all do. Draco trusts you more than he trusts anyone. He knows you are going to do just great. And honestly, i know that too, and all of our friends feel the same." She said in a calm voice.
"Merlin, your dad... Sirius, oh Merlin, Sirius is gonna kill Dumbledore." Ginny said and Harry grinned, snickering a bit.
"I know, that's what i'm... worried, about. I don't want them to worry. I didn't even want you guys to worry. I hate feeling like I'm a fucking burd-" he cut himself before finishing the sentence and sighed, a deep sigh.
"Here, chocolate pudding. It always helps me to feel better after a stressful event." She gave one to Harry and one to Cedric, who started eating few seconds later.
He was okay, wasn't he? He was just nervous about the second task, nervous about his boyfriend staying underwater for an hour and Harry needing to take him out of there. He was scared Draco would die. His mind was terrifying him with all the scenarios - the awful ones - of what could happen. He felt - all the time, all the fucking time - like a giant weight was being pressed on his chest, preventing him from breathing, making his heart beating faster because he was scared he couldn't breathe. He couldn't sleep well for a few weeks now, he was using charms so anyone would worry about how pale and tired he looked... but he was okay. Yeah, he was okay. Or he was going to be, at least.
“If I had purple I would’ve used that, because they say that would pop his eye colour even more, but I don’t.” She shrugged. “You want some too?” She asked Draco. He shook his head, “yeah, I didn’t think it was really your style either.” She shrugged.
Harry was bobbing his head up and down, sucking Draco off, while preparing himself. He moaned around Draco’s prick, the vibrations causing him to moan as well. Halfway through prepping himself, he felt Draco’s balls tensing, Draco’s orgasm was approaching. He kept sucking the hand previously busy with prepping himself, moving to cup Draco’s balls. The man moaned, emptying in Harry’s mouth, swallowed it all down. Draco breathed hard, his chest heaving up and down. Harry sat back again, “can you continue?” he asked, “or are you done?”
“I didn’t see anything,” Harry said, “just felt rage,” he breathed hard. He looked at Hermione and saw she was opening her mouth to lecture him. “Leave it, Hermione, it’s not something I can control. When he loses control I feel it.” She closed her mouth but looked angry.
The group met at 2 in the drawing-room, Sirius and Remus with excited grins on their faces. They stepped through the floo to the venue. After a quick look into all the rooms, the group saw that everything was as they had placed it yesterday, and Harry followed Remus to their dressing rooms.
Harry was glad when they finally arrived back in the caste, he was done with all the walking. He fell on their bed, looking at Draco with puppy eyes, hoping the boy would lie down next to him. The taller boy rolled his eyes but laid down next to him.
“You know,” he said, “I always wanted a studio when I was younger, but there was never a room with better lighting than my own.” He paused, “well none that I could use at least.” Harry nodded. “The bottom floor had beautiful lighting but they were already used as ballroom, dining room and drawing room, so we couldn’t make that a studio.”
“Yeah,” he said, he pulled out the food he had taken from the kitchen, giving Harry some fruit. “We talked with McGonagall yesterday,” he explained, “Harry explained what happened in the forest,” he said, causing Sirius’ eyes to widen.
‟Just reminds me of Tonks, she didn´t like her own name all that much, since it was that posh,” Ron points out.
The three of them apparated to the Burrow. They were greeted by Molly Weasley, “Harry, my boy,” faintly he heard Sirius growl, “Happy Birthday,” she said, hugging him. She turned to Sirius.
She seemed to think, “though, during the war it was quite different. Mainly because dad and I were on Harry’s side, but Lord Malfoy wasn’t. So that might’ve caused friction. Though in the end, he did protect me, because had it not been for him, I would have most definitely been in Azkaban, and my father would be dead.” She said.
They walked through the forest. Harry knew where he needed to be. He could feel it in his bones. He followed the sound walking through the old trees, walking slowly.
“Yeah, I also send a letter to Cissa,” he said, “especially since you know she had to live with a psychopath who talked to his snake for over a year. I don’t want her to be uncomfortable, just because I want to have a snake.”
It seemed that three consecutive nights talking about top-secret things concerning a war helped to form a bond between the two guys. Harry had yet to think of things to talk about tonight with Malfoy. Snape said they would need to form a bond, allies he had called them, but the bond needed to be strong enough that they could tell the other about their acts in the war without scrutinization. They needed to understand the other, so they could understand how they would act and why they did things. Harry felt that he didn’t mind talking with Malfoy, he would have thought he would, he was a git who had acted against Harry’s friends, but at the same time, he knew that Malfoy was scared.
“Thank you,” Harry said, “could I borrow them?” he asked, to which she nodded, indicating the list where he should write his name and date. “Thank you,” he said, “have a nice day.” She just nodded in response, going back to what she was doing.
They had their conversation with the headmistress and their teacher that Wednesday. Harry sat in the common room, staring into the fire. He was waiting for the two of them, even though they had only left. He had tried to pick up a book, but he felt that he did not enjoy reading today. He didn’t really know what else to do and had resorted to staring into the fire.
When the conversation ended both boys had finished their plates of food and time had flown by. “We should probably go,” Harry said reluctantly, “I still have homework to finish.” Draco agreed with Harry. They walked towards the door leading out of the kitchen, Draco was about to open it, “Wait,” Harry said, grabbing the map out of his pocket, “We should check no one is in the hall before opening the door.”
Draco nods, ‟I´d love to,” he says softly. He holds out his hand, and the ring slips on like a glove, only slightly resizing to snug fitly around Draco´s finger.
‟I know,” she says, ‟and I´m aware most people would say this could be preferential treatment. But it´s not. The only reason I´m not giving you the job immediately is because I know you don´t want that treatment. You´re a much better teacher than any Defence teacher bar Remus, who you rival. The marks of your students show that. That has nothing to do with luck, that was all you and your teachings.”
They sat in silence, the only sound the slurping of tea. Every once in a while the snake would say something. Harry answered it with a nod or a shake. Though halfway through the hour, Harry answered with a short hiss. When it was almost time to finish, Harry was having a conversation with the snake.
Ever since the first meeting, Harry had brought Darsh with him every time the infamous Snake Club met. This time was no different, though he did hide him in a bag, as they were in the city. They walked through muggle Londen, Harry showing them that it can be cool as well. They were soon very enamoured by the muggle clothing that was hanging in the shops. Though of course, it was the expensive designer clothing that they liked.
The spell hit with force, meeting them again. He felt power being added to his own. He knew it was Draco. He could feel his power growing stronger. And his spell won from that of Riddle. The man fell down, the wand jumping away, clattering on the floor, much like his body.
Harry had no idea how to answer that because no, there really was no reason to be smiling. “Oh, I saw filch trip when I went back,” Harry said still smiling, although now it was mostly forced. Cursing himself for not thinking of anything better. But luckily it was good enough for Ron, who laughed loudly at that.
After that, the court reconvened. Harry and his friends met Remus at the door. “Why didn’t you tell me you were going to testify?” Harry asked after he pulled back from the hug. Remus just shrugged.
‟I didn´t even want to be an Auror anymore,” Harry says. ‟I want to be the Defence professor, and I´ll do my apprenticeship after a year break.”
‟You told her the truth, right?” Draco says, ‟I know we want to keep it a secret, but not if it involves your health.”
“The Hogwarts library has failed me,” Hermione said, “there is no single book that has an explanation of what a Horcrux is.” Ron opened his mouth, but she continued, “I even looked through the restricted section, using Harry’s cloak of course, and there is only one book that even mentions it. She grabbed the book from her bag, opening it and read, “It’s the introductions to
“Nice,” Harry said having taken a look at his schedule, “we have Transfiguration first. Can’t wait to see what Sirius will do.”  Hermione nodded in agreement.
“Oh, thought his diary,” Harry supplied, he realised that even though he always told Draco they would talk about that they never did.
“Harry, it is important to remember that Voldemort has warned him about us. How are you going to be sure that he will listen to us, and accept our help?”
The smell of bacon wafted through the house, waking the other inhabitants. Molly was the first awake, she came down, also stumbling on Harry and Draco in their own little world. She too did not disrupt the picture, walking over to the kitchen to help Sirius.
“You will stay with the Dark Lord, and you will give information to the order about what is happening.” Snape answered. “You will do whatever you can to give the order an advantage, but you will do what you have to, to stay alive at the same time.”
Harry ignored the rest of the people in the carriage, all still looking at Harry in favour of turning to Draco. It was hard, as he was in his lap, and they were squished between Luna and Hermione, but Harry managed. He looked into Draco’s eyes, “I’m okay,” he said, he felt his friends' eyes on them, but didn’t focus on it. He cupped Draco’s cheek, “you saved me,” he said, “you won’t ever feel that again.”
“We did not know what Master Harry liked so we made Master Draco’s favourite for both,” she said. The two were holding a platter with steaming French toast covered in strawberries and powdered sugar. Harry and Draco sat with their backs against the headboard taking both serving plates from the elves. “Do masters wish coffee or tea with their breakfast?”
Harry sat down next to Sirius, “I don’t want to be awake, but he,” he said glowering at Draco, “decided to be a decent human being, and wanted to make us breakfast. Didn’t even know he knows how to work a stove.” This caused the other three men in the kitchen to laugh.
“This is your home Harry,” Sirius said, “you deserve your own place, your own room.” His eyes landed on the big bed, “we even took a future girlfriend in mind,”
The group looked out over Diagon Alley. Everywhere people were walking up and down, entering shops. People were shouting and carrying stacks of their newly bought packages.
“He made seven Horcruxes?” Harry said, horror-struck, “but they could be anywhere, hidden, buried, invisible.”
So, yeah safety first, no talk about where y'all are. Also, I think a non-hurt Ron is better, it won't make him feel as useless as he felt during the books. Which might help with the Horcrux :)
“Well, we only figured it out because of where Moaning Myrtle was killed, and the snake on the faucet,” this caused Draco to look once again with a confusing look. “The most important thing about my meeting was obviously the memories,” Harry said, continuing to explain the first memory Harry had been shown. When he finished, he voiced the question that he had been thinking about since dumbledore. “What I don’t understand is how the Aurors didn’t realise it was Tom that had killed his parents, they can detect underage magic, so how didn’t they know?”
“Jazz?” Harry asked, knowing both that Draco liked it, and that it would be comforting for him. Draco hummed in agreement, pointing his wand at it, letting it start on the Jazz channel. Soft piano music filled the room. “Thanks,” he whispered, eyes still focussed on the floating lights.
“Uh,” Harry said, “technically he also did it during our second year,” Draco’s eyes grew bigger, “I’ll tell you about that later okay?” Draco just nodded, not knowing how to react to that.
They arrived together at the station, hugging each other goodbye, but only till they saw each other next Wednesday. Hermione and Ron promised to come by that week so they could all prepare in the manor. Harry and Draco said goodbye to Remus and Sirius, Promising them to floo over on Tuesday for brunch. They looked over to the Floo network to see there was indeed a long line. With one last hug to Remus and Sirius Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and apparated them straight to the front door of their home.
With every lesson, the two seemed to get more accustomed to each other. Draco had already apologised for everything he did, and he showed his changes by helping anyone who was in need. He didn´t call out anyone, he was polite and a gentleman overall. He and Harry still butted heads though, and the tension between the two had reached a breaking point when they had to stay behind for a lesson once.
“Because I thought you were a posh bunch who just liked old stuff? I never thought you were actually noble.”
George splutters, ‟you´re sure he´s not taking the mickey? I mean he missed 1st of April by like a week, but still.”
“Bloody hell,” Ron muttered, “never expected to see the ferret making pancakes.” Harry saw Draco’s shoulders tense at the nickname but felt that he couldn’t really say anything. But it seemed Remus had seen it as well.
“I will be able to,” Draco answered, “the question is should I. It seems to me, teaching Harry how to find and destroy a Horcrux that is not pushed into his lap by my father, is more crucial.” Harry knew how much pain it did Draco to say that. His mother was everything to him.
Draco had stayed silent throughout all, letting Harry talk or cry. He smiled. “Want to find those diaries your father talked about?” Harry nodded, Draco grabbed Harry’s hand, pulling him upright. “Let's go then.” Harry grabbed the letter, tucking it safely into his jacket.
“Hey,” Ron said, “I’m just going to sit here, and work on the homework Sirius just gave us.” He turned to the boy, “just,” he said, stopping. He looked at the faint circles under Harry’s eyes. “You can lean on me if you want. I know I’m not Draco, but I want to help you as much as I can.”
“This year is going to be way better than fourth,” Ron said. He turns to Hermione, “we are going together right?” She laughs nodding, “good,” he says, relieved.
He could feel Ron stiffing up but he didn’t say anything, only put an arm around him, pulling him closer. “So many good memories,” Harry continued, “you, Hermione, Draco. First time flying. All that was here,” he looked at the castle. “But so many bad memories,” he sighed, “Quirrell, the chamber of secrets, Cedric, and that’s only the first four years.” He went silent.
He walked back to the board, continuing to write on it. Every once in a while he looked back. The two were sitting quietly, Harry leaning against Draco. They were looking in front of them. It took him some time to realise they were looking at a snake. He heard it speak some times, but Harry didn’t answer besides a shake or nod of his head.
The next day, Harry, Hermione and Ron went home. Hermione was going to go to her parents, to stay there till Christmas eve. She would join the Weasleys, Sirius and Remus, and Harry at Grimmauld place for Christmas. Harry and Ron would be going directly to Grimmauld place. Ron’s parents had decided that it was safer to go there when they went home than going to their own home. They had noticed people following them, and with the Fidelius charm, they could be sure no one could follow them if they apparated into the premises, something they were able to do.
“Because you two were worried sick, which was understandable because I too was worried. So when I saw that I didn’t want to say anything. Besides he got punished for calling him back here only to say they lost him.” Harry explained.
Ron opens his mouth to say something but he´s interrupted by Hermione, ‟you really think that? You don´t think he´s just using your fame?”
When he had asked Hermione and Ron they looked confused, not understanding why he wanted a snake after last year. Though when he started talking about the little guy his eyes lit up, telling them how he talked to him. They must’ve seen the way he looked and how happy, and they said they didn’t mind.
At eight he arrived at Dumbledore’s office. Professor Trelawney was there, but she left around the time Harry got there. “Have you managed to procure the memory from Professor Slughorn?” Dumbledore asked Harry.
Daphne and Astoria look with interest but don´t mention anything. Harry can see the cogs turning in their heads. ‟So,” Harry says, turning to Astoria, ‟sorry for taking your future husband? I guess?”
There was music playing loudly, and half the room had been cleared so that there was enough room to dance. The other half of the room was filled with couches and pillows, creating a place to sit and talk with people. There was a silencing charm around it, though it only lowered the volume of the music, so you could talk without screaming into someone's ear.
“Class,” Slughorn began, “today I have a delightful surprise for all of you. We will be making the Elixer to Induce Euphoria. It induces happiness in the drinker. There are of course some side effects, they include nose-tweaking and Excessive singing.  But before we start, I thought I would all show you a potion that you all will be able to make when you finish your NEWT’s.” He beaconed everyone to the table in front of them. “Could anyone tell me what this potion is?” He gestured lifted the lid of the potion and a strong scent entered the classroom. Everyone took a slow step closer to the potion, “Hermione,” Slughorn said, seeing her hand in the air.
Pomfrey grabs a book off her shelves, she taps the cover, spelling it to read something different. ‟This should have all the information,” she says, ‟if you want to tell your friends and family you can of course.”
“I have no idea, my scar just started hurting, but then it was over again,” Harry said, though he felt like he knew how he got the impulse to move again. He had almost drowned, Draco must have felt that. Though by the look of Ron, he had been ready to jump in.
“Nothing,” Sirius said, “just didn’t expect to see you talking about a snake like that. Well except the snake next to you.” He winked at Draco who made an affronted noise. “It’s okay with me,” he said, “but I do understand why you think you need to ask. What about you Remus?” he said.
They ate further in silence. He noticed the others looking at Draco and Neville every so often. He really shouldn’t have talked about it. But at the same time, he really thought Harry had known. Would he still want him? Now that he knew that Draco was noble? Did he know what it meant? Harry must’ve felt the worry, as his ankle curled around his leg. Draco relaxed minutely. He’ll have time to explain everything, and Harry won’t have to do anything he doesn’t want to, he’ll make sure of that.
They were laughing, working hard. With the harness of the dirt, it was hard to pull the gnomes out, but they managed. They were in their own world, Draco winning with the throwing competition.
The night was dark for both boys, when Draco finished the story, tears were still running down his cheeks. He cried silently, the horror of it all filling his minds, the screams of the people, the view of the bodies, all on the forefront of his mind. Harry cradled him in his arms, letting him know that it was okay, he was okay now, and it's okay to cry. The boys stayed intertwined for a long time, not wanting to let go of the other.
“Minerva, the Minister of Magic will be here within seconds, he has just Disapparated from the ministry.” She nodded, and the man left. “We shall see what happens,” she said. “You all,” she pointed at the students, “go to your common rooms, we will talk with the Minister.”
Draco looks towards him with a surprised look, ‟I´m a threat to him,” Harry tells him, ‟I´m taking you away from his house. I´m making a family with you. I´m distracting you from your family.” He shrugs, ‟I´m taking your attention and love.”
Harry nods, ‟what if he has a nightmare and wants to sleep with us?” he says, ‟does that mean he has to walk up the stairs first? That´s dangerous.”
Harry nods, ‟sometimes being famous also comes with its perks. Don´t think we´d know this if it wasn´t for him recognising us.” Draco nods.
“Harry,” Kingsley said, “There are many things that came up during our investigation of the battle of Hogwarts and the previous years. Many of those involve you, and I wish I didn’t have to do this, but we would need to discuss this. I need to know what Hermione, Ron and you did during the war, and what it had to do with the last battle.”
“Just a feeling,” Harry said, he closed the book. “What kind of name do you think I should give the snake?” he asked his friend.
They slowly unpack the rest of the house, and by the time they´re done the office is full of books, the guest room has space for people to crash and their own bedroom has their clothing hung and in place. They hang the art up around the house. There´s still a lot to do, things to buy. Drapes, small tables, a washing machine. They have a list hanging on their fridge, and every time a new thing is added. Another list hangs next to it pretty quickly, detailing food and other bare necessities that need to be bought.
‟I wanted to ask you the same thing,” Draco says, ‟I don´t, I want to hold your hand in the hallways, and be able to just take a walk with you. My main concern was my friends.”
“Understandable,” she said, her eyes travelled down to his hands. They were moving over one another, scratching the scar there. “If you ever feel the need to talk, or to find a mind healer, you can always come to me.” She was silent for a moment, her eyes focussed on his hands, which were moving slightly. Only then did she notice the snake curled around his wrist. “Who’s that little guy?” she asked, changing the subject.
“My friends know, so why shouldn’t yours,” he said, “I don’t think Kingsley would kill us for that. I honestly wonder how it’s not common knowledge. You were very obvious during the last battle.”
‟I´m not tired,” Harry says, ‟but we have all the time in the world to unpack. It´s nice to have a free living room, and we should start with our bedroom tomorrow. But now we could do something more fun.” Harry smiles.
“Wait?” Harry says, “I’m dating someone?” Draco makes a so and so gesture. “More a friends with benefits thing?” Harry asks.
Draco looked at Harry with a critical eye. “I think she’s right,” he said, “if you want that, that is.” Harry shrugged.
Harry looked at Draco with wonder, “What,” Draco answered his stare, “I liked the elf, we used to talk when he was still with us.” It seemed he realised how sad that sound when he started to blush.
She smiled at them, “Will you be back master Harry?” she asked, he nodded, “what must I do while you are gone?”
“I’m trying Hermione,” Harry said, “but I don’t know how to, the man just runs away when he sees me. I can’t even stay behind the class, because he walks out before I do.”
“And, in the end, it died with dad,” Harry said. “The only thing that survived from them was the name that wasn’t even truly theirs.”
They did a cursory check of their bedroom, looking into the closet to see Draco’s full and Harry’s only having the suit he had worn at Sirius and Remus’ wedding and the Achkan he had worn during the Yule ball.
Draco looked at the boy next to him, he could feel that Harry was faking his smile partly. He could feel Harry was putting up an effort to look like he was totally okay. But after telling McGonagall about the forest, he knew the pain was seeping into his body. Harry must’ve felt him looking, as he turned to look back. “Want to go?” Draco whispered, to which Harry nodded. He turned to the others, still there, “we’re going to go sleep,” he said, “goodnight.”
“Currently I live with him, and those two rascals in the back,” he pointed at Harry and Draco, “together with Draco’s mother, if she is in the country. Now, I think that is all you need to know about me. Any questions?”
Narcissa nods, ‟I imagine you´ll have plenty of grandmothers, grandaunts, aunts and uncles, that would take care of him.” Draco and Harry both nod with a laugh. ‟What will you do come year, though?” Narcissa asks him.
“Actually,” Harry said, “I have some.” Hermione looked at him in surprise, “Pihu gave me a jewellery box full of cufflinks and things I didn’t even recognise,” he explained. He called the house-elf and asked if she could bring the box. Hermione and Ron bowed themselves over it.
“Sirius,” Harry said, looking up at him, “I need to ask something from you, but I can’t tell you everything, but it's important.”
“That is the Library,” Sirius said. Hermione perked up at that. Sirius led the way. He opened the doorway, showing an enormous Library, filled with all kinds of books. There were also portraits hanging every few spaces.
“Hermione,” She said to the woman next to her, “I’ve seen you grow from a lady who was scared to be expelled for seeing fluffy to someone who left her school so she could make sure her best friend didn’t die during his quest to kill a dark lord. You stood next to those you deem important with true Gryffindor bravery. And even during that, you have never let your marks tumble. You have been always eager to learn.” She smiled, “It is with full confidence that I say that I can not wait till I get to vote for you when you run for Minister of Magic.” Hermione blushed at that but thanking their former head of house.
The group ate together, talking excitedly. Harry told Narcissa about the home, including trying to convey the beauty. In the end, he just told her that he would show her some time, as no words could do it justice. She just smiled at him, saying she would love to visit.
Only Hermione and Ron were still standing in front of him. “You two want to come in, I’m guessing?” they nodded, “just, don’t mind the mess,” he said, faintly remembering throwing Draco’s shirt across the room.
‟That I had to check my schedule,” Draco mumbles, ‟would´ve said I´d have to leave early if you rather I didn´t stay.”
‟How about we unpack the pots and pans, and I start dinner?” Draco offers. Harry smiles brightly, and they fill they unpack everything in the kitchen. It´s easy to find places for them all. Harry puts the plates and bowls above the sink. The pans under it. Draco puts the glasses and mugs in the cabin next to the one filled with plates. The rest is empty, ready to be filled with food and spices.
The group were waiting in anticipation for the rest of the afternoon and the evening. However, Kreacher did not return that fast. Sirius and Remus had retired for the rest of the evening, letting the three of them alone. They discussed what had happened. For the first time, the other two understood more of what Harry had been through with Dumbledore. He could tell that only when Kreacher had told the story, they could imagine more what it was like.
He turns to Harry, ‟I know you will never forgive me for what I did, and that is your prerogative. I won't act like I would have made any different choices had things happened now. But I wish that that would not mean me never seeing my son or grandson.”
“No,” he said, “stay here?” he asked. Ron nodded, letting him decide. He didn’t have any food though, which was always something that irked Ron. Ron’s stomach grumbled, causing him to turn slightly red. Harry laughed lightly. He pulled out his wand, casting his Patronus, the Occamy appeared turning to him. “Tree by the lake, bring lunch and Hermione,” he said, sending the Patronus of to Draco.
Draco nods, ‟we should make Ron the godfather. He´s your best mate. And besides, Neville can be the godfather of our next one.”
“Yeah,” Draco said, “but it was worth it. You want to see it?” he asked Dean, who nodded. Draco pulled the ring off, handing it to Dean, “I think you can guess why I chose the colours.”
“If you guys say so,” he said, “but you would need to apply it,” he told Hermione. She nodded, walking to her room to get her eyeliner. “Sit Harry, while I do your hair.”
“Hey Harry,” Neville said, sitting down next to him, “Draco, good to see you two. I hope the rest of the school didn’t give you all too much trouble. I couldn’t move without someone talking about the two of you.” He moved to put some food on his plate.
Harry feels himself nodding, ‟yes, sorry,” he says blinking rapidly, ‟my baby moved for the first time.” Her eyes grow, dropping to Harry´s baby bump.
“Yes,” Draco said, “but during this war, there was a big chance that one of us could die and I knew Harry was it for me. We might be young, but I know he is forever.” He smiled at Harry, who smiled back.
“I really am glad that Weasley is okay,” Draco said, “I just don’t like the idea that it is my fault he is hurt. Even if he still hates me.”
When the elf had disappeared the silence in the kitchen was stifling. It was Sirius who spoke first. “My brother,” he whispered, turning to Harry, “did my brother go against Him doing that?” Harry just nodded. “You can’t tell me what the locket means I am guessing.”
Harry took his time getting ready. He tried to style his hair but it would never go the way he wanted it to. Though he didn’t really mind, it made it easier to act like he hadn’t just been thoroughly shagged by his husband. After all his hair always looked like that.
Harry hugged Pansy, who gave a soft laugh. “I did not realize it was a Hogsmeade weekend today,” she said, “so many students in here.” Harry nodded.
The group dispersed, Remus and Sirius vanishing into their room, and Harry and Draco doing the same. Their suits had been laid out by Kreacher, though Harry made sure to pack a bag with his clothing and some eyeliner and hair product. He didn’t use it every day, but on occasions like this, he wanted to at least have a semblance that he took care of himself.
When he finished unbuttoning his shit he pulled it out of his pants, though with Harry lying down, he couldn’t remove it. The blouse fanned his frame as a cape, Harry lying on it. Draco took one of Harry’s nipples in his mouth, sucking on it, his teeth scraping the little bud. Harry gasped his back arching.
I can't believe it's the end! I thoroughly enjoyed writing the series and I hope you guys liked reading it!
“Are you going to keep that name?” Neville asked, “you’ll both be Malfoy’s after the wedding, so wouldn’t it be strange to call your manor after the Potter family?”
‟This crib is enhanced for protection and can move on its own,” he says. ‟Maybe something you´re interested in if the rumours are true.” Harry frowns, ‟small-town gossip spreads fast,” the shopkeeper says. ‟You can hide the bump, but not the walk.”
“There is no Potter family left though,” Draco said, “there are only the estate, the money and contracts. There are no family members to take care of.”
Draco frowns, ‟uh, raw fish and raw meat. But you don´t really eat that either way. Besides that, I think you´re okay.”
“Two cups of tea, please,” Draco asked of them. They were ushered to a table, two cups of tea appearing in no time, accompanied by some late-night snacks. Harry leaned his head onto Draco’s shoulder. “You know, I think when we get back, we should go to my room. The silencing spell is still up there, and my room faces away from the forest.” Harry just nodded. “Think you can sleep tonight?” he asked, Harry just shrugged. “That’s okay, well figure it out.”
‟Dray´s been reading one we´ve gotten from Pomfrey,” Harry says, ‟but thank you. I would offer the same but I´m as clueless as they come so I don´t think you´d have much help with me. But you can always rant.” Fleur laughs walking over to Draco.
Harry was ecstatic, sending a letter to Hagrid to ask if he thought it would be possible for Harry to pass his NEWT that year, and sending another letter to Hermione asking for her notes on the history classes. She did, saying she was excited for him, saying she would help him however he wanted.
Seamus and Dean walk with Harry and Draco to Hogsmeade Saturday. It turns out that that day was when they had dates. They said goodbye in front of the three broomsticks. Draco pulls Harry to the clothing shop down the street.
His trio of friends has fallen apart in the span of one night, Harry, always the supportive friend tries to spend time with both his friends, it’s hard, but he manages. With Hermione, he works at school, and talks about the upcoming Slughorn’s party, with Ron he plays games. And with Draco, he talks about Voldemort and his problems, the things he doesn’t want to bother his friends with.
Draco nodded, “I was thinking about it,” he said, “and when we were cleaning out this room I realized the same. There are a lot of things that can go to our vaults, some that I would think would even fit well in Potter Manor, and of course my own things.” He looked at the thongs around him, “I’ve been summoning my clothing, but I can hardly summon everything I own.” Narcissa nodded.
“It’s okay to want something, my love,” Harry said, “it’s okay to mourn what could have been. It doesn’t make you a bad person to want something different.”
“Yeah,” he said, “it’s probably part of the reason I want a snake. They’re cute, and I can speak with them.”
Harry nodded in understanding. “And your house-elf, he listened to you? And your father couldn’t compel him to do something else?”
After that the group left, the Hogwarts students going back to the castle and Pansy and Blaise both going to their home.
“I would recommend more gold on the white one and more silver on the black one, with touches of the other on the opposite.”
“That you almost got sorted into Slytherin?” Ron said, “the other thing,” he said his eyes locked with Harry, “can wait till you want to tell us.”
“Hey guys,” Remus said, walking over to the others, Molly looked at them, nodding. “Would you all like to come to our home?” he asked, “I can't imagine it would be nice to drive home this late, and we have enough rooms.”
His eyes land on a blond man sitting at the bar. He’s talking with the bartender, probably ordering a drink. And Harry’s eyes travel down the man's lithe frame. He’s wearing a suit, it’s well-tailored and hugs him in all the right places. The suit is a light blue, and he takes off his jacket before taking a seat. Harry looks at his face, it’s all angles, his cheekbones prominent. The man is beautiful.
‟Lucius,” he says, surprising Draco if the brief squeeze in his hand is an indication, ‟you should have owled with the news.” He walks forward with ease, Draco only briefly hesitating before following.
“Shall we go to the common room?” Draco asked, “let the little guy sleep and all that.” The others nodded, and Draco and Harry walked down, holding hands. “It’s pretty great that we can do this,” he whispered into his ears. Harry nodded.
“What? How? Huh?” Harry said, not knowing what to say. They were now standing in front of the greenhouse.
The music changed and Harry´s heart hammered in his chest. This was it, his wedding. He walked out, and his eyes landed on Draco. He was wearing the same suit as Harry, only in the dark Bordeaux red that seemed to make his pale skin even paler. His silver eyes shone brightly as he looked at Harry, a smile on his lips. Hermione was right, the jewellery they were wearing really finished the outfits. The silver was bright against the dark red. They stopped in front of each other, both standing in front of their made of honour, with enough space that their audience could see Narcissa standing between them.
“Harry, Harry!” Ron’s voice reached Harry in his dreams, waking him from the dream he was having. “Harry, mate, are you okay? You were having a nightmare.”
McGonagall gives him an unimpressed look. ‟I kept this because it reminds me of my late husband. Because I didn´t want it to be sold to some developer.” She shakes her head, ‟if I wasn´t sure I wouldn´t have brought you here.”
Draco hesitated, “he doesn’t deserve that though. He wasn’t a good father. Sure, till we were in our second year, he was an okay father, but after that, he changed.” He looked thoughtful, “I can’t tell them that he was great, but I also feel like I can’t tell them he was bad either.”
Twycross clapped in his hands, getting everyone’s attention. “The important things to remember when Apparating are the three D's. Destination, Determination, Deliberation! Come one, everyone, the first one is Destination, this will be the hoop in front of you. Fix your mind firmly on the desired destination. Concentrate.”
6th year had been more difficult than Harry could have thought at the beginning of the year. The press finally believed him that Voldemort was back. Malfoy was being more suspicious than normal and Dumbledore hasn’t been honest with him since the beginning of his 5th year.
They turned to Remus and Sirius, “I’ll tell them you are sleeping,” they said, “go, sleep, you deserve it.” He nodded gratefully and closed the door. He held his hand out to Draco, who grabbed it, and together they walked to the bed, sliding in and falling into an exhausted sleep.
Harry scowls, ‟I honestly couldn´t care less about my education right now, Hermione. But even so, I can finish Hogwarts even while pregnant.” He looks at her, ‟because I´m keeping him.”
Narcissa places the sceptre on Harry’s hand, balancing it carefully. Though there is no need, as the sceptre turns in the air, moving to hover above their hands. It goes through their magic, standing next to Harry’s string so that it too is intertwined by Draco’s magic.
“Harry was just officially recognised as the heir to the Potter family," Draco answered, "Apparently, the task was granted to the family house-elf.”
Draco’s blush only intensified, “Maybe,” he said not looking Harry in the eyes, “in my defence, it was before we had met and I thought that we would be friends when we went to school.” His eyes trained on something left of him, not looking at Harry.
“Yeah, I’m not buying anything. But I like seeing the animals.” He held the door open for Draco. “who doesn’t like seeing animals.” His eyes fell upon the section with various birds, and he turned away from them, walking the other way. Draco followed.
Harry just lifted his hand showing his ring, “Slytherin prince and Gryffindor’s golden boy,” he repeated. “And I’ve been told I look good in green,” he said with a grin.
Harry nodded. “In that hour, we watched the memories Snape gave us. Most of them were of my mother, he loved her. But there was one that was most important. It was of Dumbledore and him, just before my sixth year, when Dumbledore realised he would die. He confided in Snape that I was the last Horcrux and that I must die before Voldemort could be killed.” There was a bitter taste in Harry’s mouth, his voice rough, “he kept me alive, so I could die at the right time. So I could die and give Voldemort false hope. That’s the only reason he made sure I was kept safe, even if the home he put me in almost killed me.”
“He knows,” Harry said, without thinking, “the first nights of the summer weren’t much better than now. I think he just knows, that I don’t want to bother people with this shit.” Hermione nodded, Ron just shrugged.
When they parted from another kiss, they noticed that the room had made a Gramophone appear. Music started to play, it was playing a soft tune, with a romantic melody. The Draco chuckled lightly, he stood, standing in front of Harry, holding out his hand. “Dance with me?” Harry nodded, putting his hand in Draco’s.
‟I mean, he did speak at my trial,” Draco says with a tilt in his head. He´s only realised he´s said something he´s never had before when the three of them all stare wide-eyed. ‟But yeah, he did hate me, but not anymore,” he adds, hoping they won't ask him about the trial.
Draco blinks, not expecting the question. ‟Not really,” he says, ‟I mean I feel tired in the morning but that´s usually gone when we start the first lesson.”
‟I´ll have you know that it´s just rich people,” he says with a smile, ‟not all of us are white men from a long line of white men.” He pauses, ‟but I interrupted your training, go back to training, I´m gonna find Jennifer and Theo.” He waves at them all, letting them continue.
“He won't answer to you,” Hermione said, “he doesn’t have to talk to you. And he certainly won't talk to me or Ron.”
“Please take the veritaserum on the desk,” she asked. Every witness had been obliged to take it, else they were not taken into consideration. They could still give their testimony, but it would not weigh as much as the others. Harry did as she asked, downing the potion. He could feel the effects immediately. “Will you testify in favour or against the accused?”
Draco nodded and seemed to think for a second. “Aberforth. You need to go to the Hog’s Head, he owns it. There’s a secret passageway there. It’s used by the DA, for food. Ginny told me.” This surprised Ron and Hermione. “Land there, but Harry, there’s a curfew. There’ll be a sound, they will come out at once. Be prepared.” He looked up hearing something. “I need to go.” And the connection was lost.
“Ginny,” Remus said, “you are very resourceful, you are strong and you are independent. You have been through a lot, both good and bad things, and you always came out stronger. I have known you since your second year. You have grown into a fierce woman who knows what she wants and how to get that.” He smiled at her, “I can’t wait to watch you fly for the Hollyhead Harpies.” He turned to her and gave her her diploma with a bright smile. She smiled gratefully and accepted it, turning to the tables where Sirius sat, holding out a quill so she could sign it.
She nods, ‟very well,” she says, ‟I asked you both here because I wanted to discuss your options. Have you thought about wanting to keep it or not?”
“Our wedding planner,” Harry said, moving his feet so he could sit next to Draco. “Narcissa has one that is an exact copy, as do Molly, and Remus and Sirius.” Hermione looked shocked, “yeah, they are self-updating, so if one of us writes something we all see it. And if we add something it gets copied and added to theirs as well. The same goes for removing off things. It is a very nice system honestly.”
“Uh,” Draco said, faltering for the first time, “I am not entirely certain. Because it is something that would affect the whole family. I’m not certain if we would need to ask the people if that is something they would agree with. And also I don’t know if it happened like that in the past. I know families were taken into another though.”
Harry cast a tempus, seeing that they had an hour or so before they were expected at breakfast. His friends would only be waking in a half hour or so. He rolled over to his husband, looking at him. Draco had closed his eyes again, now looking calm, basking in the early morning light. Technically it was still moonlight, as it was still pretty dark outside.
“We’re meeting more,” Blaise tells Draco, though he looks at Harry to show he is included in that. “I haven’t seen you in too long, and this was not enough. We’re meeting during Christmas as well,” he paused, “but at least once a month till then.” Draco isn’t dumb enough to refuse, so he just nods.
Harry nodded, walking over to the couch and taking a seat, Malfoy followed. “It was my fathers,” Harry usually didn’t want to talk about his parents, but for some reason, he didn’t mind that much now, “he had loaned it to Dumbledore before he died, and dumbledore gave it to me as a Christmas gift in our first year.” He was looking at the cloak in his hands, Malfoy reached over but stopped himself from feeling the fabric.
‟Well,” Harry says, ‟that was different than expected.” Draco snorts nodding. ‟I´m glad there will be a c-section. Don´t know what I´d do if I had to deliver.” He grabs the picture again, ‟look at this little bean,” he says softly. ‟I can´t believe that that´s inside of me.”
“Whatever you need to tell Harry, you can tell us too,” Hermione snapped, “the mission that you had to keep a secret is over.” Ron nodded beside her.
Draco lets out a dry laugh, “of course it wasn’t just you! It was fun when we were 20, even a bit exciting when we were 18, but I’m turning 24 this month! We’ve been together for five years! We bought a house together.” He shakes his head, “you know why I wanted to keep it a secret, and I get why you didn’t want to tell anyone, but it´s been six years since the war Harry, people have moved on.”
“I get why they chose you,” Harry said, “I mean they need someone who knows people and knows how to market their stuff. Everyone can sell it, you need to get the people into the shop.” Ron smiled at that, moving another piece on the board and checkmating Harry.
“Draco,” a voice called from their right. When Harry turned he saw Blaise and Pansy sitting there. They were both dressed perfectly. Blaise in a suit, Pansy in a nice flowing dark red dress. Harry was glad he was wearing these clothes. The two approached the table, Draco’s smile slightly forced.
Harry just laughed, “well, what can I say, I have a soft spot for her.” He looked back at the paper, “yeah, I’m definitely getting these.” He grabbed a pack of envelopes that went with it. “You think I need some ink for this?” he asked Draco, “I could buy some nice dark green ink?”
The man behind the counter looked Harry up and down slowly. “You can just pay, sir,” he said, smiling cheekily, “just let me take off the tracking spell.” He walked closer tapping every piece of clothing with his wand. He smiled at Harry. “Would you like to pay cash, or will you transfer it from a Gringotts account?”
‟Are you kidding?” Pansy asks, ‟I´m going to spoil my godson rotten.” She tackles Draco in a hug, giving Harry a kiss on his cheek afterwards. ‟Colours though, tell me.” She pauses, ‟no wait, why choose if you can just buy both.” Her eyes light up.
There were screams around him. Voldemort and Harry looked at one another and started circling each other. “I don’t want anyone to try to help.” He called out. “It’s got to be him and me. It has to.”
“How are your lessons going?” Blaise asked. “You mentioned that you were going to start taking extra classes?”
“Very well, it seems like you are competent enough for this at least.” Snape stood and went to one of the cabinets that were stocked full of potions, and grabbed a flask. “We will use veritaserum for this session, and this session only. That way everyone here will be able to trust the words, and no one will be able to even lie through the spell that Potter’s friends has kindly written down.” With the last words he looked into Harry’s eyes.
Around midday The Weasleys left again, going to their own home. Hermione and Ron stayed, as they would join Harry to the potter manor the next day.
The blond starts to look even more confused and turns to look at the table behind them, where Harry's friends are all looking at them. “I’m sorry Potter, but what do you think you’re doing?”
“I think they might need some time to process what happened,” Draco answered. “But they could never hate you, Harry,” he said. “You still want to buy the snake today?” Draco asked. Harry nodded.
“Hey Harry,” Hermione said, “let’s go down.” Harry nodded, walking with the two of them. They sat down at the Gryffindor table. Seamus and Dean already eating. Harry looked over to the Slytherin table to see Draco there already.
“Well, it’s hardly stealing if the objects were from the school and I think Dumbledore would have wanted us to have them, or he’d have cast a spell that didn’t let them be summoned with a quick Accio,” she said, crossing her arms. The boys just laughed at it.
“You’re telling me there is a Dragon roaming around Britain?” Charlie asked. The trio nodded. He started laughing, “that’s amazing, you guys freed him. That’s awesome.” The group laughed.
This totally wasn't me, actually wanting to own a snake but not being allowed to because my father is scared of them. Totally not.
“Yeah,” Harry said, smiling at Draco, “I want to be part of his family.” He turned back to look at Hermione, “Besides, I don’t even want to be a Lord. Not one that actually has to take care of a whole family. I want to be able to take care of Draco and help him, but I have no need to have my own seat in the Wizengamot, nor do I need all this money for myself.”
“You would cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory,” Harry encouraged him. Letting silence fall between them once again.
After dinner, Harry went with the Weasleys to the living room playing exploding snaps. Harry had wanted to invite Draco but he knew that the others wouldn’t appreciate that and he couldn’t really force their comradery. And when he looked back, he and Draco had a brief moment of eye contact, and Draco nodded and smiled, showing that he didn’t mind being alone with Sirius and Remus for a bit. Mr and Ms Weasley had gone up to their room to do some reading and talking, so Draco was left in one room with only Sirius and Remus.
Hermione opened her mouth, probably to ask more educational questions, but Ron stopped her, asking instead, “do you love him?” he asked.
“I’m just going to tell the others the kind of pins you are wearing so they can look if Draco has something the same,” Hermione said, leaving the room. She came back with golden earing's dangling from her ears and necklace on. Ron wolf-whistled her, which caused her to blush, “pansy said I couldn’t be the only one not wearing gold if you two are. They made sure to add the same to their outfits.” She turned to the box grabbing a pin that did not have a chain on, pinning it to Ron’s jacket with a smile. “Blaise was wearing one,” she said as an explanation.
Instead of an aisle in the middle between the row of stairs, there was a long path from both sides of the arch leading into the hedges that were lining the field. The hedges themselves had gold and silver ribbons lining them.
“Really?” Draco asked, “is it a good thing?” Narcissa nodded. “About the revealing ceremony, when do you suggest the ceremony should take place?”
“Yeah,” Harry said, “I think he’s looking for something. And Gregorovitch had it, but it was stolen by a younger man. I recognise him from somewhere but I don’t know from where.”
So, some actual book plot. I decided I wanted to do at least a version of a real lesson. Though I specifically left out some things, so that the group had some things to discuss. Especially with Draco's knowledge about certain things.
That night, though he had a great day before, though he was lying with his husband next to him, plagued Harry with the memories of the war. The forest, so close to him, just out of the window, plagued him. It was 3 in the morning when Harry woke up screaming. It wasn’t the first time, but it was bad, very bad. Draco was next to him, holding him, whispering nothings into his ear.  He whispered with the practised ease of someone who has done so many times. He was whispering into his ear that he was alive, that Hermione was alive, that Ron was alive, that so many people were alive. It was over.
Sirius walked past the groups of gold, walking to a small book that was placed on a table. The others stood around him, looking at the pictures on the table. “These are all the art pieces the family owns,” Sirius explained, “there’s an enchantment placed on the pages, when you choose the one you want, you only need to push some magic into it and it will appear on that table.” He pointed. “I wanted to find a nice painting for in the hallway.” The group nodded. Together they looked through it Remus and Draco giving their opinion. Harry just looked around, not really interested in the art. He saw a wall with scrolls and another wall with all kinds of objects.
She leads them across the village until they arrive at a long line. ‟These were the older houses, around which the village is built. Don´t think they are being sold though.”
“Uhm, well,” Harry said, “part of it has to do with something Dumbledore told me. But most of it is that I really know nothing about them? I mean I know they were at least part Indian, enough people have told me that, but that is basically all I know about them.”
They started running as fast as they could. But they didn’t know the place they were, not really. It was a place Hermione had once camped with her family. They ran but it soon became apparent that the group could not outrun them. They turned to cast spells. But there were more of them than there were the three of them. They caught Ron first, and Hermione only managed to get out one more curse before she too got caught. The spell caught Harry, not the person behind him, but when Harry felt his face change, he realised that was the intention. He’d never been able to get away from them. The force of the spell had knocked him down.
“The room of requirement,” Harry said. “Neville found it,” he explained. She looked at them, but they didn’t proceed anymore, not wanting to tell her where it exactly was.
Molly and Ginny, who hadn’t warmed to Draco, were looking with more scrutiny, as they did not like Fleur either. Remus was looking between the two with rapid interest. They were ushered into the dining room, where it seemed that Kreacher had prepared a nice meal. Ever since Draco was there he had been better with the food, and with his mood in general.
Harry was happy to have been able to get some of the energy out of his body. He had not been used to sitting around listening to lectures again, so getting some time to move was great. After an hour they called it to a stop.
“What?” He asked, confused. His confusion must have been very evident on his face as Sirius and Remus laughed slightly, though he could tell they were nervous.
“I see,” Riddle said, “well done, you might be of use after all.” He walked forward, the group parting for him, “tell me, can we attack tonight?”
“That is something we have enough time to think of, though,” Draco said, “I think we would need to know more about which properties we both own to even think about that really.  There are some nice  properties in France that we could use, but who knows what you own.”
The next weeks go well. There are some bad days, many bad nights, but they all manage. They talk with each other, and Harry and his friends are as close as ever. Draco has been completely accepted into the friend group.
“Oh, just asking if we would want to move our stuff into one room. And she had some questions on the bonding itself,” Harry said, “I’m gonna pack my stuff,” he said turning to Draco and giving him a quick peck on his cheek. He wasn’t used to being able to do that yet, but it did feel great to be able to.
“Okay,” Ron said, “I have to admit, that was a bit creepy.” The others looked at him, “the way he just changed from English to Parsletongue.”
Harry looked up at his friends. He realised faintly that he hadn’t told them about the mirror. But it didn’t matter they knew now. “You heard him, Hog’s Head it is. Maybe we can find a way to land into it. If not we’ll have to land close.”
“How would I even get them?” Sirius said, laughing, “did you forget that I am a fugitive, little cousin?” Sirius had picked up using that nickname for Draco, showing people that he had accepted him.
Draco smiles, helping him with the books. They put them in the bookcase without order again, moving around. Harry sings along softly, moving dramatically when the guitar solo starts. Draco laughs, watching him. He doesn´t stop, continues singing and dancing around. It´s a sight, with his baby bump and the air guitar, and Draco falls just a bit more in love with him.
They sat in silence reading, just existing. They both didn’t realize how much time had passed until they heard the bell faintly chiming, signalling it was time for lunch. Ron turned to Harry, “you want to go back to the castle, get some food?” he asked.
Draco rolls his eyes, walking out of the common room. ‟Did you say you just bought a house?” Ron asks from his place on the couch.
‟Though we´re only doing that after the baby is born,” Draco says when Harry´s friends´ eyes grow. ‟But don´t forget the fact that our NEWT´s are also in 8 weeks.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, “I don’t think I would want to start immediately, I like what I’m learning now, and I could always take the other classes at another time,” He looked over to the door, “besides, Remus is still the DADA teacher, so I would only be able to teach it when he stops.”
When they approached the common room, they saw the Fat Lady, “is it true,” she asked, “is Dumbledore really?” Harry nodded, she let out a wail and, without waiting for them to tell her the password, swung open. The common room was packed, he saw Seamus and Dean sitting in a corner, which must mean the dormitory was empty. He grabbed Ron and Ginny’s arm, believing Hermione would just follow, and dragged them up to their room.
Harry wakes up in their own bed in their own house, and he smiles. Draco´s already out of bed, which is not that strange. Harry feels the empty spot next to him and the bed is cold already. The door opens and Draco walks in holding two plates. ‟Morning love,” Draco says.
“Right,” Hermione said, “that way if he has something that can help us he can tell us through him! They are only two portraits of him, one in the headmaster’s office and one here!”
“Merlin, yes” Harry breathed out, “can I?” He wanted to ask this time. Because not only was he awake enough to actually know what he was doing, he also knew that he didn’t want this to just be a peck.
Both Hermione’s parents came up to them as well. “It’s great to finally meet you again Harry,” Miss Granger said. “Our daughter explained everything during the summer. And I am glad that she could help during the hard times you all had to endure.”
“What do you think your lot’s doing,” The barman said, turning to the tree. He pointed to the stairs, “go down there.” They did as they were told. “You’re lucky,” he said to the group, “someone told me you three might be coming here, and to keep my door open for you all.”
They sat down in the front row, all in the set of robes that the house-elves had put on their beds the night before. They were not very different to the set of robes they all wore to class, but they were a deep purple, matching the schools colour. They all had a dark purple pointed hat on, they only wore the black ones during the feasts and the purple ones had been added to their cloaks.
This time it´s Harry´s turn to frown, ‟I, uh, I head some headaches? But I thought that was just because I haven´t been sleeping very well. Is something wrong?”
“Now that that is known, I feel that there is no more time to explain the situation, as most of you need to go back to work.” Dumbledore looked over to Sirius and Remus, “I think I should like to speak to the house owners before we depart back to Hogwarts.” With that the room slowly became empty, some people passed Draco, shaking his hand and thanking him for helping them. Tonks stayed behind to be able to talk to Draco alone for a second.
“We suspected that,” Remus said, “that’s also why you didn’t apparate here. As long as you aren’t of age you can’t move through things controlled by the ministry, as that might give them a cause to arrest you.” Sirius nodded.
Together they walked towards the dungeons. It didn’t took long for Malfoy to realise that they were going to his godfather. He knew that Snape was a spy for Voldemort, but as a spy he had to pretend that he was spying on Voldemort. He had no idea where Snapes loyalties lied, he only knew that apparently he was trusted enough that even Potter knew about Snape.
‟I found out yesterday,” he says, ‟but we had an actual appointment with Pomfrey today, with a check-up and all.”
Draco nods. ‟It can´t be here soon enough.” He kisses the semi-exposed bump. ‟Let´s get some food in you,” he says, ‟you heard the doctor, foods important.” Harry laughs letting Draco pull him off the bed. He rights his clothes, tucking the picture safely in his pocket.
“Yeah,” Draco said, “it was really beautiful. When I asked, you said you didn’t know if you wanted to live there. But now it sounds like you do.”
He walked over to see the boy looking at a row of books, grabbing one. “When and where.” He said, wasting no time, nor beating around the bush. Harry was grateful for that.
“He,” Sirius said, “is an order member, and will be treated as such.” He looked over at his Godson, “he will be staying here for a few days, to make sure all of you can act civil and also will be able to act like enemies at school.” He looked over at all the people. “the thing is, all the rooms we had redone and that are possible to be slept in are all taken,” he looked at Draco.
The two had a conversation, one about the past, what Riddle had been doing, though he gave no indication what it was besides that it was pushing the boundaries of magic, dark magic, Harry gathered from the fact that Dumbledore said he would never understand the magic of love.
‟It was pretty cheap,” he says, ‟it used to be McGonagall’s house, so it was pretty fast. If we had to go through an agency it wouldn´t have been this easy.”
And harry did, he told Draco about Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Molly and all other people that are usually around Grimmauld place. Draco listened intently. Harry did not speak for long, but he told about the things they did as far as he knew it.
Draco shrugs, ‟you looked so peaceful sleeping,” he says, ‟and I love you.” He smiles sitting next to Harry, ‟do I need a reason?”
Back in the cottage Harry duplicates the flyer a few times and cuts out the colours he likes. He enlarges them and sticks the squares to the wall. When they´re done Harry writes down how much paint they need and in which colours. Pansy and Ron offer to go get it and Harry is more than happy.
Draco opened the door for Harry, letting him walk out first. Draco followed closing the door. They had woken up late, already almost too late for breakfast, they hurried down to the common room. Hermione and Ron were waiting there. When they saw them they moved towards the door.
“Well okay,” he said, “I can accept that, now give me, I want to look at it.” Hermione gave it to Ron, who looked at it. “I’m guessing it’s not destroyed.” He said sullenly.
“Run!” Ron’s voice rang out behind them. “Snatchers! Run!” Ron came running towards them, both teenagers saw a group of men running behind Ron.
After Draco finished his hair he turned Harry around, tying his tie for him. He stepped back, looking Harry up and down, “you look great,” he said. He looked at the watch he was wearing seeing it was already eleven. “We should leave now if we want to take our time with lunch,” he said, “we’ll have to Apparate because using the floo will get soot everywhere and mess up your hair again.”
Draco shoots Pansy a look, ‟what?” she asks, ‟I´m not saying he´s fat, just that if you didn´t know he was pregnant it could possibly look like that.”
Harry winches, ‟more the other way around.” There is a stunned silence before people start talking loudly.
“Hey,” he said softly, walking over to Harry, “are you ready to get eternally bonded to me?” he asked. They had spoken over the mirror about this many times, and both agreed that it was best to perform the bonding immediately, as they could never be sure that Draco could stay for long.
“Yes,” Sirius said, “but I also know where it is, and I can side-along Remus and Hermione. And Draco can side-along Ron and Harry.”
“Why can’t you look Kingsley in the eye?” Ron asked, confused. Harry and Draco both turned a bit red. “Oh god, what did you two do?”
“Yeah,” Remus said, “honestly hadn’t expected any different. Your family has had a vault at Gringotts for over a century. They won’t just kick you out, just because you broke in.”
“Kind of depends on you finding the person your parents appointed the right of naming you an heir to.”  Neville clarified. “That person would need to give you the right to become the legitimate heir.”
‟I know that in my heart, but then I try to tell you and I just,” he takes a deep breath leaving his sentence unfinished.
She complimented everyone when she saw the potion. “Well, that will be all for this class today, please bottle a sample of the potion, write your name on it, and I will grade them all.” She said, “homework is researching the potion you made and writing an explanation of how the potion was created.” With that, the bell rang and the group left the classroom.
Draco had talked, it was a bad summer for him. After getting the mark he had to stay close to his mother and the dark lord. He had seen things that he could not unsee. When he admitted that he too could now see the thestrals Harry saw tears falling from Draco’s eyes.
‟I don´t mind,” Harry says for the umpteenth time. He rolls his eyes towards Ron, ‟he´s not that bad, he did apologise for everything.”
‟That´s cheating love,” Draco says, enveloping Harry from behind. His hands immediately worm their way under Harry´s shirt resting on Scorpius. ‟No helping your father with his exam,” he tells Scorpius, ‟He can do it on his own.” Harry gives him a mocking look.
They smile and tell him they aren’t mad. They just hoped he could feel like he can tell them everything. And Harry smiles and does, telling about their dates, and their growth. And they listen and smile because Harry is back, and that is all they ever wanted.
“I don’t understand why Dumbledore gave us these things, and why he didn’t just tell me to take the sword with me the last lesson? He knew he would die, why did he have to be so mysterious?” Harry asked.
I just wanted to add some fluff, the boys are going through so much, and no one trusts Draco, but he's slowly apologising for his horrid behaviour. He has a long way before Ron and Hermione will forgive him. But at least they will be working together now.
Teddy babbles something that Harry doesn´t understand and when he looks up to Andromeda for a translation, she´s smiling at him. ‟He likes you,” she says, ‟you´re good with him Harry. I think you two will be great fathers.”
“Who is it you speak of,” Amelia said. She leaned forward, interested in the story. Harry worried for a second, much like Draco did, though he saw that Amelia was acting. She did not seem surprised by the information she was getting.
Draco in turn told more and more about himself, about who his friends really were, about Pansy and Blaise. And how he felt when he was in his common room, alienated from everyone and anyone, because of his status as Death Eater, which everyone seemed to know, even though most of them actually believed in the Dark Lord. How he felt that he could only trust a few people with the real him, the one that liked to read and the one that liked to draw. He told Harry what it was like to be in a house that was filled to the brim with pure-bloods, most of them even coming from the sacred twenty-eight.
They walked out of the room after a few minutes, both relaxing before they would enter the chaos. It turned out that it was not much of chaos. When they arrived in the Great hall he saw numerous people lying on the floor. Most sleeping, others talking softly with the people around them.
“Then why won’t you show them!” Draco says, “is their opinion more important than you’re fucking happiness?” He shakes his head, “I’m not asking you to tell the world, to tell the prophet. I just can’t do this,” he says spreading his arms, “I can’t sit here, waiting for you to come home only for you to show up telling me you were roped into another date.”
‟You three look like a proper family,” she says. Draco and Harry briefly look at one another, before turning to Andromeda. ‟I´m glad you two found each other,” she continues, either not noticing the exchange or ignoring it, ‟I must say I was a bit sceptic until your mother confirmed it.”
Harry took a deep breath, “I’ll show you first,” though he usually drew on a specific memory of his parents, after having the feeling of happiness inside of him he drew on the feeling itself, not focussing on a specific memory. He didn’t need to speak the word, they had been learning non-verbal spells the last few weeks, and Harry was quite good at it now. He drew the spiral and felt his Patronus coming out of his wand. Though, the stag he had expected didn’t show, instead a creature that he did not entirely know corporealized. He was mesmerised by it. It looked like a combination between a bird and a snake.
By the time that it was almost new years eve, Harry was setting up a schedule with his private lessons with Hagrid. On the day of the party, Harry and Draco arrived at the burrow before most, having told Molly that they would help with setting up. They stepped through the floo, to arrive into the burrow, people walking around.
They stood in front of the floo, Draco’s hand on Harry’s lower back. “Ready?” Harry smiled, nodded and together they were whisked away to France. Harry didn’t know how the rest of the week would go, nor the rest of this year nor his life, but he knew that he would always have the love of his life by his side, and that was enough.
Draco was fucking into him with hard, deep strokes, causing him to move farther up the bed. Harry moved his hand up, bracing himself on the wall above him. The other was raking over Draco’s back, undoubtedly creating little red lines. He could feel Draco was close, his thrust becoming slightly more erratic.
The boys sat in the chairs that were left open waiting for one of the adults to speak. “Harry, Draco, good to see both of you.” Dumbledore started, smiling at both of the boys. “We all know why we are here, so I will cut to the chase. We are here because we all want to help Draco with his mission. For that I need to know Draco, what you have planned for me.”
Ron and Hermione look at one another, and Hermione covers Harry´s fist with both her hands. She doesn´t pry the box out of them, she just holds his hand between hers. ‟How long have you been dating him?” she asks softly.
Draco nodded, “here you can see that there used to be more properties, but that your family sold them.” He pointed at the crossed-out addresses. “They probably sold them because they weren’t of any use.” Harry nodded along listening to Draco intently. “We might be able to visit your manor somewhere before New Year.”
Then it moved, evidently, his parents were dead, Dumbledore asked him to help him protect Harry. He agreed, he would protect Lily’s son. The memories continued through the year, most of them about Harry or the dark lord.
‟I love people not recognising me,” Harry says with a bright smile, ‟It´s refreshing people not constantly thanking me.”
He shakes his head dispelling the thought again, ‟yeah, it´s early, but I don´t care. I was ready to take Teddy until Andromeda told me she´d wanted to raise him. So, I´d already expected to be at least a father figure.” He smiles, thinking of his godson.
Slowly Draco kissed down Harry’s back, kissing the scars that were present from Harry’s past. Giving his attention to everything he could as he slowly moved down. Harry’s breath hitched when he felt Draco’s breath over his ass. Slowly Draco started to work him open with his mouth, causing Harry to let out a string of moans and groans. When Draco pushed his tongue past the tight ring, Harry, unconsciously, pushed his hips back, making Draco moan and the reaction.
“Yeah,” Ron said, “we apparated like every three days at max. It gets really exhausting, but now we can do it in our sleep I reckon.”
Harry nods, ‟yeah, I think so too.” Harry´s friends give him an exasperated smile when he and Draco stand before them. Neville makes enough room for the two of them to sit, and Harry smiles gratefully. ‟I´m thinking of selling Grimmauld place,” he says, ‟but I wanted to ask Andromeda and your mum first since they lived in the house as well.”
“Just be careful, Harry, I heard Romilda Vane wanted to put a love potion for you to date her. There are many other girls that want to do that, so be careful which girl you date.”
“Still like shit,” Harry said, “but it’s a bit better.” He looked at Ron smiling, “I have great friends, that helps.” The two looked at him smiling. “Food?” he asked.
“You can tell them,” Draco said, “I’m really happy that you can at least hide things from Granger and the Weasleys.” He shook his head slightly.
“Eh, two out of three, and at least you got the parts I like,” Draco said, “I count it as a definite win.”
“Harry,” Hermione said, grabbing his hands, “wizards have no stigma against homosexual relationships. They don’t believe in the same religion as modern England and the rest of the western world does. Besides, they don’t even have a law against same-sex marriage.”
“Be happy Harry,” James said one last time, “that’s all we want for you, to be happy.” Tears were falling down Harry’s face, but there was a smile. “If you want to know more about us, about your family, I left my books, my diaries as Lily calls them, in the library. I hope you can love this house, and build your own family if that is what you want.”
‟I am sure you both have a lot of questions,” she says, ‟but I want to do an intensive diagnostic spell now, so I can see all I need about the foetus.” Harry nods, ‟just sit still for a moment.”
The school year has officially ended, wow! now they will only have to kill the Horcruxes. But with Draco and Snape still on their team, how long will it take?
“Yeah,” Harry said, “he was going to see if Sirius could come, so they can duel as well, see how that is, compared to Draco and me.”
“Maybe we should do it here,” Ginny said looking around. They were standing at an opening between three piles. “Close your eyes,” she said to Harry, “That way you won’t know where I’ve hidden the book.”
She nodded, “I, uh, actually got an invitation to work under Shacklebolt. A lot needs to change in the ministry, as there is much bias still against Muggles and Muggleborn. Though,” she said, looking at Draco, “I now realise there are many things I did not know about the ministry and its workings.”
Harry did not have to answer that as Hermione interjected before he could, “Oh Ronald, do you not remember why they stopped? Honestly, if they had used this spell Snape and Harry wouldn’t be inclined to gossip about each other and they can do this is a form of peace.” She looked at Harry, “at least try this time Harry.”
They mixed the political heavy conversations with some conversations about their wedding. Though Harry and Draco both wanted to wait with most of the preparations for Sirius and Remus, knowing the two would want to at least help. They did research on different rituals that they could perform.
With that the group disbanded, Harry walked over to Draco. He was nodding and shaking people’s hands, thanking them for their congratulations. The people didn’t bat an eye at the fact that Harry was there. They were all focused on Draco, and when they talked to him, it was in relation to Draco.
“I agree,” Hermione said, “and something like that doesn’t necessarily have to reach the professors. I mean we all know there are enough things that the professors could only guess at. Especially if it is something that people think should stay a secret.” Ron and Harry nodded at that.
Harry smiles when they´re in bed that night, he feels happy and loved. And with his fiance at his side, nothing can go wrong.
“Blimey,” Ron said, “Horcruxes, six. And you destroyed one in your second year.” He looked at Harry, “and another was destroyed by Dumbledore.”
“I, Harry James Potter, promise to love you, Draco Lucius Malfoy, forever, in every way I can. I, too, promise to lend you my strength,” harry copied the movement of Draco, another red string left his wand, curling around his hand.
“Apparate?” Draco suggested. “Or we’ll have to wait for the floo’s to open up and floo home. But there is always a long line at the station.” Harry nodded.
Still high on his win, Harry goes to their Room, when the door opens a laughing Draco stands there, “You won,” he says opening his arms for Harry, “I won,” he says, kissing Draco and laughing. And if after that night, in the morning, Harry has some problem sitting down, he blames it on the Quidditch game, knowing full well that that is not why.
Only Professor Snape had ruined his sanctuary for learning about his parents. The first time Harry had entered his classroom, he’d been eleven and had left red-faced and thoroughly humiliated. Snape had practically drug James Potter’s name through the mud, trashing whatever image of his father Harry had managed to create on such little information. He’d felt surer than ever that his aunt and uncle were right about his parents.
“Yeah.” Harry’s smile was soft and overflowing with fondness. They walked the rest of the way in a comfortable sort of silence, their intertwined hands swinging between them.
that helped me the most. Just being with people you trust. People who have your back, no matter what. It
He reached Draco’s common room door and- taking a deep breath- knocked. It opened almost instantaneously, and Harry was met with none other than Pansy Parkinson and her assessing gaze. Harry smiled, having expected no less.
“I know it’s dark right now, I’m sure the fire alarms scared you, but you’re okay. Just breathe with me, alright? You’re safe, I promise, sunshine.”
Every time Harry’s knuckles brushed against his skin, a thrill of pleasure shot through his veins. When the sweatpants had dropped to the floor, Harry hooked two of his fingers in the elastic band of Draco’s briefs, tugging Draco closer to him. Draco couldn’t help the sharp breath he took, the feeling of Harry’s fingers on his sensitized skin nearly overwhelmed him. Pleasure shivered down his spine and goosebumps appeared on his pale skin. He felt dizzy, like the smell of Harry, the feel of him touching his skin, had all gone straight to his head.
Harry pursed his lips, fisted the fabric of Pansy’s shirt in his hand, and counted backward from ten in his head. By the time he looked back up again, he realized that Hermione had already started scolding Ron.
After clearing the stairs and dashing down the corridor, Draco came to a skidding halt at the door to the northern common room. The fire alarm had miraculously stopped its shrieking calls.
Wednesday, Thursday, and the first half of Friday passed without incident. Harry had spent them primarily with Draco, Hermione, Pansy, Blaise, and Theo, whether it was eating lunch together or studying in the library, whatever time he had away from football practice, classes, and before curfew was spent with them. He taught Pansy how to braid Hermione’s hair—which in turn helped her braid Blaise’s, who was secretly pleased with this new development—he talked with Theo about football, it turned out that he’d always wanted to try out for the school’s team, but hadn’t thought he was good enough. Harry informed him of an opening spot,—Angelina was graduating early—and tried his best to encourage him to try out. The best he got out of Theo was a strong “maybe”.
Harry was running on air, sprinting through the clouds. Not literally, of course. At the moment he was running off the football field, drenched in sweat and what he was sure was a stupid grin plastered on his face.
“We exchanged numbers after dinner last night. I suppose she wants to make friends,” He felt Hermione stiffen before she said, “You don’t think that Ron will ignore us much longer, do you? I tried to sit next to him in the common room yesterday while you were out with Draco, but he wouldn’t say anything to me. He wouldn’t even look at me, Harry. He’s being so… soo… argh!” She groaned. Harry leaned down and kissed her hair before murmuring, “I don’t know, ‘Mione. I haven’t talked to him since he… blew up at us. I don’t know what’s going on with him.”
After a few minutes of silence, Draco could hear the evened out breathing of the others in the room, a few snores every now and then. The other boys had fallen back asleep. Draco looked back up at Harry, only to see his eyelids heavy and drooping. He could feel his own head throbbing with how little sleep he had gotten the night before.
"No matter what, if we have candies and we're all together, we're going to be okay." Ginny added to the conversation, finishing it.
"I don't want you to get hurt... i hate having to participate of this, Cedric." His voice broke a little and the said one tightned his grip around Harry.
"Yeah, but he is participating, which means we'll have to wait to see who dear Cedric would miss the most amongst all of us." George said and they laughed at his fake annoyed tone.
"So... what is going to happen?" Draco asked, looking around everyone. Lucius sighed and caressed his son's back, before saying:
Of course, he didn't tell any of them about the constant pressure he felt on his chest; he didn't tell them about how his heart was always beating so fast he was scared it would kill him somehow; he didn't tell them, he felt already so guilty about making them all worrying about him so bad, he didn't want to make it worse.
Harry felt so in peace at that moment. Like he could actually breathe and just have a good moment with the person he loved the most. He liked that feeling.
Harry felt that tight feeling on his chest again. That stupid feeling that prevented him from breathing, from feeling safe.
"No! I got this. This... stupid thing, i can do this, just wait a bit." Harry mumbled, and at the same time, a little stronger wave of wind flew around and the blanket - again - got out of place.
It had been two hours since they started reading. Draco read most of the time, seeing how it was helping Harry to relax and how it helped him to sleep.
2) Umbridge is going to be more of an addition during the FOURTH YEAR, that is, during THIS story.  In the fifth year (next story), she will appear much more, and it will not be for good reasons, no! Really far from it, actually.
"Hot chocolate and that salty muggle thing you like?" Draco asked, while he and everyone else started adjusting their positions.
Harry finished writing his letter and took a deep breath. He seriously hoped his family wouldn't freak out because of what he said about the attacks.
"That's too soft. I'm not a soft person. Ew." Pansy said suddenly and they burst into laughter. In fact, yes, she was a soft person, but only with the people she loved, same as almost all of them.
"You scared the shit out of us, mate. For a second i thought about getting Madam Pomfrey or literally anyone, but Draco got here and started talking you down." Blaise said, he moved from where he was standing and went to Harry's bed, he sat on the end of it and Theo did the same, but he sat a bit closer to Harry.
"We have to go." Draco said and Harry nodded. The boy took a deep breath and kissed his boyfriend quickly, before holding his hand tightly as they walked out of the room.
"Honestly, your relationship it's, literally, a life goal. I mean, if i don't have a relationship like yours, i don't even want it." Pansy mumbled while putting a piece of cake inside her mouth.
"Hum... morning." The blonde said while he yawned and he sat up, looking around. Everyone was almost falling back asleep. He looked at Harry and held his cheeks softly, before pecking his lips calmly.
The blonde sat by his side and put his hand on his cheek, he caressed it softly and kissed Harry's lips. It was a passionate and soft kiss. It made Harry feel good.
"I'm not gonna die, I'll just probably get out of the task with my ass burned out." And yeah, that wasn't that much comforting, but it made Draco and everyone else laugh, that was enough for the moment.
"You're so gorgeous. Bloody hell." Draco said and in a fast way, he picked Harry on his arms, the smaller boy put his legs around his hips as they kept kissing and as Draco pressed his body against Harry's, making the other boy moan softly against his mouth.
"It, hum... it provides the person who uses it an airtight chamber of oxygen, it's the best option and spell for breathing underwater. If that makes sense." Luna explained calmly.
"You... fuck, i don't know! I got out of the shower and they were trying to talk to you, Theo was freaking out, Blaise was trying to make you focus, you were hyperventilating and you just... you weren't here, Harry. You were... your eyes, your eyes were so distant, love. I was so fucking scared." Oh, it had felt even worse than it sounded.
"Yeah, but now they have the chance to study and learn about the task too." Hermione said while eating a pudding Luna gave to her and everyone else.
Draco, in fact, did not. He, same as Cedric, Theo, Ron and Pansy stayed awake almost all night, thinking about the whole situation, the five of them were exhausted.
"Good. Okay... okay, i believe you. But you know you can always talk to me, to any of us, about anything, right?"
He noticed when Cedric got there too, he looked at the people there and after a few seconds, he swam closer to Theo and started holding the boy. He looked at Harry and they nodded at each other, then he left.
"No drama tonight, not tonight, please." Neville said while looking through one of the book sections and they hummed in agreement.
"What histories can we read tonight?" Theo asked while adjusting soft pillows and blankets he and George had "acciod" around the floor with Hermione and Cedric.
"You are more than capable to succeed this task, Harry. We know that." She held his hand again and squeezed it softly.
When they arrived where they wanted, Draco put his guitar on the ground and looked at Harry, who was having trouble adjusting the blanket they brought, on the ground. The blonde tried to hold back his laugh, seeing Harry was, literally, swearing to the blanket - the poor thing didn't even know what was wrong, but Harry apparently didn't care about that detail -.
Everyone loved Harry, literally everyone. Everyone was protective over him, everyone just wanted to see that boy happy. So yeah, everyone was going to freak out about the situation.
"Huh, right, people are looking for you two, you mostly, Harry. The tournament will start in thirty minutes, they want to talk to you first." The boy sighed and Draco put him on the floor.
"I freaked out, i really didn't know what to do. In a second Blaise and I were talking, then i heard something and when i looked at you you were glaring at the ceiling, you were breathing so fast i thought you were... hell, i thought you were dying, Harry!" Theo said, he was shaking. His hands were shaking, the clear sign of how nervous he got because of... whatever had happened to Harry. The boy stayed in silence, his eyes were focusing on the floor while his thoughts were far from there.
He felt a touch on his hand and he looked down, seeing the girl was holding his hand, sitting in front of him, a patient and not even a little bit scared look on her eyes. She seemed calm. And honestly, that made Harry feel a bit better. Seeing she was so calm, it meant everything was okay, right?
Harry stopped the kiss as he rubbed his lips down Draco's jaw, starting to kiss that spot, one he knew was a sensible one for the older boy.
4) I will write smut, BUT it won't be so explicit (since i prefer to write a soft and fluffy sex rather than a harder and savage one). But, yeah, I'll write it, although it will be only in the next history.
"I loved it, angel." Harry got closer to the blonde and put his hand on his cheek, before bringing Draco's lips closer to his and starting kissing the other boy slowly.
"Do you want to talk, Harry?" The boy only shook his head and she smiled softly, an empathetic look on her eyes.
Harry took a deep breath and rested his head on the top of Draco's, who was laying against his chest, his head on his shoulder. The brunette kissed the top of his head and he felt Draco grabbing his hand, so he could hold it on his own.
I've actually been avoiding talking about it with anyone, but i had some kind of... attack, a few weeks ago, - I'm fine now, i promise, don't worry - but Draco said i should let you, dad, Sirius and Remus know about it, he's worried about me. He's going to write about it to Cissy and Lucius, he just wanted me to tell you first. I started researching about mental health, I'm reading a book - it is really big, there are so many pages, and I'm honestly really into this book - and i found out about a few things that might be related to that "attack" i had. I panicked and scared the shit out of Draco, Theo and Blaise that night. And i - literally - panicked.
He could hear voices around him. He couldn't understand anything they were saying. Why couldn't he understand anything? Why did everything sounded like he was underwater? Why did his lungs hurt? Why was his heart beating so fast? Why couldn't he focus on anything? Who was this person in front of him?
After saying that, they all started talking about it. About the kinds of Dragons they could fight, about how they could fight them, what they could do.
Staring at the ceiling, Harry took a deep silent breath, feeling his entire body as if it was made of rocks, he felt so heavy, like a huge weight was pressing him down.
His friends were okay, too. Cedric was okay. Theo was okay. Everyone was fine. For fuck's sake, they were all okay. Harry felt like he could finally breathe.
"Do you want to talk, Harry?" The boy only shook his head and she smiled softly, an empathetic look on her eyes.
The boy stood up, his legs were shaking and his lungs were burning. He ignored the calls of his friends, he ignored the scared looks they gave him, he ignored when someone touched him. In fact, that made everything worse, if felt like their touch burned him.
On Monday morning, they walked towards the great hall, going to the Slytherin table where their friends were.
"Love...?" His own voice sounded so raw, it hurt to speak, it hurt because his throat felt like someone had strangled him, although nothing had happened.
"I think now, more than never, we should keep an eye on Harry... he'll need our support and we have to be there for him." Ron said while Pansy said a "accio hot chocolate" and five mugs showed up on their hands.
"You're lucky i love you more than anything." He muttered in a fake annoyed voice and laid by his boyfriend's side, back hugging him.
"Great then. What we're gonna play tonight?" Cedric asked, filling his hand with popcorn and then throwing it inside his mouth.
"What happened?" Neville asked, they all noticing Harry's red eyes and how concerned Draco and Cedric appeared to be.
The boy sighed silently and stopped in front of a book, he grabbed it and stared at it. 'Mental Health: disorders, diseases and what we need to know about it' was the name of the book. He opened the first page and decided he was going to read that. He wanted to know - to understand - what was happening to him.
"I... I didn't put my name there. Draco... love, i didn't.." it was the first thing he said soon as he calmed down, and Draco only kissed his lips softly and then hugged him tightly, caressing his hair. He rested his head on the blonde's shoulder.
"She's warning you that if anything happens to my godson, things are not going to be pretty, specially because if there's someone who can change the tournament rules, the said person is you." Remus said.
"Unfortunately, there's apparently nothing we could do to take Harry away from the tournament." He said coldly, while staring straight into Dumbledore's eyes.
They stayed in a comfortable silence for a few more minutes, before Harry glanced at the table and asked in a low tone:
"Only one!" He heard them saying, but he couldn't do that. He couldn't leave the girl there. So he let go of both the girl and his boyfriend's body, he saw how they floated back to the surface and then, he noticed more creatures swimming towards him. They held him, held every part of his body, they wouldn't let him go, they wouldn't let him get out of there.
Draco laughed, before putting his arms around Harry's waist and bringing his body even close, if that was possible. He then, quickly changed their position and made Harry lay on his back and he stayed on the top of him, both his arms on both sides of the younger one's head.
Both boys spent all the weekend together, seeing their friends only during breakfast, since they had lunch and dinner together outside or at the room of requirement on Saturday and Sunday. They also slept in the room of requirement, wanting to enjoy time together as much as possible before the start of the week.
They were all at the library, Draco, Hermione and Theo were reading books; Cedric, Neville, Luna, and Ron were writing something - probably homework -; Fred, George, Ginny and Blaise were talking about a new prank they were planning and Pansy and Harry were talking. About the first task.
"There's only four more days, I'm fucking shitting myself." Cedric said, receiving empathetic looks from all of them.
He kissed Harry's lips and then hugged the boy again. They stayed a few minutes in a heavy, but comfortable silence, before they heard their friends approaching.
"You're safe now. You're here. I'm here. We're safe." The blonde muttered, more to himself than to anyone else. He felt so scared after Harry ran away from the library.
"When we find out who put your name there, dear, this person will be already a dead one." Narcissa said while looking at Harry, then, she hugged the boy and kissed his forehead too.
"That's a interesting one. I'm trying to find a fantasy one, Luna was reading it last week and it seemed to be really nice."
"We'll be okay. I promise. Now that i can actually think about, it will be a bloody life experience. The tournament and everything."
"I really want the sunlight to come soon. We have to talk about this bloody tournament with our families and I can't wait for them to find out who did this to Harry. This person can already be considered a dead person." Draco said while he gently stroked Harry's hair.
"So, Theo's the second person you'd miss the most, huh?" Fred said, breaking the comfortable silence around them.
He saw his friends there too, they were all looking at him and he noticed how they were all holding themselves from hugging him too, letting Draco do it first.
He made a decision and swam towards the girl. He grabbed her body and held it closer to his. He tried to swim again, but something held his foot and when he looked down, he saw a creature holding him back.
Harry felt so in peace at that moment. Like he could actually breathe and just have a good moment with the person he loved the most. He liked that feeling.
"I love this idea. It's been while since i last listened to one of your songs. I miss them, they're always so sweet."
"Same, mate. We all know she hates Harry the most amongst all of us, we don't know why, but she does. And she's always looking at him with that creepy and disgusting smile on her bloody ugly face." Draco subconsciously tightned his grip around his boyfriend and pressed his lips on Harry's head, leaving a kiss there.
He loved the feeling of home that Harry always brought to him. Harry was his home, he was his safe place, he was his favorite place.
"I knew you'd won. And i told you. Multiple times, in fact." The other boy looked at his eyes and a soft smile appeared on his lips.
"I thought about maybe just going to the lake, we could sit there, i could play a song with my guitar and sing, we could dance, eat a lot, kiss a lot. I just want to spend a great day with you, just us."
"You're with us again?" The boy only nodded, not noticing the concerned looks Draco and Cedric shared.
They always asked when it was about Harry - since the boy tended to always bottle his emotions down and keep everything to himself - but a quick look to Cedric and they could see that he and Harry had talked, so they wouldn't stress the boy making him talk about it again.
"Well, hello." Draco said, trying to hold back his laugh seeing how Harry couldn't barely breathe between James and Sirius and both Narcissa and Lily rolled their eyes.
"Yeah, i thought about him too. I don't know why, but i always had a weird feeling about him." They all knew what he meant.
"I love you." Harry smiled and put their lips together for a few seconds, before pulling apart and looking at Draco's eyes.
"Who wants chocolate frogs?" Neville asked all of a sudden, breaking the comfortable silence the room had fell in.
The tournament was not going to be any easier from now on, but they had each other, they had their friends, perhaps they were going to be okay.
Everyone else was out too, some went to Hogsmade together and others went out with their families or something.
"Harry's host is Draco, right?" Hermione asked and everyone looked at Harry, who nodded while grabbing a chocolate frog from Ron's box.
"Right? I mean, imagine spending an entire weekend with the person you love the most, doing all you both, or more them two people, i don't know... that's not the point! But just imagine... fuck, that's romantic and cheesy as hell." Blaise said, a funny look on his eyes.
In the next seconds, the library had all the pillows and blankets they always used for those nights. A warming spell was cast in the room and it had a comfortable temperature now. Luna and Ginny made the hot chocolate as usual - their hot chocolates were the best ones - and Fred and Neville made the popcorn. They made the popcorn just appear in the room, but it tasted great.
The man walked back in after some time, looking at both of them. He nodded, walking around the two. He moved forward, “I’m just going to check how everything fits,” he said, moving his hand over Draco’s shoulders and feeling at his waist. The man nodded again, doing the same with Harry. He nodded again. “They fit well, and they fit each other well.” Harry and Draco nodded in agreement.
The welcome back dinner was not extravagant, as that had been the Christmas dinner already. McGonagall asked everyone that would be testifying in the upcoming trials to stay behind, so she could talk to them.
“As you should,” Remus said, “most wizards take a year break before going to work. It changed when the war started, but it really is a good idea.”
The next morning they asked Sirius and Remus if they could speak to him. They looked curious, but they didn’t want to ask them specific things with everyone there. They seemed to understand and told them to meet them in Sirius’ classroom during lunch.
‟Yes,” Harry says, sitting up. ‟He´s your son as much as he´s mine. And I want him to know that. People won’t be able to think it´s something shameful that he´s your son as well if he has both names.”
‟Honey, we´ve broken more laws than we can count,” Harry tells her, ‟Hermione is no goody-two-shoes.” He smirks, ‟but there is a good chance she is blackmailing her.”
“Well,” Remus said after a pause, “that is some protection.” The three smiled, though it was a bit forced. “can anyone tell me, what are the uses?” They went around the room talking about the protective charms the trio had all mentioned. The rest of the class went on, talking about protective spells.
He walks over to Draco the moment he´s let go, the examiner promising that she´ll take his circumstances into account with the grading. ‟How´d it go?” Draco asks.
“For me, it is the same, though I know Draco’s family, one doesn’t come from France and doesn’t know the Malfoy’s, ‘is family apothecaries are everywhere,” she said smiling at Draco.
Harry nodded, moving so he was leaning against him. Darsh was slithering on the table, looking at Harry. After a few minutes, Sirius came to them, sitting on one of the chairs before them. He had three cups of tea and pieces of Chocolate.
“Harry,” Molly said, when he walked over as the last of them, not sure how to act around her. She grabbed him, pulling him into a tight hug. She looked over to Draco, standing awkwardly beside Harry. She hesitated, before pulling him into a hug as well. It was a bit awkward, but they managed.
She just nodded, as did Ron. Draco remained stony-faced and silent. “Do you know when you will go?” he asked.
‟They´ve known each other for a really long time,” Harry tells him. The food appears on the table, and he looks around, ‟he always kept an eye out for her, as much as he could at least.” He spots some curry and pulls it towards himself.
Harry had told Draco more about himself than he had ever told anyone before. He had told him about the Dursleys, how they treated him, how they acted around him. He had told about the nights he had lain awake, with pain in his stomach from the lack of food he had received. He had told him about the pain he had, he told him about everything that happened to him during his stay in Privet Drive. He was happy to almost be done with all of them. Harry would only go back to his aunt and uncle until he was 17. When he turned 17 he would be able to live wherever he wanted, that’s what Dumbledore had told him, and Harry wanted nothing more than that.
When he knew the Dursleys would move away as well, he told Draco of the plan. Draco in turn talked about the fact that it seemed that Riddle knew about the plan. It seems someone had leaked it, and the plan was now known to them. Draco told Harry, that Riddle had taken his father’s wand, and that he had told them all that he would kill him the day of the move.
The four of them all went to the eight-year common room. As usual, a small party was happening, though at this point the parties were more get-together only with booze, than a real party. However, that is what everyone liked. The group sat down with the people already present, joining the game immediately.
“Not that this conversation isn’t interesting,” Hermione said from besides Ron, “but we are here to work on those NEWT’s you mentioned, so I suggest opening a book?” Ron and Harry rolled their eyes, grabbing their stuff. Hermione who had been facing her book the whole time smiled, she still found ways to make her best friends work.
‟Babe,” Draco says turning to Harry, ‟I wouldn´t eat that if I were you.” Harry frowns, Draco knows how much he loves curry. Draco holds up two fingers, ‟there´s Cocos in there, and spicy food will probably worsen your nausea.”
Draco laughs, ‟great to see you too, the ride was okay, only took two and a half hours,” he jokes. ‟Switzerland was fun, great to see other stuck up rich people like me again, after spending time with you losers.” He ruffles the hair of one of the kids he´d helped last year.
“Oh,” Harry says with a smile, ”I’m not going to Grimmauld.” He pauses and looks at Draco, “at least, we don’t live in Grimmauld, do we? You said I moved in with you.”
‟She won’t need extra pressure in her life. Make her godmother and she´ll feel like she needs to raise the kid,” he says. ‟But one per person is better.” He frowns. ‟I know Ron is my best mate, but I think Neville would be a good godfather.”
“We know some,” Draco said. “Harry could disband the family, he could give up his title as lord, and become a Malfoy. However, that would mean that the Potter name would die, and basically everything that goes with that. Including the contracts in their name. He could accept his title and become a Lord, and we would be married, but we would not share our family,” Sirius winched, “yes, it is very unconventional and well, if I am honest, it is not something I would want. However, it would mean the Potter family could continue, even if it was only for a little while.” Sirius and Remus nodded. “The last option would be combining the families. We would both become Malfoy-Potter, and I would be the Head of the family, and Harry would be Lord as my spouse, not as head of the family.”
The way Twycross had said that reminded him of what he had said only hours before to Draco. Harry looked around to see people concentrating intently. He saw Ernie Macmillan focussing so hard he had turned light pink as if he had been holding his breath. Harry laughed slightly, turning his focus back on his place.
“Sometimes I wonder,” Harry whispers, “would we have been friends if I had grown up with them? Would we have gotten this,” he said, lifting their joint hands, “faster? Or would it have made it impossible?”
“You have a week,” Draco says, “A week to start the conversation, to start telling people you’re bi and in a relationship.”
They caught a lucky time, many students were now lunching, so the hallways were empty. They caught a stray student, but they never got held back or spoken to by someone. When they entered the common room, they expected it to be empty. Instead, they encountered Ron and Hermione inside.
“I now speak directly to Harry Potter. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait one hour in the forbidden forest. If at the end of the hour, you have not come, the battle commences. But I shall join the fray, I shall find you, and anyone that has ever tried to conceal yourself from me shall die. One Hour.”
Harry loved hearing about them, even though sometimes it made him miss them only more. Miss the fact that he had never gotten the chance to get to know them, never had the chance to figure this out with them. But he was grateful for the stories, for the fact he could at least talk to people who had known them. He wondered if he would have been raised bilingual if they had been with him. If they would have taught him their flowing language.
‟I know the gist of the war,” he says, ‟I know Neville was something of a hero in it. Together with Harry and his friends. Even the squibs know of the great Harry Potter.” Draco frowns, ‟I also heard you say that Harry testified on your behalf. I know that if you really did something bad the ministry would never have given you a second chance. I only know the you that you´ve shown me Draco, and that is a bloke who might be pretentious as shit but who loves people. Who doesn´t care if someone´s a muggle or a wizard? You invited us here, even though you know we´re muggles.”
Lucius appeared in the courtroom, much like Dolohov had appeared when Harry had watched the memories of Dumbledore in his fourth year. There was a bar around him, keeping him closed in. He was tied to a chair, his hands secured to both armrests. His hair was almost grey and his face sunken in. Harry heard Draco breathe in sharply. He took his hand, hoping it would help him a bit. Draco squeezed Harry’s hand in thanks.
“I keep forgetting you know nothing of pure-blood traditions,” Draco sighed, pulling Harry on his bed, lying next to him. “When a pure-blood wedding bond is formed, the two, or sometimes more, who are bonded will be able to feel each other. They are connected by the mind and magic.” Harry looked at him quizzically.
At first, I contemplated if I wanted to keep the story per book, but I decided I want to write till the end of the battle in one story. So, here is the beginning of book 7, hope you all like it!
“You guys look great,” Seamus said, “are you wearing eyeliner, Harry?” All eyes turned to Harry who was nodding but looking a bit nervous. “Looks good, would look like something Sirius would do,” which caused everyone to nod their head in agreement.
When the bottle landed on Harry, it was Neville who could ask the question. He looked contemplative, “what is one of your kinks?” It was a question many people had been asked.
Harry scowls, ‟taking a fuckton of magic to grow.” He shrugs, ‟I should be happy I have such a big reserve, no way I could´ve gone to classes as well if I didn´t.”
The trio discussed it, in the end, they decided that they would have to give the sword. But they would say he would get it after they helped them into the vault, they wouldn’t tell how long after. The group started planning or the break-in.
,” a voice came from the back, Harry couldn’t quite place from where, but not wanting to be rude he answered.
Ron nodded, “it’s worse than last time,” Ron looked back at his friends, “has it been this bad the whole time and was he just really good at faking it?” Ron asked Sirius pain in his eyes.
“It’s going to be weird going back there after we broke in,” Ron said. The rest nodded, snickering, “you guys staying for dinner, mum made extra just in case.”
“Harry, why are you only back so late?” Hermione demanded as soon as had sat down. “We have an important lesson tomorrow.”
Draco was still for a second, before deciding. “Continue,” he said, “please.” Harry chuckled, leaning to kiss Draco, who smiled into the kiss. Harry moved back again, prepping himself while kissing down Draco’s body. When he arrived by Draco’s cock, it was awake again, proudly standing up. Harry chuckled, having expected nothing less, though he moved around it, careful not to touch the leaking cock. He kissed between Draco’s thighs until he was ready.
With everyone gone, the energy in the rooms had become relaxed. Harry and Draco walked down the stairs holding each other's hands, and they felt at home in a house that was not theirs. “you know, Sirius,” Draco said, calling out to the man walking behind him, “why don’t you guys hang some of the black art pieces around the house? There are many beautiful art objects that would go really well here.”
The bell rang, signalling that they would need to go to class. Dean helped Seamus up, Draco doing the same for Harry.
“Molly’s been hounding on Ron and Hermione, but they didn’t say a word either,” Remus continued, “don’t think she will rest till you three are gone.” Harry nodded. “You have to stay here till you are of age, after that you will apparate with us to the Burrow for the wedding, they wanted to have a small party for you, so we will go there the day of your birthday.”
Harry nods, ‟can we talk? Somewhere private?” he asks looking around. He sees Draco walking into the common room. His emotions are hidden behind his mask.
“I was planning on doing it during our Christmas break,” Harry said. “I was planning on looking at the properties as well. Try and, I don’t know, see how they lived.”
They happen again though, fifteen minutes later, and the feeling is worse. Harry flinches, his hand going to his lower stomach. ‟Dray,” Harry calls out. The pain isn´t gone when Draco comes into the living room. ‟I think I´m having contractions.”
McGonagall had kept Harry updated on the things that happened around Hogwarts, just as she had promised. A big clean up had started there, it consisted of volunteers and teachers, all working hard to clean the school up and make it habitable when the new year started. With the help of the castle itself and the house-elves, it seemed that everything was in control. Harry had offered to help, but McGonagall had said that that was unnecessary and that he should relax now.
When Harry showed him what he had thought of the man burst out laughing, clapping Harry on the back, and adding ten points to Gryffindor. Hermione was livid, not happy to be bested by someone, for doing almost nothing. When he looked over at Draco he saw that Draco hadn’t been much better off than Hermione, but he at least looked mildly amused at Harry’s antics.
He told Kingsley about the snake, how she had killed Snape, and how Snape in his last breath gave Harry his memories. He paused, taking a breath.
Harry saw the look in Draco’s eyes and saw himself in the other boy, “okay, maybe that’s enough for today,” Harry said, Draco looked grateful for it. “Even though it’s important, we have time to talk about this.” Draco looked fragile and Harry felt the need to give his new found friend a hug. “Draco,” he asked softly, “can I give you a hug?”
‟You´re not the only one allowed to have a secret sex life. Rest assured mine won't end in an unexpected pregnancy.” She flicks her hair.
‟Of course,” Draco says instantly, ‟if you want me there, I´ll be there.” Harry gives him a relieved smile, kissing Draco softly. When they part Harry pulls Draco close again as he lies them down on the couch.
They sat beside each other on the couch, Draco pulling Harry against himself with an arm around Harry’s shoulders. “Ready to go and live in our own home?” he asked the brunette.
The boy in question looked up from his book when Harry entered, giving him a dazzling smile, standing up to give the other boy a kiss. Harry had to stand on the tip of his toes to reach him, but it was well worth that.
“Of course we’re sad,” Sirius said, “you two are leaving this house. But we’re also happy because you two are doing what both of you want.” He paused, “And besides, you’ll be popping over every week, we won’t have time to miss you.”
“Love,” Draco said, patiently, “you were speaking in Parsletongue. How do you not realise you start talking an entirely different language?”
The second day, was almost as worse. They were all waiting in anticipation, though they too discussed what they might want to do after they find the locket, Though they had no real clue what that would be. Halfway through the day, the telltale crack of apparition could be heard in the hallway. The three stood, all running towards the hallway hoping it was Kreacher with Mundungus. But the three skidded to a stop when they saw Draco standing there.
Kingsley listened with rapid attention to what the four of them had to say. Harry told the story, as they had decided. He started with Voldemort’s life, explaining his obsession with his family, his history. Then he went on to his obsession with the dark arts and how he wanted to be able to live forever. When Harry came to the Horcruxes the minister looked shocked.
Draco is on him the moment he steps into the room, patting him down as if looking for injuries. ‟I´m fine, love,” Harry murmurs.
“Yes,” Hermione said, at the same time Ron nodded, “now, give me clothes to pack Harry, and anything you think you might need to take with you. I have the books and other things like potion ingredients.”
“Hey love,” Draco said, sitting next to Harry, “shall we go to the kitchens?” Harry nodded, knowing he didn’t need to explain. He pulled the cloak around the two of them, and together they went out of the room. Even though there was no curfew for eight years, Harry didn’t want to bother any of the teachers that were patrolling the corridor.
“Did you forget, Harry, that you have already destroyed one,” he opened his desk and pulled out the book, with the hole of the basilisk fang. “That means there were only five left. I,” he said, pulling a wrapped cloth from his desk, “managed to destroy another.” He let the piece f cloth fall on his desk, opening it. Harry recognised it immediately, which Dumbledore saw, “you recognised that correctly, the ring of the Gaunt’s.”
Draco nods, ‟it´s a bit last minute, but I also wanted to ask my mother to Hogsmeade. She said she wants to meet you again, only now as my fiancé, not you know arch-nemesis that saved my life multiple times and tried to kill me just as many.”
‟You say that like it´s nothing,” she says. ‟I remember when Nymphedora told me about her engagement. She was over the moon.” She chuckles, Harry smiling. She blinks, looking at Draco with Teddy. ‟He looks like your son with those locks,” she says with a small smile. ‟If I need to take him just tell me.”
Harry and Draco both immediately nod. The doctor does, giving them two sheets of paper, their baby on there. ‟Would you want to hear the heartbeat again?” they both nod again and a few seconds later the heartbeat of their child is filling the room again.
‟Don´t worry,” Draco says softly, ‟she´s probably just going to do a general check on you and give you some potions if your nutrient level isn´t okay.” Harry gives Draco a look, ‟you know I want to go into healing, I´ve started reading some things.”
Draco stepped forward, “we are here for formal wear,” he points at Harry, “we will be going to the Yule Ball at Hogwarts, and would like something to be made for him.”
He looks out of the windows dreamily, he doesn´t even know it´s the right way towards the house. ‟It has five bedrooms,” he says, ‟and a shed that could be used as a workroom. Two bathrooms, and a beautiful ground floor with a separate dining room, living room and kitchen.”
Ginny snorts, ‟maybe if you hadn´t immediately brought him to the Gryffindor table after walking in hand in hand,” she says.
When he arrived back at the castle he felt his luck disappearing. When he arrived at the Fat Lady’s portrait the woman was very grumpy and told him the password had changed, and if he didn’t like that he would have to speak to the Headmaster. When he complained that Dumbledore was not with him now, Nearly Headless Nick, pointed out that he had heard that Dumbledore had just arrived back at the school. Harry ran towards the Headmaster’s office.
Draco shrugs, ‟I don´t think it would confuse muggles that much really,” he says, ‟trans people exist.”
