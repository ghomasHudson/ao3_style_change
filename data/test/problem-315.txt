"You're awake. How are you feeling?" Lily asked, kneeling down in front of him so she could take in his appearance better.
Haley had an idea. And before she could overthink it, she slid out of her room and stopped Simon, who was about to enter his own.
Malfoy scowled. It was oddly reassuring to see that he could still scowl at her. Softly chuckling at the sight, she took off the cloak. The scowl turned into something more soft instantly.
he was. Draco yawned. At least it didn't seem like Diggory was in there with them. Diggory, Diggory, egg, egg – wait, did they say egg?
Confusion had always looked cute on him. She felt a nostalgic surge of affection rush over her. "Why don't you sit down for a moment?"
"You're not actually a vampire, right? You were just kidding?" She bit her tongue but it was too late. The words were already out. Malfoy stared at her for a long moment that seemed to span several minutes. Then, finally, he broke out into loud, roaring laughter. A wave of relief washed over her. Of course, it had been a stupid joke. She was such a fool. He rolled off her and lay down on his back next to her. She wanted to scowl at him but his laughter sounded so carefree and light that she smiled softly instead.
"Mum, why…? Is that Professor Snape?" I ask, nodding toward the man in the back, who I now notice looks as young as mum. "And did you just call him
Luna shook her head. "I don't know if it's normal… everyone… probably has their own way of coping. My mum died years ago and I still miss her every day." There was a tinge of sadness to her voice. Usually, she was so… bright and carefree.
"Well, I'd be happy if it was someone with more brains and... well, alive," she conceded with a chuckle.
He ran his hand down his face, sighing. "Say, you convince him," he offered, "What then? Is he going to help my family, too? My mother? My father?" He paused to glance at her sceptically. She didn't look so determined now. She said nothing. Of course she hadn't thought that far.
"See you after lunch!" She called back, filled with a sudden excitement. Running off with Malfoy like that felt exhilarating somehow. Even if she was ditching her friends for him. Or maybe even because of it. It was one of these things that seemed silly until you tested them out yourself.
Honestly, she started to sound more like Ron's mum by the hour. Haley shared a look with Ron, who gave a shrug. He looked just as tired as her.
"Um – no. Must have seen it somewhere else," he replied hastily. Amazing. That strategy always worked.
"No," she whispered almost soundlessly. His gaze lingered on her thick cloak for a moment before he looked away again. The silky robes he was wearing didn't look too warm.
How come it came so easy to him? But maybe it wasn't. Maybe he was also picking up all the courage he had. Funny. It almost seemed he was more of a Gryffindor than herself.
"I'm saying, all of that is in the past." She grabbed his other hand as well, willing him to direct his undivided attention on her. "I forgave you for bullying me. I want… us to start again. I want to get to know you for real. And… for you to get to know me, too."
Haley swallowed back a sob. He looked so dejected. She walked around the table and approached him cautiously. Like he was one of Simon's kittens after playing around too much and getting wounded and defensive.
. Haley sighed, wondering if one of them would ever make the first move. Her eyes wandered back to the Slytherin table.
As the chorus starts up again he turns to me and winks. Then he continues to sing but this time he does this thing that musicians sometimes do where they kind of just enjoy making music together. He continues to play, never averting his eyes from me. And in that moment it seems like he's just
Haley smiled. His concern was kind of sweet. "It's okay. I can always go down to the kitchens later on."
Even though the three friends ran all the way toward Hagrid's hut, they ended up late. The good thing about running was that it prevented Hermione and Ron from asking questions. Fortunately, they arrived in time to see Lavender and Parvati vanish into the woods.
"He's probably in his dorm, having a first-year deliver him food. He's not been in the Great Hall for a day. So what? Honestly, don't you think he can take care of himself? He's a wizard after all."
"Do you like it?" He asks, noticing my wonder. I nod absently, before sinking down against the wall next to him.
She'd get another chance to tell him. Luna had said the interview wouldn't be published until another two weeks. There was still time.
At the end of this verse a fairy plucks some of the strings, adding a lovely melody. Woah. I want a fairy like that, too!
? What use is a wand if it's not reachable? Honestly." Haley mumbled, fetching her own wand from the back pocket of her jeans. She looked at it for a moment before sticking it back in her pocket. "You're right. It
Huh? Was she maybe sending unclear signals? Was he misunderstanding the waves of fury rolling off her?
Huh? And her whole body sparkles! Skin, hair, everything! That in itself might be unusual but nothing too extraordinary. We're witches after all.
"Oh, please call me Lily, dear. Mrs Potter makes me feel like an old lady." Lily replied, seeming slightly flustered by his antics. "I've heard a lot about you," She told him, before turning to her daughter. "But how come you never told me, he was such a charmer? Whenever you mentioned him I kept imagining some brute who threw around ice cream all day."
Lupin added, "Look Haley, what you've got to understand is that your father and Sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did – everyone thought they were the height of cool–"
Haley leaned a bit closer, trying to catch a glimpse of his face. But all that was visible of his head was his blond hair. And all around the edges of his dark robes, she could see a sea of used coffee cups. Had he drunk all that coffee? Had he even slept?
But then her eyes found the small lump underneath the sheets on Simon's own bed to the left. She released a sigh in relief. Then she cautiously tip-toed over to the bed and squeezed in next to him, lying down on top of the covers.
"Exactly," Simon said, nodding eagerly. He was trying to tell her something. But Haley was at a loss. She inspected the gloves closely.
She couldn't eat the cupcake! Then her whole plan would be ruined. Her whole clever plan of waiting in the dungeons at nine o'clock when she should be up in her own tower, doing her homework or getting ready for bed. But no, she was down here in the cold, waiting for that prat of a Slytherin because her naive little brother had given her the idea that sweets solve everything. And apparently, she was stupid enough to actually give it a try.
Haley narrowed her eyes. Fine. He wanted her to play with the big guns? She could do that. Where would his clever remarks be, when she told him she knew he had a crush on her? A reckless feeling, she associated with all of the tales her dad always told her about his school adventures, filled her up. Was this what it felt like to be a true Gryffindor? She opened her mouth to speak… and closed it again.
He watches me, cautiously, like he's afraid I'm going to attack him. When I do nothing but glare at him darkly, he raises his left hand and – fast like a snitch – wipes the ice cream from my cheek.
Her arms hit the wall on each side of his head and she leaned in to silence him with a kiss. Apparently, she had lost her mind. Why else would she have resorted to such means? But at least he was quiet now. And he wasn't smirking at her in that annoying way. In fact, he wasn't doing anything. It seemed like he had turned into an ice sculpture.
Lying on the floor, the kid held a struggling golden snitch between her fingers. "That's the… the seven-second snitch!" She said breathlessly, her eyes wide with awe.
"Blond looks good on you…" He breathed. "It goes well with your eyes." His heart skipped a beat. Did she understand… what he was playing at?
Snape answered with a smirk. "Very astute, Draco. Let us say, something like that happened. Would you or the person who wrote this", he nodded at the instruction, "have an idea how to… reverse the effects brought on by that creature?"
After clenching her eyes shut during the disapparition, Haley re-opened them to the familiar and in some cases crooked houses of her childhood neighbourhood.
Swallowing deeply, Haley opened her mouth and said, "Look, earlier today, I-" The girl's eyes widened, her hands flying to her mouth in surprise. Why did her voice suddenly sound like Dobby's?
Now, she knew their relationship was in the past. They'd had their chance. But now she had already given her heart to someone else.
Ron seemed disappointed. He looked back toward the Great Hall longingly. "But… you know… won't Hermione be suspicious if we don't turn up for lunch?"
"But how am I supposed to play on an empty stomach?" Haley whined, opening her drawer to fetch her brush. Only to find… a gobstone instead. The sight reminded her of yesterday's events with the brutality of a punch to the stomach. She touched the stone hesitantly. Like she wasn't allowed to any more. She should probably return it…
"Why won't you say anything?" She asked, facing him now, "What do you want from me, for Merlin's sake! I just don't
"What is it then?" Hermione asked curiously, crawling onto the bed beside her. Haley sat up and rubbed her face.
"Your dad always has the worst influence on people." She mutters, before turning to me again. "My foolish daughter, let me tell you that there is no prophecy like that. You're not a disappointment. Quite the opposite, you're exactly right, the way you are." She gives me a smile that warms me right to the core. Her smiles always have that effect on people.
Who else could she ask? There was a part of her that wondered if maybe she should have asked Draco first, if he was okay with letting her mother know. But then… Haley hadn't even mentioned him in her letter. She had only asked her mum whether she knew anything about the curse he had used.
Haley glared at him. She didn't like that tone at all. And what was he talking about anyway? A surprise?
The boy lifted an eyebrow. "If you must know, I was just on my way to practice. Prefects get certain privileges, but you wouldn't know that." He smirked at her mockingly. "As for the other thing…I'm not a monster. What do you think of me?" He smoothed his hand down his robes and glanced at the puddle. "Besides, if you had fallen into the puddle, you would've splashed mud all over me. I can do without that experience."
"On the bedside table," Haley answered absently, while her mum finished up her braid. It was running down the right sight of her face now, almost reaching her waist.
Haley kept chuckling. She didn't even know why she found this so funny. It was probably because of her tiredness.
"Are you hurt?" He asks, as he helps her up, sounding terribly worried. I clench my teeth. What a hypocrite.
He shook off these depressing thoughts. "Just thinking of ways to make you lose the House Cup." He drawled.
"Wouldn't sleeping in your beds be more comfortable?" Asked somebody curiously. The Gryffindors looked up almost at the same time. Luna Lovegood took a seat next to Haley and placed a huge pile of books on top of the table. The lowest was a book about… dragons? She could only see the last part of the title. Well, it didn't matter anyway.
"What's wrong, dearest brother?" I ask after a moment. He mumbles something unintelligible into his pillow.
"Thank Merlin, I thought – but you said she forgot something in the divination class room – this is already the second time! What if it's something serious? Ronald, you really shouldn't have left her alone when she was like this."
Hermione snorted. "Don't be ridiculous," she replied, rolling her eyes. Merlin, what a preposterous thought.
Draco looked around in alarm. Had someone heard her? He felt the urge to shush the Ravenclaw but he was sure she would just ignore it. She tended to always say what she wanted to anyway.
The words were unsettling her, it was evident from the way she spoke and the way she was frowning at him now. The grip on his collar lessened a bit.
Another time, Haley had found Draco in the kitchen of Malfoy Manor, which had been filled to the brim with eager house elves. The house elves had been making biscuits and Haley had caught the boy sneaking biscuit dough. Once the elves had noticed they had brought them a bowl full of raw dough with extra chocolate chips. They ate so much cookie dough that Haley was sure they would have thrown up all over the kitchen floor, had it not been a dream.
Ron snorted. "Come on, don't play dumb. The secret meetings, the notes, the gloves you knitted for her! And all those times in the library when you visited her or held her hand!"
She couldn’t do it. He wasn’t the Draco from the dream corridor. She didn’t feel as comfortable and light around him. It didn’t make sense. If this had been a dream she wouldn’t have had a problem trusting him with her feelings. She would have told him
Haley still couldn't meet his eyes. She stiffly sat in her chair, silently wishing she was anywhere but here. An excuse. She needed an excuse. But there was nothing in her mind. It was like someone had taken a big eraser and blotted out any sensible thought from her head.
The boy's lips curled up into a soft smile. "So, you like it?" He asked, not quite hiding his excitement.
He might as well have said nothing at all. The girl wouldn't have reacted any more then. His hands dropped to his sides in silent defeat.
"Well… if that's how it is, I might as well go," she said, turning around and taking a step away from the willow tree.
They took their seats in the back as usual where Haley dejectedly let her head sink onto the table and kicked her feet like a three-year-old.
"Yes, mostly." Luna nodded. They both looked so earnest that Haley couldn't fight her own grin any more. Ron seemed to finally notice the state of his two friends.
One positive aspect was how often she saw her godfather and that she was able to spend her time with the people she cared about most in the world.
"So… I'll talk to Ron if you want to. I mean, he's my brother and all but the constant brooding is really getting annoying. And the way he keeps glaring at everyone for no reason is starting to scare off all our potential customers and test subjects."
"The house colour of Ravenclaw. It's blue. Well, and bronze, I guess." The moment is definitely broken.
Haley was grateful he finally found a topic that saved them from that unbearable silence. "Oh… well, we had a little… er – misunderstanding." For some reason she didn't want to admit they'd had a fight. That had mostly been her fault. And that Draco had gone into hiding because of it.
… No… She tried to ignore that voice, chase it away, silence it…Then there was another voice. A boy's voice.
"What is this?" He asked, sounding more than a little confused. "Are you leaving the school grounds?"
I was actually really angry with the English language in this chapter. I had this nice wordplay planned with Ron's tuning fork, which was actually meant to be a baton before but I had to change it. See, in German a baton is called a 'Taktstock' ('beat stick' would be the literal translation). And it works so nicely because beat is actually 'Takt' in German. So the beat stick would have hinted at his tactlessness. I don't know if I explained that well but anyway... it would have been such a great wordplay! Damn!
It was a lovely sight. But she wasn't supposed to laugh with that stupid Hufflepuff! She wasn't supposed to laugh in front of any guy that wasn't
"Hm." She was right. After all, he had told Luna, too. For some unfathomable reason. Or well, she had found out on her own but still. It occurred to him then that he hadn't even considered the possibility that the Ravenclaw might have told someone. But the thought was so ridiculous that he dismissed it the moment it entered his mind. No one would believe her anyway.
"What?" Haley finally looked at him, completely taken aback. She hadn't expected something like that. She hadn't expected him to be this… considerate.
late. And Potter had her loyal friends waiting for her, didn't she? The only problem was that Draco wasn't any more ready to let her go than he had been five minutes ago.
"Gloves!" She burst out, suddenly hit with an idea. "Can you teach me how to make gloves?" The raven-haired girl asked excitedly.
"I'm not a baby," Simon muttered, "I'll be eleven next year. And then I can finally go to Hogwarts, too."
"You're not as wise either." Mum comments, painting a small red rose next to Draco, the little prince.
“They do.” I whisper back. We watch the stars twinkle above us and for the first time I regret that I’m the only one who’ll remember this tomorrow.
Tomorrow. She was definitely going to tell him tomorrow. She didn't have the heart to ruin such a perfect night.
Draco watched her leave in the direction she had come from. Absentmindedly he grabbed the helmet on his head and pulled. His head was finally free! But now it was filled with questions.
was the big secret?" She asks incredulously. For such a little girl, she is surprisingly intimidating.
"-time machine, I know," she continued with a chuckle. He rolled his eyes. Oh, she loved teasing him.
"Your fingers are ice cold!" Potter exclaimed, pulling off one of her gloves and grabbing the hand that had been holding onto her wrist. Her fingers were like fire on his skin. His hand was now sandwiched between her hands; one gloved and one bare.
Slowly, Snape folded his hands on the table. "Certainly not to drink a cup of tea and enjoy the weather. Although I have to say these flower arrangements are quite charming."
"Enough of this," she heard Snape's voice through the swirl of memories. And then she hit the ground again, her heart beating rapidly, images still flashing before her eyes.
Luna pointed to a small note book in Lily Evans' hand. It was maroon-coloured and there was a golden cauldron in the middle of it. White lilies adorned the corners. It didn't seem familiar to him at all. Luna leafed back to the image he'd looked at before. The one with the Slytherin third years.
"Sometimes people need time to get used to something new. Especially when they have been thinking of it in a different way for a long time." She tilted her head to the side. "I'm sure she'll come to to think of you as 'Draco' eventually."
Haley thought about ignoring him and staying where she was just to spite him but… it wasn't really what she wanted to do. She walked the few steps over toward the blanket and sat down on it as far away from the Slytherin as possible.
Strange. She didn't know what to say. It used to be so easy to talk to him. Now, she couldn't find a single word to say.
The girl moved, as if to sidestep him but Draco didn't let her. She moved to the other side but he blocked her again.
Then she suddenly stopped walking, took his hand and placed something small inside it. It looked like a couple of shrivelled up beans.
"So, what do you think of this?" He asked, pointing at their surroundings. "Could use some colour, don't you think?"
"My little pumpkin," Mum soothes, gently brushing the new tears from my cheeks with her knuckles. I feel like I'm five again, falling off my broomstick, my back hurting and the disappointment in dad's eyes hurting even more. Or like when I was ten, and dad chose to go and watch one of Simon's junior quidditch games instead of coming to support my first guitar performance. Or like when I was thirteen and Professor Trelawney told me I had a pretty face but she could see little beyond that in my future. Or like at the beginning of last year when Neville told me he wanted to break up with me for no apparent reason at all. I'm never enough. Maybe I'll never be.
A tirade like that was much more like Angelina. Haley could only quietly nod at her fingers. She didn't even want to begin to imagine what her dad would say, if she was kicked off the team.
"Oh." He hadn't expected that. Not really. But then, it did make sense. "He seems… fiercely protective of you."
"I'm parched," he complains, walking toward a little cabinet in the corner and pulling out two caramel coloured bottles. "Butterbeer?" He asks, holding one of the bottles out to me.
They would probably end up strangling each other. She chuckled at the thought. But there was also the chance that it would be completely different. She couldn't imagine sitting in a café with the boy and drinking tea or coffee like normal people did on a date. It was impossible to picture anything like a typical date where Malfoy and her were concerned. But strangely that didn't bother her too much. If anything it fueled her curiosity and made her want to find out exactly what it could be like.
She calmly reaches into the cauldron, not even flinching, and fetches a little key from the depths of it.
"I'm afraid, the only way to get out is to wait until you wake up," she informs me. She seems disappointed that she can't be of more help to me.
assignment!" He exclaimed in horror. He bit his lips, probably wondering if it was worse to arrive late to Umbridge's class or to be on time but without an assignment. "I should probably go back to the tower and get it. Sorry." He added, looking at her apologetically.
He rolled his eyes but fished a blueberry muffin out of the basket and bit off a chunk. He also kept looking at her. Though his face was softened up by a weird little smile.
"I love you," he said finally, his heartbeat beneath her ear, beating in harmony with the words, completed the song of his heart. He was holding her too tight. She wanted to
Haley wrapped her arms around Draco's neck, trying to relay to him how much she'd missed him, how sorry she was, and how glad she was that he was still here with her just by kissing him. Maybe it wasn't an Unbreakable Vow but she silently vowed to herself that she was never going to risk losing Draco again.
After her shower, Haley quickly got dressed in a pair of tight-fitting jeans and a maroon sweater beneath her thick wine red winter coat. Her hair was piled up into an unruly bun that was still wet from the shower. With her hood in place over her head, her bag across her shoulder and her Firebolt in her hand, Haley finally left the changing rooms. The Slytherins were small green dots in the air. She sighed in relief.
Just as suddenly as he threw himself at me, he’s pulling away now. Grin still in place. It does look nice on him. Cute almost.
. In front of the chimney, Haley was kneeling on the ground. Umbridge stood above her, pulling on her hair, and bending her head backwards. Draco could have fired his own curse at that horrible woman in that moment. Instead he slunk over to them and squeezed Haley's shoulder briefly before fetching her wand from her pocket. Perhaps he'd prefer a pumpkin head over this after all.
"Yeah, um… stupid book." She chuckled nervously, holding up the book she'd knocked out of the shelf. She glanced over to Draco again but his book seemed to be capturing all of his attention.
"I don't want to hear it!" Haley exclaimed, covering her ears with her hands. "I'm not letting you break up with me. You can't just decide that on your own. I won't let you!" The fire in her eyes was threatening to scorch him.
"We need to think of a strategy first." Moody argued. "There are probably much more of them than us. We should at least get some backup."
"I'll continue this essay in the common room. It's hard to concentrate with you constantly talking to me," she said, getting up and collecting her things.
Haley scowled at the reminder. "Yes," she said lowly, "How could I forget that little brat that always harassed my baby brother?"
As we watch the drawings in thoughtful silence, the kitten I drew stretches lazily and strolls from Draco’s pale arm over to my finger which is still touching his skin. It meows and curiously marches over to the owl, the boy has drawn.
Haley tried not to roll her eyes. "It's not a quaffle though. And obviously that wizard didn't want that lord of the darkness to ever get his magic back. So, why would he try to help him?"
Why was he this stubborn? "Fine. Tell me then. What is it you like about me so much?" She raised her chin. A silent challenge.
"Do you know where-" Draco started to say but a soft clucking sound interrupted him. It came from the window. Glory. His eagle owl. What was he doing here this late at night?
"It's pretty." She said, sitting up and looking at one of the light yellow sheets of letter paper he'd practised with earlier. "Don't tell me you've got a secret admirer."
"Oops, sorry." He grins apologetically, rubbing the back of his neck. My brother is useless. But it does feel good to see him again. Even if it's just a dream.
"Nevermind," he said with a snort, muttering something to himself that sounded like 'Witch Weekly' and 'should have known'. How peculiar.
"I don't think you're better off dead – I–" Her voice finally broke and she fell forward, burying her face in his chest and curling her arms around him tightly. "Seeing you fall and then… lying there… I thought you… I'm just so glad… you're okay." In that moment she felt like everything wrong would turn out right if she could just hold him like this, keeping him safe and protected from any kind of harm. "Don't ever scare me like that again."
Once Haley had finally reached the boy that was lying underneath a tall oak tree, she was hit with a strange squeezy feeling in her gut. Never before she'd seen Malfoy laugh like this. Scornful? Yes. Cackling? Definitely. But this? This was different. For a moment she just stood there, watching in wonder. Then she registered, the painful way in which he was holding his stomach and the tears that were starting to roll down his face.
And if anyone knows 'Die Wilden Hühner und das Glück der Erde' (German series), Draco is totally Fred falling off the horse's back and embarassing himself here. Only he falls off a broom. I thought the parallel was funny. And I couldn't help but think of that scene when I wrote this.
With that and a lazy smirk he set the little gold ball free and launched into the air. Haley followed him as she looked around for a flicker of gold. The moon was almost full, providing a blueish glow of light. Without it, the night would have been pitch black. Even so, it was almost impossible to see anything smaller than her own hand with only the moonlight. That included the snitch. But she wouldn't be a seeker for almost five years if she let that stop her. Up there, next to the score board, wasn't there a glimmer of gold? It seemed as though Malfoy hadn't noticed it yet. She grinned, directing her broom with only the hint of movement toward her goal. She had already curled her fingers around the feathered ball, when she sensed movement behind her. She still wasn't used to how incredibly fast her broom was.
"You're not a butterfly after all," he mutters. Then he sits up swiftly, crossing his legs underneath him. His nimble fingers pick me up by the back of my shirt. Oh, the humiliation.
The words make something happen inside me. I should be angry that he resents one of my closest friends – or former closest friends – but instead my insides fill with warmth and a feeling of light giddiness. I want to
Draco was still grinning. "Sorry. I just…" He held up his hands in defence. "I couldn't help it. I wanted to try this for
"Don't act so surprised, Potter," Malfoy said darkly, "You wouldn't expect anything different from a sneaky, evil Slytherin, would you? And a Malfoy at that."
Neville didn’t reply. And Haley was tired of waiting for an answer. So, she turned on her heel and fled. Back into the lion’s den.
Mum raises both of her eyebrows. "I have my sources," she says nonchalantly. Then she grins. "Come on, it was quite obvious. Sev told me about a student who became victim of a curse that takes away magic and asked me to help him devise an antidote months ago. I knew it had to be a Slytherin because Sev only cares about his own students." She scoffs. "And… now that you mentioned the same curse to me… and you're madly in love with a Slytherin… I figured those two were the same."
Some part of her knew that she should be happy for them. That this was a good thing. But as it was, the feeling at the forefront of her mind in that moment was anger. And so, she lashed out instead.
"And?" Haley urged. She twirled the end of her braid around her fingers in anticipation. She couldn't even eat.
"You're you," he whispered, a twinkle in his grey eyes. "That's all. That's why I like you. I can't explain it."
She had just wanted her to be on her side. But she always had to question everything Haley did. "Would it be that wrong to have the feeling that I'm in control for once? To not have to feel on edge all the time?"
Malfoy rolls his eyes. "I want to believe you, you know," he says, poking a finger at my chest. Or at least he tries to because I scoot away before he can reach me. I might look like a guy now but it would still feel terribly wrong to let Malfoy touch my chest.
"No, I didn't," she answered without hesitating. Haley waited for her to say more but it seemed Luna was doing the same.
"They're idiots," was all she said, continuing to slurp her noodles. That sauce was so good. "Who needs friends anyway? They're completely overrated." She complained. Which wasn't true, of course. But it felt good to release her anger in some way.
. You didn't even give me a chance." It almost sounded as if it still pained him. "Ultimately, I thought that it was your fault what happened to me."
"Oh, you were talking about my time machine," Draco chuckled condescendingly, "It may look like an umbrella but that doesn't mean it also works like that."
"It would be a lot easier if I could properly talk to you. Like when I'm dreaming." She reached out a hand and gently stroked the soft feathers. It was comforting in a way.
All night, she had been lying awake, worrying. How could she have been this stupid? How could she let it come to this? Whenever someone looked her way at the breakfast table she wondered if they somehow knew. Did the whole castle know already? She sighed, staring into her cup of tea like it was hiding the answers to her problems.
? After everything you've been through, you deserve to be with someone who doesn't give you any more pain. Someone sweet and kind like… like... I don't know... like Neville maybe."
Monday morning started with pre-exams in potions. For the practical part they were split up into teams of two. Haley partnered up with Neville, while Ron and Hermione worked together on their potion. It wasn't too difficult, seeing as Haley had practically brewed potions with her mum her entire life. She tried to get a glimpse of Malfoy but the Slytherin was all the way on the other side of the room and with the steam filling the chamber she couldn't see further than to the next table. Surprisingly, the boy seemed to be ignoring her. He never bothered her even once. Didn't even glance at her. As far as she knew. Well, that was all the better, right? On the other hand, it was likely that he was simply too focused because this was the pre-exam and he couldn't be bothered wasting his time sabotaging her. Haley was more than okay with that.
Someone sat down in the chair next to him. "That one looks promising," said a very familiar voice to his left. He looked over in surprise where a cheerful smile greeted him.
She suspected it was the fact that she liked potions so much that made him respect her. On the other hand Malfoy, was quite talented in the subject as well… So there had to be another reason.
. He felt as if he was drowning in the sudden wave of affection that was crashing over him, leaving him drenched in nothing but raw emotion. It was all too much. The kissing, the proximity, the sudden overwhelming rush of feelings.
across the top and gave the letter to Hedwig. She couldn't wait to find out what Luna thought of her idea.
"See? You don't even deny it," Neville says with a chuckle. "Look at you. Nobody could ever love someone like you. You're nothing but a pitiful little-"
"I told you, he's a right bastard. You should never have gotten involved with someone like him." Ron grunted irritably.
"What are you waiting for? Take his wand as well." Umbridge instructed, when Draco didn't follow her orders at once.
Right. There had been something in her hand. She'd thrown it into the grass, before leaving. Draco knelt down and started to look around in the grass. With the setting sun it was quickly becoming dark around him but the thing couldn't be far. Then he saw it. It really was nothing special. Just a note. Folded together tightly. He picked it up and began to unfold it eagerly. It wouldn't be cursed, would it?
She watched him expectantly. It seemed almost like she wanted to hear his decision right this moment! What even was he supposed to say? It wasn't like she had told him something new. He had come up with similar thoughts himself after all the time he'd been spending thinking about his situation. Wondering if it was even all worth it. Was his family worth making himself unhappy over? Was his infatuation with Potter important enough to risk ruining his relationship with his family?
Her eyes found his and for a moment, it seemed as if he'd said the right thing. Like she was going to let him in. Or about to start crying again.
." His first instinct was to fling the creature off him. Why was he attacked by all kinds of animals lately? But then he noticed something familiar about the cat. It was one of the ugliest cats he'd ever seen. With a squashed-looking face and yellow eyes. Wasn't that… Granger's cat? And a moment ago, that voice… hadn't that been Weasley? Were the two Gryffindors behind this? He stopped, trying to get the cat off him and instead stared at it, wondering what kind of a dumb plot this was. Were they trying to intimidate him with with a cat?
"I made them," she answered, staring at him with her big blue eyes like she was stating an obvious fact. "They're the same wool as yours. Yeti wool."
But, no. He couldn't do it. The sheer thought was beneath him! He wouldn't sink this low. Not even because of Potter. No,
A delighted smile lights up the boy's face. "Wonderful," he says. Then he looks up at the canopy of his bed, appearing to think.
Of course it had been Pansy. Who else. He should have expected something like this. And where was she now? Hiding in shame? Typical Slytherin. He'd deal with her later.
"I won't." She said simply, an explosion of prickling feelings spreading through her insides. It felt like a promise. But was it enough? No other words she could think of seemed to fit. Maybe there was something other than words that would help her express how she felt. She let her fingers slowly run down his cheek, brushing across his lips with only her fingertips. The boy's eyes closed, a content sigh escaping his lips. Haley smiled. Then she leaned down and kissed him, silently promising that he could trust her and that there was no reason to worry because she wasn't going to break his heart.
There was no one in the hospital wing besides Madame Pomfrey. This was strange. Shouldn't Malfoy be in the hospital wing when he was sick? Haley fetched the Magnificent Marauder's Map from her pocket and whispered, "I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good." As the map came to life in front of her eyes, she wondered why she hadn't thought of using it before.
Haley looked at him as if he was a troll. Perhaps, not the best thing to say to your kinda-still girlfriend who you've been in a fight with and are trying to make up with.
"You know it." Draco said, chuckling darkly. "You know, don't you?" Suddenly, there were tears in his eyes. His lower lip started to tremble and it reminded Haley so much of her little brother that she wanted to lunge forward and hug him.
"Here," he said, turning back to the book he had been reading, before the girl had come to disturb him.
"It's part of a muggle's sport. Basketball. Basically you're meant to throw a ball into a basket. It's a bit similar to quidditch actually." She was getting off topic.
"I could be mistaken, but to me you look more like someone who has finally found the Crumple-Horned Snorkack. That's what is a bit confusing, though. One day you look at her like that and the next you treat her like she is the most horrible person in the world. Why's that?" She tilted her head to the side curiously.
She rolled her eyes, pulling a face. She was so cute. Even with that expression. Draco wrapped his arms around her and nestled his face in between her shoulder and neck. "Honestly, though. I think I could get used to all of that." He whispered it like it was a secret. Which it technically was because he would never tell any one things like this besides Haley. She already knew he was in love with her. What did it matter? She could turn into a troll tomorrow and he'd still love her. Most probably. He could get away with this kind of comparison. It was highly unlikely that either of them would turn into a troll tomorrow. Or on any other day for that matter. Still, the point was, Haley was incredibly cute and pretty and he liked looking at her. But that wasn't the reason he loved her. Not by far.
"We should go to sleep for now," the brunette whispered, squeezing her hand. "Who knows? We might come up with a brilliant plan tomorrow. Don't you think?"
"Oh no! I lost it again!" The boy exclaims, lifting the blankets and pillows around him in search of the little stone.
Mum sighs and shakes her head disapprovingly. "You shouldn't come here too often. Your body can't rest properly in this state of sleeping."
"I'm going to let you borrow my notes this once but don't just vanish the next time. We were really worried when you didn't show up for Charms."
"Fine," Potter huffed, "I haven't started it. Happy?" Draco chuckled quietly. Happy didn't quite cover it. She didn't seem to know how positively endearing her childish defensiveness was. Or what it was doing to him. What
He eyes me, seeming disappointed and a little thoughtful. "Fine. Let's start with being friends, then." He says matter-of-factly. Is he actually
"It may be hard to believe but he's trying, you know? He's trying to be something more than what everyone expects of him." She was obviously trying to stay patient.
But then Haley's attention was captured by the plain black book lying on the table. Carefully, she picked it up and opened it to the first page.
"These are hazardous times, Draco. You must be aware of the fact that both of you are in great danger if you keep seeing her. In times of war it is the people most dear to us who become our biggest weakness."
"There are still some on our end!" Exclaimed a voice from the other end of the Gryffindor table. It was Colin Creevey who was excitedly running over to her, before placing a full tray of treacle tarts in front of her triumphantly.
From his spot behind a tall tree it was hard to understand exactly what they were saying but from the looks of it Potter didn't find out anything new. Instead she was left to clean away the tables. Draco almost snickered. It was kind of amusing. You could almost see the wheels turning in her head, as she tried to figure out how to go about putting away the tables. Maybe he should go and help? Or was that a bad idea? She probably wouldn't let him help. And what would he say if she asked him why he was bothering in the first place?
"Why's that?" Ron asked, confusedly, then he seemed to notice his mistake. "Oh, you mean because that's what people call
Lovegood nodded. "Yes, they're called golems. Sadly, I don't know a lot about them. I was hoping to find some information on golems in here."
Since there has been some confusion about the time lines in the last chapter, let me clear that up for you: So, the part written in italics refers to the present and anything that's not in italics is like a flashback to the past. Or you could also view the italics as a flashforward to the future and anything in normal font as the present. However you like it. ;) So basically what's in italics happens after the stuff in normal font ;) Hope that clears up the confusion!
"They took my ball." My brother cries, throwing himself at his older sister. "They took it and now I can't find it any more. It's gone!"
"How pathetic. No wonder nobody loves you," the boy purrs in a voice that is shockingly familiar. Neville? Is that really Neville's voice? I walk a bit closer so I can get a better look at him. Straw blond hair and a round kind face. It's Neville. But right this moment he doesn't look kind at all.
"It's just-" I tug at my hair, taking a deep breath. "One moment, everything is perfect, right? We get along splendidly. And I'm happy. I haven't felt this way ever since Neville broke up with me… And… I can tell he's happy, too, you know?"
Oh. Was he getting a little too excited? Haley snorted, her lips stretching into an amused smirk. She sat up properly and reached for one of the couch pillows, throwing it at the boy who caught it reflexively. Seeker instincts.
"You brought tea?" She asked, with a raised eyebrow. She didn't know what else she should have expected. Butterbeer? Firewhiskey? Wine? Neither of those seemed more likely. But tea was so…
"There you are," Hermione said, as she was running toward them, "We were looking for you. Ron already found us a carriage. Did you fall down?" She added, after she'd noticed the scratches on her hands.
"Okay," Potter whispered and made Draco's heart sink like a stone that was trying to reach the bottom of the Great Lake. "I'll think about it," she added.
"That doesn't make sense at all!" Haley protested indignantly, glaring at her. "I don't have a 'saving-people thing'! Why is it so hard to imagine that someone could genuinely care about him?" Was she hurt? At the behalf of Malfoy? She jerked away from the touch of her hand.
"Screw them." He said simply, balling his hand to a fist and hitting the table once. "People like that aren't worth your time, anyway."
She pushed the boy away from her roughly, barely noticing the perplexed expression on his face. She turned around, ready to run away. Where were Ron and Hermione anyway?
What? What kind of strange parallel universe had he stumbled into now? Draco eyed the cup sceptically. Then he pulled it toward him. At least it warmed his cold hands.
The boy shrugs again, looking to the side. “It’s just…” He’s blushing for some reason. “When I think of you, I think of someone protective… and strong.”
When he pulled away, he gently cupped her face in his hands and rested his forehead against hers. A soft smile was pulling up the corners of his lips. He looked so relaxed and happy.
"Okay," she started to say, "okay, so… have you ever heard of a spell that… that can take away… someone's magic?" She whispered that last part like it was a shady secret.
"We're not done with that conversation!" Her friend called, as she turned to follow her captain out of the Great Hall. Haley waved at her over her shoulder but didn't reply. If she was lucky Hermione would be too busy with one of their many assignments to even notice her and Ron returning.
"Bandy is very sorry. He will prepare some sweets to make up for it." With that the elf bowed, nose almost touching the floor and hurried back to his fellow elves at the other end of the room again.
Malfoy snorted. "We'll see." He sneered, before stalking out of the Great Hall, closely followed by his entourage.
Rita grudgingly complied, the blonde hair that was hanging in lifeless strands around her face made her look positively miserable.
He cleared his throat importantly, "Well, I don't actually own the table, I guess. But since I'm sitting here, it's my table for the day and since we don't know each other, I thought it quite strange for you to do your homework here. Considering there are plenty of empty seats where you could do so without disturbing people you don't even know."
personal – I couldn't think of anything more personal – I…" She raised her hands, waving them in front of her defensively to emphasize her point.
Hey people! I really like how that chapter turned  out! So much happens! All the angst! How did you find it? I was fighting tears when I wrote the scene with Neville in the beginning... Well, tell me what you think! :) Also I read Wayward Son, finally. It was unexpected but I loved it! Come talk to me about it if you need a place to rant :)
"So, when are you seeing her again?" Luna asked, there was a gleam in her eyes that seemed right-down smug.
"She… found out about something… upsetting." He explained at last. "I'm sure… she'll tell you about it… once she's ready."
"Are you saying that… when someone calls you by your last name… you're not even considered… a friend?" He felt cold seep into his chest.
"Shh. We have a plan, don't we?" She said softly, moving her hand to his cheek and caressing it gently. "And even if it doesn't work out… you're not completely useless. You have a decent voice. You could even become the next Myron Wagtail."
"Nothing," Haley repeated, swiping at her face. "It's just… watching those two… I…" She shook her head. "I… remembered something."
The last part was obviously meant to sound mocking but as Malfoy lifted his grey eyes, looking into hers cautiously, she was reminded of that boy from almost a year ago who had seemed so hopeful and vulnerable at the same time.
The door magically opened and he hesitantly entered the room. Hopefully, nothing was wrong at home. Or even more wrong than it already was.
And just maybe... she could give this a chance. Maybe she could try at least. What would her mum do? Suddenly, Haley was filled with a terrible longing for her. It was time she went to see her. She'd avoided it long enough.
"Nooo!" Haley yelled. But it was too late. She was kneeling on the ground again, not daring to look up at the potion master. It was silent. But for no more than a torturous second.
For some reason Malfoy smirked at that. Then his eyes strayed down to her lips for a moment. Haley swallowed nervously as she realised that he had somehow got incredibly close to her. He stroked his thumb over her lower lip slowly, his touch incredibly soft.
I've always wondered what it would be like if I were a boy. My hair short, black and tousled like dad's and my jaw with a cutting edge instead of a soft curve. And my body? I would have to say goodbye to all my beloved female curves as well. Now, that I feel like I'm finally growing into them.
Draco still didn't know what was best. For himself. Or his family. But it was about time he made that decision. And finally, now, he felt as if he had a real choice.
been playing the wrong song after all! I played the intro of that muggle song about a baby that's plugged in or something like that. I heard it on the radio the other night. How thoughtless of me. Fortunately, I can just try again. Here comes the amazing
"That makes two of us," I tell my fingers. "See, that's why I told you not to start dating. Especially not if it involves your archenemy."
After I played the guitar solo, Myron Wagtail nods in a satisfied way and I open the door. I don't enter right away, though. I need a disguise… But whose face should I wear this time? An image of my mum as a fairy appears in my mind. That's it! I'm going to try turning myself into a tiny little fairy. Mum had been as small as my thumb hadn't she? So maybe it's enough if I imagine myself to be as small as… my palm! My eyes are closed tightly and once I open them again everything around me seems frighteningly huge. It worked!
A Malfoy certainly didn't hide inside a suit of armour! Maybe he could hide behind the armour and… put on the helmet, so his shiny, blond hair wasn't visible? Draco's hair really was shiny and there were plenty people who were envious of its glowing glory. He smirked. It would probably glow even more in the darkness... lit up only by the torches. The rest of him would be hidden well under his dark, bottle green cloak.
"My whole family basically was in Gryffindor. Dad never stops going on about how amazing a house it is and that all the other houses suck and
He cleared his throat. "So, you don't think it's weird that she doesn't call me 'Draco'?" He asked in a disinterested tone. Just to be sure.
"There are some things that we can only find out on our own." There is a hidden glint in Hedwig's eyes that I can't quite place but I'm almost sure now that she knows more than she's letting on.
They stopped in front of the door to Snape's office. All this time Neville had been silent. Silently, listening and taking in her words. Was he wondering how to turn her down politely?
Draco seemed a bit startled by her voice coming out of nowhere. "I can't decide whether I like this cloak of yours or not."
"I just… I was looking for… I tried to find…" She blinked out into the night sky. The moon was hidden behind the clouds. And only a handful of stars were visible. She pointed her fingers to the sky as if she was counting the stars. "It's not there. I thought I'd find him here…" She stared into the sky like someone who'd been betrayed.
"So, you… find it attractive when I'm angry?" She mumbled, trying to make sense of the things he'd told her.
It appears to be night but the sky is alight with countless twinkling stars and fairy lights. And by fairy lights I mean
Mum sighs in relief. "That's good, then." She pinches my nose lightly. "I was afraid, we'd need to start another of those potions."
She bit her lips, trying to ignore the blush she felt creeping into her face. And weren't his cheeks reddening as well? Haley snorted. They had to look like two shy third years who were dancing around each other. A crowd of people was already forming around them, staring at them curiously. She reminded herself that she was the one in control here. She could handle this. Whatever he wanted to tell her. Sooner or later she would have to confront this anyway. It was best to just get that conversation out of the way, she decided.
and see how the little git was trying to worm himself out of the situation. But she wouldn't sink down to his level. Not if she could help it.
Triumphantly, Luna held up a pink quill with glitter all over it. "Could you give this to Ginny? It's hers. I found it in my bag when I was packing this morning. She probably thinks she lost it."
her. The memory made her blush and without being able to stop it, her eyes fell on his lips. It was only for a short moment but she was sure the boy had seen it. His eyes widened and his mouth fell open in surprise. He blinked at her, a soft pinkness colouring his cheeks. Then he seemed to remember where he was. Or who he was, maybe. He hastily stepped back, and looked away from her. Then some of the anger returned to his face.
"I'm coming!" Haley retorted before turning back to Luna, "Are you coming with us? It's almost time for dinner."
Just thinking about her filled him with joy. It made him so happy that he almost forgot he already missed spending time with her. Looking at her, holding her hand.
She felt that much lighter now. Almost as if a dragon-sized rock had been lifted from her chest that had been weighing down on her for ages. The fourteen-year-old girl in her whose heart had been broken all those months ago was finally able to breathe again.
"As if anyone would read that thing just because of some insane mythological creature." Hermione muttered quietly.
"I need to..." Haley chewed on her lower lip, looking for the right words, "I need to make sure first. That it's not a mistake. That I'm doing the right thing." It was hard to imagine a scenario where dating Malfoy would seem likethe
"Your little meeting with Potter and her friends," he said, waving his hand dismissively, "was it good?"
"If it worked like that, the potion should have been enough," Snape explained. "My guess is… that Longbottom has to return the magic willingly. The potion cannot force him to do that."
"I'm not really a fan of talking to air," Draco muttered with a slight pout. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was being made fun of.
. Her fathers group of friends had called themselves like this during their own years at Hogwarts. And before sending his daughter off to her first year of school, James had told her about a magical map, he had created with his friends.
As it turned out Haley didn't have to wait long for an answer. The following day just when she was about to go downstairs for dinner Hedwig soared in through the window with a small package attached to her leg.
"You think you can fight me?" He asked in that mocking tone again, his own wand, gently rolling back and forth in his opened palm. He remembered the duelling club in second year and how quickly the potion master had disarmed Lockhart with no more than a flick of his wand. Although, he was most definitely a better wizard than that narcissistic fool, he suspected his chances weren't much better. His wand would likely be gone the second he drew it.
Ron stared at the girl. Then at his hand in puzzlement like there was something he didn't understand. Haley felt like she was missing something here. Her eyes sought out Hermione's, which were blown wide and glued to Luna as if she was seeing her for the first time. She frowned, her mouth hanging slightly open.
"Right." He nodded, getting the feeling that Luna was more talking to herself than him. Well, as long as she talked about strange branches of magic, he didn't have to think about anything potentially upsetting.
"Maybe… maybe the potion hasn't worked yet." She spluttered, moving her fingers about frantically. "It probably takes time to work… right mum? Right?"
It was awkwardly silent after that. He looked at his hands. From the corner of his eye he could tell she was looking away as well. There were countless unsaid thoughts and questions floating around them. But neither of them was brave enough to give voice to any of their doubts. Perhaps the time wasn't right. Yet.
"Put me down already!" She insisted. The boy obliged, eyeing her warily. She felt a bit more awake now.
Upon closer inspection Haley saw that the cloth was torn apart beyond recognition and you could only guess what it might have looked like before. Haley didn't know why her godfather was telling her all this. But at least it distracted her from the glum thoughts that had clouded her mind beforehand.
Haley bit her lips. Did he think she was stupid? "I haven't," she emphasized. "I haven't even told him about our DA meetings."
"That's mine, give it to me!" Black snatched the object out of the small elf's wrinkly hands. It was a golem.
Malfoy opened his mouth as if to say something but after a moment he closed it again. "I see," he answered finally, not meeting her eyes. Haley got the feeling that Malfoy wasn't good with comforting people. Not that she needed to be comforted but when she had mentioned her deceased mum on the weekend he had seemed uncomfortable as well. He probably hadn't lost someone he loved yet. So, of course it was hard to relate to. Haley remembered talking to Luna about her deceased mum only yesterday. It hadn't been awkward or uncomfortable at all. Perhaps death was one of the things you could only really relate to once you have been confronted with it yourself.
"Then… how'd you find me? We came here quite early." Even before supper had started. That way it was easier to sneak the food before it was sent up to the Great Hall.
"Are you going to go back to your tower?" He asked, interrupting her. She could see his eyes droop, although he still wasn't looking at her. She had the feeling what he was really asking was '
She could have kissed him. But that ship had already sailed, hadn't it? Not to mention how awkward and inappropriate it would have been.
"I didn't think you would give me a present." She admitted, in that way of hers that was neither accusing nor disappointed. She seemed honestly surprised.
"White blond is quite rare actually," he replied, taking a step toward her and running his fingers along her braid. "It's a Malfoy thing." He winked at her in a way that was mischievous and somehow warm at the same time, leaving her strangely nervous. As if there was something he wasn't telling her. He was even blushing slightly. Was it something embarrassing?
"I still don't see why you're this upset. Is your poem that bad? Do you think he's going to tell her about it?"
"Haley, we've been over this. You have to tell him. You can't base a relationship on a lie." To her credit, she was trying to talk quietly. But the sternness in her voice was still undeniably present.
With a sigh, Draco unfolded the note. Slowly. Carefully. Like it was going to explode as soon as the message became visible.
Hey everyone! Writing that last part was a blast. I imagine the two of them to have so much fun. I don't know a lot about painting so i hope it makes sense. Draco painting Haley the way he sees her was kind of inspired by a similar scene from Eragon that I really liked. If you read the books you'll know what I'm referring to ;) Well, let me know what you think, and thanks for reading as always :)
"What's your favourite song?" I ask the singer innocently. I've thought about this a lot. If I'm right the singer is going to be stupid enough to tell me the right "tune" himself.
"I'm sure it's nothing serious. He's probably just pretending." Her own words weren't even convincing her.
After Neville and Draco had both sat down on the couch, Professor Snape instructed them to take out their wands.
Haley bit her lips, thoughtfully. What had all of this been about? Had he just given her his blessing or something like that? But why? Was it possible that he knew… he knew she was on her way to see Malfoy? But that couldn't be true. There was no way… If he knew, he wouldn't have reacted like this, would he? No. Never. But then… wasn't there a chance that he might accept him? A tiny, impossible chance? Haley smiled softly at the thought. Then she shook it off resignedly.
people. Coincidentally, Haley stumbled right into her two best friends. Sitting in the middle of the hall. Holding hands. What?
A comforting weight settled on her shoulder. Ron's hand. "It's all right, Hails," he grunted soothingly. "Obviously, you've got your reasons. We respect that. Right Hermione?"
"What's the point of a hood if you don't use it?" Malfoy asked almost chidingly, as he pulled on the fabric until it completely covered her hair and face. For someone who had complained about getting wet only seconds before, the boy sure took his time, doing useless things. Although he stood directly in front of her, he wasn't meeting her eyes. It seemed as though he was completely focused on the task of tucking lose strands of her hair away, making sure the rain wouldn't be able to reach them. It seemed like a rather domestic thing to do. Intimate even.
Luna seemed to notice as well. "I thought you might be thirsty." She explained, taking a hesitant step forward and holding out the drinks.
Haley put the gobstone into her chest pocket, next to her wand, close to her heart. It calmed her somewhat.
Wouldn't it have been nice if she could insult him really badly? Or hex him until he'd finally leave her alone? She sighed.
She cleared her throat again, trying to summon some of the courage that usually flowed through her like a river and stepped close to the table. "Hey," she said quietly, hesitantly. "Can we talk?"
"Sirius…" she breathed, regarding him out of wide surprised eyes. His beard looked like he hadn't shaved in the last couple of days and there were dark circles underneath his eyes.
She saw her friend Ron's mouth open as if to call out a warning. But it was too late. She had already lost her balance. It was only a matter of seconds before she'd hit the ground.
Luna waited quietly, while he proceeded to sort out his thoughts. It had only been yesterday when he'd last talked to Potter. Inside that empty class room. He had wanted to stay away from her but wasn't this a sign, that he couldn't? Even if he tried not to get involved with her, he always found himself in front of the raven-haired girl again.
"Why can't you be this confident when it comes to staying by my side?" He asked quietly, more to himself.
Clearing her throat awkwardly, Haley picked up the book and turned toward the two people who'd surely witnessed the scene. "Um… hi…" She greeted them nervously, her gaze meeting Draco's for no more than a split second. Then he returned to his book again, as if nothing had interrupted him.
Wings would be handy by now. I close my eyes and imagine big wings to appear on my back. Not the dragon wings that I saw on mum the other night but brightly coloured butterfly wings. I open my eyes and look at my back. My wings are beautiful!
! You too? I almost had a heart attack!" Haley screeched. It was only the feeling of the boy softly inhaling and exhaling against her side that calmed her somewhat.
"I'm sorry. I – I – it was an accident – I didn't mean to – to–" the girl stammered, waving her hands in front of her frantically. "Shit, how do we – how do we–?"
"Cool," Neville exclaimed, grinning in return. Haley looked excitedly at her new chocolate frog card. What would Ron say to that? He'd been looking for this one since they'd been tiny little first years! Perhaps it was better to keep this to herself for now. Without wasting another moment she shoved the card into her jeans pocket.
Hello everyone! So now you hopefully have an idea how the whole dreaming thing works! I hope the whole POV and tense change is not too confusing but I wanted to create a different feel for the dream world and the real world. Next chapter it's time to get back to Hogwarts! Thank you so much for reading and leaving comments and kudos! It really means a lot!
She clucked her tongue impatiently. "Yes. He did that because you threw him at Malfoy as if he was a blasted basketball!"
"I think you must have misunderstood, Malfoy. There's absolutely nothing wrong with friendly fun. But I'm afraid, nothing that involves
"That's because – because he is surely terribly busy at the moment! And – and it doesn't matter much anyway – hey, look, isn't that the place we were looking for?"
Potter was leaning back against the tree now, smirking like she had won something. He didn't know why he was letting her do this to him. He blamed the butterflies. Those treacherous creatures.
"STOP THEM!" She screeched, lunging forward and trying unsuccessfully to get hold of the broomsticks.
"Don't forget to write," Haley whispered, taking a step toward her godfather and hugging him around his middle.
"So bloody what! He hurt you! There's no way I'm going to sit and watch that tosser make my best friend cry!"
As I play the new guitar solo, Myron observes me suspiciously, like he thinks I'm familiar but can't quite put his finger on who I am. That's promising. When I'm done, the singer still frowns at me but the door opens nevertheless and I walk into another dream, feeling excited and uncertain at the same time.
Draco snorted humourlessly. "Who is?" He shook his head tiredly. "I know you're judging him for being a Death Eater… But he's still my dad."
"Yeah, actually. I don't remember ever sleeping so soundly. What do you say, we nick that sleeping draught from Pomfrey?" The mischievous glint in his eyes was such a stark contrast to the lifelessness from last night. It filled her heart with hope.
Before meeting up with Hermione inside The Three Broomsticks, Haley stopped by Honeyduke's for a short while. She ended up spending much more time inside the little sweet shop than she had intended. Finding a suitable Valentine's Day present among all the cheesy hearts and angels had been much harder than she had anticipated.
It was impossible to argue with him when he put it like that. Haley tried to think of a clever response but her head felt strangely empty in that moment. She didn't feel like arguing anyway.
Draco wasn't ready to face her. Not here. He wasn't ready for people to find out that he spent time with Loony Lovegood. Who knew what the Ravenclaw would say or how she would embarrass him?
"What?" Haley asked. Then she noticed a shadow falling onto the glass wall. A shadow of a figure. Haley turned around. A person stood there menacingly. But their face was hidden behind a dark cloak. Only, a flash of blond hair, was visible for a second.
Draco stopped listening. He couldn't care less about whatever it was that Pansy's father was threatening to take away from her. On the breakfast table beside her potion essay he had spotted a familiar name.
I feel him watch me as I spread the colour expertly on the wooden boards. "What?" I ask after a while.
Hedwig hooted and gave her a pointed look. She seemed to be saying 'Is that what you really think?' or maybe 'I thought you were smarter than that'.
"Do I look that funny to you?" He growled, as he got into her personal space, his nose almost touching her own. Her laughter died down almost instantly, her breath catching inside her throat. For a second she saw a mischievous glint light up in the boy's eyes. Then it was gone.
"I think you've got your answer," Hermione said with a smirk. Haley bit her lips shyly. She was one step closer to making a decision.
"What is it?" Malfoy heard Conners (or whatever his name was) asking. He had an ordinary voice. Nothing special. If Draco pushed the big red book (
"Just give it back," she muttered, reaching for the paper that Sirius was still holding out of her reach absently.
"Yeah but not – I didn't mean – it can be – I – I can't accept this!" She stammered at a loss for words.
The following day didn't bring any magical solutions with it. Unfortunately. Pansy cornered him before breakfast, asking him to understand. She just wanted to protect him. She just wanted him to not get hurt and yada yada…
"I had the impression this matter was urgent." Snape hissed impatiently, effectively drawing Draco's attention back to him. The boy had no choice but to turn around and follow his teacher out of the room.
"They were from two worlds, if you will. But instead of letting that keep each other apart they carved out a third one. A world that was their own. Where no one could touch them." He paused, reaching for his own cup and staring into it, as if the rest of the story was reflected on the surface.
Malfoy chuckles, lowering himself to the wooden floor and leaning against the wall behind him. There are no chairs. "Don't just stand there," he says, patting the space next to him.
Hi friends! So sorry, this took so long. I'm kind of busy with my thesis at the moment so there's not too much time to write. Also, I found this addictive Chinese webnovel but shh...
"Finally," Hermione exclaimed. "We were actually worried you somehow drowned yourselves in the shower."
"I think I can see it! That's got to be Luna's house, who else would live in a place like that? It looks like a giant rook!" Ron exclaimed, pointing toward a house in the distance that indeed looked like a giant rook. It was located at the top of a small hill with a garden surrounding it. A small stream was curling along the foot of the hill, almost appearing like a road leading up to the house.
"And although many people see her as a crazy liar at the moment, I'm sure… that will change once everyone finds out, she's been telling the truth, all along. Don't you think?"
"Me? Afraid of losing? Against someone who makes up stories about reading minds and knowing about other people's favourite drinks?"
He knew it. "What about them? Did something happen?" He tried to keep his voice calm. But it was unexpectedly hard.
They passed the Slytherins leaving the Entrance Hall behind and stepped out onto the castle grounds. Haley turned her head back. No reaction. He hadn't acknowledged her in any way! But he had to have noticed her! Never before had he ignored her like this!
Haley switched out her empty plate with Draco's but before she could grab her fork, he had confiscated it.
Well, it wasn't completely true. There was something she wanted. But she doubted he could clear her godfather's name or get rid of Umbridge for her.
"Come on," Hermione said with a sigh, pulling her friend toward the class. It was strange. Nowadays, there was this permanent feeling of impatience and frustration whenever she looked at Haley. She simply couldn't understand what had gone wrong with her to be… drawn to someone like Malfoy. To some point, she could even understand Ron's cold behaviour toward her. Although, she knew it wasn't the right thing to do.
"I…" he bites his lips, looking at his fingers where he's playing with a green gobstone that looks eerily familiar. It's the one my sleeping body is wearing as a bracelet in that exact moment. In the next second the gobstone is gone.
She didn't feel like doing this now. She hadn't even talked to Justin yet. That was one conversation she did not look forward to. And she sure as hell didn't want to have a similar conversation with Malfoy now. Not with everything that seemed to be floating between them unsaid. Not when she still didn't have the slightest idea on how to behave around the boy. How to talk to him. How to not stare. How to not blush when she looked into his eyes. How to forget that not a week ago this boy had asked her out on an actual date. How was she supposed to keep herself from freaking out over the whole situation?
"Get mum," Haley ordered her little brother who had kept her company the whole time. He'd fetched a book of jokes from his room and read them out to her. Although one joke was lamer than the next, it had distracted her from worrying somewhat.
"I think," I say at last. "I might have found out his secret." My face heats up and I have to avert my eyes.
And suddenly the summer air seemed at least fifty degrees colder. What was she doing? Chattering with him as if nothing had changed. As if she hadn't messed up everything they had.
The slow pace of the song really complements his voice that still sounds closer to a boy's than a man's. More youthful and soft than deep and husky.
irresistible. She smirked against his mouth, catching his lower lip between her own lips and gently sucked on it.
Haley snorted. "You're the one who wanted to meet up after curfew! Should I tell your new favourite teacher about that?"
So, it was the same wool. But Luna had made them for herself. "I didn't know you knew how to knit." He commented, glancing over at her gloves. They were even real gloves. With
"Don't worry, I'm not going to bite you," he muttered, while he tried not to let her reaction discourage him. Haley rolled her eyes at his words. But she was definitely grinning. And then he felt a light pressure on his hand that made his doubts disappear all at once. He grinned back and leant in the last few inches that separated his lips from hers. Getting to finally kiss her again was like gulping down a cold glass of water after not drinking anything for weeks. His hand crawled over her jumper toward her back and pulled her closer to him. Her hand had found its way into his hair and the way she was gently running her fingers through his silky strands made pleasant tingles spread all across his skin, starting from his scalp. There was not an inch between them but still he needed to be closer. Rolling the girl onto her back, he loomed above her. He pulled away for a second, catching his breath. Looking down at Haley's flushed cheeks, her kiss-swollen lips and her sparkling eyes, he suddenly felt like he was suffocating. His heart felt like someone was squeezing it. She was so… lovely? Amazing? Precious? Wonderful? But he couldn't think of a word that would adequately describe her. She was so much more than any words could express. Was this love? He didn't know. He cupped her face in his hand and stroked her cheek tenderly. She leaned into his touch with a soft smile.
They were making their way across the castle grounds toward the lake. And Haley could have listened to Sirius and her dad bantering forever. Even if she had to admit that the way her dad kept playing with his snitch and messing up his hair was a bit… well annoying… He kept glancing over toward the water, where a group of girls were sitting. It was cute in a way. Kind of desperate but slightly cute. She grinned. Then she spotted a girl with the same face as hers.
Draco looked away. This wasn't exactly what he wanted to talk about on their date. It was actually the last thing he wanted to talk about. The only thing it did was remind him of the fact that Potter and him weren't supposed to go on a date together. They belonged to different worlds. Had different goals and believes. How long could it last? Was this really the right thing? Wasn't it a mistake?
"Is it true?" He asks. His voice sounds hollow and lifeless. I look into his eyes but I'm not sure he's really there.
Haley sighed. She hated feeling so weak. Why couldn't she have thrown a hex at him? Or at least insult him properly? She had fought back in the beginning of course but at some point… she'd kind of given up. It was all too much. And why was the git always picking on her in the first place?
. Then, when I have almost reached his shoulder I notice the pattern of his green pyjama top. There are
"Sure," she said with an eye-roll, causing Haley to hit her playfully. Hermione evaded her attack with a grin.
that it hit her with the force of an oncoming mountain troll. It was all for her. The way he sometimes looked at her, the way he kissed her in this very moment – that was him. Without any masks. It was
"The owl?" I ask. Mum grins as an answer. Then she leans back in her seat and closes her eyes for a second. As soon as they're open again there are prongs on top of her head.
Simon glanced over his shoulder where their parents were standing, still engaged in their conversation.
She couldn't believe it! Was she dreaming? It didn't feel like a dream but… could this really be true? Maybe he didn't approve of her choice of company but at least it seemed like he somewhat accepted it. Which was a start. With a face-splitting grin, she got up from her bed and attacked her godfather, throwing her arms around him.
As he got a bit closer, he finally recognized the red-haired weasel and the brown mass of hair of Granger. What the hell were they doing? Aside from not so subtly hiding behind trees?
But maybe… if it was true what she had found out in his last dream. If he really had a crush on her… even planned to ask her to the Yule Ball… A shudder went down her back. She still didn't know what to make of this particular piece of information. Malfoy, liking her? This was simply absurd, wasn't it?
"Hand me another nail, Dobby," the boy who I notice only now says cheerfully. It's Malfoy. Who else? And he's sitting on the ground his back to me, and his legs crossed underneath him and a hammer in his hand. He's wearing a lose muggle shirt and short trousers. No robes?
"I never said-" He protested but he didn't get to complete his sentence. He was effectively sabotaged by Haley's lips. He didn't open his mouth to keep arguing. He did open his mouth to do other wonderful things, however.
Should he ask it like that? It was simple enough and she could just give him an answer without him having to reveal anything first. Like how he planned to stay at Hogwarts, too, in case she wasn't leaving. And how much time he had spent fantasizing about all the things they could do when the castle was almost empty and they weren't busy with school and homework all the time. He really hoped she would stay.
"I'll break his bloody bones. I-" He got up, straightening his shoulders as if he was getting ready for a fight.
Draco sighed. It looked as though the article would have to wait until later. Snape wouldn't call him to his office at this hour if it wasn't anything urgent or important. Hopefully, there was nothing wrong with his family.
"Yeah," she agreed, looking at the magical ceiling above them. The sky was clear and blue. It seemed like it was going to be sunny today. She had an idea. Wouldn't it be stupid to waste such a perfectly good day?
"I had it all planned out," he continues. "And then when I finally got my nerves together that idiot had to go and snatch her away." It looks like the memory – is it a memory? – pains him. "It's just – it's all his fault! Everything. He ruined everything!"
"Stop laughing," he growls, putting the bottle down again. "Or I'm going to tell your precious girlfriend about the
Even if I wanted to I couldn't visit him. Before going to sleep I locked his gobstone inside my drawer. That way I won't even be tempted to do something stupid.
"I'm sure he's just fine," Hermione soothed. "Maybe he doesn't want to be found. You should give him space. To cool down."
"I see." She tilts her head to the side, seemingly thinking about it. Then she reaches over and pinches my cheek this time. "Well, I'm sure you'll come up with a way to convince him. Let me know once you've decided."
As it had done before, Draco's hand emitted a blue glow but this time it spread to Neville's hand, encasing his whole arm in blue light that even travelled over to his chest. Simultaneously, both boy's wands lifted off their palms and started twirling around each other in a mad dance.
As always Myron Wagtail greets me from inside his poster. "You again." He notes, he somehow seems paler than usual. Is he sick as well?
"You really don't have to do that," Haley argued. But Hermione was already stepping away and leaving, waving back at her one last time.
Still, there was more to it. "That's not a reason to attack someone! He said… he said he attacked Snape just because he existed! He did it because you said you were bored!"
She reached over to pluck a stray twig from his robes. "I'm not going to get bored of you so easily, you know?" She whispered, sensing that this might be where his true worries stemmed from.
"Oh, you should probably hurry if you still want to eat something," Luna advised. She had followed Haley's gaze.
He was pulling away and his face was surprisingly close to hers. She remembered what it felt like to kiss him.
It was all too much. The article about the events in the ministry in the paper. An official notice, listing all the Death Eaters that were to be sent to Azkaban. Including his father…
For some reason the thought made him feel sick. He'd always wanted to be just like his father. But now he wasn't sure about that any more.
"Draco! Draco, are you there?" Haley called again and again. But there was no answer. She didn't know if he heard her or not. Or if he was even there…
been doing. She rushed past them, up the last flight of stairs that lead toward her common room without another word.
"It's nothing. I just… it's just a sprain." He grinned at her, clearly acting as though everything was all right. But it was obvious that he was in pain. She was actually surprised he wasn't hurt more seriously. After that fall… She was tearing up again.
"This might be your only chance to show what you can do," Haley replied sternly, trying to summon some of her inner Hermione to get the tone right. "Do you really want to waste it by worrying about messing up?"
It wasn't deserted. In the chair, closer to her, Luna was seated, her back turned to Haley and taking notes on a piece of parchment. The sight of the boy sitting opposite her, caused her heartbeat to stutter momentarily. He was leaning over a book, blond strands of hair falling into his face. He hadn't noticed her yet. Maybe it was better to just go. What would she even say? This had been a stupid idea from the start. Feeling like a complete coward, Haley spun around, her hand catching on a book that had been jutting out of the shelf halfway. The book flew through the air and landed on the floor with a
from her! He wasn't going to let her leave him like this. Not before she answered at least one of his questions! So, how did he stop her?
"Ha ha ha," Myron Wagtail laughs, "You don't expect me to let just anybody into my master's dreams? That's not the right
"Come on now Potter, don't be like that. Didn't Corner say you still had a chance, if you got rid of the other girl? I know one or two harmless spells, that would do the trick." And maybe one of his spells would hit Conners the idiot by accident. He didn't look at Potter, instead he was inspecting his fingernails casually.
"We… didn't go around looking for it all day," Haley offered, not quite lying, "There were… other things."
"We'd only have to figure out how to revise the Siren's curse then. But I think I've read about a cure for that. Even if it's really rare."
"Wait," he said, tightening his arm to hold her there. "I was joking. Don't… don't go." He sounded so fearful, that something in Haley's chest softened.
. "I don't know what I was thinking, kidding myself, thinking this would pass if only I waited long enough. If only I studied hard enough." He sounded like he was close to tears. "I shouldn't… I should never have come back."
"Obviously, you need to look at your Defence notes again. Good thing the exam isn't tomorrow." He shuddered. All this talk of exams was seriously getting to him. It was a good thing he knew one of the examiners.
But there was no time to linger on Weasley's strange behaviour. He'd spotted Haley, who'd helped Granger onto one of the thestrals. Now, she was looking at him in confusion. And she was covered in blood.
Once Haley was done with her shower, her first class was almost over. It wasn’t a big problem since Defence was taught by one of her dad’s best friends. Lupin was hardly going to give her a
For a moment there was an expression of surprise in his eyes, before they rolled back into his head and he sank back into the sofa cushions lifelessly like a puppet whose strings had been cut off.
"Hm." This was the hard part. "Which one are you going to use?" He asked the girl beside him, who was stirring a similar pot of chocolate.
Christmas biscuits, but now I've changed my mind," he muttered with a glare. Ha! She probably already regretted her words.
"Then get yourself together, for Merlin's sake!" Hermione hissed at her, before leaving her alone in the hallway.
"The two of you are unbelievable," Hermione chided them. But she knew it made little sense to keep working on their homework when her two friends were this demotivated.
"We're not done yet. The first one who gets three wins wins the game." He informed her importantly. She wanted to pat his head because he took this so seriously. But then, he had always been a sore loser, hadn't he? The only problem was: Haley didn't like losing either. There was no way, she was going to go easy on him.
"Trust?" The man scoffed. "Has Potter turned you into a Gryffindor already? A Slytherin would never trust anyone besides himself."
Polished leather boots. Shiny, black robes. Hands hidden – probably folded – behind the back. Regal posture. Puffed out chest. Two badges gleaming there on the left side. One green, with a snake, that curled around a sharp
"I am not trying to tell you what to do. Or which choice to make. No one can take that from you." He stared into his teacup again. "But I want you to know that some things might be worth fighting for. And it may not always be easy to make the right choice but that does not mean there is none. There is always a choice. What you need to understand, however, is whatever you are is going to choose, you are the one who will have to live with it. So, you need to ask yourself, can you live with that choice? Or are you going to be that fool who regrets it for the rest of his life?"
All summer she had avoided thinking about him and everything else that train of thought might involve. Everyday she had told herself,
"I…" She bit her lips anxiously. "Have you… maybe… heard from… from…" Why was it so hard to say his name?
Hidden underneath her bed, Haley suddenly glimpsed something shiny. She reached for the object and picked it up, holding it in front of her eyes. A green gobstone, hanging on an old leather band. She
Potter looked like she wanted to protest. It wasn't the first time that Draco wished he knew what the girl was thinking. Then again, perhaps it was better that he didn't know.
With this last line, he gets up and hands his guitar to someone behind him that has just appeared out of nowhere. It's Myron Wagtail! My dear friend! I barely stop myself from waving at him. Like the professional he is, he seamlessly continues the song where Malfoy left off.
His grip on my waist tightens almost imperceptibly. Then he takes a deep breath, his eyes boring into mine. "And I look into your impossibly green eyes…" he pauses, looking back and forth between my eyes like he's searching for something. "And then I do this," he whispers, before pulling me against him and leaning down to kiss me.
"And thank Merlin for that. I think you're much better suited as my girlfriend." He pecked her lips, short and sweet. She wished his kisses weren't that irresistible.
"Woah, it really worked," she said, her voice sounding kind of awed. She hadn't really believed what Malfoy had said about his 'time machine' until now.
"No, I didn't forget," she explained, clucking her tongue impatiently. "I'm just saying that it's relatable. How did you think he would react?"
"Fine," Malfoy spat, "Two weeks, four weeks, I'm sure I can convince you of my fabulousness in only a day."
Still, when Haley sheepishly took Draco's hand and shrugged her shoulders as an explanation, Lily sent her a knowing smile, as if she hadn't expected anything less from her.
"Sev, would you look after the Resurgence Draught for a moment? And don't forget to add the gargoyle powder after ten stirrings." She instructs my potion professor like
"You know how the biggest problem with golem magic is that while the golem protects the body of the spellcaster, the wizard's soul seems to be sucked up by it at the same time. But if one could use a Siren call to bring back the soul… I think… do you think that could work?"
Snape who caught her look of horror shook his head once. She still made a step forward, only to be held back by an arm. Her mum's.
"He – I mean, I – I went into his dream… I… I wanted to find out why… why he always picks on me. Or at least… find a way to stop him." And I've accomplished none of that. How disappointing.
cupcake, she wanted to correct him but for some reason she didn't think that would help her exactly.
"Actually, I did," she retorted, her voice sounding much more confident than she felt. "Here." She held out her hand, the cupcake sitting in the middle of her palm.
Thank you so much for reading, everyone! Leave me your thoughts <3 (you know since this is my birth month and everything. Just saying :P)
"Is that… okay?" He asked, surprising her with his gentleness. Somehow it irritated her. He wasn't supposed to be gentle or…
Mum reaches for my wrist and pulls me through the door that closes behind us. We're not on the train anymore. Wherever this is, I've never been here before.
The four were only given a short moment to catch themselves because just a few minutes later the door opened again.
"That's really kind of you," Luna said, "But I still have some things left to finish up. Maybe some other time?" She sounded really hopeful.
The boy shook his head and crossed his arms in front of his chest. Interesting. Hadn't she heard something crinkle, when his left hand had touched the insides of his pocket? Was he hiding something there?
The girl felt herself nod against his chest, where the alluring scent of him was even more intense. "I'll try." She said quietly, wondering if that was something she could actually do. She could try either way.
The note suddenly felt scorchingly hot in her hand. She remembered then, how she'd wanted to thank him. How she'd wanted to tell him, that the note had been bringing her luck.
She would recognize that handwriting anywhere. Even in a dark night that was only illuminated by the moon and the soft glow of her wand. How could he? Her eyes flitted across the parchment again and again, trying to look for clues that this wasn't true. That it was all some sick joke. But all she saw were these… horribly vile phrases…
. But what if someone (read: Malfoy) had tampered with it? But he wouldn't do that. They were past this, right?
. She felt terrible for keeping a secret from him. But wouldn't telling him what she had done be even worse? It was a good thing he couldn't see her face the way they were pressed against one another. Or else he would surely notice that something was wrong.
"Then this must be… " I begin to say but I'm stunned into silence by the sight that is in front of me.
"Alright." He whispered, his heart beating slightly slower now. Then his eyes widened and it sped up again.
"Thanks for offering, Ron. It's a long story, though. So maybe another time? Or you'll really end up missing lunch."
He nodded once. "Alright. Something simple." Then he pointed his wand at a miniature guitar, hanging above the desk. She hoped he wasn't going to
Hi everyone! Who is this strange Tom Riddle that no one has ever heard of? Surely no one important xD Ah... poor Draco. He seems to never get a break :/ But as Simon said 'Is it really the end?' Btw, has any one read 'Any Way the Wind Blows'? How'd you like it? Leave me your thoughts if you want to discuss it. Or if you want to say anything else really.
"All right. I won't ask. You don't have to say anything." It hurt seeing her like this. Distraught and panicked and out of her depth. It didn't suit her.
He turned his head so he was facing her. "You're no help at all," he complained with a pout, "how dare you act like everything is fine when I still don't know, whether she's coming with me or not?"
She turned around without another word, feeling at least a thousand pairs of eyes on her back as she walked down the corridor, no idea where she was even going. She heard a second pair of feet following behind her but she didn't dare turn around to check who they belonged to.
"Sorry," she mumbled, fumbling for her wand to clean up the sticky mess. But someone – probably Hermione – had already whispered the incantation to make the juice magically disappear.
Hope you're all staying calm and not letting panic get the best of you in these times. I mean, now there's all this time to read fanfiction. And watch starkid musicals on yt. (That's what I'm doing :D Anyone else? Tell me which musical is your favourite!)
Lily was halfway done with the braid. She took a break to look up at her daughter with a little smile.
Suddenly, he had an overpowering urge to storm out of the office. To flee. "Well, if that's all I'm going to-"
"It's always the same dream," she whispered, her eyes closed. She didn't see much in the darkness and without her glasses anyway. Hermione sat down next to her, silently waiting for more.
"Okay, so then we need to go get Neville and convince him to help us." Haley concluded. "How do we get there, though? Apparating might take too long. We'd have to walk all the way from Hogsmeade."
He had a point there. "Right. So… let's do it this way. I'm going to head to the library and you go and tell Hermione… I don't know, tell her I forgot something in Trelawney's classroom or something." Haley shrugged. "I'm gonna start browsing through the book and tell you about it later. How's that sound?"
He read, before this line disappeared as well. For a few moments there was no more writing. It almost seemed as if there wasn't going to come anything more, when another line appeared.
"Three!" They said together, raised their cups and drank. After setting down the cups they held out their left hands with their wands like earlier and waited for something to happen.
“Oh. Well. Never mind, then.” He replies quietly. He seems disappointed almost. My curiosity is piqued. But before I can ask him to elaborate, he reaches for my arm and starts to draw something new onto my skin.
"Stop… I mean – fly normal again!" I know this is a dream and if I fall I probably won't be hurt but… this feels so real. The clouds are floating past us by but it's all wrong. I can't see the ground. And the sky… is it above us or below? My stomach churns uncomfortably.
Ron nodded. And so they kept walking past little streams and woodlands for another fifteen minutes. The good thing was that the sun was hidden behind countless clouds, otherwise the short walk in the afternoon sun would have completely exhausted them.
Malfoy was already waiting for her by the time she reached the willow tree. He was lazily leaning against it, his legs crossed at the ankles. He was waiting just for
He nodded eagerly. "Are you sure you don't want any of the treacle muffins your elf made just for you?" It wasn't the sugary sweet smile on his face that did her in. Or the hopefulness in his voice. Or the fact that his boyish innocence drove her completely nuts. None of that was adorable in any way. What did her in was the promise of the finest treats of course.
In a split second I imagine being big again. For a second I see my body growing bigger and bigger, reminding me of Alice in Wonderland who ate a cake and grew until her arms reached out the windows and her head burst through the roof… Fortunately, my body stops growing once I've reached my original size.
She nestled in close to Hermione's face and whispered, "I like him." It felt good. "I really really like him, Hermione." She imagined her friend opening her eyes and smiling at her. She imagined her telling her that she was happy for her. Hermione hummed softly as if she were wordlessly agreeing with her. Haley smiled.
He kissed her. It was just a peck. Quick and sweet. But so full of affection. She wanted more of it. But in front of all the other students, she suddenly felt strangely shy. Reluctantly, she pulled away. "See you in a bit."
"For you, too." It was a testament of how anxious he was about the exams that he didn't say anything on the lines of '
But he did have a lead. Snape. Haley had told him something. She'd given him some kind of hint, obviously hoping he'd help her. Because no one else was
"I'm sure it'll all make sense in the end," she mumbled almost to herself. "Do you want me to get you a Reverse Fool Potion?" She added, suddenly focusing her attention on him.
Walking back to the castle was much more painful and tedious than Draco cared to admit. They had to take a break half-way through because the brooms he had carried under his right arm had slipped from his hold. Just when he'd thought he couldn't possibly embarrass himself any further. He fumbled for his wand, which he kept in his robe pocket but it slipped from his fingers when a sharp stab of pain went along his wrist.
"Not yet. The witch who sold them to me said they possessed a very old kind of magic. Magic that provided protection."
"I thought… I thought, I could save him." Haley's voice was quiet. And the words sounded so stupid to her now. Spoken aloud. "I had to try. It wasn't just a dream. It felt different!" She tried to defend herself.
It's a trick question. I don't expect the guard to tell me about the actual key but I might be able to confirm whether this is his door or not.
"Don't." Malfoy said, looking at his wrist. "Don't cry. I can't deal with… that." He sounded like he felt embarrassed. And a little pained.
"Wait for me," calls the boy, who is chasing the girl. He walks past me, without noticing me. But I recognise
He snorted, tilting his head to the side. "A peace offering?" He scoffed disbelievingly. Haley nodded.
"Does that mean… you're not going to tell anyone?" He shouldn't have asked it. Even if Snape agreed not to tell anyone, how could Draco trust him? The Slytherin's eyes wandered toward the inner pocket of his robes where his wand was hidden.
"I thought you were asleep," she argued, shrugging. It looked awkward, since she was also lying on her side, facing him. Draco watched her for a moment, frowning. Was he the one who had gone crazy or was it Potter? He wondered whether it would be childish to pinch her back. He cleared his throat.
"No!" I almost yell. I'd probably be able to pull it off, since I know his face so well. But… I'd rather not use his appearance for this.
Her commotion made Malfoy turn around, his broom hitting the back of her shins and sending her right into the puddle after all. For a moment, it looked like the boy was reaching out his hand, in an attempt to grab her. But either way, he was too late.
Draco bit his lips and looked away. He couldn't stop the heat rushing into his cheeks. It seemed to be all the confirmation he needed.
He had to pull away, his eyes clenched tightly and breathing heavily. He felt as if he had just run two miles. Half-reluctantly Draco let go of Haley's hand and let himself sink onto his back next to her. His heart was thumping in his chest so forcefully he felt the beats reverberate all through his body.
"I'm afraid you'll have to learn the basics without magic first. But once you've got it I'll show you a helpful spell that will make you work faster."
As she kept glancing at the people below them in fascination, his eyes wandered all across her familiar silhouette. Violet definitely was a good colour on her. And why wasn't she wearing dresses more often? The lightweight fabric, accented with ribbons and little fabric flowers at the seams made her look even lovelier than usual. She ducked down slightly, so she had a better view of the other students. That way he could admire the silver clasp her hair was held together with, which was decorated with little flowers as well. Had she put in all that effort for him?
Hermione eyed her suspiciously. "It's nothing that goes against the rules, is it? Or something dangerous?"
Usually when it came to Dobby Haley would believe this right away but.. there was something in the way Malfoy was avoiding her gaze that seemed suspicious.
"I do," he said with a soft smile, looking at her as if he thought she was the sweetest thing of them all. The apparent adoration in his eyes turned her insides into a knotted mess, leaving her slightly nervous and dizzy. She cleared her throat, blindly reaching for a piece of chocolate cake and putting it on her plate. The flavour of chocolate was so rich that she closed her eyes, savouring the aroma on her tongue.
"We haven't found a room yet," Haley answered Luna's earlier question, "We're still looking but we'll let you know as soon as we find something, okay?" While she was trying not to sound too dismissive, she kept looking toward the entrance of the library in case Hermione returned. She bit her lips nervously.
And there was something in the way she looked at him. Something new and different. A riddle, he'd been trying to solve for weeks. It absolutely drove him mad. What was the secret hiding behind her eyes?
"What are you reading that for?" An all too familiar voice asked, while the article vanished from his sight.
"I know," she hissed back. "Trying to counter the effects of the jingle berries. I added too many earlier."
. Hermione noticed Haley grabbing Malfoy's hand. It seemed like an almost unconscious action. Like she was intuitively seeking the boy's comfort. And Malfoy? There was a fond smile on his face. And his eyes… they were resting solely on Haley. Ron took that moment to find his voice again.
"Yeah, well." Haley shrugged, not knowing what to say to that. She wasn't playing with anybody's feelings, was she? Not really. It wasn't like she had agreed to date Malfoy so she could eventually break his heart. She'd just wanted some peace. And also… There was another reason. One, she couldn't fully grasp yet. Let alone put into words.
Before I can talk myself out of it (or risk being spotted by mum) I turn left and head down the corridor past Simon's dream door toward Draco's. Just one last time… I pick up the guitar and play the intro to
Sometime around the early evening hours, Draco finally started to stir awake. When he opened his eyes, he seemed obviously disoriented.
"What are you –?" The girl started to ask, as Draco handed her the box, so that he could wrap the treats up inside a handkerchief. It didn't look as neat as his mother would have done it but it would do. With one hand he took the wooden box from Potter's hands and placed his little snack package inside her open hands. Once the box was safely stored inside his shoulder bag again, he looked up at her.
"That sounds like something Baz would do." He muttered. "Cursing someone, I mean. Not having a crush. Everyone else has a crush on
But it wasn't as bad as it seemed. Malfoy was pretending to be someone else and she was doing the same. So, technically it wasn't
Suddenly she felt like crying. "I…" She started to say but didn't know how to continue. Didn't know the words that would make everything right. Maybe those words didn't exist.
"I've made it worse now, haven't I?" She said, grimacing. "Now you're going to picture me with a moustache."
whispered her voice… He closed his eyes and imagined her face. Her beautiful green eyes, her snub nose, her soft pink lips…
"I know. Just talk to her. I'm sure she'll understand. If you like her so much she has to be somewhat kind at the least, am I wrong?"
"Wait!" Haley called. She wasn't done yet. "Can't you just – I'm not asking you to approve of him. I'm not even asking you to understand. I just… please tell me you'll leave him alone."
"But – how is that – I mean you're an – how can you – I don't understand – what?" It's not my most shining moment. The owl –
Haley grinned. She knew for a fact, that Neville already had plenty of Morganas. But she appreciated the effort he made, instead of asking her whether she was all right. She must have heard that question at least a hundred times already!
"There," Ron repeated, pointing toward the suspicious book. Why was he this observant today? What was wrong with him?
With each word I say his face gets paler. Until finally he clenches his teeth and grits out, "Fine. I'll do it."
Snape lifted an eyebrow. Silently asking for an explanation. Why was he even telling the man all of this? Sometimes, it felt as if he was pulling his thoughts right out of his head.
He's not only singing though. A guitar has appeared in his hands and he's strumming along, moving his body to the music. Merlin, am I dreaming? Well, I guess I am but still... is that really Draco Malfoy dancing and singing to "Do the Hippogriff"? I can't stop myself from chuckling. How I wish I could witness this in reality. Malfoy glances over at me, then. Has he noticed my chuckling? A second later another guitar appears – this time in my hands – and Malfoy continues to sing.
"You don't mean that." He said, feeling his fingernails press into his palms, from balling his hands.
"Don't you agree with him?" She asked quietly. "Don't you think it's foolish of me to give Malfoy a chance?"
"Who's there? Is that you peeves?" The Fat Lady asked sleepily, as Haley approached the portrait. She removed the Invisibility Cloak from her face.
"It seems your date went well," Lovegood said, chuckling in amusement. The cheerful expression on her face really suited her well, Draco observed. Most of the time she seemed like she was far away, drawn into her own little world but the way her face crinkled up in amusement was really sweet. He had never really had a friend like her. All observant and a little quirky. If he was honest he had never had a real friend period.
"It's fine," Malfoy interrupted her stammering. "I didn't – I didn't meant to pry." Suddenly it seemed as if they were walking on thin ice. Both of them treading carefully as not to break it.
And with that he made his way toward the Great Hall. Haley shook her head in amusement and walked down the hall that lead to the library.
