"Oh God," said Harry. "Please don't... can't I just, stay in solitary confinement or something? Until we figure out a way to stop it?"
Alicia Spinnet, Ginny, and someone Harry didn't recognise all clapped him on the back; Ginny was clinging to Alicia's shoulder, giggling into her soft brown hair.
"You know," said Dean, "I'm not entirely sure we should be telling Malfoy this."
"Luna told me you have a new place," said Harry, uncomfortably polite.
"Not exactly. But also yes. If you haven't gathered, my self-esteem is not the highest. I'm sure you could call that karma."
"Yeah," he said. "Yeah, it's looking that way."
"You're not interested in men," said Draco, as though the notion were impossible, and Harry was about to get angry with him when something caught his eye. Two men were standing on the opposite side of the road, staring. They were in Muggle dress, but they looked vaguely familiar, and as Harry watched the taller man's mouth formed the words
"I did wonder," said Harry, because it was
Draco wanted him. Draco wanted him, and Harry wanted Draco, and now they were going to do — something —
"You're worse than Seamus," said Harry, hoping Malfoy couldn't see the heat in his face. "I have no idea what you mean by that."
"Oh," said Hermione. "Well... not necessarily. I mean, it's not that different from kissing a girl, is it... and many authorities believe in a sliding scale of sexuality, so maybe you're just a
Sirius had underlined it. He'd
"Make a joke of it if you like," said Ginny, "But you do need to get out more."
"No, I was trying to tell you I snogged Draco Malfoy and liked it. But I guess it comes with the territory."
"More anything," he said. Harry, charmed despite himself, got up and put on Nirvana.
"Oh, hello," he said, a little too high. "I've decided it's my turn to make dinner."
"But fine," he said. "Maybe I
In the kitchen Seamus prattled about his feud with Healer Jones on Ward Ten as he flicked the oven on and Summoned a frozen pizza from the larder. Harry was only half-listening as he put the kettle on for tea. He picked at the wood of the kitchen table, adding a hmm at all the points he hoped he was supposed to be responding to. The Floo flared while they were waiting for the pizza and Ron jumped out of the flames, grinning and red-faced as though he'd been training moments before.
so much," said Malfoy. "Come on, Ha — Potter."
He wandlessly Summoned his sketchpad while Ginny rifled through the book.
Dean shrugged.
"Kitchen's downstairs." Harry gestured down the hall. "There's a cloakroom and a toilet there, the dining room's on the left, and this one's a study. You're welcome to use the space down here. To be honest, we usually eat in the kitchen or the drawing room, and I haven't found anything I want to do with the study yet. Are you hungry? There's leftover Chinese."
"Long story," said Harry tiredly.
Hermione cleared her throat again. Pansy, eyes flicking to her, finished her second glass of wine. Hermione made an obvious effort not to return a glare.
carved deep into one of them. The letters were etched defiantly amongst a dozen other names and initials, some too weathered to read now.
Neville didn't look entirely convinced, but he did look determined. Harry, still jittery from realising yet again that there was something fundamentally wrong with him, found himself smiling anyway.
. He'd loved Harry, and he'd tried for him, and he was gone now, along with so many others. He curled up on Sirius's bed, breathing deep as though he could still smell him on the pillow, and cried for the first time in a long time.
"Hi," said Harry, and a hush fell over the room.
Malfoy let him go. He looked wild with fury and humiliation.
"What
This seemed to work; Malfoy's cheeks went from pale to bright red.
"I'm not sure that's
"I'm not going to! Also, I can't breathe!"
He pressed against Draco, taking control, tearing Draco's shirt open and running his nails over the flesh revealed. He ran his fingers over a faint indentation over his ribs, then froze as he realised what it was – a silvery, S-shaped scar.
Draco smirked at her. Pansy's lip curled in an answering smirk that seemed rather less confident.
"Funny old world, isn't it?" said Malfoy, voice bright and brittle. "Can you give me the brain juice already before I die of awkwardness?"
"Potter," called Malfoy, from the kitchen doorway. He was leaning against the doorframe, the Nirvana shirt tight over his slim shoulders, black pyjama bottoms low on his hips, feet bare. He was staring at Harry with a grey-blue gaze that sent a jolt through Harry's veins.
Harry mostly watched Draco. The Quidditch talk had defused his tense expression, and now he was lazily scooping custard from his bowl with a faint smirk, occasionally adding something inflammatory to the Pansy-Ginny bickering match.
"And Ron," said Pansy, eyes narrowing on him. "I hear you've got all interesting, too."
"Saw my awful probation officer," he said.
"No," said Harry. "I think I may have known for a while."
He went to see Teddy every week of December, and Teddy was almost uncontrollably excited for the entire month. He babbled at Harry with enthusiasm, showing him the decorations, pointing at his Christmas-themed picture book, ostentatiously inspecting underneath the tree for 'pesents'. Andromeda's decor was classy, her Christmas tree pristine and traditional in silver and gold, the whole thing held together with some impressive charmwork to prevent Teddy from dismantling it. The baubles had tiny Christmas scenes floating inside them: Hogsmeade in the snow, the Northern Lights over mountains, tiny house-elves singing silent carols.
Harry blinked. He didn't know what he'd been expecting, but it wasn't to talk about
"You will not take a seat, sir?" said Kreacher, who was already dragging a chair over to a nearby countertop. "There is cottage pie and apple crumble if you wants it, or ice cream, or roast chicken from yesterday –"
"Was it a tattoo or piercing you wanted?"
choice, in the end?
"Would suit you," he said, holding up a collar and winking. He was wearing a skin-tight PVC vest and a collar of his own, with a padlock on it. "Or maybe for your boyfriend?"
Malfoy looked as though he wished he hadn't asked.
"Well I would like to," said Malfoy. "I told you, I don't want to be a pet. This matters, Potter, so take the money."
"Ooh," said Neville, looking into the pot with intrigue. "Is it good?"
"I missed you," she said. Harry wondered at the odds of her crying within the next few seconds; it seemed like a good bet.
"It's probably for the best. He needs to get out on his own, and you need a little space and time to think. It's going to be okay."
me. He was so completely different to anyone I'd ever met, but he
"The Muggles have places to put people with no home and no money," said Malfoy, though he sounded offended. "I'll get a place eventually, but having no Muggle documents has posed a problem."
"Don't worry, mate, there's a whole bunch of new seventh years between us and him. And you get to be in Ginny's year – that's good, right?"
"My Mind Healer." "Do you think I'm going to explode if you say Mind Healer in front of me?"
The letter at the top was in handwriting Harry knew well — Remus Lupin. Harry felt a stab in his chest, burning eyes threatening to break him open. He remembered throwing this letter aside, before. If he'd known what was to happen, maybe he would have lingered.
"Don't wait up," he said simply, and shot out the door.
"I had to look it up too," said Ginny, shrugging. "Well, Hermione gave me a book. Absolute bunch of nutters. They think Hitler was right, they think that people who don't look like them are weaker, or stupid, or a threat to modern Muggle society."
"Both things can be true," said Malfoy, giving him a glare. "Did you think he was so unsubtle as to compliment me on things that were obviously false?"
"Read your interview in the Quibbler last week," he said. "You have had a
"I — no. I just don't think… "
"Stand back!" said a slightly more familiar squeaky voice. "This is

"You too, Harry," she said. "Come on, let's go back into the warm."
don't know anybody mean," he sneered, "Because all your friends are good little Gryffindors or poor dim Hufflepuffs or ever-so-clever Ravenclaws. Can't be that clever, though, if they want to hang out –"
Harry shook his head in disbelief.
," agreed Harry, smirking.
Harry let out an involuntary snort; Malfoy looked quietly pleased with himself.
Harry decided it was time to clean the study that day. He left the door open as he worked, trying to pretend to himself that it wasn't transparently obvious he was waiting by the front door. The study was nice, all gleaming wood panels and a leather-topped desk, well-maintained now that Kreacher and Harry worked together on the house. Kreacher himself came to check on him at lunch time, handing him a rag and the wood polish with a look that was far too knowing.
"I — well — I suppose I wanted to follow-up on my apology. To see if there was any way I could —"
"And you're sure that it's not just the fact that you were leapt on by girls all yesterday? That'd be enough to put me off for a while."
"Well," he said, "It's the first time anyone's done anything exactly like it. Maybe there's money in it. Certainly Magic Mobiles seem to be making a killing."
He woke with a start to sunshine beaming through the gaps in the curtains, the bed empty. He scrabbled for his glasses.
"You've covered your Dark Mark again," he blurted, but Draco didn't look upset. Instead, he smiled a slow, secret smile.
"Totally, dude." He hopped past Harry to grab three more albums, which he showed to Harry for approval. Harry could only nod, not recognising any of them.
"Close," snapped Hermione, and Harry stopped snickering to stare at her. "It was Draco."
"Is this to do with Ritchie's, erm, funny turn?" said Ron, looking supremely uncomfortable.
Harry winced. Hermione scowled.
As the entire female population followed suit, Harry ran.
Harry was kind of jealous of Neville, nowadays.
"Heard you were in need of some naive Gryffindor to take advantage of," said Harry, when it appeared Malfoy wasn't going to say anything else.
He read the leaflets, skimmed a few chapters of the book, and then looked at the court document.
"I don't want to talk about it," he said quickly, before he had a chance to say that actually, Malfoy's angular looks weren't that bad, and who really cared when a long lithe body like that was pressed up against him?
"Ow," said Harry, half out of the cloak. "Did I miss?"
"Oi oi!" hollered a voice, startling them both. "Dean, come and have a look at this!"
Harry gestured at the end door. Malfoy, looking as though his body were lead, pulled himself into the bathroom and shut the door.
"We can do Camden another day, if you want to stay," said Harry to Dean, as Malfoy disappeared down the stairs. Dean nodded at him, distracted, and knocked gently on the door.
Andromeda nodded, sipping her tea.
Harry, feeling suddenly irritable for reasons he couldn't really name, yanked at the sash window to let the owl inside. As he did so, he glanced down at the street; lounging under a tree opposite his house was someone tall, sharply dressed, and looking suspiciously like Blaise Zabini. He turned back to Malfoy, who was unfolding the note with slow, measured gestures.
But for all they'd shared a dorm, Harry didn't know him that deeply, hadn't had any truly serious conversation with him until this point. It felt like there was something missing. And besides, he was with Seamus now, and that was good.
"In that case," he said, and it came out lower and rougher than he'd intended. "I'm very flattered to be hated by you."
The walls were still plastered in posters, and Harry found himself reaching to touch them, eyes roaming the walls like exploring a treasure map. There were posters for Muggle films Harry didn't know, flyers for concerts — with an electric buzz, Harry noticed the address for one of them was in Camden — as well as adverts torn from Muggle magazines. Next to the wardrobe there was a black-and-white poster of a man in a leather jacket and turned-up jeans, sitting astride a motorbike with his hair slicked back and a cigarette dangling from his mouth.
Harry pressed his face into the pillow again. There was a long silence, then Hermione patted his hair and said:
"Oh you would say that," said Seamus, "Weren't you dating the Tutshill Tornados' biggest fan that year?"
He wrote to Andromeda, and asked if he could visit. Andromeda replied within the hour to say she was free all day. So Harry steeled himself, and Apparated to the doorstep of her little house in Hampstead.
"Know I'd what?" said Malfoy. "React quite as much? Bullshit. If you tell anyone, Potter, I swear –"
"That's three to two on the pizza," said Seamus. "Harry, deciding vote?"
"You and your service kink, Potter, honestly," he said, grabbing Harry's hand. His fingers felt thin and cold in Harry's grip.
Harry snorted.
Harry sometimes thought he might be happiest in the garden. Closing his eyes, he could smell the warm dampness of the earth, feel the grass between his fingers. Sometimes he missed the sense of awe and space that came from seven years in a castle in the Scottish Highlands, but there was something comforting about the garden's enclosed, albeit definitely Wizard Space proportions. He often wondered who had first designed it.
"Well, I only met him six months ago," said Fish. "In the pub, the first night he was homeless. He had fifty quid in change on him and a rucksack. Stood out like a sore thumb. He sat in a corner and ordered a drink an hour for most of a day, watching his little coin pile go down. Eventually when it'd been just me and him for a couple of hours I asked if he wanted to play pool and he said he didn't know how to play, but he bought me a drink and told me that his friend had kicked him off his sofa because, get this," Fish stuck his nose in the air and pulled a face, doing a very bad impression of a posh accent: "I have a
Harry surged forward, hoping it was Draco in the other chair, not knowing what he'd say but hoping the right words would come —
Malfoy sighed and waved a hand at him. "Sit down, Potter. If you want to."
"It's extremely potent. A tiny amount of this should give your addiction reinforcement loops a shake-up and improve your ability to review traumatic memories without triggering a negative spiral. If I've got this wrong, or if we get the dosage incorrect, it can

Harry grinned.
"It's amazing," said Harry. "I love it. It's really impressive."
's knows about Lavender."
"Oh, right, yes, I never feel responsibility or guilt for anything. Not like anybody died as a direct result of my decisions. Silly me, what was I thinking? Get over yourself, Malfoy, you weren't any more in control than I was. You were a kid. We still basically are."
There was a long pause.
, if not all the time, then at least some of it."
"You're welcome," said Harry dryly, and Blaise almost looked amused. She held one elegant hand out to Malfoy, and Malfoy clasped it, looking as though he'd rather have a hug. Then she did the same to Harry, and Harry copied Malfoy's movement even though his limbs were burning with embarrassment.
"Kreacher, I swear it. You tell me what my obligations are, and I'll do them."
There was an awkward pause.
"No! Well, in a way, but she hasn't put me up to this. Sometimes I do things all by myself, you know?"
Adhikari sat with her legs crossed in the other chair, placing one hand over the other on her knee.
"Like to listen, do you?" said Seamus, although he kept his voice mercifully quiet.
Harry had an intuition that Draco would ask him for another finger at almost the moment that he did, which was reassuring. Draco was making little movements, pushing onto his fingers. Draco's cock was leaking, rosy and within tempting closeness to Harry's mouth; he wrapped his mouth over the tip and Draco clenched and arched up, fists scrabbling at the sheets.
." Hermione interrupted him with a fierce head-shake that set her bushy hair flying around her. "Definitely not. You're Harry Potter, wealthy and well-connected saviour of the wizarding world and he's a homeless, penniless, wandless ex-Death Eater."
, Potter, drop them, because I'm going to do what I have to do and you can't stop me. If you've got any sense you won't even try, because if you do you'll get hurt, and I'll be happy to do it."
"You're going to be the death of me," said Draco, and Harry slid his fingers firmly into Draco until he made a desperate noise, and then closed his mouth over Draco's cock again, moving up and down with relentless rhythm. Every muscle in Draco's body tensed, his voice cracking on a groan, and Harry's mouth flooded with more bitter heat than he'd anticipated. It made him splutter in surprise, but he kept his mouth on Draco through the throes of his orgasm, until his hips stopped moving restlessly and his arse stopped clenching on Harry's fingers.
Harry picked up his books and moved to Malfoy's side without meeting his eyes.
like guys, or one guy... so maybe he actually didn't like that explanation.
"He looks good," blurted Harry, and Ron's eyes widened. Harry stuck his face in his drink, and prayed for a merciful death.
The kitchen was at its fullest on a Thursday morning, as Dean and Luna both had to be up for work that day, and Seamus usually arrived home from his last night shift hungry at the same time as everyone came down for breakfast. Harry decided to make pancakes today, listening to the background chatter of his friends and trying to let it soothe him though his eyes were prickly from his poor night's sleep.
so hard to get those muscles and you must be very proud, but not everyone in the universe needs to see! Have you no respect for your house guests?"
"Cho," he said, pulling back a little. "You're a good friend."
Harry stared at the mix of pound coins, silver and copper, uncomprehending.
Harry took the records and the player to his room. He listened to them, sometimes, when darkness rolled in on him and he couldn't face the world beyond his bedroom, and imagined Sirius there listening along beside him.
The Ancient House of Black.

"Um, thank you very much. What
"I dunno," said Dean. "Harry, can the postman even get to Grimmauld?"
Harry placed the document back into the secret compartment. It slid shut with a gentle click.
"No," said Dean. He leant his head against Seamus. "But I will. Mostly because I'm mad curious at this point. Never seen Malfoy like this before."
"I think it's a very noble thing for you to consider, Harry," said Hermione. "But I hope you know what you're getting into."
Hermione's eyes went wide. Harry, suddenly amused, wished he could take a picture of that face.
Harry didn't employ his usual stealth on Malfoy's staircase, and so Malfoy was leaning on the doorframe waiting for him when he got to the top.
Then the doorbell rang, and every hope Harry had been trying to crush since Christmas Eve burst into vibrant life in his heart.
to know. People who found him attractive and interesting when he was just being Harry, some scruffy git wandering about getting tattoos and buying records.
"Yeah, that sounds right."
Ginny snorted. Harry sighed.
Draco's eyes flicked to Hermione, gave her a flashing smile.
Harry stepped in behind Malfoy.
"Potter," he said. It sounded strange. Resigned, embarrassed… hopeful? Harry couldn't tell. He wished he could.
But the next shop wasn't a shop, it was a tattoo parlour. The front of it was absolutely plastered in photographs and art and rock music blared from inside, undercut by the faint noise of buzzing.
"Nothing's permanent," offered Ellie, and Malfoy blinked at her, as though this were something he'd never thought of.
girls throwing themselves at you?" said Harry. "I mean, when you've got Hermione. Wouldn't she kill you?"
Ian Webb, thought Harry. Spider Webb. It sounded utterly naff, and kind of sad really, now that he knew where the nickname came from. At the name of his ex, however, Malfoy made a sharp noise.
"I leave the house," said Harry, but he took a deep breath and let his steps slow down so that Malfoy, still staring at the map, could catch up. "Where next?"
"Alright, you know something I don't, Gin," said Seamus. "Who could be such a problem?"
"I like that explanation," said Harry, thinking of how actually, he certainly didn't want to sleep with Ginny, and had there been any girl he could actually imagine sleeping with? Not there were any boys, either, he'd certainly never thought of
"Could make a fortune," agreed Harry. "You wouldn't have to marry into Greengrass money after all."
"Mate," said Ron, patting him sympathetically on the back.
Harry winced.
"So if you love Harry, and Dean…" said Luna, and Harry, Dean and Ginny shared a moment of shared horror for what might be about to come next. "And you've done sex things with both of them… couldn't you love two people

Ginny gave him a wink, doing a little twist of her hips.
To Harry's surprise, this strategy actually appeared to work. Nobody was ever seen reading them, but he would find copies crumpled down the side of a sofa, lying on top of the toilet cistern, or stuck to the bottom of a kitchen chair.
"A little-known fact about me," he agreed, and Dean snorted and picked up his pencil again.
Malfoy just stared at him. "That doesn't — how?"
"Great!" said Ellie, as if that settled it. "Here, fill out this form. We're cash only, is that a problem?"
"I don't think Worsley did it on purpose," said Harry, amused by Malfoy's unknowing interjection into what happened to be a common household argument.
Harry felt sure that Malfoy knew. He
It was draining, and he didn't want to do it, and he wished he didn't have to do it. He was glad to leave Diagon Alley, and he Apparated directly to the front steps of Grimmauld Place without hesitation.
Malfoy was silent for a moment, pressing his face into his knees. He heaved another, steadier breath and pulled his back up against the wall again.
"Yeah. Rehab. State-sponsored, made the mistake of getting sauced up and calling a policeman a wanker one too many times. Dunno though, maybe this is the time, right?"
Draco looked back at him, flushing when he realised what he'd said.
Draco tilted his head to inspect him.
Hermione and Ginny staggered back, clutching their noses.
"No, they don't," agreed Harry. "Everything can change."
"I don't care about it," he said, "I was just curious."
"Perk of being an Unspeakable," said Blaise, with a sniff. "Several years of quibbling and dithering with the Gender Identity Transfer Service promptly evaporated after my application was accepted."
"It's been like this all afternoon," said Ron, raising an eyebrow as Harry sat down beside him. "Hermione showed him her papers and that was it."
"Thank you," said Malfoy, low and earnest. Then, "I've really missed you, Blaise."
He knew people were watching. He tried not to hear the whispers in the queues, tried not to see the glazed eyes and scarlet faces of the shop assistants. But people were coalescing into a crowd as he left the last shop. One girl at the front, no older than twelve, was pushed forward by a gaggle of giggling friends; he slid the sunglasses down his face to look at her. Suddenly, after all the fear and frustration he'd felt, he found it easy to smile at her.
"I leave the house," said Harry absently. His head was spinning with thoughts of Malfoy. Would he dare the soup run again, now he knew Hermione volunteered there? Was he homeless, or just too poor to afford a decent meal? Was it really
But maybe that wasn't true. Harry was measuring against Draco's rock bottom. He didn't

Everyone thinks things they feel bad about, it's part of being a person."
Malfoy was doing all day, Harry couldn't begin to fathom. He couldn't even ask, either, because Malfoy collected his own dinner from the kitchen that night, silently skirting the table with his head down, avoiding Luna's encouraging smile and Neville's suspicious stare.
"Pink Floyd?" suggested Hermione.
"Here, give me your hand," he said. Harry held out his left hand, bemused, but the man held it in a firm, warm grip with his right hand and picked up a biro to write a number on it with his left. He held on a little longer than was necessary; Harry was absolutely burning with embarrassment now.
"A Black hasn't made dinner in
He glanced up at the cafe sign as he approached, considering, rummaging in his pockets for change. He had a pound coin, so he entered the little shop and ordered two coffees; he was handed something watery-looking in a polystyrene cup by a woman with a none-too-friendly expression. He loaded them both with sugar to disguise the taste, and walked back out towards the alley.
Fish snorted.
"What's up?" said Hermione, sitting on the teacher's desk. Harry leant against a wobbly table and ran a hand through his hair.
With a bounce in his gait, he walked back up the stairs.
"Morning, Harry!" Dean greeted. He'd set his pen down, and was looking at Malfoy.
"Almost all of it," admitted Harry.
Harry settled himself on the floor beside Hermione's feet that night, hoping she'd do what she sometimes did in the tent and stroke his hair. She did, and Harry rested his leg against her and settled into a familiar daydream — of being a dog, like Sirius, of leaving his human mind behind for a time. He wondered if he could become an Animagus too.
But there was a choice. There was always a choice.
instead of the casserole.
"Perfect. Well, not
He beat Angelina, but only just, and the chanting from the onlookers — naturally anti-Malfoy, of course, but friendly about it — threatened to drown out the music. Then Ginny challenged him, and won again, and Malfoy told her she was competitive enough to be a Slytherin, and she was yelling something back about telling the Hat she wanted nothing to do with snotty little snakes when Malfoy's smirk fell off his face.
Harry suddenly became aware of Hermione, still outside in the dressing room, possibly listening.
He hung his head. Honestly, he'd defeated a Dark Lord, didn't that give him
They found a record shop in the end, tucked in between a shop selling corsets and one selling giant flares. CDs dominated the first half of the shop, a few extremely fashionable patrons flicking through them, but the back was decorated in vinyl records from floor to ceiling, with many more boxes and racks stacked up in front.
"No, Potter did not tell me this extremely significant piece of news," said Draco, throwing Harry a scandalised look. "I, of course, am not surprised at all. I do hope you'll remember us when you're famous."
"What's up with you?" he said, annoyingly attuned to the subtle signs of Harry in a sulk.
"Idiot's probably got bored and gone for a jaunt by now," said Ron, which was annoyingly perceptive.
"They didn't acquit him," said Harry. "He's on conditional discharge. He's monitored, he's got restrictions on travel, he can't use a wand. I think he was staying with Blaise Zabini maybe, but Zabini's trying to get in with the Unspeakables."
Malfoy made a croaky half-laughing noise.
They talked about pain. They talked about facts. They talked about mundane life. They talked about meds, they talked about fear and self-consciousness, about losing trust and blaming themselves. They talked about therapy, and how the weather was on the worst days of their lives, and they talked about their achievements for the week, big and small. They talked, and Harry wanted to talk too.
Neville sucked in a breath.
, thought Harry, gripping the bannister again.
Harry frowned.
"Well?" Harry prompted, after a moment, when Malfoy still hadn't sat down.
Harry stepped back against the bannister, chest clenching. He wanted to go inside, wanted to watch Malfoy's musical discovery again. A horrible feeling kept him in the corridor, fear and knowledge that Malfoy would give him a dark look, Harry's presence in these moments not welcome.
thought Harry.
What would he have said, if he knew what Harry had just done?
"On purpose? I think not," said Ron. "But whatever you need to say to preserve your honour, I suppose."
"A lily," answered Harry.
"Thanks," said Dean. "Sounds like fun, actually."
"She had the hots for him for ages, of course, and they had a bit of a thing around the time of the Yule Ball, or maybe it was fifth year? Anyway, that never really worked out, and perhaps we have an explanation for that now. Lavender and Parvati said they heard

"I still can't say I believe what people say about my image," he said, "But I am beginning to appreciate maybe I don't see things that clearly, when it comes to myself. Almost like childhood abuse has a detrimental effect, or something."
his rising offence. He tamped it down, annoyed with himself.

while in the service of Lord Voldemort," said Ron, grinning. Harry felt a sharp, hot stab of longing — for a world without Voldemort, for a world where Sirius and Regulus both had a chance to grow up and mend a bridge, share their love for Muggle music. To show it to Harry, a
"Okay," he said, and believed it.
He had his first panic attack on the threshold, and when it was over he picked himself up, dragged his leaden body to the kitchen, and made himself a cup of tea.
"That's it?" he asked, and there was something curiously small and broken about it.
," read Malfoy. "What the hell? This is biology."
"Oh, Potter, you're funny when you're flustered. It's almost cute."
"No," said Harry, "It's perfect. I trust you."
But it was Dean, his long legs up on the chair, hands nursing a tea. Harry looked between Dean and Luna, heart still racing;
"Don't be stupid, Potter," Draco interrupted, and the insult felt like a caress when combined with Draco's darkened eyes. "I don't hate you at all. How could I? You're literally perfect. There has to be a catch. I can't let myself believe that you're really

restricted potion," said Hermione. "That neither of us should have in our possession. Nobody but you and I know I have this. Do you understand, Malfoy? Nobody must know, and I will not hesitate to deny it if you claim anything of the sort was ever shown to you. And also, I will absolutely ruin you without the slightest hesitation."
"Only if it's unanimous," said Harry. "This is your home, guys. It's a lot to ask."
He looked back to Adhikari. Her face was passive, but there was something analytical in her eyes.
"The first time I saw her, I told her I was only doing this because I made a promise to an enemy, and I could barely get three words out without my throat closing over. It was bloody awful."
"Alright, Neville?" said Harry, reaching over him for the coffee pot.
Harry followed Ron down to the great hall with extreme nervousness. Ginny waved, but Harry's eyes went straight to the Slytherin table; Malfoy was there, looking troubled and pale, and Harry almost missed the loud obnoxious boy that used to hold court there. Pansy was at his elbow, as she so often was, and although she was talking loudly and brashly at a younger Slytherin boy she looked almost as pale and tired. She was facing away from Draco, and Draco stared ahead without paying the slightest bit of attention, but Harry could see their hands tightly entwined between them.
Harry ran his hand through his hair again. He had the feeling it was probably looking a bit insane.
Harry chanced a glance at Hermione, who had schooled her face into that of a woman who would not be badmouthing her future in-laws, no matter how annoying they were.
"Oh, alright, maybe I can see some benefits to making this a regular thing," he said.
"Ah yes, that time. Honestly, I can't believe I share my bed with such a pervert —"
Draco smirked lasciviously, and he took advantage of Harry's shock to slam him back against his father's desk. Harry winced, pulled Draco closer by his shirt, rolled him over and slammed his head back into the desk.
"Earth to Potter. What's with you?"
"It's not really my style," lied Harry. "Merry Christmas or something."
Draco's hands tightened in Harry's robe and he snarled, mouth opening, and the parted lips almost felt like invitation - enough that Harry tilted his head, moving the press of mouths to something more like a kiss, and with something like inevitability Draco responded, pulling Harry tighter, thrusting his tongue into Harry's mouth with the force of his fear and hatred behind it. Harry whimpered, surrendering as Draco moved him against the wall again and bit, grinding his hips, wrestling Harry though he was putting up no fight.
"Not a bad idea, actually," agreed Malfoy dryly, making Harry's panic rise. "I could make my fortune back, hanging around here writing a tell-all. Shame absolutely
"Bugger," said Ron.
Harry grinned at him.
"Wonderful."
"Come on up," he murmured, turning to the stairs.
"I don't know why you think I should care about such things," said Draco. "It's a personal goal of mine to be disinherited. They shall have to burn me off all the tapestries in the land, so thoroughly shall I be an insult to pure-bloodedness."
Harry sighed. Family, heritage, sexuality, who he was and what it meant… it was too much to think about. It was easier not to. He Summoned his broom from beside the back door, and spent the next few hours cleaning out the gutters, stubbornly thinking about nothing at all.

necklace — a black leather cord with a green spiral of glass for the charm — but Harry was still a little perplexed.
"Look, I'm really sorry to ask you, but it's… well, I blame Ginny really. I was narked when she moved out of the Burrow in such a hurry, and Mum was so worried about her, especially since she didn't want you two to rush into anything, but that was because I didn't realise quite how much of the
There was scarlet creeping up Malfoy's pale neck, colour rising in his cheeks.
"Come on, let's go downstairs," he said quietly, and Ron looked immensely relieved.
Seamus very much wanted to, but in the end Dean persuaded him he had the steadier charmwork. Harry watched them squabble it out, watched the sharp flash of a Severing Charm slicing at Ginny's childhood locks, and laughed along when Ginny saw the result in a conjured mirror and burst into bright, happy giggles.
"Longbottom," said Malfoy eventually, when Neville put down his spoon. "Can we talk?"
"I… no."
"I'm Janine," she said, in a London accent. "Come and have a brownie, Amit makes them."
"Pans, you should come and see my room," said Draco suddenly, loud and bright. "It's actually rather lovely, a bit like the Slytherin dorm with all the green and the four-poster and such. The House Magic doesn't seem to be working quite right yet, but it's still very nice."
"And you'll buy me this dress?" said Ginny, showing him a short, backless thing constructed mostly of string and silk.
"I never meant –"
Malfoy gave him the tiniest of smiles, then hid it with an imperious look.
certain he was winding Harry up about Kingsley Shacklebolt and Gawain Robards.
Another pause, and Harry was about to snap himself out of it and go down to the kitchen when Malfoy spoke again.
. Harry is being gracious, why can't you?"
? Harry didn't exactly know where to find them, so he was actually quite glad of a hand, but
She smiled at him, and Harry smiled back, weakly.
Harry looked at Draco. Draco looked at the soup. A skinny older man in a Christmas hat looked between them both expectantly, until Draco seemed to remember what he was doing there and dished out another cup.
"Thanks," said Neville, giving Malfoy another uneasy look. Malfoy was absolutely rigid in his chair, white as a sheet and staring at Neville as though the man were about to eat
, need to be
"Unanimous no, is it, then?"
Adhikari herself turned out to be a slim, brown-skinned woman with a glossy bun and a manner reminiscent of Professor McGonagall, although she was much younger. She was wearing a long-sleeved blouse and jeans, which somehow failed to take away from the severity of her manner.
Unlike Andromeda's house, Grimmauld Place exploded into a mess of glitter, every banister a prickly bush of vibrant tinsel. Neville's elegant floral arrangements drowned in lametta. Their tree looked like it had been designed by a rag-tag committee of eggnog-drunk children — which was basically the case — and someone had cast a charm that covered everything in the hallway in fake snow, a spell which could not be banished and that nobody would own up to. Another nameless menace stuck magical mistletoe above the oven in the kitchen, and Harry had been obliged to kiss Ron three times so far.
"I really don't know," Dean was saying. "They etch it on with lasers or something. In like, ones and zeroes."
"How about because he doesn't want to marry a girl?" interjected Harry, unable to help himself. Draco, to his surprise, sent Harry a glare.
Harry pushed open the door and held it for Draco, casting a wandless
"Alright," said Harry, returning her shoulder barge. Twenty-four-seven Quidditch was obviously having an effect on her — she barely moved. "So what is it?"
, and Harry fumbled with Malfoy's trouser buttons, biting his lip to keep from moaning. He pushed the trousers away and wrapped a hand around Malfoy, whose hips snapped forward in a desperate, involuntary movement. Harry exhaled sharply against Malfoy's lips, thrusting his own hips, and it felt

"I see," she said, voice soft. "What sort of things are you scared of?"
"Wow.” Harry rubbed his face. "Did you look at them?"
"No using," said Harry. "You wanna do drugs, you can find somewhere else."
Then she hauled herself up to standing.

"Have you told him about the testing?" asked Hermione.
"We can fix this," he said, looking at Harry again. "Dean, tell me more about these
"What the
"You look amazing," said Ron, who was bright red from ear to neck.
It turned out to be a blessing, however, when it gave him something to think about the next day other than the fact that Malfoy was out again. Even with that distraction, he must have been quite obviously moping, because Ginny spotted it and dragged him outside to the Quidditch hoop.
The fire whooshed, and Ron and Hermione both stumbled into the kitchen. For a moment, time hung like the cloud of soot in the air, Harry's eyes trying to drink in every inch of the sight of them here together, both the same and different; Ron somehow looking even
He hesitated in the corridor, outside his bedroom. Draco glanced back at him, rolled his eyes.
"Nothing," said Harry. "There's nothing wrong, I had no trouble at all –"
"Lovely," said Ron through a mouthful, grinning when Hermione tapped him on the arm.
Malfoy snatched up his bag and swept away in one movement. The door shut behind him with a resounding crack.
Harry woke early, despite the hangover he knew most of the rest of the house would be sleeping off. After a few minutes attempting to get back to sleep, he gave up and worked in the garden for most of the morning, the better to control his impulse to keep listening out for the creak of the attic stairs.
"Um, Harry?" said Hermione. "Mind if we have some privacy?"
" he murmured, with an elegant swish over his lower body. "Cleaning Ccharm. I'd do it wandless, but you should really know the full cast. And
I've received so far."
"It's a nice idea for a tattoo," he said, shrugging one shoulder. "Far be it from me to get in the way of your strange impulses."
"Going to put that on my CV," said Harry. Malfoy sent him a glare.
"And, um, you're sort of my charge. The others agreed to you staying on the condition that I'd be the one, you know, looking after you. If you need it."
Harry was astonishingly terrible at Taboo, so he sat and watched the rest of them play. Draco, naturally, was both articulate and competitive, and nearly threw his glass of orange juice at his team-mates when they failed to guess his eloquent descriptions correctly. His team won, and then a rather drunk Dean put the Basement Jaxx album on and dragged Seamus in front of the fireplace to dance. Luna dragged Harry up to join her in a strange spiral jig, and Ginny pulled Draco up and shimmied her hips at him until he sighed and shimmied back, winking at her with his dark-lined eyes. Harry nearly dropped Luna in the middle of a spin.
"Right," agreed Malfoy, faintly. "Yes. I'll try."
"Life of luxury, is it?" said Ron through the flames, as though they hadn't spent the past two months too exhausted to speak to each other. "PJs at three in the afternoon?"
She looked at him for a long time, first in confusion, then alarm, then slowly sliding into understanding.
"Bad experience?" said Ron, wincing. "Wasn't someone dreadful, was it?"
Bill Weasley, with his sand-worn combats and white muslin shirts with no collar, his fang earring and his leather bracelets covered in cursebreaker amulets. And Sirius, particularly in pictures, a young Sirius in his leather jacket and punk studded collar, Sirius with his sleeveless shirts and turned-up jeans. And both of them in dragonhide boots, of course, like the ones Harry still wore — when he left the house, at least.
"And Lucius Malfoy does?" said Hermione, then looked annoyed at herself. "Wait, no, Ron, I'm being serious."
on the list when he finished his round of apologies the next afternoon, leaving Neville quiet, while Seamus and Ginny dealt with their feelings by doing exaggeratedly posh impressions of their respective speeches. Malfoy stayed out of the way and didn't come downstairs to get dinner, and in a fit of pique Harry sent food upstairs by spell rather than by hand.
Draco's face went through a complicated shift of emotions before settling on dark-eyed lust. He pulled Harry close again, and for a long moment Harry lost himself in the kiss, the feel of Draco's bare chest, the silk of his hair under Harry's fingers.
Harry turned around then, looking to join Ginny, Seamus and Dean dancing, just in time to catch Seamus stumble into Dean, stare at him, and then kiss him.
"Anyone of the right inclination," explained Hermione helpfully. Harry shook his head in disbelief. He'd had a few surprises on the way here, and of course there'd been
"She's all yours," said Harry, letting go, holding his hands up in surrender that was only half-mocking.
"Oh, how fortunate that you don't
Dean was dressed in jeans and a white t-shirt, stretched out long and lean across the grass. The t-shirt looked good against his dark skin. Harry crossed the garden to sit next to him, his mind churning over questions he didn't know if he should ask.
Harry slipped out of him with a wet sound, and pressed forward to devour Draco's mouth.
With a startling crack, Kreacher appeared at his elbow. He was positively vibrating, his skinny mouth stretched in a manic grin.
"That sounded painful," he said.
The road was busier now, and Malfoy seemed to be on a mission; Harry grabbed his arm to prevent them from getting separated, and Malfoy didn't shake it off.
He did end up losing to Ron, of course, but then Ron did the victory dance until Hermione was in fits of laughter, so Harry didn't mind.
"Morning, Potter.”
"Yes, well. Fat lot of good it does me when I know you're
Ginny got up to put the next album on, stripped off her Quidditch leathers and dumped them beside the record player. Then she stretched out on the floor with her head on a beanbag, Luna settling in next to her. There was a lull for a moment, as everyone listened to the now-familiar opening bars of the album. Neville tapped his foot, smiling to himself.
"To fuck me?" asked Draco, with a knowing smile.
he slid a hand under his pyjamas, trying not to think about what he was doing, and bit into his pillow as he brought himself to a hasty, guilty release.
Harry laughed like he understood the joke, and handed over the rest of his Muggle money for the albums.
"I realise now that there are a vast spectrum of evils humans will visit upon each other, when given half a chance, and I intend never to disbelieve a victim of it again. Or do the evil."
"Oh," he said. "I guess Ginevra wasn't lying."
Adhikari's office was in a tall Victorian terrace in the midst of Muggle London, not unlike Grimmauld Place, only this building was decorated with precisely manicured bushes, the windows bedecked with businesslike vertical blinds. There were several gold plaques mounted on the wall by the door — a chiropractor, a family lawyer, several independent therapists, and a media company occupying the whole top floor. Adhikari's plaque openly declared her to be a Mind Healer, and Harry wondered what the other residents of the building made of that.
At some point in the first few weeks of her stay, Luna realised that the hulking mound of old tapestry and dubious knick-knacks in one corner was a piano. She played it for a little while each evening, while Harry browsed the menu of the takeaways and tried to convince himself he wanted to eat something home-cooked and wholesome. Usually, they got Chinese.
" said Harry dejectedly. The common room, previously in various stages of deep inhalation and predatory crouching, returned to normal.
Hermione took his arm without asking, and Harry was marched back to the common room.
"You may be right. Just the paperwork, then," said Blaise.
it! I am not an
Blood rushed to Harry's face.
"I have a Mind Healer now," he said. Draco looked back at him, one brow arched.
"I'm alright, just a bit of a bug!" called Seamus weakly, in between heaves.
"Yes, Potter, don't be a child about it," said Pansy. "Just because you don't understand what it means to have responsibilities to your family name — I suppose it's hard when — "
"Don't be sorry," said Ginny dangerously, looking at Harry. "What the hell did you
"No way," said Harry, about half a second before Malfoy took a leap. Malfoy pinned him to the wall, and Harry wasn't quick enough to get his wand, and maybe Malfoy just wanted to fight...
"So, Potter…" said Pansy eventually. "Do you get off on it?"
"Probably wanted to make you think it was some great mysterious challenge," said Dean, trying not to start laughing again. Harry attempted to get a hold of himself.
"Fine," he said to nobody in particular, flinging the covers off, not bothering to dress beyond pyjama bottoms and a dressing gown.
Luna slid onto the beanbag beside her to watch. "How do you know what to order, if you only see one angle?" she said, giving the catalogue a curious poke. Her and Ginny shared a 'funny old Muggles' smile, whilst Dean rolled his eyes.
"I'm sorry," Harry replied. Shev gave him a flashing smile.
"Then I'm sure," said Malfoy. His voice was taut, like pulling on a stretched wire.
Then he went to the jewellers, and bought Hermione a quill necklace to go with her real quills, and Luna a bracelet and necklace dangling with flowers that smelled real and bees that hummed quietly as they flew. He bought Molly a locket that expanded to display twenty-four separate portraits — she would need them for the grandchildren that would surely be to come. He stopped at the herbology supply store and purchased everything the store assistant could recommend for Neville.
"I dunno what I'll do," said Harry. "Wing it, I guess."
Ginny's face caught the soft warmth of the nearby streetlight. She'd never say so, but her relief was written all over it, in the wideness of her warm brown eyes.
going to judge you for being tactless. I can't stand people who don't say what they mean."
"Yeah," agreed Harry, "But it's a buzz, isn't it? Wondering if you're going to survive and all."
In a flash, Draco was up, his hands clenched into Harry's shirt.
His mind seemed to snag on the word. It was one thing to read it in a leaflet; it was another to see someone he knew, someone who could just say it aloud, albeit with a fierce awkwardness.
"An innocent. Pure of heart and soul. Untouched by depravity, disinterested in vice —"
"Well, thanks," said Harry, sliding off the bench. "It's been interesting, but I think I'll leave the music to you."
"Ritchie," he said, as the boy jumped up for another go, "RITCHIE! I don't like you like that!"
"You're very clever, Teddy," said Harry. Teddy looked at him, nodded, and curled back into his chest.
Draco rolled his eyes, but he was smiling.
"I'd rather not have the hangover," said Hermione, a little too high-pitched to be casual.
"I have some regrets about that sometimes," he said, and looked annoyed when Harry snorted.
"Wait here a sec."
but… I don't know. It feels weird to think of him like that."
bad — "
," said Harry.
Ginny raised her eyebrows.
Malfoy showed him some more scales and made him repeat them all, gently adjusting his hand position in a way that sent shivers along Harry's spine, the whole world narrowing to just that one touch along his wrist. Harry pretended he wasn't enjoying himself, complained about every repetition, shoulder-barging Draco for a laugh as he played down a scale, and Draco played the beleaguered teacher and slapped his wrist if he went wrong. Then finally Draco let him learn a song, and he ground out a fairly dreadful rendition of Three Blind Mice, and then a better repetition when Draco looked at him sternly and told him to try again.
Harry stepped close, leaning in to talk in Malfoy's ear over the noise of the music.
Draco's words felt like ice water. Harry blinked at Draco, feeling sick and stupid, trying to figure out what to do to fix this sudden eruption into disaster.
"We're not going anywhere any time soon. We'll always be here for you, you know that?"
"Says the man wearing last night's Chudley Cannons boxers," said Seamus, voice muffled under his own arm.
Malfoy shrugged.
"Um," said Harry, sticking his hands in his pockets. "Can't, sorry."
Ron caught Harry's eye again. Harry smirked at him, and patted Hermione on the hand.
, they'd
Malfoy raised an eyebrow.
"So then the missus kicked me out. Tells me I drink too much, which is rich considering how much she profits from the likes of me."
It was fortunate that his first session with a Mind Healer was later the same week. He drafted ten owls to cancel the session, only to close his eyes and see Teddy's face. He wanted to be better. He
Harry wanted to hate that laugh, but all his bitterness didn't stand a chance against seeing genuine happiness from Malfoy. He sparkled with it, transparent as a suncatcher in the light. Harry couldn't imagine how he'd survived in Voldemort's court, being so readable.
Harry watched the room, listening with one ear. At one point, George and Seamus wandered downstairs, presumably to explore the dining room. Seamus's cousin became visibly bored with Ernie, and wandered downstairs as well. Then Susan Bones arrived, and Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Johnson came upstairs to grab snacks, shedding glitter as they went. Then Blaise Zabini came up the stairs, fashionably late and wearing a dress that looked painfully expensive. She seemed perfectly at ease despite the odd look Ernie flashed her, and settled herself next to Lavender Brown as though there was nothing at all odd about her presence. And perhaps there wasn't, because Padma Patil promptly stopped looking bored and moved to give her a kiss on the cheek, like they knew each other well.
"Malfoy," said Harry gently, "I know you had opiates in your system. Fish said you went through withdrawals. If you weren't an addict, how did that happen?"
"Like to follow the Potter gossip, do you?" countered Harry, smirking back.
"Hey... so if Gryffindor girls are kinky... your sister is a Gryffindor girl, isn't she?" teased Jack to Ron. Ron threw his pillow at him.
"Not bad. Luna and Ginny are still at the pub I think, but I had a headache."
"I'll get my coat."
"I didn't mean it like that," he said, though he had a little bit. "I thought you might be annoyed because it's going to upset Ginny."
"Malfoy…" he kept his voice low and gentle, like soothing an angry Hippogriff. "I told you, I don't blame you and I don't judge you. I just don't want to see you lose control, not when you've come so far."
“His veins were silver. Or white, I suppose,” he insists, bringing a delicious cauldron cake to his mouth. “He looked like a vampire, no,
Harry watched him wash his hands, not moving once to turn his attention away or even breath. His mind demanded his attention to each of his racing thoughts, yet all of them repeated one recurring theme: why was Malfoy here? Was he not serving house arrest?
with the window open. “Have you not noticed the well-intoxicated state of almost everyone in this room?”
She wavers, moving to drop her books back into her boundless bag, “Please, Harry.” He walks her to the door, stopping himself for shutting the door in her face at her brief touch to his arm. “Wednesday?”
Blood determines how high you jump, Potter. It determines
He doesn’t even want to read the howling newspapers coming in by the dozen every hour.
He still had no clue as to how he found himself there that night. He knew that as a member of Hermione's well-mocked club, he had to attend. Harry found it hard to keep track of everything they spoke about when he spent the majority of his time dozing away on his comfy sofa.
“Inside this folder is a punch card. You are to hand them that instead of your Union papers when you go become registered.”
Her rant about them all being
“What an improvement,” Harry scoffs, pulling away from her as she tries to pull him forward. The proximity makes his stomach clench, and now all he needs is to be alone.
Harry heard eyes digging into his skull as he began to unwrap the caramel toffee (Parkinson wanted them to ‘taste the flavorful decisions’ they’ve all made). “I Have,” he says, per protocol and choosing to ignore the baffled looks he was getting. He couldn’t hide it even if he wanted to, due to the compulsory drinks they gulped down before.
Even if Ron and Ginny had said he’d deserved it, he looked at Malfoy—
The percentage
Harry feels awkward at her answer, and his hands lift, unsure if he should comfort her or leave.
“Guess I’m not what you thought I was then,” He earns himself a rather disgustingly half-concealed smile.
“I’ll be blunt then,” He shakes the vanilla folder, sliding it across and past the makeshift opening. “I’ve been informed that the Union Committee has decided to give you immunity,”
“Bullocks,” he whispered. Ron and Hermione would have a right fit. Hell, the entire Weasley family—plus some—would be
“How about we talk like rational people?” Hermione suggests, eyes darting from Harry to Ron.
They end up panting the backyard garden. The sounds of yelling blur into the background, and Harry begins to make out her red-rimmed face through his heaving breaths. “Alright?”
hard to fix everything, trying so hard to make all of their problems go away so that when it’s time for them to sit down and breath...
“Or do it the simple way and know her match earlier and be able to plan ahead,” he shrugged. “With all your complaining, you’d think we weren’t doing her a simple favor.”
“How will you proceed?” Trulock says, locking his fingers together to stare him down. “The accused is being tried for…” He glances down at the court reporter.
Harry’s still sore about the way things had happened when that article and photo had been released. All it took was one look at him and Ginny and the accusations went flying at Godspeed.
Although he appeared to be sick to his stomach, he closed his eyes tight and announced, “Truth.” When he snatched the paper from the opened box, he stared at it with horror. He didn’t have the time to yelp before it disintegrated and golden words filled the air:
). Now, a crisp white paper sat in his palm. It was to be written on and slipped into the slot of the box.
“That’s the last Wedlock Ball.”
“I think they’re… fighting,” Neville replies, his eyes wide as their snark continued.
Harry felt shy.
“We want you to take it,” she smiles. There‘s a pause, and she side-eyes Ron, “
The male counterpart of the duo was a short, lanky wizard who shook his head full of auburn colored hair in blatant disgust. He turned to the woman, “We’ve seemed to have wasted our time on this one.”
The potion in the cauldron was now a light pink, smoking straight grey fumes that slid down the cauldron’s rim. “Two names will come from the cauldron. The contributor,” Shilpa tips down the lantern, draining his darkened, stiff blood down into the potion. They all looked like stone statues, sitting so still that their chests visibly moved with each heartbeat. “And the receiver.”
Ron grins at Harry, and then turns to Hermione who rolls her eyes and advances forward. A small smile rises on her face as she walks away from them, who are now holding each other up and stumbling after her. And then it repeats.
His skin vibrates from the familiar magic that wraps itself around him in a warm cocoon.
precious garden.
“Um, thanks,” he pushes the drink away. They sit in heavy silence, unbroken by the sounds of Ron’s swallows or Harry’s rising trepidation. “I—!”
“Mr. Potter.” He jumped, embarrassed to find them all, minus Malfoy, staring at him. Trulock nodded towards the Pensieve seated on a tall, black table chair. “Are you able to extract your memories on your own?”
“Don’t be rude, Harry,” It’s the all warning he gets before she shoves the pan into his arms. “I’m personally volunteering you to put the pan in the oven.” She’s outside the kitchen mid his alarm.
He squatted down by the start of the small forest, a wandering chicken passing by him with a confused squall. The blue flowers that had always littered the Burrow’s grass were dying; wilted.
“—if we can just time it right, I’m certain it will work!” Hermione stresses, leaning over the coffee table to point at the unstructured mess she’d thrown onto the tabletop. “We can do it.”
His previous talks of zeal were mellowed out by realization that he was speaking to a wall of pureblood supremacy. He needed to bring Ginny so that she could make her own decision. He couldn’t make it for her, no matter what bullshit came out of Nixon’s mouth.

She’s trying to figure out whether or not they were meant to add the four eggs that they’d add, and he’s pouring flour into the soppy mix in a sad attempt to save it. “It says to blend vegetable oil, water, 2 eggs, and the provided cake mix into a medium sized mixing bowl—!”
Harry might’ve regretted taking interest in their conversation if he’d have known the end result. Yet since he couldn’t very well tell the difference between genuine interest or drawled sarcasm, he knew he had to save Neville. He set his paper cup on the floor beside him and looked to the panicked man in front of him. “Weren’t you doing a report in Charms for something like this?”
”No, no, listen,” she tells him. “You shouldn’t be going through this alone—you shouldn’t be dealing with this at all. How is it always you? To be burdened by the emotions of others? It’s always you who helps us, and it’s always us that takes you for advantage.”
The tone was patronizing, and Trulock laid it thick enough so that the rest of the Council felt they were allowed to teeter along. Kingsley coughs, “The accused does not—!”
“Bleh!” Harry screeched, falling over onto the floor and clutching the spot where the three month old poked him with his slobbery toy dragon.
Harry had never been the shy type during sex. He didn’t come to be shy and cover his face or flush to his throat in bashfulness, no, he came for the fucking. No one he had sex with had ever, ever wanted to do it slow and loving—no one before Malfoy.
Hermione’s staring at him when Ron clears his throat. “I’ve got one! I’ve got one…” He blinks for a second, taking a look at his and Hermione’s equal candy sets. “Never Have I Ever been in love.” He’s too satisfied when Hermione rolls her eyes with a huff and starts unwrapping one of hers along with him.
Malfoy exhaled, “You’re staring quite loudly, Potter.”
He’s happy to see the man’s face glow. “We could use a charm to tell when someone’s faking, maybe! There’s this spell that..”
“Ginny, this is soaked!” He flings a floury-egg chunk at her, and she dodges with a grin. “I reckon it’s not gonna come out the kinda ‘moist’ you want it to be.” He frowns down at the stains on his blue tattered t-shirt and then at the bowl. “We should just drink it like a shake at this point.”
“Oh, but we can and we’d still have the public on our side. It’s within all parties rights, you see.” He slid the last paper out of the foldier, and pointed to a dare on the calendar:
“It’s not your fault, Harry.” She sets three different thick volumes on the table in front him. “Just… just try to speak to me about these things.”
It’s wonderful—it’s home.
Hermione pulls her head up from inside, and says, “He’s been well.”
(“What if you had taken my virginity?” He’d asked Draco one day, caressing the blond strands as his abdomen was kissed with that unique sense of post-orgasm laziness. Malfoy had hummed onto his navel, “I don’t think I could’ve done it.” When Harry had asked why, he told him, “You were beautiful then, in an odd way. In a way that I wouldn’t have been able to ruin,” he appeared uncomfortable when he added, with a sneer, “Besides, I like you this way. Even if you are a little shit sometimes.” He earned himself a rather disgusting kiss)
Seamus went next, and Harry felt everything he’d ever felt after Sirius had died in the few seconds before he spoke.
Chatter flooded the courtroom, accompanied by the greedy photographers, who’d begin flashing their cameras in his face and near blinding him. The leering newspaper columnists shouted questions, each trying to outshout the other in the hopes that he would answer the loudest.

“Yeah...but you’re good now.”
“As soon as we get a response,” Ron says, “we’ll head over, yeah?”
Harry may be crumbling under the stress of living, but he still has pull at this school. No one fucks with him and now that protection extends to Draco, as it should’ve long ago.

Harry is so glad she’d gotten back to him quickly. He scribbles out a reply with a quill Hermione had tucked into the hair she’d gathered in a bun on the top of her head to send it back with Ullr, the spotted black owl, who waits patiently in the sky above the table.
“We should get going,” Harry says instead of something he might regret. “Got a lot of land to cover before noon tomorrow.”
Sterling gets lost in the crowd as the song continues and people pat him on the back in congratulations.
He has to check to make sure she’s joking—she is—and then he fakes a smile. Draco’s doing the same thing, looking uncomfortable, but she doesn’t notice.
Someone’s blue rag is dangling above her head, threatening to fall any minute. He looks down from the rag to her hands that cover her face.
“Where would you prefer to sign?”
Kingley sends him a letter on the ninth, explaining to him that Malfoy had been transferred to the manor to carry out his probation sentence while under his mother’s care. It’s a relief to know that he is no longer supervised by the vengeance hungry Auror newbies.
“Almost two hundred people volunteered today, Harry,” Hermione explains in one breath, textbook just about slipping through her fingers in her livened mood. “
He dusts his hand, and frowns at the silence. “Gin?” he calls out, trailing into the sitting room. “You alright?”
There’s a guilty look on Harry's face, and it was there for the wrong reason. “You were, weren’t you, you cheeky bint!” Ron guffaws loud, rough when he reaches over it tap his shoulder. Harry flushes, ducking his head to watch as the bottle spun, because he wasn’t.
Pressure prodded from behind his eyes, pulsing when Hermione slammed the book shut in frustration. His teeth clenched, eyes flicking closed as well, at the heaviness in his head.
the Blood law that we’ve all been dedicating ourselves to. We’re all law-abiding citizens, aren’t we now?” He holds out the quill.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione pushes back her dull hair, bloodshot eyes connecting to his red rimmed ones. “We’ve always gone through the craziest shit together, you know? Why would we be stupid enough to stop now?”
He cradled the cold glass of cranberry juice in his fingers, thumbing at the slippery slope of the top. It was a hot day, he notes.
All his memory could serve him was the brightness, the happiness he’d radiated under the pretense losing his flowers had hurt him.
Ron’s nose creases like he’s smelling something bad. “If they’re just a show, then why didn’t they reject Ginny’s exemption papers?” He glances between them both, unease building in his posture. “She showed them to me, and they’re verified.”
“We will start the accused’s proceeding in less than ten minutes,” Trulock says, rubbing his eyelids and flogging the handkerchief moisture free. “Do you have any other evidence to submit?”
Ron stares at him from across the training room—his past nine attempts seem so loud in the moment. Harry chooses to be quiet.
Red envelopes begin to fall from the grey clouds, one landing in Harry’s chicken soup, two on Hermione's lap, and three more scattered throughout the tabletop.
“I is not liking the guest room curtains. I be tearing them down,” Kreacher grunts, sidling close to him, making his comment and then popping away when Harry begins opening his mouth.
Yet then they make do eye contact, and Harry begins paying for it with the look of coldness he gets. The accomplishment fades and there is a rising mortification settling in its place.
She gives him a once-over, standing up to throw her empty cup away. “If you say so.”
She pats his stunned face once more, twice, and then she’s gone in a flurry of hand sewn clothing.
He turned from him, ignoring his presence, and calling in other groups of Unspeakables and Potioneers. Harry had no trouble walking away from him either.
“Harry,” Kingsley murmurs just as Harry’s head falls down into his trembling hands. “No one will consider you selfish if you take it.”
Harry did believe that he deserved hatefulness he’d given out through the years. Yet found himself wincing at the near-brutal treatment he’d received from his Auror’s the few times he’d seen him in the Auror Department.
Hermione tries to enter Grimmauld several times before she figures out Harry has spelled her out of the wards. He doesn’t leave his room, but Kreacher has become much more solemn.
Ron sits up in alarm. “But Mum—!”
“Yeah,” Dean agrees, throwing a nervous glance at Harry as he adds just as quick, “Not that I’ve ever doubted for a second that you haven’t or anything.”
“Never Have I Ever…” Seamus’ eyes light up. “Never Have I Ever been shy during sex.” He wiggles his eyebrows, laughing as Dean shoved him aside. Several ‘I Have’s went around the room, though some tried to be sneak and unwrap their candies.
Harry supposed he’d outgrown his habit of doing things he wasn’t meant to be doing.
“Sod off, Parkinson,” Harry snapped, his anger rising before he could calm himself. Hermione was narrowing her eyes in disgust while Ron’s fists did the staring. At their contempt, she bristled.
Seamus, tongue loose and shameless after 4 pints, points out, “I thought he was a virgin.”
What he could never bring himself to see was this disarray of order the war had caused. This shining fury had embedded itself, deep and shallow, into the chains of the Weasley family.
Fleur and Ginny were busy chopping up vegetables by the time he’d made it to the backyard.
“Yeah!” Ron nodded in a haste, a nod that would solve all of the problems in the world. Hermione looked on in exasperation at her boyfriend, who ignored her and peeked around to see Harry. “Harry, mate, Dean’s gonna—!”
Two of the ten Aurors stood by the lifts drew their attention to him as he slinked closer. “Sir, we require a distance of 10 feet away from the lifts.” His words were resigned and weary, and he clenched at his wand as though awaiting Harry’s duel proposition.
Hermione’s eyes shoot to the chair beside Ron, and then back up to Harry. He fiddles with his utensils. The silence goes on for a couple more minutes with Ron and Harry determined to ignore each other.
“Uh, it’s,” he squirmed under Trulock’s glare. “It’s in my mind.”
He ends up having to spray down and scrub the changing mat once he wipes Teddy and puts him into new nappy. He’s never seen so much baby poop in his life.
Kingsley unchains Malfoy, grabbing him by the arms and pulling him up. Harry goes to move forward, but the older man gives him a dark glare. Kingsley hurried out the courtroom, his entourage-in-training following him and sneaking peeks at Harry as they went.
The last time he tried to sooth a girl from tears—she’d put bacon on his burger though he requested her not to—she passed out from hyperventilation.
“Yes, yes, we know, Longbottom. We are ever so gracious for your suggestion, but we need more than that. Have you any way of, say, altering this game of yours with magic?” At his embarrassed meep, she turned her scrutinizing gaze elsewhere.
cheered. He brought up his cup of water and cheered for her as well, because Hermione deserved it all and more.
he was doing at Draco Malfoy’s trial.
Blaise Zabini had to take his shirt off, which earned him a few catcalls and wolf whistles. He made a show of it too, canting his hips and flexing his torso. Harry had eyes; he knew Zabini was attractive. But when he opened his eyes, all he saw was blonde hair and grey eyes and pale skin. It was no surprise that he found his gaze wandering behind Zabini instead of at him.
“There’s no need for the hostile attitude, Mr. Potter. Cockburn and Mannings are babysitters, at best,” the Chief Warlock’s indifference filled the room, swallowing the Wizengamot members into a solid petrification. “That appears to be all that their person is good for.” They quivered.
He wipes his hands on his denim jeans, leaning forward to take a glance at her familiar script.
It was silent when the alarmed noises were muffled by the slamming doors. The women settled back onto the wall, nodding back to Trulock.
. He slumps down onto the grey sheets in quick lurches, curling into himself with every agitated twitch. The room crackled red around him, shifting into a yellowish orange hue.
“You won’t even hear me out?” She huffed, gathering her papers into her hands and opening her small bag. It was webbed together with an Extension Charm that held together the chaos inside. “Honestly, it’s a brilliant plan! I’m certain it would’ve worked.”
None of them are good colors, but his heart is cheering bright, magic beating in wild thrums with it.
“They didn’t have a choice; they were outvoted by the Wizamagot.” Kingsley’s words are interrupted by two timid knocks on his door. “Yes?”
He’d managed to glimpse above the hoard, and he caught platinum blond flashing over the bodies closing in on him. Near the head, Kingsley stood by pressing his entire hand to his forehead.
“Fine,” she lifted her lip at him, jerking her head at Longbottom who began to twist the pale green bottle posing as an innocent on the floor. Her bitterness would bite at herself as the slide of the bottle drowned her out.
“That concludes the
“This is illegal,” Harry seethed, dropping the files onto the desk in aversion. “Doing something like this won’t just make just me your enemy—you’ll be an enemy to the public.”
Sometimes, when he sobbed out
It was almost too easy to give up everything for Malfoy, and maybe that’s why he did it. For the effortlessness in his accountability.
They would do anything except their jobs.
the work! I shouldn’t have to do extra ‘cause you’re afraid of the oven!”
“Yes, yes,” Trulock waved his hand, pinching his index and thumb to his glasses' thin wires. “How will you proceed?”
His bones were gaunt, stretching around his skin that was smeared deep with dirt and dust. The spelled chains didn’t help in his distressed appearance, because he looked worse than he did before.
“Lose it?” Harry glances away from the sparkles in the air to stare at Hermione in question. “Lose what?”
Each time he passes Mrs. Weasley, he tells her, “I’ll help too, Mrs. Weasley.” She never fails to reply, “It’s nothing to worry a hair on your head about, dear.”
“But—you—I…” he turns to Harry, eyes wide and worried. Hermione pulls Harry down with a fast jerk, ignoring his cries of pain to smile at him.
The room was circular, similar to the chambers' chilled iron walls. Harry looked around, and his gaze sought out Malfoy who was still chained to his chair but with the women from earlier guarding him. Kingsley was nowhere to be found.
His torso tugs up in the air, once more, twice more, and—
And suddenly, his fingers couldn’t quite keep up as they threw—insults? he didn’t know—out Never Have I Ever’s. Malfoy’s conflicted face was a blur for him in his anger—the blond said something, but it was missed.
With every word, Harry found it harder to concentrate on the task at hand and not hex the Chief Warlock.
He rolled around for the dramatics, and, ah, yes, there it was.
He wishes he hadn’t been so hasty and rushed; and, to him, sometimes he fell asleep wondering what life would be like if it were Malfoy.
Harry never asked about it.
Not when Malfoy had been forced to stand at his Father’s trial and watch him be kissed. Harry couldn’t find any sympathy for the despicable man, but he found himself wincing in the sight of Draco Malfoy.
He lowered the silvery memory strand to plop it into the Pensieve, misplacing several key components by ‘accident’ (his Invisibility cloak, him and Dumbledore in the Crystal Cave, too many). Trulock examines the swirling liquid settling into the Pensieve, before nodding once more.
the guilty relief and it hurt the both of them. They hadn’t spoken since it occurred yesterday, and everything was fine.
Another store worker pulls him towards the back of the store while Auror Ackern goes to help out the workers attempting to soothe the racket. He’s shoved out the store’s exit; there’s no farewell or goodbye.
They’re not paying much attention to the camera, because they’re walking through the Entrance Hall. He doesn’t recall the particular moment, but Ron says something that causes Hermione to wrinkle her nose in disgust. Harry, however, bursts out into uncontainable laughter which makes Ron continue with amused liveliness. Harry stretches over to shove Ron, his other hand grazing the wall to upright himself up in the midst of his howling fit.
want to be outed because of something as silly as unrepressed jealousy—he’d also sit with something as silly as jealousy in his veins.
“I’ll take his place!” announces Lisa Turpin, a girl in which he had never known but now knew with nothing but annoyance.
“Proof by memory,” Trulock hummed after spending an uncomfortably long time staring at Harry. “Very well then.” He motions to a stiff witch pressed inside the aisle to the chambers exit.
“Master Harry be receiving another letter,” Kreacher spits, handing Harry a crinkled letter that almost lands in his eggs from how fast his wrinkled hand swings it.
The press at best wanted to be entertained to the maximum. His story, his thoughts, his legacy: simple gossip to be whispered on the sheets of magazines and newspapers.
Harry would get a peek at Hermione rubbing her arm, and he couldn’t lie that the urge to agree did come on a few occasions.
case, it became a hushed affair on the inside and a booming marketable cause on the outside.
His anger evaporated to fear at the raspy voice tickling his ears.
Harry sits down in the faded leather chair placed in the front of Hermione’s sofa. She purses her lips, her grip tightening on her bag when he responds, “You’re right.”
“Then why did you tell me to mix in 4 eggs?” He cries out, pouring half a flour bag into the watered down cake. It was overflowing at this point, pink beads dribbling down the rim.
“Nixon isn’t gonna make me do any weird shit, Gin,” he comments, hustling up to pat her calf in consolation. “But your concern is very much appreciated.”
“Yeah, yeah, fuck you too,” he smiles, opening the oven door and shifting the the pan so that he can pull on some oven mits. He manages to slip the pan into the huffing oven without burning anything.
“I don’t like the way it looks,” he tells her, and her fingers twitch as though they were itching to reach forward and strangle him. There’s a knock on the door, and they both look to see Ron squeeze himself inside and slam the door closed from the power of his locking spell.
“I know,” he reminds her, despite the fact that she was the one reminding him every few days. “Ron’s expecting you.”
“They left to the Unification Committee once Kingsley said you were with him,” Ginny looks up when they both hear Mrs. Weasley’s calling for her.
“It’s the Ministry, Harry,” Hermione reflects, standing to gather their plates—snatching Ron’s away, doing away all of his last minute attempts at a tug-of-war to nab the last slab of chicken.
He’s never seen Hermione so broken down and defeated; not during the Horcrux Hunt, not during the obliviation of her parents, not during Ron’s abandonment.
He points to the additional drink. In his nervousness, Harry grabs it in relief and downs a gulp.
This is why he begins unwrapping his candy, reddening when Hermione and Ron did as well. He hung his head when Malfoy started at his first piece too. No matter how many times the other told him otherwise, deep down Harry thought of himself as a whore. It did lessen everyday with his kisses—i’ll never let you go—and his touches. Because those were special; they were intimate and rare and they were Harry’s.
Ron stares at him with disbelief. “You’ve been in love, Harry?”
He’s never given an interview; he will never give an interview.
she said with more force. “It wasn’t anything you did. I don’t know. I was still…”
He gave all the plants he weeded names—Spout, Plum, Snow, and Blueberry, they were sharp in his memory. They were his sole friends, the ones he could sneak past Dudley’s lackeys and the tick in Petunia’s perfection.
At the moment, his mind was elsewhere and the sense that he had left was about to be put to the test in his mission to sort through his mail. The little wards that he did have blocked any unknown letters and senders that he didn’t key to the barrier.
Harry’s grip on his wand loosens, knuckles jerky in the fast race to get to it. It was a letter from Ron. He vanishes the envelope, skimming down the small paragraph all while remembering Hermione’s request for a fire call.
“Well, Longbottom?”
Hermione crosses her arms and huffs.
In Family, he usually receives an exact number of 3 letters from Andromeda once a week, and a couple from Mrs. Weasley depending on if she was feeling her particular sadness at the fact he that he only visited a single time that month
While she heats up his bottle, Harry goes to work changing Teddy.
“Oh,” she blinks, turning away with a flush in her cheeks. “Well, I—!”
—and he winced.
different, ‘mione.” Just as he suspected, the second he dropped the towel down onto the table it popped away to wherever Kreacher did laundry. He points his wand at his shirt, and nearly tumbles backwards at the strong gust of wind that billows out from his wands tip. “Why should I be the only one to receive special treatment?”
“Dare?”
“You were not permitted to hand out your exemption notice, but you did so without authorization,” he pulled out a quill and twirled the feather across the printed letters on the file. “You’ve caused so much trouble for the Administrative Registration Department.”
She jolts to life. “Well, I continued my research and did some reviewing on the guidelines—!”
He told Hermione this, and, as any other time he told her something she would find disappointing in a moderate sense, her lips pursed and she turned away. She still asked him if he were coming, because
“Harry?” Hermione taps the dining table to gain his attention. He blinked, and she rolled her eyes. “I
All he knew was that Seamus had raised his sour-smelling cup and declared loss. Loss for the piss-poor party being hosted and his pissed high. It could have very well been the way Parkinson’s eyes gleamed with interest as he spoke.
Harry grit his teeth. “Ginny doesn’t have to attend the Wedlock Ball—she can choose her partner.”
Forget the past, have children, and don’t teach Dark magic.
Piles of white envelopes spilled from the basket, slapping at the floor and overflowing from the confined space. It stopped pouring over after a while.
There was a clattering of glass to the floor, and he looked down at his side. Kreacher’s homemade Treacle Tart was still smoking and warm.
They didn’t tell him why the contract was awakened, or what the contract did. They did tell him that he had orders to destroy it.
Harry was surprised Hermione had even allowed it—by Ron’s face, he was too. Her flush was bright when the members of the
“This is
“Glowing?” Hermione gave a short laugh, dusting her hands of bread crumbs from her fingers. They both ignore Kreacher’s anguished cry. “That’s a new one.”
“We’ve all been through hell these last couple of months, Granger. I’m aware that you like to stick to your rigid morals, but some of us are more uninhibited to indulge ourselves in these types of behaviors,” she pauses, taking a moment of silence to glance at Hermione. “If only you’ll allow us the opportunity?”
“I know what you told me, it’s just…”
Due to all the presses popularization of the
He’d migrated to the garden once he apparated there, bypassing all of the desolate cheerfulness being thrown at him. George hadn’t been able to attend, Hermione told him.
He didn’t mind it though, because the elf’s presence was a comforting familiarity that he almost never got these days.
The court went silent. Photographers held their cameras pressed to their faces so that they may catch the perfect photo.
Harry sits, careful and cautious, near a couple of orchids. A familiar yellow-tinted paper is thrown into his lap, however, too unfamiliar for him to comprehend its whereabouts.
It’s nearly midnight when he finally shows up, already freshly showered, still in his robes.
“Always worth a try, Potter,” Draco says with a smirk. “Tell me about it sometime?”
Harry rolls his eyes and levels the wand at Draco’s chest, takes a deep breath, and recites,
“No. It’s a potions ingredient with calming qualities if used correctly.” Draco’s grin is beautifully wicked. “My mum taught me how to hex it.”
up to no good. Everything I did here is tainted with the memory of him.”
“I’m hurting you?” Harry asks softly, confused. “How do you feel when you’re around me?”
“Or maybe I just didn’t. I, uh, didn’t get out much as a kid.”
his broom and fly away with explaining himself to anyone ever again. Live a quiet life as a muggle, work a menial job.
This is punishment for the fruit. Harry’s sure something has come to seek revenge for tearing apart that tree and its fruit. Perhaps using the pronoun “its” in reference to the tree is insulting to her, who has enough wherewithal to know when her children are gone, so Harry changes his stance.
Draco has some difficulty with the next part, so Harry helps him roll a few Hotsy joints in the freshly hexed parchment. Then they light one with their wands and smoke it.
Draco shakes his head, determined as Harry was, and then he takes Harry’s entire dick into his mouth. Or as much as he can fit. The heat and the pressure is so much it’s enough, finally. Harry is literally going to die.
“I won’t let anyone near you. I was giving you space, you know, because that’s what I thought you needed. That’s what the books say to do, anyway. Space and time. But I missed you...and...and you need help and that’s what friends are for.”
“I can’t wait for a bath,” Harry says, “and some coffee. And a cigarette.”
“Why do you say that?” Harry takes a bite. Tastes fine to him.
“Perhaps. With what McGonagall has planned, though, it might just get worse.”
“Stars.”
He’s nervous this conversation isn’t going to go over well. Worries Draco will yell or scream or even leave Harry where he stands.
of innocent people! My friends, my family. I won’t get better, Draco, because this is my life. I’ve used all 3 Unforgivable curses, I cursed you almost to death, my uncle died because I couldn’t control the fucking link I had with Tom fucking Riddle! I have done so much shit that it’s eating me alive and you’re worried about me suddenly overcoming it and writing you off?”
He can still hear the tree’s desperate cries, its grief at knowing its children will be eaten mercilessly. He feels sick, like if he had anything besides a bezoar and the remnants of the poison
“Promise me you’ll see a mind healer.”
“I’m just calling this meeting to wish you luck and to tell you that you must have your possessions submitted by midnight tonight so they can be checked over by a professor. Any instances of cheating or bad sportsmanship will not be tolerated and will result in an immediate Troll. If there are any questions—”
“Not true.”
Not necessarily a lie. In fact, it’s the truth. Ron did send the Malfoys a letter. Someone
Harry doesn’t know much about music, so he drops out of the conversation and tries to spot Draco from around the corner. When he does, he’s startled silent.
“Funny,” Draco says softly, to himself. “These must be magical.”
There’s a blanket behind him and his pillow that he
“How could I leave you here when you so obviously deserve a place at my side in that goddamn forest?”
“Thanks,” Harry says flatly as Hermione elbows Ron in the ribs. “You look great.”
Harry’s surprised, but happy about it. He hasn’t kissed Draco since the holidays and he’d missed the warmth it brought to his chest, mised the fire singing in his veins, the burn of Draco’s skin against his. Harry kisses him back, one hand pressed to the pillow to the right of his body to hold himself up, one knee balancing him by Draco’s thigh.
Draco’s face changes, finally, relieving some of Harry’s guilt and anxiety, and then he hesitates.
“Good night, Harry,” Draco says softly, that strange thoughtful look still on his face.
“Yes...and he took it so personally when those assholes called me a traitor or whatever.”
She smiles while she lifts her wand and creates a shining lights display. Fireworks explode indoors in dazzling colours and rain down on them like rain drops. It’s beautiful and tragic and incredible all at once.
“Have I ever apologized,” Harry whispers fiercely, “for the incident in 6th year?”
“Harry?” Hermione holds his face in her hands, looking so worried that she might cry. “Talk to me, Harry, please!”
There’s a letter on his bed in scratchy, uneven handwriting on wrinkled, thin parchment. He doesn’t immediately recognize it.
“I’ll set up some wards, alright?” Draco says softly, looking a little worried. “You should go inside. Have a drink of water, yeah?”
He sneaks out into Hogsmeade just after dinner to Apparate into Muggle London. He’s looking for something a little stronger than his cigarettes tonight and he finds it in an old friend.
“The Ministry have decided the dates for which you will spend your days in the Forest. Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy will open the exams on the first weekend of April. After that, will be Miss. Granger and Miss. Bones the following weekend and then..."
“If anyone so much as looks at him, you’ll deal with me. I don’t care what you think he is, because I know he isn’t. Got it?”
It’s no wonder they’re still attached, still linked, with all the weird shit they did just to spy on one another. They were invested.
“How do you even know what that is?!”
“I’m kind of in love with you,” Harry says whilst staring at him, “but I don’t want to scare you by telling you yet.”
“Shh.” Draco kisses him again, opens his mouth and Harry can taste toothpaste on his tongue.
Harry can barely walk. He hasn’t stood in almost a week, has been left to sit and lay on a cold, stone floor, so he’s so dizzy and cramped that his legs barely work. Ron puts one arm over his shoulders and Hemione holds him at his waist.
Loyalty is a trait that Harry most admires, so his fondness grows for the smushed-faced cat after he hears the tale.
Or not dealing with it. Harry’d just sort of ignored it and hoped it would go away. Doesn't make up for the fact that Ron didn't tell him afterwards and neither did Hermione.
Asks Luna’s partner, Pansy, settling down across from her on the bench with a somewhat annoyed look and exasperated breath.
“Harry!” Cries Mrs. Weasley, running towards him with tears in her eyes. “Oh, dear boy, you scared the
and walks along.
The pain of the tragedy that is his life chokes him even more than the kiss itself. He is dying, for real this time, and he is unable to stop it.
Harry's breath catches as he enters, looking as regal as a king and as evil as the devil himself.
Draco opens his mouth and kisses Harry even harder, grasping his hands in the back of Harry’s shirt so tight it’s pulled taught around his shoulders.
“That is so bizarre! What other kind of laws do they have?”
Harry uses
A week? How isn’t Harry dead?
“Call me Narcissa, alright? No need for formalities anymore.”
“Oh, bloody hell. What now?”
The sun, which Harry can see somewhat now in the sparsity of the trees in this part of the forest, is high in the sky. Almost noon, perhaps. He checks the time to be sure, though, with
“Will you…Nevermind.”
“I expected you’d Floo here, to be honest.” Draco puts his book down to stand up.
“Potter, wait.” Draco’s eyebrow is still furrowed. “Wait a second. Stop eating.”
“Every second of pain was worth it just to have this. Have you.” Draco’s voice shakes and Harry just has to kiss him again.
He hopes Luna’s his partner. After all, she’s the one he’s closest to from a different house. Plus, he enjoys her bable of weird, obscure creatures and places. It might even come in handy in the Forbidden Forest which will surely be well stocked with strange beings and plants.
“What?”
on him and Draco.
Harry laughs a little when Pig ruffles through his hair—now long beyond the point of shaggy—and hoots from the new perch. It’s the first time Harry's felt any lightness at all in his chest.
“Then believe in
“Marijuana. Is it popular for Muggles to get high?”
“No, no. She was looking for vengeance.
“What else was I s’posed to do with it?
He pushes past Harry and stalks through the door, posture perfect, shoulders straight, beautiful as ever. He seems more anxious somehow, though, so Harry frowns at him.
The weekend in the forest seems to have softened some of his distaste for Hogwarts while further scarring him emotionally at the same time. He’s grown from the experience, yes, but he makes a mental note to tell Headmistress McGonagall that he doesn’t feel it should be an alternative offered in the following years; It’s just too dangerous for kids who didn’t die once already in a war, you know?
Underneath the headline is a moving picture of Draco and Harry walking the halls together quietly, both looking somber and exhausted. If that is truly what Harry looks like—a skeleton with skin and hair, more dead than alive—then maybe he should eat. Maybe he should get it together. Because no living person looks like that.
“Potter,” he says firmly, but his breath quivers at the end.
Broken bones, surely, but death? Who knows.
“You’re gonna have to make it up to me, then.”
-d from his room so he wouldn’t have to move. There's a plate of barely eaten, three day old cheese toasties and a cold cup of tea beside his new bed that a house-elf had mysteriously brought him.
By breakfast the next morning, there’s another publication.
Draco’s eyebrows rise up far on his forehead and Harry almost grins. But then he remembers the look in Draco’s eyes on the night Dumbledore died and the grin passes. His brief amusement fades even quicker than it arrived.
He draws Harry’s attention to a row of bright red and green flowers that he actually recognizes.
Harry sniffles, wipes the tears off of his face, and sighs. Mr. Weasley is the next to squeeze what little life he has left out of him. Then Headmistress McGonagall tears him a new arsehole for running off and worrying everyone.
Ron. We need to look our best for the Malfoys.”
Harry hates Muggle football, so he doesn’t give a fuck about whoever it is and he doesn’t pretend to. In fact, he sort of stops seeing his friends all together. He spends a lot of time smoking cigarettes off of the old astronomy tower balcony by himself, shivering against the memories of death and decay, and rotting the lungs out of his chest one breath at a time.
Harry diverts his eyes and sighs. Says, “Family isn’t the word I’d use to describe them...but no, not really.”
and finds it’s 10:59.
Harry yawns, too, and nods. Perhaps he’ll try one of Malfoy’s potions tonight in order to blackout completely. Dreamless sleep or Draught of Peace or maybe he’ll press his wand against his chest and say those two unforgivable words and get lots of rest for eternity.
Ron sends out an owl to new Malfoy Manor telling them they’ll be arriving sometime in the evening. Apparently, Pigwidgeon is still unchanged after everything, because he flies around the Great Hall for several moments to garner attention and then preens under all the students’ curious-eyed gazes in the exact way he used to.
“Draco!” He still doesn’t touch him, doesn’t want to startle him too badly, but it’s inevitable.
It’s reality shattering. Harry watches him, watches his back arch, watches his hands become fists in the blanket. Watches him cry out Harry’s name as he comes, looking so handsome and regal and beautiful it’s probably illegal. Harry is so lucky.
He’s not sure how long it takes, how long he sits there, rocking and crying to himself, but the noise quiets. He feels arms on his shoulders, holding him in place. Hears something other than the screaming of hateful words.
Christmas comes around and Draco goes home to his mother, leaving Harry pretty much alone for the holiday. Then Luna and Pansy go, too, so he really
“Granger had to rescue you?” He whispers, sounding as exhausted as Harry feels. “From a mob?”
Harry looks over at his friends, at his fellow eighth years, and he grins, despite himself. He hasn’t been drunk off firewhiskey in a little while and wants to feel the rush and fire of it once again. Who fucking cares what tomorrow or this weekend will bring? Harry needs to forget everything and be free. Fuck it all.
The woods smell like wet grass and fresh dirt and rain, which is usually a peaceful sort of smell, but Harry flashes back. He feels disjointed, like he doesn’t belong here, and off kilter. He starts to sweat despite the cool April temperature and his breath comes out in frantic puffs as they walk across fallen trees and beds of glowing magical moss.
He doesn’t say anything for a while. He lets his rage and annoyance fester in his chest like an illness, unchecked by a doctor, until he can bear it no more. Until it spills out of him like water out of a full bathtub.
Winter turns to early spring and the snow stops.
“I slept in a closet underneath the stairs that my aunt and uncle locked when they didn’t want to see me, which was most of the time. Sometimes they’d forget to feed me for days. My cousin was significantly larger than I was, and yet I still got his hand me downs. When I came to Hogwarts, those were the only new pair of clothes I’d ever gotten before.”
Sobs wrack his chest and he crumples down, holding Harry’s body to his chest. The boy who lived has died.
“Draco,” Harry says, kneeling beside him. “What’s wrong?”
So they sort of become friends, in a weird way. Partners, as McGonagall had said on their first day of 8th year, in their descent to hell.
“Draco?” He calls out.
his voice shakes, like he’s already crying. “You think you’re protecting me from something I don’t give a
“Also…” Harry turns around suddenly to dig rapidly through his trunk until he comes up with a thin, wooden stick. “Here.”
By midday, Harry’s tracking spell says there’s not much distance left to go before the Portkey, so they stop to rest. They’re both feeling alright, despite the general lack of sleep and food between them, and are excited to get the fuck out of this hellhole.
“Stay here, alright? I have to have a look around.”
“Harry,” he says softly, “what’s wrong?”
McGonagall had an entire new tower built for Trelawney and everyone else, but decided to keep this as a memorial to her good friend, Albus. It’s supposed to be off limits, because the structure is crumbling and the foundation is cracked and magic is the only thing still keeping it upright, but Harry’s yet to be yelled at for going inside. Probably because they think he’s there to honour Dumbledore’s memory or something.
“Shopping? I
Admittedly, he’s a bit nervous. What if Draco tells them not to come? What if he’s already done something irreversible?
He’s a little lightheaded from the potion and exhaustion, but he’s alright. He’s awake and he’s alive.
Then Pig is gone, doing a triple axle mid-air and disappearing through an open window with an immense amount of elegance. Harry’s smile fades, but he feels it in his chest like the waves of a warm summer breeze: here one moment and then he's gone the next.
It looks down upon them, flying at half or even less than its original size, and Harry has to fight back the urge to run. This is his patronus now, for better or for worse, and he tells it what to do. It means neither him nor Draco no harm, even if the memory of the heat from the
Draco strips down to his underwear and puts on silk pajamas before he gracefully slides into Harry’s bed.
Harry finds himself sharing sparks with a lemon-yellow apple. The sparks are small and bright purple and probably harmless. Are probably just a side effect of the magic used to keep the tree and fruit safe in the cold April air.
“Potter?” Draco’s eyes open gently and there are tears on his face. “Was I…?”
Harry pulls back to smile and kisses him. It’s a truly brilliant moment and Draco is so happy Harry’s alive.
“Draco,” he whispers and his eyes are shut.
“Work this out,” is all she says, in a quiet and strong voice.
“Abandon me here in this-this
They scramble out of the tent and Harry quickly collapses the tent with the counterspell to the one that opens it up. It takes a few seconds, though, for Draco to shove the unpitched tent into the endless knapsack and that’s when Harry seems to see it.
After what feels like forever, but is probably a kilometre or so, they slow. Harry pulls out his wand to cast the mapping spell and finds they’ve gone in a diagonal to the way they had planned, running deeper into the forest than they needed to.
Draco is at his side, face unreadable, tucked up tightly in his winter robes. They share a look, one full of anxiety and unrest, and then they step up towards the magical fence.
Harry casts
Fuck. What was it?
“A new diet, exercises, therapy, studying. All in order to get Os on our tests.” Hermione smiles.

a warming charm, over Harry so he stays nice and toasty for what must be an outside adventure. He turns his wand presses it into Harry’s hand so Harry can do one for him.
“Make me a promise,” Hermione says, suddenly serious.
Harry’s so hard it hurts, but he has other things to worry about when Draco looks so especially beautiful like this, eyes half-shut, mouth open, chest rising and falling rapidly. God.
“No, no. Maybe for a cold, but not for this.”
that killed Crabbe still burns hot against his skin.
Susan doesn’t seem to even realize that the headline is right in Draco’s face, but Hermione does the honours this time. She takes it gently from Susan’s hands and burns it to ash in the air behind their table so the ash doesn’t ruin anyone’s meal. She meets Harry’s eyes and he knows he has to stop avoiding them. Has to stop running away. But how?
Draco says he’ll pitch camp and then take a shower after and sends Harry off to look for food. Harry wonders if showering with an
Draco’s body lays on the ground a few feet away, useless, as Harry stands underneath the tree’s branches, mobile but also entirely useless as well.
“I don’t care about that stuff. It doesn't matter.”
“But its cries…they’re so realistic, so painful.”
Hermione’s hand is on his arm and Ron’s got this look in his eyes like he can hear Harry’s plans to run the fuck away, back to Muggle London where he should’ve stayed in the first place. He could do it.
Draco takes a cautious look at his mother, feeling uncomfortably anxious himself, and nods. Turns on his heel and scampers off towards Patches’ room.
“How ridiculous!” Harry can’t stop, won’t stop. “People are so weird.”
He winds his hand down and grasps Harry’s dick in his hand firmly, mouthing down his neck and chest as he strokes him softly, slowly. Barely there at all. Teasing bastard.
“Also, a bezoar is good in a pinch, but the knowledge to avoid the poison altogether is better. So be sure to study. Practice your spell casting. Get a good night’s rest and eat a full meal.”
“Potter?” Harry nods his head, practically weeping. “Now I’m just Potter? After we slept in the same bed for months? After I held you and you held me while nightmares tore at us every night? After all the
“I only recognize one of those things. Who’s Britney Smears?”
is perfect.
After a while, he finds an apple tree. Divine. He gathers some of them in his arms, surprised at their ripeness and the diversity of colour despite the time of year, and heads back to camp. Draco’s sitting on a tree stump beside a glowing fire with his robes draped over his shoulders.
appearance. He’d vanished from the Burrow sometime after the war and had been missing, presumed dead, for many months. Then, one day, Hermione says he showed up at the foot of her bed, purring his little heart out as he burrowed into her scarf and batted at the tassels.
“What if we can’t brew the potion ourselves?” Asks Michael Corner, Ron’s partner.
Patches grabs Harry’s hand and leads them through the house.
“Almost forgot about the cloak,” he says as he flies down to the ground.
“Harry, what’s wrong? What’s happened?” She sounds afraid. “Are you okay?”
Harry’s brow furrows; he shrugs his shoulders. “The ones who were picking on you? They’ll say nothing and if they do, who cares? Fuck them. Their opinions don’t matter...and neither does their hatred.”
“How...How did you do it before?”
What feels like moments later, he wakes. Draco’s calling his name softly, almost singing it. It’s a nice thing to wake up to, so Harry smiles, rolls over to look at him. The sun has risen a bit, but the forest is still almost entirely dark. Perhaps with the thick vegetation and trees, it will always be this dark, this damp.
Draco nods and Narcissa changes songs again, to a more upbeat rhythm with words about a bright nosed deer and foggy nights.
Draco sighs for a long, hard moment, grits his teeth and seems to relent. Finally.
The guest room is the most beautiful room Harry has ever slept in. It’s decorated lavishly and expensively and is somehow also functional.
“Then take it back.”
“You were in mine, too. Doing bastardly things, usually. Up to no good.” Harry tries to laugh, because it is funny, sort of, but it falls flat.
“You’re alive?” He asks instead of answering.
“Draco!” Harry whispers into the forest, hoping he’s near enough to hear. “Draco!”
A destroyed 19-year old boy, worn down by the demons of his past, only skin and bones. Harry must look the same, because he is the same. At least inside.
“I gave my life to that war,” Harry says strongly, “and I asked for nothing in return. I did it all without pausing, without a second thought, and I’d do it again, but Draco wasn’t given that choice, not until now, and he’s decided that he’s with us. Anything you do to him, you do to me. He’s under my protection now.”
Draco’s mother interrupts him as she comes rushing into the room to smile at Harry.
“Harry,” Draco whispers when Harry kisses down the curve of his throat to his collarbones.
petrified, let alone now, and gathers the fruit and the surviving supplies in his backpack. Thankfully it has survived the attack and, with it, their potions and ingredients.
It’s true. Harry’s fame and legacy means shit-all to him. He’s never cared much for what others thought of him or what they said about him, unless it was Draco doing the talking and thinking and it’s been that way since they were 11.
The tree is towering and beautiful and the fruit glisten on the branches in the late afternoon sun. It would be an incredible sight if the tree wasn’t screaming at the top of her lungs.
Look at his arm; you know what’s there.”
Harry wants to die. He’d throw up if he had anything to puke up but coffee and smoke.
“This is my cross,
Of course Malfoy returned home.
Thankfully, after the dementor’s Kiss, Narcissa sold the old Malfoy manor and now they live in a smaller, equally as grandiose castle rather close to Hogsmeade, making Apparating easier. There are no awful, traumatic memories melted into the floorboards here. There is no blood, no death, no tears. There is no Voldemort. Not here.
“Sorry about before.”
He lugs his trunk up and onto the train as Ginny asks Ron about what he’s heard of the new 8th year changes.
Why should Voldemort get to determine where Harry feels at home? The answer is he shouldn’t. Voldemort is dead and gone, and despite all odds, Harry is still here. He’s still alive.
“Voldemort, then.” She is noticeably tense and Neville’s cheeks are pink in leftover fear of a dead man; Luna is too busy reading a small, baby-pink book and doesn’t even look up.
“You good?” He asks as the adrenaline starts to wear off.
Harry wishes he could be happy for him, but he’s selfish enough to know he can’t. Draco left Harry alone here for no reason other than his own vanity. His stupid Pureblood background seems to follow him no matter how hard he tries to avoid it.
without me, and
“What are you thinking about?” Draco asks.
“Yeah, well Hermione’s got us on this regimen for the forest test that caused this.”
“Lovely,” Luna says genuinely, heading for the nook by a tall, clear window. “Perfect spot for
“My wand? You...kept it?”
Ron nods, smiles, and disappears around the corner. Harry heads down the opposite hall to the bathroom where he takes a piss and brushes his teeth. He stares at the sharpness of all the bones in his face, almost unrecognizable besides the twisted scar, with distrust in the mirror as he brushes.
“Yes, you can.”
Harry slips a little further from sanity after that. He goes back to his room and lays in his bed. He doesn’t move for almost a whole day. Doesn’t sleep. Doesn’t think. Just stares at the ceiling and forgets he’s a being because he’s so overloaded. So dead inside.
Harry opened his eyes. “Does he now?” The fire doesn’t seem so bright anymore.
“You naive little boy.” Nixon studied him for a while, but stamped over Harry’s venture to  vehemently defend himself. “Blood means everything in this world. Your muggleborn friend has filled your head with equity rot, and now you’ve both concluded that all wizards jump the same height.”
She stops shuffling to glower. “This is different.”
Harry shakes his head, dead-set on taking rejecting it but Kingsley pushes it into his grasp. He stares at it, and it feels warm in his hands. “And the Unification Committee allowed this?”
To add more insult to her words, black smoke begins leaking from the closed kitchen floor.
Under no circumstances can I be ‘alright’, Harry, because I’m not fucking alright.” Her hands are running through her hair, rubbing at her puffy face and runny eyes.
Even with their eyes on him, he couldn’t do anything but sit quiet and alone.
Her input became twice as needed, even if she’d promised that she was alright with not receiving Harry’s exemption. After hearing Nixon blabber, he wouldn’t be doing it again regardless of how Hermione and Ron said she’d feel.
“I think we should play Truth or Dare,” Neville blurted out, scooting forward on the floor in an eager manner to explain. “It’s a Muggle game where—!”
There was chaos around him, but Harry found himself staring at the nose of the bottle in disbelief. It had to be an act of magic, he knew that. But who? He took a chance to glance up at Malfoy, only to find himself being stared at already.
“A godson, aye?” His hands snatch a medium sized stuffie from his own cart. “Give ‘em this.” He holds out a stuffed dragon—it’s purple, a pattern of green and yellow sitting beneath its underbelly.
“You guys couldn’t have gotten more creative with these questions?” Blaise commented.
“I’m certain you can manage even the tiniest bit of rationality, Weasley.” Malfoy’s tone draws the attention of most of the occupants in the room—Harry included. “I mean, you must be good for something if not this, right?”

Harry hadn’t done it yet.

Harry breaks. He was tired of Parkinson’s games and her smile and just fucking
She drops her purse on the countertop, “The new law is legal—almost too legal. We’ll have to make a loophole ourselves then.” She hesitates in pulling out her books, looking up at him from her eyelashes. “Ron and I…”
“Merlin, Weasley, Potter’s a big boy now. He can make his own decisions,” snarks Malfoy, whose eyes are bright, whose lips are curled. Harry wants to simultaneously bite him and kiss—maybe both.
It was wrong, and I knew it was wrong the day after you’d left.”
And he would have moved along, really, he would have. Gone to the floo and ate a few bites of the delicious meal he knew Kreacher had cooked up.
“Yeah, Ron, we’re alright.”
Bartholomew Trulock huffed, pointing his wand in threat at Harry who made no move to be seated. Kingsley’s stare made his face hot in embarrassment—he swore he would scrape up an apology after this—and his stomach squirmed, but he settled down in his designated seat without question.
“No need for the formality, Potter,” Ackern lifted up his shopping cart full of toys, nappies, and baby wipes. “You’ve got a good eye. Mind helping me out? My boy hates everything I buy.”
“Maybe.. they had a disagreement before this,” Dean supplies, as he and Hermione share a second to stare at them. Ron grumbles when she nudges him, albeit slow and quiet before shrugging and fingering his denims that she bought him.
“The dared don’t have a say so,” Padma comments, with a casual shrug. There were other murmurs of agreements and Parkinson pursed her lips even harder. “Which means this doesn’t seem like a bad idea.”
He’s still dead to the world by the time he receives a letter from Kingsley. He reads it the next afternoon, half-coherent in his sleep deprived and fatigued gaze.
Parkinson is the picture of innocence when she pats Malfoy’s shoulder and looks Harry right in his eye. “You’ll have to find out yourself, Blaise. Draco’s a little shy.”
“The noble purebloods are so true to their bloodline that breeding methods such as this are normalized in the community.” He waved his hand and the papers vanished.
Maybe he could keep coming.

He recoils, spluttering to her turning back. “I did
They closed in on him, creating a darkened tunnel vision with no way to escape other than the solid door pressed into his back.
After giving Ginny the ticket, she left without any delayal to get it registered. She was photographed coming from the Union with her accepted registration clutched to her chest in joy.
One: There was no one to be seen.
They pause, staring at each other just as they begin exploding into booming laughter, the nerves strung tight in his neck watering down in remission. Harry’s still chuckling when Ron gives him a grin. “Alright, then?”
Hermione shakes her head, sighing. “Alright, you two, it’s time to stop—!”
They were his flowers. It was
A bloated, middle-aged man dressed in plum robes remained standing while the others sat. “The voting will now commence.” He sits back down, and another plum robed woman rises.
Yet he can’t be the judge of cleanliness when his judgement could be clouded by darkening of the late afternoon sky.
Harry bites down the urge to repeat his last statement, because if she knew that then why had she left him alone? Where were they those quiet days after the trial when Ginny couldn’t make it over? “Alright,” he says instead. “Why now?”
Malfoy lets Harry's glasses fall into his lap with a flop, and he swears he might kill him one of these days. “Don’t be so perverted, Potter.” There’s a sigh of relief beside him when Malfoy whirls around back to his seat.
Harry sighed. “I won’t answer that, Nixon.”
There was a soft thud; Ron’s head was laying on the dull red cushions of the sofa behind him. “Anything else you wanna tell us? Something else you would never tell us under different circumstances?”
“Shit,” he cursed, settling into what would be a sprint had his legs not been cocooned by the heavy robes Hermione bought him for Ministry events (he was sure Ron would go into cardiac arrest when seeing them be used for an event like this).
His wish was that he could someday recall spending his summer hurting from it instead of writing letters to Ron and Hermione.
Harry is stung by her words, and he sits paralyzed in his seat, shoved around at the sudden uproar that transpires around him. The woman’s voice goes breathy in befuddlement as she attempts to read the final sentence to the crowd.
“I—yeah..” Harry doesn’t add any details, because he didn’t think there would be questions like this. But at this point it’s his own fault for staying. Ron doesn’t say anything more, and neither does Seamus or Dean.
“That’s not a bad plan, Neville,” Hermione interrupts, bouncing out her seat as she stands. “Perhaps we can prepare a box in the middle full of dares of our own, and charm it to scream when it detects lies!”
