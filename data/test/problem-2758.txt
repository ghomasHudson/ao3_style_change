"Veela traits," Fred repeated frowning, "Such as...?"
Draco hid a smirk at Hadrian’s blush, silently vowing to make the brunet blush more often; it made him look innocent-and very attractive. Draco absently noted his new thoughts about his former rival, and quickly decided he was okay with it; Hadrian was attractive, powerful and interesting to talk to-why shouldn't Draco be interested in him? Not to mention, it was highly likely that Hadrian was his mate, so there was no point worrying about it anyway.
"Two hours just to get that horrible stuff out of his system," the blond scowled shaking his head, "I can't believe Dumbledore would do this to a student-especially Potter! I always thought Potter was his precious Golden Boy…why would he do this?"
Harry sat on his bed in the Gryffindor dorm, staring numbly at the letter in his hand. He had always known something like this might one day happen, but he’d never thought it would happen like this, via a cold, impersonal letter delivered to him just before the start of the Christmas holidays. Harry was only lucky that he had been alone when the letter was delivered; the rest of his dorm was at supper, but Harry had skipped because he wasn't feeling hungry and he still had to finish packing so that he could spend Christmas with the Weasley’s. The idea popped into his head that maybe it was a joke from the twins, so Harry lifted the letter and re-read it:
"There you are, boys," Lucius greeted them, "We have some important information to discuss with you. Do you recall in the memories when Dumbledore forced Tom to create Horcruxes?" Harry and Draco both nodded. "Well, there was a final Horcrux created that no one that night-aside from possibly Dumbledore-was aware of."
“So, Muggleborn then? Welcome to the Wizarding World,” he smiled.
I hate how after everything, I can’t get him out of my head.
Draco was awaken by his annoying 18 year old cousin shaking his shoulder roughly.
Madam Malkin’s immediately spotted him and when she reached him, she asked, “Hogwarts too, dear?”
“That’s not what I asked.”
It’s a bit ironic, how this is the place they chose to take solitude in when it had one of their most horrible memories stored into it forever.
He leans his head back, looking at the sky. The stars are shining ahead, different colours and sizes glowing. The sight is beautiful at midnight.
He chatted with Tom all night, and while he knows Tom is a memory that is 16 years old — because Tom showed him some of his own memories at Hogwarts which is wicked and actually told him about it — Tom still indulged him, like he, too, was just starting Hogwarts with him. He was Draco’s best friend, after all. What are friends for? Draco wonders if Tom’s bitter at being trapped in a book as a memory, but Tom reassured him that it’s
Draco glanced sideways at him, then gathered his courage to speak to this boy. It’s his first chance at making a friend, and the boy doesn’t look hostile or anything.
They both glanced at each other at the same time now, and it felt as if a spell has been broken. He doesn’t know how to explain it, he just knows that this is it. What he’s been waiting for.
He pouted more at the reminded of not being able to see Dora even in the holidays because of her Auror training, but smiled softly as he recalled her words.
Her brown hair — which is her normal hair colour — changed to bright pink as she laughed at his failed attempt to smack her with his pillow, and he could still hear her laughter after she left his room — not without tripping on her feet — and
Oh. Does he? No. Not really.
I must’ve been staring too intensely, for he looked up too and flashed me a small, but perfect smile.
Harry glanced at Malfoy, who’s back is leaning against the Astronomy Tower’s railings to his right; hugging his knees to his chest, his chin resting on top of them. His grey eyes, shaded silver by the moonlight, are staring right back at him, impassive.
“Get up, you twat. Mum and I are going with you to Diagon Alley today to buy Hogwarts supplies, remember? You were so excited about it last night,” she huffs, and he knows without looking that she has her hands on her hips.
Because whenever I look at him I feel everything in me melt into puddles and puddles of affection. Whenever his hair is windswept and his cheeks are flushed because of Quidditch practice, my heart skips a beat. Whenever he kisses me, I feel butterflies in my stomach and I can’t help but grin after we break off for breath.
"Very well," Dumbledore nodded, "Stay with the boys as much as possible, and report to me when you can. Since Mr. Malfoy agreed to protect Harry, perhaps we can use that to turn him to our side; try to convince him to join us, but do not alienate him. Go now, and keep me informed."
“It has to all be done within 48 hours,” Severus cautioned, “Once he takes the draught we have 48 hours to give him the antidote or he will never awaken, so it must all be planned very carefully.”
“Which is probably starting to wear off right about now,” Harry said, and Draco nodded, his eyes already feeling heavy, “Go to sleep, love,” Harry said, “I’ll make sure you wake up enough to tell Teddy bye in the morning.”
"O-okay," Harry agreed quietly, "You never did say who was in here with us."
"Oh?" Dumbledore arched his eyebrow, affecting polite interest, "And how would you improve these conditions?"
Harry listened intently to the shouts that sounded in the woods, holding his breath when footsteps ran right past his hiding spot. After several minutes, the voices faded and Harry was able to relax in the knowledge that he was safe, and alone. Exhausted from being up all night and running from Dudley’s gang, Harry decided to take a nap, hoping that the rest would also make his injuries stop hurting so badly. Having used this as a hiding place in the past, Harry had stocked it with some blankets and bottled water; he quickly drank half a bottle of water, then wrapped a blanket around himself and curled up facing the small path leading out of the hollow. Within moments, Harry was fast asleep.
Harry frowned, noticing his that his hands were trembling, and he was glad that he wasn’t facing the blond. If Draco found out how upset Harry was at the thought of this ending, the blond would probably get mad and leave; Draco had made it clear when this started two years ago that it wouldn’t be permanent-he still had a duty to provide an heir for his family, and he would have to get married to fulfill that duty. At the time it hadn’t seemed like a problem, since Harry didn’t see them lasting even a month, but, somewhere along the way, he had begun to fall for his former rival. He never deluded himself, however; he might let himself dream of a future with Draco, but he always made sure to remind himself that it was just a dream-someday soon Draco would get married, and Harry would have to find a way to move on.
Thirty minutes later, Hadrian sat up in his bed and glared at the room around him. He had been exhausted by the time he climbed into bed, but now he couldn’t fall asleep. How could he have gotten so dependent on sleeping with Draco already? Hadrian never shared a bed with anyone before-except the few times he fell asleep talking to Neville in the boys dorm-so he should be comfortable sleeping in this room-his room. The first room that was ever really his, which he had been able to decorate.
“You don’t want this,” she said, “And not only because you’re interested in men.” She contemplated him in silence for a minute, then her eyes widened slightly, before narrowing. “Who is he?”
"We can have that finished tomorrow; we already have all the ingredients translated," Draco said, then sighed, "However, the potion takes six weeks to brew, and it has to be timed so that it is finished brewing on the night of a full moon."
“How did you-” Harry shake his head, “Never mind. Yes, I like him, I just don’t know what to do about it. I don’t want to mess up our friendship, and he never looks at me…that way.”
"I wonder what Severus will tell him," Narcissa mused, "He'll have to let him know that Hadrian is here, otherwise Dumbledore will never trust him when he eventually finds out, but he has to make up something to explain why he can't make Hadrian leave…"
You sat in that chair
Making up for all the time they had missed
“Where are you going?” Hadrian demanded, “I just told you that I want to talk to my friends, didn't I? You can't abandon me now.” He linked arms with the blond, pretending not to see the shocked expression on Draco's face, or the way that expression slowly became a self-satisfied smirk, and they entered the room together. They saw that their guests had already arrived; Neville was standing nervously by the fireplace while Luna was examining something on the bookcase.
"That was strange," Harry said frowning, "I never knew that my mom had a cousin in America-and she was a witch! Everyone always said Mum was a Muggleborn and didn’t know about magic until she met Snape. Why didn't Dumbledore ever tell me? Hell, why didn't he let me stay with her? She obviously liked my Mum!"
"Ah yes; I overheard the two Black sisters talking about a dark creature that you can control-that will be perfect." He calmly pointed his wand at Tom and said, "Imperio!" Once the boy was under the spells control Dumbledore gave his orders, "You will release the creature you have found and order it to attack-but not kill-Muggleborn students. After ten students have been attacked, you will command your pet to kill…oh, let's say Myrtle, that girl who is always crying. Yes, once Myrtle is dead, you will make sure that Rubeus Hagrid catches you, and you will not harm him. You will speak of this to no one. You may go now." The memory faded once again, and the next one showed Dumbledore talking to a young Hagrid.
"If you think of anything else, do not hesitate to ask," Narcissa said, "Now, Draco, would you like to play a game of Chess with me?" Draco agreed, and they moved from the table over to the other side of the parlor, where a Chess table was set up. Hadrian sat next to Draco, intent on learning how to play better-Ron was an excellent player, but a terrible teacher-while Lucius and Severus sat in a pair of chairs nearby, discussing something in quiet voices.
////////////////////////
Hadrian shook the image from his head and climbed out of the shower; he wasn't gay! He was just…stressed and…well, he didn't know exactly, but he did know he wasn't gay. He comforted himself with this thought as he dried off and got dressed in the black slacks and red button up shirt Draco loaned him. When he went back into the bedroom all thoughts left him as he saw Draco sitting on the window seat-shirtless and bathed in sunlight. He gulped as his eyes trailed over the Slytherins quidditch-toned upper body, blushing furiously when said blonde turned towards him with a smirk.
Draco had always done everything possible too get the attention he craved
He knew; all along the headmaster knew exactly what was going on and not only did he not stop them, but he encouraged it! Harry lowered his head and closed his eyes, fighting back the burning tears and disappointment in himself; there was obviously something very wrong with him if even Dumbledore felt that he deserved the treatment he received at his relative's hands. Really, it was bad enough when Ron and Hermione told him that he was making too big of a deal about the way the Dursley's treated him; he could still hear Hermione's exasperated words on the ride home this year: "Oh, stop it Harry! I'm sure it can't be that bad; your aunt and uncle are just doing what that have to in order to make sure you grow up right! They care about you, and are only trying to build character!" And then there was Ron's agreement, "Yeah, come off it Mate! You don't like your relative's; we get it! Grow up already! Some of us have more important things to worry about!" Maybe they were right, and Harry had been making a big deal out of nothing...he was drawn out of his thoughts as Petunia spoke again.
When Harry finished changing into the new outfit, he was happy with what he saw. His new outfit consisted of an outfit similar to what Draco had been wearing. Harry had on black hose with an emerald green sleeveless tunic that fit him like a second skin; he had on black dragonhide boots instead of the pointed elf shoes, and a black dragon leather belt with a gold buckle. He also had emerald green robes that were an exact match for Draco’s, but the embroidery on Harrys’ robes was gold.
"Not yet," Draco replied, "Although Hadrian is at least slightly happier with the new collar you made for him."
"Of course, darling," Narcissa agreed, "I have my mirror with me. We're ready, Dobby." Narcissa and Draco each grabbed one of Dobby's hands and the house elf apparated them away as Lucius left the room in search of Tom.
"That was rude," Draco narrowed his eyes at the brunet, "Very rude, and also uncalled for." He paused thoughtfully for a moment before smirking, "Remember that collar you're wearing? If I give you an order you have to obey it, or the collar will cause you varying degrees of discomfort or pain, depending on the order. Do you want me to have to command you to put the robe on?"
“They aren’t silly if they make you happy,” Draco returned, then smirked into Harry’s thick locks, “Of course, I’d never turn down a special gift from you. You wouldn’t want to give me a hint about what it is, would you?”
The boys quickly dressed for dinner in a pair of casual robes and then headed downstairs, only to be notified by a house elf that they would be dining alone; Severus was with Dumbledore, Lucius was meeting with Tom again, and Narcissa was having dinner with some other Death Eater wives in order to keep up appearances. It was odd to Hadrian, sitting at the dining room table with just himself and Draco, but he just shrugged and sat next to his boyfriend. They ate supper at a leisurely rate, and then went back upstairs where they began looking through the books Tom had given Hadrian. Arden-who had been exploring the manor on his own that day-reappeared when they sat down in the sitting room and immediately climbed on the back of the couch to wrap himself around Draco’s shoulders.
*****************************
"Dancing?" Hadrian groaned, "I hate dancing! I'm absolute rubbish at it."
"Like I would believe that," Draco scoffed, but he released his hair anyway and helped Harry maneuver into a sitting position; once Harry was propped up against the pillows Draco reached over to grab his glasses off the bedside table, placing them carefully on the other boys face. Relieved at being able to see again Harry let his gaze wander the room; there was Snape on the other side of the bed organizing some potions vials and sitting at the table, calmly eating a piece of fruit, was-
“I-no,” Harry shook his head, “The bet’s off. I mean, Draco can’t possibly think that it’s still on! Not after he just dumped me!”
“It wasn’t a date,” Harry rolled his eyes, “Draco and I just…hang out sometimes. Besides, he had to leave early-and I just found out the real reason why.”
“Yes,” Draco said, choosing to sit next to Harry instead of in his usual chair, “I meant every word of it. I find you attractive, and I believe we could have a strong relationship. We tend to bring out the worst in each other in many situations, but I also believe that you can bring out the best in me. I meant what I said about giving you time though; you don’t have to make a decision today.”
Hadrian walked through the woods until he came to a large tree that had branches reaching to the ground; he easily slipped through the branches and sat down at the base of the tree. The branches would hide him from sight, so this should be a good, safe place to spend the night. He pulled out his wand, then halted; he had almost forgotten about the restriction on underaged magic! The Ministry would have been down on him in seconds if he had cast a spell! Shaking his head at his own foolishness, Hadrian became aware of something around his neck.
“I know,” Draco replied, reaching up to cup his cheek with one hand, “I’m glad you stopped me, because I want our first time together to be about us; not anyone else. I’m sorry for overreacting.”
"There you are Severus," the Dark Lord said, "I have been looking for you."
"It's not out of guilt," Hadrian protested, "and I definitely don't pity you! I just-I don't know what to think Dray; everything has changed so much in the past two days..." Draco didn't respond, so Hadrian decided to try another tactic, "What happened to your Slytherin cunning? I admit that I don't feel ready for a...relationship and that I wouldn't even be thinking about it if it weren't for the fact that you're a Veela-I don't want to lose my best friend after all-" Hadrian saw a small smirk on Draco's lips before the blond replaced it with a scowl, but he took this as encouragement and continued; "but shouldn't you be using it to get what you want? I seem to remember the Sorting Hat in first year saying that Slytherin's were "cunning folk" who "used any means to achieve their ends". It's not like you to give up so easily."
“Very well,” she bowed her head briefly, “Shall we finish our tea while you go over the rest of your plans?” Narcissa happily agreed, inwardly smirking at the look she imagined would be on Lucius’ face when he realized she had accomplished what he thought would be a difficult task, as she filled Augusta in on what she knew of their plans; after tea, she would allow Augusta to meet with James and Lily’s portrait.
“You’re alive!” Draco greeted Harry with a hug, and the brunet fought to keep from collapsing against his friend, “You’re a bloody maniac, but you’re alive, thank Merlin!”
Is more than I ever dreamed I’d have
"I'd be surprised if it was all good news," Ginny laughed, "I'm interested to hear the rest, but knowing that Malfoy is a Veela and you're his mate explains a lot. I know that he won't ever hurt you, and you will never find someone more loyal…although I can see you having some spectacular fights over what is and isn't considered safe for you to do. You guys want to go get some ice cream?"
“Draco will have a lot of business,” Luna said, “I think I’ll buy a box myself.” Luna had chosen the chocolate with the rose petal, and Ginny tried the one with the orange curl. The three finished off the box of chocolate, after offering Mrs. Weasley a piece, which she declined, and then set about straightening the store. Thankfully, magic made the task easy; in ten minutes, all the books had been re-shelved, and the dishes were washing themselves in the back of the store. A chime sounding brought Harry to the front of the store, and he found Draco standing outside. Harry briefly lowered the wards, and the blond entered.
“Alright,” Harry finally agreed, the promise of warmth and food swaying him; the queen had been nice so far, and he wanted to trust her. He climbed into the sleigh, and the Snow Queen tucked the warm furs around him, before providing a tray with silver goblet full of a steaming beverage that smelled like chocolate, and a plate of small sandwiches. The Snow Queen insisted Harry eat before telling his story, and he happily bit into one of the sandwiches, reveling in the warmth and safety the Snow Queen provided.
The room was lit by the soft glow of several floating candles. Two rows of candles made a path from the door to the bed, leaving the rest of the room in darkness. The bed curtains were open and laying on top of the green-and-silver satin comforter, reclining on the matching pillows, was Harry, his lithe figure wrapped in ribbons. Gold ribbons twined around slender ankles and Quidditch-toned calves and thighs, binding them together. More ribbons crisscrossed Harry’s waist and chest, all the way up to his neck, where the ribbons were tied in a bow. Harry’s arms were held in front of him and crossed at the wrists, where the ribbons ended in another bow. Looking at the mass of silk, Draco saw that those ribbons were also connected to the one tied around Harry’s neck. Red lips were parted around a gold ball gag, and emerald eyes smiled at him from beneath a fringe of messy dark hair, which was topped with a red bow.
"That was when the weasel had the upper-hand," Draco replied nonchalantly, "I feel that Harry is entitled to a little revenge before I interfere. Knock his head off!" He encouraged the brunet, smirking as he saw Ron struggling to get away; the red-head was taller and had a wider build than Hadrian, but the smaller boy was somehow holding Ron down-Draco suspected that his magic had leapt up and enabled him to protect himself. When he saw Ron knock Hadrian off of him again, Draco decided it was time to interfere and he immediately pulled Hadrian to his feet and stood in front of him protectively.
"Dobby is being shrinking them and turning them into a charm until Harry Potter is needing them," Dobby offered, "Is Harry Potter wanting to use the collar?" Harry was silent for a moment as he thought about it. He wasn’t sure if he really wanted to transform into his animagus form as he didn't know what it was-what if he turned out to be a helpless bunny or something? -but he couldn’t think any other options, so he sighed and nodded.
"No," Severus shook his head, "Elena didn't betray you-and she isn't dead." He held up the vial with the combined memories and explained the contents, "This vial contains memories of your school years and immediately after leaving Hogwarts, the truth of what happened that night in Godric's Hollow, and Dumbledore's memories from two nights ago, which are important for you to understand what is happening right now, and why Potter wishes to change sides."
"Now that you mention it, I haven't felt as embarrassed when you kissed me and such in front of people today," Hadrian replied, "And I could also feel your magic when you got mad, and after we went back downstairs I noticed that I felt responsible for keeping you from freaking out."
“Yes, Ma’am,” Harry replied, “Betas are the normal Witches and Wizards, right?”
"It doesn't have to be today," Hadrian said quickly, not wanting to seem immature or needy, "I know making changes with the Death Eater's is important, so just whenever he has the time."
"Have you spoken yet with Bellatrix regarding Draco's celebration?"
hexed me," he glared at Hadrian, who had the grace to blush at the memory.
/////////////////////
"That would be acceptable," the Dark Lord nodded, and Draco summoned Tillie; once she had her orders it took only a few moments for her to return with the pensieve, and Severus took it from her, carefully setting it on the bed in front of Harry and Draco.
“Good morning,” Harry greeted him with a smile, “Coffee or tea?”
"No," Hermione shook her head, "Whatever the Dursley's did to you, I'm certain Professor Dumbledore didn't know about it, and he would never knowingly leave you in an abusive home. I think you must have just imagined that conversation because you still blame the headmaster for Sirius' death, even though you were the one who chose to go to the ministry. You have to take responsibility for your own actions, Harry-and I am not calling you by that ridiculous new name-you can't place the blame with other people." A soft growling sound filled the room, and Hermione's eyes widened when she saw that Draco's eyes had gone silver again, and Hadrian was struggling to hold him back from attacking. "And that's another thing!" She continued bravely-or foolishly, depending on how you looked at it; "How can you be friends with someone who spent the last five years tormenting us, and who wants to attack me even now!"
“I’m okay with being bound and blindfolded,” he replied, “But first…I want to get on my knees in front of you.” Draco bit back a groan as his mind readily supplied him with the image of Harry on his knees, sucking him off.
“Thank you, Cousin.” Harry watched with wide eyes as the man disappeared, and he realized the cloak pin must have been a portkey.
"We have to set up ways to communicate," Draco added, "and figure out where we can meet, and how to set up the organization itself; decide who will handle what tasks-and decide exactly what we aim to accomplish. We have some people we want to approach, but it has to wait until we can get them alone long enough to share the memories-and we also have to find a way to guarantee their silence, even if they don't want to join us. Hadrian also needs to meet my friends so that we can decide together who might be trustworthy enough to include in the group." The twins nodded thoughtfully, thinking through what Draco had just said.
“In here,” Draco called, and Harry noticed that the bedroom door wasn’t closed all the way. Draco had never invited Harry into his bedroom before, so he was careful when he pushed the door open. There was an alcove across from the door, with a loveseat facing the floor-to-ceiling windows. Draco was standing in the alcove with his back to the door, looking down at the grounds as the sun slowly rose higher in the sky.
By the time Draco decided to hire on more witches and wizards, the blond had made Harry an equal partner and named Harry the Head Elf, stating that Harry would be in charge whenever Draco was unavailable. It took them three years to get the North Pole operational, and during that time Harry got to see a new side of Draco. Sometime during those three years, Harry had begun to fall for the snarky blond, but he kept his feelings to himself, afraid to ruin their partnership-and their newfound friendship.
As sleep rises up to claim me, I feel a soft kiss to the top of my head, and hear a murmured; “I love you too, Harry.” I can’t help but think that this is the most promising start to the Christmas Holidays ever, and I slip easily into dreams, feeling safe and happy wrapped in the arms of the one I love.
"Look Severus, I-that is to say, we-” James made a gesture to include Remus and Sirius- “are really sorry about what Peter did. I know you and I have never been close friends, but we were friends of a sort and I'd hate for that idiot’s actions to end that. If you'll accept our apology, Siri, Remus and I will help you prank Peter really good. And, I'll allow you to borrow my invisibility cloak one time for twenty-four hours with no questions asked." Severus scowled and looked over at the wall, but Harry could detect an excited gleam in his eyes.
“Wonderful job,” Dumbledore praised, “We will go out over the next few days and similarly mark some other witches and wizards that I have already selected. For now, however, we have other things to take care of. Alastor, I need you and Kingsley to take everyone down to the dungeons, to the rooms we already prepared; you know what to do once you are there. I shall take care of Tom and-Molly, Arthur; why don’t you take Ginny home to meet her brothers?” Dumbledore withdrew several potions vials and handed them to the Weasley patriarch, “Make sure everyone takes their potions so that there is no confusion, and we will meet up again in a few days.”
“You said you withdrew your protection,” Harry accused.
"Oh, sorry Draco," Hadrian mumbled as he tried to pull away, frowning when the other boy wouldn't let him go, "Draco; let me go."
“Er-the basilisk bit me when I stabbed it with the sword,” Harry said hesitantly, “I’m okay though!” He rushed to reassure Narcissa, who paled at that announcement; “Fawkes cried on the bite and healed me!”
"Actually, as your father I do get to have a say in your education," Tom interrupted, "But we can discuss this later. For now, Severus and I should go mingle among the other adults-your peers seem hesitant to approach you while we stand here."
It was near midnight on Christmas Eve, and fifteen-year-old Harry Potter was walking through the Hogsmeade side of the Forbidden Forest, trying to talk himself into following the plan he had come up with earlier. Harry should have been at Grimmauld Place with his friends and Sirius, but Umbridge had arrived in Dumbledore’s office before Harry could step through the Floo. She had reluctantly accepted Dumbledore’s authority in allowing the Weasley children to leave early, but then smugly informed them that Harry was not related to the Weasley’s and could not leave without his guardians’ permission. Dumbledore had cheerfully agreed, promising Harry the use of his Floo once he received permission to leave, and then allowed Umbridge to escort Harry back to Gryffindor Tower.
Harry nodded to himself, and drew his wand to call the Knight Bus, only to pause when he heard the sound of tinkling bells. Harry looked around in confusion, but couldn’t see anything suspicious, even though the bells sounded as if they were getting closer. Suddenly, a silver sled appeared in a nearby clearing, and Harry stared at it in disbelief.
"This is Slytherin's hidden chamber," Tom said smugly, "I discovered it last night, and I wanted to share it with my friends."
“Turning Blaise’s eyes into leaves and the eyebrows into caterpillars was brilliant,” Draco agreed, “Although I suppose it is a good thing that Longbottom reversed the spell before Blaise’s eyebrows could eat his eyes. I’m sure Sev could have brewed a potion to restore them, but Blaise would probably never get over it.”
“I understand,” Astoria interrupted, “As long as you are discrete, I don’t mind if you have a lover on the side, as long as you extend the same courtesy to me. In addition, neither of us will seek outside companionship until after our child is born.”
Draco paused and then smiled at Harry.
"Why, Hadrian," Fred smirked, "Is that your way of hinting that you want Draco to propose to you?"
"Gee, don't spare my feelings or anything," Draco drawled, glaring at Hadrian; he dropped the gel though and instead pulled it back and tied it with a dark blue ribbon.
“I-I won’t, sir,” Harry stammered, intimidated by this powerful wizard, “I’ll be quiet, and help cook and do chores. I’ll do anything you tell me to do.” Lucius frowned at that, before locking eyes with his wife. An arched eyebrow, a shake of the head, blue eyes widening, a nod, and the silent conversation was over.
"Salazar Slytherin himself," Lucius replied, "It seems that Tom is his descendant, as is Hadrian, of course; that is one of the subjects Severus is discussing with our lord. Griphook indicated that the books may have counter spells to reverse the effects of long-term suffering under the Cruciatus Curse."
"I is checking on Harry Potter," Dobby replied, "Dobby is too late! Draco Malfoy is attacking Harry Potter! Draco Malfoy is a bad wizard!"
"Draco's parents and Severus will do that," Hadrian shrugged, "We're telling our friends. Just remember not to tell anyone else about this stuff, not even Ron."
“Thank you, Pansy,” Draco smiled up at his friend, then sighed and dropped the parchment on his desk, “He probably won’t even show.”
“Because he's been flirting with me all day,” Hadrian blurted without thinking, and Neville’s eyes widened.
"Hurry up Hades," Draco called through the door, "Tillie already came up to tell us it was time for Tea, so let's go." Hadrian pushed the door open and noted with relief-and slight disappointment-that Draco was already dressed.
“You don’t have to wait around,” Harry rolled his eyes at his husband, “Go have dinner with Blaise and Pansy, and tell them I’ll be there next time.” It was a week after the wedding, and the two were alone in a small honeymoon cottage that had been a gift from Sirius. They had just received a dinner invitation from Pansy and Blaise, and Harry felt that Draco should go even if he, Harry, had to stay home just in case his heat started.
"Of course," Narcissa smiled, "I will have a house elf bring a few upstairs for you; in the meantime, we have covered the most important aspects of Draco's Inheritance, so you boys can go flying now if you like; a house elf will summon you for tea."
“We intend to give people back their memories,” Narcissa informed her, “We are going to move slowly though, and choose carefully who to reveal the truth to first; we don’t want anyone learning the truth and then inadvertently alerting Dumbledore. As we do this, we plan to slowly undermine his authority.”
“I think it might help,” Harry mused, “I mean, you’ve given me enough proof and I believe you are Santa Clause, but I still can’t picture it.”
"So, you were going to explain what's going on?" Ginny prompted, and Hadrian nodded.
** ** ** ** ** **
“Very well,” Draco smiled- a genuine smile, not a smirk- at everyone, “Then it’s time for me to be off.”
"In your dreams," Hadrian replied, "I will get to the snitch first, you'll see!"
"You'll be fine honey," Elena smiled softly at him, "And we'll have Sirius and Bella to help us."
“Yes sir, Harry Potter sir,” Dobby agreed, accepting the handful of letters, “Dobby is making sure all of the letters is being delivered. Is Harry Potter ready?” Harry took a deep breath, then nodded.
Harry had been quick to turn his attention to Pomfrey, but she was no stranger to Harry’s moodiness and simply cast a sleeping spell so that she could perform her diagnostics in peace. Harry had awoken later that evening, and Pomfrey advised him that he appeared to be healthy, but that he would need to remain in the hospital wing until Dumbledore returned to speak to him. All of his questions were also brushed aside, the mediwitch telling him, once again, to wait for Dumbledore. Harry waited all night, but the headmaster never returned. It was now noon of the following day, and Madame Pomfrey was still the only person he had seen. Needless to say, Harry was starting to get aggravated, and was at the point of rebellion when Dumbledore finally appeared.
“Kiss me,” Draco demands, and Harry turns his head so that Draco can capture his mouth in another fierce kiss. Draco bites down on Harry’s bottom lip at the same time as he feels a pressure inside his urethra, and he whimpers as Draco uses magic to create a sound that will prevent him from finding release.
"Oh Merlin; stop!" Hadrian begged, laughing so hard tears were leaking form his eyes, "Those are so horrible Draco; do wizards really use those?" He clutched at Draco's arm, leaning against the blond for balance until he got his breath back.
Harry gasped at the slight pain, tangling one hand in soft blond locks to keep Draco in place, and scratching the back of his lover’s neck with the other hand. He was somewhat amused when Draco arched into the touch and purred, but the press of Draco’s hard cock against his own turned the laugh into a moan as both hands flew down to clutch at Draco’s hips.
"I can't believe the Gryffindor Golden Boy is actually consorting with Slytherins and Dark Wizards-"
"Partly," Narcissa said, "However, the main reason they would have forbidden the match was because Andromeda, as the eldest child, had already been betrothed to Lucius. The eldest child is the one who will inherit the majority of the estate, and so Andromeda was expected to marry into a family that would add to our prestige, and have a husband who would be able to assist her with managing the estate. Edward Tonks fit none of those requirements.
"I'm glad to help," Draco smiled, "And seeing you blush is just a bonus." He laughed at Hadrian's glare and gave him a gentle shove towards the bathroom; "Now, go take your shower and then you need to rest as Severus directed." Hadrian rolled his eyes but entered the bathroom none-the-less and got under the shower.
When the vision cleared, Harry got to his feet filled with determination; Voldemort had Sirius, but Harry would not let the madman kill his godfather. Harry ran back to his dorm and grabbed his invisibility cloak, made sure his wand was secured in its holster, and then made his way out of the school. Harry thought longingly of his broom, still locked in Umbridge’s office, and glared at the scar on the back of his hand; that bitch would pay, but later. Harry stopped at the lakes edge as he thought about his options. How was he to get to London? He remembered Sirius talking about the Knight Bus once, maybe he should try that. It was too bad Hagrid didn’t have the hippogriffs around anymore; Buckbeak would probably get him to London.
"Lucius, Severus and Tom are planning most of it," Narcissa began, "However I will be glad to tell you what I know and get your input. When Lucius and Severus return this evening, you can speak to them as well." Narcissa settled more comfortably in her seat and prepared to bring her friends up to date on current events, glad that she was able to speak to them again, even if they were technically just memories.
"Harry came to us as a result of his relative's abuse, and we promised him sanctuary, therefore he shall be returning home with us where I can assure you he will receive the best medical care," Narcissa informed the headmaster, "Now, as for punishing the boys when school is back in session, you do not have the authority to punish students for events that occur during the summer holidays and-as I have assumed my husband's seat on the school board-I will make sure that they do not receive unjust punishment."
"It's a boy," Molly said cheerfully, severing the umbilical cord and handing the baby to Sirius, who accepted with a broad grin on his face, "Oh, and here comes the next one!" Several minutes later there was another cry, and Molly announced, "A girl! So beautiful!" The new baby was handed over to Regulus once she was cleaned off, and the two godfather's brought the babies over to their parents; an exhausted Elena held the girl, while Tom held their son.
"Hadrian," Tom breathed, and Harry looked up to see that the man’s red eyes were suspiciously shiny, "Or do you still wish to go by Harry?"
Draco gave an aggrieved sigh, closing his eyes and asking any entity listening why he was the one who had to deal with Frost’s temper tantrums.
"And we all know how little patience you have to begin with," he teased the blond, earning a playful growl from his Veela.
Hadrian smiled at the Veela as he knelt down in front of his trunk; after their conversation earlier he became curious to see what was actually in there, and decided to go through it before going to bed.
“Hey, Harry?”
"Another item on our already-long list of things to do," Severus sighed, "The place he is being held is well secured, and no doubt covered in monitoring charms. Even getting the mutt back, we would still have to clear his name in order for Hadrian to be given over to his custody; perhaps Tom would be willing to turn Pettigrew over to the ministry now that we know he helped create this entire mess."
“Right, death to the creator of boot camp,” Harry laughed, hugging Ginny as they prepared to Apparate, “Thanks for all the help, Gin.”
"Then go back to sleep," Draco commanded, "I need my beauty rest, and so do you."
"Not yet," Draco corrected, "I am in the process of convincing Hadrian that he wants me. It was starting to work too, until you decided to interrupt us." He glared at the twins again, as he recalled his earlier frustration.
"It’s nice to meet you, Elena," Tom replied, "Is your family still in America?"
"What are you planning?" Lucius demanded, "You leave our children out of this; they are innocent!"
Harry slowly sat back down, his thoughts in a jumble. He wanted so badly to believe Draco, but what if the blond hadn’t meant it? Then again, what if he did mean it? Could Harry just walk away from what Draco was offering if there was the slightest chance that he was being truthful?
“Yeah,” he replied, setting the book down and stretching, “I don’t think I could read another word tonight.”
"I accept the name," Draco said solemnly, "Thank you, Lycan."
Harry was rudely drawn out of his thoughts when, for no apparent reason, the dildo starting pushing further into him, causing him to cry out at the sudden pain.
“You always intended to get married and have an heir,” Harry interrupted, proud of himself for keeping his voice even, “I always knew that what we had would end, I just thought…” He trailed off and then shook his head, “It doesn’t matter. It’s better this way; it would be wrong for us to keep-it wouldn’t be fair to Astoria. I understand, and thank you for being honest with me.”
“I’m not vanishing the corset,” Draco replied, “You’ll just have to take it off yourself.” He rolled to the side and cast a cleaning charm on both of them. Harry sat up, and Draco reached over to undo the laces on the corset; once Harry managed to get out of the garment, the lover’s found themselves lying in each other’s arms once again.
"Not at the moment," Voldemort replied, "So he really has abandoned the light...I had thought that perhaps it was some sort of ploy, but now that I know it isn't...I need to find him. I want to get Harry Potter here, and under my power; once I have him at my mercy then he can be punished for all the trouble he has caused me-and then I will consider allowing him to join us. Now, Severus, I have a feather from his owl and I need one of your locator potions."
***********
"No need," Narcissa interrupted gently, "Tom sent over some money early this morning to pay for anything you might need; you don't have to worry about money yourself any longer now that you have him. Now, let's go to Gringotts and then you boys can be off."
Harry turned down Mystic Alley and nodded a greeting to the other shop owners already out and about; only about five of the twenty shops were currently open, although most of the rest were scheduled to open over the weekend. As Harry neared his shop, which was about halfway down the alley, he noticed movement at the Dueling Dragons; he picked up his pace, hoping that he could catch the owner before they entered the store, and was just in time to see a dark-haired witch opening the door.
"I guess Fred helped you separate the memories too?" Hadrian asked once the memories started playing on the screen; he had erected a privacy spell around Theo and Blaise so that no one outside of the room would hear the memories.
"Please My Lord; I meant no disrespect," she simpered, "I was simply trying to assist you; you have said many times that you wanted the Potter boy out of the way-"
“Please!” I gasp, pulling on the hair in my hands, “Let me-I need it!” I cry out in dismay as the fingers inside me still, and the delicious heat is removed from my cock.
Harry sighed in frustration as he read the letter; what should he do? Draco said The Ritual would work, but Dumbledore said it wouldn’t. Normally Harry would go by whatever the headmaster said, but he couldn’t help remembering all of Dumbledore’s protests were against Harry tying himself to someone else; he had a feeling that Dumbledore only told him about the Horcrux because it was the only way to guarantee Harry would not complete The Ritual. He needed an objective third party, but who could he trust? Almost everyone he knew would tell him not to do the ritual, but all of those people cared about him more than they cared about Draco. In fact, the only person in the school that really seemed to care about Draco was-
"There is one other thing I needed to tell you," Severus said, "Just before Fawkes found me, Lucius returned to the manor; it seems the Dark Lord has freed some of his followers, although Lucius was not sure who exactly had been freed as he was sent home immediately. I did verify that Harry is still safe; even Lucius cannot break the protection spells when Sanctuary is requested and then granted; I have offered to stay at the manor, ostensibly to help Lucius, but in reality I will ensure that Potter comes to no harm."
Just as Harry was working himself into a panic, the chains loosened and he was able to relax his arms. Thank Merlin; he was free! Harry tried to stand up, but he was still stuck to the stool, which had not been set on a time-delay shut off. He would have to endure the full thirty minutes, and he wasn’t sure how much longer he had. How long had he been sitting on the stool?
"Not quite," Griphook replied, producing a bright orange quill, "You will use this phoenix-feather quill to sign your name-your true name-and then I will simply require a drop of blood next to your signature." He passed the book and the quill to Hadrian, who signed his name
"I always knew you'd learn your proper place one day," the blonde smirked, and Harry blushed as he realized he was kneeling at Malfoy's feet. He jerked his head back, feeling Malfoy's fingers reluctantly slip away, and shuffled backwards on his knees until he felt he was a safe enough distance from the blonde; grasping onto the bedpost he pulled himself to his feet, ignoring the sudden flare of pain in his back and sides, as well as the dizziness that threatened to overcome him. Now was not a good time for him to have a relapse, but thankfully the pain quickly subsided and he was able to focus on his immediate problems.
“Because it wasn’t me!” the man yelled, “Look!” The man drew back his sleeve…to reveal clear skin stretched taught over his bones. “If it was me, I would have a Mark! You, of all people, know this Lucius!”
"Thank you Severus," Tom said as he drank the potion, making a face at the after-taste, "It helps that we won't have to worry about this any longer. How much do you have prepared?"
It was two hours later when Narcissa and the boys returned, and the three men were shocked when they saw Hadrian.
"Give it a few minutes before you try to speak," Severus instructed him, "I just want to run an additional diagnostic spell to make sure there are no other injuries." Hadrian rolled his eyes and stuck his tongue out again. "Do that one more time and I will cut out your tongue to use in my potions," Severus threatened, and Hadrian immediately pulled his tongue back in his mouth and proceeded to pout.
The next hour went by fairly quickly; Hadrian and Draco danced a few times and Hadrian was surprised to find out that he was actually decent at it when he let someone else lead. They spoke to Theo and Blaise a bit more-always about innocent subjects, such as the summer homework which Hadrian had yet to start, and they also spoke to a few of the other guests. There had been one incident where an older wizard bumped into Hadrian and Draco started to lose his temper, but the man apologized to Hadrian and Draco, so the Veela let it go, although Hadrian sensed that he was disappointed at not being able to punish the man.
"Well, at least he is safe," Dumbledore sighed, "You did the right thing Severus; do what you can to stay on Mr. Malfoy's good side, and perhaps you can even earn Harry's trust enough to at least convince him to speak to his friends again; if we can get him out of the Manor's wards we can bring him back under our …protection."
"We need to get Hadrian in touch with Gringott’s soon, so that he can block Dumbledore from accessing his funds," Lucius frowned, "Or rather, the Potter funds. Also, I believe Hadrian is currently under the legal custody of his Muggle relatives-distant though they may be; we must find a way to change that as well. Since Hadrian will not be seventeen for another year he will need to have another guardian appointed, since Tom is obviously not an option at the moment.” He paused, then asked, “I trust Hadrian is truly on our side now?"
“I’ve never gotten any gifts from Santa,” Harry replied, “I can’t remember ever believing in him, and no one at school ever spoke about Santa either.”
Finally, after presents and a last snack, Harry and Draco had returned to Grimmauld Place. After instructing Kreacher to leave them alone unless called, Draco had then given Harry a wicked grin and announced that he was claiming his forfeit now. Harry had tried to protest-there was no way that his twelve hours were up-but Draco had been very persuasive, and
“Oh please,” Draco scoffed, “I heard what Dumbledore told you, and there is no way Quirrell would have figured out that mirror on his own. I still want to know why the obstacles were easy enough that two First Years could get through.”
"And who said I'm giving up?" Draco demanded, finally turning to face Hadrian; he held out his hand and Hadrian took it, then gave a little "eep!" of surprise when Draco yanked him, causing him to fall into the blonde's lap, "Maybe I was just using your guilt to get what I want." Draco smirked as the brunet glared at him and tried to get back up, "No; after hurting my feelings I think I need a cuddle to feel better." He helped Hadrian get into a more comfortable position and then wrapped his arms snuggly around the brunet's waist, resting his chin on Hadrian's shoulder.
“Must have been something really good to make them give you me,” Hadrian teased, laughing again as Arden blew a puff of smoke at Draco, causing the blond to glare at the small dragon.
Unfortunately, Harry couldn’t tell anyone about his curiosity, and he definitely couldn’t find anyone to practice on…or, rather, to practice it on him, as all of Harry’s current fantasies involved himself being bound and at the mercy of a handsome, sometimes cruel, master. After a few days of thinking about this, Harry had remembered a spell Flitwick had mentioned in Charms towards the end of last year; it was a charm set to end a spell after a certain amount of time. Flitwick had demonstrated it on a box, which he locked with a spell; by adding the charm to it and specifying a time, he set up the box to be unlocked at a specific point-for his example, it was after fifteen minutes. Flitwick informed the class that the spell was sometimes used as a means to discipline children; the young witch or wizard would be put in time out with a ward around the area, then the charm would be added so that the ward would disappear after the designated time was up. He then explained that the charm could be added to any spell, and their summer assignment was to research a similar charm, which would cause a spell to activate at a certain time.
“Thanks Pansy,” Draco laughed, “I’d hate for you to get in trouble for kidnapping the savior though.” Pansy just smirked and went to let their guests in. A few minutes later, Draco’s office door opened, and Potter entered, looking like he’d rather be anywhere else.
After Arden returned, I packed a few things for you. The package has a shrinking charm, and contains a basket that is connected to our kitchens so that you can be certain of having untainted food; any food that Dumbledore provided is likely to be spiked with potions. The package also contains several potions that might be useful (all labeled so you don’t get them mixed up), as well as a communication mirror. The other half of the mirror is in the study near my room. Someone will be in the room with the mirror at all times, so you can contact us whenever you feel that it is safe. All you have to do is tap the mirror with your wand and say “Malfoy Manor”.
"I have seen that obese whale they claim is a boy," Draco scowled, "and you will not ever compare me to him again if you value your life."
Harry wasn’t sure how long he slept for, but the hollow was completely dark when he finally awoke. He felt more refreshed, but winced as he stretched, irritating the numerous wounds he had received from his uncle and cousin. Harry finished off the bottle of water he had opened earlier, then drank another half bottle of water, before crawling out of the hollow; he stayed hidden in the bushes as he looked around, and saw that it was full dark. The question, he thought, was whether it was late enough for the Dursley’s to be in bed yet; he didn’t want to go back to the house too early and get another beating. Then again, if he stayed away too long they might contact Dumbledore, and then Harry would really be in trouble.
"Because you're the only one who can tell us apart," George replied as he joined them, "It gets quite annoying. Now, who perma-stuck you to Malfoy there, and why does he look like he's about to hex me?" Hadrian looked up at Draco in surprise, but the blond quickly schooled his features to show nothing but bored indifference.
"Easy; we get Lupin to speak to her," Severus said, "Remus Lupin cares deeply for Hadrian and he will be willing to view the memories if the boy asks it of him; once he sees the truth he will be very loyal to us. Lupin is a werewolf and-even though his memories are false-he long ago decided Hadrian was a member of his pack and he will do anything to protect him."
Clouds blotted out the midwinter sun
"No; that will be all," Lucius said and Wispy left again.
** ** **
“That's because Ron can't focus on anything long-term unless it’s food,” Hadrian retorted, but he had a sinking feeling he was losing this argument. He didn't like Draco though, did he? He couldn't like him, because that would make him gay, and he wasn’t gay. Hadrian would know if he was gay…wouldn’t he?
"That's very generous of you sir," Tom said calmly, "However I will have to decline; I plan to join the ministry so that I can work to change the laws regarding contact between wizards and Muggles, as well as work to improve living conditions for magical children being raised by Muggles."
"No," Hadrian replied, "But I sometimes use the clothes to cushion things that might break, so just make sure there aren't any objects mixed in with the clothes before you throw them out."
Harry didn't waste any time but began to run back towards the gate when he was suddenly hit with a pain so intense that all he could do was shriek and writhe on the ground; it was the same feeling he’d gotten when Voldemort held him under the cruciatus. The pain, thankfully, was over in seconds, and he looked up to see a pale-faced Draco Malfoy standing over him; once he saw Harry looking at him Draco schooled his face into a look of cool indifference, but Harry was almost positive he had seen a brief flash of fear in those steely grey eyes.
“Eleven-thirty,” he announced, “Feel like taking an early lunch? We could go out to the gardens, and maybe do a bit of flying after.”
“Yes, Mother,” Draco agreed, following his mother back to the kitchen where Dobby was waiting. He wasn’t going to give up on finding Hadrian-he would never give up on his mate-but he still felt like he didn’t deserve Hadrian. After the way he had treated the boy over the years, then he was powerless to stop the Weasel from hurting him, and now he let Hadrian be kidnapped; how could he possibly deserve to have Hadrian as his mate?
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco pulled the tag off the ribbon and set it aside in the top drawer of the bedside table, where he found a new jar of peppermint mocha scented lube. He withdrew the lube and looked up at his boyfriend with a smirk.
; Amused! "I am not here to kill you Harry-I am here in reference to the letter you sent me. You do recall sending me a letter, do you not?"
Unaware of the thoughts going through Draco’s mind
Harry felt alarm at the blankness as silver eyes lost their luster
But nothing could happen for one was too cautious and the other too brash
"I'd like that," Harry said softly, "What do we have to do?"
“So, Astoria then,” Harry nodded, unbuttoning his shirt, “I can’t imagine you’ll be able to avoid her for too long. I’m guessing, since Daphne probably has this June, you’ll be married by the following summer?”
"Where is Father?" Draco asked, "And what are you looking at?" He took a seat next to Severus, motioning for Hadrian to sit next to him.
"I'm taller than you are," Draco shot back, but the Gryffindor ignored him to focus on Hadrian.
Draco gave him a thoughtful look, then sat down on the edge of the bed, patting the mattress next to him for Hadrian to sit as well. He didn’t speak again until they were both seated.
“I will speak to the minister,” Lucius conceded with a sigh, before glaring down at Harry, “I am about to go through a lot of trouble for you, Mr. Potter, so you had best not make me regret it.”
“Betrayal?” Harry scowled, “I didn’t betray anyone!”
“My-but what happened to him?” Harry asked, “Why does he look like that? And-where was he? Why did I get sent to the Dursley’s if I have a godfather?”
"Elena…" He murmured, and a small smile appeared on his face for just a moment as his eyes flashed brown, "Dark hair, with red highlights and the most beautiful eyes…green eyes. I remember a sweet voice, singing, and laughter…" The Dark Lord’s eyes closed for a moment as if in pain; when he opened them again they had returned to their previous crimson and he regarded Severus coldly, "Why do you mention Elena? She betrayed me; her death was easier than she deserved."
First, Draco had used a potion on Harry to remove the hair on his legs, which wasn’t too terrible as Draco already used the potion himself on a regular basis. Next, though, he had given Harry a collection of undergarments consisting of a pair of black lace thigh highs with a green satin garter belt edged in black lace and a pair of matching panties. Draco had instructed him to put the panties on over the garter belt, that way they could be easily taken off later; the last was said with a leer that made Harry blush. Then he had pulled out an emerald green corset dress with a flounced skirt and black lace overlay, which Draco was currently lacing up for him. Harry held his breath as Draco tightened the laces, and watched as the corset gave him almost-feminine curves.
stood up and walked around the desk, then straddled Harry’s lap to give him a passionate kiss which was eagerly returned.
“I was thinking about that earlier,” Draco said, “and perhaps we should see if we can meet them at Longbottom’s house instead; Mother and Father won’t be pleased if we tell Granger and Weasley the truth without their permission, and they wanted to wait until Severus figures out a way to heal Aunt Bella.”
Harry stepped out of the dressing room and was immediately accosted by Pansy, who held an armful of accessories. Within moments, Pansy had used her wand to lengthen Harry’s hair before braiding small sections of it and weaving tiny golden bells through the braids.
“I, Draco Malfoy, accept the oath given by Harry Potter,” Draco answered, “In return for his faithfulness, I grant him access to my own magic, so that we can free the world from the evil that is the Dark Lord Voldemort. I will honor his oath, and protect that which he has given into my keeping with everything that I have. From this day forth, I swear to be faithful only to Harry Potter, so mote it be.”
"Sorry Hades, but you have to admit it was amusing," Draco grinned, "You had the right idea in using your father to gain respect, however you need a bit of practice to make it sound threatening; don't worry though-we'll work on it later. Now, are you ready to go downstairs? Mother's house elf came in just before I got in the shower, so she is probably waiting for us." Draco picked up a comb and ran it through his hair, and it dried quickly, parting to the left just as he liked it.
“…just be glad your nephew is a better person than I am. If it were not for him stopping me, you and your despicable husband would be dead now,” Narcissa Malfoy hissed, “I don’t care what the old man said, Harry is never returning here, and you had better not ask after him, if you know what is in your best interest. If I hear even a rumor of you asking about Harry, or looking for him, I will kill you; I shall just have to hope that Harry will forgive me, eventually. Now, be gone.” Vernon and Petunia Dursley, both pale as ghosts, fled the train station once they were given permission, and then Narcissa turned to the small boy standing behind her, hands clutching tightly to the handle of his school trunk.
Before straddling the dildo, Potter had inserted a small vibrating item, which Draco hadn’t seen before; if he sat on the dildo, however, the small item would be pushed further into Potter’s anal cavity, which Draco thought was hot beyond words. Potter’s wrists were cuffed and attached to a hook on the ceiling; the chain was long enough so that he was able to rest his feet comfortably on the floor but, after a moment of examining the configuration, Draco realized the chains would pull on Potters wrists if he were to sit on the stool. Potter had a thick black blindfold around his eyes to complete his bondage scenario, although Draco saw that there were still a couple of items left on the desk-after a quick glance to make sure Potter couldn’t see him, Draco cast a silent muffliato and walked over to the desk; lying on top were Potter’s magazine, a pair of small silver clamps, and a red ball gag. Draco stood so that he could keep an eye on Potter, even as he looked at the magazine and noticed the differences between Potter’s final scenario and the one on paper. He discovered that the small vibrating item was called a bullet, and deduced that Potter was using it to stimulate his prostate; what a treat, to find out that the smaller brunet was in to both pleasure and pain. Potter, Draco decided as he looked at the scenario in the magazine again, needed some help in making his fantasies a little more realistic, if this was anything to go by.
"Thanks, but I actually have my own," Hadrian replied, "Sirius gave them to me last Christmas; I'll just head to my room then so we can go to sleep."
"I would be disappointed in you if you didn't," Tom replied, "I'll be nearby if you need me Hadrian." Hadrian nodded his understanding and watched as his father and Severus melted into the crowd; once they were out of sight Hadrian turned back to the refreshment table and got a cup of punch. It wasn't long before some of Draco's friends decided to approach him.
Severus had just finished telling Lucius what Harry had gone through in the past two days and about his life with the Dursley's, when two loud gasps were heard from the bed and everyone looked over to see that both boys were pale, and Harry had his eyes closed; the brunet’s whole body was trembling.
December 14
“No, next time I’ll use a cold water spell,” Draco retorted, standing up and whacking Harry with the pillow. “If you’re not in the sitting room in five minutes, I’ll come back in here and use the cold water spell,” Draco threatened, as he heading for the door, “Oh, by the way, you received a letter, but you shan’t get it until you join me for breakfast.” He heard the sound of Harry reaching for his glasses, and chuckled as the brunet muttered under his breath, then Draco was in the sitting room and opening his own letter. The envelope turned out to contain two letters, one from his mother and the other from Pansy. He read the one from his mother first.
When Draco returned it, Harry rejoiced
“Harry,” Draco frowned at him in confusion, so Harry elaborated, “If-if we’re going to be friends, I’d like for you to call me Harry.”
“And you’ll stay away from Pansy,” Draco added, but his voice was still soft and uncertain.
Cursing under his breath Draco levitated the brunette to lie face down on his bed, carefully setting his glasses on the bedside table, before murmuring a spell to vanish the shirt. Draco gasped in disbelief and horror, fighting back nausea at the sight before him; Potter's back was ripped to shreds! The boy was covered in bruises as well, with one large, nasty bruise on his left side which indicated broken ribs-and likely internal bleeding. Who would do this to Potter? Perhaps the Dark Lord, but if he'd had Harry-er, Potter-at his mercy he certainly wouldn't have let him go.
"With Draco?" Narcissa questioned, lifting one elegant brow as she quickly dried her tears, "And why would he be with our son?"
"I knew you'd come to you senses eventually," Draco smirked, "I'm obviously a much better friend for you than the Weasel; so, Hades, you can call me Draco."
“Breakfast,” Harry agreed, and their first fight as friends was over as quickly as it had begun.
“…I don’t think it will kill you if your mum comes with us,” Hadrian laughed at Draco’s pout, the blond evidently not appreciating the fact that they were being baby sat, “In fact-hey!” Hadrian tried to pull away from the hand that had suddenly wrapped around his upper arm, but the grip was too strong. The last thing Hadrian saw was Draco’s silver eyes widened in shock, then there was the all-too-familiar tug behind his navel, and Hadrian felt the world fall away from him. When the world stopped spinning, Hadrian would have fallen if not for the hand still grasping his arm. Hadrian shoved the person holding him and managed to break free; he reached for his wand and levelled it at his abductor.
"Mmm, maybe," Hadrian replied, "If nothing else we can always have lunch outside. Is Tom coming by today? I was hoping we could talk; we haven't had much of a chance since I got here."
“I’m going to enjoy this, freak,” Dudley growled, “I got in trouble with Dad because of you!”
“Hmm, what do you think, Harry? Should I unwrap my new toy before I play with it?” Draco glanced up at his lover, and saw Harry swallow hard, giving a brief nod and then quickly shaking his head. “I think the unwrapping can wait.” Draco wrapped one hand around Harry’s cock, and used the other to prop himself up. He delicately lapped up the precum on the tip of the bound erection, grinning when he elicited a groan from the brunet. He wrapped his lips loosely around the head of Harry’s cock, briefly sucking, before releasing it with a wet -pop! - and then began tracing the golden ribbon with his tongue. He continued to tease Harry for a few minutes, delighting in the helpless whimpers coming from his lover, before deciding to move on.
*************************
"I hate him," Harry seethed, "He ruined my life! And not only my life, but the lives of so many others!” Harry could feel his magic struggling to escape again, but Draco’s continued embrace helped him to calm down and keep it under control; he still had more questions to ask-freaking out again could wait until he was alone and there was no one around to get hurt. “How did he change everyone's memory?"
“Merry Christmas, love,” Draco said.
"The Hat said I could do well in pretty much any of the Houses,” Harry began, “but it really wanted to place me in Slytherin," his voice grew quieter, dropping to almost a whisper as he closed his eyes, waiting for the explosion; when none came he cautiously opened them and let out a small giggle when he saw Severus and Tom's mouths open in astonishment. He tilted his head back to see a similar look of astonishment on Draco’s face, and laughed again before continuing with more confidence, "So yeah; it wanted to put me in Slytherin, but from the time I entered the wizarding world I was told all Slytherins were evil, so when the Hat wanted to put me there I begged it to place me somewhere, anywhere else, and it chose Gryffindor."
“The food hasn’t been sent up yet,” Draco replied, drawing his wand to cast a Tempus, “We still have an hour before supper. My early years were not quite as eventful as yours, so that should give me enough time to tell you about my childhood.”
“Animal blood and brandy,” Hadrian replied, “He should be fed twice a day for now and, in a few months, you’ll want to have the elves replace one of his meals with some raw meat. I’ll give you all the information later.”
"Especially not him," Draco mumbled, leading Hadrian out of the room. Hadrian called out a hasty good-bye to the girls, rolling his eyes at Draco. The store downstairs was busy, so they waved at the twins, and then went out in search of Severus and Narcissa.
“Do I want to know?” Harry asked.
"Oh, if I have something to say about you I'll say it to your face," Hadrian promised, "But you had better be nice to me if you want your pres-"
"You're getting sappy on me again," Draco complained, faking irritation, "How many cups of cocoa did you have?"
“That doesn’t matter,” Ginny insisted, “Right now is what matters, and right now Mum wants your ferrety friend to come over Christmas Eve. You’ll ask him.” Ginny fingered her wand in a threatening manner, and Harry sighed.
"You is having two hours!" Tillie replied, "You is hurrying!"
“I honor my mother’s promises,” Malfoy said, giving him a blank face, free from his usual sneer, “Mother spoke to me last night, and I will not antagonize you, as long as you afford me the same favor. Here;” Malfoy drew his wand, and stood up, placing it a few seats over before returning to his place; “I do not have my wand within reach. Will you put yours away now? Or at least set it on the table, instead of pointing it at me?”
"Your master wants me to find him," he said, "I will need one of your feathers to do so." The owl hooted softly and flew in a circle around his desk, dropping a single white feather in front of the Dark Lord. "Excellent," Voldemort smiled thinly, then scowled at the owl, "Well? Don't you have somewhere to go?" The owl hooted once again, hopped forward to nip at his fingers, and then was gone before he had a chance to fire off a hex at it. Voldemort glared after the infuriating bird, then turned his attention to the feather in his hand. Post owls had innate magic allowing them to locate their owner no matter where he or she may be; now he simply had to locate Severus get the potion which would allow him to use this feather to locate the so-called Savior. Voldemort left the room, smirking once again as he went off in search of his loyal potions master, eagerly anticipating having Harry Potter at his mercy.
"The years we missed," she said softly, looking at a picture of the children. The photograph showed Hadrian, Aracely and Draco taking turns throwing toys at the protective bubble around the play area, trying to find a weakness, while Helena-a few months older than the other children-frowned at them, and Neville smiled happily, eagerly passing the three trouble-makers new toys to throw. Off to the side a bit Lillian and Luna slept soundly, not in the least disturbed by all the commotion. The picture ended with the children managing to make a hole in the ward; Hadrian and Draco raced for it and reached it at the same time, smiling triumphantly before the hole sealed and they were magically-and gently-transported back to where Neville sat laughing at them.
“Hey! What about me?” Harry looked up to see his godfather pouting, “Don’t I get a hug?”
“Once Moody returns, we will be able to finish up for tonight,” Dumbledore announced. The memory blurred, clearing up as Moody appeared with leading a line of children with them, all grubby and looking frightened.
Draco walked him through setting up the ritual; first they cleared the snow away from a large area in front of the bridge, and the Draco marked the edge of the ritual circle with crystals which would amplify their magic, while protecting them from outside influences. The crystals gave off a soft warmth, which was nice because they were about to get naked, and they wouldn’t be able to cast any warming spells. Once the circle was set up, Draco took out a golden chalice and two silver daggers, which he set in the snow just outside the circle.
Harry spent his days alone in the dorm, and his nights being tortured with the Blood Quill by Umbridge, followed by having his mind ripped into by Snape. He had a constant headache, and the words ‘I must not tell lies’ were now permanently etched into his skin. Not to mention, his friends were once again sending him meaningless letters, not giving him any real updates. Sirius had only written to him once to say that he was trying to get Dumbledore to let Harry come for at least Christmas Day, but that the headmaster had not yet made a decision. When Christmas Eve morning dawned with no further word on spending Christmas with his friends, Harry decided that he would take matters into his own hands; he would sneak out through the secret tunnel into Honeydukes, and then take the Knight Bus to London. From there, he would walk to Grimmauld place.
“Awfully sure of yourself, aren’t you?” Draco drawled, “Remember-we aren’t counting how many people enter your café to gawk at the savior, only actual sales count.”
Hello All! So, this chapter is mostly filler; a little insight to what the adults are up to. I hope to have the next update posted soon, and we'll get back to Harry and Draco. Thank you for all the reviews! I hope you enjoyed the update!
"Yes, I think that will do it," Dumbledore nodded in satisfaction, "Everyone’s memories have been altered, Sirius is in Azkaban for betraying the Potter’s, where he will rot along with the Lestranges, who tortured poor Alice and Frank into insanity, and poor Harry has been left with Lily's sister to be raised in safety until he is old enough to return to the wizarding world; those few who remember Elena know that she betrayed Voldemort and suffered the consequences, and Hadrian and Aracely never existed. I already had that prophecy altered, and all is in place for what must happen in the future. Now, finally, I can relax until it is time for Harry Potter to return to us."
An hour later, Harry was finally able to draw away from Justin and he wasted no time in activating the wards on his door. Once they were activated, Harry looked around with a frown; something felt off…he felt as if someone was watching him. Harry discretely touched his wand where it was in his right pocket and whispered a spell Hermione had taught him, which would reveal the presence of any humans in the area; after a few seconds the spell came back negative, and Harry was able to relax. He walked over to his trunk at the foot of the bed and tapped it with his wand, then opened it to reveal a hidden compartment; Fred and George had sent him the instructions on how to charm the compartment, with Harry’s promise that, at some point in the future, he would tell them what he was hiding.
But I’m not
He says he doesn’t understand why him, and he’s confused, but I don’t think he’s angry. He says he’ll need time to think about it. I hug him and he smiles faintly at me.
Draco half-smirked, half-smiled at his wand. He always knew he was intelligent, of course, but if he’s also powerful? He’ll no doubt turn out to be a good wizard. And, as Ollivander said, if the wand chooses the wizard then it’s perfect for him.
“What’s your full name, dear? Need to record it for the robes.” she asked, glancing at him.
“Oh Merlin! I can’t wait to study Potions. I bet you it’s going to be my best subject!”
consider his Aunt and her husband as parents as well Dora as a sister, he still wouldn’t call them that. He loves them so much, but for some reason he can’t get these words out of his mouth with the knowledge that his parents are out there somewhere, his father imprisoned for the crimes he deserves to be imprisoned for and his Mother leaving him because she couldn’t give him a happy family. He will never love them more than Andromeda, Ted and Dora, he doesn’t even like them but still. They’re his parents.
Despite himself, Draco cracked a smile at the open door
Because I’m crazy in love with
He nodded, handing her the list silently. Another witch came from behind the store and ushered him to a stool and began pinning him for his robes.
This time he did huff at the name, and glared at her while he tried straightening his hair, and she grinned, mischievous and unrepentant.
I can’t hold it in any longer.
They kissed, and it was everything Harry needed.
She’s always so strong, so composed, seeing her breaking down like this hurts. And it hurts more knowing I did this. But I don’t want to lead her on, or hurt her more. I love her so much, but not in love with her.
Diagon Alley was, as always, filled with chatter, excited children with their parents chasing them, weird customers and cheerful shop banners and decorations.
messy hair and he glared at her. Now it’s gonna be harder to fix.
“This should be fit,” he said, and handed Draco a long, light wooded wand box. As Draco opened the box and marvelled at the wand, Ollivander explained, “Hawthorn wood, ten inches long, and a unicorn hair core. It’s reasonably springy,”
His eyes lit up, and he couldn’t help jumping in his seat. “Of course! I mean, I know we went to Diagon Alley multiple times but this is different! It makes going to Hogwarts all the more real. And, well, I also knew I’d always go to Hogwarts anyways but I still can’t help feeling excited at getting a wand and maybe even making friends!” he babbled, at which Andromeda smiled fondly.
Still, he ate dinner then after chatting with Ted and filling him on and staying a bit with his family, he went to his room and got out a quill and Tom’s diary.
“I know.” Harry confirmed.
Draco’s eyebrows rose and his eyes widened at his stupidity, honestly he’s always been smart, but he’s not so good at reading words over. “Oh! I’m sorry for my rudeness!”
“The Mrs. Clause-”
“I still can’t sense him,” he told his mother, “What if he’s not here?”
"Don't pout, Dray," Hadrian laughed, "It won't kill you if your mum comes with us. I think-hey!"
"Of course you would," Hadrian rolled his eyes, "Fine, but you can't use it to interfere with Quidditch."
“An annulment is not the same thing as a divorce,” Draco pointed out, “Father wasn’t happy with the plan, but he eventually admitted that, while divorces are not allowed in our family, there are no rules against getting an annulment.”
“The minute everyone has finished eating,” Draco said, “I’m going to take a shower and change; why don’t you two make a few more ornaments, and supper should be ready for us by the time I come back down.”
Instead, he directed his gaze to the mirror, where he could see that half of the dildo was firmly imbedded in Gryffindor's tight ass; a pained gasp drew his attention back to Potter's face, as the dildo began moving again, slowly disappearing inside the bound boy. Potter was pulling on his restraints, and Draco considered stopping the spell, when suddenly Potter’s expression became one of surprised pleasure- his mouth opened in a small ‘o’! And he began rocking against the dildo, further impaling himself, until he stopped with a sudden gasp, his mouth thinning into a pained line. Draco watched with a smirk as Potter tried to rise off the dildo, obviously seeking some relief, only for the stool to move with him. This had to be the hottest thing he had ever seen, and he was eagerly looking forward to watching Potter tip over the edge. Draco reached down to begin stroking himself again, only to jump when Potter spoke.
"He's upstairs," Fred replied, "Ginny and Hermione are with him. Luckily, Ron had to go get fitted for new robes, so he isn't here yet, although he will probably be here later this afternoon. What's going on?"
"When he gets back perhaps we can have a look at the books," Narcissa suggested, "You never know, we may recognize the language. Now, how long have the boys been resting?"
“Mum! Dad!” Hadrian heard Ron’s voice behind him, “He’s getting away!”
“I believe your memories of the summer thus far are lost forever,” Dumbledore sighed, “If you do remember anything, you should tell me immediately; one of the potions Misters Weasley were experimenting with had hallucinogenic properties, so any memories that come back to you may be false. I must go now, Harry; I will pass on greetings to the Weasley’s for you.”
“Of course not, Potter,” Pansy Parkinson scoffed, “I am simply here to decorate. Now, if you will excuse me, I have work to do before we open this afternoon.”
"What's this?" Draco asked curiously, getting to his feet; He walked over to the crate and slowly pulled the blanket off; when the blanket was clear everyone gasped. Lying there sleeping on a cushion of white velvet was the pale blue dragon that Hadrian had purchased the day before.
“We can start on that translation,” Draco suggested, “Or-there is that box you wanted to look through.”
Sometimes I lie awake pretending to sleep
“You would curse me?” Draco’s silver eyes widened, darkening to grey, “You-you are rejecting me.” The blond’s voice trembled, not in anger as Hadrian had expected, but something like hurt instead. Hadrian watched as Draco’s whole body seemed to droop, and he gave a sigh of exasperation.
“Tonight?” Harry asked, “My place?”
“You deserved better than that,” Draco said softly, vehemently; “For those Muggles to treat you in such a way-it’s barbaric. Not only that, but it was abuse.”
“No,” Harry shook his head, “What’s it like?”
"I want to speak to Severus," Remus said, "I think-if he will help me-perhaps I can get invited into Malfoy Manor and persuade Harry to leave."
Thank you once again to all of my reviewers! I'm glad everyone is enjoying the story so far. This chapter is a little shorter than the others, but it really didn't make sense to combine it with either the previous chapter or the one that will be posted next. I am slowly working my way through the revisions, and I should be able to continue updating about every two weeks, although the days might differ depending on my work schedule. I hope you enjoyed this chapter; all comments are welcome and appreciated. See you next time!
“So,” Harry began, setting down his glass of wine, “Will I ever get to see you as-you know.”
Narcissa waited until the teens had left before turning her attention back to Augusta.
"It is tradition," Lucius replied, "However I can see that you are in a mood, so I will give you ten minutes to collect yourself; after that you will return to the ballroom and remain for at least an hour. For every minute past ten I will add ten minutes to the time you must remain at the party, and I will insure that Hadrian sleeps in his own room tonight-is that clear?"
"Of course we will all go," Narcissa assured him, "There is much to straighten out, and it would benefit you to have more witnesses. Come along Hadrian dear; I'll show you to the parlor." She liked arms with Hadrian and led him back into the house, ignoring the glare from her son.
"I think I'd feel more comfortable to have someone with me," Hadrian agreed, "If everyone wants to come I don't mind, but I would like at least two people with me."
“I-doesn’t hurt,” Harry said between sobs, “I just-no one ever-for me!” His words were broken and confused, but Narcissa understood him perfectly.
“You can’t mean-?” Lily looked horrified when Narcissa nodded, “The veil in the Death Chamber? Oh, poor Sirius!”
“You ungrateful lizard,” he said, “Do you know how much that collar cost?” Arden responded with a derisive snort that made it plain he didn’t care, and then leapt off the bookshelf, gliding over to Hadrian who easily caught the dragon.
Supper was uneventful, the talk mostly centering on the grand opening of Nargles and Nibbles the following day. After the meal, however, when they were in Harry’s bedroom-Harry’s, because Draco technically still lived at Malfoy Manor-Harry had to bring up Draco’s news from earlier.
“You can teach me some more chess,” Harry suggested lightly, “Or-”
"The only clothing half-way decent in here is your school uniform and your underwear," Draco commented, wrinkling his nose, "Do you feel any particular attachment to the clothes?"
“So were Malfoy and Ron,” Neville pointed out, “But Ron didn't spend every meal glaring at him.”
Harry shook his head and, after Mrs. Weasley once again told him she didn’t need his help, went to the counter and began sorting through the tea and tea kettles. He filled several kettles with water, and charmed them to slowly heat to the correct temperature, and then remain at that temperature until the charm was cancelled. He then moved on to measuring out the coffee grounds for several different brews, making sure they would be ready when the customers started arriving.
"I want you to agree to do anything I say for twenty-four hours," Draco said, "and I want you to promise that you will not keep any secrets from me that could affect both of us, that you will tell me immediately if someone threatens you or if you are injured, and that you will come to me or Severus before going off on any rescue missions or adventures."
Draco stood in the doorway of the living room, watching as Harry and Teddy worked on creating their own Christmas ornaments. Harry had talked Draco into celebrating Christmas the Muggle way, and that evidently included handmade ornaments. It also included chopping down a tree (although Draco convinced Harry to let him transport it with magic instead, seeing no point in killing a tree just for decoration; this way, after the holiday, the tree could be replanted.), stringing up lights, and using stencils and a can of fake snow to make winter scenes on the windows. It was all a little odd, but Draco supposed it was charming in its own way. Even if he had no desire to celebrate anything the Muggle way, he would never deny Harry his wish; after learning about the deprivation Harry suffered while living with his Muggle relatives, Draco found it hard to deny his fiancé anything he wanted. Honestly, most days Draco still couldn’t believe he and Harry were actually together, happily sharing a home. They been together for four years now, and it all started with Draco needing a new wand.
When they arrived, still locked in a heated embrace, Lucius Malfoy gave a strangled cry and then fell out of his chair, having fainted dead way. Narcissa, however, just smiled at the two men, and levitated her overly dramatic husband out of the room. The newly-engaged couple didn’t pay them any attention, lost in the magic of the moment.
“Shut it, Potter,” Draco growled, spinning him around and stealing his lips in a passionate kiss, before walking them slowly towards the bed. He shoved Harry, smirking when the brunet cried out as he fell on the mattress, and then sank to his knees. He quickly pulled off the rest of Harry’s clothes, and wrapped a hand around Harry’s erection. “I don’t care about Astoria; not when I have someone so much more interesting in front of me. Tell me, how long do you think you can hold out before you beg for my cock?” Draco didn’t wait for an answer, but immediately leaned in and took Harry in his mouth, swallowing around his hardness.
“Malfoy?” Harry kept his wand trained on the Slytherin, even though the other boy had no weapon of his own, “What the hell is going on?”
“Er, right,” Harry said, bemused; what was going on? Malfoy was being civil to him? He even set his wand away! The Malfoy he knew in school never would have done that! Hmm, there was a thought; was this actually Malfoy? Harry decided to ask. “Er, are you really Malfoy? Only, you’ve never been nice to me before, and it’s a little weird.”
"So, Draco, what made you decide to grant Potter Sanctuary before you knew he was your mate?" Theo questioned, taking one of the empty chairs while Blaise took the other; "Weren't you worried that you would make the Dark Lord angry?"
“That’s right,” Dumbledore beamed at him, “Now, I have taken the liberty of having all your school supplies brought up here. Your wand is also in your trunk, but please only use it in an emergency. I will be by to check on you periodically, although I may send Severus in my stead.”
"That's...I...I'm not interested," Hadrian mumbled, looking away, "I think I should go; I'll talk to you guys later."
“Parkinson!” Harry shouted, “I am not wearing this in public!”
Hadrian remained unmoving for a handful of seconds as he fought to get his breath back, but the sound of shouting had him forcing himself to his feet. Hadrian didn’t chance a look behind him, but immediately began running away from the Burrow, and towards a wooded area beyond the Weasley property.
"I understand your concern," Dumbledore said soothingly, "however Harry needs to spend time with his relatives to renew the blood protection that is within him; if he doesn't go back it would be an insult to Lily's memory, her sacrifice. Don't worry Remus-I will explain everything to Harry and take full responsibility for sending him back. In addition, I will set up regular patrols to check on him so that we can be certain he is not being mistreated by his relative's."
A few seconds later, Harry felt something pushing against his rim, and he tried to push his hips back, wanting to take his lovers cock deep inside him. His bonds were too well tied,
“Harry,” Draco called softly, shaking Harry’s shoulder. The brunet responded with a groan, and promptly rolled over, pulling a pillow to cover his head. “Stop being ridiculous,” Draco scowled, yanking the blanket down and making a grab for the pillow.
"Will he even be able to sit up and drink the potions?" Draco wondered, "His back is really torn up, and his ribs are still broken."
“I will go to Hogwarts,” Severus announced, “If Dumbledore is behind this, I will find out. I’ll meet you back at the Manor as soon as I can.” Narcissa and Draco nodded, then stepped into the Floo to return home. Severus waited until they were gone, then headed back into the ministry; he would be going to Hogwarts later, but first he wanted to see who was missing from the ministry. The new minister would likely be able to confirm whether certain employees were still at work, or if they had left early, it was just a matter of persuading him to help.
"I always wondered how he made that umbrella," Harry murmured, "I didn't think he could make it himself, and now I see I was right."
“I can’t really blame him,” Draco said, “I spent the last two years telling him our relationship was only temporary; how was he supposed to know-” The sound of a chime interrupted him, and Draco frowned when he recognized two magical signatures. “He brought Lovegood with him.”
Perhaps it was the wine or the fires warm glow
"Take all the fun out of it why don't you?" Blaise said teasingly, and then he and Theo made a wizard's promise to keep the information secret.
“I think I’ll go to bed now,” Draco said a few hours later, putting his book aside as he stood up. He crossed the few steps to where Harry was sitting, and placed a hand on his shoulder. “The Muggles-they wanted you to feel worthless,” Draco said quietly, his grey eyes solemn, “You are a lot of things, but worthless is not one of them.” He held Harry’s gaze for another moment, before giving a small nod and turning to the bedroom.
“Shut it, freak!” Dudley punched him in the stomach again, “I’ll teach you to talk to me like that!” The next punch knocked Harry to the ground, and then a hit to the side of his head had him seeing stars. He barely registered as Dudley tied his feet together, muttering something the whole time, but his eyes widened as a wad of cloth was shoved into his mouth, being held in place by some duct tape.
while we still can?”
"Really?" Hadrian asked hopefully; with his attention on Severus he failed to see the pained expression on Draco's face as the blond turned his head away; "Then Draco and I can go back to just being friends?"
“Who was that man, Father?” Draco asked, “How do you know him?”
Now, it wasn't very often that Severus had a chance to be alone in Albus’ office, so after the last person left he had cast a non-verbal spell to put all the portraits to sleep and proceeded to snoop.
“Of course, Harry; I simply forgot,” Draco said, then added with a sly smile, “I wouldn’t be able to call you Potter for much longer anyway, and it might be a bit confusing if we called each other ‘Malfoy’ all the time.”
"I don't know if that's a good idea," Harry said quietly, "I mean, as far as I know she was using me too, and Dumbledore has her convinced that you're all evil; she probably thinks I'm evil now as well." He closed his eyes to hold back the tears and was surprised when he felt soft lips press against his cheek, but Severus spoke before he could comment on it.
“Of course,” Hadrian grinned, “I wouldn’t want to leave you out of it. You either, Luna.”
“I think I’m done here,” Luna said thoughtfully, conjuring a brilliantly colored dream catcher and sticking it above the window in the front of the store, then adding a sprig of mistletoe. “Rolf was with his grandfather today, and promised to bring me home a surprise. Mind the Nargles.”
“And you do it quite frequently,” Draco said, grabbing his hand and pulling him closer, “Sometimes I wonder why I put up with you, and then I remember that I really have no choice.” Hadrian frowned and looked down at the bedspread, pulling away from Draco.
"What was that?" Draco demanded.
"If you really have to," Hadrian frowned, "If someone messes with me can I hex them?"
The small group spent dinner discussing Lucius and Narcissa's school days; once they viewed the memories Dumbledore had stolen, it unlocked further memories that they had previously forgotten. It seemed there were many prank wars between the Gryffindor Marauder's-Sirius, James and Remus (they chose not to mention Peter Pettigrew)-and the Slytherin Demagogue's-Lucius, Severus and Tom (Sirius named them claiming that the Slytherin's were all power-hungry tyrants); they drove most of the teachers crazy while they were in school, and once McGonagall wound up with pink hair for a week. Dinner was very light-hearted and filled with laughter, which continued as they retired to the family sitting room.
"That reminds me," Draco began, "The life debt; I think we should settle it now and I know what I want."
"Very well," he agreed, "But just this once I will let it go." Draco placed his free hand on the back of Hadrian's neck and pulled him in for a searing kiss, being careful not to nick Hadrian with his canines.
Severus mentally rolled his eyes, knowing that Dumbledore really meant to say “bring him back under control”, but nodded his agreement.
"They aren't very nice," Tom admitted, "I hate living with them; they think they're so much better than me. I thought everything would be better after I started at Hogwarts, but Headmaster Dippet says I still have to go back every summer; I don’t see why I can’t just stay here." He scowled for a moment before perking up, "I have plans though; I can't do much for myself, but when I graduate from Hogwarts I will go into the ministry and fix it so that other magical children don’t have to grow up like I did."
Draco set the letter aside and closed his eyes against the pain of losing one of his friends. Vincent may not have been the most intelligent of Draco’s friends, but they had known each other since they were children, and Vincent had always been loyal to him. The Dark Lord had to have known Vincent would never succeed at killing Dumbledore-he knew that Vincent would die completing his task. In fact, he probably counted on it-what better way to punish a parent than by killing their child, their sole heir? Draco shuddered as another thought came to him; Vincent’s fate could have been his. If Lucius hadn’t been able to place most of the blame on Bellatrix for that night in the Department of Mysteries, the Dark Lord might have assigned Draco that task, and Draco could be dead now. Not, he admitted, that he would be foolish enough to touch a cursed necklace with his bare hands, but going up against Dumbledore-whom the Dark Lord himself had never been able to defeat-was nothing short of a death sentence.
"I'll try to be fast," Hadrian replied, "I'll come back within the hour regardless, and then we'll still have an hour or so to wander around." He stood up and followed George out the door, leaving Draco and Fred alone in the twins living quarters.
"I'm just curious about how the animagus feature on this thing works," Fred replied, "I told Draco that George and I are creating items for the Auror department, and I think something like this could be useful." He stepped away from Hadrian and handed a sheet of parchment, two quills, and some ink to Draco; "These are the two-way parchments we mentioned earlier; we'll pass one of the other sheets along to Luna or Neville, whomever we see first."
“Good point,” Sirius conceded, wincing at the thought of facing his cousin’s wrath, “Speaking of, we should get going.” Harry settled in between Draco’s legs, then tilted his head back so he could smile at his boyfriend.
“That is all I ask,” Narcissa said, “Now, I believe it is time for bed.” Draco stood and walked his mother to the door, accepting another kiss as she left the room. With a sigh, he headed further into his suite, to his bedroom.
"Are you kidding?" Fred-Draco was almost positive that's who it was-raised his eyebrow, "Have you even noticed the crowd you've drawn?" For the first time Draco looked around and noticed that everyone in Diagon Alley had stopped to watch the fight, "Luckily for you Colin Creevey was here with his parents and he told us what was going on; George is keeping an eye on the store. You sure you're okay mate?" He looked at Hadrian, who nodded but didn't reply, "Okay, but owl me later; for now, I need to get Ronniekins up to the store so we can wait for Mum. Hermione and Ginny-you'd better come with us as well."
It was true; Harry had felt out of sorts ever since the night Cedric died, but that guilt and anger had slowly faded while he was in the palace. He felt happy now, and even optimistic about the future. It was amazing, Harry thought, what a difference it made to have an adult he could actually count on, and a friend who made him take care of himself. If Hermione worried about him not eating, she would nag him until he ate or, more likely, left the table in irritation. When Draco thought Harry wasn’t eating enough, he stuck him to his seat, then placed a full plate in front of him and a potion beside it; Harry was given the choice to eat the food on his plate, or take a nutrient potion. The first time, Harry had chosen the potion-and he immediately regretted it. Not only did it taste worse than any other potion he’d taken, but it gave him the chills and he had to spend the next three hours in bed. After that, Harry decided eating was the lesser evil, and he’d actually gained a little weight.
“Why should I let you come? What will you give me?” The voice is pure sex, making my cock throb even harder; a warm tongue laps at the head, and I would be ashamed of the whimpers escaping my throat if I wasn’t already so desperate. “Well?” he demands, “What will you give me?”
"Thank you Wispy," Lucius gave a curt nod as he accepted the scroll and the notebook, "Make sure tea is ready in about an hour. That is all."
“Good thing it didn’t listen,” Draco said, “I can’t imagine you in Gryffindor, wearing that atrocious red and gold.”
“Yes, with the flying car,” Draco sounded amused, “I remember that story. I am glad they were able to rescue you, even if I wish you had not needed rescuing.” Harry hummed his agreement, and they sat in silence for a few minutes. They could see and hear people running up and down the train car, but none of them so much as looked at their compartment, and Harry found himself relaxing further; he still had time before real life took over again.
“Mother would be furious if she thought I was pressuring you,” Draco agreed, “I may be her son but, somehow, you are her favorite.”
“About eight,” Draco replied, “Breakfast is in the sitting room; I didn’t want to start without you because it could disrupt the stasis charms.”
“You don’t have to bond with someone else,” Sirius reassured him, “Come on, let’s sit down.” Sirius led  him back to the bed, “There is a potion you can take so that, when it comes, the heat isn’t as strong; you’ll still feel uncomfortable, but you won’t have the urge to…well, you won’t have to do anything. You’ll feel warmer than normal, and you’ll attract a lot of attention, but you’ll be able to control yourself. When all this is over and you’re ready to bond, then you can stop taking the potion.”
“Hmm,” Astoria frowned, “Mother will likely hex me for it, but I am going to take a risk and be honest with you. I was hurt that last year at school. I kept my head down most of the time, but one day I managed to get on Umbridge’s bad side, and she cursed me. Mother’s healer said that the curse damaged me, and I will be lucky if I can have even one child; the healer expects me to lose my ability to bear children before I am twenty-five.”
"My Lord," Severus bowed, "I just finished purging his body of a magic stripping potion, and now Draco and I are going to give him the healing potions; the injuries are more serious than I had first thought."
"I miss Elena," Narcissa said, "And Lily too; what are we going to do about Bella?"
"I suppose not," Hadrian replied grudgingly, before turning back to George, "So, yeah George; I trust Draco."
The boys spent the next hour translating the potions journal, and then Draco insisted Hadrian begin his potions assignment; Draco had, of course, already finished his. Draco set to work on his essay for History of Magic, occasionally setting it aside to help Hadrian with something he didn’t understand, and by bedtime both Hadrian’s potions assignment and Draco’s history essay were complete.
“I just wanted to see what it was,” Draco replied, “I didn’t mean to-”
“I apologize, Father,” Draco said.
"I'm game," Ginny said, "And…I'm sorry for the other day, with Ron. Even though I was hurt that you chose Malfoy-Draco-over us, I still shouldn't have stopped him from helping you. Can you forgive me?"
"You can probably talk to her and Hermione at the same time, but we need to make sure they can get away from Mum for a bit first," Fred said.
“Too…slow,” Harry panted, grinning; Draco responded by pulling Harry’s legs up to rest on his shoulders and then leaning forward so that the brunet was bent nearly in half. Draco let go of Harry’s hip with one hand and instead tangled it in dark locks, wrenching Harry’s head up for a kiss. The slight pain and the closeness sent Harry over the edge, and Draco eagerly ate the pleasure-filled screams spilling from his husband’s lips. The tightness around Draco’s cock became almost unbearable, and soon he followed Harry over the edge, filling his husband with his seed. He continued thrusting until his cock softened, then collapsed on top of Harry; he quickly rolled over onto his back before lethargy could sink in, pulling Harry with him so that the brunet’s head was on his chest.
Harry wasn’t really angry at his boyfriend; he’d cross-dressed for Draco before and found the results to be very…satisfying; even more satisfying than when Draco did the same for him. But before, he had never done more than put on some lacey knickers and a tight dress, and both garments had been on the floor within an hour. This was different, because Draco had given him a whole outfit and was doing his makeup; plus, he was expected to remain dressed like this for the rest of the day! Harry felt self-conscious, and the fact that the silk knickers made him hard…well, that just irritated him further.
After lying on the branch and sulking for a while Harry realized that he was hungry, and knew that-as distasteful as it was to his human mind-he would have to hunt. Mentally preparing himself for a long day, Harry scanned the area to make sure that there were no people or animals around and then descended from the tree so that he could drink from the stream again.
“Not even for Potter?”
/////////////
"Yeah, yeah," Hadrian said dismissively as he ducked his head to hide his flushed face, "It seems like I always owe you for something."
“Come on, love,” Harry said, “We should go to bed; you promised everyone breakfast in the morning, and I expect a certain seven-year-old to wake us up at dawn.”
//////////////
"Fine," Harry sighed, leaning back into the pillows and closing his eyes so he wouldn't have to look at anyone, "I guess I should start at the beginning, with my family. Okay, so my relatives have never liked me and they neglected me and called me names all throughout my childhood; they told me my parents were worthless and dies in a car accident and also that magic wasn't real, yet whenever anything happened they blamed me and locked me in the cupboard, although they stopped beating me when I was about eight and my accidental magic destroyed the living room."
"I believe that the Veela blood in your family is becoming dominant in Draco," Severus informed him, "He has been acting protective towards Hadrian all day, and while you were in the pensieve he was…well, he was essentially cuddling Hadrian to keep him calm." Severus curled his upper lip to show his disgust with using the word “cuddling”, receiving a smirk from Lucius in return.
"Now we can get started," Dumbledore said, "I have the potions for everyone to take so that our memories will remain the same-except concerning the children-once the children are given to their new families I want them to be safe, so those memories will be altered. Now, first we shall take little Lillian; she already has red hair and I know you and Arthur have always wanted a daughter, so she will be the newest member of the Weasley family. What would you like to name her?"
“Are you ready love?” Draco asked, slowly withdrawing his fingers as he knelt up.
In your bed, in your arms
Harry’s breathing increased with the fearful anticipation of what was to come, and then he heard a sharp whistle, and a scream was ripped from his throat as he was hit, not with the leather of the belt, but the hard metal belt buckle. Harry’s body jerked involuntarily, and he screamed again as the next lash fell. It seemed, Harry noted absently, in some part of his brain that was not focused on his painful beating, that he could make involuntary movements and sounds, but he couldn’t direct his muscles.
"Just don't be too long," Draco told Hadrian, "I still want to wander around a bit before we have to meet Mother."
"I'm not too sure that is a good idea," Draco argued, "If the Weasel is supposed to be here soon, we won't have the time to show them all of the memories they need to see. Also, I thought we agreed that they shouldn't be shown until they can be away from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley for a few days, so that they have time to process the information to avoid giving anything away by accident."
"Ah, poor little Hadrian can't handle the adult talk," Fred teased as he put away the collars and chokers before Hadrian could get a good look at them, "I guess that means he won't be interested in backing our line of adult products."
"By making sure that all magical children are raised with at least one wizarding parent," Tom replied promptly, "If the child is a Muggleborn, then they will have monthly visits with a magical tutor, and I also think we need to create a new branch in the ministry to monitor magical children living with Muggles so that we can make sure they are not being abused or neglected."
"You really should stop calling me that," Draco chided him, "After all, you're soon to be a Slytherin as well."
“F-fine; can I at least see you?” the other boy demanded.
"I shall mention it to him," Lucius agreed, "Now, if you boys aren't busy it's time for supper;" he led the way downstairs, telling the boys, "Severus has left for the evening to speak with Tom, and they will both return sometime tomorrow. Have you decided on your sleeping arrangements?"
"Because we aren't supposed to be sharing the memories with anyone," Draco replied, "They don't want us involved, so we decided to take things into our own hands." Arden chirped his agreement, lightly hitting Hadrian with his tail.
"I copied some of the memories so that you and the others at Gringott’s will know the entire truth," Severus informed him, "I would simply ask that you are careful in choosing any non-goblins to show the memories to."
Before Harry could decide if he would rather sit down, the plug began vibrating again, this time at a higher intensity that almost caused him to cry out at the sudden pleasure; luckily, he clamped his mouth closed at the last moment and instead clutched the chain more tightly, feeling the metal bite into his palms. The vibration only lasted a minute or two, and Harry was relieved when it stopped, only to lose his balance when it immediately started bussing again, this time even more powerfully than before. Harry tried to get his legs back under him, but he found he could only gasp and bite back moans as his prostate was stimulated mercilessly for what seemed an eternity. His cock and balls were hard and aching, and Harry was immensely regretting the decision to tighten the cockring and shrink it, as now it was painfully tight.
“That man,” Pansy fumed, glaring at Harry's back, “Why does he have to make everything so difficult? He is so frustrating!”
Dinner passed uneventfully, and then Draco opened his presents. Many of the gifts were expensive but fairly useless, meant to show the giver's status, while a few were actually useful, things Draco could use in school-even if they were a bit ostentatious, such as the ostrich-feather and gold quill and the set of potions vials made of diamond. Draco's second gift from his parents was a weeks' vacation for two at a popular wizarding resort for teens, Severus gave him a small line of credit at a prominent potions ingredient shop, and Tom gave him a gift certificate to an exclusive restaurant in Paris. When he opened the dragon figurines and saw the sigil etched into the wings, Draco was hard-pressed to hide his excitement as he looked up at Hadrian, who was standing beside his chair.
"Oh, Muggles communicate by using phones, and each phone has a number that you have to dial in order to talk to whomever the phone belongs to," Hadrian explained, "I agree though; it seems pick-up lines are pathetic in both worlds. I would think that honest compliments would work better."
"So you basically want me to tell you everything that ever happens to me, no matter how insignificant," Hadrian said drily, "What about when there isn't enough time to find you before doing something? And what about if I stub my toe, does that count as being injured?"
Now, standing in front of the mirror, Harry regretted giving in so easily. Harry glared at his reflection, ignoring the blond standing behind him for the time being.
Harry shook his head and leaned back against the tree. Whomever had lived at the manor must have cancelled the transformation somehow, and…maybe they had done something to Harry’s memory? He had obviously escaped somehow, so maybe he had been tortured or something, and the wizard-if it was a wizard who found him-had wiped his memory as he was escaping? Or, since he wasn’t in as much pain as before-just a headache and some sore muscles-maybe the wizard had helped him, but then erased his memory so Harry couldn’t reveal him? That was a possibility.
“That makes it even worse! One of the first things I was taught is to never use and artefact unless I know exactly what it does,” Malfoy scowled, “Father put the entire school in danger, including his only heir! And last year, Moody, he was really a Death Eater in disguise?”
"That's right," Hadrian smiled sleepily, "Now when people talk about their parents I can be part of the conversation; I've never been able to do that before."
"Hmmm? On the bed," Draco replied; he stepped back slightly, allowing Hadrian to pull away and walk towards the bed. The brunet was just leaning down to pick up the new outfit when he felt hands on his hips; he spun around and gasped in shock as Draco pushed him down onto the bed, quickly climbing on top of him and trapping Hadrian's hands on the bed beside his head.
"But of course," Dumbledore chuckled, "Let's see, I currently give you 2500 pounds a month, correct?" There were affirmative noises from the Dursley's, "Well, since this is causing you more trouble, and you have to deal with the...special medicine, I will double your payment; that will be 5000 pounds a month. In addition, if young Dudley here is willing to assist with Harry’s…physical conditioning, I will give him 500 pounds a month. I know this takes away time that you could be spending with your friends, but are you willing to help?” Harry didn’t hear a verbal response, but Dudley must have nodded, because Dumbledore exclaimed; “Excellent! Now, I only brought the normal payment with me today, so I will send the rest of the money to you tomorrow. These expenses will, of course, come out of Harry's personal account as usual, and if you find you need more funds to properly care for him just let me know; you know how to contact me Petunia. Now, have we covered everything?"
"Don't worry Hades," Draco nudged Hadrian until he scooted over a bit, giving Draco enough room to squeeze into the chair, although just barely, "There are potions to grow your tongue back so it would only be temporary." Hadrian gave him a look that clearly said 'Oh, that's comforting!' before rolling his eyes and relaxing with Draco's arm around his shoulders. Severus performed the diagnostic spell and nodded in satisfaction.
"Mmm, so, no reading for me tonight," Hadrian chuckled.
"We just have the basic information," Griphook replied, "We know that Albus Dumbledore kidnapped children and performed illegal blood adoptions and that he changed the memories of everyone in wizarding Britain, but that is all we know." Severus pulled a vial of memories out of his robes, and levitated it over to Griphook.
"Hermione takes both of those classes," Hadrian said, "Maybe after Draco and I talk to her she can help."
"I agree," Hadrian said, blushing, "Besides, Draco and I should be going; we only have about an hour or so to explore and then we have to meet up with Narcissa for lunch."
“I mean you no harm, Harry,” the Snow Queen said, cupping his face and turning him to look at her, “I offer you safety and the chance to make a new friend. If you do not wish to come with me, I will not force you.”
"Can you read it out loud for me?" he asked, "Not paraphrase, but actually read it."
McGonagall spent an hour going over the rules with them, and Harry had been dismayed to find out that pretty much all of his free time over the next month would have to be spent with his roommates, to encourage them to get to know one another. Harry and Malfoy were assigned to work on all two-person projects together, while Justin and Michael would do the same; group projects would, of course, be completed by the four of them. They were to have at least one roommate with them anytime they left their quarter and on all Hogsmeade visits, and breakfast and supper would be taken in their common room. The common room entrance would be warded so that an alarm would sound if anyone tried to leave on their own without a pass from a professor. Harry felt rather like he was in prison, but wisely kept this comment to himself, simply nodding at his Head of House until she finally left.
“Kiss me?” Harry frowned, “I, er, I don’t think so. I kind of remember her kissing my forehead last night, but I don’t think she did today. Why?”
Once they were done eating Draco sat back down next to Harry on the bed, while Severus and Voldemort conjured comfortable-looking chairs so they could sit nearby.
"I agree," Severus said slowly, "However, what about the people who were directly affected by Dumbledore's actions? Those who lost children and loved ones?"
“I’m looking forward to it,” I laugh, “Thank you love.”
Harry silently crawled off his bed and knelt down beside his trunk; he removed the rucksack on top, grabbed the Marauder’s Map, made sure his wand was safely tucked into his sleeve, and then drew on his Invisibility Cloak and left the room. The common room was empty when Harry got downstairs, and he quickly checked the map to make sure the hallway was clear before leaving Gryffindor Tower.
“Done reading for the night?” Harry looked up to see Draco smiling at him.
Hadrian had told Scrimgeour that Lucius was innocent and had actually been trying to help him that night at the ministry; Hadrian said he had tried to tell Dumbledore, but the headmaster refused to listen. The new minister was very happy to have dirt against Dumbledore, who spent a lot of time interfering in the ministry for someone who claimed he didn't like politics, and so Scrimgeour agreed to change the paper work to show that Lucius had been granted a ministry pardon. All-in-all, it was a very pleased group that left the ministry that afternoon.
“Blaise is a lazy layabout,” Pansy countered, “He’s probably still in bed; I don’t know why he hasn’t been fired yet. Oh well, never mind; I’ll see you later Ron. Oh, and Potter was right-you will be getting a new uniform after Christmas. Toodles!”
“Just thinking,” he replied softly, climbing into the bed and under the covers, “Good night, Draco.” Harry quickly turned on his side facing away from the blond, nearly missing Draco’s quiet response. Harry listened as Draco’s breathing evened out again, and then closed his eyes, hoping for a peaceful night’s sleep. Unfortunately, Harry’s mind refused to quiet, and he lay awake until the early hours of the morning thinking about his situation with Draco. He finally fell asleep just as the soft light of dawn became visible over the balcony.
"Hadrian, would you be willing to help me by translating this book?" Severus inquired, "I just need information on the ritual, and then the Horcrux potion translated into English so that we can restore your father's sanity; afterwards I am sure he will be willing to help translate if you don't want to."
"Fine," Hadrian huffed, climbing back into the ridiculously soft bed muttering the whole while, "Can't believe everyone's telling me what to do, and I have to listen Malfoy of all people; stupid git."
"Hmm?" Hadrian looked up from where he had been feeding Hedwig and smiled, "Oh, he was one of the people I wrote to before I ran away; I didn't really give him any information though, because I didn’t want to put it in writing. Why don't you wait here in case I need to write back girl?" Hedwig hooted her agreement and settled down on the back of the desk chair while Hadrian made his way back over to the bed and opened the envelope, "Huh, it's two letters-one is from Luna." He unfolded Neville's letter first.
“Augusta wants to view the memories,” Narcissa smiled at Lily, “I believe I shall invite her over for tea; after she views the memories would you like to speak with her?” She pulled out a sheet of parchment and wrote a short note, sealing it and then placing it in the silver tray for the house elves to deliver.
"Yeah," Hadrian nodded, "Thanks for everything guys; we'll talk to you again in a few days." Draco nodded and George walked them out while Fred went to check on Lee and Angelina.
“I know pronounce you bonded for life,” Xenophilius Lovegood smiled down at the two young men in front of him, “Let no man tear asunder that which Merlin has blessed. With a kiss, your bond is sealed.”
"Lucius Malfoy," the new student held out his hand, and Tom accepted it, replying, "Tom Riddle."
“I think I’m about ready for bed,” Draco said, “The bed is big enough we should both be able to sleep on it and still have plenty of room.”
“I know all that,” Harry said impatiently, “And I still agreed to do the ritual. I like Draco, and I am willing to take a chance on bonding to him if it will defeat Voldemort.”
"I don't...they were flirting with you," he scowled, "And making fun of me. You don't get mad at them for flirting!"
“How in Merlin’s name did you ever get to be a teacher?” I demand, relaxing further as Draco begins to card his fingers through my hair.
“You think I can’t teach you a lesson by myself?” Dudley demanded, “You think you can take me on? Then let’s do it; come on, freak! Show us what you’re made of!”
A soft laugh, and warm air puffs out over my ear; I lean my head back, and lips are instantly attached to my neck. A gentle kiss, then the feel of teeth scraping over my pulse point, and the pleasure-pain of a new mark being made. I know these lips, those hands, and it is enough to make me relax against the man behind me, reaching one arm back so that I can tangle my fingers in his thick locks, keeping his mouth where it is.
About six months after the divorce Harry, who decided to become a stay-at-home dad, ran into also-recently-divorced Draco Malfoy and his ten-month-old son, Scorpius, at the Healer's office. Both had been bringing their sons in for a routine check-up, and had ended up having lunch together. He and Draco had moved in together a year later, and gotten married just six months ago.
“Okay,” Harry agreed, slipping under the covers and letting Sirius tuck him in, “Thanks, Siri.”
"Two galleons," Fred replied.
“Of course not,” Lucius sneered, “You and I shall go on our own mission; I believe it is time to reclaim any Horcruxes that we can. The diary is gone, unfortunately, but the others should be easy to gather. Nagini is at Riddle Manor?” Tom nodded. “Bellatrix has the cup, the locket is in the cave-wait, no; the locket should be in…Sirius Black’s house. Severus shall have to get that one. The ring?”
"Of course," Hadrian replied, "I'd probably still get lost without you. I'll just be in here reading; come get me when you're done getting dressed."
They remained in the clearing trading hexes and blows
"Calm down Dray," he said, "It was a legitimate question; yes, we're mates Blaise, so you should probably tell all your friends so that they don't piss Draco off. Also, I'm getting re-sorted at the beginning of the year, and I expect I'll be in Slytherin."
“Say her full name and it will enlarge the picture, and possibly give you sound as well.”
"Like I would tell you," Hadrian laughed, "Besides-I don't know yet; you can stay here and plan some more while I shop with-who's coming with me?"
“Oi! Malfoy!” Ginny called, stepping into the main part of the store, “How dare you open a competing café! And, more importantly, how dare you not tell me!”
“Here are the sales records,” Pansy said, handing Draco a stack of parchment, “I made sure everything’s in there, so he can’t claim you cheated.”
Suppressed feelings surfaced each time emerald and silver clashed
“Ah!” Harry cried out in shock before he could stop himself; the stool shocked him! Seconds later, the plug began vibrating again as well, stronger than last time, but not as strong as it had previously been. Harry almost forgot about the stinging hexes on his leg, so focused was he on the vibrations in his ass, until a particularly strong hex had him yelping at the pain and renewing his efforts to get free. As the pain increased, the vibrations stopped and Harry had nothing to distract himself. It was with great relief and an almost-sob that he pulled his leg off the stool when the ten minutes were finally over.
"Yes, such a horrible birthday," the sarcasm in Hadrian's voice was pronounced, "You got a party with your friends and family, a table-full of gifts, and you managed to convince some deity to make me your mate, forcing me to be with you unless I want you to die,” He shot a glance at Draco, and found that the blond was scowling at him, "What? I was just kidding!”
“Well, I suppose if you have to mark me, this is better than the other one,” Hadrian admitted grudgingly, giving Draco a quick peck on the lips.
The next memory zeroed in on a small house, where James and Lily were enjoying a peaceful evening with Hadrian-now called Harry-whom they evidently believed was their child. Hadrian and Draco witnessed the events that everyone had been told happened October 31, 1981. James and Lily were sitting on the couch with Hadrian-Harry-and Tom (now Voldemort) blasted the door open; he killed James while Lily tried to run, and then cornered the red-haired witch who begged for Harry's life-she was hit with the killing curse, and then Voldemort aimed his wand at Harry, but a flash of blue light had the curse rebounding, and Voldemort was apparently destroyed, leaving baby Harry with the lightning bolt scar he was so famous for.
"Maybe," he shrugged, "but that's my right, and not even your father will interfere unless I use it to harm you,” Tom’s eyes narrowed, and Draco hurried to add, “Especially since it will allow me to know where you are at all times and will bring you either back to the manor or to my side if you are ever in danger."
“I did ask first,” Draco replied; Harry nodded, then frowned as he wondered where to begin, and what to tell him.
“Inside?” My lover asks teasingly, trailing one hand down my side until a slender digit is pressing at my entrance.
“Fuck, Harry,” Draco groaned, pushing him towards the couch. Harry gave him a sly grin.
Harry returned to the drawing room, and saw that all the kids were still sitting on the couch, laughing and screaming in excitement. Well, Harry thought wryly, at least they weren't running around scared.
"Good," Tom said, "I will be back shortly." He gave Severus a brief nod before leaving the room, and a moment later Severus heard the sound of the Floo in the study being activated. Sparing a quick glance at the boys to make sure they were still okay, he opened his journal to begin the calculations for the potion that would restore Tom Riddle to his former-and hopefully sane-self.
"Thank you, Aunt Bella," he said politely, "I'll be sure to look at these later."
"Right-o mate," Fred agreed, "Besides, the stick up your ass leaves very little room for a-"
"So, you really have switched sides," Pansy said musingly, "Draco said as much, but I thought he was joking." She tilted her head thoughtfully before smiling and sliding closer to Hadrian. "Well Harry-can I call you Harry?" She didn't wait for a response but continued; "If you have gotten Draco's approval then that means you're practically one of us; I'm sure you don't want to spend all your time cooped up in the manor with him, he can be a very high maintenance friend. If you ever...desire company of a different sort, I would be more than happy to entertain you." She made as if to lay her hand on Hadrian's arm, so he stepped back, shaking his head.
"Since you were in the room with me when I reached my inheritance the magic probably affected you as well," Draco replied, "Have you felt any different today?" Harry tilted his head thoughtfully, taking Draco's offered hand and allowing the blond to pull him to his feet.
“He left all of his belongings at the manor,” Severus shook his head, “As you know, there are certain items he would not leave behind even if it meant the difference between life and death. If you like, I can gather those items and bring them here-perhaps that would convince the Malfoy’s that Potter left willingly and they would not be in the Order’s way while we search for the boy.”
“What did they say when you told them I was Santa Clause?” Draco asked.
“No problem,” Ginny returned the hug, “See you in the morning, boss!” She stepped away and Apparated home. Harry took a minute to check the wards and make sure the shop was secure, then followed her example.
As part of his Christmas gift to Draco, Harry had allowed his lover to dress him for the festival. The two had often discussed fantasies of having sex in public, but neither were quite confident enough to try anything that daring. Instead, Draco had convinced Harry to let him prepare the brunet for the festival; the whole day would be a form of foreplay.
“They held up fine,” Harry replies, feeling his skin flush as Draco smirks, giving the brunet a heated look, “You can probably cancel them now, before I overheat.”
“I’m going to see about handing out a few of these,” he told Luna, “You going to hang out here, or go home?”
“Okay, Pansy,” Harry said, “Are Draco and Blaise…dating?”
“Don’t you want the bells out of your hair?”
Draco felt the brunet tense in his arms and make a soft sound of distress, so he released Hadrian's hand and slid his arm around the other boy's waist to keep him from fleeing as he leaned down, closing the small distance between them and gently pressing their lips together. Hadrian remained tense in his arms for a moment until Draco slid his hand up to card through the dark locks as he nipped softly at the lips beneath his and Hadrian parted his lips with a soft gasp; Draco took advantage of the action to slip his tongue into the other boy's mouth, gently lapping at the warm cavern while Hadrian finally began to relax, melting into the embrace.
"You really are melodramatic," the Dark Lord commented, and Harry knew he had to be losing his mind because Voldemort had just sounded
"Certainly," Severus replied, "Of course, it is rather difficult to be friends with a dead person, however perhaps he would be willing to come back as a ghost for you."
For the next half hour Harry sat on the stool, moaning in pain from the stinging hexes and his neglected erection, and in pleasure whenever the vibrator activated. He ached for relief, but none came, and he cursed himself for his stupid curiosity about bondage. What if his back up release didn’t work? How long would it take someone to find him? Oh, Merlin! What if Snape found him? Or Malfoy?
Monday 12/22
"You're so mean Hades," Draco pouted as he rose gracefully from the bed, "You're supposed to be nice to me on my birthday." Hadrian looked over his shoulder, ready to make a joke, but was stunned by what he saw.
Instead, he found that Albus Dumbledore was a manipulative old man who not only encouraged the Dursley's to mistreat him, but
“Okay,” Harry said, voice a little shaky, “I’m starting to believe you, but it’s just so weird.” He looked up into grey eyes that were a light with curiosity. “I know you’ve changed from how you were in school-we both have-but…how can you be Santa Clause? I mean, where’s your beard?”
"I quite agree with you my dear," Dumbledore said, "At the moment I have no way to get him away from that family, however I have Severus keeping an eye on Harry for me; the next time they leave the manor I will make sure we have people in place to rescue the boy."
"You will not finish that sentence if you value your life and my sanity," Severus interrupted, glaring at the young blonde, "However, it does seem plausible; there is no sense in worrying about it just yet because you will not know for certain until your birthday-maybe not even until his birthday. Now, I believe it is time to wake Potter up and give him the healing potions. Afterwards we can discuss the collar he is wearing." He arched a brow at Draco who merely smirked back at him, having recovered a little of his usual attitude. Severus stood up and crossed the room until he stood by the bed looking down at the injured boy.
"The magic from my inheritance seems to have started out bond," Draco said, "Normally we wouldn't begin to form a bond until after we both turned sixteen, but it's started early; most Veela's don't get to be around their mate until after the mate reaches the age of sixteen, so this is rather new and not very well documented."
