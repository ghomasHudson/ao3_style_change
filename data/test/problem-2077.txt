“Excellent thinking my boy.  I always knew you had better instincts than your father.”  Narcissa smiled wryly and glanced at the stairs.
"I'll contact Ginny," Hermione said, standing and going to the fire. She didn't want to send an owl just in case Harry's flat was being watched.
“He’s gay. The object of your obsessions since we were eleven years old has decided that he’s into guy’s and you are the most eligible bachelor around. So. What are you going to do about it?” Pansy asked again. Draco sighed.
Smiling, Harry got in line for the floo.
Harry tried not to smile at Draco's embarrassed word ramblings . It was strange seeing him like that...so open and unguarded. To be honest, he kind of liked it. It showed him that Draco could shed the mask he so carefully kept in public.
Harry raised his head, regarding the Minister with tired eyes.
We don't own these characters. They belong to JK Rowling.
“A lovely young man was sucking my cock.  A handsome brunette on his knees worshiping me.”  Draco murmured against Harry’s ear.  He nipped at the soft flesh lightly and pulled away exiting the lift as though nothing at all had occurred.
“Prove it.”  Draco tossed back boldly as they waited for the lift.
The next Saturday morning, Harry and Draco were having a nice lie in, happy they didn't have to go into work. After the commotion of the past week, things had finally calmed a bit so the two men were enjoying the down time.
Admittedly, Harry thought Draco was good looking. And this morning, when he saw Draco in his boxers and sleeping, he wanted to stand there and stare until Draco woke up on his own.
Thank y'all for reading! Hope you're enjoying it! If so, let us know! :)
Without warning, Draco cried out his release, making good on his promise to fill Harry's mouth. Harry swallowed as best he could but still some of the come ran out the corner of his mouth to drip off his chin.
“I’d say the two holding you were the lead bludgers mate.  The two who came at me were likely the back ups. Plus the other two weren’t as big.  So they were probably beaters.  Either way we’re lucky.  Thank you Draco, really.  I wasn’t prepared for something like that to happen tonight.  I got these tickets in the mail and it sounded like fun.  I guess I should have expected something though, the way Ginevra has been running her mouth, I just never thought that they’d blame me.  She got benched as a result of her own actions.  I had nothing to do with it.  Not really.”  Harry ran a hand through his hair and sighed.  Draco set his water down on the desk and looked at the brunette.
“I’ll say.”  Harry agreed.  “It’s probably some old rich wizard with too much time on his hands.”  The two friends snickered and were instantly hushed by Hermione with just a look. They behaved the rest of the time they were in line.
"I haven't spoken to her in a couple of weeks," Harry told Narcissa. "But I will owl her."
Harry was momentarily shocked at Draco’s admission but he schooled his features and stood, walking towards the clearly embarrassed blond.  He put his hands on Draco’s desk and leaned over so their faces were close.  “Then why don’t you?” he whispered, then pressed his mouth to Draco’s.
"Harry, I can't stop thinking about her," Ginny said miserably. "I can't eat or sleep and I almost fell off my broom in practice."
There were pride flags hung above the bar, not so many that you were overwhelmed by them, but enough to make it clear that this establishment was friendly to the alphabet.
“No not much.  They’re not allowed to make a person's life more difficult because of it.  For instance, they’re not legally allowed to deny a person a job, place of residence, or target people based on their sexual preferences.  However, there’s no law stopping people from beating up every nancy boy they come across who is foolish enough to be out alone.  There’s no law preventing employers from creating a hostile work environment to get you to quit because they know you’re a ponce and don't want you there." Draco paused, lost in his thoughts for a moment.
“Hey Harry, any plans today?” Ron asked as he came down to the dining room and poured himself a cup of coffee.
Harry followed Draco to the living room fire, waiting to floo to the Ministry. Something Draco said earlier had caught him unaware and now he was questioning himself.
Harry looked around the room, memories of being there with so many lost loved ones flooding his head and tearing at his heart. He wasn't prepared for the rush of emotions and he had to will himself not to get upset or let anything show on his face.
“Harry, you’d better call up to the minister’s office and see if she has any special instructions for us, or anything.”  The blonde said focusing on his work, or trying too.  He couldn’t help but sneak glances at the brunete whenever he wasn’t looking.
“Her timing is impeccable.  I half wonder if she has a sixth sense about when I’m about to get my jolly’s?”  He grumbled sitting up to wrap his arms around Harry’s neck.  “Hold that thought, love.  You know she’ll just barge in here if we ignore her.”  Draco sighed.
Thank y'all for reading! See ya next time!
“I ate at work darling.  You go on up to sleep and I’ll put these old things away.”  She started picking up the journals and papers strewn across the desk.  Draco nodded and went up to his room, stripped down to his skivvies and crawled into his bed too tired even for his usual workout.
Draco nodded at her in thanks and she turned back to Harry.
Only a few moments later, Harry was suddenly pushed from behind.  He tripped over his own foot, but Ron righted him before he could fall.  Harry whirled around to see four members from the Holyhead Harpies glaring at him.
“Enjoying the view Potter?”  Draco asked.  One of his perfectly manicured eyebrows rose just slightly.
"Intruding?  Why absolute nonsense.   I'll hear none of that kind of talk.  You are always welcome here Harry dear.  We owe you so much after all.  If you hadn't testified on Draco's behalf at the wizengamot, he would be in Azkaban with his father."  Narcissa frowned and actually shuddered at the thought.
He’d been doing this sort of thing for the last 5 years while they got their business degrees and gathered the initial investment funds for the club space.   Blaise had selected some of the best photos from his portfolio to display around various areas of the club.  Though Draco discouraged it, he didn’t really like having his face plastered all over the place.  It made him uncomfortable.  There were plenty of more artistic shots too.  One’s that he’d done for an Lgbtq magazine in America, a copy of the article and an interview accompanying it.  And some things like that about the place as well.
He didn't have time to look around much before Draco led him upstairs and into a very cosy looking bedroom.
“Professor?”  Draco finally managed.  “Hermione, what on earth is going on?”  He finally asked too much in shock to be formal.
“No, not really no.  I was convinced you despised me.  I never dreamed that I’d be here discussing my sexual preferences with you.  You look great by the way.  I’d bend you over this desk so fast given half the chance.”  Draco laughed and then blushed and glanced into his water glass wondering if Pansy had spiked it somehow.  ‘What the hell is wrong with you Draco!’ he chastised himself silently.
With the same slow movement, Harry leaned his head toward Draco's, tilting it and closing his eyes. Gently, Harry pressed his lips to Draco's and warmth like he'd never felt before bloomed in his chest and stomach.
“Ok cool, because this grand reopening thing is tomorrow night. So make sure Hermione gives herself the next morning off at least.” Harry called after him.
Draco groaned and opened for the kiss taking his feet down from off his desk and getting to his feet.  He slipped Harry’s jacket off and ran his fingers lightly along the brunette’s arms, his fingers and mouth exploring every single inch of tattooed skin.
“Draco you got this?  I’m gonna go back down and do some damage control.  Keep them up here for a bit and the round of muggles that witnessed the fight will leave and then no one will question why they aren’t hurt.”  Draco nodded.
Draco was having none of that slow shit. He wanted hard and fast. He pulled himself forward and pushed himself back, hard. Harry groaned loudly and finally took the hint. Grabbing Draco's hips, he picked up the pace, fucking his lover as hard as he dared.
Draco whined and tried to push against the finger. Harry mumbled a lubrication and stretching spell from around Draco's cock then slipped two fingers inside.
“Good. I expect free pass’s when you decide to move forward with this. Six will do, since it was my idea after all.”
“Actually It’s Draco Black now.  Has been since not long after the war when I had the audacity to call my father an idiot and reject his values.  He disinherited me as I’m sure you’re aware.  I believe you ran a piece on that in the prophet am I right Slyvester?”   Draco asked him.
“I...I guess I never really thought about it.”  Harry sighed wondering how he missed it.
“Do you think Kreacher will blow up something if mum and I fix dinner?”  The taller man asked, running his hand through his shaggy hair.
He had a full sleeve on his left arm of an intricate pattern that looked sort of like the fiendefire had.  He also had two heartagrams, which stood for love, unity, and connectedness.  A good sized one was just below his navel, and the other one was smaller and covered his left nipple. There was also a small portrait of his mum on his right inner forearm. The last was a small portrait of Hedwig on his left inner forearm. She had always been there for him, especially when he felt the loneliest.
Draco choked on his coffee and damn near drowned himself as his cheeks flushed bright red and his mother slapped him on the back.
Hey y'all! Sorry for the delay. I hope you're still with us!
“It’s always so much harder to hurt them when they tell me I’m pretty.”  Draco shook his head as he pulled his hands into the monkey fist pose and took a haiko daiji stance.  He swiped one bloke across the face and spun around in a back kick and used the momentum of his body to carry his weight through to land a kick to the other dudes face.  Both hit the ground and Draco ducked and landed two quick blows to the throat and chest of the third guy that had broken loose from one of the bouncers.
Piston and Draco had moved on to making a few new potions that Piston knew she didn’t have the skill for but she knew Draco did.  She gave him a list to work from while she caught up with the bookkeeping After the potions were finished and the lab cleaned up, the blonde went over the books with Piston paying close attention to everything she showed him.  He dare not let his thoughts stray to the little tete-a-tete with Harry earlier.  Part of him desperately wanted more.  He hadn’t dated much.  There hadn’t been much of a point.  People didn’t trust him, especially once they saw the dark mark on his arm.  He rubbed at it unconsciously as he thought about it.  He’d tried everything to rid himself of it.  Nothing had worked.  It was a brand that would be with him forever it seemed.
Harry moved Draco's hand, which was inching slowly downwards under the blankets, and gave his friend a confused look.
Instead, Harry walked over to Draco, took his hands, and pulled him so they were both standing in the middle of the room.
“Fancy paper. I wonder if it has the wrong house?” Harry asked. No one he usually associated with on a regular basis would care about fancy paper.
"Thank Merlin. I can't speak long but since you firecalled I want to tell you and Draco to come to my office after work. I believe I have a safe place for you two."
“Did you ever think we’d be doing this? Having an actual conversation without fighting?”  Harry asked, amused.
“Indeed.”  Draco murmured with a smile.  He straightened up and slipped himself out of Harry as he handed the brunette a couple tissues and a packet of wipes.  He was so used to doing things the muggle way, that magic wasn’t his first thought.  “I do hope we can do this again.  Often.”  Draco added, hoping that Harry would want to perhaps go on a date with him.
“Of course, which room is your’s?  The one at the top of the stairs?  Well I’ll just call for you.”  Draco laughed and headed into the kitchen with his mother.  “Wonder if we’ll be able to find anything around here?”  He asked looking around the huge old kitchen.
Kreacher bowed deeply. "Thank you, Master Potter," he said in his creaky old voice then disappeared.
“Yes Sir.  Of course, and I am honoured that you think so highly of my skills.”  Draco nodded unsure what to do with the praise.
It had been a hellish few years for him.  Though he kept those donations anonymous.  The charities had reached out trying to figure out who was responsible so they could properly thank him.  Draco refused.  The last thing he wanted or needed was any more civil service awards cluttering up the palace.  He already had scads of those from the muggle charities.  The wizarding world would just construe it and malign his intentions as trying to buy off his fathers name and reestablish himself in society.
“Both actually.  The Muggle shoot is first, it’s high fashion.  Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Versace.  We need to keep your modeling career in the muggle world going after all.  Your pretty face is half the draw.  The wizarding shoot is second, 2 hours each. Then I have a break blocked out for you before you go downstairs and meet the vip guests for the opening.  Wizarding press first, then muggle arrivals 2 hours after.  Everyone has rsvped.  You’re fan club will be here among the muggle vip’s.  I have the new set of photos ready for them and being sold at the bar.  I copied your signature magically to all of them.    It should all go off without any leaks or crossover but just to be sure, I’ve hired extra help with notice me not staff and the ministry sent a couple aurors to be on premise in case any obliviations needs arise.”
"I had Ginny pack your things, Harry, and bring them here. I had Narcissa do the same for you, Draco, and then sent her along with everyone's belongings to Grimmauld," Hermione continued. The fire in Grimmauld's sitting room is warded so you can only floo into the Ministry through my fire. Same with firecalling. Now, Harry, do you have an answer for Severus?"
"Take a couple deep breaths Potter."  He stated in a soothing voice.  "Tell me what you saw, exactly.  Can you do that?  I need to determine if it was a real death eater or just a copycat.  Damn the profit for publishing pictures.  I'm surprised they're not selling them as Halloween costumes."  Draco quipped.
“Yes, Draco definitely got his head for numbers and business investments from Lucious but very little else.  By design.  All of us have sought to distance ourselves from our parents and have tried to bridge the division they caused.”  Pansy supplied squeezing Draco’s hand.  Just then there was a commotion over by the bar.  Draco glanced back and saw none other than Harry Potter and Ron Weasley being beat up by six very large and angry quidditch players.
“Excellent. So, are you still doing that backroom special?” Pansy asked pointedly. Draco narrowed his eyes.
"Merlin...Draco...holy fuck!"  Harry shouted.  He was already so close, whimpering in ecstasy, gooseflesh popping up all over his body.
Thank y'all for reading! See ya next time!
"Well, Er, did you tell her?" Harry managed to ask, trying to ignore Draco's wandering hand under the blanket.
Harry, stunned at witnessing Draco kick some serious ass, held his ribs as he struggled to his feet.  His cheek was bruising, he had a busted lip, and he was sure there was some damage to his ribs, but all of that didn’t matter at the moment.  All he could register was that Draco Malfoy probably just saved his life.
“Well maybe we do!” the biggest of the four exclaimed.
Thank y'all for reading! See ya next time!
See ya next time!
“Couldn't have done it without you luv.”  He murmured with a smile and kissed her cheek.  She smiled and batted playfully at his arm.
"What the hell."  He shrugged, gripping his wand and following his cousin through the portal.   He was followed by Harry, and Severus.
Their work was so efficient that by lunchtime, enough ingredients had been prepared to start on enough potions to last almost a week.
We don't own these characters...they belong to JK Rowling.
The house elf appeared with a pop and bowed at Harry's feet. "Master called?"
"I have wards on the flat and Grimmauld Place," Harry told Draco then dropped his face into his hands. He couldn't believe this shit was happening to him again. Draco nodded and narrowed his eyes deep in thought.
“Have you eaten?  I could fix us sandwiches.”  Draco offered stifling a yawn.  Narcissa shook her head.
“Harry Potter has been attacked, actually he’s being stalked and harassed for weeks now and the git didn’t bother telling anyone.”  Draco shook his head looking frustrated.  Narcissa sank into a chair across from him looking pale and her forehead creased with worry.
Harry, blushing at Narcissa's praise, waved his hand. "You owe me nothing," he commented. "All I did was tell the truth."
“He thinks that’s why I left?” Harry asked, a bit incredulous. “No.” He shook his head and chuckled. “I certainly wouldn’t be the first gay aurror. Not even close.” They both cracked up.
“You started a brawl with one of my customers in the middle of my club.  It has everything to do with me.”  Draco intoned bored as he unbuttoned his cufflinks and rolled up his sleeves.  He faced the two men holding a bloodied Potter between them.
Hey y'all!! Big shoutout to Drarry Black for prereading and betaing this for us! She rocks!
"Thank you, Mrs. Malfoy," Harry said. "And for your hospitality. I apologize for intruding without warning last night."
Draco finished the fashion shoots and as the staff stepped in to pack up and whisk away the high fashion photographers through a side entrance the blonde grabbed himself a sparkling water and slipped upstairs to his office near the elevator and lay down on his own sofa barefoot with his eyes closed after drinking down his water.  Staying hydrated was a key to keeping his face wrinkle free, and avoiding prolonged exposure to the damaging UV rays of the sun, which he was wont to do anyway as he was extremely prone to burning.  An hour later after a quick nap he went down to meet the wizarding vips in his freshened up suit. Pansy would be among the vip’s he and Blaise would be greeting personally after arriving first.
Harry took the hint and got up, thanked Hermione, and gave her a brief hug. He was too tired to make any more small talk. Matter of fact, he barely registered Draco taking his elbow in hand and flooing them into a very modest living room. It was sparsely furnished and there were no house elves in sight.
Draco doubted he’d have achieved all of this on his own.  Half the events that had garnered them notice had been Blaise’s doing.  Draco modeling had been a joint effort between Pansy and Blaise together teaming up on him and convincing him that he had to work and was pretty enough to be a runway model.
“I’ll be sure to see that he comes once or twice.”  Draco said, fixing a devilish grin in Harry’s direction.
Hey y'all! A special thank you goes to Drarry Black for prereading and betaing. She's awesome.
"I'm glad to hear that," Hermione said with a smile. "Now you better get Harry to your place before he passes out on my sofa."
“Don’t worry Harry.  We were stupid kids.  You’re mine now and you’d better not be planning on ditching me anytime soon.  I’ll have to go see if Diggory really is a vampire in new mexico.  I’ll sick him on you for breaking my heart.”  The blonde giggled.
Draco ran his thumb over Harry’s knuckles as they were told that Remus told everyone that Harry was sick and Draco had family business at home for the weekend.  They had put up a barrier so no one could hear anything in the room or even go near it.  Sirius did tell them Minerva, Pomfrey, Ron, and Hermione knew what was going on.  Minerva because of her position, Pomfrey because she’s the nurse, and the other two for obvious reasons.  Both boys nodded and smiled as the other two men entered the room.  The older men knew the younger ones had questions, and they hoped they had the answers.
He sit up as the wolf sit next to him.
“Are you asking me out, Scarhead?”
“Damn.  So the only way to see if it works is for me to use it and hope for the best?”  Harry asked when they sit up to take a break.
“Is everything alright?  Harry just came in and demanded to see Draco.  He was hysterical.  Draco led him to the gardens to try to calm him.”
“Papa, don’t hate me, please.”  he whispered.
The girl in question turned to the bed, her hands on her hips.  “What’s wrong?  Harry Potter, that red headed woman needs to learn a lesson, that’s what’s wrong.  How dare she talk to you like that, to Draco like that.”
Harry moved his hand and wrapped his fingers between Draco’s.  “He’ll get there.  I overheard them the other day after you left.  He’s worried about how you grew up.  I’m not though.  I know we’ll fight and argue, but that’ll make the sex better anyway.”
“He’s fine.  Nothing’s broken or gone, thank goodness.  What happened?”  She asked, looking at the students and walking to Lavender to check her as well.
The blonde nodded and looked over at Harry.  “What I said earlier, I meant it.  I’m sorry.  I want to apologize to Granger and Weasley as well.  Growing up as I did, learning things, feeling things, well...it was hard to come to terms with some of it.  I took it out on you three, thinking you had it so much easier.  Learning that wasn’t the case, seeing you at that battle, well...it didn’t set with me that if you died. I couldn’t apologize to you.  Is there anyway, anyway at all, we can start over?”
“Aren’t you going to give me a kiss?”  The newcomer asked.
Harry just shrugged.  “The people that ended up mattering the most don’t care.  Molly is stuck in old traditions.  She knows the truth and still thinks everyone is lying.  Hell, having my dad tortured and raped for 16 years should be proof enough.”
“DRACO!  DRACO!”  he called out, trying to figure out which way to go.
They all watched as the lover’s looked up and then back at them as they disappeared and an opening to whatever was behind it appeared.  Harry looked at his papa, silently asking what now.  Remus looked at Sirius and the dog nodded.  He moved in front of everyone and walked through, lighting his wand tip so they could see.  When they got in, Harry knew which way to look.  He saw a person with his arms changed, ankles too.  It was like he was an animal.  What got him though was the eyes that looked at them when he saw the light through the opening.  Harry ran to him, ignoring the others.
Harry nodded and sat at the table.  “Molly’s going to ask questions.  Ginny is with Neville, she told me.  I gave their blessing, but Molly always wanted me married to her.”
“Down the hall on the left.  Only about five feet, maybe six.”  she whispered.
“Oh, Prongs.  I wish we knew sooner.”  He whispered, covering his friend up.
Draco gently laid his boyfriend on the bed and Harry started to take his robes off.  He was still hot.  Draco sat beside him, letting the older Potter sat in the chair at the desk.  They didn’t have to wait long for Remus to come through.
“Why can’t you accept me?  I know Remus told you he’s my papa, James was my dad.  Lily Potter was just my godmother.  I’m a bearer, Draco is who I’m going to be with.  If you can’t accept that, accept me, then you need to leave.  I don’t want to see you.”
It was over, the one thing he knew was definite in his life. It was over, no more fighting. No more tears, no death. Who was Harry Potter now? Could he get to be normal? Could he dare to do things he always wanted without worry? He stood in the hall as he watched everyone hug their loved ones, mourning the losses they all had. Yes, they all had one. He watched as Remus was hugged by Sirius, who had faked his death with the help of Lucius Malfoy, of all people. Lucius, who had always known about Severus being a spy, had taken precautions to help Harry, when talk of Draco being made into a death eater by force started. As soon as that was known, the Malfoys apparently went to Dumbledore. That old fraud barely helped them. That kind of upset Harry and he didn't know why.
“Babies, he wanted babies.”
“Thank you, papa.”
Harry threw his arms around his father, not knowing how to start.
Harry nodded.  “I know.  I love you.”
Most Potter’s who kept a journal for the future had wives, even Charlus.  His wife had passed while on vacation and that’s how he met John.  John was the Healer in charge of his wife, who had a potions accident and ended up in the hospital.  From what Harry had gathered, they had gotten drunk and it was the first time Charlus had ever considered a man.  He also read that the Peverell’s, Potter’s, and the other lines with bearers told their heirs, but also told them of the risks of exposure.  It was also the Malfoy’s who started the potions, invented the very one still used by pureblood families today.  The potion practically forced the heir to have a wife because of duty to continue the line.  Harry closed the book as he finished it.
He turned his head a bit, smiling as Harry sat at one of the stools at the snack bar.
Everyone watched at the oath swirled around them and locked itself tight within the two men who held their hands together.  Sirius nodded and backed away.  He looked at Harry, who had watched them and nodded, smiling a bit.  Harry smiled back and looked at the two men who knew the answers to the questions he had.
They all watched as Draco processed the information.  Harry for one, was hoping he wouldn’t have say more because he really didn’t want Lucius to know some of it.  He may have gotten the man out of Azkaban, but Lucius Malfoy was power hungry, Draco was more like his mother thank Merlin.  Draco looked at each of the men on his couch and then to his mother.  She nodded, answering his silent question.  He could feel the anger, the regret, the turmoil, all creeping up within him.  The potion forced upon him made sense now.  It was the potion the heir took if they had the gene.  This gene was a defect, of course, but one that he would have liked.  Especially given how much he actually cared for the green eyed man in front of him.  What he didn’t get was why.
“He doesn’t like me.”  Draco whispered.
“HARRY!”
“Plates on the counter.”  Remus stated, sipping his tea.
“We don’t know.  We all walked in as they flew to different parts of the common room.”  Dean stated, knowing Draco wouldn’t say anything, let a lone anyone else.
It had been a few days since finding James Potter behind the lovers portrait and Harry was just waiting for something to fall.  He never had a normal life, this he was used to.  Being with Draco was starting to spread rumors around the school and they both knew the prophet would be finding out soon enough.  They were actually surprised no one leaked out anything yet.  Seamus and Dean were a bit hesitant with their friend, but given that Dean was at the manor for however long before Harry, Ron, and Hermione got him out; they understood.  It was when the savior was alone, like now.  Draco was in Runes with Hermione and so Harry had a free period.  He still didn’t know what he wanted to do once school was finished, but was happy he came back.  It started out just wanting to be with those he cared and loved about most.  Now though, he was accomplishing something he never thought he could.  Harry never planned on love, on future, on a family because of Voldemort.  Now though, he wasn’t going to let anyone get in his way.
and Remus just barely made it out.”
Sirius ran a hand through his hair and looked at his cousin.  He could tell by her face, she remembered how crazy their uncle was.  He looked at the boys and sighed.  They needed to know this.
She figured me out second year as well, she just didn't know till seventh that the boys went with me every month. We sent her an owl asking her to meet us on the train and then dove into every book we had. That's how I knew I put the mating mark on both of them. What I, we, didn't understand was why I did it to both of them. You see, Sirius had told us that same night that he thought he liked boys and not girls. Something in me snapped, that's the best way to describe it and the bites just happened."
A few weeks flew by as school work loaded up on the students of Hogwarts.  The weather was finally turning colder as November was ending.  Molly, thankfully, had been kept from Harry and Draco as was promised by their parents and the Prophet wasn’t as harsh as they could be when the information finally reached the paper.  Lucius, of course, helped immensely with that since buying it.  He also fired one Rita Skeeter.  She refused to have her articles looked at, saying she should be free to write what she knew and how she wanted.  To say there wasn’t any love lost between her and the remaining reporters was an understatement; everyone was happy she was gone.
Harry just nodded, not able to speak as he moans at the sensations in his body.  Draco pushes up and looks at Harry as he moves his hands lower.  Harry keeps his eyes on Draco as his boyfriend’s breathing helps him relax.  A loud moan comes out of Harry as his prick is wrapped in the hand he loved so much, nothing but the good sensations running through him.  He picked up his hands and brought Draco’s face back to his, tongues automatically dancing at the new step they reached.  Nothing but heavy breathing, pants, and moans coming from either boy as Draco wrapped his hand around both pricks, getting them where they need to go.  To their surprise, it’s Draco that cums first, Harry quickly following though.  Draco makes sure to fall next to his love, taking him into his arms.  Nothing is said for a bit as they both relax and their breath comes back to normal.
“YOU’RE GOING TO TEAR THAT BOY’S HEART OUT GINEVRA.  WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?”
Remus nodded.  “Now, they haven’t progressed that fast.  Sirius, you saw James with Lily the whole time at Hogwarts.  He was always different with her.  Always the more submissive one.  It the gene.  I know because he found it in a journal.  I didn’t think Harry would be though, not with the way he grew up.  But, seeing that look.  He’s already that dependent on Draco, Draco will be as well if I’m right.”
It was the first time he referred to Remus that way, but if Draco noticed, he didn’t comment.  Draco just nodded and walked in, sitting in the floor and opening a book he brought with him.
Harry opened his eyes to see Remus looking at him, his eyes changing before him.  He curled into Draco, wanting to hide from the man.  He knew he wouldn’t hurt him, it was his papa, but he looked a bit scary.  Draco took Harry in his arms and Harry could feel him talk, but not what was said.
Yes, Draco knew the bearer thing made a lot of Harry’s feelings show in ways he never thought; however, being Harry’s rock...Harry’s confidante in ways the others couldn’t wasn’t something the blonde was taking lightly.  He loved Harry’s fire, the passion the dark haired wizard showed in everything he did, it was mostly what drew Draco to him in the first place.  The way Harry’s eyes swirled with the green, all different colors of green, when his emotions got crazy was beautiful.  What Draco loved about this boy, this man, the most was his ability to love in spite of everything he had been through.  His ability to forgive those that wronged him.  When he heard about Remus and Sirius, hell even James and Lily Potter, and seeing that Harry wasn’t as upset as he would probably be if the role was reversed was just part of it.
**Dream**
Harry nodded.  “Can you please go to Malfoy Manor and ask Narcissa if we may come by as soon as she allows today?  I need to ask her and Draco’s assistance with something I don’t want Lucius to know of quite yet.”
Remus knelt in front of the young men on the bed.
Harry nodded.  “I know.”
“Please, please...Draco, don’t stop.”
“Uncle Alphard fell in love with your grandfather, Charlus’ father, Harry.  Like those of us in this room that had the potion, it was your grandfather who had the gene. (they all nodded) Our families were much like the Malfoy’s and Weasley’s, something stupid ages ago made a feud.  Anyway, they had to hide and live separately.  What I found in the journal is that while they were apart, they didn’t sleep.  Alphard describes dreams where he was with your grandfather in a beautiful meadow one minute and the next, he could hear him calling and couldn’t find him.  I then went to find the journal you had taken out of the vault, Harry.  What you’ve been dreaming is described in your great-grandfather’s journal as well.”
Draco let his finger run around the hole of his lover and watched as the green eyes he loved roll back and Harry’s back arch off.
Harry, for one, had questions for the three men that knew a lot more than they were apparently telling.  He did remember that his papa told him they didn’t think he’d have a heat.  However, Harry had a feeling it was more because they didn’t know the extent of Harry’s abuse with his godmother’s relatives.  He had only told Hermione and Draco about Petunia’s silent abuse during the nights after his third year.  He wanted to get past it and didn’t want to dwell on it.  With Draco, who had similar experiences knew exactly how his lover felt about the abuse bestowed upon him.  Hermione, well...she had a boy in her hometown that got a little handsy. When Harry was learning about himself during the time Ron was vacant from the hunt, Hermione shared some things as well.  They had helped each other heal and Harry figured Ron knew by now.  If he didn’t, well, it would be soon.
Harry turned to see Sirius and smiled, moving to let him sit. Sirius didn't say anything, but handed him the sandwich he brought out for him. Harry ate it silently, trying to figure out all the thoughts in his head. One question popped up and he turned to Sirius.
“Up, love.”  Harry whispered and Draco obeyed, lifting his hips for Harry to take his pants and boxers off.
Draco walked closer to the bed and Harry pulled onto his arms, making the blonde land on him.  Draco smiled, leaning in to kiss the slightly younger man as Harry wrapped his arms around his neck.  Draco loved these moments, the ones where Harry let go.  Sometimes it was hard on him as well, but as long as he was in control, it was fine.  Harry sighed as he felt the blonde settle between his legs; he liked him there.  As Draco deepened the kiss, Harry wrapped his arms tighter around the blonde, keeping him in place.  A moan left him as Draco’s hand started to slowly run down his skin, leaving a fiery trail down his ribcage.
Draco chuckled and leaned down to touch his lips to Harry’s.  Harry kissed the blond man back, letting him dominate the kiss.  Draco rolled them till he was laying half his body on the man under him.  Harry moved his arms so his fingers could tangle in the blond hair of his boyfriend, a small moan leaving his mouth as Draco moved in, deepening the kiss with his tongue.  Harry couldn’t believe how it took this long to get to this point.  It seemed both were fighting this for so long because of duty, and the stress of that leaving let them be who they were meant to.  Both boys moved till the slightly older one was being cradled in the younger's hips, Harry’s legs spread just enough for it to be comfortable. Just as both boys were getting into it, someone cleared their throat, making Draco jump and cover Harry.
Lunch with the Weasley's
How to tell the girl that while Albus Dumbledore had good intentions, he always was out for himself and for the “greater good” everyone else be damned.  Remus looked at the girl and moved to hopefully offer comfort.
“Can you two please let me in on it? Ever since we got out of the damned place, something’s been up.”
“Please, please…”  Harry just kept repeating.
Harry started to shake and the older two looked from the elf to their cub.  Sirius turned the journal over he was reading, now having a clue to what may be wrong, and turned to the elf.
“Godric, Draco.”  Harry sighed, laying down and enjoying the ride.
“So, what you wanna do while they study?”  Harry asked.
“It’s a bearer thing, but one that shouldn’t be happening to you.  Your dad had a connection with Charlus.  It was how we knew when Charlus and John were attacked, we just didn’t get there in time.  Messed James up for weeks, it did.  With James not being here, you shouldn’t be having these visions if you will.  I will ask Sirius if his uncle’s journal has anything either.  We also have the Potter ones, if you want those.”
Harry held out his hand and Remus pricked his finger.  They all watched as Remus took the finger and touched it to the cloud.  After they pulled back, they waited.  If Albus used hallow magic, Harry’s blood may work.  It might take Annaliese's though, Remus was hoping not.  For a bit nothing happened, and they could see some of the other eighth years making there way out for the day.  They weren’t seen though as Sirius put a barrier up as soon as he heard the entrance open.
“Hold him, it’s important.”  James stated, thrusting Draco to his son.
“It’ll be ok love.  I’ll sneak back in under the cloak.  Try to sleep a bit before I get here please.  You need it.”  He whispered.
“Maybe she should treat you with respect.  Honestly Harry, I know I am very stubborn and set in ways, but this isn’t right.  Telling you who to love isn’t right.  Gin also told me that’s why Charlie hasn’t been home.  Apparently he has a husband as well.”
They nodded and Harry let them know he sent Slinky to the Malfoys for an acceptance to tea.  They older men both nodded and then escorted Harry to Gringotts to see just how much he owned.  Once landing on the front steps, Harry let the marauders do the talking for him.  He followed the men up to one of the goblins and listened as they explained about how Harry would like to look at the Potter estate now that he was seventeen.  The goblin looked down at Harry, who just nodded at the guy, girl, whatever they were.  The goblin looked back at his guardians and listened as the goblin let them know to wait so he could get the family goblin assigned to him.  Harry looked around and saw Bill, who waved.  He waved back and then turned when Remus motioned for them to wait at an empty desk.
“Mother’s right, father.  You need to come to terms with what he have discussed.  I will apologize if no heir comes to this, but I will get to marry as I see fit.  I deserve happiness, father, don’t I?”
“So mote it be.”
She smiled, just a small one, but a smile.  “Alright as can be.  His grandfather passed, so I’ve been helping him anyway I can.  He’s taking over for him and I’m joining him after graduation.”
“I’m fine.  Maybe we shouldn’t have addressed this today.”
“You’re papa’s right sweet thing.  We love you very much.”
Draco just nodded. “I love you so much, Harry.”
Draco just held Harry as James gave the explanation.  He already knew he wasn’t able to stay away, it’s why he was going to sneak back in.  What he didn’t know was more family history.  His father had a lot to tell him about the reason the Malfoy’s were the way they were.  Draco also knew he was going to find a retraction of the potion, letting the heir choose to carry or not.  It may take his whole life, but he felt like he was the one who was meant to.
“Please, Draco please.  I need you in me, please.”  Harry panted, bringing Draco’s lips back to his.
“She told me.  She also asked if I understood what they may contain, but I never saw them while away as it was too risky.  Severus asked her to hide them, even from Lucius, and to never bring them out unless you or Harry asked about them.  Considering he never got around to letting you know where they were, you weren’t going to ask.”
“Love, what day is it?”  he called out, slipping into the jeans.
“He’s very malnourished and has been raped repeatedly.  He may need a mind healer to get past the emotional abuse, but physically he’s healed nicely.  Albus I guess wanted him to stay as healthy as possible.”
“Now, Harry.  We all know what you did.”  Molly stated.
“Merlin, Draco...more, please….”
"How did you hide dad, though? It was war and everyone's always told me how he fought every time."
“I see...Good-bye, Molly.”
He smiled and nodded, looking at his best friend's sister. "Good. Hermione helped me figure it out, Ginny. It's not you, it's girls in general."
“I will marry when I want, to whomever I want.  It will also not be Ginny.  In fact, it won’t be a woman at all.”
“WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?”
Harry opened his eyes to see everyone looking at him.  “He knows and I let him know his daughter was alright.  I don’t think he knows how much time as passed, and I didn’t tell him who I was.  He kept saying I was gone in the dreams.”
He nodded and watched the red head lead their bookworm back to the dorm.  Theo nodded and grabbed Pansy’s hand as they turned to leave as well.  It had been a trying day for the boy in his arms, Draco knew.  He also knew he’d kill the bitch that put them in the infirmary anyway if he could get away with it.  Her oath will do that now though.  Well, that or Remus.  McGonagall wasn’t kidding about the laws and where children fell into them with a creature.  Draco sighed and kissed Harry’s hair as the boy turned to get comfortable.  Draco settled behind the boy and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, his hand resting on his boyfriend’s stomach as sleep claimed him as well.
Once getting to the pub, it was decided that no baby talk, no defect, no potion, no anything related to what they had been up to lately would be talked about.  It wasn’t just because of where they were, but because they needed to know what was happening in each other’s lives.  Hermione, for one, was interested in how Hogwarts was going and how the new year would happen.  Remus and Sirius were on a committee, but the magic of the building has been repaired quite nicely they were told.
She watched as the little girl made her way to the table where Remus’ lions now sat.
“So friends, huh?”
“If anyone can hear me, tell padfoot and moony it was wormtail.  I’m in the lost room in the unused part of the school.  A house elf just told me.  Merlin, please help me.  I need to find her before Albus hurts her.”
Pansy and Draco nodded in agreement.
“Holy mother of fuck...Harry….”  Draco called out as Harry’s finger started to stroke the hole between his cheeks.
Everyone laughed and then talked about things going on beyond Harry, bearers, and Albus Dumbledore kidnapping James Potter.
Molly will not be a favorite in the story, don't hate me.  In order for the way I wanna do the plot and for future hurdles with the boys, this has to be done.  I love Molly though, but pureblood society is about procreating, and status, in this fic.
“What?  Papa what?”  Harry asked, almost too scared to know the answer.
Remus gestured for their guests to sit and then Lucius glanced to the boys and back as Sirius came back in.
“He’s here.”
“You’re right.  That’s on me and Sirius, cub.  We knew you didn’t do anything with Ginny or Draco so we didn’t think it was an issue.  Given the fact that you never turned into a wolf upon puberty or before, we didn’t think you’d get one.  In all of our research, if a Potter was a mate for a wolf, Potter’s were the dominant trait.  We didn’t think you’d have one.  All research and belief were in the negative on it.”  Remus explained.
Hermione smiled.  “Good, now what about the notebooks.  Find anything?”
“Of course, have to get into the mood so we can have some fun.  At least we’ve been working up to sex.  I want you to know I’d do this with you even if it wasn’t because you needed me to.”
“This will be awesome. I also have some money put back from what the ministry gave us for our part in the war, so the building should be a piece of cake.”
Mum wanted me to let you guys know she wants to see you tomorrow.  She has more or less demanded it.  Like the owl, Hermione bought him for my parents.  It was the only one she had coins for at the moment since we’ve been on the run, but he’s known to be loyal.  Anyways, hope today was good for you guys and see you tomorrow.
Draco pulled Harry closer, kissing his forehead, right by the scar he was famous before, smiling as he heard the slightly smaller man sigh in contempt.  Draco knew he could use to this, even before they had to.  He knew from the few nights they fell asleep in the library while going through Severus’ notebooks.  He knew it the first time Harry kissed him, he knew it the first time he figured out he had a chance with the man in arms.  Draco rolled onto his back, taking Harry with him, sighing with the dark head laid on his chest like it was made to do it.  No talking was needed as the blonde wrapped his arm back around the other, running his thumb up and down the bicep nearest to him.  Another sigh and a push to be closer the only movement Harry made before curling his fingers and tracing lines on the torso he was laying on.
Draco let out a breath.  He was telling them today, Harry and he had talked about it.  Draco hated not telling his friends, but knew Harry had to get to know them as more than they being slytherin.
Remus nodded in agreement and the two left to get ready for their day at the Burrow.
“Don’t be.  We knew I was coming back.  I had to talk to Anna first.  She came to make sure you were alright.  Pansy and Theo know about your connection with her now, though.”  He whispered.
Sorry it's been a while, but I'm teaching and was studying to take a different certification test for teaching as well.  I'm back now, so hopefully can post more often!
She held up her index finger, letting him know she’d be counting.  He turned to the boy next to him to see the anxiety.  He smiled, trying to ease the boy into sleeping alone.  They both knew the underlining problem with Draco not sleeping in the infirmary.  He leaned down and kissed Harry’s forehead.
Harry smiled.  “I gave them my tournament winnings, that’s how they started.”
“Morning, love.”
“Wanna talk about it?”  Draco whispered.
The ginger haired man was staying with Hermione on pretense of his mother being a bitch.  They all knew he’d never tell his mother she was a bitch, but the woman knew where her son stood in regards to Harry and Draco.
He watched his sons gaze harden in protection of his chosen, protecting Harry was more important to him, Lucius knew.  He looked to his wife, who almost had the same look as their son.  He then looked at Remus, seeing the wolf daring him to deny them.  Lastly he looked at Sirius, who promised worse than the Janus Thickey ward if denied.  Lucius took his cane, held it upright, and then pushed up to stand.
Harry watched as Narcissa looked at her son a moment before calling her own elf to bring the notes from her safe in her dressing room.  She then looked back at Harry.
Nothing else was said, he just lead his boyfriend out of the house.  Draco pulled him close and then they apparated to the cottage.  Harry could still apparate till the fourth month, then the baby would have limbs and organs fully developed and it wasn’t safe.  He picked Harry up, carrying him into the living room and sitting on the couch with Harry in his lap.  They heard the pops of the others, but neither cared to see who actually followed them.  Harry stayed curled in the blonde and just let the calming heartbeat help him.  He took deep breaths, knowing he wasn’t going to see Molly Weasley anymore.  He couldn’t put himself, or his child, through that kind of judgement.  It wasn’t healthy.  No one who followed, said anything.  They just went about their business.  Draco stayed still, his lips resting in Harry’s hair and kissing his head, letting him know he was there.  He knew what that good-bye meant, they all did.  Harry wasn’t going back to that house.  Harry was done.
“No, you’re really not, Harry.  You love Ginny, you wouldn’t have dated her if you didn’t feel anything.”
“I’m nervous.”  Harry whispers.
“Off, please...off.”  he whispered, moving his hips to help him understand.
“It’s just, I thought I’d be more submissive.  With the gene and all.  I mean, in the Muggle world, submission is different than that.  If I understand it correctly anyway.”
Harry turned his head and gave Draco a quick kiss before leaving to let him do his business.  He got back to the bed and was sitting down when he noticed a person in the bed next to theirs.  James had stayed the night with them.  The care Harry felt at the gesture was surreal.  Sometimes he was in awe that his father was there, that he was able to talk to him, hug him, see him.  Never in his wildest, ok maybe that’s a stretch, in his normal dreams did Harry think he’d get to talk to his dad.
As they stepped through the floo, they noticed Narcissa and Draco standing up to greet them.  Harry for one, noticed his new friend wearing a pair of muggle jeans and had to hide the sounds he wanted to make.  The denim definitely worked for the young blonde and Harry hid a bit behind his father to hide just how much he liked them.  The older two smiled to themselves as they greeted the Malfoy’s.  Narcissa gestured for them to take seats, sitting on the loveseat herself.  Draco took to a chair while their guests all sat on the slightly larger couch.
Harry nodded.  “Alright, you may stay, Slinky.  Where is Blimpy and Jumpy?”
“I will do as  you ask.  For my son and my family.”
“It is important for Draco to be right next to Harry the next few months.  I lost a baby when Remus was gone and I will not let Harry and Draco suffer the same.  That baby needs both their magic, Poppy.  Draco has to be with Harry at all times to help Harry stay healthy.  It’s part of the defect and one reason the potion for the heir was made to begin with.  The Malfoy who created it hated his son for having a baby with a Potter, as ironic as this is.  You cannot separate them.”
Remus nodded and James left.
Sirius smiled. "He'll be fine with whichever you feel comfortable with."
The guests followed the Malfoys into the dining room, but one stopped another.  Harry looked at Draco, who was holding his wrist.
“It’s the bearer defect, gene, honor, what the hell ever.  I found it this morning in Uncle Alphard’s journal of all places.”
Harry smiled and explained the conversations he had with his friends.  Remus was quite proud of Harry for confiding in them where he could.  Hermione probably already knew it was possible, she really was like Lily.  Bearers are in a lot of books, even in the Hogwarts library.  If that girl ever saw the word mentioned, she looked into it.  Remus told Harry that, and the younger agreed.
“Pup, Draco, ms. Dumbledore?  Everything ok?”  he questioned.
Both men laughed and Draco watch his friend walk back to the common room before entering their room.  When he walked in, Harry was coming out of the bath with a towel
“Does he know?  About your uncle, Harry.  What does he know?”  Hermione asked when the subject of the dreams came up.
Harry nodded and followed the older man in to find the wolf.
Harry nodded.  “I don’t think I want to take off the glamour.  You and my dad went to great links to hide me, hide him really.  I don’t want to jeopardize that.  And if I meet a guy, I
“Yes, since we were 15, why? Moony, it’s Harry and Draco and they brought a friend.”
Everyone watched the woman as steam came from her ears.  James, Remus, and Sirius moved to give their child and his partner support.  Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville did as well. They knew it would be bad, they were just hoping Harry wouldn’t get hurt anymore than he already has by the red head.
She shook her head.  “I’m trying to find Professor Lupin’s rooms.  I think I got lost.  It’s just I haven’t been sleeping and having strange dreams.  I was hoping he and Professor Black could help.”
“What about the homes?”  Harry asked, waiting for the two men to resume their conversation.
Harry sat up, smiling.  “Thank Merlin, I really didn’t want anyone to know about those.  I wonder if Hermione and Ron got Head positions or if we’re not allowed since we’re repeating the year.”
“It’s alright, Harry.  I know you’re ok with me and Gin.  You told me after the battle.  Molly’s found us this morning, they’ve been fighting ever since.”
“Blaise has been found.  He was in the forest.  He’s a bit disoriented, but he’ll survive.  Just wanted to give you a head up.  How’s Harry?”
“Our own bath, Harry, come look.”
“I asked Slinky to go to Narcissa about speaking with her and Draco today, before tea.  I don’t want Lucius to know, but I think her and Draco need to.  She’s guarded this for years and I’m going to need Draco to decipher it.”
“Molly...Yes, we do know the pureblood way.  I had it engrained in my head the same as Sirius, Draco, and every other pureblood in the room.  I know what Remus told you the last time you upset Harry.  Lily wasn’t a pureblood, I dirtied the line you could say.  I didn’t give a fuck then and I don’t now.  She was also barren, childhood incident.  We also had an intimate relationship with both Remus and Sirius.  Something my son never needed to know.  Harry is mine, I know him like the back of my hand.  He was with me since he was conceived.  My father didn’t believe in the potion, no Potter has ever taken it.  Harry didn’t take it.  I grew Harry inside me.  I loved him from his first cell of life...the very first micro cell.  Remus is Harry’s sire.  Lily didn’t carry any baby.  Leave me and my son alone or I will tell him he never has to come back here, it’ll be his choice.”
Harry let out a breath.  “I may just let you.”
“Draco...please, please.”
They all turned to see the Weasley mother make her way through the crowd, a smile on her face.  Harry stayed close to Draco as Molly and the rest got to them, just nodding.
James looked up at him, not wanting to sit up yet.  “Why?  What’s happened?”
He cupped Harry’s face in his hands and smiled softly.  “It’s worth a shot, love.  I think we can do anything we set out mind to.”
Harry nodded.  “I will.  Stay with me?”
“I love you and your papa so much, sweet thing.  You will never have to wonder because I’m going to tell you all day every day if I have to.”  the blonde whispered, closing his eyes in a silent thought.
“That is quite enough Mr. Malfoy.  Everyone not associated with Harry Potter by means of you know is every secret, out.”  McGonagall stated as she came into the room.
“I agree with Draco.  Harry, he will want to know why.  Do you think you can tell him?”
Draco looked at him.  “Yea, you ok?”
Draco smiled and nodded, turning to walk back with him.  “That goes for you as well, y’know.”
Draco looked up at the other man and smiled.  “Yes...please do.”
Draco nodded.  “I wasn’t all that demanding either, but Harry...we may be in the future.  I know what your talking about.  Don’t forget who lived in my house.  He was a sadistic asshole and had all kinds of things he used for sex.  Thankfully, nothing on me that one time with Aunty Bella and the other guy, but still.”
Harry could sense an argument as the patriarch of the Malfoy family stood a bit taller.
“It’s alright you told them, Moony.  I’m not mad, Papa.”
“Hello, Harry.”
The young couple watch the wolf’s jaw set, but Sirius took his hand to ground him.
“Yes, but your son and Hermione killed as many pieces of him as I did.  Neville took out the piece that let me finish him.  Voldemort made seven horcruxes, Molly.  I didn’t do this alone.  I was also one and almost died because of it.  I’m not speaking, I just want to be left alone.”
“They know everything?”
As soon as the pop of that woman leaving sounded, Harry’s knees began to give out.  Draco, thanks to his seeker reflexes caught him and maneuvered them to the couch.  Harry curled into the body next to him and felt arms wrap tighter as he tried to calm himself down.  The blonde let out a breath as he closed his eyes and touched his lips to the head he was in love with.  Yes, it was love, even Draco knew that.  Lucius may have backward views on a lot of things, but Draco had always been showed love.  “It’s alright, I’m here.”  He whispered as he helped his boyfriend calm down.  The blonde liked that Harry trusted him this much, needed him this much.
“About six.  Remus and James are getting dressed.  It’s been four days, so Sunday.”  he informed them.
He opened his eyes to see Sirius kneeling in front of him.  He shook his head no and Sirius sighed.
“My turn.”  Harry whispered as he took a new rag from the side and begin his cleansing of the pale skin before him.  He took the same care with Draco that was done to him and then kissed the lips he loved so much.
James fully turned and looked at the man next to him.  He glanced at Remus, who nodded, and then back to Harry.
Draco walked a bit closer, just enough that Harry could feel the shocks between them.  He stared at Harry for a bit and then nodded.  “Can we talk after dinner?”
Ginny nodded and they all jumped when they heard a cough.  They turned to see the matriarch of the family grinning at them and Ginny hastily let go of Harry.  Neville whispered a good luck as Ginny pulled him away to greet the other two guests.  Harry stood, not sure how to act when he saw Luna walk in.  He smiled as she came up to give him a hug.
Nothing was said for a long time.  Both young men really didn’t understand the dream Harry had been having since the first night back.
First and foremost, I wanna say thank you to every single one of you fabulous people!  I have been busy with work and have it a bit of writer's block in a few chapters.  I have a rough outline, but trying to figure out where I want the plot to go next while our lovely boys advance in their relationship.  It's not a good excuse, but it is one!  I am hoping to be able to spend some time in the next few days to devote to writing so I can get back on track with this one.  I do have till chapter 21 finished though!  Now that I'm done with my rant and excuse, here's chapter 19!
Remus smiled.  “Thank you, Harry.  Wait till Hermione gets on her, though.  I want tickets for that.”
He watched as Draco’s eyes teared up a bit and he leaned forward.  Draco touched Harry’s cheek and smiled.  “I know.  I can’t just be friends either, Harry.  What will everyone say, though?”
Due to the way the situation was handled with the media, Harry was able to spend time in public with James and Annaliese without too many questions.  Anna, as they had began calling her, had many characteristics of Arianna Dumbledore that James’ part didn’t question much.  If you looked, it was easy to see the resemblance of all three people when they were out, sure; you just had to look.  They spent it mostly in Hogsmeade, but it was worth it to get to know each other.  Currently; however, Harry was alone in the 8th year common area.  His friends and Draco had class and so he used this time to read the letter Narcissa had sent him with Draco’s weekly one.
Draco sighed and conjured another blanket from one of the shirts.  “Yes, and it’s nice out.  Let’s sleep here.”
She sat back down and the elves popped the food to the tables for the feast to begin.
“Yes, Draco.  What does it matter?  Astoria is going to be your wife, you will have a heir.”
“That ok?”
“No need, Harry.”
The young men stayed in that position for a few moments before deciding to head to breakfast since they were up.  Draco pulled back just enough to grab Harry’s hand and lead him out of the now unlocked door of the classroom.  There weren’t very many up, but given it was Saturday, they weren’t surprised.  Draco let Harry sit first before taking a seat across from him so they could talk easier.  They didn’t discuss what happened in Remus and Sirius’ quarters because anyone could hear that.  Harry smiled and nodded to someone behind Draco.  The blond turned to see the little girl who was most likely a Potter and smiled as well.  She blushed and waved, walking beside another first year student.
Harry shrugged.  “I think so.  I know muggles practice that method, not that reliable though.  Both times dad couldn’t get away made babies, but they thought that since there was a time or two after me where their routine didn’t work and he didn’t carry makes it a timing thing for the gene.”
Harry nodded.  That was good.  He knew Draco would need to continue his title, but Harry wanted to continue Potter as well.
“Harry, could you help a moment.’
He then turned back to the men and watched as the blond was the first to show signs of life.  He felt the dog stop next to him and sigh.
After feeling the arms of his mate let up, Remus was at Harry’s feet.
Harry smiled and looked up to see Draco looking at him.
Dear, I hope you’re doing well.  Draco had let us know you’re a bit under the weather.  We do hope Madame Pomfrey is giving you the correct potions if you need them.  The reason I write to you in another note from my Dragon is because I wanted you to know that I reached out to my sister, Andromeda.  She is still close with Sirius and I needed some advice to help you hide some things.  She did let me know that your fathers had already reached out and she found a solution.  There is a special fabric, that while quite expensive, will be able to conceal anything it needs to.  I asked where we could obtain the fabric and have some shirts made, she told me she already gave them to your papa should you need them.  She informed me they were hers. She used them with her late Nymphadora, as she was pregnant when she was outed from the family.  She also let me know of a supplier if you wish to have different colors.  She did have some green and blue, which I think would fit you perfectly.  However, she also had some feminine colors, she told me at least.  Do let me know if you need any of the fabric.
Draco nodded to let him know he was heard and then watched as the man who fathered his heart headed back to the kitchen.  He pulled back a bit and brought Harry’s face up to look into his eyes.
“Sorry, maybe I’m more tired than I thought, papa.”
Harry smiled a bit, quite thankful Ron was taking this better than he thought he would.
Harry rolled his eyes.  “Not Luna, she’s with Rolf Scamander, Molly.  I also happened to mention blokes in that argument.”
They paused again and Harry knew they wanted him to be patient, but Harry looked down at his lap and furrowed his brow. James Potter carried him, his father was his father, but one of these men were too. It was a lot to take in. He looked back up and saw his godfather looking at him.
“We don’t know yet.  He’s been under the weather, but not seriously ill or anything.  We just figured a cold or some sort.  She could have meant that though.  Given Harry’s luck.”
Draco smiled.  “Thank you, Theo.  Really.  It means a lot to me that you would help.  Harry and sweet thing are too important to me.”
“Draco has been just as bad.  Says while he’s sleeping  Harry is calling to him, but he can’t find him.”
“Morning, Draco.”  He whispered back.
Harry sat and watched Lucius and Draco left the room, the books still held closely to his chest.  He saw the hurt look in Draco, and the determination.  Maybe they shouldn’t have talked about it like they did.  He didn’t think Draco would take it that way, not when he wanted children.  Harry knew what the marriage would represent, the heir that Draco needed still had to be a thing.  Society wouldn’t let anything other than that happen.  Sirius was looked down on for letting the Black name go like he had because he was openly in relations with a werewolf.  It also wasn’t what Remus was that was the issue, it was a pureblood name that was going to die out, no son to take it forward.
The last vault is the family vault.  In this vault is the rest of the heirlooms generations of Potter’s felt needed protection as well as the rest of the family money.  You are to gain this vault upon marriage.  Your children also have vaults, a total of three.  These are for them to use till you can set up their own vaults.  Altogether, the vaults hold multi millions in galleons, Mr. Potter.”
It was beautiful to watch him with the baby.  You could tell Harry loved being pregnant.  He was wearing a light green sweater today and it went well with his dark skin.  As the train stopped, Draco stood and then helped Harry to stand so he wouldn’t fall.  He cast a feather light charm on their things and then the men followed their friends out to greet their family.  Harry smiled as he saw his fathers, all of them, already on the platform.  He loved every one of them and James was getting over his trauma nicely.  Anna got to the trio the same time as Harry.  She was staying with the lady that helped raise her while James was going to visit her later during the break.  The lady wanted to see for herself who James was and was worried about Anna staying with them.  The family understood, of course, the woman raised their daughter.  Anna gave each new person in her life a hug and then made her way to the driver to take her home.
“I’m alright.  She ended up speeding up things with the bearer thing, but we’re working through it.”  Harry stated, pulling Draco next to him on the couch.
Ron and Harry nodded at the information and then sighed.  It was a lot, but it made sense to Harry.  His body wasn’t made to carry babies, not really.  It must be really hard on a bearer to have even one child.  He looked back up to his papa.  “So I can only have one?”
“I swear it.”
Neville smiled.  “She’s with some of her friends in seventh year.  I’m to save her a seat.  She got head girl.  McGonagall asked her not to say anything and she doesn’t know who the head boy is yet.”
Harry nodded.  “Yes, please.  All of them that specifically talk about secrets we don’t want out and some money please.  Just a bag full of galleons will do.”
“I didn’t die that night. I’ve been here this whole time.  I couldn’t hear you, I’m so sorry.”  Harry stated, his own tear making trails down his cheeks.
Remus just smiled.  “It’s alright.  I understand we gave you a lot to think on.”
“A piece of what?”
“He’s here because we let him here.  He is Harry’s boyfriend and had every right to be here, Molly.  You; however, weren’t invited.”
“Draco, I need the truth.  Have you had sex with Harry?”
Draco watched as Harry’s smile widened and leaned to meet him halfway in a kiss.  It was a short kiss as they were both exhausted, the slightly younger one a tad sore from the many rounds they had over the last few days.
“I’m scared you won’t be here.”  Harry whispered.
Harry smiled.  “Thank you Slinky.  You can go do whatever it is you do.”
He followed her outside so he could greet everyone and sat next to Fred.  The twins were exchanging prank stories with Remus and Sirius, causing everyone to laugh at the antics each group got into while at Hogwarts.  Harry missed this, the fellowship with the family.  They only thing missing was Ron, Hermione, and Draco.
"We can go, pup. If you want, it could be a way to at least be friends with him."
“How is he?  Poppy?”  Remus asked, running in with his mates behind him.
Draco just smirked and took Harry’s knees, placing them on his shoulders, letting him get just a tad deeper, causing Harry to scream.  Draco didn’t let up till Harry came, untouched, before finally letting go.  He made sure to fall next to the boy in bed with him and then took said boy into his arms.  Harry sighed and laid his head on the other’s chest, sleep claiming them in a matter of moments with smiles on their faces.
They all watched at Blaise looked over everyone, trying to figure it out.  Harry and Draco stood close, but not close enough to show they were together.  That was something Draco did on purpose and Pansy was almost between them in front of Harry.  This made Theo closer to Draco.  They saw the smirk on Blaise’s face and Pansy leaned more to Harry, silently telling him not to do anything.  Harry's nod was short to show he understood.  He knew the Slytherins he came to know where glad this one wasn’t back and that there had to be a good reason.  He was hoping to know it soon.
Draco simply nodded, no words to what he was feeling.  Harry took that to mean he wanted more and so slowly stretched the hole to let another finger in.
“Please, continue to stay if you wish to do so.  For both lunch and tea as we have enough.  For now, I must tend to the garden and leave my husband to wallow in his own self pity.”
Since they were at an impasse, Harry and Draco took Annaleise back to the Gryffindor tower before going back to their own room.  All three were quiet, but that was to be expected with the news they found out.  The girl couldn’t believe her daddy would do that to Harry’s daddy, but hopeful that everything would turn out alright in the end.  All she knew was when her daddy visited at the cottage was how special he kept saying she was, that her papa would be proud if he was still alive to see how much she had learned.  If James Potter was her papa, well...she didn’t really know what to think.  When they reached the tower, she said her thanks and the boys watched her go through the portrait before heading back to their own corridor.
“We’re going to have a baby.”  Harry whispered.
Harry nodded, and Draco answered.  “I understand.  Lucius raised me to believe in the same things he was taught.  But when I figured out I was one of the things he was against, it was hard for me.  I was ready to do the family duty, marry a witch.  After the war, I didn’t want to.  Mother knew I didn’t.  That was why she was trying to help me break the contract before I was able to.  I won’t hurt him, I’m not capable of it.”
Draco sat up and smiled at the little elf.  “Thank you, Slinky.”
“How did dad not get pregnant?  Not that Draco and I are anywhere near that.”
Harry watched as a hand came out again, remembering what Sirius told him.  It was true, he didn’t know Draco and some things wizards and witches kept close to them.  He must have taken too long because Draco was starting to move his hand back.  Harry took his hand and heard a gasp.  Looking up, he saw Draco and smiled.  “Friends.”
“Remus, Harry needs stability and a mother’s help.  He needs to see what needs to be done, for this line and for him.”
“When you’re ready, I want to know about the muggles, Harry.  In order for this to work, we’ll need full disclosure I think.  I will tell you about my past as well.  It’s just I heard rumors, and well…”  he had trailed off as Harry sat up and turned to look out the window.
The moment was interrupted by Sirius asking if they were ready to head to a great afternoon with Molly.  Harry and Remus just shook their heads, knowing the man wasn’t ever going to get along with the monarch of the Weasley clan.
“Of course, Hermione.  This is a big deal.  I would watch some of the others though.  If Blaise gets wind of this, he won’t be on your side.  His family may have fled to Italy, but he’s just as power hungry as Lucius.”  Theo stated.
“Yes, I dated your daughter.  Yes, I love her, but I’m not in love with her.  My dad liked gingers, I like blondes.  My dad liked birds, I like blokes.  I’m not my father, I never have been.  If you can’t be alright with that, I think you should leave till you can be.”
“Mkay…”  Harry agreed, already closing his eyes and letting sleep take him.
With that, he walked away.  Harry didn’t care what she said after that, he said his piece.  He didn’t want to argue with her, but he wasn’t going to be pushed into anything either.  He found a place in the garden and plopped down in the grass.  He laid back and looked up as he could hear the shouting start.  Molly apparently was blaming the two marauders for Harry turning the way he did, which Sirius of course fired back with.  He knew it probably could have been said differently, but oh well.  There’s not anything to do about it now.  He closed his eyes as the sun peeked out of the clouds and sighed.  Draco’s smile came to his mind, causing a smile to open his face.
“We found her on the way to papa’s.  She has been having dreams about Padfoot and Moony too, she just didn’t know who they were.”
Ron nodded.  “Makes sense.  We can go by and ask them.  Freddie’s still recovering from almost dying so they haven’t set up shop yet.”
“Hermione?” Ron asked.
They had a talk with Slinky yesterday about letting them cook their own meals unless they asked her specifically to.  He, for one, knew it calmed Harry down to do the muggle chore himself.  Not that Remus could blame him.  They were due at the Malfoy’s today for tea around two and Sirius was still in mind to let that family know about James and Remus’ connection to Harry being conceived.  Not that they didn’t know of James, of course, just not the truths behind it.  Sirius really thought that letting the Malfoy’s know would help his godson and Narcissa’s son.  Not that Remus didn’t, he just wanted Harry to make the decision on his own.  So much had been placed on Harry, chosen for him, and Remus wanted Harry to be able to have this one thing.  Walking into the kitchen, he sat to work on breakfast, making a big English breakfast for Harry and his mate.
Sirius turned so his full attention was on Harry.  “I get that, Harry.  At some point, you’re going to have to tell him what you feel though.  You won’t move forward, or have a chance, if you don’t.  Don’t wait too long, Harry.”
Harry furrowed his brow.  “I have a manor?”
Hermione came back and looked at the portrait.  “Harry, if he used hallow magic, you broke the wand.  It’ll have to be opened another way.”
“If he makes you this happy, then I’m quite alright with it.  I would like to meet this new Draco, the one without all the Malfoy stress.”
"Let's go home, cub." Remus whispered.
“Salazar, Harry, so good...oh fuck...Right there.”  Draco moaned as Harry scissored his fingers, finding a walnut size button in his lover.
after you.”
“Let me see your hand son.”
"Listen, I'll ask Remus if he wants to go, but you go. You deserve to at least look into it."
Draco moved his hand and placed it under his boyfriend’s face, tilting it up so he could see his yes.
Remus nodded and smiled a little.  “I can explain, Harry.  Lucius will also need to know.  The Malfoy’s need to know how to act with you and Draco.  Are you alright with it?”
Hands began to wonder and shirts came off as Draco moved them to where Harry was laying on the mattress with Draco on top of him.  Both boys were relishing in the alone time, loving the sensations running through their nerves, sitting them on fire.  Buttons on pants came next and each one sighed as they continued to get naked.
“Lavender.”
“I don’t have an owl yet, but am staying at a cottage my family owns in the little wizard community south of Wales.  Don’t be a stranger.”
Draco nodded and whispered to Harry, who nodded as well.  Both sets of parents watched as their charges went down the hall, hearing Harry tell Draco he could borrow some pajama bottoms if needed before the door shut.
The elderly lady, who’s name escaped him at the moment, came up to the young men.
"Hey pup."
“Really, love.  Theo….”
Harry finds out another part of the family secret and a once enemy finds out some truths about himself
“It’s alright dear, our guests have arrived.  Shall we have tea before dinner?  It’s not quite finished yet.”
“You got up to leave and dropped, just fainted.  I couldn’t wake you so had Draco get your godfather.”  Remus explained.
He turned back to the small girl and sighed.  “We were going there as well.  We can help you.”
Draco woke up to his lover drawing little designs on his skin with his fingers.  He smiled and leaned down to kiss Harry’s hair while he ran his fingers through the mane.  Harry sighed and continued tracing his fingers around the pale skin.  Neither said anything and given the fact that Harry hadn’t pleaded or jumped the man he was laying on, it seemed Harry’s heat was calmed.  Both young men stayed in the calm after the storm, just enjoying the other body they were tangled in.  Both boys had no clue what day it was, how long they had been in the room, or when they should leave it.  They had no clue what rumors were surrounding the fact they kept to their room.  They did know they weren’t quite ready to face it yet.
Everyone gasped as the words left her mouth.  Remus made a move, but Harry stopped him.  He walked in front of his father and closer to the woman.  Draco was watching him, but knew how important it was for Harry to fight this on his own; even if he wanted to tell that bint where to stuff her big nose.  Harry stood a foot from Molly Weasley and just stared for a moment.  He could see she wasn’t going to let up. Wasn’t going to let go of this, maybe ever, and that hurt him.
She had spoken her peace calmly, but with so much authority that it made every man in the room cower with shame and ask for forgiveness.  She then turned to the three on her couch and let out a small smile.
Draco smiled and shook his head.  “I know as much as you as I didn’t want information to get my father.  Ok, a tad more than you, but not by choice.  I also don’t wish to discuss it yet, if you’re alright with that.  But I’d be willing to experiment with you when you’re ready.”
“Why not ask Poppy?  She helped me.  I didn’t renew for obvious reasons.  You; however, would be a great Healer, Hermione.”
He had just finished when he heard a knock on the doorway.  He turned to see the blonde Slytherin leaning against the frame with his arms folded and his feet crossed.  He looked delicious in a pair of holy jeans and a dark purple shirt.  His hair was hanging loose of the gel he usually wore and Harry had to admit, he looked better this way.
Nothing was said as the door opened and the man in question walked in.  Draco smiled as his lover walked in and sat on the bed next to him.
Harry trudged up the stairs, looking for his friends, while the older men found Arthur in the living room.  Harry was hoping to talk to Hermione and Ron about his conversation with Malfoy.  He wanted them to know the blonde was hoping to make amends with them as well.  He knew warning Ron would be beneficial to him, especially if he would actually get something he wanted.  He still wasn’t quite sure about that, but couldn’t help but have a little bit of hope.  Some of the tiny signals Draco was giving, Harry couldn’t help but hope.  Narcissa and Sirius’ cryptic talk didn’t help that either.  He knocked on Ron’s door once he came upon it, not wanting to disturb anything he’d rather not see.
This is going to start getting into the part of the plot where they gene starts affecting both Harry and Draco.  Hope you like it.
“Good day, this was fun.”  Sirius stated, smirking at Molly as he walked by.
“I know.  I just miss them, love.”  the gryffindor commented.
He knew, as he traced the faint scaring where the lines came from.  He also couldn’t help the guilt as he felt lips on his head and whispers of “It’s alright.” falling from the man holding him.  Harry turned his head and started kissing the lines, showing the other just how sorry he was, but found them endearing, not repulsive.  Draco sighed as Harry showed affection to the scars he helped created.  Harry started moving towards Draco, going up till he could kiss the man under him.  Draco smiled into the kiss, happy to let Harry have a small bit of control as they welcomed the small time together.  Harry cupped his boyfriend’s face as Draco wrapped his arms around them, rolling till he was under the blonde, a small sigh leaving his lips.  Draco trailed his lips across Harry’s jaw to his lobe, nibbling just enough to get a reaction out of the man under him.
Sorry for the small hiatus but my cat knocked my computer off it's space and the screen broke.  I now have a new computer so yeah!!! Here's an update
“Sirius said the same thing, but red hair’s not my type.  Not to mention I don’t want to leave England.”  Harry stated.
Harry pulls Draco back to him and sighs.  “That works both ways.  And I get to call you my boyfriend.”
“My friends will be here any minute Lavender.  What could you possibly say to me.”
“Hold on Hermione.  How would we do that?  The money alone would be needed and I would have to get my license renewed; I highly doubt that would happen.”
“Mr. Potter.  I’m your father’s mind healer, Ms. Miller.  James, I will see you Wednesday.”
He looked at the elf.  He couldn’t speak, not really his throat was dry and achy.  Why did they say Harry Potter like he wasn’t there.  He was Harry Potter.
“Thank you for this morning.  Um, if what was said is true…”
“Aren’t you coming?”
“Then we try to keep him out of it.”  Harry stated.
“Are you James Potter?”
Harry leaned forward and patted his leg.  “She knew.  I remember hearing her and Vernon talk about how mum had some accident and wasn’t able to carry a baby.  She just didn’t know how it happened and figured the freaks figured out how to do it.  I don’t remember how old I was when they argued about it.  I just know the next day I had my cupboard and was treated like a house elf.”
Narcissa watched the exchange between her cousin and his charge and couldn’t help but notice the change in Harry Potter.  The fight didn’t leave, not really.  Not that she expected it to.  It was his eyes.  When she saw that boy yesterday, he looked so worn.  Now, he looked a small bit happy.  Something was different.
“Blame Albus, not yourself.”  Remus whispered.
Draco smiled and nodded, looking up when Poppy came back in.  He whispered his love and then walked out towards the dorm.  He was going to have to figure out how to get past the nurse.  She knew about the cloak, he’d bet his fortune on it.  That’s how smart the woman is.  He was still thinking on it when he reached the dorm entrance.  He walked through and ignored everyone, not wanting to talk.  He made it to their room and walked in to find the four best friends they had.  The four just waited for him to figure out his move and he sighed, sitting on the one chair in the room since they were on the bed.  No one said anything, but Draco was alright with that.  It was quiet for a few moments and then someone knocked on the door.  Pansy got up to get it and Anna walked in, going straight for the blonde.
Harry went first and found Narcissa sitting on a lounge, Lucius behind her.  He couldn’t see Draco, but nodded in greeting.  He moved just in time for Sirius and Remus to have their turn through.
“What’s on your mind, love?”  Draco had whispered, bringing Harr out of his thoughts.
“Hermione came to me yesterday before going to the library to meet Draco.  She asked if maybe the connection with Voldemort was why you hadn’t been having this strange connection with this person.  She also asked if we were 100 percent sure James died.  I told her yes, but she gave us a theory.”
Harry nodded.  “Can we talk real quick?  I want you guys to know before your mum, Gin.”
Harry let out a small chuckled and moaned.  “Oh me too, Draco.”
They watched as Remus’ eyes blinked, the man trying to hold in the emotion of it.
Hermione looked at Harry and nodded, letting him know it’d be ok.  Harry ran a hand through his hair and sighed.
He looked over at Narcissa, who was also silently studying him.  He blinked a bit and let a sigh leave him.
The last few days till school approached moved much to fast for Harry.  He was getting anxious about the year and didn’t know how to voice the apprehension to anyone, mostly Draco.  The two young men were in different houses, different parts of the castle.  This would have been alright, that is, if Molly bloody Weasley didn’t put her two cents into everything since the battle at Hogwarts was over.  He knew he was going to need the blonde for a lot of things, not just sleep either.  Harry and Draco had come to many compromises over the last few days.  Just as Harry was starting to recover from the intrusion of the Weasley monarch, school was going to push Harry more.
Draco smiled in thanks and they watched as Sirius closed the door.
“We agree.  We already contacted Draco’s parents and Narcissa is looking in her mother’s journals for spells that were used.  Andromeda is helping as well.  Lucius is controlling the paper already and bought them out for this purpose just Friday.  You both leave Molly to us, boys.  She won’t be a problem.”  Sirius stated.
“Molly came over last night.  Worried about us being around you.  Good thing she doesn’t know Draco’s here, Harry.  She’s gone mental.”  Hermione stated.
He quickly rolled the sleeves and then walked back to his room.  Draco was waiting patiently and kissed Harry lightly as he walked by, going to his own routine.  The bespeckled man made sure his books and things were in his trunk and then waved his wand, letting the trunk float before him.  He put it down by the door and then walked to the kitchen.  Remus and Sirius were there already, one with a cup of tea, the other with the paper.
They watched as Lavender looked at the people in the room.  She shrunk back a bit as she met the Werewolf’s eyes.
She just smiled and popped away.  Draco got up and opened the trunk, finding a pair of jeans and a tee.  Harry hadn’t seen him in muggle clothing yet, but he loved the jeans and was glad his mother thought to pack them.  After grabbing a pair of socks, he put on his outfit and went to wait on Harry.  He sat down opposite the door as he heard the shower stop, glad he made it on time.  The door opened and Harry smile made it all worth it.  Draco stood up and hugged the  man to him as they heard the floo go off, signalling their guest had arrived.  Harry pulled back and took Draco’s hand, leading the blonde to the living area and to the two people he missed greatly.  As soon as he saw them, Harry ran up to his friends, pulling them in a hug.
“James and I told him he should open a clinic so that he could just close when needed, or have a partner.  Lily was a Healer, Severus as well.”
Draco took his boyfriend’s hand in reassurance and listened to what the older man had to say.  Annaleise was holding onto the words her professor was saying.
“So mote it be.”
“I’m wet.”  Harry whispered.
“You won’t believe me but know you will see me soon. Oh, and your daughter is safe as the old man is dead now.”
People started to file in from breakfast and asked Harry how he was feeling.  Harry was happy to just sit and hang out with their friends.  It relaxed him to just be with people who didn’t care he was THE Harry Potter.
“We don’t go to bed angry.  You and I are very stubborn men.  We both know this, but I think we need communication, and a lot, for this to work.”
Harry didn’t move, just turned more into the blond holding him there.  Remus turned his worried gaze to Draco, who then asked Harry to look at his Moony.  Harry nodded and looked at Remus.
Harry couldn’t focus, all he could feel was what it was like to be in that dark room, chained to the wall.  He closes his eyes and then opened them trying to focus.  It wasn’t working and he knew that the young man beside him knew as well.  Harry sat back and closed his book, laying his quill on top of it.
“Moony...what if it's the room we found seventh year?  No listen, we found the part the kids are using that year and us three always went there for “Moony time” with James.  We always called it the lost room so no one knew, especially Peter.  Hell, I don’t even think we told Lily about it.”
Sirius looked at James, who nodded before turning to his son.
The rest of the year came in as they saw Harry Potter hit a wall by a bookshelf and fall unconscious.  Draco saw nothing but Harry as he ran to the boy he loved.  He got down and heard someone say something about someone else, not that he cared.
Remus could see the worry and fear in his other mate and hated it.  He leaned over so James could see them both and sighed.
Harry moved his hand and touched Draco on the knee, causing the man to look down at it.  Harry waited for Draco to look back at him and then smiled a bit.
Harry nodded.  He felt bad for the man he was becoming friends with.  Seeing the look in Sirius’ eyes, he was sure Sirius wished he was enough for Remus once upon a time.  If he didn’t take that potion James Potter wouldn’t have been needed by the werewolf.  He also saw it was something Remus knew as well.  He watched as the wolf took his godfather into his arms and held him.  Harry sensed it was something they don’t talk about, like at all.
“In my bed, of course.”
Harry nodded.  “You’re right.  I know you said having today for us, but…”
He watches the young elf nod, her ears flopping.  “Oh yes, the Potter’s have more than one house, Master Harry.”
“He isn’t yours, Remus.  You and Sirius need to teach him.  He’s not yours.  He’s James and Lily’s.  They are gone and a mother needs to show him, a father needs to guide him.  Arthur and I can do that.”
“Harry, Ginny sent an owl about lunch at the Burrow.  George, her, and the rest miss you.  She promised to help with Molly.”  Remus stated after everyone was finished eating.
“It was fine.  Sorry about this morning, Remus.”
“Love you.”  Draco whispered.
“I can’t tell everything, not yet.  However, you told me something personal, so I can as well.  My life wasn’t sunshine and roses, Draco.  Vernon Dursley was very abusive.  Hermione, Ron, Sirius, Remus, well...they don’t even know all of it.  Dudley, my cousin, was a bully.  That was part of why I didn’t shake your hand in first year, you reminded of him.”
Hot, that’s all Harry could feel, hot.  He could feel his skin heat up as the Professor was lecturing on the horcruxes.  At least he didn’t need the notes.  Remus had let him know that he wanted to teach on it, show the dangers of it, show how Voldemort used them and they ended up his downfall.  Don’t get him wrong,  Harry thought the lecture was going great.  Harry blinked as the sweat started to build up on his forehead.  He wiped his head and bumped his glasses, which was slowly starting to slip down his nose.  His fingers went to his tie next, loosening it and unbuttoning the top button.  He could feel Draco’s eyes on him and just sighed.  He didn’t know what was going on.
“No.  We didn’t know about the first one, cub.  By the time we did, Your father was saving Lily from an attack and was attacked himself.  It was Severus who figured out he miscarried.”
Everyone nodded and then waited so they could start planning on how to get James Potter out of whatever hell hole he was in within the castle walls.
They both blushed when they remembered Harry and Harry shrugged it off, letting them know he saw them kiss in the hall yesterday.  Their blush gotten redder, causing all of them to laugh a bit.  Harry let them know if they wanted it private, the middle of the Great Hall probably wasn’t the best place for it.  They heard Molly call for lunch and after promising not to say anything about everything, the trio headed out to eat.  When they got outside, Harry noticed Ginny and Neville were at the complete opposite end of the table from her mother.  Harry just shook his head and sat next to Remus.  Lunch was loud as ever, with so many to feed gathered around the table.  Plenty conversations going on at all times, but Harry was happy to be there.
He then sat to eat, his stomach not letting him wait on the other two men in the house.  Hearing a tap on the window, Harry waves his wand to open it, letting the owl in.  The animal dropped a letter and the prophet down, waiting on Harry to give him a treat.  Harry gave him a piece of the ham and watched as the owl flew back out.  He sat the paper down for Remus and then picked up the letter.
Harry and Hermione laughed at Draco’s question.
Harry looked at the mutt, at least he felt bad.  Turning back to Remus, he shrugged.  “We decided to try the friend thing.  He wants to apologize to Hermione and Ron too.  Somehow though, even with Charlie, I don’t think Molly will like the fact I won’t be family.  Especially if Potter’s are known for finding the ‘love of their life’ at age 11.”
Draco pulled back and saw something in the green eyes he loved.  “What?”
“He is not yours you stupid bitch.  Don’t start that crap about werewolves and whatnot either.  Remus Lupin had a human mate, they produced a human child.  Harry may be his son, but he’s not a werewolf.  They don’t get to choose their mates and it’s hard to live without them.  You have no idea what Remus has been through without Lily here and you almost took his whole reason for living without her.  If Harry never wakes up, you will be in Azkaban.  If he wakes and we find out some things, you will still be in Azkaban.  I will make sure of it.  Be glad I don’t kill you.”
Harry’s smile had gotten bigger at the suggestion and leaned to kiss Draco, deepening the kiss.  Both men moaned at the feeling of tongues dancing, the blonde’s arms tightening around Harry’s waist.  Not that Harry minded, not even a little.  He moved his hands to where his arms were around the blonde’s neck, holding him place as the kiss continued.  They both missed this too much and soon, they found themselves with Harry’s back against a wall.  Harry moaned as Draco’s hands wondered under his shirt, loving the feel of his boyfriend’s hands on his skin.  Draco didn’t wonder too far, but the snogging was worth it till air was needed.  Draco rested his forehead against the other, both panting and trying to gain some oxygen.
“HARRY!  I’M COMING, DON’T GIVE UP!  I’M NOT LEAVING, I’M COMING!”
“Boys, if you’re hungry, Moony made curry.”  James stated calmly.
“What is it?  You alright?”  Remus asked, concern in his voice.
Harry could see the concern and worry about the dog and cupped Draco’s face in his hands.
“Sirius, you first.  Slow.”
Harry nods and lets her know to just do what she would normally do, he had food well enough.  As soon as she left, Harry started to think about the conversation with the elf.  He had more homes than this one.  How many?  What about other things?  Narcissa said Sirius was at one of their summer homes.  Did every pureblood have those?  Surely not, not if the Burrow was anything to go by.  “A trip to Gringotts, probably.”  he mutters to himself as the omelets finished.  He put them on a plate and then turned to place the plates on the table for all of them.  Waving his wand,  Harry watched as some milk and orange juice made it’s way from the fridge to the table.
“Yeah..you just feel really good, love.”
Something passed in Remus' eyes, confusing him, but he knew they'd tell him tomorrow. He heard a cough and looked to see Minerva. The older woman pulled him into her arms, and he felt the tears on his head.
Draco pulled Harry into a classroom and locked the door behind, pulling the slightly younger man to him.  He didn’t say anything, but he didn’t have to.  Harry knew what he was doing and welcomed the comfort greatly.  James Potter was alive, he was here in this castle somewhere.  Harry couldn’t believe it.  His family was here, always been here.  He really hated the ex-headmaster at the thought he had to endure all that pain and abuse when his father was here being raped and tortured by that man.  Harry pulled back so he could look at his boyfriend and smiled when Draco offered a smile himself.  Harry nodded, letting the other man know he was alright and just processing.  Draco moved his hands to cup his boyfriend’s face and leaned in to give a small kiss of assurance.  Harry smiled into the kiss and welcomed it greatly, realizing how much he missed the man holding him, and told him as much.
He sat up and wrapped his arms around the green eyed man, resting his chin on the other’s shoulder.  He felt Harry take a few breaths before his body turned to look at him.
“Love you.  Hurry up, I’m hungry.”
Remus nodded and felt Sirius squeeze his hand. "Lily came. She helped us read through some of the harder books. Hermione reminds me of her, actually. Anyway, Wolves tended to mate with one who could help them procreate. It's part of being in a pack, wanting family. What we didn't understand is why my wolf chose two men. Men can't have children, or so we thought."
“Sorry, love.”  he whispered.
Sirius just looked at her and moved the cloak.  The two women gasped and the nurse went into work mode.  They watched as she took her wand out and started working on the man.  The man still hadn’t said anything, but they watched as he kept his eyes closed.  They did watch as he turned his head into Sirius’ stomach and kept a hold of Remus’ hand, clutching onto it like a lifeline.
Remus smiled.  “That was my worry as well.  That’s why we looked into it.”
Harry sat up and watched as he stroked the prostate, watching as Draco started to pull at his hair, moaning and crying in ecstasy.  Hips started to thrust as Draco started to fuck himself on Harry’s fingers, cries of “don’t stop, I’m almost there” caused Harry to add to what he was doing and took his other hand, wrapping it around Draco’s prick.  His lips were next and he slowly took Draco into his mouth and hummed around him, taking ever drop of cum that squirted into his mouth as soon as the humming started.
"Glamour and wolf protection, Harry."
“Morning, Moony.”
“Oh, thank goodness.  Thank you.”
After hearing this, Harry found Neville.  That poor man was sitting outside with the twins and didn’t look too happy.  Harry approached with caution and his friend looked up, attempting to smile.  The yelling went on, but Harry and the others were just grateful they learned to tune the monarch out long ago.  Harry let out a breath and gave his friend an apologetic look.
Pansy and Theo really didn’t know what to think watching their friend with the boy he was dating.  Seamus, and Dean weren’t that surprised.  They; however, remembered how Harry followed the blonde during their sixth year.  Draco took Harry’s hand and led him out, following their friends off the train and to a carriage.  They ended up in a carriage with Luna and Neville, the former smiling at Harry.
Hey everyone!  I am so very sorry about the delay in writing.  A lot has happened this year.  My dad passed in February and then losing two more members to this awful pandemic, I didn't feel like writing.  I am glad my creative juices are flowing once more though.  This is the beginning of the next part of the story.  Hope you like it.
HPDMHPDMHPDMHPDM
Remus smiled.  “That’s quite alright, Harry.  While there are still Death Eaters out, I wouldn’t want you too anyway.  I would be too scared for you.  We were all so frightened something would happen to James that we didn’t consider how you would take it.  Then James and I wanted to wait till you were old enough to understand.  When he died, I...well, the ministry wouldn’t let me have you.  Sirius got locked away, Lily was gone.  James and I didn’t setup any precautions for if he died and I didn’t.  I’m sorry for that, cub.  So fucking sorry you had to live with that awful woman.”
Harry moved the books, giving them to Remus, who sat them on his lap.  He then got up and walked a bit to Draco.
Remus looks at the letter and sits it aside.  “Why not.  How are you, Harry?”
“I agree and told my mate the same.”
The students nodded and then followed their teacher, Harry taking Draco’s hand again.  They all walked in silence, wanting to remember how to get back to the dorm.  Sirius was leading the students to a part of the school not used in a while, but was the only place for them to be housed for the year.  They stopped at a portrait of the founders, Sirius turning to look at the ten that followed him.
Draco’s eyes got big and tried not to let the plea affect him like it would if they were alone.  He took Harry back into his arms and looked at the wolf.
Draco continued to run his fingers through his boyfriend’s hair, watching Harry’s chest slow in breathing till he was finally relaxed and sleeping.  He knew the nurse was talking to Harry’s family, but he didn’t care what was being said.  He also knew their friend’s were in the room and the smiled softly when Hermione gently touched Harry’s hand.
“We should look at the notes.”
“Good for her, she deserves it after last year.”  Draco commented.
DREAM ENDS
Draco just smiled and lifted the comforter, inviting his boyfriend into the bed.  Harry smiled, still in boxers, and climbed next to the blond.  Neither said anything, just cuddled to into each other.  They hadn’t done much in the last week, but kiss and hold hands.  Harry wasn’t up for it, nor was Draco for that matter.  It was like they took two steps back from where they were when these dreams started taking a toll on the bespeckled man.  Draco started running his hand through Harry’s hair and smiled as he heard a sigh from the man now laying on his chest.
Remus paused again and Harry was getting more confused. He sit back up and looked at the men in front of him.
“James and I knew how hard it was for you to see us growing, as a family.   We knew that you loved both of us, just differently.  But we also knew how much you wished to be the one I was having Harry with.  Especially when we all found out about the potions and what Walburga did to you.  We talked it over with Severus and Lily and they agreed to try to figure out a way to reverse the potion so that James wouldn’t have to carry anymore, that you could give me a child so that Moony wouldn’t need the other mate.  James and I hated what it was doing to you and Lily.  Having to be together once a month because my Lycanthropy demanded it.  We both loved you and her too much to continue doing it.”
“Albus and Gillert.”
James tried to get closer to his son, but stopped when Remus grabbed his wrist and Harry cuddled more into Draco.
**Dream**
“I am, Harry.  I am.”
Ron nodded and started to eat the food piled on his plate.  No one said much else, letting two of them eat.  Harry was slowly sipping a tea and Draco wasn’t too far behind him on his.  They all looked up as the familiar noise of mail was flying through the air and watched as the Weasley’s new owl landed in front of Harry.  Harry sighed and picked it up, not really wanting to read whatever was on it.  The others watched as Harry silently opened the letter and his face said all they needed to know.  Oh sure, they didn’t know what was in the letter, but ever since the library, Molly Weasley has been trying to get her nose in Harry’s business.  Harry just sat the parchment down and let Draco take it.  The blond read it and was a bit upset.
“So they moved the relationship it seems.”
“And I you.”
Moving his head from side to side, Harry picked up his bar of soap and preceded to wash his body.  After that, he took his shampoo and lathered in his hand, massaging it to his scalp after.  When he was done, he turned the water off and reached for his towel.  Wrapping the towel around his waist, Harry stepped out and wiped the steam off the mirror so he could trim his face.  He grabbed his boxers and slipped them on before gathering his clothing and turning to head to his room.  Once in his room, he pulled out a pair of jeans and slipped them on.
Ron shrugged.  “Dunno, why don’t we go to the garden.  I had some things I was concerned with.”
That’s what really did Draco in.  He also knew it was the same for Harry.  Neither man wanted to be measured by the accomplishments and duties they didn’t have a choice in.  They both wanted someone who looked past those things.  Draco knew he looked past the scar, past the fame, especially after getting Harry to open up.  Harry’s life before Hogwarts was awful, and it hurt the blond to even think it.
Harry and Draco looked at both of Harry’s parents and then Harry nodded for Draco to answer.
He looked back to his papa.  “The man also mentions wormtail, papa.”
Both boys kissed again and then Draco let Harry lead him out for lunch and then who knows where the afternoon would take them.  All both knew was they didn’t care as long as they were together.
“About 10.  Said something about a breakthrough, not sure what that means though.”
She shook her head. "Don't. I know what you're going to say. I feel the same Harry. During the last year, well...I was scared you guys weren't coming back. Neville helped with that."
“I don’t really know, Moony.  There’s things Draco needs to know, but I don’t want to tell him till I know where I really stand.  Are the Potter’s the only bearers?  And we got a new elf, Slinky.  She says I have a lot of homes.  How did I not know this?”
Time jump for this one so the story plot can come and go.  I need to jump the ball a bit.  I don't mention the time and days since the last chapter as it isn't really needed.  The time is mentioned so you know what part of the year it is.  Just remember the boys have been together since the battle basically.  It has been months.  Draco also mentions the level of their relationship as it comes into question for the situation to make sense.  I did alter how what happens, happens.  What I mean is, I haven't heard it happening this way.  Also this is a LEMON CHAPTER, which is the reason for the explanation.  Hope you like it.
“Me too, Harry.  If you say he’s different than I can get behind it.  Try to help with Molly as well.”
Sirius had explained and then watched as everyone processed what was happening.  If he was right, those boys will have to share a bed sooner than they were ready.  Not intimately, but physically.  Neither was going to be able to sleep without the other thanks to Molly fucking Weasley speeding up the process.  Draco caught on first, as did his parents and Remus.  They all watched as Harry was still processing what it meant.  Sirius and Remus knew when their cub figured it out.  Harry started shaking his head and looking down.  He was going to blame himself, the marauder’s knew this.
“Papa, your son is Harry Potter.  Harry Potter knows, and is close friends to the new Minister of Magic.  He also happens to know that the new minister would see the benefit in showing all creatures and status’ that the ministry doesn’t support the same values as the Dark Lord Harry Potter just defeated.”
“No, Harry.  I know he did something to you.  I get Ginny cheated on you with Neville, but you were straight the last we all saw you.  I don’t know what he has over you, but you don’t have to.  His family should be in Azka….”
“He will penetrate you, son.  I know I’m your father, but you need to know that.  You’re heat, it’s instinct and I’m sorry I didn’t tell you both.  We really didn’t think you’d have it since you don’t transform.”
“What is going on?”
Harry turned to see Annaleise standing with the girl she walked in with. He nodded for her to go
Harry flinched, backing up a bit.  He felt a hand in his and looked to see Draco standing next him.  Harry nodded, backing up more to let Draco handle it since he was losing it again.  He really hated this part of the gene.
Hope everyone had a great holiday!  Mine were great but crazy busy.  Anyways, this has a lot of dialogue, but hope it set up for the next part of the story.  Hope you like it.
They had wondered before, having long sense been comfortable with skin not covered by the boxers they wore to bed.  A sigh left Harry as Draco’s lips followed his fingers down his jaw and starting down his torso.  The feelings erupting within the Gryffindor had him wanting to try again.  He moved his hands and pushed a bit, Draco getting the hint and moving his body fully on top of him.  Harry’s legs spread just enough for Draco to settle comfortably over him and a moan came out as their lips danced once again.  Tongues started to dance as Draco’s hips pushed a tad downwards.  Harry’s moan gained altitude and he pushed his hips to meet his boyfriends.  They started a dance and Harry threw his head back as Draco’s hand palmed him through his shorts.
Draco, glancing as his love, knew they’d be doing that tradition with their little bundle soon enough.  He was fine with that as it was something his family did as well.  Draco talked about how they did Christmas morning and how they waited till after brunch to open presents as friends often stayed and their parents came for the brunch, which was around lunchtime.  Sirius and James remembered that one as well since most pureblooded families did that.  Remus had a different tradition where they celebrated for eight days.  He explained his mother’s family was Jewish and so he got both holidays.  Draco didn’t understand, so they told him and Hanukkah and the Jewish tradition.
DREAM START
“How many, Draco?  Are they still alive?”
The boys got up and slipped on some jeans and tees before walking through the halls to the marauder’s quarters.  Neither said anything, just held hands as they walked.  They turned the corner and found Annaleise Dumbledore crying in the hallway.  Harry turned to Draco before letting his hand go and walking slowly to the eleven year old.
“Nothing.  She did nothing.  You and the baby are fine.”
Harry nodded and kissed his way back down to his hands, taking the tip of his lover into his mouth and sucking lightly.  He continued to suck, slowly sinking more of Draco into him; the blonde taking a bit of control back.  Draco tangled his fingers into the hair of his lover and slowly thrusted into his partner’s mouth.  This they had done, this they knew.  The anticipation of what Harry wanted to try to making the sensation all the more present.
Remus came out, wearing a robe and sitting next to his mate.  “What’s weird, Ms. Dumbledore?”
Harry nodded.  “Well, that’s good.  I would hate to do that to a kid.”
“Do not tell me where his family should be.  Lucius Malfoy worked for Dumbledore, who I think had every intention of letting them rot in hell.  Severus, while Albus was dying, took the memories needed to help his godson.  I gave them to Kingsley.  They were innocent, Lavender.  Now...as for the rumors, you think I’m a puppy.  Don’t deny, I heard you.  I also know everyone in this school has heard me call Professor Lupin my papa.  Guess what...he is.  That’s all you’re getting, you lot don’t deserve any of my life’s story.  I am a puppy, Lavender; I just don’t transform on a moon because of my damned lucky streak I guess.  I have the werewolf in me and I have a mate.  Wanna guess who that is?  Anyone?  Wanna guess why he didn’t tell his crazy ass Aunt who I was?  No...it’s because he’s my mate.  Due to the war we haven’t marked each other all the way, but we don’t have to, to know it. Remus knew about his mates, that’s right two of them, since he was eleven.  Said he always knew there was something there.  I always knew something was there and because I don’t turn into a wolf, I tend to be more submissive, like a puppy.”
It had been a few weeks since Harry told Lavender off and she pretty much kept at it.  No one would listen to the girl anymore, but that didn’t stop her from talking.  She was slowly gaining a reputation as some crazy fangirl who thinks she knows what’s good for the savior and what’s not.  No one paid her any attention.  Harry had taken to spending his morning on the weekends in Remus and Sirius’ rooms with them, James, and Annaleise.  It was time he needed.  It let him learn about himself and what was happening.  Draco used the time to spend with Theo and Pansy since he was with the Gryffindors all summer.
“Well, we could do the glamour that James and Lily used to hide you.  From what I gather though, it’d have to be someone close to you so that it doesn’t raise questions.  From what we have been told, it worked because James and Lily were already close and married.”
“First, do you and Sirius support this?  Truth would be appreciated.  If I go there, I’m going to need your help.  I thought you were both fine when you explained things to me, hell...even after.  But Sirius, you’re acting like you don’t want me to be with Draco.  This is going to get out, I don’t want a rift between us three when it does.”  Harry explained.
“Love?”
He opened the closet and saw some denim. He pulled them out and smiled, "Bellbottoms." He chuckled a bit and found an old band shirt with the name of some band he didn't know. He then went to the dresser and found some socks, no shorts or any type of underwear, but he was fine with that. Sometimes he didn't wear it anyway, especially if these fit like they did on the guys from those old shows Petunia watched, he thought as he walked out to find the shower. He found it in the room next to his and sighed. He started the water and did his business before walking under the spray. The water felt so good after being used to cold water of whatever river they found while on the run. He didn't know how long he stayed in the water, but his hair was washed twice, his body three times. He could practically feel the dirt and grime wash away. Harry turned the water off and found a towel in the small cabinet above the toilet. Wrapping it around his waist, he swiped the condensation off the mirror and picked up his wand, wanting to get some of the stubble off his face. He smiled when he started to look like himself, well a cleaner Harry anyway. He finished drying off and pulled the jeans up before pulling the tee over his head.
They both whispered as they took care to make sure both were clean and ready to get out.  Harry left Draco to do his routine after a short shave spell, going into the room.  He went to his wardrobe and took out a pair of jeans and a tee shirt.
***SMALL LEMON***
They all looked at the werewolf, trying to see how he would respond to the help he wasn’t used to getting.  Remus was a bit speechless.  He had always joked with Sirius and James about a clinic, but having Hermione wanting to do one with him...well, he didn’t really know what to say.  He looked at each individual sitting at the table with him and they him, and smiled.
“That’s what I said then they explained it while you were in your room.  I didn’t know everything yet as we needed me to heal.  Once they told me, I was very upset you didn’t know about heats.  With the bearer gene, you should’ve been prepared.”  James stated, agreeing with his son.
“Did she leave?”  He asked, sitting next to his godfather.
Harry blushed a bit, but a huge smile appeared.  He could be touched, by his love.  He could be touched, and not go into panic.  He put his hands on Draco’s neck and pulled him closer, kissing him.
Why make a sixteen year old go through that without telling him his family was going to be alright anyway? Harry didn't know what Dumbledore was thinking and was kind of angry during his "black out" or whatever it was. Dumbledore didn't explain when it was told to him either. Harry smiled a bit when his godfather and his mate found him, standing over Tonks with Andromeda. They had told him just this morning that when it was over they wanted to talk privately with him, about what he didn't know. He turned his head when someone called his name and just barely had time to keep balance as red hair invaded his sight, Ginny. That was something he was going to have to do.
"A beard, Sirius." Harry whispered.
Harry just nodded and let his friends lead him out.  No one talked as they went back into their room.  Harry shut the door and saw his friend’s still having looks of worry.  He explained the dream once again and then what he discussed with his father.
Draco held out his hand and the other young man took it, letting the other lead him out of the room.  They didn’t see anyone in the common room and with the window saw it was dark out.  Maybe early morning.  They’d know when they got to Harry's parents.  They both walked silently and finally got to the portrait that housed the marauders.
“Hey, Harry.  Just a warning, mum is going to try to get you to the burrow for Christmas.”
Harry held no room for argument and the company he was in waited to see what the monarch of the clan would say.
“You alright, Harry?”  Neville asked, seeing his friend not his usual self.
The rest of the returning students watched as the couple got up and then looked at each other.
“Molly…”
“I have already told you and Remus that Arthur and I will deal with Harry.  He needs a mother, not some gay dog and his pet werewolf.”
“What do you mean?”  Ron asked.
Harry nodded and before he could answer, Lucius came in.
“I could get used to this.”  He whispered in Harry’s ear, rocking back into him.
She puffed up against the dog and everyone could see it wouldn’t be good.
“Moony?”
“Draco…” Harry whispered.
“He’s a bearer, Pansy.”  He whispered, but knew they both heard.
The three on the couch then watched as the man turned and left.
Draco sat up and pulled Harry by the neck, plunging his tongue to meet Harrys.  Harry moaned and let Draco lead them back to a lay down position, his fingers wrapping around the hardness under him.
They let Harry process how it was needed and talked about small things.  James was interested in some of the things that went on while he was in the room.  Remus and Sirius left the real important changes for while they were alone so that James could freely break.  Harry stayed with the Marauder’s for the rest of the free period, listening to stories.  None of them realized how much time actually went by till the door opened and the final Marauder led in three very distraught students.  Draco went right to Harry, who let him pull him into his arms.  The blonde knew something was wrong the minute he knew Harry wasn’t in their room.  It was where he usually waited for Draco before going to dinner with Ron and Hermione following.  The three of them had found Remus on his way to the professor’s rooms and asked if he’d seen the missing quarter of their group.  The other’s in the room watched as Draco and Harry whispered to each other, the blonde making sure the other was alright.
Harry nodded. He could understand that. He felt the same after hashing out things with Hermione. He didn't exactly know when he started to feel for the Slytherin he always fought with, but he knew nothing was going to come out of it. He didn't even know if the blond man was gay, so why obsess over it. They both continued to eat in silence and looked up when Sirius made his way into the room, sitting next to Remus. No man talked as they ate the rest of their meal. They did let Harry know they wanted to talk after he took a shower and that the room he picked should have clothes. Old clothes mind you, but clothes. Harry just nodded and then made his way back to the room he slept in.
“Mister Remus.  My Mistress and Masters are hoping to bring young Master Draco.  Something is wrong and they don’t know what to do.”
Harry nodded.  “Thank you.  We are quite happy to be having our little bundle.”
“It’s 1998, James.  You’ve missed a lot.”
“What did I do this time?”  he whispered, letting Draco hold him.
Harry was nervous, as he should be.  The last three times he was at this place he used to think of as home, he was cornered into what he should do and how he should do it.  Dealing with Molly Weasley was all fine and dandy, but he wasn’t going to jeopardize the baby just to hear her nag about his relationships.  His dad already told him not to worry, he would take care of it.  Harry was slowly learning the pureblood way of things, so to speak.  He was grateful as he knew his dad just wanted to be with his mates and leave everything to Harry and the baby.  Draco, Harry knew was also learning, but that had been pretty much their whole lives.  That’s also why Draco’s Christmas present was nestled safely in Harry’s chest.  It was something the head of the house normally got for the heir, but Lucius gave Harry permission to give it to Draco instead.
After years of training, a person could maybe pick up a sort of sixth sense for things, like emotional ranges. Something she had learned years ago with her father. So whenever someone slipped into the darkness, she could practically taste the hatred, the violence that radiated from the stranger. She was positive she knew who the person was, but couldn't exactly pinpoint the name. She could barely pinpoint her own name. She didn't hear the steps but felt malicious intent and tried to brace for pain because it always came.
"A room on the Seventh floor. It doesn't go into specifics, but I've read about the term before. At Illvermorny, we had a class about forbidden magic, we spent a few days on it, my professor went in great detail to explain the dangers on of this magic, but he never explained how it was done. But if I remember the ingredients correctly from last year; bone, flesh, and blood." She rambled off and stopped.
"I sent a mutual friend of ours, Asteria, to talk some sense into Tom, to figure out what happened, and the last person saw anywhere near Alice's room was Lucius." Dumbledore supplied, and Asteria nearly broke right there. Her father? Her dark, corrupted father was near Ali?
"Asteria, I just...I just want to make him proud." Draco finally spoke, his voice soft and young.
"Where would they take her?" She asked the boy, and he paused, before glancing out at a window.
"He's right, Potter. We are currently in a three-way battle, between us, the Ministry and Voldemort. We don't know who is a spy for who, and we need to keep things as realistic as possible." Asteria added. "This is war, and until we can get Fudge either out of office or see sense, we have to be cautious; because right now, the Ministry and Voldemort's forces are focused on us, here at Hogwarts. Which in turn means its a two on one battle, with us with the most to lose, because this is a school with innocents. So we have to wait it out." Both boys looked at her in curiosity.
"Ah, hell." She whispered under her breath, and quickly sat up straight, flashing her darkest smirk at the witch before focusing her attention on Dumbledore, not that she'd listen, she knew what was going on. The Ministry of Magic was interfering at Hogwarts and things were going to be messy. And she wasn't sure who'd cause the biggest mess, her or the Twins.
"I'll be fine. Harry, love you have to go." Draco urged and grabbed out at Granger. "I love you, Potter. Be safe." He said, before taking off from Harry, and taking up a stance beside Remus, his wand drawn.
Draco stood proudly, his wand raised as he battled a Death Eater, he was unaware of who it was, the skeletal mask hiding their identity, but it was irrelevant to Draco, he had already gotten a slash to the back and had gotten hit with some rubble when the wards crumbled. He was annoyed at leaving the Golden Trio alone, mostly because of Harry, but he knew that it was irrational, Harry could take care of himself, as could Granger and Ronald. He fired the perfect stunning spell, finally hitting the Death Eater watching them fall as he was brutally tackled from the side as someone slammed into him. They rolled and Draco hit a wall with considerable force, he pushed the body off and raised his wand, slightly surprised to find Marcus Flint, looking furious.
"Stupefy." Watching the body drop face-first into the stone, and revealing in the crack of a broken nose. Draco walked over dropping his disillusionment charm and his transfigurations, as he flipped the Death Eater over, seeing the wizards wand, Draco stomped on it, snapping it in multiple pieces, he cast a quick binding charm and lighting a lantern attached to the pillars around him, before wakening his captive. His beady eyes widening at the sight of a furious Malfoy.
"I'm Asteria Malfoy, and I know all your dirty little secrets, Dolores. So I suggest you keep that in mind before you make your next move." Asteria whispered, giving her darkest, meanest smirk. "Because you should know, half-bloods who pretend to be purebloods, don't last long." She finished, before shouldering past the plump witch, who wore a shocked expression across her face and Asteria walked back to the library, giving a nod to Madam Prince, before entering the Restricted Section.
"Is it true, about You-Know-Who returning?" He asked, "I mean I know what the Headmaster said, but is it true?"
Draco lifted his head as the room started to clear out and Harry sagged against him in defeat. Draco offered unending support as his boyfriend, took deep breaths. Draco sighed at the weight, and let out a breath, as Harry clasped one of his hands, and kissed the inside of his wrist.
"Lemon Drops?" She asked, and the gargoyle moved, opening up the stairwell, she took their stairs two at a time, and came to the door, knocking on it gently.
"Snape wants us to write in detail how to brew the perfect Girding potion, but we can't find it in this book," Potter muttered.
"They're coming!" She shouted, and walked into the stone courtyard, and watching her wand clutched tightly in her hand. She could see them all, masks off, and Hagrid was chained, sobbing loudly, with something held in his hands.
"A spoiled brat? That's a good one." Asteria let out a humorless chuckle. "But I am protecting these 'children'" she responded.
"None of this is Harry's fault, it will never be his fault. It is Albus' for not dealing with You-Know-Who all those years ago. He defeated Grindlewald, he would deal with a strickling like You-Know-Who, it should've never been dropped onto Harry's shoulder, no matter what any prophecy said." Draco added, finally stopping his tirade.
"Probably not, McGonagall offered me a teaching position as well. Apparently, Hagrid wants to leave to travel some, and she needs a new Care of Magical Creatures professor." He supplied, kissing Asteria's shoulder softly, as she released the tension.
"No ma'am, I wouldn't risk scaring my lovely face for a dragon egg." She chuckled, and Potter followed. Dumbledore entered, and gave both her and Potter approving smiles.
"Oh hell." She muttered, before taking off before anyone could grab her.
"I suppose you aren't exactly giving me a choice, are you?" She smiled, as she stepped closer to him and the cup, and he grinned at her.
"I need 3 sets of Seventh-year books, 2 sets for the fifth year, and one for the fourth year, can you do that?" Asteria asked, "And can you do it quietly?" She added, placing a little pouch of galleons on the counter, and he nodded quickly, bustling around, and pulled out 6 large stacks of books, tied together with rope.
"No, my sister. You slept the perfect amount of time." Draco whispered as his laughter subsided.
"SILENCE!" Voldemort announced, and the pained noises stopped, and Asteria retreated into her head, ignoring everything the megalomanic said. She felt something pass through her and glanced around, her heart skipping in her chest. Even Voldemort froze. A ghost had appeared, stepping near her, and glancing at her. The ghostly eyes proud as it glanced at the enemy.
Asteria grabbed her cloak, and put her wand into the side of her boots, and tossed her hood on, to hide her face. She followed her cousin out the door and apparated directly outside of the Leaky Cauldron. Asteria refocused her hood, and walked directly towards Flourish and Blotts, the haul would be big and pricey, but she didn't mind, although Molly would be furious, when she realizes that Asteria slipped out before checking with her, for money. Asteria intended to buy everything; firstly, because the Weasley's deserved it, and two, they had enough to deal with. She had enough money to afford all the books 500 times over, so it wouldn't hurt her. She had learned a few months with the Weasley's, that they were a proud bunch, and they were incredibly caring. Asteria walked towards the desk, and the bookkeeper's eyes widened at her face.
"She kicked us out the first two nights, but finally let us stay." Potter supplied.
"Ah, Asteria are you still behaving like a spoiled brat and protecting these children?" Lucius asked, eyeing her, as Bellatrix stepped forward.
"Sod off, Lupin," Draco responded, giving out a malice aura.
"And Mr. Weasley, I've heard many things about you and your family," she supplied, turning to face the group, "It is a pleasure to finally meet you and the others who have given my spoiled brother such a hard time. She said with a laugh, before turning to face her very angry father, amused mother, and offended brother. "Now, father, may we get to our seats, it looks like the match is ready to begin." She began to walk away, towards where their seats were, giving no room for arguments.
"Did you have fun torturing my sister?" Draco growled, kneeling close to Rowle's face. "I should kill you, just on principle, but you aren't worth getting blood on my hands. So you'll be treated to the same as the rest of my enemies." Draco finished, casting his imprisonment curse, and following the same ritual-like behavior of pulling out his quill and signing his name on Rowle's chest. Draco stood to his full height and pulled off his cloak, walking to his sister, he undid her chains and watched her flinch at the sensation. He released the muffling charm around her ears and dropped the cloak on her skinny shoulders.
"I am Asteria Malfoy. The eldest Malfoy." She said, placing her best dazzling smile, causing Fudge to laugh, and Arthur to just stare.
On May 16th, it finally happened, Bill came flying outside where Asteria, Draco, and Charlie were training, his face red and his breathing hard. Just by the frantic look on his face, they could all tell what he was going to say.
It would be a week before Asteria could walk on her own, but in that week, she sat with the Trio as they told her what they were doing. Hunting Horcruxes and hiding in woods and dangerously attempting to destroy them as well. They'd known of two that had been destroyed, a diary from their second year and a ring that Albus destroyed before he'd died. They'd destroyed one just before being captured by the Snatchers, and taken to Malfoy Manor. Asteria and Draco have both shuddered as they recounted their time there, the death of Dobby and Pettigrew had shocked Asteria, but she took it in stride, feeling her heartbreak as they told her how her mother had attempted to assist them, without putting herself in danger.
"You wretched little brat, you just aided in the escape of a dangerous creature!" Umbridge nearly hollered.
She couldn't let herself forget who she was. She was Asteria Malfoy, and she wouldn't lose her mind in this desolate place.
"Alice, what the bloody hell are you doing here?" She seemed shocked at the slender redhead, as she pulled up a chair.
"None taken, Malfoy." He replied, his shoulders sagged as he leaned against a pillar.
"I didn't say I don't miss you, Charlie." She began, glancing around, "But if my father hears of this, he will make my life hell."
Draco had sat in the same spot for 9 hours, his backside was numb, and he was tired enough to crash exactly where he was, but had resisted the impulse. His eyes had long since adjusted to the darkness in the windowless room, and he had kept the disillusionment charm on his person, and let himself become slightly distracted by his thoughts. Shunpike obviously had a second location, as his sister wasn't here. And there was no guarantee that Stunpike hadn't already killed her. Draco hated the dark area of his thoughts that knew he'd kill Stunpike for hurting his sister. And he wondered if Harry would understand that. Probably not, Harry was all that was good and pure in the world, just by being himself. He was kind and gentle, even when the world wasn't kind to him. Draco was fully aware that Harry deserved someone better than him.
"I love you, Charlie." She whispered and he kissed her cheek."
"There are wards placed in the necklace that will help protect you from your father." Alice's voice lost its teasing manner, and took a more serious tone, as did her face. "How bad was it when you returned?" She asked, and Asteria leaned back and let out a breath.
"Because I am a woman, I won't be the Heir, you will be. I need to prove myself worthy so father can marry me off to some monster." She responded, and rolled her shoulders.
"Sadly, I do." Dumbledore leaned back. "Ms. Black, I know this may sound strange, but I need this conversation to stay between us for the moment. Until the information is certain, until we have all the facts, we can't let this information reach the wrong people in this instance."
"What's that Hagrid's holding?" Charlie asked coming up behind her, and she flinched, looking at the ground. She suddenly had the sinking feeling as to what it was. Or rather, who it was.
"We need to go to Hogwarts now, it's time." His voice wavered, but they moved. Asteria quick on her feet slammed her boots on her feet and gathered with everyone.
"That guy probably feels too much when it comes to all this."
"I'm sorry about Hedwig, I know how much that owl meant to you." He replied, pressing a soft kiss to Harry's chest. "I don't know what to say about the wand, I don't know enough about them. But that's irrelevant, do you think you'll be safe here without Moody?"
"I'm sorry, Headmistress, I didn't want to hurt her. Father still thinks he can save her from Dumbledores influence." Draco pleaded using his Malfoy charm. The woman nodded and looked back at Potter who was sitting in her chair. Things happened quickly, with Snape entering and looking puzzled at Potter shouting weird phrases.
With the end of March, she could feel the crisp weather slowly beginning to warm. She kept her hood off as she stared at the ocean. She shrugged off her black cloak and used it to sit on, as she kicked off her boots. She'd burned down her home, and now she had to prepare for a coming battle. She knew the Trio was still hunting Horcruxes and Draco was hunting the Snatchers and Death Eaters, while she was essentially stuck. He'd made her promise not to get involved, and she hadn't. She was focused on training and trying to figure out what she was going to do.
He forced his thoughts to halt, forcing himself to remember that no matter what side he was on, this was war, and taking them out of commission was a smart choice and he wasn't killing anyone. Dolohov wouldn't feel any physical pain, and would just be stuck in his own thoughts. Draco laid on the cold floor, staring at the ceiling as his breathing slowed. Using that spell was his best option and it gave him the best chance to save Harry if Death Eater numbers went precariously down. He closed his eyes, and let his exhaustion take him, as he lay on the floor and the sun rose in the windows.
"Charlie?!?" She stumbled in shock. She couldn't believe her eyes.
"Thestrals." Potter finalized looking behind him, and Lovegood nodded.
"Not super bad, but it would probably help if I stopped picking fights with him at every chance. Did you hear about what happened at the Quidditch cup?" Alice nodded, "He was apart of the cloaked figures stringing up Muggle-borns, and he has his hands in something dangerous right now."
"I found no evidence he had been involved." Draco replied, "Stan Shunpike was who had originally taken Asteria, he, however, died over the summer, and Rowle had taken over the position. From what I gathered from Rowle's memories. She never really spoke, she didn't make any noises during her entire confinement. He was running out of ideas on how to get answers out of her. Rowle had decided that if he couldn't get her to talk, he would call on You-Know-Who to perform Legilimency on her, but Rowle couldn't get into her head."
"Draco, what on Earth?" Lupin asked and Draco rolled his eyes.
"I told you, father, it was going to take me a moment to return. Your inability to be reasonable isn't my fault." Asteria replied with a delicate duck as her father swung his cane at her. She had learned many years ago how to avoid his cane.
"Your idiot brother Ronald has run away from Harry and Hermione abandoning them in their mission," Draco muttered under his breath as he flinched, flexing his hand and walking to the sink.
"He's gone." Draco supplied, and Remus looked at him.
"I believe you both, and I'll make sure my house and others stay in line." He added.
"But I know whether you need me or not, I need you. I love you. And when this is all over, and we are faced with the future free of Voldemort, that I'll be there if you want me to be. I will always be there because I can't even fathom going back to being nothing with you." Draco stopped finally catching his breath and hating himself as he realized what he said.
"Yeah, I think so." He responded.
Well, that was simple. Draco bemused to himself, as he cautiously stood, his knees popping slightly as he straightened them out. He winced at the noise, hoping the sound didn't wake the sleeping figure. Draco inched closer, his mind reeling, as he took in the face. It wasn't Stunpike, but Antonin Dolohov. Something dark pulled into the pit of Draco's stomach. It was supposed to be Stunpike in the bed, not the idiot Dolohov. The older wizard must have gotten out of Azkaban again, which likely meant that his father had as well. Hiding out away from the world had stunted his ability to gather other information. Draco let his mind turn over the thought that it was likely that Lucius would torture Asteria, especially to regain Voldemort's favor. Draco rolled his shoulders, casting a full Body-Bind on the prime figure, and shook him awake. The beady eyes snapped open, focusing on Draco.
After making sure he was on the dock, she climbed using the old ladder to get herself up, before letting the water return back to normal. Still dry, she knelt near her brother, and with a quick wave of her wand, dried his robes, just as he woke. She helped him stand, dropping a blanket on him, she paid no mind to those around her, the gapping look on Karkaroff's face or the pride in Dumbledore's.
The fact that she had never picked up on who he was, who he was connected too. Not that they ever spoke about their last names, they'd never even told each other. She knew he had siblings, but he was never specific, he never went into detail. He just said he had a few, even she had mentioned having a brother, but once again, never went into detail. Asteria sighed as she thought back. She'd been so happy, in America, but now her life had taken a bad turn. Involved in a dangerous tournament, fighting with her father, and completely lost.
"Riddikulus," she muttered and ran past it as a new shape took form. And paused as she burst through a clearing, stumbling as she saw the Triwizard Cup, glowing slightly blue. "Blimey." She whispered stepping closer, before pausing, as Potter came forward, wand raised, a red flash flew beside her and she jerked to the side spinning around, watching a spider fall, and she spun back, wand raised, as she shouts a stunning spell behind Potter, knocking down another giant spider fall.
"You were technically bait, for the second task. Don't worry, it's already been completed. We are just waiting for the other champions to complete the task as well." Asteria supplied.
"We had to start hiding to avoid their punishments and things like that. It's been difficult, but so far we've been good." He finished and she nodded before looking at Harry, who was sheepishly facing the crowd of students and Order members.
"Fleur..." She whispered, before moving towards the right, and she paused at the sight of Krum, who had his eyes on her. "Ah, bloody hell." She muttered, her wand up, when she took note of his face, blank and empty.
"When Voldemort came to Hogwarts, he was living in a muggle orphanage, his mother died giving birth to him on the front steps before dying. Named Tom after his father, and Marvolo after her own, with Riddle from his father. When there was a death in the school when the Chamber was opened, I was the Head of Transfiguration at the time, and I had my suspicions about Tom." Dumbledore paused. "You see, Ms. Black, I was the professor sent to inform the eleven-year-old Tom that he was a wizard. We usually only do it for Muggle-borns. We sent Hagrid to collect Harry when the time came as well. So I had traveled to London, to Wool's Orphanage, to tell a little boy he was special, but he already knew it. He already knew he was different. I was a bit unsettled but figured it would all be okay once he was in a place where he was with others like himself.
"Ms. Black, what in Merlin's name happened?" The healer asked, and Asteria couldn't resist letting out a desperate laugh.
"No, Mr. Weasley." Umbridge said with a sneer, "there isn't a reason for it."
"Longbottom, what the bloody hell has been going on?" She asked, keeping her voice low.
"From the moment I stepped foot in Hogwarts, my every step had to be calculated, because Lucius had his spies watching me. Parkinson, Goyle, Crabbe, and Zabini are in no way my friends or confidants, they watch my every move and report everything to Lucius; who was concerned that I would take the same rebellious nature of my sister." He paused and glanced at Asteria. "If I didn't react to something in a specific way or make life difficult for all of you, I would have to face punishment, that Asteria usually took the brunt of when she returned home. I hated to see her hurt so I followed orders.
"Our father is a pathetic, excuse of a man and an even worse father." Asteria supplied. "Draco, you are my little brother, and I love you so much. But I can't believe you would let father warp you so much. You are so much better then he is. I don't want his life for you, and I will do what I must to make sure it doesn't happen. Don't look at me like that, Draco." She said, her anger leaving, making her feel exhausted.
"Do you know who took her?"
"Now, in the heat of dueling or even battle, the faster draw is usually the winner. I got my spell out barely a millisecond out before Potter, but it was just enough to deem me the winner." She explained, "But also, preparation; I knew the spell coming for me, but you won't always. A lot of the time, in dueling wordless magic is necessary, as to keep your opponent on their toes." She finished, and Potter nodded in agreement.
"Harry, go. Get to Granger and Weasley." Draco urged, pressing a fierce kiss to his lips.
Draco laid back on Asteria's bed, and looked at the ceiling, and thought over the things he knew. His father had been in Azkaban during the battle at Hogwarts in June, so he wasn't the one who did it, Bellatrix had been up in the Astronomy tower, which meant it hadn't been her. He went over the mental list of Death Eaters involved; Snape, Bellatrix, Yaxley, Greyback, the Carrow siblings, Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, Rowle, Gibbon, and Selwyn.
" Veritaserum." Yaxley groaned out. "You couldn't have possibly brewed it."
It wasn't long after, when the Headmaster dismissed the chattering students to their common rooms, and Asteria flinched inwardly, she had hated the Slytherin Common Rooms in her first year, and she doubted that had changed, her old dorms had been welcoming in the sunlight. She followed behind her housemates, ignoring her brother's ranting ahead of her. He put on a good face in public, living up to the Malfoy name. But she knew what he really wanted, and it was the same as her...They both wanted freedom. Once inside the common room, she retired quickly to her room, changing quickly, and laying down, staring at the canopy of her bed. Silk sheets felt cool on her skin, and she wanted to scream, she could see her fathers hand in that. Probably gave them to every bed in the Slytherin common room, and she once again felt the rage at her father boil her blood, but she shut her eyes, attempting at shutting down the thoughts. Tomorrow was a new day, she'd receive her schedule, and be on her way to blending into the background until it came time to put her name in for the tournament.
The pain was unbearable, and her hand reached up, clutching the necklace around her neck, ripping the chain from her neck, a lashing of pain shot up her neck as the metal cut her flesh, and she realized her voice had stopped, but the sobs were breaking the silence that was meant to surround Hogwarts, she couldn't hold them back as she struggled to breathe. Her hand fisting the charm in her hand. Worst then the loss was the guilt, the guilt was ripping apart her insides trying to make itself visible, it was her fault. It was Asteria's fault, it was always her fault. She caused pain everywhere she went. She was nothing but a bother. She was agony and destruction, and she tilted her head up to the sky, and screamed again, this time feeling the knot in her chest tightening even further around her soul. She couldn't stop this pain, she couldn't. Alice Jones had been a bright light for a scared little 12 years old, she had been loyal to fault, she had been friendly and brutally honest. She had been everything Asteria had ever wanted to be, but could never compare too. And Asteria caused the death of the purest, kindest soul she had ever met. Her screaming slowed until it was nothing but babbles.
"Yes, Mr...?"
"Yes." Dumbledore looked thoughtful as he stood and walked to a portrait, and spoke to it. They waited in silence as the previous headmaster disappeared, and Asteria stood in silence keeping to the back of the classroom. She didn't know what was going on at this point, and she was a bit concerned as to what it was, as she leaned against the wall beside the door, going unnoticed, by the group. Something bad had happened, or Potter just had a horrifying nightmare, however, she doubts Potter would react as such for a bad dream. Asteria took a quiet breath, running a hand through her messy hair, wishing she had brushed it this morning before heading to the library. Dumbledore straightened and spoke quietly with the portrait, and moved to another, and to, all the Weasley's obvious restraint, everyone remained silent while he spoke. And he turned, facing everyone in the room, his eyes finding her, he didn't show any indication of her presence.
"They tortured me, constantly. I never saw or heard anything. I knew by instinct when one of them came in, I could feel the rage they carried." She began softly, aware that someone was standing by the door. "They probed at my mind, trying to get my secrets and Order secrets. I could feel everything, but I was able to separate myself from the pain, it's probably what kept me sane. I imagined a place like this, peaceful and quiet. With you, Harry, and Charlie." She said as tears filled her eyes. "I was horrified by the idea of never seeing any of you again. Not seeing you, Harry, Hermione, Charlie, the Weasley's, mum. I dreamed of it all." She whispered, and let out a breath.
"No, I aided in the escape of an innocent man, away from a dangerous witch," Asteria responded, and checked on McGonagall, who shockingly was still breathing, she let out a breath of relief. "But you have angered an even more dangerous witch in the process. All of you, know this, I have seen your faces. If you do not remove yourselves from my school, you won't get another chance at it. I know you, and your families and they will suffer for your insolence." Asteria stated, letting her cold, gray eyes connect with each of their faces, leaving Umbridge for last.
"Asteria?" Molly's voice was already angry, and Asteria squared her shoulders, and set her bag down, turning to face the woman, who stood her arms on her hips, but her children, including Potter and Granger, stood behind her, and Asteria grabbed the bag and plastered a smile on her face.
Enjoy <3
"You sicken me, Lucius." She responded, and let him walk away from her. "Bastard." She whispered, before putting her head in her arms.
"Oh, my sweet, young Harry Potter." She murmured as she ran her hand in his unruly, black hair. She rubbed his back as he cried in her lap. Asteria looked down at the young boy in her lap, feeling the pain in his body. He had lost so much, too much for someone of his age. Not even 18 years old, and tossed into a war that shouldn't be his problem. She could understand Draco's anger from earlier.
"Yes, Harry, Ronald and Hermione, Griphook and the lovely Dobby." Draco looked at her confused. Another sound echoed over the ocean, and suddenly there they were. A goblin was clutching Weasley's hand, even though his other hand was wrapped around a weak Granger. Draco rushed over and helped Weasley.
So her first class was Umbridge, but she had a free period before dinner, which was beneficial. But nonetheless, her first and earliest class was with the Ministry's little spy, and she had to try not to kill her, luckily, it was with Gryffindor, so maybe the Twins could take some of the heat. Asteria glanced at her watch, and let out a groan, before grabbing her bag and heading to DADA, she was likely to commit murder today. She silently slid into the classroom, taking a seat in the back, and slouched down as low as she could, as others trickled in, and Umbridge made her appearance.
Having asked Potter and Ron about the chamber, she knew they hadn't really explored the location, so turning to the right, she walked towards the statue and letting her fingers brush the stone, slipping past it down a tunnel. Lifting her wand and casting a quick Lumos, she inched her way down the dark, curiosity eating at her insides. Trying to be cautious where she planted her booted feet, she came to a dead end, which seemed odd, it made more sense if the tunnels connected with each other. Stepping closer to the stone, she eased her wand around the wall and was surprised to see a seam that wrapped around the stone. She lifted her wand, letting the lighting charm fall, and angled the wand, and cast her language charm, and the stone shimmers and vanished.
"She'd never expect you to hide here." Ron offered, and Asteria let out a breath.
"Sia, what's this all about?" Molly asked, eyeing her brother suspiciously.
"You know, I have this very clear memory from when I was a child, its one of the only one I still have. I had snuck out of bed to get a glass of milk, and I heard the back door open, I hid behind a pillar, a better choice than facing your wrath back then." She chuckled, "And in you walked, wearing this black robe, like smoke and a white, skull-like mask that gave me nightmares for years afterward." She finished, finally looking upwards at her father, taking in his astounded look. "So I repeat, Father, did you have fun tonight? Playing with your pathetic Death Eater friends?" She growled, the anger finally making its mark. Her father couldn't help himself, and the trademark smirk graced his face.
