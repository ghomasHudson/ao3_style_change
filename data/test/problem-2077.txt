"Oh, right of course. Your bedroom is more impressionistic." Hermione offered, looking proud, but distraught, maybe proudly distraught.
Malfoy is an opulent bastard that likes nice things. Harry does not begrudge him his nice things, so he tries not to say anything when Malfoy disses his possessions.
"Why don't you use rubber bands to put your hair up?" Potter mutters softly, to not wake Draco up if he is already asleep, sleep between them, well it is precious.
Draco a kiss on Harry’s cheek and said, as if it was any other day “How was the workshop, did the spell you were working on work?”
"Never mind, let's dance!" And so Harry led his best friends (after snagging Ron from a conversation with a fit-looking coworker of his) and headed for the dance floor of the newest magical club in London, where it is too loud to talk.
“Ah yes, explanations. I am in love with Harry Potter, and as such, I am afraid there is just no getting rid of me. Now allow me to go put some clothes on and then we can have a proper sit down about this.”
'You're too good, you're golden and I feel like it will paralyze me," Draco says, through a new round of tears, but these are lovely tears.
“Harry we have the best new-- Oh! You’re not Harry,” Hermione had started talking before taking in the statuesque view of Draco, in his opulence on a beautiful baroque lounge chaise, reading a beautiful looking book.
Ron burst into a fit of laughter, his anxiety forgotten. Harry handed Draco the pumpkin juice with a wink and a grin. He loved that Ron and Draco were so accepting of each other.
Pansy feigned a look of astonishment.  “A hag, Draco?  See if I ever help you attain a sex life again.” She squealed and ducked when Draco threw a festive green dildo at her.
Harry obediently pulled his wings closer to his body. He was too tired to protest, so he nuzzled into Draco's shoulder and breathed in the familiar comforting smell that lingered on Draco's clothing and wings. It smelled like sandalwood and something sweet. Draco always smelled heavenly. "You smell so good," Harry muttered as they made it to Harry's room.
“Well, light of my life, if I knew you would have let me get away with killing your best friend so easily, I might have considered it.”
“Draco, dear, someone has tracked mud in your house, are you disposing of their body now?” Came a shouted question from outside the room and down the hallway.
“Astute observation, I would expect no less from the brightest of our age,” Draco said, it was wistful and amused not mean.
Draco nuzzles against Harry and agrees. If Harry knew that Draco felt so strongly about the chair he never would have even attempted to pick it himself.
This is when Harry decides to enter, Draco isn’t surprised he didn’t stay too long at the workshop, he probably had just one new spell to try out, and it was a Saturday.
“It is past time they know, and I am doing really well so far, I think they really like me,” Draco said, loud enough for their audience to hear.
“What! That’s amazing! I don’t even know you guys were trying… To be clear I am still upset, okay?” Harry hugs Hermione and Ron fiercely.
“It was purely for professional purposes, we are both curse breakers,” Harry says, now dishonest. How was he to explain their intellectual debates about things that were completely illegal.
“I am a wee bit confused, Malfoy, what are you doing here? I mean you definitely look like you belong but--”
"Potter!" The shout comes from the ensuite bathroom attached to his bedroom. Steam billows out of the cracked door. "What is the thread count in these robes? They are horrifying! Invest in your comfort, you have the money Lord Potter-Black!"
Harry brushes his thumb over the corner of Malfoy's lip, before pushing his thumb into that taunting mouth.
The next time Harry is out, getting fitted for robes for a ball that 'requires' his presence, he enquires about silk robes with heating charms. When the robes arrive by owl the next day he feels embarrassed for spending so much money on something for Malfoy. This embarrassment is washed away when the poncey bastard slinks out of the bathroom the following week, wrapped in a silver, silk robe with a dragon emblem on, and elegantly drops to his knees.
The next time Draco finds himself with his hair being brushed like a princess by the nation Chosen One, Potter has a white hairband around his wrist, and Draco doesn't argue when Potter plats his platinum hair and finishes it with the hairband. The next day Draco has mildly wavy hair, and it makes him smile when no one is looking.
“Right, so you should definitely bring him to Sunday's meal okay? I can’t wait to see everyone’s face.”
These are Draco’s favorite times, reading with Harry, his boyfriend. Harry’s attention can get fractured and impatient if he doesn’t grasp a magical concept, so sometimes Draco will read something out loud to him, over and over, until he gets it. They drink expensive muggle wine, listen to old muggle records, and have meaningful discourse on magical theory, something Harry had always told himself he wasn’t smart enough for, but Draco reversed this thought, as they discusses innovative spells for curse breaking, the area in which they both specialized, though in slightly different ways. Harry was given objects and told to make them safe, as they could not be destroyed outright, and just storing them was dangerous. He labored over an object, liking the puzzle and the challenge, and stripped the layers of magic back. It isn’t what people thought he would do, but he honestly doesn’t care. Draco does fixed points of curses, so buildings and things too big to be taken back to Harry’s workshop. This small overlap in their fields of work is how they reconciled, and became what they are now. The only downside is that Draco gets pulled away from Harry at odd times, like right now.
Ron and Hermione are over for brunch, which then turned into tea, which will probably turn to dinner.
“Let me get this straight, you Harry James Potter, were having a night in and reading? Was this a date? What were you reading?”
Now, Draco was snogging Harry Potter, the man that had charmed his friends, and knew what he needed to do. He needed to make nice with Granger and Weasley so that they could all lead a charmed life where they pretended they never wanted to kill each other because he had fallen in love with their best friend. The opportunity came way sooner than expected when Harry left to his workshop and Draco stayed home, he basically lived with Harry, though the manor was his home, and he loved it, Harry and him had talked about turning it into some sort summer school for muggle born students to go to before Hogwarts, and also a magical orphanage year round. He would need to hire staff and get it kid proofed, and so many other things that it started to give him a headache. He was in their favorite study, the baroque one, reading about structures of wizarding governments around the world, in his silver silk robe, with his hair tied up in a neat bun that Harry had put there, along with a couple of hickeys, decorating Draco’s pale skin, sipping tea, when he heard voices, coming toward him. He grabbed his wand, but he already knew he wasn’t going to use it. Because you really must make a good impression on the love of your life’s closest friends.
Draco Malfoy has been overall resistant to muggle technology but having a lover (or whatever the thing that has been going on with them is) that grew up in the muggle world sometimes makes this hard. The brute likes to take fistfuls of his hair and yank during sex, which is a good idea in the moment but leads to very unfortunate knotting of the hair later. Draco is convinced that he does this on purpose because he also takes great joy in delicate and painstakingly brushing, Draco lying on his chest in a half propped up position. Draco's hair reaches past his shoulder and he suspects Potter is more than a little obsessed. Draco has stopped complaining that he could just use a spell because he likes the feeling of being taken care of, especially after Potter still fucks him like he hates Draco's guts, literally. And of course, Draco loves the sex, but lying on a strong warm chest, well Draco has always been a heat-seeking creature.
Harry looks up sharply, his mind catching up to his mouth. Hermione is already looking at him strangely.
At his rapid approach, Harry turns his way with an easy warm smile, which crumples upon seeing Draco's now wet face.
“Okay, I see I guess,” Hermione looks like she has all the pieces to a puzzle but doesn’t know what the picture on the box looks like.
After that it only gets worse, Potter will wear 'scrunchies' on his wrist and tie Draco's hair up whenever he gets the chance. In the kitchen, when Draco trying to show him the proper way to make a French tart, Potter pressed against him, pushing Draco's front into the counter, ghosting his big, strong, capable hands up Draco's sides, his neck, and then fast as a devil, twisting his hair into a knot on the top of his head with a velvet green monstrosity.
“Ahem, well I’m glad I don’t have to spell it out for you two,” Draco Malfoy says, reappearing fully clothed in an expensive tailored suit reminiscent of waist coats.
"It's a chaise in the, um, baroque style," his throat feels dry, he swallows and continues. "The room, the green parlor is a baroque room, the purple parlor on the third floor is an Edwardian Era room, they were built at different times and the house can sometimes reject magical furniture if it doesn't have the period appropriate spells." Jesus Harry had just word vomited a Draco tirade he hadn't realized he had been paying attention to.
Draco finally pulls himself out of bed, Harry's bed, and looks around the room he helped decorate. He picked his favorite impressionists from the Black art collection for Harry's room, the light, the flowers, the hope. It makes Draco sad that there aren't any impressionism paintings with people that look like Harry, beautiful dark skin, hair, and emerald eyes, that no one would have painted them together, in a marketplace, Draco looking soft for the first time in his life, and Harry holding flowers for Draco. Fuck, Draco could never recover from Harry deciding that he needs a proper lover, a woman, a ginger, a non Ex-Death Eater. His eyes fill, stupidly, and he puts on the silk robe Harry got just for him, reaches up to undo the intricate braid that Harry did, putting the scrunchie on his wrist. That makes his eyes fill more. It's just because it's Sunday, a day where Harry will spend time with his family, the Weasleys, usually Andromeda Tonks, and Teddy Lupin. His father is in Azkaban, his mother is in France. His friends are all far away, and they only get together every third month.
"My family would want me to be where I am most needed, and if that is with you, then so be it. You are not having 'just a moment' your feelings are valid, and they mean so much to me. Do you hear me?" Harry reaches out and cups Draco's flushed face.
Draco Malfoy is in stupid bloody love with Harry Potter, there is just no way around it. Two months ago, Draco invited him along to Snake Club (coined after Pansy came back from America having watched Fight Club) and Harry had the good grace to not be too nice to all of his friends. They got absolutely hammered and Blaise Zabini had told his boyfriend that if he ever needed help with any nefarious plots, the Snake Club would have his back. Harry roared with laughter, and gave Pansy, Blaise, Millicent, and Goyle a kiss on the cheek good night.
"It is actually my house, so I can, but why can't I put it in my favorite study? It looks comfortable."
"Will you help me find an appropriate baroque chaise for the green parlor?" He kisses Draco's neck softly, for good measure.
Hermione says "Might be a bit too soon for Gin to meet the mystery girl of yours, but I would love to meet her."
Silence. A picture of surprise, then a picture of domestic bliss, Hermione and Ron, conversing with each other, only through eye contact, or maybe they had mastered the art of mind reading.
This is a sentiment he hears, and he understands it for what it is: 'take care of yourself, Potter, I can't be worrying about you only eating crisps when I am not here'.
And even with coming out and even with Ron and Hermione and the whole Weasley Clan knowing that Harry was seeing someone, this answer still shocked them for a second.
Harry reaches out and grabs Draco, hard enough to show that he wants him to stay but not so hard Draco can't shake him off if he is really upset. When Draco doesn't resist, Harry puts his front to Draco's back, and rests his chin on Draco's shoulder.
"My then girlfriend told my best friends that we weren't having sex because I couldn't get it up for her. Not that is really any of her business or yours but I was just depressed, and she was just not who I needed, it wasn't because she is a girl. Yes I am seeing a therapist, no I do not have erectile dysfunction."
And Harry almost laughed. the thought of Hermione Granger wanting to meet Draco Malfoy outside of a very professional smile and wave, and as Harry's something, lover, boyfriend, just friends, was comical.
"Well she told us, well she told me and I told Ron, but she thought you might be gay, because well--"
"Alright mate! This is a banging chair, love the deal, its new innit? Love, what do you think about one renaissance chair for the house?"
Ginny quirked a beautiful brow and Harry felt his dark skin heat, his pink ears, thankfully hidden behind his mess of wavy hair.
After that, the robe comes off, and later Harry doesn't even think about putting it away, even though he is at some level conscious that Hermione and Ron are coming by for brunch tomorrow, and the fact that Hermione refuses to use any of the bathrooms other than his because of weird house-elf décor doesn't seem important.
"She must be pretty special if she got you carrying around her scrunchies," Ginny said at the exact moment Hermione came over to them, bringing their drinks, water for herself, and the party noise.
Harry is so overwhelmingly grateful that his friends have just spared him from a night of melancholy without Draco that he forgets about to very telling sets of things, two wine glasses, to sets of slippers by the couch, and two, very, very banned books about cannibalistic blood rituals that Draco and him had been reading out of morbid curiosity. That was until Hermione stopped short in the open door way, and looking around, maybe for the person that should also be here. Muddy Waters was still playing on the record player, the newest piece of technology that the house tolerated in this room.
Draco smiled before his expression turned thoughtful. "Do you think you'd have ever wanted to be with me if this hadn't happened to us?" he asked quietly, his wings rustling slightly.
Harry and Draco spent the remainder of the day practicing with their wings. Their muscles and bones had changed a bit to support their wings and it was difficult to make the movements they desired.
Dinner had been delicious with no awkward questions about eating chicken. Though Ron was pleased to throw out as many bird-related puns as he could. Draco always did his best to look very annoyed, but it didn't always work.
When James was a year old, they welcomed a second son to the family. Little Scorpius had Harry's green eyes but Draco's fair compexion and blond hair.
"Of course Harry," Luna smiled. "I'm so happy for you both." She gave Draco's stomach a gentle pat before taking her leave.
Ron made a strange noise that was probably disgust.  “Let’s dance,” he muttered, pulling Hermione toward the other couples that were twirling around to the music.
"I appreciate it," Draco said lightly, reaching out to stroke the eggshell with delicate, loving fingers. He glanced away and spotted the blue tin on the counter. "What's this then?" he asked.
Ron was relieved when the healers finished cleaning up all the blood. He sat down on a chair near Harry's bed, determined to be there when Harry and Draco woke up.
Draco winked at him before turning his attention to Hermione and Pansy.  “What can I do for you?” he asked, as if he hadn’t been groping Harry a mere thirty seconds prior.
Hermione entered a moment later, carrying two vials. "You're awake," she sighed, looking relieved. She reached out and tipped Harry's head back to help him drink the potion. She stroked his hair gently while the potion took effect. When his face relaxed, she withdrew her hand.
Hermione laughed. "They're not all like that," she responded. "I like the fantasy of it. Dreaming of finding someone that loves you and wants to do a bunch of silly things to show their love. Snogging in the rain, dancing in the street... Who wouldn't want to be adored by someone?"
"Hermione sent me her Patronus," Neville put in helpfully. "She told me what was happening and wanted me to get her some potions. I called Blaise and had him help me."
His gaze fell to his desk and he spotted a piece of parchment that hadn't been there before. His eyes scanned the writing, widening in concern just before he doubled over in pain.
A gasp startled the two men out of their heated exchange.  Hermione and Pansy had approached while they were distracted.  The two women were gaping at them in shock.
Hermione watched as the two men swallowed their potions, grimacing only slightly at the taste. "All better now?" she asked after a few moments, allowing time for the potion to work. "Come to me straight away if you feel the least bit poorly."
Harry pulled Draco out of the nursery and into their room. Draco gasped when Harry pressed him into the wall, gently pinning the lovely white wings. It felt a little odd, but it didn't hurt so Draco relaxed into Harry's hold.
They read through the article, quite pleased with Rita's work. Per their agreement, Rita didn't stay from the information Harry provided. The marriage of Harry and Draco, the birth of James and a brief overview of why they'd been in hiding was printed for the Wizarding World to see. Included at the end was a request for fans and media to respect the privacy of the new family. Harry hadn't requested that part, but he was grateful to Rita for including it. Though, he doubted people would cooperate.
Harry hesitantly dropped his hand to rest on Draco's stomach. "I'm here with you," Harry assured him. "I'm not going anywhere. I just want you to be happy. But..." He paused to take in a shaky breath. "I'd be lying if I said I didn't want this."
"For one, she's still unregistered," Harry snorted. "Two... I plan to make it worth it. I'll give her a story she won't be able to pass up." He glanced meaningfully at the egg.
"It's alright Harry," Ron said softly, smiling at the scared little boy. "I won't hurt you." He moved slowly and cautiously, reaching out until he could gently stroke the soft skin of Harry's cheek. Harry remained still, staring at Ron. When Ron reached out to pick him up, he flinched slightly but made no other protest.
Draco cleared his throat uncomfortably. "Yes, well... I trust your family is well?" he questioned. "Is your child a patient?"
And so, while dreading the wizarding public, Harry and Draco prepared to leave the house for something other than work. They had dinner plans with their friends.
A month after the de-aging incident, Draco and Harry found themselves in another bizarre predicament. In Harry's defense, the potion was slipped into their coffee while Harry's back was turned. But Draco still chose to blame Harry at that moment. Surely no good could come from allowing Harry to make coffee for the both of them so early in the morning.
Their friends came in and quietly admired the new egg. Draco fell asleep in the reverent silence, one arm cradling the egg and his head resting on Harry's outstretched arm.
"Last night was the first time," she said, not making eye contact. "There's been a lot of flirting but... Salazar, last night I just couldn't help myself."
Draco nodded, feeling a bit of tension drain out of him. It was ridiculously pleased that Harry accepted his apology without a fuss. Deciding to push his luck, he smiled. "Now will you offer me tea?"
Ron leaned against the door frame, catching the end of the tender moment. "Alright Harry," Ron chided with a grin. "Let Draco eat his egg rolls. Then you can molest him, or whatever."
After six months, Draco had reluctantly admitted to Pansy that he had feelings for Harry.  He’d always been drawn to Harry, but their friendship had allowed Draco to get a closer look at the Savior of the Wizarding World.  And his heart was lost.
"None that we could find," Ron replied. "But, we did find a bit of the potion. I sent it to the lab for analysis. Maybe the ingredients themselves will be a clue. Or we could find a cure," he added, nodding toward Harry's gray wings.
Draco's orgasm was exquisite. There could be no other words for it as far as Draco was concerned. Once Harry swallowed, Draco yanked him up for a kiss, his tongue catching remnants of his own release. Draco took hold of Harry's aching cock and stroked him to orgasm, allowing it to spill over his stomach in white rivulets. Then Draco hugged Harry close, not caring that Harry's semen was being smeared between them.
"What's the matter?" Draco asked, sitting down on one of the cushions so that his back rested against Harry's stomach.
"The potion did more than give us wings," Draco murmured. "One of the changes made it so that I could conceive... I produced an egg. It hatched last week."
Protuding from Harry's back were a pair of enourmous wings. They were large enough that Ron was sure they would drag the ground when Harry stood up. The feathers were mostly a pale gray with the edges lined in a darker gray. The wings almost looked silver in the light.
"What about the others?" Ron asked. "There are six more names on this list." He wrenched the hoods off of the wizards, checking each face and comparing it to the list he pulled out of his pocket. Then he froze. "Where's Grant?"
The wizards turned to look at Ron and Kingsley, firing spells at them, giving Draco and Harry the chance to fire off stunning spells. They let out high, shrill shrieking sounds distracting their attackers to allow Ron and Kingsley to join the fight more easily.
"Alright, back in bed for you two," Hermione declared, gently pushing Draco toward his bed. "We can release you in the morning if nothing else happens."
Draco chirped in shock when Harry scooped him up and carried him to their bedroom. "And what do you think you're doing?" Draco asked teasingly.
"We do it now," Ron snapped. "We could miss something important by following strict protocol or patting ourselves on the back too quickly. Ask now." Ron knew he probably sounded a bit unhinged, but these wizards had done a lot of damage. The rest of their group could be doing something horrible at another location right at that moment.
"That's right," Hermione agreed with a nod. "That's what makes a few of the healers think it was meant to be a full transformation. Why include a part of a bird's anatomy that would be useless to a hybrid."
"Yeah yeah," Ron waved her off. "Let me get them safe. Then you'll get your recognition and the exclusive interview. You have my word."
Harry watched in alarm as Draco prepared a cup of tea, his fingers shaking badly. The cup rattled against the saucer loudly as Draco attempted to steady his hands.
Harry blushed at the endearment and happily allowed Draco to lead him across the room to the Christmas tree.  Pansy took the lead and handed out the gifts that had been gathered under the tree, leaving Harry and Draco to watch the proceedings.  Draco shifted to stand just behind Harry and wrapped his arms around Harry’s torso.  Harry brought his hands up to brush his fingers over Draco’s knuckles.
Harry laughed. "I'm glad you think so," he remarked. He sighed softly brushing his fingertips down Draco's cheek. "You're home, you're safe and carrying our child," he murmured. "I don't think I've ever been so happy."
"What did they do to me?" Harry asked with wide anxious eyes. He could feel that something was different. There was an odd pressure on his upper back. He turned his head to peer over his shoulder and let out a startled yelp.
"Exhausted," Draco answered with a yawn. He pulled Harry down to rest next to him. "You're a brilliant shag Harry Potter."
"I think we're getting close," Draco said. The egg had gotten heavier and if you really focus, you can feel the baby nudging against the shell."
Pansy didn't make any comment on the conversation. She looked a bit amused and rather curious, but she'd handed him the bag of sweets and bid him goodnight. It left Draco with time to think while he prepared his gift baskets.
Pansy nodded, levitating the tea tray into the living room. She sat down and poured the tea, allowing Narcissa to prepare her own as she wished. "It's not sexual or romantic though," Pansy said. "Granger thinks that their hormones are unbalanced right now. Their human side sort of warring with the bird side. Draco is anxious and tense from all these changes. And then there's his father..."
Draco responded by pulling Harry into a passionate kiss. He held Harry as closely as he could, enjoying the warmth. After a moment, Harry squeaked and pulled away. He was blushing profusely.
"No need to apologize," Draco insisted. He watched as Harry yawned and put his head back down. Smirking, Draco pulled Harry up and turned him around, chuckling when Harry pressed his face to Draco's shoulder. Draco pulled out his wand and cast a charm to make Harry lighter. Then he scooped Harry up without a word of warning.
"It was Harry's idea," Pansy reminded him. "He told us what he wanted and we brought his ideas to life. He loves you so much Draco," she added, her eyes drifting to the other groom who was hugging Molly and Arthur before they departed.
Harry gently shiftex Draco and laid him down. He cleaned them off with a few spells, combing his fingers through Draco's hair. "Are you alright?" Harry asked.
"He'll be great," Harry assured her, glancing past her to see Draco approaching with a glass of champagne for Harry and a plate of hors d'oeuvres. Sometimes it still amazed Harry how angelic Draco looked with his gorgeous white wings spread out behind him. Draco was beautiful and Harry was even more smitten than he was on the day of their wedding.
Draco was silent for a moment. He looked down at his shopping bags pensively. It was getting late and he still need to put together the gift baskets so they could be delivered the next day. "Would you be willing to give me his address?" he asked cautiously.
"No apology necessary," Narcissa replied, setting her teacup aside. "You are under a lot of strain. Your father is a fool and I will handle him." She hugged her son warmly. "Might I visit again?"
They slammed through the door with a spell and ran into the house ready to attack. They found Harry and Draco facing off against six wizards. Their wings were spread wide and they had assumed dueling positions, carefully blocking the stairway. They looked exhausted. Harry had one arm wrapped around his own torso.
He stopped at a Chinese restaurant and picked up an assortment of food before popping over to Harry and Draco's house. He apparated into their living room to find them on the enormous cushion that Hermione had brought them months before.
Draco's laugh died abruptly in his throat and his gaze darted to Harry's face. They hadn't talked about that. Draco's pregnancy had been an accident, regardless of how they now felt about it. To deliberately have more children...
"Are you serious?" Draco asked incredulously. "Bird puns right now?" He couldn't be too annoyed though; Ron's ridiculous joke had made Harry chuckle.
"Sorrow," Trelawney said sadly, staring into the bottom of Harry's teacup solemnly. She glanced at his upturned hand with pursed lips. "But, love is in your future. How lovely. Shall I consult the beyond with my crystal? I'm sure she's beautiful."
The others arrived a short time later, carrying gifts. They knew that it wouldn't be long, so they thought they'd celebrate with Harry and Draco.
Hermione bit her lip. "The change nearly killed both of you," she admitted, wincing at the blond's horrified expression. "It will take some time to determine if we can remove the bird DNA. We don't want to kill you."
"Harry. Harry, stay awake," Hermione said suddenly, ducking behind Draco to grasp at Harry's shoulders.
Harry turned his head to look at Draco.  “Me too Draco.  Happy Christmas,” Harry said quietly.  It was tempting to say how much he loved Draco, but Harry decided to wait.  There would be plenty of time for that.
Harry sighed quietly, relieved when people moved out of the way so they could go on their way. Nobody had seemed hostile, but their demanding sort of curiosity had been unsettling. Harry had been prepared to force his way through if he had to, but the Daily Prophet would have published some ridiculous article able he and Draco being aggressive and dangerous after their transformation.
Ron's felt a wave of nausea when he saw a few healers cleaning up blood from the walls. Bright red was splattered up the white walls and on the floor. Harry's face was unusually pale as he rested on his side.
"That's enough," Narcissa said firmly. She could see that her son was getting quite upset and that Harry looked desperate to either comfort him or attach Lucius. "Lucius, this behavior is unacceptable. We're leaving." She glared when he seemed ready to argue and he fell into petulant silence. Narcissa turned back to Harry and Draco. "Harry dear, dinner was heavenly and I look forward to seeing you again. Draco darling, relax and enjoy the rest of your evening." She turned and shooed Lucius out of the room.
"We appreciate your patience," Harry said calmly, knowing perfectly well that Rita wasn't patient. "Please have a seat."
For another hour, Hermione and Pansy observed Draco’s solicitous behavior toward Harry.  Harry was perfectly polite, but gave no indication of awareness.  The party was nearly over and Draco was becoming even more nervous.
Harry forced his eyes back open and Draco pulled his hand away. Draco looked as tired as Harry felt. Harry moved to his own bed, getting on his hands knees on the mattress before carefully shifting onto his side, facing Draco's bed. The thought of being able to keep an eye on one another was oddly comforting.
Lucius remained silent for most of the meal. He'd switched out the wine for firewhiskey, wishing that he could drink away the whole absurd situation. Draco was also nursing his own firewhiskey, fantasizing about snogging Harry on the dining table just to annoy his father.
Draco dressed himself, not bothering to question it. Harry's obvious excitement was making him a little nervous.
"Well, your father wanted to purchase a full wardrobe," Narcissa said lightly. "But I thought it might be prudent to wait until we knew what the baby will be. Gender is a factor as well as whether or not the baby will also have wings, though I suspect that it will."
Ron nodded slowly. That explained why the feathers looked so clean despite the gore in the room. "Can it be reversed?" he asked. "Can you take the wings off?"
"That seems perfectly rational," Trelawney nodded. "Congratulations Mr. Potter. You will have three god-children." Harry just nodded, dazed.
"No, we're just passing through to the maternity ward," Hermione replied. "Angelina just had her baby."
Autumn went by in a flurry of activity. Harry and Draco made frequent trips out, always carefully guarded by their friends or a few Aurors. Ron had become increasingly frustrated as more reports came in about dark rituals, but he could never catch up with the wizards responsible.
Harry pulled Draco into a hug. "I'm so excited," Harry said, pressing little kisses all over Draco's face.
Draco gave a little huff, looking down. "I swear, if anyone else makes me cry today, I'm going to kill everyone," he growled.
Harry froze, staring at Draco. Until that moment, Harry had been viewing the situation almost like Draco had an illness. Suddenly, Harry's world shifted and his breath caught in his throat.
"Are you really going to be mad at your friends for worrying about you?" Draco asked quietly. Harry looked at him in surprise. "Is reasonable to be angry with me for caring about how you feel?" He paused while Harry drew in a deep shuddering breath. "This isn't about pity. This is me really wanting to see you happy again. I did tell you that we'd be best friends," he added with a tentative smile.
"The movie ended and they went home," Draco responded, smoothing down Harry's hair and making Harry hum in approval.
The others joined in with a cheer. A moment later, Professor Trelawney approached them. "I see that I was correct," she said rather smugly.
Harry nearly jumped when he felt Draco's hand against his back ushering him further in. They spent a few moments chatting with their ex-Professor before leaving the office. They walked quickly through the halls, grateful that they hadn't run into anyone. Most of the students had gone home for Christmas. As the began to climb a very narrow staircase, Harry realized where they were going.
Harry grinned, glad that his pain had subsided enough that he could thoroughly enjoy holding his son. "Why don't we stop at two or three?" he suggested with a laugh. Draco nodded his agreement, kissing Harry sweetly.
"It's my baby," Harry said so softly that Draco had nearly missed it. Harry's eyes were wet and his lips trembled. "It's our baby." He sat on the edge of the bed and hugged Draco close.
"I might have made some... arrangements," Harry admitted. "If you'd prefer to wait, it's not a problem. But, you have the option to get married right away."
Hermione shook her head.  “I should have warned him,” she said.  “Harry’s a terrible dancer, so he generally avoids it.”  She glanced around before gently pushing Pansy toward the right so they were closer to Harry.
But in the bedroom, Harry took control. Draco loved it. Sweet, docile Harry became sensual and insatiable. From the very first time, Draco had gladly relaxed into the mattress and allowed Harry to worship his body in whatever way he saw fit. It was a highly rewarding experience every time.
After a few days, Draco finally admitted the source of his agitation. "It's just not right," Draco complained. "And I don't know how to fix it."
Harry set the movie up quickly and then approached Draco with a concerned down. "Are you alright?" he asked.
"Oh my god!" Draco wailed, burying his face against Harry's shoulder again. "Stupid cow!" he cried, though his voice was muffled by Harry's robes.
Harry sighed, tilting his head to give Draco more room. His hands slipped beneath Draco's shirt to caress bare skin. His breath caught when Draco lapped slowly at his neck before sucking at it gently.
It was a few weeks later that Pansy managed to ask what they'd all been wondering about the couple. Pansy was stunned when she realized that they'd not had sex. Pansy eyed Draco as he arranged some biscuits on a plate to go with their tea.
Hermione handed Harry the second bottle. They all watched as he drank the potion from the safety of Draco's arms. Once he was finished, Hermione motioned toward the cot and Draco carefully layed the little boy down.
Draco motioned for Harry to come around the bed. Once Harry was close enough, Draco reached out and trailed his fingers down soft gray feathers. He smiled smugly when Harry's eyes slid closed and he cooed softly.
For a moment they stood in silence, staring at the tin of poisoned tea. Despite keeping Draco's pregnancy a secret, they'd all trusted Grant. He'd been Ron's partner for nearly two years. He'd been working with them on the case that had transformed Harry and Draco.
Harry struggled out of his shirt and hastily began adjusting his nest of pillows to make room for Draco while Draco eagerly removed his own clothing. This was easier said than done since Draco had decided that it was a good time to press warm wet kisses to the bare skin on Harry's back. Harry moaned but managed to keep working.
Ron shooed Harry away as he reached to take the bag of ingredients. "But you won't be cooking this time," Ron said firmly. "Draco is due any time now. You're going to focus on him while I do this. Besides, Pansy will be helping me," he added nonchalantly, though his reddening ears were a bit telling.
Harry nodded quickly while Draco huffed impatiently. Satisfied, Ron ducked into Robards office for a moment. When he returned, he looked satisfied. "Right. You two are free to go," Ron said. "You should have Kreacher take you. I can't imagine that using the floo or apparating would be pleasant."
Ron choked on his laugh, lifting his head to look at Harry. Draco was staring at Harry with wide, shocked eyes. Narcissa and Lucius looked bewildered but hopeful.
"Hermione, I know you and Parkinson might get all hot and bothered at the thought of two blokes tearing into each other, but my poor heart can't take it!"
"Don't worry," Draco said with a dismissive wave of his hand. "We'll be going to Hogwarts, but we'll avoid all of the students. You can even bring your invisibility cloak."
Harry sat down at the table, relief flooding through him. After being cornered on the street, he didn't think he could tolerate being stared at during the meal. He smiled tightly as Draco sat next to him.
"What are you waiting for?" Harry teased. He turned and sauntered up the stairs with Draco on his heels.
Once dressed, Harry took their egg in his arms and moved toward the door. Draco followed him down the stairs apprehensively.
Draco arched a single brow at Harry. "Don't be silly Potter. I'm far ambitious than that. I'm offended," he declared haughtily.
After Narcissa left, Draco returned to the nursery. The painted sky was dark and glittering with stars. It was hard to believe that there would soon be a baby sleeping in the crib.
Draco flinched and Harry began to worry. Draco's parents had been in France for a few weeks and were due to return home that day. Draco hadn't wanted to worry them by telling them about the attack and his transformation. Harry was sure that Draco was putting off the need to face it. Clearly it hadn't gone well.
Draco let out an excited squeal and tackled Harry with a hug. "Good boy Habby!" he jabbered against Harry's robes.
Ron went about putting the shopping away, humming to himself. He'd been asked to be the baby's godfather and he was humbled by the request. It was such an honor and Draco had agreed instantly when Harry suggested it. Ron was so grateful and rather eager to help whenever he could. Draco was no longer leaving the house, and Harry rarely ventured out. So, Ron brought their favorite foods over along with books and new movies. He'd enlisted Pansy's help in getting new clothes for Draco. Draco's wardrobe could have been magically altered, but he'd enjoyed getting new clothes so Harry had happily provided whatever funds were needed to pamper Draco.
Ron folded his arms over his chest, frowning in thought. He looked between Harry and Draco. "I can't, in good conscience, let either of you go off alone," he said. He smiled slightly at their pouting expressions. "What if you two just stayed together? Go to Harry's house and watch the telly while you get some rest. I'll check on you throughout the day. If one of you runs off, I swear I'll track you down and take you straight to Hermione," he added sternly.
The woman started at Harry, her eyes widening in recognition. "Harry Potter and his boyfriend want to adopt my grandchildren," she said faintly.
Draco sighed quietly, his anxiety fading rapidly. He'd known that the Weasley matriarch would hard their child, but his instinct to protect had flared in sudden, crippling panic. He felt foolish for his reaction. But, the others didn't seem to mind and had moved on.
Once Draco had finished drinking, Hermione transfigured a quill into a cot and placed the little boy on it. He drifted off to sleep, curled under the blanket Hermione placed over him.
A knock at the door drew their attention and Kingsley opened to reveal Pansy Parkinson. "What has Potter done to Draco?" she demanded loudly.
On Christmas morning, Harry woke to find Draco cuddled up against him. The blond had his head pillowed on Harry's shoulder and he had slipped one hand under Harry's shirt to rest on Harry's stomach.
Draco sighed again but didn't argue. He allowed himself to be turned around and, to his delight, Harry proceeded to preen and coax his feathers back into place with gentle fingers. It was amazing how quickly it relaxed him.
Of all the people to be at his door, Harry would never have expected Draco Malfoy. The situation was only made more odd by the look of faint alarm that crossed Draco's features as his gaze swept over Harry. "Malfoy?" Harry said stupidly, his voice a bit rough.
“Please don’t,” Harry panted, tilting his head and pressing another hot, open-mouthed kiss to Draco’s neck.
Draco began rubbing the baby down with the towel, his heart aching as the baby began to cry. He could see the little featherless wings protruding from the baby's shoulder blades. Draco made gentle cooing sounds, as he cleaned his son off. "My beautiful baby boy," Draco said softly, accepting a blanket from Hermione and deftly swaddling the infant.
"Don't try to get out of it now," Draco retorted haughtily. "I'm about to marry the shite out of you, and you'll just have to take it."
Harry sighed. After a moment, he pulled Hermione into a hug. "I'm sorry," he murmured, his voice rough. "I just- I don't want to talk about..."
Harry smiled apologetically.  “You’re always so much fun to wind up,” he admitted.  “I felt a bit like I was being manipulated, so I thought I’d get back at you by driving you batty.  I had no idea that I was making you so upset.”  He shifted as if to reach for Draco, but resisted the impulse.  An irritable Draco was prone to throwing hexes.  “When I saw that you’d got out the mistletoe, I levitated all of it to you.  That way I could end the night by doing what we both want, but on my own terms.”
Harry bit his lip hard. It would be a really unfortunate time to laugh at his hormonal husband. To his amusement, Hermione squealed in excitement. She pried Draco off of Harry and hugged him fiercely. "That's wonderful!" she exclaimed. "Why are you so upset?"
The man's wife had died shortly after the birth of twin boys. He'd begun slowly poisoning his step-daughter with a very rare potion, disguising the effects as a mysterious illness that baffled healers.
“Maybe Harry didn’t see the mistletoe,” Pansy suggested, though she still felt tempted to hex the scar-headed idiot.
Harry stopped Draco several times a day to make him eat. Draco was having bouts of nausea, but after a potion he had no problem eating whatever Harry put in from of him.
It was almost more than Harry could take. To think that his ex-rival had looked at Harry and seen such an overflow of love despite their tumultuous past... For Draco to be so inspired by Harry was humbling and Harry felt honored. Without consideration for the others, Harry reached up to pull Draco's face close for a tender kiss.
Draco stretched and sat up, wincing as his head throbbed. It was if all of his memories had suddenly flooded into his mind, leaving him shaken and nauseous. He lifted his trembling hands and inspected them anxiously. He turned to Pansy expectantly.
Harry sighed and rolled his eyes. "Forgive me," he said flatly. "I don't usually serve tea to people that hate me. Did you just come here to make bizarre and unreasonable demands?"
With moments of drinking from their coffee, both men began to feel rather hot. Draco frowned, tugging at his collar uncomfortably. Why was it so bloody hot?
For a few moments, nothing seemed to happen. And then pain tore through Harry's body. He felt as if his very skin was attempting to shred itself. Next to him, Draco cried out in agony. They helplessly writhed in pain. Their captors merely looked on. One of them was making notes in a little book.
"Oh right! Grant wanted me to bring that too you," Ron explained. "He was telling me that he feels badly you two are stuck here. He said that tea would help calm your nerves and relax you."
Hermione pressed on his stomach carefully, her hands drifting over the skin slowly. "I think you're ready," she said. "It feels really firm today. I'd guess as early as tonight. Maybe tomorrow."
"You're afraid," Harry replied, gathering Draco into his arms. "I am too. Those instincts are there for a reason. The fear is completely justified and I certainly don't blame you for it. I'll keep you safe, just as I know that you'll do the same for me."
"I'll be alright," Ron insisted. "I'll pick the team myself. I may even drag Kingsley along." He smiled slightly. "You three are family and I'm here to make sure you stick around for a while. "Let me take care of you Harry," he added.
"We don't usually have potions being tossed at us," Draco retorted, gratefully accepting a pain potion from Hermione. "We don't generally sustain serious injuries and we are excellent at what we do," he said, holding up his vial toward Harry, as if in a toast. Harry returned the gesture with his own pain potion.
Hermione shrugged apologetically. "I'll be waiting for when Draco's ready to deliver the egg," she said. "Then we wait again for it to hatch. Our timeline is unknown."
Ron had done a decent job of tolerating Draco at work. And he got by with mostly ignoring Pansy when she popped by the DMLE. But having them invade his space outside of work seemed to be asking too much of him.
Maddie sniffled, and Draco gave her hand a comforting squeeze. "She doesn't think she can take me and the babies. We have to be split up." Sad little tears rolled down her cheeks.
Harry watched in fascination as Draco ate a slice of treacle tart. The blonde was perched on a bar stool by the kitchen counter, humming in pleasure as he licked his spoon.
"Don't be daft," Ron waved him off. "You look great. But I know that you're tired and uncomfortable."
"You're gorgeous," Harry insisted. "I love this," he added, lovingly caressing the swell of his lover's abdomen.
After fifteen minutes, five dark wizards were disarmed and bound. The aurors were relatively unharmed. It just seemed to easy.
Harry saw a mind-healer and was recovering from his depression. It was a long process, but Draco supported every step. Harry quickly decided to leave the Aurors and concentrate on his family and getting better. This enabled Draco to continue with his apothecary while Harry cared for the children during the day.
"Probably nothing," Hermione said. "We feel confident that you're both stable now. But, it's best to be cautious since you nearly didn't survive. Your change was particularly difficult," she added.
Pansy seemed eager to expand on Blaise's comment. "At first I didn't understand what was driving Draco," she said reflectively. "He started small. Donating to charities and the like. Then he was taking gifts to sick children. Soon it was this massive part of his life." She smiled in remembrance. "I was asking him about it one day while we were in the ministry, and he caught sight of you across the atrium," she told Harry. "You were kneeling and talking to a little boy that was beyond excited to see you. After a moment, Draco looked at me and said 'He gave everything.' That's all he would say. It was, perhaps, a little dramatic but profound... I understood Draco heart a little better that day."
"She's at St. Mungos," Harry responded. "They think we caught it in time. Her little brothers were unharmed." He cleared his throat and looked down. "When I saw the man, I snapped. Ron and Robards had to pull me off of him. I won't lose my job, but I had to be reprimanded. I'm not allowed to hit people," he concluded in a sulky tone.
Hermione relented with an indulgent smile. "Fine. Let's get you looked at before the others get here."
Harry nodded absently, his eyes drawn to Draco's covered abdomen. He briefly wondered if it looked a tiny bit bigger, but he doubted that it would be wise to mention it.
Harry chirped loudly in alarm. "Calm down," Draco chuckled. "I'm putting you to bed. Tuck your wings in."
Harry swallowed tightly, his eyes growing damp. He was so moved that he couldn't bring himself to speak just yet.
"Maybe," Draco hedged. He felt a bit self-conscious about his appetite. Hermione had assured him that would take a little time for him to feel normal. His body was replenishing after spending two months redirecting most of its nutrients to the egg. Without the bulk of the egg, it was obvious that Draco was thinner than was normal for him.
"You are," Harry agreed. "In everything. But I need to know that you've got the baby. Ron and I work well together. I'll be alright."
"I'm only joking," Ron assured him, setting the blue tin on the counter and holding his arms out. He was delighted when Draco passed the egg without hesitation. "I'll hold this little darling while you eat something."
Ron smiled happily. "I'll go make my godson a bottle," he said proudly. He left the room and a moment later, they heard loud cheering from downstairs.
"Are you married?" Celia asked. When Draco shook his head she sighed. "I appreciate your concern, but you couldn't do it alone. I want the best for them."
Harry frowned slightly at the strange anxiety in Draco's voice. He turned to the blond in concern, his mouth going dry when he spied the mistletoe. Well, there was certainly no mistaking the request.
"Then we'll make one for you," Harry said, grinning while Draco reluctantly crawled back out of the nest.
Draco walked into find that Harry's bed was gone. Instead, there was a large nest. Draco could see at the base that it had been constructed out of sticks. There was sage green fabric draped over it and hugging the outer walls. Several pillows in a darker green were scattered inside the nest. Draco stepped closer and pressed against the fabric, finding that it was wonderfully soft and cushioned.
"Come on then," Harry said softly. He coaxed Draco toward the hallway, looking at Pansy over his shoulder. "Pans, why don't you make some tea? We'll be back shortly."
“I can see that,” Pansy smirked.  “Well, actually, I can’t.  If you’d move just a bit, I’d love to see what you’re doing with your right hand.”
Draco bit his lip, forcing himself to go slowly. He was so relieved when Harry seemed ready for him. He carefully removed his fingers and slicked up his cock. "Can you get on your hands and knees?" he asked.
Harry had met the little girl on the pediatric ward and immediately understood why she was Draco's favorite. She was so sweet, and she gave the best hugs. He hated that she had to so send so much time in and out of the hospital. And now Harry knew why.
A burst of laughter broke through Pansy's thoughts. Harry was shaking with mirth and Draco was smirking. Pansy shook her head. If nothing else, they seemed to have created a decent friendship. For the time being, that would do.
"Can we help?" Draco asked anxiously. He felt like an arse just sitting their watching his baby struggle to break out of an egg.
Ron had sent his partner back to the minister to alert Head Auror Robards and Minister Kingsley. Most of the culprits had escaped. One of them had been caught by Ron, but he'd died within minutes. Ron knew that Robards was likely to be an arse about the whole thing. The dark wizards had gotten away. But Ron wasn't willing to risk losing two aurors, especially when one of them was his best mate.
Hermione returned to find Harry cradling Draco in his arms. Harry was making a series of chirps, coos and trills, all while nuzzling Draco's cheek. Hermione smiled slightly, clearing her throat to announce her presence. Harry looked over at her and smiled so joyfully that Hermione's heart gave a happy leap.
Draco scowled and pushed Harry away.  “I hadn’t expected such cruelty from you,” Draco hissed, aware that his eyes suddenly felt uncomfortably hot.  He would not give in to the ridiculous urge to cry.  “I was trying to preserve our friendship, but clearly that isn’t a concern of yours.”
Draco hugged Harry again, relief flooding through him. "The egg is hatching," he informed Harry with a watery smile.
Lucius sighed. It had been difficult to adjust after the war. Becoming aware of his only son's infatuation with the Chosen One had been a shock. Though, Lucius probably should have guessed much sooner. Narcissa certainly had. The desire to continue their Pureblood lineage was strong. But more potent was the desire to see his son happy. Lucius had watched his son suffer for his father's mistakes and Lucius would have to live with that guilt. But here was a good opportunity to perhaps make up for a tiny bit of all that.
Draco barely nodded his acknowledgement, his eyes fixed on the egg. He could see the shell shift slightly from the pressure inside. The crack widened a bit and the egg wobbled slightly with the baby's movement.
"It's a bit excessive," Draco agreed lightly. "But we do have a few extra people coming for breakfast."
Harry nodded and then looked around his living room. "I need to make some changes," he said thoughtfully. "My furniture isn't made to accommodate wings. It's really difficult to sleep too. I just don't feel comfortable anywhere." Draco nodded his agreement.
Harry did as requested, wondering what Draco was up to. He moaned when Draco leaned forward, slowly taking Harry's cock into his mouth.
"It's poisoned," Harry blurted out unnecessarily, pulling Draco into his embrace. His green eyes darted to Ron's horrified expression. "Grant gave you that?" he demanded.
"It is an honor and privilege to know their family," Kingsley went on. "So, today we honor them in return. On behalf of Wizarding Britain, thank you both."
Draco chirruped softly before ducking his head and blushing. Harry smiled softly in response. Narcissa's eyebrows rose in surprise and confusion.
Draco let out a sudden burst of surprised laughter and hugged Harry excitedly. He met his father's eyes over Harry's shoulder. "Thank you," Draco said quietly.
Draco moved to open the window, huffing in annoyance when the owl landed on the counter top and tried to preen Harry's feathers. "That's my husband you feathery git," Draco grumbled. "Do your job and get out of here."
Harry had thrown the knickers onto the floor of the lift and set them on fire. Draco had sunk to the floor in a fit of hysterical laughter. Harry was grateful that most encounters weren't nearly so embarrassing. But Draco had made up for his laughter at Harry's expense by loudly berating the brazen witch for sexual harassment of the Chosen One. The atrium was probably not the best place for such a thing, but it did seem to warn others away from similar stunts.
"I'm sure Grant has been messing up my progress this whole time," Room growled. "Maybe it'll be better to arrest him and get it out of the way. At least then I could move forward without him messing things up. "It's too dangerous for me to just follow him. And taking a team will be too obvious." He returned to his meal sullenly. He shot Pansy a tense smile when she patted his hand consolingly.
Of course, Grant had later asked about the couple later on in the day. Ron really hated to be dishonest with his partner. The relationship between auror partners was important. They had to rely on one another and trust was essential. But Ron had shrugged off his guilt and assured Grant that the couple was simply waiting out the mysterious dark wizards.
Harry swept Draco into his arms without a second thought, hurrying up the stairs and to their bedroom. Draco rested on his side, shivering violently as his hands rubbed at the front of his stomach gently.
Harry looked pleased, though his eyes were searching the small group of guests.  “Where did Draco go?” he asked.
Draco bit his lip, shooting Harry a hopeful look. Harry grinned. He'd had a difficult time denying Draco anything before, but now that he'd witnessed his lover carrying and then birthing their egg... Draco pretty much got whatever he wanted. "Would you like that?" Harry asked, leaning close to press a warm kiss just behind Draco's ear.
One of Harry's hands abandoned Draco's nipple in favor of slipping into Draco's opening. The fingers were wet and a bit cold. Draco hadn't even heard Harry open a bottle of lube or mutter a spell. Probably because Draco was moaning shamelessly, his fingers tangling in Harry's hair.
Draco's shirt was removed and he positioned himself on his hands and knees. Hermione coated her palms with a salve and reached for Draco's stomach. "This will help numb you a little and allow your cloaca to stretch wide enough to release the egg without tearing you open," she explained.
Harry was frantic. He wanted to scream and throw things to relieve some of the tension pooling in his stomach. His wings never stopped moveing. They flapped, fluttered and trembled even while Harry forced himself to sit at Draco's side.
Draco allowed himself to be guided to the dining room, his mind still swirling with thoughts. He'd just gotten married. He was married and waiting for his baby to hatch from an egg. His wings fluttered behind him, brushing lightly against Harry's wings.
Draco frowned and looked up.  A dozen sprigs of mistletoe were clumped together and hovering over his head.  Draco stared at the plants in shock before dropping his gaze to Harry.  He swallowed hard when he realized that Harry was suddenly much closer.
"I just wish Rita wasn't coming today," Harry grumbled, guiding Draco down the stairs. "We could spend the whole day cuddling."
Ron sighed. He really wanted his best mate there, but he hated to see Harry suffer. "It's okay Harry," he said gently, patting Harry on the shoulder. "I'll come round to visit you."
"Rita Skeeter," Harry said excitedly. "She's an unregistered animagus. A beetle. She's got the best disguise."
Harry nearly withdrew when he heard the floo activate, but he knew it was likely Hermione. When she stepped through the floo, Draco jumped and shifted to step away from Harry. Harry stopped him with a chirp and tapped his fingers against the top of Draco's wing.
"Those wings are as much apart of them as their arms and legs," Hermione replied. "It would be incredibly painful to remove them. As for reversing the... ah, mutation... We're in the dark. We dare not traumatize these two any further. This is going to take time and research."
The stretch burned a bit, but the pleasure was exquisite. Draco felt delightfully full and his cock was rubbing against Harry's abdomen with every move they made. He kissed Harry urgently, his tongue sliding along Harry's messily.
Harry blinked in surprise. "I assumed that you'd want to go shopping or something," he said. "We rarely leave the house."
"Do you know how hard it is to look that bastard in the eye?" Ron asked through clenched teeth. "Knowing that he tried to poison Harry and Draco. Knowing that he used a tracking spell to find their home. He tried to get through the wards." He swallowed hard. "I know I have to do this, but part of me just wants to use every barely legal curse I can think of."
"Yes," Draco nodded eagerly. "Whatever you're willing to give me." He sighed happily when Harry helped him to lay back, draping his wings over the edge of the nest.
Harry read over Rita's notes carefully. "Four of these names are ministry workers," he noted. "Aside from Grant of course."
Draco frowned, hugging Harry carefully. "If that's what you need," Draco agreed. He glanced at Ron. "We appreciate your help."
Draco sighed, running his fingers through Harry's messy hair. "You can't compare yourself to anyone else," Draco told him gently. "Everyone processes grief in their own way. You went through some truly horrific things that nobody should have been forced to cope with. It's idiotic for anyone to expect for you to come out of that alright. You should be seeing a mind healer."
For three months, Maddie was in and out of the hospital. A medi-witch had finally become suspicious when she realized that Maddie seemed a little wary of her step-father.
Harry's eyes were wide. "My last date was two years ago and it was with a man," he blurted out, his voice slightly panicked.
"This is so much better than the movies," Draco said, smiling softly. "I love you so much," he whispered, not even caring that he was on the verge of crying. Again.
"I only wanted you to be aware of this," Kingsley said. "I'd prefer for you to hear about it from me. You do, of course, have my greatest sympathy for your circumstances. Robards regrets not sending a larger team in."
"Your magic has adapted to the changes in your DNA," Hermione said. "It seems that..." She paused, biting her lip.
Draco stared at Harry with wide eyes.  He couldn’t come up with a single thing to say.  Which was lucky, because he wouldn’t have wanted to miss Harry’s next words.
"Take the deal," Ron said, before Rita could sneer. The interview itself would be worth it. You want this exclusive."
Harry drew in a deep breath, his hands trembling as he took hold of Draco's. "If you're willing, we can get married now," he said.
Ron shuffled over to the couple while everyone else was distracted with presents.  He glanced between the two and then sighed.  “You’re an alright bloke, Malfoy,” Ron said gruffly.
Hermione watched them for a moment as they reached out to stroke each other's wings. Harry's wings were looking ruffled with his obvious distress.
Draco made a soothing cooing sound, gently nuzzling Harry's cheek with his nose. "Just relax Harry. Everything is fine," Draco murmured, reaching around to smooth down Harry's feathers.
Harry turned to look at him in surprise and confusion. Draco merely smiled and continued to run his fingers over Harry's lovely wings. Harry continued to peer at him for a moment before turning back to the film uncertainly.
Draco moaned, tilting his head back and closing his eyes. It felt so very good. For a moment, it occurred to Draco that Harry had clearly had practice with this particular activity, and the idea made Draco rather jealous. He didn't like the idea of Harry with anyone else.
Hermione nearly spat out her drink.  She looked around and spotted the sprigs of mistletoe that hovered around the room.  Just moments before there hadn’t been any mistletoe.  “He’s good,” she muttered.  She hadn’t even seen Draco setting up the mistletoe and a glance around told her that the other guests were just noticing its presence as well.
"Spare me the details," Draco begged. "I don't want to think about the two of you..." He shuddered in revulsion.
At that moment, Harry was incapable of pondering his rotten luck. Because Harry was a toddler and so was his blond partner.
Ron smiled slightly. Harry was surely in a lot of pain, but his first concern was the well-being of his partner. "He's sleeping in the other bed," Ron said soothingly. "Try not to move too much. Hermione will be back in a moment with a pain potion."
Draco was on his feet faster than was probably advisable considering the amount of alcohol he'd consumed. "No," he snapped at his father. "This is Harry's home, and you are out of line." He pressed his palms to the table to steady himself. "We couldn't help what happened to us. It doesn't make me any less your son. And if you think that I could do better than Harry Potter, with or without wings, then you're mental. It's not a degrading by any stretch of the imagination. He's the best thing that could have happened to me."
Harry smiled gratefully, sinking into a chair by the desk. Ron sat down as well, content to wait at Harry's side.
Grant had a brother that had been killed by a veela. But it had been revenge for the man brutally raping the veela's half-veela daughter. Grant had been furious over the Ministry's lack of sympathy over his brother's death. So, he'd gathered some men that shared his disgust with the Ministry. They'd decided that they needed more power to gain control of the ministry and the Veela population. If they could change themselves to have an advantage, they'd have an easier time of it.
"I think it was sort of sexy," Draco murmured. "You just want me all to yourself." He leaned in and pressed little kisses along Harry's jaw.
"You didn't need to do all this," Harry said, watching Neville and Blaise carefully stack the gifts on the coffee table.
Draco sighed happily, wrapping one arm around Harry's neck while his other hand was held in Harry's loving grasp. He cooed softly when Harry kissed his fingers.
Hermione sighed. "I can't accurately predict the gestation period," she said. "Once the egg has reached it's full size, it will... come out," she said with a nervous flap of her hands. "After that, we wait for the fetus to finish developing."
"And I'm so very proud," Harry assured him. "You make the world a better place and I love you more than anything."
Despite the slow, gentle pace, it wasn't long before they both climaxed. Harry carefully pulled out and cleaned them both up with charms before cuddling against Draco sleepily. Draco fell asleep almost instantly, his face completely relaxed for the first time all day. Harry flicked his wand lazily, cancelling the silencing charm and then dozed off happily.
"It's not," Ron retorted. "They were on a mission. They stayed together and the mad bint threw potion at them. Harry had no control over it. But they did protect the others on the team."
Ron scowled, infuriated that Grant dared to speak to them. But, Grant was staring at the bundle in Ginny's arms.
Draco nodded his understanding, leading Harry to the couch. They sat down and Draco healed Harry's hand with a spell. They sat in silence for a while, until Draco realized that Harry had fallen asleep. Smiling, Draco shifted a bit to get more comfortable. When Harry was troubled by his dreams, silent tears rolled down his cheeks and Draco tenderly wiped them away, ignoring the little ache in his own heart.
Harry rolled his eyes. "My nipples aren't sensitive," he said. "It's hardly interesting information."
Harry signed heavily, giving Draco an impatient look. He brushed his hands lightly over his nipples, his eyes widening a bit with the sensation. It was a surprisingly pleasant feeling. So very different from what he experienced with his own body. His own nipples simply weren't an erogenous zone for him. "That's bloody weird," Harry murmured.
Draco forced himself to draw in a deep breath. "Gender aside," he said, "it shouldn't matter. We haven't..." He looked at Harry with a light blush staining his cheeks.
Harry groaned loudly. The stretch from Draco's fingers burned a bit. He hadn't bottomed in quite a while, and never with Draco. But Harry was too aroused for the discomfort to be of any concern. Harry wasn't sure that he'd ever be able to handle Draco touching his wings without getting an erection from now on.
"It can't be helped now," Kingsley said reasonably. "Just take advantage of the opportunity to make up for some of the neglect."
Draco's own attempt was even less graceful. He wasn't flapping hard enough to keep himself in the air. But Harry caught his hands and kept him up. "Flap harder," Harry panted in encouragement. "You can do it. Just focus on your wings."
When movie night arrived, Harry was tempted to cancel it. But Draco seemed to want the comfort of the routine, so Harry prepared dinner and encouraged Draco to rest until the other arrived.
Harry blinked, focusing on his suddenly tearful spouse. "Draco, of course I'm happy," he said with a tender smile. He pulled Draco close, knowing that the blond wouldn't be able to keep it together. Sure enough, he could feel his neck growing damp with Draco's tears. "I'm sorry darling. I was just surprised. Don't cry."
It was completely ridiculous and totally out of hand. How did one come back from this? Narcissa looked stunned and embarrassed. Lucius looked like he wanted to Avada himself. Ron was probably on the verge of pissing himself.
Draco lifted out a tiny baby boy with dark hair. Hermione stepped closer and carefully severed the little cord that was attached to the baby's abdomen and then cleared his airway with a gentle spell. She handed Draco a soft towel. "You should clean him up," she said, tears finally making their way down her face.
Movie night at Harry's house had become a weekly routine. Ron, Ginny, Hermione, Luna and Neville would arrive through the floo and they'd have dinner, drink and enjoy a muggle film. It was always nice for Harry to relax and enjoy the company of his friends.
Draco slipped out of Maddie's room and closed the door quietly. He found Harry standing in front of their Christmas tree, gazing at the fairy lights.
Eventually cake was served and wedding gifts were presented to the newly weds. Friends and family lingered to celebrate, glad that they could be there for Draco and Harry.
"It made me think of..." Harry trailed off, drawing in a shaky breath. "I couldn't stand the thought of it," he said quietly.
"What if he's involved in those wizards doing the dark rituals?" Draco asked pointedly. "Let him think that he's got you fooled, and you may get some answered. If he becomes a bigger problem, you find a way to take him out of the picture."
"There was a team of healers that didn't realize," Draco chided, relaxing against Harry with a sigh. "You can't hold yourself responsible for the actions of every lunatic." He pulled away to look Harry in the eye.
"We wait," Kingsley replied tiredly. "Could I persuade you to care of them until their condition can be reversed?" he asked.
“This is so stupid,” Pansy complained quietly.  “I’ll have to kill everyone just to maintain my sanity.”
Pansy sighed and glanced around until she spotted Harry.  She really couldn’t be angry with Harry.  It’s not as if the whole thing was his fault.  Draco hadn’t told Harry how he felt, so Harry couldn’t be expected to know.  But, Draco had been determined to make it more than obvious to Harry at the Christmas party.  Then again, there was likely a vast difference between Draco and Harry’s definition of the word “obvious”.
"That's not possible," Draco denied, his eyes wide. Harry and Ron were staring at the healers in confusion.
That evening, Harry and Draco went to St. Mungos to visit with Maddie. They were accompanied by Lucius and Narcissa.
"Right," Hermione agreed. "The point is, penetration isn't necessary in this case. Birds mate differently. There are variations between types of birds. But the idea is that the cloacas of the two birds touch. It's very brief but that's all it takes for conception.
Kingsley waited until Harry nodded at him to continue. "Malfoy Senior is threatening legal action against the DMLE," he said somberly. "He's making accusations of negligence and incompetence, claiming that his noble bloodline has been compromised."
"Bird puns," Draco muttered, glaring when Harry snorted with laughter. "Think you're clever Weasley?"
"Just calm down," Harry said, his heart feeling like it would break when Draco whimpered. Draco was so strong. He rarely showed this sort of weakness in front of anyone but Harry. He was always able to keep his composure until he was in a more private setting.
Harry wasted no time in complying. They stumbled up the stairs together, hands seeking whatever skin they could reach. They paused in Harry's bedroom to bring their mouths back together for a deep kiss.
She paused, looking distinctly uncomfortable. "There is also termination if you choose to go that route," she informed them. "I only need you to decide. I'll do everything in my power to make this easier for you. I'll give you a few moments. I need to get a few potions." She motioned for Ron to follow her, leaving the stunned couple alone.
“Yes,” Pansy replied, with a dismissive wave of her hand.  “Aren’t you lucky?  He didn’t even bother with my favorite dessert, and I helped him set up the party.”
Draco merely smirked at her and held the small plate out to Harry.  “The house elves forgot to set this out,” Draco explained.  “There’s more at the table but this is for you.”
Ron glared at him. "I know that," he snapped. "And I have no issue with you being only partially human. You know that. I thought the idea of possibly reversing it would make you happy."
Harry slowly chewed his bite of toast, his eyes unfocused. He was dimly aware of Kreacher hovering nearby, watching anxiously. They both jumped when there was a loud knock on the front door. Harry set his toast down, wondering who would be at his house so early in the morning. Hermione and Ron were known to show up unannounced, but they didn't bother to knock. "I'll get it Kreacher," Harry muttered.
"Draco's just over done it today," Harry said lightly. "Nothing serious. He's just very sore. Maybe next time he'll listen to me," he added, his hands still rubbing in soothing circles.
"I was thinking we could all pay her a visit tomorrow," Ron suggested. "Small groups come in for presents and whatever sweets we can sneak in."
It had been discovered quite quickly that Draco would need to eat a lot more. The egg was absorbing a shocking amount of nutrients, presumably to be able to sustain the baby until it was time to hatch. As a result, Draco ate much more frequently in addition to nutrient potions. Harry was amazed by everything that Draco consumed each day, but he'd rather hex himself than ever comment on it in Draco's presence. Harry liked his bits where they were, thank you very much.
"We felt them tearing through the wards," Draco said, his tears falling steadily. "We floo called Hermione. She came and brought Ginny, Pansy and Luna." He swallowed hard. "We sent the ladies upstairs with the egg. No matter what happened to us, we weren't going to risk the baby."
"Don't," Lucius snarled. "Don't make light of this. Our only son and heir is half bird and debasing himself with this..." He wiggled his fingers vaguely in Harry's direction, failing to think of something unflattering to call Harry.
Dinner was delicious and conversation remained light and pleasant. It was when a lovely chocolate cake was presented that Harry announced the findings of Draco's exam.
Draco turned his body slightly and rested his left hand on Harry's knee while holding his fork up to Harry's mouth, a bit of cake perched on the tines. Harry opened his mouth, allowing Draco to feed him the cake. The flavor was wonderful, but it wasn't nearly as pleasing as the affectionate expression on Draco's face.
A loud snort of laughter from the doorway, momentarily distracted them. Ron was leaning against the wall, grinning wickedly. "Don't mind me," Ron said, nodding to Lucius. "I'm all for responsible parenting. Carry on good sir!" he declared, winking when Narcissa spluttered at him.
"I know," Harry said, nodding sympathetically. "Hermione thinks that some of the bird-like instincts will settle in a few days. She was a little afraid that movie night would be difficult for us." He guided Draco toward the massive cushion that Hermione had brought and they sat down.
"Hello," Draco responded, the L sound rolling off his tongue exaggeratedly. Ron chuckled at the sound, earning a dimpled grin from the blond.
Harry made a low cooing sound, and kissed Draco softly. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry, suddenly desperate for reassurance and comfort. Draco chirped softly, and Harry responded by pulling Draco into his lap.
Harry nodded sympathetically, his gaze flicking upward briefly before he met Draco’s eyes again.  “Looks like you’ve got a bit of a problem,” he chuckled softly.
But now, Draco found himself considering. He looked away from Harry, staring absently at the telly instead. He'd been living with Harry since a few days after their release from the hospital. They were closer than Draco had ever thought possible. They never spoke of it, not really. But they relied on and trusted one another. Draco loved Harry's touch and he suddenly wondered how it would feel for those hands to do more than reassure and sooth.
They shed their clothes quickly, climbing into the nest and reaching for each other. They pressed themselves chest to chest, their mouths meeting over and over. Their hands drifted everywhere; Teasing, loving, arousing.
"Does this mean we can be more than friends?" Harry asked, breaking the kiss but still holding Draco close. "Like... together? A couple?"
As Christmas approached, Draco continued to visit Harry. Occasionally, he took Harry to visit the hospital or some lonely widow. But it was far more common for them to stay in. Draco would request biscuits and hot chocolate from Kreacher and then he'd focus on just keeping Harry company.
After the war, Draco Malfoy had worked hard to make up for past mistakes.  He donated to worthy causes and made an attempt to be friendlier with his former rivals.  To everyone’s surprise, he had started with Harry Potter.  Harry had been wary at first, but he accepted Draco’s apology and after a few months they’d become friends.  They spent a great deal of time together.
Pansy nodded her thanks, ignoring Ron as well.  “It had better be,” Pansy whispered, glancing around at the guests cautiously.  “I never thought I’d do so much to help Draco get Potter’s attention.  Honestly.”
"They are grown men that were subjected to a potion," Lucius retorted. "But that egg holds a baby. Our helpless, blameless grandchild. It doesn't deserve to suffer or struggle because of its blood," he added quietly.
"We are," Draco responded. He paused at the top of the stairs. "McGonagall told me that Trelawney was having trouble after the war. She doesn't have many friends and no family. Christmas is especially hard for her."
Harry nodded in understanding. "Why don't I work on that while Hermione examines you today?" he suggested. He raised a hand to forestall Draco's argument. "I know you can do it, but I would really like for you to relax. Just let me at least try."
"We're not safe," Draco said shakily. "You know that, right? They're going to come after us. I can feel it."
Harry complied quickly, his arms trembling. He gasped as Draco slowly entered him, pausing frequently to let Harry adjust.
"Definitely," Harry nodded, pushing Draco back to relax against the wall of the nest. He lowered himself between Draco's thighs and swallowed his cock eagerly. His fingers were lubed up and he began working them into Draco's opening gently.
Lucius waved her off. "Potter cannot simply go about inserting his penis wherever he pleases," he said, ignoring his son's horrified blush, "and impregnating my son without taking responsibility."
"We'll wait outside," Pansy said, leaving the couple with their egg, Ron and Hermione. "We'll inform the Weasley's and your parents," she told Draco before shutting the door.
"As marvelous as this is, we should get up," Draco said, his words ending on a moan as Harry's tongue lightly brushed his neck.
After a few minutes, one of the healers walked in with Robards, Kingsley and an older woman. This was obviously the grandmother.
Draco dipped his head slightly so that his lips brushed softly over Harry’s ear.  “You make me so happy Harry,” he whispered.
Draco nodded almost frantically as Harry leaned in to press their lips together. It was gentle and sweet and Draco felt like his brain might melt. His limbs trembled with relief as he reached up to cradle Harry's face and deepen the kiss.
That night, Draco and Harry got all of their children into bed so they could enjoy some time alone. The twins fell asleep easily, soothed by the lullaby that Harry sang to them each night. Maddie always wanted a bit of cuddling from each of them before going to sleep. Who could deny such a request?
Ron shook his head. "You two get sorted, and I'll get dinner set up," he said, shuffling past them to the dining room.
"Two pregnancies are hardly shocking," Harry remarked rolling his eyes. He froze when Pansy looked away and Draco cleared his throat softly. "Draco? Are you...?
"A little sore," Draco admitted. "But nothing serious. It was completely worth it," he added, smiling as he watched Harry nuzzle the egg blissfully.
Draco’s cheeks reddened with embarrassment.  “You knew?” he asked.  When Harry nodded, Draco’s stomach clenched unpleasantly.  Harry had known and then brushed off Draco’s advances all evening.  Draco had been concerned that he was being to subtle, but Harry had known!  That hurt.  And then Harry had kissed him.  Had that been pity?  He couldn’t bear the thought of a pity kiss.
"Yes," Draco moaned, slowly sinking onto Harry's cock. "I just need you inside me." He rolled his hips, gasping as pleasure surged through him.
"You've spent the last few months making me feel... cherished," Draco replied. "I don't need anything more. But thank you." He kissed Harry lovingly, so grateful that they'd found so much love together.
"Well you heard the man," Draco said once Harry had closed their bedroom door. "Put up a silencing charm and get to work." He began pulling his clothes off unhurriedly while Harry blinked in surprise.
Harry stared at him for a moment with an unreadable expression. "I appreciate that Malfoy," he said finally. "Thank you."
Ginny walked over and handed Harry and Draco glasses of champagne. Ginny was usually out of town playing Quidditch with the Holyhead Harpies, so they didn't see her very often. As a result, Draco was still a little wary of her. She had dated Harry after all, and Draco was a little possessive. He'd never admit to that of course.
Harry looked at Draco and his breath caught. Draco was looking the baby boy over intently, gently brushing away tears and allowing little Daniel to drool on his robes. "Hello Daniel," Draco said softly. The baby had dark brown curls and blue eyes, much like Maddie.
Harry nodded leading the way into the house. He looked up to see Draco striding toward him purposefully. In the next moment, Draco was in his arms. Harry cooed, hugging Draco tightly.
Harry grabbed Draco's glass and tossed back the remainder of the firewhiskey. It burned down his throat and his eyes watered. "Bloody hell," he gasped. "What a nightmare."
"Robert has gone to get tea," Harry said, hugging Draco and pressing kisses to his face. "Just try to calm down. It's alright."
Harry smiled as he watched James and Scorpius chased their Uncle Ron across the dance floor. Neville and Hermione had gotten married that day and even the little ones were enjoying the reception. Scorpius was flapping his silvery wings ineffectively, his chubby legs not doing a good job of keeping up with his brother. Ron took pity on him and scooped the two-year old up while James laughed and asked to be picked up as well.
When they came to, they were bound and sitting at the base of the bloodied altar. The wizards had their hoods up, keeping their faces in shadow. "You'll be testing our special brew for us," one of the men said in a strange raspy voice.
"Kingsley told me what you were doing and had me monitor you for a few months," Harry explained with an apologetic little smile. "It was clear that your intentions were good, so we asked the Wizengamot to lift your probation on the grounds of 'good behavior'. I never told anyone about it. Not even Ron and Hermione."
"I'm in love with you Draco," Harry said, his voice rough with emotion. "And it's not because of the baby or because of our 'condition'. I want to be with you. Take care of you. No matter what happens, I want to be at your side. I don't give a toss about what anyone else thinks."
"I love you so much," Harry murmured. "There's nobody that I'd rather spend my life with." He guided Draco's head lower to press a reverent kiss to his forehead. "Draco, will you marry me?"
"So... are we thinking this was the Imperius curse?" Harry asked. "Or- Wait..." He cut himself off, going still again. His eyes narrowed as he felt a strange nudge against his senses.
"Thanks Ron," Harry responded, forcing a smile. "And it'll be fine. There are plenty of other options." Draco nodded his agreement but didn't speak.
"It was Grant, but he's gone now," Ron answered. "I really don't think it's an Imperius," he added reluctantly.
Pansy moved to prepare tea, aware that Narcissa was watching her. "There relationship is... more intimate than I would have guessed," Narcissa said carefully.
"Thank Merlin you love the smell of tea," Harry whispered, cupping Draco's face and kissing him softly. "If you hadn't checked, we might not have noticed until it was too late." Draco chirped softly in distress, wrapping his arms around Harry's waist.
Draco made an odd sort of strangled noise and then glared at Pansy.  “Did you tell everybody?” he asked, his voice a little higher than normal.
Harry leaned closer to capture Draco's lips. Draco's support and acceptance meant so much to Harry. The war plagued Harry's dreams in addition to his waking moments. But Draco had become a light in Harry's darkness. This infuriating blond had sauntered his way into Harry heart as if he owned the place and Harry felt no desire to resist.
Harry snorted again. "Yes, daddy said something naughty didn't he?" he chuckled, reaching out to stroke Daniel's soft hair.
Draco nodded his thanks and departed with Pansy just a moment later. He didn't have a specific plan in mind for Harry. He'd asked for the address on impulse, and was rather stunned when it had been given without question. It showed a level of trust that Draco was grateful for. Though, to be fair, it could simply be a sign of how desperate Ron and Hermione were to help Harry. Their anxiety over the chosen one had been quite obvious.
Draco did most of the talking. He didn't mind. At least Harry seemed to be paying attention. Draco talked about his parents, his apothecary and his friends. Harry even laughed quietly while Draco ranted about Pansy's ridiculous matchmaking attempts.
Draco sighed, closing his eyes and letting Harry's gentle hands soothe him. Despite Draco's discomfort with his rapidly expanding waistline, Harry made him feel sexy and desired. They made love frequently and Harry eagerly worshiped every inch of Draco's body.
Draco grasped the front of Harry's shirt and yanked him into a fervent kiss. Sure they were living together and loved each other. But, making plans to further expand their family... It made it all seem... bigger. More life altering. It was important and Draco had no idea how to express how much more deeply he'd fallen in love at that moment.
Draco shoulders slumped just slightly in disappointment.  Luckily, Pansy was quick to step in.  “He doesn’t know what he’s missing darling,” Pansy said, seizing Draco’s hand and pulling him toward the other dancers.
Draco set the little nest on an empty chair in the dining room and took a seat himself. Harry placed the egg down and covered it up with a blanket before moving to his own seat.
"You ogled my bird bits?" Draco squeaked, looking outraged and embarrassed. Ron snorted with laughter.
Appeased, Draco kissed Harry sweetly, mindful of the egg he was holding. He smiled as Harry held out his own arms hopefully. The egg was lovingly transferred to Harry's embrace and Harry settled against the side of the nest, cooing softly to their unborn child.
Once they had eaten their fill, they went into the sitting room for gifts. Draco had purchased gifts for the others, though they were stated to be from himself and Harry. Their guests had brought gifts for Draco and Harry as well. The Malfoys had given Harry a lovely cashmere jumper, a scarf and a warm cloak. Blaise had given him a wand holster with several clever enchantments embedded in it. Pansy's gift contained all of Harry's favorite sweets, and a broom repair kit.
Draco gave her an impatient look. "No bride wants to be upstaged by the pregnant bloke that can't seem to stop crying like a moron."
The sound of the floo activating made both men fall silent. A moment later, Ron and Hermione walked into the dining room. Ron was carrying their infant daughter, Rose.
"No," Draco sighed. "Better to get it over with. Can you just... I don't want anyone touching it. You two are fine," he added glancing between Ron and Hermione, "but I'd like everyone else to... "
Draco turned at the sound of his mother's voice and froze when he saw his father standing beside her, holding a package wrapped in silver paper. He hadn't seen his father since they'd had dinner together. The night Draco had conceived actually. Part of him was upset enough to let his father in on that bit of news, but he resisted. Instead, he held still while his father looked him over with wide eyes.
Draco giggled and pulled away from Harry’s searching mouth.  “Later,” he whispered, pressing a tender kiss to Harry’s lips.
Before Draco could argue, Harry kissed him again.  Their tongues met in a gentle brush and Harry moaned while pressing Draco’s back into the wall.  Draco was delighted by this development, but he was still the host of the party.
"Perfectly serious," Harry confirmed, pulling a small black box out of his trouser pocket. He released Draco and opened the box to reveal a pair of platinum bands. Each had tiny diamonds arranged to look like a pair of wings.
"Don't mention it," Ron replied with a little shrug. "I'll talk to Robards. You take care of him," he said, nodding toward Draco.
Draco pulled in a shaky breath. The outside of the egg had been relatively flexible and soft as it took in nutrients. Now that the shell had hardened...
Ron ducked as a curse zoomed toward him. It was an ominous red color and set some bushes ablaze. Scowling, Ron pressed forward, his wand slicing through the air as he cast spell after spell.
Harry nodded his agreement. He wasn't fond of the hospital, but he'd gone with Draco to visit the little girl several times since her step-father's arrest.
Harry started laughing. The sound had a slightly hysterical edge to it. He doubled over, shaking his head as chortles spilled out of him.
Harry and Draco were glad to return to work, even though they couldn't return to the field yet. If at all. Robards had decided that it would be too dangerous for two winged Aurors to be chasing down criminals. The dark wizards that had attacked them were still loose, and probably wouldn't hesitate to attack again. Harry and Draco were now painfully easy to spot in a crowd.
"He doesn't do it for recognition," Pansy snapped, glancing around cautiously. Luckily Honeydukes wasn't particularly busy at that moment. "He's trying to do some good. Not that it's any of your business," she added, glaring at Ron.
"The story would be so good that she likely won't complain much about you restricting her... embellishment tendencies," Pansy commented.
Harry had begun laying warm, wet kisses against Draco's neck, intending to coax Draco into letting Harry suck his cock right there in the kitchen, when Ron walked in carrying shopping bags. "Hey Ron," Harry grumbled.
A small sound made Draco hold his breath and look down. There was a crack in the egg shell. "Now?" he blurted out incredulously.
"Not a happy thought," Harry mused. He carefully withdrew his fingers and moved to lean over Draco. "I haven't been with any one for nearly a year. And nobody has meant even half as much to me as you do." He pressed a sweet kiss to Draco's forehead before bringing their lips together.
"If that's what he wants," Harry said slowly. "He seems content to stay here, and I'm glad to have him around. I think he just wants to feel that he hasn't lost his parents because of this."
"I'm so sorry Draco," Harry said softly. "I had no idea that you could get pregnant. This is my fault."
Harry climbed into the nest, his wings flapping slowly behind him. He kissed Draco softly, sliding his tongue into his lover's mouth. He pulled back, his hands trailing down Draco's neck in a gentle caress. "Tell me what you want," Harry whispered. "I'll do anything you want."
Luna heard a sound downstairs and went to investigate, returning shortly with Narcissa. "Oh my," Narcissa gasped, looking around at the beautifully decorated nursery.
"I know Harry," Ron said, his tone sad. "I know it's too much right now. But, you're family and we like to remind you that we want you around."
"Even me," Hermione grinned. "I may not have the opportunity to date much, but the desire to be loved deeply is there." She paused, glancing over to where Harry was fiddling with the telly's remote control. "Harry's the same way. It takes a few drinks to get him to admit to it, but he's very much a romantic."
Draco struggled to compose himself. He'd been an emotional wreck with Scorpius too. Stupid hormones. It was rather lucky that the pregnancy portion of this was rather short. Then he just had to deal with being a complete lunatic over a giant egg for five to six months. The joys of parenthood.
Ron sighed softly when he heard Harry's quiet sob. "It's alright mate. Hermione is good at what she does. She'll set him right," he murmured. He maintained his firm hold until he felt Harry relax.
Ron looked over and saw that Harry and Draco looked a bit upset and maybe nauseous. He felt like an idiot. The thought of eating any sort of bird would probably feel like cannibalism. Ron felt bad that he hadn't considered that before opening his big mouth. They were already making so many adjustments, and now neither of them could stand the thought of eating something they enjoyed. Roast chicken was one of Harry's favorites and Draco loved it the first time he had it.
"I've been practicing," Harry said, not bothering to look away from his task. "I was able to get my feet off the ground for a moment."
"Mummy!" Daniel cried out, still held securely in Draco's arms. He pointed one chubby finger at Draco's face. "Daddy bad!"
Ron sat in a chair in Kingsley's office with his face buried in his hands. Kingsley was sitting at his desk, eyeing Ron sympathetically. They hadn't spoken a single word since he'd invited Ron inside. They'd simply sat in tense silence, while Ron composed himself. After several minutes, Ron lifted his head to look at the Minister.
"Hey, I feel bad that Potter and Malfoy are too afraid to leave the house," Grant said with a friown. "They do fantastic work and this was just rotten luck."
Harry shook himself and stepped aside to allow Draco to come in. Draco offered a hesitant smile and walked into the house. "What are you doing here?" Harry asked as soon as he had closed the door.
Harry laughed. "I do actually enjoy it, though I'm glad it's not as simplistic and ridiculous as you make it sound."
"Of course not," Hermione replied. "But, we're not going to force him into all the festivities. He'd be miserable." Ron nodded his agreement.
Draco heaved a dramatic sigh. "Fine, but I exect to be thoroughly shagged so I suggest you get started."
"He's not worried about me," Draco snapped, pulling away. "He doesn't want the Malfoy name sullied with a half-breed. I could be stuck like this for the rest of my life and he's throwing a tantrum about the bloodline. This transformation nearly killed me!"
"That goes well with this," Narcissa said, handing Draco a squishy package in silver paper. He opened it to find a pale green blanket that was pleasantly soft and warm. "It mimics your body heat," Narcissa explained. "When you're not holding your egg, this blanket will keep it appropriately warm."
