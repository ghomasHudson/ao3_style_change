"I will be fine, once you tell me what you are doing waking up my grandson at this early hour," the hour only being ten in the morning and not so early, but Andromeda was up all night, so the hour really didn't matter, "then you assault me with a workman's tool! Now WHAT DO YOU WANT!" Andromeda really didn't mean to scream the last part, but her shoulder was throbbing, her eardrums ached, and Teddy just wouldn't-stop-crying!!!
Kingsley Shacklebolt an imposing man of over six feet of African flesh in Wizards robes stepped through the fireplace, dusted off his hat looked down at Harry Potter and said, "What is this letter about wanting to free the Malfoy's from prison?"
"If you boys are done pissing over each other," Cho surprised everyone by saying, "Dudley and I have a date." So saying huffingly, she tugged Dudley up. She was only able to do so because Dudley was in a state of shock.
A quick toothed smile was shot in Draco's direction and Draco tried to return it, but his foot hit a lone bottle and sent it skidding. The smile left the boys face whose eyes widened in panic.
“Hey not all redheads are Weasley’s. My mum was a redhead.” Hari said when he saw Draco’s look and accurately guessed what he was thinking.
"Stop! You'll only ruin your makeup. No smudging your lip stick." Sheryl said, pushing Draco down in a seat before a mirror.  His reflection scowled back at him.
The Wonderful World of Harry Potter, the characters and images all belongs to the amazing mind of J.K. Rowling and no copyright infringement was intended in the creation of this fan fiction.
“I know what you are doing, death eater spawn. Run along before I have the mind to tell my Godson what you were up to in his room.”
The lights flashed all as one, in quick succession and the music muted. Draco's ears rang in the silence. The second set was about to begin. Hari and Draco exchanged looks. Draco excited, Hari mildly nauseated.
Draco saw the weight of Hari's sadness in his eyes and acted impulsively for a Slytherin. “May I hold you, Hari?” Draco pleaded. When Hari nodded, Draco scooted over on the circle bench and scooped Hari beneath one arm and rested his pointy chin on his curly head. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I'm sure he loved you. He had to be a great man. A superior wizard with sterling resolve to survive Azkaban and keep his wits to escape” Draco tried to sooth and reassure, running his hand up and down Hari's seethed arm.
"Yes, mother's pet...Earl." He drawled out. "Don't get to close, he bites." Draco said darkly. Shaking out his right hand in memory of the several times Earl had attacked him while walking the streets of London to get there.
“Massster Harry Harry Potter, hmn, what an unssspectacular and ordinary name, Massster hasss” Asclepius hissed as he wound himself around the banister first one way and then the other. “sosss, Whatsss a Potter doing in the Most Ancient and Noble Houssse of Black, Massster Harry Harry Potter?”
His hands banged on the tabletop, rattling the contents, and his wand rolled out from beneath some parchment. His hand trembled as he grabbed his wand. Of course, he could just… "Accio, Dittany!" Nothing.
If Andromeda hadn’t warned him this was going to happen, he would have panicked and broken the circle. But his heart felt like it was beating out of his chest, his breathing was heavy, and his green eyes were wide behind his black framed spectacles.
Draco flushed embarrassed. He had very distinct misgivings about why hosting a party would be a bad idea. For Hari and him.
“Mm-huh, sugar whatever you say. You’ve never brought home such a delicious looking friend home to us before or any friend for that matter.” Sheryl winked a gold eyeliner eye at him over the top of Hari’s shoulder.
"Not much, I never blacked out before from consuming too much firewhiskey, but I guess there is a first time for everything. You?" Draco inquired, trying to put his hands in his trouser pockets, only to realize he was still in his pajamas, and
When Sirius Black escaped Azkaban during Harry’s third year, and turned out to be his godfather and not the murdering lunatic out to get him as he and the rest of the world was made to believe, Harry felt ecstatic that he would finally have someone who wanted to call him family. With the Dursley’s he was a dirty little secret; hidden away to live in the broom cupboard under the stairs for 10 years, without even a picture of him gracing the walls of his Aunt Petunia’s and Uncle Vernon’s home. He was malnourished, and beaten, and worse than all the negative attention was being ignored. The teachers in Muggle schools didn’t care when he came to school bruised, or smelly from not bathing, or wearing unclean clothes, or clothes two to three times too big for his small frame. When Uncle Vernon’s boss discovered his existence, his uncle called him
Hari was examining the wand, familiarizing himself with its magic and his own. Examining the hilt he found an unusual symbol carved into it; a snake appearing to eat its own tail. Mr. Ollivander saw him examining the carving and spoke up, “Ouroboros symbolism of the serpent; snake or dragon, devouring its own tail symbolizes the cycle of the nature of the universe; matter can neither be created nor destroyed, creation comes out of destruction, life out of death, the Ouroboros eats its own tail to sustain its now life, in an eternal cycle of renewal.” Draco whom actually took Alchemy at Hogwarts understood the concept quite well, and was studiously happy to discover that he too shared a connection with Hari Potter’s wand, even if it was a design choice.
Draco was both thrilled and terrified of sharing a room right next to Hari. Thoughts of sleeping on the same floor, quickly turned into visions of sleeping in the same room, on the same bed, and more explicit activities came to mind than just sleeping. That line of thought Draco was fighting to stay away from at the moment, because it was completely inappropriate to be having fantasies of he and Hari in twenty different sex positions and counting with his mother
Hari gently took Teddy’s tiny baby palm in his much larger one, and held it steady as Andromeda pricked first her finger, then Teddy’s palm, right over the lifeline. “Blood of my blood.” The white lines glowed a faint orange. Then she pricked Hari’s finger, and he blinked because he was expecting more pain. A drop of blood welled up and stood on his fingertip like a perfect bloody tear drop, before dripping onto the grass at his feet. The misty circle glowed an angry red.
Reaching the fourth floor landing, Hari was able to stumble Draco into his room. He was glad that Draco's room was right next to the stairs, and so they didn't have to take the long trek down the hall.
Hari was cursing as he was forced to take yet another detour in Diagon Alley to avoid the ever growing crowd of people that entered the shopping center in hopes of seeing The Hari Potter. This was exactly why he took sanctuary in Grimmauld Place, he received no privacy out in the public. Now, he was rushing to return to Draco’s side. It wasn’t just Narcissa and Draco that needed a new wand. Hari was currently using Draco’s Hawthorn wand. Hari’s own Holly wand was not performing as well despite repairing it with the Elder wand. Hari thought that perhaps the core was damaged and Hari had only repaired the wood. Maybe Ollivander could repair it, and he wouldn’t need to purchase a new one.
Hari throbbed, his balls ached, and a ball of heat bubbled at his core. He didn’t know how long he would last-- how long the dream would last. He pushed it out of his mind.
Hari's face broke out in a toothy crooked smile. "I like it a lot. I was beginning to wonder if a wand would ever choose me like my first time in Ollivander’s."
“Right, I think I read that in your diary.” Draco bumped his head in the wardrobe. Cursing, he pulled his injured head out, glaring at Hari.
Still listening secretly from outside the Parlour door, Draco hissed in a hoarse whisper. “That’s servants work!”Draco said in a hissing whisper. His facial features expressing outrage on his ‘maybe’ boyfriend’s behalf.
Hari flushed and chuckled embarrassed and amused. Draco was like a child when drunk. "Night, Dray. Put some pants on why don't you"
Please note that this chapter and future chapters mirrors JK Rowling's original Philosopher's Stone, the Harry Potter novel series, and WB film franchise, et al.
“Draco!”  He heard his mother call over the crowd. He turned before opening the door to see just barely the top of his mother’s head as she searched the crowd for him, but she wasn’t looking towards the door, she was looking towards the ground.
"Awe...er...Andromeda, I have something to say that I forgot to mention before. I...uh...kinda broke into your sister's vault and stole an important Dark Artifact that needed to be destroyed in order to defeat Voldemort, and I can't say anything more about it right now...but see that giant hole in the roof, yeah...that was my escape route." Harry said in a rushed whisper.
That comment, so like the mother he knew, startled a laugh out of him. Taking his own handkerchief he kept on hand, he wiped his eyes and blew his nose. “Mother…” He half-heartedly scolded.
But when Draco glanced up, the look he gave Hari was nothing short of a predator on the hunt and Hari was the prey. He smirked, “Like what you see?” He asked with a rasp to his voice. So saying, Draco grabbed Hari’s hand in his hair, securing him there as he swooped down to pop the head back in his mouth.
—plaid shirt, he just knew he couldn't wear it. Throwing the offending garment on the floor he sat down on his crowded bed and ran his hands down his face in frustration.
"Don't call the police, or social services, and don't come looking for me. I'll do far worse to you and yours if you do." Harry didn't like violence, but he didn't know what his magic would do when angry. Making his aunt believe he could hurt them, might keep them from following. Putting the purse back where he got it from, he ran straight out the door. In his mind he echoed Kass's goodbye.
Draco gasped at the tingling sensation beneath his skin. Warmth slowly radiated up his arm, heat intensifying as his magic was forced from his core to the open wound. He was mesmerised as his skin began to knit back together before his very eyes.
Trout was a graying man. Literally, everything about him was gray from his beard to his trench coat. It was quickly assessed that he was also homeless. He slept beneath a pile of old blankets, a torn blue tarp, and milk crates.
"God I am so tired. No more alcohol tonight. I mean it." Ollie says pointing his pen at them over the notepad. He then ripped off the receipt and set it on the table.  Draco was surprised to note that not only was Hari's tab cleared, but the price on the entrées were also halved.
There had been a commission in the Professor's stands. Severus had fallen off his seat, along with several of the other professors.  He was flustered but otherwise fine.
According to my calculations that would be...who am I kidding? I am not doing the math. I am not going to even pretend I am good at math!
However, in my heart of hearts, I secretly hope he wins. He has the better broom, a Nimbus 2000. The fastest broom on the market. I am glad McGonigal chose to bend that rule about first years not being allowed their own brooms.
"Have you heard of Entailed Estate, Mr. Potter? No I can see that you don't. The Townhouse that you inherited was supposed to be passed down to the eldest surviving Black male, as was the vault. If there was no male left in the lineage, it would have been passed down to the eldest surviving Black female. In this case, this should have been Bellatrix Lestrange. I am sure if Entailed Estate was not enforced by goblin binding magic, Sirius Black would never had inherited the house or high security vault 711. Not wanting the house and money to land in the hands of Lord Voldemort, formally known as Tom Riddle, he was able to find a loophole. naming you as the Black heir in his Last Will and Testament, instead of his cousin and faithful supporter of Voldemort."
Please contact our department at the earliest convenience for instructions on times for delivery of the precious remains and temporary access to the Estate Cemetery and Mausoleum.
"You are so going to regret this conversation tomorrow, Dray. Guaranteed. Okay, I'll make all your decisions for now on. The first one getting you to bed. Now put one foot in front of the other. Stand up."
“Oh, no worries dear. You’re not disturbing anyone. I’m normally up with Teddy at this hour anyway. Why are you up, dear? We weren’t going to wake you for another hour or so.” Andromeda asked kindly.
We found what attacked the Unicorn. It was a tall black hooded creature, drinking the blood of the dead unicorn.
"Bad news, Vernon. Mrs. Figg broke her leg tripping over one of her diseased cats. She's at the hospital and can't take HIM." She hissed out, greatly displeased with the situation.
"I'll be damned, is that Cho Chang?" Blaise asked. "You don't suppose she still holds an old flame for our boy savior.
Today is my twelfth birthday. It's a nice day outside. I wish I could be anywhere but studying for this bloody Charms exam I have this afternoon. I wish I was doing something fun, instead I am studying for exams. Exams are always the first week of June. My birthday falls during this time. The summer term, or last three weeks of school are supposed to be easier with all the Professor's grading tests, finishing final grades, and finalizing schedules for next school year. On the thirtieth of June the End of Term Feast is held, and then July first we take the Hogwarts Express home.
"Thank you, bae, but I do have family. Sometimes, family is more than blood. I have Teddy, the Weasley's,
Draco held perfectly still, caught in the act about to masterbate in Hari’s bed. He had to think fast, he risked too much succumbing to his alphas need to possess and scent. The scowl slowly melted away into a sneering smirk.
"If you did, it's not like I could see underneath your trousers." Alleycat was definitely laughing at him now. "Besides, your pretty enough to pass as a girl if you wanted to wear a skirt, but hey, to each their own." Alleycat ruffled Draco's gelled back hair, sending strands and gel flacks askew.
Hari of course finished his entire meal and ate his meal for free. Draco didn’t even make a large dent in his food, and had the waitstaff box the leftovers. A deal's a deal. Hari went to pay for the meal, handing over his shiny black credit card. Sheryl took over the till, accepted the rectangular plastic to complete the purchase. It was not until she was handing it back that she noticed the spelling of his name. For a moment she stood there with arm raised across the counter to hand Hari his card back, stumped.
"No!" Draco said insistently. "It won't be anything deviant. I promise." Draco said raising his hand like a boy scout that Hari knew he wasn't. "I'm not, I promise."
“So, you and Hari?” Narcissa asked taking a seat on the bed and then gesturing Draco down to sit beside her.
Hari let out a shaky breath then continued. “Then we need to stop blaming ourselves. We need to move on from the war, somehow. Clean slate. We have forgiven each other, and the world will just have to deal.”
Said chins were raised high as judgmental eyes were upon them. They came uninvited and unwelcome; Mrs. Goyle and Mrs. Crabbe blamed Draco for their son's deaths and Narcissa for betraying the Dark Lord at the crucial moment in the war which ended in his defeat. The rest of the cortège stood equally quiet in their hostility, the reason for their silence due to the presents of two scarlet robed Aurors standing stoic in the background. After they pay their final respects, the Malfoy's are going to turn themselves in, turning over evidence against known Death Eaters and their accomplices. The Malfoy's decision would have lasting percussions on all gathered; some of whom were innocent, staying neutral during the war, while others had either taken the dark mark, or are the spouses or children of Death Eaters.
Now that they were inside, Draco set down the hindersome bundle of bags, content to know a house-elf will put them wherever Hari needed them.
that would often irritate and inflame the skin, he chose a roll-ball balm and soother lotion combo. He may not have been presented long but his mother had instructed him well on the delicate balance between his skin sensitivities and the type of blocker used. His method might take longer to apply, but it had the added benefit of not causing swelling and redness to the clogged gland.  It was a delicate balance between the amount of lotions applied, and the amount of pheromones that could seep through.
“You see this, Potter?” Draco spat out his name. “That shut you up, did it? Yeah, maybe my hard dick down your throat is exactly what you are begging for, isn’t et, Potter?” Draco growled low in his throat, voice glottal.
“Sheryl…Mama Bear, I…” Hari paused flustered in his apologies when Sheryl swept him up in a massive bear hug.
Nik raised his hands in surrender at the kids anger. "Hey, hey. Your right. I can't make you do anything. And I won't, not if they abuse you. But its not safe for a boy of what? Seven, eight to be running around London on their own."
Nik eye's actually crinkled a bit, "Ha! Dudley my arse. Your real name, kid and the sausage croissant is yours." Nik tempted, waving a steaming croissant that indeed smelled like sausage. "On the house." He said.
Hari felt silly, but as they rotated, three white foggy rings circled them like floating hula hoops. So it must be working.

“Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, you will not be serving a life sentence in Azkaban. It is clear that you have a flair for escaping justice, so instead this courtroom has taken your own testimony into account, you will be subjected to the Dementors kiss, an act worse than death, active immediately.” The double doors at the end of the chamber opened, and a Dementor bookended by two full Patronuses, one eagle and one dove.
“Jesus, kid. Where did you come from? That car would have flattened you.” The owner of the hand holding him steady said. “Where is your mom?” The man, a Muggle, wore stiff blue trousers and a v-neck cardigan rolled up to his elbows.
Potter was standing over him, only in his dreams, grimly looking down at him as he bled to death. He knew this wasn't in his memory. In his memory Moaning Myrtle had yelled MURDERER at the top of her ghostly lungs, and Harry had scrambled towards him on hands and knees panicked and remorseful for what he had done. Not this cold version standing over him, looking down upon him as he bled out. This Potter wasn't the kind, caring, "Saint Potter", the Wizarding World's Savior.
Yes, a second chance. Didn't they all deserve a second chance? Now here they all were living under the same roof. And Draco said he loved him—had even loved him for some time now apparently. Hari snorted with a fond smile on his lips. It had taken him being drunk off his ass to confess.
However, Hari clearly didn't know about the creature inheritance, which means he would not be able to enter into a proper courtship until Hari's eighteenth birthday. If he presents as anything other than beta, telling him would be a moot point, because then his own creatures’ blood would reveal itself. Or if he is simply beta, by that point, the
"Merlin Balls, Potter!" Draco exclaimed loudly, voice echoing off the tiled walls, "Don't you have any decency. We share a bathroom, knock next time, won't cha?" Draco was flushed red, grateful that his back faced Hari.
Harry choked on his grief as he thought about his godfather, ‘His life was wasted…his death was pointless…Sirius!’ Harry’s right hand was clenched into a white knuckled fist at his side, his left hand rising to his face, and his shoulders shook. ‘It’s my entire fault you’ve died… Merlin you were only, what? 36 years old? If I hadn’t been so reckless…If I had taken those Occlumency lessons seriously, I would have known it was a trap…maybe…’
Being best mates, for Ron, meant they had to share such intimate thoughts. Hari did not share the same sentiment.
'Easy enough,' Harry thought as he tossed in a small handful of floo powder and stepped inside the green flames that gave off no heat. Harry's world twisted away as he was flipped horizontally on his heels. He gave one long slow blink as his stomach fought to catch up with the rest of his body. He opened his eyes to see, not rows of books, but familiar carved doors that made up the entrance of the drawing room.
The soft mumble, "May I help you" was just barely made out amongst more mumbles, and talking getting louder. Curiosity got the better of her and she placed a now sleeping Teddy back to bed, and rushed quietly to the door. Harry was standing in the door jam, door barely propped open with a foot as he talked to what sounded like four very aggravated men on the other side.
Draco was forced to push him away with a gentle hand on his chest. Beneath his hand, Draco could feel Hari’s heart beat in a wild tempo. Draco looked from his hand resting on Hari’s chest to his face.
"UP!" his aunt Petunia skreached, before he heard the sound of a brass chain once again scraping against the wooden door, this time by his aunt Petunia and not by magic.
Grimy portraits hung on the walls, the most prominent is an enormous portrait of Walburga Black, stuck to the wall with a Permanent Sticking Charm, and covered with a heavy curtain to try to contain her erratic screaming when disturbed.

"Ah, no. You look so young, but I get that a lot too. I'm nearly forty but I've been told I look younger. And your friend?"
This funeral would be different than the other funerals Hari attended. For one it was Mr. Malfoy who was being buried, someone he loathed since second year. For another, Mr. Malfoy's body was going to be entombed underground in a crypt rather than placed in a pine box six feet under.
“Narcissa Malfoy née Black,” The Prosecutor began, “You are accused of aiding and abetting He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and Death Eaters, hosting Death Eater meetings in your home, and being married to a Death Eater.” Draco didn’t even think that last one was a crime, and looking at his mother, he thinks she thought the same thing. ‘What is that it?’ Draco might be able to get his mother off after all.
Hari gave a humorless laugh. “We were not allowed in Order meetings, Andra. Mrs. Weasley forbade it. She insisted we were too young. To keep us out of the grown-ups hair, she had us clearing this place from top to bottom. Well as much of it as possible without the use of magic. You know, underage witches and wizards are not allowed to use magic outside of school.”
Sheryl was not happy that they were leaving. Hari was sobering enough now to quickly decline Sheryl's offer of calling a cab saying they already called one.
"Oh Merlin, Albus. I hope Hagrid can collect him safely and without incident or I will have your head, even if I have to use Gryffindor's sword to do it. Mark my word, the Board of Governors will hear about it if the famous Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, did not attend Hogwarts, though he's had his name down since he was born."
Hari mistook the shudder for revulsion, and his elation turned into a sulk. “I just wanted to get something for Teddy. Geez, you can wait outside.”
“Mary, Mary.” Oliver panted as he dashed across the street. “Don’t do that, sweetie. You could have gotten hurt.
After a few attempts Madam Hooch gave the go ahead to mount the brooms. I followed instructions to a ‘t’. Longbottom the great lump, couldn’t control his broom at all. His broom was jinxed. It flew up over twenty feet in the air, twisted and flipped and tried to buck its rider. The broom won, and Longbottom fell, his robes catching on an unlit torch, but he survived with a broken wrist. Pansy thought I did it, but how could I when I had the perfect plan. I wasn’t going to ruin it. Potter was going to be my friend I just had to impress him enough.
If anything, Draco's smile became more predictor like. "Dudley, then. Hari had quite a crush on Cho, even asked her to the Yule Ball at school, they dated, kissed..."Draco let that sink in, "how does it make you feel?"
landing would be Narcissa's bedroom as it was the largest bedroom with adjoined bathroom.This room use to be Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's room, but Hari was wise to never mention this to Narcissa afraid of her rejecting the room over a petty family feud. There was also two tiny bedrooms down this hall that use to be Fred and George's shared room, and Remus's. These rooms would too, be unoccupied.
Draco paled. There was just so much food. He looked over at Hari, who looked now at him with laughing eyes. “Come on Dray, dig in, you don’t want me to pay for all that food do you? Draco tried to dig in with as much gusto as Hari but soon fell behind Hari’s quick small bites.
As the date of Draco’s creatures’ inheritance and his eighteenth birthday drew nearer, his mother, Narcissa noticed some peculiar differences in her son’s behaviors. For one, he was becoming increasingly aggravated and short tempered. He became excessively possessive of his belongings, not letting the house-elves handle most of his things. He has become marginally stronger, even with Quidditch practice, and his senses have become sensitive to sight, smell, and sound. He has also become obsessed with grooming his hair and skin. Narcissa knew the signs well; her petit Dragon was going to be an alpha just as she was.
You blocked the floo! Sending an owl is the only way to get a hold of you now. Do you know how expensive Owl Post is from Australia, Harry?
"To the point of committing incest rather than marry outside the family if no other suitable spouse could be found. Great Aunt Walburga and her husband share the same last name before marriage, and in fact, are second cousins." Draco interjected.
“What in blazing hell happened here?” Andromeda shouted, trying a failing to stifle a startled laugh. It was she who tittered and drew Hari's attention in the first place. The two boys were a mess to say the least. Water soaked through muddy clothes.
"No, Hari is waiting for me." Narcissa stared at her stubborn son. He had a wild, desperate look to his eyes. He wouldn't budge on this, she knew.
Hari put down the letter, a shadow of a smile graced his lips as he gently stroked the russet feathers on her head. The owl reminded him a lot of Hedwig, and he felt a pang in his heart at her abscents. He missed his first friend, dearly.
Indeed, Harry was forced to do Dudley's homework each night, not caring if Harry finished his own or not. Uncle Vernon would beat him if he dared make better grades than Dudley.
The people began to be mistrustful of her intentions as Queen, being the most influential person on the king and future kings of the land; jealous of her status, wealth, and beauty.
This was worse than Draco thought. He didn't plan on confessing tonight, he was going to wait. But this silence was too much. What did it mean? Oh no, oh no! "Why aren't you saying anything? Do you hate me now that I've confessed. Do you find me disgusting now that you know I'm gay? "
'This boy...outrageous...what will he do next?' she thought to herself as swayed Teddy close to her chest.
"Well, since you asked so nicely, I guess I could oblige." Draco stood up taking Hari's arm to loop it through his.
were lined in black with silver specs like stars speckled over each eyelid. His cheekbones highlighted with
How do I know all this? Mrs. Malfoy defied Voldemort the first time by revealing important inner Death Eater secrets to someone she felt she trusted explicitly, Severus Snape, her son's godfather; unbeknown to her, a spy of the last sixteen years for the Order of Phoenix under Albus Dumbledore. Since Voldemort's return during the Triwizard Tournament in 1995, Dumbledore had been collecting intel about his life, in memories of everyone alive whom ever known Voldemort; before he became the Dark Lord, his family, and his school days. I've seen his life in its entirely, experienced his emotions, and felt him spiral into insanity; and killed him. I used the memories of a dozen or more people to compile enough information as weapons against him. One such person was Severus Snape, who minutes before his death gave his memories to me. Until those last moments, he even fooled Voldemort, myself, and the rest of the Wizarding world into believing he had double-crossed Dumbledore.
Thinking back on Draco’s pale, smooth, neck, had Hari’s cock twitching beneath the running water. Mortified, Hari looked down.
Trout clamped Hari's thin shoulder with one large hand and led him away. "Look alleycat. It doesn't matter if you're a boy or how old you are. Some Tom's don't care. If a big Tom gets you, they hurt you, just like this here Molly is getting hurt, see?" Trout tried to explain in as easy way as possible.
"What are you blabbering on about, Potter? A diary. Please. I don't have a diary." Draco's ears were definitely red.
Hari was suddenly dragged into Draco's crushing grip as he twisted on the spoke to aparate back to Grimmauld Place. Head reeling from the dizzying compressed journey, Hari held his head and stomach, before Draco dragged him inside and silent stormed up the stairs.
Draco quickly took in a breath. “Oh…” He coughed. “Oh, really?” Trying to cover up his eagerness, he feigned nonchalance. One elegant eyebrow rose as his eyes tracked down his body. “You want my advice?”
Harry was brooding, something she noticed he liked to do a lot, but something else was wrong. "That's not all that bothers you."
He scowled at the familiar features trademark to the Black family, only skipped in his mother; the curly black hair, and pale grey eyes, much like his own.
Either way Harry couldn’t stay out here on the street, someone was bound to have followed him. Some investigative journalist was probably even now taking his picture. It was bad enough before the Battle of Hogwarts with his ‘misplaced’ fame for surviving the Killing Curse and now, after he actually killed the greatest Dark Lord of all times and survived the killing Curse, again; he is even more famous.
A mighty fist banged on the door, shaking its frame like a battering ram. If the door had been weathered or rotted, it might have fallen in; however, it only served at cracking a tiny window within its frame.
It was peaceful at Shell Cottage, maybe he should go there, but it wasn't untouched by the war; Dobby was buried on the beach after he saved everyone's life at Malfoy Manor.
Draco actually frowned. His nose crinkled and his lip lifted on one side in a silent sneer, before he spoke. "You know Hari and Cho use to date right?"
He opened the door and was immediately blinded by the light from outside. The light would attract attention, so he barreled out the door stumbling into an even greater crowd of Muggles than he expected. The noise was far greater, too. Nearly blinded, and disoriented Draco stumbled as far from the door of the Leaky as possible before tripping and losing his balance. He fell to his knees in the gutter. Suddenly, his arm was tugged up and he was pulled to his feet and away just in time for a metal beast to zip past, Draco felt the slipstream of the beast trying to pull him along, but the firm grip on his arm kept him grounded.
Honestly that Weasle should have been wearing dragonhide gloves, he doesn't have as tough of skin as the half-giant. He should have known that Norwegian Ridgeback have venomous fangs. That's what he deserves.
Arlys who was standing behind Hari mumbled, "Oh Lordie, wouldn't that just be a shame to miss out on the tone deaf and squawking gaggle of geese." Arlys said sarcastically.
Draco finally closed his mouth with an audible snap. “Potter, you are outrageous.  How can you just flippantly tell me the Deathly Hallows are real, and then shrug it off that you own one?”
Hari popped his hips and shimmed easily to the beat of the music playing on the wizard's station on the radio. Much to the disgrumblement of Kokoa, who considered the kitchen her domain, Hari expertly navigated around the kitchen, moving easily around the burners, then back and forth from the pantry, cold storage,prep station, and stove top. Draco could only stare.
"That's true, Potter. You are Teddy's godfather and that makes you my, what?  God-uncle?" He ended on a question, perplexed at the bizarre family dynamics that would be.
"Oh so you too are dating, then." Sheryl tugged hard on his hair. "C'iemone! Arlys! You owe me 20 pounds." The salon went quiet.
He lays in bed, looking up at the green canopy that reminds Draco of Hari's eyes. Through the pounding headache he tried to concentrate on the events of just yesterday. He wanted to write all his encounters with Hari down in his journal. Yesterday, he managed to spend the whole day with Hari so he knew he had to be particularly detailed today.
"What happened here?" Hari didn't know he spoke out loud until Narcissa answered, sounding quite amused.
The zoo director personally made aunt Petunia a strong cuppa. Dudley and Piers were huddled under blankets jabbering away, with slushies, Didley's slushie was red, and Piers' was blue. They were no worse for wear. Uncle Vernon was talking to the police.
"No, Pup, no. It's not wrong. Your emotions are never wrong." Sirius said. He looked at his godson, and wished things could be different. That he wasn't dead. That he wasn't just a portrait on the wall that Hari would sometimes talk to. He wished that he could step outside the frame and just hold his godson. Reassure him that everything was going to be okay. And just be there.
Secondly, his relatives did not believe in magic. Magic did not exist. Period. Exclamation mark. End of discussion. The 'm' word was forbidden in his relatives house. Saying the 'm' word would earn Harry a one way trip to his cupboard.
A short time later, Draco untangled himself from Potter’s listless body, pulling out and watched as his own cum, pearlescent, tinged with blood, plodded out of the stretched out, puffy, and ripped hole. Draco raped Potter, violently. He didnt know what came over him. In his fantasy's he's always cherished him, protected him. He's not blind like the rest of the school, has seen the bruises beneath baggy and worn out clothes, when he returns to school after every summer; too thin and starved. Who does he stay with that abuse him so, the Weasels? No even for them, he doesn't see that happening.
to contend with. It was fun sneaking past patrols and finding secluded corridors to enjoy ourselves.”
"Wha-who? Uh...no, I mean, yeah you too." Hari stammered out as articulate as always. To which Draco laughed.
Wrapping a towel around his own hips and another hanging off his neck, Draco stepped to the sink vanity to apply skin lotion to his face, and scented drying powder to his skin, and sleekeazy hair potion in his hair. Before he was done, Hari was already stepping out of the shower, skin a rosy pink over tanned skin. He had the same wrinkled towel from the floor as before he got in. He stepped up to the other sink that shared the same vanity, still dripping wet. Draco stood momentarily transfixed as water droplets ran over tanned skin speckled with white scars over his torso.
“For Merlin's sake, Potter, you won’t be allowed inside once the first ceremony has started; not even to use the loo.”
“Actually, you were betrothed to the younger, Astoria Greengrass. However, if you intend to court the young Mr. Potter instead, I will do everything within my current power to get you out of it.” She cupped her son’s cheek. “je t'aime. I only want what is best for you.” Narcissa said.
Draco found that volunteered information was always more valuable and less costly than coerced answers, sat back to listen.  He was looking a Cho Chang, the witch in the relationship.
Amused at her son, "Mon Petit, I do not think you have to worry about embarrassing yourself anymore than you have before, he couldn't possibly think any less of you than he already does, and he's never thought serious of you before other than believing rightly that you joined the Death Eaters."
His uncle just rustled his hair, proud of his son pulling a tantrum. "Little tyke, wants his money's worth. Just like his old man." He boasted with a pleased grin on his face. Dudley ignored the praise in lieu of opening his presents. A racing bike...a new computer...six computer games...a video camera...a VCR, ah-nd a gold watch.
Even when he prepared the meal himself, the Dursley’s would only allow for him to eat the leftovers, burnt, or foods Dudley refused to eat. When Hari was ten he tried to get away with eating a little extra by purposely burning a few meals. He had become partial to the taste of burnt food. That came to an end when his pigsty of a cousin, Dudley noticed that Hari had been a little too happy with his meals and like the pig he was squealed to his mother. Hari was sent to his cupboard for the whole weekend without any meals, only let out a few times a day to use the restroom.
“It still doesn’t lessen the guilt… I thought…I thought that with Teddy, I could create a family… like how Sirius wanted to do with me.”
His dragon instantly perked up its ears, but try as he might; the wind cared the sound away. He watched as he used magic on some tasks like to
"It's because you ripped my fucking heart out. Okay, Potter! Can't a bloke cry when he's been rejected, huh? It not like I didn't know you couldn't possible love the likes of me. It's not like I even meant to confess, it just slipped out. I'm not a bleeding buggering moron like some people, I knew you couldn't possibly return my feelings. You're not even gay. You have a girlfriend." He wiped the tears from his eyes with frustrated huffs of breath and impatient hands.
It was on one of these days that Hari first met Sheryl. He was browsing the shop fronts and wasting time before he had to be back at the Dursley’s. The voice that hollered at him from across the street was a loud baritone pitched a tad unnaturally higher on a male voice. “Now darling I know you are not looking stealing anything are you?”
“None of that, cub.” She set Hari back down on his feet again, glancing over his shoulder at Draco. With a sly grin, she continued, “I’ll forgive you if you introduce me to your man, here.” She crackled at Hari’s horrified expression.
A gurgling noise drew Draco's attention to a pillow placed on a four cushion couch, beneath a landscape painting of swirling shades of greens, grays, blues, and pinks. A baby was fussing beneath, and Harry was already in motion, carefully picking up the baby and hugged it to his cheek. Turning himself and the baby's face to Draco's surprised ones. Draco saw the baby's eyes; black, and hair; turquoise, and Harry's own emerald eyes sparkling, cheeks red, and grin wide.
"I understand that the bank has issued an eviction notice for the residence of this property. On two separate occasion an employee of the bank has stopped by only to be informed by the neighbors that the owners had left in a hurry in the middle of the night. Now my partner and I are escorting a locksmith and this bank employee to change the locks on all the doors. Unless you can give me proof of residence this instance we will have to ask you to leave or arrest you for illegal squatting."
Shaking the memory, he turned on the hot water in the shower. He smiled as he stepped into the steam filled shower stall, signing as the hot water fell over his tense shoulders and down his back. He relaxed as he let the water fall around him, rinsinsing his body of sweat and dried cum.
Third, scent helps to identify property; by scenting and in turn others scenting you, you are making a claim on what belongs to you, who you claim as friend, family, or lover, and who in turn claims you. Being able to identify the property of an individual is key, because people regardless of gender will advertently (alphas and omegas) and inadvertently (betas or unpresented) scent their belongings. Even if betas and unpresented individuals do not have the adaptive nose structure to smell these particular scents and pheromones they do have them and can scent their belongings by proximity and vice versa.
They wheeled into an empty alley just a block away. Dismounting and unbuckling their helmets, Hari snickered at Draco’s attempt to fix his hair in the tiny mirror on the bike. “Would do you loads better, Potter, if you carried more about your appearance. You look like you just rolled out of bed with that pigeons nest for hair.” Draco chided.
Draco took the opportunity to whisper in Hari’s ear. “Hari, love." Draco tried, "You have to know something.  The reason I pulled away was not because I didn’t want to go baby clothes shopping, but it was because I had too. I realize, now more than ever your ignorance of the wizarding world, but in our world there is something called
Draco's hand moved in tangent with his bobbing head. Messaging Hari’s cock in slow ministrations; hand stroking, pumping, thumb swirling over the red head of Hari’s straining cock, nail grazing the slit.  Wet trails of saliva and Hari’s own pre-cum secretion only aided to the smooth glide of flesh on flesh and obscene squelching sounds that echoed with their loud breathing in the empty and vast room open to the stars.
Kreacher poured him a splash of mysterious brown liquid into a crystal tumbler. Kreacher handed harry the crystal, looking up at him expectantly.
"STOP! FREEZE! DON'T MOVE!" He hallared louder than even he expected, his adrenaline high and air cracking with electricity.
Hari moved to Draco’s other side, looking sideways at Draco for approval when his hand moved towards a hanger. Draco only nodded and continued searching. Hari let out a breath and pawed through Draco’s clothes. His eyes widened, and his mouth opened softly in wonderment. His hands slowed down to pet the soft material beneath his hand.
So I laid in wait for them in a hidden nook outside the third-floor corridor. I do not know what is with the trio and midnight, but sure enough, half past I saw the locked door open on its own.
"Look, how about I run ahead and get some snacks from the corner shop, then I'll wait for you and Zambini at those tables there?" Hari says gesturing with his chin the convenience store on the corner.
on the desk the Bogart hid in. It was too much for Harry. Wand slipping from fingers gone blue and numb, Harry collapsed in a heap on the floor.
“How ever did you find this place Hari?” Draco said, still not taking his eyes off the statue. He was half convinced that it was made by their kind. He was waiting for the sculpture to become animated and prove his own point.
It didn't appear that his mother and aunt even saw the exchange. Draco glanced down with a secretive smile on his face.
Which is why Harry was standing across the street of Grimmauld Place, because the press couldn't find him there. Sure, the rest of the Weasley's, Hermione, Kingsley and a few other surviving members of the Order could find him there, if he wanted them there.
"I am not lying! I have it written in my journal. I have the scars to prove it." Draco was incensed. He rose up, dropping Hari's legs from his lap, and began to strip, slapping Hari's hands away when he went to stop him. The marks of the caning was evident when he presented his posterior to Hari. Horizontal lines marked up his lower back, buttocks, and thighs.
“I was thinking for our, uh, …first date?” He faltered over the word date. They were not dating, not yet. This was just a trial, but what could he call it other than a date? “Going to the cinema and maybe dinner after?” It felt so lame even as the words left his mouth. He blushed in embarrassment.
“I presume you said you wouldn’t be caught dead walking next to him, or the like. Those are words you say to your affluent, Slytherin friends who would appreciate your keen eye, not our sweet Hari.” Narcissa advised.
Harry killed Voldemort; he hunted and killed each of his soul fragments, and then killed Voldemort. Or did Voldemort Kill himself? Harry never casted the Killing Curse during the war, only disarmed. Twice; Voldemort’s curse was rebounded against himself and twice Harry survived the Killing Curse. ‘Neither shall live while the other survives.’ The problem was, Harry didn’t want to survive this last time. He was the last Horcrux; the last fragmented soul of Voldemort lived on inside himself. In order for Voldemort to be killed, Harry had to die first. Harry had enough of standing to the side while everyone around him died. He took comfort in knowing he was going to die. Have Voldemort kill his own last soul fragment, and then Harry was going to let someone else finish him off. Harry didn’t want to kill, only disarm so someone else could kill. Harry was faced with a new conundrum; he lived when all he wanted to do was die.
All Andromeda could do was take Teddy and place him in a bassinet, hold Harry tight and rock him in her arms; shushing and whispering her forgiveness, and trying to explain that it wasn't his fault, or that there was nothing he could do. Tears fell from her own eyes, finally accepting the death of her husband and daughter, and no longer wondering what happened to them. Andromeda's emotions were like that of a bone with a clean break, that could now mend with time. Emotions still raw with the loss of so many people she held dear, she had some idea of how Harry felt.  Harry didn't have a clean break, and it would take longer for his mental and emotional injuries to heal.  Andromeda vowed to help this broken boy heal.
Mon Mère told me a secret when she gave you to me. She said that it is okay to have friends, because I may be a Malfoy, but I am also her son, and an important member of the Ancient and Noble House of Black. One of the last legitimate heirs, too, no matter my name, the blood breads true.
Harry looked on in dread for a second, thinking he was not going to be able to climb onto the counter and unlock the padlock without waking the rest of the house up. But then a light dawned in his head. Harry was magic. Surely if he used magic once, he could do so again. The padlocks on the pantry required a key. while the combination lock on the fridge had a dial between zero and ninety-nine, with a three digit combination, and no numbers could repeat that gave Harry 99*98*97= 941,094 possible combinations.
For a second, Nik's kind amber eyes came to mind. But when the man spoke, Harry could hear that it was not the sound of Nik's voice, but a strangers. It didn't sound crazed, "Come on down, Alleycat. It's safe."
He thought. In a desperate attempt to escape before someone from the wixen side discovered him, Draco bit down on the exposed skin of the man’s rolled up sleeve. The man didn’t taste dirty or unwashed as his father told him. He was let go, and Draco stumbled back, quickly turned in any direction but there, and scrambled away.
"Now, Dudley. You see this year some of them are quite bigger than last year." Uncle Vernon sweated, trying to appease his irate 11 year old son.
Draco dismounted removing his helmet and let his hair escape its tie and fly loose around his face in the late evening sun. Draco wanted to confess, but it was a very real possibility that Hari would reject him. Draco was scared of that possibility, because if he confessed and was rejected he would be forced to leave. His alpha roared in his mind,
The bathroom was large. Not as large as the prefect bathroom, but large enough that it had a bathing area separate from the toilet and double sink vanity, with a dressing area on the side. The giant lion clawed bathtub was big enough for two, brass pipes gleaming against red royal flush porcelain. There was also a very nice shower, separated by fogged glass to the right of the tub. Setting his bathing items on the bench in the sectioned off dressing area with towel closet to the left of the tub, he leisurely stripped out of his cum crusted clothes while he waited for the tub to fill up with frothed and scented water. Steam slowly filled the room.
affects you.” Bill’s words were said almost absently, musingly, but the sharp look in his eyes let Draco know he knew exactly what he was doing. Draco swallowed the billows of smoke in his mouth, hacking uncontrollably. Bent at the middle, Draco looked up through watering eyes. “You can’t act on your feeling at the moment, but I don’t trust you. So I’ll be keeping a very close eye on you.” Bill stepped back, grabbing his dusty bag from the entrance floor, shaking it off with one hand, Bill placed his other hand heavily on Draco’s shoulder. “Malfoy, I don’t think…I don’t think Sirius ever got around to telling Hari about our blood.” Bill was of course talking about the vast majority of Wizardkind whom had some resemblance of creature blood in their genetics.
I first met Draco Malfoy before the start of First term in Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions, at the early age of eleven. From that moment on, I saw him as a spoilt, rich prat, who believed that because of his wealth and pure-blood status he was better than everyone else and had the right to bully those he deems less than himself.
Smiling ruley, he swiped a strand of long hair off the parchment he was quickly etching Hari’s carelly menstrations with Teddy with charcoal, and tucked it behind his ear. Third year he stopped wearing his hair like his father, a very subtle disobedience showing he didn’t agree entirely with his father. Now he’d have to change his hair again, or else risk being mistaken for his father on the streets and cursed in the back.
There are seven players; one Keeper who guards the three golden hoops; three Chasers who handle the Quaffle and try to score points by making it past the Keeper; two Beaters who job is it to keep the Bludgers away with a tiny wooden bat, and the Seeker whose job it is to catch the Snitch and end the game. There is no time limit, the game can be over within minutes of the referee blowing the whistle, or days. There are no back up players, so if the Keeper is knocked unconscious their hoops are left unguarded, or if the Seeker is knocked unconscious then it is left to the other teams Seeker to end the game.
The room was framed by stars. No that wasn’t right. There were no walls, instead the room was open to... the cosmos with each constellation illuminated by their own starlight. And yet the
The same hand then followed the line of Hari’s body up and then back down. Fingers glided over the expanse of Hari’s chest, descended down to tweak one perk nipple, then lower still to trail fingers through his happy trail, stroking Hari’s sated and limp cock.
“I name Edward Remus Lupin, my godson, heir to the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black.” The mist changed from white to black briefly, then flashed back.
Before he knew it, Draco was being pulled to the nearest shop, having completely overlooked the sign and door to the Leaky Cauldron. Instead, the man pulled the door open to a used book store, shouting, “Hey, this blonde kid belongs to any of you?” Panicked now, Draco began tugging desperately at his arm.
"Justin" Hari says a little dazed. Justin Finch-Fletchley was a Muggle-born Hufflepuff in the same year as Hari and Draco. He had never got along with Justin for obvious reasons, but Hari's relationship with the Hufflepuff was estranged ever since Hari set that snake on him in second year, -Hari did not-so the rumor's Justin spread accusing Hari of being the Heir to Slytherin. Since Justin was later petrified by the Basilisk, but cured by Mandrake Restorative draught. That tension never dissipated between the two.
Today was the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff Quidditch match. Okay so the day didn't go without incident. Longbottom caught me snooping around the library when I was looking for Harry. So, I told him I've been looking for someone to practice
Draco and Narcissa continued down the drive, Narcissa never faltering in her stride. “Mon petit, be a darling and grab Earl for me.”
Draco and Hari laughed awkwardly alongside the salesperson. They really didn’t know what they were doing.
“It's alright to nap. We don’t expect you to eat all day. This afternoon we’ll play some games.” Andromeda says. “Please take Teddy to the hammock between those trees. We don’t want him in direct light too long. Understanding immediately Hari pucked Teddy eagerly from Andromeda and flitted to the shaded patio set. Indeed nestled between two trees was a large hammock.
I remember searching the stands for a professor to see if one of them would help, several of them had been moving their lips pointing their wands, Flitwick, McGonagall, SEVERUS!!!
That was two years ago, and now Sheryl stood in the exact same position waiting for the slightly older teen, nonetheless skinny with a mop of black unruly hair, to look at her. The tiny bruised teen had wiggled his way into her heart, and when he never returned after that outburst, Sheryl was worried something had happened to him, but she didn’t know where he lived, or how to get in contact with him. The only thing he knew was the tiny underweight and abused teen went to some private school in Scotland. But that wasn’t until September and it had only been July. Maybe his friends had come got him early? That was what she told herself.
"We haven't spoken in person in over twenty years. We use to send secret letters back and forth, once or twice a year. I was disinherited. I lost my inheritance, my dowarey, my family. But when the Dark Lord rose to power again, they stopped. I haven't written to my sister in about three years. It's too late to resume contact anyway." Harry looked up questionly at the last part. "The whole Malfoy family was arrested for being Death Eaters."
“Somehow, I forgot how depressing this place is.” Hari whispered as he rested his brow against the filthy wall unthinkably. Draco followed Hari.
"Before you sign those papers, I must add that you may be able to change full benefactory if you produce a blood heir. As of right now, you are the benefactory of the Potter and Black vaults, but if young Edward Remus Lupin had been born before Sirius Black wrote his will, Entailed Estate clause would have seen to it that Teddy inherit the Black vault instead. You can change these documents to reflect an even split between the vaults, so any rivalries won't develop over who inherits what. Would you like a general contract of what we just discussed drawn up now, and changes can be added on at any time?"
Draco giggled again, “Oops.” Not even looking Draco reached back felt for the prick on the top right of the spiny journal and a drop of his blood opened the journal. "Wait," he said as he took back the journal, and writes something in hastily in shorthand with a quick-fill pen so he wouldn’t forget. It read:
There was a pause behind Hari as Draco gathered the words. “But with the blood-adoption, you are...well, blood and so Mother and Aunt Andra say I can tell you. The story is true. I and my mother can turn into dragons.”
There goes that assumption that Saint Potter was raised in secret by the Weasley’s. Arthur Weasley as guardian would have been able to explain…
“Do you swear to respect  the wizarding traditions of the two Houses, to the best of your abilities?” Andromeda asked.
Harry shrugged, he wasn't going to argue, he can see the fairness of the goblins actions, it was all neatly and easily listed, and summarized at the bottom of the top document. As long as his friends didn't get punished for what was his idea anyway he was fine with however much he had to pay. Turning the page over, Harry nearly swallowed his tongue at the amount of galleons in millions listed in his vault. Ocean waves crashing into his eardrums was loud in his ears as he faintly hear the chieftess continue.
“Me and Hari.” Draco said with a sudden radiant smile. His smile slipped into a worried frown. “You don’t mind that I intend to peruse…this with Hari rather than be with a witch?” Draco asked his mother, tentatively.
He never broke eye contact, glaring at Hari over his meal. Hari got the hint. He wouldn't let go. He nodded his understanding.
"Wai...what? How did you know. You thought the Weasley's abused me? They would never!" Hari was outraged.
Draco took a quick assessment of the barbeque restaurant. Sheryl’s Place was a lot more spacious than he initially thought. There was a bar with open kitchen where three staff was busy cooking over open flames, their backs to the customers. A dozen or so square tables were spread out evenly, with a few tables lining the windows. Hari and Draco were in the only alcove seating, a tight fit sitting side by side, but Draco felt safer facing the room and street at large. Sentiments that Hari obvious felt, because he didn’t move himself, or demand Draco do so instead. It was so much different than Draco have ever visited before. He decided he liked it.
Draco’s heart broke for his mother. For the children she lost, and the siblings that he never got to meet. He read the educational material on the different dynamics. He knew that ova fertility rates were low in female alphas, but to hear a firsthand account of it and by his own mother. Oh he wished he had his father soulless body next to him so he could castrate him, or rip out his lungs, his bowels, his heart, and feed it to him. But it had been weeks since the Dementors kiss and his father’s body probably already withered away from lack of food in a coma. Not knowing what to do, he only squeezed his mother tighter, unaware of the silent tears that left wet trails down his own cheeks.
Draco's lips wobbled and he didn't even know he was crying until he blinked and his blurred vision cleared for just a moment. Hari's voice was smooth and soft, but it was the lyrics and the meaning behind the gentle crooning of the dark haired boy on stage that caught him up in the music. It wasn't a power ballad that Arlys just sang or the others in the earlier sets.
Before Harry could clear his tattered trainers over the edge of the first landing, he felt a grip on his ankle and then the tug that had him dragged nearly off the landing altogether, if it wasn't for his desperate fingers, grasping the bars at the top of the ladder. He couldn't help the scream that tore out of his throat.
Narcissa shared a look with her brunette sister. “Do you think we should try the counter-curse for the
That as far as I heard, before I stopped in my tracks the rest of what they said quickly moving out of earshot. Fluffy. stone. I thought whatever he was up too earlier that term was resolved two weeks ago.
"You could say that." Draco says leaning over to kiss Hari's cheek, looking side-eyed at Cho to see her reaction as he rubbed a thumb over the back of Hari's neck possessively.
Norbert?!!!! He calls her Norbert!! Are you blind. Do you know anything about dragons. Clearly she is female.
100 pence (p)[plural for penny sterling] to the pound (£). Notes come in £5, £10, £20 and £50. Coins come in 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 and £2.
A ways of away, or at least he hoped it was he stumbled past a alley and his shirt was yanked once more by the collar. At this rate his shirt would be stretched past
Hair suddenly spoke up interrupting his musing. “Are you ready? I, ah want to beat the crowd in Diagon Alley. To you know…er … not get mobbed.” Draco had to stop himself from laughing, were did Hari’s articulateness go. He settled for a smirk.
"I've heard you hum a pretty tune or two. You're voice has got to be amazing" Alice continued to gush excitedly.
The two house-elves bowed in unison, “Good morning Master Hari, good morning Master Draco…” The female house-elf paused, not knowing who the third wizard in the kitchen was, while the male said, “good morning filthy Blood-traitor William Weasley.” He then banged his head on the leg of the table numerous times between words, “Sorry Master Hari, Kreacher is punishing himself accordingly. Master, tells Kreacher time and time again not to call any of the Weasley’s Blood-traitor.”
Hari, ever modest says, “Well I didn’t even know the charms, and Kreacher had already started on the basement. We still need to clear the ground floor now that Dumbledore’s spectre is gone from the foyer. Whatever is down there, anyway?” Hari inquired.
The sight had his heart shuddering in his chest, for Hari had the most unhindered look of pure love and adoration for his own Godson. The infant, two months old, was laying on his stomach, arms sprawled out in front of him, legs behind, as he lifted his wobbly neck with great effort.
As the queue grew shorter and their destination nearer, Draco began having doubts. Not about entering Diagon Alley, but his other nefarious plans to sneak away from his mother and visit Muggle London. If his father had been with him, he’d never have the chance, and since he knew he’d get caught eventually, never again.
Draco planned on following Sheryl's rules explicitly. Firstly by not leaving Hari's side. Secondly by not allowing anyone to dance with Hari. He did this by pulling his lip up and snarling at a particularly pushy douche who tried getting in between he and Hari. Yeah, Hari wouldn't be going off with any strangers or accepting strange drinks that could have been poisoned with any type of substance.
Draco seemed to know what would pleasure Hari more than he did himself and Hari tried not to think about what that meant considering this was a dream.
The club erupted in cheers and whoops from every level. Draco covered his ears and laughed at the excitement on everyone's faces. The shot of vodka and beer loosening his nerves. He shared a smile with Hari.
Severus's eyes were emotionless, but perhaps there was a softening around the mouth. He let out a long sigh.
I'm going to be updating the tags soon to include Transgendered OC characters and pansexual relationships (Non-main characters). I always pictured Sheryl as a bisexual transgendered woman, and I explain what that means in this chapter. She is dating a pansexual woman. This is a sensitive subject and I am NOT an expert in all things LGBTQ+. I just wanted to be clear in case anyone takes offense to it when I say Sheryl drags them to a Drag Queen karaoke night. Drag is different than cross-dressing. If you want to tell me more about these two particular subjects, please do so. Derogatory or just hateful comments will be deleted. Thank you for your understanding.
Hari's throat tightened as memories of sixth year swam into mind, Draco sprawled on the bathroom floor with blood soaking through clothes and floating in inch high water around him. Hari's eyes prickled with tears. "I'm sorry." He choked out once.
"Welcome, Mr. Potter. It is a great honor to have the great savior in my humble bank." Harry was confused, was the female goblin being sarcastic, or was she leading him into some type of sense of security before locking him underground for him to starve to death, perhaps become a ghost to haunt the underground walls of Gringotts. His imagination was going wild with possibilities, he tried to whirl his attention back to the very serious matter at hand.
An undetermined amount of time later, Hari paused in his reading. In fact his whole body paused. The hand in Draco's hair stilling.
“Ha, Potter you have a special named after you, you must be a regular then.” Turning to Sheryl, trying to spare Hari the pointless argument, “Ma’am, I’ll have the Harry Potter Special, please.”
The boy and his mother shared similar fair looks with hair so pale that many wixen speculated about Vily ancestry, though the owners of such trademark hair, the Malfoy’s, would swear on their fortune this taint on their bloodline was absurd and their blood could be as pure as snow tracing back five generations or more.
Grateful for a momentary reprieve, Andromeda carefully arranged Harry's awkward arms in the proper position to hold a newborn. It was adorably obvious that Harry Potter had never held a baby before as he stiffly held his godson for the first time, swaying from the shoulders without moving his hips to try to soothe the crying baby.
Then they waited. Suddenly the fireplace burst into green flames and the long nose, big eared silhouette of a house-elves head appeared.
“Awe… but Kreacher I am not a Black, my last name is Potter and I have no family it’s just me.” Harry mumbled as he chugged the water down, trying to get rid of the sour taste of vomit.
Draco would not have called Crabbe and Goyle close friends, although they spent over ten years together, they were not on first name basis. Their families had arranged their meetings pre-Hogwarts years, with clear expectations. Malfoy’s do not have friends they have people indebted to them. Draco had an arrangement with them; they would be Draco's lackeys and bodyguards, and in return Draco would help them pass their classes and get better than Troll on their OWLs and NEWTs. Draco remembered that Severus had given Crabbe and Goyle detention the first day of sixth year for not passing Potions to move onto NEWT level class. Either way, Draco owed some kind of responsibility to the two boys who would never grow into men and gain their inheritance; they chose to follow Draco and died because of it.
Not that most dreams followed reason to begin with, but as dream logic went; he was aware that he was in a dream and felt the compulsion to move forward. His body had no choice but to follow.
Draco wasn't listening though."That's a great idea. You make all the best decisions. I make the worse choices." Draco slumped a bit more, but then perked back up, nearly jostling Hari over the railing. "I know, you should make all my decisions for me."
Hari paused in his mad pacing. That vain prat could probably dress in the dark and still match impeccably.
Draco had an epiphany. Did Hari Potter grow up Muggle? Was that it? Was that why he was oblivious to so many things? The whole wizarding world believed that he was tucked away, and sheltered. He had to snort at that statement. Sheltered? No, not with those bruises he tried to hide from everyone. So the Golden Boy was not raised in a wizarding household.
Hari eventually instructed Draco to get up and find some other objects to play with Teddy. That was when he found the puppets.
"When Tom Riddle as Lord Voldemort took over the Ministry of Magic, he also took over many positions in Gringotts that rightfully belonged to goblinkind. There certainly would have been a third goblin war if humans did not return Gringotts back to the hands of the goblins. So first off, thank you for defeating Lord Voldemort, and returning Gringotts to its natural owners." Did Harry really do all that, end two Wizarding Wars and prevent a third Goblin War?
Becoming apprehensive at her lack of words and fearing that Andromeda would not at least allow visitation rights to his godson, he rushed trying to convince her to allow him in some parts of Teddy's life. "Look, Andromeda...or if you'd rather stay here, I will pay your mortgage outright, the back amount and the full loan, no strings attached, all I ask is that I be apart of my godson's life...Please?!" Once more he broke down on a sob, "Please?"
Hari does all the cooking for the Dursley's but is only aloud scraps or unwanted food from the table. Hari purposefully burns food so that he can get a little extra food whenever he can. He gets discovered and as punishment Hari's aunt feeds him raw and spoilt meat. He is forced to eat it, and gets food poisoning. He goes in and out of consciousness and discovers that this is not the first time he had been abused enough to warrant a trip to the hospital. Hari's memories had been altered so he wouldn't remember the incident and others by Dumbledore.
Hari blinked opened his eyes, to the night illuminated by the light of the quarter moon, and the red glow of the fire. He felt different, as if he was connected to the earth beneath his feet, and the townhouse behind him. He realized he could feel the wards and all the inhabitants. He felt the connection the House-elves had to House of Black and its master; him.
With a slow smile spreading across his face in genuine enjoyment, Harry said, "You know what Kreacher? I would love to eat breakfast outside." And so without any ceremony, Harry stood up finding his alcohol induced migraine reduced from screaming pain, to mild roar. "Wow!" was all he said as he stepped out onto the terrace patio, the scenery taking his breath away.
It was a nice retreat from the June heat inside the reptile exhibition.  cool and dark. All along the walls were lit windows showcasing snakes and lizards from all over the world and various colours and sizes. They crawled, hung, slithered, and hid behind, in front of, next to, on top of, and beneath various wood fixtures and rocks.
Alice winked then spoke louder. ""I can give you all types of tips and I have a monthly membership to Big Boi's Toy's. I can hook you up with some free stuff. I have a whole bunch of different type of toys for our sexy times and if Sheryl wants to be held down for a good shag, I have cuffs and ropes and a nice sized dildo belt to...  " Alice continued to chat chipperly.
For once Harry's hair wasn't a wild bird's nest, but that was only because the strands were to greasy to curl properly, and it itched at the scalp. No lice, thank you very much, but the feeling was similar to the crawling sensation over his scalp.
With a tightening of the lines around his mouth and a hard glint in his eyes, Harry Potter opened the gate and took the six steps up to the front door with only a silver snake knocker, doorbell, and no doorknob. The door opened ominously on its own into a dark hallway, which matched Harry’s mood perfectly.
“Would you believe me, if I said I was a randy teenager once as well, and there are ways to get around that?” Draco hunched his shoulders and just barely managed to restrain himself from covering his ears. Narcissa barely restrained a titter of amusement at her son’s discomfort.  Narcissa schooled her face. “
"Oh no, if I don't follow through, I can't see Hari dressed up either and I can stand the humifaction for one night."
Tittering laughter met his ears. He took deep breaths, closing his eyes briefly. He tried talking himself into believing this a spa treatment as to feel more comfortable with the situation.
Draco was the first to break eye contact. He fidgeted a bit jostling Hari's left arm in the process. Once more, Hari remained quiet on how close Draco was.
They both declined assistance to their “car”. Both of them were eager to get home to Grimmauld Place and be with Teddy.
When the vase crashed to the floor in the living room, Harry had been running away from his cousin. He ducked around the vase and narrow gap behind the couch, crawling to the other side. His cousin was too big to fit behind the couch, but that didn't stop him from trying. It was then that the vase crashed to the floor, no doubt by Dudley's flailing leg.
"Mother! Can you just help me, already. I have to meet Hari soon. He's not of age, I can't explain these injuries to him." He begged.
Draco slammed his hand against the door, caging the smaller boy in. Draco pulled out his wand and rolled up his sleeve, revealing the Dark Mark.
The five new Queen's were paraded on stage. Aryls was first in line, proudly strutting around. Aryls said she was dressed as Padmé from a Star Wars. Draco had no idea where that was, but when the DJ made the announcement calling her titles as scripted, "Her Royal Highness, Queen Amidala and her excellency, Senator Padmé Amidala of Naboo!" The crowd cheered.
The second time he used his magic to pop the lock on the pantry was easier. He was just about to use the same technique to do the combination lock, when an idea flew into his brain. With a shit eating grin, Harry waltzed  over to the fridge and calmly began to spin the dial. Dudley's birthday was the next day. He bet he knew the combination. When he heard the soft click of the lock, Harry grinned in toothy triumph. The combination had been 24-06-80.
If I ever find out who is abusing him, I'll curse them with the darkest curse I can find in the Malfoy Library.
Draco snickered and leaned down to steal another kiss from Hari before his time alone with Hari was taken. Not a moment too soon, either, for the sound of squealing rust hinged doors creaking open behind them and the dark halo of Andromeda’s head peeked from around the door.
“using the knockback jinx to freeze and then repel the Doxies from the curtains, and a gentle breeze swept them out the window along with over a decade of dust. They would be someone else’s problem now.
"M'not, yu'r wasted." Draco sulked as he finally caught the offensive drink that eluded his hand before. As he went to retract his hand, his night robe rolled back to reveal a white bandaged hand. Hari's gasp was the only warning he had before his hand was snatched up in painfully strong hands.
“Welcome to The Angel, London’s non-stop shopping destination in Islington.”  Hari chirped out as if reading an ad in the Daily Prophet.
“I don’t want any trouble here. I just need to purchase a wand. I am a paying customer. Your uncle’s wands are the best in the UK, my family has continued to use this shop for generations, and I intend to continue. Please just let me make my purchases and I will leave.” Draco now pleaded. He desperately wished that Hari would arrive soon.
I learned my first lesson about being the Malfoy heir. I had to succeed by all costs. My grades were excellent, but I had failed by not making the Slytherin team. Forget the fact that First years were not allowed to have their own brooms, or try out for their House teams. If Harry Potter could do it, then so could a Malfoy. And Malfoy's could and would do it better.
Hari seemed to be lost in the movement of the song. He wasn't particularly moving farther than a foot away from Draco at any one time, sometimes his hands around Draco's neck or on his hips. Although Draco had no idea how this was considered 'dancing' he had plenty of training in the formal ballroom dances. Sometimes Hari would grab his hand swing out and twirl beneath it if the mood struck, this was completely different than his training. Hari's body moving with hip pops and shoulder and arm shimmies.
A boy stood beside his mother in the queue at the Leaky with suppressed anticipation. A month before his eleventh birthday, he received his letter to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Of course, his parents sent in his acceptance letter. Now nearing the end of July he was finally going to get his school supplies.
Draco actually choked on air. It was the only reason he could come up with for why he was coughing over nothing in his windpipes. “You...you want to go further?” Draco sputtered, and took a moment to fight down his dragon’s outrageous instincts to kidnap Hari right then and there, to wait out the next month in peace and solitude.
At noon they offered a portion of their food and blessed the day they lived in. Nothing fancy. It was a mellow day, near perfect with white puffy clouds instead of the dreary gray ski he was used to. Not too cold.
His excursion took longer than thought, but he finally made it outside and over to the trio of tables with perfect view of Draco's corner. Settling down, he dug into the bags and began to open them eagerly.
“Potter really is the perfect little Gryffindor, brave and honorable. Perhaps it wouldn’t take much convincing for him to turn over the gold that rightfully belongs to us, Mother. If we, I mean you show him the ledgers and the invoice from the Goblins, he would do it.”
Hari ignored the question and asked instead. “Why does it look like you just stepped off the cover of a Vogue magazine?”

The third Queen came on set set wearing, an honest to God, kimono. Well one, you might find at a lingerie store. The garter belt and stockings a seductive black against beefy, thankfully hairless creamy thighs.
Kreacher disrespecting Sirius. Kreacher calling Sirius a blood traitor. Kreacher revealing confidential Order of the Phoenix secrets to Death Eaters. Kreacher maiming Buckbeak to get Sirius out of the room, while Harry firecalled hoping that his dreams were a lie, that Sirius was safe. Kreacher lying to Harry, saying Sirius was not at home. Harry rushing to the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry of Magic trying to rescue Sirius from Voldemort to discover it’s a trap. Sirius leaving the safety of Grimmauld Place to rescue Harry. The Battle at the Ministry of Magic. Bellatrix Lestrange dueling her own cousin, Sirius. Sirius being stunned and falling through the Veil. Sirius’s death without a body, but knowing he is dead. Witnessing the unbelievable moment of brief happiness of having a family, ripped from Harry’s grasp. Not having a funeral. The reading of Sirius’s will by Albus Dumbledore. Sirius being cleared of all charges by the Ministry, too little too late.
Draco wrinkled his nose in disgust as he smelled what he could ever describe as Muggle on Hari’s new clothes. Surely, disgusting Muggle hands had touched these clothes before Hari purchased them. Even, trying them on. They’d have to be washed. He thought to raise his wand to do the trick or even call Koaco to do so, but then another struck him.
His eyes tore away from Draco’s hypnotic swirling irises and threw his head back. Gripping Draco’s hair now with both hands, he let loose, thrusting into Draco’s mouth.
In the middle, Hari carefully folded the clothes that he thought he’d keep. These were the nicest he owned, but Hari highly doubted Draco would consider them 'date worthy' clothes. “
? Hari then swung one leg over as if he were riding a broom, and put a helmet on his head, snapping the buckle beneath his chin, and held up another for Draco. Then Draco had another scary thought,
Scratch that, Dumbledore was playing favoritism again, towards those Gryffindor's. One hundred and fifty points for each of the trio and then only ten points for poor Longbottom for standing up to your friends.
It was nearing dawn once more, but Hari couldn’t sleep. The restless magic in his blood hummed with energy. Narcissa ensured him that the high would wear off and he’d more than likely crash.
"I am not going to let you beat me, again. Or starve me, or lock me in that cupboard. Or anywhere else for that matter. In fact, I am out! Leaving, gone. You'll never have to see me again after today."
"If you want Narcissa and Draco Malfoy released from prison, you'll have to go through the proper channels. First you'll need..."
“Oh!” Hari said, coloring a bit. “Well, this is loads better than that. Are you planning to make a career out of it?
“I’ll make you a bigger one...um, for your birthday. Do you want oil, watercolor, or some other medium?” Draco asked, shyly.
Hari didn't need a mirror to see what scar he was tracing. That was the scar left by Salazar Slytherin's locket. Hari was trembling all over. He never let anyone get this close to him before. But he let, Draco traced the shape over his skin with ragged breath, quivering body, and clammy fists.
"As I said before the Malfoy's are a mute point. If they all go to Azkaban, you keep the remainder of the fortune in your vault. If they somehow are found not guilty, then they can fight for the gold that is rightfully theirs."
For the initial part of the ritual, Narcissa held Teddy, while Hari and Andromeda met on either side of the cauldrons, their arms reached over to clasp forearms. Draco stood as a silent spectator.
that met at his temple, and no matter which way he turned his head, it looked like the light cast shadows over his face artistically. He arched one brow. His lips were painted in a glistening
‘No! No! It couldn’t be, Potter can’t be here, seeing me like this. He will rub my nose in my weakness. He’ll tell the whole school I’ve been crying in the bathroom with Moaning Myrtle of all people-well ghosts. Surely he’s heard me.’ Draco’s blood chilled in his veins, ‘He’s heard me… and he’ll tell!’ Draco’s scrambling brain finally kicked in and he wheeled around drawing his wand throwing a wordless hex at Potter’s head. It missed his head by inches and shattered the lamp on the wall behind him.
Draco looked into his laughing green eyes, stunned, too shocked to be offended by Potter's words. He didn't know where to place his arms let alone his eyes as he kept glancing back and forth between his second cousin and Potter. He was so close, just inches away. His alpha was rolling around in giddy delight at hearing his name being spoken softy by Potter's soft lips. And Draco
Check out the companion story in Harry Potter and the Secrets Only Blood Can Tell. It's called Pulling Strings, Behind the Scenes.
"Sirius Black, my cousin, was your godfather." Andromeda asked as she gave a tiny flick of her wand and said, "Pack" the drawers and wardrobe opened to allow for the escape of dozens of clothes items to zoom around, fold and pack themselves in multiple compartment chests, and spare suitcases.
Hari took a quick assessment of the pub as he waited for his eyes to adjust to the dim light.  It was like déjà vu. Instead of the larger than life half-giant Rubeus Hagrid, Keeping of Keys at Hogwarts for him to hide behind, or his invisibility cloak to hide under, he was left exposed in the doorway. Just like before, the pub quieted, and the silence was almost as deafening as the sudden eruption of sound of voices and of chairs scraping on floors, as the patrons went mad clambering over each other and chairs and tables.
My godfather could be rather intimidating; even I try to avoid his wrath as much as possible. But I think he treats Potter rather unfairly. I mean, really? Why would a normal eleven year old wizard know, what adding powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood will do? I knew, but Severus was my private tutor and he had a fascination with lilies as long as I knew him. He was a bit unfair though, Potter was obviously taking notes, when Severus called him out for not paying attention.
Hari had a particularly sour look on his face. "Then you better hide what she is, then. Don't say anything about going to school in Scotland, less Aunt Petunia catches on or worse, Uncle Vernon."
'Yes, us plebeians own trinkets as high class as combs. If you like, I'll go find it and shove it up your arse. Though, I don't think it'll be pleasant, I carved it from rat bones."
The townhouse was heavily warded, to keep Muggles and unwanted Wizardkind out, hidden under a Fidelius charm. For some unspoken reason Harry Potter wanted them to come into the place through the Secret entrance. Narcissa had forgotten all about the secret entrance, it was rarely used. The Secret entrance was located in the back alley, along a brick wall that was taller than her son who stood a nearly a foot above herself. If you weren't paying attention, you'd miss the strange floral like border graffiti that outlined the entrance similar to Platform nine and three-quarters. Letting the house-elves walk in ahead of them, Narcissa took a quick hold of her too eager son, before he could do something rash.

Hari's hair was pleated in a double Dutch braid that framed his face like the hood of a cobra. On his brow sat a circuit of gold.
Narcissa grumbled something along the lines of, “stupid blood-traitors, not teaching their children the proper ways of magic.” Draco hushed his mother, listening more intently.
I do not have children, but I have my two wonderful niece (turns 3yo in May) and nephew (turns 1yo this month) who I love dearly, and take up much of my time playing and babysitting.
"Anyway..." Hari answers. "As for what I've been doing...yeah renovating the townhouse has pretty much taken up much of my time." Hari says.
Draco saw that with a little maneuvering and a bit of spell work, he and Hari could fit in there comfortably. Taking Teddy from Hari, he held one end of the hammock steady so Hari could settle in the swaying ropes. Then he handed over the content baby who stared up at the green leaves of the branches above.
Sheryl protected her community like the terrifying Mama Bear people call her. Which is why when the owner of the small Clothes and Accessories shop across the street gave her a call, she stood ready with fearsome scowl and cleaver gleaming. Hoodlums had been wondering into their community lately, stealing and vandalizing for the fun of it. There were a lot of nice cafés, shopping centers, and even a museum, if people bothered to look pass the night club and gay bar that is. But lately, business had been a bit slow, and now hoodlums dared to come into her part of town, fowling up the air with their derogatory language, crude and cruel taunts towards her and her people.
Draco left the black rubbish bag by itself, instead taking the book and hurling it into fire. He brushed his hands off and turned to Hari. He had a cheery smile on his lips. “Your turn, love.” He said almost sing-songy.
Draco in his dragon form, preened under the praise with his seven foot tail whipping around him, and fourteen foot wings keeping him airborne.
"Death Eater scum, you called me." Draco said pseudo calmly. "Do you have any idea what I could do to you now?"
"Urgently? What is this?" Minerva asked as she tracked his movements from potions stores to satchel, to hastily balled robes in a traveling trunk. "A future student has gone missing. Four to be precise, but one in particular...one has special qualities. Harry Potter."
If they do conceive another baby, I’d better work out restoring their memories before I have a sister named after myself. Wouldn’t that be confusing picnicking with the family?
Hari’s earlier apprehension from eavesdropping fled his mind. Narcissa actually approved of him after all and would support their relationship; even going so far as to break a betrothal with Astoria Greengrass. Wasn’t she years younger than he anyway?
He felt as if the Horcrux in Salazar Slytherin’s locket was still hanging around his neck, choking off his air like it choked off his happiness, until all he felt was the pain of living while his friends were dead.
“Yeah, I thought, you know…with the flirting making us both uncomfortable, it might be better to make it clear we were not interested. You…You don’t mind do you?” Hari stuttered, suddenly conscious of his choice of words.
"Muggles do not notice anything they don't want to see." Draco says, taking an experimental bite of a crisp from a blue bag. His eyebrow raised, "mmmhh" He said, noting the sour vinegar taste.
Harry dug in with gusto; the croissant was buttery, the cheese hot, and the sausage smokey. He finished his in three bites, and he reached for a second, but Nik only pulled it out of reach and towards himself, his own cup of tea still in hand.
The sobbing stopped long enough for her son the peer beneath her arms at the scrawny and quaking boy near the sparkling white lights of the Christmas tree with mischief. Unbeknownst to Petunia, Dudley smiled smugly at his slightly younger and much smaller cousin, before pointing to the scene of the crime.
only for his words to echo around the infinite room. He tried to look past Draco for the dragon, but the dragon was gone and here stood Draco without any clothes, and in the light available by starlight all around and hearthfire, his skinned glowed just like the dragon’s scales.
Hari slipped into his room, letting out a relieved breath when he heard the click of the door shutting. What to do? He couldn’t deny that he was flattered by Draco’s confession. He didn't feel disgusted, about a boy confessing to him or that it was Draco Malfoy who did the confessing.
It was the perfect plan, I gloat to my fellow Slytherin’s that I am purposefully going to stand Harry up and alert Filch of the rumor of the duel, (I didn’t) and then I sneak out to see him in private. That would have worked if I could have shaken my goons fast enough. By the time I made it to the clock tower it was already chiming the midnight hour. What’s more, Filch was there. Filch didn’t see me, but Peeves did. He was already hollering about students being out of bed. How did I miss Harry?
“How do you mean? Sirius told me about Angel Central. He gave me directions.” Hari asked a little confused. Yes, they could have taken the direct route, but then Draco would have missed the impression a sight like this made.
“The anssswer isss in Massstersss magic, can you find it?” Asclepius hissed quietly. “Can you feel the magic inssside? Clossse your eyesss and open your mind to the feeling. Feel how wild your magic isss, erratic and out of control. Grasssp the magic threadsss and braid and weave them into a coil. Reach and hold tight, and bring it to the sssurfassse. Wrap your magic around thisss Kreacher.”
He could tell that Sheryl really planned ahead in Hari's costume choice. Like Sheryl's gown, Hari's costume looked expensive. Hari was dressed as ancient Egyptian Pharaoh, that could put the last pharaoh of Egypt to shame. He wore an Egyptian style
Harry felt a tingling sensation in his hands, for a moment he got excited, thinking perhaps this was it. He opened his eyes to peer at the door.
Hari chuckled awkwardly, “Well I was going to ask you out on a date, but I…um have nothing to wear.” Hari said embarrassed.
When the Minister of Magic left 12 Grimmauld Place an hour later, Harry felt lighter than ever. For the first time since the war had ended he wasn't going to have to see another family torn apart. He was going to save their lives, for Teddy. Andromeda would have a chance to be with her sister, and Teddy would have a family again; in his grandmother, great aunt, and cousin. Things were looking up.
Andromeda chimed in. “Just a pinprick on your finger and in his palm will do. You will place your finger in his palm mixing your blood and his, this will ensure that the House of Black accepts him as your heir and blood. It is only required once, but to ensure the wards blood must be given of some capacity annually” Andromeda tilted her head in thought. “Not in this capacity. Too much fanfare if you ask me.”

Draco was speechless. He had no words. Hari, who Draco has always accused of favoritism, and special privileges, did just that to help Draco--again. His attention shy Gryffindor went out of his comfort zone to return his gold. Controlling, barely, the besotted look off his face, he did what came best to him, hackling Hari Potter.
"It was coriander, sweet-um. "A Cho reminded Dudley before turning to Hari. "I don't have the same predigest as others. My mother is Muggle. And besides. Dudley looked so shy offering me suggestions, shuffling his feet..." Cho laid big starry eyes on Dudley and thought, overgrown puppy.
“Yeah, Voldemort doesn’t give second chances, and Voldemort had been more than generous with his loyal followers. But he doesn’t see the Malfoy’s as loyal followers. You see, Lucius Malfoy first mistake was pleading not guilty after the first Wizarding world. He denied his loyalty to his master, saying he was under the Imperius Curse, and got away scot free.” Bill and Draco didn’t understand the exact muggle reference, but they caught the meaning.
Draco made a choking noise, “Mother, it wasn’t like that …” He paused when he saw his mother’s amused smirk. She was only teasing him. “Maybe it was like that, a little.” Draco admitted sheepishly.
But Mary glance confusedly over her daddy's shoulder. The alley had been a dead end, the motorbike couldn't have cut through unless it magically sported wings and flew or was
p.s. I vow to never get detention ever again. Especially, if Hogwarts makes kids go into the Forbidden Forest. It is forbidden for a reason.
Fingers teased and coxed their way past the tight ring of muscles that made up his anal opening and made their way into Hari’s tight passage. One, then two, then three.
The music stopped, the lights dimmed then flashed twice. The DJ got on the mic, "Welcome, welcome fellow Broncos, to Yas! Night!"
He was all alone with his thoughts. Maybe if Sirius was still alive, they could discuss his feelings. He heard a snore from the corner of the room.
Ever since he was attacked, trout kept a close eye out for him. He taught him how to look out for mad dogs like the man who attacked him with an alcohol bottle, and mostly he warned him against Tom's and Rat's.
Hari looked from Draco and back to Bill, before he continued. “Serve him loyally, or die. Does that sound like a Death Eater to you?” Hari said in challenge. “That sounded like a scared teenager to me, desperate to survive and trapped by his own upbringing. He was only sixteen, my age, your brother’s age. What would you have done? He made a choice, the only choice his upbringing provided him.” Hari paused taking a deep calming breath, his next part he was going to reveal hurt Hari, because it felt like betrayal. “Dumbledore knew and did nothing, because he needed a pawn in his war game to get his spy closer to Voldemort. He had Severus kill him instead, a mercy kill on Snape’s part, but a calculating, manipulative one on Dumbledore’s part. Draco needed help; he didn’t ask for help, it’s not in his nature to do so. But Dumbledore knew that Draco was in trouble, a student that he as Headmaster should have protected, he didn’t. How many students did he make suffer for the greater good, Bill?” Hari cut off, on a choking gasp, turning away to lean on the countertop. “I can’t get into this anymore, I am too exhausted. Bill, no one else would save him, so I did.” That was it. That was all he had in him. If Bill didn’t see reason, he would cut him and the Weasley’s loose if he had too. He wasn’t going to abandon Draco now.
study, for he could finally stop referring to everything as Sirius's, and look over the contents of the trunk. He pulled out a stuffed lion plush, and a soft baby blanket with gold snitches zooming around. Were these his when he was a baby? In any case he wanted to give them to Teddy.
Hari had specs of mud on his glasses, while Draco had several splotches in his usually perfectly groomed platinum blonde hair. They sat on the muddy grass Hari perched on Draco’s lap with a white knuckled grip. Hari didn’t know if he was breathless from the fall or from laughing so hard. He looked up at Draco and lost his breath for another reason entirely.
Well, he wasn’t getting back to sleep now. He needed to be up before dawn to help prep for the Litha celebration. It was something new and exciting, like learning more about his lost heritage.
The only two people that Draco considered close friends and confidants would be Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zambini. Blaise’s family is neutral, and while Pansy’s family was sympathetic to the cause, their self-preservation was high and would wait and see. They too, were attendees to Crabbe and Goyal’s funeral but they didn't even acknowledge Draco and his mother. They couldn't risk being associated with them at the moment, in fear of becoming social outcasts or worse death. With their friendship estranged as it is, would it even be possible to continue their friendship in secret?
“Upon this night and upon this hour, blessed be by the Zenith Moon, name thee Master Hari James Potter-Black of the two Most Ancient and Noble Houses.”
Draco sat elbows to knees and hands clasped together, with his head bowed as if in prayer. But Draco was not praying; he was seething. He glared over the top of his hands, before he glanced over at his mother. “There was an issue with the vaults. You see…father gave access to the Dark Lord and he was slowly siphoning funds into his own vaults. I went over the ledgers, it’s almost all gone. That leach was bleeding Father dry. I would say good riddance but that money was rightfully ours. There is barely anything left, how we live now the gold would run out before the year is up.”
Sirius just stared for a moment, before bursting out in wild gales of laughter and tears streaming down his face. He was holding his belly, "Good one Prongslet. You really had me there for a moment." He said wiping a stray tear from his eye.
Alice jumped up and waved the black box around. "OOOH! Lets order some!" She pressed a button and the box began vibrating. It had a white letter 3 scrawled across the top with the name of the bar and logo on it.
One of the elusive co-owner of the bar stopped by their booth to congratulate Hari on the win for the second round.
Draco longued between his splayed legs, and Hari felt rather than saw Draco swipe his tongue from the base of his penis to the tip, before swirling his tongue around its head, dipping just beneath  the foreskin to press against the gland there. Hari’s view was obscured; however, by the curtain of moonlit hair.
But, Sheryl found herself worrying for the young blonde. She always assumed Hari was asexual, if that was the case then Draco was setting himself up for heartbreak. She had to know his intentions.
"Right then, behind that curtain is a door to the storage room we all have been using as a dressing room for tonight. I will be here outside the curtain if you need help." He was given black sheer stockings, and lacy nickers.
He opened his mouth over the sweet tempo of Hari’s pulse point. Hot breath, moist lips, wet tongue. Hari shuddered and moaned as Draco licked and sucked a bruising hickey into Hari’s flesh. A visual mark, less permanent than the bite, but a clear declaration that Hari was his, nonetheless.
Narcissa was once so impressed with the Malfoy Manor, she was to call home. It was a handsome manor house, brick walled, grand peaks, and two gardens fenced in with yew hedges, and a fountain that sounded like bells in the distance. The entrance to the Manor grounds was guarded by a wrought-iron gate closed off against outsiders. Beyond the gates, the diamond pained windows of the Manor glittered in the distance in pre-dusk light. The gates did not open as they approached, but dissolved into smoke and solidified behind them. Nineteen years later those very gates would hold her and her only son prisoner within a gilded cage.
"Our Dragon, burned down the Manor during his manifestation." She explains. Hari looked to to Draco to see a definite blush on his high cheekbones.
A part of his dreamstate said, yes. The name, Draco literally meant dragon, and he was named after the constellation. Here they stood in a room full of stars. If he cared to look, he might discover that that particular constellation was absent from the night sky. The knowledge came and went passed through his thoughts like water and evaperated.
"He goes to our Senior High. He's also underage. You should check his I.D." Hari added, hoping he remembered correctly that Justin's birthday was on the 13th of August.

Harry smiled up at Narcissa Malfoy, and for the first time in over a week he was glad that he made that decision to invite her to Grimmauld Place. Harry's Smile brought Narcissa out of her giddy school girl like response and stood up, straightening the wrinkles in her robes and clearing her throat. "Thank you, Mister Potter for allowing us into your home. I assure you, my son and I will be on our best behavior."
"Uh, yeah. I guess you wouldn't have known. It was a big scandal when she went a married Arthur Weasley a beta. Every eligible bachelor was vying for her hand and her dowry., but what they really wanted from her was the offspring she could provide for them. But alas, she married Mr. Weasley. A shame really, at the time, so I've been told, she was the last known one in Britain of child bearing age."
Chest heaving and breath laboured, Draco leaned his head down to nuzzle his cheek and nose against Hari’s own--scenting. Draco was scarcely aware he was doing so.
Those words terrified him. Taking a breath, Harry took some of his Gryffindor courage that he hasn't felt in a very long time, and jumped right into why he was there.
"Perhaps I like strays?" Trout said tossing a hunk of something for Harry to catch unexpectedly. It was a mason jar with meat floating in liquid. "It's trout, or at least whatever catch of the day I scavenged last week. If I don't have a fire, I just pickle 'em. Doesn't take much."
I’ve already told Ron the wondrous news, I’ve located my parents in Australia. The memory and compulsion charm worked. Oh, how I wish I didn’t have to take pride in my skills. I never liked the idea of sending my parents away, for their own protection or not. It was too dangerous in Hampstead with families of Muggle-borns being hunted down, and I just couldn’t leave them vulnerable like that.
was all Draco could think with glee as he led Hari to his room.  His dragon would have preferred scenting Hari, personally, but this was the next best thing.
Third place. I lost to both Granger and Pansy. Unbelievable. Did she not need my help on the final exams after all? Was she wasting my time?
Harry's body chilled. He recognized that silhouette he's been dodging them for days now. A police man was at the door, asking to be let in without the open sign on. Why?
Harry furrowed his brow, and closed his eyes to concentrate. He decided that the first thing he needed was to concentrate on what he wanted.
The gesture was small, but made him happy. Slytherin's just do not go out like that. The house is all about loyalty. Sure, we stab each other in the back, figuratively for years, but even we would not have let that stand.
Hari gnawed at his bottom lip again, unsure now that Sirius was awake what his response had been. He had always been able to talk to him. but this...
As Harry took a step into the entrance hall and shut the door behind him the spectral dust-form of Albus Dumbledore materializes in a whirlwind of dirt and wind. The sound coming out of his mouth sounds eerie like the rasping sound of a Dementor, or the last dying breaths of a man.
“Oui, we are." Taking a sip of his coke which has been watered down by melted ice. He winced at the flat sweet taste.
"I thought today was going to be the absolute worse and had planned on it. Then I got your letter." Draco replied.
"When I was seven, I wanted a book from Flourish & Blotts. It was a very popular children's illustrated book that everyone I knew was talking about it. It was about the most famous wizarding child.
"I believe you Andromeda, Mrs. Malfoy saved my life. I believe people can change some, not completely, but some. It takes a lot to change a lifetime of prejustice." Harry confessed. "I want to save your sister and nephew, but what can I do?"
Hari took the offered hand and smiled genuinely. "If you ever need to catch a break from the yelling, you could tell them I'm gay. That would steer the conversation away from that landmine."
Draco did something he hadn’t done in years; lean into her for comfort. His dragon hummed trying to sooth his mother, as she once upon a time did for him. It was the only comfort he knew how to give and it came from instinct.
“Ollie, Mary!” Another voice yelled for them from his place in the queue. “Where are you?” The voice was now tinged in worry.
“It was my grand-tante, Dorea who invented Floo Candles.” Narcissa paused, “My great aunt.” She clarified for Hari. “We are actually related, you know.”
Hari had believed that Dudley wasn't the sharpest drill bit in his uncles tool chest, but he knew what "school" and "classmate" meant when it referred to Hari.
“Surely you’re having me on, Potter. Having a right laugh at me, are you? Answer me this, Potter.” Draco demanded. “The Death Stick, the Resurrection, and the Invisibility Cloak; exist?”
They are wonderful in that they don't really get my 'okay so it's an obsession' with Harry. They just said don't lose anymore house-points and then left me to my own devices.
Searing pain brought him to his knees. Normally his dragon scales were immune to his fire, but his scales were not impenetrable to his own talons, and his fire cauterizing the wound.
Draco was eating a summer salad with mint leaves, strawberries, and blueberries. Hari had moved onto dry toasted pumpkin and squash seeds. Both boys argued over the difference between fruits and vegetables and whether carrots or potatoes were even considered either.
"Awe then I guess you don't want to put up any of the Black portraits I took from the Manor and vaults, do you?" Draco asked, running his hand through his hair in an uncommon gesture of nerves.
Dudley shoulders dropped and he plopped his weight into the chair next to Hari. "What'll I do Harry. I want to introduce my girlfriend to them. I was already worried, because of well...her foreign blood and their reaction to that." Hari raised an eyebrow that Dudley even could acknowledge his parents short comings--in which they have many.
Draco wiggled one pale brow. Nodding Hari reached for the bag. Lassoing it around his head first, he tossed it into the fire, black bag crackling as it caught fire.
Wiping the wound with a no doubt unsanitary garment, he revealed the Dark Mark and a series of crisscrossing scars, some older than others. Most worrisome was the most recent and deepest cut located right next to the tendons of his wrist.
Petunia was shocked by her husbands words. "But...but Vernon, he must stay. My sister...the murderer is still out there...he's after Harry!"
him.  Sirius was his godfather; best friend of his father James, and didn’t even know him. But Harry was his best friend’s son, and Sirius would take him in because James father Fleamont Potter, took Sirius in when he ran away from Grimmauld Place at sixteen. He was willing to take Harry in, no question asks. But then Peter Pettigrew escaped justice again, and Sirius had to remain a fugitive, and Harry had to stay with his abusive aunt, uncle and cousin. Then at the end of Fifth year, Harry fell for Voldemort’s trap, and Harry got Sirius killed when he left the protection of Grimmauld Place to rescue him.
Draco consumed him, not with fire, but with desire. He felt his whole body set aflame with it. When Draco’s hot, moist breath fanned gently over the straining red head peeking through the foreskin of his cock--teasing; Hari’s head fell back on another breathless moan and his arms trembled trying to support his weight from the sensation.
Mary liked the later idea better. Her imagination went wild at the prospects of superheroes or secret agent spies for interpol.
He emerged from the cupboard to see a mountain of brightly wrapped birthday presents that nearly took up the entire table. Harry had no doubt that Dudley would have everything he asked for and then some. With an annoyed and only mildly jealous eye roll, Harry turned to the stove to finish preparing breakfast. He would have to prepare a full Irish, unless he wanted to be burned on the stove top again for not preparing enough food. Harry of course, would get none of it. It's a good thing he hid those stale crackers then.
He met Draco’s concerned expression, and reached up to pull his face down in a brief kiss. Before he could deepen the kiss. He heard a gruff clearing of the throat.
In the boy’s dormitory, they talked roguishly about sex, masterbation, and sex dreams often. He heard it from the upper years, both sexes in the quidditch locker room, and even his own year mates. Third and fourth year especially, Dean, Seamus, and Ron often tried to rope Hari into their discussion of their most elicit wank sessions or erotic fantasy. There always seemed to be something more pressing on Hari’s mind to worry about that school year than join a game of Shag-Marry-Kill, but mainly shag.
“Oh, I couldn’t sleep...dr-dreams.” Hari shrugged, accepting a cup of tea and sitting at the table. He didn’t hear the door behind him swing open and closed as Draco pranced into the kitchen, only to stop dead in his tracks at Hari’s words. A slow smile curled his lips, wickedly.
as he was a full consenting adult and Hari was a minor still, but a month away from his full inheritance, if he had one.
Sheryl, Alice, and C'iemone snuck up on him in the crowd. He was pushed and shoved closer to the stage.
“Litha is celebrated outside, once the first ceremony is held, it is an outdoor celebration with another ritual at solar noon, dusk, and then the final ritual at the zenith moon.” Andromeda explained.
It is fatal to those under 1 year of age, those with a previous health condition, those with weakened immune system from a recent illness, those over 65 years old.
Harry had to go up against Terence Higgs as Seeker. I didn't know much about him, but standing next to Harry he seemed huge. I didn't care about the game only I only wanted to watch Harry flying. He's a natural. I saw the moment he honed in on the snitch. The problem was so did Higgs. Then Marcus Flint interfered, and cost Slytherin's penalty points.
A look of confusion passed over Draco's face. He shook his head, then nodded and reached underneath his pillow next to him to pull out a leatherbound book. He offered the book towards Hari, before swiftly moving it over his head beyond Hari’s reach. He giggled.
Hari looked at Draco with wide eyes, before bursting into wild laughter. "I don't know. Let's find out. This ought to be fun, am I right?" Draco blinked wide-eyed, before flashing a side ways smirk of his own, nodding his agreement.
Changed the title of this chapter from Funerals and Old Flames to Dying Embers. It was dull and similar to an earlier chapter called Funerals and Trials.
Harry mustered all his courage and scrambled on the bar stool, his feet dangling, unable to reach the foot rest attached below the lip of the bar. He didn't let that deter him, he sat swinging his feet instead.
"But aunt Petunia! It wasn't me! I didn't do it." The tiny voice protested as she opened the door, shoved him inside.
Although Harry actually picked up a thing or two about playing the piano, he’s often pretend to be dreadful so that he would have the rare pleasures of just relaxing and listening to her play. The music would often lull him to sleep and he’d wake up with a mouthful of cat hair.
Moving about Diagon Alley unnoticed was proving to be impossible for Hari Potter, which is why he stayed away from the public eye after the funerals. He was angry that while attending many of his loved ones funerals, the press would follow him everywhere, focusing on him instead of the respect the fallen heroes deserved. Trying to quickly finish their shopping was impossible. Draco was nearly discovered several times, if it wasn’t for quick Quidditch maneuvering, Draco would have been discovered several times over. As is, he handily avoided being trampled over, knocked down, or elbowed in the face by an overly excited witch. Fed up with the crowed mooning over Hari, and frustrated that he was unable to make a claim over the popular boy savior over several matron witches and wizards bloody auctioning off their unwed, and some wed, daughters. Many of them were asking for confirmation that his birthday was indeed the end of July. No doubt, angling for when/if he comes into a creature inheritance. One woman even offered to be in a polygamous relationship,
"Open your eyes Draco. Look at your transformation. Dangerously gorgeous, Draco my darling. Don't you agree?" "Sheryl gushed.
Suddenly winded as if he were walking for ages, he paused to catch his breath. Kneeling down to rest hands on knees he peered behind him and he realized that he had just left his own room. Deductive reasoning told him the room ahead was Draco’s.
His gorgeous blonde was nowhere to be seen. Instead, lounged against a swan chaise, a magnificent silver dragon glinted in the moonlight. The silver dragon raised it’s head to look at Hari with swirling eyes of opalescent colours.
Draco sighed, “That is what Pansy and Blaise said to me….multiple times.” He said grudgingly. “I tried to make every excuse that I hated him to my friends, but soon I stopped believing those lies. I find him ridiculously attractive in this sort of nonchalant, scruffy way. His hair has this quality about it, either like he’s just rolled out of bed, or just shagged look.” Narcissa raised her eyebrow.
Draco had to admit even to his awesome self, that he probably could not. The person now roleplaying on stage, could pass as a woman, the larger hands and slight bob of the Adams apple the only indication of the person's actual sex.
And the snake was massive, it easily overtook Harry's miniature stacher in seconds when it raised its head.
Harry was listening for out of tune keys by ear; so that he could tune the piano. He supposed the Magical society knew how to tune a piano with magic, but Harry only knew the Muggle way. Harry was in luck, looking inside the duet bench Harry found some old moth eaten sheet music, a tuning hammer, and two damper sticks. He wouldn’t need the damper stick in the lower notes, seeing as the lower notes had only one short thick string. But as he goes up in octaves, the higher notes have between two to three unison strings working together to create one coherent and clear as bell sounding tone. The damper stick or muter, will help damper the vibration of the other strings connected to each key, while isolating each sting to tune individually with the tuning hammer, then come together and tune as a whole. The tuning hammer is used to tighten or loosen the strings to get them back in tune, individually and then up to three unison strings together per key. Harry started at the lowest notes A, A sharp, B, B Sharp et cetera, ending at the eighth C note.
As for Hari, Draco knew that Hari came here to get away from everyone. To escape all that attention. He wanted a sanctuary, just like mother and he did.  Draco believed fiercely that Hari wasn’t ready for any of it, not even his friends.
“Counterfeit or likely stolen, your Gringotts vaults were audited and the Ministry took ahold of your gold, didn’t they?” Yellow hair chimed in speculative. She was close to the truth, the Ministry still has the Malfoy’s vaults on lock down, but Hari has the vast majority of his gold in his own vaults.
As he turned from the two graves he caught out of his peripheral vision, Blaise clutch Pansy around the shoulders in a hug, tears glistened in Pansy brown eyes as she clenched one fist to her heart, before smoothing her fingers and patting her chest twice, Blaise mirroring the move. And with that single gesture, unobserved by the rest, Draco knew that his friendship was intact. Narcissa didn’t say a single word as she walked with grace up the pebbled pathway to the waiting Aurors, even as Mrs. Crabbe short and stocky like her dead son spat on the hem of her long fortuny black skirt as she passed. The only incitation that she was aware of the insult was a tightening of her hand upon Draco’s shoulder in a silent command, ‘don’t engage.’
"Draco is just going through a hard time. He has a lot to adjust to. He'll be fine in another day or two, just be patient, Hari, love." Looking down shyly blushing faintly at the endearment. It made him feel warm and bubbly. Hari nodded his head once. It was a lot to handle, he imagined. Packing up everything he owned, and leaving everything he knew behind to come and live with your school rival was not an easy feat.
Now that he had the journal, did it really prove anything. Hari knew from experience that just because it was written down didn't mean that it was true. He had the wool pulled over his eyes on too many occasions. There was that first time, with Tom Riddle's diary back in second year. Then during sixth year with the Half-Blood Prince's potion book. And how many times had that horrid witch Rita Skeeter, wrote falsified newspaper articles about him?
Sighing heavily he squinted at the tiny blurred numbers on his wrist watch given to him on his seventeenth birthday. Eyesight, horrible as ever was no help. So he threw out his arm hazardously at the nightstand by his bed to scramble for his glasses and his willow wand.
Deciding they had enough excitement for one night, Draco and Hari use the loos and decide to head up to their booth and call it an evening.
"So, what?" Draco decided to go on the offensive. "So I said I love you, it's not like I expect anything to come of it.”
"NEVER, INSULT. ALBUS. DUMBLEDORE. IN. FRONT. OF ME." Hagrid bellowed. Then he turned the umbrella on the large boy and a flash of light had the little boy squealing, clutching his arse cheeks together.
Hari’s adam apple bobbed as he spoke, “She was killed, last year. Just leave it, please.” Hari begged.
If the Eighth Years are allowed to return, certain accommodations will have to be met for those with manifest creatures’ blood and navigating with the alpha-omega dynamics. Mandatory ABO Sex education classes for the Eight Years would have to happen the first week of school, a task usually set aside for the parents and guardians. Now Hogwarts would have to include unisex dormitories, individual rooms for mated pairs, and heat and rut rooms for the Eight Years. Not to mention alphas and omegas would have to be excused from classes and homework for the three to seven day heat and rut cycles. And some other school rules would have to be relaxed; like curfew, and allowing students off school grounds outside Hogsmeade Village weekends to visit Heathouses.
Alice was waiting for them outside the booth. She was tapping her toe impatiently, the fuzz ball bee on her shoes bouncing erratically. Beside her was a tall circular table with a large server tray of drinks on top, including a large pitcher of sudsy beer with mugs and about  a dozen shot glasses.
Hari went to slide his new wand into his back pocket, when Ollivander cleared his throat. "Perhaps I can suggest an arm or thigh sheath for your wand?"
All that aside, he didn't really know how to break the news to his friends that he was considering dating a bloke and needed fashion advice—let alone that that bloke was Draco-fucking-Malfoy.
They continued their exploration of blue jeans, Khakis, combat trousers-just no-and other arrays of slacks and trousers.
Hari paused for a long second; not wanting to give away his name, as if saying his name would bring misfortune. Shaking his head at his paranoia, he wiped his face from barbecue sauce and meat juices, before he responded. “Harry” He responded before he put his black mop of a head down to continue eating. It wasn’t a timed meal and as long as he didn’t leave the table unnecessarily, he could take his time.
"Look kid, Harry." Nik says as he points his own mug of tea at Harry. "There are a lot of sketchy people living on the streets; drugs alcoholism, those willing to do and sell anything to get a quick score for their own gain, or pleasure." Nik didn't want to think of the perverts in and off the streets offering to 'save' the homeless boy. So many girls and boys go missing, sold into sex trafficking never to be seen again.
In the kitchen located in the basement of Grimmauld Place, Harry stood in front of the fireplace connected to the Floo network. The fire was blazing an angry green, and bars of green fire barred the entrance from letting Kingsley into the townhouse.
"Runaway. Ten years old. parents dead, abusive home. I was trying to get him safely to a shelter without the Child Services investigating too deeply to take him back to that place, wherever it was. But you spooked the kid, and he ran. Thinks I called the police on him or something. He probably won't be back."
Checking to make sure there weren't any look - a - loo outside, he cautiously began undressing before the floor mirror. Whipping his white, blonde hair out of his face in annoyance, he wrestled with the jumper as best he could without stretching the thin, soft material. His first attempt had his head going through the chest hole.
Sheryl saw Wanda, the woman who called him to scare away the poor boy in the first place, snooping from her hiding place and subtly shook her head in warning. Wanda was kind if a bit misguided in many of her ways. She’s open her mouth to spread gossip in a minute, not understanding when a line had been crossed, then act confused and hurt when confronted for it. Wanda certainly would have opened her big trap and blurted out, that indeed Sheryl’s Place hadn’t any eaters challenge, and that Sheryl just couldn’t turn a poor starved and beaten boy away from her doorstep hungry. Sheryl was sympathetic to the boy’s plight, being far more insightful than she ought to be, as she was that boy at one point in her life, when she first moved to London and struggled to make by.
Seriously depressed. Harry gets drunk one night and is then reminded that he does have a family; his godson, Teddy. What else can Harry do but try reach out to his only remaining family.
Hari fingered the too long sleeves. The material wasn’t as heavy as he first thought, but light and airy. He felt a tingling sensation over his body, and the material shrank to fit his body. He looked up to see Draco with his wand in hand. He looked at Hari through heavy lids as he took in a deep breath. A slow smile spread across his face. He nodded in approval.
"Looks like it." Emmet says standing off to the side looking at the stage with serving tray tucked under his arm. But Draco noted he had a secretive smile on his lips. The DJ announced the song as Survivor, "
Hari’s reaction was not what he expected. Hari actually laughed, so long and hard, that he nearly fell off the broomstick. It was only Draco’s secure grip around him that he didn’t fall as he tried and failed to get his gasps and peels of laughter under control.
“No problem.” She giggled. “I’ll be around to assist you when you need. Be sure to tell the sales associate at the front; that Candice assisted you and I’ll check you out.” She winked suggestively at Hari, and Draco fought to suppress the immediate wave of revulsion—carefully schooling his features blank.
Draco unclasped his hands and let them hang loosely between his knees and looked up at his mother lost; speaking as if from a daze, “After we questioned it, the Goblins discovered the loophole in the contract, they didn’t question combining the vaults then, because Father presented forged documents with a sample of your magic. It was too easy. And then the Dark Lord turned around and stole the Malfoy’s wealth.”
The tabloids make up lies about my life all the time. I've been written about in history books and children's stories, making my real life tragedy into something more than it ever was. The truth behind the legend, the hero, the "Savior"- I am just a seventeen year old boy, whose parents were murdered, and the murderer and his followers hunted me and everyone I cared about down, until I decided to hunt them down instead. The truth is, I was scared all the time, for my life and the lives of all those I cared about. I've never wanted to be the hero or famous, but that is what you chose to make me. What good is my fame and influence if it can't be used to save two lives that deserve a second chance at freedom?
When he came to, Harry was in the back of his uncle's car. It was just he and his aunt and cousin. Uncle Vernon was not in the moving vehicle, nor was Piers. Dudley sat in the shotgun seat next to his mother, who was driving. Harry was laying across the back seat, bleeding on his uncles patent leather seats. Despite trying to remain quiet when he woke, he groaned involuntarily. His cousin in the front seat turned around at the sound, frightened.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy,” the Prosecutor began, “You are charged with being a Death Eater, letting Death Eaters into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, aiding and abetting He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, attending Death Eater meetings, attempted murder, Imperiusing a student, poisoning a student, purchasing a dark artifact and using a Cursed Necklace on a fellow student.” Draco wanted to slump in his chair, he didn’t mean to curse Katie Bell or Poison the Weasel. He was trying to finish the task for the Dark Lord by killing Dumbledore, before the Dark Lord killed him and his mother. Fixing the Vanishing Cabinet and letting Death Eaters into the Castle was a crucial part of completing the task, but as time went by he got more desperate and reckless. Many innocent people were harmed that night. He deeply regretted his involvement in the war.
She glanced between the two teens before her, one gold tipped finger over her lip, the other hand tapping nails against her outer thigh in thought. A sly grin grew across her lips. Batting her gold flacked eyelashes, she teased. "Ah, my sweet Marry-Alice. You brought two new queenlings to moonlight with us."
“Ah, well. Don’t ye worry lads! We got all ya could need, shall need, from activity toys to zip-ups!” Draco looked at Hari. He had no idea what a zip-up was, and from the look of it, neither did Hari.
He couldn't very well owl his friends. Ron was still grieving over the death of his brother, and Hermione was trying to find her parents to restore their memories.
Cho looked absolutely a fright when she realized what Hari had said and it dawned on her that if Dudley was Hari's Muggle cousin, then Hari had just outed her as a witch.
"Kreacher, we will be delayed coming home, have dinner ready for us, say...six o'clock? We need to go to Gringotts first." Kreacher nodded his head eagerly as he too disappeared from the room.
Narcissa was both proud and scared for her Petit Dragon. Alphas have a lot of stigmas placed on them as they are stronger than the other secondary genders and they can become temperamental at a drop of a quill feather. This is a problem for newly presented adolescence alphas, as they do not have the control needed to interact with others rationally. They will be aggressive in their dominance of others. Her son did not need this extra pressure on his shoulders, what her son needed was to keep his head down and stay out of the public eye and gain the grace of his peers.
Harry looked up at her with a tight smile, and a humorless laugh. "Well, I never saw my birth certificate before, and in the muggle world you cant even go to primary school without having one. My aunt and uncle lied to me about my parents, how they died...it really shouldn't surprise me about them not telling me who I am. For seventeen years, I've known myself to be Harry James Potter, but I know that to be a lie, I'm trying to find out what my parents expected of me. I found my mums journal, her baby name research. she took so much care in choosing my name." Harry took another sip of Bourbon that Kreacher provided. Andromeda stood there. She didn't know what to do to cheer up the depressed boy in front of her. Maybe if she could get him to talk to her instead of wallowing in self pity.
“I don’t see…” And Harry trailed off, because he did see. At eye level, the banister carved into an intricate serpent. Its body had moved, until its head was extended horizontally towards Harry, its tongue flicked in and out questioningly. Harry’s eyes widened and his voice croaked a little as he liked his lips and spoke, “What’s your name?”
Chapter 15 will bring back the glorious Sheryl. Thank you all for being supportive. I am so sorry I am not reliable with updates.
"I am sorry, your mother had to go through with all that." Hari squeezed his hand in sympathy. Draco retaliated by snuggling into Hari's side, wrapping arms, legs, and tail around Hari.
Andromeda laughed long and hard. “She helped. Baking comes easy to me. We…” She emphasized the pronoun by pointing back and forth between her and her sister. “Followed a recipe book.”
When first perusing the list of magical children born in Great Britain between August 1st 1979 and July 31st 1980, there were 43 magical born children-- only 39 students have responded to their letters. One name in particular had not responded.
Rushing to the bathroom, Hari opened the door to see Draco whirl around from the mirror. Droplets of blood were spattered against white porcelain and smeared over the blade of a small silver knife—he recognized it as an athame used for Potions.
“We can’t ever hope to be what the world expects for us. It only leads to disappointment and heartbreak. So yeah, I guess…well I…” Hari rubbed the back of his head enduringly. “When I offered you my hand, I was offering you a truce. I was willing to forgive you, to make amends, and start anew. From here on out, it is our choices that determine what we are to each other.”
“Joining the Death Eaters was the single worst mistake of my life, and I chose it. I chose it! This cursed mark…” Draco gritted his teeth, “is a constant reminder that I am not good enough for you. You’re good and light and wonderful. If you died the world would mourn. If I died the world would celebrate the death of another monster. I should be dead or in Azkaban with all the others. “
“That bastard! Those were mine, to be untouched. That goes against the prenuptial contract. The Goblins couldn’t have done that without written permission and my magical signiture.”
Hari plastered his body to Draco's side and looked up with charcoal rimmed green eyes. "Can we go down there, Please?" Hari begged.
Petunia Dursley couldn't have known what fate lay in wait for her younger sister that night. Afterall, the last time they saw each other was at Petunia's and Vernon's wedding. When Lily and James' announced their own enempials, Petunia and Vernon did not attend in return. In fact, the last letter Petunia received from her sister was the announcement of her nephews birth.
"Up! Get Up! Now!" BANG. BANG. BANG. Harry was startled awake by his aunt Petunia's shrill voice. He stared groggily up at the underside of the stairs from the tiny cott in the tiny broom cupboard. As far as he knew he lived under these stairs for nearly ten years, ever since the death of his parents in a fatal car crash.
Hari couldn't keep the teasing lilt to his voice. "And how would you know the difference between fresh parsley and coriander, Dudders?"
Satisfied at hearing one piece of information about Hari from the source. Looking around frantically, and nearly dancing in place Draco shouted, "Dot!" and a tiny house-elf appeared in the entrance hall of the ground floor. "Bring me Sirius Black's portrait, the third and hurry it up." Draco said quickly and a bit harshly.
"Did I ask for any money, kid? No, then shut up." The man turned around. He held a cup of hot something in his hand and placed it with a careful click on the bar top. The slight smell of tea had Harry taking up the cup and nearly draining the thing, only wincing slightly at the hot and bitter taste on his tongue.
I say inconspicuously, because you won't be finding the address of 12 Grimmauld Place on any map, Muggle or Magical. You see, Sirius Black's father, Orion Black, made the five story London townhouse unplottable and placed Muggle Repellent Wards to keep those pesky Muggles away. The local Muggles have long since accepted the mistake in numbering which landed number 13 next to number 11.
Draco’s face went carefully blank. He quickly took his hand away. His brain had taken a direct dive into the gutter. His dragon was salivating in his head and biting at the bit. He shuddered.
"I'll keep an eye out for the lad." The officer replied. "Try to get him help, before the true horrors of this world get to him. But I have a feeling he's already seen monsters made out of people."
Hari's lips were moist, pink, and glistening against the green shell of the salted edamame as he used his lips to gently pop the immature soybeans into his mouth. He was chewing absently, lost in thought, looking out into the garden. Draco watched hypnotized as yet another pod made its way between his lips and gently pulled back out. He was scarcely breathing let alone concentrating on anything else, anyone else, as Hari quickly cleaned the salt from his index finger, then thumb, glancing up through thick lashes towards Draco.
Draco licked down the column of Potter’s throat and leaving nibbling kisses at his clavicle. Potter’s nipples stiffened and goose-pimples pebbled on glistening wet skin in the drafty castle bathroom. Draco arched his back some, bent his head and licked at Potter’s too tempting nipples, before giving a stinging bite, a soothing swirl of his tongue, and moved on to give open mouthed kisses down his abdomen. His tongue dipped and swirled in Potter’s navel, before following his happy trail down further. Draco looked up trough hooded eyes, and impossibly thick eyelashes, to peer at Potter with
And he did, until the summer before Sixth Year. Needing a place to hide while fleeing from his cousin and his gang of friends that liked to beat on their favorite punching bag, Hari went to the one area where he knew Dudley would be caught dead seen near, or else faces his father’s wrath. Hari was, of course, forbidden to go to this particular area as well. Naturally, this meant it was the perfect place to escape the Dursley’s and the war. The weeks before Dumbledore collected him from the Dursley’s he found solace roaming these streets.
With blood rushing in his ears, and quiet sobs racking his shoulders, Harry did not hear the soft tinkle of glass flowing into each other from the floor and then a vase, whole once more, smoothly soaring to its pedestal.
The small man with giant mustache and even larger orange hat, bounced on his feet, pumping Hari’s hand up and down excitedly. Hari wasn’t listening; he stood like a deer in the headlights fighting his inner demons. He felt trapped, surrounded, with no way out. Hari did not like crowds. Forget the door behind him. He felt the walls and people close in on him, as he fought his breath, his vision was going black around the edges. And then he felt a warm hand at the base of his spine,
“And I won’t be if you keep insulting me or my friends, either.” Hari said in all seriousness. Draco’s confidence waned a bit.
Gryffindor, fucking took the House cup right from beneath our noses. Stupid Headmaster! Always wanting to manipulate the whole system.
Harry had waited in the back for the Dursleys to move along so that he could have a chance to peer in at the sleeping coiled reptilian giant. He looked quite sympathetically towards the caged creature. Waiting the standard ten seconds, Harry then began to talk to the creature. Comforted in the fact that this creature would not judge or ridicule him, he began to speak with the poor beast. Not realizing he was speaking another language other than English.
“Good. I have to prepare breakfast for Narcissa and Andromeda. I’ll have the house-elves put a Stasis charm on them, and then serve them once they are ready to eat. Draco, I told your mother about going into Diagon Alley, Narcissa declined the trip, so it’s just the two of us. Will you be able to pick up a wand for her based off of her magical signature?” Draco swallowed. The mob last time terrorized his mother, she couldn’t hide behind her pure-blood pride anymore, and she had no wand to protect herself, so she didn’t want to go out in public yet. Draco knew that Narcissa would prefer to choose her own wand, but Draco could purchase her wand for her. He nodded his head in acknowledgement.
Harry, Granger, and Longbottom were caught out of bed last night and also had to serve detention with me.    Of all the people to be stuck with, why was Longbottom even serving detention with us. He wasn't even in on the whole baby dragon business. What was he doing out of bed?
Hari rested his burning face in his hands. "Dray-co!" He whined out. "Did you have to tell my cousin I use to date his current girlfriend?"
That morning he pretended to have a stomach ache on the pretense he ate too many sweets and pastries during breakfast and couldn’t apparate into Diagon Alley or take the Floo Network in fear he would hurl. Pretend, remember. That way, they’d have no choice than to take the Alley entrance behind the Leaky.
Hari looked at Draco seriously. "Those are the first scars that I inflicted on anyone. Draco, I almost killed you."
Draco’s scent glands at his throat were swollen and over sensitive after his first rut. In lieu of a couple
Petunia was left white faced in the harsh lights of the kitchen. With trembling hands, and shaky breath, she took the vase and moved it to the attic. That's not what her husband meant, but she couldn't bare to get rid of that vase. She didn't even know where the twin vase was. It was probably shattered long ago. She locked it in a chest, along with some old photographs of when they were children, and other reminders of her deceased sister.
Hari appeared to struggle with something. “I want more out of life, than to struggle to survive. Maybe I gave up once, or maybe I just thought that was what I wanted, because someone said it was for the greater good.” Turning away from Draco, Hari kicked the kickstand up and rolled the bike into the shed. Saying all the while, “But you know something, Draco Malfoy? The world doesn’t end when we do. The same life problems still exist. We just wouldn’t be a part of the solution. I am no longer going to sacrifice my happiness for others. I am going to find it; my happiness, my light, my warmth, and I will hold onto it, by God or whatever deity you choose to pray to. And that sounds a bit selfish, yeah? But I gave, and they took, and they want more. Well fuck them.”
"Pup, what are you saying? You don’t have to do anything. It’s not like he expected a reply, I mean you were with Cho and then Ginny. He knows this. He is probably just messing with you." Sirius said imploringly.
“And you’d think that I’d find his mannerism offensive. He’s loud, stubborn, foul mouthed, and sarcastic in this sort of sassy way. Don’t forget he dresses absolutely horribly.”
During these grievous times, we offer the highest respect and dignity to the dead and surviving family.
Nott, that sneaky conniving bastard, has already tried to insert his dominance over me. I am a Malfoy! I showed him. I hexed him with the best Pimple jinx
Tapping his nose, as if he knew some great secret, Draco revealed his cards. “And how do you think your godson would react to those curious little…” He sucked air between his teeth, “sticky magazines I found throughout the parlour? Got a little lonely chasing your own tail, Padfoot?” Revealing he knew Sirius’s nickname. “Birds aren’t enough for you and you’ve got a bit of a thing for Poodles, do yah?” Draco mocked.
It was only the first day of living with Hari Potter. What would the future bring for them? Draco thought as the heat built in intensity in his abdomen, in his throat, in his heart. He was losing a battle of wills between his alpha and its rut, and his consciousness.
Kaa slithered over the now windowless enclosure, dragging his huge weight across Dudley's prone form. Aunt Petunia screamed. The sound drew the rest of the occupants to be aware of the released boa constrictor.
To Draco’s irritation Hari didn’t try to discourage her advances. “Um thanks….er….Candice. I’ll be sure to call on you if we need anything.” Hari said biting his lip, flushing, and blinking large green eyes behind black wire rimmed spectacles at the Muggle. She didn’t seem deterred at all, and Draco gritted his teeth, sealing a growl.
jinx, so you can't even talk about the name, least of all the address. It's also anti-muggle, and unplottable." Harry continued stepping back into the study.
The sport is played on flying brooms in the Quidditch Pitch, high in the air. There are three giant golden hoops on either side of the pitch. There are three types of balls; two Bludgers, one Quaffle, and one Golden Snitch. If the Quaffle is thrown through one of the hoops on the opponent's side, they gain ten points. The two Bludgers are enchanted to knock players off their brooms. The Golden Snitch is a tiny golden ball with wings that is very difficult to see. If the Snitch is caught the game is over, and they gain one hundred and fifty points. However, it is entirely possible to win the game without being the team to catch the Snitch. It is a matter of having more points, the Snitch being caught just ends the game and usually gives that team the advantage.
Despite the chill of the morning, and the grumbling of his stomach, Harry hesitated about following the man.
Hari's brow furrowed in confusion. He’d mastered this spell in fourth year. He wasn't so distraught that his wand wouldn't work. He was just about to try again, when he heard a muffled voice, words indecipherable. “What?” he said, turning abruptly.
A near inaudible sob racked his shoulders and Harry had to cover his mouth quickly to stifle the sound. He was finally able to escape his cupboard and he didn't want to ruin it and get caught by any of his family. Wiping his wet cheeks he squared his thin shoulders, and stiffened his lip. He had to be smart. If he was caught out of his cupboard, he was dead.
The only times Hari could remember being confessed to was on Valentines Day. Those had been awkward enough. There was that one time during second year, Ginny had sent him a Cupid Gram, with a man in a diaper chasing him down the corridor, singing and sprouting poems that professed her ever dying love for him. And...Hari hung his head, embarrassed. He ended up dating her four years later. Hari didn't even ask her out, or confess his feelings, he just kissed her after Gryffindor won the House Cup and that was it.
"It is you. I thought I recognized your voice. How dare you enter my club after eleven years and think you could intimidate me. You can't have her back. She's ours now. We signed the adoption papers and filed them with the government."
Hari and Draco are trapped inside the Leaky Cauldron by a mob of Hari's admirers. Draco’s alpha instincts are at war within his conscious. How will Draco react to the crowds in Diagon Alley, and later as Hari takes him out to lunch at Sheryl's Place.
"I'M CALLING THE POLICE. YOU ARE BREAKING AND ENTERING. AND--AND JUST ASSUALTED MY SON!" Vernon bellowed, his face turning the color of a plum.
“I so swear.” Hari said again gritting through the tightening and loosening of the magical bindings.
Hari’s words did nothing to ease Draco’s mind. His eyes opened wide. Draco wheezed out in panic,  “Oh, Circe! The media storm…they’re going to hate me even more…”
Narcissa Malfoy née Black grew up in a household of wizardkind who believed in magic over muggle; a pure-blood belief that was harshly enforced. The Black's believed that muggle-born wizardkind were inferior to pure-bloods and thus not allowed to fachinize with them at all.  In the family of the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black, if you didn't believe the same prejudice, then you were disinherited and had your existence blasted from the family tree.
Hari is beginning to regret inviting Draco to go shopping as their first date. Draco is having a great time. To perk up Hari, Draco suggests they enjoy a scoop of gelato.
“Welcome to Hennes & Mauritz!  My name is Candice, how can I be of some assistance?” She said with a simper and a giggle for the dark haired cutie.  She pushed out her chest in a tight, revealing blouse trying to draw his attention. She fluttered her eyes for good measure.
Hari’s face was a tomato red. He had nearly forgotten how outspoken Sheryl could be. Being a prominent member of the resident gay neighborhood, she would often tease Hari about his sexual preferences and experiences. Hari never spoke of is one failed relationship with Cho Chang and didn’t intend to talk about his uncertain future relationship with Ginny Weasley. The truth of the matter was, Hari hadn’t given Ginny a second thought since returning home from the war. Dating was the last thing on his mind with the funerals, the trials, settling everyone into Grimmauld Place with him.  Now he wasn’t even sure if he was even ready to get back together with her.
“This room is mostly used for guests who do not have access to the Black’s personal library upstairs; it's secluded enough that private floo calls could be taken here. Dot, can you hear me?” Narcissa called a little louder leaning closer to the tiny flame.
"Hey, now. Is that any way to behave towards the person who is treating you to breakfast. Weren't you ever told to respect your elders?" Nik scolded.
Hari looked over at Draco, “This was your father’s fourth and most consequential mistake. Voldemort didn’t want the public knowing that he has returned. He was using spies and subterfuge in the Ministry to slowly take over. But when your father failed once more, the prophecy being destroyed and I escaped capture, Voldemort was forced to make an appearance, and it was made public. Your father ruined Voldemort’s important war strategies, and you and your mother were made to suffer for it, as your father was currently out of his reach.” Hari had stepped closer to Draco, momentarily forgetting Bill was carefully analyzing the situation, as Hari stopped in front of Draco he raised his hand to cup Draco’s cheek. Bill’s eyes narrowed flashing golden yellow as he scented the air. “Voldemort took your freedom, your fortune, your home, your dignity, and was going to take your life. When you survived the war and the Wizengamot was surely going to send you to Azkaban, I had to do it; I had to save your life.” Hari’s eyes were impossibly big and sparking behind his black round rimmed glasses. Draco shuddered and flinched away from the icy burn on his cheek, his dragon roaring in protest at losing Hari’s touch. Bill noticed the movement and knew what it meant.
"Dittany I suspect. Rare, expensive. We might have some. Star Grass is easier to come by and numbs the pain, works against infection, better on burns, but takes days of soaking and bandaging to heal. If we had dittany the wound will heal faster, but it still won't erase the scar right away.  What you need is rest." Mother scolded son. "You've been running around London just a day after your rut ended, give your hormones time to settle."
Hari looked briefly around himself, remembering the parlour as Hermione had last seen it with the three of them sleeping on the couches and cushions in this very room only months ago. Hari really couldn’t blame her for not trusting his cleaning skills, having never shown her his skills acquired living at the Dursleys. He’d never liked being forced to do things he didn’t like and so one of his small rebellions had been a messy room. And of course, Hari hadn't had the chance to tell his friends how to properly spell his name. Ruefully he looked back down at the letter dated two weeks ago and read on.
Narcissa was well aware of her son’s infatuation with Potter. She maybe even encouraged it at times in Draco’s pre-Hogwarts days, purchasing him books about the mysterious savior who survived the Killing Curse, vanquished the Dark Lord, then mysteriously disappeared from Wizarding society. She would often walk by her son’s rooms and hear him talking passionately to his house-elf Dobby, who was assigned to take care of him, when he wasn’t with his tutors, learning French and Latin, accounting and business, mathematics, dark magic and potions, and Quidditch. Narcissa suspects it was Draco who had Dobby trying to protect Harry Potter during his second year. It was also Draco who instructed Dobby to rescue the prisoners in the makeshift cells in the cellar.
“San Francisco?” Dudley asked, referring to yet another city in America with a high LGBTQ community. Instead of a cuff to the back of the head that earned him a ruffling of the blond hair on Dudley’s head.
Just then a tiny house-elf skipped in and spoke up without even bowing. “Young Master Lupin-Black is being up, fed, burped and changed. Master Hari sirs, informed me of wanting to “say good-morning and cuddle Teddy Bear,” before he departs. Dot has informed the Master, may Dot goes washing sheets now?” Hari blushed at the young house-elf, who quoted him near verbatim. The other two frowned at her in disapproval over how the younger house-elf behaved. A proper house-elf never asked things of their master. Hari would admit that it was quite refreshing, and knew she only wanted to do the wash, because she could choose, from an array of pillowcases, sheets, doylies, and other non-clothe item linen to use as clothes. She was quite the fashionista.
Just a week prior Draco and Narcissa left the Manor to take a jaunt into town for the first time since the trial, only to be nearly mobbed in the street. They needed to go to Gringotts and settle their financials, withdraw gold, and sort items needed to be moved, sold, or destroyed. The two Auror details assigned to them were negligent in their duties and stood aside and watched as the crowd of vicious accusations grew along with the mob. When Draco shouted at the nearest scarlet clad Auror, “Why aren’t you doing anything? HELP US!” The Auror said impassive, “No one has drawn their wands and until then we are not obligated to step in.” That excursion was unsuccessful and the Malfoy’s were forced to return home without completing the tasks they set out to do. Narcissa never left the Manor again since that incident.
When Draco reached the double oak doors and stained glass diamond paned windows of the entrance, he swept his hand out in a down to up shooing motion and opened the doors magically to reveal the foyer. The foyer was large and luxuriously decorated, exotic carpets covered stone floor, and portraits of the Malfoy ancestors lined the walls. It was only the Malfoy’s by birth that received the place of honor on these walls, mostly men, and all bigoted, going back ten centuries. Somewhere on this wall, his father’s portrait not yet awoken hung. His mother portrait would not have a place in this hall, but the Ladies parlor somewhere at the back of the Manor, where the in-laws hung, forgotten.
Hari jolted at the over stimuli of his taxed penis and didn’t think he could get hard so soon. But the look in Draco’s eyes told Hari he had other ideas than to stroke Hari to hardness again.
“Sheryl!” C’iemone called from somewhere behind him. “Hari is almost done. We are icing down his legs and chest now. His arms were graciously spared, but that was over the fact he didn’t have overly dark and thick hair on his arms in the first place. Arlys is getting the costumes. Draco’s is a bit rushed, but we only had like an hour to prepare his.”
Kreacher tried and failed to reel his master back from the brink of insanity, before he did something unforgivable, like offer him clothes.
He knew that he was downright nasty to Hari’s friends while in school. Jealousy could do that to a person, but there was also the feud with the Weasleys. And Damn it, Draco just realized that Bill Weasley probably told the rest of the redheaded turnip clan about them living with Hari. That wouldn’t go over very well with the Order member’s either, seeing as he was a former Death Eater and his mother considered a Death Eater symphasizer, as she was married to one. Never mind that he and his mother were considered blood traitors by their former circles.
Was that a drunken flush to Hari's cheeks or embarrassment? "I'll show you mine, if you show me yours." Was the serious response he got instead. Draco found himself the one blushing.
"You can't use magic in front of Muggles, you'll have Ministry officials all over this club. You don't want that." Justin accused haughtily.
Like the parlor the drawing room was spacious with windows overlooking the street. Directly across from the window and adjacent to their door layed a dormant fireplace. On one side of the fireplace was a curtained archway that led who-knows-where, and on the other nearest them, a grandfather clock. The majority of the furniture was shoved against the parallel walls. Those not covered by giant once-white sheets were moth eaten and faded. The curtains were in tatters as if Doxy’s lived in them for quite a while. But Hari didn’t see any hint of one currently living in the room.
“Disowned?” She asked Draco taking a guess that he might have been so if he came out to his parents. Well-to-do Heterosexual father’s would rather disinherit their children and save face in the community rather than admit they have a homosexual child. She would no. When she graduated culinary school and opened Sheryl’s Place, she sent a letter to her baby sister with an airline ticket. It wasn’t her sister who came. John Mason was furious that he left the United States. After finding out his whereabouts, he hopped on the first redeye flight to confront his wayward son. Finding his prodigal son in drag was not what he expected. Her father cursed her out, calling her all kinds of derogatory and homophobic words, and finally ended with “You are not a child of God, and neither are you mine.” Sheryl expected the response, but back then she wasn’t as confident in herself as she is now. It hurt.
"Okay, okay...we'll stop." When Draco went to step away from Hari, his legs buckled and Draco caught him. He sat down with Hari's legs over his lap and head once more on his shoulder, and his hands carded through damp and messy hair. Draco decided to talk.
Raising one long sleeve to his nose, he breathed deeply and then slowly exhaled, letting his scent waff out to settle over the fabric. He did this over and over again, rubbing hands, neck, cheek, and nose over clothes after clothes; effortlessly letting his scent mingle and settle.
A little girl with auburn hair and curious blue eyes escaped the grasp of her papa and ran to the alley entrance. “Mary? Mary? Come back.” The desperate cry of one of the men with her called after her. She stood confused when she didn’t see the black motorbike tucked away.
The fourth and final time I saw Malfoy was in the midst of the Final Battle of Hogwarts. He was trying to escape but a Death Eater had cornered him and was about to kill him. Malfoy had no wand, as I was using his wand. He was trying to talk his way out of being killed when I stunned the Death Eater, and Ron punched Malfoy, knocking him out, for claiming to still be a Death Eater after I had risked all our lives to go back and save him. I believe he was just trying to escape and save himself, but had no way to really explain this to my irate friend in the commotion.
He shared a bemused look with Draco as he moved back to his position. Andromeda had a particularly difficult task as she held her grandson cradled in one hand and the green candle in the other. Raising it high and securing Teddy closer, she began to chant her part of the ritual.
"I don't know what to say, bae. He was your father. You had to love him at one point, he was in your life, influencing you, providing for you. I'm kind of jealous actually." Draco leaned up at this, one hand on the arm, the other the chest.
But before they entered the outer room, Narcissa paused. “You might want to cover up that love bite, my son left on your neck, Corbeau.” Narcissa said, cheerily.
"You're forgetting, Mother, we were going to burn the place down anyway." Narcissa only laughed and gave a quick squeeze around the shoulder.
As Kreacher made himself busy with the tea tray and scones, Harry fought his pounding headache as every scrape of the silverware and tink of the china felt like a team muggle construction workers drilling holes in his brain with jackhammers. The only consolation was he know longer felt ill just at the smell of the too buttery scones.
He found himself patting his head self-cautiously. Hari combed his hair-some of the time. Mostly it just did what it liked, so why bother.  Something Draco said made Hari’s cheeks burn uncomfortably. Did Draco just use shagged and hair in the same sentence while talking about him?
Organizing clothes was a favorite hobby of his. Whenever he got a chance back at the manor, he’d arrange clothes in his wardrobe. Sometimes by color, other times by season, or function. One time in particular he had arranged them into individual items. He never got tired of this part.
Her scales were so flaky and itchy. Dragons do not shed their skin like reptiles, the mother has to burn them off. So when I had the all clear, I took my dragonhide gloves from my potion kit, and used them to place her in the hearth. If I had a more controlled environment, I would use
“Ah, sorry.” Hari whispered as he withdrew his finger in embarrassment. For a moment Hari had forgotten that he himself permanently silenced the last voice of Walburga Black.
"There you go champ." Draco said with false merriment. "that's for Hari. He doesn't hold grudges. Well, unless it's with me. So have a good life."
“Dra...Draco!!!” Hari stammered out flushing even more. “You can’t just say things like that.” He hissed.
"Ollivander told me that my wand core came from the same Dragon as my mother's. Our wand cores are brothers."
Officer Sanderson scowled as he looked back at the door he just came from. Just now his partner was out there rousing some serial homeless person from loitering and panhandling in front of a shoe shop across the way. He didn't always agree with the laws, but he had to enforce them. He tried to get them help, into a shelter, or rehab, off the streets into housing units. But there was only so much he could do.
On Draco's face was a look of pure horror as he wanted to just sink into the floor like a ghost of Hogwarts.
But he didn’t remember the incident as it played out in his mind now. Before that very moment all he could remember was the point up to that first bite, being thrown in his cupboard, and waking up in the hospital three days later on Monday night. Why had Dumbledore used
The man gave Draco a hard stare. "Sorry," Draco said raising his hands in surrender "didn't see you there." The man's eyes widened in what Draco recognized as recognition.
Trying to entice Hari into his bed, be tried for sultry but just sounded silly to Hari's ears, said; "Care to join me, Potter? You know you want to." Draco then giggled.
"Circe, Hari!" Draco exclaimed. "My housemates and I always wondered if you even owned a comb!" Draco said with a mischievous glint in his eyes.
Harry knew he wasn't. One time at school, they served crab cakes and a kid, Liam was allergic. He had a silver bracelet on his wrist that said so. Liam gave him his portion. It was the most belly filling meal he had at school. Then Dudley and Pier forced Liam to eat one, and his whole face swelled up and he was run to the hospital. The school never served them again, they also banned strawberries and peanut butter.
The howling of the wind died down, signially the end of the ceremony. The sound of the bonfire’s crackling fire and the continuous call of the crickets could be heard. In the sudden silence, only the sound of the crackling fire of the bonfire and the quick breaths of those and breath of the living souls in the yard could be heard.
My plan was ruined. Madam Hooch was gone, no doubt would be gone the entire class hour, and Potter would never see me fly. My hand reached into my slit pocket in my robe and found Longbottom’s Remembrall. I could still get him to pay attention to me after all. So I taunted him. I wanted to fly and I wanted Harry Potter to fly with me. I did finally get him in the air, but as an opponent.
The first House Quidditch match is today. Harry will be playing Seeker. Because of Harry's fame there will be a lot of people in the visitors stands cheering for Harry.
Was Professor Snape right in his outrage when he said, “raising the boy like a pig for slaughter, only to die at the right moment”? Before he could reflect on this new development the fire in the hearth blazed loud and green and seemed to spit out Bill Weasley.
“This is not about your inability to control your alpha.  Not completely. You must understand that Hari is not yet eighteen. You are at the mercy of
I didn't go to the hospital wing, because I didn't want anyone to know about how much pain my own Father caused. I am not very good at managing pain on my own though. Zabini noticed I was having a difficult time walking and offered to get me a numbing agent his mother gave him when he was accepted into Hogwarts. I do not know why his mother felt the need to give him a translucent numbing potion, but it helped with the pain.
Hari nodded sadly, sudden tears prickling his eyes. “Yeah, third year I helped him escape the Dementors. Our home now is where he eventually fled to, afterwards and before...”
Hari suddenly remembered, all the times Draco pulled away and the distinct time this afternoon where Draco poked Hari’s chest hard to make a point.
"I haven't any money," Harry lied. He had some money, but he was saving it for emergencies. like customer restrooms in which he had to buy at least one item to use.
The lower level was packed with sweaty bodies gyrating and grabbling with each other for space and partners. The fifth and final song for the first set began, and Mary. Queen of Scotts began to sing a very abt song for the club, Whitney Houston
Andromeda didn't know what to say to the angry and hurt boy sitting in her arms. Luckily she didn't have to. They both felt the shift in the wards. Someone was trying to come in through the Floo Network and they were not authorized to come through. The wards were letting them know of that intrusion.
