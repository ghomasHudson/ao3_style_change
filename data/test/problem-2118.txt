“Can I move to your back it might be a little more comfortable that way.” Harry giggled and Draco rearranged her so he was now giving her a piggyback ride. Draco walked through the halls to the library, and when they got there, Draco walked over to the book shelves and started looking through them. He found a few books and brought them down and set Harry in the chair and then moved to the chair next to her.
“See the difference between Draco and my father are the bond I have with Draco. Draco can just touch me and my emotions mellow out.” Harry stated as she walked up behind Draco and nuzzled her face into his hair inhaling his smell, before she lifted her head and turned back towards Sirius.
“Yes, we’ll go to the Manor first for you to fill out that paperwork, and then I can go to the Ministry for Mr. Black.” Lucius said, and then he stepped through the flames.
“Raped?” Everyone turned to see Draco standing in the open doorway, his hand still on the door handle. “Twice?”
“No, not at all. Though you have to think. I was speaking Parseltongue in there sometimes, so the real question is what do they think you’re having sex with?” Harry joked and Draco’s head snapped up and looked at Harry. Harry started laughing as he saw Draco’s expression, and Draco realized that Harry was joking so he started laughing too.
“Technically, no. I’m courting you, Potter. Though I do have to say yesterday shouldn’t have happened since I was going to court you.”
“Harry, oh merlin. How are you?” Ginny asked as she ran up and wrapped her arms around Harkin. When Ginny pulled away, she took Harkin’s face between her hands to look at the bruise on her face. “It looks better than it should, but I am sure Draco did something to help with it last night.” Ginny stated, and Harkin blushed a little bit.
“Cissy, you don’t have to apologize. To be honest I probably would have done the same thing if I was the one watching you be thrown out on the streets, Cissy. You, Draco, and Harry are welcome here as long as you want to stay. I will have three rooms accommodated for you and the boys. Make yourselves at home, and I will set the rooms. Sit, Cissy, please.” Narcissa walked over to the couch and sat down on the couch, and Draco and Harry followed her over to the couch and sat down next to her. Draco wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulder, and Harry rested his hand on Draco’s inner thigh.
“It’s alright, Lucius. The real question is what are we going to do? The Dark Lord is going to use her to his advantage, and possibly against the Order. If he has Harry Potter, the tables have turned on us. Harry can get the Prophecy, and the Dark Lord can convince her to get it for him.”
“It’s alright, Ron. I don’t blame you; I was just waiting for you to make the first move. I don’t mind. I have gotten a lot of work done on the house over the summer. I have the main floor completely renovated and the fourth floor is completely done as well. The house is more colorful and open. It’s not as gloomy as it was before when it was the Order headquarters. Ask Hermione, she helped me reorganize the library last week.”
“Harry, what’s the matter? What are you talking about? Of course I want this, why wouldn’t I want this?” Draco injected as he stood up and wrapped his arms around Harry. Harry tried to pull away, but Draco held him tight. “No, Harry, hear me out. Please. I can’t lose you, Harry. I just can’t.” Harry looked at Draco and he saw the look in his eyes that said that he was serious.
“Draco, I am sorry. I can’t guarantee that nothing will happen to him. That’s just part of life. You should know that right away, Draco.”
“Draco, I thought you said that you were going on holiday, and wouldn’t be able to pick me up until a month into summer break? Why are you here?” Harry asked with surprise in his voice. Harry just stared at Draco and his mother. He wasn’t even packed yet because he hadn’t been expecting Draco for another two weeks.
Harry started pounding on the door trying to get out, and when that didn’t work Harry started screaming at his uncle to let him out of his tiny little cupboard. Harry eventually gave up and he sank to the floor, and he started to think that this was going to end his relationship with Draco, when he heard the front door bang open. Shit, Uncle Vernon is pissed, Harry thought to himself. Harry didn’t even look up as the cupboard door opened, and someone kneeled down in front of him. Harry didn’t want to look up and see what he thought he would see, but then something surprised him.
“Oh, raven, can I fix this for you?” Draco cooed, and Harkin blushed before nodding. Draco leaned over the edge of the tub to grab his wand out of his pant pocket, and Harkin backed away just enough to give him room to cast the spell. “There. At least the pain and swelling should go down. We will have to get some Bruise-Healing Paste from Madam Pomfrey before breakfast tomorrow for the actual bruise, but it shouldn’t hurt as much.” Draco finished as he placed his wand back on his pants, and he pulled Harkin back into his lap. Harkin snuggled into his lap, and Draco just wrapped his arms around her with one hand resting on her small baby bump. Harkin soon fell asleep, and Draco stood with her in his arms and grabbed a couple of towels off the rack before walking back into their room. He placed one towel on the bed to place Harkin on top of before drying himself, and then taking another towel to dry Harkin off before tucking her into their bed. Draco then pulled on a pair of his pajama pants, and he sat up in bed working on their transfigurations essay. When he finished, he pulled out one of their textbooks and started reading it out loud to mostly himself, but also to the twins and Harkin. Eventually he read himself to sleep, with Harkin cradled in his one arm and the textbook lying across his chest.
“Like I said, there may be side effects from being trapped in his worst nightmares and memories. Potter has been through more than most people his age, and who knows what happened while he was at the Dursley’s.” Severus said.
“Master Harry isn’t doing very well, Master Draco. Her screaming has increased even as Mistress Narcissa tries to help put the healing slave on her wound. I don’t know how much longer Master Harry will stay alive at the progression of her pain.” Tally said and then she noticed the other people in the room and the elf shied away behind Draco. “Tally is sorry, Master Draco. Tally didn’t know you were in company.”
“I am going to get out of here with or without your help, Tom, but you are going to end here, I can promise you that.” Harry then pushed all the memories of anyone else he may have forgotten towards Voldemort, and then anything else that made him happy. Harry watched as Voldemort slowly faded away, and when he was gone, a fireplace turned green and Harry stepped towards it.
“Yes, I think you are right, but I just can’t get past the fact that I feel like I’m a guest in a home that is supposed to be mine as well. I don’t think Lucius will really start to warm up to me until after Draco and I get married. Narcissa just wants to make sure that I feel welcome at the manor, but I don’t because it’s not my home. I don’t have a home, Remi, and I don’t know if I ever will be able to call any place home, I don’t know how.” Harkin whispered.
“I’ll write a note to Professor Snap about your tardiness, and Miss Potter not appearing today. I shall be right back, if you will watch her for a moment longer.”
“The potion was supposed to expel the bit of the Dark Lord’s soul. I pulled it together quickly and needed to tie her to someone else. You. I didn’t know it would expel everything that wasn’t you or her, but a good thing came out of a bad thing.”
“I would love to take you up on that offer, but I would have to talk to Remus first.” Sirius said as they all walked out of the room and towards the lobby.
“Yes, that would be nice, Professor.” McGonagall walked into the room, and everyone immediately quieted. She continued through the room and to a spot in the wall Harry hadn’t noticed before, the wall opened up like a door, and they stepped inside and the door closed. The lights flickered on and Harry stood there in amazement staring at the room.
“Can everyone leave? I feel Miss Potter needs time to recuperate and stress is not good for her healing process.” Mel stated.
“How did you get in here? No one even knows this place exists with the Fidelius Charm placed on the house.”
“It’s alright, Mom. I understand. You had to do what was best for me, and I understand that, but I want to make sure that you are safe, Mom. You and Harry are the two people that I care about most, and I want you to know that I want you to be safe, too, Mom. That is all that matters, is that everyone I care about is safe,” Draco whispered.
“We will be right out, mother.” Draco leaned back down and kissed Harry on the lips quickly, and then he pulled Harry’s collar up a little bit to hide the new hickey that Draco created on his neck. “We don’t want them to suspect anything, do we?” Draco leaned back in and kissed Harry on the lips and then he lightly kissed the hickey on Harry’s neck. “Let’s head down. Shall we?”
“Yeah, he didn’t know. At the time anyway. I was trying to find a way to help Remi.” Sirius said with a smile as he looked at Remus.
“Well, it looks like tiara, and it reads ‘Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure,’ and it has an oval shaped blue sapphire on it.”
Harry rolled over so he was straddling Draco’s hips. “Well, Draco, if you are going to tease me. Then you have to, because now I’m not tired at all.” Draco pulled Harry down and locked lips with Harry, and then he pushed his tongue through Harry’s lips and rolled over on top of Harry.
“Snape, you do that and you might lose a hand.” Lupin said as he walked into the room. “I have another solution.” He said as he pulled a goblet out of his pocket and set it on the desk, and he grabbed Severus’ hand and slit open his palm. “Get as much blood into the goblet as you can.” Severus held his hand over the goblet and squeezed as much blood out of the wound as he could. Everyone watched as Draco’s head snapped up at the smell of blood, and Remus cast a spell over Severus’ hand and the skin knitted together. Remus picked up the goblet, and he slowly walked over to Draco and placed the goblet in front of him. Draco snatched the goblet and downed the liquid, and when he was done, he gently put the goblet down and sat on the floor next to Harry. He just laid down and curled up next to Harry’s body, and everyone watched as he fell asleep.
“Yes, no matter how unnatural and unconventional your pregnancy is, I think of those children inside you as my grandchildren.” Narcissa explained.
“No, I was never interested in vampires. I had no reason to learn about them, and our Defense classes haven’t exactly been complete. We learned about them third year with you, but not very in depth.”
“Well, that depends. Draco, I know you’re standing out there, just come in already.” Hermione said as she turned toward the door. Draco stepped out into the doorway and into the room. Draco walked up to the bed that Harry was lying on. Draco sat on the edge of the bed, and he placed his hand on the other side of Harry’s legs.
“Ah, Potter. You are finally awake to endure my torture. I’m sorry I got a little spell happy while you were asleep and started already. I hope you don’t mind.”
“Thank you, Dray, for reminding me. Family is sadly something that I don’t know much about, and I forget how it works sometimes. I love you.” She whispered.
“You are family now Miss Potter, I cannot deny that especially when I see the two of you. Which brings me to my next order of business. The two of you officially getting married. I understand your guardianship will be called into question, but I’ve been over the paperwork behind what Dumbledore did in 1981, and he had no right to relocate you, meaning you technically have no guardians, because no one technically claimed you after your parents’ deaths. Black was arrested, and Lupin wouldn’t have been able in his condition without Black. Dumbledore had no rights to you, but your mother had one other guardian she appointed.”
“Harry says it’s in Hogwarts, and that it once belonged to Ravenclaw or Gryffindor, Professor.” Draco said without looking up from Harry.
“Uh, sure,” Tonks said as she backed out of the room. She was about to close the door, when she turned back. “And you should learn to cast better silencing charms,” she stated with a smirk, and then she walked out of the room shutting the door behind her. Draco pulled his wand out and cast a locking spell and a silencing charm. Draco pulled Harry back onto his lap and pulled him in for a kiss.
“I think she is spending too much time with you and your mother. She is getting way to good at hiding her emotions in public.” Severus stated.
“This time it was another student, who is awaiting for the results of them hopefully waking before his punishment is delivered. Not to mention his parents, who will most likely be furious with him quite like his younger sister is right now.” Severus stated, and Narcissa looked up from Draco at that.
“I know, darling, but I think you need a little support right now, and if anyone knows about this type of family drama it is me.” Narcissa smiled, and Harkin was about to ask her what she meant when Narcissa cut her off. “For another time, darling. Draco knows the story. Right now you should explain.”
“No, that’s not the first time that someone has had rough sex with me. I was upset the first time because it hurt like a bitch, but after the fifth time it was quite enjoyable. If you want me to be upset I could but I’d rather not because I’m not.”
“Lucius and Thaddeus got to her. They brewed a potion that made her magic unstable, which is causing her to reject the babies. Can you make the antidote?” Melody questioned, and Severus looked between Melody and Harkin, he cast a few spells and then nodded. Severus then turned and billowed out of the hospital wing towards Madam Pomfrey's office, and Melody sighed as she sat down in the chair next to Harkin's bed. They waited for a few hours for Severus to return, Melody periodically checking Harkin's condition to make sure she wasn’t going to lose the babies. Draco fell asleep an hour after Severus left, his magic doing its best to keep Harkin and the babies alive and stable, but it definitely drained him.
“Bloody Hell!” Pansy exclaimed as she snagged Harkin’s hand to get a better look at the ring. “I’m kind of upset about breaking that marriage contract with you, but I couldn’t handle making babies with my best friend.”
“I love you, too. Do you feel better, love?” Draco questioned as he rolled so he was on his back and Harkin was lying across his chest.
“Yes, I know, but when we the last time you fed. For real fed.” Harry said as he stroked Draco’s jaw line. “You need it.” Harry continued as he drew Draco closer with his finger, and soon Draco was kissing the side of Harry’s neck again. Harry’s fingers slid up into Draco’s hair and curled into it. The second Draco broke skin, Draco completely bit down, and Harry moaned in pleasure. Harry’s hips buckled upwards into Draco’s as his back arched. Harry’s panting breath filled the room, and Draco was mesmerized and enveloped in the task at hand. Neither of them noticed as the door opened and a group of people walked in.
“Both. So, I have been talking to Fred and George more since the summer, and they have been snooping at Diagon Alley spaces for their new Joke Shop, using the money that you gave them from winning the Triwizard Tournament, and they heard that a new restaurant is going in a few stalls down from where they are looking to put their joke shop. So, Fred asked me to be his date, they want to be friendly neighbors.” Hermione squeed, and Harkin smiled at her.
Harry is the Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team and also the seeker, though he got on the team differently than he had in the books. Draco and Harry had been messing around during their combine flying lesson with the Gryffindor’s while Madam Hooch was taking Neville to the hospital wing for breaking his wrist. What the two boys didn’t know was the Madam Hooch ran into Professor Snape on her way into the school and asked him to go out and check on the students while she escorted Longbottom to the hospital wing.
“A family issue that I need to inform you about.” Draco stated as he glanced form Dumbledore to Harry and back.
“Yes, actually, because it was something that I was actually good at and I didn’t have to pretend that I wasn’t for my cousin’s sake, so I didn’t get my arse kicked every time.” Harkin stated.
“Well, I was going to throw a party in commemoration of Miss Potter and her successful defeat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, but seeing your attitudes I don’t think I will.”
“Harry, its September 2nd, 1998. You’re missing five months of your life. That is better than what it could have been, but there’s still a lot of things that you need to catch up on. Luckily, it’s only the second day of the term, and classes really haven’t started yet.”
“It isn’t, dear. I plan parties. That is really all I do, other than tend to the gardens. I do a New Year’s party, a Valentine’s Day party, a National day, and Easter, Halloween, and Christmas.”
“Are you two coming?” Draco stood and placed Harry on the floor, and they walked over to the fireplace. They all stepped into the green flames and appeared in the lobby at St. Mungos. Narcissa walked up to the front desk and asked about Mr. Weasley. She came back over to them, and they followed her up to the first floor and found his room. Harry peeked in the room to see Mrs. Weasley, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny sitting around his bed, and Harry was about to back out when Hermione saw her and jumped out of her chair.
“Dray, do you think I would have allowed you to do that if I wasn’t okay with it.” Draco gave Harry a look of confusion, so Harry elaborated, “Yes, Dray. I’m alright with it.” Harry pulled Draco in and kissed his lips. “Dray, I love you. You don’t have to apologize for this; I wanted you to do this or otherwise this wouldn’t have happened. Its fine, Dray.” Harry pulled Draco back in and started kissing Draco again. The two continued kissing until there was a sudden banging on the bedroom door.
“If that is your compromise with mother, I guess I can deal with that. Just knock before entering the bedroom please.” Draco stated before he turned and continued down the corridor.
Her husband was never going to see them again she was going to guarantee that, even if Lucius had to go to Azkaban. After what Lucius told Narcissa, she wasn’t going to allow him to see the boys, and she was going to talk to Professor Dumbledore about not allowing Lucius to see Draco or Harry. Even if Harry wasn’t her son, Narcissa really did care about him like he was a second son, and now that Draco and Harry were together, it was even more pertinent for her to keep both of her boys safe. When she finally finished planning the trip, and she told the boys they were thrilled to hear that the trip was still on, but they were still a little concerned.
“Contraceptive potions. I want you to start taking the potion. It prevents pregnancy, and if you aren’t pregnant, I don’t want to find out you are until after you graduate from Hogwarts.”
Okay, so I know last chapter I declared Harley as Harry's chosen female name, but I have recently been given the name Harkin Jamelynn Potter. Which I think is great and kind of suits Harry's character more. I've been told that Harkin means fiery one, which fits, so. I know I said I was going with Harley, but being the Author I have the right to change my mind sometimes. I hope you like it, and I hope you enjoy the next chapter.
“Draco, I’m compromised. He will never believe that I am there for him or anything I say for that matter. He will most likely try and break down my walls I’ve successfully built and maintained for 16 years. I have no chance of making it through that. I can’t help her, Draco, but you can. You are a very skilled potions maker. You have the ability to help and save Harry Potter, Draco.” Severus said as he gripped Draco’s shoulders as he stepped away from him, shaking his head.
“Whoa.” Harry whispered as the garden came into view. “How are they in bloom right now?” Harry asked as she stepped towards the garden and then she stuttered.
“It’s alright, Tally. I said try to go unnoticed, if you were seen it is fine I can deal with Weasley.” Draco said as he tried to comfort his elf. “Tally, can you do me one more favor? Keep me posted on Master Harry’s condition.”
She appeared, and looked Draco up and down. “I sure hope, you have good reason to be asking for a healer from St. Mungos to come to my ward and look at Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy.”
Draco matched his thrusts inside her with the slow pace he set, and Harry felt as if she was going to explode with passion. “Dray…f-faster…” Harry attempted, and Draco must have understood because his pace slowly quickened until it was a brutal pace. Harry was having a hard time with the sensations and just let Draco have his way, and she just laid there a panting moaning mess as he thrusted into her. Soon Draco’s cumming inside her and they are both screaming out in ecstasy as they finish.
“Yes, turns out he’s been playing Voldemort just doing the part that Dumbledore planned for him to do. At least according to him. I’m not so certain yet, but Harry took to the story quickly.”
“Six parties. Merlin, I have no sense of how to do parties. The only reason I have an alright wardrobe is because I had help. I can’t plan a party.” Harry stated, and she felt like she was going to have a panic attack.
“I am going to take them out to Albus and burn them on his grave. I think he would have wanted to have them completely destroyed despite that fact that some of these items where owned by the founders.”
“Boys,” Narcissa stated with a sneer on her face, one like the one that his father always wore when something went his way.
She slowly moved her hand down as to not wake Draco, and she slowly turned so she was facing him as she reached down to unbutton Draco’s trousers. She finally got them unbuttoned, and she slipped her hands inside so she could slip his pants down to free his erection. She kissed him lazily before she slid down in the bed so her face was level with his crotch and erection pointing out at her, and she gently moved Draco onto his back so she would have better access and a better angle. She gently positioned Draco exactly as she wanted him, making sure the sheets were pulled up to underneath his armpits.
Draco’s eyes zoomed from Harry to Vernon in an instant. “You cannot treat him that way, he is your bloody nephew, not your bloody slave. Harry is coming with me and you have no say,” Draco shouted, and he turned to Harry and whispered, “Go pack, Harry. You’re coming home with us.” Harry finally look up at Draco and his emerald eyes met Draco’s grey, and then Harry’s eyes zoomed over to Vernon and back to Draco before he ran upstairs and packed his trunk. When Harry was finished shoving his stuff into his trunk, and he grabbed Hedwig and his trunk, and he pulled them down the stairs.
“Yes, I won’t take an innocent life because of my mistake. I can’t do that to a precious baby. I won’t and your parents can’t make me.” Draco stepped forwards and sat down on the bed next to Harry.
“Mother, why are you standing there like that? What is going on?” The woman just stood there like she was waiting for them to move. “Mother?” Draco questioned.
“Yes, but they will be Malfoy elves, not the school elves. Severus said Mother worked something out with Dumbledore so only our elves can enter this room. Including Dobby, who Mother has taken back in and is paying him one galleon a week. Which for us is really nothing.” Draco explained. “Mother and Uncle Sev wanted to make sure no one could get inside this room without permission. They want the babies’ safe, and us to not have to worry about the possible Death Eaters that are still out there, and they didn’t want me to tell you, but I feel if anyone deserves to know it is you. Thaddeus Nott escaped from the Aurors again. He is still out there, and no one is more upset than me, because if I could get my hands on him, I would kill him, but you need to know, he might try something. Severus is doing everything to make sure the wards around the school are in tacked and impenetrable.”
“Miss Granger, Mr. Weasley, I do have to insist that if you are going to overwhelm Miss Potter than I do have to ask you to leave. She has been through quite an ordeal, and she needs rest. Mr. Malfoy you are only permitted as long as you are welcome.”
“Nothing is going to happen to me, or the twins. We are in one of the safest places in the wizarding world. Plus, I think your father would have to fight through some of the Slytherins to get to me, or even you, Theo.” Harkin stated, and Theo smiled at her before giving her a hug.
“Dray, what does this make us? What are we now?” Harry contemplated as he gave a questioning look to Draco.
“Worse, and whether he gets better is going to be determined by how you answer a series of questions, starting with what spells you used on Harry while he was in St. Mungos?”
“And may I ask where the book is, Draco?” Lucius asked, and Draco’s face fell as he patted his pockets and looked back up at his father.
“What is the last thing you remember?” Harry had to think about that question. He wasn’t sure; what kind of question was this. Harry thought back to what he last remembered.
“Yes, but wouldn’t this spell here work for that?” Draco looked that over and they went on conversing like that back and forth until they had ironed out the wrinkles. Draco kept glancing up at Harry to make sure that he wasn’t too far gone. Once they had finished Draco put the parchment down and looked up at Harry to find him looking back at him. “Potter?” Draco questioned, but Harry was unresponsive, he didn’t even blink. “We need to hurry. Start casting those spells,” Draco ordered as he rushed over to Harry’s side, and closed his eyes so they weren’t staring, and then he placed his fingers over the pulse point in Harry’s neck. It was still beating, very faintly, but it was beating.
“The cup of Helga Hufflepuff. Found in my aunt’s Gringotts vault.” Draco stated as he set Harry down, and Harry leaned against his chest with Draco’s arms wrapped around him.
“He is on his way. He is just a little…stiff this morning.” Harkin smiled as she come feel Draco walked into the room, and she looked over to see he tried to find his most loose-fitting trousers he owned, and she smiled at him. Draco just glared back at her, and she laughed.
“I care.” Draco growled. “He is asleep and I would like to keep him that way for a while. He needs to get better and rest. I will not let you jeopardize that, Lupin.” Draco stated, and he pushed Lupin backwards away from the door. Lupin came back and shoved Draco. “What are you going to do wolf; it’s not a full moon right now. I’m stronger than you.” Draco growled.
“Well, there are many options for that, and being fifth years, we’ll be having talks with our head of house about where we want to go after school, since we’ll be able to drop classes after we take our O.W.L.s this spring, and focus our schooling more onto the career we want to go into.”
Severus and Lucius hurried back to the castle, and they burst into the headmaster’s office, where everyone was still talking. Narcissa was bargaining with Albus about where Harry should be placed, but they all became quiet and turned towards the two men as they burst into the office.
.” Harry sneered the last word as she turned away from Malfoy, but he could faintly hear the tears streaming down her face with the slight sobs. Malfoy walked up behind her and wrapped his arms around her and laid a kiss on top of her head when he felt her tense inside his grasp.
“You are welcome, Miss Potter. Draco keep what I told you in mind, if there is one thing I know about relationships, it is how to ruin them. Don’t push her away, not with this bond between you.” Severus stated.
“I don’t know, it was closest door, so I just pulled you through it. I wasn’t going to go around by his body that would take longer, and I didn’t want to go anywhere near him,” Harry tried to explain.
They heard the door bang open, and then they could hear spells being cast. Draco wanted to know what was going on, but he wasn’t going to risk leaving Harry. Draco heard the door’s magical lock click and the door swung open. In the doorway was standing a man that Draco knew from some of Harry’s pictures of his parents, Sirius Black.
“Well, there goes that plan. I was hoping if you knew you would go with it. I don’t have a wand though, but I do have a snake.” Harry said as Nagini slithered out from behind her. “Please, just cooperate Arthur. I really don’t want to hurt you, you’re family.”
“No, not at all. I enjoy it actually, because it means you’re thinking long term and not just a one off and done. I love the fact that you see a relationship with me when everyone else will think otherwise.” Draco commented, and Harry propped himself up on his elbow.
“No, I really didn’t have a problem with it. Though I was often thinking of other things than girls and sex. I was usually fighting for my life or trying to figure out what was going on in the school.”
“Why would Master Draco use a different elf, has Tally done something wrong, Master Draco?” Tally muttered and Draco could see the tears in her eyes.
“No, it’s fine. He’s busy, and he’s cleaning up Lucius’ mess and reestablishing the Malfoy name. He needs to do this, and I understand that.” Harkin stated.
“I know, but you got to think how hard it is for me to be back. I’ve had the worst past two years here and now I’m back after all that I’ve done and everyone is looking at me differently. I just want what I did to be forgotten, because I just did it to save myself and the people I care about.” Draco said and then buried his face in Harry’s shoulder. Harry smiled, and he brought his one hand up and laced his fingers in Draco’s hair and leaned his forehead against the side of Draco’s head.
“She shares magic with you, my little dragon. Of course she is connected to you. You feel your other half, and when she is gone you don’t feel whole. I think I know how to make her better, and in return you. I’ll be right back.” Narcissa walked out of the room, and she walked down the hall to the room they had for Harry. She walked over to the wardrobe and shrunk it down along with the dresser and her trunk. She then walked over to the bed and cast a stability charm so Harry wouldn’t be disturbed. She then levied Harry off the bed and walked out of the room with Harry hovering behind her.
“They’re beautiful.” Harry whispered as she reached her hand out and brushed her fingers against the petals.
“Alright.” Narcissa smiled. “So the first thing that you should know is to work from the outside in. Soup spoon, salad fork, dinner spoon, dinner fork, and dinner knife. The dessert spoon and fork are up here. Your bread plate and butter knife are above your dinner fork. Glasses from the inside out: water glass, champagne glass, red wine glass, white wine glass.”
“We will take this information into account while we investigate this incident, Mr. Malfoy.” At that moment, Professor Umbridge strolled into the hospital wing.
“Merlin, the way you say my first name. It’s intoxicating.” Draco turned towards the side and started nibbling on the side of Harry’s neck. Harry moaned, and resting her arms around Draco’s shoulders pulling him closer. Draco took a step forwards, and he gently pushed Harry back against the desk. Harry pulled Draco back with her and slipped her hand down from Draco’s shoulder to his waist. Draco’s hands slipped up Harry’s thigh and under her shirt, and he slipped her shirt off. “You make a gorgeous woman, Potter. Not that you weren’t a handsome man…” Draco whispered against Harry’s lips before he closed the rest of the distance between their lips.
“No, I guess I cannot, but I am still the Minister, Mr. Malfoy.” Fudge said as he stood up and walked towards Draco.
“I think you are right, cub, but this will always be home, and you will always be welcome back home. You are Siri’s and my little boy, now girl, and I’m sorry if I still haven’t gotten used to that, but I think given the situation, I’m obligated to be a little confused and take a little time to process that in my mind.” Remus whispered.
“No, it actually looks better like that.” Draco looked up and started laughing with Harry. They were still laughing when they walked up to Narcissa. She just gave them a look and she took Harry’s trunk and owl and sent them to the Manor.
“Yes, they are going to sneak into each other’s rooms at night anyway, and that is if they even sneak around at night. They are two grown boys, and they should have enough sense to not do certain thing at certain times.” Narcissa turned towards Draco and Harry and stared them down; both the boys looked down at the floor and didn’t look up until they couldn’t feel Narcissa’s eyes not barring into them anymore. They both looked up at each other at the same time, and they smirked at each other before they let them slip and they stared up at Narcissa.
“I love you too, Har, and I can’t lose you, not to my father.” Draco whispered after he pulled away and rested his forehead against hers.
“Draco, if you stare at me any harder, you will burn a hole in me,” Harry commented as Draco quickly glanced away as if he was trying to make it look like he wasn’t staring at Harry. Harry stood up and rested his hands on either of Draco’s shoulders, and forced him to look back up at him. Draco finally looked up at Harry and Harry said, “I’m fine. Trust me, I’ve been through worse.” Draco nodded at Harry and stepped away.
“What Draco has or hasn’t done isn’t your concern, though what the Malfoy’s do to you when they find out you have me is.” Harkin stated.
“Did you know that Rowena Ravenclaw had a daughter? But her daughter died by the hands of the one she loved before she could have any children of her own. She is the only founder that knowingly didn’t have any descendants. It is unknown whether or not Godric Gryffindor had any children or not.”
“I’m sorry about my breakdown earlier. I don’t know what is wrong with me lately. I don’t feel like myself.” Harkin whispered.
Pansy’s face was priceless as she turned and stormed out of the room. “So Potter, huh? Well, took you two long enough.” Blaise said. Harry’s head turned and looked at Blaise with confusion on his face. “Oh, come on, Potter. If you look in your eyes while you say things you can tell every emotion that you are feeling in that precise moment. I’m very observant, Potter. I saw what you felt every time you looked, fought, or talked to Draco. Anger, excitement, interest, amazement, lust, surprise, and acceptance. You’ve loved Draco for years, Potter.”
“My sanctuary. Place your hand on this brick.” Narcissa said as she gestured towards a brick at eye level, five from the corner, and Harry did as directed. She felt a tingling sensation as Narcissa cast a spell, and the wall slowly started to move towards the corner.
“They have their own room. They have to wait for Professor Snape to show them where it is, I’m sure.” Theo stated.
“I’m sorry, Mrs. Malfoy. I’ll contact her right away.” The receptionist said as she walked away. She came back a few minutes later. “She said she’ll meet you in her office in a few minutes. You know where that is?”
“We will figure this out, Draco. Severus did say that the processes was changed when you and Harry stole the Dark Lords powers, so maybe he isn’t completely sure how this is going to turn out yet. Maybe he is trying to figure it out and tell you everything when he figures it out. You and Harry are now the most powerful beings in the Wizarding world, literally anything can happen.”
Draco walked back downstairs to find Granger waiting impatiently at the door to the dining room. “Where is he?” Granger asked as soon as she saw Draco.
When Draco pulled away, Harry said, “I just want to make sure that this is what you wanted, because if you didn’t we can stop and never talk about this again. Then we don’t have to worry about what your parents would say or what anyone else would say, we could just be us like we always have been, and no one would know that this happened.” Harry pulled back away, but Draco kept him where he was.
Hey everyone. I know i haven't been updating this as quickly as some of you would like, but unfortunately life just gets in the way of my writing and updating. i am doing my best to update this as much as possible, but i am also still writing this fic as well, so writers block happens unfortunately. I am still active on this account, and i am still updating, i just also have a life outside of my hobby of writing. Though i am extremely happy about all of the positive reviews and comments that i have received, and that does help me keep at this. So, thank you to all who have encouraged me that they really enjoy and love this fic. as a writer, that is what helps us keep going. Now i will stop my babbling and let you read the story, unless you didn't even read this anyway, like most people don't.
“I did some research, Miss Potter, and I found a solution to your problem. It was an easy potion to brew, and I didn’t see a problem occurring with Draco brewing it. My guess is that when the Dark Lord walked into the room in the middle of the magic it created an anomaly for the potion and magic, so it stripped him of his magic and flung him from the room leaving the two of you with more magic than expected. So this is not my fault Miss Potter, this is the Dark Lord’s fault, and since you and Draco have already stripped him of his magic. I don’t see why you need to punish him more. For everything else, I will be taking him to the Ministry later today. Meanwhile you two need to practice how to keep your magic in check. If it goes haywire at school we could have a problem. Especially, since it appears the temperature is affected by your magic.”
Draco then moved his hands back over to Harry’s hips and started grinding their free erections together, and Harry slipped his hand behind Draco, finding Draco’s entrance, slipping his fingers in. Harry pushed his fingers into Draco’s entrance, and Draco groaned as Harry pushed farther into him and then slowly pulled out to push back in. As Harry pulled out and pushed back in, he slipped another finger into Draco’s entrance, and Draco gasped as the pressure was applied to his entrance.
“It is alright. We were nearly done anyway. I think she will do fine tomorrow night.” Narcissa said, and she walked out of the room.
He just sits there as Dudley and his friends hold him down and beat him bruising his ribs, every day it’s something new, and Dudley soon figures out to keep the bruises in places that people won’t see unless they see Harry without his clothes on. Harry just wishing one day that it would stop.
“Yes, I just don’t know which one I should…” Draco chuckled and walked over and flicked a series of dials and let the tub fill up with water before shutting them off and stepping in, and Harry just stared at him.
“I actually was wondering your opinion on these laws, but your defence is sound.” Harkin smiled as she leaned in and kissed Draco’s lips.
“I should be asking you what the matter is.” Harry said as he pulled Draco closer to him, and he forced Draco to wrap his arms around him. “What’s wrong?”
They appeared in front of the telephone booth that Arthur took her down at the end of the summer, and Harry stepped up to it and put in her muggle money in and she started to descend. She ended up in the Atrium a few minutes later, and stepped out as the booth started sliding back up. So she started off towards the lifts, and she headed down to the Department of Mysteries. She headed towards the door that she knew was there, and she stopped dead in her tracks when she saw Arthur standing in front of the door. He said no one would be here, he’d make sure of it. Harry didn’t know how to handle this, so she decided to improvise.
Draco stared at the letter, and he wondered how he was going to sneak into the Gryffindor common room. Draco already snuck the Marauder’s Map away from Ron, and he was sure that neither of them were going to try and pack up Harry’s things. He just had to find a way into Harry’s room in Gryffindor tower, and that’s when he noticed something scribbled on the bottom of the page.
Draco rolled so he was lying on top of Harry, and he placed his hands on her waist. “I don’t think I mind being woken up like that, love. Though the teasing is worth it to see you look at me like that.” Draco whispered, his lips barely touching hers as he spoke. She flicked her tongue out to lick her lips, and she grazed Draco’s lips in the process. Draco smirked, and he leaned forwards and rested his forehead against Harry’s.
“Well, that is a two sided coin. One I really don’t have a choice, and two I’m curious. What is it that this person could have said to make the Dark Lord fear his survival because of me?” Harry asked.
“We love you, too, fawn.” Sirius whispered back. The older men pulled away, and Sirius rested his hand on the side of Harkin’s face before he pulled away. “You are special, Harkin Jamelynn Potter. Don’t let anyone tell you any different.” Sirius stated. The man stood up, and he and Remus walked back around the table to the chairs they were sitting in before. Everyone went back to their breakfast, and they all were rather quiet.
Harkin sighed as she finished up the last of her remaining homework, and then she organized them by class for easy turn in when she gets back from break. Severus paid her a visit later that night, and he informed Harkin that he had rearranged her schedule to coincide with Draco’s; he also had got a separate room so they could share for the rest of their schooling. When he left, Harkin laid back down and tried to sleep for the next day they were heading back to Hogwarts.
“Granger, sit. The short blade is an easy fix, regular healing magic does the trick. The twins are just a little trickier, but our main concern is the sword. We don’t know how long it was left in Potter, and we don’t know what the Healers did about fixing it. That’s why I’ve asked Madam Pomfrey to owl to St. Mungos and ask. I’m to bring Potter up to the hospital wing later.” Granger settled back down in the chair and relaxed a little bit. “I owe him my freedom. He doesn’t remember anything from last night but I do, and I know what he did for me and my mother. He may have even saved my father from a worse sentence in Azkaban. I will help him to the best of my ability.”
Harry’s lips parted at the contact, and Draco slipped his tongue inside her mouth. Harry moaned into Draco’s mouth, and he slipped his hands up so they were resting just below Harry’s breasts. Draco brushed his thumbs underneath her bra and stroked the underside of her breasts, and Harry moaned. “Draco,” Harry panted as Draco pulled away slightly to breath.
“If the Dark Lord is gone, Mr. Potter is perfectly safe at Hogwarts. I have gotten rid of the Carrows, and I am looking for a new Defense teacher, Lupin. I am also need a Muggle Studies professor, but that isn’t your concern. I am also aware of Mr. Potter’s task he was given. Horcruxes. The Dark Lord had seven of them and if my calculations are correct there are two left this cup and one more. Though what it is, is unknown as is where it is.”
“Well, I will leave you to deal with whatever is in there waiting for you, and I will be back in the morning to take you down to breakfast.” Severus stated before heading back out the door they had just came through. Draco loosened his tie before walking up to the bedroom door, and he took a deep breath before walking through. When he entered, he looked about but just saw Harkin’s uniform scattered about the bedroom floor, so he followed the trail if clothes to the bathroom where he found her crying in the bathtub.
The room was about the size of the boy’s dormitory with one Queen sized bed in the middle. There were two doors off the room, and Harry walked over to the one door and found a bathroom, and in the other was a closet. “Thank you, Professor.” Harry said as he turned and hugged her.
“You’re not Draco. Where am I? What have you done to me?” Harry shouted as she continued to struggle against the ropes. “Let me go, please.” Harry begged.
“You know how much I hate that word. My mother was a mudblood, Draco,” Harry stated as he sneered the word mudblood. Harry paced around the room and avoided looking at Draco; Harry had been trying to brake Draco of that habit since their second year with the whole chamber of secrets thing, and it hadn’t been working because every time that Harry thought that he had Draco broken of the habit, he would go back home and be thrown back into the environment where it is used constantly. Draco tried to trap Harry against the wall, but that got him nowhere, because every time that he thought he almost had him Harry moved slightly and was out of his way again.
“Yes, Mistress. Cali will start right away.” The elf started moving around the room, collecting clothes and placing them in their designated place. “Where does Mistress wish Cali to place Mistress Harry’s male wardrobe?”
“Draco, you are perfectly capable. I know you are. You just have to believe in yourself, and you will be able to help her. You are her only hope, Draco. I can’t go back, but you can, and you can save her.” Severus said as he pulled Draco closer to him, and Draco stepped backwards away from him and away from Severus’ grasp.
“Draco, don’t tell me that. Please tell me you are messing with your mother, and not that you forgot the protection spells your father and I taught you.”
Harry wanted to respond but he couldn’t remember how to respond, because Draco’s hand was still holding his erection, and Draco must have realized that Harry was having a hard time thinking at all at this moment, because he suddenly let go of Harry. Harry slid down the shower wall and sat on the floor. “This is why I can’t talk to you about what I am thinking, Dray. I have a hard time thinking around you period. Especially, now that I’ve seen you naked and felt you in me and around me. Dray, I’m an awful mess, when you are around me. Why do you think I locked myself in here, away from you? I needed to think, Dray. I needed to figure out if this was real or if I was going to regret going to this relationship with you. I needed to have thinking time, and lately I haven’t been the best of thinker, and I figured it out today, when you hugged your mother. I don’t know what made me figure it out at that moment, but I realized that I was starting to doubt our relationship and I was wondering why that was, and I realized that this is the first time in a couple of days that you weren’t touching me or near me, and I just had to get away, and sort myself out before I talked to you about what was going on.” Harry paused and Draco started talking before Harry could continue.
“Yes, we can keep them in Draco’s room until it is time to pull them out of the stasis.” Narcissa said. “This is the safest place for them. Now that Draco is in the stasis no one can enter Malfoy Manor. So once you leave there is no returning. Not even using the floo, but then again if they stay here you cannot return to remove the stasis. If you took Harry back to Hogwarts with you Draco will wake up when you remove Harry’s stasis.”
“Thank you. Tell Draco I understand.” Harkin said with a sad smile. The elf nodded before popping out of the room.
She then tried to move her legs but they were pinned too, and that’s when she felt the grip change on her wrists and one of the hands slide down her arm and stop just on top of her left breast with a squeeze. She was starting to lose air, for his lips were still pressed hard against hers, and just as she felt like she was going to pass out, his lips were gone, and she was panting trying to catch her breath.
“He’s going to be alright?” Hermione asked as she ran up to Draco, and she wrapped her arms around him.
“Nothing, he hasn’t been awake long enough to eat anything. This is the longest he’s been awake in days.” Draco muttered.
“Maybe, I don’t know. We can’t dance so I don’t know.” Harkin whispered, and Draco sighed before twirling them in the direction of Remus and Draco switched Harkin into Remus’ arms and somehow managed to twirl them back onto the dance floor with ease. Harkin and Remus then kind of swayed on the dance floor to the music, and he kissed her on top of her head.
“Potter.” Draco said as he stood up and walked back to his and Potter’s room not waiting for her response to that. It would have probably been something along the lines of, well then you definitely need to work on that if Harry can notice when he’s half out of it and Harry’s not usually observant. Draco didn’t care, and he knew how observant the raven haired man can be. He noticed things about Draco that even Draco’s friends didn’t even notice. Draco entered their room and glanced over at Harry to see him staring at him. “Potter, are you actually awake this time or are you going to fall asleep on me again.” The raven haired boy’s cheeks flushed which was extremely noticeable on his pale complexion, which made Draco wonder about the raven haired boy’s sexuality.
“I don’t care. You are perfect.” Draco whispered, and he pulled her back in for a kiss. Their lips met, and Harkin slowly melted into the kiss. When Draco pulled away, he smiled, and Harkin kissed him again, before pulling away and smiling.
“I am aware, that brings up my topic of arrival. We need to talk.” Narcissa stepped out of the way to let the pair inside, and he walked inside like he owned the place, dragging Harry with him.
“Not the only ones, Miss Potter.” She stated and Harry gave her a funny look as Draco helped her off the exam table. She walked over to the door and pulled it open, and Draco watched as her face lite up.
They reached the room and Snape found his enchantments torn apart, and Snape conjured his Patronus and sent a message to McGonagall. “Seal the castle immediately and seal the students inside the Great Hall they are in danger.” Snape then walked inside the room with Hermione, Ron and Draco on his tail. They walked in to find the room almost destroyed and little pieces of what looked like silk.
“Your friends were asking me questions about the day I almost killed you.” Draco whispered, and Harry nodded. Harry pulled Draco down with him as he went to lie down, and Draco didn’t fight it. They laid there as Harry drew circles on Draco’s collarbone with his finger.
“Nothing, let’s just get dressed and go downstairs to the dining room for breakfast. Mother and Father are probably already down wondering where we are anyway.” Draco said as he smiled down at her and then he leaned down and kissed her on the forehead, before climbing out of bed and walking over to the closet naked. Harkin smiled as she followed her naked fiancée to their closet and she pulled on a blue dress while Draco pulled on his normal suit with a blue tie to match her dress.
I really want to apologize for not posting regularly. I've been trying to, but it seems life gets in the way. i guess that's what i get for having a polyamorous relationship with my partners. hope you enjoyed. leave comments if you did. i love hearing good things.
Draco cast another warming charm on the blankets to help quicken the process. “Come on, Love. You’re stronger than this, Harry.” That’s when the door burst open again.
“Where were you?” Lucius said as he stalked around his desk to stand in front of the couple, and Harkin stepped forwards and glares at Lucius.
“You can talk to my mother about that because I’m not exactly sure. If you could excuse yourself Harry and I were in the middle of something,” Draco stated.
“I told him I’d give him a blowjob later. Is that pertinent to your research, Professor.” Harry shouted, and Severus and Healer Johnson both flushed. “Exactly.”
“Really? Oh, love. Never mind then. I’ll just finish what I was doing before we get up and head downstairs.” Draco responded as his hands slipped between her legs, and his fingers inside her, and Harry gasped in surprise.
“Father just being rude, but he is unfortunately right. We should get ready for the ball.” Draco stated as he pulled her up into a sitting position and then climbed off the bed to the closet.
“No, she said I wasn’t allowed to talk about it, and I won’t tell. Good night.” Draco said pointedly, and then he walked away and up to his room with Harkin. He walked in to find her curled into his sheets, and he walked over and stripped down to his pants. Then he curled into the bed next to her, and he found she took a shower for her hair was damp and sprawled wildly around her. “You know I can braid your hair if you wish.” Draco smiled, and she lifted her head slightly to look at him.
“I don’t know what to say.” Harkin muttered as she stared at the sheets covering her nearly naked form.
“I don’t know, but Harry is safe, and it is late, so we should head home. Hermione, dear, are you going to be staying with us at the Burrow?” Mrs. Weasley asked.
“Oh, I know. Molly Weasley will get what’s coming to her as well, but for right now, I’m starting with you, Potter. Which in the end will help me with my revenge on Molly Weasley as well.”
Harry picked up the little boy and crawled into bed and slowly falling asleep. The next morning when he woke up, Harry was having his hair pulled on by Teddy. “Hey, little man. What time is it?” Harry looked at the clock on his bedside table, and saw that it was 10 o’clock. Harry climbed out of bed pulling Teddy with him. Harry put Teddy in his crib and walked over to his wardrobe pulling out one of the few outfits that he had left in his wardrobe, after the war Harry went out and bought a brand new wardrobe since he didn’t have that many clothes left after the war.
“The baby was an unexpected complication with her health, because the potion was trying to get rid of the baby, and Harkin’s magic was trying to stabilize it. This was all taken care of a couple of days ago with the help of Melody Johnson and Severus. The second problem was Voldemort. He interrupted the potion mid…discharge, and it resulted in his core being pulled from him and mixing with Draco and Harkin’s cores. Making Voldemort a muggle and Draco and Harkin the most powerful couple of all time.” Narcissa stated. “But no one can know, because if anyone finds out they could be stripped of their magic. Or put under observation for the rest of their lives. I can’t allow it. Not to mention with the baby.”
“I honestly thought they didn’t deflate her.” Severus chuckled, and Harry burst out laughing as they walked into the dining room. Draco and Narcissa both looked up at the sound, and they stared at the weird trio.
“Really, I couldn’t stand to see you with Astoria. I saw you in those silver dress robes and I almost jumped you right there. I left the ball because I didn’t see you or Astoria there anymore and I thought that you two went back to the dorms together. I went back and found you asleep in your bed and you were by yourself. I just assumed that you were tired and decided to go to bed. I told Pansy that I was tired and was going to go to sleep. I couldn’t stand that you were with Astoria freaking Greengrass. How could I when you were so beautiful. What I never could understand was how Granger got escorted by Victor Krum?” Draco and Harry were close to each other, and Draco could feel Harry’s chuckle against his lips, which made Draco chuckle.
“No, but my father beat me to make me the way he wanted me to turn out and look at me now. Doing exactly what he never wanted me to do, despise his ways and the Dark Lord. I want my mother to be free of his grasp and out of danger. And I want to get to know this beautiful woman and actually fall in love with her even if that means she might turn back into a him, eventually.”
“Hey, where have you been? You’ve been gone a couple of hours, been breaking mommy’s rules have you?” Tonks joked. Draco and Harry glanced around the room and found that Tonks and her father were the only two people in the room.
“The three of us. I’m not leaving him. Not again.” Ron stated as he stepped forwards. Hermione and Luna followed.
When she was finally finished, the dishes disappeared, and a note appeared on the table. “For Albus when he comes looking. Come.” Harry stood up, and he wrapped his arm around her waist, and Nagini slithered up and over his shoulders, and they disapparated. The appeared at the front gates to Harry assumed was Malfoy Manor. Mipsy appeared next to them carrying all of Harry’s bags, and she felt sorry for the elf.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t realize there were rules, and who would I know what the rules are. I grew up with muggles in a muggle suburb, where I was treated as if I didn’t exist…” Harry trailed off and stared off into space.
“I don’t want you to go. Not yet. Please.” Harkin begged as she reached one of her hands out to the older man and brushed her fingers along his jaw. “I can’t lose both of you. After all of the good that has happened…” Harkin trailed off.
Draco lifted the wand and cast a spell at Harry, and then he put it back in his pocket. “Okay, try to think something at me.”
“No, I don’t want to be treated different. I hate that. I’m just like everyone else. Promise!” Harry almost yelled, but remembered that people were probably trying to listen.
“They’ll get over it when they find out who Potter’s dating.” Draco said as he pushed two fingers in Harry’s entrance, and Harry, not expecting that amount of pressure, let out a scream. They could hear as Pansy ran for the bathroom door.
“House elves. They have free rain over things. They can go through wards that wizards can’t, they can smuggle things past wards that wizards can’t. People don’t pay attention to house elves because they aren’t supposed to notice them. Plus, they follow orders, either because of threats or niceties that their masters treats them.” Harkin explained.
“Okay.” Draco whispered, and Harry nodded her head. Healer Johnson pulled out her wand, and she started casting diagnostic charms. When she finished she stepped close to them.
Interesting. Comments? I would love to hear your thoughts. A lot was revealed about the Malfoy family, I'd like to know what you think.
In my trunk. Draco stepped back in the room and knelt down next to Harry’s trunk, while Harry riffled through his trunk to find the cloak. Harry pulled out a piece of fabric that kind of looked like a blanket, but Draco pick Harry back up after he closed his trunk and Harry threw the cloak over both of them. Draco like this idea, and he closed the door behind them walking into the common room, out the door, and down the spiral staircase that lead to the room. Draco carried Harry to the hospital wing in silence and wondered if Harry had fallen asleep and when he looked over at Harry he saw his eyes open and staring at him in confusion.
“Dumbledore sent me, he said that Voldemort was moving in to steal the Prophecy, and since I’m the only other person who can get it he sent me to get it. He said something about it being a precaution. I don’t know. So care to help?”
“No, maybe I’m lying to Potter and the Dark Lord. Maybe I’m just waiting for both sides to destroy each other so I can live peacefully, or maybe you are right and I’m playing the headmaster. I guess we won’t find out just yet.” Lucius stated as they came closer, and the doors behind them opened. Harry turned, and her eyes latched onto Sirius’ as he was the first to step through the door. She could see the pain in his eyes as he realized this was her, and not the Dark Lord. Harry’s attention was drawn away as she felt something slid past her leg and she realized it was Nagini heading for Arthur.
Draco just looked him in the eyes and said, “Boyfriends. I think, unless that’s not what you want, because it seems like you rather like kissing me a lot. And I know that I definitely like kissing you, Harry.”
“Snape, what’s going on? Why is he acting like that? For Harry of all people.” Ginny said and she turned towards Severus.
“Har, you look fine. Plus, I have a concealment charm hiding our children from anyone who doesn’t know. Okay?” Draco stated.
“Well, you knew of the task that Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger, and Mr. Potter were tasked to do by Albus before he died.”
“A little yes. First off you must not know Harry very well, because he doesn’t hurt himself to get attention, he does stupid heroic stuff to gets attention and happens to get hurt in the process. And two, Potter’s friends couldn’t and wouldn’t hurt him even if he asked and paid them to do it.” Draco informed her, and she stepped closer towards him.
“I’m not sure. I feel as if I’m missing something important, but can’t put my finger on it.” Draco looked down at the list and started going through and double checking with his knowledge of the dark magic on the weapons, and he noticed a little miscalculation.
“So, he is pulling the black ooze from Harkin into himself to save her and the twins? Has he been doing that this entire time?” Melody asked.
“Harry?” Draco questioned. Draco was trying to get Harry to look at him, but Harry just kept his eyes focused on the floor. Draco was about to try and say something else when Vernon walked into the front room.
“Draco, he will be dealt with, I assure you of that, but right now Harkin needs you, and you can’t go running after revenge and help her. You are what is keeping her as stable as she is. We need you to keep doing that. Do this for her, Draco.” Severus stated as he reached up to make Draco look down at her, see how pale she was, feel the instability of her magic. “She needs you, and the twins need you, Draco.” Severus finished, and Draco practically collapsed next to her bed in soft sobs.
“The next Malfoy heir is not going to be raised by a Weasley, and Harry knows I won’t allow that to happen. I think she will be fine with you raising our baby. The two of you have been growing closer, and she likes you, mum.”
“I don’t know. I’ve never liked him and he’s never liked me as far as I know.” Harry said. “Why am I so open about this? You’ve been trying to kill me for 14 years.”
“Would that alert the Dark Lord of my connection to Harry? I can’t put him at risk I have to try and save him. I can’t lose him. If anything happens to him, Severus; I’m done. I literally can’t lose him.”
“Thank you, Dray.” Harkin whispered back to him, and he leaned over and kissed the top of her head, and the room around them froze. Draco and Harkin looked up to see the enter room staring at them, and Harkin looked from the room to Draco and then the room and back. “What just happened?” Harkin whispered to him.
“We’ll deal with it, dragon.” Narcissa stated as she pulled him into her arms. “We’ll deal with it.” She whispered. Draco leaned into her and her ended up falling asleep for a few hours. Healer Johnson and Severus walked back in, and Narcissa held her fingers up to her lips. “Let him sleep.”
“Aurora, I believe what he is trying to say is that Mr. Malfoy is a vampire. What does Mr. Potter have to do with that, Severus?”
“Nothing.” Sirius said having a hard time keeping the smile off his face. “Just laughing at how much my fawn is like her father.” Sirius smiled, and Remus gave Sirius a knowing look.
“Love, you are not a freak. Your relatives wanted you to think that you were a freak to be little you and make you feel that you are alone. You are not alone, love. You have the people that care about you, and they are your real family, not the ones that are related to you. Those monsters are the real freaks, not you. Everyone that is in this house cares about you, love, and we will protect you until the ends of time. I love you with everything that I am and will ever be. Everything that I own cannot compare to you; you are worth much more than everything that I own and more.” Draco stated as his thumb brushed back and forth across her cheek. Harkin smiled at him, and he smiled back at her before he leaned forwards to kiss her.
“I’m sorry, love. I didn’t mean to look at you any different, I’m just worried about you, with everything you’ve been through in the past couple of weeks. I have the right to worry about you, don’t I?” Draco asked as he rested his forehead against hers, and she melted into the embrace a little.
Harry was stuck with Neville as a potion’s partner this year, because Hermione felt Ron needed a little more guidance, and she felt Harry could handle Neville on his own. Well, Harry wasn’t amazing at potions but Neville was a disaster, Harry could only imagine what could go wrong, but he never imagined this.
“Better than my little sister. Astoria was devastated when father told her the contract wouldn’t be going through. That’s the third one father has tried to negotiate for her, all of them leaving because they fell in love. She wouldn’t even come back to school because of it.”
“Lupin broke my arm, and I think you are feeling the pain.” Draco whispered as he pulled out his wand, and he healed the break. “I’m sorry, love. I didn’t know it would hurt you like that.” Draco apologized. “You aren’t going to get back to sleep are you?”
“Yes, though I don’t know how Slytherin’s are going to act to Harkin so I’d be careful.” Lucius stated.
Harry had always known that he had some sort of feelings for Draco, it’s why he decided to get to know Draco in the first place. Harry had met Ron Weasley on the train and he was alright, but the way that Draco injected himself and carried himself, made Harry want to know him and figure him out, which is why he shook Draco’s hand and said, ‘We’ll see how the sorting pans out.’ Harry looked at Ron after that and he had a small look of betrayal on his face. Harry didn’t want to just walk away from his first real friend but he figured he would have an open mind about this school and all the people in it. If he was sorted into Slytherin, and Ron totally abandons him then Ron wasn’t supposed to be his friend, because the way that Ron made it sound was Draco Malfoy was going to be in Slytherin, no matter what, and Ron was going to be in Gryffindor no matter what, so if Harry was sorted into Gryffindor and Draco didn’t want to be his friend then Harry would know that Draco wasn’t supposed to be his friend either.
“No, I was completely a virgin before that day you took me into that empty classroom.” Harry muttered. “But I have fingered myself.” Harry finished.
“Well, we’ll get that checked out as well.” Narcissa said as she turned away. “I will make an appointment. Don’t forget your protection spells.” She said as she disappeared around the corner. Draco slipped back into his room to find half-lidded emeralds staring at him.
“Ready to go?” Severus asked, and Harkin nodded in response. “Okay, did you want to stop at the hospital wing to get some bruise-healing paste?”
“She’s alright and so is the baby. Melody will take you back to see her. Go on, dragon.” Narcissa said as she lifted her hand to brush some of his hair back that fell in his face.
“I almost did.” Draco whispered as he looked away from Lupin, trying to find something else to focus on.
“Don’t think like that, love. You don’t pick abusive people. People just don’t know how to react to who you are. Your aunt and uncle hated magic which is why they treated you the way they did. Ronald hates your popularity and your fame, and sadly his way of dealing with that is through aggression.” Draco stated.
Draco found Harry on her hands and knees vomiting. “Harry!” Draco shouted as he wrapped his arms around her waist, and her vomiting stopped. “Are you alright, love?” Draco asked as she leaned into his side.
“Well, all of these thing come into consideration with her condition. Severus informed me she was a horcrux for He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, which is why he created this potion. As well as she is three weeks pregnant, which surprises me considering the snake bite and the accident.”
“What’s going on?” Harry asked as Hermione shut the door behind hover and turned to Harry. “Something happen while I was out?”
“I will, now go. We’ll be fine.” Harry gave her Teddy, and then he gave her a hug and kissed Teddy on top of the head.
The train pulled away from the station as the cabin door opened, emitting Hermione, Ron, and Ginny. Hermione sat down next to Harry, Ron sat down across from Harry, and Ginny sat down next to Ron and across from Hermione. She looked as if Hermione was getting on her nerves and she wanted to say something to Hermione. Ron was staring at Harry as if he was confused by something and wanted to express that but just didn’t know how. Finally, Harry gave Ron some pity.
“Well, that’s not exactly true. I have kissed people before just not like this, and it’s not like I never wanked. Though it would be different now since I don’t have a penis.” Harry said bluntly, and Draco chuckled.
“I love it. It captures my Father’s name very femininely. Harkin Jamelynn Potter. I like it.” Harry said as she sat down in Draco’s lap.
“Draco, I don’t think anything is going to happen to me inside the wards of the Manor, three stories up in the middle of the floor in your bedroom cradled against your chest. That would be an extremely special trick.” Harry whispered into Draco’s neck with a laugh, and Draco chuckled a little.
“In trouble. Voldemort is currently dead, but if we don’t find and destroy the last item that we are looking for Voldemort can find Harry and possess him and live for another sixty to seventy years or however long he could live while riding Harry as a prisoner in his own mind. We know the item is here in the castle, we just don’t know where. So we are staying here until we find it.”
“Love, I’m sorry; I bit your neck.” Draco whispered as his fingers brushed over the skin that was now bleeding, and the blood sped and then started knitting back together. “Whoa, did you just see that?” Draco whispered.
“I could get used to waking up like this.” Draco murmured as he pulled Harry closer and Madam Pomfrey walked into the room.
“Sirius!” Harry shouted as she was about to run towards him, but then realized that Sirius hadn’t seen her as a girl yet. She froze as she watched Sirius slowly turn around and take in her appearance. It was only a few moments before Sirius opened his arms to Harry, and she ran into his arms.
“Thank you, Dobby.” Harkin smiled at him and then she reached into her pocket and pulled out a galleon. “And this is for you, for doing this for me.” Harkin finished as she placed the coin in his small palm and closed it around it. “Thank you.” She whispered as Dobby hugged her before disappearing with a pop.
“Alright, you will probably get a letter from the Ministry, but since they don’t know where you are it will probably come here.”
“Oh, little Potter doesn’t know the story, but I do. See after he graduated from Hogwarts, Cissy still had another year, so Luci took her to his family home in France, telling my parents that his parents will be there, but they weren’t. He ended up knocking my sister up, and he sent her back off to school. Well, Cissy got sick a few weeks into school, and she found out she was pregnant. She ended up aborting the baby not wanting the shame, and she didn’t tell Luci right away. I’m surprised they got back together after that fight.” Bellatrix explained, and Harkin stared off into the distance. “Lucky for me I came prepared with a portkey.” Bellatrix said, and Harkin’s eyes widened in fear.
“Ginny, you shouldn’t take advantage. He might remember what happened, and still come to the same conclusion. I won’t say any more than that, but you shouldn’t be doing this. You’re one of my closest friends but Ginny, this is wrong, and you know it.”
“Potter! Shut the bloody door. Either get your bloody ass in the bloody house or get your ass out of my house. But I would rather have you get your friends out of my house and get your bloody ass in the kitchen and make diner,” Vernon yelled.
Draco looked to his mother and pulled her in for a hug. “It’s alright, mum. I know, Father, can be, well, Father. You don’t have to apologize for that.” Draco let go of Narcissa, and stepped back to Harry’s side. That’s when Lucius walked into the room, and Draco unintentionally stepped in front of Harry protectively.
Hermione came back a few minutes later with a Healer, and he started casting spells over Harry. “Alright Mr. Potter, I’m going to ask you some question and try to answer them to the best of your ability.” He started asking Harry questions and he tried to answer them but he didn’t remember much of what happened. Andromeda came in shortly after the healer had finished his questions, and Teddy was bouncing in her arms.
“How do you know I was in London? I didn’t tell you where I was going, and you shouldn’t know where I went anyway the place is under a Fidelius Charm.” Harry stated confused.
“No, the Dursley’s treated me like you treat your house elves. Well not anymore, but before like Dobby.” Harkin stated. “Only probably worse because I didn’t actually do as I was told most of the time. At least at first, and then I realized that in order to survive I needed to adapt to my surroundings. I got beat less and locked in my cupboard less. Until I started using accidental magic, and then it got worse again.” Harkin continued. “I learned that the only way that I would survive was to make sure I knew how to take care of myself. Make sure I didn’t die in that house.” Harkin finished.
“That’s good to hear, Mr. Malfoy. May I ask when you would want your mother out of your father’s grasp?”
“Are you coming in?” Harry stuttered before snapping her jaw shut and stepping into the water and snuggling into Draco’s lap and moaning as the hot water washed over her skin. “Enjoying yourself?” Draco whispered into her ear.
“I don’t know. Betrayed is the only word that I can think of. The bloody Ministry couldn’t wait until after bloody Christmas before having him turn himself in. I mean it is Christmas.” Harkin whispered.
“No, see I actually found out this past summer and how do you talk to someone about that, plus it’s not exactly okay in the muggle world, and most definitely not in my house. So I really didn’t know much before I… before the incident.” Harry muttered.
“And you, young man, just because you are the head of the family now, doesn’t mean you can start acting like your father. She is precious as are the two children of yours she is carrying. So please treat her better and with care. You two are bound together more tightly together than anyone in our world; it is also permanent, Draco, so don’t mess this up for both of you. I love you.”
“Yes, but everyone is always better at controlling their magic when we have a wand. No matter how good I am at wandless magic I would want a wand to be the best, plus we don’t know if he would possess the same skills while in Harry’s body. Since Gryffindor tower is the closest I would suspect that would be his first stop.”
“Dray, you know it’s quite difficult to get ones hair wet, if you are blocking the water. I have a lot of hair to get wet.” Harry stated as she turned around to face him.
sorry about not updating in so long had writers block some of you probably know how that goes, but got a couple of chapters lined up so hopefully i can get this finished soon.
“For Harry. I stayed for her. She needed a friend more than you. And honestly, you decided to go home instead of supporting a friend. You didn’t even visit her like a real friend would. The Twins visited your best friend. What does that say about you, Ronald?” Hermione shouted before grabbing Harkin’s hand and pulling her towards the carriages, while everyone else stared dumbfounded after Harkin and Hermione.
“What, Harry didn’t even know that Voldemort has Horcruxes, or even what they are. How would she destroy one?”
“I’ve been better. I really hate Dark magic, and the fact that it is almost impossible to treat when you get it in your system.”
“I love you too, mum, and I will.” Draco said as he bowed his head. Narcissa then walked over to Draco and Harkin and gave them hugs before giving everyone else a hug, and then she left the compartment.
“Come along, Potter.” Malfoy said as he took her hand and entwined their fingers. It was a weird sensation, but she oddly like it and didn’t pull away. She let Malfoy pull her into a room next to the library that she didn’t even notice before, and once the door was closed the lights automatically turned on. The room had a greenish glow to it and reminded Harry of the Slytherin common room. “You’ve been in the Slytherin common room, Potter?” Malfoy said, and Harry looked up at his voice, she hadn’t realized she said that out loud.
Our sources say that a letter was sent to the Wizengamot as a recommendation letter. Our source couldn’t find who wrote the letter, because it’s under pretty tight lock and key, but the secret writer must be pretty high up on the totem pole for their word to actually matter to the Wizengamot.
“I’m so sorry, Arthur I tried to stop it, but Nagini was too quick for me. I would never…I would never…” Harry sobbed into his shoulder and he just held her close.
“No problem, darling. Mothers have a tendency to know things before their children do, and I feel like you are already my daughter, Harkin.”
“Sorry, love. I just wanted to check on you after the incident in the Great Hall.” He whispered in her ear, and then he kissed just underneath her ear. Harry pulled away and looked at him.
“Very kind of you, Mr. Malfoy. She will definitely appreciate that. Does she have potions with you?”
“Voldemort’s horcruxes, Granger. You do have the sword, correct?” Draco stated, and everyone turn toward Granger and Weasley.
“Harry!” Draco screamed. “Mum!” Draco yelled and Narcissa started lowering Harry onto the floor. “What’s happening?”
Draco was frozen, he didn’t know what to do. Was Harry just acting as he would to any of his friends, analyzing them until he understood? Draco decided he would ask Granger later, right now he had to take care of Harry. Draco pulled the covers over Harry and moved him into a more comfortable position on the bed, and then he closed the curtains and walked out of the room.
“I think you’re missing my intentions, Draco.” Harry leaned forwards and kissed Draco on the lips pushing at Draco’s lips a little to try and get him to react. After a little prodding, Draco started kissing Harry back. Eventually, they pulled away from each other to breathe.
“Yes, they wouldn’t even second guess themselves. These people, the most devoted ones are just as mad as Voldemort himself. It’s why Lucius was willing to kill you and his own son.”
“Professor Snape has a point, Mr. Weasley. Unless you have proof that Draco took Harry’s things, I am going to have to give you a detention.” McGonagall said.
“Ginny?” Harry started but Ginny ran up and wrapped her arms around him, pulling him into a tight embrace. Harry hugged her back, but the hug was different than the ones that he remembered. He pulled her back a little so he could look her in the eyes and see what the matter was, but as soon as her face was in front of his she leaned forwards and kissed him. He had to pull away from the kiss so he could breathe. “Gin, what’s wrong?”
“I know you, Draco, and your father wrote me a letter as well, so I could get you out of trouble if you were caught. How’d it go?”
“Yes, as long as they don’t do anything that they shouldn’t, they should be able to share a room. I am being completely serious, Andy.” Narcissa looked at her sister, and she looked completely serious. Andromeda looked shocked at first, and then she reached her hand out to Draco, taking his hand.
“We were talking and then all of a sudden he curled into a ball and covered his ears like he was trying to block some voice out, but after that the room went silent, because we were concerned. Then he started screaming, not a simple ah, but a blood curdling scream like someone was killing him slowly and painfully or had just found his parents murdered in front of his eyes.”
“My dear, why wouldn’t he? You are a beautiful, strong, capable woman. The Malfoy men are suckers for woman of that exact description.”
“I know my little dragon, and he isn’t so much different from his father when it comes to his women.”
“Hermione, that maybe how it is in the muggle world, but in the wizarding world, we’re still a little old school with our laws. For Draco to be able to claim the children as his heir Draco and Harkin have to be married before they are born. It would be different if he were making a will and didn’t have an heir. Say Sirius died, he could leave everything to Harkin because she’s his goddaughter, though he would probably have to change it now that Harry changed her name legally.” Remus explained.
“Where you the one that blew open the front door?” Harry asked as he glared at the front door of his uncle’s house. Draco turned around and looked at the door.
Draco watched her walk away, and he slowly stood up and walked from the room and back to the drawing room to find his mother curled up in his father’s lap and Remus lounging across Sirius’ lap. “What did I miss?” Draco questioned.
“Not much. I understand that there are certain ceremonies that are considered bonding magic like a wedding ceremony, but that is about it.” Sirius stated.
“Nothing has changed in my plan. I still see her and the twins she is carrying as my family. You will get married over Easter break like we planned, and she will be living here legally. Along with Theo if that is alright with both of you?” Narcissa stated.
“Just like last time follow me, and don’t pay attention to anyone else. I won’t let you fall.” Draco whispered in her ear, and she sighed into his chest before nodding. Draco nodded to his mother and father, and Lucius turned towards the band just like Draco had the last time, and they were off. The four Malfoy’s twirled around the dance floor, and eventually when people were allowed to join in couples slowly started migrating onto the dance floor, and Harkin caught sight of Remus off to the back of the room by himself, and she frowned. “What’s the matter, love?” Draco asked without a missed beat, and Harkin looked up at him.
“Yeah, me, too.” Harry whispered, and the couple sat down at the table. Plates appeared in front of them, and they started eating.
About halfway through the game, Lucius walked into the dining room. “Ah, I see they have started a new game.” Lucius said as he lifted Narcissa out of her chair and sat down, pulling Narcissa into his lap afterwards. “Who is winning?”
“Harry, I will never do that to you. Okay. You deserve to have a friend, Harry, and I’m hoping it will always be me.” Draco pulled Harry out of the house, grabbing Harry’s trunk and Hedwig before exiting the house.
“That is true, now try and get some more sleep.” Harry moaned before nodding and curling back up in the covers, and she slowly drifted off to sleep.
“Lucius, I don’t know, but he’s just doing it for Draco. You can’t hold him accountable, his son is important to him, and I’m important to his son, so you can see his concern, but now everything should be fine, because you won’t hurt me, right?” Harry asked.
“Love, I’m sorry. I forgot about the bond for a moment.” Draco said as he walked over to Harkin, and he wrapped his arms around her pulling her into a tight embrace. He then pulled them down into a lying position on the bed. They laid on the bed entangled like that until 10:30, when Narcissa knocked on the door to tell them to get ready, so they uncurled themselves from each other and walked over to their wardrobe to get dressed. Harkin picked one of her baby doll style dresses to cover her small baby bump, while Draco went with his normal black slacks, dress shirt, and tie. Draco shrunk their trunks and slipped them in his pocket before taking Harkin’s hand, and they walked downstairs to meet Narcissa, Severus, Hermione, and Theo in the foyer.
“Really, that sounds like fun actually. So after Arthur, you’ll go to Bill, right. How are you going to find him? His house is under a Fidelius charm. Then you’d go to Charlie, right? Who is in Romania, by the way? No one knows exactly where in Romania, but he’s there. Then there’s Percy. Probably the easiest since he works at the Ministry. Then after Percy there is George, who after the loss of Fred, kind of went all paranoid, and no one can get close to him without someone close to him, but after three more of his siblings die plus his father, I’m thinking you won’t even be able to find him. Then if you somehow manage to kill George, you come to Ron and Ginny. They’re going back to Hogwarts this year, so they’ll be under the best protection that the wizarding world has, being inside the school grounds for the next nine months. That sounds like a lot of work, now that I say that out loud. Are you sure you’re up for that?” Harry asked, and then Rodolphus drew the knife back and threw it at Harry, and it lodged in his shoulder. Harry felt as the knife drained him. “Is this coated in Dark magic?” Harry asked.
“Before Draco killed the Dark Lord, the Dark Lord punished his parents for their incompetence and their punishment was the fact that the Malfoy line ended with Draco.” Severus paused.
Draco relaxed against the bed and Narcissa sat down on the side of the bed next to him and looked him in the eyes. “She will be fine as long as you get better as well. Severus said that there might be a side effect that might affect you magic and health, if either of you are injured or sick.”
“Father, I can explain. I was going to tell you; I just didn’t know how to tell you. I-I’m sorry, Father, but until I figured out everything I didn’t want to tell you anything. I love Harry and we want to be together, and there is nothing you can do about it. Only Harry and I can dictate what happens in our relationship, and you are just going to have to deal with it,” Draco released and as he went on Lucius’ eyes got wider and wider. Lucius was staring at Draco like he either didn’t know what Draco was talking about or was extremely confused by it.
“Yes, now hurry and look for Harry, if she is in danger, we need to get to her quick. We don’t know who’s got her, why they’ve got her, and what they are doing to her right now?” Ron said as he started searching the map for Harry’s name, and when they found it, they had no idea how they were going to get to her, they watched as someone they didn’t expect walked her off of Hogwarts grounds and disappeared.
“Yes, she doesn’t interact with anyone. She also doesn’t like being called the Grey Lady; she would rather go by her real name.”
“Don’t be. I also want to remind you that together we are the most powerful couple in the wizarding world, but even individually we are just as powerful. As long as you are conscious your father would never be able to touch me or the twin. Do you understand?” Harkin stated, and she stared him straight in the eyes until the realization dawned on him.
“Excuse me.” Harkin said before she ran out of the room covering her mouth, and she hurried to the nearest bathroom. She barely made it inside the room before she threw the toilet seat up before, she threw up the food that she just ate, and when she was done, she felt Draco’s fingers brush her hair back and then his arms wrapped around her waist.
“Was. Now don’t interrupt she’s getting to the good part, that I can guarantee you won’t like.” Harkin stated.
“No, you are going to talk to me. What was your dream about?” Harkin questioned as she made herself a little more unmovable, but not so much so that Draco couldn’t move her if he actually tried.
“Not standing up for you when Mother kicked you out of the house. I should have stood up for you when you started dating Ted. Mother had no right to do what she did and I thought this then but I didn’t have the guts to tell mother of this because I was used to the way I was living. Now though I can’t have my son and Harry in danger with my husband going insane and going back to that man after what went on 15 years ago.”
“That’s a tricky question, Professor. My mother may know, but I did not tell her. She is where I get most of my intuitive nature from. She can figure out the smallest things from the smallest actions or speech.”
“How are you going to get through a school day, love, if you can’t go half an hour without me touching you?”
Neville nodded, and Harry released him, and they continued on to the hospital wing. They stepped inside, and Madam Pomfrey hurried from her office. “What is it, Neville? What potion did you spill upon yourself this time?” she said, and then she noticed Harry for the first time. “And who is your friend, dear?” Harry just put his face in his hands and shook his head.
Harry pulled her arm out of Malfoy’s grasp, and he turned back towards Harry. “Whatever you are offering I’m not interested.” Harry started walking up the stairs, but Malfoy followed her. “Why are you still following me, Malfoy? I’m pretty sure the Slytherin common room is still in the dungeons.” Harry said without even looking back.
“Its fine, cub, and to answer your question. Sirius is the same way. Not with the blaming so much, but he can be this romantic sweetheart one moment and the next he’s an arse as you said. Sometimes you just have to take the small moments and try your best to help them understand what to say and act at certain times.” Remus stated, and Harkin looked up at him. “And sometimes men can just be oblivious. They just don’t realize how insensitive they can be.” Remus finished.
“Harry, dear, if you are finished, would you mind coming with me.” Narcissa asked a few minutes later as she stood and held her hand out to Harry. Draco squeezed her thigh before he pulled away, and Harry pushed her chair away from the table and took Narcissa’s hand. Narcissa gave her hand a light squeeze as she pulled her from the dining room.
“How did this happen? How did he get in?” Tonks shouted towards the boys, but they weren’t sure if the questions were actually directed at them or not. “Do you two know the answers or not?”
“Potter, you don’t have the guts to kill me. You didn’t even have the anger in you to use the Cruciatus Curse on Bellatrix. How are you going to kill me, Harry?”
“What? No, I’m not.” Harry shook his head and walked out of the room with Ron and Hermione behind him. Harry shut the door and turned towards the rest of the common room, and everyone was staring at him. “Bloody hell! Stop staring at me, it just me. I’m the same bloody person i was this morning.” Harry stated and walked out of through the portrait hole. She headed down to the Great Hall, because dinner should be starting soon.
“Draco…I don’t think that…that we should be doing this.” Harkin panted as Draco’s lips kissed, sucked, and nipped at the skin underneath her ear, and her back arched as she moaned.
“I’ve always had a thing for you, Harry. I’ve just never done anything about it, because I have an obligation to my family to produce heirs to our family. I’m bisexual, Harry, but it’s not alright when I have to produce heirs.”
“Really, he’s done nothing so far. The Weasley’s have done more and they don’t know about the beatings.” Harry stated.
Harry woke up the next morning to find Draco wrapped around her and Ron and Hermione standing at the end of the bed. Harry buried her face in Draco’s chest and tried to go back to sleep, but she felt Draco’s finger tips against her cheek, and she turned her face up towards Draco. His eyes were open and on her; he just smirked and she knew what he meant.
“Yes, sir.” Draco stated, and he picked up his bag and Harkin’s as well, and the couple hurried out of the classroom. Draco kept the concealment charm up until they reached the Great Hall, and Harkin took his hand.
“Dray, it’s beautiful.” She whispered, and Draco took the ring and slipped it on her ring finger. “I love it.” She leaned forwards and captured his lips, and that was when Sirius and Remus walked into the dining room holding hands.
“I did, but I know that will only last me a few years. I’m going to get older and not be able to do the same things I was able to when I’m younger and I won’t be able to play anymore, so what would I do then, because I would have to do something. I couldn’t just sit around home and be a stay at home mum. I would have to be doing things all the time.” Harkin said, “But I would also want to be in my kids’ lives and do things with them too, so nothing that would take me away from that.” Harkin finished.
“Yes, I admit that my relatives are horrible, but not all muggles are like my relatives, some are actually alright.”
The rest of the meal went by rather quietly as everyone just talked small talk. Harkin stayed quiet for most of the rest of the meal, and when everyone was finished with dessert, Lucius escorted everyone to one of the many drawing rooms for drinks. They were all laughing by the end of the night, and Harkin was watching as her worlds merged together. She stood up and ran from the room, and everyone stopped and looked up at her after she ran.
“Draco, what’s going on between you two, is all we want to know. You’ve been acting strange the last couple of days and it’s starting to freak us out a little. We care, but you’ve been giving us the turn around since we got back to school, and we’re concerned, that’s all.” Blaise said and then elbowed Pansy as she went to say something else that would probably ruin what Blaise had just fixed.
“Listen, listen.” He said. “I understand there has been a lot of commotion this meal, but it is time for bed, so pip pip.” Dumbledore stated, and everyone stood to leave and headed to their respective common rooms.
“I love you too, my dragon.” Harkin whispered as she turned in his arms to kiss him. Draco's hands moved up to the side of her face, which caused her to wince in pain from the bruise that was now a lot bigger than before.
Harry ran his hand up to Draco’s cheek and rested his hand there. “Draco, you may want to protect me, try not to. See what happened to all the other people that tried to protect me. My parents are dead; Sirus is pretty much dead; Dumbledore is old and who knows how long he has before he croaks; I don’t want to lose you Draco, so please, for me, stop trying to protect me. I could care less about everyone else, but I want you to stay in my life, Draco; I don’t need anyone else if I have you,” Harry stated as his thumb slowly rubbed back and forth against Draco’s cheek.
“Yes, Draco.” Harry’s fingers laced into the hair at the back of Draco’s neck twirling his fingers around it.
“Come for me, Dray.” Harry whimpered, and she dug her fingers into his skin. Draco came inside her, and he bit into her shoulder. After they came back down, their grips loosened, and they looked each other in the eyes.
“Glad you could show up. Hurry inside.” He ordered, and the couple did as they were told and quickly sat down in their seats. The class went by without a hitch, they just made a simple potion that day, Invigoration Draught, and Draco did most of the work for both of them, but Severus never said anything because he knew that Harkin couldn’t technically brew potions right now, but she had to take the class. Surprisingly, there weren’t many people who really noticed that Draco was practically brewing Harkin’s potion, most were just trying to make sure that they didn’t mess up their own potions. Draco turned in two perfect potions 30 minutes before class ended, and Severus could see the strain in Draco’s eyes. He was pushing himself, and Severus was going to find out why. “Mr. Malfoy, stay after class I would like to speak to you about your career appointment.” Severus stated, and Draco gave him a curt nod before turning and walking away.
“Yes, Malfoy.” Harry said, and the sass just dribbled out of her mouth. Malfoy just stared at Harry with something that Harry couldn’t detect because she has never seen it in Malfoy's eyes before. “I’m waiting, Malfoy.”
Hermione kept her company quite often for she was staying at the Manor for the rest of break as was Theo, who took the news two different ways. First he was upset because it was his fault Harkin was in his father’s custody, but after he was reassured that it wasn’t his fault, he was excited to have a younger sibling, and that Harkin and Draco decided to make him the godfather for the twins. He also decided that he would help them take care of the twins during the school year as much as possible; he wanted to try to make up for his mistake, though Harkin and Draco both stated they didn’t blame him.
“Potter…” Draco tried, but his voice wouldn’t work as Harry pulled the finger out, slowly pushing it in and out of Draco’s entrance. Harry watched Draco’s expression waiting for it to relax so he could push the second finger in, and as Draco’s expression relaxed, Harry pushed his single finger in a few more times before slowly pushing the second finger in, causing Draco’s expression to tighten again.
“Well, it worked. I don’t need it; I got a new one in June. Mother took me for my birthday. I do appreciate the thought though, Potter. You could keep this to be honest, it doesn’t work very well for me anymore.”
Harry snuggled into his side and buried her face in his shoulder, and Harry was startled as she felt arms wrap around her and Draco. She turned to find Mrs. Weasley wrapped around them. “I think you and Draco make a lovely couple Harry. I think you balance each other out, in both appearance and personality.” She said as she stepped away from each other, and Harry stared at her. She wasn’t expected them to except Draco like that, especially not Molly.
“Yeah, I think we do. Do you want to go look?” Draco asked as he stood up with Harry still wrapped around his waist. Harry giggled as Draco carried her to the door, and she stopped him before he opened the door.
“Draco, is this a good idea? With your parents right out there.” Harry asked, and Draco kissed her before answering.
“Yes. There are Twenty-eight pureblood families left most women represent both the Malfoy family and the Black family. So there are more like 15 women. I would like for you to start accompanying me to these tea parties, as you would call it. The next one isn’t until after the Holidays and after you go back to school with Draco. I will talk to the Headmaster about you getting out of school for that day. Here we are.” Narcissa stated as they stepped up to a brick wall.
“The Yule Ball in our fourth year. You took Pansy, and I took Astoria; I couldn’t take my eyes off of you most of the night, and I couldn’t help but get distracted while I danced with Astoria. I think she might have known, and she kind of let me off the hook. I went back to the dorm and went to bed around 10 pm, because I just couldn’t stand being at the dance watching you in your dress robes with Pansy anymore.”
Harry’s one hand moved from the wall and reached for the hand that was wrapped around his hip, slowly pushing it downwards. “Touch me, Dray. Please, I need you to…” Harry sighed as Draco’s fingers wrapped around Harry’s waiting cock. Harry turned his head and met Draco’s lips, and they kissed until Draco pulled away slightly.
“Potter, we are here to examine the bond you have with Draco.as the creator of the potion I need to understand the effects of the potion and Melody needs to understand how to treat you now and in the future.”
“It’s called magic.” Harkin said as she took Draco’s hand and where their fingers touched it started to glow as she used their bond to create the light.
“Yes, and Lucius no doubt had a hand in those rumors along with Abraxas, Lucius’ father. They like people thinking things about them that aren’t true. I just brush all the rumors off like no one said anything. You should too, my dear. Most of the things people tell and say about the Malfoy’s are false. This family has been around since the beginning of Magic. They learned to adapt to the rumors that spread.” Narcissa said as she took Harry’s hand and pulled her farther into the floral.
“He didn’t need that, it would only just make him angrier, and then he would never actually get over whatever it is that he is angry about. He needed to see that I am still his friend if that is what he wants. Though it is going to be different this time, he can’t get away with his old shit this time.” Harkin stated as she glared at Ron, before turning her attention back to Ginny. “But I am fine, at least I will be when I get this bruise to go away.” Harkin smiled as Madam Pomfrey reentered the room with the paste in hand, and she handed it to Harkin without a beat. Harkin smiled at her and whispered, “Thank you.”
“I didn’t.” Harry said as he pulled his hands from his ears and rested one against Draco’s cheek. “Draco did.” Harry said and everyone looked towards Draco and he was gapping at Harry.
“Why wouldn’t anyone accept you, love?” Draco asked as he stroked his fingers against her cheek, whipping away the tears.
“Usually, but we kind of took a quick bath last night.” Draco explained, and Harkin came out of the bathroom in her school uniform as well.
“I agree with Siri, cub.” Remus said as he walked around the table to Harkin as well. “You are not a freak, cub. You were a wizard, and now with your circumstances, a witch. Part of the magical community, and yes, your circumstances are unique, but that does not mean you are a freak. This is coming from a werewolf, cub. Siri and I will be there for you. You are our family, cub.” Remus stated, and Harkin had tears streaming down her face and smiled at the two older men. She slipped out of their reach to pull her arms up and wrap them around, pulling them closer together.
“Draco, you just commented on your pregnant girlfriend’s weight. I don’t think so.” Blaise stated from across from them.
“I would be powerful enough to protect you, even when we aren’t close enough to touch.” Draco stated, and Harkin smiled as there was a knock on the bedroom door. “Come in.” Draco stated as he stood up with Harkin in his arms as he spun her around making her laugh as she held on as tight as she could. Severus opened the door to find Draco shirtless spinning Harkin around, and he smiled a little bit. Severus doesn’t remember a time when Draco has so freely had fun, let alone laugh like that, and that prospect alone made Severus happy. “Morning, Uncle Sev.” Draco laughed.
“Bloody hell!” Draco screamed, and he closed the distance between their lips. He lifted her up, giving him better access to her lips and neck, and her fingernails dug into his shoulders. “We really should get ready and head downstairs. You have a healer appointment.” Draco whispered against her lips as his thumb brushed back and forth across her stomach.
Draco waited for Madam Pomfrey to come out with the new list of spells, and when she did she explained what she had figured out. The list looked perfect to Draco, but he could see the hesitation in Madam Pomfrey’s eyes. “Madam Pomfrey, what’s the matter?”
“I wasn’t sure if the schedule had changed due to complications with the meal preparation.” Draco stated.
Once the potions were complete he put each into a vile, labeled them, and walked upstairs, and he kept remembering the words Severus said the day before, and he made sure he followed everything Severus wrote down on the parchment he gave him. Draco just hoped that this would work, whatever it was that Severus was planning. Draco was just glad that they had all the ingredients that were needed to brew both potions. Draco stepped into the room that was housing Harry, and he stepped up to the bed for a second time that day, the only difference his mother was by Harry’s side instead of his father.
“Alright, now that we are all here. Draco and Harkin are going to apparate with Severus, and Hermione and Theo are going to apparate with me. When we get there, the four of you are going to find a compartment and stay there. I don’t want any possibilities of any type of incident to happen. I have also used some of my power in the Ministry to get Umbridge removed and someone more capable put into the position.” Narcissa said with a smirk in Severus’ direction, and Harkin smiled at the prospect of Severus finally getting the job he wanted.
“Thanks, Blaise. Good job getting him all riled up, his emotions and everything aren’t already haywire with the effects of the dark magic, and I already knew about the whole Ginny thing, too. I was just waiting for him to tell me himself. Blaise, you’re my best friend and I care about you, but sometimes you observe way too much, and it doesn’t always need to be said out loud. Now I’m going to try and get him out of the bathroom before he freezes to death in the cold bathroom, and you better be gone before I come back.”
“I don’t know if I could go down there and face them after storming out like that. I feel so stupid about what happened. I mean I stormed out because everything was going so well with Remus, Sirius, and your parents, and I don’t know how to confront them after that.” Harkin whispered.
“Go get some sleep. Tomorrow is the last day of classes.” Severus said, and Draco practically ran from the room down to the dorms and into his bed. Draco took a small nap before heading to lunch and then his afternoon classes. The last day and a half of term flew by quickly, and soon Draco was on the train to King’s Cross station. Draco stepped off the train with his trunk and Harry’s trunk shrunk in his pockets and Harry’s invisibility cloak wrapped around him. No one say the heir to the Malfoy fortune walk through the train station and through the barrier to the muggle world. His mother was waiting for him on the other side, and he took her hand, and they disapparated on the spot.
“I didn’t kill him if that’s what you are implying, Parkinson. He’s safe locked in his Manor. You can owl his mother, she will tell you exactly that.” Hermione pushed passed Pansy, and she to the Gryffindor table. She started loading up her plate and she started eating her food. Hermione looked up and saw that everyone was staring at her. “What?”
“I was planning on handing it over to Mr. Kingsley Shacklebolt with a list of all known Death Eaters and the positions that they are holding. So they can arrest them and send them off to Azkaban in due time before they all realize that the Dark Lord is no longer alive and not coming back this time.”
“Lucius, honey, you don’t have to be so formal. The Dark Lord is gone, and we just have family here, since Harry is family now even though her and Draco aren’t married yet.” Narcissa stated.
“Harry?” Draco’s voice pulled Harry out of his thoughts, and he glanced up at Draco with sadness in his eyes expecting Draco to tell him that he didn’t want to be friends with him anymore. “Harry, what’s the matter?” Draco’s hand went up to caress Harry’s cheek, and he forced Harry to look him in the eyes. “Harry? Listen to me, please.”
“Potter! Malfoy! Here, now!” Snape ordered as the two boys dismounted and walked over to the professor with curious eyes.
“You were the one doing most of the work, Draco.” Harry mumbled, and Draco could see that he was starting to drift off, and his eyes finally drooped closed. Draco cleaned them up and then pulled them under the covers. Draco fell into the rhythm of rubbing his finger up and down Harry’s jawline, and he didn’t even stir or wake. Eventually, Draco slowly drifted off to sleep.
As they reached the front doors Narcissa came out, and started saying, “Lucius who was at the gate, and…” she stilled as she saw Harry and Voldemort standing there. “My Lord.” Narcissa curtsied. “We were not expecting you.”
“Harry, don’t try to talk, the Healers said that you might be a little sore for a couple of months. The Dark magic that was in the knives that were very dangerous and could cause some damage if not treated exactly as specified.” Hermione said. “I’m glad you’re awake though, I was getting worried.”
“You can walk and talk yes?” Draco asked and Harry nodded with an eye roll. “Then we shall talk as we go.” Draco took her hand and wrapped it into the crook of his elbow and took both of their bags and swung them over his other shoulder. Draco walked her out of the room, and Harry started fidgeting with the seam in Draco’s shirt. “Harry, just ask.”
“Well, it takes a lot out of a person when you conduct certain types of spells on them. Removing certain spells is the same. Harry was pretty much being drained by the spell when it’s activated and someone is trying to locate them take the spell away and this happens. So it is possible that there are more people coming to either find Lucius because they know he was tracking Harry, or they are now assigned the mission of tracking Harry down. Either way Harry is in danger, because they are tracking him. My friends should be here soon but I can’t tell you if they will be here before or after your father’s friends. Mom, do you still have that magically protected safe room?”
“Dray, you have to let me know if this hurts, or otherwise I can’t fix it.” Harry said as he brought his free hand up to Draco’s face making him look at him. “Are you alright?”
“She has had 9 broken arms, 6 bruised ribs, 3 broken ribs, 2 broken legs, several concussions and stitches, not to mention the starvation and the confinement to the cupboard under the Dursley’s stairs. She should have been taken out of that environment as soon as you knew that it was happening, Albus. I’m ashamed that you didn’t. If I would have known I would have done it myself.”
Once out of the Great Hall, he made a beeline for the closest bathroom, and he closed himself in the stall and vomited into the toilet. He felt like he had just emptied his stomach of the food that he had just put in his stomach. After a while he was just reaching for he had long emptied his stomach. He heard someone knock on the stale door, and he turned to open the door and found it open.
“Of course. It is something that you love, and you would be able to do it well, and you might be able to get onto the Holy Head Harpies’ team.” Draco smirked. “But it is getting late and we should be heading to bed.” Draco stated.
“It’s alright, Narcissa. Draco is just being overprotective of me, I will be fine. I can take care of myself, but Draco insists that he protect me from certain things,” Harry said as he gave Draco a look, and Draco caught the scold that Harry was giving him out of the corner of his eye.
“I’m sorry, Harry. I didn’t mean to treat you the way that I did after the battle at Hogwarts. I was just trying to cope with Fred’s death, and so caught up in what was going on immediately with me to not even give you a second look. I’m sorry for that.”
“Of course, dear.” Madam Pomfrey stated, and then turned back to Ron. “You don’t move, I am not done with you yet.” She scolded before turning and heading into her office.
Dear Minerva, I wanted to inform you that i have decided to take you up on your offer of coming back for an eighth year. I hope it isn’t too late, for I wasn’t planning on coming back, but had a very nice discussion with Andromeda Tonks about Teddy’s future and decided that what kind of person I would be if I raised him and kept telling him to stay in school if I didn’t even finish school. I understand if the deadline is up I wouldn’t expect you to make an exception for me, but I was hoping that I could come back if you would allow me to. Hope to hear back from you, and if I don’t I understand. Harry Potter
“That is wonderful, Dobby. I do need your help, Dobby. You see your old master is trying to hurt me again, he's poisoned my food and I know that you would never do anything of the sort, you would protect me, so I would like to request for you to make my meals for me until Lucius is caught you see. We just want to make sure he can’t hurt me or the babies again. Do you understand?” Harkin stated.
“I may have eaten enough for both of us, but you are feeding two more people, so eat.” Draco retorted, and the table went dead silent. “What you will laugh at her jab but not mine?” Draco questioned the table.
“What?” Harkin asked as she looked up at Lucius, who had anger printed clearly on his face, which scared Harkin slightly.
She looked at the box and then up at Draco, and he just smiled at her. She took the box in her hands, and she slowly opened the small box. Harkin gasped as she saw what was in the box. “Dray?” She questioned.
“Are you only acting this way around me because I’m now a woman? You’ve always acted like you despised me.” Harry moaned, and Malfoy traveled a little higher, catching the edge of Harry’s jaw. Harry threw her head back and moaned. “Merlin, what is everyone going to think, Malfoy?”
“You went to see Remus, who is staying at Number 12 Grimmauld Place, which is Sirius’ family home.” Draco stated, and Harkin stared at him.
Draco slid inside Harry, and she let out a small scream as he let her adjust. She wrapped her legs around him, and he slowly started to move. Draco froze as he heard the library door bang open and he pulled out of Harry with a small whimper from her and pulled her down one of the shelves that were never visited. Harry let him pull her along, until they found a small alcove, and he pulled her inside.
“Wait, doesn’t this spell only take into account half of what this spell here does, so don’t we need another spell that can counter the other half of this spell.” Draco said as he pointed at a couple of the spells on the list. Madam Pomfrey looked it over and then commented.
“Oh, cub. You will have a place you call home; you just need to find the people you care about most to settle in with, and that is the place that you call home.” Remus stated. “That’s how I feel with Siri.” Remus whispered.
Alright, everyone so this is the last chapter, but let me know about your thoughts on this one, if you want a sequel, or your thoughts on the vampire aspect of this story. Any thing, just let me know.
“Of course, Dumbledore set you up. Precise little golden boy.” Draco drawled. “It’s no wonder you Gryffindors always win the house cup.
“You did scream a little bit out, so from that small bit I can take a decent guess as to what the dream was about.” Harkin stated as she just stared him down.
“Why do you care? I was kidnapped from school right outside the great hall where everyone was having lunch by Theodore Nott and then taken to his father. You two are Death Eaters, you should have known he was trying something, and could have stopped it. I’m going to go and try and get this stupid corset off.” Harry stormed off and found her room with a little help from Nagini.
“Of course, though you should stop doing that as well. Food is fuel, fuel makes your magic more stable.” Severus stated.
“You realize that people are judging you, they are just not doing it anywhere near you. Your friends are with you 100 percent but some people are still stuck in the old ways, and they think that you should be kicked out of school for getting pregnant. A few generations ago you would have been, but we are slowly evolving and that isn’t the case anymore, because you can’t become successful unless you have schooling too.” Draco explained. “Though the people who matter aren’t judging you and don’t care what others are thinking. I sure as hell don’t care. These are my children, no matter what the biological tests are saying, and I will blood adopt them as soon as they are born so they will legally be mine. Thaddeus Nott will have no say in what happens to either of these children. I will fight the Ministry if I have to, and Mother will too. We will make sure they are safe and completely ours, and ours alone.” Draco said as he kissed the side of her neck.
“Oh, for heaven’s sake, you don’t know how to comfort your own son.” Hermione stated as she marched over to Draco practically pushing Lucius aside to pull Draco into her lap to comfort him. “Harry is tough and strong; she’ll make it through this. She’s made it through too much not too.” Hermione soothed as she brushed him as she brushed her fingers through his hair.
“I was a right git, that’s why you left. I shouldn’t have taken it out on you like that. What happened wasn’t you fault, I instigated it, and I shouldn’t have yelled at you for something that wasn’t your fault. Especially in the condition you are in.” Draco stated and Harkin smiled.
“Thank you.” She whispered again, and then she turned and took Draco’s hand. The couple then headed out of the hospital wing and down to the great hall for breakfast with Severus on their tail. As soon as they reached the great hall, Draco immediately pulled Harkin over to the Slytherin table to apply the paste for her black eye, and everyone immediately started asking questions, which made Harkin smile. The Gryffindors never do that, your close friends like Ron and Hermione and eventually Ginny did, but not everyone at the table practically. Harkin just smiled and said that it was nothing, which upset Draco, and he ended up telling them the story anyway. The Slytherin table was in a small uproar about the whole thing, until Ginny walked up with Ron a small distance behind her, and the entire table was in silence as they waited for Harkin to react.
“Yes, Mom. Father used polyjuice potion and disguised himself as you, it threw me off at first, but Harry figured it out right away and he took care of stunning him and we ran out of the room and found Tonks. She took care of the rest. We’re fine, though, Mom,” Draco reassured his mother and rested his free hand on his mother’s that was resting on his cheek. “Everything is going to be alright. Okay, we can still go on that holiday that you wanted to go on and we can enjoy ourselves and forget about father. Sound good, Mom?”
“You know me so well little Potter, or has my nephew claimed your virtue already?” Bellatrix said as Harkin felt arms wrap around her and a knife pressed to her throat.
“Yes, eventually.” Draco walked into the hospital wing, and Harry pulled the invisibility cloak off of them and pushed it inside Draco’s back pocket. Harry trusted him that much; that he would put the cloak in Draco’s pocket and not his own. Draco set Harry down on the bed and walked over to Madam Pomfrey’s office at the end of the wing. “Madam Pomfrey?” Draco asked as he knocked on the door.
Alright, so i have tallied the votes for the names and not many people commented, so what i am going to do is give a shorter list, and not post another chapter until there is a winner. Meaning i would very much appreciate it if you vote. These are the female names for Harry that have been narrowed down: Harley, Heather, Hayden, Haleigh, Harper, Hailyn, and Harrianna was added and i liked it. So thoughts, please comment I'd like to start using this as soon as i can.
“Yeah, I’ll see you, Professor.” Minerva walked out of the room and Harry heard the front door close behind her as she left. Harry turned back to Teddy to find that he had covered himself in the jar of baby food that Harry was about to feed him. “Merlin, Teddy. I don’t pay you any attention for a few minutes and you cover yourself in your food. Now, you get this jar.” Harry stated as he picked up the deserted jar on the table and opened it.
Rodolphus walked back to the table and came back with a sword. Rodolphus didn’t notice the swinging that Harry was forcing, and as soon as Rodolphus was close enough, Harry swung his legs up and around Rodolphus’ neck, turning him so he was facing away from Harry. Harry used his leverage to push Rodolphus down on his knees, but Rodolphus did something unexpected and brought the sword backwards and into Harry’s chest.
“That is amazing. You are going right. That would be an amazing opportunity for you, not to mention your relationship with Fred.” Harkin stated, and Hermione gave her a questioning look. “Oh, come on, don’t lie to me. You like him, and he likes you. Go for it, Mione, I think you would be perfect for each other. Honestly, much better than Ron, especially if he isn’t going to get his head out of his arse. Fred would be good for you.” Harkin encouraged, and Hermione smiled.
“Hey, Harry. You gave me quite a scare there, Potter.” Draco said as he leaned forwards and took Harry’s hand in both of his.
“Yes, father. I promise.” Lucius walked out of the room and fixed the door as he did so. Both the boys let out a small sigh as the door fixed and closed behind Lucius. “That was close.” Draco walked over and looked Harry in the eyes. “He didn’t see anything right?”
“You are going to look me in the eyes as I fuck you. Me being the first in your many future endeavors. I’m going to ruin you for anything that’ll last forever.” The man snarled, and Harry whimpered. This was going to be painful and probably damaging, and she knew that. “You’re going to be a duck toy for the Dark Lord’s followers for the rest of your life, Potter. For however long that may be.” Harry’s eyes were wide open as the man’s clothes disappeared, and he forced himself inside her.
“I know, fawn; I won’t make you go back, and I will do everything in my power to make sure you don’t have to go back. Alright, I promise.” Harry just hugged Sirius tighter, and Sirius let her knowing that she needed the comfort. “It’s alright, fawn; it’s alright.”
“I don’t know, Harry, but I just want it to last, so I just don’t want to say that it won’t work out, because I really want it to work out. Do you know what I mean, Harry?” Draco explained as he turned towards Harry and entwined his fingers through Harry’s hair. “Harry, I want you and only you. You can give us a chance right?”
“Yes. Yes, it does.” Draco flew after her and kept at her heels. He leveled with her, and they both looked at each other with smirks on their faces, and then they glanced back at the snitch. They both held their hands out towards the snitch, and they both wrapped their fingers around it. They then started losing altitude, and they both looked at each other.
“He will be alright with it when he realizes that it was the only way to pull them out of the stasis.” Snape said.
“He’s gotten better marks than Lucius ever got in school, but he was always badgered him about Ms. Granger beating his marks; I would find Draco in his room his first few years in his room crying after Lucius would scream at him, and I would cradle my baby boy in my arms and comfort him as he cried. Draco has and will always be my baby, and Lucius knows that Draco will listen to me before he listens to him.”
“Do you think those are a good idea, mum? Harry being a half-blood.” Draco asked. “Those women are more brutal than some of the pureblood men we know.”
“Draco! What is going on in here is the real question, isn’t it? When were you going to tell me about this? You and him?” Lucius stated in disbelief.
“No, of course not. I don’t want to ruin your fun, Rodolphus. Hey, do you have like a nickname or something shorter to call you, because I think after you get started it’ll be a little difficult to call you Rodolphus?”
Draco chuckled, and he started playing with her clitoris. “Dray… Draco…” Harry moaned as her fingers dug into the edge of the desk, turning her knuckles white. Harry felt this pressure building, and she let out a scream as she arched her back. Harry relaxed against the desk, and Draco stood up straight. “Where do you think you are going, Malfoy? You bring me off and then leave, really?” Harry slipped off the table and winced slightly as her bare feet hit the cold floor. “I don’t think so.” Harry grabbed Malfoy’s tie and pulled him back, and she pinned him against the desk.
“I just mean, you are pregnant. One I shouldn’t have yelled at you, it was the wrong reaction, stress isn’t good for the pregnancy, and I think you’ve had too much of that as it is. Two you’re sensitive. I’ve read up on pregnancies, and a woman’s body becomes sensitive to touch. I could touch you just right once, and you can be turned on. Not to mention, your emotions which explains your reaction to my father earlier, though completely justified. He had no right talking to you like that. He’s not someone that you trust, I know that, he knows that, or at least should, and he had no right. I’ll talk to him about that.” Draco stated, and Harkin smiled wider.
Draco panted as he rested his forehead against Harkin’s and slipped out of her, and Draco sat down in one of the chairs that were left standing and pulled Harkin into his lap. “You might want to clean up our mess before your mother figures out what happened.” Harkin muttered into Draco’s neck, and she felt as Draco moved his arm and Harkin felt as the magic washed over her. Harkin sighed, and melted into Draco’s embrace. “Where did you throw my knickers?” Harkin asked with a sigh.
The next morning when Draco woke up he grabbed his toiletry bag and hurried to the shower before and of his dorm mates could steal the shower from him. He climbed into the shower and quickly showered so he could head up to breakfast since he didn’t eat the night before. Draco climbed out of the shower and semi dried off and pulled on a pair of boxers before he walked out of the bathroom as he dried his hair. Not expecting anyone else to be awake yet, he ran into someone and when he pulled the towel away from his face his eyes met Blaise’s.
Harry turned around and saw Ron was staring at her. “What? Why does everyone keep staring at me?” Harry look back and forth between Ron and Hermione. “Do I have something on my face, or on my clothes? What?”
Draco invited Harry over to the Manor the summer after their second year at Hogwarts, and when he showed Harry the room that would eventually be called Harry’s bedroom, Harry’s emeralds had a certain sparkle to them. When Draco told Harry that the room was his and only his whenever he was over Harry wrapped his arms tightly around him in a hug.
“Severus just floo called and informed me that Thaddeus escaped capture along with your sister and a group of low level Death Eaters.”
“For the ones that I lost and wishing that they were happy where ever they were now, and the hope that in the end I will see them again.” Harry pushed with all his might the memories of Sirius and the few memories he had of his parents towards Voldemort.
“Har, please.” Draco moaned, and Harkin smiled wider, pulling off of him, which made him whimper again. He lifted the covers and threw them down so he could see her lying there sucking him off. “Har, I really don’t mind you waking me up like this but when I’m already hard from my dreams this is torture.” Draco moaned as he tried to thrust his hips back into her moist mouth.
Draco leaned down and captured Harry’s lips with his own; Harry pulled back as far as he could and looked Draco in the eyes. “My turn to ask you a question. How long?” Harry asked hoping that Draco understood, because he couldn’t figure out how to say it right.
“You’re just a pretty little thing as a girl, Potter, aren’t you? I could actually have some fun with you, but not yet.” Harry recognized the voice but she couldn’t place it in the state she was in. She could feel as her knickers were roughly pulled back up and they laid cockeyed on her hips. She dropped to the ground with a moan and her mind felt as if something was being pulled from her head, and she passed out.
“In you go. All of your things are already inside, Draco. And Harry I had the liberty of buying all of the books that we were using this term for you and had the teachers notes duplicated for you. Your defence note were my own from last year. I hope you do well on your NEWTs.” Snape said and walked away. Draco pulled Harry into the room, and they saw two desks in the front room with a fireplace in the middle with a couch sitting in front of it. Draco shut the door behind them and he slowly moved to the next room, it was a tiny kitchen with a small dinette, and off of that was the bathroom and bedroom also accessible from the front room that they walked into.
“My mother, she can in and drew my attention away from the blood for just long enough that I realized what I was doing. It was an accident that I forced Harry into this, but I don’t think he exactly minds; I don’t really either.” Draco muttered without looking up from Harry.
“Because you didn’t look like your mother. You looked too much like your father, and had his attitude to match.” Severus stated.
“Do you like lemon drops, my boy?” Draco thought the question odd, but he figured it a secret message.
“Thank you, mum.” Draco breathed as he embraced his mother pulling her close, while trying not to jostle Harry.
“This is all I am going to tell you because this is all I know that your father wouldn’t mind me telling you. To my knowledge, no one that you care about is going to be in danger, unless they get in the way.” Narcissa deliberately looked at Draco the entire time until she reached her last statement when she turned to Harry and said it directly at Harry, like she knew exactly how close her son and Harry actually were. Draco looked at his mother and followed her gaze to Harry who stood behind him. Draco just about crumbled, but Harry quickly placed a hand on Draco’s back without being seen and his hand steadied Draco a lot more than he thought it would.
“You’re welcome, Harry. I think Hermione can take the lead on this now. Miss Weasley, get off the floor and stop pouting. Harry would have come to the conclusion anyway, and you should have seen this coming from a mile away. Come along.” Andromeda said as she pulled Ginny from the room. After they were gone, Harry turned to Hermione.
“Oh, Lucius. He’s a teenage boy, I’m pretty sure we have done the same thing in that very alcove when we were in school. Your parents didn’t care though and we never got caught. He’s in love, Lucius. Let him figure it out on his own.”
“Anything for you, cub. We just want you to be happy.” Remus whispered in her ear, and he pulled her away to look at her to see the tears streaming down her face. “What’s the matter, cub?”
Harry finally came inside of Draco, and Draco’s cum splattered across their chests. Draco rolled off of Harry and the pair curled into each other’s sides. Draco’s fingers started tracing the bit mark that he created on Harry’s collarbone, and he said, “Harry, you are okay with this?” Draco kept circling around the bit mark, but he didn’t look at Harry, he kept his eyes on the scabbed over bit mark on Harry’s collarbone. Harry reached over and lifted Draco’s face up, so he could see Draco’s beautiful grey eyes. When Harry could finally see Draco’s eyes, he leaned in and kissed Draco.
They went back to Hogwarts where McGonagall escorted Harry and Hermione up to the Gryffindor common room. McGonagall stopped Harry from going in, and said, “Potter, I wanted to inform you that your belongings were moved from the boys’ dorm to a private room in the tower if you wish me to show you.”
“Draco, just ask her when she comes back. Stay with you injured fiancée.” Harkin said, and Draco sat back down on the bed.
“Yes, but I also like the soft, gentle sex like we’re having right now, that’s my favorite. It makes me feel like they actually care about me, and not about my status.” Harry stated and then he turned away from Draco. Draco pulled out of Harry, and turned him around.
“You’re eating like it’s the end of the world, Hermione.” Seamus said as he walked up to the table. Hermione stood up and gave him a lose hug.
“Blaise, I’ll be out in a little bit.” Draco said over Harry’s shoulder whose face was pressed into Draco’s shoulder so Blaise couldn’t see him. Blaise rolled his eyes and walked out of the room closing the door behind him. “We didn’t have a locking charm or silencing charm on the door.” Draco realized. Harry pulled his face away from Draco’s shoulder and looked him in the eyes. “Yes, Harry, I’m a screamer when I get fuck, that much I do remember.”
“This right here. You wrapped around Harry. If I am correct, because your magic is linked you will heal faster with each other close, where your magical core doesn’t have to reach so far to find it’s other half. She should heal faster with you so close to you, and vice versa. At least that is my theory. I can’t be certain until it is proven right, though I am certain I am correct.”
“Would you listen to me, please?” Harkin shouted. “She cleared me because she knows exactly what’s wrong and how to fix it.”
“You don’t get it, that is exactly what I am trying to do as well. I just want my best friend back, but I know that can’t happen as long as he is around.” Ron stated and he flourished his wand at Draco, which Harkin and Draco both easily produced a shielding charm to deflect it.
“Har,” Draco said as Harkin walked to the door, and she undid all of her spells before opening the door and storming out.
“May I accompany you to breakfast?” Draco asked as he held out his hand, and Harry was forcing her books and parchment into her bag.
“You have to ask. What is my specialty, Har?” Ginny grinned, and Harkin busted out laughing. “He deserved it after I found out that he punched you in the face, and then you let him off the hook for it.” Ginny scolded.
“I can show you to your room, if you wouldn’t mind coming with me, please.” Draco stood up and pulled Harry with him. She pulled the boys through the house and into one of her bedrooms, and she made the bed and left the boys to get settled. Narcissa pulled their trunks into the room and left. Draco and Harry sat down on the bed and just laid down on the bed. Harry rolled into Draco’s side and rested his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“We’re not going to have to get me a heat lamp, are we?” Harry joked, his teeth still chattering as Draco started rubbing a towel over him.
Draco was about to pull on his pants when Harry dropped to her knees. “Harry, what are you…” Draco trailed off as Harry took his length in her mouth and started sucking him off. She swirled her tongue just right making Draco moan. His fingers found their way into Harry’s hair, and she braced her hands on his hips. Her one hand started playing with his bullocks, and he whispered, “Merlin, Harry.” Harry rolled his bullocks in her hand as she swirled her tongue, and Draco whispered, “I’m going to come, love.” And Harry sucked a little harder and he came down her throat. After she swallowed everything, she pulled off him, and he pulled her up to his lips and kissed her.
Draco will be returning to Hogwarts this fall for an extended year as newly appointed Headmistress Minerva McGonagall has offered an extended year to all the students that should have finished their N.E.W.T.s this past spring. A majority of the students are returning, but it is still unknown if Harry Potter is to return or not.
“Lu, I need to go and write this down. Sorry, it’s just, it’s brilliant, and I need to write this down before I forget what’s going on in my head.” Severus said as he went to walk out of the room, and he walked up to Harkin and placed his hands on her shoulders. “I’m glad you’re alright.” He said and disappeared.
Once Severus and Draco were alone, Severus turned towards Draco. “Just focus on him, Draco. Focus on Harry. Think about his smell, the way he feels, the way he looks, anything that reminds you of him.”
“Bring him with me. What else would I do?” Draco asked as he stroked Harry’s hair back out of his face. “I wouldn’t leave him here, where I couldn’t keep him safe.” Draco said as his attention was focused on Harry.
“No, I just stunned your father, who used polyjuice potion to become your mother. That look she had on her face wasn’t something she would do, it was something that your father did, and you do it to,” Harry said as he stroked Draco’s cheek. “But there is nothing in this world that would make your mother put that sneer on her face, unless your father was impersonating her. Do you understand what I’m saying Draco?”
“I wasn’t going to say anything, but I was thinking about what your father is going to say when he sees it.” Harkin stated, and Draco froze mid-stride and swore under his breath, causing Harkin to smile wider.
“No, sir. We weren’t supposed to be flying, but I was just showing Harry what was so great about flying since he didn’t grow up with it the way that I did. I’m sorry, Professor; I didn’t mean to get Harry in trouble, sir.”
“Lily’s and my friendship didn’t end well. I had said something that I didn’t meaning the heat of an argument and she never spoke to me again. That was shortly before graduation, and she married your father soon after. I obviously became a death eater, and then there was the prophecy and the dark lord thought it was about you. That was when I switched sides. Lily and I may have split ways not on good terms, but I couldn’t be a part of the reason she was dead. Though she ended up dead anyway. I ask Dumbledore if I could take care of you after Black was arrested, but he said you were safer with Petunia. She never liked me so she wouldn’t let me in to check and make sure you were alright. I had to know, you were a part of Lily.”
“Ha, tell that to Percy. I was kidnapped at least, and I think of everyone who knows about this prophecy I deserve to know most of all. I deserve to know why he went after my parents and try and kill me when I was a baby. Don’t I? I just want answers that no one is giving me. I’m safe right now, and I want answers, Arthur. Don’t make me hurt you. I will deeply regret it, and Ron and Hermione will probably never talk to me again. You getting hurt can’t be my fault. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself.”
“Harry can do wandless magic, Hermione. He’s not great at it but he can. You’ve never noticed that when he’s angry or frustrated the lights in the tent would flicker. Or glasses would shatter.”
Harry spent that time tossing Teddy in the air like he liked. Then Harry saw more people starting to come onto the platform, and that’s when Harry saw a group of people with red hair coming towards him. Teddy upon seeing the group changed his hair color to red. Hermione was the first person to greet him with a big hug, and then Mrs. Weasley was on him, hugging the life out of him.
“Yeah, I assume, Hermione filled you in. Why? What’s happened in the past five months? I remember very little.” Ginny leaned back in and kissed him again. She pulled back this time right away, and she snuggled into Harry’s shoulder.
“Dray, what do you mean? We’ve been through this, if I wasn’t alright with this then I wouldn’t be here right now. Why do you keep asking me this, Dray?” Harry stroked his thumb back and forth across Draco’s cheek. “I am completely fine with this Draco.”
“Draco, where we are going your father isn’t going to find us I promise. He won’t think to look for us where we are going. He is never going to see you or Harry again. He can ruin his life, but he will not bring my boys down with him. Your father made me a promise 15 almost 16 years ago and he broke that promise to me, and for that he never gets to see his son again.” Narcissa said as she sat down on the bed in the boys’ room. “I just want you two to have a better holiday than what has played out so far and Lucius can’t ruin it. He can’t ruin it, because your father isn’t going to be in our lives anymore, and I am not allowing him to ruin something that he isn’t a part of. Draco, your father told me about the thing that he wanted you to do, and I can’t allow him to see or talk to you ever again. He got himself into something, and he wanted to drag you down with him, Draco, and I couldn’t allow him to drag you into this, Draco. You’re my son and you aren’t getting involved in this. Ever!” Narcissa stated. She was almost in tears, and Draco walked over and wrapped his arms around his mother.
“You are welcome, my boy, and sleep well.” Draco walked out the door and down the staircase as he headed towards the hospital wing.
“I help Professor Snape tutor the younger years. Now if you excuse me I have to go check on someone.”
“Severus and I will go get her, and bring her home. I promise, Dragon.” Narcissa said as she brushed his hair out of his face to kiss his forehead.
“I was born.” Harry whispered, and Draco could see the rage in his mother’s otherwise calm expression. Draco pulled Harry closer, and Narcissa backed off a little.
Harry smiled as she pulled Sirius back in for a hug, and she closed her eyes as she opened her mouth to tell Sirius about the baby. “Siri, I have something I need to tell you,” she whispered.
“Yes, Pansy Parkinson was one of my childhood friends. You honestly think she didn’t force us to learn to braid for her. Do you want me to braid your hair, love?” Draco stated, and Harkin sat up and crawled into Draco’s lap facing away from him.
“Miss Granger, look up.” McGonagall said and Hermione did so. McGonagall watched as Hermione’s eyes lit up. She levitated the Diadem down and she pulled out the Sword of Gryffindor from her bag and placed the Diadem on the ground. The sword plunged down and impaled the Diadem, and it released a scream that resembled those of Harry’s. Everyone else came running from other places in the room at the screams, and when they reached where Hermione and McGonagall were standing they looked at the remains of the Diadem.
“Nothing, I was just shocked by that statement since I was talking about Draco’s and my sex life.” Harkin stated confused.
“Harry,” Draco said as he pulled Harry on top of him so she was straddling his waist. Harry rested her head against Draco’s chest with her long, raven hair fanned out across his white dress shirt. Draco took his hand and brushed all of her hair to one side, and Harry lifted her head and looked Draco in the eyes. “Lunch?” Draco asked as his hand caressed Harry’s jaw.
“Wait, I thought muggles weren’t supposed to know about magic?” Harry asked as they walked down the last step.
“Ah…” Draco screamed as he fully seated himself in Harkin’s heat, and he paused. “My raven you are so…so tight. It’s delightful.” Draco moaned, and he’s head fell backwards. “Mmm…you are amazing, my beautiful raven.” Draco moaned as a whimper escaped Harkin’s lips.
“You are my godson, Draco. I’d do anything for you. Let’s find Mr. Potter.” Draco focused on Harry; first he pictured his face, and pieced Harry together with the way he smelled, the way he tasted, and the way his skin felt against his own. Draco pictured all of his memories of Harry and pushed them to the fore front of his mind, and he pushed them out and towards Harry; he focused on finding him.
“The baby is yours; I doubled and triple checked. Your bond is still there; it’s just not trying to kill the three of you anymore.”
“Miss Potter, Mr. Malfoy come with me. Miss Parkinson, please head to the Slytherin common room.” Severus said.
“No, I didn’t really look around much. Though I find that nice of them to give us a room with a nursery for the twins.” Harkin said as she rubbed her small baby bump. “Is it weird to say that I feel if this would have happened in the muggle world, I would have been judged just a little bit more for having kids while still in school?”
“He is perfectly safe there, Severus, I don’t know what your concern is. Why do you even care about the boy?”
“I’m sorry, I cannot, and I won’t tell you about the secret passage to Miss Potter’s room around the corner with the password, Treacle tart.”
“Love, breathe. You just need to breathe.” Draco whispered in her ear as he rubbed circles on her back.
“Yes, but I want a shower first.” She walked over to Draco’s bathroom and opened the door. “Bloody hell!” Harry said as she stared into the huge five piece bathroom.
“Can I come through? I just…I just need to get away from Draco for a while, and maybe teach him a lesson. Can I come through, I just need to talk to someone who isn’t a Malfoy. I know that they are just trying to help, but I just need to be away from them.” Harkin stated, and she could see Remus understood.
Malfoy turned and pulled Harry into his arms, and he leaned in and whispered in her ear, “I’m finishing what I started earlier. Are you alright with that, Potter?” Malfoy then sucked Harry’s earlobe between his teeth. “Now are you coming or not?” Malfoy started walking away, and he pulled her along with him. This time she didn’t resist as he pulled her behind him. He reached a room and pulled Harry in behind him. He quickly shut the door, and cast a locking and silencing charm on the room. Harry walked over to the desk and propped herself up on it, and Malfoy walked up to her and placed his hand on her knees.
“You’ll see as long as you tell no one. I’m not sure how Harry is going to feel about it, but we need to find her.” Ron ran into the room and into Harry’s new room and grabbed the Marauder’s Map, and he ran back out of the room and into the corridor where Draco and Hermione were waiting. “Tell anyone about this and Harry will have words with you. Come on. We better get moving before the rest of Gryffindor comes up.” Ron said as he pulled on Hermione’s arm and the trio started walking away as they heard the prefects escorting the rest of the Gryffindors up to the common room. “Harry’s father and his group of friends created a map of Hogwarts when they were in school. It shows all of the secret passages and corridors, everything from the dungeons to the highest tower, all the secrets in and out of the building, and one other thing.” Ron pulled out his wand and pointed it at the piece of parchment and whispered, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.” And the ink spread across the pages and turned into the layout of Hogwarts, then the dots appeared to show where everyone was. Their dots appeared on the seventh floor just around the corner and out of view of the Gryffindor Common room where the other Gryffindor prefects were escorting the Gryffindors into the common room.
Severus took Draco’s hand, and Draco took Harkin’s hand; and Severus apparated. When they reached the station, and Severus pulled them straight to the train and into a compartment. “How is Remus doing?” Harkin asked Severus as she was pulled behind Draco.
“Raven?” Draco questioned as he quickly moved to swoop her into his arms. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” He muttered over and over until Harkin started giggling. “Har?” he whispered.
“No, Mr. Malfoy. You and Miss Potter are free to go.” Professor Umbridge said as she walked towards the door.
Everyone was waiting for them, and as soon as Harry stepped into the room, Voldemort’s voice could be heard. “And here comes our guest of honor, the now, Miss Harry Potter. Isn’t she magnificent?” he stated and everyone turned to look at her. She could see the hungry eyes and the disgusted eyes, but she wasn’t sure which ones she preferred because they were both unsettling. Voldemort walked up to Harry and took her hand and pulled her onto the dance floor.
“I understand that, but my dad got hurt because you couldn’t have your boyfriend lose his parents. My dad who has been like a father to you for five years, and he got hurt. How do you expect me to react, Harry?” Ron yelled and Harry flinched. Draco pulled her closer and she buried her face in his chest.
“Oh, Harkin, darling. We were wondering when you and Draco would come down. Where is Draco?” she asked.
“Yeah, I’ll go and get her from class. She has potions right now, so Professor Slughorn will let her leave. Especially, if it has anything to do with you. I’ll be right back don’t ask any questions until either I get back or Andromeda shows up alright?”
“I do. You tied Harry and Draco together. Their magic is like magnets; their magical cores are constantly pulling them together. Harry and Draco are magically bonded together, and with the baby already being inside Harry, the baby is putting strain on her body. I can fix it, though but I’m going to need Severus’ help. I need to know the ingredients you used.” Healer Johnson said.
“Bloody hell, mate. You sounded exactly like Mione and my mum. Merlin is that a girl thing.” Harry started laughing harder, and Hermione and the rest of the Gryffindor’s joined in.
“7 pm on the day back from break, Weasley. Don’t be late. You are dismissed.” Snape said and Draco put Tally down and sent her off. Ron groaned, but he turned and walked out of the room in a huff. Draco moved to follow him, but Severus caught his arm. “Don’t even think about it, Draco. I know you actually did what Mr. Weasley accused you of. Now how did you do it?”
You killed Voldemort?” Granger asked with disbelief. “How do we even know you are telling the truth? For all we know he’s not even here.”
“I still have his attitude for the most part and my mother’s fiery temper.” Harkin stated with a smile.
“Let’s get out of here quickly then.” Lucius grabbed her hand and pulled her from the room and down the hall when she saw someone standing at the end of the hall and realized it was Arthur.
“I stunned him. The Dark Lord is easier to deal with in Harry’s form. He doesn’t know how to control Harry’s power yet. Which makes him more of an eleven year old Harry again. We have until he learns to harness Harry’s power to save him, once the Dark Lord has complete control, I don’t know how to get him back except by killing him or by having Harry do it from the inside. I just hope while they are unconscious Harry can fight his way out of the recesses of his own mind to take over long enough for us to destroy the Horcrux. This also means that we can’t destroy it until Harry is himself again, otherwise he might be trapped inside his own mind forever, and you will both slowly die.”
“All I figured out was that I love you, and I don’t care about the rest.” Harry got up off the floor and pulled Draco’s lips towards his own. Draco was surprised at first and then relaxed into the kiss, kissing Harry back. Draco pushed Harry up against the shower wall and trapped him against the wall. Harry slipped his arms around Draco and pulled him closer, and Harry slipped his hands down and around Draco’s butt, pulling his hips forward, grinding into Harry’s erection. Draco groaned as his erection grinded against Harry’s, and Harry slipped one of his hands up into Draco’s hair and pulled it to the side. Harry latched onto Draco’s neck, and Harry bit down on Draco’s collarbone.
Harry quickly sat down at the table next to Hermione and started piling food onto her plate, and she could feel the entire Gryffindor table’s eyes on her, but she didn’t care about them; it was the eyes across the hall that she knew belonged to Draco Malfoy that she was smiling about. She could feel the blush rising in her cheeks as Ron trying to get her attention. Finally, she caved and whipped towards Ron and said, “Yes, Ronald.” And Ron stopped and stared dumbfounded at Harry. Harry immediately started laughing at the look on his face.
“One of my friends is going to be here soon to help me with my renovation to the house, so you picked the wrong day to come here.” Harry shifted Teddy in his arms as he pulled his wand from his pocket and gave it to Teddy for better access.
“Mom, I just I don’t know what to do. When I’m not around her, I feel like I’ve lost part of myself. Like part of me is missing. I feel like I can’t control myself if she isn’t next to me, and when we touch it’s like electricity runs through my entire being.” Draco stated, and Narcissa could see the passion in his eyes again, like she could when he was younger, before her husband corrupted the innocent boy and formed him into a mini version of himself. Draco was her little dragon again, and she wrapped her arms around her confused son.
“But we have all day tomorrow, and I’m tired.” Harkin whispered as she buried her face in his chest.
“Can I touch your stomach?” Theo questioned shyly, and Harkin just stuffing some chicken in her mouth turned towards him and just nodded. Theo laughed a little, and then he reached over and placed a hand on her stomach. “It is amazing to think that there are two human beings growing inside of you.” Theo stated, and then looked up at her meeting her eyes and whispering, “And that one of them is technically my younger sibling.” Harkin could see the sadness in his eyes, and she smiled at him.
“Because I’m a freak. I’ve always been a freak. It started when my parents died and I survived the killing curse. It continued when Dumbledore left me on the steps of my aunt and uncle, and I started experiencing accidental magic. And progressed as the beatings and abuse progressed, and then I found out that I was a wizard and everything got better. At least until school ended, and I went back to my aunt and uncle’s house. Everything got worse from there, and then this happened. I’m a freak, Draco, and nothing can change that.” Harkin whispered as she tucked her face against Draco’s chest, and Draco lifted her chin so she was looking at him.
“Your smaller and will go unnoticed, and if you follow my plan to a tee it will go without a hitch.” He said and she turned around.
“Were any of you allowed to be flying your brooms while Madam Hooch was off the hospital wing, because I know for a fact that no one was allowed to leave the ground?” The two boys’ heads drooped down not looking at the professor.
“No. No, Severus I can’t risk it, not her. She’s perfect and special, and I can’t risk doing it wrong. I can’t, Severus. I can’t.” Draco repeated as he continued to try and get away from Severus.
Draco smiled back, and entwined their fingers together. “Yes, I did. I didn’t see who did this to you, either, so I’m really hoping that you do.”
“Fine I will talk to my mother about it when she gets home, and I’m Nymphadora Tonks, but you can call me Tonks. Who may you two be?”
“Because it started with you saving the world by getting bit by a very big, very poisonous snake which lead to you defeating the darkest wizard in a long while. You are also just like your mother in your stubbornness.” Severus smiled.
i am sorry for this chapter, when i first started writing this fic i didn't intend for it to go this way, but then i started writing and i figured Voldemort might treat Harry different if he became a girl, and i'm guessing there would be some spell to tell if something is a Horcrux, and of course he had to figure it out. i hope you liked my interpretation of the events comments on how you like this chapter are very much appreciated i'm hoping to get Harry out of Voldemort's grasp in the next few chapters, but i kind of like the way this is heading.
Harry thought as he willed the screaming to stop. But her voice just repeated over and over again with flashes of green light. Harry curled up in the fetal position and covered his ears hoping the screams would stop, but they were in his head, and they were everywhere. And that was when it dawned on Harry, he was in his head that’s why the screaming repeated. He focused on his magic, he didn’t need a wand to cast his Patronus because he was in his own head, and he focused his magic on creating a Patronus, and his stag burst forth in front of his eyes.
“No, Severus’ orders were exact he said I had to do this, and only I could do this. I just want it to work.” Draco cut his mother off, and stepped closer to the bed and sat Harry up so he could slip behind her. Draco heard her moan and try to snuggle into his side, and Draco smiled at that, she knew it was him. “Mother, Severus said it was best if we were alone for this. I don’t know why, but if it wasn’t Severus I wouldn’t say anything. Please.”
“Is there anything else you would like to share about Miss Potter that we don’t already know, Albus? Because it seems you know a lot more than you are saying.”
“No, I didn’t. He looks worse than he actually is. This is a cause of the dark magic that my aunt had on the weapons that her husband used on Harry. Given that the healer gives me the right answers I can fix this quickly.” Draco stated.
“Draco is smart; that has always been clear.” Harry said, and Narcissa took her hand and pulled Harry into the seat next to her.
“My Lord, I can promise you that that is exactly the truth. I did not give them any information about your plans. I just wanted to protect my son, and the best way to do that was to pretend that I was working for Dumbledore, give my son protection no matter who wins this war. It was a lapse of faith, and I deeply apologize for that lapse in my judgment.” Lucius said with a slight bow from his seat next to Narcissa.
“So, you think that a house elf poisoned you?” Melody asked, and Harkin nodded. “So, they gave a house elf the poison and told them to poison you. Merlin, they have gone too far. Something has to be done, but they can’t find them.” Melody stated. “But the good news is that the antidote is easy to brew. Madam Pomfrey, can you go and get Severus, please.” Melody asked, and Madam Pomfrey nodded before hurrying to her office to floo Severus. A few minutes later, Severus walked out of Madam Pomfrey's office, and he walked over to Harkin.
He’s going to make sure the bastard can never come back, but first he’s got to get out of here, he has to fight his way through his memories. He’s done it before, so he can do it again no matter how painful the memory feels. Harry bursts out of Remus’ arms and he runs for the Atrium of the Ministry where he knows Voldemort will be, and he finds him there with his wand drawn.
“And you were, it was a noble thing to do to keep your predicament hidden from people who will make fun of you and draw their own conclusions, but sadly your magic is stabilizing hers, and she needs you at full power not half, especially with twins.” Severus stated.
“I love you, Draco. And what you just said means more to me than anything in the world. People will judge, but I shouldn’t care what they say as long as the people that matter are with me.” Harkin said as she turned in Draco’s lap to kiss him on the lips. “Though I am somehow still really tired.” Harkin commented as she stood up in the tub and stretched before getting out and grabbing a towel to dry off. She walked out of the bathroom, and she walked over to the door on the opposite side of the room. She opened it to see a decent sized walk in closet, and she closed the door to turn and look around for the door to the nursery, and she found it on the side of the room that lead in from the main lounge area, and she walked over to open the door and find a room with two basinets for the twins and two dressers with changing tables on top and in the two opposite corners of the room were two rocking chairs. The walls were this cerulean colored blue that was just beautiful, and the molding around the room was this whitish-silver color that matched the rocking chairs and the dressers, but the basinets were this lilac shade of purple that somehow worked in the room. The small closet in the room was already stocked with various sizes of baby diapers and supplies.
“Already taken care of. My father is taking my mother on a second honeymoon of sorts to the Bahamas so I will be staying at Hogwarts for the holidays unless otherwise asked by other parties.”
“Malfoy, what in bloody hell is going on here?” Weasley tried to keep his voice level but it wasn’t working.
“Good, we need to file those as soon as possible. I don’t want her to have to deal with anything she doesn’t have to especially if she is pregnant.”
“Alright, look in, on, under and around everything. It could be anywhere.” All the teachers started moving, and Hermione grasped McGonagall’s wrist before she could go far. “What do you mean somethings up with Harry?”
“Yes, Father. I’m sorry, Father, but Harry and I were just catching up and sometimes Harry doesn’t like it when people over hear what he’s saying so I thought it would be best to lock the door and put a silence charm on it so some of our nosy house elves don’t over hear what we were talking about. I’m sorry, I thought that would have been alright,” Draco apologized and he looked down at the floor in shame to convincingly pull the lie off, and Harry did the same since he didn’t know where to look without giving Draco’s lie away.
“Come.” He said as he grabbed her arm and pulled her from the bed and down the stairs, and they ended up back in the ball room that was now empty. They stood there and soon Death Eaters were filling up the room again. Once everyone was there, Voldemort started talking. “I’m sorry for the late hour but something urgent just came to my knowledge. Miss Potter is to be unharmed. No one is to touch her in any way possible. If I find out that anyone has, you will face my wrath. Is this information understood?”
Draco was curious, and he crawled onto his bed farther and looked around before putting up privacy charms. Draco then unrolled the rest of the parchment and started reading.
“I don’t know, because you couldn’t get into the common room but an elf would be able to.” Ron said, and Draco had to admit it was pretty sound logic, especially for Ron. That was when McGonagall and Dumbledore walked up.
“Sorry about that. Everything looks good. There doesn’t seem to be any damage. Though I do recommend that if either of you are injured the other should be there. It’ll help with the healing process. I think Severus is right in regards to your magic. Your cores are entangled together so closely that it appears that you share a core. The down side to this bond is that when one of you is hurt it affects the other, and depending on the injury it could disable the other, meaning you have to be careful, because if you don’t then both of you could be in some serious trouble medically. If one goes down the other will follow especially now that Harry is pregnant; the pregnancy will drain both of you because your magical cores are intertwined and our magical cores are similar to our life forces. Though we can live without our magic if we lose it we won’t last long which is why when someone’s magic is taken away their health slowly depletes. The longest I’ve seen or known that someone has lived without their magic is three years, and they weren’t a very powerful wizard.” Healer Johnson finished.
“We were captured by a bunch of Snatchers, and they realized who I was even though our best abilities of hiding it. We were then taken to this house well it wasn’t really a house it was a manor. It was an extravagant manor too, even though I was being taken to my death. We were dragged into the house, and I was placed in front of this rather tall and skinny boy with rather pale blonde hair and pale skin in comparison. He looked me as to confirm who I was, but he wouldn’t say that it was me even though I know he knew it was me as his silver eyes looked deep into mine. Then my memory went blank.” Harry said as he leaned forwards so their noses were almost touching.
